      "content": "## Abstract\nThis proposal, if passed, would whitelist Beluga.fi veManager on PICKLE's VotingEscrow.\n\n* Beluga acquires DILL through the means of offering a wrapper for PICKLE locking.\n* Beluga launches metavaults for PICKLE which maximizes yield for pJar users through the means of Beluga’s boost and Beluga’s innovative maximizer strategies.\n* Beluga offers a beDILL vault which allows users to lock their PICKLE to earn a 3% kickback on PICKLE farmed by Beluga’s VeManager/metavaults + fees distributed to DILL holders.\n* Beluga brings benefit to PICKLE’s liquidity through its yield maximization strategies.\n\n## Proposal\n\nBeluga is seeking to acquire whitelisting on PICKLE Finance’s VotingEscrow contract. Beluga seeks to offer a liquid locking wrapper for DILL which allows for users to reap the benefits of PICKLE locking (and more!) whilst having instant liquidity available at any time for redemption.\n\nBeluga will utilize this lock to offer metavaults for PICKLE’s users that maximize returns on PICKLE’s numerous pJars. This yield maximization will also benefit PICKLE’s liquidity through its maximizer strategies which instead compound into PICKLE’s PICKLE/ETH Sushiswap LP instead of being converted back into the pJar supplied by the user, maximizing the yield generating by PICKLE’s pJars.\n\nThis will allow for PICKLE users to earn boosted maximized yields.\n\nA percentage of this yield generated by these pJar metavaults will also be rewarded back to beDILL holders. This will be in the form of a 3% kickback paid in PICKLE tokens. In total, Beluga will be charging a 16% performance fee to maximize PICKLE yield for users on Pickle.Finance.\n\n## Benefits to PICKLE\n\n* Beluga will bring benefit to PICKLE in the form of stronger liquidity through its yield maximization strategies, which will help bootstrap liquidity for PICKLE.\n* Beluga will allow users of PICKLE’s pJars to maximize their yield to its fullest potential.\n* PICKLE holders will be able to stake their PICKLE tokens without the hassle of lockups.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo conclude, Beluga is seeking to offer a liquid staking option for PICKLE holders to reap the benefits of DILL and also earn a share of Beluga’s boosted yield.

      "content": "> Due to Snapshot character limitations, this proposal has been shortened, the Clarifications, Topics for Discussion, and Notes sections can be found in the [original Forum post](https://forum.pickle.finance/t/rfc-ve-3-3-pickle-aka-3-3-dill/1457).\n---\n\n**author(s):** @larry_cucumber, @leekuanjew, @cipio \n\n---\n\n## Abstract\n\n- As market volatility batters the DeFi 1.0 v DeFi 2.0 narrative,  [Larry the Cucumber has signalled a clear focus on revenues for Pickle as a DeFi OG protocol][1].\n- This proposal was inspired by Andre's ve(3,3) tokenomics for [Solidly][2], a model likely to be implemented on cousin projects Yearn and Keeper. If this proposal passes, the ve tokenomics created by Curve and already adopted by Pickle will be improved to:\n    - clearly frame the utility of $DILL locking as a claim on Pickle revenues: present and future.\n    - reduce dilutive pressure on $DILL lockers.\n    - dynamically reduce $PICKLE emissions as $DILL adoption increases.\n- These enhancements will be accomplished by:\n    - switching the revenue-sharing token to $ETH (either native or wrapped ERC-20) for $DILL distributions.\n    - on top of $ETH from revenue-sharing, adding a second anti-dilutive reward of $PICKLE (either naked or vested $vPICKLE) to $DILL distributions.\n    - introducing dynamic (3,3) emissions i.e. as $DILL supply increases as a % of $PICKLE total supply, emissions will decrease.\n- This proposal contains two parts:\n    - (I) Tokenomics enhancements, summarised above.\n    - (II) Treasury restructuring, summarised below.\n    - Governance discussion is needed to determine if both parts will be voted on together or separately.\n- The proposed tokenomics changes should be accompanied by a restructuring of the Treasury, as follows:\n    - 100% of Protocol revenues to be sent to $DILL lockers.\n    - Governance to authorise a mint representing a 100% increase in locked $PICKLE supply for the main Treasury address.\n    - Treasury to max lock all newly-minted $PICKLEs for $DILL, thus attaining at least 50% of all $DILL (if everyone max-locks).\n    - Treasury to use $ETH received in $DILL distributions for development, bounties, operations, marketing & growth, $CORN buybacks, periodic $PICKLE buybacks, etc – as per the budget approved in PIP-44, under the oversight of the SCCOC.\n    - Treasury to use $PICKLEs received in anti-dilutive $DILL rewards for the following authorised purposes:\n        - for strategic initiatives, approved by the SCCOC.\n        - to build a reserve of $PICKLEs for future use or protocol-owned liquidity, deployed with SCCOC approval.\n        - to re-lock in $DILL, in order to defend its % of ownership, with the advice and consent of the SCCOC.\n    - Treasury to periodically sell reserve $PICKLE on the market as options to community members, CowSwap style, with Governance consent.\n    - Treasury to progressively decentralise the Protocol, increasing the % of $PICKLE in the hands of community members.\n\n## Proposal\n\n### Part I, Section 1: Revenue-sharing for $DILL in $ETH\n\n- At present, revenue-sharing is done by buying $PICKLEs from the market with revenues, which are distributed using the `FeeDistributor` contract.\n- When implemented, the Pickle Protocol had buybacks as part of its value-capture design, so the community believed $PICKLE to be the most appropriate fee token. This version of \"ve\" tokenomics differed from the original veCRV from Curve, which uses $3CRV (a Curve LP position made of the three major stablecoins, essentially a \"yield-bearing dollar\") as a fee token, yet basically, every other protocol that adopted \"ve\" tokenomics after Pickle used our design (using the native token as the fee token), that is until Andre's ve(3,3).\n- The reason ve(3,3) recommends a non-native token is to avoid volatility affecting the status of the fee token as passive income. The idea of ve(3,3) is to go beyond making the governance token an \"interest-bearing asset\" but providing lockers with a clear \"claim on fee ownership\" which requires ownership percentages that can be easily defended, a token with wide utility as the fee token, and a mechanism to make locking collectively desirable. \n- Over our time using $PICKLE as the fee token, we have found that the effects of buybacks to be temporary and only accrue to the most sophisticated traders, whereas most lockers end up absorbing the $PICKLE volatility, which makes it harder to use $DILL as a tool for passive income.\n- Using $ETH as the fee token instead of $PICKLE makes sense as the first step towards ve(3,3)PICKLE. Harking back to the time of \"\\$PICKLE gives you $ETH\", the idea would be to create demand for $PICKLE not from buybacks, but because they represent a claim rights to a steady (or even better, a growing) stream of a highly sought-after, hyper-liquid, ultra-high utility token like $ETH. As $ETH is much less volatile than $PICKLE, a user may even be incentivised to increase his \"percentage of ownership\" in the Protocol by buying $PICKLEs back with their $ETH in order to increase their lock amounts.\n\n### Part I, Section 2: Anti-dilutive $PICKLE rewards for $DILL\n\n- users will continue to receive $PICKLE rewards for depositing into $DILL\n- these rewards will not come from $PICKLE buybacks (tho may occasionally do so as \"special dividends\"), but rather from \"anti-dilutive\" emissions.\n- `dill.totalSupply / pickle.totalSupply` of adjusted emissions will go to $DILL holders every week, the rest going to farms. Auxiliary contracts may be needed to obtain these parameters precisely or the implementation may involve averaging these parameters over the course of an epoch via off-chain scripting. Implementation details left to Core team.\n- to mitigate impact to farms, emissions will be set to 0.15 `picklePerBlock`as new initial state of the system.\n- dual rewards (revenue-sharing + anti-dilutive) managed by a new `FeeDistributorV2` contract, to be developed by the Core team should this proposal pass.\n- borrowing from Olympus's original (3,3), there is the possibility to add a time delay to these anti-dilutive $PICKLEs so they're even less likely to be dumped right away. Using a contract called `VestedERC20.sol`, $PICKLE can be wrapped into $vPICKLE, which is at the same time transferrable and linearly vesting $PICKLE (say over the course of 5 days). \n- Of note, using $vPIKCLE would add significantly more complexity as we would have to create $vPICKLEs with the right expiry for every distribution of anti-dilutive rewards. The user would also need to pay a transaction to redeem the underlying $PICKLEs, likely using Etherscan. The decision is up to the DAO.\n\n### Part I, Section 3: Dynamic $PICKLE emissions\n\n- to fully enable (3,3) dynamics, $PICKLE emissions will decrease as $DILL increases relative to $PICKLE. A fixed `emissions` parameter will be adjusted with the formula `adjusted_emissions = emissions * ( 1 - ( dill.totalSupply / pickle.totalSupply ))`.\n- This means if all $PICKLEs are max-locked, `adjusted_emissions` will be zero. Conversely, if no $PICKLEs are locked, `adjusted_emissions` will equal `emissions`. This encourages everyone to collaborate and lock for $DILL in order to reduce emissions and create positive pressure on the $PICKLE price.\n- it will be very important to accurately decide on the parameters `dill.totalSupply` and `pickle.totalSupply` the purposes of adjusted emissions (and the % of adjusted emissions going to $DILL and Farms). Auxiliary contracts may be needed to obtain these parameters precisely or the implementation may involve averaging these parameters over the course of an epoch via off-chain scripting. Implementation details left to Core team.\n\n### Part II, Section 1: 100% Revenue-sharing for $DILL\n\n- fundamental to Treasury restructuring is about building an ever more resilient protocol.\n- currently, when locking for $DILL, you are eligible for 45% of the revenues Pickle generates, distributed weekly. Ideally, that number should be 100%.\n- other revenue-focused protocols like Curve, LooksRare, and Solidly give 100% of revenues to those locking or staking the governance token, which is also the essence of ve(3,3).\n\n### Part II, Section 2: The Treasury $DILL\n\n- In order for the Treasury to maintain the current level of development in the protocol under a 100% revenue-sharing paradigm, it needs to hold a position in $DILL. However, the Treasury does not have an extensive reserve of $PICKLEs to lock since $PICKLE was fairly launched. The option to mint a reserve for the Treasury lays (and has always laid) in the hands of the community.\n- If this proposal passes, Pickle will carry a strategic mint (its very first), in order for the Treasury to control 50% of locked $PICKLEs as $DILL and thus receive 50% of the governance rewards. At present, almost 1M $PICKLEs are locked for $DILL, ergo this proposal would authorise the mint of as many $PICKLEs as will be locked for $DILL on the day the proposal passes (1M $PICKLEs in this example).\n- $PICKLEs minted under this proposal will not reach the market, instead, they will be \"perma-locked\" (max-locked and extended to max-lock periodically) in order for the Treasury to control a minimum of half of the max $DILL supply (what $DILL supply would be if everyone locked extends to max).\n- Thus, after locking for $DILL, the Treasury would receive two rewards every week: revenue-sharing rewards (say, in $ETH), and anti-dilutive rewards (say, in $PICKLE).\n- The Treasury will use its \\$ETH from revenue-sharing (the \"$DILL distributions\") to finance the Protocol's development, bounties, operations, and marketing & growth i.e. continuing business as usual as per the budget approved in PIP-44, which will continue to be deployed under the oversight of the SCCOC. The Treasury will continue to carry out weekly $CORN buybacks at the same level of revenues, and also carry out periodic $PICKLE buybacks when market conditions justify them, and either hold them in reserve or distribute them as \"special dividends\".\n- The Treasury will also receive $PICKLEs from anti-dilutive $DILL rewards, and this proposal restricts the Treasury in using these $PICKLEs for only the following authorised purposes:\n    - strategic initiatives like co-marketing, bootstrapping pool-2s of $PICKLE, seeding liquidity in CEXs, et al – any such \"strategic initiative\" will have to be approved by the SCCOC through its normal resolution procedure before the $PICKLEs can be appropriated.\n    - the Treasury may choose to build a reserve of $PICKLEs for the purposes of providing $PICKLE Grants for contributors, paying bonuses, or for building protocol-owned liquidity – any such deployment of $PICKLEs in reserve will have to be approved by the SCCOC.\n    - to re-lock in $DILL, in order to defend its share of entitlement to revenues. This will be done with the advice and consent of the SCCOC as the community may wish for the Treasury to reduce its percentage of ownership as the Protocol grows and achieves better economies of scale.\n- The Treasury may periodically sell reserve $PICKLEs on the market as options to community members by passing a Proposal for each particular \"Exit to Community\" round. The current thinking around this is to borrow a page from the CowSwap $COW options which were offered to the community first and where terms were never worse for community members than for professional investors.\n- The Treasury may divide its $DILL holdings over several wallets, in order to support differentiated locks. The Governance may vote to allow any of these locks to expire and decide on the fate of the $PICKLEs once they unlock (e.g. using them for fundraising via an \"Exit to Community\" round).\n- Over time, the Treasury will act to realise the strategic vision of Pickle which is to progressively decentralise the Protocol. For the Treasury, this means increasing the percentage of $PICKLE in the hands of community members and reducing its own entitlement to Protocol revenues by reducing its share of the $DILL supply. This progressive decentralisation will be achieved via a combination of grants, special dividends, and community fundraising rounds.\n\n## Specification\n\n- Part I:\n    - a `FeeDistributorV2` contract to be developed by the Core team, supporting two tokens as claimable rewards:\n        - $ETH (or $WETH if $ETH is unfeasible) as revenue-sharing rewards, coming from fees generated by the protocol.\n        - $PICKLE\n    - Pickle UI to change to integrate `FeeDistributorV2` dual rewards (claims of old rewards in `FeeDistributor` will still be supported).\n        - `FeeDistributor` to be \"deprecated\", claims allowed but no further $PICKLE transfers there by Governance. `FeeDistributor.kill_me()` won't be called as then claims would be disallowed and all $PICKLEs are returned to Treasury – the `emergency_return` address.\n    - `MasterChef.setPicklePerBlock(adjusted_emissions)` to be called by Governance.\n    - Core team will develop auxiliary contracts or an off-chain scripting solution to calculate the split of $PICKLE emissions between anti-dilutive rewards (sent to `FeeDistributorV2` for distribution) and the Gauge System as well as sidechain MiniChefs, giving $DILL a share according to the formula: `dill_emissions_share = dill.totalSupply/pickle.totalSupply`\n    - Core team will develop auxiliary contracts or an off-chain scripting solution to transform `emissions` into `adjusted_emissions` using the ve(3,3) formula: `adjusted_emissions = emissions * ( 1 - ( dill.totalSupply/pickle.totalSupply`\n- Part II:\n    - `PickleToken.mint(_to, _amount)` to be called by Governance via MasterChef.\n        - `_to` will be the Treasury address.\n        - `_amount` will be 100% of the number of $PICKLE locked in $DILL on the `block` this proposal passes.\n        - All $PICKLE tokens in possession of the Treasury address will then be locked directly or through a proxy contract (in order to support multiple locks) by calling `VotingEscrow.create_lock(_value, _unlock_time)` with `_value` being the total amount of each lock and `_unlock_time` 4 years.\n\n[1]: https://twitter.com/larrythecumber/status/1488466563153809408\n[2]: https://github.com/andrecronje/solidly\n\n",

      "title": "[PIP-48] (Re-Vote) Whitelisting veToken Finance",
      "content": "**author**: @jaqen\n\n---\n\n> Forum participants have decided to give veToken Finance a chance to re-vote, given additional feedback and new data since the last vote on [PIP-40](https://signal.pickle.finance/#/proposal/Qme7hBw7aQnDCdSD5sme9cYUTPu7Nyx7ge7APBKMkureKE). This Proposal has been written by Jaqen of the veToken Finance team and is a verbatim copy of the [corresponding RFC on the Forum](https://forum.pickle.finance/t/rfc-revote-whitelist-the-vetoken-finance/1411).\n\n---\n\nThis proposal is to re-vote the request to whitelist veToken Finance in Pickle’s “Whitelist” contract, allowing veToken Finance to participate in locking PICKLE permanently and provide boosted rewards to Pickle LPs.\n\nFor more details, you can read about [veToken here. ](https://vetokenfinance.medium.com/vetoken-finance-pickle-pre-launch-announcement-ef18c1ba7ead)\n\n**Abstract**\n\n* veToken Finance allows users to lock PICKLE through its own smart contracts to PICKLE’s smart contract permanently, while issuing an another token, called vetDill at a 1:1 ratio.\n* veToken Finance uses its own governance token (VET) as incentives to create liquidity between PICKLE - vetDILL so that users can sell it in the secondary market as they please.\n* veToken Finance provides a boost to PICKLE LPs without auto selling rewards, while taking a 16% performance fee from pJar users.\n  * 10% to vetDILL/PICKLE LP provider\n  * 5% to VET Stakers\n  * 1% for the harvest caller\n* veToken Finance works in a similar capacity as Convex Finance & Yearn Finance work with Curve.\n\n**Benefits to Pickle Project**\n\n* Pickle Finance revenue will be increased: Since more PICKLE has been permanently locked, PICKLE in the market is reduced – each individual pJar APY is increased – more users deposit pJAR – TVL is increased, and there is more protocol revenue for PICKLE – more PICKLE permanently locked. This feedback loop directly benefits to the Pickle founding team and Dill holders, as revenue increases.\n* Existing pJar users + new users can join the veToken finance wrapped pFarms in our dashboard and farm there to share those boosts. All TVL makes its way into Pickle, and makes the Pickle protocol more accessible and profitable for regular users. This benefits both existing DILL holders and veToken Finance.\n* Unleash more tools within the ecosystem and project in joining Pickle Finance: the contract veToken Finance has built can be used to expand the ecosystem of Pickle Finance, as other projects can build on top of our smart contract in order to initiate more innovation - such as using Pickle assets as collateral assets to create stablecoin or synthetic assets – with the reference of CRV to CVX , Yearn, IronBank to MIM, etc.\n\n## Tokenomics of VET:\n\n**Key points:**\n\n* Team token vested in 4 year schedule.\n* Investor’s token is under 1 year lockup.\n* Airdrop: The airdrop is 1% of the Total Supply to Dill holders and voters who vote yes to the whitelist. The tentative proposal is 0.3% to all the holders and 0.7% to the voters who vote yes. (vested in 10 weeks after product launch)\n* VET Functions:\n  * Vote to change VET emission rates.\n  * Participate in veToken platform governance – gauge weights only.\n  * Vote to integrate other projects which adopt voting escrow token economics.\n  * More to come.\n\n**Progress since last vote:**\n\n- Tested the smart contract, based on Larry's advice.\n- The contracts have been audited and reviewed once again.\n- Developed the main dashboard with timeliness in mind, while waiting for the next vote: https://app.vetoken.finance/\n- Refined white paper and strategy.\n\nNotes:\n\n* veToken Finance has completed it’s audit with Quillhash ([link](https://github.com/Quillhash/Audit_Reports/blob/master/veToken%20Finance%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit%20Report%20-%20QuillAudits.pdf)).\n* Whitelisting veToken Finance is supported by the Pickle core team",

      "title": "# [PIP-47] $PICKLE Token Emissions",
      "content": "**authors**: @cipio, @leekuanjew\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal is to modify the current emission schedule for the $PICKLE token.\n\n## Background \n\nPickle Token emissions are currently at 0.3 $PICKLE per block. This was voted on by [PIP-36](https://signal.pickle.finance/#/proposal/QmP5rBjrZinv9Hr8rhcZCVK2mnJeAATxhM876JitmhbP1q). As per PIP-36, the emissions of 0.3 $PICKLE per block will drop to 0.1 per block on Jan 1 2022 00:00 GMT. We wish to adjust the emissions prior to this in order to smooth out the transition period to a new emission rate.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe are proposing to modify the current emission schedule of the $PICKLE token i.e. the `picklePerBlock` parameter of our [Pickle MasterChef contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbD17B1ce622d73bD438b9E658acA5996dc394b0d#readContract) that owns our $PICKLE token. There will be two distinct details we are voting on. \n- The schedule for the decrease of emissions; and,\n- The end state of the emission parameter. \n\nFor all proposals, the emission decrease will begin on Nov 18 00:00 UTC (Dill O'clock). This emission change will affect all chains equally, meaning the [PIP-46](https://signal.pickle.finance/#/proposal/QmZa83RNg6CyL1KkE9XshWuo3kLG3Hd6M2hjj9preqia5T) ratio will remain the same (2/3rds to ETH mainnet and 1/3rd on sidechains).\n\n### Emissions decrease schedule\n\n- Decrease emissions by 25% per week, this will take a total of 4 weeks to complete. Complete on Dec 16, 2021. \n- Decrease emissions by 14.28% per week, this will take a total of 7 weeks to complete. Complete on Jan 6, 2022.\n- Decrease emissions by 12.5% per week, this will take a total of 8 weeks to complete. Complete on Jan 13, 2022.\n- Decrease emissions by 6.25% per week, this will take a total of 16 weeks to complete. Complete on March 10, 2022.\n- Do Nothing, this will result in the emission rate being set sharply on Jan 1, 2022, 00:00 GMT to the set amount determined in this PIP.\n\n### End state emissions parameter\n\n- 0.05 $PICKLE per block\n- 0.1 $PICKLE per block (currently scheduled amount).\n- 0.15 $PICKLE per block.\n- 0.2 $PICKLE per block.\n- 0.3 $PICKLE per block (no change).\n\n## Voting Method\n\nAs this proposal is non-binary, we are using Snapshot's \"ranked choice voting\" or \"instant runoff voting\" (IRV) algorithm to count the votes.\n\nYou can find a short explainer of IRV in the [Snapshot Docs](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types#ranked-choice-voting-irv). Below is a simple diagram from Wikipedia.\n\n![IRV countdown flowchart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/IRV_counting_flowchart.svg/1920px-IRV_counting_flowchart.svg.png)\n\nThe voting power is still DILL i.e. 1 DILL equals 1 vote.\n\nVoters will rank their preferred choices for the winning slate, the slate with the most votes wins.\n\n## Vote Options\n- PIP-36 schedule (emissions set to 0.1 $PICKLE per block on Jan 1 2022 00:00 GMT).\n- Stay at 0.3.\n- Reduce to 0.2 over 4 weeks.\n- Reduce to 0.2 over 7 weeks.\n- Reduce to 0.2 over 8 weeks.\n- Reduce to 0.2 over 16 weeks.\n- Reduce to 0.15 over 4 weeks.\n- Reduce to 0.15 over 7 weeks.\n- Reduce to 0.15 over 8 weeks.\n- Reduce to 0.15 over 16 weeks.\n- Reduce to 0.1 over 4 weeks.\n- Reduce to 0.1 over 7 weeks.\n- Reduce to 0.1 over 8 weeks.\n- Reduce to 0.1 over 16 weeks.\n- Reduce to 0.05 over 4 weeks.\n- Reduce to 0.05 over 7 weeks.\n- Reduce to 0.05 over 8 weeks.\n- Reduce to 0.05 over 16 weeks.",

      "content": "**authors**: @larrythecucumber, @leekuanjew\n\n---\n\n## Background\n\nPickle is committed to a multi-chain, multi-layer expansion strategy. \n\nWe are an Ethereum-native DAO and protocol, yet our community supports expansion to other chains, as evidenced in our Discord history as well as [polls like this one](https://forum.pickle.finance/t/rfc-which-chains-could-be-next-for-pickle-deployment-poll/1297), as well as Ethereum scaling solutions (aka Layer-2 solutions or \"L2s\"). So far, we have deployed to Polygon, and are ready to deploy to Arbitrum and OKExChain (OEC) pending the closing of some business matters, one of which is emissions. Previously, cross-chain emissions were explicitly supported in [PIP-36](https://signal.pickle.finance/#/proposal/QmP5rBjrZinv9Hr8rhcZCVK2mnJeAATxhM876JitmhbP1q), which also lead to a temporary increase in PICKLEs/block from 0.1 to 0.3 until EOY. Currently, we provide 0.1 PICKLEs/block to Polygon, and keep 0.2 PICKLEs/block in the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nThis Proposal is to set a new direction on how to allocate cross-chain emissions between the Ethereum mainnet and other sidechains and L2s, including Polygon, and is of particular importance to the impending launch in Arbitrum and OKExChain. Lessons have been learnt since the defeat of [PIP-43](https://signal.pickle.finance/#/proposal/QmfKzLvYTQ8f4swKLbjyN9wTAJxe8hx8Q1XCw9bp7gE7L1) where some voters were uncertain cross-chain emissions distribution would be revisited (the answer is *YES*). Moreover, the passing of [PIP-45](https://signal.pickle.finance/#/proposal/QmP7Cq2RfJkpepfUabJxRMK8BmQtYMwKpEp9YzVNHwijM2) has shown tremendous willingness by the DAO to let the Core team follow a strategic and dynamic approach to emissions distribution when it comes to pool 2s, a logic that is worth extending to cross-chain emissions. This strategic flexibility has already started to pay off as the Core team was able to negotiate with Balancer Labs a 400 $BAL / week incentive for a PICKLE-ETH Pool on Arbitrum.\n\n## Proposal\n\nFollowing a [period for public comment on the Forum](https://forum.pickle.finance/t/rfc-cross-chain-emissions-redistribution/1338/6), we have refined the most well-received and viable option in order to produce a simple binary vote, given the time-sensitive nature of developments in cross-chain incentives.\n\n**We propose to empower the Core team and the SCCOC to decide on cross-chain emissions distribution.**\n\nSimilar to how [PIP-45](https://signal.pickle.finance/#/proposal/QmP7Cq2RfJkpepfUabJxRMK8BmQtYMwKpEp9YzVNHwijM2) was passed. We propose this split between mainnet and non-mainnet farms to the DAO now:\n\n- Ethereum mainnet: 0.20 PICKLE/block\n- non-mainnet/L2s/sidechains: 0.10 PICKLE/block\n\n**Under the oversight of the SCCOC, the Core team would administer the non-mainnet portion strategically**. Should this PIP pass, the above distribution would apply. The 2/3rd mainnet portion will be distributed according to the existing Gauge system. \n\nThe Core team is committied to using the non-mainnet portion to attract quality non-mainnet TVL on the chains where it makes most sense and on the farms where it makes most sense within those chains. After this PIP, all subsequent changes in distribution would be proposed to the SCCOC, which could then approve/veto them. All resolutions by the SCCOC would be of public record and the SCCOC will have a period of public comment lasting no less than 72 hours any time it is faced with questions on cross-chain emissions distribution. Note that the SCCOC is two-thirds community-elected and subject to recall by the DAO through the use of the PIP mechanism.\n\n**We are committed to building the Gauge system so DILL vote-lockers can decide directly.** However, this process will take time.\n\nWe understand the popularity of the current Gauge as it is more decentralised and generates utility for PICKLE and DILL. However, as it was not designed for a multi-chain Crypto-verse, it is currently not applicable to non-mainnet farms. Its expansion cross-chain is a technically complex undertaking for which we are expanding our Engineering capabilities. \n\n**Note this Proposal would expand the SCCOC's Mandate**, as follows:\n- approving or rejecting any changes to cross-chain distributions;\n- overseeing the Core team to implement due diligence in proposing non-mainnet emissions distributions; and, \n- securing the resources to build out the Gauge system to include non-mainnet farming. \n\n\n## Vote\n\nThis is a binary vote. The vote is binding on the DAO.\n\n* **Proceed with Proposal**\n* **Do Nothing** - will keep emissions as-is and imply that we will launch on Arbitrum and OEC without PICKLE rewards.\n\n",

      "title": "[PIP-45] Allocating a Portion of Gauge rewards for $PICKLE Pool 2 incentives",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal is to empower the Core team to allocate $PICKLE liquidity (i.e. \"pool 2\") incentives according to strategic priorities like cross-chain launches and partnerships in both mainnet and cross-chain. \n\n\n## Background\n\nCurrently, DILL voters control the allocation for all jars/farms in the Ethereum mainnet. This allocation is based on a total of 4,000 allocPoint and the `picklePerBlock` parameter, both coming directly from MasterChef, the contract that owns the $PICKLE token. For example, one can see how DILL holders currently have voted on Gauge weights [here](https://app.pickle.finance/farms): \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KrGH05J.png)\n\nWhen originally implementing DILL, the existing \"pool 2\", the PICKLE-ETH UNIv2 LP, was added as a Gauge that DILL holders could vote on. This worked well, but started to encounter limitations as the Pickle core team entered into an agreement with Sushi to attempt to migrate that liquidity over to Sushiswap by migrating the incentives once Sushi launched their MasterChefV2 (MCv2) dual-rewards staking. As MCv2 rewards are distributed outside of our contracts, the PICKLE-ETH SLP couldn't be added directly to DILL voting. \n\nWhen the new PICKLE-ETH SLP was announced and users were invited to migrate, many answered the call. However, it was soon evident that rewards from PICKLE-ETH LP couldn't be migrated and that those who remained in the old UNI pool were earning a better rate despite not supporting the protocol's strategic priorities.\n\nAt the moment, the Pickle Core team is in advanced discussions with the Balancer team to jointly incentivise liquidity ($BAL and $PICKLE) for a Pickle launch in Arbitrum. Arbitrum is, according to at least [this poll of the community](https://forum.pickle.finance/t/rfc-which-chains-could-be-next-for-pickle-deployment-poll/1297/8), the most highly-anticipated launch amongst L2s/sidechains for the DAO. The initial response of the community to potentially our first-ever collaboration with Balancer has been highly positive. Understandably, this is because Balancer is one of the most well-regarded teams in the space, for its vision, innovation, and execution in general – and in particularly its stellar security reputation.\n\nFor this and other reasons, the idea of empowering the Team with the power to allocate $PICKLE liquidity incentives, an important piece of leverage when negotiating partnerships, has been floating around the community. We believe the time is right for the DAO to make a decision on this matter.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe are proposing that we set-aside 16% of the current allocPoint (0.15 * 4000) for $PICKLE \"pool 2\" incentives. The 15% set-aside can be re-voted on when the DAO so decides e.g. when there's future opportunity or collaboration or when the liquidity environment changes. \n\nWe have gotten a soft-commit from the Balancer team to match our PICKLE incentives, and the proposal will be voted on by the BALLERs the coming weekend. \n\nCurrent allocation:\n\n| Index | Token          | allocPoint |\n| ----- | --------       | ---------- |\n| 37    | mDILL          | 4000       |\n\nProposed allocation:\n\n| Index | Token          | allocPoint |\n| ----- | --------       | ---------- |\n| 37    | mDILL          | 3400       |\n| 39    | mPOOL2         | 600        |\n\nThe Pickle Core team may also create a new jar/strategy for the pool once we are approved on the Arbitrum token list.\n\nNote that this proposal will supersede [PIP-38](https://snapshot.org/#/pickle.eth/proposal/QmPTkZEddMLutmFbo5W132EHzjtSebMXzubbuKLo2BAb6a) so that the Team will be managing all liquidity incentives from emissions and not from Treasury (like we currently manage MCv2 in Sushiswap).",

      "content": "## Background\n\n[PIP-44](https://signal.pickle.finance/#/pickle.eth/proposal/QmesHBnQhvwyF6MMoe4JkvgxzZvVCmUxgRYpuyRFNSH6UB) was passed with overwhelming support and near-unanimous approval by the DILL DAO, Pickle's governing body. \n\nThe proposal expanded, enhanced, and empowered the **Select Committee on Continuing Operations and Compensation** into the **Standing Committee on Continuing Operations and Compensation**, constituted as follows:\n\n-    (1) Larry the Cucumber, as our CEO serving as an *ex officio* member. He shall also be the Chairperson of the Committee.\n-    (2, 3) Two members of the Core team, appointed by Larry the Cucumber.\n-    (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) Six members of the DILL DAO, whose interests do not conflict with serving in the Committee (i.e. by being part of the personnel of this DAO or an officer or staff of another DAO or DeFi protocol), to be elected by DILL holders after an internal nomination process.\n\nThis governance action is to elect the (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) seats in the committee. \n\n## Nominees by the DAO\n\nThe following Discord users have been nominated and seconded by DAO members. After accepting their nominations, they have each prepared a short paragraph on why they should be elected to serve on the committee. Each nominee is presented in the order in which their nominations were formalized.\n\n### Clintos#9235\n- Hi all! I’m a multi- business founder, Director on a couple of boards, VC/Angel Investor and DeFi Degen since DeFi Degens existed.  My companies have grown from a starting payroll of 4 to over 600 staff, including over 40 software/web developers.  Was early enough in Pickle when it was about stablecoin pegs and had to migrate and rescue funds manually in Etherscan.  Lost 20k in the pDai hack and more than that in subsequent dump and IL in suicide pool.  But despite that, believe this community is the best in DeFi, big brains, big hearts and great frens and Pickle remains one of my largest homes to keep crypto capital.  I’m always looking for opportunities for the protocol and look forward to helping Pickle hit its stretch goal this year. Thank you all for making this DAO what it is.\n\n### Scotty#0001\n- Hello m8s, my name is Scotty, and I am a recovering Pickle maximalist. I have a first-class degree in business economics and a drop-out during postgraduate research into behavioural economics. I dropped out to focus on cryptocurrency and my cryptocurrency community called Spacestation, which I created in March 2017. The community still lives on today, in fact, we have recently set up a community-led DAO-controlled treasury fund which was entirely donated by our community members, which currently sits at around $400k. A big step for me personally. And a step I would not have taken without the experience and confidence that I have gained during my time at Pickle; being around such wholesome and professional people is a great classroom. Vote for me if you want a part time therapist and a community obsessive on the SCCOC.\n\n### MadMikeHoare#0111\n- Hi! My name is Marcel Wolff and I’m running for DILLDAO because I believe PICKLE has strong potential to be the premier De-Fi protocol.\nI am currently pursuing an MBA at the Kellogg School of Management. Previously, I worked 7.5 years at the Vanguard Group, both in client service and IT product management roles. I am also a director on my undergraduate social society’s alumni board. My career experience as well as my experience on a board of directors would help the SCCOC develop an optimal process for hiring and compensating developers to make sure we can hire top talent; the abilities and vision of our developers’ are key to increasing PICKLE’s popularity and TVL. \nIf elected I would prioritize developing an industry competitive offer for new developers, processes that ensure transparency around spending, and durable governing structures for SCCOC and DILLDAO that ensure we are pursuing our fiduciary responsibilities.\n\n### Entbeard#1372\n- Hello fellow Pickle jar denizens! I have 5 years experience in IT technical support, 3 years in special needs education, and a year in high end audio sales. As you can see I have a broad spectrum of experiences, and skills that will lend themselves well to the success of Pickle Finance. I am a highly process oriented person who values above all authenticity, transparency, and truth. Many who cross my path have complimented my excellence in leadership, communication, and empathy for my fellow human beings. Pickle was my first foray into defi, and I haven’t strayed far from this wonderful community we have built together. I will endeavour to nurture, and grow the same sense of belonging, and community that I have experienced with Pickle. As my friend Cerunos has, I will also answer the call for Pickle in its hour of need!\n\n### tokani#9542\n- Hello everyone, I'm tokani. While I don't have experience with hiring or treasury management, I hope to bring an alternative perspective with a focus on Pickle's governance structure and general DAO procedures. I have spent several months over the past two years reading, researching, and theorizing about the structures of various types of governments across the world, both past and present, as well as alternative forms of governance and societal management. This research is actually what introduced the concept of a DAO to me, directly leading me to Pickle. I've stuck by Pickle through thick and thin, and am fully committed towards the success of our protocol. As such, I believe a fair, equitable, and forward-thinking governance structure is critical; not only for our success, but for the success of DeFi as the Future of Finance.\n\n## Voting Method\n\nAs this proposal is non-binary, we are using Snapshot's \"ranked choice voting\" or \"instant runoff voting\" (IRV) algorithm to count the votes.\n\nYou can find a [short explainer of IRV in the Snapshot Docs](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types#ranked-choice-voting-irv).

The canonical version with Background and Rationale sections can be found in our Forum. We strongly urge all DAO members to read the full text before casting their votes.\n> [(full PIP-44 text)](https://forum.pickle.finance/t/rfc-expand-and-enhance-sccoc-and-empower-it-to-close-staffing-gaps/1303)\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to give our protocol the means to grow further, by seeking to:\n- Expand, Enhance, and Empower the Select Committee on Continuing Operations and Compensation (SCCOC).\n    - Expand: from a 7-member body with minority DAO-elected membership to a 9-member body that's majority DAO-elected.\n    - Enhance: into a \"standing committee\" i.e. a committee with a permanent mandate and a rotating membership.\n    - Empower: from a narrow set of discrete mandates to holding the \"power of the purse\" when it comes to all personnel matters of the DAO, including the Core team.\n- Authorise the appropriation of a budget of $2.5M to the SCCOC, until 1-Sep-2022.\n- Call for a by-election for the additional DAO-elected membership to the SCCOC.\n\n## Proposal\n\nThis proposal is to **Empower**, **Expand**, and **Enhance** SCCOC, established by [PIP-39][39], as follows:\n\n### Empower the SCCOC with the \"power of the purse\" - $2.5M/year\nEmpower the SCCOC with **discretionary contributor spending powers** (e.g. funding of Core team, Periphery squads, contractors, marketing, event organization/sponsorship).\n\n-  the permanent mandate of the SCCOC will be \"**to ensure the availability of a competitive and willing pool of talent to run and contribute to the DAO**\". This includes but is not limited to:\n    -  administering the talent management Budget of the DAO; apportioning it between Core, Periphery, and Other categories of contributors; and overseeing recruitment for these roles\n    -  setting standards for compensation plans and packages, including tiers, titles, and salary bands for contributors\n    -  setting hiring, retention, and firing processes for core contributors as well as rules for the procurement and engagement of non-permanent contributors.\n    -  investigating all matters relating to human resource management as well as auditing the Treasury in order to carry out its reporting duties.\n    -  as the \"power of the purse\" originates from the DAO, the DAO will retain power, via the PIP mechanism, to appropriate funds and earmark them to/from the SCCOC.\n-  the SCCOC will also have the duty to report to the community at regular intervals (quarterly, at minimum) on the state and progress of matters under its mandate. For this purpose, it will elect a Secretary from amongst its community-elected members who will be responsible to collect and publish the SCCOC's official reports.\n    -  as the SCCOC will, in the discharge of its mandate, engage in some form of administrative rulemaking for the DAO, a \"comment period\" shall be required before each rule is adopted where DAO members shall be able to give their input for the SCCOC's consideration. The comment period shall not be less than 3 days unless the SCCOC unanimously approves otherwise for exceptional circumstances.\n-  an **inaugural budget of $2.5M** is requested for the inaugural term i.e. until 1-Sep-2022.\n\n### Expand the SCCOC to a majority of DAO-elected members\n\nSCCOC is currently a 7-seat body (current members listed above).\n - **SCCOC to become a 9-seat collegiate body:**\n   -  3 Core team members \n      - Larry and 2 other Core team members, appointed by Larry.\n    -  6 DAO-elected members\n        -  3 already-elected by the DAO: @merpenduous, @cerunos, and @cipio.\n        -  3 additional members from the DAO, to be elected in a special by-election, following an internal nominating process.\n            \n### Enhance the SCCOC to \"standing committee\" status \n\nSCCOC will be a permanent organ of the DILL DAO, with rotating membership but a perpetual mandate.\n-  DAO-elected SCCOC members to have a **term of 1 year**.\n    -  Term for those elected will end on 1-Sep-2022.\n        -  There are no term limits, members can stand for Nomination again.\n        -  Nominations will run from 1-Jul-2022 to 15-Jul every year.\n        -  Election Day will be 1-Aug every year.\n        -  Winners will assume their seats for the new term on 1-Sep when the handover will take place.\n-  Whenever members cannot serve for their whole terms, a by-election will occur within 1 month of the resignation or removal of an existing member. Winners serve the remainder of the term.\n-  Elected members of the SCCOC can be **removed** as follows:\n    -  due to **inactivity**, no elected member of the SCCOC may exhibit high levels of absenteeism or dereliction of duty. A motion can be passed by the SCCOC to remove the member in question.\n    -  due to a **conflict of interest**, no elected member of the SCCOC may be involved in an official capacity in the running or governance of another protocol. A motion can be passed by the SCCOC to remove the member in question.\n    -  due to **special circumstances**, at the discretion of the DAO. Using the PIP mechanism, a motion of censorship shall go into effect immediately and remove the member(s) in question if it passes as a PIP, according to regular rules of governance at the time.\n\n## Vote\n\nThis is a binary vote. The option that wins a simple majority of the casted votes will be implemented by the DAO.\n\n- **For**: \"Proceed with Proposal\"\n- **Against**: \"Do Nothing\"\n\nThank you for reading and your participation. And as always...\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/pickle/original/1X/74c5d81e54ba3c225f6add802ef68ac1330ce012.png)\n\n[20]: https://signal.pickle.finance/#/pickle.eth/proposal/QmeYT7oNQfVK7TxzGnD3c5TRhGJ2HjbWYJjhirUtAWhSfG\n\n[22]: https://signal.pickle.finance/#/pickle.eth/proposal/Qmf5bSoNqGXzdnSLnr96eUBtUsFbZxDh4aA9Zrhx31GV49\n\n[39]: https://signal.pickle.finance/#/pickle.eth/proposal/QmaAVGJtNuDHMrbWu5B4bNfiGvi9bV3i4uHuACXu17wn3L\n\n[41]: https://signal.pickle.finance/#/pickle.eth/proposal/QmQ6Zze6cNWCXBWD7U7casnJrKZBr5H9QgXnp1Dd1Mgmyg",

      "content": "**author**: @leekuanjew\n\n---\n\n## Abstract\n\nPickle is preparing to launch on OKExChain (OEC) very shortly.\n\nAs a reinforcement to Pickle's multi-chain, multi-layer (MCML) expansion strategy, [PIP-36](https://signal.pickle.finance/#/pickle.eth/proposal/QmP5rBjrZinv9Hr8rhcZCVK2mnJeAATxhM876JitmhbP1q) approved a temporary increase to the PICKLE emissions to 0.30 PICKLEs/block (using the Ethereum mainnet's blocktime) until the end of the year. These incentives have so far been split as 0.20 PICKLEs/block on mainnet, and 0.10 PICKLEs/block on Polygon.\n\nThe proposal authorised the Pickle multi-sig in coordination with the core team to distribute PICKLEs across Ethereum and Polygon farms as it saw fit in consultation and transparent communication with the community. Now, as the possibility of OEC farms draws closer, the stewards of the PICKLE emissions distribution look again to the community for guidance on how to split the PICKLE pie.\n\n## Proposals\n\nThe following options are being given for the community to rank.\n\n### Proposal A\n\nFor those who believe the main attraction is still mainnet, where 80% of our TVL currently resides, and where 90% of DeFi TVL is still based. The following split is suggested:\n\n- Ethereum mainnet: 0.20 PICKLE/block\n- Polygon: 0.05 PICKLE/block\n- OKExChain: 0.05 PICKLE/block\n\n### Proposal B\n\nFor those who believe that most opportunities lay at the frontiers, where most users who haven't tasted the benefits of Pickle and yield maximising are. The following split is suggested:\n\n- Ethereum mainnet: 0.15 PICKLE/block\n- Polygon: 0.075 PICKLE/block\n- OKExChain: 0.075 PICKLE/block\n\n### Proposal C\n\nFor those who are excited about the new opportunities but have a bias towards the environments with the most traction. The following split is suggested:\n- Ethereum mainnet: 0.175 PICKLE/block\n- Polygon: 0.075 PICKLE/block\n- OKExChain: 0.05 PICKLE/block\n\n## Vote\n\nAs this proposal is non-binary, we are using Snapshot's \"ranked choice voting\" or \"instant runoff voting\" algorithm to count the votes. This is a form of preferential voting, which helps reduce tactical voting or \"wasted votes\" by allowing voters to indicate what to do with their votes should their first-choices not win outright.\n\nAccording to the Snapshot docs, it works as follows:\n\n> Each voter may rank any number of choices. Votes are initially counted for each voter's top choice. If a candidate has more than half of the vote based on first-choices, that choice wins. If not, then the choice with the fewest votes is eliminated. The voters who selected the defeated choice as a first choice then have their votes added to the totals of their next choice. This process continues until a choice has more than half of the votes. When the field is reduced to two, it has become an \"instant runoff\" that allows a comparison of the top two choice head-to-head.\n\nAnd this is a diagram from Wikipedia:\n\n![IRV counting flowchart](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/IRV_counting_flowchart.svg/1920px-IRV_counting_flowchart.svg.png)\n\nThe voting power is still DILL i.e. 1 DILL equals 1 vote. \n\nIf \"Do Nothing\" wins, there will be no emissions directed to OEC.",

      "title": "[PIP-41] Team Proposal: Fennec (aka \"Peckish Painter with Pale Pallor Patiently Procrastinates Pending Prophesized Payout\")",
      "content": "**author**: @leekuanjew\n\n---\n\n## Background\n\nMany in the Pickle community and beyond are familiar with [@fennec](https://twitter.com/fennec_nft) and his work for the DAO. In the past few months, Fennec has been involved in the following efforts:\n- creating unique art and NFTs for Pickle promotions including major jar launches, collaborations, and special occasions.\n- creating visual collateral for announcements, tweets, and articles.\n- creating illustrations, icons, and decorative elements for our rebranded UI. \n\nMost of these can be appreciated at the [Pickled NFTs](https://opensea.io/collection/pickles) collection in OpenSea.\n\nMoreover, Fennec has been actively involved as a community member at Pickle, sharing his thoughts on digital art, NFTs, and design as well as engaging in support, encouragement, and promotion of Pickle and its products. In his public interactions as well as his creations, Fennec has shown a highly positive spirit and a truly green heart in inspiring amounts, making for great atmosphere in all community channels where he has participated.\n\nFennec was originally engaged as a contractor, and as our briefs to him got more frequent, he kindly agreed to a modest retainer fee which was paid out of marketing and promotional expenses. As is common with many artistic engagements in the NFT world, Fennec and Pickle also agreed to split the proceeds of the sale of Pickled NFTs with Pickle receiving the initial lump-sum payment for each NFT sold while Fennec receives a 10% royalty on each subsequent re-sale. This agreement, originally intended as a 3-month trial, has been ongoing for over 6 months.\n\n**This is a draft proposal to formalise the role of Fennec as a core team member.**\n\n## Proposal\n\nIf submitted to a vote and passed, this proposal will give an additional, special mandate to the recently established “Select Committee on Continuing Operations and Compensation” (approved in [PIP-39](https://signal.pickle.finance/#/pickle.eth/proposal/QmaAVGJtNuDHMrbWu5B4bNfiGvi9bV3i4uHuACXu17wn3L)) to review the current agreement between Pickle and Fennec, and approve a compensation package for Fennec that is commensurate with his expected contributions to the protocol going forward and is market-based and appropriate for our industry in general and protocol more specifically.\n\nFennec is now a well-regarded NFT artist, highly productive, and also dabbles effectively in other areas of graphic artistry and even UI design. I admit unremorsefully to relying on Fennec's NFTs to close collaboration partnerships – a very effective hook. This is only expected to increase in frequency as Pickle expands its marketing and business developments efforts going forward.\n\nFinally, it is important for our core team to have predictability in its talent resources. Fennec would not lack for opportunities if either party were to discontinue the existing engagement. However, it is the team's opinion that letting this happen would be to our protocol's detriment.\n\n## Addendum\n\nThe Select Committee on Continuing Operations and Compensation has a condition that Larry the Cucumber may not vote on any salary, bonus, or any other compensation to be paid to Larry the Cucumber. This condition shall be extended and construed such that members of the Committee may not vote on any salary, bonus, or any other compensation to be paid to their own selves.\n",

Accordingly, this staking mechanism provides better capital efficiency, and better balance between liquidity providers and stakers.\n\nIn the meantime, VETOKEN’s long term holders are permitted to vote for protocol parameters, such as gauge weights (a la Curve) and Farm Weights (a la Pickle), as well as any other governance voting.\n\nThere will be an airdrop for DILL holders and white-list voters , though specific amount need to be finalized.\n\nMore details and discussion at: \na) https://vetokenfinance.medium.com/83cd4ddfdfcc\nb) https://forum.pickle.finance/t/request-for-feedback-to-whitelist-vetoken-finance-on-dill-contract/1231/5\nc) Smart contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x05A7Ebd3b20A2b0742FdFDe8BA79F6D22Ea9C351#writeContract\n",

He shall also be the presiding officer unless the Committee decides otherwise.\n-    (2) Jintao, a past committee member and multi-sig signer who is on retainer for our critical infrastructure but is not a salaried worker, shall be a member for his experience with both development and compensation in DeFi\n-    (3, 4) Two members to be appointed by Larry the Cucumber, so long as they are not a subject of the current review, at least one of which must have experience with hiring and compensation in DeFi\n-    (5, 6, 7) Three DillDao members to be be selected by a Discord vote of the DillDao, which shall last at least 30 hours for the nominating process and 30 additional hours for voting. The beginning and ends of both the nominating process and the election shall be posted in #Announcements and #DillDao to allow for the broadest possible participation.\n\nFor the candidates to the (5, 6. 7) seats specified in `PIP-39`, the nominating process was carried through Discord where DAO members are verified. A total of six nominees formalised their candidacies for this by-election.\n\nThis governance action is to elect the (5, 6, 7) seats in the committee. \n\n## Nominees by the DAO\n\nThe following Discord users have been nominated and seconded by DAO members. After accepting their nominations, they have each prepared a short paragraph on why they should be elected to serve on the committee. Each nominee is presented in the order in which their nominations were formalized.\n\n### Cerunos#0001\n- Dear fellow Pickle friends, I have experience in management, many different committee, ethics, payroll and dev environment. I was first a lawyer in tax / corporate law. After that I studied finance before becoming a wealth manager. I've been a crypto “early” investor since 2017. The last 4 yeasr I have created a Family Office in “traditional” finance, participated in creating and managing an IT company and am currently building a third entity specialized in digitals assets investment in Switzerland. My employees and associates say I’m attentive to others' positions and fair in my decisions. Integrity, fairness, and transparency are my motto in life. Pickle is my main investment in Crypto nowadays, and also the best community I have ever been part of. That’s why I will do my utmost to make it grow well into the future. When Pickle brothers are calling to arms, we can’t ignore the warcry!\n\n### Clintos#9235\n- Hi all! I’m a multi- business founder, Director on a couple of boards, VC/Angel Investor and DeFi Degen since DeFi Degens existed.  My companies have grown from a starting payroll of 4 to over 600 staff, including over 40 software/web developers.  Was early enough in Pickle when it was about stablecoin pegs and had to migrate and rescue funds manually in Etherscan.  Lost 20k in the pDai hack and more than that in subsequent dump and IL in suicide pool.  But despite that, believe this community is the best in DeFi, big brains, big hearts and great frens and Pickle remains one of my largest homes to keep crypto capital.  I’m always looking for opportunities for the protocol and look forward to helping Pickle hit its stretch goal this year. Thank you all for making this DAO what it is.\n\n### bwar#8815\n- Hi. I'm Bwar. I write code for a living, but not this kind of code. I've never hired anyone and have no experience in management or hiring. But I am not ignorant of typical wages in software development. I've re-organized several weekly meetings in my day job with more efficient agendas, tend to keep people on topic while still respecting the need for people more knowledgable than myself to take the lead when we dive into the details, and have been told I'm pretty good at it. I have a strong love for the protocol, have made code changes in two of the Repos, and rewrote the docs (they're Live, by the way, thanks @Sevenz!). My main goal is to ensure the committee gets all the information they need to make a decision, with as little interruption to the devs' business as is reasonably possible.\n\n### Merpenduous#6044\n- Hi all!  I work for a giant tech company as a middle manager in a semi-technical group.  I have under 20 people that report to me currently.  The size of my company is such that I don't engage on the payroll/hr side of things, but have a massive wealth of templates from which to draw. I've flipped some of our job descriptions to match Pickle, and could get a sense for software developer salary at any level in virtually any country.  I'm all-in on Pickle, like crazy all-in; when I was nearing liquidation I kept Pickle and let my Chainlink go.  I tend to think outside the box A LOT, mostly because I'm not certain where the box is.  My oldest son's nickname was Pickle a decade ago (which drew me to Pickle in the first place), and I have a Larry the Cucumber t-shirt!\n\n### Cipio#4528\n- Hey Everyone! I have been investing in crypto since summer of 2017. I am a software engineer and integrator for real time systems. I do not have a lot of experience with management or payroll, but I do working with extremely talented engineers. I am also a huge fan of Pickle and will do whatever it takes to make sure the protocol is successful. I believe in a strong compensation package which would include a solid base pay, and a bonus structure that scales based on the individuals performance and how successful the team is at hitting specific financial goals. Honestly all the people up for election are amazing. Any subset of the people running will do a phenomenal job! Make sure to vote! Let’s go Pickle!\n\n### Wunderbernd#3514\n- Hello, I am Wunderbernd and I study Business Informatics, so I have a little bit of knowledge in Computer Science, Digitalisation and Economics. I am in crypto since the summer last year, I mainly invested in stocks and traditional investment products before, but the more I learned about the crypto space, the more passionate I became and I increased my exposure. Pickle is one of my biggest positions, because it fits the traditional investment approach (low p/e ratio, growth, disrupting industry etc.). I lack the experience of the others, but my passion for crypto and the space might exceed theirs. In the crypto space you don't have to know all the things, you need to put in the work. My main goal is to bring this protocol forward and work out a compensation structure that is fair and competitive, but also incentivizes good and hard work for the protocol.\n\n## Voting Method\n\nFor this by-election, we will be using the **approval voting** method. On the relevant snapshot, each DILL holder can give as many approvals as there are options to choose from (i.e. 6 in this case). Each approval vote carries the full weight of the DILL holder's balance. The 3 members with the highest approval will be elected to the Select Committee. In order to make the election competitive, we suggest you make your vote count by approving 5 or less candidates – ideally, 3.",

      "content": "author: **@bwar**\n\n---\n\n## Abstract\n\nThree team members contracts will expire imminently. Other reviews required in the coming months. A committee needs to be appointed to review and extend their contracts. The committee may also standardize compensation packages. \n\n### About myself\n\nI’m a Dill member, have an interest in DeFi, and aped my money into this protocol and don’t want it to die.\n\n## Background\n\nIt’s my understanding that several paid team members have their contracts expiring in less than a week (4 days?). These members include LeeKuanJew, Chimaera, and 0xAnon. In addition to these three, I believe Brine-Master Larry’s PICKLE grants, which vested over a six month period and were expected to be reviewed six months later, will expire next month as well.\n\nThe DAO has not approved, nor even been requested to look at, a proposal for budget to extend these contracts. The team seems to be super busy developing new jars, expanding partnerships, and continuing the business of Pickle.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, there’s a clear conflict of interests in the Dev team proposing their own salaries in a PIP for the DAO to rubber-stamp. Our DAO has an absurdly high acceptance rate on proposals, at one hundred percent. The Devs could propose almost any number and surely find the votes somewhere to approve the salaries.\n\nPrevious salary negotiations were run by committees of protocol-friendly actors, which is a good thing in general. However, many of those members of previous committees have not remained active in the protocol. Even worse, several of those committee members are the very people up for review and cannot realistically vote on the salary or compensation of their team members or their boss.\n\n### Previous committee members\n\nPIP-31 (Larry’s compensation) was “put together with the help of the Pickle team and the assistance of multi-sig member Mah_Dills”\n\nPIP-34 (Expand Core Team Budget) was run by: “A hiring committee consisting of the Pickle core team (Larry_Cucumber, 0xkoffee, unlocker, purplezky, leekuanjew, chimaera, anoniminis), independent multi-sig members (jintao, Mah_Dills), and Brinery members (Rooster_Cogburn77, sifu, yyctrader)”\n\n## Proposal\n\nI hereby propose a “Select Committee on Continuing Operations and Compensation” be appointed in the following manner:\n\n-    (1) Larry the Cucumber, as grand maestro of this operation with an undeniable track record, shall be a member. He shall also be the presiding officer unless the Committee decides otherwise.\n-    (2) Jintao, a past committee member and multi-sig signer who is on retainer for our critical infrastructure but is not a salaried worker, shall be a member for his experience with both development and compensation in DeFi\n -   (3, 4) Two members to be appointed by Larry the Cucumber, so long as they are not a subject of the current review, at least one of which must have experience with hiring and compensation in DeFi\n -   (5, 6, 7) Three DillDao members to be be selected by a Discord vote of the DillDao, which shall last at least 30 hours for the nominating process and 30 additional hours for voting. The beginning and ends of both the nominating process and the election shall be posted in #Announcements and #DillDao to allow for the broadest possible participation. \n\nThe Mandate of the Committee shall be first and foremost to guarantee, to the best of the committee’s ability, the continuing operations of the protocol by quickly and efficiently analyzing the current contracts and all other submitted information, and then proposing a compensation plan specific to those requiring extensions to their contracts.\n\nThe Secondary Mandate of the Committee, once the first Mandate has been accomplished, will be to standardize the compensation plans for our protocol more generally, to better ensure tiers, titles, and salary bands, and hiring and firing processes, that are appropriate for the industry and our protocol more specifically.\n\n### Conditions\n\n -   Larry the Cucumber may not vote on any salary, bonus, or other compensation to be paid to Larry the Cucumber.\n\nI further propose we immediately extend, for one month, the contracts of LeeKuanJew, Chimaera, and 0xAnon, in order to allow for continuity while the committee does its work.",

Under the terms of this swap, Pickle receives $SUSHI, and SushiSwap receives $PICKLE.\n\n### What We'd Get\n\n$SUSHI has proposed giving us 40,000 $SUSHI at a generous discount. We would hold these tokens for at least a year, however, it is perfectly fine for our Treasury to deposit them as `xSUSHI` or borrow other assets against them on a lending protocol.\n\n### What We'd Give\n\nTo express our gratitude for this kind gesture, the Pickle team has agreed to propose to its governance the migration of the PICKLE-ETH liquidity incentives to MasterChefV2 in SushiSwap, where $PICKLE rewards will continue in addition to $SUSHI rewards for LPs.\n\nWe will also be giving $300,000 worth of $PICKLE tokens to the Sushi treasury at the spot price, which they will also hold for at least a year. Pickle plans to source its $300,000 worth of $PICKLE from its Smart Treasury, which currently holds 28,300 $PICKLEs (worth ~$350k at today’s price). \n\nSurely, the impact to the Smart Treasury will be felt in the short term. However, since the Smart Treasury exists to benefit the development of Pickle and its ecosystem, we feel this is an appropriate use of these funds.\n\n### Replenishing the Smart Treasury\n\nOver time, the Smart Treasury would be replenished with $PICKLEs via $ETH deposits that the Treasury is currently in the process of accumulating. Those $ETH deposits are being procured with Treasury revenues, which currently hovers above 6 figures weekly.\n\n## The Vote\n\nWe invite members of the DILL DAO to give their \"aye\" or \"nay\" on this proposal. As proposers, the team believes a vote to approve would serve to cement our partnership with SushiSwap, which is ultimately in the best long-term interest of Pickle and its community.",

      "title": "Increase $PICKLE incentives for Growth and launching on Polygon ",
      "content": "**author**: @anoniminis, @leekuanjew\n\n## Summary\n\nTo increase $PICKLE emissions temporarily to accelerate Growth, by encouraging yield farming at the lowest possible cost. This coincides with our launch on the Polygon network.\n\n## Background\n\nPickle Finance has had an incredible few weeks with the launch of DILL, new partnerships, and new farms on Ethereum. Now, the core team wants to embark on the L2 journey and seeks to create new opportunities for yield farmers on Polygon, as well as increase our market share in Ethereum. The decision to go with Polygon should not come as a surprise since Aave, Curve, and Sushi are already there, expanding their multi-chain visions. Moreover, partners like ComethSwap, who have previously collaborated with Pickle to great success, will be joining us for the L2 ride. \n\nPickle also wants to accelerate its growth on the Ethereum network. After reaching $100M in TVL, we want to aim for the stars and add even more farms while offering a competitive rate to depositors who choose Pickle.\n\nIn Polygon, we are looking to capture at least 50% of our current TVL with the combined incentives from $PICKLE, $MUST and $MATIC, and our novel folding strategy in Aave. Overall, we aim for our end-of-year TVL to reach the ambitious figure of $1B – EOY1B.\n\n### The Case for Increased Emissions\n\nOur experience as an emissions-based yield aggregator contrasts with a number of other protocols that have used increases in emissions to stimulate demand. That is because, since its inception, Pickle has constantly decreased or maintained fixed incentives. This is the first time an outright increase in emissions is being formally proposed to the Pickle community.\n\nTake the case of the yAxis protocol, for example. The team at yAxis was able to successfully promote an increase in emissions and drove the total value locked as deposits in the protocol from $3M in late April to $150M now, an incredible 50x return in deposits in less than 30 days. Thanks to its massive increase in TVL, the yAxis Treasury is now predicted to generate $7.5M annually from fees.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fwDX5R8.png)\n\nTo avoid the dilutive effects and encourage more $PICKLE to be locked for DILL, one option would be to allocate a percentage of the emissions increase to DILL lockers alongside the incentivization of strategies across multiple chains. The exact allocation of the distribution between DILL, Ethereum farms, and Polygon farms will be decided by the multi-sig in consultation with the core team from time to time for the duration of this expansion programme based on Pickle's strategic objectives and will be transparently communicated to the community via announcements well in advance of any changes.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe are proposing to increase the $PICKLE emission per block from 0.1 $PICKLE per block currently to:\n- (a) 0.20 $PICKLE per block; or,\n- (b) 0.30 $PICKLE per block.\n\nPickle will charge 20% performance fees on Polygon, the same as it currently does on the Ethereum network. \n\nUnder this proposal, an increased $PICKLE per block will run temporarily, until 31 December 2021 at 2359 GMT. Thereafter, the $PICKLE per block shall return to 0.10 or to whatever schedule a new governance proposal decides.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8GiOlkN.png)\n\nDue to the temporary nature of the increases, the impact on total supply is limited to, at most, less than 300,000 additional $PICKLEs compared to the current emissions schedule. \n\n\n## For\n\n- (a) 0.20 $PICKLE per block\n- (b) 0.30 $PICKLE per block\n\n**<u>Note</u>: a vote for either (a) or (b) will be counted as a vote to increase emissions. Should the sum of (a) and (b) beat option (c\\) (\"Do nothing\"), then the option with the largest share of votes will be used as the new PICKLE per block.**\n\n## Against\n\n- (c\\) Do nothing \n\n**<u>Note</u>: a vote for (c\\) will leave the emissions unchanged to 0.10 $PICKLE per block, should votes here beat the sum of votes to (a) and (b) combined.**",

These jars are the result of important collaborations between Pickle and other protocol developers and we shall announce additional rewards and incentives as they are finalized.\n\nThe launched strategies are:\n\n1. pUNITSLA (mTSLA-UST LP)\n1. pUNIAAPL (mAAPL-UST LP)\n1. pUNIQQQ (mQQQ-UST LP)\n1. pUNISLV (mSLV-UST LP)\n1. pUNIBABA (mBABA-UST LP)\n1. pSUSHI (SUSHI-ETH SLP)\n\nand the upcoming strategies are:\n1. alUSD3CRV\n1. pSUSHIALCX (ALCX-ETH SLP)\n1. pUNITRIBE (FEI-TRIBE LP)\n\nIn order to give these jars the best push to bring in new users to Pickle, we want to reallocate emissions to the jars.\n\nCurrently, this is the allocation of $PICKLE rewards (rounded).\n\nPICKLE/ETH: 62.5%\np3CRV: 2.083%\npSUSHIDAI (ETH/DAI SLP): 3.125%\npSUSHIUSDC (ETH/USDC SLP): 2.083%\npSUSHIUSDT (ETH/USDT SLP): 2.083%\npSUSHIWBTC (ETH/WBTC SLP): 2.083%\npSUSHIYFI (ETH/YFI SLP): 3.125%\npUNIBAC (BAC/DAI LP): 4.167%\npstETHcrv: 4.167%\npSUSHIyveCRV (ETH/yveCRV SLP): 6.25%\npUNIBASv2 (BAS/DAI LP): 4.167%\npUNIMIR (MIR/UST LP): 4.167%\n\n\n## Proposal\n\nThe Pickle core team requests the approval of the following allocation of $PICKLE rewards:\n\nPICKLE/ETH: 50%\np3CRV: 3%\npSUSHIDAI (ETH/DAI SLP): 1%\npSUSHIUSDC (ETH/USDC SLP): 1%\npSUSHIUSDT (ETH/USDT SLP): 1%\npSUSHIWBTC (ETH/WBTC SLP): 1%\npSUSHIYFI (ETH/YFI SLP): 1%\npUNIBAC (BAC/DAI LP): 6%\npstETHcrv: 1%\npSUSHIyveCRV (ETH/yveCRV SLP): 6%\npUNIBASv2 (BAS/DAI LP): 3%\npUNIMIR (MIR/UST LP): 5%\npUNITSLA (mTSLA-UST LP): 1%\npUNIAAPL (mAAPL-UST LP): 1%\npUNIQQQ (mQQQ-UST LP): 1%\npUNISLV (mSLV-UST LP): 1%\npUNIBABA (mBABA-UST LP): 1%\npSUSHI (SUSHI-ETH SLP): 1%\npalUSD3CRV: 5%\npSUSHIALCX (ALCX-ETH LP): 5%\npUNITRIBE (FEI-TRIBE LP): 5%\n\n\n### Rationale\n\nAt present, a number of pools with very high liquidity and rewards are sustaining themselves whereas more established pools have de-risked considerably with the influx of more conservative capital to DeFi. \n\nWe feel that Pickle Finance's future success rests in its ability to form a community that prides itself in developing close partnerships with strong teams and protocols that are pushing the boundaries of DeFi. We have identified and worked closely with 3 such protocols in Q1-2021:\n- **Basis**, the first protocol to implement the seignorage share model for next-gen stablecoins. Pickle is a strategic partner to the peg-stabilization mechanism in BasisCash v2.\n- **Terra**, a cross-chain pioneer and the team behind Mirror, a strong challenger to Synthetix, and the newer Anchor protocol for fixed stablecoin yield. Terra and Pickle are currently working on a co-promotion and will be hashing more strategies together in the near future.\n- **Alchemix**, the self-paying loan protocol, whose co-founder was once a Pickle mod and for whom we have developed a unique *symbiotic strategy* in order to cement the partnership. As a consumer of yield farming services, Alchemix is a great match for Pickle's value proposition.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, Pickle served the strong appetite for well-executed \"degen\" jars in new protocols like Basis, a strategy that gave a much-needed boost to our coffers. With the upcoming launch of DILL, we want to continue the focus on the bottom-line and instil that ethos in the first batch of DILL holders. Note that the above protocols hold $1B in available liquidity that is serviceable with our current and soon-to-launch jars. A successful launch of these jars should lead to a manifold increase in our protocol revenues (i.e. more buybacks, more revenue-sharing, more resources for growth). If we add FEI-TRIBE into the mix (a momentum play), that number grows to $1.5B. \n\nIn order to do this, and do it in a timely manner, we kindly ask the current Pickle voters, the PICKLE-ETH LPs, to wholeheartedly support this proposal. In order to complete the Pickle version of [the cryptoeconomic circle][1], we need to make some tough choices like slashing jars that have lost momentum to launch new ones as well as decreasing incentives to LPs in order to free them to increase meaningful usage of the protocol (i.e. bringing in new revenues). Naturally, this involves compromises between the short-term interests of individual governance voters (currently, the LPs) and the long-term interests of the protocol and all PICKLE holders.\n\n[1]: https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2019/1/5/the-cryptoeconomic-circle",

The core team, having worked together in the development of DILL as well as releases of new jars, has thus identified a gap in its engineering capacity and would like to fill it by onboarding an additional smart contract developer.\n\n### Proposal\n\nEquivalent to previous engineering packages, the Pickle core team requests approval for a budget of $156k ($120k from the stablecoin reserve and $36k in $PICKLEs from the Smart Treasury) in order to fund the hire for a year.\n\n### Hiring Process\n\n-    A call for candidates will be posted on this forum, Pickle's Discord and social media, and other relevant channels.\n-    A hiring committee consisting of the Pickle core team (@Larry_Cucumber, @0xkoffee, @Unlock_Target, @purplezky, @leekuanjew, @chimaera, @anoniminis), independent multi-sig members (@jintao, @Mah_Dills), and Brinery members (@Rooster_Cogburn77, @sifu, @yyctrader) shall assemble to evaluate candidacies and conduct interviews.\n-    The hiring committee shall deliberate internally and come to a decision according to its own procedures. Any selected candidate(s) shall be extended an offer by a member of the hiring committee. \n\nThe job advertisement, below.\n\n---\n\n# In search of: Solidity/Vyper Smart Contract Developer\n\nPickle is a yield aggregator and automated yield farming protocol on Ethereum. In its short 6 months of existence, it has gone from an elastic stablecoin farming experiment to a Yearn ecosystem member with projected revenues exceeding $6M/year. \n\nWe are one of the smallest yet most daring teams in the DeFi space. We take pride in developing and releasing novel strategies for yield farming vaults, and in creating deep partnerships with the protocols and teams pushing the boundaries of this new and open financial system that is being built on sound, programmable money. We follow best-in-class security procedures, yet retain our \"degen\" instincts intact.\n\nWe are looking for a driven and enthusiastic smart contract developer to help us bring about the next evolution of Pickle Finance. With the aid of the Pickle core team, you will design, develop, and test the strategies and yield-generating products that will delight the growing Pickle userbase. Kudos if you are also willing and able to help contribute to our frontend, analytics, or process automation development.\n\n## Role and Responsibilities\n\n-    Design, test, and implement new yield farming strategies and tests\n-    Design, test, and implement peripheral contracts for Pickle jars\n-    Design, test, and implement peripheral mechanisms to the Pickle protocol, including governance\n\n## Must-haves\n\n-    1-3 years of experience with Solidity or Vyper, including deep familiarity with the Ethereum development stack (e.g. Hardhat, Ethers, The Graph)\n-    A deep understanding of the Ethereum Virtual Machine\n-    Prior experience deploying smart contract systems in Ethereum\n-    Deep familiarity with the foundational principles of software architecture, design patterns, test-driven development, data-driven programming, and development in an Agile environment \n-    A collaborative, can-do attitude, and a deep appreciation of the [Scrum values][1]\n\n## Nice-to-haves\n\n-    Formal training in maths, physics, computer science, computer engineering, or electrical engineering (Degree level or above)\n-    Prior experience as a developer in DeFi, particularly in yield farming applications\n-    Prior experience deploying smart contracts to non-Ethereum EVM implementations (Fantom, Binance Smart Chain, xDai)\n-    Familiarity with React, Next, and TypeScript\n-    Pickle connoisseur 🥒\n\nPickle welcomes all qualified candidates to apply. Whether you are public or pseudonymous, please provide ample evidence of relevant work and experience for consideration.\n\nCandidates with experience and credentials well in excess of requirements will immediately be considered for a more senior role e.g. Delivery Lead, Development Lead, Solutions Architect. Conversely, candidates with lesser experience or time availability may be considered for a more junior or part-time role.\n\nTotal compensation for this role will be **$156,000/year**, as follows:\n-    A *base salary* of $120k/year, which will be deposited in an interest-bearing stablecoin (i.e. `aDAI`) and streamed over [Sablier][2].\n-    A *vested tokens* component valued at $36k/year on the date of hire. An equivalent amount of `PICKLE` tokens (according to the day's low price in CoinGecko) will be earmarked from the Smart Treasury and streamed over [Sablier][2] after a 3-month cliff.\n-    All other benefits and bonuses available to core team members, which will be extended to new hires upon completing a 3-month probation.\n\n[1]: https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#scrum-values\n[2]: https://sablier.finance/",

      "content": "## Abstract\nThis proposal, if passed, would **allocate $300k of PICKLEs/stablecoins** to:\n1) Incentivize participation on Ruler Protocol to allow PICKLE holders to use PICKLEs as collateral; and\n2) Permit the Pickle Finance treasury to make a strategic equity investment in a promising crypto company.\n\nPIP discussion here: https://forum.pickle.finance/t/pip-33-treasury-expenditure-for-1-ruler-collaboration-and-2-strategic-investment/1034\n\n## (1) Ruler Collaboration \n\n[Ruler Protocol](https://app.rulerprotocol.com/) provides PICKLE holders the ability to borrow stablecoins without risk of liquidation if the loans are paid back in time. \n\nWe propose allocating **800 PICKLES per week for an initial period of 4 weeks**. The RULER team has committed to providing 50 RULER per week for same period. These rewards serve to incentivize liquidity.\n\nFurther information on Ruler Protocol and background discussion can be found on the Forum thread here: https://forum.pickle.finance/t/rfc-pickle-ruler-collaboration/1031.\n\n## (2) Strategic Investment by Pickle Treasury \n\nPickle Finance wishes to participate in a strategic investment with **$250,000 worth of PICKLES + stablecoins** in a preferred equity fund raising. Participants in the current funding round include Badger DAO, Consensys, Gitcoin and other prominent DeFi entities. \n\nThis investment is for a live, in-use product relating to HR services which serve the web3 workforce. Pickle Finance would receive this project's governance tokens with rewards accrued from those tokens going to the Pickle Treasury. Pickle would additionally own equity in this company and would benefit from [liquidity events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_event).\n\n#### The Deal\n\na) $250,000 worth of PICKLES + stablecoins for tokens entitling Pickle to governance and fee sharing rights. \nb) PICKLEs will not be sold for cash immediately as a majority of the PICKLEs will be vested over a period of 4 years. The price impact to the PICKLE token is negligible. \n\n#### Motivation\n\nCurrently, the [Pickle Treasury](https://debank.com/profile/0x066419eaef5de53cc5da0d8702b990c5bc7d1ab3) and [Smart Treasury](https://debank.com/profile/0xc52139a20a57c9002e9f5188901ef0ffc63c7205/) contains $1.4M worth of assets. This balance is being deployed primarily for staffing purposes. We believe that making strategic investments will ensure that the protocol continues to grow by rooting ourselves in other promising projects and the greater crypto ecosystem. This is also attractive because the other party has agreed to reciprocate with an investment in PICKLE (due to the vesting schedule).    \n",

Under the current monetary policy ([PIP-5][2]), we would go under that number in 2 weeks. With this proposal, we would instead continue with planned 10% decreases in `picklePerBlock` until emissions reach 0.10 PICKLEs/block, where they will be fixed for every week going forward.\n\nThis is meant as a temporary measure and should be reviewed as soon as it is practicable for DILL holders to vote on it.\n\n## Additional information\n\nTables, charts, and source data containing week-by-week projections for supply and weekly emissions for the next 15 years can be found on the [forum post][2].

The effort required in creating a snapshot to distribute these eventual rewards to the original depositors in our PickleJars is incredibly complex. As such, there are no immediate plans to distribute these SUSHI rewards to depositors and may be kept in the Pickle [Treasury](https://debank.com/portfolio/0x066419eaef5de53cc5da0d8702b990c5bc7d1ab3). \n\nAccordingly, the removal of performance fees from the SushiSwap PickleJars would make depositing in them more attractive.\n\n## Proposal\n\nThis proposal, if passed, would remove the 20% performance fee on the SUSHI farming PickleJars. Specifically, this includes the following Jars:\n- SLP DAI/ETH\n- SLP USDC/ETH\n- SLP USDT/ETH\n- SLP WBTC/ETH\n- SLP YFI/ETH",

      "content": "PIP discussion [here](https://forum.pickle.finance/t/pip-25-yield-farming-with-pickle-treasury/894).\n\n## Intro\nCurrently, the [Pickle Treasury](https://debank.com/portfolio/0x066419eaef5de53cc5da0d8702b990c5bc7d1ab3) contains ~$550k of funds, most of which are sitting idle.\n\n[1inch Exchange](https://1inch.exchange/#/dao/farming), the DEX aggregator has launched a [liquidity mining program](https://1inch-exchange.medium.com/1inch-launches-new-liquidity-mining-program-75e851b45060) starting on January 9, 2020 and running for the duration of a month. The program supports farming for liquidity pairs which our treasury currently holds, namely:\n- ETH/USDT ($50k)\n- ETH/DAI ($281k)\n\nBoth of these pairs earn over 50% APY at 1inch at the time of writing. There is an opportunity for our treasury to actively grow its reserves by farming on top of a trusted platform. \n\n## Proposal\nThis proposal, if passed, involves withdrawing the aforementioned liquidity pairs into Larry the Cucumber's multi-sig keyholder wallet so that he may deposit them on 1inch to take advantage of the liquidity mining program for the benefit of the Pickle Treasury. \n\nThis proposal only extends to the 1inch liquidity mining program. Any future use of treasury funds for similar purposes must be agreed upon by the Pickle community. ",

      "content": "Author: 0xBoxer\n\nThis proposal seeks to shift the rewards for PJar 0b (renBTC) to the newly established PJar 0.99 BAC/DAI.\n\nPjar 0b is earning the Protocol next to nothing and can be seen as a very expensive marketing tool at the moment. This is something we can no longer afford and this Jar will most likely never generate substantial profits for us.\n\nTherefore this Proposal seeks to divert the 8% of emissions which are currently being awarded to the PJar 0b to Pjar 0.99 to attract more AUM/TVL.\n\nFor numbers on PJar 0b: https://pickle-analysis.netlify.app/\n\nThis will probably lead to a drop in TVL(renBTC leaving), but at the same time it will lead to an increase in profits for the Pickle Protocol at whole since Pjar 0.99 is on track to generate substantial profits. Increasing the TVL in this actually profitable jar needs to be achieved at all costs and sacrificing the renBTC Jar for this very reason is a good decision in my mind.\n\nto summarize: stop the emissions to the BTC jar in order to attract more TVL for the new DAI/BAC JAR. \n\n**Risks**\nBasis Cash is a new protocol that could still fail, but the risks/rewards are pretty favorable and depositors take on that risk on their own. This proposal merely seeks to attract even more TVL to that Jar.\n\nThe worst case is loosing the little income we were generating from PJar 0b, the upside is gaining further TVL for PJar 0.99 which is actually generating substantial fees for the protocol.\n\nForum Discussion: https://forum.pickle.finance/t/introduce-a-pickle-farm-for-pjar-0-99-bac-dai/869/10\n",

      "content": "## Intro\n\nAs we all know Pickle will integrate with Yearn, with our PickleJars becoming Yearn v2 Vaults. At present Pickle will serve to 1) provide PICKLE emissions on top of the base Yearn Vault returns and 2) work to develop strategies in collaboration with Yearn to receive the 10% [strategist fee](https://snapshot.page/#/yearn/proposal/QmbAq6jPB6ocrihjkDo5TLNF4D4w9dw1HsEsJ7vwdwd9g3).  \n\nThere is potentially a need to identify and oversee the implementation of new growth opportunities beyond developing strategies which can compliment other projects within the Yearn ecosystem. \n\n## Proposal\n\nIn light of this opportunity I believe we should prioritise product research and development. If passed, this proposal would allocate **$105k/year** for paying a salary for a COO/product lead to work full time on Pickle to develop its product roadmap and lead operational initiatives in general. The compensation would be denominated in stablecoins and vested PICKLEs at a ratio of approximately 2:1. \n\n## Candidate Selection\n\nIf the budget for the proposed role is approved, a call for suitable candidates will be made on the [Pickle Discord](discord.gg/uG6WhYkM8n). Thereafter, a selection committee will assess and select a suitable candidate and for a certain length of time at its discretion. The selection committee will comprise of at least the following key Pickle contributors: @larrythecucumber, @0xkoffee, @jintao, @CeloProtocol, @purplezky,  @Rooster_Cogburn77, @sifu, and @yyctrader.\n\n## Position Responsibilities\n\nThe position would include at least the following responsibilities (taken from this Forum [post](https://forum.pickle.finance/t/team-proposal-leekuanjew/834)):\n\n- Developing and managing a Growth process: an iterative, data-driven approach to reach the organization’s goals by experimenting and compounding on what works, open to the whole community to participate in. This also involves goal-setting that is product-oriented and informs the product roadmap: its strategic, technical, and UX components.\n\n- Managing design, engineering, and marketing resources that are specifically focused on engaging the community of users. These resources are deployed in tasks ranging from optimization of a certain aspect in the Growth funnel (e.g. search engine optimization for awareness) or delivering user-facing collateral like website pages, or content in a publishing platform, or engagement in social media platforms.\n\n- Conducting research into the usability, accessibility, and scalability of the product as a whole, through direct interaction with its users.\n\n- Contributing to the management of the communications, partnerships, and community of the protocol.\n\n- Contributing to the development and management of the documentation of the protocol, its governance process, and its brand identity.",

The total value is **54 ETH**.\n\nIf this proposal passes, the Treasury cap of $500k will be temporarily lowered for the following week by half of the proposed expenditure so that the wETH staking rewards are not significantly impacted. For example, half of 54 ETH = 27 ETH = $12.5k, so the following week's cap Treasury cap will be considered to be $487.5k with amounts in excess of that given to stakers.  The cap will return to the regular $500k the week after.",

Decreasing the proportion of PICKLE/ETH LP rewards by 5% \n(from 70% -> 65%)\n2. Increasing the proportion of prenBTCCRV rewards by 3% \n(from 5% -> 8%)\n3. Increasing the proportion of pDAI rewards by 2% \n(from 4% -> 6%)\n\nThis proposal aims to address the following concerns:\n- we may be over-emphasizing the need for deep liquidity at the expense of potential profit generation;\n- we have an opportunity to significantly increase TVL by attracting latent BTC capital; and\n- we have an opportunity to increase protocol profits by attracting deposits to a high-earning PickleJar.\n\nOn the other hand, certain concerns have been raised against the proposed approach:\n- some PICKLE/ETH LPs may not want to give up 5% more of emissions; and\n- we are paying for BTC TVL using PICKLE emissions. BTC Jars are less effective for profit generation while the benefits of pure TVL are more intangible.",

Here is a summary:\n\n- sCRV is not user-friendly and requires a lot of gas to extract the underlying stablecoins.\n- WETH can be easily unwrapped into ETH, which is the natural currency of the Ethereum ecosystem.\n- WETH can be directly used to trade for most tokens on Uniswap and other exchanges.\n- Pickle was not chosen due to issues with how it looks and also potential technical risks.",

      "content": "After much discussion on the [forum](https://forum.pickle.finance/t/new-farm-for-pdai/452) as well as on the Discord, this proposal, if passed will:\n\n1. Add a new pDAI farm\n2. Zero out Pickle rewards for the psCRV pool\n3. Give those rewards (4%) to the new pDAI farm\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe reason for this is because fee-less jar swapping will be released soon, specifically before implementation of this proposal.\n\nThis means that users can easily swap their psCRV for p3CRV (and potentially gain higher underlying yield too). This makes sense since the ultimate underlying asset here is just stablecoins.\n\nThe total value locked in the new DAI jar is still an order of magnitude smaller than the other jars and this is a good chance to incentivize further deposits for our first single-asset jar.",

However, we invite the community to propose changes in the allocation of PICKLE rewards in light of these new Jars if this proposal passes.\n",

      "content": "A proposal by Larry the Cucumber, BigBrainBriner, and 0xPenguin\n\nSince the protocol launched last week, we've had to move fast while trying to maintain transparency and a clear line of communication with the community. In doing so, we were able to deliver features that the community wanted but we also encountered a lot of friction dealing with the Timelock transactions.\n\n# What\n\nThis proposal seeks to ask if it would be in the community's interest to reduce the Timelock from 48 hours (as it currently stands) to 24 hours (or even less) so that we, the devs, can deliver on features faster.\n\n# Example\n\nParticipants in PickleJar 0 currently do not earn any PICKLEs, but only a few hours after its launch, there was community consensus that we should reward them with PICKLEs. This change was queued in the Timelock but has yet to be implemented as we continue to wait for the 48 hour Timelock to be over.\n\nThe same can be said for the recent UNI-based pJars (i.e. pJar 0.69). These allow people to earn UNI, but we also want to reward people for using these pJars by giving them PICKLEs as well. This will also take another 48 hours before PICKLE rewards can be implemented.\n\n# Caveat\n\nThe team realizes that this is asking for a lot of trust on behalf of the community. While the team would like to speed up the pace of development and shipping, we also recognize that our reputation and the community's trust in us is of the utmost importance. Therefore, we will respect (and be happy with) whatever the community decides is the best course of action.",

      "content": "A proposal by the Pickle Core Devs\n\nSee [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fqDwT2vF9SLGjeYlChbWiCGhUGwOdXk-6_DFM2X6R6o/edit#) for better formatting + charts.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe community is concerned with the current monetary policy and the risks that it poses to the PICKLE ecosystem due to constant PICKLE emission leading to a high rate of annualized inflation.\n\nThe [weekly halving schedule](https://snapshot.page/#/pickle/proposal/QmcEsb4oUBtYbPRk6hTFNzhBRFFs6M7FtRVgRfRAWFzXAn) takes us to the end of Week 4, but does not specify any nuanced mechanisms beyond that. As a result, the Core Devs would like to propose an emission schedule beyond Week 4 to keep inflation in check.\n\n# Design Principles\n\nThese are the key points considered in the authoring of this proposal:\n- To clamp down on annual inflation\n- To maintain a PICKLE emission for farming to continue to exist\n- To prevent systemic shocks by using smooth emission changes\n\nThe proposed design was strongly influenced by [SIP-23](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-23) and [SIP-24](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-24) of the Synthetix community. Read their [blog post](https://blog.synthetix.io/reaching-monetary-policy-consensus/) for more details on how those proposals were constructed.\n\n# Current Emission Schedule\n\nFor context, the current PICKLE emission schedule dictates a weekly halving for the first four weeks, with a subsequent 1 PICKLE per block to be minted thereafter. \n\n# Proposed Emission Schedule\n\nThe proposed schedule will feature a gradual decrease in PICKLE minting up until the end of the first year, after which a static amount will be minted in perpetuity.\n\nStarting from Week 6 and ending at the end of Week 52, the number of PICKLEs minted will decline each week by 10% from the previous week.\n\nAfter Week 52, PICKLEs minted will remain static each week (at approx. 329 PICKLEs per week), capping the overall annualized inflation rate at 1.29% and further decreasing over time.\n",

While the Pickle Protocol is a community governed project, we also want to ensure that farming rewards are distributed fairly. Accordingly, we propose ending the 10x block reward bonus 7 days from the start of reward distribution (block #10884800). The transaction would be signed 48 hours before the 7 days to account for the timelock delay.   \n\nOnly those who have staked ETH/PICKLE UNIV2 LP tokens are eligible to vote. The snapshot of token holders will be taken at the block approximately 36 hours from now, which is also when voting will begin. Voting will end 2 days thereafter. So if you wish to vote on this proposal, please make sure you have ETH/PICKLE UNIV2 LP tokens staked in https://pickle.finance/. \n\nFYI, quadratic voting has been implemented such that whales' ability to influence votes are limited.  For example, a whale casting 100 votes == 10 regular people, each casting 1 vote. ",
