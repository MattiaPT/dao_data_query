      "content": "**TLDR of changes made since Snapshot:**\n\n* **Additional Evaluation Committee Members:** SEEDGov and JoJo have agreed to join the evaluation committee.\n* **Soft Request “Cap”:** Language was added to specify a soft request “cap” of 500k ARB (10% of the program budget), which is dependent on the total ARB requested in the program. Applicants requesting greater than 500k ARB may be sent to the DAO directly.\n* **MSS-controlled multi-sig:** Additional clarification has been added that funds will be managed by a MSS controlled multi-sig along with Entropy Advisors acting in an “approver” role to process payments to winning applicants once KYC has been completed.\n* **Flexibility in Milestone Structure:** Language has been revised to allow applicants to propose their own milestone structure.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe [ArbOS 31 “Bianca”](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/108288822474129076868455956066667369439381709547570289793612729242368710728616) onchain vote on Tally has passed and executed, activating Arbitrum Stylus on Arbitrum One and Nova. To bolster the impact of this upgrade, this proposal presents the one-time “Stylus Sprint” program, aimed at encouraging the early development of Stylus smart contracts and tooling by awarding up to 5,000,000 ARB to teams who build with Stylus. Applications will be open for 8 weeks with a 2 week review period and program length of 1 year. The Sprint will include a mix of open applications where teams are encouraged to be creative in their ideas as well as invitational/RFQs with strategically targeted objectives. The requested funding is intended to cover development costs, including hiring talent, training teams, adopting new tools, infrastructure expenses, and audits at the discretion of the recipient. This campaign’s primary objectives are to engage new and existing Arbitrum protocol teams with this novel technology, showcase use cases only feasible with Stylus, and create foundational Stylus building blocks for widespread use.\n\nInterested teams must apply through a designated application process and grant recipients will be selected by an Evaluation Committee based on specific criteria detailed in this proposal. As the program progresses, participating teams will receive staged funding as they reach predefined and agreed-upon milestones, culminating in the deployment and long-term upkeep of their projects.\n\n## Motivation\n\nToday, the Stylus ecosystem is promising but very nascent. At launch, the developer experience will be in its early stages, offering an opportunity for pioneers to shape and refine Stylus as they build with it. Teams building with Stylus today are early adopters of the technology and are pushing the limits of what is possible on the EVM.\n\nThe “Stylus Sprint” is strategically designed to accelerate the adoption of Stylus and help drive visibility into Stylus’ transformative potential to the broader crypto community. Launched in conjunction with Bianca passing, this program aims to strengthen the momentum of the upgrade, drawing significant adoption and attention to the technological advancements it introduces.\n\n[Stylus](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-activate-stylus-and-enable-next-gen-webassembly-smart-contracts/22970) represents a pivotal innovation for the entire Ethereum ecosystem, setting Arbitrum apart from other platforms by enabling the use of multiple programming languages for smart contracts. This not only enhances the efficiency and capabilities of Arbitrum applications but also broadens the accessibility of Arbitrum’s ecosystem to a more diverse group of developers. By supporting smart contracts written in languages such as Rust, C, and C++, Stylus expands the scope of possible applications, unlocking untapped use cases for end users and making Arbitrum a more versatile and attractive platform for developers. This capability represents a tangible competitive advantage for Arbitrum, and it is crucial that this differentiator is prominently showcased via its use in high-value developments.\n\nThe “Stylus Sprint” will provide financial incentives to encourage the development of high-quality projects. This support aims to attract top-tier developers from within the Arbitrum, EVM, and Rust communities, targeting teams new to Arbitrum that can only realize their ideas with Stylus, existing Arbitrum projects with complex computation for migration, and developers from other WASM ecosystems (e.g., Solana Rust Devs), fostering a diverse range of applications. By demonstrating the practical benefits and performance enhancements Stylus offers, the program seeks to establish a robust portfolio of Stylus-based contracts, helping solidify Arbitrum’s position as a leader in the rollup race. The Sprint will also empower developers to create building blocks for a wide variety of projects building on Arbitrum such as reference contracts, Rust libraries, testing/development frameworks, and SDK contributions. Reference tooling and code are crucial to any development-based ecosystem’s staying power.\n\nThe Stylus Sprint aims to create a ripple effect of innovation and adoption, ultimately contributing to a more dynamic and capable Arbitrum ecosystem for developers, users, and token holders.\n\n## Rationale and Goals\n\n1. Demonstrate the efficiency of, and untapped possibilities with, Stylus by showing how teams can build never-before-built protocols on Arbitrum and take advantage of Stylus’ efficiency and compute advantages.\n2. Support network growth and accelerate the distribution of capital to both EVM and non-EVM protocols that migrate to Stylus to further drive network and ecosystem growth. This includes infrastructure as well as applications.\n3. Attract top protocols from other ecosystems drawn by Stylus’ efficiency gains and multi-language support, which in turn will bring their user bases, increasing overall activity and transaction volume on the network.\n4. Implement a strategy to distribute grants over extended periods and in alignment with the achievement of key milestones. This approach aims to cultivate enduring relationships with protocols and ensure sustained development and engagement.\n5. Position Arbitrum as the most accessible, efficient, and powerful EVM-compatible ecosystem to build in.\n6. Provide ample resources, support, and incentives to developers utilizing Stylus, fostering robust projects and vibrant communities. This will drive the long-term growth and success of Arbitrum.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Application Process & RFP Details:\n\nAs mentioned, the Stylus Sprint program invites teams to submit applications either in the open-applications track or in response to lightweight Request for Proposals (RFPs, listed below) that target specific verticals, published by the Evaluation Committee. The below lists are non-exhaustive and serve as inspiration. Participants in the open track will have ample opportunity for innovation and creativity. All requests for both the open-application track and RFPs must be denominated in ARB.\n\nFor the open-application track, non-exhaustive categories may include:\n\n* New developer-focused infrastructure or extensions of existing developer-focused infrastructure to improve the arsenal of tools available to Stylus builders;\n* New applications that feature untapped use cases only made possible via Stylus, on Arbitrum One or new app chains using Stylus on Orbit chains;\n* External WebAssembly (WASM) application or chain migrations (from ecosystems that use Rust for their smart contracts);\n* Existing EVM application migrations from Solidity to Rust (e.g., an app rewriting a portion of their code using Stylus).\n\nFor the RFP track, the committee is excited to hear proposals from teams working on developing:\n\n* Tooling to add support for new languages with Stylus to expand the reach and adoption of Stylus among developers. This can include new SDKs, EVM-tooling specific to the new language, and/or reference implementations and libraries for the new language. To get inspired for what languages might be interesting to see support get added for:\n* [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/introduction.html) - a Typescript-based programming language optimized for, and statically compiled down to, WASM. Typescript is a widely used programming language, with 38.5% of all developers claiming to have used or currently use Typescript, compared to 12.6% for Rust [according to Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-languages/).\n* [Move ](https://move-language.github.io/move/)- a resource-oriented, strongly typed programming language that offers built-in support for formal verification of code correctness. Originally developed by Meta for their Libra/Diem stablecoin, this language has gained popularity among emergent L1s like Flow, Aptos, and Sui. Adding Move support to Stylus and by extension the EVM opens the opportunity for Move-based applications to tap into the already-massive Arbitrum ecosystem and the liquidity layer of Ethereum.\n* A GUI for developers to inspect and interact with the [Stylus cache manager](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/concepts/stylus-cache-manager) on Arbitrum One. Extra consideration will be given to teams who make such a service/instance self-hostable to unlock widespread adoption and use among Stylus Orbit chains. Example user journeys that can be covered are:\n  * How a developer inspects the contents of the cache;\n  * How a developer gets the minimum bid price before bidding;\n  * How a developer makes a bid for their contract to join the cache;\n  * How a developer views the position of their contract within the cache, and/or;\n  * How a developer can subscribe to events or changes to the cache as it pertains to their contract(s).\n* A Solidity-to-WASM compiler to reduce the migration cost (for existing applications) of moving over to WASM. This in turn aims to help current Solidity projects reap the benefits of a more secure and performant WASM VM sooner and with less upfront work.\n* General improvements to the current debugging workflow and developer experience for Stylus applications and Orbit chain developers. This can include compatibility enhancements and Stylus-specific improvements to how GDB is currently used to debug Stylus applications, or the introduction/integration of new tooling to elevate the UX of Stylus contract debugging.\n* General enhancements and/or extensions to the existing Stylus Rust SDK, the cargo-stylus command line tool, and/or the WASM VM within Arbitrum Nitro itself.\n* Stylus-specific education and developer relations materials to onboard the next generation of Web3 developers.\n* Tools and frameworks to demonstratively help [CosmWASM](https://cosmwasm.com/) and Solana projects (as examples) to migrate to Arbitrum chains.\n\nThe application approach described above for both open applications and RFPs ensures a structured yet flexible framework for harnessing the potential of Stylus technology. Not all funds will necessarily be deployed, and even if an RFP has quotes, there is no guarantee that any will be deemed satisfactory and chosen. The above categories are non-exhaustive and meant to be viewed as examples. If this proposal passes, the Evaluation Committee will cement an official list before applications open.\n\nTeams are required to submit a detailed application outlining their plans for utilizing the funding. These applications will be thoroughly reviewed by the Evaluation Committee, which will also approve them. Upon approval, milestone payments will be systematically allocated to the teams based on their progress. If no satisfactory applications are received, as decided at the discretion of the Evaluation Committee, 0 ARB will be spent, and all unspent funds will be returned to DAO.\n\n### Evaluation Committee and Committee Advisors\n\nTo effectively administer the program, it is essential to establish an Evaluation Committee composed of Stylus experts. Given the innovative nature and specific technical nuances of Stylus, we propose that the committee be primarily made up of members from Offchain Labs and OpenZeppelin, the two entities responsible for developing Stylus thus far. [@SEEDGov](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/seedgov) and [@JoJo](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/jojo) bring extensive experience in DAO grant programs and will help round out the committee with additional perspective/backgrounds.\n\n**Evaluation Committee**\n\n1. Stylus Team Members - Offchain Labs (Waiving Payment)\n2. Dev Team - Arbitrum Foundation (Waiving Payment)\n3. Michael Lewellen - OpenZeppelin (5000 ARB per month)\n4. Gustavo Gonzalez - OpenZeppelin (5000 ARB per month)\n5. SEEDGov Org (5000 ARB per month)\n6. JoJo (5000 ARB per month)\n7. Entropy Advisors (Waiving Payment)\n\nThe committee will work collaboratively to provide feedback and access applications. In the event of a equally split opinion, the Arbitrum Foundation will serve as the tie-breaking opinion.\n\n**Committee Advisors**\n\n1. Entropy Advisors (Waiving Payment)\n\nThe Committee Advisors’ main role will be facilitating discourse with the DAO, applicants, and general project management in order to reduce the burden on the Evaluation Committee where possible. **Members of the Evaluation Committee and Committee Advisors will not be eligible to apply to the program in any capacity due to conflicts of interest.**\n\nJudges and Advisors will serve for approximately 14.5 months, with the Stylus Sprint expected to begin in November 2024 and conclude mid-January 2026. In the first 2 weeks, they will work together to refine the application and evaluation criteria as well as specifics around the RFPs to kickstart the process. The following 8 weeks will be used to review proposals as they come in. Subsequent 2 weeks will be taken to officially accept and reject projects. **Both accepted and rejected applications will receive public rationale from the Evaluation Committee as to why the choice was made so that the DAO may have a view into the decisions and the teams can adjust accordingly in the future.** In the next 12 months, contributors will greenlight milestone payments as projects achieve their goals and periodically give guidance to participants. Advisors will report back to the DAO through monthly updates over the lifespan of the program. These updates will be posted to a dedicated Stylus Sprint forum channel.\n\n### Recommended Application Structure and Framing\n\nApplications for the program will be rigorously evaluated based on a set of clearly defined criteria. To ensure a thorough assessment, grantees are encouraged to provide detailed information about their plans and objectives for the grant. Each application should include:\n\n* What their plans are to grow their protocols within the Arbitrum ecosystem;\n* How closely the team’s mission aligns with those of Arbitrum;\n* Whether or not they clearly demonstrate how they will utilize Stylus;\n* An appropriate spending plan for how the grant will be used;\n* A reasonable development plan and timeline.\n\nJudges and advisors may also consider other relevant metrics tailored to the specifics of each application. These could include innovation potential, the experience of the team, market readiness, user engagement strategies, or any other factors deemed relevant.\n\nThe recommendations above are designed to ensure that the selected projects are coming to the committee with a high-quality plan and to ensure that the application ideas are not only viable, but also poised to make significant contributions to the Arbitrum ecosystem. By adhering to this application structure, the evaluation process aims to foster transparency, fairness, and alignment with the strategic objectives of the Arbitrum network. The judges and advisors will work together to create the application and evaluation criteria.\n\nQuestbook will be utilized for hosting the Stylus Sprint, accepting/rejecting applications, and giving public reasoning for the choice.\n\n### Application Evaluation Criteria\n\nWhile we strongly believe each application will be unique and should therefore be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, a baseline framework and evaluation criteria are outlined below to give teams a feel for what to keep in mind when applying and building.\n\nOverall, the Evaluation Committee will be on the lookout for, and prioritize evaluating applications, that:\n\n* **Can scale, or help scale**, Stylus usage over the long run. Examples include tooling and frameworks that can be extended, built upon, and leveraged by many teams all at once.\n* **Contribute to the young, but growing, ecosystem of Stylus tooling and infrastructure**, rather than direct contributions to individual Stylus applications and Stylus Orbit chains.\n* **Focus on projects that aim to be self-sustainable in the medium to long term**, rather than one-off projects that can only exist/survive for the short duration of the program.\n* **Directly highlight core Stylus benefits and strengths with excellent creativity**, including the efficient use of computational and storage resources or security primitives that Stylus bolsters and shines at.\n* **Fill a specific, unique niche in the market**, as opposed to re-implementing an existing application, tool, or chain in Stylus for the sake of using Stylus (and not the other purported benefits one gets with Stylus).\n* **Come from outside the Arbitrum and/or Ethereum ecosystem** to effectively “grow the pie” of Web3 projects and users.\n\nNote that applications may be rejected for a variety of reasons as there are a limited number of resources to allocate to a near-infinite pool of great ideas/applicants that can emerge. Out of scope are projects that are already being funded by the ArbitrumDAO, Offchain Labs, or the Arbitrum Foundation, or are otherwise nearing completion by the time this program’s evaluation period ends. Examples of this include the development of the Stylus Rust SDK that is already being scoped out and developed by Offchain Labs.\n\n### Multisig Setup\n\nThe Stylus Sprint specific MSS multi-sig will be created and allocated 5M ARB for the Stylus Sprint Program, 300K ARB for payments to judges, and 30k ARB for payment to Questbook. Funds will be sent to an MSS-secured multisig.\n\nEntropy Advisors will function in the “approver” role working with the MSS and the Arbitrum Foundation to process payments to winning applicants once KYC has been completed.\n\n### Funding Levels and Disbursement\n\nTeams will apply for their appropriate levels of funding. Suggested levels in ARB are 1M, 750K 500K, 250K, 100K, or 50K. If teams want a different amount of funding, they must specify why in their application. These funding levels have been set to streamline the review process. However, teams are encouraged to request specific amounts of funding best suited to their needs. Teams will have 1 year to deploy their project and meet their 2 post-deployment milestones. There is no maximum request amount, but requests over 500k that are deemed quality, have a likelihood of being sent to the DAO instead of included in the program depending on the total ARB requested in the program and quality of the applications. All requests for both the open-application track and RFPs must be denominated in ARB.\n\nUnallocated funds will be returned to the DAO treasury after all applications have been reviewed and grant sizes have been determined. An additional dispersal to the DAO could occur if projects don’t manage to hit their goals within the 1-year timeline and if the budget has remaining ARB. There is absolutely no need to allocate all funds, and it will only be done if more than 5M in exemplary proposals are received during the 8-week application cycle.\n\nFunding will be distributed based on achieving certain development milestones. The number of checkpoints, percentage of funds unlocked, and criteria for each will be proposed by the applicant. This is to grant additional flexibility as a one size fits all milestone structure is not the best approach given the wide-range of potential applicants and the volatile nature of ARB requests. While the milestone structure is flexible, the evaluation committee will prioritize applicants that backload payment distribution over those that request high percentages upfront.\n\nThe below milestone structure is recommended; however, it is not required:\n\n1. **10% - Planning** + Building: Creation of a Development Plan, Architecture Design, Prototyping, Implementation, Optimization.\n2. **40% - Deployment**: Testing, Auditing, Deployment. \\*Projects will be eligible but not guaranteed admission into the subsidy program per the ADPC\n3. **25% - Checkpoint 1**\n4. **25% - Checkpoint 2**\n\nAll projects will be required to use milestones in order to ensure progress is being made before funds are fully allocated. For RFPs, custom milestone payments can be included in the quotes provided by service providers. Approved projects will submit requests as they reach milestones. The judges, with help from their advisors, will be responsible for ensuring validity and greenlighting payment to be sent as milestones are hit, in accordance with the Evaluation Criteria mentioned above.\n\nThe evaluation committee will have the autonomy and authority to expel projects from the program at any point in their life cycle and stop all future milestone payments.\n\n## Grant Eligibility Requirements\n\n* Grantees must participate in a case study that highlights their Stylus development experience\n* Grantees must build their projects open source, but not necessarily free to use. Free to use however will be a factor in the evaluation committee criteria.\n* Grantees must participate in co-marketing activities to promote their protocol and Stylus.\n* Grantees must outline a spending plan, provide a pro forma, and state the grant’s objective.\n* Grantees must agree to share all contract addresses being used to judge progress.\n* Grants are not to be used in DAO governance.\n* Grantees must not encourage or partake in sybil attacks against the forum to sway community opinion.\n* Grantees must agree to KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation in order to receive funds.\n* Grantees must apply using the approved program application template.\n\n## Timeline\n\n1. Stylus Sprint Forum Post - August 20, 2024\n2. Snapshot Vote Begins - August 29, 2024\n3. On-Chain Vote - Oct 10th, 2024\n4. Stylus Sprint Begins - Oct 28, 2024\n5. Open Application Period Begins - Nov 11th, 2024\n6. Open Application Period Ends - Jan 6th, 2025\n7. Application Review Period Ends - Jan 20th, 2025\n   a. 1 year timeline for selected applicants begins\n   b. KYC/Compliance process with the Arbitrum Foundation begins\n\nThe program will begin on the Monday following the onchain proposal’s passing. The first 2 weeks will be used to refine and post the RFPs, followed by open applications for 8 weeks, then a 2-week application review process. Feedback between the Evaluation Committee and applicants will be conducted on an ongoing/continuous basis till the end of the Review Period (Jan 20th). Applicants will receive feedback on a first come, first serve basis. Those that apply early will likely have an edge over late applicants who will have less opportunities for feedback. KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation will begin after the review period and first milestone payments may be allocated upon completion. The MSS chairs, Arbitrum Foundation, and Entropy Advisors will work closely to ensure a strict payment process.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\n**5,330,000 ARB**\n\n* Up to 5M to be awarded to projects building on Stylus.\n* 75,000 ARB payment in total over 14.5 months per committee member for 4 committee members = 300,000 ARB. Committee members will be paid in monthly increments of 5000 ARB.\n* 30,000 ARB paid up front to Questbook.",

      "content": "## [](#p-57276-last-update-02102024-1)Last update: 02/10/2024\n\n*This proposal has been updated based on feedback from delegates provided in this thread during the two calls we organized, as well as through discussions in the delegates’ Telegram group and private contributions from several delegates. We would like to thank the entire ArbitrumDAO community for their valuable input.*\n\n# [](#p-57276-tldr-2)TL;DR\n\n* Expand the program by introducing a new and improved version, **to be implemented over the course of a year.**\n* We propose a total budget of USD 4.2 million (in a year) in delegate incentives, **with a maximum monthly compensation of 7000 USD or 16,500 ARB per month per delegate.**\n* **Creating Delegates’ compensation tiers:**\n  * **Tier 3:** TP ≥ 65% and \\< 70%. Compensation range: $3,000 to $3,250. ARB cap: 8,000.\n  * **Tier 2:** TP ≥ 70% and \\< 85%. Compensation range: $4,200 to $5,100. ARB cap: 12,000.\n  * **Tier 1:** TP ≥ 85%. Compensation range: $5,950 to $7,000. ARB cap: 16,500.\n* **Elimination of the special multisig**, the DIP adheres to the [MSS](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4f6f6c1ba11de1122d5d5b8b098999610920fdc9c61a5e775ea09fbb4bdffc1b)\n* The DAO can cancel the program or modify parameters, such as the scoring methodology, through a Snapshot vote.\n* **Min threshold requirement change:** Participation Rate (Karma) ≥ 75% participation in on-chain votes in the last 90 days. Previously, the requirement was 25% of total historical votes.\n* **Soft enforcement for DAO’s social agreements:** Each delegate must adhere to and comply with all social agreements reached through Snapshot in order to receive incentives.\n* Adding the possibility of **revoking DIP Ban** via Snapshot vote and also creating the **DIP Suspension.**\n* **Delegates’ Feedback Update:** The DAO has [opted](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1326cb522a74b29fb12d52bb302b245180c2b8f6e1fe8f295c4447bd96a5bacd) for v1.5 of the DIP, so a new rubric will be applied to evaluate the feedback given by the delegates in the diverse discussions. Due to the experimental nature of this new scoring system, it will be in a testing phase, and we, as Administrators, commit to **submitting it to the DAO for consultation after three months of running the program.**\n* **Note that everything related to** [DIP 1.0](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/98889951328992702889653461987621825257851718470562453684547824130828387112157) **that has not been mentioned as modifications in this new proposal will remain in effect in v1.5.**\n* **Scoring Weight Changes**:\n  * **Participation Rate (PR):** Previously weighted at 20% and based on historical participation rates in Tally. Now, it is reduced to 15%, calculated based on the participation rate of the last 90 days in on-chain votes (as calculated by Karma).\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV):** The weight of this parameter has increased from 15% to 20%.\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR)**: The weight of this parameter has decreased from 25% to 10%.\n  * **Delegates’ Feedback (DF):** The weight of this parameter has increased from 15% to 30%.\n  * **Total Participation (TP):** The requirement for total participation has increased from +60% to +65%.\n  * **Bonus points update:** Adding Bonus Points for delegates who attends to the “[Arbitrum Governance Report Call](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/19th-grc-governance-reporting-call-on-wednesday-september-25th-at-2pm-utc/26901)” (monthly) and the “[Open Discussion of Proposal(s) - Bi-weekly Governance Call](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/governance/biweekly-proposals-discussions-call/46).”\n    * For the monthly call, 2,5% BP will be awarded for attendance.\n    * For the bi-weekly calls, 2.5% BP will be awarded for attending each call.\n\n# [](#p-57276-abstract-3)Abstract\n\nWe propose renewing the ArbitrumDAO Delegate Incentive Program (DIP) for one year. This renewal will include adjustments to the parameters, requirements, budget, and incentives awarded to delegates.\n\n# [](#p-57276-motivation-4)Motivation\n\nWe’ve reached the [fifth month of the current version](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-incentive-program-results-july-2024/26098) of the incentive program, which ends on August 31.\n\nAs outlined in the [mid-term report](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/from-engagement-to-rewards-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-participation-and-incentives/25671), the program has positively impacted ArbitrumDAO during the first three months.\n\nHowever, simply renewing the program will not generate enough value. Therefore, we propose adjustments to improve the program and increase its impact on ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThese changes are based on our experience as administrators, the reports we’ve conducted, and feedback from delegates, the Karma team, and key community members.\n\n**Note:** *SEEDGov delivered the end-term report, you can check it* [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/from-engagement-to-rewards-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-participation-and-incentives-part-2-final-report/26982)*.*\n\n# [](#p-57276-strengthening-dips-mission-vision-5)Strengthening DIP’s Mission & Vision\n\nAs we mentioned in the [report](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/response-to-arbitrum-staking-proposal-ardc-research-deliverable/26048), it is crucial to keep delegated voting power active within ArbitrumDAO. We believe the Incentive Program should focus on the professionalization of delegates.\n\nBy professionalization, delegates should dedicate a significant amount of time to staying informed about developments in ArbitrumDAO, gaining knowledge of Arbitrum’s technology, and making meaningful contributions to the DAO. This includes active participation in most DAO activities like providing feedback on proposals, attending to Governance Calls, maintaining high voting participation on Snapshot and Tally, and providing a rationale for such votes.\n\nTo achieve this, we also need to establish transparent and predictable incentives. Delegates should be confident that if they align with the DAO and improve their contributions over time—essentially if they professionalize—they will receive better incentives. These incentives should be transparent and attractive without being subject to manipulation or arbitrary changes in their amount. Delegates should focus on their role and DAO activities, not on understanding complex economic mechanisms to receive compensation.\n\nWe want delegates to be motivated to participate actively in ArbitrumDAO. In order to do this, incentives must be attractive enough for them to either participate directly or hire competent individuals to represent their interests, those of their community, or their protocol.\n\nIt’s important to note that while managing the incentive program, we realized that it doesn’t address all the challenges faced by the DAO, such as vote distribution, attracting new contributors, and other aspects. Expecting a single strategy to tackle all issues overlooks the diversity of factors involved. However, we’re pleased to see initiatives like [ARB Staking](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arb-staking-unlock-arb-utility-and-align-governance/25084), [(Re)delegation Week](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/what-is-re-delegation-week-application-thread/25262/26), and the [Public Good Citizen Enfranchisement Pool](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-to-a-public-access-public-good-citizen-enfranchisement-pool-through-event-horizon/21523/1) are underway to address these challenges. As each initiative matures, we can align them to achieve a more significant collective impact.\n\n# [](#p-57276-general-parameters-6)General parameters\n\nThe proposed changes below are based on the experience we’ve gained while managing the program, the delegates’ feedback during the discussion on this thread, and both reports we made for the DIP 1.0 ([mid-term](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/from-engagement-to-rewards-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-participation-and-incentives/25671) report and [final](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/from-engagement-to-rewards-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-participation-and-incentives-part-2-final-report/26982) report).\n\n**If you want to view the parameters of the previous program, click** [here](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/98889951328992702889653461987621825257851718470562453684547824130828387112157).\n\n## [](#p-57276-duration-7)Duration\n\nThe program’s first phase lasted six months, as it was designed as an experimental foundation. For this iteration, extending the duration to twelve months is appropriate, providing greater predictability and flexibility for implementing future changes.\n\n**ArbitrumDAO may cancel the program or modify parameters, such as scoring methodology, through an instantaneous vote.**\n\n## [](#p-57276-requirements-to-participate-in-the-dip-8)Requirements to Participate in the DIP\n\nThe requirements to participate in the program are as follows:\n\n* Each delegate must adhere to all social agreements reached through Snapshot, including those outlined in proposals such as ‘[Improving Predictability in Arbitrum DAO’s Operations](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x249a8e8aef5dc59da18b72e7d14ace5197ec6242675ab7f82b3d3f17f71bb13b),’ ‘[Should the DAO Create COI & Self Voting Policies](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xbbec2fbf891d9abb21e8be380f79806519df8294d1d2cdce155d105fd1fed8db)?,’ ‘[Incentives Detox Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x99b57df3577e8e6561f3549b057bd87fdb7e66f65a7c45fddf63d9cd62f993d8),’ and any other proposals or codes of conduct that may be approved in the future.\n* **Voting Power: >50K ARB, corresponding to 176 delegates.** (Source: [Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n  * **Change:** This parameter will remain unchanged.\n  * **Motivation:** Currently, only 30% of delegates meeting this requirement are part of the program. One of our goals for this renewal is to increase the number of participating delegates.\n* **Participation Rate (Karma): ≥75% participation in on-chain votes in the last 90 days.**\n  * **Change:** Previously, the requirement was 25% of total historical votes.\n  * **Motivation:** As the number of proposals grows, the impact of each individual vote decreases, making it challenging to meet the historical 25% PR. This change aims to lower the barrier for new participants, ensuring that all delegates, regardless of when they joined Arbitrum, are recognized for their consistency and active participation in the DAO. In this way, the program’s approach encourages the active participation of delegates, ensuring a more accurate and up-to-date representation.\n\n### [](#p-57276-onboarding-new-delegates-9)Onboarding new delegates\n\n*A new delegate, without prior participation history, can join the program starting in the third month after casting his first on-chain vote, as long as he meets the specified requirements (>50k voting power and ≥75% participation in on-chain votes) during that third month.*\n\n![image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/2/2d74f7ff92612525b1bd8a4b822d56642337323f_2_690x428.png)\n\n## [](#p-57276-incentive-program-application-10)Incentive Program Application\n\nDelegates who meet the requirements must confirm their participation in the DIP via the [DIP Application Thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/incentive-program-delegate-application/20945). Delegates can join the program anytime within 12 months, provided they meet the specified criteria. To minimize the potential for manipulation, delegates who sign up before the third day of the month will be included in the incentive calculations for that month. **The delegates who have registered for v1.0 will not have to go through this procedure again**\n\n### [](#p-57276-regarding-delegates-kyc-11)Regarding delegates’ KYC\n\nIt is important to mention that it **won’t be necessary** for the delegates already registered to complete the KYC again. They will only need to sign updated agreements with the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n### [](#p-57276-incentive-program-application-template-12)Incentive Program Application Template\n\n* Forum Username (Link):\n* Twitter Profile (Link):\n* Snapshot Profile (Link):\n* Participation Rate 90 days - Karma (Link):\n\n**Note:** *Any delegate who chooses to withdraw from the program can indicate their intention to opt out by posting a message in the forum.*\n\n## [](#p-57276-number-of-delegates-to-receive-incentives-13)Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives\n\nWe will maintain this parameter at 50 delegates.\n\n## [](#p-57276-incentive-budget-14)Incentive Budget\n\n**Budget Allocation: MAX 4,200,000 USD (up to 7.000 USD per delegate per month).**\n\n### [](#p-57276-making-the-incentives-more-predictable-15)Making the incentives more predictable\n\nIn the initial iteration of the DIP, costs were denominated solely in ARB, which led to challenges due to the token’s [volatility](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/treasury-backed-vaults-risk-analysis/26192).\n\nWhen the program launched in March, the token was valued at approximately USD 1.70, allowing a delegate with 100% Total Participation (TP) to earn around USD 8,500 per month. However, now, in the fifth month of the program, the token is valued at USD 0.55, reducing a delegate’s maximum monthly compensation to about USD 2,750—a decrease of over 60% for the same amount of work. This significant reduction could disincentivize delegate participation.\n\nThe same issue applies to operational, development, and maintenance costs, which have become increasingly misaligned.\n\nTo avoid this situation, we propose that payments be denominated in USD **and made in ARB tokens**. Again, the delegates’ incentives should be transparent and attractive without being subject to manipulation or arbitrary changes in their amount.\n\nIf we want to professionalize DAO operations as much as possible and stay aligned we should aim for delegates to have a certain seniority and dedication to Bringing Value to Arbitrum DAO. Thus, delegates who meet the requirements at the end of the month and achieve a TP of at least 65% will be eligible to receive up to 7,000 USD in ARB tokens as compensation.\n\nNow, as program administrators, our goal is to create the necessary incentives to elevate the overall quality of contributions. During the first iteration of the DIP, we observed that the compensation for top delegates did not significantly differ from those with lower Total Participation (TP) scores. To address this, we propose the introduction of three compensation tiers based on the Total Participation Rate achieved by each delegate.\n\n* **Tier 3:** TP ≥ 65% and \\< 70%. Compensation range: $3,000 to $3,250. ARB cap: 8,000.\n* **Tier 2:** TP ≥ 70% and \\< 85%. Compensation range: $4,200 to $5,100. ARB cap: 12,000.\n* **Tier 1:** TP ≥ 85% and \\< 100%. Compensation range: $5,950 to $7,000. ARB cap: 16,500.\n\nThis approach makes the program more cost-effective per USD spent because as the quality of contributions increases, more resources are allocated to higher-performing delegates (those in tiers 1 and 2). Conversely, if delegate performance is suboptimal, fewer resources are allocated, with more delegates falling into tiers 2 and 3.\n\nWe considered the volatility of the ARB token by suggesting an ARB cap for each Tier. In this way, while delegates’ compensation could still be affected after a drastic price drop, we would at the same time protect the DAO’s interests by limiting its “loss” somewhat. It also act as a mechanism to align delegates with Arbitrum DAO.\n\n**Note:** *ARB Cap for each Tier **includes a 30% buffer**.*\n\nWe’ll provide a simulation of what the payout would look like in 3 different scenarios:\n\n* **1st scenario (base): ARB at $0.55**\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/d/d030a4c6c32c6d51fe582b410ab77e7bf38bebe0_2_602x283.png)\n\n* **2nd Scenario: ARB at $0.35**\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/c7772de483ab320803d0e1074ac0ace0b2232e29_2_602x283.png)\n\n* **3rd Scenario: ARB at $1.00**\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/6/6d5527d5473ae5488221630857e1bd793933235a_2_602x288.png)\n\n**Note:** *We will use the* [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) *rate at the time of payment to determine the value of ARB each month.*\n\nAs seen in the images, an increase in ARB’s price would significantly reduce the spending in ARB, allowing the DAO to benefit from the rise. In the other hand, if the price falls to $0.35, the token expenditure of the program is limited to mitigate the DAO’s potential “loss.” This approach also better aligns the program’s USD spending with the DAO’s new economic and financial reality.\n\nAdditionally, the use of tiers in this manner allows for a significant boost in incentives when efforts are increased, acting as a catalyst for delegate activity. The first tier serves as a ‘minimum payment’ for delegates who, for example, fulfill their primary duties: participating in every vote and providing some input in the forum.\n\nTiers 1 and 2 represent the leap in quality, requiring greater effort to obtain 70-100% of the TP, but offering a higher reward in return. A delegate who provides a high degree of dedication and high quality input can DOUBLE the incentives of the lowest tier.\n\n**Payments to delegates are expected to be processed in ARB from the MSS between the 15th and 16th of each month.**\n\n## [](#p-57276-conflict-resolution-16)Conflict resolution\n\n### [](#p-57276-dispute-17)Dispute\n\nIf delegates disagree with the results presented by the [Karma Dashboard](https://arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation) at the beginning of each month, they have a four-day period to contest them.\n\nTo raise a dispute, delegates must post a message in the forum using the following template:\n\n* Title: Dispute\n* Username\n* Reason for Dispute (provide details)\n\nThe DIP administrator will address the issue promptly, with a resolution expected within a maximum of 4 days.\n\n### [](#p-57276-dip-ban-18)DIP Ban\n\nThe program administrator will have the right to expel a delegate if they attempt to game or exploit the program or if the delegate does not meet any of the aforementioned requirements to be considered eligible. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator. In all cases the ban is permanent.\n\nThe affected delegate may request a Snapshot vote to ratify, change (for suspension), or revoke the Administrator’s decision. This serves as a one-time appeal, and the decision made by the DAO will be final.\n\n### [](#p-57276-dip-suspension-19)DIP Suspension\n\nThe program administrator will have the right to suspend a delegate if he/she/they commits a fault that in the administrator’s judgment is insufficient cause for expulsion. The decision and duration of the suspension are at the discretion of the program administrator (duration can’t exceed the program’s current iteration).\n\nThe affected delegate may request a Snapshot vote to ratify, change, or revoke the Administrator’s decision. This serves as a one-time appeal, and the decision made by the DAO will be final.\n\n## [](#p-57276-scoring-20)Scoring\n\nTo determine which delegates will receive monthly payments, we will continue using the [dashboard](https://arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation) developed by Karma.\n\n**Note:** *The program manager may adjust the compensation parameters, provided they inform the DAO of the reasons for the changes.*\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3ce736d6381929e586ea2e23db6ca976722c0d83_2_690x322.png)[](#p-57276-new-evaluation-system-for-delegates-feedback-21)**New Evaluation System for Delegates’ Feedback**\n\nWe’ve listened to the concerns raised by some delegates regarding the changes in the Delegates’ Feedback section.\n\nSo, we propose changing the way we collect feedback from a quantitative to a qualitative way.\n\nInstead of counting comments on proposals that reach Snapshot, we propose implementing a monthly analysis of the feedback provided by delegates, regardless of whether the proposal/discussion has reached Snapshot.\n\nIn this way, the Program Administrator would be responsible for creating a rubric that evaluates the value and timeliness of the feedback provided by delegates. The goal of this system is to:\n\n* Incentivize quality over quantity of feedback.\n* Extend the analysis across all contributions made by a delegate in the forum (instead of only considering those that reach Snapshot).\n* Avoid unnecessary or spam comments made solely to achieve a higher score.\n* Allow delegates to focus on contributing to proposals or discussions related to their areas of expertise.\n\nUnder this system, a delegate could achieve the same score with (for example) one big significant contribution or by making several smaller contributions. It also discourages actors who might try to take advantage of the program.\n\n#### [](#p-57276-evaluation-approach-22)**Evaluation Approach**\n\nThis rubric assesses the overall feedback provided by the delegate throughout the month (from day 1 at 00:00 UTC to the last day of the month at 23:59:59 UTC), based on a summary of their participation in various proposals and discussions. The aim is to measure the consistency, quality, and overall impact of their contributions. We expect delegates to comment on and/or provide feedback on proposals and discussions both before and during the voting process. This feedback should aim to foster debate, improve the proposal, or clarify issues not explicitly addressed within it.\n\nWe trust the goodwill of the delegates to avoid meaningless/spam comments and ensure that all contributions are sensible.\n\n* **Key point:** Feedback or opinions that violate [community rules](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/community-guidlines/12807) will not be considered. Your interactions should contribute constructively to the discussions and the deliberation and improvement of the proposals.\n\n#### [](#p-57276-rubric-specifications-23)**Rubric Specifications**\n\nThe parameter “Proposal Feedback” should be renamed to \"Delegate’s Feedback” in this case since we’re analyzing the overall feedback provided by the delegate (not just proposals on snapshot) and will maintain a maximum weight of 30%, the score will be awarded based on the following rubric:\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8f9ffbb43536c0fd29508d9230235895d8ba9b42_2_602x471.png)\n\nHere is a breakdown of each criterion included in the rubric:\n\n* **Relevance:** Analyzes whether the delegate’s feedback throughout the month is relevant to the discussion.\n* **Depth of Analysis:** It evaluates the depth of analysis provided by the delegate concerning the proposals or discussions. This serves as a metric to assess whether the delegate takes the time to thoroughly meditate on the discussion and demonstrates attention to the details. Key elements include solid arguments, relevant questions, and thorough reasoning.\n* **Timing:** Considers when the delegate provides feedback, rewarding those who provide feedback earlier, as long as they meet the above criteria. Note that feedback will be considered as provided before on-chain/off-chain voting if it was published before the day voting starts at 00:00 UTC.\n* **Clarity and Communication:** this is a review of the clarity, structured communication, and overall readability of the delegate’s feedback. Clear and well-written feedback is rewarded.\n* **Impact on Decision-Making:** While the proposer ultimately decides whether to incorporate feedback, high-quality feedback from a delegate often influences the final proposal that goes to vote. This criterion evaluates whether the delegate’s feedback tends to drive changes in proposals/discussions.\n* **Presence in Discussions:** This is a more quantitative analysis, intended to reflect the effort of delegates who participate in most discussions. This parameter serves as a multiplier to the score obtained across the previous five criteria. Note that the percentage of participation in monthly discussions could be not linear across all DAO’s discussions. Some proposals may carry more weight in the overall discussions (special cases such as LTIPP/STIP, gaming, treasury, etc.).\n\n#### [](#p-57276-monthly-evaluation-process-24)**Monthly Evaluation Process**\n\n**1. Data Collection**: At the end of the month, the complete set of contributions by each delegate across all discussions on the forum is reviewed.\n\n**2. Overall Evaluation:** The rubric is used to assess the delegate’s overall performance on each criterion, based on a holistic view of their participation.\n\n**3. Score Assignment:** A level of 1 to 4 is assigned to each criterion, based on the consistency and quality of the delegate’s contributions over the month. Each level has an assigned score, from 1 to 4.\n\n**4. Monthly Report:** A qualitative and quantitative report summarizing the delegate’s performance over the month is then produced.\n\n#### [](#p-57276-scoring-methodology-25)**Scoring Methodology**\n\nEach rubric criterion has levels with an assigned score, from 1 to 4, depending on the level achieved.\n\nThe initial score is obtained by adding the first five criteria, while the final score results from applying the “Presence in Discussions” multiplier to the initial average score. The maximum Initial Score is 20 points and 30 points for the Final Score.\n\nFor illustrative purposes, here’s an example:\n\n* Relevance: Level 3 - Scoring achieved = 3\n* Depth of Analysis: Level 2 - Scoring achieved = 2\n* Timing: Level 4 - Scoring achieved = 4\n* Clarity and Communication: Level 2 - Scoring achieved = 2\n* Impact on Decision-Making: Level 3 - Scoring achieved = 3\n\n**Initial Score/Average: 70% or 14/20 or 2.8/4**\n\n* Participation in Discussions: Level 2 - Multiplier assigned: 1.10x\n\n**Final Score: 70% x 1.1 = 77% or 23.1/30 Delegates’ Feedback points.**\n\n#### [](#p-57276-trade-offs-26)**Trade-offs**\n\nWe are aware that this proposed solution introduces trust assumptions regarding the Program Administrator’s criteria for evaluating feedback. We view this layer of subjectivity as inevitable until we can implement automated tools, such as the AI that Karma is developing, to assess the quality of delegate feedback. It is important to note that, as Program Administrators, after analyzing proposals and feedback for the last six months, we have gained experience that (we believe) will help us correctly identify constructive feedback.\n\nAt SEEDGov, we are committed to being as transparent as possible, as we have been thus far. Therefore, the rubric and the monthly report will always be publicly accessible to all interested parties. During this phase, feedback from Arbitrum DAO will also be crucial in helping us refine our evaluation criteria.\n\n#### [](#p-57276-next-steps-regarding-feedback-27)**Next steps regarding Feedback**\n\nDuring the first iteration of this delegate program, we have been closely monitoring forum activity, particularly during the feedback stage of various proposals. As this phase was a trial, we primarily focused on observing certain dynamics within the forum to better understand them and make adjustments for the next iteration.\n\nOne of the issues we identified is the use of AI to comment on proposals. While the use of AI for tasks such as translating text or correcting grammatical errors is understandable, we have seen instances where it has been employed to generate feedback based on other users’ comments. This has not been a widespread or alarming issue but, in the next iteration, we plan to take a more reactive approach.\n\nAnother issue we have encountered is regarding users who post “Reserved for later comment.” We want to clarify that we do not recommend or encourage such practices, which should preferably be avoided.\n\nIn this iteration, we will try to provide feedback to delegates on this type of situation.\n\n### [](#p-57276-experimental-nature-of-the-new-delegates-feedback-scoring-system-28)Experimental nature of the new delegates’ feedback scoring system.\n\nDue to the experimental nature of this new scoring system, it will be in a testing phase, and we, as Administrators, commit to **submitting it to the DAO for consultation after three months of running the program.**\n\n### [](#p-57276-scoring-weight-changes-29)Scoring Weight Changes\n\nAfter observing delegate behavior and some internal discussions, we believe it is necessary to adjust specific parameters of the program:\n\n**Participation Rate (PR)**\n\n* **Change**: Previously weighted at 20% and based on historical participation rates in Tally. Now, it is reduced to 15%, calculated based on the participation rate of the last 90 days in on-chain votes (as calculated by Karma).\n* **Motivation:** The 90-day participation rate is a requirement for delegates to register in the program. Unlike the historical rate, this parameter is more accessible, so we have decided to lower its weight.\n\n**Snapshot Voting (SV)**\n\n* **Change:** The weight of this parameter has increased from 15% to 20%.\n* **Motivation:** Snapshot voting is a crucial part of the governance process. It is essential to give it more weight to encourage delegates to vote in snapshots.\n\n**Communicating Rationale (CR)**\n\n* **Change:** The weight of this parameter has decreased from 25% to 10%.\n* **Motivation:** While providing a rationale for votes is important, we consider the feedback period even more crucial. Therefore, we have reduced the weight of Communicating Rationale and increased the weight of Delegates’ Feedback.\n\n**Delegates’ Feedback (DF)**\n\n* **Change:** The weight of this parameter has increased from 15% to 30%.\n* **Motivation:** Providing feedback on forum proposals is fundamental. We have raised this parameter’s weight above others and introduced a rubric to evaluate the feedback qualitatively. These changes are detailed further above.\n\n**Total Participation (TP)**\n\n* **Change:** The requirement for total participation has increased from +60% to +65%.\n* **Motivation:** After analyzing the program’s results, we observed that some delegates with high historical participation in Tally could meet the +60% requirement by voting on 100% of monthly proposals. We have decided to raise the TP requirement to +65% for compensation to encourage more contributions in the forum.\n\n**Bonus Point (BP)**\n\n* **Change:** Adding Bonus Points for delegates who attend the “[Arbitrum Governance Report Call](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/19th-grc-governance-reporting-call-on-wednesday-september-25th-at-2pm-utc/26901)” (monthly) and the “[Open Discussion of Proposal(s) - Bi-weekly Governance Call](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/governance/biweekly-proposals-discussions-call/46).”\n  * For the monthly call, 2.5% BP will be awarded for attendance.\n  * For the bi-weekly calls, 2.5% BP will be awarded for attending each call.\n* **Motivation**: We have received several questions about delegate participation in calls or working groups. While there is a trend to compensate work within specific WGs (and we want to avoid potential double spending by the DAO), we find it interesting to experiment with the idea of awarding Bonus Points to delegates who participate in both the “[Arbitrum Governance Report Call](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/19th-grc-governance-reporting-call-on-wednesday-september-25th-at-2pm-utc/26901)” (monthly) and the “[Open Discussion of Proposal(s) - Bi-weekly Governance Call](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/governance/biweekly-proposals-discussions-call/46)”. We will continue to manage this parameter as in the previous program. Although it was a topic of discussion, we have yet to receive complaints about how these points were awarded. We welcome any feedback from the DAO.\n\n### [](#p-57276-details-terminology-symbols-and-formulas-30)Details: Terminology, Symbols, and Formulas\n\n* **Activity Weight (%):** Represents the weight assigned to each key activity to be measured in delegates.\n* **Participation Rate - 90 days (PR90) - Weight 15:** Percentage of the total participation of the member in votes in the last 90 days.

Based on this experience, we anticipate the following work for the upcoming year:\n\n1. **Infrastructure Maintenance and Expenses:** We will continue to ensure that the dashboard operates smoothly, with real-time data updates for most metrics and daily overall calculations. This includes regular software maintenance, such as updating libraries and other necessary tasks to keep the system secure and efficient.\n2. **Ongoing Collaboration with SEEDGov:** Regular calls with the SEEDGov team over the past six months have been instrumental in maintaining the program’s smooth operation. These meetings have allowed us to address bugs, resolve data discrepancies, and implement enhancements based on administrative needs. We will continue these calls to ensure ongoing improvements in operational efficiency.\n3. **Compensation Calculation Logic Updates:** As outlined in the new proposal, we will implement necessary changes to the compensation calculation logic. This includes introducing a tier system, adjusting weights and metrics, and incorporating a 90-day calculation period.\n4. **Automation of Voting Statistics:** Our current system fully automates voting statistics, streamlining the process for admins to determine compensation. Collecting data on Communication Rationale and Proposal Feedback has historically been time-consuming. A few months ago, we introduced an MVP that automates this process using LLM tools. We plan to continue enhancing this feature to further assist administrators.\n5. **Verification of Statistics:** All statistics need to be verified for accuracy in a timely manner, specifically by the first of each month. We will continue to ensure that this verification process is completed on schedule to maintain the reliability of the data.\n\n### [](#p-57276-program-manager-seedgov-40)Program Manager (SEEDGov)\n\n#### [](#p-57276-responsibilities-41)**Responsibilities**\n\nIn the first iteration of the DIP, we encountered additional tasks that were not anticipated when drafting the proposal, which required extra effort to meet the program’s requirements.

      "title": "[Non-Constitutional] Arbitrum Token Swap Pilot Program",
      "content": "## Abstract\nThe Arbitrum Token Swap Pilot proposal is the next step toward the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of ecosystem support programs in the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nIn this initial pilot phase, we prioritize mature protocols on Arbitrum, the so-called Arbitrum Blue Chips, of which 19 have been identified. The pilot aims to swap with 3-7, with a maximum swap budget of 2M ARB and a cap of 0.5M ARB per project.\n\nWe foresee token swaps as a complimentary mechanism to the current incentive programs for Arbitrum DAO to participate in the development and success of its ecosystem projects.\n\n## Motivation\nOne of the primary limitations of the initial incentive programs is that they were all one-directional, with Arbitrum treasury allocating ARB to projects and only receiving network transaction revenue in return. While project growth resulting in additional network activity does provide some upside for Arbitrum treasury, the effects will likely take years to accrue to a point where the net resources flow of the Treasury is positive, only once Arbitrum and the applications on top reach maturity.\n\nToken swaps provide a robust mechanism for value alignment and bidirectional upside between organizations. In addition to potential financial benefits, they come with governance and utility perks associated with tokens.\n\nMoreover, Treasure DAO’s recent move from Arbitrum to ZKsync has shown that bidirectional, long-term alignment is even more critical, especially for protocols that play an essential role in the ArbitrumDAO ecosystem and have received significant ARB incentives.\n\nBy embedding Token Swaps as a vital element of Arbitrum Ecosystem Development and critical programs such as LTIP, Arbitrum can continue pro-actively incentivizing ecosystem growth while receiving additional upside and leverage in the most promising project’s building in its ecosystem.\n\nThe detailed Token Swaps to DAO Token Swaps as Ecosystem Enablers report, 5produced by LuukDAO and JashFi through the Thank ARB Firestarters Program powered by Thrive Protocol, offers insights from over 50 DAO token swaps, which are the basis for this pilot proposal.\n\n## Rationale\n*The Token Swap Pilot contributes to Arbitrum DAO by:*\n\n* Increase bi-directional alignment with top ecosystem projects.\n* Gain valuable insights into strategies for ecosystem development, which can inform grant and incentive programs like STIP and LTIPP.\n* Create incentives for protocols to remain loyal to Arbitrum through a token swap program. In the pilot phase, reward those who held on to (at least 50%) of their initial ARB airdrop.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n*Projects eligible for a swap*\n\nDuring the initial Token Swap discussion, it became clear that stakeholders and delegates value the ecosystem alignment and contribution nearly as much as the financial upside. To optimize Arbitrum ecosystem alignment and longevity, the Token Swap Pilot prioritizes projects with significant past engagement with Arbitrum.\n\nOnly projects that received the initial ARB airdrop and still hold at least 50% of their tokens, participated in one of the STIP or LTIPP programs, and have a token available on Arbitrum Mainnet will be eligible for this pilot.\n\n19 projects that fall within this category have been identified. These projects still hold over 27,2M ARB in their treasury and have received significant rewards from the incentive programs. Projects outside of the group of 19 can demonstrate their eligibility.\n\nAny project that does not fall within the above categories will not be eligible for the Arbitrum Token Swaps Pilot. Still, if the pilot is successful, it may be an addition to future grant programs and expanded to prior STIP or LTIPP grantees.\n\n**To determine the exact swap size, the following parameters will be considered by the Committee members:**\n\nAirdrop Size:\nAirdrop % Sold:\nIncentive Rewards received:\nMarket Cap:\nFDV:\nLifetime Fees Generated:\n6 month Fees Generated:\nLifetime GAS consumed:\n6 month GAS consumed:\n% of protocol usage on Arbitrum:\nProject Treasury Size currently:\nToken Pool depth on Arbitrum:\nToken Utility:\nARB utility plan:\n\nSwaps will be executed through Hedgey Finance’s Token Swap solution, the most used DAO token swap solution.\n\n**Note: If insufficient projects are willing to participate in the exchange, we’ll explore alternative eligibility requirements and submit an additional Snapshot vote to ratify these changes.**\n\n## Token Swap Budget\nThe Arbitrum Token Swap Pilot will have a Token Swap budget of up to 2M ARB, which the Pilot Council will manage through the MSS multi-sig.\n\n* The initial pilot program is anticipated to conduct between 3-7 token swaps.\n* Each swap is capped at a maximum of 500,000 ARB, comparable to some previous swaps executed on Arbitrum One by GMX and its partners.\n* The minimum swap size will be 100,000 ARB.\n\n*Non-Sales Clause*\nArbitrum DAO and the third-party DAO will swap tokens with a 3-month lock. After the three month lock, the tokens will unlock 10% monthly for ten months. If no Arbitrum Treasury Management team is in place within nine months of executing the token swaps, the Pilot team will propose a solution for managing these tokens before they unlock.\n\nAll tokens received by Arbitrum will be kept in its main Treasury (0xF3FC178157fb3c87548bAA86F9d24BA38E649B58).\n\n## Pilot Program Implementation (timeline)\n\n*The Token Swap Pilot Council*\nThe initiative will comprise 3 voting members and 1 non-voting facilitating member.\n\nThe following 3 voting members are nominated as they provide a deep understanding of ArbitrumDAO and Token swaps.\n\n@LuukDAO, for producing the initial research and various Token Swaps programs\n@GFXlabs, for being an active LTIPP and STEP Council member\n@CastleCapital, for doing in-depth airdrop research and being an application advisor in LTIPP.\n\nThe non-voting member (except in case of a tie) will be Arbitrum Treasury and Sustainability WG, lead by @thedevanshmehta, who supervised the token swap research and performed a similar role in the STEP program.\n\n \n![Screenshot 2024-10-17 at 12.32.43 PM.png](ipfs://bafybeicm566ffdhysffcre4hwetcyuzevzv65e4mowilffslj2ys5f6vxe)\n    \n\n*Conflict of interest rules*\nThe dealmakers are not allowed to be involved in a token swap if they have direct or indirect exposure to the counterparty; this includes holding over 0,001% of the total supply of the token personally or through the affiliated company and having a direct, active working relationship with this protocol.\n\n## Program KPIs\nThis pilot’s objective is to better understand the impact and logistics of DAO token swaps as a value-alignment tool for growing Arbitrum DAO’s ecosystem.\nThe following KPIs are identified for the pilot:\n\n* Execute at least three swaps and document the process and learnings\n* Gain a better understanding of the change of behavior and perception of ecosystem players following a token swap with Arbitrum DAO\n* Provide a comprehensive summary of the pilot and support future incentive programs, allowing them to leverage Token Swaps in their program design.\n\n## Overall Cost\nTotal Cost: 2,130,000 ARB\n\n* Token Swap Budget: 2,000,000 ARB. The entire budget does not need to be spent. Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO.\nImplementation Budget: 130,000 ARB. All staff involved are paid 3,500 ARB per week for their involvement.\n\n1. Application period: 21,000 ARB will be split equally between LuukDAO and Devansh for drafting the application form in week 1, and helping protocols apply in weeks 2 and 3.\n2. Review period: 56,000 ARB, split equally between all four committee members for four weeks, to negotiate token swap deals and put forth recommendations for approval on snapshot.\n3. Execution (~6 weeks) and monitoring period (~10 weeks) to formulate continuation of the program - 53,000 ARB to 1 member (LuukDAO).\n\n*Work on this proposal was funded through the Thank ARB Firestarters Program powered by Thrive Protocol*",

      "content": "![photo_2024-10-17_12-36-01.jpg](ipfs://bafybeifv4ub663gsvifkv225zx76lnrgkldpoytzckxnjqdoxz2cf2ovpi)\n\n## A brief summary of the changes carried out include:\n* Retainer Model (Cost-Effectiveness): One-third of the total cap allocated to each working member’s role will be paid upfront, covering the first 1/3 set of hours.The remaining two-thirds of the cap is tied to project-based deliverables and will be paid in phases: 50% upon commencement of each task, and the final 50% upon successful completion of the task.\n* Removal of the Operations Lead Position: The responsibilities previously managed by the Operations Lead will now fall under the Supervisory Council’s remit.\n* Removal of Hats Protocol: No longer included in the proposed framework, saving 45,000 ARB in costs.\n* Extension Option for the ARDC Term: Introducing the possibility to extend the ARDC’s term by an additional six (6) months, pending approval through a Snapshot proposal. This brings the potential total term to one (1) year.\n* Funding Structure Revision: A restructuring of the funding approach to better align with the updated objectives and framework.\n* Supervisory Council Composition: The Supervisory Council will have responsibilities at both macro and micro levels, ensuring comprehensive oversight, strategic alignment, and effective day-to-day operations. At the micro level, two (2) of the elected members will focus on communications and one (1) will focus on operations.\n* Supervisory Council Elections: Candidates will specify their preferred roles in the application form, but a single general election snapshot will still be conducted as initially proposed. If multiple top-ranking candidates choose the same role, the highest-ranking ones are selected for that role, while others are redirected to fill alternative roles based on their preferences.\n\n## 1. The Supervisory Council: Governance and Strategic Oversight\nOne of the key structural changes in ARDC V2 is the establishment of a Supervisory Council. The Council replaces the previous DAOAdvocate role in ARDC V1 and the proposed role of the Operations Lead, aiming to distribute governance responsibilities more equitably and improve both macro and micro-level oversight. This move is designed to enhance the strategic alignment of the ARDC with the ArbitrumDAO's long-term objectives, ensuring that resources are efficiently managed and that the working members remain accountable.\n\nThe Supervisory Council will be composed of three elected members, each with distinct roles:\n* Two members will focus on communications, ensuring clear and consistent information sharing between the ARDC, the ArbitrumDAO, and external stakeholders such as OffChain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n* One member will focus on operations, managing day-to-day activities, overseeing financial transactions, and maintaining operational transparency.\n\nEach member will serve a six-month term, with the potential for a six-month extension, depending on the outcome of a Snapshot vote. The introduction of the Council helps bridge the gap between the high-level strategic goals of the DAO and the granular operational needs of the ARDC, allowing for more nuanced management and decision-making. The Supervisory Council will also handle conflict resolution, oversee communication strategies, and mediate between the ARDC and DAO in case of disputes, ensuring that activities remain aligned with the DAO's best interests.\n\n## 2. The Retainer Model: Aligning Incentives with Deliverables\nAnother important improvement in ARDC V2 is the Retainer Model, which aims to reduce the risk of underutilization and misaligned incentives by directly tying payments to project needs. In this model, working members are compensated based on the hours they spend delivering on their tasks, rather than receiving a lump-sum payment upfront. The model follows a structured payment plan:\n* One-third of the total cap allocated to each working member’s role will be paid upfront, covering the first 1/3 set of hours.\n* The remaining two-thirds of the cap is tied to project-based deliverables and will be paid in phases: 50% upon commencement of each task, and the final 50% upon successful completion of the task.\n\nBy requiring applicants to submit hourly rates in their applications, the ARDC incentivizes competitive pricing and ensures that funds are allocated efficiently. The Supervisory Council oversees this process, approving deliverables and tracking the use of working hours to ensure that tasks are being completed as required. This model also mitigates the risk of \"pre-paid\" work not delivering the corresponding value, a challenge encountered during ARDC V1.\n\n## 3. Funding Structure and Extension Mechanics\nARDC V2’s funding structure has been designed with flexibility in mind, allowing the DAO to control costs while still maintaining robust operational capacity. The proposal outlines three funding options—Options A, B, and C—each corresponding to different caps for the Security, Research, and Risk verticals. These options offer varying degrees of financial commitment, allowing the DAO to choose the level of funding that best matches its needs and risk tolerance:\n* Option A allocates $1.73 million USDC for operations.\n* Option B allocates $2.09 million USDC, serving as a middle-ground option.\n* Option C allocates $2.60 million USDC for larger-scale operations.\n\nEach option includes compensation for the Supervisory Council, set at 90,000 ARB across the 6-month term (approx. $46,800 USD at the time of the proposal). The Snapshot voting system will allow the community to decide whether to fund the ARDC under one of these options, abstain, or reject the proposal outright.\n\nFurthermore, the extension mechanics give the DAO flexibility in deciding whether to continue with the ARDC after its initial term. At the end of the 6-month term, the DAO will have the following choices through a Snapshot vote:\n* Extend the ARDC with the same working members.\n* Extend the ARDC with a re-election of working members.\n* Choose not to extend the ARDC.\n\nIf the DAO opts not to extend the ARDC, any unutilized USDC and ARB will be returned to the Treasury, ensuring that funds are not wasted.\n\n## 4. Aera’s Protocol-Owned Execution: Streamlining Fund Management\nTo mitigate volatility and optimize the conversion of ARB into USDC for operational purposes, ARDC V2 will utilize Aera’s Protocol-Owned Execution strategy. This innovative fund management solution employs off-chain logic to monitor on-chain liquidity, model price impact, and execute trades in a way that minimizes slippage and market disruption.\n\nUsing  @aerafinance Vault —guarded by @gauntlet_xyz—ARB tokens will be converted to USDC through @odosprotocol and @bebop_dex, decentralized execution platforms designed for efficient liquidity sourcing.\n\nThe strategy leverages both active and passive execution techniques:\n* Passive execution involves setting concentrated ARB positions in an ARB/USDC liquidity pool, effectively creating limit orders to optimize the conversion process.\n* Active execution takes place during optimal market conditions, as determined by Aera’s price impact modeling, which tracks intraday and medium-term price effects of trades.\n\nThis dual approach ensures that the ARB-into-USDC conversion process is as cost-effective as possible, reducing the risk of adverse market impacts and preserving the value of the DAO’s assets.\n\n## 5. Risk, Security, and Research Seats: Building on ARDC V1\nIn ARDC V2, three specialized roles—Risk, Security, and Research—will build upon the foundations established during ARDC V1. These roles are designed to bring targeted expertise to critical areas of the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring focused attention on risk management, security, and research, which were key in delivering the 43 important outputs during ARDC V1 produced by @blockworksres, @chaos_labs & @OpenZeppelin\n\n1. Risk Seat: Ensuring Protocol Safety\nThe Risk Member focuses on evaluating and mitigating risks within DeFi protocols. This builds on work from ARDC V1, where Chaos Labs conducted risk analyses on protocols like @vertex_protocol and @pendle_fi , providing insights on economic efficiency and systemic health. In V2, the Risk Member will continue this work, offering quantitative risk assessments and strategic guidance on managing potential threats in the ecosystem.\n\n2. Security Seat: Fortifying Governance and Contracts\nThe Security Member ensures smart contracts and governance mechanisms are secure, expanding on the significant security evaluations performed by OpenZeppelin in ARDC V1. Their work will focus on bug detection, fuzz testing, and ensuring governance upgrades are secure—similar to ARDC V1’s BOLD Security Analysis and Arbitrum Governor V2 Review.\n\n3. Research Seat: Data-Driven Insights\nThe Research Member will provide objective, data-driven analysis on key topics like sequencers and fraud proofs, echoing the work done by @delphi_digital and @blockworksres in ARDC V1. Research outputs will support governance decisions and help guide the DAO's strategic direction, just as V1 delivered insights like the Arbitrum DAO Treasury Research and analysis of STIP programs.\n\n### Interplay Between These Seats\nTogether, the Risk, Security, and Research members form the backbone of ARDC V2’s specialized expertise. By focusing on their respective verticals, these members ensure that the ArbitrumDAO is equipped to handle the complex challenges of the DeFi ecosystem, from managing risks and securing smart contracts to fostering a data-driven approach to governance and innovation.\n\nThe Supervisory Council will oversee the performance of each of these members, ensuring that their work aligns with the strategic priorities of the ArbitrumDAO. Furthermore, this structure allows for flexibility in allocating resources to the most pressing tasks, whether those relate to immediate security concerns, risk management, or long-term research initiatives.",

      "title": "Enhancing Multichain Governance: Upgrading RARI Governance Token on Arbitrum",
      "content": "## [](#p-55784-abstract-1)Abstract\n\nThe RARI DAO seeks to enhance its governance framework by upgrading the RARI token contract and bringing its governance from Ethereum mainnet to the Arbitrum ecosystem. This proposal requests to regirster a custom gateway for a new RARI L2 token contract via Arbitrum native bridge, as only the Arbitrum DAO can implement this change. The custom gateway will enable more efficient governance processes with the upgraded token, reduce user costs, and improve overall accessibility for RARI DAO.\n\n## [](#p-55784-motivation-2)Motivation\n\nRARI DAO is governed by the $RARI token, which when locked in veRARI grants voting access. The current token contract is on Ethereum mainnet and is not upgradable. The RARI DAO wishes to upgrade its governance, a part of which is a token contract upgrade with snapshots and delegations embedded. Only the Arbitrum DAO can however set up the mapping of L1 → L2 token addresses in the custom gateway (which is controlled by Arbitrum DAO) on the Arbitrum native bridge. Here is more information about the topic: [ERC-20 token bridging | Arbitrum Docs](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/token-bridge-erc20#setting-up-your-token-with-the-generic-custom-gateway)\n\n## [](#p-55784-rationale-3)Rationale\n\nThe RARI DAO multichain governance upgrade is designed to make governance more accessible, by simplifying the UX, reducing gas fees, and enabling new token functions. This aligns with Artbitrum’s commitment to user-centricity and technical inclusivity.\n\nWith a custom L2 token implementation we will be able to perform the RARI DAO governance upgrade and move our governance fully into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n## [](#p-55784-key-terms-4)Key Terms\n\nRARI token: RARI DAO governance token ([$1.95 | Rarible (RARI) Token Tracker | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfca59cd816ab1ead66534d82bc21e7515ce441cf)\n\nRARI DAO: body governing the Rarible Protocol and RARI chain\n\nCustom L2 RARI token: upgraded and simplified RARI token to be used in RARI DAO multichain governance moving forward\n\n## [](#p-55784-specifications-5)Specifications\n\nRARI token in question ([$1.95 | Rarible (RARI) Token Tracker | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfca59cd816ab1ead66534d82bc21e7515ce441cf)) does not have upgradability nor allows the owner to register in the Arbitrum token bridge router.\n\nAs such, we’re requesting a custom L2 token implementation and using the (standard) custom gateway. Lacking the ability to upgrade / owner-register, we are seeking Artbirum DAO’s approval to register the upgraded RARI token to the custom gateway so we can proceed with the custom L2 implementation.\n\n**The upgraded token contract was fully audited and can be found here:** [https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/pull/305](https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/pull/305)**.**\n\nToken contract was deployed first in tetnests and then to Arbitrum One, and RARI chain (which is on top of Arbitrum One). All contracts were tested manually as well.\n\nRARI DAO voted in favor of the upgraded token: [Tally | Rari DAO | RRC 30 - Enhancing RARI DAO Governance: Plan for upgrade](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/rari-foundation/proposal/85102068202527969889208024703113668965813715410446115075088330064807449302588)\n\nThe executable code to create the custom gateway was prepared by Offchain Labs and can be found [HERE](https://arbitrum.notion.site/Public-Rari-Token-Register-Executable-3914a05c5bf94323a3d0d88abcc6576b?pvs=25).\nThe code was fully audited by Trail of Bits: [https://rari-foundation.notion.site/Trail-of-Bits-Audit-for-Arbitrum-Native-Bridge-Custom-Pathway-1124e8bfb53f8017842cf3b94cf8045b](https://rari-foundation.notion.site/Trail-of-Bits-Audit-for-Arbitrum-Native-Bridge-Custom-Pathway-1124e8bfb53f8017842cf3b94cf8045b)\n\n\n\n## [](#p-55784-steps-to-implement-6)Steps to Implement\n\n1. Deploy token contracts on Arbitrum and RARI chains (done)\n2. Security audit of the proposed code change (done)\n3. Change mapping for L1 → L2 tokens on bridge router and custom gateway (This can be done only by Arbitrum DAO)\n\n## [](#p-55784-timeline-7)Timeline\n\nImplementation upon the proposal’s execution.\n\n## [](#p-55784-overall-costs-8)Overall costs\n\nN/A",

      "content": "# ArbitrumDAO strategic “Off-site” (online) updated proposal\n\nNon-Constitutional\n\n## Context\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of the directional proposal for an offsite which was voted in favour with 130mn ARB in Snapshot: [ArbitrumDAO Off-site - Directional proposal 8](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrumdao-off-site-directional-proposal/25660)\n\nAnd a following proposal where an Online format came on top [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x8f242363dbc69d640799b461b27ba7b957ab13af87389b699639ba335b8b5e91)\n\nThe proposal has been streamlined based on feedback and is designed to be independent but compatible with related initiatives such as Alex’s work on coordination and emergent conversations with Disruption Joe, etc. The proposal also stays clear of areas where Entropy is already working and builds upon previous work (e.g. mission and values draft).\n\nThere were concerns about potential overlap with GovHack and we have aligned this initiative so both could be complimentary. However, [the HackHumanity team has announced they won’t be organising an event for Devcon 1](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-devcon-in-bangkok-hack-humanity/26634/71).\n\nOffcylce voting: this proposal was planned to be launched on Tally yesterday. Due to some unforeseen coordination around the MSS, we couldn't post until confirming the compliance procedure with the foundation. In the interest of being ableThanksgivingto start this initiative in October and due to multiple constraints in November (DevCon, ThanksGiving), we're posting on Tuesday. Please accept our apologies for any disruption.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to enhance the alignment, communication, and collaboration among token holders (including delegates). The DAO currently struggles with achieving cohesive strategies due to sporadic interactions and a lack of direct engagement among key participants. To address this, a structured process will be organized in October (before DevCon), focusing on strategic alignment sessions.\n\nThis proposal includes:\n\n* Stakeholder management (preparation and follow-up): delegates and key stakeholders outreach and sense-making process to scope and prepare the most important agenda items to be discussed during two online workshops (building upon the survey and analysis already carried out). And post-workshops follow-up on key action items, including snapshot vote to ratify decisions.\n* Facilitation: design and execution of a strategic process to advance alignment, convergence, and prioritization, ensuring clear next steps.\n* Coordination: with Entropy to build on top of the work on mission, vision, and values; and with with additional emergent initiatives (e.g. Joe and Disruption Joe proposal in the works and potential future proposals by HackHumanity and others).\n\nThe key deliverable is an online strategy process to define a shortlist of priorities for the DAO over the next 6 months.\n\nThe success of this initiative will be measured quantitatively by the NPS given by participants, and qualitatively by the outcomes and outputs from the sessions. The key outcome is a ratified decision on priorities via Snapshot vote.\n\n## The Problem\n\nThe DAO encounters multiple challenges, but a critical issue is the lack of effective communication and alignment among delegates and key stakeholders. There are many calls, but attendance is not concentrated and the calls are designed for context sharing and informal discussion, not designed for a strategic process. This results in a gap in aigment and clear and explicit strategy, causing slow decision-making.\n\nAreas such as organizational design and strategic planning require not only well-crafted proposals but also thorough stakeholder engagement. Beyond what can be achieved in an event, these areas require multiple steps of aligment on frameworks and approaches, sense-making, structured deliberation, and ratifying decisions.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n**Output:**\n\nDraft of DAO priorities for the next 6 months that’s put to a Snapshot vote.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\nThe priorities provide alignment and enable the whole community to rally around key priorities, unblocking the DAO.\n\n**The proposal includes:**\n\\*The exact format will be refined during phase 1 in coordination with other initiatives and delegates.\n\n1. Agenda prioritisation (pre-event alignment) and sense-making.\n\n* Project manager to engage with token holders, delegates, and key stakeholders, distilling concerns and topic suggestions, and facilitating converging on the exact agenda and framework.\n* Careful planning of each session: aiming to share and agree on frameworks and approaches in advance, focusing IRL discussion on content and not format. This is a continuation of the work started in December with the pre-proposal for a strategy framework.\n\n1. Strategy Sprint: 2 week process combining live and asynchronous components to integrate broad community input and feedback, deep dives by representative stakeholders, and converging towards a clear list.\n\n* Onboarding participants into the framework and using a collective intelligence tool to generate and organise an initial list of priorities. (asynchronous, 1h)\n* Online workshops to review the initial list, carry a root cause analysis, and argue pros/cons of different priorities.

As such, good facilitation makes a critical difference in ensuring the process is effective. The facilitation includes designing the workshops and moderating the conversation, AND engaging with the broader community to gather input and synthethise it.\n\n### Agenda\n\nWe’ve already started the process of setting the agenda. We ran a survey, answered by 29 delegates with 86mn+ ARB represented. And then ran SimScore (a collective intelligence algorithm) to cluster responses and identify the key topics. The results are presented below to encourage further discussion.\n\nPre-selection of topics in ranked order:\n\n* Defining strategic priorities for the DAO\n* DAO Budget (how much should the DAO be spending)\n* Org Design\n* ARB token utility\n* Conflict Of Interest\n* Grant programs (RPGF, what should be the focus, outcomes, etc.)",

      "title": "Establishing a DAO Events Budget for 2025",
      "content": "This description has been shortened to meet Snapshot character limits. Please find the full proposal on the forums: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/establishing-a-dao-events-budget-for-2025/26734\n\n## Abstract\n\nTo ensure Arbitrum’s continued presence at the industry’s most prominent events, and to enable the DAO to host in-person initiatives to accelerate collaboration and increase efficiency of operations, we (Entropy Advisors, the ADPC, and Disruption Joe) would like to earmark a budget for events for 2025 and take lead on running ongoing RFPs to satisfy the DAOs event demands. The 3 members of this group will lean on OCL and the Arbitrum Foundation to ensure that any events organized by the DAO are aligned with the broader ecosystem of contributors, work towards a unified message/brand, and are synergistic with events led by the Foundation and OCL.\n\nOur proposed Events strategy should focus on 2 key categories:\n\n1. Delegate Gatherings aimed at streamlining operations through in-person meetups such as a delegate retreat.\n2. Ecosystem Growth Events to foster innovation and community engagement, ideally coinciding with other major crypto conferences (specifically ETHDenver, Bitcoin 2025: Las Vegas, EthCC, among other potential events) at the same location. These events can include, but are not limited to:\n\n  * Virtual hackathons\n  * Non-crypto conference presence (RustConf, CES, etc.)\n  * In-person hackathons\n  * Side events\n  * Sponsorships of major events\n  * Arbitrum Days around the world (not just EthCC)\n  * Educational workshops (Stylus & Orbit)\n\nThe selection of event provider(s) will follow a two-step process: Together with the ADPC and Disruption Joe, we will gauge community sentiment/attendance levels regarding certain events. If there is consensus to put on a certain event but there is no PM/event coordinator to lead the effort, the group will procure, select, and support service providers to make the vision a reality. It is highly likely the OCL or the Arbitrum Foundation will lead many of these events, which is made apparent by the preliminary schedule proposed below. Alternatively, if an events provider comes to the DAO with a proposal for an event that passes a Snapshot vote that garners at least 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority For/Abstain, the funds for that proposal will come from the 2025 events budget brought forth in this proposal.\n\nWe propose the earmarking of $1.5M USD to fund this initiative, with any unused funds at the end of 2025 to be returned to the DAO treasury. 4M ARB will be sent to a Foundation-controlled address to be liquidated into stablecoins, with any excess ARB immediately returned to the DAO treasury and the stablecoins to an MSS-controlled address. The ADPC, Entropy, and Disruption Joe will be waiving payment to get this stood up, but we expect this initiative to fall under the OpCo once it becomes fully operational. We also envision a dedicated employee to lead the DAO’s event strategy within the OpCo, so this is more of an effort to get the ball rolling so we are properly prepared for 2025. We plan to have the OpCo established in mid 2025, and once an events coordinator is employed by this entity, the funds will be transferred to the OpCo while Entropy, the ADPC, and Disruption Joe will be relieved of their duties thereafter.\n\n## Specifications\n\nIn order to eliminate the potential for event overload, we are capping the number of delegate gatherings to two for the year - but are leaving the number of ecosystem growth events open-ended. These events should be planned in such a way that no two events align too closely with one another on dates, with the exception of delegate offsites which could coincide with an ecosystem growth event at a major crypto conference given the convenience of planning travel arrangements. While the primary goal of delegate offsites should be aligning ecosystem leaders and providing a dedicated place/time for more efficient in-person working hours, the ecosystem growth category is more vague in nature. However, all applicants should have clearly articulated goals for the events in line with the defined events strategy, i.e., driving the adoption of Stylus through a hackathon, generating thought-provoking governance proposals, or onboarding new people into the DAO similar to GovHack. Events brought forward by either an individual or service provider, must create a post-event impact report ([example](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-ethcc-brussels-2024-impact-report-hack-humanity/26530?u=entropy) from Govhack Brussels) that includes a breakdown of actual costs. Service providers that are procured to execute on an event idea will also be required to provide a post-event impact report.\n\nFor concrete examples of how this could work, we can take a look at the 2 proposals for events currently on the forum. The GovHack Core proposal (which has since been rescinded) was brought forth by Hack Humanity, which serves as a great example of a scenario where the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy would not have been needed in the process at all. Hack Humanity could have taken their proposal to Snapshot, and because they were the service provider themselves, there was no need for any type of procurement process. If the GovHack Core proposal passed snapshot with 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain, the funds would be sent from the 2025 events budget (this proposal) and Hack Humanity could have begun their planning. This would eliminate the ~4-week onchain voting process and potentially make it possible to put something together for DevCon in Bangkok in just ~2 months.\n\nThis is a prime example of how earmarking an events budget will enable the DAO to move more nimbly. Please note that this proposal is only for 2025, so the previous example is only provided for illustrative purposes. However, it is quite possible that the DAO would rather fund GovHacks on an as-needed/case-by-case basis rather than a whole year, or even open up the event type to other service providers to get new actors involved or potentially lower the price.\n\nIn an earlier iteration of a proposal from [@danielo](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/danielo), there was no defined offsite facilitator. This is an example of a proposal that did not specify the service provider, so the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy could have worked together in procuring the proper coordinator upon the proposal passing on Snapshot with 3% of the votable token supply and a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain. The procurement process should bring down overall costs by making the process competitive amongst service providers, and again reduces the lead time by foregoing the onchain Tally vote. Note that this is just an example for illustrative purposes.\n\nIt is expected that the contributor requesting a specific event is tasked with defining the measurable KPIs. The DAO will be tasked with deeming a specific events proposal worthwhile via Snapshot, and we encourage delegates to hold these authors to a high standard when it comes to measuring a given event’s impact and how it pushes Arbitrum’s mission forward.\n\n## Flow of Funds\n\nTo cover the $1.5M dollar-denominated expenses, 4M ARB would be earmarked and sent to an Arbitrum Foundation-controlled wallet, with funds liquidated into a preferred stablecoin and then sent to a MSS-controlled address .Surplus ARB will be sent back to the DAO Treasury following the liquidation. Entropy Advisors, Disruption Joe, and the ADPC will be the point of contact for the MSS chair to greenlight any queued transactions. No transactions will be signed without confirmations from all 3 entities/individuals. The MSS may send stablecoins back to the Arbitrum Foundation in order to pay service providers with fiat if required. Excess funds will either be moved over to the OpCo once a dedicated events coordinator has been hired, or fully returned to the DAO by the end of 2025.\n\nUpdates related to funds spent, upcoming events and relevant details, a place to provide feedback or recommendations, or any other communications will be posted to the [ADPC update thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/procurement-committee/27) on the Arbitrum Forum. Alternatively, Entropy can post these to our [updates thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/entropy-advisors-updates/50) on the Arbitrum Forum.\n\n## Steps to Implement and Timeline\n\n1. September 10th: “Establishing a DAO Events Budget for 2025” Forum post (4 weeks)\n2. October 10th: Snapshot Vote\n3. October 24th: Tally vote (If Snapshot passes and depending on feedback)\n4. November 11th: The ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy Advisors can begin working with OCL/the AF and other individuals/SPs to ensure the events calendar brought forth comes to fruition. Dependent on the outcome of the Tally vote.\n\nWe expect this process to take about 2-3 months in its entirety to get underway, which will provide the DAO ample time to prepare for its 2025 events.\n\n## Overall Ask\n\nThe upfront ask to the DAO is $1.5M and the transfer of 4M ARB with the excess returned to the DAO post liquidation, but with just 3 ecosystem growth events outlined in this proposal, the entire budget will not be utilized. However, as mentioned earlier, earmarking these funds gives the DAO the ability to act more nimbly when there is an opportunity to host an event. This will result in the DAO getting better pricing from potential service providers while ensuring the service provider has ample time to do what they do best - organize great events. The DAO can clawback funds from the MSS at any time via a snapshot vote that garners 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain.",

      "title": "[Non-Constitutional] Funds to Bolster Foundation’s Strategic Partnerships Budget ",
      "content": "# Abstract\n\nThis proposal requests 250 million ARB with the main objective to enable The Arbitrum Foundation to further foster key strategic partnerships. All expenditures will follow The Arbitrum Foundation’s well-established practices and evaluation criteria when pursuing partnership deals, as detailed in a high level manner [here](https://arbitrumfoundation.notion.site/Milestones-Guidance-85e628abdb0640f1a3c280fb26e19934) and [here](https://arbitrumfoundation.notion.site/Submission-Guidelines-5250083006c942d1a371ef0a85cd1b24) (these guidelines apply mainly for the Foundation Grant Program, however, it offers insight into what the Foundation looks at when giving strategic grants or establishing strategic partnerships). Should the proposal be approved by the ArbitrumDAO, the Foundation will update its upcoming annual transparency report due in Q1 2025 to include and detail this additional budget.\n\n# Motivation\n\nIn line with its mission as laid out in its [bylaws](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/The%20Arbitrum%20Foundation%20Bylaws%2020%20July%202023-d992cde49b3207e89bdec76322e29048.pdf), The Arbitrum Foundation is committed to fostering ecosystem growth through strategic partnerships. All agreements are designed to support projects that can grow the Arbitrum ecosystem and provide value to the ArbitrumDAO. By seeking projects that advance or contribute to the adoption of Arbitrum technology, the Foundation aims to grow activity on the Arbitrum networks.\n\nAgreements typically last for a few years with the intention to align a project’s interests with the long-term objectives of the Arbitrum ecosystem. This results in significant capital locked in commitments and reserved for projects based on the agreed performance milestones. This restricts the Foundation’s ability to pursue new partnerships and stay ahead of the competition. Given the aggregate size of Foundation’s current budget, it is difficult for us to pursue multiple large deals simultaneously.\n\n# Challenges\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation runs two funding programs:\n\n* Arbitrum Foundation Grant Program\n* Strategic Partnership’s Program\n\nBoth programs invite applicants from the ecosystem while actively pursuing new opportunities by participating in competitive bids to prospective partners. In both cases, The Arbitrum Foundation signs milestone-based agreements with the recipient that are often multi-year contractual commitments. To date, agreements for our strategic partnerships program typically exceed 2M ARB with an average duration of 2.1 years.\n\n*Table: Capital Commitments to Grants, Strategic Partnerships and Infrastructure Service Providers (as of June 30, 2024)*\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/09ddb4e1-283e-43f6-a2b0-38f42d7edc6e_original.png)The above table provides an overview of The Arbitrum Foundation’s outstanding capital commitments since inception, as of June 30th 2024. Based on the stage of commitment, we can classify all existing deals into two categories:\n\n* **Signed agreements.** The Arbitrum Foundation and the grant recipient or service provider have entered into an agreement. Most grant recipients will be entitled to grant payouts as milestones and/or other criteria are reached. The amounts in the table reflect the value of future financial obligations related to signed agreements.\n* **Pre-agreement offer.** An agreement has not yet been reached but is in negotiation. The Foundation has reserved funds to ensure we can act upon the commitment when an agreement is reached. The amounts in the table reflect the full value of the agreement.\n\nIn both cases, The Arbitrum Foundation must have adequate reserves immediately available before it can make an offer to a potential partner. Given the competitive landscape, The Arbitrum Foundation must be able to make multiple offers to different partners at the same time. Also, the Foundation must be prepared for all offers to be accepted and reserve amounts accordingly even if negotiations fail at a later stage.\n\nWith the above in mind, The Arbitrum Foundation is at a distinct disadvantage from extending competitive offers to strategic partners due to the size of our overall allocation from the DAO. The three major financial challenges currently facing The Arbitrum Foundation from extending continued support to ecosystem expansion are:\n\n* **Tight budget.** Relative to competitors, the budget that the Foundation can allocate for strategic partnerships is small and puts the Arbitrum ecosystem at a significant disadvantage. For example, if we consider allocations relative to token supply, Starknet has allocated ~20% to its Foundation and grants, Optimism has 25% for ecosystem funding, ZkSync has 19.9% for ecosystem initiatives, while The Arbitrum Foundation has 7.5% allocated, but to date, The Arbitrum Foundation has only had access to approximately 1.8% because of the vesting contract. Making competitive offers requires a lot of capital that we have not been allocated relative to other Foundations.\n* **Vesting.** The Foundation can only make offers based on the ARB that has vested to date. This is because the ArbitrumDAO can clawback the funds at any time and we must have the ARB available to pay milestones. The Foundation is committed to being solvent at all times, so our assets should always exceed our contractual liabilities.\n* **Capital lockup.** All committed ARB in a milestone-based agreement must be allocated until the agreement terminates. For example, we could run into a situation where a grantee has not yet hit their milestones, but we need to assume they will and hold the potential payout in reserve. Additionally, some agreements require capital lockup (like RWAs), in projects where the funds belong to the Arbitrum Foundation, but they are utilized by the strategic partner’s protocol.\n\nTogether, The Arbitrum Foundation does not yet have access to its full budget which has caused issues over the past year, but even if the vesting was complete, our budget still remains the smallest amongst all rollups. This impacts all programs run by The Arbitrum Foundation including strategic partnerships, technical advancement, educational and community activities.\n\nWe believe the most straightforward approach to ensuring The Arbitrum Foundation can pursue competitive deals is by increasing our budget for strategic partnerships.\n\n# Proposed Solution\n\n**Funding Request:** **250 million ARB**\n\nIn light of the above mentioned challenges, we believe that there are several reasons why increasing our budget to specifically better support strategic partnerships is essential:\n\n* **High costs of pursuing partnerships.** Strategic partnerships are essential for the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth, and these partnerships often come with significant capital investments from the Foundation. For example, onboarding RWAs is both challenging and capital-intensive, as experienced by the DAO as well.\n* **Expanding Orbit Chains.** Despite more than 50 chains publicly announcing their intent to build using Orbit since the launch of the Arbitrum Expansion Program in January 2024, the rollup as a tech stack ecosystem is still in its early stages. Additional funding is required to enable The Arbitrum Foundation to pursue major Orbit partnerships and allow the Arbitrum ecosystem to access new markets, use cases and communities. Additionally we should note that sometimes part Orbit chain grants could be rebates on the revenue that they contribute to the Arbitrum DAO, creating a mismatch between the Arbitrum Foundation allocating resources and the DAO collecting chain fees.\n* **Gateway to DAO.** The DAO has previously contributed to onboarding partners via programs like STEP, however, the experience has been that most institutions are not inclined toward engaging and participating in public forums, and even when they do it is after extensive conversations with The Arbitrum Foundation and its service providers, who are making them aware of the opportunities and encouraging them to get involved. As front line enablers, The Arbitrum Foundation actively builds relationships with partners and encourages all partners to engage with the DAO. Most recent examples include Securitize (via BlackRock BUIDL) and Franklin Templeton.\n* **Proven track record.** The Foundation has a proven track record of managing and allocating funds effectively for various initiatives, as evidenced by the [2024 Biannual Progress Report](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/ArbitrumFoundationBiannualReport2024H1-c8e9ab997fe68ad09c0105181f9826d8.pdf) and successful collaborations with industry leading projects. Additionally, The Arbitrum Foundation has capitalized on emerging opportunities such as LRTs, RWAs and onchain gaming, ensuring the Arbitrum ecosystem remains competitive and innovative.\n\nWe also believe the current vesting schedule for our entire budget is still critical to remain as is for setting expectations for the Arbitrum Foundation and holding us accountable for how we execute our mission statements. This sets a good example that all programs approved by the DAO must remain accountable and should not assume they can receive all their funding immediately.\n\nWith the above in mind, we are requesting 250 million ARB from the Arbitrum DAO. The amount will solely focus on agreements fulfilling the following 3 criteria:\n\n* Key opportunities exceeding 2 million ARB\n* New agreements signed after approval of this proposal\n* Contractual commitments lasting 1 year or longer\n\nSome foreseeable capital-intensive areas include, but are not limited to, expanding the Orbit Chain ecosystem, securing new RWA opportunities, and onboarding well-known TradeFi institutions on Arbitrum. Tokens will only be allocated on an as needed-basis and will only be exchanged as contractual obligations need to be fulfilled.\n\nThe Foundation plans to expand on the special strategic partnership allocation in our future Transparency Reports. Our goal is to enhance visibility into how these collaborations are structured and how resources are allocated, giving the DAO a clearer understanding of the impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem. At the same time, we remain committed to respecting any confidentiality provisions stipulated in such agreements. By balancing transparency with confidentiality, the Foundation aims to balance both the sensitivity of onboarding traditional institutions to Arbitrum and also providing updates to the DAO on how the funds are being spent.\n\nOur goal with this proposal is not to maintain the status quo, it’s to ensure that we can continue to foster ecosystem growth through strategic partnerships. The funds will not be used for Arbitrum Foundation operating expenses, including marketing, operations, service providers, or existing signed agreements.\n\n### Questions from the DAO\n\nThe Foundation has acknowledged and responded to the questions posted by delegates and DAO contributors on the [forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-funds-to-bolster-foundation-s-strategic-partnerships-budget/26775/66), and will continue to respond to questions there.",

      "title": "UPDATED - Ethereum Protocol Attackathon Sponsorship",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks funding from the Arbitrum DAO to support an Attackathon, a large-scale security audit event hosted by the Ethereum Foundation and Immunefi. The Attackathon will focus on securing the Ethereum protocol with three key phases: education, active bug hunting, and result evaluation. The initiative aims to raise over $2 million, with $500,000 already committed by the Ethereum Foundation. This effort is crucial for ensuring Ethereum’s stability, which is vital to maintaining the reliability of projects on Arbitrum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs a Layer 2 on Ethereum, Arbitrum is directly dependent on the security of the Ethereum protocol. Given that Arbitrum is EVM-compatible, any vulnerabilities in Ethereum could potentially impact Arbitrum’s ecosystem. This Attackathon is particularly timely given the recent major Ethereum hard forks, which have introduced new code that requires careful auditing.\n\nAdditionally, the Attackathon will include an educational program featuring live technical walkthroughs and detailed documentation from Ethereum Foundation, client teams, Solidity developers, and Immunefi. This program will cater to security researchers at all levels, helping to build a stronger security community around both Ethereum and Arbitrum. The increased awareness and participation in Ethereum’s security will ultimately benefit Arbitrum by ensuring a more secure underlying infrastructure.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe Attackathon aligns with Arbitrum’s mission to support a secure and scalable Ethereum ecosystem. By contributing to this initiative, Arbitrum will directly enhance Ethereum’s security, which supports the reliability of Arbitrum. Moreover, the educational component will upskill security researchers, giving them the tools to audit and secure both the Ethereum and Arbitrum ecosystems.\n\nAdditionally, Arbitrum will benefit from increased visibility as a proactive participant in Ethereum security efforts, enhancing its credibility and reputation among developers, users, and security researchers. By sponsoring the Attackathon, Arbitrum positions itself as a leader in the ecosystem, contributing to long-term sustainability and security.\n\n## Detailed Financial Justification\n\nThe goal of securing $2M in total funding aligns with other major security audits in the blockchain ecosystem. Comparable initiatives include:\n\n* MakerDAO contest on Sherlock: $1.35M\n* Euler contest on Cantina: $1.25M\n* Uniswap v4 contest on Cantina: $2.35M\n* Firedancer contest on Immunefi: $1M\n\nThe Attackathon funding goal reflects the importance of thoroughly securing Ethereum’s core protocol. With $500,000 already committed by the Ethereum Foundation, additional sponsorship from ArbitrumDAO will help us reach this $2M target, ensuring participation from top-tier security researchers and maximizing the event’s impact.\n\n## Outcome Metrics\n\nBy setting clear goals for participation, reports submitted, and transparency, we can effectively track the impact of the Attackathon. Key outcome metrics include:\n\n* Secure over 100 security researcher signups before the program's launch.\n* Achieve participation from over 100 distinct individuals submitting reports.\n* Submit more than 150 reports by the conclusion of the Attackathon.\n* Publish an audit-style report summarizing findings for the Arbitrum and Ethereum communities.\n\nThese metrics will demonstrate the program's effectiveness in attracting top security talent and identifying critical vulnerabilities across both ecosystems.\n\n## Community Feedback Loop\n\nTo ensure transparency and alignment with community expectations, we will provide regular updates on the Attackathon’s progress through Arbitrum forums and governance channels. These updates will include detailed reports on fund usage, security vulnerabilities identified, and overall outcomes. Community feedback will be encouraged through these platforms to maintain alignment with the community’s goals and priorities.\n\n## Breakdown of Expenditures\n\n100% of the funds raised from the ArbitrumDAO and other sponsors will be allocated to security researcher payouts based on the severity of the bugs they find. Immunefi has waived their usual fees for this event, so all funds will be directly used for researcher rewards. If any funds remain after the Attackathon, they will be rolled over to an audit contest focused on securing the Pecta hardfork.\n\n## Estimated Timeline\n\n* **November 20**: Detailed program announcement and education kickoff\n* **November 27**: Attackathon hunting begins\n* **January 22**: Attackathon concludes and results compilation begins\n* **January 23**: Review period begins\n* **Late March**: Results announced\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO is invited to sponsor the Attackathon with a **30 ETH commitment**. This sponsorship includes:\n\n* 1x Unique NFT with leaderboard rank\n* Leaderboard listing on the sponsor landing page\n* Mid-roll logo placement on Sponsor and Program Landing Page\n* An Arbitrum Boost (Audit Contest) on Immunefi with up to a $100K rewards pool at 100% Immunefi Discount within 180 days of the conclusion of the Ethereum program\n* 1x Dedicated Twitter post announcing sponsorship from Immunefi Twitter handle\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO had previously signalled its support via a [temperature check on Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x29c7eb60e1ed122f81aa5f4caeb5d171b27ae644666ad18aece78ff28d7b9245) with a 30 ETH sponsorship for the Attackathon via the Panda Partnerships tier.\n\nBy supporting the Attackathon, Arbitrum will leverage the event’s findings to ensure its network remains secure and robust. This initiative not only enhances security but also demonstrates Arbitrum’s commitment to the broader Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n## Multi-Sig Address for DAO Deposit\n\nTo deposit the funds, the Arbitrum DAO can use the following multi-sig address: **0xD4427b312D42191640Ea12c97457636bb807d65e.**\n\nThis multi-sig is a 3/5 MultiSig owned by Immunefi who is contracted on behalf of the Ethereum Foundation to run the Attackathon program.",

      "title": "Constitutional AIP - Extend Delay on L2Time Lock",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO has on-chain governance via a suite of smart contracts. It allows the ArbitrumDAO to spend funds from its treasury alongside upgrading any smart contract that governs Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova. The on-chain smart contract suite includes a voting protocol alongside a series of contracts that will forward the proposal’s intended action to the correct destination before executing it.\n\nThe proposal focuses on extending the time delay between when the voting protocol has concluded and the time it takes for the successful proposal to be passed along by the system until it is in the right destination to be executed. The focus is on the *L2 Core Time Lock* contract that lives on Arbitrum One and proposes changing the delay from 3 days to 8 days which effectively increases the delay by an additional 5 days.\n\nThere are two benefits to increasing the delay:\n\n* **Security Council.** The Security Council will have more time to act if a malicious proposal is passed by the ArbitrumDAO for whatever reason.\n* **Exit window.** Users will have more time to withdraw their assets from Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova if they are worried or not satisfied about how a proposal intends to change the smart contracts that govern Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova.\n\nAdditionally, by increasing the exit window, it will also update the status of Arbitrum by L2Beat and replace a red slice with a yellow slice. This will help Arbitrum move one step closer towards a Stage-2 rollup.\n\nThe downside of increasing the delay is that all constitutional proposals, primarily for upgrading the smart contracts, will be delayed by an additional 5 days.

It is responsible for passing messages that contain executable code and it has the authority to upgrade any smart contract in the system including on-chain governance and the bridges (holding user assets) on Arbitrum One/Nova.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the governance of smart contracts, please check out this [diagram 3](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/roundtrip-governance.png?raw=true) and the [docs 3](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md).\n\n## Steps to Implement & Timeline\n\nThe proposal is to change the value of \\_minDelay from 259200 (seconds) to 691200 (seconds) in the [L2 Timelock 2](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x34d45e99f7D8c45ed05B5cA72D54bbD1fb3F98f0#readProxyContract) contract. This will change the time delay from 3 days to 8 days, an additional 5 days.\n\nThe action contract is implemented and still pending an audit:\n\n[github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/306)\n\n#### [Updates timelock delay 2](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/306)\n\nSeatbelt: [https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance-seatbelt/pull/34](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance-seatbelt/pull/34)\n\nAdditionally, we will need to update the ArbitrumDAO Constitution:\n\n> Phase 4: L2 Waiting Period (3 days): After an AIP has passed Phase 3, a 3 day waiting period occurs.

Key Learnings & Improvements from Phase I\n\nV. Phase II Mandate\n\nVI. Budget & Methodology\n\nVII. Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II\n\nVIII. Transparency & Community Engagement\n\nIX. Checks & Balances\n\nX. Multi-Sig\n\nXI. ARB Conversion Strategy\n\n# **I. Executive Summary**\n\n### **Background**\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (”ADPC”), composed of Axis Advisory, Areta, and Daimon Legal, is coming to the end of its first phase on August 20, 2024. As such, this proposal aims to extend the ADPC’s tenure into Phase II for a 6-month period, which will commence on the date on which the Tally vote for this proposal is executed on-chain. \n\n### **Outcome**\n\nThe ADPC’s pilot phase proceeded successfully, with significant outcomes to Arbitrum DAO and a range of key learnings for the committee. Creating a comprehensive procurement process from the ground up to ensure that Arbitrum is seen as a leader not only in the technical sphere but also within decentralized governance has been a great opportunity.\n\nWe laid the foundation for the ADPC to be an effective set-up bringing the benefits of well-structured procurement to Arbitrum DAO. Cost savings will result from the creation and use of procurement frameworks and marketplaces developed by the ADPC uniquely for Arbitrum DAO as well as the necessary legal and operational infrastructure and strategic sourcing methodology.\n\n### **Way Ahead**\n\nThe ADPC's initial phase was conducted as a proof of concept demonstrating the capability of the team and the benefits arising from the strategic use of advanced sourcing methodology. The ADPC proposes to build on these successes into Phase II of the ADPC's engagement. In this Phase II, the ADPC, after careful alignment with key stakeholders in the DAO, proposes to work on all of the following work packages:\n\n**1.** **Work Package 1: Procurement for 2 tactical verticals**\n\n* Vertical 1 will be focused on procuring RPC providers for projects building in the Arbitrum ecosystem. This decision is based on engagement with delegates and stakeholders as well as an understanding of the core services required by all projects looking to build in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n* Vertical 2 will be focused on providing the procurement services for events identified within the DAO Events Strategy for 2025. This event strategy is prepared by the ADPC, Entropy Advisors and Disruption Joe pursuant to a separate proposal. Please note that the ADPC will not request any funding for its events services procurement in that separate proposal.\n* The scope within the 6-month term is to develop evaluation criteria, draft and publish the Approach to Market (RFP/tender), evaluate responses to Approach to Market and whitelist supplier/s. Contract negotiations with whitelisted suppliers are not in the scope as the counter-party may be the Arbitrum Foundation or third parties utilizing their own counsel, and the ADPC has no influence on those internal legal processes.\n* Further details on our process for arriving at these shortlisted verticals can be found below in the section on Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II.\n\n**2. Work Package 2:** Continued management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Services and, based on the success of the first cohort, publishing the proposal for an extension of the fund.\n\n**3. Work Package 3**\n\n* Definition and creation of an Operational Expense (OpEx) budget for the Arbitrum DAO, to be custodied by the Multi-Signature Safe (MSS), and allocated towards the utilisation of service providers as whitelisted by the ADPC. This creates a utilisation rail for the DAO to be able to utilise the services of the whitelisted service providers procured by the ADPC. Without this in place, the DAO is unable to utilise these service providers without the full proposal process (Forum, Snapshot, On-Chain).\n* The ADPC will draft and propose the OpEx proposal to the DAO;  further details, including the process and procedure for utilization of the OpEx budget by the DAO, will be outlined in this separate proposal to the DAO. This seperate proposal will contain multiple options for the size of the OpEx budget for the community to vote on.\n\n**4. Work Package 4**\n\n* Creating a Phase II Outcome Report, similar to the one we have \\[published]\\(https://docsend.com/view/b25g3iu6feppm7as) for Phase I, and submitting it to the DAO.\n* Continued alignment with key stakeholders in the DAO on the evolution of the Arbitrum DAO’s structure, and ensuring that the ADPC fits into any structure that is defined (e.g., OpCo).\n* Ad-hoc tasks, e.g., aligning and connecting whitelisted service providers with existing and incoming projects on Arbitrum, existing and incoming DAO proposals, etc.\n\n**5. Optional Additional Verticals:** On completion of Work Package 1 and subject to (i) DAO demand and (ii) capacity of the ADPC at that point, procurement for up to \\[2] additional verticals on request from the DAO after approval by the DAO governance process. Where the procurement for such additional verticals is likely to require an extension to the ADPC term, this Work Package will be contingent on that renewal being granted by the DAO to avoid partial completion of tasks.\n\nThe overall budget for the 6-month term will be USD 414,000 including OpEx, details on which can be found below in the Budget & Methodology section. The Funding Request from the on-chain vote will be 954,608 ARB based on the time weighted average ARB price of $**0.5204**/ARB as further outlined below. A buffer has been added so that, in the case of ARB depreciation, the ADPC multi-sig under the Multi-Sig Service (MSS) is still able to satisfy payments to the ADPC's members. Unutilized ARB will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO treasury.\n\nThe multi-sig requested to manage the funds is within the [<u>Multi-Sig Support Service (MSS)</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/47904929527582233304785161920776863155691990219898799848510210794906211250836) established by Entropy Advisors. The Multi-Sig that has been created by the MSS is the following address:\n\n**arb1:0x13d4Ff2A83fBCB8F5fc73cE66CF5928eD0943cB0**\n\nAfter receipt of the ARB, the ADPC will convert as much of the requested amount as is required to obtain 414,000 USDC and will return the unutilized ARB to the DAO treasury. This is intended to avoid fluctuations in ARB price and ensures that the ADPC avoids using the buffer as much as possible. \n\nThe ADPC will utilize a Protocol-Owned Execution strategy on Gauntlet's Aera solution to convert the program’s ARB into USDC for operational purposes. The Protocol-Owned Execution strategy utilizes off-chain logic to monitor on-chain liquidity and model the price impact of trading. The ADPC will use an Aera Vault, with Gauntlet as the guardian, to execute the conversion. Trade execution is scheduled and sized according to impact modelling and executed on Odos, or Bebop. Based on current market conditions, it would take approximately one week to trade out of 414K USD worth of ARB with minimal impact. \n\nOnce the ARB is converted into USDC, the Aera vault will utilize LlamaPay to stream the total payment due to the ADPC member wallet addresses over the course of the 6-month period (120k USDC per member, 360k USDC in total). The remainder of the converted funds (54k USDC) will remain in the MSS as the OpEx budget. This process will be coordinated with the MSS chairs and members.\n\nFurther details about the ARB conversion strategy and about Aera can be found below in the 'ARB Conversion Strategy' section below.\n\n**Note**: The proposal includes the re-election of the current members of the ADPC. For any future extension terms of the ADPC, the process outlined in the original Tally vote will stand unless automatic renewal of the then-current members is proposed. Of course, this will be subject to the potential OpCo that gets formed and any implications that may have on the structure of the ADPC.\n\n### **Acknowledgements**\n\nWe would like to acknowledge the consistent participation and deep input from the Arbitrum community, delegates, and stakeholders, without whom our progress would not have been possible. We would especially like to thank the security service providers who deeply engaged with the program from the very beginning. We would also like to thank all respondents to the ADPC’s outreach in determining the procurement frameworks to tackle in Phase II, including @bobbay, @JoJo, @Frisson, @realdumbird, @IronBoots, and @krst, among others.\n\n# **II. Background of the ADPC**\n\nThe ADPC was established as a crucial component of the Arbitrum ecosystem's governance structure, following a successful proposal and subsequent community vote in early 2024. The formation of the ADPC was driven by the growing need for a structured, transparent, and efficient approach to procurement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ultimately contributing to the ecosystem's growth, security, and sustainability.\n\nThe inception of the ADPC can be traced back to discussions within the Arbitrum community about the challenges faced by projects building on the protocol, particularly in securing high-quality service providers. These discussions highlighted the need for a pre-emptive quality assurance mechanism that could benefit the entire ecosystem. Against the background that a dedicated procurement framework has, to our knowledge, not been established in any DAO prior, the committee's formation marked a pivotal moment not only in Arbitrum's governance evolution, but set a precedent for DAOs in general. We designed the ADPC to address immediate needs and to create a foundation for future growth and efficiency in the ecosystem.\n\nPhase I of the ADPC ran for a duration of 182 days from February 21, 2024 (i.e., the day that the KYB for the ADPC members was completed) until August 20, 2024.\n\nThe ADPC’s mandate in Phase I consisted of the following:\n\n### **A. Oversight of Security-Oriented Service Providers Framework**\n\nOversee and facilitate the Procurement Framework for security-oriented service providers within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n### **B. Subsidy Fund Research & Proposal**\n\nResearch and draft a proposal to set up a subsidy fund for security-oriented services to subsidize the costs for security services for smaller projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n### **C. Development of Eligibility Framework (’Means Test’)**\n\nResearch and implement a framework that will establish a set of qualitative & quantitative metrics that will be utilized  to assess a project's eligibility for the subsidy fund referred to in paragraph \\[B] above.\n\n### **D. Establishment of Future Procurement Frameworks**\n\nEstablish procurement frameworks for a myriad of verticals/service types that the Arbitrum DAO could need in the foreseeable future. \n\n### **E. Creation and Communication of Guidance**\n\nCreate and communicate guidance notes & circulars that will substantiate & provide additional detail in relation to any procurement framework that is ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time.\n\n# **III. Achievements & Progress**\n\nThe ADPC made significant progress against its mandates:\n\n**A. Oversight of Security-Oriented Service Providers Framework**\n\nThe ADPC finalized and [<u>published</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-proposal-the-adpc-security-services-panel-and-procurement-framework/25031) extensive RFP documentation for whitelisting security service providers on June 19, 2024. This comprehensive framework is designed to establish a marketplace for whitelisted service providers to offer services pursuant to pre-agreed terms, conditions, and pricing to projects that have been granted subsidies under the Security Services Subsidy Fund Proposal.\n\nThe development of the RFP documentation was an intensive, multi-stage process that involved various stakeholders and multiple rounds of refinement. The key stages included: \n\n1. Creating an initial draft that incorporated research on best practices in procurement frameworks and multiple internal drafting sessions;\n2. Working with DeDaub to integrate specific technical requirements into the RFP;\n3. Working with the Arbitrum Foundation’s legal team to align the legal documents with the Foundation’s policies and guidelines;\n4. Conducting a final review by the ADPC, DeDaub, and the Arbitrum Foundation;\n5. Publishing the final documentation.\n\nThis procurement framework, being the first of its kind, set a new standard for procurement processes in the crypto space. \n\nThe RFP received responses from 12 security service providers and the whitelisting of these providers is still in progress. We expect to execute the agreements necessary for enabling engagement in September 2024.\n\n**B. Subsidy Fund Research & Proposal**\n\nThe ADPC researched, drafted, and passed a [<u>proposal to set up a subsidy fund for security-oriented services</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/3552942192106351362095426680857341385146921274641698065112264407057470303359); the development of the proposal was strongly influenced by community engagement, while the terms and conditions for the receipt of the subsidy (’Means Test’) were mainly based on our experience from traditional procurement processes.\n\nThe [<u>initial Subsidy Fund proposal</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958) incorporated:\n\n1. A comprehensive benchmarking exercise with 10 leading security audit service providers which was conducted to analyze costs and scope of typical security audits to determine the fund size and allocation;\n2. A detailed evaluation framework with weighted criteria for the ‘Means Test’; and\n3. Timelines and procedures for application submission and review.\n\nFollowing the publication of the initial proposal, the ADPC engaged in extensive community discussions. Key points of feedback included concerns about the large fund size and potential for inefficient capital allocation and questions about the capacity to manage such a large fund. \n\nIn response to community feedback, the ADPC revised the proposal. In particular, the subsidy fund was reduced to $2.5 million worth of ARB (75% reduction) to potentially fund up to 12 projects for one cohort of 8 weeks and with a maximum subsidy per project of $250K (10% of the total fund). \n\nThe ADPC also listened to and incorporated community feedback about the ADPC managing the initial subsidy fund itself. As a consequence, the ADPC translated raised community concerns into a concrete governance proposal to create a separate “[<u>Security Services Subsidy Fund Sub-Committee</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-set-up-a-sub-committee-for-the-security-services-subsidy-fund/23766)”, consisting of five members elected through a weighted voting system with a proposed compensation of 60,000 ARB in total. However, after thorough discussion, the community voted against the creation of the sub-committee, leaving the disbursement of funds under the subsidy fund to the ADPC.\n\n**C. Development of Eligibility Framework (’Means Test’)**\n\nThe [<u>Means Test</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958) and the related [<u>Grant Application T\\&Cs</u>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iYCtfP_GqfjkKQafVr86hCpjEsQ2Ec4a/view) were uniquely developed for Arbitrum DAO as a structured approach to evaluate applications for financial assistance. The primary goal of the Means Test is to identify applicants who would benefit most from support with the potential for significant positive impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem while (i) ensuring equitable access to subsidies within the Arbitrum Ecosystem and (ii) preventing exploitation by larger players.\n\nFor this assessment, we:\n\n1. Developed a scoring system with a 1-5 rating scale and assigned weights to criteria based on importance. \n2. Developed four main criteria categories, each with weighted sub-criteria: Arbitrum Ecosystem Contribution, Business Model & Need for the Subsidy, Financial Analysis and a Risk Analysis. \n3. Based on community feedback, we further identified key verticals that are particularly valuable to the Arbitrum ecosystem. \n4. Implemented a two-stage evaluation process, with an initial screening focused on the five highest-weighted sub-criteria before conducting an in-depth review with a comprehensive evaluation of all criteria for top-scoring applicants.\n\n \n\n**D. Establishment of Future Procurement Frameworks**\n\nWhile our primary efforts were focused, due to the complexity of the undertaking and the high level of community engagement and input, on the oversight of the security-oriented service providers framework, the research and proposal of the subsidy fund, the development of the eligibility framework ('Means Test') and the creation and communication of guidance, we did conduct work to identify and prioritize potential verticals for future procurement frameworks. Our approach was to create a comprehensive and adaptable methodology that could be applied to various service categories, ensuring that future frameworks would be developed with a robust approach.\n\nMore detail about our exploration into future procurement frameworks can be found in the section on [<u>Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II</u>](https://www.notion.so/Arbitrum-DAO-Procurement-Committee-Phase-II-Proposal-fcafed65565e4ca98dfbe0627977eda0?pvs=21) below.\n\n**E. Creation and Communication of Guidance**\n\nThe ADPC achieved its goal of keeping the community abreast of its activities and progress during the entirety of its first phase by:\n\n1\\. Setting up a bi-weekly 1 hour call on the Arbitrum governance calendar to engage with delegates and community members;\n\n2\\. Establishing a [<u>dedicated dashboard</u>](https://www.notion.so/Public-Dashboard-a1d953a54c7949c38d9882792f90a7a0?pvs=21) including the Meeting Minutes of each week’s internal ADPC standing meeting and the ADPC’s current task list;\n\n3\\. Creating a [<u>dedicated Telegram channel</u>](https://t.me/+lyn8LCx7_3U5NTU0) to communicate with RFP applicants;\n\n4\\. Scheduling two AMA sessions to field and answer queries from RFP applicants; and\n\n5\\. Publishing a [<u>forum post</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-proposal-the-adpc-security-services-panel-and-procurement-framework/25031) explaining how the entire Procurement Framework operates.\n\n# **IV. Key Learnings & Improvements from Phase I**\n\nA comprehensive set of learnings and recommendations can be found in the [<u>ADPC’s Phase I Outcome Report</u>](https://docsend.com/view/b25g3iu6feppm7as). A subset of the most important of these learnings that we will implement in Phase II are:\n\n**Financial Management & Budgeting**\n\nGiven the nature of this initial phase being a pilot, the budget for Phase I was more ‘experimental’, and thus did not fully account for all necessary resources. As such, this proposal will include a comprehensive budget plan and management that:\n\n* Creates a fit-for-purpose budget model based on data collected during Phase I; this model is further explained in the [<u>Budget & Methodology</u>](https://www.notion.so/Arbitrum-DAO-Procurement-Committee-Phase-II-Proposal-fcafed65565e4ca98dfbe0627977eda0?pvs=21) section below;\n* Bakes in Operating Expenses to account for unexpected challenges and opportunities;\n* Allocates budget for specialized external consultants to address complex issues efficiently (such as DeDaub in Phase I); and\n* Increases the number of FTE personnel to adequately cover all aspects of the ADPC's mandate.\n\n**Clear Alignment with Arbitrum Foundation**\n\nTo improve effective coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation, in Phase II we will:\n\n* Designate specific points of contact within both the ADPC and the Arbitrum Foundation for different areas of collaboration (e.g., legal, technical, strategic). As needed, the points of contact will be with the DAO Relations team;\n* Establish regular check-in meetings between the ADPC and Arbitrum Foundation;\n* Implement a clear escalation path for urgent matters or deadlocks;\n* Develop a mechanism for early Foundation review of legal frameworks;\n* Coordinate timelines for legal reviews and feedback.\n\n**Create a Long-Term Vision for the ADPC’s Role in Supporting Arbitrum**\n\nAs can be seen in the [<u>Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II</u>](https://www.notion.so/Arbitrum-DAO-Procurement-Committee-Phase-II-Proposal-fcafed65565e4ca98dfbe0627977eda0?pvs=21) section below, we have already begun to identify a list of selected procurement frameworks the ADPC can tackle over its next and future phases. To compile this list, we used a comprehensive methodology, involving community feedback and engagement, and took into account current market conditions and need for Arbitrum.\n\nIn Phase II, we will further outline the ADPC’s role in the continued growth of Arbitrum and ensure that it forms an important part of the DAO’s structure going forward, including as a key component of the OpCo.\n\n**Community Engagement & Transparency**\n\nWhile we spent significant time and resources on community engagement and providing regular, detailed updates, this part of our mandate was more time-consuming than anticipated but crucial for the success of initiatives. Key learnings that we will implement in Phase II are to: \n\n* Implement a clear process for incorporating community input into decision-making;\n* Improve the public dashboard to inform better about the ADPC and showing even more information on real-time progress;\n* Develop comprehensive onboarding materials for community members interested in ADPC activities.\n\n# **V. Phase II Mandate**\n\nThe ADPC proposes the following work packages in Phase II:\n\n### **Work Package 1: Procurement for 2 Tactical Verticals**\n\n    \n\n**Vertical 1. Procuring RPC Providers**\n\nVertical 1 will be focused on creating a whitelisted panel of RPC providers that can be procured by projects currently building or looking to build on Arbitrum. This panel of RPC providers will enable streamlined access and transparent pricing during the project’s build phase or post-launch, adding to the ecosystem of support services for Arbitrum projects and Orbit chains. \n\n    \n\nWe have chosen this vertical based on discussions with key delegates and stakeholders, given that a key focus for Arbitrum is to grow the Orbit ecosystem, while RPC costs are relatively high and RPCs are critical for projects to deploy, similar to security audits. Moreover, the technical due diligence around infrastructure providers is a huge time suck for projects. Pre-vetting RPC providers would make it much more attractive for projects to build on Arbitrum.\n\n    \n\nIn case there is any major opposition to the selection of this vertical, the ADPC will in the first month of Phase II engage with key delegates and stakeholders to arrive at a final decision on the vertical to tackle. The stakeholders we have engaged with have demonstrated an interest in each of the verticals listed below. To find such a substitute vertical, we will:\n\n* Shortlist key stakeholders to schedule calls with;\n* Liaise with the Arbitrum Foundation to identify relevant legal and regulatory considerations associated with these frameworks;\n* Create engagement surveys to be shared with key delegates and projects building on Arbitrum to identify their one prioritized vertical from the below four verticals:\n\n    \n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/6d3da625-529b-4cfb-baa9-4ef39d1cae33_original.png)\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/7cc0015d-e57a-494d-85cc-79855272c3c6_original.png)\n\n    \n\nFor further information on the methodology we used to shortlist these frameworks, see the [<u>Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II</u>](https://www.notion.so/Arbitrum-DAO-Procurement-Committee-Phase-II-Proposal-fcafed65565e4ca98dfbe0627977eda0?pvs=21) section below.\n\n**Vertical 2. Procuring Events Providers**\n\nVertical 2 will be focused on providing the procurement services for events identified within the DAO Events Strategy for 2025. This event strategy is prepared by the ADPC, Entropy Advisors and Disruption Joe pursuant to a separate proposal.\n\n    \n\nThe selection of event provider(s) will follow a two-step process: Together with the ADPC, Entropy Advisors will first create an events & sponsorships strategy while, in parallel, event providers will be whitelisted. Second, individual RFP processes will be conducted to procure event services for specific events defined in the event strategy from the whitelisted panel.\n\n    \n\nPlease refer to the “RFP - Establishing a DAO Events Strategy for 2025” proposal for granular detail on how this procurement process will be constructed when it is published in the coming weeks.\n\n**Scope for Work Package 1**\n\nThe scope within the 6-month term is to:\n\n    \n\n1. Develop evaluation criteria;\n2. Draft and publish the Approach to Market (RFP / tender);\n3. Evaluate responses to Approach to Market and whitelist supplier/s.\n4. If need be, research and begin the process of setting up a subsidy fund for the RPC providers vertical (or, if the need arises, a substitute vertical chosen by the DAO). This will include the development and ratification of the Means Test for that specific fund, community engagement and research to determine the size of the fund, drafting a proposal to pass the fund through Arbitrum governance, and if need be, the set-up of a separate sub-committee to manage the fund.\n5. For the Events vertical, conduct individual RFP processes to procure event services for specific events defined in the event strategy from the whitelisted panel. \n\n    \n\n**Note:**\n\n* Contract negotiations with whitelisted suppliers are not in scope as the counter-party may be the Arbitrum Foundation or third parties utilizing their own counsel, and the ADPC has no influence on those external parties.\n* To streamline our financial budget, the management of any subsidy fund other than the legacy subsidy fund for security service providers is not included in this scope. The management of newly formed subsidy funds could be conducted either by a separate sub-committee or by the ADPC (as decided upon by the DAO), and will be subject to an additional management fee which will be included in any extension proposal.\n\n### **Work Package 2: Management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Services**\n\n**Scope for Work Package 2**\n\n* The management of the Security Services Subsidy Fund was not part of the ADPC’s mandate in Phase I. However, as decided by the DAO, the ADPC was elected to manage the first cohort of the Subsidy Fund, which we hereby include in the scope for this work package.\n* Communication of key learnings and improvements from the first cohort of the Subsidy Fund.\n* The ADPC will conduct in particular the following tasks to manage the Subsidy Fund (non-exhaustive):\n  * Setting up the infrastructure for running the program;\n  * Defining and executing the marketing strategy;\n  * Scanning inbound applications, filtering for scams/junk, and reviewing each application;\n  * Onboarding of grantees, including a welcome email with acceptance, set up of comms channels, coordinating KYB/KYC, etc.\n  * Setting milestones for funding and progress;\n  * Ensuring milestone alignment with program objectives;\n  * Setting clear project deliverables;\n  * Tracking progress;\n  * Executing funding alongside the Arbitrum Foundation;\n  * Preparing the End-of-Program report;\n  * Act as the point of contact and ‘customer service’ for all grant applicants.\n* Depending on the success of this first iteration, market conditions, and demand from the DAO, the ADPC may propose an extension of the fund for one or more cohorts.\n* Depending on discussions with the community and delegates and learnings from the first iteration of the fund, the ADPC will either propose a separate sub-committee to manage the fund or will propose to manage the next iteration of the fund itself. Both of these options will require additional fund management costs which will be included in any Subsidy Fund extension proposal.\n\n### **Work Package 3: Creation of OpEx (Operational Expense) Budget for the DAO to Utilize Whitelisted Service Providers**\n\n**Objective**\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO currently faces significant inefficiencies in its ability to engage with service providers, particularly those whitelisted by the ADPC. Presently, any effort to solicit services, such as a security audit, requires the DAO to navigate the entire governance proposal life cycle — a process that can extend over a month for just a single deliverable. This protracted timeline not only delays critical operations but also impedes the DAO's ability to respond swiftly to emerging needs, creating a bottleneck that hinders operational efficiency.\n\nTo address these inefficiencies and better equip the DAO for future needs, we will propose the establishment of an Operational Expense (OpEx) budget. This budget is designed to streamline the DAO’s interaction with ADPC-whitelisted service providers by creating a direct utilization rail. This rail will allow DAO initiatives and contributors to access and utilize these pre-approved service providers without undergoing the cumbersome proposal process for each engagement. The OpEx budget essentially bypasses the bureaucratic hurdles that currently plague the DAO’s procurement process, enabling a more agile and responsive operational framework.\n\nThe OpEx budget will be initially administered by the Multi-Signature Service (MSS), ensuring that funds are allocated specifically for the utilization of ADPC-whitelisted service providers. The ADPC will draft the initial proposal for the OpEx budget, which will include detailed guidelines on its usage. Importantly, while the ADPC will establish the budget, it will not have control over its management or the approval of expenditures, thus maintaining a clear separation of duties and preserving DAO oversight.\n\n**Why is an OpEx Budget Needed?**\n\nCurrently, the DAO’s engagement with service providers is hampered by a rigid and time-consuming process that involves submitting a governance proposal, conducting a Snapshot temperature check, and finally, holding an on-chain vote. This multi-step process is not only inefficient but also stifles the DAO’s ability to procure services in a timely manner, particularly in scenarios requiring quick action. By introducing an OpEx budget, we aim to eliminate these bureaucratic barriers, creating a streamlined pathway for the DAO to access necessary services from ADPC-whitelisted providers.\n\nMoreover, the OpEx budget is not just a temporary fix; it is a strategic initiative designed to future-proof the DAO’s operations. As the DAO evolves, the OpEx budget can be seamlessly integrated into future organizational structures, such as the prospective OpCo, which has been under discussion. By establishing this budget now, the DAO ensures it has a ready-made, adaptable infrastructure in place to meet its future operational needs. This forward-thinking approach not only addresses current inefficiencies but also lays the foundation for a more resilient and responsive organizational framework.\n\n**Key Aspects of the Proposal**\n\n1. **Funding Allocation**: The amount allocated to the OpEx budget will be determined through a governance vote, with the ADPC providing multiple options for consideration. The funds will be held in the Multi-Sig Service (MSS) set up by Entropy Advisors, dedicated exclusively to services procured through the ADPC’s whitelisted providers.\n2. **Effective Utilization**: The proposal will outline the procedures for the DAO to efficiently utilize the OpEx budget, ensuring that all expenditures are subject to appropriate oversight while still allowing for the flexibility needed to address immediate operational needs.\n\n**Benefits of the Proposal**\n\n1. **Immediate Access**: The OpEx budget will enable the Arbitrum DAO to quickly and efficiently engage with service providers without the delays imposed by the current governance process.\n2. **Foundation for Future Operations**: This initiative serves as a foundational step toward future-proofing the DAO’s operations. By establishing relationships with service providers now, the DAO will be better positioned to transition into more complex organizational structures in the future, with an established operational framework already in place.\n\nIn summary, the introduction of an OpEx budget addresses the current inefficiencies in the DAO’s procurement process by providing a streamlined mechanism for engaging with service providers. It also future-proofs the DAO by laying the groundwork for its evolving operational needs, ensuring that the DAO can continue to operate efficiently and effectively as it grows and adapts.\n\n### **Work Package 4: Outcome Report, Definition of ADPC Vision and Role, and Ad-Hoc Tasks**\n\n**Scope for Work Package 4**\n\n* Creating a Phase II Outcome Report, similar to the one we have [<u>published for Phase I</u>](https://docsend.com/view/b25g3iu6feppm7as), to be submitted to the DAO. The Outcome Report will consist of:\n  * Achievements and Progress from Phase II;\n  * Financial Overview;\n  * Overview of Community Engagement;\n  * Challenges;\n  * Key Learnings & Recommendations;\n  * Outlook.\n* Continued definition of ADPC vision and role in the DAO:\n  * The DAO is currently in the process of determining its ways of working and operational structure for the short and long-terms. There have been extensive discussions among key delegates and community members around the set-up of an OpCo, and Areta has (tentatively) defined how the ADPC could fit into such a structure in the [<u>final report for the M\\&A Pilot Phase</u>](https://docsend.com/view/wc4cackddrbfe35h).\n  * As such, as part of the ADPC, we commit to continually align with key stakeholders in the DAO on the evolution of the Arbitrum DAO’s structure, and ensuring that the ADPC fits cleanly into any structure that is defined (e.g., OpCo).\n  * Executing on ad-hoc tasks such as aligning and connecting whitelisted service providers with existing and incoming projects on Arbitrum, existing and incoming DAO proposals, etc.\n\n### **Optional Additional Verticals: Procurement for Up to \\[2] Additional Verticals Depending on the Completion of Work Package 1**\n\n**Scope of Optional Additional Verticals**\n\nOn completion of Work Package 1 and subject to (i) DAO demand and (ii) capacity of the ADPC at that point, procurement for up to \\[2] additional verticals on request from the DAO after approval and approved by the DAO governance process. Where the procurement for such additional verticals is likely to require an extension to the ADPC term, this Work Package will be contingent on that renewal being granted by the DAO to avoid partial completion of tasks. \n\nWe are leaving some flexibility in this Work Package given the pace of change in the DAO and the broader crypto market, and recognize that the DAO’s needs and wants will likely change over time. \n\n**Note:** This work package will likely be subject to the ADPC requiring additional funding since this Phase II proposal is based on conducting procurement for two verticals. If the need for additional funding to conduct procurement for these further verticalsarises, the ADPC will approach the DAO with further details about budget and scope.\n\n# **VI. Budget & Methodology**\n\n### **Budget Components**\n\n**Phase II Budget**\n\nAs outlined in the [<u>Phase I Outcome Report </u>](https://docsend.com/view/b25g3iu6feppm7as)and the section on [<u>Key Learnings & Improvements</u>](https://www.notion.so/Arbitrum-DAO-Procurement-Committee-Phase-II-Proposal-fcafed65565e4ca98dfbe0627977eda0?pvs=21) from Phase I above, the actual work in the ADPC was significantly more time intensive than priced-in, but taken on by the committee as goodwill in the pilot phase. Since we have now left the pilot phase and will provide procurement services for two verticals in Work Package 1, the budget naturally reflects this.\n\n**The ADPC is budgeting USD 360,000 for the work in Phase II as outlined in the Phase II Mandate section above.**\n\nIn Phase II, the ADPC will continue with producing the agreed outputs together with a continuation of management of all legacy programs including the management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Service Providers.\n\n**Management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Services \\[Work Package 2]**\n\nRegarding the Management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Services \\[Work Package 2], given the operational effort to set up and run such a fund, as described in Work Package 2 above, we would usually charge a management fee including Operational Expenses as a percentage fee of the value of the fund. \n\nIn this case, however, given that this is the pilot phase for the fund and that all the pre-work to set the fund up including the passing of the Tally vote and liaising with the Arbitrum Foundation has already been completed, we will waive all fees to run the fund in the pilot phase as a sign of our commitment and in order to make it as seamless as possible to prove the success of the fund in this first iteration.\n\nThis fee waiver only applies to the current proposal. If there is an extension to the Subsidy Fund in the future, management fees will be included in the respective proposal.\n\n**Operational Expenses Budget**\n\nPhase I highlighted the importance of including operational expenses in the budget: This is necessary to engage external subject matter experts - as we did with [<u>DeDaub in Phase I</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/adding-a-security-sme-to-the-adpc/23526)  - and cover operational expenses such as third party communication tools and collaboration infrastructure.\n\nTo take this into account, we propose an additional budget of 15% Operational Expenses which will be allocated for the engagement of SMEs and for other operational expenses and running costs. The Operational Expenses budget includes (non-exhaustive):\n\n* Infrastructure set-up for essential tools and infrastructure like centralized accounts for email, collaboration platforms, and document management systems;\n* Implementing comprehensive document retention and IP management policies;\n* Creating standardized templates and workflows for common processes;\n* Allocation of budget for specialized external SMEs to address complex issues efficiently;\n* Budget flexibility to accommodate unexpected challenges and community engagement needs.\n\nThe remaining unused funds of this sub-budget will be returned to Arbitrum’s treasury after Phase II has been concluded.\n\n**The Operational Expenses Budget for Phase II will total USD 54,000.**\n\n**ARB Token Calculation**\n\nTo determine the ARB token amount, we used the 14-day Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) of ARB/USD, each as listed EOD UTC, until EOD on Thu Sep 19 on CoinGecko ([<u>https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arbitrum/historical\\_data</u>](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arbitrum/historical_data)), prior to the proposal being posted on Tally. This method ensures a fair and current valuation while mitigating short-term price volatility. We'll add a 20% buffer to this amount to account for potential price fluctuations between proposal submission and execution. The remaining unused funds of this buffer will be returned to Arbitrum’s treasury after the conversion has been concluded.\n\n### **Total Budget**\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/4a89fd32-67ef-4286-a857-9c946ad16b25_original.png)\n\nThe total budget requested is 954,608 ARB. Please find the Google sheet with the corresponding calculation of the TWAP ARB Amount [<u>here</u>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bwv3ljCRbZfQFJHeam_HaE5bSu1d-wIGyv0YUj2b7RA/edit?gid=0#gid=0).\n\nA detailed breakdown of the budget can be found in the Google sheet [<u>here</u>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JqsCoVu8ykQ3QOr1IMPiMG1lhP-qHYGnXl_OqOP3eBQ/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n# **VII. Methodology for Shortlisting Verticals for Phase II**\n\n### **Methodology**\n\nIn order to identify the verticals that will be most beneficial for the ADPC to tackle in Phase II, we created a non-weighted scoring system to rate all verticals against the following factors:\n\n**Importance to Projects on Arbitrum**\n\nThis factor takes into account the importance of the vertical with respect to the following criteria:  \n\n* Frequency of use of the vertical by Projects;  \n* Estimated spend under the vertical; \n* Feedback from Arbitrum stakeholders regarding importance of vertical to Arbitrum ecosystem growth; and \n* The extent to which the Procurement Framework (PF) vertical helps make the process of building on Arbitrum, both for existing and new projects, more streamlined, cost-effective, and attractive, while simplifying and standardizing their engagement with service providers.   \n\nHigher ratings indicate higher levels of importance.\n\n**Importance to DAO Proposals & Initiatives**\n\nThe extent to which the PF solves issues faced by existing DAO proposals and initiatives, helps operationalize them, and increases their chances of success. Higher ratings indicate higher levels of importance.\n\n**Solving Existing DAO Needs**\n\nThe extent to which the PF solves issues faced by the DAO in general, and how significantly the PF will help professionalize and operationalize the DAO further. Higher ratings indicate higher levels of utility to the DAO.\n\n**Overlap with Existing DAO Initiatives / Structure**\n\nThere are initiatives in the DAO or from the Foundation that are already tackling the problem solved by the PF. The ranking will take into account how well the PF vertical avoids overlap/duplication. Higher scores indicate PF is better at avoiding overlap/duplication.\n\n**Procurement Complexity / Cost**\n\nThe complexity of constructing the procurement framework and the cost to do so. Higher ratings indicate lower complexity.\n\n**Monetary Savings for Projects on Arbitrum**\n\nThis criterion evaluates cost savings for projects on Arbitrum resulting from an implementation of the respective PF. Higher ratings indicate greater cost savings.\n\n**Monetary Savings for DAO**\n\nThis criterion evaluates cost savings for the DAO resulting from an implementation of the respective PF. Higher ratings indicate greater cost savings.\n\n**Increase in Deployment Efficiency**\n\nThis criterion evaluates the extent to which an introduction of the PF makes deployment for new projects more efficient.  The greater the efficiency improvements, the higher the rating.\n\nEach of these factors are rated on a scale of 0 (Not Applicable at All), 1 (Low), 2 (Medium), 3 (High), and higher scores are better.\n\n**Note:** Some of these factors are not applicable to some verticals. As such, the final score for each vertical is the percentage it has achieved, to enable comparability between verticals. For example, if the Events vertical has 6 factors that are applicable to it, the maximum score it can achieve is 18 and its final score is the percentage of the score it has achieved out of 18, so if it has achieved 17, its final score is 94%.\n\n**Application of Methodology to Frameworks**\n\nWe identified 27 verticals that we could potentially tackle in Phase II. The below table represents the scores per vertical with the methodology applied, in order from highest to lowest. For a detailed breakdown of the application of the methodology with rationales for each individual score, please see the table [<u>here</u>](https://adpc.notion.site/Application-of-Procurement-Framework-Shortlisting-Methodology-0c35048ce6074195b64afb07277a7887).\n\nThe verticals we selected to obtain further feedback on from high-context delegates, existing projects on Arbitrum, and new projects looking to build on Arbitrum, were those with scores >80% and constitute the below verticals:\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/02a80294-c049-43b9-aace-e9c02b4283f8_original.png)\n\nThe verticals we selected to obtain further feedback on from high-context delegates, existing projects on Arbitrum, and new projects looking to build on Arbitrum, were those with scores >80% and constitute the below verticals:\n\n1\\. Events\n\n2\\. Tokenomics & Token Launch Teams\n\n3\\. DevRel Firms\n\n4\\. OTC Services\n\n5\\. KYC Providers\n\n7\\. RPC Providers\n\n**Note:**\n\nWe did not initially include Risk Service Providers in the list of verticals since these were already available to the DAO via the ARDC. As such, we did not ask for specific feedback from delegates and stakeholders for this vertical.\n\nHowever, given that the ARDC may eliminate this function in its next iteration, we decided to include it in our list and, as it scored very highly, include it in the list of verticals to potentially tackle in Phase II.\n\n**Community Engagement & Feedback Collection**\n\nAfter shortlisting the top six verticals, we decided to validate the shortlisted verticals with high-context delegates, existing Arbitrum projects, and new projects aiming to build on Arbitrum. The intention was to further narrow down the verticals to the two we would tackle in Phase II.\n\n**We reached out to 25 stakeholders for feedback:** L2Beat, Coinflip, GMX, DK, Gauntlet, Wintermute, Griff Green, Blockworks, Frisson, JoJo, Jones DAO, Pepperoni Jo3, Treasure, Camelot, Cattin, Premia, MUX Protocol, MaxLomu, Bob Rossi, Karpatkey, Princeton Blockchain Club, Bobbay, Angle Protocol, Merkl, and PaperImperium. \n\nBased on our interactions with the community, we decided to move forward with the procurement of RPC providers as the first vertical. This is because RPC costs are high, RPCs are critical for projects to deploy, similar to security audits, and technical due diligence around infrastructure providers is a complex task that drains time and resources from projects. As such, creating a panel of whitelisted RPC providers streamlines the building process for projects.\n\nIn addition, we locked in 'Events' as a second vertical. The reason for this is that we spoke with Entropy Advisors about the need for a coherent events strategy for Arbitrum DAO, which is also apparent from the multiple concurrent events proposals being proposed in the DAO. As a result, we decided to create a proposal alongside Entropy Advisors and DisruptionJoe to establish a DAO Events Strategy for 2025, which will be published soon. While the proposal on the DAO Events Strategy for 2025 is focused on defining in particular the type and distribution of events as a first step, event services and event providers have to be procured in a second step to execute on the identified strategy. This second step, i.e., the provision of those procurement services for the identified events, is the subject of this proposal.\n\n# **VIII. Transparency & Community Engagement**\n\nAs in Phase I, the ADPC commits to maintaining its high standards of transparency and community engagement. We will:\n\n* Continue to hold bi-weekly calls with the entire Arbitrum community, and when need be, make this more frequent;\n* Continue to update the [<u>ADPC Update Thread</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/adpc-update-thread/23361/17) on the forum;\n* Post all meeting minutes and tasks on the [<u>ADPC’s public dashboard</u>](https://www.notion.so/Public-Dashboard-a1d953a54c7949c38d9882792f90a7a0?pvs=21), with a view to further enhancing the dashboard to provide even more information to the community.\n\n# **IX. Checks & Balances**\n\nKindly note that Phase II of the ADPC’s term will be subject to the same checks and balances found within the [<u>Procurement Committee proposal</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-establish-the-arbitrumdao-procurement-committee/20064), regulated by an agreement entered into by all elected ADPC Members, with the Arbitrum Foundation serving as a counterparty to the agreement. These checks and balances include:\n\n* **Conflict of Interest Provision:** ADPC Members will be bound to act in absolute good faith, utmost honesty, refraining from deriving unauthorized profits from their position & disclose conflicts of interest. ADPC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to other ADPC members who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ADPC Members’ involvement in the task in relation to which such ADPC Member is conflicted.\n\nTo sum up, all ADPC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ADPC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.    \n\n* **Record-keeping and Reporting:** Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ADPC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ADPC’s internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ADPC Administration.\n* **Duty of Impartiality:** ADPC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ADPC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.\n* **Obligation of Recusal:** ADPC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project and/or service provider being reviewed by the ADPC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation, facilitation & administration of the applicable procurement process.\n* **Prohibition of Self-Dealing:** Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.\n* **Ethical Trading:** Members are required to follow ethical trading standards concerning ARB and any other relevant digital assets.\n\n# **X. Multi-Sig**\n\nWe propose to use the [<u>Multi-Sig Support Service</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/47904929527582233304785161920776863155691990219898799848510210794906211250836) for Arbitrum DAO. Accordingly, we have taken advantage of the cost savings associated with that service and not included any costs for multi-sig management in this proposal.\n\n# **XI. ARB Conversion Strategy**\n\nThe ADPC will utilize a Protocol-Owned Execution strategy on Aera to convert the program’s ARB into USDC for operational purposes. The Protocol-Owned Execution strategy utilizes off-chain logic to monitor onchain liquidity and model the price impact of trading. The ADPC will use an Aera Vault, with Gauntlet as the guardian, to execute the conversion. Trade execution is scheduled and sized according to impact modeling and executed on Odos, or Bebop. Based on current market conditions, it would take approximately one week to trade out of 414K USD worth of ARB with minimal impact. \n\n<img height=\"224\" width=\"602\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcQxe5D3NtHl5v6Wou02HlHACIwotU2tGTArqxNZuGkWbR8uUVIxbAQ-yXSUosrPR1yM7c_vySCWpKw9fNpoOa_es889iABvcjDIR7bDCZy6uGkryUxRxhT3z_ezACJRq7b93HDA_Wd_dvwGQNJeg?key=qsxGBEkQhvoNC0by3Umd8w\" />\n\n**Protocol-Owned Execution**\n\nThe Protocol-Owned Execution strategy uses off-chain logic to monitor onchain liquidity, model price impact, and plan the execution of active and passive trading. Based on current market conditions, it will take \\< 1 week to swap out of 414k USD worth of ARB with minimal impact.\n\nFor ARB on the Arbitrum Chain, Gauntlet will swap out tokens using either Odos (DEX aggregator) or BeBop (self-execution solver). \n\nPassive execution uses concentrated ARB positions in an ARB/USDC pool (Odos supports projects such as Camelot, Uniswap V3, and [<u>more</u>](https://www.odos.xyz/about)). The amount converted through this position is periodically claimed, and a new ARB position is set in the pool. These can be thought of as limit orders.\n\n<img height=\"136\" width=\"602\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdKC1Yctsz4n_8hLKl-wNVswcDK9GYigoLIlARP8UpLN-J3y62mwBX1hO0GKANfJg9-nmRuoU_BeiDoBtAUqv7rVO5V4fCppLp8rHS0J7DhZBjSms7o1L5kbGzt5AaBY-9Hq1jbrpaI8m44sNw_dg?key=qsxGBEkQhvoNC0by3Umd8w\" />\n\nActive and passive execution are used in tandem to maximize liquidity sourcing. Price impact modeling and gas cost determine the intraday trading schedule and size. Historical data is used to determine initial parameters. We continuously monitor slippage, intraday price impact, and medium-term price impact and adjust execution parameters if necessary.\n\nIntraday price impact is measured as the likelihood of observable price divergence in the hour after trading. The medium-term impact is measured as the effect of trade size on the divergence relative to a peer benchmark.\n\n<img height=\"444\" width=\"602\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXebyP8Y0LelurvdX7559Y_lsZqAnZg_565TKi3V1iHy4TIeQuPPqURp6T5Loep2wPouHfhTYulL9dmhhutDrK-3f9amiQiDVBZNTmhVA60EpYhQ9DNPJWnETdNZhy1z6BfcuhEutie9KH19RxJAyw?key=qsxGBEkQhvoNC0by3Umd8w\" />\n\n*The example chart shows rolling slippage for one of Aera’s Trade Execution Customers*.\n\n<img height=\"419\" width=\"602\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeFOAHkefe0TGds3Ku642E3FP5jJCHgwcKvnPeKZs1SRZ9l8sUsEF_ofR0AqIimpxCXH-k54FpG1-c49tF0Tw1mT2SfCeK2PmrecejJYEBjiqE42TTLye_LAVepSVTW2uvUngNXlNPqv91_oEftAA?key=qsxGBEkQhvoNC0by3Umd8w\" />\n\n*The example chart shows the likelihood of intraday impact for one of Aera’s Trade Execution Customers.*\n\n**ADPC Vault Parameters**\n\n**ADPC Vault Parameters**\n\n* Chain: Arbitrum\n* Vault Owner: MSS (arb1:0x13d4Ff2A83fBCB8F5fc73cE66CF5928eD0943cB0)\n* Guardian: Gauntlet\n* Tokens: ARB, USDC\n* Protocols: Odos, Bebop, Llamapay\n* Strategy: Swap ARB for USDC; minimizing market impact\n* Payment Stream: streamed continuously over 6 months once the swap from ARB to USDC is complete\n* Fee: 0%\n\n### **ADPC Members Payment Process**\n\nOnce the ARB is converted into USDC, the Aera vault will utilize LlamaPay to stream the total payment due to the ADPC member wallet addresses over the course of the 6-month period (120k USDC per member, 360k USDC in total). The remainder of the converted funds (54k USDC) will remain in the MSS as the OpEx budget. This process will be coordinated with the MSS chairs and members.\n\n### **About Aera**\n\nAera is an on-chain solution to optimize DAO funds autonomously. It addresses the common pain point of inactive treasury management, which often hinders a DAO’s ability to maintain its runway, cover liabilities, and benefit from market growth. Unlike traditional institutions that rely on agile managers for fund allocation, DAOs face unique challenges, including governance and incentive alignment with external managers.\n\nTo address these, Aera offers a unified solution for efficiently and transparently managing on-chain treasuries, grants, and incentive funds through customizable vaults. Aera vaults can hold stablecoins, native tokens, and other cryptocurrencies, with their objective functions tailored to each DAO’s needs. Guardians leverage off-chain logic to automate rebalancing decisions, ensuring the vaults meet their objectives across various market scenarios and time horizons.\n\nYou can read more about Aera [<u>here</u>](https://docs.aera.finance/).",

      "title": "Ethereum Protocol Attackathon Sponsorship",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks funding from the Arbitrum DAO to support an Attackathon, a large-scale security audit event hosted by the Ethereum Foundation and Immunefi. The Attackathon will focus on securing the Ethereum protocol with three key phases: education, active bug hunting, and result evaluation. The initiative aims to raise over $2 million, with $500,000 already committed by the Ethereum Foundation. This effort is crucial for ensuring Ethereum’s stability, which is vital to maintaining the reliability of projects on Arbitrum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs a Layer 2 on Ethereum, Arbitrum is directly dependent on the security of the Ethereum protocol. Given that Arbitrum is EVM-compatible, any vulnerabilities in Ethereum could potentially impact Arbitrum’s ecosystem. This Attackathon is particularly timely given the recent major Ethereum hard forks, which have introduced new code that requires careful auditing.\n\nAdditionally, the Attackathon will include an educational program featuring live technical walkthroughs and detailed documentation from Ethereum Foundation, client teams, Solidity developers, and Immunefi. This program will cater to security researchers at all levels, helping to build a stronger security community around both Ethereum and Arbitrum. The increased awareness and participation in Ethereum’s security will ultimately benefit Arbitrum by ensuring a more secure underlying infrastructure.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe Attackathon aligns with Arbitrum’s mission to support a secure and scalable Ethereum ecosystem. By contributing to this initiative, Arbitrum will directly enhance Ethereum’s security, which supports the reliability of Arbitrum. Moreover, the educational component will upskill security researchers, giving them the tools to audit and secure both the Ethereum and Arbitrum ecosystems.\n\nAdditionally, Arbitrum will benefit from increased visibility as a proactive participant in Ethereum security efforts, enhancing its credibility and reputation among developers, users, and security researchers. By sponsoring the Attackathon, Arbitrum positions itself as a leader in the ecosystem, contributing to long-term sustainability and security.\n\n## Detailed Financial Justification\n\nThe goal of securing $2M in total funding aligns with other major security audits in the blockchain ecosystem. Comparable initiatives include:\n\n* MakerDAO contest on Sherlock: $1.35M\n* Euler contest on Cantina: $1.25M\n* Uniswap v4 contest on Cantina: $2.35M\n* Firedancer contest on Immunefi: $1M\n\nThe Attackathon funding goal reflects the importance of thoroughly securing Ethereum’s core protocol. With $500,000 already committed by the Ethereum Foundation, additional sponsorship from Arbitrum DAO will help us reach this $2M target, ensuring participation from top-tier security researchers and maximizing the event’s impact.\n\n## Outcome Metrics\n\nBy setting clear goals for participation, reports submitted, and transparency, we can effectively track the impact of the Attackathon. Key outcome metrics include:\n\n* Secure over 100 security researcher signups before the program's launch.\n* Achieve participation from over 100 distinct individuals submitting reports.\n* Submit more than 150 reports by the conclusion of the Attackathon.\n* Publish an audit-style report summarizing findings for the Arbitrum and Ethereum communities.\n\nThese metrics will demonstrate the program's effectiveness in attracting top security talent and identifying critical vulnerabilities across both ecosystems.\n\n## Community Feedback Loop\n\nTo ensure transparency and alignment with community expectations, we will provide regular updates on the Attackathon’s progress through Arbitrum forums and governance channels. These updates will include detailed reports on fund usage, security vulnerabilities identified, and overall outcomes. Community feedback will be encouraged through these platforms to maintain alignment with the community’s goals and priorities.\n\n## Breakdown of Expenditures\n\n100% of the funds raised from Arbitrum and other sponsors will be allocated to security researcher payouts based on the severity of the bugs they find. Immunefi has waived their usual fees for this event, so all funds will be directly used for researcher rewards. If any funds remain after the Attackathon, they will be rolled over to an audit contest focused on securing the Pecta hardfork.\n\n## Estimated Timeline\n\n* **November 20**: Detailed program announcement and education kickoff\n* **November 27**: Attackathon hunting begins\n* **January 22**: Attackathon concludes and results compilation begins\n* **January 23**: Review period begins\n* **Late March**: Results announced\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO is invited to sponsor the Attackathon with a **$100,000 USD commitment**, payable in ETH, ARB, or USDC. This sponsorship includes:\n\n* 1x Unique NFT with leaderboard rank\n* Leaderboard listing on the sponsor landing page\n* Mid-roll logo placement on Sponsor and Program Landing Page\n* An Arbitrum Boost (Audit Contest) on Immunefi with up to a $100K rewards pool at 100% Immunefi Discount within 180 days of the conclusion of the Ethereum program\n* 1x Dedicated Twitter post announcing sponsorship from Immunefi Twitter handle\n\nBy supporting the Attackathon, Arbitrum will leverage the event’s findings to ensure its network remains secure and robust. This initiative not only enhances security but also demonstrates Arbitrum’s commitment to the broader Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n## Multi-Sig Address for DAO Deposit\n\nTo deposit the funds, the Arbitrum DAO can use the following multi-sig address:\n**0x022ec7543BfB377BbEB6676E5ba5Ecf3950dA889**",

      "title": "An EIP-4824 powered daoURI for Arbitrum DAO",
      "content": "**Constitutional / Non-Constitutional** - Could be either, depending on execution (see details below)\n\n**Abstract** \n\nWe propose that the Arbitrum DAO takes control of its metadata by publishing a daoURI onchain. The daoURI, following EIP-4824, will create a single source of truth on the DAO, that cannot be altered by external agencies, is fully manageable via governance, bringing helpful context on the DAO onchain. This will be helpful for newcomers, tooling providers, and experienced governooors alike.\n\n**Adopting EIP-4824 requires no additional spend from the DAO treasury, and it makes no change to its smart contracts or governance structure.**\n\n**Background**\n\nEIP-4824 is a DAO metadata standard, akin to ERC-721 for NFTs. It has already been adopted by Snapshot, Aragon, Treasure, 1inch, Optimism Collective (through the Optimism Foundation), and multiple frameworks and DAOs. The adoption efforts are supported through grants from the Ethereum Foundation, Optimism Collective, ENS, Gnosis, Solana and many other stakeholders of the web3 ecosystem. \n\nDAOstar is also an Arbitrum Foundation grantee. The grant aims to improve the adoption of EIP-4824 within the Arbitrum ecosystem. We are allocating a portion of that grant to steward this proposal, and are requesting no additional funds from the DAO. \n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO is one of the largest DAOs. It has one of the most active governances, in terms of number participants as well as community-led initiatives. All of this activity, along with the scale and complexity of the Arbitrum DAO breeds a lot of metadata. This dataset grows with every new initiative and has multiple components that may not be very visible from the “outside”. For example, consider the following questions:\n\n1. Who are the current Security Council, Arbitrum Research & Development Collective, Procurement Committee members? (Answer: you can search the respective forum post to find this)\n2. Can you share a location that tracks all DAO-owned/managed multisig addresses? (Answer: this could be [https://www.arbwallets.xyz/ ](https://www.arbwallets.xyz/))\n3. Can you share a status update on the DAO’s grant spending? (Answer: R3gen Finance reports this on the forum)\n4. Where can we see delegate performance? (Answer: KarmaGAP or Tally)\n5. How much in sequencer fees is being collected? (Answer: there is a dashboard for this)\n6. What orbit chains exist? (Answer: the ecosystem page tracks this)\n7. Where to find recordings and transcripts of public meetings? (Answer: I’m not sure!)\n\nFor an active participant, these answers might not be very hard to find. But for the majority of people who are not active participants of the DAO, and even for tooling providers, collecting this information requires a painstaking amount of manual effort. This leads to inconsistencies, errors and outdated information.\n\nThe same concern echoes over the entire DAO ecosystem. There are over 200 DAOs at the moment with a treasury size of over $1M, and collecting information on them manually is becoming an exponentially difficult task. EIP-4824 was authored by DAOstar with the support from the Ethereum Foundation, Gnosis, Etherscan, DeepDAO, Snapshot, and a large number of DAO tooling companies, to create a better infrastructure for DAO data.\n\nAdopting EIP-4824 essentially means that the DAO publishes a daoURI onchain. daoURIs have a standard JSON-LD format:\n\n```\n{\n\"@context\": \"http://www.daostar.org/schemas\",\n\"type\": \"DAO\",\n\"name\": \"<name of the DAO>\",\n\"description\": \"<description>\",\n\"membersURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\"proposalsURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\"activityLogURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\"governanceURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\"contractsRegistryURI\": \"<URI>\"\n}\n```\n\nIt contains information on governance, members, activities and contracts by default. Outside of the endpoints mentioned above, a DAO can also choose to publish information that is specifically important to it. For Arbitrum, this could be information about orbit chains, different multi-sigs and councils, spending, sequencer fees, link to its constitution, etc. Essentially, **the daoURI creates an “official repository” of information on the DAO.**\n\nHere are some examples of how the daoURI could be used:\n\n1. It can be used to bring more context to contracts on block explorers. For example, we could go from this:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeicwwhselbr7texz3p6uev2wjfqmeylq64jyc44ylgo3fd7gn27qqu)\n    \n\nto this:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeiavyesuvk34jjrqtxnww4qgnhtykge2k5su2zah4ktjapr3sir42u)\n    \n\n2. We can make DAO data easily and freely available to everyone\n\nFor example, Arbitrum DAO’s current DeepDAO profile misses a ton of info - contracts, or revenue, or governance guardrails (councils and multi-sigs), etc. Messari’s Arbitrum DAO dashboard requires a paid membership to access, which could also be due to the difficulty of collecting and presenting DAO data (thus making it too valuable to give away for free). By making access to this information easy, we can greatly improve the DAO’s transparency. i.e, go from:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeidmobzr2ipdsu5j7gbzfonm5bmiwa5g77p4p22dugugzviblhyfju)\n    \n\nto this:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeiac35d73dgjnruhph4pmhxay3f5sh3psz4wkd3h2zsc75yb4ny23i)\n    \n    \n\n3. daoURI makes it much easier to structure metadata improvements.\n\nA specific example that surfaced during Arbitrum GovHack (*thanks to Paulo Fonseca)*: onchain proposals at Arbitrum DAO (or any DAO for that matter) do not reference a forum discussion. This takes away a lot of available information. If we wanted to change this, we could achieve it easily by enforcing a discussionURI field inside the proposalURI (which is a standard component of daoURI). Tally, Aragon, Snapshot X, and most governance tooling providers are members of DAOstar. Extending the standard will create an easy upgrade pathway for them and this change would reflect the change across the ecosystem.\n\nTo summarize, a daoURI creates a source of truth that is easily accessible by onchain and offchain tools. This proposal carries no additional cost, or changes to any existing smart contract or process. It’s a step in the right direction with no downside.\n\n**Specifications** \n\nAs mentioned above, adopting EIP-4824 essentially means that the DAO publishes a daoURI onchain. There are various ways to do this:  \n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreid5wi5tx3k2kinx4ew5ofuotwxztedbdhtolay4lpc3utg75pojwe)\n    \n\nBased on Arbitrum DAO's characteristics, we suggest the following adoption pathways:\n\n1. Executing a simple contract call to the EIP-4824 Registration Factory which'll deploys a new registration contract to store the daoURI. The registration will be on Arbitrum One network, setting the DAO’s governor timelock as admin, and a manager as the DAO decides. This would require a constitutional proposal. \n\n2. Set a new 'daoURI' txt record on arbitrumfoundation.eth. Arbitrum Foundation will have complete edit access to this daoURI as they own arbitrumfoundation.eth. A daoURI published through this method will not be editable via an onchain vote. However, this method is in some sense easier than the previous, and it requires no onchain vote. This would be a non-constitutional proposal. When the time comes, the DAO can also adopt EIP-4824 through method 1 to have full control over its data. \n\nTransactions for reference: [Unlock Protocol](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/unlock/proposal/88514909609252335816460489315313822288366112768901791852399180053604763902892), [Treasure](https://snapshot.org/#/treasuregaming.eth/proposal/0x957349f6d60f07e95d6e426536996af96ca63f0b9e0495ee8e73554207cb2381) and [1inch](https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0xc25a02d6520fd69ae98ef10b72f3024db2e710d00d51fbc7c03581710e0b8b7b) \n\n**Steps to Implement** \n\n**Create a daoURI for Arbitrum DAO:** Based on conversations during the Arbitrum GovHack, and feedback from various delegates and contributors over the past 4 weeks, we have built this daoURI for Arbitrum: \n\n[https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUrBuJLBCZKnnEebwRe2Yqh3fk39H2mtqPQjMPUwVC1Ap](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUrBuJLBCZKnnEebwRe2Yqh3fk39H2mtqPQjMPUwVC1Ap)\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidxb7bo3femntln3qka2de3czdxe6eeys3g62v6enosx5admm6eua)\n    \n\nIt is presently stored on IPFS, and uses APIs from Tally, Snapshot for governance data. We recommend that if the Arbitrum Foundation ends up being the manager, the daoURI be stored in their GitHub for ease of editing, and higher transparency. DAOstar will work with the Foundation on implementation. \n\nNote that this is a starting point. The daoURI of Arbitrum DAO will continuously evolve and become more comprehensive over time.\n\n**Publish the daoURI onchain:** As detailed in the execution summary above, this will either be a  smart contract call to deploy a new contract, or setting a new txt record on arbitrumfoundation.eth \n\n**Maintain the daoURI:** (Pathway 1) Though daoURI is fully manageable through governance, it is not practical to initiate an onchain vote for every upgrade. To solve this, the DAO can set one or many *manager*s to manage its daoURI. The Arbitrum Foundation has agreed to take on this role if the DAO decides so. DAOstar will commit to maintaining Arbitrum DAO’s daoURI for a year for at additional cost. Note that *managers* can be added or removed easily by the DAO. \n\n(Pathway 2) The DAO will not have the capability to change the daoURI through governance. However, it can instruct the Arbitrum Foundation to do so. \n\nIrrespective of the adoption pathway, we would like to see the daoURI maintained through a community-led effort. We suggest that whoever is set as a *manager* maintain a forum discussion to discuss updates. That way, any Arbitrum DAO member can publicly request to add a missing piece of info to the daoURI.\n\n**Timeline** \n\nUnless the DAO has any feedback on the daoURI above, this proposal is ready for execution. \n\n**Overall Cost** \nThis proposal does not require any transfer of funds from the DAO treasury.",

      "title": "Research on context and retention",
      "content": "**Non-Constitutional**\n\n# Abstract\n\nTogetherCrew is a project, incubated in RnDAO, that aims to empower communities with their data. With a team of network scientists, TogetherCrew is **researching how Web3 social networks behave, with a special emphasis on retaining new community members and community health**.\n\nTogetherCrew is requesting read access to Arbitrum’s Discourse and Discord API to run an analysis with our partners (researchers at the University of California Santa Barbara) and present it to the community for research purposes.\n\nFor clarity, this analysis **ONLY uses data that is already publicly available. No private data will be collected.** No data will be sold to third parties nor used without consent.\n\nThis proposal also allows us to test Hivemind, a bot that reads public data from Discourse and Discord and allows community members to ask questions: e.g. \"has anyone discussed the topic of Treasury management before?\" or \"What were the most common objections to proposals related to incentives?\".\n\n**No budget is required** as this research has already been funded through other sources (academic grants and previous Web3 grants from Aave, Aragon, Celo, Pocket Network and MetaCartel to develop the data pipelines, infrastructure, and previous [research on community helath](https://rndao.mirror.xyz/F-SMj6p_jdYvrMMkR1d9Hd6YbEg39qItTKfjo-zkgqM)).\n\n# Motivation\n\nOur understanding of Web3 social networks is still in its infancy. Studying the configuration of a social network and its impact on member retention could yield valuable insights to improve the resilience of Web3 communities.\n\nAdditionally, the social network mapping analysis gives us a potential tool to identify high-context community members (e.g. a recent analysis of Optimism’s community enabled their community team to [identify potential community ambassadors](https://medium.com/togethercrew/case-study-how-optimism-added-science-to-the-art-of-community-management-dfab84727a6c) who had been missed). This analysis could be used to suggest members to invite to the offsite (non-binding, just as an exploratory analysis).\n\n# Specifications\n\nWe care about data privacy. We only collect data that is already in the public domain (e.g. public discourse posts yes, but not the email addresses associated with their account). Feedback was provided by the Arbiturm Foundation on our [privacy policy ](https://www.togethercrew.com/privacy-policy)and [terms of service](https://www.togethercrew.com/terms-of-service).\n\nThe solution is based on an (open-source) bot that will get read access to selected community platforms (for now Discourse and public channels in Discord). This bot has already been deployed in 100+ communities, including Optimism, Celo, Aave, Aragon, Shardeum, etc. **The permissions are configured to be low-risk** (no admin permission, no managing channels, etc. so even if the bot was hacked, the discord and discourse servers wouldn't be compromised) and we have battle-tested for scalability and reliability.\n\nThe analyses of the data are performed by the TogetherCrew team of scientists and our research partners at the University of California Santa Barbara. Those handling the data have undergone ethical data management training and could lose their academic credentials for unethical conduct.\n\nThe architecture has been developed by our tech lead who’s ex-Accenture and built a data startup in the medical industry. So although the data we manage is low risk (no private data, only public handles, etc.) we’re still investing in data security progressively.\n\nWe don’t use the data to train any AI models. Some analyses might use AI, in which case we favour open-source models that don’t feed on user data.\n\n**Changes to the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy:**\nTogetherCrew currently has no changes planed, but should a change be planned, TogetherCrew will give a minimum of 2 weeks' notice to the DAO, via a new proposal post, before such changes take effect. Thus allowing any delegate to submit a snapshot vote to suspend the service if desired.\n\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nA favourable snapshot vote will give the foundation the permission to give us read access to the Discourse API and public Discord channels. No further actions are required. We'll present our findings to the community (progressively over 1-3 months).\nAdditionally, we'll run a pilot of Hivemidn which uses this same data to answer community questions.\n\n# Budget\n\n**No budget requested**\n\nWe do hope in the future to develop additional functionalities communities would pay for. E.g.:\n\nIn parnterhip with SingulairtyNET we’ve been developing [Hivemind](https://deepfunding.ai/proposal/hivemind-augmented-qa-bot-and-p2p-knowledge-base/) - an AI-powered Q&A bot that acts as a research assistant enabling community members to ask questions such as:\n* “How do I participate in governance?”\n* “Has anyone proposed something on topic XYZ?”\n* “What was discussed last month while I was away”\n* etc.\n\nAnd funded by the Arbitrum questbook program we’re also developing [Dynamic Reputation NFTs](https://new.questbook.app/dashboard/?role=builder&chainId=10&grantId=0x4494cf7375aa61c9a483259737c14b3dba6c04e6&proposalId=0x62b&isRenderingProposalBody=true), where members who desire to do so can mint their context score onchain. Thos who don’t desire it, don’t need to take any action, the NFTs are opt-in only.\n\nFor now, the solution is made available free of charge.\n\n**Had there been a previous proposal?**\nWe had posted about this some time ago but didn’t move forward with it. Now with the discussion around context we’re curious to explore that and see if we can provide a solution to the DAO.\n\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/community-health-analytics-and-reputation-nfts-in-arbitrumdao/24859",

Their proven track record in blockchain infrastructure will bolster the network’s performance and security.\nRationale\nInfura’s validator has been running successfully for a while, participating in the Data Availability Committee (DAC), but was not previously whitelisted. This oversight was discovered during testing. Whitelisting this validator will increase the number of active validators on Nova, enhancing overall security and reliability. Their infrastructure and operational expertise will significantly contribute to the stability and reliability of the Arbitrum Nova network.\n\nSpecifications\n- Whitelist the Infura Nova validator.\n- Ensure compliance with Arbitrum Nova’s validation requirements.\n\nConclusion\nBy whitelisting the Infura Nova validator, we enhance the network’s robustness and reliability, supporting Arbitrum’s long-term growth and stability.",

      "title": "Upgrade Governor Contracts by Transfering Timelock Roles to the New Governors",
      "content": "### **Abstract**\n\nThis proposal will transfer the proposer and canceller roles from the current Arbitrum Core Governor and Arbitrum Treasury Governor to newly deployed Governor contracts. This roles transfer is a crucial step in upgrading the Arbitrum DAO's governance infrastructure.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nThis upgrade to the Arbitrum DAO's governance system was initially discussed as part of the 'Expand Tally Support for the Arbitrum DAO' proposal [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/expand-tally-support-for-the-arbitrum-dao/22387). The community recognized the need for enhanced governance features, including proposal cancellation and flexible voting mechanisms.\n\nAs a result of these discussions, new Governor contracts have been developed and deployed with these improvements. To activate these enhancements and complete the upgrade process, we now need to transfer the proposer role to these new contracts.\n\n### **Specifications**\n\nThis proposal will:\n\n1. Grant the newly deployed Core Governor and Treasury Governor contracts the 'PROPOSER\\_ROLE' and 'CANCELLER\\_ROLE' on the timelock contract.\n2. Revoke the current Core Governor and Treasury Governor contracts' 'PROPOSER\\_ROLE' and 'CANCELLER\\_ROLE' on the timelock contract.\n\n### **Technical Details**\n\n* **This proposal has a longer than usual L1 timelock delay of 10 days, so the existing governors can still be used for proposing until the voting period of this proposal has ended.**\n* The new Governor contracts have been deployed on Arbitrum One at the following addresses:\n  * Core Governor: `0x7796F378B3c56ceD57350B938561D8c52256456b`\n  * Treasury Governor: `0x4fd1216c8b5E72b22785169Ae5C1e8f3b30C19E4`\n* These new contracts include the following enhancements:\n  1. **Proposal Cancellation**: Allows the delegate who submitted a proposal to cancel it during the delay phase, before voting begins.\n  2. **Flexible Voting**: Enables delegates to cast rolling, fractional votes, supporting future innovations like voting from Orbit chains and more.\n* The new Governors maintain all existing features of the current Governors, including custom relay functionality and fractional quorum calculations.\n\n### **Rationale**\n\nThe rationale for upgrading the Governors by granting and revoking roles on the Timelock contract instead of using the proxy upgradeable contract pattern is discussed in detail in [this forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-governance-smart-contract-upgrade-technical-details/24642).\n\n### **Security Considerations**\n\n* The [new Governor contracts](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/310) have been [tested and audited](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-governor-v2-review/26118) by OpenZeppelin.\n* This transfer does not move any funds or change permissions on the Timelock contracts.\n* Historical governance actions will remain visible and valid.\n\n### **Post-Transfer Actions**\n\n* Immediately after this transfer executes, Tally will update to interface with the new Governor contracts.\n* Delegates should use the new Governor contracts for all future proposal submissions.\n* The old Governor contracts will remain on-chain but will no longer have the ability to execute proposals.\n\n### **Timeline**\n\nIf this proposal passes, the transfer will be executed immediately after the Timelock delay.\n\nBy approving this proposal, the Arbitrum DAO will upgrade its governance infrastructure, enabling new features and improvements in the governance process.",

ARB cap: 16,500.\n\n**Note:** *ARB Cap for each Tier **includes a 30% buffer** and will be recalculated on the basis of the ARB price at the time of submitting the proposal for voting in Tally.*\n\n**Note 2:** *We will use the Coingecko rate at the time of payment to determine the value of ARB each month.*\n\n**Payments to delegates are expected to be processed in ARB from the MSS between the 15th and 16th of each month.**\n\n## Conflict resolution\n\n### Dispute\n\nDispute System will be maintained as the original program.\n\n### DIP Ban\n\nYou can see details about this [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-delegate-incentive-program-dip/26496#p-57276-dip-ban-15).\n\n### DIP Suspension\n\nYou can see details about this [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-delegate-incentive-program-dip/26496#p-57276-dip-suspension-16).\n\n## Scoring\n\nTo determine which delegates will receive monthly payments, we will continue using the dashboard developed by Karma.\n\n**Note:** *The program manager may adjust the compensation parameters, provided they inform the DAO of the reasons for the changes.*\n\n### Scoring Weight Changes\n\n**Participation Rate (PR)**\n\n- **Change:** Weight is reduced to 15%, calculated based on the participation rate of the last 90 days in on-chain votes (as calculated by Karma).\n\n**Snapshot Voting (SV)**\n\n- **Change:** from 15% to 20%.\n\n**Communicating Rationale (CR)**\n\n- **Change:** from 25% to 10% (v1.5) or 15% (v1.1)\n\n**Proposal Feedback (PF)**\n\n- **Change:** From 15% to 30% (v.1.5) or 25%(1.1).\n\n**Total Participation (TP)**\n\n- **Change:** from +60% to +65% to receive compensation.\n\n**Bonus Point (BP)**\n\n- **Change:** Adding Bonus Points for delegates attending the “Arbitrum Open Governance Call” and the ‘Bi-weekly Governance Call.”\n\n For both calls, 2.5% BP will be awarded for attendance.\n\n### Delegates’ Feedback Scoring System Options\n\n## Option 1 - Delegates Incentive Program v1.1: Maintain the Current Proposed System With Some Modifications\n\n### Proposal Feedback (PF) Update - Formerly Commenting on Proposals (CP)\n\n* Communicating Rationale (CR): Weight 15%\n\n* Proposal Feedback (PF): Weight 25%\n\n- **100% Weight for Early Stage Feedback (ESF):** Feedback provided until the day a proposal is sent to Snapshot (typically by Thursday at 00:00 UTC) will receive 100% weight.\n\n- **60% Weight for Late Stage Feedback (LSF):** Feedback provided from the start of the voting period to the end of the month (starting Thursday at 00:00 UTC) will receive a 40% reduction in weight.\n\n### Administrative Budget v1.1 (option 1)\n\nWe have updated the operational costs for administering this new program. This payment will be distributed over 12 months and sent regularly along with the payments to the delegates.\n\n**Karma Details:**\n\n- $5800/month * 12 = $69,600 for continuing to build and enhance the dashboard.\n\n**SEEDGov Details:**\n\n- 2 Program Administrators (1 Part-Time - 1 Full-time): $117,000 over 12 months.\n\n- 1 Data Analyst (Part-Time): $35,000 over 12 months.\n\n**Total:** $152,000 ($12,667 per month)\n\n## Budget Summary\n\n- USD 4,200,000 in Incentives. Delegates' compensation is capped at 16,500 ARB per delegate per month (Tier 1), which means the maximum spending on incentives would be 9,900,000 ARB per year (16,500 ARB x 50 delegates x 12 months). The ARB cap already includes a 30% buffer, and it will be recalculated before Tally.\n\n- USD 69,600 +30% ARB buffer for Dashboard maintenance and upgrade\n\n- USD 152,000 +30% ARB buffer for Operational Costs/Program Administration.\n\n**Total:** USD 4,421,600\n\n**Note:** *USD costs are fixed, meaning that if the price of ARB increases, the USD costs will remain the same. At the end of the program, any remaining ARB tokens from the program will be returned to the treasury.*\n\n**Note 2:** *Any remaining funds from the experimental incentive program multisig will sent back to the treasury.*\n\n**Note 3:** *Final amounts in ARB will be recalculated on the basis of the ARB price at the time of submitting the proposal for voting in Tally.*\n\n**Note 4:** *The funds will be sent to the recently approved* MSS.\n\n**Note 5:** *If the program exceeds 65 participants (which is the number that we believe we could cover with the budget requested) we will reopen discussions in the forum on the budget, also considering the possibility of increasing the number of delegates incentivized.*\n\n## Option 2 - Introducing Delegates Incentive Program v1.5: a New Evaluation System for Delegates’ Feedback\n\nInstead of counting comments on proposals that reach Snapshot, we propose implementing a monthly analysis of the feedback provided by delegates, regardless of whether the proposal/discussion has reached Snapshot.\n\nIn this way, the Program Administrator would be responsible for creating a rubric that evaluates the value and timeliness of the feedback provided by delegates. \n\n***Note: in this option the weight of Communicating Rationale (CR) is 10% and for Delegates’ Feedback is 30% instead of 15% and 25% like in the proposed V1.1.***\n\n### Evaluation Approach\n\nThis rubric assesses the overall feedback provided by the delegate throughout the month (from day 1 at 00:00 UTC to the last day of the month at 23:59:59 UTC), based on a summary of their participation in various proposals and discussions.\n\n* Key point: Feedback or opinions that violate community rules will not be considered.\n\n### Rubric Specifications\n\nThe parameter “Proposal Feedback” should be renamed to \"Delegate’s Feedback” in this case since we’re analyzing the overall feedback provided by the delegate (not just proposals on snapshot) and will maintain a maximum weight of 30%, the score will be awarded based on the following rubric:\n\n![|602x471](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfMR0vvihktjB6t-iKq9OgMUxMwgEhD4SqI7hWb0rlKUkkCSHMfvlWEgHL4gvFTzpoJ07_FNqVRkXzPKw9PkbFXGXLrv66FqH1PIImG-H2nShlp7EzTWd9V9BgU_gq9-lUVKgp9ryuSLgedYx1-djIwkng?key=z0llyoBlBsbRIxKCLzkjNQ)\n\n### Monthly Evaluation Process\n\n**1. Data Collection**\n\n**2. Overall Evaluation**\n\n**3. Score Assignment**\n\n**4. Monthly Report**\n\n### Scoring Methodology\n\nEach rubric criterion has levels with an assigned score, from 1 to 4, depending on the level achieved.\n\nThe initial score is obtained by adding the first five criteria, while the final score results from applying the “Presence in Discussions” multiplier to the initial score. The maximum Initial Score is 20 points and 30 points for the Final Score.\n\nAlso if v1.5 is chosen, this scoring system will be in a testing phase, and we, as Administrators, commit to submitting it to the DAO for consultation after three months of running the program.\n\n### Administrative Budget v1.5 (option 2)\n\nThis option changes the responsibilities and budget of the Program Administrators. It requires more human resources to expand the Delegate’s Feedback analysis and additional time and resources to develop and train the AI for automation.\n\nNew budget details:\n\n* On the Program Administrator side: $16,000/month - $192,000/year (2 program administrators, both full-time instead of 1 part-time and 1 full-time + 1 data analyst part-time)\n\n* On the Dashboard and Tools provider side: $7250/month - $87,000/year\n\n* Total administrative budget: $279,000/year (6,6% of the delegates’ incentives budget)\n\n## Management and development of the Delegate Incentives Program: Responsibilities and Deliverables\n\nThe SEEDGov team and Karma will continue to collaborate to maintain and manage this new version of the DIP.\n\n### Program Dashboard Management (Karma)\n\nSee the responsibilities breakdown [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-delegate-incentive-program-dip/26496#p-57276-program-dashboard-management-karma-35).\n\n### Program Manager (SEEDGov)\n\nSee the responsibilities breakdown [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-delegate-incentive-program-dip/26496#p-57276-program-manager-seedgov-36).\n\n## KPIs\n\nSee the KPIs breakdown [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-delegate-incentive-program-dip/26496#p-57276-program-manager-seedgov-36).",

      "title": "[Non-Constitutional] Funds to Bolster Foundation’s Strategic Partnerships Budget",
      "content": "# Abstract\nThis proposal requests 250 million ARB to enable The Arbitrum Foundation (a.k.a ‘The Foundation’) to further foster key strategic partnerships. All expenditures will follow The Foundation’s well-established practices and evaluation criteria when pursuing partnership deals. Should the proposal be approved by the ArbitrumDAO, the Foundation will update its next annual transparency report due in Q1 2025 to include and detail this additional budget.\n\n# Motivation\nIn line with its mission as seen in its [bylaws](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/The%20Arbitrum%20Foundation%20Bylaws%2020%20July%202023-d992cde49b3207e89bdec76322e29048.pdf), The Foundation is committed to fostering ecosystem growth through strategic partnerships. All agreements are designed to support projects that can grow the Arbitrum ecosystem and provide value to the ArbitrumDAO. By seeking projects that advance or contribute to the adoption of Arbitrum technology, the Foundation aims to grow activity on the Arbitrum networks.\n\nAgreements typically last for a few years in order to align a project’s interests with the long-term objectives of the Arbitrum ecosystem. This results in significant capital locked in commitments and reserved for projects based on the agreed performance milestones. This restricts the Foundation’s ability to pursue new partnerships and stay ahead of the competition. Given the aggregate size of Foundation’s current budget, it is difficult for us to pursue multiple large deals simultaneously.\n\n# Challenges\nThe Foundation runs two funding programs:\n\n* Arbitrum Foundation Grant Program\n* Strategic Partnership’s Program\n\nBoth programs invite applicants from the ecosystem while actively pursuing new opportunities by participating in competitive bids to prospective partners. In both cases, The Foundation signs milestone-based agreements with the recipient that are often multi-year contractual commitments. To date, agreements for our strategic partnerships program typically exceed 2M ARB with an average duration of 2.1 years.\n\n*Table: Capital Commitments to Grants, Strategic Partnerships and Infrastructure Service Providers*\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibub2zxpre2wwuuetnzxqnwuea4yrjtfknh5mb6p3jebvvk7sd76q)\n\n*1) Includes payments made in ARB converted to USD using the ARB spot price at the time of payment*\n*2) Includes both [confidential and non-confidential grants](https://arbitrumfoundation.notion.site/d8de51f4a1b84b18ab33b2c9d14c69ae?v=4b8df83cbb7e4da9ad1e9b0e9354389a)*\n*3) Includes items that fall outside the scope of the rows above*\n\nThis table provides an overview of The Foundation’s outstanding capital commitments since its inception, as of June 30th 2024. Based on the stage of commitment, we can classify all existing deals into two categories:\n\n* **Signed agreements.** The Foundation and the grant recipient or service provider have entered into an agreement. Most grant recipients will be entitled to grant payouts as milestones and/or other criteria are reached. The amounts in the table reflect the value of future financial obligations related to signed agreements.\n\n* **Pre-agreement offer.** An agreement has not yet been reached but is in negotiation. The Foundation has reserved funds to ensure we can act upon the commitment when an agreement is reached. The amounts in the table reflect the full value of the agreement.\n\nIn both cases, The Foundation must have adequate reserves available before it can make an offer to a potential partner. Given the competitive landscape, The Foundation must be able to make multiple offers to different partners simultaneously, and be prepared for all offers to be accepted and reserve amounts accordingly even if negotiations fail at a later stage.\n\nWith the above in mind, The Foundation is at a distinct disadvantage from extending competitive offers to strategic partners due to the size of our overall allocation from the DAO. The three major financial challenges currently facing The Foundation from extending continued support to ecosystem expansion are:\n\n* **Tight budget.** Relative to competitors, the budget that the Foundation can allocate for strategic partnerships is small and puts the Arbitrum ecosystem at a significant disadvantage. For example, if we consider allocations relative to token supply, Starknet has allocated ~20% to its Foundation and grants, Optimism has 25% for ecosystem funding, ZkSync has 19.9% for ecosystem initiatives, while The Arbitrum Foundation has 7.5% allocated, but to date, The Arbitrum Foundation has only had access to approximately 1.8% because of the vesting contract. \n\n* **Vesting.** The Foundation can only make offers based on the ARB that has vested to date. This is because the ArbitrumDAO can clawback the funds at any time and we must have the ARB available to pay milestones. The Foundation is committed to being solvent at all times, so our assets should always exceed our contractual liabilities.\n\n* **Capital lockup.** All committed ARB in a milestone-based agreement must be allocated until the agreement terminates. Additionally, some agreements require capital lockup (like RWAs), in projects where the funds belong to the Foundation, but they are utilized by the strategic partner’s protocol.\n\nTogether, The Foundation does not yet have access to its full budget which has caused issues over the past year, but even if the vesting was complete, our budget still remains the smallest amongst all rollups. This impacts all programs run by The Foundation including strategic partnerships, technical advancement, educational and community activities.\n\nWe believe the most straightforward approach to ensuring The Arbitrum Foundation can pursue competitive deals is by increasing our budget for strategic partnerships.\n\n# Proposed Solution\n\n**Funding Request: 250 million ARB**\n\nIn light of the aforementioned challenges, here are the reasons why we believe that increasing our budget to specifically better support strategic partnerships is essential:\n\n* **High costs of pursuing partnerships.** Strategic partnerships are essential for the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth, and these partnerships often come with significant capital investments from The Foundation. For example, onboarding RWAs is both challenging and capital-intensive, as experienced by the DAO as well.\n\n* **Expanding Orbit Chains.** Despite more than 50 chains publicly announcing their intent to build using Orbit since the launch of the Arbitrum Expansion Program in January 2024, the rollup as a tech stack ecosystem is still in its early stages. Additional funding is required to enable The Foundation to pursue major Orbit partnerships and allow the Arbitrum ecosystem to access new markets, use cases and communities.\n\n* **Gateway to DAO.** The DAO has previously contributed to onboarding partners via programs like STEP, however, the experience has been that most institutions are not inclined toward engaging and participating in public forums, and even when they do it is after extensive conversations with The Foundation and its service providers, who are making them aware of the opportunities and encouraging them to get involved. As front-line enablers, The Foundation actively builds relationships with partners and encourages all partners to engage with the DAO. Most recent examples include Securitize (via BlackRock BUIDL) and Franklin Templeton.\n\n* **Proven track record.** The Foundation has a proven track record of managing and allocating funds effectively for various initiatives, as evidenced by the [2024 Biannual Progress Report](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/ArbitrumFoundationBiannualReport2024H1-c8e9ab997fe68ad09c0105181f9826d8.pdf) and successful collaborations with industry-leading projects. Additionally, The Foundation has capitalized on emerging opportunities such as LRTs, RWAs and onchain gaming, ensuring the Arbitrum ecosystem remains competitive and innovative.\n\nWe also believe the current vesting schedule for our entire budget is still critical to remain as is for setting expectations for The Foundation and holding us accountable for how we execute our mission statements. This sets a good example that all programs approved by the DAO must remain accountable and should not assume they can receive all their funding immediately.\n\nWith the above in mind, we are requesting 250 million ARB from the ArbitrumDAO, to focus on agreements fulfilling the following 3 criteria:\n\n* Key opportunities exceeding 2 million ARB\n* New agreements signed after approval of this proposal\n* Contractual commitments lasting 1 year or longer\n\nSome foreseeable capital-intensive areas include but are not limited to, expanding the Orbit Chain ecosystem, securing new RWA opportunities, and onboarding well-known TradeFi institutions on Arbitrum. Tokens will only be allocated on an as-needed basis and will only be exchanged as contractual obligations need to be fulfilled.\n\nThe Foundation plans to expand on the special strategic partnership allocation in our future Transparency Reports. Our goal is to enhance visibility into how these collaborations are structured and how resources are allocated, giving the DAO a clearer understanding of the impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem. At the same time, we remain committed to respecting any confidentiality provisions stipulated in such agreements. By balancing transparency with confidentiality, The Foundation aims to balance both the sensitivity of onboarding traditional institutions to Arbitrum and also providing updates to the DAO on how the funds are being spent.\n\nOur goal with this proposal is not to maintain the status quo, it is to ensure that we can continue to foster ecosystem growth through strategic partnerships. The funds will not be used for Arbitrum Foundation operating expenses, including marketing, operations, service providers, or existing signed agreements.",

This means less proposals hit the mark as they could, and new talent churns and is not retained.   \n2. Lack of dedicated **post-GovHack support** to comprehensively develop promising proposals that go the distance and make the difference the DAO needs at this moment in time.\n\nThis new version (v3) is\n\n- Optimised to **respect delegates' time** with tight specific sessions for them to participate and optional engagement in the open event programming as they wish.  \n- More condensed **2.5 day** IRL event  \n- Total cost **$156k (**$146k+10k) contingency (vs $262k in Brussels). It is substantially cheaper to run the IRL component in Thailand.   \n- Enhance with a dedicated 4-week **onramp** and 4-week **afterburner** of online support.\n\nWe have been listening, gathering requirements, and are committed to reinventing GovHack as an ever evolving structure and process for what the DAO needs.\n\nWhat’s emerged as central: \n\n**We must strike the right balance between exclusivity for effectiveness** and **inclusivity for fresh ideas.**\n\nEnter: **GovHack**\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicsjyclsa5sgd7pjuqt4vacofqcc2yqndd2jgd6p3cjugubspuxy4)\n    \n## 4-week Onramp (online)\n\n* Core delegates topics prioritisation  \n* Mapathon  \n* Format and agenda finalisation  \n* Fair Core & Open participant criteria finalisation  \n* Enrol hackathon participants and secure pre-submission of proposals that may already be in progress\n\n## 3-day in-person GovHack\nWhere: Bangkok  \nWhen: Nov 8-10\n\n**Day 1** \\- Arbitrum Core Day \\- existing key stakeholders deep engagement and strategic decision-making  \n**Day 2** \\- Hackathon Day \\- fresh talent is activated to innovate on maximally aligned strategic goals for the DAO  \n**Day 3** \\- Open Community Day \\- winning ideas are shared, ecosystem partners, existing DAO contributors and newcomers talk straight, what’s next, gameplan a coordinated path forward, how we win together.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeialjkr4hxnhuqpg2aqzon3oijvc4v4lv7gfaxddnp6jns3vcwdqjm)\n\n## 4-week online Afterburner / Aftercare (online)\n\n* Online PitStops  \n* Proposal mentorship  \n* Programme matchmaking \n\nMiro diagrams: [here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKhxT0kM=/)\n\n## Motivation\n\nCompetition is fierce, attention is scarce, and mercenary capital is everywhere.   \nWe must adapt, get organised and exercise strong leadership.\n\nAll major ecosystems are showing up strong and investing heavily.\n\nMantle $15.7m, Filecoin $19m, per event costs anywhere from $100k \\- $1m+, see: [Blockchain Events Industry Market Research](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t52I38_-nmMBhZvgim9XLOWxGyBgQaqKQvW8xIdFh6g/edit?gid=0#gid=0) we have gathered.  \nArbitrum Events spend between the Foundation ($5.6m), DAO, QuestBook is under $7m.  \n**We are underspending comparatively.**\n\nThere is a prime opportunity for Arbitrum to have a **strong presence at Devcon** as the leading, most mature, and capable DAO.   \nLet’s continue this tradition out in front to close 2024\\.\n\nGovHack will achieve the dual goals of serving **existing stakeholders'** highest needs at this time and showing a strong public face and opportunity **for new talent** to learn and get involved in the DAO. \n\n## Rationale\n\n### Why choose Hack Humanity\n\nRunning coordinated online \\+ IRL activations in new countries under tight time frames is non-trivial.\n\n1. **Track Record** executing 2 complex, successful and engaging events with challenging lead time (3.5 weeks, 4.5 weeks) and in new countries.  \n   1.

      "title": "ArbitrumDAO Off-site",
      "content": "# ArbitrumDAO Off-site\n\nNon-Constitutional\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of the directional proposal for an offsite which was voted in favour with 130mn ARB in Snapshot: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrumdao-off-site-directional-proposal/25660\n\nIMPORTANT:\nPlease vote based on the format selection. If you have concerns about the mechanism to define attendees or specific budget items (e.g. travel scholarships), please use a comment. Feel free to explain that any Tally approval vote would be conditional on XYZ. The vote I'm trying to focus it on the format selection.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to enhance the alignment, communication, and collaboration among token holders (including delegates) and key stakeholders by organizing a dedicated off-site event. The DAO currently struggles with achieving cohesive strategies due to sporadic interactions and a lack of direct engagement among key participants. To address this, a structured event will be organized in Q4, focusing on strategic alignment and problem-solving sessions.\n\n\nThis proposal includes a delegates and key stakeholders outreach and sense-making process to prioritise the most important agenda items to be discussed at the evente, ensuring the meeting time is focused on discussing the topic and not on discussing what to discuss or how to approach it. The event will then include professional facilitation to advance alignment, remove blockers, ensure proper note-taking, and generate clear action items on the selected topics.\n\n\nThe success of this initiative will be measured quantitatively by the NPS given by participants, and qualitatively by the outcomes and outputs from the sessions.\n\n\n## The Problem\n\n\nThe DAO encounters multiple challenges, but a critical issue is the lack of effective communication and alignment among delegates and key stakeholders. This results in fragmented strategies and slow decision-making processes. Important decisions and proposals often suffer due to inadequate collaboration and understanding among the members.\n\n\nAreas such as organizational design and strategic planning require not only well-crafted proposals but also thorough stakeholder engagement. We’re missing structured platforms for delegates and key stakeholders to engage deeply and collaboratively, leading to bottlenecks and slow and painful decision-making.\n\n\nThis proposal seeks to test a format for deliberation between key stakeholders with a clearly defined agenda. If successful, the format can be replicated to continuously address agenda items.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n\nRecent initiatives like the Delegates Day by Entropy and GovHack in Brussels highlight the potential for focused events to catalyse progress. We want to build on these learnings to advance the ArbitrumDAO. The proposal includes:\n\n\n1. Agenda prioritisation (pre-event strategic aligment)\n\n\n* Project manager to engage with token holders, delegates, and key stakeholders, distilling concerns and topic suggestions, and facilitating converging on the agenda. Including snapshot vote for agenda and format.\n* Careful planning of each session: aiming to share and agree on frameworks and approaches in advance, focusing IRL discussion on content and not format.\n* Defining criteria for attendees in consultation with key stakeholders to ensure both a successful event and capture resistance for the DAO.\n\n\n2. Facilitation & Workshop Organization:\n\n\n* Either IRL event or Online workshops (to be decided by this vote)\n* Structured facilitation process to ensure effective discussion, note-taking, and converging to action items.\n\n\n3. Post workshop follow up\n\n\n* Sharing a summary of the discussion & agreed action points\n* Follow up with participants a month after the workshop to track progress on action items and liaison with Entropy, Foundation, and other parties to suggest next steps as appropriate.\n\n\nOptional (see voting options):\n\n\n* Travel and Accommodation:\n  * Accommodation and catering for attendees and organisers.\n  * Travel expenses for attendees not already funded by the DAO for travel expenses and not otherwise in the region (e.g. not attending DevCon nor DevCon side events).\n  * Travel expenses “scholarship” available for attendees upon request and subject to approval by the event coordinator.\n\n\n## Timeline:\n\n\n* September: proposal approval and then logistics planning and preparation.\n* Event to take place during Q4, exact date depending on the snapshot vote (see below)\n* Before end of Q4: Post-event reporting and follow-up.\n\n\n## What Does Success Look Like?\n\n\n* High-quality outcomes and actionable strategies from workshops.\n* Increased engagement and satisfaction among participants.\n* Positive feedback and a strong desire to continue similar initiatives.\n\n\n## KPIs:\n\n\n* 50%+ participation rate among engaged ([35%+ on-chain voting rate](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates)) Top50 delegates, foundation, and off-chain labs.\n* NPS of 50 or more (-100 to 100 range, 0 considered average)\n* A similar initiative is organised again.\n\n\n## Options\n\n\n3 options are proposed. Please vote for the preferred one.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: the costs are not finalised but are here as an indicative so the best option can e selected. Once an option is selected we'll review the costs before moving to Tally. If you have any feedback on the costs, please share it with Daniel (@mrjackalop on Telegram) so it can be taken into account before the final onchain proposal.\n\n\n**Option 1: IRL version next to a major event:** \n\n\n* Next to DevCon Thailand, November 8th-10th.\n* 2-day event: day 1 arrival and facilitated dinner light discussion. Day 2 workshops. Day 3 breakfast and departure.\n* Including setup for hybrid participation (online participants supported with 360 cameras, moderator, and tech support)\n* Includes 20k travel scholarships for those not already in the region\n\n\naround $116k + 10k contingency\n\n\n**Option 2: IRL version separate from major event:**\n\n\n* In the most travel-friendly location for participants\n* During December 2024\n* 2-day event (same as above)\n* Including setup for hybrid participation (same as above)\n* Includes $50k travel for those not already in the region\n\n\naround $156k + 10k contingency\n\n\n**Option 3: Online Event:** \n* 3-4 online sessions (half-day sessions) over 1-2 months. With the possibility of input and feedback before/after event to ensure even those not attending can participate effectively.\n* During October-December 2024 (November likely skipped)\n\n\n around $35k + 5k contingency.\n\n\n\n\n[Detailed breakdown and comparison here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t_pdVwma1ja8k0If2c_Fv8u36ZatVP_8SS24XGO5Cgs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n**Notes on budget**:\n\n\n* high-level calculations. The budget will be revised in more detail (by requesting a quote from providers, etc.) after a successful Snapshot vote.\n* Any funds unspent will be returned to the DAO.\n* Funds will be denominated in ARB for tally vote\n\n\n\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n\n### Facilitation\n\n\nThe opportunity cost of this meeting is easily 10x its budget, given the limited time availability of delegates and few occasions a year when they converge. As such, good facilitation makes a critical difference in ensuring the meeting is effective. The facilitation includes designing the workshops and moderating the conversation, AND thinking through how to create a strategic process for a DAO.\nCosts of Online facilitation might be lower than IRL. We'll confirm this before the onchain proposal, for now costs are indicative to select a direction.\n\n\n### Agenda\n\n\nWe’ve already started the process of setting the agenda. We ran a survey, answered by 29 delegates with 86mn+ ARB represented. And then ran SimScore (a collective intelligence algorithm) to cluster responses and identify the key topics. The results are presented below to encourage further discussion.\n\n\nPre-selection of topics (to be refined and prioritised after the format is defined):\n* Defining strategic priorities for the DAO (vision and strategy)\n* DAO Budget (how much should the DAO be spending)\n* Org Design\n* ARB token utility\n* Conflict Of Interest\n* Grant programs (RPGF, what should be the focus, outcomes, etc.)\n\n\nAdditional work to be done to define the agenda:\n\n\n* 2 workshops and async discussion to identify root causes (root topics) and prioritise.\n* The final agenda will be defined via a subsequent Snapshot vote facilitated by the project manager.\n\n\n### Hybrid Participation for IRL events\n\n\nWe’ve successfully run a company retreat with hybrid participation (online+IRL). The setup works through using 360 cameras (equipped with a special mic, they cost about $600) and having an assistant with a laptop who can also support online participants in being heard (getting a turn to speak) and managing technical difficulties. The online setup is of course less good than being IRL but it is still viable to contribute to sessions (anyone leading a session does need to be IRL but, for input in the discussion, online works).\n\n\n### Attendees\n\n\n* Focused on high-context, expert, and senior participants. I.e. not an onboarding event.\n* Open to [Top-50 delegates](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates), off-chain labs, foundation members, and top 100 ARB token holders (both in Arbitrum One and Ethereum).\n* Additional attendees based on at least 20 million ARB endorsements (holders/delegates can endorse as many participants as desired).\n\n### Voting OPTIONS\n\nFormat: **ranked choice**\n\nOptions (due to Snapshots constraints the actual options available are shortened):\n1. RL event next to major conference (with travel scholarships for those not in the region) \n2. IRL event separate from major conference (with travel scholarships for those not in the region)\n3. IRL event next to major conference (NO travel scholarships)\nIRL event separate from major conference (NO travel scholarships)\n4. Online event(s)\n5. I believe we shouldI drop this and dedicate attention somewhere else\n6. Abstain",

      "content": "**Abstract**\n\nOn June 12th 2024, the DAO held an election for the role of STEP program manager to oversee ~$30 million diversified into liquid, stable and yield bearing RWAs. Steakhouse Financial won the vote with 60% in favor of their selection, with fees of $174,000 quoted in their application. \n\nThe Tally proposal in April 2024 listed 100k ARB as program management costs, which converted to $86,581 in June-July 2024 by the Arbitrum Foundation. This is insufficient to cover one year of Steakhouse Financials fees. Note: even if the ARB price had gone up, they would not have earned more - all applicant fees were quoted in dollar value and not ARB.\n\nThis proposal seeks input on the right way forward, with the options to\n- Approve only a 6 month contract from available funds\n- Earmark additional funds from yield earned so they complete the one year tenure\n- Not have a program manager, which will result in liquidation of the RWAs\n- Conduct a new RFP to select a program manager for one year at $86,581\n- Abstain\n\n**Motivation** \n\nOn April 10th 2024, the DAO approved 35 million ARB for diversification into RWAs. Of this, 100,000 ARB was budgeted for the role of program manager. The Arbitrum Foundation got an average price of 87 cents per ARB, resulting in $86,581 to pay the program manager.\n\n \n![2024-09-12 23.22.46.jpg](ipfs://bafkreicuaeyplf7wz2ayqzy33iailoxby5zohrg4gngmda4h5q3ja5otei)\n    \n\nIn June 2024, applications for the program manager role opened up where all applicants listed their fees in dollars. Given the funds received from the 100,000 ARB sale ($86,531) are less than the amount necessary to pay the $174,000 listed in Steakhouse Financials application, we need to either shorten their term to 6 months or approve an additional 6 months pay (from yield earned via the program). We can also declare the earlier election null and void while putting out a call for program managers willing to serve at $86,581 for a year. If there is no program manager to oversee investments, assets are liquidated and returned to the DAO.\n\n**Rationale** \n\nWhile writing the Tally proposal, 100k ARB was budgeted for the program manager role based on a sample quotation received from another provider and the prevailing ARB price at the time.\n\nSteakhouse financial and the other applicants prepared their budget in dollar value based on the sample provided instead of in ARB. As a result, the program manager role in the STEP program became under-budgeted and now needs approval from the DAO on provisioning either a shortened tenure of 6 months or additional funding to complete the one year. The additional funds will be requested from the yield earned on the RWAs (estimated at between $1-2 million per year) to prevent ARB liquidations. Alternatively, we can hold a new RFP seeking program managers at a fixed price of $86,581 for the year and invalidate the earlier election.\n\n**Specifications**\n\nThe STEP program is one of the largest diversification initiatives at any DAO, seeking to diversify our treasury while simultaneously growing the RWA ecosystem. Given the complications that can arise in managing the large sums of money, it is imperative that the DAO have a capable program manager to recommend liquidations ,conduct firedrills, monitor interest payments to the DAO treasury, and track underlying changes in service providers.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\n\nAfter ratification of Steakhouse Financials role as STEP program manager and whether it is 6 months or 1 year, the Arbitrum foundation will sign an agreement with Steakhouse Financial and begin investments into selected RWA providers.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n\nPost on forum\n\nUpload on Snapshot (Thursday, 12th September)\n\nFoundation negotiates agreement with Steakhouse and pays the first 6 months of their payment from the initial 100,000 ARB budgeted for in the STEP proposal\n\nAfter RWA yield is returned to the treasury, this proposal is taken to Tally requesting balance of $87,419 (provided one year tenure is approved in the snapshot)\n\n**Overall Cost**\n\nIf the entire one year tenure is ratified, the cost to the DAO is $87,419 paid via yield earned from the program. If 6 month tenure is approved, the cost is needing another election for program manager in a shortened time. If the proposal is rejected, we liquidate all $30 million and return assets to the DAO. If a new RFP is held seeking program manager services for $86,581 for a year, we delay the start of the STEP program and possibly get a less capable pool of applicants at the lower price point.\n\nThere is no budget required for work done on this proposal as it has been paid for through a Thrivecoin ThankArbitrum firestarter grant to the treasury and sustainability working group",

      "title": "Constitutional AIP: Proposal to adopt Timeboost, a new transaction ordering policy ",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis AIP proposes the adoption of Timeboost, a new transaction ordering policy for Arbitrum One and Nova. Timeboost enables auctions for the rights to an express lane, giving the winner a time advantage for transaction inclusion and allowing them to potentially capture arbitrage and backrunning opportunities. Proceeds from the auction are at the discretion of the Arbitrum DAO, with two main options outlined in this proposal: collecting bids in ETH or collecting bids in ARB.\n\n## Motivation\n\nArbitrum Chains currently order transactions on a First-Come First-Served basis (FCFS). The motivation to implement FCFS was threefold:\n\n1. Easy to understand and implement,\n2. Replicate Web2 user experience for instant transaction confirmation,\n3. Protect users against front-running,\n\nUnfortunately, relying solely on first-come first-served transaction ordering is not an ideal long-term solution.\n\nWhen opportunities to profitably arbitrage across exchanges arise on Arbitrum, “MEV Searchers” race to get their transaction included before anyone else so that they can capture this profit. This latency race involves a lot of spam, placing stress on chain infrastructure and causing searchers to wastefully invest in faster hardware. Furthermore, none of the MEV generated is captured by the chain and instead all profits are collected by searchers.\n\nTimeboost is a new transaction ordering policy that retains many of the great benefits currently in place for Arbitrum chains, including frontrunning protection and fast block times, while allowing the chain to reduce negative externalities from the racing behavior induced by MEV searchers. Additionally, it can socialize the benefits of the transaction sequencing market back to the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n## Rationale\n\n**Sustainable**: Timeboost offers the ArbitrumDAO an opportunity to capture additional revenue that does not come at the expense of users, since the value being captured already exists.\n\n**Technically-Inclusive**: Rather than capturing arbitrage opportunities by having the fastest hardware, participants can win these opportunities by bidding in an auction.\n\n**Neutral and Open**: The auction for the express lane is permissionless and participation is open to everyone, where the highest bid wins.\n\n**Empowerment**: The Arbitrum DAO can configure all aspects of Timeboost, including enabling or disabling it, the auction’s design, and how to handle proceeds.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n**Express Lane**: A separate path for submitting transactions to the sequencer that has priority access compared to normally submitted transactions.\n\n**MEV**: Maximal extractible value. In the context of Timeboost, MEV refers to the maximum amount of profit someone could make by including their transactions slightly faster than anyone else.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe full specification for the Timeboost auction can be found here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/timeboost-design.\n\nThe implementation consists of an auction contract and autonomous auctioneer:\n\n* **Auction contract** - Prospective bidders must deposit funds into the auction contract before bidding in the auction. The contract is also responsible for verifying bidders’ signatures, checking auction contract account balances, deducting the second-highest bid amount from the account of the highest bidder, and handling the proceeds.\n* **Autonomous auctioneer** - An offchain program that receives bids from participants and resolves the top two bids to the auction contract. This AIP proposes that the current sequencer operator provision and set up the autonomous auctioneer, if Timeboost is adopted.\n\nTimeboost changes the guarantees around transaction submission and introduces two different paths:\n\n* **Normal path** - Transactions in the normal path will experience a short delay (defaulted to 200ms), but will otherwise remain unchanged.\n* **Express lane** - Transactions in the express lane do not experience any delay.\n\nNearly all users will continue to submit transactions using the normal path. Timeboost introduces an express lane that can be purchased by sophisticated actors (like searchers) via an auction every minute, with each auction closing 15 seconds before the next round begins.\n\nAll bids in the auction are kept private until after the bid submission deadline and the auction winner will pay the same price as the second-highest bid of that round. A bid will only be accepted if it is at or above a minimum bid (the `reservePrice`). The autonomous auctioneer has the right to change the `reservePrice`, but it cannot be lower than the `minReservePrice`, which can only be changed by the ArbitrumDAO. Note, the `reservePrice` does not represent the expected value of a bid for the express lane, it is just a minimum bid that will be accepted.\n\nWe propose setting the `minReservePrice` to either 0.001 ETH or 3 ARB depending on which currency the DAO votes to collect bids in.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO can configure the currency in which bids are collected and how the remaining 97% of auction proceeds are handled. This AIP proposes two main options that the community can vote on if it decides to adopt Timeboost. Governance can change these options at any time.\n\n* **Collect ETH** - Collect bids in ETH and send the proceeds to the DAO treasury.\n* **Burn ARB** - Collect bids in ARB and burn the proceeds.\n\nDepending on which option the Arbitrum DAO chooses, the auction contract can either transfer the proceeds to a designated account or burn them.\n\nThe following data sources will eventually be saved and made available after Timeboost goes live on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, if this proposal passes:\n\n* Historical bid data for auction participants, outside of the two highest bids (that are otherwise posted on-chain)\n* A way to label/identify which transactions were sequenced in the express lane (i.e. Timeboosted transactions).\n\nFinally, the proposed version of Timeboost is compatible with a centralized sequencer. However, the Timeboost policy will also be compatible with proposals for a decentralized sequencer. 3% of auction proceeds would be set aside for the Arbitrum Developer Guild, which helps fund core Arbitrum development.\n\n## Timeboost Implementation Adjustments\n\n[Timeboost’s design](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/timeboost-design) is the culmination of over a year of research and development by the team at Offchain Labs. While the on-chain implementation will be independently audited by Trail of Bits before the Tally vote, the long term performance of Timeboost can only truly be evaluated with real-world data - data that can help hone and fine-tune Timeboost’s design for the benefit of the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nTo that end, although the auctioneer will function autonomously, **this AIP proposes granting the current sequencer operator the below rights to make the following adjustments from time to time for a period of two (2) years.** The rights described below are expected to only be exercised in circumstances **where doing so would enhance Timeboost’s long-term stability, preserve or improve the user experience for those using Timeboost-enabled Arbitrum chains, increase the security posture, resiliency, or stability of the chain, and/or otherwise help increase revenue for the ArbitrumDAO**:\n\n* The right to adjust the `NonExpressDelayMsec` parameter, which is the default delay that non-express lane transactions would be subject to. The default is 200ms, but adjustments could be to any value between 100ms & 500ms, inclusive.\n* The right to change the `maxBidsPerSenderInRound` parameter, a limit on the number of bids per participant per auction round, to mitigate against active or perceived Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on the auctioneer. The starting default will be 5.\n* The right to change the `reservePrice` to respond quickly to opportunities to increase the DAO revenue from Timeboost bid proceeds and/or to mitigate the risks of bidders colluding. To start, the `reservePrice` will simply be the minReservePrice.\n* The ability to rotate the auctioneer’s key for submitting bids and the reserve price setter key for changing reservePrice.\n* The right to impose a minimum balance/deposit requirement on Timeboost bidders in order to mitigate against active or perceived Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. The Arbitrum Foundation and Offchain Labs commits to sharing publicly post-mortems and analyses should this scenario arise.\n* The right to disable Timeboost entirely in the event of a security risk or otherwise malicious attempt to harm Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova node operators, existing deployed applications, and/or end users. The Arbitrum Foundation and Offchain Labs commits to sharing publicly post-mortems and analyses should this scenario arise.\n\nModifications to other Timeboost parameters, including to values outside the specified ranges and to those not already listed above, but which are otherwise listed in the design specification, will require a constitutional governance vote, in accordance with the [ArbitrumDAO Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution).\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nIf the ArbitrumDAO approves the AIP, the path would consist of:\n\n1. Discussion of the proposal on the forum (this post) and governance call(s). \n\n2. A vote on Snapshot to decide between*\n  * Option 1 (collect ETH), \n  * Option 2 (burn ARB), or \n  * Option 3 (decline to adopt Timeboost)\n3. Sufficient time for testing on a public testnet, such as Arbitrum Sepolia\n\n4. A third-party, independent audit of the Timeboost auction contract by Trail of Bits and subsequent fixing of any issues found, alongside publication of the audit report.\n\n5. An on-chain vote to deploy the upgrade on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.",

These emission programs are in place to be implemented, but need additional time to distribute ARB at reasonable reward rates.\n\nDue to some internal delay in launching GHO Safety Module and GHO Bridge, rewards for LM on Aave Protocol started later than expected, causing a delay in time and not being able to spend the amount allocated for ARB as planned.\n\n# Rationale\nThe currently implemented program has seen amazing success with over 5 million GHO bridged to Arbitrum that represents net new TVL for the ecosystem. Aave DAO plans to continue our incentive matching program with Merit once ARB incentives are fully utilized.\n\nHowever, due to the deplayed deployment in launching GHO Safety Module and GHO Bridge, rewards for LM on Aave Protocol started later than expected, causing a delay in time and not being able to spend that amount ARB as planned.\n\nAs a result, Aave DAO has not utilized the total amount of 375K ARB from the proposal earmarked for GHO deposit incentives and would like to seek an extension to avoid undue miscommunication and missed rewards for Arbitrum users. The distributed ARB will still retain a 3 month schedule from (the delayed) GHO deployment, in line with the initial program goals to do short term incentive programs.\n\n# Key Terms\n* Grant an extension on deadline to allocate remaining ARB from LTIPP Grant for Aave DAO to allocate.\n\n# Specifications\nThe extension will utilize the remaining ARB tokens from our original proposal for LM on Aave Protocol.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n1. None, it has already been implemented, it needs more time to reach full ARB distribution amounts.\n\n# Timeline\n* Start Date: September 2nd 2024\n* End Date: November 2nd 2024\n\n# Overall Cost\nThe extension utilizes the remaining ARB tokens from the originally approved 750K ARB grant. Over the 8 week period, this amount will be fully distributed as per our original LTIP grant.\n\nNo additional funds are being requested beyond the original grant allocation.",

The reasons for the republication being:\n\n1\\. The former was posted outside the approved calendar window of Thursday 12:00 UTC and we like to avoid ineligibility\n\n2\\. A correction was made on the ARB sum values\n\n3\\. The executable has been simplified to a single tx to avoid any potential execution issues\n\n\n\n# Summary\n\nEvent Horizon is a public good. It is a public-access metagovernance block. With the aim of enfranchising the tens of thousands of small voters, this proposal suggests we delegate (not grant) 7,000,000 ARB to a public access-voter block subject to a non-optimistic 1-year renewal. This delegation gets mobilized by Voter Pass functionally giving underrepresented DAO citizens multiplied voting power and therefore more incentive to express their voices.&#x20;\n\n\n\nThe Gitcoin DAO has recently passed a proposal supporting Event Horizon, thereby making our Citizen Enfranchisement pool the #6 delegate on Gitcoin.&#x20;\n\nWe also request a grant of 200k ARB to help the team maintain this public good across this 1 year experiment in addition to retroactively awarding the team for the fully-functional product thus far built out of pocket for the Arbitrum community over the past several months. In addition, to ensure community alignment, a separate 125K ARB grant will be paid to the 5 member Oversight Committee in monthly installments. Grant Grand Total: 325K ARB.\n\n# Problem\n\nToday, the typical Arbitrum voter participation rate floats in the low single digits. However, there are thousands of individual voters who participate in each vote despite having effectively no meaningful say. They should be rewarded with a voice. Moreover, there are likely tens of thousands more incredibly talented community members who are very capable of adding to the collective cognition of the ecosystem, but simply lack the capital means to have a voice and are left discouraged from voting at all. Voting when you only have, say, $500 worth of ARB doesn’t make sense, it’s a drop in the bucket. Sitting out governance proposals is, unfortunately, the rational decision but collectively makes everyone worse off. The strength of the DAO is directly related to the number of participants having their voices heard by the community. The governance platform and vote multiple that Event Horizon gives to these citizens incentivizes greater participation and surfaces greater cognition from the community.\n\n# Mechanism\n\nArbitrum Citizens interested in governance may mint a free, soul-bound Voter Pass which allows them to take part in mobilizing this voter enfranchisement pool subject to an additional Gitcoin Pass requirement to prevent sybil attacks. As detailed further below, this model:\n\n1. Grants a clear and meaningful voice to statistically low-capital DAO citizen voters regardless of their financial means\n2. Incentivizes participation with additional governance authority, not inflationary rewards\n3. Incentivizes participants interested in governance itself, not financial gain\n\nDAOs today rely exclusively on individuals and company entities to serve as network delegates. However, this isn’t the only option. While individual delegates certainly add incredible value to the Arbitrum Ecosystem, so would a governance allotment dedicated to the greater body of smaller citizen participants.\n\nIn this regard, Event Horizon slots into the Arbitrum ecosystem in a similar fashion to a standard delegate. However, rather than the block voting based on the decision of one individual, it votes with the collective cognition of hundreds of individual voter pass holders.\n\nThis serves two functions:\n\n1. It provides a clear and designated voice for smaller, citizen voters.\n2. It drives participation through a game-theoretic process called Implicit Delegation.\n\nOne of the greatest barriers to participation is a lack of voice due to lack of capital. Implicit delegation and public access governance changes this. Implicit Delegation is a model by which the full public governance block mobilizes in favor of the consensus of those who do vote, thereby implicitly delegating the authority of those who don’t vote to those who do.\n\n**When participation is low…** each voter receives a larger slice of the public access pie. This means the fewer people there are voting, the more incentive there is for someone new to come and participate.\n\n**When participation is high…** there are more voters splitting the same pie, however, citizen participation is high, which is a win for the ecosystem.\n\nImplicit Delegation represents an effort to offer a new paradigm around means of influence. A shift from today’s entirely capital-centric to a more citizen-friendly, participation-centric model.\n\nWhere Direct Governance allocates influence along the lines of capital, and Explicit Delegation allocates influence along the lines of popularity (which often reflects capital), Implicit Delegation allocates influence to those who care most: people showing up to vote. Because the carrot is governance voice itself, implicit delegation attracts governance-interested citizens, not capital-interested citizens; more on that below.\n\nBecause the entirety of the block is always mobilized, those who are most vested are rewarded for their participation by having a larger share of the voting pie. In this regard, Event Horizon’s model leans into a systemic lack of participation to create a solution.\n\n# Rationale\n\n## Delegation rationale\n\n7,000,000 ARB would place the Event Horizon community as around the 15th largest delegate. Based upon significant dialogue with existing Arbitrum delegates and stakeholders, we think this places a fair amount of power into the 3rd pillar of governance, namely citizens (the other two being organizational and individual delegations) without being large enough to flip any typical proposal.\n\nThis proposal reflects two of Arbitrum’s core mission values:\n\n1. Socially Inclusive: By constructing a dedicated block of governance authority with lower capital barriers, our community greatly expands who gets a seat at the table.\n2. Neutral and Open: By making the thoughts and ideas of this broader swath of individuals heard, we further broaden the spectrum of possibilities for the evolution of our ecosystem.\n\n## Grant rationale\n\n1. While we initially didn’t want to ask for compensation, several delegates pointed out that doing this magnitude of work for the DAO for free sets a bad precedent for future builders. It sends the wrong message of “do not build here, your work is not valued by the Arbitrum community”. So despite our initial hesitation, and multiple refusals to do so, we now think it important to ask for some compensation.&#x20;\n2. As for the specific grant amount, LTIPP committees members were paid 25k ARB each for 7.5 weeks of work, approximately $50,000 on proposal execution day (February 21, 2024). We’re asking for 200k ARB total (roughly $100k at today’s ARB prices) for the work already done + 1 year of work from the four members of the Event Horizon team and all associated build costs and ongoing maintenance expenses. This is not to depreciate the value of LTIPP committee members, but to draw a humble comparison of the value of our engineering and governance labor both already done and yet to come in this next year. In fact, this pricing (adjusting for price action between LTIPP and now) explicitly values the work of LTIPP committee members at nearly 19x that of the Event Horizon team ($6.7k per LTIPP committee member per week vs. $480 per EH team member per week), not counting the previous year of work that went into building the already functioning product.\n\nWe will also have to pay for a Snapshot subscription which is $6k / year which will come out of the grant. Further labor expenses can be broken down by categories and priced as follows:\n\n1. Launch pass minting on Arbitrum – 40k ARB\n2. Maintain functionality through any changes in Arbitrums governance process – 40k ARB\n3. Maintain and further streamline voter onboarding UX – 40k ARB\n4. Bi-annual reporting including KPIs such as voters, participation rate, voters above key threshold amounts (say $1k worth of ARB), etc. – 40k ARB\n5. Service fee – 40k ARB &#x20;\n\n# Benefits compared to Token Incentivized Governance:\n\nWhile token rewards for participation hold legitimate merit and are an intuitive remedy for low turnout, it has limitations.\n\n1. Misaligned Incentives: Token-based incentives attract returns-interested parties. However, when it comes to governance, participation is most valuable when it comes from those interested in participating not payout. Implicit delegation directly appeals to these individuals as it rewards those who participate, not with capital, but with greater voting power.\n\n*Added Thought Capital: in line with the notion above, there are likely thousands of community members each holding both strong ideas and valuable contributions for the ecosystem, but simply lack enough voice to justify participation. Through Implicit Delegation, any community member of the Arbitrum ecosystem has an opportunity to have their voice heard, bringing thousands more minds and ideas to the surface.*\n\n1. Inflationary: While token rewards drive participation at the expense of inflation, Implicit delegation simply leverages its game theory model to increase incentive to vote in the form of a greater voting share. This does not cost the token any inflation, nor the treasury any ARB.\n2. Non-scalable: Token-based rewards are finite and require a constant drain of ARB funds to continue driving participation. As the ecosystem scales, and more participants join, greater and greater sums of ARB will be needed to continue fueling growth. Implicit delegation has no cost, and its balanced game theory functions with no burn. As more citizen voters join, more Arb could be delegated to the community block, however, again, this is not a cost as the ARB tokens are still retained by the treasury.\n\n# Specification\n\n\n\n## Past Performance\n\nThe above is not just theory. The Event Horizon community is already active on Ethereum providing metagoverning public goods to Uniswap, AAVE, Compound, ShapeShift, and of course, Arbitrum. In fact, in several recent Uniswap votes, the Event Horizon community was the 10th largest voter in the Uniswap Ecosystem. Event Horizon has also recently voted as the 8th largest delegate in recent Aave votes. Gitcoin DAO just voted to make Event Horizon the 6th largest delegate in the DAO via delegation.&#x20;\n\nWhile there is still quite a gap between Event Horizon and the larger delegates in the larger DAOs, interestingly enough this position serves as a line of demarcation between individual delegates above, and citizens below. This dynamic does, however, highlight a call to action. Raise the long tail a bit, and bring in more voices. Sure, voting isn’t the full picture of DAO decision making, but it’s a great place to start. Individual, organization AND citizen delegations are all valuable and mutually inclusive, three symbiotic pillars for a strong ecosystem.\n\nSince its inception just a few months ago, the Event Horizon protocol has processed nearly 500 metagovernance proposals and placed over $60,000,000 of governance authority and enfranchisement directly into the hands of the citizen voter, a feat not seen anywhere else in the DAO space. This is $60,000,000 of voice amplification for the low-capital, high-conviction citizen which would never have been possible prior to Event Horizon.&#x20;\n\n\n\nSome more metrics worth highlighting:\n\n**Number of Metagovernance Proposals Passed** ~500\n\nOur community members have participated in and passed nearly 500 metagovernance proposals, each corresponding to Arbitrum or other DAO proposals.\n\n**Average Authority Mobilized per Participating Passholder: >$365,000 (and counting)**\n\nFor the cost of $3 in gas, each participating passholder has mobilized an average of just over $100,000 in Uniswap and AAVE authority governance authority across all metagovernance proposals passed.\n\n**Average Authority Mobilized Multiple: >121,500x (and growing)**\n\nThe average pass holder minted their voter pass for ~$3 in gas. When compared to the $365,000 in average authority mobilized, each member has mobilized over 40,000x their gas cost of admission in blue-chip governance authority.\n\n# Oversight Committee\n\nThe Arbitrum Event Horizon Oversight Committee is a consortium of 5 existing, notable delegates and community members who will assist in the facilitation of this public good. Namely, a simple 3/5 majority would allow this committee to veto the decisions of the voter pool in favor of an ‘Abstain’ outcome.\n\n\n\nThe five signers of the Oversight Committee are:\n\n1. Michael (Open Zeppelin) 0xBE1d294FD9B71Ae2F6831Eb80777fF73fb73c953\n2. Frisson (Tally): 0xb5D8fe0De11e6a95F1c2D217C55dc4f010EAc7c1\n3. Jordan (Event Horizon): 0x50c28a42AC91F6E6437A036D320c9242432CCE3F\n4. Juanbug (PGov): 0xB8Dcad009E533066F12e408075E10E3a30F1f15A\n5. DisruptionJoe (Arbitrum Delegate): 0x01Cf9fD2efa5Fdf178bd635c3E2adF25B2052712\n\nThe Oversight Committee members will receive a monthly stipend of 2083 ARB per month so as to maintain an ethos of “your labor is paid” in the Arbitrum ecosystem.&#x20;\n\n\n\n# Implementation\n\n\n\nPer the recommendation of the Arbitrum Foundation, the proposal will forego the Franchiser contract approach in favor of a multi-signature wallet structure. With the passing of this proposal, the DAO will transfer 7.325M ARB to the Oversight Committee multi-signature wallet (0x15C4edF2cF2f36335e42c19E506Ed6cB16a57D8F). The Oversight Committee will then:\n\n\n\n1\\. Send the 325K ARB grant to an Event Horizon SAFE (arb1:0xE67192302E444a8D28F60F6737a8bc7c672b8aC6) prior to delegation. The 200K ARB direct grant will be retained by EH, and the 125K ARB oversight committee payments will be emitted proportionally to all members by EH in monthly bulk txs over the coming 12 months.\n\n2\\. Delegate the remaining 7M ARB to the Arbitrum Community Governance wallet (EventHorizonArbitrum.eth).\n\n\n\nAfter initial delegation, Event Horizon handles all functionality from there. Event Horizon will facilitate and maintain all elements of the pool from pass minting to metagovernance.&#x20;\n\n\n\nShould the DAO wish to recall the delegation, an on-chain vote will no longer be required. Instead, a snapshot proposal will suffice. The Oversight Committee will be beholden to a community Snapshot vote, and will retain the ability to undelegate and return all ARB to the DAO treasury at any point per the request of the DAO.\n\n\n\n*Previous Model for Reference: In order to implement this proposal, it is required that we create a DAO-controlled Franchiser contract. The contract owner would be the DAO timelock and it would allow the DAO the power to delegate and undelegate tokens that it sends from the treasury to the Franchiser. We suggest that the Foundation aids in the creation of this contract in order to create an official and safe implementation, though we can likely fork the Trail of Bits audited Uniswap Labs implementation \\[github] of the same concept. If this proposal passes Snapshot, we request that the Foundation take the time to fork the contract and hire an auditor to check the implementation.*\n\nThe contract has simple functions:\n\n* Fund: allows the DAO to send tokens to contract and delegate to a single address\n* FundMany: allows the DAO to send tokens to contract and delegate any amount to multiple addresses\n* Recall: allows DAO to pull back funds from Franchiser effectively undelegating and returning tokens to treasury from a single delegate.\n* RecallMany: allows DAO to pull back funds from Franchiser effectively undelegating and returning tokens to treasury from multiple delegates.\n* It is worth noting that all tokens sent to the Franchiser will remain a part of the DAO’s balance sheet as it has full-control over the contract. The delegated tokens never leave the DAO’s ownership.\n\nForking and auditing this franchiser contract would be useful for Arbitrum’s version of retroactive delegation (updated version to be posted shortly). Crucially, we view both this proposal (delegating to EH’s citizen enfranchisement pool) and the above retroactive delegation proposal (boosting active delegates in the 10k-1m ARB range) as two sides of the same coin of the community’s call for creative ways to boost citizen participation and governance decision making processes.\n\n# Additional Considerations\n\nSybil Considerations: it is important to note that the delegated ARB is by a large margin a minority voter amount. Any potential risk of Sybil influence over the public-access block would under almost all conditions not amount to a sum of authority that would be capable of passing a vote absent incredibly significant broader support from other delegates and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem participants. E.g. a rogue vote is virtually impossible.\n\nThat being said, Event Horizon will be implementing Gitcoin Passport requirements for Arbitrum metagovernance.&#x20;",

      "title": "Fund the Stylus Sprint",
      "content": "Please find the full proposal on the forums, several sections have been removed to adhere to character limits: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-fund-the-stylus-sprint/26437?u=entropy\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe [ArbOS 31 “Bianca”](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/108288822474129076868455956066667369439381709547570289793612729242368710728616) onchain vote on Tally has passed quorum, signaling the DAO’s approval to activate Arbitrum Stylus on Arbitrum One and Nova. To bolster the impact of this upgrade, this proposal presents the one-time \"Stylus Sprint\" program, aimed at encouraging the early development of Stylus smart contracts and tooling by awarding up to 5,000,000 ARB to teams who build with Stylus. Applications will be open for 8 weeks and the program will run for 1 year. The Sprint will include a mix of open applications where teams are encouraged to be creative in their ideas as well as invitational/RFQs with strategically targeted objectives. The requested funding is intended to cover development costs, including hiring talent, training teams, adopting new tools, infrastructure expenses, and audits at the discretion of the recipient. This campaign's primary objectives are to engage new and existing Arbitrum protocol teams with this novel technology, showcase use cases only feasible with Stylus, and create foundational Stylus building blocks for widespread use.\n\nInterested teams must apply through a designated application process and grant recipients will be selected by an Evaluation Committee based on specific criteria detailed in this proposal. As the program progresses, participating teams will receive staged funding as they reach predefined and agreed-upon milestones, culminating in the deployment and long-term upkeep of their projects.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Application Process & RFP Details:\n\nAs mentioned, the Stylus Sprint program invites teams to submit applications either in the open-applications track or in response to lightweight Request for Proposals (RFPs, listed below) that target specific verticals, published by the Evaluation Committee. The below lists are non-exhaustive and serve as inspiration. Participants in the open track will have ample opportunity for innovation and creativity. All requests for both the open-application track and RFPs must be denominated in ARB.\n\nThe application approach described above for both open applications and RFPs ensures a structured yet flexible framework for harnessing the potential of Stylus technology. Not all funds will necessarily be deployed, and even if an RFP has quotes, there is no guarantee that any will be deemed satisfactory and chosen. The above categories are non-exhaustive and meant to be viewed as examples. If this proposal passes, the Evaluation Committee will cement an official list before applications open.\n\nTeams are required to submit a detailed application outlining their plans for utilizing the funding. These applications will be thoroughly reviewed by the Evaluation Committee, which will also approve them. Upon approval, milestone payments will be systematically allocated to the teams based on their progress. If no satisfactory applications are received, as decided at the discretion of the Evaluation Committee, 0 ARB will be spent, and all unspent funds will be returned to DAO.\n\n### Evaluation Committee and Committee Advisors\n\nTo effectively administer the program, it is essential to establish an Evaluation Committee composed of Stylus experts. Additionally, a group of advisors will provide consultative support to the committee. Given the innovative nature and specific technical nuances of Stylus, we propose that the committee be primarily made up of members from Offchain Labs and OpenZeppelin, the two entities responsible for developing Stylus thus far. Currently, there are limited experts qualified to assess Stylus applications effectively. However, should the DAO prefer to engage in a broader selection process that we believe would be inefficient and lead to a less successful program, Entropy Advisors is more than happy to facilitate an RFP process instead, contingent upon a DAO vote to define and appoint these roles.\n\nEvaluation Committee\n\n1. Stylus Team Members - Offchain Labs (Waiving Payment)\n2. Dev Team - Arbitrum Foundation (Waiving Payment)\n3. Entropy Advisors (Waiving Payment)\n4. Michael Lewellen - OpenZeppelin (5000 ARB per month)\n5. Gustavo Gonzalez - OpenZeppelin (5000 ARB per month)\n\nCommittee Advisors\n\n1. Entropy Advisors (Waiving Payment)\n\nThe Committee Advisors’ main role will be facilitating discourse with the DAO, applicants, and general project management in order to reduce the burden on the Evaluation Committee where possible. **Members of the Evaluation Committee and Committee Advisors will not be eligible to apply to the program in any capacity due to conflicts of interest.**\n\nJudges and Advisors will serve for approximately 14.5 months. In the first 2 weeks, they will work together to refine the application and evaluation criteria as well as specifics around the RFPs to kickstart the process. The following 2 months will be used to review proposals as they come in. Subsequent 2 weeks will be taken to officially accept and reject projects. **Both accepted and rejected applications will receive public rationale from the Evaluation Committee as to why the choice was made so that the DAO may have a view into the decisions and the teams can adjust accordingly in the future.** In the next 12 months, contributors will greenlight milestone payments as projects achieve their goals and periodically give guidance to participants. Advisors will report back to the DAO through monthly updates over the lifespan of the program.\n\n### Multisig Setup\n\nThe Stylus Sprint multi-sig will be created and allocated 5M ARB for the Stylus Sprint Program and 150K ARB for payments to judges. Funds will be sent to an MSS-secured multisig. The funds in the multisig belong to the DAO and the signers act as grant managers on behalf of the DAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in DAO governance, including delegation.\n\n### Funding Levels and Disbursement\n\nTeams will apply for their appropriate levels of funding. Suggested levels in ARB are 1M, 750K, 500K, 250K, 100K, or 50K. If teams want a different amount of funding, they must specify why in their application. These funding levels have been set to streamline the review process. However, teams are encouraged to request specific amounts of funding best suited to their needs. Teams will have 1 year to deploy their project and meet their 2 post-deployment milestones.\n\nUnallocated funds will be returned to the DAO treasury after all applications have been reviewed and grant sizes have been determined. An additional dispersal to the DAO could occur if projects don’t manage to hit their goals within the 1-year timeline and if the budget has remaining ARB. There is absolutely no need to allocate all funds, and it will only be done if more than 5M in exemplary proposals are received during the 8-week application cycle.\n\nFunding will be distributed based on achieving certain development milestones. 50% of funds will be distributed after deployment to encourage teams to think about growth and sustainability post-launch. The criteria for these 2 checkpoints will be proposed by teams in their applications.\n\nAll projects will be required to use milestones in order to ensure progress is being made before funds are fully allocated. The above milestone structure, however, is not required. For RFPs, custom milestone payments can be included in the quotes provided by service providers. Approved projects will submit requests as they reach milestones. The judges, with help from their advisors, will be responsible for ensuring validity and greenlighting payment to be sent as milestones are hit, in accordance with the Evaluation Criteria mentioned above. The evaluation committee will have the autonomy and authority to expel projects from the program at any point in their life cycle and stop all future milestone payments.\n\n## Timeline\n\n1. Stylus Sprint Forum Post - August 20, 2024\n2. Snapshot Vote Begins - August 29, 2024\n3. On-Chain Vote - Sept 12, 2024\n6. Stylus Sprint Begins - Oct 4, 2024\n\nThe program will begin on the Monday following the onchain proposal’s passing. The first 2 weeks will be used to refine and post the RFPs, followed by open applications for 8 weeks, then a 2-week application review process. Feedback between the Evaluation Committee and applicants will be conducted on an ongoing/continuous basis over the next 10 weeks. KYC with the foundation will then begin and first milestone payments may be allocated upon completion. The MSS chairs, Arbitrum Foundation, and Entropy Advisors will need to work closely to ensure a strict payment process.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\n**5,180,000 ARB**\n\nUp to 5M to be awarded to projects building on Stylus\n\n75,000 ARB payment in total over 14.5 months per committee member for 2 committee members = 150,000 ARB\n\n30,000 ARB paid up front to Questbook.",

      "title": "Synthetix LTIP Grant Extension Request",
      "content": "# Abstract\nSynthetix requests an 8-week extension for its LTIP grant to align with the launch of Perps Multi-Collateral and distribute 900k ARB in trading fee rebates. This extension will run from September 16th to November 16th, 2024 (edit: with Snapshot ending dates) aligning the deployment of the remaining grant funds with a major product launch.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Arbitrum community should implement this extension to maximize the impact of the originally approved grant, which targeted LP & stablecoin incentives. By aligning the distribution with the launch of our Arbitrum-exclusive Multi-Collateral Perps feature, we can ensure greater engagement, trading volume, and overall ecosystem growth.\n\n# Rationale\n\nSynthetix has experienced unforeseen delays in its deployment of Synthetix Perps on Arbitrum. We originally expected to launch by late July, to align with one month of Perps fee rebates. However, due to audits and other factors, and to ensure the top performance of our Arbitrum-exclusive multi-collateral perps feature, we’ve been unable to hit these targets. As a result, we’ve not utilized 900k ARB from our proposal and would like to seek an extension.\n\n# Key Terms\n\n* Multi-Collateral Perps : A feature allowing users to margin with ETH, BTC, and USDx for perpetual futures trading on Arbitrum with Synthetix Perps.\n\n# Specifications\n\nThe extension will utilize the remaining 900k ARB tokens from our original proposal for trading fee rebates. These rebates will be distributed over 8 weeks, coinciding with the launch of Multi-Collateral Perps. This approach ensures:\n\n1. Full implementation of the Multi-Collateral Perps feature\n2. Complete integration with frontend partners, particularly Kwenta as our launch partner\n3. Enhanced capital efficiency with multiple margin options, new trading \nstrategies, trading types, etc.\n4. Improved user experience and market competitiveness as an Arbitrum exclusive launch\n\n# Steps to Implement\n1. Launch Multi-Collateral Perps feature on Arbitrum (this week)\n2. Begin distribution of trading fee rebates\n3. Monitor and report on the impact of the rebates and new feature\n\n# Timeline\n* Start Date: September 16th\n* End Date: November 16th\n* Total 8 week program from starting date. (Original TBD dates have been edited based on Snapshot timing)\n\n# Overall Cost\n\nThe extension utilizes the remaining 900,000 ARB tokens from the originally approved 2 million ARB grant. Over the 8-week period, this amount will be fully distributed as trading fee rebates as per our original LTIP grant.\n\n* Total Cost: 900,000 ARB tokens\n* Weekly Distribution: 112,500 ARB tokens (900,000 / 8 weeks)\n\nNo additional funds are being requested beyond the original grant allocation.\n\n# Additional Context\n\nWe have been working with the LTIP Council, @Matt_StableLab, and others to work out the best path to request this extension, and we started requesting information & guidance on July 21st.\n\nWe’ve also posted about our proposed plans in our original LTIP [thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/synthetix-ltipp-application-final/22023) which included options on how to best proceed.\n\nWe plan to post this on Snapshot, not Tally, next week with the help of @krst, as it does not utilize any additional funds. Any additional comments before this time would be very helpful. Thank you all!",

      "title": "Enhancing Multichain Governance: Upgrading RARI Governance Token on Arbitrum",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThe RARI DAO seeks to enhance its governance framework by upgrading the RARI token contract and bringing its governance from Ethereum mainnet to the Arbitrum ecosystem. This proposal requests a custom gateway for a new RARI L2 token contract via Arbitrum native bridge, as only the Arbitrum DAO can implement this change. The custom gateway will enable more efficient governance processes for while reducing user costs and improving overall accessibility for RARI DAO. The proposal asks to register the custom L2 token to a custom gateway on the Arbitrum native bridge.\n\n## Motivation\n\nRARI DAO is governed by the $RARI token, which when locked in veRARI grants voting access. The current token contract is on Ethereum mainnet and is not upgradable. The RARI DAO wishes to upgrade its governance, a part of which is a token contract upgrade with snapshots and delegations embedded. Only the Arbitrum DAO can however set up the mapping of L1 -> L2 token addresses in the custom gateway (which is controlled by Arbitrum DAO)  on the Arbitrum native bridge. Here is more information about the topic: https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/token-bridge-erc20#setting-up-your-token-with-the-generic-custom-gateway\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe RARI DAO multichain governance upgrade is designed to make governance more accessible by simplifying the UX, reducing gas fees, and enabling new token functions. This aligns with Artbitrum's commitment to user-centricity and technical inclusivity.\n\nWith a custom L2 token implementation we will be able to perform the RARI DAO governance upgrade and move our governance fully into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nMore on RARI DAO's plan for governance upgrade can be found HERE.\n\n## Key Terms\n\nRARI token: RARI DAO governance token (https://etherscan.io/token/0xfca59cd816ab1ead66534d82bc21e7515ce441cf\n\nRARI DAO: body governing the Rarible Protocol and RARI chain\n\nCustom L2 RARI token: upgraded and simplified RARI token to be used in RARI DAO multichain governance moving forward\n\n## Specifications\n\nRARI token in question (https://etherscan.io/token/0xfca59cd816ab1ead66534d82bc21e7515ce441cf) does not have upgradability nor allows the owner to register in the Arbitrum token bridge router.\n\nAs such, we're requesting a custom L2 token implementation and using the (standard) custom gateway. Lacking the ability to upgrade / owner-register, we are seeking Artbirum DAO's approval to register the upgraded RARI token to the custom gateway so we can proceed with the custom L2 implementation.\n\nThe upgraded token contract was fully audited and can be found here: [https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/pull/305](https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/pull/305).\n\nToken contract was deployed to Arbitrum Sepolia, RARI testnet (which is on top of Arbitrum Sepolia) and all contracts were tested manually as well.\n\nRARI DAO voted in favor of the upgraded token: https://www.tally.xyz/gov/rari-foundation/proposal/85102068202527969889208024703113668965813715410446115075088330064807449302588\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n1. Deploy token contracts on Arbitrum and RARI chains (done)\n2. Security audit of the proposed code change (in progress by Arbitrum Foundation)\n3. Onchain vote to change mapping for L1 → L2 tokens on bridge router and custom gateway (This can be done only by Arbitrum DAO)\n\n## Timeline\n\nImplementation upon the proposal's execution (aiming late September).\n\n## Overall costs\n\nN/A",

      "title": "[Pyth Network] Arbitrum LTIPP Extension Request",
      "content": "# Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks a 12 weeks extension (until November 30\\) of the Pyth Network’s [previously approved LTIPP grant](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-ltipp-application-draft/22003).\n\nInitially, the Pyth Network was allocated 1,000,000 ARB through the LTIPP process. To date, we have utilized approximately 75,042 ARB over the 12-week duration of the program.\n\nWe are requesting to retain 174,958 ARB, bringing our total expenditure to 250,000 ARB out of the original 1,000,000, until the new grant programs are established.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWe want to highlight that incentives for infrastructure protocols and public goods, such as the Pyth oracle, typically do not yield immediate results. The impact from making such incentives available to DeFi often unfolds over weeks or even months.\n\nFor existing DeFi applications, switching to a new oracle involves significant effort and may require a new audit. Similarly, expanding from other chains to Arbitrum can be more time-consuming than anticipated, as illustrated by the Synthetix case [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/synthetix-ltipp-application-final/22023/20).\n\nThanks to the initial LTIPP program, Arbitrum dApps had the ability to build robust oracle systems covering over 500 assets, including cryptocurrencies, FX, stocks, ETFs, and commodities. This advancement has eliminated outdated on-chain price updates and high costs, reinforcing Arbitrum’s position as a premier layer for DeFi. This progress empowers developers to create cutting-edge applications without constraints. This extension aims to keep the momentum and further empower potential new entrants like Synthetix to deliver a best-in-class protocol.\n\n# Rationale\n\nThe proposed extension of the Pyth Network’s LTIPP grant is designed to further cultivate a thriving and innovative DeFi ecosystem on Arbitrum. The LTIPP program has already proven its effectiveness, with Pyth price updates on-chain increasing by 2-3 times and peaking at nearly 10 times the previous levels, reaching over 70,000 updates on July 14\\.\n\nBefore the program began, the total value secured by the Pyth oracle on Arbitrum was just over 43,000 ETH. This figure has since risen to 52,500 ETH, reflecting an increase of more than 20%.\n\nPyth has also enabled over $16.1 billion in trading volume on various Arbitrum decentralized perpetual exchanges during June and July (with August data pending). This underscores the benefits for applications powered by Pyth Network: protocols using Pyth have experienced, including increased total value locked (TVL), higher trading volumes, and more frequent price updates driven by a growing number of applications utilizing Pyth.\n\nThe request for a 12-week extension, with a reduced ARB allocation, is part of our commitment towards responsible resource management commitment to responsible resource management while continuing to support the long-term success of applications built on Arbitrum that leverage Pyth. By covering the gas costs for using the Pyth oracle, the network has enabled more developers to create robust DeFi applications without the burden of high operational expenses.\n\nThis strategy strengthens Arbitrum’s position as a premier platform for DeFi innovation, where developers can access over 500 price feeds without financial or technical constraints.\n\nIt’s important to understand that the impact of incentives for infastructure protocols and public goods like the Pyth price oracle are not immediate: it often takes weeks or even months to materialize.\n\nFurthermore, it’s important to recognize that the impact of incentives for infrastructure protocols and public goods like the Pyth oracle is not immediate; it often takes weeks or even months to materialize.\n\nThis proposal, aims to build on the momentum generated by the initial LTIPP program, ensuring the continued growth and expansion of the Arbitrum ecosystem as new grant strategies are developed and implemented.\n\n# Key Terms\n\n* On-demand or pull oracle: An oracle network where anyone can permissionlessly trigger price updates on-chain by doing an Arbitrum tx\n\n# Specifications\n\n* 13 weeks duration  \n* 175,000 ARB\n\nThe proposed extension duration is similar to that of the previous LTIPP program—12 weeks versus 13 weeks (including retroactive rebates for the end of August). However, the amount of ARB tokens requested for gas rebates has increased from 75,000 ARB to 175,000 ARB.\n\nThis increase reflects an anticipated rise in activity and associated costs, estimated at approximately 133%. The launch of Synthetix’s Multi-Collateral Perps on Arbitrum is expected to drive a substantial increase in the number of price updates triggered on-chain. For context, Synthetix currently triggers around 1,000 daily updates on Optimism and between 3,000 and 5,000 daily updates on Base—both without additional incentives in place.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nIf the Arbitrum DAO approves this extension, no additional work or involvement will be required from the DAO itself. The responsibility for managing the funds and continuing the program would remain entirely with the Pyth Data Association.\n\nAs during the initial 12 weeks of the LTIPP, the Pyth Data Association would continue reimbursing dApps for gas costs every two weeks. Additionally, we would maintain our practice of providing bi-weekly updates on the Arbitrum forum to ensure transparency and accountability. Our latest report is available [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-bi-weekly-update-26-august-2024/26525), and we are open to including even more detailed data and information in these reports if needed.\n\nSince this is an extension of an already approved grant, no additional legal work is necessary. The Pyth Data Association has already completed KYC and signed the grant agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n# Timeline\n\nThe LTIPP program officially ended on August 26, and until this extension proposal is approved, the Pyth Data Association has paused reimbursing the gas costs incurred by dApps during this period.\n\nIf approved, the extension would be applied retroactively, starting from the end of the LTIPP program on August 26. This means that, depending on the timing of the Snapshot vote, there could be up to 2-3 weeks of retroactive gas rebates.\n\nThe proposed extension would conclude on November 30, 2024.\n\n# Overall Cost\n\nThe cost to the Arbitrum DAO can be seen as an opportunity cost of 174,958 ARB, or potentially even less. Originally, the DAO approved a grant of 1,000,000 ARB—funds that were effectively budgeted and allocated—of which only 75,042 ARB was utilized during the 12-week LTIPP period.\n\nWe are now requesting to retain 174,958 ARB from the initial allocation to continue offsetting costs for DeFi applications that use Pyth’s on-demand price feeds. The remaining 750,000 ARB will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO as previously agreed under the LTIPP program. Furthermore, if any funds remain unspent before the outlined timeline concludes, Pyth Data Association will promptly return those ARB tokens to the DAO.\n\n# Additional Context\n\nWe have been actively seeking feedback and advice from [@Matt_StableLab](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/matt_stablelab) to determine the best approach for moving forward with this extension request.\n\nOur interest in extending the LTIPP grant was initiated in the original LTIPP discussion [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-ltipp-application-draft/22003/10).\n\nCurrently, we plan to submit this extension request on Snapshot by Thursday, September 5, with support from Wintermute. This timeline allows ample opportunity to gather feedback on the proposal and make any necessary adjustments based on input from the DAO.\n\nPlease note that Wintermute will merely be sponsoring the proposal as a delegate which is separate from their role as an LTIPP Council member.",

      "title": "ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee Phase II",
      "content": "The Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (ADPC), composed of Axis Advisory, Areta, and Daimon Legal, is proposing to extend its term for an additional 6 months. The initial phase, which ends on August 20, 2024, was a proof of concept that established a comprehensive procurement process to support Arbitrum DAO's decentralized governance structure. This second phase, starting upon the successful on-chain vote, aims to build on the successes and lessons learned from the pilot phase, with a focus on delivering strategic procurement benefits for the DAO.\n\n## Key Achievements in Phase I:\nDuring its first phase, the ADPC successfully implemented procurement frameworks and marketplaces uniquely tailored for Arbitrum DAO, creating a foundation for cost savings and operational efficiency. Through the development of a solid legal and operational infrastructure, the committee has positioned Arbitrum DAO as a leader not just in the technical sphere but also in decentralized governance. The pilot phase showcased the benefits of using advanced sourcing methodologies and well-structured procurement to enhance the DAO’s operations.\n_______________________\n## Plans for Phase II:\n\n### 1. Procurement for Two Key Vertical Sectors:\n\n**Vertical 1:** Focused on procuring RPC (Remote Procedure Call) providers for projects building in the Arbitrum ecosystem. This decision is based on thorough engagement with DAO delegates and stakeholders, identifying RPC services as a core requirement for projects in the ecosystem.\n\n**Vertical 2:** Aims to manage procurement for events scheduled within the DAO's Events Strategy for 2025. The ADPC will work in collaboration with Entropy Advisors and Disruption Joe, though no separate funding will be requested for event services in this proposal. The ADPC will create evaluation criteria, publish a request for proposals (RFP), and evaluate responses from potential suppliers. However, contract negotiations will not be handled by the ADPC, as they will fall under the purview of the Arbitrum Foundation or other third parties involved.\n\n### 2. Continued Management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Services:\nBuilding on the success of the initial cohort, the ADPC will continue overseeing the security services fund and will publish a proposal for its extension.\n\n### 3. Operational Expense (OpEx) Budget Creation:\nThe ADPC will define and propose an OpEx budget for the Arbitrum DAO, which will be managed by the Multi-Signature Safe (MSS). This will allow the DAO to use services from whitelisted providers without needing to undergo the full proposal process (Forum, Snapshot, On-Chain). The proposal will include multiple budget options for the community to vote on, allowing flexibility in how the budget is allocated.\n\n### 4. Phase II Outcome Report:\nUpon completion of the second phase, the ADPC will publish a detailed report outlining the results and key achievements, similar to the one produced for Phase I. This report will be submitted to the DAO for review.\n\n### 5. Alignment with DAO Stakeholders:\nThe ADPC will continue to engage with key stakeholders within the DAO to ensure that it remains aligned with the evolving governance structure of Arbitrum, particularly as the DAO explores potential changes like establishing an operating company (OpCo). The ADPC will also handle ad-hoc tasks, such as connecting whitelisted service providers with new projects or proposals within the DAO.\n\n### 6. Optional Additional Vertical Sectors:\nUpon successful completion of the work packages outlined above, the ADPC may take on up to two additional verticals based on DAO demand and the committee’s capacity. This work would require approval through the DAO’s governance process and would be contingent on the ADPC’s term being extended if necessary.\n_______________________\n## Budget for Phase II:\nThe total budget for this 6-month period is $414,000. This amount includes operational expenses and will be disbursed in six monthly installments. The funding request will (based on prices at the time of posting and subject to change) total 915,658 ARB, calculated based on the average ARB price at $0.5425/ARB. A buffer is included to protect against ARB price depreciation, ensuring that the ADPC can meet its financial obligations. The funds will be OTC’d to USDC. Any unutilized ARB will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO treasury at the end of the term.\n_______________________\n## Additional Information:\nThe proposal also includes the re-election of the current ADPC members (Axis Advisory, Areta, and Daimon Legal) to continue their roles in Phase II. This is intended to provide continuity and ensure that the progress made in Phase I can be built upon without interruption.\n\nThe committee believes that by extending its tenure, it can continue to deliver significant value to the Arbitrum ecosystem by optimizing procurement processes, securing vital services, and enabling a smoother governance structure for the DAO. Ultimately, the ADPC’s work in Phase II will help position Arbitrum DAO for long-term success, both in terms of operational efficiency and decentralized governance practices.",

      "title": "Delegate to Voter Enfranchisement Pool — Event Horizon",
      "content": "# **Summary**\n\nEvent Horizon is a public good. It is a public-access metagovernance block. With the aim of enfranchising the tens of thousands of small voters, this proposal suggests we delegate (not grant) 7,000,000 ARB to a public access-voter block subject to a non-optimistic 1 year renewal. This delegation gets mobilized by Voter Pass and Gitcoin Pass holders functionally giving underrepresented DAO citizens multiplied voting power and therefore more incentive to express their voices. The Gitcoin DAO has [<u>recently passed</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0xb2094445891a515a6c58d8b44c4c2428e66d2e5f1f1e81a2741036eb97e6d6e8) a proposal supporting Event Horizon, thereby making our Citizen Enfranchisement pool the #6 delegate on Gitcoin. \n\nWe also request a grant of 200k ARB to help the team maintain this public good across this 1 year experiment in addition to retroactively awarding the team for the fully-functional product thus far built out of pocket for the Arbitrum community over the past several months. Further, to ensure community alignment, a 5 member Oversight Committee will be paid a 125k ARB stipend broken up into monthly payments.&#x20;\n\n# **Problem**\n\nToday, typical Arbitrum voter participation rate floats in the low single digits. However, there are thousands of individual voters who participate in each vote despite having effectively no meaningful say. They should be rewarded with a voice. Moreover, there are likely tens of thousands more incredibly talented community members who are very capable of adding to the collective cognition of the ecosystem, but simply lack the capital means to have a voice and are left discouraged from voting at all. Not voting when you only have, say, $500 worth of ARB doesn’t make sense, it’s a drop in the bucket. Sitting out governance proposals is, unfortunately, the rational decision but collectively makes everyone worse off. The strength of the DAO is directly related to the number of participants having their voices heard by the community. The governance platform and vote multiple that Event Horizon gives to these citizens incentivizes greater participation: our average participation rate is 30%.\n\n# **Mechanism**\n\nArbitrum Citizens interested in governance may mint a free, soul-bound Voter Pass which allows them to take part in mobilizing this voter enfranchisement pool subject to an additional Gitcoin Pass requirement to prevent sybil attacks. As detailed further below, this model:\n\n1. Grants a clear and meaningful voice to statistically low capital DAO citizen voters regardless of their financial means\n2. Incentivizes participation with additional governance authority, not inflationary rewards\n3. Incentivizes participants interested in governance itself, not financial gain\n\nDAOs today rely exclusively on individuals and company entities to serve as network delegates. However, this isn’t the only option. While individual delegates certainly add incredible value to the Arbitrum Ecosystem, so would a governance allotment dedicated to the greater body of smaller citizen participants.\n\nIn this regard, Event Horizon slots into the Arbitrum ecosystem in a similar fashion to a standard delegate. However, rather than the block voting based on the decision of one individual, it votes with the collective cognition of hundreds of individual voter pass holders.\n\nThis serves two functions:\n\n1. It provides a clear and designated voice for smaller, citizen voters.\n2. It drives participation through a game-theoretic process called Implicit Delegation.\n\nOne of the greatest barriers to participation is a lack of voice due to lack of capital. Implicit delegation and public access governance changes this. Implicit Delegation is a model by which the full public governance block mobilizes in favor of the consensus of those who *do vote*, thereby implicitly delegating the authority of those who *don’t vote* to those who do.\n\n**When participation is low…** each voter receives a larger slice of the public access pie. This means the fewer people there are voting, the more incentive there is for someone new to come and participate.\n\n**When participation is high…** there are more voters splitting the same pie, however, citizen participation is high, which is a win for the ecosystem.\n\nImplicit Delegation represents an effort to offer a new paradigm around means of influence. A shift from today’s entirely capital-centric to a more citizen-friendly, participation-centric model.\n\nWhere Direct Governance allocates influence along the lines of capital, and Explicit Delegation allocates influence along the lines of popularity (which often reflects capital), Implicit Delegation allocates influence to those who care most: people showing up to vote. Because the carrot is governance voice itself, implicit delegation attracts governance-interested citizens, not capital-interested citizens; more on that below.\n\nBecause the entirety of the block is always mobilized, those who are most vested are rewarded for their participation by having a larger share of the voting pie. In this regard, Event Horizon’s model leans into a systemic lack of participation to create a solution.\n\n# **Rationale**\n\n**Delegation rationale**\n\n7,000,000 ARB would place the Event Horizon community as around the 15th largest delegate. Based upon significant dialogue with existing Arbitrum delegates and stakeholders, we think this places a fair amount of power into the 3rd pillar of governance, namely citizens (the other two being organizational and individual delegations) without being large enough to flip any typical proposal.\n\nThis proposal reflects two of Arbitrum’s core mission values:\n\n1. Socially Inclusive: By constructing a dedicated block of governance authority with lower capital barriers, our community greatly expands who gets a seat at the table.\n2. Neutral and Open: By making the thoughts and ideas of this broader swath of individuals heard, we further broaden the spectrum of possibilities for the evolution of our ecosystem.\n\n**Grant rationale**\n\n1. While we initially didn’t want to ask for compensation, several delegates pointed out that doing this magnitude of work for the DAO for free sets a bad precedent for future builders. It sends the wrong message of “do not build here, your work is not valued by the Arbitrum community”. So despite our initial hesitation, and multiple refusals to do so, we now think it important to ask for some compensation. \n2. As for the specific grant amount, LTIPP committees members [<u>were paid 25k ARB each</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/110767177349707239820875764565747830009768307680609166467172874966002003291288) for 7.5 weeks of work, approximately $50,000 on proposal execution day (February 21, 2024). We’re asking for 200k ARB total (roughly $100k at today’s ARB prices) for the work already done + 1 year of work from the four members of the Event Horizon team and all associated build costs and ongoing maintenance expenses. This is not to depreciate the value of LTIPP committee members, but to draw a humble comparison of the value of our engineering and governance labor both already done and yet to come in this next year. In fact, this pricing (adjusting for price action between LTIPP and now) explicitly values the work of LTIPP committee members at nearly 19x that of the Event Horizon team ($6.7k per LTIPP committee member per week vs. $480 per EH team member per week), not counting the previous year of work that went into building the already functioning product.\n\nWe will also have to pay for a Snapshot subscription which is $6k / year which will come out of the grant. Further labor expenses can be broken down by categories and priced as follows:\n\n1. Launch pass minting on Arbitrum – 40k ARB\n2. Maintain functionality through any changes in Arbitrums governance process – 40k ARB\n3. Maintain and further streamline voter onboarding UX – 40k ARB\n4. Bi-annual reporting including KPIs such as voters, participation rate, voters above key threshold amounts (say $1k worth of ARB), etc. – 40k ARB\n5. Service fee – 40k ARB &#x20;\n\n# **Benefits compared to Token Incentivized Governance:**\n\nWhile token rewards for participation hold legitimate merit and are an intuitive remedy for low turnout, it has limitations.\n\n1. Misaligned Incentives: Token-based incentives attract returns-interested parties. However, when it comes to governance, participation is most valuable when it comes from those interested in participating not payout. Implicit delegation directly appeals to these individuals as it rewards those who participate, not with capital, but with greater voting power.\n\n*Added Thought Capital: in line with the notion above, there are likely thousands of community members each holding both strong ideas and valuable contributions for the ecosystem, but simply lack enough voice to justify participation. Through Implicit Delegation, any community member of the Arbitrum ecosystem has an opportunity to have their voice heard, bringing thousands more minds and ideas to the surface.*\n\n1. Inflationary: While token rewards drive participation at the expense of inflation, Implicit delegation simply leverages its game theory model to increase incentive to vote in the form of a greater voting share. This does not cost the token any inflation, nor the treasury any ARB.\n2. Non-scalable: Token-based rewards are finite and require a constant drain of ARB funds to continue driving participation. As the ecosystem scales, and more participants join, greater and greater sums of ARB will be needed to continue fueling growth. Implicit delegation has no cost, and its balanced game theory functions with no burn. As more citizen voters join, more Arb could be delegated to the community block, however, again, this is not a cost as the ARB tokens are still retained by the treasury.\n\n# **Specification**\n\n**Past Performance**\n\nThe above is not just theory. The Event Horizon community is already active on Ethereum providing metagoverning public goods to Uniswap, AAVE, Compound, ShapeShift, and of course, Arbitrum. In fact, in several recent Uniswap votes, the Event Horizon community was the 10th largest voter in the Uniswap Ecosystem. Event Horizon has also recently voted as the 8th largest delegate in recent Aave votes. Gitcoin DAO [<u>just voted</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0xb2094445891a515a6c58d8b44c4c2428e66d2e5f1f1e81a2741036eb97e6d6e8) to make Event Horizon the 6th largest delegate in the DAO via delegation. \n\nWhile there is still quite a gap between Event Horizon and the larger delegates in the larger DAOs, interestingly enough this position serves as a line of demarcation between individual delegates above, and citizens below. This dynamic does, however, highlight a call to action. Raise the long tail a bit, and bring in more voices. Sure, voting isn’t the full picture of DAO decision making, but it’s a great place to start. Individual, organization AND citizen delegations are all valuable and mutually *inclusive*, three symbiotic pillars for a strong ecosystem.\n\nSince its inception just a few months ago, the Event Horizon protocol has processed nearly 500 metagovernance proposals and placed over $55,000,000 of governance authority and enfranchisement directly into the hands of the citizen voter, a feat not seen anywhere else in the DAO space. This is $55,000,000 of voice amplification for the low-capital, high-conviction citizen which would never have been possible prior to the Event Horizon's product. Across all proposals for which the Event Horizon Community has participated, the community’s cumulative voter footprint is on pace to exceed $55,000,000. Some more metrics worth highlighting:\n\n**Number of Metagovernance Proposals Passed ~500**Our community members have participated in and passed nearly 500 metagovernance proposals, each corresponding to Arbitrum or other DAO proposals.\n\n**Voter Participation: >30%**Over thirty percent of our community members have participated in our metagovernance proposals. Some participants have voted as many as 63 times in under 5 months. Check out the latest info on our leaderboard: EventHorizon.vote/leaderboard\n\n**Average Authority Mobilized per Participating Passholder: >$365,000 (and counting)**For the cost of $3 in gas, each participating passholder has mobilized an average of just over $100,000 in Uniswap and AAVE authority governance authority across all metagovernance proposals passed.\n\n**Average Authority Mobilized Multiple: >121,500x (and growing)**The average pass holder minted their voter pass for ~$3 in gas. When compared to the $365,000 in average authority mobilized, each member has mobilized over 40,000x their gas cost of admission in blue-chip governance authority\n\n# **Steps to Implementation**\n\nPer the recommended process of the Arbitrum Foundation, the DAO moves 7.2m ARB to the Oversight Committee multi-signature wallet (0x15C4edF2cF2f36335e42c19E506Ed6cB16a57D8F) which will then delegate to the Arbitrum Community Governance wallet.\n\nThe EventHorizonArbitrum.eth wallet automatically votes in support of the passholder consensus while the Oversight Committee can force an Abstain vote with a ⅗ vote to do so. The five signers are:\n\n1. Michael (Open Zeppelin) 0xBE1d294FD9B71Ae2F6831Eb80777fF73fb73c953\n2. Frisson (Tally): 0xb5D8fe0De11e6a95F1c2D217C55dc4f010EAc7c1\n3. Jordan (Event Horizon): 0x50c28a42AC91F6E6437A036D320c9242432CCE3F\n4. Juanbug (PGov): 0xB8Dcad009E533066F12e408075E10E3a30F1f15A\n5. DisruptionJoe (Arbitrum Delegate): 0x01Cf9fD2efa5Fdf178bd635c3E2adF25B2052712\n\nThe Oversight Committee members will also receive a monthly stipend of 2083 ARB per month so as to maintain an ethos of “your labor is paid” in the Arbitrum ecosystem. \n\nAfter initial delegation from the DAO Event Horizon handles everything from there. Event Horizon will facilitate and maintain all elements of the pool from pass minting to metagovernance. \n\nAgain, this delegation would not be a grant and funds would remain in the DAO-controlled wallet. Consider us a delegate + service provider like any of the other talented delegates and service providers currently supporting the Arbitrum ecosystem.The 200K grant distributions are to be sent to an Event Horizon safe with the 75K ARB direct grant to be retained and the 125K ARB oversight committee payments being emitted to all members by EH in monthly bulk txs.\n\n# **Technical Implementation**\n\nPer the recommendation of the Arbitrum Foundation, the proposal will forego the Franchiser contract approach in favor of a multi-signature wallet structure. With the passing of this proposal, the DAO will transfer 7M ARB to the Oversight Committee multi-signature wallet. The Oversight Committee will then delegate the voting rights to the Arbitrum Community Delegation wallet. Should the DAO wish to recall the delegation, an on chain vote will no longer be required. Instead, a snapshot proposal will suffice. In addition to all previously mentioned rights, the Oversight Committee will be beholden to a community Snapshot vote, and will retain the ability to undelegate and return all ARB to the DAO treasury at any point per the request of the DAO.\n\n*Previous Model for Reference: In order to implement this proposal, it is required that we create a DAO-controlled Franchiser contract. The contract owner would be the DAO timelock and it would allow the DAO the power to delegate and undelegate tokens that it sends from the treasury to the Franchiser. We suggest that the Foundation aids in the creation of this contract in order to create an official and safe implementation, though we can likely fork the Trail of Bits audited Uniswap Labs* [*implementation*](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf754A7E347F81cFdc70AF9FbCCe9Df3D826360FA) *\\[*[*github*](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser)*] of the same concept. If this proposal passes Snapshot, we request that the Foundation take the time to fork the contract and hire an auditor to check the implementation.*\n\n*The contract has simple functions:*\n\n* *Fund: allows the DAO to send tokens to contract and delegate to a single address*\n* *FundMany: allows the DAO to send tokens to contract and delegate any amount to multiple addresses*\n* *Recall: allows DAO to pull back funds from Franchiser effectively undelegating and returning tokens to treasury from a single delegate.*\n* *RecallMany: allows DAO to pull back funds from Franchiser effectively undelegating and returning tokens to treasury from multiple delegates.*\n\n*It is worth noting that all tokens sent to the Franchiser will remain a part of the DAO’s balance sheet as it has full-control over the contract. The delegated tokens never leave the DAO’s ownership.*\n\n*Forking and auditing this franchiser contract would be useful for Arbitrum’s version of* [*retroactive delegation*](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/team-12-empowering-underrepresented-delegates/21533) *(updated version to be posted shortly). Crucially, we view both this proposal (delegating to EH’s citizen enfranchisement pool) and the above retroactive delegation proposal (boosting active delegates in the 10k-1m ARB range) as two sides of the same coin of the* [*community’s call*](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/event-horizon-call-for-creative-uses-of-delegation-to-boost-participation/21235/7) *for creative ways to boost citizen participation and governance decision making processes.*\n\n# **Additional Considerations**\n\nThe Arbitrum Event Horizon Oversight Committee: A committee of 5 existing, notable delegates will be voted on by the Arbitrum community to be given the ability to guide the Event Horizon voting pool on matters of Arbitrum metagovernance. A simple 3/5 majority would allow this committee to veto the decisions of the voter pool within the 24 hours between the closing of the Event Horizon proposal, and the underlying DAO’s proposal.\n\nSybil Considerations: it is important to note that the delegated ARB is by a large margin a minority voter amount. Any potential risk of Sybil influence over the public-access block would under almost all conditions not amount to a sum of authority that would be capable of passing a vote absent incredibly significant broader support from other delegates and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem participants. E.g. a rogue vote is virtually impossible.\n\nThat being said, we will be implementing Gitcoin Passport requirements for Arbitrum metagovernance.",

      "title": "ARB Staking: Unlock ARB Utility and Align Governance",
      "content": "## [](#p-52947-constitutional-non-constitutional-1)Constitutional / Non-Constitutional\n\nConstitutional\n\n*\\* Please note that, while the ARB Staking proposal as a whole is constitutional, this onchain proposal targets the Treasury Governor because it controls the ARB treasury.* &#x20;\n\n## [](#p-52947-abstract-2)Abstract\n\nWe propose to unlock ARB utility and improve the governance and security of the Arbitrum protocol by implementing ARB staking, without yet turning on fee distribution to token holders. Through ARB staking, token holders who delegate to active governance participants will be able to capture value. The proposal will also implement a liquid staked ARB token (stARB) via the Tally Protocol that enables any future rewards to auto-compound, is (re)stakeable, and is compatible with DeFi. Separately, we will work with the Arbitrum DAO to decide whether and how to fund rewards and split rewards between token holders and delegates.\n\n## [](#p-52947-motivation-3)Motivation\n\nThe ARB token is struggling to accrue value.\n\n* Governance power is the only source of fundamental demand for ARB, while there are multiple sources of new supply (unlocks, treasury spending).\n* The ability to restake ARB or use it on DeFi is not compatible with governance. Voting power breaks when ARB is deposited into smart contracts. [Less than 1%](https://dune.com/queries/3732998/6278607) of ARB tokens are used actively in the onchain ecosystem.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/36330652-45ac-4d38-b352-1b1598e84c95_original.png)\n\nThe ARB token is struggling as a governance mechanism\n\n* Only about 10% of the circulating supply of ARB is [actively used](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates) in governance\n* Voter participation in the DAO has been [steadily declining](https://dune.com/queries/3829223/6440489) since DAO launch\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/18155bf2-6c43-4e4d-a386-ac4136f0e3d1_original.png)\n\nMeanwhile, the Arbitrum DAO treasury has accumulated over [16 Million $ETH](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/treasury) in surplus fees from Arbitrum One and Nova. As a result, it is becoming economically attractive for a malicious actor to launch a governance attack on the DAO treasury. The potential profit of attacking the DAO treasury is increasing as more ETH accumulates in the treasury, while the cost of attacking the DAO through purchasing ARB for its voting power is not increasing proportionally to defend against attacks. A more developed version of this dynamic exists in the ENS and Compound DAOs, both of which are actively fighting off governance attacks (ENS documented [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-enable-cancel-role-on-the-dao/19090/10)).\n\nARB Staking unlocks utility and aligns governance by creating a mechanism to stream future rewards from DAO-generated sources like sequencer fees, MEV fees, validator fees, token inflation, and treasury diversification to token holders who are delegated to an active governance participant. ARB Staking makes ARB usable in restaking and DeFi by returning voting power locked in contracts to the DAO.\n\n## [](#p-52947-rationale-4)Rationale\n\nThis proposal contributes to Arbitrum [Community Values](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values) by making the Arbitrum DAO more sustainable and secure.\n\n## [](#p-52947-specifications-and-steps-to-implement-5)Specifications and Steps to Implement\n\n### [](#p-52947-system-architecture-6)System architecture\n\nARB Staking enables ARB utility while allowing the DAO to retain governance power. It includes a few modular components that come together to power the system.\n\nGovernance Staking\n\n* Requires that tokens are delegated to an active delegate in order to be eligible to receive rewards (see Karma Integration)\n* Accepts arbitrary fee sources as rewards\n* Is based on Uniswaps audited [UniStaker](https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/UniStaker). Each pool of staked tokens are held in their own special purpose smart contract which can only delegate its own voting power. The governance contract is simple, permissionless, audited and has no special authorities. The contract is upgradable only via Constitutional Proposal by the Arbitrum DAO.\n* Each user owns their own staking vault, and is free to use Governance Staking regardless of whether or not they use stARB (see Tally Protocol LST section below). This allows for maximum flexibility for the DAO and lets others also build yield generating infrastructure for the ARB token.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/044f363e-3ac1-4402-8264-d68b77da5dc6_original.png)\n\nThe DAO\n\n* Has the power to turn on fee distribution and send fees to ARB Staking\n* Controls how voting power is distributed to delegates, including delegation strategies for unused voting power\n\nstARB (Tally Protocol LST)\n\n* Creates a *receipt token* for the ARB which is staked through it, called stARB, and it returns it to the user. The underlying tokens that are staked on the users behalf are always available to redeem, 1:1 plus rewards if applicable, at any time.\n* Auto-compounds potential rewards if they are turned on in the future\n* Provides token holders a liquid position\n* Administers its own Governance Staking vault, not any other vault. stARB has no special powers over the staking contract, and has no access to user’s tokens other than the tokens it manages itself.\n* Will be deployed as an immutable, non-upgradeable contract. The delegation strategies part of the system will upgradeable via Arbitrum DAO Constitutional Proposal. The only part of the system Tally manages is the rebalancing of underlying assets.\n* Can have a withdrawal period, which is configurable by the DAO. The expectation is that any withdrawal period will be very short and is there only to prevent people from abusing the reward mechanism (i.e. staking right before a reward, claiming a chunk of it, and immediately unstaking). If there is a price difference, arbitrageurs can instantly unstake stARB and sell it as ARB to close the price difference. This easy arbitrage opportunity minimizes price discrepancies and makes it difficult for any potential governance attacker to acquire ARB at a discount.\n* Allows stARB holders to continue delegating directly to their preferred delegate.\n* Has the ability to return voting power to the DAO if stARB is deposited into restaking, DeFi, or centralized exchange smart contracts that do not maintain a 1:1 delegation relationship by implementing a [Flexible Voting](https://github.com/ScopeLift/flexible-voting) client. The Arbitrum DAO exclusively has the ability to determine how this voting power is distributed/redelegated via a governance proposal. The DAO will decide how to set up the initial redelegation logic for stARB.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/bdb099d8-154c-4a6c-b9e7-675c2b438159_original.png)\n\n### [](#p-52947-karma-integration-7)Karma integration\n\nGovernance Staking requires that tokens are delegated to an active delegate in order to be eligible to receive rewards. We will define an “active delegate” using Karma Score. The implementation of Karma for ARB Staking is designed to be modular. If, in the future, the DAO wishes to add additional or alternative providers to define “active delegate”, it can do so. The DAO will define the Karma Score requirement for being considered an active delegate. Karma Score is a combination of delegate’s Snapshot voting stats, onchain voting stats and their forum activity. To accurately calculate forum activity score, delegates are required to prove ownership of their forum handle by [signing a message](https://www.karmahq.xyz/dao/link/forum?dao=arbitrum) with their delegate address and posting on the forum. The current Karma score formula is below, which can be adjusted by the DAO going forward:\n\n((100) \\* ((Forum Activity Score \\* 1) + (Off-chain Votes % \\* 3) + (On-chain Votes % \\* 5))) / (Sum of Weights times Max Score Setting \\* 1)\n\nKarma Score will be included in ARB staking via a smart contract that writes data onchain from the Karma API. We will include several guardrails to ensure that this aspect of the implementation is robust and decentralized:\n\n* Users can verify Karma score calculations independently.\n* The DAO will have the ability to block Karma Scores if it believes they are being calculated incorrectly.\n* If Karma scores fail to arrive or the scores are blocked by the DAO, ARB Staking will distribute rewards to all stakers regardless of whether they are delegated to an active governance participant until the situation is resolved.\n\nIn the future, we believe it would make sense to integrate delegate incentives with ARB staking so that, instead of getting delegate incentive funds from the ARB treasury, they come directly from onchain revenue. We will lead a working group to develop a recommendation on this topic.\n\nTally will build ARB staking into our existing [Arbitrum DAO platform](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum), so that users can easily stake and delegate in one place.\n\n### [](#p-52947-parallel-workstreams-staking-rewards-and-delegation-working-groups-8)Parallel workstreams: Staking Rewards and Delegation working groups\n\nIn parallel with the development of ARB Staking, we will lead two separate DAO working groups that are focused on aspects of the system that will be implemented after development is complete.\n\n* The Staking Rewards working group will focus on how to fund staking rewards. It will develop a recommendation about whether staking rewards should be funded by sequencer fees, MEV fees, validator fees, token inflation, treasury diversification, and/or DAO venture investments and how to implement such rewards.\n* The ARB Staking & Delegation working group will focus on how to define an active contributor to the Arbitrum DAO, delegate incentives, and voting power distribution. It will collaborate with Tally and Karma to develop recommendations on Karma Score formula, the minimum Karma Score required to be eligible for staking.\n\nThe working groups will be formed via an open call for contributors that will be posted after this proposal passes the temp check stage. Each working group will deliver their recommendations in October, so that the recommendations can be turned into DAO proposals and created following the implementation of ARB Staking.\n\n### [](#p-52947-integration-with-future-arbitrum-staking-systems-9)Integration with future Arbitrum staking systems\n\nWe anticipate that multiple Arbitrum staking systems will be developed over time, perhaps to incentivize decentralized block production in BoLD or to create an efficient MEV market in Time Boost. We view multiple staking systems as complementary. Each system would ask the staker to do different work for Arbitrum, take different risks, and pay out different rewards. Having multiple systems lets ARB holders pick between different risk/reward payoffs and specialize in different types of work to secure the system.\n\n## [](#p-52947-estimated-timeline-10)Estimated Timeline\n\nPost proposal on forum for feedback: June\n\nPost temp check proposal on Snapshot: August\n\nPost onchain proposal on Tally for funding: August\n\nBegin development: August\n\nSubmit smart contracts for audit: September\n\nSubmit onchain proposal on Tally including full ARB Staking implementation: October\n\nPublish working group recommendations and turn them into DAO proposals: November\n\n## [](#p-52947-overall-cost-11)Overall Cost\n\nIf this proposal passes temperature check, we will submit an onchain proposal that includes $200,000 USD in ARB of funding to cover the costs of development, including the following funding categories:\n\n$50,000 USD in ARB: Develop ARB Staking smart contracts\n\n* Implement staking contracts\n* Integrate Arbitrum’s current and potential fee mechanisms\n* Integrate Karma Score requirement\n* Enable the DAO to block Karma Scores if it believes they are being calculated incorrectly\n\n$20,000 USD in ARB: Integrate ARB Staking into Tally.xyz\n\n$50,000 USD in ARB: Integrate Karma into ARB Staking\nDevelop and deploy a smart contract to store key stats and Karma scores onchain\n\n* Create a system to record stats onchain and store detailed delegate data off-chain (using Arweave or IPFS) for easy verification\n* Continuously improve scoring algorithms to adapt to evolving Arbitrum community needs\n* Provide technical support to delegates experiencing issues with their statistics\n\n$60,000 USD in ARB: Audit ARB Staking smart contracts\n\n* The final cost of the audit including documentation will be published on this thread.

      "title": "Funds to bootstrap the first BoLD validator",
      "content": "**Non-Constitutional**\n\n# **Abstract**\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is seeking **5,134 ETH**, which is a combination of:\n\n* **Assertion and challenge bonds.** 4,234 ETH to allow the Arbitrum Foundation to run a BoLD validator and fulfill the role of being the first honest and active proposer.\n* **Service fees.** 500 ETH to pay proposers who are actively participating and advancing the chain. We estimate the funds will last for 3 years of operation and the Arbitrum Foundation will not be entitled to collect any service fees.\n* **Refund L1 gas costs.** 400 ETH to reimburse all L1 gas costs for active proposers who are actively advancing the chain and defending against malicious challenges, assuming 1 challenge per year.\n\nThis proposal is **contingent** on the proposal “[AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/1)” (constitutional AIP) being approved by the ArbitrumDAO. If the AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD does not pass - then the Arbitrum Foundation will return the funds, in its entirety, to the ArbitrumDAO within 30 days of the [BOLD proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/1) being hypothetically rejected.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nThe [AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/1) is scoped to only propose the technical upgrade and intentionally does not yet include the introduction of an economic incentive mechanism. In the absence of an economic incentive, the ArbitrumDAO holds the risk that no entity will fulfill the role of being the first honest party to secure Arbitrum One. By adopting this proposal, the ArbitrumDAO is appointing the Arbitrum Foundation to be the first active proposer for Arbitrum One.\n\n# **Key Terms**\n\n* **Active proposer**. A proposer who is actively posting assertions and helping advance the chain. Validators are not considered active proposers until they successfully propose an assertion with a bond. In order to become an active proposer for Arbitrum One, post-BoLD, a validator has to propose an L2 state assertion to Ethereum. If they do not have an active bond on L1, they then need to attach a bond to their assertion in order to successfully post the assertion. Subsequent assertions posted by the same address will simply move the already-supplied bond to their latest proposed assertion. There can only be 1 “active” proposer at any point.\n* **Assertion**. A claim posted to the Arbitrum rollup contracts on Ethereum L1 about the Arbitrum L2 execution state. Each claim consumes messages from the Arbitrum rollup inbox contract that are ordered by the Sequencer.\n* **Assertion bond**. Creating an assertion in the rollup contracts requires the proposer to join the validator set by putting up a bond, in the form of 3,600 ETH. Subsequent assertions posted by the same party do not require more bonds, instead, the protocol always considers validators to be bonded to their latest posted assertion until they withdraw.\n* **Challenge bond**. The challenge process in BoLD requires a proposer to post a bond whenever they want to challenge a malicious (and invalid) assertion from a dishonest proposer. This applies to the block level, big-step sub-challenge, and one-step sub-challenge levels, as part of the interactive dispute game played between challengers.\n* **One honest party**. In BoLD, a single, honest party can protect the integrity and liveness of the system. While only a single party is required to act, it is still an open and permissionless system, allowing anyone to step up at any time.\n* **Proposer**. An agent who looks up the list of ordered transactions, executes them off-chain, and then proposes a claim on the final execution output by posting an assertion on-chain. A proposer *must* have a bond deposited into the BoLD rollup contracts on Ethereum to be considered eligible, by the protocol, to post assertions.\n* **Service fee**. A fee for proposers who are actively and successfully posting on-chain assertions which should amount to the same income that Ethereum validators receive over the same time period. The fee is paid for every on-chain assertion posted by the proposer once their assertion is confirmed. This fee removes the disincentive to lock up capital and be a proposer for the protocol and should not be viewed as an incentive or reward.\n\n# **Budget Request**\n\nThis section focuses on the budget request from the ArbitrumDAO treasury alongside the motivation for why the funding is required.\n\n## Assertion and Challenge Bonds (4,234 ETH)\n\nWe are requesting 4,234 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO treasury to cover the bonds required to establish a single honest proposer with the capability to defend the system.\n\nThe requested ETH is a combination of:\n\n* 3600 ETH required to post an assertion bond, and;\n* Subsequent 555 ETH + 79 ETH for challenge bonds for one challenge.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation will deposit these funds in the `RollupCore.sol` contracts on L1 Ethereum for the validator. If the [BoLD AIP](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/1) passes, then the Arbitrum Foundation’s staked validator will be enabled to immediately act as a proposer for Arbitrum One\n\n**Note: the Arbitrum Foundation is proposing to be the first active validator, not the ONLY validator. BOLD removes the reliance on a permissioned set of validators, and any interested parties and/or teams can permissionlessly run nodes and validators for Arbitrum chains upon a successful upgrade of the dispute protocol.**\n\n## Service Fees for BOLD Validators (500 ETH)\n\nAll blockchain systems, including Arbitrum, should reward participants who actively work to advance the system.\n\nIn the case of Arbitrum, the DAO will pay a service fee to an active proposer who is helping to advance the system by posting assertions. If approved, the service fee will correlate to the same annualized income earned by a validator on Ethereum mainnet. At the time of writing, the estimated annual income is approximately 3% to 4% of the staked ETH, according to the [Composite Ether Staking Rate benchmark by CoinDesk Indices](https://www.coindesk.com/indices/ether/cesr).\n\n**We must highlight that this payment is a fee and not a reward**. In BoLD, a new assertion can be posted every round (1 hour) and only a single fee is paid per round. There can be multiple agents who deposit the required assertion bond and run a proposer, but the fee will only be paid to the proposer whose assertion is the first to be accepted on L1. The proposer whose assertion is accepted by L1 and paid the service fee is called the active proposer for this round. Subsequent assertions posted by the same address will simply move the already-supplied bond to their latest proposed assertion. Meanwhile, if an entity, say Bob, has posted a successor assertion to one previously made by another entity, Alice, then Bob would be considered by the protocol to be the current active proposer. Alice would no longer be considered by the protocol as the active proposer and once Alice’s assertion is confirmed, then Alice gets her assertion bond refunded.\n\nWe estimate the following service fee per year:\n\n* Assuming a 4% service fee based on the 3600 ETH bond size, equates to a maximum of 144 ETH per year per active proposer.\n\nThe Foundation is therefore requesting 500 ETH to support service fee payments for **up to 3 years (with a buffer of 68 ETH in case the average Ethereum validator income increases)** in the event that an active proposer, who is not the Arbitrum Foundation, steps up to advance the chain. Moving forward, the DAO may consider allocating a portion of ETH from the ArbitrumDAO governed chains’ sequencer fees to fund the ongoing service fees for active proposers.\n\nTo learn more, please read the section on [Service Fees in the BOLD AIP](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#service-fee-for-active-proposers-7).\n\n***Note: The Arbitrum Foundation will NOT be entitled to receive the service fee.***\n\n## Reimbursement of L1 Gas Costs (400 ETH)\n\nWe are requesting 400 ETH to reimburse the on-chain gas costs for active (and honest) proposers who are helping advance and defend the Arbitrum chain. It is estimated that 400 ETH will be sufficient to cover ~3 years of operational costs.\n\nThere are two on-chain gas costs:\n\n* **Posting assertions.** An active proposer must post an assertion for the chain to advance.\n* **Challenges.** A proposer who is defending the system must participate in a multi-round challenge process.\n\n*Note: we only propose to reimburse L1 gas costs since that is publicly verifiable and computable by all. The off-chain costs to run a proposer will not be reimbursed and it is expected the service fee will be sufficient to help cover the operational cost for it.*\n\n### Estimated Reimbursement Costs\n\nThis section focuses on the estimated costs to reimburse the L1 gas costs for proposers who are actively posting assertions and participating in the challenge process.\n\n#### Assertion Gas Costs\n\nThe on-chain gas costs for posting assertions are available from the BoLD testnet deployed on [Arbitrum Sepolia](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x06a5851f1d2daa5312161efefb62f0c561319f46ca97215a0fbe144774b6d65e):\n\n* **‘stakeOnNewAssertion’ function.** It costs 163,109 gas per invocation.\n\nAssertions are expected to be posted every hour and under normal operations:\n\n* 163109 gas \\* 24 hours \\* 365 days = 1,428,834,840 gas per year.\n\nIf we assume 50 gwei/gas on L1 Ethereum, then the estimated total gas costs will be 71.44 ETH/year. This equates to 214.32 ETH for a 3-year period.\n\n#### Challenge Bonds Gas Costs\n\nA challenge should only occur if a dishonest proposer posts an assertion that is not valid. Given the financial cost to a dishonest proposer, we are not expecting many challenges to occur. Even so, we should always be prepared for the worst-case scenario and be ready to defend against it.\n\nAccording to the [BoLD whitepaper 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10491) and theoretical calculations conducted by the Offchain Labs team, honest moves to defend a full challenge will cost honest parties roughly 62,632,000 gas (not including the top-level assertion).\n\nPer challenge, the L1 gas costs will depend on the gas price at the time of the challenge:\n\n* At a 50 gwei/gas price, this equals 3.1316 ETH in L1 gas costs\n* At a 100 gwei/gas price, this equals 6.2632 ETH in L1 gas costs\n* At a 500 gwei/gas price, this equals 31.316 ETH in L1 gas costs\n\nAssuming one challenge per year for 3 years in the worse case scenario on gas prices, we estimate 93.93 ETH will be required.\n\n#### *Gas Cost Summary*\n\nAssuming a nominal gas price of 50 gwei/gas during normal operations (i.e. no challenges) and assuming an elevated 500 gwei/gas price during a challenge (i.e. worst-case scenario), to fully reimburse an honest party’s gas costs incurred for posting assertions and for performing honest moves to defend Arbitrum in the event of one challenge per year, the Arbitrum Foundation is requesting 400 ETH for 3 years.\n\nThis includes ~308 ETH to cover the above costs and a ~92 ETH buffer in the event of higher gas prices during normal operations, during a challenge, and/or in the event that there is more than one challenge per year.\n\n# Steps to implement & timeline\n\n1. Publication of an AIP to the ArbitrumDAO forums for engaged discussion and debate. (completed)\n2. Two separate temperature checks on Snapshot (both passed).\n   a. [**Bond sentiment**](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x81cc53932edd0891c8f93a502a1ea929ba1ef1ebf76701663c52d5167b323a6d)**.** Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the Arbitrum Foundation’s request for 4,234 ETH to run the first BOLD validator and to cover for one BOLD challenge.&#x20;\n   b. [**Operational cost sentiment**](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x9a4800da3ebd6792a59f02d70467fc6ae158ec2d3d1d941cf095a54cb7c7f0d5)**.** Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the additional service fee for active proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation) and the reimbursement of L1 gas costs for running an active proposer. Total request is 900 ETH to cover a 3-year period.\n3. **Onchain AIP on Tally** (this vote)\n4. Assuming a successful vote on-chain, the funds will be transferred to 2 multi-sig wallets controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation.&#x20;\n   a. The first multi-sig wallet (Multi-Sig A) will receive 4,234 ETH for posting the bond assertion to become the first BoLD validator, as well as to cover for one BoLD challenge, and&#x20;\n   b. the other multi-sig wallet (Multi-Sig B) will receive the 900 ETH meant for service fees and L1 gas costs reimbursements.\n5. The Arbitrum Foundation will then deposit the 3,600 ETH from Multi-Sig A (first multi-sig) in a validator that will be used to secure Arbitrum One, if the [AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232/1) is passed.\n\n# Payment facilitation, final costs & restrictions\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is requesting 5,134 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO to cover the following costs:\n\n* Multi-Sig A\n  * 3600 ETH to run the first BOLD-enabled proposer for Arbitrum One,\n  * 634 (555 + 79) ETH budget to counter one BOLD challenge,\n* Multi-Sig B\n  * 500 ETH as service fees for active BOLD proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation), and,\n  * 400 ETH to reimburse honest parties on their L1 gas costs for 3 years.\n\n**Notable points:**\n\n* **Arbitrum Foundation will not be entitled to the service fee,**\n* **Arbitrum Foundation will be reimbursed for the L1 gas costs,**\n* **All service fee payments will be manually processed by the Arbitrum Foundation on a periodic basis (weekly or monthly) alongside a requirement that all payments adhere to the Foundation’s compliance process.**\n\nAll requested funds will be sent to 2 multi-sig SAFE addresses controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation,  and the funds will be returned if the BoLD proposal is not approved by the ArbitrumDAO. Additionally, after 3 years, any unspent funds from the service fee or gas reimbursements will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO and a subsequent proposal will be posted to help cover the future operational costs of Arbitrum.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO reserves the right to revoke the Arbitrum Foundation’s proposer at any time and return the bonds (i.e. 3600 ETH from Multi-Sig A) back to the treasury. This will be implemented and enforced via the BoLD smart contracts:\n\n* **Withdrawal Address.** The funds will be deposited into BoLD and the withdrawal address set to the ‘UpgradeExecutor’ contract on L1.\n* **Triggering Withdrawal.** The ArbitrumDAO (via governance) or the Arbitrum Foundation will have the authority to trigger a withdrawal and the funds can only be sent to the pre-established withdrawal address (i.e. the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury).\n\nArbitrumDAO also reserves the right to revoke the 634 ETH budget to counter one BOLD challenge (Multi-Sig A); the 500 ETH budget for service fees (Multi-Sig B) and the 400 ETH to reimburse L1 gas costs (Multi-Sig B). The DAO can revoke these funds by raising and passing a Snapshot proposal that requests the Arbitrum Foundation to return the relevant funds to the DAO treasury. The Snapshot proposal will have to meet the quorum of a non-constitutional AIP in order to pass. The Arbitrum Foundation is bound by its [<u>bylaws</u>](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/assets/files/The%20Arbitrum%20Foundation%20Bylaws%2020%20July%202023-d992cde49b3207e89bdec76322e29048.pdf) to serve the needs of the DAO, so if the DAO decides that it wants to clawback funds, the Foundation will be obliged to do so.\n\nPut another way, the ArbitrumDAO will have the authority to single-handedly return the funds back to the ArbitrumDAO treasury. This model can be used for future proposals if other entities want to run a proposer on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO.",

No additional funds beyond the already approved amount are needed to pay the entire operational budget.\n\n*Note: These operational costs will go directly to a Snapshot vote as a separate proposal titled “Operational Budget for STIP Bridge” with options for each of the three line items.*\n\n* Overall Work Done: 50+ applicants over 5 months with 36 completed incentive distributions. While 36M ARB was allocated, only 27.64M ARB was used.\nIn the bridge, each advisor was assigned about 20 protocols during the application phase and followed around 12 protocols each through the entire 5-month program.\n* 100k ARB allocated by:\n**3 Advisors, 58.2K ARB total,**19.4K ARB per advisor (SeedGOV, Jojo The Cow, Castle Capital)\n- 1 Program manager, 34.3K ARB toal. Matt Stein, StableLab\n- 1 Proposal Writer: 5K total. Alex Lumley\n- 5 Multisig signers, 2.5K ARB total. 500 per signer for the LTIPP Multisig.\n\n### Motivation & Rationale\nThe STIP Operational team provided expert advice with many learnings.\n\nOverall Work Done: 50+ applicants over 5 months with 36 incentive distributions. While 36M ARB was allocated only 27.64M ARB was used. In the bridge, each advisor was assigned about 20 protocols during the application phase and followed around 12 protocols each through the entire five-month program.\n\nAdditionally, the greeted DAO community already agreed to this amount with the STIP Bridge. All necessary funds already approved and in multisig: These funds are already stored in the multisig, ready to be distributed once the below Snapshot passes. No additional funds beyond the already approved amount are needed to pay the total operational budget.\n\nAs the work has already been completed this is necessary we should make sure our contributors and community members are fairly compensated.\n\nlist of protocols funded https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/start-of-stip-b-streams-and-timeline-of-incentives/25014\n\nbi-weekly updates of protocols funded: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/biweekly-updates-stip/22\n\n### Specifications\n\nSpecifics on Payment:\n\n*Paid immediately*\n\nCompensation for specific STIP Bridge Operational Contributors:\n\n***Advisors:***\n\n* 58.2K ARB - 19.4K ARB per advisor.\n\n***Including:***\n- JoJo\n- SEEDGov\n- Castle Capital\n\n### Role & Responsibility for STIP Bridge\n\n* Each advisor was assigned about 20 protocols during the application phase and followed around 12 protocols each through the entire 5-month program.\nAdvisors will work for five months, will be responsible for approximately 20 protocols each, and will:\n\n* evaluate old STIP proposals\n* assess results of a protocol’s previous incentives campaign\n* evaluate Addendum proposals\n* suggest feedback tailored to the protocol such as what worked well in their STIP grant and what they should change\n* Help protocols during the three months STIP program in case they need to adapt their program, change specific mechanisms and in general require support.\n\n### Program Manager:\n\n34.3K ARB - Matthew Stein, Stable Labs\n\n### Compensation\n\n* This cost breaks down to 34,300 ARB * 0.56 = $19,208 for 5 months of work (April - September) or $3841.6 per month.\n* For operating a 37.6M ARB program, this is 0.09% of the program’s total cost well below industry standard.\n\n*Program manager responsibilities*\n* Communicate with the 50+ total applicants to ensure they know about the bridge program and how to apply\n* Coordinate the posting of the Addendums to the forum\n* Ensure Addendums are correctly posted\n* Administer deadlines for various phases of the program\n*Handle COI with advisors assigned to protocols\n* Help facilitate the posting of challenge snapshots\n* Handle any conflicts of interest that arise from challenge snapshots\n* Help coordinate with the multisig and protocols to ensure funds are properly distributed and protocols understand the streams\n* Coordinate between the Protocols and Arbitrum Compliance\n* Update grant recipients on program progress as streams start, run, and end\n* Update the DAO on the progress of the program\n* Help connect the program to other areas of the DAO such as the ARDC or LTIPP workstream\n* Help protocols who have questions regarding the incentive rules/timelines\n* Facilitate the return of any unused ARB at the completion of the program\n\n*Author of the proposal:*\n5000 ARB to Alex Lumley\n\n### Role & Responsibility:\n\n* Wrote two distinct proposals: STIP Bridge and the STIP Bridge Operational budget the proposals for STIP Bridge, both the Tally and Snapshot.\n* Throughout 4-6, non-continuous weeks The protocol authors have drafted the proposal, met with delegates for feedback,\n- presented open workshopping calls, implemented feedback, and progressed the proposal toward a vote for the past few months.\n* The hundreds of hours of work put into creating this proposal.\n***Including:***\n- Designing and authoring the proposal\n- Driving delegate outreach, gathering and implementing delegate feedback\n- Hosting workshop calls\n- Reminding delegates to vote and answering last-minute questions\n\n**Multisig:**\n2500 ARB total, 500 ARB / Multisigner\n\n### Previous programs\n\n* The multisig signers included: [multisig 1](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=arb1:0x544cBe6698E2e3b676C76097305bBa588dEfB13A) include Lindsey, Limes, Joseph, Bobbay and Alex Lumley.\n* Multi-sig address: 0x544cBe6698E2e3b676C76097305bBa588dEfB13A\n\n### Current responsibilities\n\n* Each Multisig signer will receive 500 ARB immediately\n* Note that all the streams started, and most of the program passed before the new Arbitrum Multisig even passed Tally (send link).\n* Halting streams based on decisions by the LTIPP Council.\n\n### Steps to Implement\n\n* Post to forum: Answer any questions and make improvements\n* Post to Snapshot\n* Pass Snapshot\n* KYC: Then each OpEx contributor can complete KYC\n* Multisig disperses funds: then the LTIPP multisig can distribute the funds to each OpEx contributor.\n\n### Timeline\nAll the above steps should be completed in 2-4 weeks.\n\n*Note that the STIP Bridge program will run from April to September, with key milestones including protocol evaluations, mid-program reviews, and final reports.*",

      "title": "[Constitutional] Extend Delay on L2Time Lock ",
      "content": "# Abstract\nThe ArbitrumDAO has on-chain governance via a suite of smart contracts. It allows the ArbitrumDAO to spend funds from its treasury alongside upgrading any smart contract that governs Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova. The on-chain smart contract suite includes a voting protocol alongside a series of contracts that will forward the proposal’s intended action to the correct destination before executing it.\n\nThis proposal focuses on extending the time delay between when the voting protocol has concluded and the time it takes for the successful proposal to be passed along by the system until it is in the right destination to be executed. The focus is on the **L2 Core Time Lock** contract that lives on Arbitrum One and proposes changing the delay from 3 days to 8 days which effectively increases the delay by an additional 5 days. Accordingly, the change only applies to constitutional proposals which require upgrades to smart contracts.\n\nThere are two benefits to increasing the delay:\n\n- **Security Council.** The Security Council will have more time to act if a malicious proposal is passed by the ArbitrumDAO for whatever reason.\n- **Exit window.** Users will have more time to withdraw their assets from Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova if they are worried or not satisfied with how a proposal intends to change the smart contracts that govern Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova.\n\nAdditionally, by increasing the exit window, it will also update the status of Arbitrum by L2Beat and replace a red slice with a yellow slice. This will help Arbitrum move one step closer towards a Stage-2 rollup.\n \n![Screenshot 2024-08-29 at 1.26.16 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreiehq4k64tgt6r3tsvdiwojng4a2olhhcxtvpzut6pkrm3nycmb7a4)\n*Image: If this proposal passes, it would change Arbitrum ‘Exit Window’ slice from Red to Yellow, according to [L2Beat](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/arbitrum)*\n    \nThe downside of increasing the delay is that all constitutional proposals, primarily for upgrading the smart contracts, will be delayed by 5 days. It does not impact nor add an additional delay to any spending from the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury including ARB and ETH.\n\n# Time Lock Extension\n\n \n![7804eaf2447a80a7fe71b0255dc311c185c464de_2_1248x632.png](ipfs://bafkreidknqyjhte55xyuixzszebvlo3eejhijhebq7vsg3w5azlvspekcq)\n*Image: Overview of the Current Time Locks*\n    \n\nAll proposals voted on and passed by the ArbitrumDAO must pass through an L2 Time Lock before it can move onto the next stage.\n\nThere are currently two L2 Time Locks that are implemented via the on-chain governance smart contracts.\n\n- **L2 Treasury TimeLock.** Delays all spends from the ArbitrumDAO’s ETH Treasury.\n- **L2 Core TimeLock.** Delays any actions related to on-chain upgrades.\n\nThe proposal focuses on the **Core L2 TimeLock**. It is responsible for passing messages that contain executable code and it has the authority to upgrade any smart contract in the system including on-chain governance and the bridges (holding user assets) on Arbitrum One/Nova.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the governance of smart contracts, please check out this [diagram](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/roundtrip-governance.png?raw=true) and the [docs](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md).\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nThe proposal is to change the value of _minDelay from 259200 (seconds) to 691200 (seconds) in the [L2 Timelock](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x34d45e99f7D8c45ed05B5cA72D54bbD1fb3F98f0#readProxyContract) contract. This will change the time delay from 3 days to 8 days, an additional 5 days.\n\nThe action contract is implemented and still pending an audit: https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/306\n\nAdditionally, we will need to update the following ArbitrumDAO Constitution text:\n\n*Phase 4: L2 Waiting Period (3 days): After an AIP has passed Phase 3, a 3 day waiting period occurs. This gives users who object to the AIP time to initiate withdrawal of their funds or take other action on L2.\n\nPhase 5: Initiate and Finalize an L2-to-L1 Message (at least 1 challenge period of the rollup protocol): After the 3 day waiting period in Phase 4 has passed, an L2-to-L1 message is sent indicating that the AIP was passed.*\n\nThe Constitution Text will be updated to the following:\n\n*Phase 4: L2 Waiting Period (3 or 8 days): After an AIP has passed Phase 3, there is a 3 day waiting period for actions related to the DAO Treasury and an 8 day waiting period for an L2-to-L1 Message. This gives users who object to the AIP time to initiate withdrawal of their funds or take other action on L2.\n\nPhase 5: Initiate and Finalize an L2-to-L1 Message (at least 1 challenge period of the rollup protocol): After the waiting period for Phase 4 has passed, an L2-to-L1 message is sent indicating that the AIP was passed.*\n\nThe new constitution hash: 0x28faf2acba9b3ff80ec484e3d5646931eeef40568b1b7c38dbe52b890bfd7938\n\n# Timeline\n\n- **Feedback Period:** 23/8/24 to 29/8/24\n- **Temperature Check:** 29/8/24 to 5/9/24\n- **ARDC Review:** 5/9/24 to 16/9/24\n- **On-chain vote:** 16/9/24\n\nThere is no cost to the ArbitrumDAO for the implementation of this proposal and an audit will be publicly available prior to the on-chain vote.",

      "title": "Ethereum Protocol Attackathon Sponsorship",
      "content": "## Non-Constitutional  \n\n### Abstract  \nThis proposal seeks funding from the Arbitrum DAO to support an “Attackathon,” a large-scale security audit event organized by the Ethereum Foundation and hosted on the Immunefi platform. The Attackathon will focus on enhancing the security of the Ethereum protocol through three phases: education, active code hunting, and result evaluation. The initiative aims to raise over $2 million, with $500,000 already committed from the Ethereum Foundation. This effort is crucial for ensuring the stability and security of Ethereum, which is vital for maintaining the reliability of projects on Arbitrum.\n\n### Motivation  \nAs a Layer 2 on Ethereum, Arbitrum relies heavily on the security of the Ethereum protocol. Given Arbitrum’s EVM compatibility, vulnerabilities in Ethereum could potentially impact Arbitrum as well. Conducting a comprehensive security audit contest at this time is critical due to the recent major hard forks that have introduced significant changes to Ethereum.\n\nA key component of this Attackathon is the development of educational materials that cater to all levels of security knowledge. This educational program will feature live technical walkthroughs and detailed documentation developed by the Ethereum Foundation, client teams, Solidity developers, and Immunefi, covering a broad scope that includes client, specification, and solidity compiler bugs. By educating security researchers, the Attackathon will cultivate a community of researchers capable of identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities across the Ethereum and Arbitrum ecosystems. This increased awareness and participation in Ethereum’s security ultimately benefits the Arbitrum community by ensuring the continued reliability and safety of the underlying blockchain infrastructure.\n\n### Rationale  \nThe Attackathon aligns with the Arbitrum community’s mission to promote a secure and scalable Ethereum ecosystem. By investing in this initiative, Arbitrum will help Ethereum’s security, which directly impacts Arbitrum’s scalability and user trust. Moreover, the educational component of the Attackathon will benefit Arbitrum by upskilling security researchers, providing them with the knowledge and tools needed to conduct thorough audits and improve security across the network.\n\nAdditionally, Arbitrum can benefit from the collaborative efforts of the Ethereum Foundation and Immunefi, positioning itself as a proactive leader in the Ethereum community. Participation in the Attackathon provides Arbitrum with the opportunity to engage with top security researchers and improve its security posture. As a sponsor, Arbitrum will gain visibility and credibility among developers and users, further solidifying its reputation as secure and forward-thinking.\n\n### Key Terms  \n- **Attackathon:** A comprehensive and time-boxed security audit event involving education, active vulnerability hunting, and result evaluation phases.  \n- **Immunefi:** A leading bug bounty platform specializing in blockchain and smart contract security.  \n- **Hard Fork:** Significant upgrades or changes to the protocol that may introduce new code and, potentially, new vulnerabilities.  \n- **Solidity Compiler:** The tool used to compile Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity into bytecode, which is executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\n### Specifications  \n#### Platforms and Technologies:  \n- **Ethereum Protocol:** The primary focus of the security audit, with an emphasis on identifying vulnerabilities in core protocol code, client software, and the Solidity compiler.  \n- **Immunefi:** The platform hosting the Attackathon, responsible for managing submissions, triaging bug reports, and distributing rewards.  \n- **Ethereum Foundation:** Providing funding and oversight for the Attackathon, including contributions to the reward pool and logistical support.\n\n#### Design Decisions:  \n- **Scope:** The contest will have a broad scope including specification bugs, client bugs, deposit contract bugs, and Solidity compiler vulnerabilities.  \n- **Inclusion of the Solidity Compiler:** By including the Solidity compiler in the scope, the Attackathon directly addresses potential vulnerabilities in the primary programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, which is crucial for both Ethereum and Arbitrum.\n\n### Related Work  \n- **Ethereum Bug Bounty Program:** The permanent bug bounty program has been effective but lacks visibility. The Attackathon aims to increase participation and awareness through a focused, large-scale event.\n\n### Steps to Implement  \nThe primary role of the Arbitrum DAO in this initiative is to provide funding support for the Attackathon. By contributing to the reward pool, Arbitrum will ensure that the event attracts top-tier security researchers and maximizes its impact on the security of the Ethereum protocol. Additionally, the Arbitrum community can assist in promoting the Attackathon to raise awareness and encourage participation.\n\n### Estimated Timeline  \n- **July 8-11:** EthCC program announcement  \n- **Aug 19th:** Detailed program announcement and education kickoff  \n- **September 2nd:** Attackathon hunting begins  \n- **October 27th:** Attackathon concludes, and results compilation begins  \n- **October 28th:** Review period begins  \n- **Early January:** Results announced\n\n### Overall Cost  \nThe Arbitrum DAO has two options for sponsoring the Attackathon:\n\n#### Unicorn Partners (+75 ETH Commitment) (limited to two sponsors)\n- 1x Unique NFT with leaderboard rank  \n- Participation in Attackathon Kick-off Twitter Space as a partner speaker  \n- Leaderboard Placement on Sponsor page  \n- Top-tier logo placement on Sponsor and Program Landing Page  \n- Top-tier logo placement on the Program Education page and program report  \n- Call out in Press Releases and EF and Immunefi Program Announcement Blogs  \n- Digital Logo Placement in the results announcement at Devcon or a dedicated virtual event  \n- An Arbitrum Boost (Audit Contest) on Immunefi with up to a $100K rewards pool at 100% Immunefi Discount within 180 days of the conclusion of the Ethereum program  \n- 1x Dedicated Twitter post announcing sponsorship from Immunefi Twitter handle\n\n#### Panda Partners (+30 ETH Commitment)\n- 1x Unique NFT with leaderboard rank  \n- Leaderboard listing on the sponsor landing page  \n- Mid-roll logo placement on Sponsor and Program Landing Page  \n- An Arbitrum Boost (Audit Contest) on Immunefi with up to a $100K rewards pool at 100% Immunefi Discount within 180 days of the conclusion of the Ethereum program  \n- 1x Dedicated Twitter post announcing sponsorship from Immunefi Twitter handle\n\nBy supporting the Attackathon, Arbitrum can leverage the findings to ensure its network remains robust against vulnerabilities. This initiative not only enhances security but also demonstrates Arbitrum’s commitment to the ecosystem.",

During this period, we will deliver strategic proposals, guide key partners through the DAO processes, and align the priorities of essential stakeholders for the betterment of Arbitrum. We will also expand our efforts to include a small set of additional verticals by hiring skilled contributors in areas where the DAO needs support, such as data analytics, technical proposal creation, marketing, or any other needs that may arise.\n\nWith a budget of $2.47M for the year paid in monthly installments and stored with the Foundation for DAO-clawback capabilities, along with an optional up to 1.5 million ARB for performance-based bonuses voted on by the DAO near the end of the term and put in a 3-year vesting contact to ensure long-term alignment, we will continue to build a dedicated team focused solely on enhancing the Arbitrum DAO’s success. The primary goal of our work is to help Arbitrum DAO continue its path toward efficient and effective operations and execute its long-term vision of becoming a sustainable entity with diversified revenue streams. We believe that over the coming years, Arbitrum DAO has the potential to generate hundreds of millions of dollars per year while maintaining its status as the leading Ethereum scaling solution with an ever-growing base of users and developers. All of Entropy Advisors’ employees will work full-time towards achieving this goal.\n\n# Motivation and Rationale\n\nArbitrum DAO is set up to prosper with its cutting-edge technology stack that will soon support numerous coding languages, a vibrant community of users and developers, abundant resources in the DAO treasury, and the ecosystem’s commitment to scaling the most decentralized and secure L2 on Ethereum. Despite our belief that Arbitrum holds a strong position in the market today, there is a lot of work to be done over the next 3-5 years to ensure Arbitrum maintains and advances its position. We have diagnosed some key areas in need of improvement that we feel well suited to take on:\n\n1. **Designing, drafting and executing proposals that benefit Arbitrum.**\n2. **Strengthening overall governance processes and providing feedback to other DAO contributors, unlocking efficiencies and ensuring redundant work is avoided.**\n3. **Acting as a mesh layer between key stakeholders, e.g., active delegates, development teams such as Offchain Labs, and the Arbitrum Foundation.**\n4. **Helping potential 3rd party strategic partners navigate the DAO to attract high-quality companies and individuals within the ecosystem and RFP applicant pools.**\n5. **Attracting/retaining top talent working full-time, professionally on behalf of Arbitrum DAO.**\n6. **Improving the ability of the DAO to spend money effectively and support a long term sustainable future for Arbitrum.**\n\nToday the Arbitrum DAO faces friction executing across all of the aforementioned tasks. Many times those creating proposals have known or unknown ulterior motives and incentives at play. It is difficult for aspiring contributors and partners to navigate the DAO. No one is incentivized to bolster RFP applicant pools. Communication is fragmented with no entity in place to tie perspectives together, and operations/goals often overlap across initiatives. There are numerous proposals that are consensus to move forward but do not progress because there is no financial incentive to do so. There is inadequate accountability over and transparency into DAO funded programs. The problems are ever-evolving and growing, and the Arbitrum DAO needs an entity that only has the DAO’s best interests in mind to fill the gaps.\n\nOur team ([@swmartin19](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/swmartin19), [@mattonchain](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/mattonchain), and [@pruitt](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/pruitt)) brings an extensive network as well as experience in research, governance, brand building, and project management to the Arbitrum DAO, having led well-known brands in the space such as Blockworks Research and 404 DAO. We have all been involved in the DAO since the beginning, starting with Blockworks Research’s entry into the DAO by [highlighting flaws ](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-1-arbitrum-improvement-proposal-framework/30/91)in the DAO’s very first proposal, AIP-1. We are not afraid to push against the status quo if we believe it helps Arbitrum achieve its goals.\n\nEntropy Advisors was extremely fortunate to receive a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation. As such, we have been able to use the past few months contributing full-time to Arbitrum DAO to further showcase our value in the community. We have hosted bi-weekly 1-on-1 calls with a cohort of large delegates, with the foundation, and with OCL, and feel that we have a strong hold on various stakeholder’s interests, strategic goals for Arbitrum, working initiatives, etc. When paired with our experience and networks within the industry, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to help Arbitrum achieve its long-term goals with all stakeholder perspectives in mind. With exclusivity meaning no official or unofficial engagements with any other client, Entropy Advisors can serve Arbitrum DAO with no ulterior motives or conflicts of interest.\n\nToday, virtually no money is spent on operations, while the DAO has spent almost 435M ARB in total with ~95% going towards investments, incentives, and grants (Source: Delphi & R3gen). We believe it is absolutely imperative for the DAO to make an investment in operations, simultaneously ensuring different initiatives across the ecosystem can be set in motion swiftly, fit together seamlessly, and can reach the best talent, while the DAO’s expenditures can be managed in a way that enables long-term sustainability. It is evident that this is becoming a wider-reaching theme within the DAO, but requires a heavy lift (see [OpCo 2](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-opco-scale-structure-synergy/22737) proposal from @dkpremia that asks for 25M ARB). We are NOT looking to replace OpCo, but rather drastically reduce the scope and funding request by helping formulate operational procedures until the OpCo is formally stood up. At that point, the DAO can decide what role Entropy Advisors plays as a service provider to the OpCo.\n\nWith the budget as outlined, Entropy will be able to hire up to 10 employees with a diverse range of skill sets including governance, data analytics, marketing, and development/engineering. We will be able to hire top talent in our industry who will dedicate their full-time bandwidth to Arbitrum DAO. Regardless of Arbitrum’s current strategic priorities, whether cutting costs or scaling strategies, our team will work to execute the goals of the DAO. Given Arbitrum’s dominance, size, and number of initiatives it is important that we build a well-rounded team at Entropy that can operate as the tip of the spear as a catalyst for change across the many sectors that the DAO operates.\n\n# Entropy’s Portfolio\n\nAt the beginning of May, we [introduced ](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/entropy-advisors-print-hello-world/23675/9)Entropy Advisors to the Arbitrum DAO. We are a governance operations-focused business, working exclusively with Arbitrum. Our initial efforts have already driven several notable initiatives, demonstrating our capability and commitment to enhancing the Arbitrum DAO:\n\n[<img height=\"478\" width=\"269\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/37035e093baa2d6120dc4b99ec3fe1f27fb40f96_2_269x478.jpeg\" />](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/37035e093baa2d6120dc4b99ec3fe1f27fb40f96.jpeg)\n\n\n\n* Worked with [@r3gen\\_Finance](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/r3gen_finance) to create a [proposal 1](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3d5ffb8e23b5f22f495f6460ef5ee8771efe5da5565dfa011917a78a2ec25916) that reduces DAO OpEx on multi-sig signers, by establishing the Multisig Support Service.\n* We leveraged our network to ensure a competitive applicant pool, which ultimately resulted in one of the most [competent applicant rosters](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-multi-sig-support-service-mss-nomination-thread/24773) (40 in total) in the DAO’s history despite just a $1,500-$2,500 monthly wage per signer.\n  * The proposal is expected to save the DAO almost $400,000 per year.\n  * Entropy managed the application process, and will soon host a call with the winning applicants to go over multi-sig best practices.\n* Conducted [research](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrum-gas-fees-sequencer-revenue/24730) into Arbitrum DAO’s sequencer margin / transaction fee mechanism, kicking off a conversation that aims to increase the DAO’s treasury value rather than deplete it of resources.\n  * Attended/helped drive forward discussions related to DAO [budgeting](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/call-to-discuss-the-creation-of-a-dao-budget/24802) and sequencer [revenue](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/call-to-discuss-arbitrums-fees-and-sequencer-revenue/24824) through working group calls.\n  * Followed up with a formal [proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/adjusting-arbitrum-s-gas-fees/25002) to increase the L2 minimum base fee on Arbitrum One, with plans to establish a more long-term solution that includes service providers.\n  * **This proposal, if passed, could bring the DAO an extra $5-15M per year of profit.**\n  * We also [tapped](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-support-creation-of-an-arbitrum-dao-budget/23802) on the ARDC to conduct research into these areas, thereby utilizing existing resources at the DAO’s disposal rather than wasting additional resources.\n* [Moved quickly](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/22498645709460639498013508413205734891453964526622655693207250687057651118730) to get Hack Humanity, the entity behind GovHack, ample funding to throw an event in Brussels at ETH CC for the Arbitrum community. These events require a substantial amount of lead time to plan, and the event would not have been possible if a few extra weeks had passed prior to getting the event funded.\n  * This is a great example of Entropy Advisors helping 3rd party service providers navigate the DAO while also combatting the collective inactive problem mentioned above. Everyone wanted Arbitrum DAO representation in Brussels and Entropy stepped in to get it done.\n* Introduced a [governance calendar ](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/improving-predictability-in-arbitrum-dao-s-operations/25136)that encourages proposals to start and finish Snapshot and Tally voting on the same day each week, requires some support from delegates before proposals move to Snapshot from the Forum, and a holiday break at the turn of the new year.\n  * The goal of this proposal was to reduce delegate fatigue by incorporating a more predictable structure, and ensuring things only go to Snapshot once they have been thoroughly reviewed by the broader community.\n* As mentioned above, Entropy has bi-weekly meetings with active delegates, members from OCL, and the Foundation in an effort to streamline communication throughout the DAO. This has helped ensure no two entities are working on the same thing in silos and will become more important in the future as we define the DAO’s long-term strategic vision.\n* By leveraging our existing network, we have kicked off discussions with potential major partners for the DAO. We will always be representing Arbitrum DAO in a high-value context, even though sometimes it won’t be visible to the broader DAO until the end of the negotiations’ lifecycle.\n\n# Specifications\n\nIf this proposal passes, Entropy Advisors will sign a 1-year exclusivity agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation. The partnership will begin on the first of the month after this proposal passes. During this time, Entropy will service no other clients in any capacity. We will achieve the aforementioned goals through the following deliverables:\n\n### Proposals-as-a-Service (PaaS)\n\n* Neutral Proposal Broker\n  * Hold introductory strategy meetings with key Arbitrum stakeholders and partners to help them navigate the DAO. Facilitate introductions between delegates, contributors, DAO leaders, and key strategic partners.\n  * Assist with drafting and delivering proposals from select third parties to the DAO.\n* Proposal Incubation\n  * Facilitate the oversight and creation of neutral DAO frameworks and initiatives that do not benefit Entropy and only have the DAO’s best interests in mind.\n  * The idea behind Entropy is to assemble a team composed of highly capable DAO contributors with differing perspectives and expertises—we will use our collective brain power to create proposals that benefit Arbitrum over the long term and are aligned with community priorities.\n  * Enable the DAO to expedite and refine proposals more precisely, addressing the recurring issue of proposals being approved without sufficient details on execution and long-term planning.\n\n### Strategy and Ecosystem Alignment\n\n* Serve as the liaison between Arbitrum’s key stakeholders\n  * Host meetings with key stakeholders and report needs and updates between the relevant parties. Report notes to DAO when able.\n  * Turn conversations and takeaways into an actionable plan and begin executing.\n* Product and Strategy\n  * Regularly discuss with application developers within the Arbitrum ecosystem, relay this information to development teams/the Foundation, and use the insights to create discussions with clear goals on the Arbitrum governance forum.\n  * Assist the key stakeholders on partnerships/integrations as needed. We will serve as an extra set of eyes to highlight emerging technologies and trends within crypto, aiding Arbitrum parties when we can be helpful.\n  * Generally speaking, ensure that the Arbitrum DAO is on track to becoming a sustainable entity with sensible spending and a focus on profit generation.\n\nData and Brand Building\n\n* Build up a high-value brand through various mediums, such as X/Twitter with educational content and research, YouTube/Apple/Spotify through a podcast, and email through weekly newsletters.\n  * Bring visibility into DAO initiatives and RFPs.\n  * Represent the DAO professionally and with a demeanor that the community can be proud of.\n* Aid DAO-funded organizations like the ARDC and OBL in conducting research and analytics to inform proposal development.\n  * Utilize data analytics to help the DAO with accountability and transparency around its initiatives.\n\n# Vision\n\nOur vision for working with the Arbitrum DAO is structured in three key phases, each building upon the success of the previous one to ensure a thriving partnership.\n\n### \\[Complete] Phase 1: Establishing The Foundation For Entropy<>Arbitrum\n\nIn the initial phase, our focus was on establishing a solid foundation by identifying and addressing key pain points within the DAO. This involved acting as a neutral party to broker proposals, aligning stakeholders, attracting talent, and improving strategic partner onboarding and stakeholder relations. Our initial efforts have already demonstrated notable progress in a short time period, setting the stage for a more capable DAO.\n\nDuring Phase 1 we identified how Entropy fits into the broader DAO, and how we can be most useful. This involved lessons learned in passing proposals, project management, and working with new and existing partners. Additionally, we took this time to start building relationships with all of the DAO’s most active stakeholders including many delegates, members of the foundation, protocol teams, and key individuals at Offchain Labs.\n\n### \\[This Proposal] Phase 2: Passing a DAO Proposal For One Year of Continued Work.\n\nOver the next year, we will build on the foundations we have established, aiming to make the Arbitrum DAO an efficient and effective community dedicated to long-term sustainability through the points brought up in the Motivation & Rationale section.\n\nWe will enhance governance processes by ensuring the initiatives we develop and implement focus on accountability. By fostering stronger relationships between key stakeholders we will ensure more cohesive collaboration. Through data, quantitative, and qualitative analysis we will begin to analyze active initiatives and propose clawbacks and other mechanisms to decrease DAO spend to focus its budget on high ROI initiatives.\n\nLeveraging our extensive network, we will secure partnerships that bring value to the DAO, enhancing the overall ecosystem. Additionally, we will pick up small lift brand and marketing campaigns to help bring awareness to DAO initiatives. We will continue to attract and retain high-quality contributors by offering competitive compensation, professional development opportunities, and a collaborative work environment.\n\nThrough strategic projects, such as well-thought-out economic stimulation, we will support the DAO in generating sustainable revenue streams. Our proposal includes an agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation so that if the OpCo is stood up in the next year, we can easily port our agreement to fall under its purview instead of the Foundation.\n\n### Phase 3: A Well-Oiled Machine\n\nIn Phase 3, we envision Entropy Advisors as a well-oiled machine, seamlessly servicing the Arbitrum DAO. Entropy will grow together with the ecosystem, continuing to perfect the deliverables mentioned earlier while looking for areas where we can add value. By this stage, we will have employed and retained top talent, creating an environment where the DAO operates at peak efficiency. Our efforts will help position Arbitrum as the clear-cut leader in the rollup ecosystem, driving innovation, growth, and success.\n\nAt this point OpCo should be well underway and Entropy Advisors will continue to serve as a service provider to OpCo, if viewed as beneficial. The DAO will be able to retain a second year of Entropy’s services under the same terms stipulated in this proposal, if it desires to do so. For this second-year engagement clause to be executed in the future, the DAO will also need to vote in favor of the future bonus proposal discussed below. If the OpCo is stood up, this entity can be responsible for the potential renewal in place of a DAO vote. This structure would come into effect at the end of our initial 1-year term.\n\n# Short Term Deliverables\n\nWe are committed to defining clear goals for the coming weeks and months, while also encouraging collaboration with other contributors. Our proposed initiatives include, but are not limited to:\n\n1. **Proposal for a DAO-led Events Strategy**\n2. **Facilitate Process to Get OpCo Up and Running**\n   a. Part 1: Ratifying DAO vision, mission, and goals\n   b. Part 2: Establishing oversight mechanisms\n   c. Part 3: Outlining a barebones scope for OpCo, including a budget for setup and initial roles\n3. **Proposal for Chain Economic Parameters Management**\n4. **Ready to Turn Failed Proposals into Frameworks**\n   a. If needed, transforming unsuccessful proposals into actionable frameworks (as needed, potentially treasury mgmt, incentives, etc for example)\n5. **Kickstarting Stylus Development Proposal(s)**\n6. **Proposals for Bringing Strategic Partners for the DAO (Stablecoin, Gaming, Native DEX, Dev Shop, for example)**\n7. **Author at least 1 research report that provide the DAO insight into problems we identify**\n8. **Delegate Code of Conduct Proposal**\n9. **Hiring a Data Analyst**\n\nWe are committed to fostering an inclusive environment where multiple parties can work and provide input together to achieve these objectives.\n\nIn order to address our promise to give the DAO the ability to directly and openly provide input into the work we are facilitating, we will be posting monthly Short Term Deliverables similar to the ones included above in an “Entropy” category in the forum. We will call for feedback on our workload and goals, and ask for suggestions as to how to either add new initiatives or remove existing ones from our workload. We will additionally host an Entropy office hour biweekly open to all.\n\n# Cost & Budget Breakdown\n\n**Salaries: $1.96M**\n\n* Justification: According to [Delphi 5](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HGkU4uF_Lz5Y_qiOaimLAVxYdy9JfEn3DfIraJCUY0E/edit), a VC analyst (the lowest level employee) makes $85,000-$160,000 + a carry with more senior positions making significantly more. Employees cost an employer substantially more than base salary due to benefits, taxes, and other assorted costs. This ensures competitive compensation to attract and retain top talent, with our goal being to hire up to 10 employees. Additionally, we will be able to hire independent contractors and service providers on a project-by-project basis as needed. We are doing highly specialized work, and obtaining experienced individuals in the middle of a bull market with extensive experience in operations, project management, finance, and governance that are also crypto native will be expensive.\n\n**Legal, Insurance, and Accounting: $90K**\n\n* Justification: Covers necessary legal, insurance, and accounting services to ensure compliance and protect the organization. As a company operating in a forward-facing role in the governance space, a sufficient budget is necessary to protect against changing tides in the regulatory environment. Costs include setting up a Cayman Entity, D\\&O + E\\&O insurance, accountant’s hours, ESOP, employee agreement reviews, and more.\n\n**Conference Travel, Offsites, and Small Events: $105K**\n\n* Justification: It is important that Entropy represent Arbitrum DAO at industry leading events. Hosting our own small events is important for brand building. Offsites and conferences can cost as much as $5,000 per employee in attendance. Even throwing a small “Happy Hour” type event can cost between $5,000 and $15,000. This enables Entropy members to attend industry conferences, conduct 1-2 offsites per year, and host 1-2 small events to foster team collaboration and engagement with the community. All while representing Arbitrum DAO in a professional manner.\n\n**Assorted Software: $21K**\n\n* Justification: Enterprise Dune, Gusto, QuickBooks, Replit, Google Suite, Web Hosting, Laevitas, Token Terminal, Open AI API, Slack, etc. Provides essential tools and platforms for data analysis, development, operations, and communication.\n\n**Office / Misc: $70K**\n\n* Justification: Covers expenses for coworking spaces, office equipment (laptops, podcast materials, office stipend), dinner stipend for late nights, and other miscellaneous costs to support a productive work environment.\n\n**Operating Budget Subtotal: $2.246M**\n\n**Margin / Contingency (~10%): $224K**\n\n* Justification: Provides a buffer for unforeseen expenses and ensures the project’s smooth progression and some potential profit for the company over year 1.\n\n### Total Budget: $2.47M\n\n## Payment Details and Clawback\n\nWhile the Entropy team scales, they will be eligible to claim a reduced $100,000 per month and after crossing the threshold of 7 employees dedicated to Arbitrum, will be eligible to claim regular monthly payments ($2,470,000/12 = $205,834) for the remainder of the 12 month term. Payments that have accrued can be claimed at any time.\n\nA total of 6 million ARB will be sent to the Foundation, for them to monetize at their discretion to secure at least $2,470,000. Any Excess ARB not monetized (or stored for the potential bonus below) and excess stables from lower payments during the initial scaling of Entropy will be sent back to the DAO by the Foundation.\n\n### Termination and Clawback\n\nThe DAO may vote via Snapshot to terminate Arbitrum’s relationship with Entropy Advisors at any time. Quorum for this proposal will be set at the same level as ongoing non-constitutional onchain proposals, with quorum defined as total votes for termination+abstention, and the proposal must have more voting power in favor of termination than against or abstaining. If the Snapshot proposal passes, the DAO can terminate the agreement with Entropy Advisors, effective on the last day of the month in which the Snapshot passes, effectively stopping any future payment at that moment. In this scenario, all funds earmarked for Entropy Advisors will be returned to the DAO by the Foundation.\n\n### ARB Bonus – Maximum of 1.5M ARB\n\nThe Foundation will hold 1.5 million ARB allocated to potential performance bonuses. As the 1-year period comes to a close, Entropy will post a Snapshot vote so that the DAO may decide if the bonus should be distributed. The DAO will have the options of no bonus, 10% bonus, 25% bonus, or a 40% bonus. The bonus will be denominated in the dollar equivalent of ARB in relation to the initial funding amount ($2.47M) requested in this proposal. For example, if the DAO is only slightly pleased with the amount of work we conduct and the 10% bonus is voted for, Entropy will receive $247K of ARB tokens – which will depend on the spot price of ARB at the time of the snapshot’s passing. The amount of ARB distributed as a bonus cannot exceed the 1.5M ARB amount being escrowed by the Foundation. If the proposal passes, the Foundation will send the X (TBD number) ARB to a 3-year vesting smart contract that pays out to Entropy Advisors in monthly streams. This ensures Entropy Advisors remains aligned with the DAO and ARB token even after this agreement has expired and as we move into Phase 3 and onward.\n\n### Return\n\nThe Foundation will send all funds in excess of – $2,470,000 + 1.5 million ARB – back to the DAO. At the end of the year, any additional dollars resulting from months where Entropy receives $100,000 instead of the full allocation, and remainder from 1.5M ARB if the full bonus is not allocated, will also be returned.\n\n### Transparency Reporting\n\nAt the end of each fiscal quarter, we will publish a transparency report that goes over our activities and total spending. Information included will be what we have done, an analysis of impact, and the total cost associated with running the business.\n\n## Our vision is to turn Arbitrum into a sustainable entity with durable operations in place. Entropy will be the spearhead of catalyzing operational change and leave long-lasting structure in its wake.",

      "title": "Should the DAO Create COI & Self Voting Policies?",
      "content": "This is a temperature check to gauge the DAO's overall opinion on creating official conflict of interest and self-voting policies. No social contract, guidelines, or policy will be adopted directly from the result of this vote. \n\nPlease find the full proposal on the forums, certain sections such as Enforcement and Timeline have been removed to adhere to character limits: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/should-the-dao-create-coi-self-voting-policies/26062\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to restart the conversation around the creation of self-voting and conflict of interests policies. The proposal outlines various options, ranging from maintaining the status quo to enforcing strict self-voting policies. A Snapshot vote to gauge the DAO's sentiment will be posted on Thursday, August 15th. Please note, this is an **actual temperature check**, just to gauge the DAO’s opinion on the subject. Based on the results, certain policies may be included in a future delegate of code of conduct as part of an effort to professionalize the DAO’s operations.\n\n## Background\n\nStrict policies regarding conflicts of interest (COI) and self-dealing are standard practices in traditional corporate industries. However, with crypto just now emerging from an early stage, entirely avoiding conflict of interests is challenging. Many individuals are either investors, employees, or contributors across multiple companies/protocols on not only Arbitrum, but other L1/L2 chains.\n\nSeveral other DAOs have established a code of conduct in an attempt to address these issues. Examples range from being opt-in recommendations ([Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-delegate-code-of-conduct/20913)), simple pledges ([Maker](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/recognised-delegate-code-of-conduct/9384), [Gitcoin](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/about-gitcoin/code-of-conduct), [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-delegate-code-of-conduct/12981)), and strict no self-dealing policies & expectations enforced by a council and violations resulting in suspension from the DAO’s platforms (Optimism: [Code of Conduct Committee](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-code-of-conduct-rescoping-2/8101), [Optimist Expectations](https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimist-expectations/7241)).\n\nWhile Arbitrum has standard [rules of engagement](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/community-guidelines/12807?u=pruitt) for the forums, it currently lacks a delegate code of conduct in addition to an official policy on conflicts of interest. The only mention of the term in the Arbitrum [Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution) is in relation to candidate eligibility for the Security Council.\n\nCreating a self-voting policy was first [raised](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/self-voting-policy-discussion-arbitrumdao-constitution/20886/8) by @Immutablelawyer at the beginning of 2024 following the LTIPP council elections. While the post resulted in a good discussion, many delegates at the time indicated a strong preference to not move forward with any policy that restricted a delegate’s ability to vote. Thus a temperature check to gather the larger DAO’s sentiment on this issue never occurred.\n\nIn recent weeks, the topic has reemerged in conversations, and as part of a series of proposals focusing on professionalizing the Arbitrum DAO’s operations, Entropy Advisors is looking to restart the conversation on a proposed self-voting and COI policy in order to reach a definite consensus. Policies that are voted are favored by the DAO will be included in a future delegate code of conduct proposal.\n\n## Rationale\n\nWe would argue that within a DAO’s operations, the majority of instances involving COI are the result of an individual/company using their delegated voting power to engage in self-voting or “self-enrichment”. This can exist when a delegate votes for themselves to get elected to a committee, thereby receiving financial gain, or a delegate votes in favor of a proposal that directly benefits themselves or their company. There are certainly other situations where COI can arise such as oversight, but for the purposes of this proposal, the focus is centered on the practice of self-voting.\n\nFor clarity and the purposes of this conversation we will lean on the definitions that @Immutablelawyer established back when the topic of self-voting was previously [discussed](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/self-voting-policy-discussion-arbitrumdao-constitution/20886).\n\n* **Conflicts of Interest:** A situation where a token-holder or their close-associates stand to directly benefit from the outcome of a proposal.\n* **Self-Voting:** The practice of where token holders use their voting power to vote on proposals that involve or benefit themselves.\n* **Self-Enrichment (Self-Dealing):** The act of increasing or enhancing one’s own personal financial wealth as a result of one's own vote.\n\nAs mentioned above, the majority of comments indicated that it was unwise to restrict a delegate’s ability to vote in any manner. To paraphrase the discussion, hesitation to implement a self-voting policy boiled down to primarily two reasons:\n\n* **Philosophical Objections:** Delegates are entrusted by token holders to best represent their own values and interests. Forcing a delegate to abstain from a vote due to COI concerns prevents the delegate from truly representing their base’s interests and thus disenfranchises the token holders delegating.\n* **Lack of Enforceability:** Even if self-voting was monitored manually by contributors or a committee, it is quite easy to circumvent self-voting policies onchain by simply transferring voting power to anonymous wallets. To quote @DisruptionJoe, in general, “unenforceable rules create situations where bad actors have an advantage over good actors''.\n\nWhile both are strong objections, there are positives to implementing COI and self-voting policies. First, they help establish the “rules of the game”, so that every participant in Arbitrum governance is operating under the same set of expectations. Furthermore, disclosure requirements can help lead to greater transparency while also incentivizing participants to act in an ethical manner. Most importantly, with such policies standard practice in other industries, Arbitrum DAO can improve its image as a professional organization by holding its actors to similar standards.\n\n## Specifications\n\nBelow are a few policy options the DAO can adopt to help address and mitigate COI and self-voting. The options are presented from least restrictive (do nothing) to what we view as the most restrictive.\n\n**Keep the Status Quo:** Arbitrum DAO can continue to operate as it has been. A delegate code of conduct does not need to include specific policies on disclosure or self-voting.\n\n**Disclosure and Transparency Policy:** If a potential COI exists, it is expected that proposal authors or delegates disclose the nature and extent of the interest. While it may not always be clear if an individual stands to gain “directly” or “indirectly”, it is recommended to lean on the side of over-communication in the name of transparency. Delegates are not expected to abstain or alter their voting preferences in any way, but are free to choose to abstain.\n\n**“Responsible Voting” Policy in Elections:** In an election with multiple seats, candidates may vote for themselves as long as they also cast votes to fill the remaining positions. Put more simply, a candidate should not cast a vote solely for themselves in an election. In the case of a weighted voting election, the candidate's weight for themself should not be larger than the weights for other candidate. To the best of their ability they should strive to make the weights as equal as possible among the number of candidates necessary to fill each position. \n\n* Example: I am running in the GCP council election, which has 3 open seats. I can vote for my own candidacy, but must also cast 2 additional votes for other candidates.\n\nThis is a policy that has worked well in other DAOs and helps address the natural incentive to withhold votes for competing candidates in an election while also making sure token-holders are not disenfranchised.\n\nCredit to @JoJo for the term “Responsible Voting”.\n\n**Strict Self-Voting Policy:** In the event of a conflict of interest, under the simple definitions stated in the Rationale above, it is expected that a delegate or proposal author abstains during the voting process. In the event that \"Abstain\" is not presented as a voting option, it is expected that the delegate votes in a neutral manner as to not impact the results of the vote. For example, in an election a delegate may even divide their voting power in equal weight to effectively abstain. This policy would include candidates being prevented from self-voting in elections and delegates from voting on proposals that directly benefit oneself, company, or interests.\n\n### Voting Choices\n\nThe temperature check on Snapshot will use [approval voting](https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/proposals/voting-types). Each delegate can select any number of choices, each selected choice will receive equal voting power. So for example, if a delegate wishes to see the DAO adopt both a disclosure policy and responsible voting, then they should select both options on the Snapshot vote.\n\nSince this is a proposal that changes the DAO’s current status quo, the following choices have been worded in a manner that each “FOR” vote indicates desire to adopt a certain policy.",

      "title": "Strategic Treasury Management on Arbitrum",
      "content": "## Abstract\nThe following proposal evaluates the consensus in the DAO to begin implementing the Arbitrum Strategic Treasury Management Group (ASTMG). \n\nWith DAO support, the ASTMG will be allocated 250M ARB to be managed by karpatkey to achieve long-term sustainability of the Arbitrum DAO and foster Ecosystem growth through transparent and accountable treasury management practices. All funds will be managed using the non-custodial tooling of Zodiac Modules and Aera Vaults. This tooling permits the DAO to retain oversight and ownership of the funds at all times while only allowing specific strategies to be employed by the ASTMG. The costs incurred from this initiative are a 1% management fee on the AUM of the ASTMG and a $180k ARB annual budget to support the DAO Oversight Committee.\n\nKey outcomes supported by voting favourably on this proposal are:\n1. Supporting the allocation of 250 million ARB towards the ASTMG managed by karpatkey.\n2. The DAO Oversight Committee will be established to serve as the accountability and communication layer between the Arbitrum DAO and the ASTMG.\n\n### Full Proposal Description\nPlease review the proposal forum post for a full proposal description: [https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/strategic-treasury-management-on-arbitrum/25301](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/strategic-treasury-management-on-arbitrum/25301)\n\n## Motivation\nArbitrum has 3rd largest treasury of any DAO, but the treasury is unutilised mainly, posing threats to the sustainability and efficient resource allocation of the DAO. Effective treasury management will help the Arbitrum DAO achieve the following three goals:\n\n1. **Ensuring long-term sustainability:** treasury should be able to support ecosystem efforts throughout market cycles; in the long run, DAO should be a self-sustaining vehicle, with expenses covered by yield generated from Treasury, without having to materially compromise on Treasury principal.\n2. **Fostering ecosystem growth:** treasury should be used to foster a vibrant community of users and builders. The DAO should utilise strategies such as protocol-owned liquidity to support sustainable liquidity across the ecosystem.\n3. **Transparency and accountability:** treasury should be expertly managed, and uses of the treasury should be transparent and held accountable to the DAO\n\n## Rationale\nThe ASTMG's overarching objective is to act as the asset allocator for the Arbitrum ecosystem to ensure effective treasury management. This is the crucial first step to ensuring the DAO's sustainability.\n\n## Specifications\nThree main areas of priority for ASTMG would be:\n\n1. **Ecosystem alignment and growth.** Bolster ecosystem growth by utilising Arbitrum's treasury via protocol-owned liquidity (POL) and allow ecosystem grant recipients a swap program to convert ARB into other assets (stables or ETH).\n2. **Fortress balance sheet.** Diversify Arbitrum treasury to build strong runways and resiliency to market downturns by reducing long-tail asset exposure, and ensuring 1-year financial runway.\n3. **Sustainability.** Generating sustainable yields to fund the DAO's operations.\n\nThe priorities would result in the following deliverables:\n- **Yield Optimisation Program:** to generate sustainable yields to fund the DAO's operations in a non-custodial and risk-minimised manner.\n- **DAO Owned Liquidity Program:** to expand ecosystem liquidity, attract builders to Arbitrum, and deepen ARB on-chain liquidity.\n**Treasury Swaps Program:** execute swaps with partner DAO treasuries with guidance from the DAO Oversight Committee.\n- **Treasury Diversification Program:** to reduce long-tail asset exposure and capital raising.\n\nThe DAO Oversight Committee will serve as a layer of checks & balances between the ASTMG and the DAO and will be responsible for:\n 1. Setting of treasury management mandate and guardrails together with ASTMG.\n 2. Ensuring accuracy of reporting and compliance with the mandate.\n 3. Acting as DAO Liaison.\n\nFurther details on platforms and technologies and the design of the ASTMG can be seen in the [full forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/strategic-treasury-management-on-arbitrum/25301?u=karpatkey).\n\n## Steps & Timeline\nThe proposers (karpatkey, Gauntlet) have engaged in extensive discussions with the ArbitrumDAO community. Following the approval of this Snapshot, this proposal will progress to on-chain voting via Tally. It will incorporate feedback received and provide a more in-depth explanation of the execution as needed.\n\n| Stage                              | Timeline       | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| ---------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Snapshot Voting for ASTMG          | August 2024    | Temperature and consensus check.

      "title": "An (EIP-4824 powered) daoURI for the Arbitrum DAO",
      "content": "### Abstract\n\nWe propose that the Arbitrum DAO takes control of its data by publishing a daoURI onchain. The daoURI, following EIP-4824, will create a single source of truth on the DAO, that cannot be altered by external agencies, is fully manageable via governance, bringing helpful context on the DAO onchain. This will be helpful for newcomers, tooling providers, and experienced governooors alike.\n\nDAOstar received a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation to improve the adoption of EIP-4824 in the Arbitrum ecosystem. We are allocating a portion of that grant to steward this proposal. **Adopting EIP-4824 requires no additional spend from the DAO treasury, and it makes no change to its smart contracts or governance structure.**\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO is one of the largest DAOs, and there is a lot of data surrounding it. This dataset grows with every new initiative and has multiple components that may not be very visible from the “outside”. For example, consider the following questions:\n\n1. Who are the current Security Council, Arbitrum Research & Development Collective, Procurement Committee members? (Answer: you can search the respective forum post to find this)\n2. Can you share a location that tracks all DAO-owned/managed multisig addresses? (Answer: this could be https://www.arbwallets.xyz/)\n3. Can you share a status update on the DAO’s grant spending? (Answer: R3gen Finance reports this on the forum)\n4. Where can we see delegate performance? (Answer: KarmaGAP or Tally)\n5. How much in sequencer fees is being collected? (Answer: there is a dashboard for this)\n6. What orbit chains exist? (Answer: the ecosystem page tracks this)\n7. Where to find recordings and transcripts of public meetings? (Answer: I’m not sure!)\n\nFor an active participant, these answers might not be very hard. But for the majority of people who are not active participants of the DAO, and even for tooling providers, collecting this information requires a painstaking amount of manual effort. This leads to inconsistencies, errors and outdated information.\n\nThere are over 200 DAOs at the moment with a treasury size of over $1M, and collecting information on them manually is becoming an exponentially difficult task. EIP-4824 was authored by DAOstar with the support from the Ethereum Foundation, Gnosis, Etherscan, DeepDAO, Snapshot, and a large number of DAO tooling companies, to create a better infrastructure for DAO data.\n\nAdopting EIP-4824 essentially means that the DAO publishes a daoURI onchain. daoURIs have a standard JSON-LD format:\n\n\n```\n{\n\"@context\": \"http://www.daostar.org/schemas\",\n\"type\": \"DAO\",\n\"name\": \"<name of the DAO>\",\n\"description\": \"<description>\",\n\"membersURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\"proposalsURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\"activityLogURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\"governanceURI\": \"<URI>\",\n\"contractsRegistryURI\": \"<URI>\"\n}\n```\n\nIt contains information on governance, members, activities and contracts by default. Outside of the endpoints mentioned above, a DAO can also choose to publish information that is specifically important to it. For Arbitrum, this could be information about orbit chains, different multi-sigs and councils, spending, sequencer fees, link to its constitution, etc. Essentially, **the daoURI creates an “official repository” of information on the DAO.**\n\nHere are some examples of how the daoURI could be used:\n\n1. It can be used to bring more context to contracts on block explorers. For example, we could go from this:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeigtmvyem5lo4vuyy33bac4cqqxd54qejrk5popmitan546oicaxey)\n    \nto this:\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeiacscrrfv5itmx7b53ckjju4qatmldxksobzwdm7eg7xbovm7dhx4)\n    \n2. We can make DAO data easily and freely available to everyone\n\nFor example, Arbitrum DAO’s current DeepDAO profile misses a ton of info - contracts, or revenue, or governance guardrails (councils and multi-sigs), etc. Messari’s Arbitrum DAO dashboard requires a paid membership to access, which could also be due to the difficulty of collecting and presenting DAO data (thus making it too valuable to give away for free). By making access to this information easy, we can greatly improve the DAO’s transparency. i.e, go from: \n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeicfctlylbtxcwbb3rwms4ncpu7ndnlc5lzbuojyeb3hk66xmzwdci)\n    \nto this:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeihgmwshgkkfsnvhlc2ukbzcdpj3dj6hrhx3wmke33zl3kwn5pidvu)\n    \n\n3. daoURI makes it much easier to structure metadata improvements.\n\nA specific example that surfaced during Arbitrum GovHack (*thanks to Paulo Fonseca)*: onchain proposals at Arbitrum DAO (or any DAO for that matter) do not reference a forum discussion. This takes away a lot of available information. If we wanted to change this, we could achieve it easily by enforcing a discussionURI field inside the proposalURI (which is a standard component of daoURI). Tally, Aragon, Snapshot X, and most governance tooling providers are members of DAOstar. Extending the standard will create an easy upgrade pathway for them and this change would reflect the change across the ecosystem.\n\nTo summarize, a daoURI creates a source of truth for metadata, that can represent the present state of the DAO, and is easily accessible for onchain and offchain tools. This proposal carries no additional cost, or changes to any existing smart contract or process. It's a step in the right direction with no downside.\n\n### Specifications\n\nExecution is a simple contract call to the EIP-4824 Registration Factory which deploys a new registration contract that’ll store the daoURI. The registration will be on Arbitrum One network, setting the DAO’s Governor timelock as admin, and managers as the DAO decides.\n\nA DAO that runs the same configuration as Arbitrum DAO and has adopted EIP-4824 is Unlock Protocol. We are adding that transaction here for [reference](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/unlock/proposal/88514909609252335816460489315313822288366112768901791852399180053604763902892), along with successful proposals at [Treasure](https://snapshot.org/#/treasuregaming.eth/proposal/0x957349f6d60f07e95d6e426536996af96ca63f0b9e0495ee8e73554207cb2381) and [1inch](https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0xc25a02d6520fd69ae98ef10b72f3024db2e710d00d51fbc7c03581710e0b8b7b) that were executed through their respective treasury safes.\n\n### Timeline\n\nCreation of daoURI V0.1 (includes conversations with delegates, service providers, the Arbitrum Foundation, and all other participants through the forum, led by DAOstar): 4 weeks\n\nTesting (ensuring that the subURIs work well & that any static data is either uploaded to IPFS or hosted by a trusted 3rd party, for example the Arbitrum Foundation): 2 weeks\n\nOverall: 6 weeks before the proposal is ready to be executed\n\n### Overall Cost\n\nThis proposal does not require any transfer of funds from the DAO treasury.\n\n*Special thanks to @Bobbay, @Matt_StableLab, @raam, @coolhorsegirl, @Srijith-Questbook, @Sinkas, Hayden (BlockworksResearch) and Nick Nahaghi (Hats) for feedback and edits; @krst, @AlexLumley, @Frisson, @dk3, and George Beall (Gauntlet) for the expert sessions, and to Klaus and the rest of the GovHack team for making an awesome event happen at Brussels!*\n\n*EIP-4824 has already been adopted by Snapshot, Aragon, Treasure, 1inch, Optimism Collective (through the Optimism Foundation), and multiple frameworks and DAOs.

      "content": "Non-Constitutional (not even a proposal yet, just a temp check)\n\n# Should we explore an offsite?\n\n## The Problem\n\nWe’re missing structured platforms for delegates and key stakeholders to engage deeply and collaboratively on key topics around DAO strategy and organisation design, leading to bottlenecks and slow and painful decision-making.\n\n## Solution\n\nOver a few informal conversations during EthCC, I got positive sentiment around the idea of organizing an Offsite for delegates, key stakeholders, and high-context DAO members.\n\nBut many questions need to be addressed:\n\n- What’s the specific agenda? (what do we include/exclude? discuss current initiatives or only big-picture stuff e.g. strategy, org design? single track or multi-track? etc.)\n- when should this happen?\n- how long should it last?\n- Who facilitates it?\n- What’s the location (online/offline, which platform/venue)\n- Budget\n- etc etc.\n\nAnswering those questions will require engagement from the top delegates and project management work to take this from a loose idea to a refined proposal.\n\nSo before we commit to discussing the details, this temperature check aims to confirm whether delegates believe:\n\n- an Offsite proposal is something that should be explored\n- or we should shelve the idea, avoid wasting everyone’s time and focus on something else.\n\n# IMPORTANT\n\nThis proposal is about polling whether top delegates are interested in the initiative. Unless we get the majority of top delegates voting that they will get involved in shaping this initiative, we’re dropping it.\n\nA vote in favour of this proposal does NOT mean an offsite should be executed. A vote in favour will NOT result in a Tally proposal being the next step. A vote in favour only means an offsite should be EXPLORED through conversations with top delegates and key stakeholders.\n\nIf this proposal receives significant support from the majority of top delegates: we’ll have a series of calls (group and 1-1) with the delegates and launch a couple of polls to agree on the details of the Offsite. And only then, we’ll draft a proposal with the details.",

      "title": "Proposal to Temporary Extend Delegate Incentive System.",
      "content": "### Abstract\n\nWe would like to introduce a temporary extension of the current Delegate Incentive System for up to two months.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSEEDGov is working on the v1.1 of the Delegate Incentive System. This new version will try to implement significant changes that we believe are going to improve the actual version of the system.\n\nConsidering that the actual program concludes on August 31, that the following iteration will probably need more than one week of discussion, and that we adapt to the recent approved [DAO Calendar](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x249a8e8aef5dc59da18b72e7d14ace5197ec6242675ab7f82b3d3f17f71bb13b), we are presenting a temporary extension of the program with the objective of not interrupting delegates incentives while v1.1 is being discussed.\n\n### Rationale\n\nApproved Delegate Incentive System has proved to be cost-efficient. To date, 1,1 million ARBs are still in the DIS multisig out of a total of 1.58M initially transferred.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifai7old2hjql4pdjats5fgpy5zhqi6lvoipbd6twrekvg647pmqu)\n    \nNote I: *Special thanks to our frens [@r3gen_Finance](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/r3gen_finance/summary) for an early delivery of their Arbitrum Token Flow Report. The Full Flow Report will be published soon.*\n\nNote II: *Data as of July 31, 2024*.\n\nWith the objective of maintaining the delegates engaged and incentivized while v1.1 of the system is discussed, we propose to extend the current one for a period up to two months.\n\nThis proposal will be attached to the new Delegate Incentive System. If the new version of the system is approved before the temporary extension ends, this version will be deprecated to make way for v1.1 of the System.\n\n### Costs:\n\nAs an important clarification, cost structures won’t be changed during this temporary extension. Funds will come from the [Delegate Incentive System Multisig](https://www.arbwallets.xyz/).\n\n- Monthly Delegates Incentives: TBD (Average Monthly ARB incentives: 108,7k)\n- Karma Administration Costs: 3750 ARB per month.\n- SEEDGov Administration Costs: 3.333 ARB per month.\n- Multisig Administration Costs: 5.000 ARB per month.\n\nNote: *We know that costs are out of date. In order to smooth the process we’ll keep the same operational costs until the release of Delegate Incentive System v1.1*",

      "title": "Should the DAO Default to using Shielded Voting for Snapshot Votes?",
      "content": "This is a temperature check to gauge the DAO's overall opinion on using Shielded Voting. No social contract, guidelines, or policy will be adopted directly from the result of this vote.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to kickstart a conversation around the adoption of Shutter’s shielded voting as a default for Snapshot temperature checks. Shielded voting encrypts votes during the voting period and decrypts them only after the vote closes, mitigating bandwagon effects, voter apathy, and last-minute strategic voting. A Snapshot vote to gauge the DAO's sentiment will be posted on **Thursday, August 8th**. Please note, this is an actual temperature check, just to gauge the DAO’s opinion on the subject.\n\n## Background\n\nShutter’s shielded voting differs slightly from a traditional [secret ballot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_ballot) where voter’s identity and selection are kept anonymous. In this case, votes are encrypted during the voting period and are decrypted only after the vote closes. Put more simply, during the voting process, a voter’s position is private, and after the vote, positions are made public. You can see who voted, but not their choice or the total VP per option, until the poll has closed (to clarify any confusion please see the demo linked below). Shutter’s shielded voting on Snapshot has been live for over 2 years now and additional details about the implementation can be found on their [blog](https://blog.shutter.network/announcing-shutter-governance-shielded-voting-for-daos/). A live demo of shielded voting can be found on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/pistachiodao.eth/proposal/0xa5077ef17097b1d59304b110337bd1c7ce98d95d3ff81d138c3886a80074b4d9).\n\nOther DAOs have run experiments with shielded voting in the past. Results from a 2-month trail period in Aave DAO can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-private-voting-for-aave-governance-2-month-trial/12730/31). It is important to note that the majority of Aave DAO's proposals are related to protocols parameters, which require more specific knowledge sets on risk & economics. Therefore, it's not immediately clear how directly the results from Aave DAO can be compared to Arbitrum DAO. \n\n## Rationale\n\nIn the 19th century, most western democracies transitioned from public to private voting methods in elections primarily to reduce voter coercion. While voter coercion is not a widespread issue in the onchain governance space, public votes are susceptible to a few other negative phenomenons:\n\n* **Bandwagon Effect:** Voters without a strong opinion tend to go with the current majority opinion. With shielded voting, no one can see how the vote is progressing, thus preventing delegates from being persuaded simply by popular choice.\n\n* **Voter Apathy:** On the flipside, when those in a minority opinion see that their vote no longer impacts the results of either an election or decisions, they may choose not to vote at all. This can be due to feelings that their vote doesn't matter or that strategically it is not worth the social capital to publicly dissent against the majority.\n\n* **11th Hour Voting:** With public voting there is an inherent information mismatch, as the last voter has much more available information to act on than the first voter. Currently, there is a strong incentive to wait until the last possible minute to vote. In some instances this is benevolent behavior as large delegates may not want to indirectly create a bandwagon effect, but other times it can be seen as borderline misbehavior when a late vote is used to strategically create an outcome.\n\nTo clarify, we are not arguing that Arbitrum DAO is currently suffering from these effects, but they are each possible with the current public system. There are also downsides to private voting that we'd like to highlight:\n\n* Overall participation may go down if smaller delegates feel like their positions are no longer impactful, as public voting gives those delegates a chance to strongly voice their opinions by voting early. \n* Politically savvy parties who have the ability or connections to coordinate now have an even bigger advantage.\n* Those who choose to publicly signal their positions gain an advantage over a silent opposition, as some delegate may hold a firm position on silence until the vote concludes. \n* Delegates that know how the votes are falling due to backdoor channels can potentially then use residual votes strategically. With public voting methods, this is something that most everyone can do with less effort and connections. \n\nIn general though, Shutter’s shielded voting allows Arbitrum DAO to remain consistent with practice in liberal democracies that votes taken by elected officials (delegates in this case) are publicized so that citizens can judge voting records. Since it addresses many of the aforementioned concerns with public voting methods, Entropy felt it was a worthwhile conversation to bring to the DAO.\n\n## Specifications\n\nGiven there are some advantages in certain scenarios to private votes for temperature checks, Entropy Advisors is kickstarting this conversation by posing the following question:\n\n**Should Arbitrum DAO default to using shielded voting for Snapshot votes?**\n\nThere will be 4 Voting Choices:\n\n* For all Snapshot Votes\n* For Elections Only\n* Against\n* Abstain\n\nIt is our recommendation that proposal authors still be granted the ability to include reasoning for if a vote should be public instead of shielded. If properly justified, we see no reason to force all Snapshot votes to be shielded (at the DAO’s discretion).\n\n## Timeline\n\nA Snapshot poll will be posted on **August 8th** to gauge the DAO’s overall sentiment and allow for ample conversation beforehand.\n\nAdditional proposals to follow will include temperature checks for COI policy, delegate code of conduct, and other ideas to improve the DAO’s operational processes. If the vote passes, shielded voting will be incorporated along with the other aforementioned ideas that pass a temp check into a larger proposal. This proposal will look to codify all of the DAO’s new processes into a socially enforceable proposal. After a trial period of the more grandiose unified proposal around DAO Operations, we hope to eventually implement the ideas that have worked best into the Constitution.\n\nIt is important to note, that delegates are already free to post shielded votes. In the case that shielded voting is favored by the DAO, more shielded votes are encouraged while this larger proposal is being worked on.\n\n## Cost\n\nThere is no cost to the DAO as shielded voting is already available to all DAOs on Snapshot.",

      "title": "Arbitrum Multi-sig Support Service (MSS) ",
      "content": "#### [](#final-version-jul-24-1)\n\n## [](#abstract-6)Abstract\n\nWe propose creating a structured multi-sig framework to facilitate funded programs within Arbitrum DAO to reduce operational spend and increase proposal efficiency.\n\nAs of April 2024, the DAO administers six programs with a designated budget for multi-sig signing. The aggregate budgeted cost across these programs for signers stands at 158,000 ARB, with an annualized total expenditure, based on estimations, of 470,000 ARB or $627,840 at an ARB price of $1.34. This is a high cost for the DAO to pay on a purely operational function, especially **considering that these operational costs will likely rise as more programs are funded.**\n\nWe propose creating a “Multi-sig Support Service” (MSS) to unlock significant cost-saving opportunities, lessen committee fragmentation, ensure signers are competent with multi-sigs, and reduce friction for contributors creating proposals. The MSS will comprise 12 elected individuals to all DAO-funded multi-sigs. They will be compensated a base USD amount, paid in ARB, for performing these services across the DAO.\n\nThis proposal also funds the implementation of r3gen monthly Token Flow reporting on inflows (revenue) and outflows (spend) across the DAO as well as providing detailed information and analysis on spending from MSS multisigs. Together, this proposal will help create a “backroom finance” function within the DAO that can be used across different initiatives.\n\nThe proposed changes offer the potential to generate substantial cost savings, estimated to be ~$315,000 per annum, while increasing efficiency, transparency, and security of DAO spending.\n\n## [](#motivation-7)Motivation\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO oversees six programs which pay multi-sig signers. Each multi-sig typically has five signers, except for the STIP and STIP backfund programs, which share the same multi-sig and have nine signers budgeted for. The table below outlines these programs, including the amount funded, duration (in months), and annualized figures to project a forecasted amount if future programs were to continue in the same manner.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the programs:\n\n![Screen Shot 2024-05-09 at 9.46.01 AM](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a1925dca79751f14d98c48c57e2ec75724477024_2_689x263.png)\n\nThe analysis underscores the operational unsustainability of the current expenditure level, with an annualised cost totalling $627,840 USD based on the average ARB price of $1.34 between August 7, 2023 and April 30, 2024, the period starting when Arbitrum DAO’s first multisig was funded.\n\nThe cost per transaction appears excessive when comparing these figures against the volume of unique transactions sent from each multi-sig. While analysis for all multi-sig wallets is included for completeness, the STIP/Backfund multi-sig provides the clearest picture of the “cost per transaction” due to its proximity to completion.\n\nThis analysis highlights the urgent need for restructuring and cost optimization within the Arbitrum DAO to ensure financial sustainability and operational efficiency in the long term.\n\n![UTS](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/156546d1b6203ce34e9709e776e036b256eccf66_2_689x226.png)\n\n![AS CpT](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/e/ee4a2ffb53385d749fedb8b2d0a60b72cc953b31_2_690x253.png)\n\nIt is also worth highlighting that the current structure has individuals appearing across multiple different multi-sigs, drawing income from each.![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/33edd4495f7403e4068e021ede9ddd77c551afe5_2_602x343.png)\n\nCurrently, the DAO experiences a significant dispersion in its structure, where each funded program operates its own multi-sig. This fragmentation not only leads to redundancy but also elevates the overall cost of operations. Through the “Multi-sig Support Service” (MSS), we can eliminate these inefficiencies and significantly reduce unnecessary expenditure.\n\nAdditionally, individuals on multi-sigs are generally not elected, posing a challenge in consistently ensuring that only the most trusted and competent members manage these critical roles. By shifting to an elected model within the MSS, we can enhance transparency, accountability, and professionalism, ensuring that every signer meets a high standard of trust and competency.\n\nFinally, contributors currently face friction in advancing proposals due to the need to wrangle signers, which can delay or deter the proposal process. The MSS aims to streamline this process by providing a reliable and consistent team of signers to be included in proposals, thereby reducing the time and effort of contributors, and accelerating the pace at which the DAO can execute its initiatives.\n\nBy creating a structured multisig committee, process, and reporting cadence around spending, the DAO will be better equipped to service its plethora of proposals that require payments and maintain transparency around the programs.\n\n## [](#proposed-solution-8)Proposed solution\n\nThe proposed framework for the Arbitrum DAO aims to address these issues by:\n\n1. Arbitrum DAO elects 12 signers via Snapshot weighted voting, shielded with Shutter\n   * Signers, when submitting their application to join the MSS, may opt in to be an MSS Chair, who will be responsible for communicating to the DAO on the MSS’s behalf. The three opted-in signers with the highest weight according to Snapshot will be allocated MSS Chairs.\n2. For each new DAO initiative requiring a multisig, a new 12 signer multisig is set up.\n   * The signing threshold will be dependent on the total dollar denominated value of the wallet\n     i. 6/12: <$1M\n     ii. 7/12: $1M-$5M\n     iii. 8/12: $5M-$10m\n     iiii. 9/12 $10M-$50M\n3. Signers are paid a fixed monthly fee of $1500 in ARB using spot price at the time of payment. The MSS Chairs will be paid $2500 per month in ARB using the spot price.\n   * We feel denominating the payment in a $ value is important to ensure the DAO pays a fair price for service rendered without the risk of ARB price movement leading to a series of overpayment or underpayment to signers for their duty.\n4. This will be paid out monthly from the MSS multi-sig, which will be a 6/12 including the entirety of the MSS.\n   * Payment for multisig signers will only start once the first new multisig is onboarded under the Multisig Support Service MSS structure.\n   * Existing multi-sigs have the option to “opt in” to the MSS structure. If they do so any existing ring-fenced budget for multisig signing should be sent directly to a new MSS multisig. An MSS Chair will coordinate with the Program to manage the transition process. We expect a gradual turnover given the incentives at play and that most multi-sigs will not opt into the transition process.\n5. The same process is repeated to onboard new MSS members 12 months after the first is complete (starting the process 4 months before the term is up to allow for ample time)\n\n**The funds in the multisigs belong to the DAO and the signers act as grant managers on behalf of the DAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation.**\n\nWe suggest the program is capped at initiatives seeking funding of $50M or less. This will help ensure that the program is not bottlenecked by one single initiative. For programs seeking more than $50M in funding, we suggest inspiration in design be taken from this model while creating a dedicated multisig committee and process.\n\n## [](#mss-mechanics-9)MSS Mechanics\n\n#### [](#who-would-be-a-suitable-multi-sig-signer-10)Who would be a suitable multi-sig signer?\n\n* Actively involved in the Arbitrum ecosystem\n* Prior experience being on multi-sigs. Understanding of batched transactions and transaction builder.\n  * All multi-sig signers will also undergo training on security best practices and multisig efficacy at the commencement of their role. This training will be completed by Entropy Advisors.\n* Able to complete KYC\n  * The Arbitrum Foundation will conduct KYC on all multisig signers to ensure they are compliant and can serve this role for the DAO.\n* Organisation or professional signers can submit a nomination to be a multi-sig signer. Only one member per organisation.\n  * If nominating an organisation, one member of the company should be listed as the primary point of contact.\n\n#### [](#creating-new-mss-multisigs-11)Creating new MSS multisigs\n\nThe process flow for creating new multisigs is as follows\n\n* Snapshot vote passes\n* Multisig is created by MSS Chair and signers onboard. The 3 chairs will rotate multisig creation responsibility\n* Proposal passes Tally\n* Vaults must be named well to help with organisation\n\n#### [](#processing-payments-through-mss-multisigs-12)Processing payments through MSS multisigs\n\nTo improve security and clarity of payments running through MSS multi-sigs, the following financial controls processes will be maintained:\n\n**Payment request: approval flow**\n\nAt the outset programs using the MSS will define their payment approval flow, including\n\n1. Which individuals can request a payment be made “payment requestor”\n2. Which channel do they need to request it on “payment request channel”\n3. Who else is required to approve it, triggering the payment to be queued via the multisig “payment approver”\n4. A list of approved wallet addresses (maintained in On-chain Den)\n\nThis is an important security step to mitigate the risk that a Program member’s personal accounts will be compromised and used to trigger a payment by the multisig to an unintended party. (i.e. hack someone’s Telegram and tell the grants program to queue a payment up to the hacker’s wallet).\n\nAn example of this structure\n\n1. Disruption Joe, Shawn and Ben can request a msig payment.\n2. Request made in “PL Payment” Telegram group”\n3. Supporting evidence of the payment will need to be produced to be reviewed by the signers (a forum post, an invoice, a milestone sign off etc)\n4. One written approval as indicated by “![:+1:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/+1.png?v=12 \":+1:\")” on the payment message required from Joe, Shawn or Ben. “payment approver” cannot also be by “payment requestor”\n\nGiven the abstraction of responsibility from multisig signers and program operators, this step is important to ensure the security and integrity of fund transfers.\n\n**Payment request: format**\n\nPayment requests should be structured as follows by the “payment requestor”\n\nName of supplier | Category | nature of the payment | supporting evidence\n\nThis will allow for multisig approvers to better understand the details of the payment they are being asked to process. Moreover, by ensuring clear supplier name and categorization a more efficient reporting flow can be maintained. The category of payment is to be defined by the program itself (i.e. “Tooling”, “Contributor payment”, “legal fees”). If the DAO wishes to move ahead with Token Flow reporting, r3gen finance will also conduct discovery with each program team to help them define and confirm program reporting categorization at the outset of their program.\n\n#### [](#payment-signing-den-implementation-13)Payment signing: Den implementation\n\n* To aid in the efficiency and security of multisig programs at Arbitrum, we propose the implementation of [Den](https://www.onchainden.com/) across all MSS multisigs.\n  * Efficiency: Den will automatically notify Arbitrum multisig signers when there is a transaction to sign. It will allow them to see exactly what you’re signing at a glance and cut through the noise by auto-tagging and DMing signers\n  * Security: Den helps you know what you’re executing and identify malicious transactions. It allows Arbitrum multisig signers to: Simulate and decode transactions before they execute them and see the outcomes of transactions before they are signed. It also helps signers easily understand complex transaction inputs and automatically see what’s behind any address.\n\n#### [](#conflict-of-interest-policy-14)**Conflict of Interest Policy**\n\nIn order to maintain the integrity and impartiality of the MSS, signers must adhere to a strict Conflict of Interest Policy. This policy ensures that all decisions made by MSS signers are in the best interest of the DAO and free from personal gain or undue influence.\n\nA conflict of interest occurs when an individual’s personal interests interfere, or appear to interfere, with their responsibilities to the DAO. Conflicts of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n1. Being directly compensated by the Multi-sig: Receiving payments, reimbursements, or any form of financial benefit directly from the multi-sig for which the signer is responsible (Exclusion for the MSS multisig itself which will be paying it’s signers directly for their services)\n2. Authoring a Proposal that Funded the Multi-sig: Proposals a signer has authored or co-authored, which directly results in funding or operational changes to the multi-sig.\n3. Personal or Financial Relationships: Having financial relationships with any parties that stand to benefit directly from the signer’s decisions in relation to the multi-sig operations.\n4. Other Conflicts: Any other circumstances where the signer’s ability to act in the best interest of the DAO may be compromised.\n\nProcedure in the Event of a Conflict: If a conflict of interest arises, or if a situation arises that could be perceived as a conflict, the signer must:\n\n* Provide Disclosure: Promptly disclose the conflict to the other members of the multi-sig committee.\n* Recusal: Abstain from participating in discussions and decision-making processes related to the conflict.\n* Reduced Signer Multisig: In the scenario that there is a situation deemed a COI, a multisig should be created without this signer(s) included. A new threshold >50% of the total remaining signers should be included. For example, if there are 3 signers with a COI for an initiative, the new multisig for this initiative would maintain 5/9 threshold and total signers.\n\nAll COI executions must be documented by an MSS Chair and communicated to the DAO in a forum thread dedicated to MSS operations.\n\n#### [](#removal-of-mss-members-15)**Removal of MSS members**\n\nThere are 2 paths to the removal of an MSS member:\n\n1. DAO Snapshot: Any DAO member can propose a Snapshot vote to remove an MSS signer. The proposal should clearly state the reasons for removal and provide evidence supporting the claims. A simple majority of votes cast by the DAO members is required for the removal to be approved with an 80M ARB Quorum (defined as total ARB votes).\n2. MSS Member Agreement: If at least 8 MSS members (8 out of 12 members) agree that a signer should be removed due to breach of duties or conflict of interest, they can initiate the removal process internally. The agreement must be documented and publicly disclosed to maintain transparency. Analytics on signer activity from Den may be used as supporting evidence.\n\nIf a member is removed via the DAO Snapshot or MSS Member Agreement the member will immediately lose further compensation. Once a member is removed, the following steps will be taken to ensure continuity and maintain the governance structure:\n\n* Interim Measures: The MSS may appoint an interim member to serve temporarily until a new member is officially elected. The 3 chairs will collaborate and decide how to select the new member.\n* Subsequent Snapshot: A subsequent Snapshot vote will be held to elect a new MSS member. This ensures that the DAO participates in selecting a new signer, maintaining democratic and transparent governance.\n\nAll removal proceedings, details around the new signer, and the reasons for the removal must be documented by an MSS Chair and communicated to the DAO in a forum thread dedicated to MSS operations.\n\n#### [](#expectations-of-mss-members-16)**Expectations of MSS members**\n\nTransactions are expected to be promptly (within 24 hours) reviewed by all signers, and if approved through the process outlined above, signed. While we realise that there will be times when a signer may not have internet access or some other deterrent to signing, these are expected to be few and far between. If there are more than 3 lapses in expectations over the course of a 2 month period, chairs are expected to communicate that to the DAO and potentially remove the signer.\n\n#### [](#clawback-capability-17)**Clawback Capability**&#xA;\n\n*We are in the process of implementing Zodiac Governor Module in the first multisig to so that the DAO has the ability to clawback funds and replace multisig members. Please note that the Zodiac Governor Module is an imperfect mechanism because it requires a DAO proposal to execute changes, and multisig signers can move faster than the DAO.*\n\nFor future multisigs, we believe each multisig should be set up with the DAO maintaining the ability to clawback funds. In order to execute this, multisigs should be set up using the same model as the security council, by making upgradeexecutor as a module so that DAO maintains full authoritative power.\n<https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/06039ce92be07d448838e4ab1e2e29c3985356f0/src/security-council-mgmt/SecurityCouncilMemberSyncAction.sol#L76-L95>\n\nWe believe this same mechanism can be used to transfer ownership of the multisigs to new members when new elections take place in 12 months. *This might require a slight technical change,  we are awaiting confirmation from the Foundation.*\n\n## [](#token-flow-reporting-18)Token Flow Reporting\n\n#### [](#r3gen-reporting-on-token-flow-19)r3gen Reporting on Token Flow\n\n**Token Flow | Scope**\nTo aid in the transparency and clarity of reporting within the DAO, we are also proposing the publication of a monthly “Token Flow Report,” which will include illustrate expenditure amounts and breakdowns for all Arbitrum MSS-managed multisigs. In addition, r3gen finance will provide insights on inflows from Sequencer Flows and a high-level summary of other direct outflows from the Arbitrum Treasury to programs not coordinated under the MSS framework.\n\nThis approach will synergise with the operational execution created by the MSS to provide holistic insights into expenditures and the movement of Token in/out of the Treasury. Moreover, it will reduce the finance-admin burden on individual programs, relieving them of the need to track, draft, and publish exhaustive financial updates themselves whilst also providing the DAO with a clear mechanism to ensure spending within the organisation is consistent with the structure outlined within each proposal.\n\nWithin this role, r3gen finance will also lead the development of deeper financial insights and be open to requests by delegates and the community for further specific analysis. This can be requested either via a google form or by commenting directly on the report in the forum. Ultimately, this will enable the DAO to have, at it’s fingertips, the detailed financial insights it needs to support decision-making.\n\nWith the inclusion of Token Flow Reporting, the DAO can unlock the next layer of accounting and reporting on top of the MSS and together creates a holistic backroom finance function to provide the DAO with much-needed data around spending. This will enhance the DAO’s transparency, accountability, and impact.\n\nWe encourage you to review the [first iteration of the Token Flow report](https://online.flippingbook.com/view/939461097/) to get a sense of its design.\n\nMoving forward, financial items within the report will include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Transaction fees, split between the various components of the fee\n  * L1 base, L1 surplus, L2 base, L2 surplus fees\n  * Fee inflows into DAO-controlled wallets\n* Sequencer fees (L1 base fee)\n  * Fee outflows into the sequencer’s wallet\n* Treasury holdings, including the breakdown of treasury allocation to various underlying tokens\n* Forward-looking spending estimations based on active proposals\n* Runway scenario forecasting based on historical/projected spend\n* DAO expenditure by:\n  * Category (such as user incentives, direct grants, grant programs etc.)\n  * Program (such as STIP, LTIP etc.)\n  * Function (such as committee members, advisors etc.)\n* Comparison of total proposed spend vs. actual spend to date for each major DAO-funded initiative, split between each function within the program where possible\n* Contributor Spending Analysis\n* Multisig Spend Analysis\n* Detailed Statement of Token Flows in each of the major tokens the DAO operates in, highlighting\n  * The starting token balance\n  * Inflows of the token (“income”)\n  * Outflows of the token (“expenditure”)\n  * Closing token position\n\nThis report is just the starting point. With community feedback, we will continue to develop and iterate on the monthly token flow report to provide deeper insights and analysis of what the community wants to see. This team will host a monthly finance call on the public calendar to discuss the report’s outputs and collect community feedback to inform the next iteration.\n\nIf you have any specific feedback you would like to see reflected in the report we encourage you to reach out to Pepperoni\\_Jo3 or Jono\\_Gibbs on Telegram.\n\n**Token Flow | Team**\n\nToken Flow Reporting at Arbitrum DAO will be coordinated by a team of four (Elliott, Jono, Matthew and Pepperoni Joe) who bring professional “Big Four” expertise and extensive experience working across top web3 protocols, including Swell, Aave, Gitcoin, Index Coop, Inverse Finance, Squid, Vote Agora, Enzyme, Treasure.\n\n**Token Flow | Pricing for Token Flow Report:**\n\n$6650 USD per month paid upfront in ARB on the 1st of the month using USD/ARB spot price. This includes the web3 accounting sub-ledgers fee and other monthly tooling costs (approximately $750). Work has been ongoing since June to prepare the first Token Flow Reporting which will be published in August, covering the DAO’s finances from Genesis to July 2024. The full monthly payment for August will be paid on the 1st of August, OR when the Tally vote is successfully passed and multi-sig set up to receive funds, whichever is latest. Work done to prepare the report through June and July will not be billed; that will be free on us (r3gen) for the DAO.\n\n### [](#estimated-savings-20)Estimated Savings\n\n**Current Structure**\n\nProject forward estimated multisig cost for the DAO is a challenge, but assuming multisig costs project in line with historical, some future scenarios of yearly cost are displayed below:\n\n![Screen Shot 2024-05-09 at 10.33.48 AM](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/c/cdbcff5a6e9542b2bd21661eeeb7de9f1dff8ae0_2_690x191.png)\n\n\\*assuming ARB allocation cost per multi-sig breakdown as aligned with historic\n\nCurrent spend on multisig with Arbitrum DAO is high, and spending could increase significantly if the number of new multisigs or ARB price increases significantly. This indicates that implementing this proposal would be of significant financial benefit to the Arbitrum DAO.\n\n**Proposed Structure**\nFor implementation of all aspects of this proposal, we estimate the structure will incur a cost of $313,800 per year.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/e2359ae9-327b-4203-9439-23789f17f6ce_original.png)\n\n[](#budget-21)**Budget**\n\nWe propose an allocation of 600,000 ARB to fund an approximately 1+ year multi-sig budget for the DAO. As compensation is denominated in $, but paid in ARB, the specific duration that this budget will fund signers cannot be accurately determined. Assuming the program succeeds, a renewal proposal will be drafted to top up this budget to fund continued signer payments. This will be done in parallel to a reelection process of signers performing this function.\n\n### [](#timeline-22)",

      "content": "![image](ipfs://bafybeigh7ndoyzpg3xsktbfdjpvzba2syahbbixzlr2bek5mo4jxc3qgm4)\n\nPlease review the proposal forum post for a full proposal description: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arb-staking-unlock-arb-utility-and-align-governance/25084/1\n \n### Abstract\n\nWe propose the development of an ArbitrumDAO Governance Analytics Dashboard to support ongoing governance initiatives, enhance transparency, and provide comprehensive insights into governance data. The dashboard aims to track voting behavior, safeguard against potential governance attacks, and measure the success of initiatives like Redelegation Week. We are seeking comments and support from the Arbitrum community to develop this analytic dashboard.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe Arbitrum community needs a robust, user-friendly tool to simplify the understanding of complex governance dynamics, track the effectiveness of initiatives, and ensure transparency and accountability. This dashboard will foster inclusive, data-driven decision-making, enhancing community governance effectiveness.\n\n**Differentiation from Existing Solutions:**\n\nOur Arbitrum Governance Analytics Dashboard aims to fill the gaps in existing platforms by providing more detailed metrics for enhanced understanding and transparency:\n\n**1. Concentration of Voting Power Metrics**: Our dashboard sheds light on the distribution of voting power among small and large holders, their engagement in delegation, and the source of delegates’ voting power. It identifies potential centralization of power and offers insights into each delegate’s influence.\n\n**2. Proposal Metrics**: We offer a detailed view of proposal activities, including the ratio of unique proposers to total proposals and the distribution by type. We classify proposal results as contentious, generally accepted, or normal to help stakeholders understand voting dynamics.\n\n**3. Participation Metrics**: Our focus is on delivering granular metrics on the participation of small and large holders. This comprehensive analysis identifies underrepresented groups and informs strategies for more balanced and inclusive participation.\n\nOur dashboard is an analytical tool designed to provide a comprehensive view of Arbitrum’s governance process, highlighting underrepresented holders or delegates and the overall power structure. We are committed to iterative development, refining our dashboard based on community feedback to ensure it remains valuable and relevant for all stakeholders.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis proposal aligns with the Arbitrum community's mission and guiding values by enhancing transparency, promoting data-driven decision-making, and supporting the effectiveness of governance processes. By providing near real-time monitoring and detailed analytics, the dashboard will help the community make informed decisions and maintain a secure governance framework.\n\n### Example Uses of the Dashboard\n\n1. Redelegation Week Success Tracking\n\nTo ensure the success of the Redelegation Week program, our dashboard will monitor delegate change in their voting power and track the overall votable supply.This user-friendly interface will display the number of delegates joining and the increase in delegations, providing clear insights into the program's success.\n\n2. Optimizing Voting Schedule\n\nOur dashboard will help optimize the voting schedule by identifying periods when delegates are most active. By aligning voting schedules with peak voting activity, we can support the predictability proposal from Entropy, adjusting dates based on these insights to enhance participation and predictability.\n\n3. Safeguarding from Potential Governance Attacks\n\nTo safeguard against potential governance attacks, our dashboard will help monitor unusual delegation behavior, such as sudden changes in delegate voting power into their respective delegate’s voting activity for certain proposals, helping to maintain a secure and robust governance framework.\n\n4. Supporting Tools for Current and Future Delegate Incentive Programs\n\nOur dashboard will complement the auditing of the Delegate Incentive program's results. By providing comprehensive analytics and near real-time delegate participation tracking, it ensures transparency and accountability, allowing for accurate assessment and evaluation of the program's effectiveness.\n\n### Steps to Implement\n\n**1. Research & Ideation:**\n\n* We started by identifying the metrics and gather community feedbacks\n\n**2. Design & Mockups:**\n\n* Based on our research, we created initial design mockups focusing on user experience and the presentation of key metrics. These were shared with the community for initial feedback.\n\n**3. Development Phase 1:**\n\n* We developed a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) featuring basic holder metrics and concentration of voting power metrics. This was released as a mid-development preview to gather community feedback.\n\n**4. Development Phase 2:**\n\n* We integrated additional metrics based on community feedback, including more detailed proposal and participation metrics.\n\n**5. Testing & Iteration:**\n\n* The dashboard underwent multiple rounds of testing for functionality, usability, and data accuracy. We also made iterative improvements based on ongoing community feedback.\n\n**6. Launch & Maintenance:**\n\n* After final testing and refinements, the dashboard was officially launched. We have committed to maintaining it, including daily updates and feature iterations based on community needs.\n\n**7. Monthly Report:**\n\n* Release of monthly governance analytics report\n\n### Timeline\n![image](ipfs://bafybeibv45upfeajnrktntnf4fj6u3j2llfefayksjnqrjlu74gfhw34uq)\n\n## Budget Request (6 months)\n\n### Governance Dashboard (40,000 USD)\n\n* Infrastructure Costs: This includes all the foundational services needed to support the dashboard’s operation.\n\n* Maintenance and Operational Costs: These are ongoing costs required to keep the service up-to-date and running smoothly.\n\n* Data Management Costs: Expenses related to handling and storing the data used by the dashboard.\n\n* Third-Party Services: Costs for services provided by external entities that enhance the functionality of the dashboard.\n\n* Overhead Costs: General administrative and operational expenses not directly tied to specific technical resources.\n\n### Monthly Report (10,000 USD)\n\n* Data Interpretation and Analysis: Simplify complex metrics into clear insights and identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.\n\n* Focus on Key Governance Metrics: Voting patterns, voter performance, proposal outcomes, and voting power shifts.\n\n* Actionable Insights: Provide recommendations for increased participation and governance improvements.\n\n* Customized Content: Tailor reports to community interests and feedback.\n\nExample of our report from SafeDAO: [SafeDAO Governance Analytics Report Thread](https://forum.safe.global/t/safedao-governance-analytics-report-thread/5283)\n\n### Overall Cost\n\n* The total requested budget is **50,000 USD**, with **40,000 USD allocated for the Governance Dashboard and 10,000 USD for the 6 months** of report generation and maintenance.\n(**The amount will be paid denominated in 71,000 ARB (at the current ARB price of $0.70**)\n\n### Team\nCuria Lab: Our team brings extensive expertise in research, data analysis, and experience in DAO and decentralized governance. We have actively served as delegates in multiple DAOs, deeply engaging in governance, data analysis, and operational activities. We have built governance data-driven tools for notable projects like the Optimism Collective ([Optimism Dashboard](https://optimism.curiahub.xyz/participation)) and SafeDAO ([SafeDAO Dashboard](https://safedao.curiahub.xyz/)) and are keen on developing similar tools for ArbitrumDAO as well.\n\n### Contact Information\n* Twitter:[ Curia ](https://twitter.com/Curia_Gov)\n* Telegram: @v3dao, @englandkiiz\n* Email: varit@curialab.xyz\n* Website:[ Curia Hub](https://curialab.xyz)",

      "title": "Transparency and Standardized Metrics for Orbit Chains",
      "content": "Full title: [Non-Constitutional] Transparency and Standardized Metrics for Orbit Chains  on growthepie.xyz Allowing Data-Driven Decision Making\n\nPlease review the proposal forum post for a full proposal description: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arb-staking-unlock-arb-utility-and-align-governance/25084/1\n\n### Abstract\n\nWe want to increase the transparency into the Orbit stack by aggregating important metrics on a chain level so that users, builders, and DAO members can make better data-driven decisions, including what revenue an Orbit chain generates. This allows to plan much better, for example around an Orbit liquidity plan or other discussions around Orbit chains and their current/future support, or even retroactive programs (through better historic and comparable data points). \n\nThere is high likelyhood that the DAO will want to run an incentive program for Orbit Chains in the future. By having the data ready to go, we can avoid having a short-term program proposal which bootstraps data gathering. A 2% (low estimate) productivity increase on $50 million would have been $1 million. This proposal can likely pay for itself!\n\nIt will be in the form of a dedicated Arbitrum Orbit Stack page on [growthepie.xyz](http://growthepie.xyz/) having 20 chains listed with standardized metrics for each chain as well as an aggregated fundamental metrics view for the whole stack.\n\nBrief background: This proposal has been created initially for the Arbitrum GovHack Brussels and was selected as one of the finalists. This version is an updated version, especially making sure that this proposal is understood as \n-\ta start to have more usage analytics around Orbit chains\n-\tthat the future process of data collection and onboarding of chains is streamlined\n-\tconstantly iterated on to make the listings cheaper and more affordable/sustainable for upcoming (and potentially smaller, more niche) Orbit chains.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSo far, there is no go-to place that provides an overview of Arbitrum Orbit. Standardized metrics allow a better idea of the performance and outlook of each chain being part of the Arbitrum Orbit. This results in greater transparency for all chains regarding their activity and how the usage of one chain compares to another.\n\nUsers can use this information to gather a quick overview of the Orbit ecosystem. Builders can use the different metrics to better track adoption, and DAO members can make more data-driven decisions on future initiatives (e.g., Orbit retrospective funding based on onchain contribution to the DAO).\n\nAlso, visibility for the overall Arbitrum Orbit stack is increased, and the whole Ethereum ecosystem can see what is going on in the Arbitrum ecosystem - where to be and interact, build, or allocate funding towards. Additionally, for DAO members and delegates, revenue and cost metrics provide future insight into how the Orbit approach should be developed to make it profitable for the DAO as well (includes more transparency into how much Orbit chains are paying to Arbitrum One).\n\nThis proposal is meant as a start for a long-term partnership to provide listing of Orbit chains long-term and on a recurring basis on growthepie. After the listing of the first setup and 20 initial chains, we would like to follow up with another AIP to enable listing of the 21st+ chain.\n\n### Rationale\n\ngrowthepie is an entirely public goods funded analytics platform for Ethereum scaling solutions. The AIP aligns closely with Arbitrum community’s mission and guiding values. At growthepie, Ethereum alignment is at the core of our existence, ensuring that our efforts contribute to the broader Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWe aim to enhance transparency, enabling data-driven decisions that are crucial for tracking outcomes and improving strategic decisions. All our code is open-source, allowing anyone to review and verify our metric logic. This openness fosters trust and ensures the integrity of our platform. We prioritize inclusivity by offering our platform and API completely free of charge, ensuring maximum accessibility for all users.\n\nOur user-focused design philosophy centers on the needs of our diverse audience, making data easy to digest and actionable for all users. We uphold the values of neutrality and openness as we believe in the power of data to increase transparency and objectivity. All information on our platform is freely available, reinforcing our commitment to these principles.\n\n### Specifications\n\ngrowthepie has proven to be a platform for people wanting to understand the overall health, activity, and usage across the Ethereum scaling solutions ecosystem. Arbitrum One was listed as one of the first 5 chains from the beginning. Since then, Arbitrum members have used the platform to compare Arbitrum One with other Layer 2s, and we have provided reliable data and visualizations for Arbitrum’s community. Marketing has also used our charts to provide data-driven insights into the ecosystem and how Arbitrum One is growing, giving it more credibility.\n\nBuilding on this, the Arbitrum Orbit should be given a dedicated place on growthepie with 20 chains listed in the beginning. This allows us to provide a mostly complete overview of the whole Arbitrum stack. This proposal is aimed at the start of a longer partnership. Hence, as part of this proposal, we will design and set up the initial pages and backend needed to onboard Orbit chains, aggregate fundamental metrics, and especially revenue metrics for each chain.\n\n**Which Orbit chains will be considered among the 20 chains as part of this proposal?**\nEvery chain that is above $1 million TVL (Total Value Locked) at time of the listing decision, will be eligible to be listed as part of this proposal. Every chain that is below at the start of the listing process will not be considered. In case a chain falls below $1 million TVL in the future (after the listing decision had been made), the chain will stay on growthepie, however. The chain will not be delisted and available data will be presented as long as no official announcement by the chain's team has been made that the chain will be shut down. \n\nEach Orbit chain – as Arbitrum One and any other chain listed on growthepie – will have their own set of metrics (in the categories activity, value locked, economics, and convenience) and their own single chain page. Additionally, each chain will appear on each fundamental metrics page for which the specific metric is available.\n\n**Stack view for an aggregated Arbitrum Orbit view**\nOn top of that, we will introduce a Stack view (new page) that provides a complete overview of the whole stack aggregated. This will be on a dedicated page which will enable users, builders, and DAO members solely interested in the Orbit to go to this place and learn more. See the prototype which includes:\n\n* Leading chart that aggregates Layer 2s and/or Layer 3s together showing growth over time\n* Table that lists all available Orbit chains on growthepie separated into Layer 2 and Layer 3\n* Fundamental metrics section with the aggregated view of all chains combined in the Arbitrum Orbit\n\nThis set of views will make it possible to easily get an overview and see the growth of the whole Orbit ecosystem but also to compare certain Orbit chains against each other (or against other Layer 2s from other ecosystems).    \n\n### Steps to Implement\n\nTimeframe starting from the date of DAO proposal approval and weeks/months add up to each other. Total duration ~ 5 months. Chain listing time is also dependent on potential collaboration with an indexing provider and their speed of chain indexing.\n \n![Screenshot 2024-08-08 at 4.28.38 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreigoncw5pkkpi3kyfevaiozgwiessp6hlfcf4ngdwnz6hqxryzmrdi)\n    \n\n### Overall Cost\n\nThe following cost are denominated in USD. The exact ARB amount will be determined closer to the onchain proposal date to reflect the US dollar ask. \n\n**Fix setup costs ($41,425.00 USD):**\n\n* Design and implement general platform UX adjustments (more chains mean restructuring of UI elements and different filter logic)\n* Designing and implementing frontend views: Orbit specific stack view, Single chain view (for each Orbit chain), Fundamentals view\n* Data infra setup (RPCs, database execution)\n* Metric aggregation & Logic: Activity (Transaction Count, Active Addresses – daily and monthly), Value locked (Stablecoin Market Cap, Total Value Locked), Economics (Revenue, Costs, Onchain Profit), plus Market Cap and Fully Diluted Valuation where applicable, Convenience metrics: Transaction Costs (median 1-day aggregation), DAO Contributions (how much back to ARB)\n\n**Initial chain listings (20 Orbit chains in total) and maintenance for 1 year ($168,750.00 USD):**\n\n* Integrate brand assets (icon, colors, etc.) for each chain\n* Pull raw transaction data and store in our database\n* Setup metric logic where applicable (e.g., bridge contracts for value locked, custom gas tokens, DA layer, settlement layer)\n* Daily aggregation of all relevant datapoints\n* Aggregated data / metrics available via API (for frontend and other data consumers)\n\n**Requirement:** Arbitrum Foundation provides indexed data. If not, an additional cost for indexing will be added ($3,750.00 USD per chain)\n\n**Recurring costs also cover:**\n\n* Hosting frontend\n* Maintenance backend / data pipelines\n* Regular posts on social media about interesting developments (from data perspective)\n\n**Total Costs: $210,175.00 USD**",

      "title": "ARB Staking: Unlock ARB Utility and Align Governance ",
      "content": "Please review the proposal forum post for a full proposal description: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arb-staking-unlock-arb-utility-and-align-governance/25084/1\n\n## Constitutional / Non-Constitutional\n\nConstitutional\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe propose to unlock ARB utility and improve the governance and security of the Arbitrum protocol by implementing ARB staking, without yet turning on fee distribution to token holders. Through ARB staking, token holders who delegate to active governance participants will be able to capture value. The proposal will also implement a liquid staked ARB token (stARB) via the Tally Protocol that enables any future rewards to auto-compound, is (re)stakeable, and is compatible with DeFi. Separately, we will work with the Arbitrum DAO to decide whether and how to fund rewards and split rewards between token holders and delegates.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe ARB token is struggling to accrue value.\n\n* Governance power is the only source of fundamental demand for ARB, while there are multiple sources of new supply (unlocks, treasury spending).\n* The ability to restake ARB or use it on DeFi is not compatible with governance. Voting power breaks when ARB is deposited into smart contracts. [Less than 1%](https://dune.com/queries/3732998/6278607) of ARB tokens are used actively in the onchain ecosystem.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihwhaicuuh3c7t3zvpe3xtqy3djrcp3jrqwslcxu4bpzhcvf2iwmu)\n    \nThe ARB token is struggling as a governance mechanism\n\n* Only about 10% of the circulating supply of ARB is [actively used](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates) in governance\n* Voter participation in the DAO has been [steadily declining](https://dune.com/queries/3829223/6440489) since DAO launch\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidgp7nukhkti7w65mntaqfztqr6wrefiwfry7tgiuwhgqokyg36t4)\n    \nMeanwhile, the Arbitrum DAO treasury has accumulated over [16 Million $ETH](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/treasury) in surplus fees from Arbitrum One and Nova. As a result, it is becoming economically attractive for a malicious actor to launch a governance attack on the DAO treasury. The potential profit of attacking the DAO treasury is increasing as more ETH accumulates in the treasury, while the cost of attacking the DAO through purchasing ARB for its voting power is not increasing proportionally to defend against attacks. A more developed version of this dynamic exists in the ENS and Compound DAOs, both of which are actively fighting off governance attacks (ENS documented [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-enable-cancel-role-on-the-dao/19090/10)).\n\nARB staking unlocks utility and aligns governance by creating a mechanism to stream future rewards from DAO-generated sources like sequencer fees, MEV fees, validator fees, token inflation, and treasury diversification to token holders who are delegated to an active governance participant. ARB staking makes ARB usable in restaking and DeFi by returning voting power locked in contracts to the DAO.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis proposal contributes to Arbitrum [Community Values](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values) by making the Arbitrum DAO more sustainable and secure.\n\n## Specifications and Steps to Implement\n\n### System architecture\n\nARB staking enables ARB utility while allowing the DAO to retain governance power. It includes a few modular components that come together to power the system.\n\nARB staking via the Tally governance staking system\n\n* Has the power to distribute fees proportionally to token holders who have delegated voting power to an active governance participant.\n\nThe DAO\n\n* Has the power to turn on fee distribution and send fees to ARB staking\n* Controls how voting power is distributed to delegates, including delegation strategies for unused voting power\n\nstARB (Tally Protocol LST)\n\n* Auto-compounds potential rewards if they are turned on in the future\n* Provides token holders a liquid position\n* Allows stARB holders to continue delegating directly to their preferred delegate. This can be accomplished through Flexible Voting, or by deploying surrogate contracts for each depositor. \n* Returns voting power to the DAO if stARB is deposited into restaking, DeFi, or centralized exchange smart contracts that do not maintain a 1:1 delegation relationship. The Arbitrum DAO exclusively has the ability to determine how this voting power is distributed/redelegated via a governance proposal. The DAO will decide how to set up the initial redelegation logic for stARB.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreichoivdxj4rgovc7rhpfo4v5tcerlb2bvcus6w7uyjup6kr23hou4)\n\n## Estimated Timeline\n\nPost proposal on forum for feedback: June\n\nPost temp check proposal on Snapshot: August\n\nPost onchain proposal on Tally for funding: August\n\nBegin development: August\n\nSubmit smart contracts for audit: September\n\nSubmit onchain proposal on Tally including full ARB staking implementation: October\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nIf this proposal passes temperature check, we will submit an onchain proposal that includes $200,000 USD in ARB of funding to cover the costs of development, including the following funding categories:\n\n* $50,000 USD in ARB: Develop ARB staking smart contracts\n  * Implement staking contracts\n  * Integrate Arbitrum’s current and potential fee mechanisms\n  * Integrate Karma Score requirement\n  * Enable the DAO to block Karma Scores if it believes they are being calculated incorrectly\n* $20,000 USD in ARB: Integrate ARB staking into Tally.xyz\n* $50,000 USD in ARB: Integrate Karma into ARB staking\n  * Develop and deploy a smart contract to store key stats and Karma scores onchain\n  * Create a system to record stats onchain and store detailed delegate data off-chain (using Arweave or IPFS) for easy verification\n  * Continuously improve scoring algorithms to adapt to evolving Arbitrum community needs\n  * Provide technical support to delegates experiencing issues with their statistics\n* $60,000 USD in ARB: Audit ARB staking smart contracts\n  * The final cost of the audit including documentation will be published on this thread. Any leftover funds from the $100,000 budget will be returned to the DAO.\n* $20,000 USD in ARB: Fund Staking Rewards and ARB Staking & Delegation working groups\n\nSeparately, we will submit an onchain proposal with the full ARB staking implementation at the conclusion of the development process.\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal should not be relied on as legal, tax, or investment advice.

This ArbOS upgrade brings a number of improvements, including:\n\n* Activating Arbitrum Stylus to enable developers to build the next generation of Rust or C++ applications on the EVM.\n* New precompile for verifying the [secp256r1 elliptical curve](https://www.nervos.org/knowledge-base/what_is_secp256r1) (as part of [RIP-7212 1](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md))\n* Change to fee collection on Arbitrum Nova, making it easier for ArbitrumDAO to manage and access the funds.\n\n**This AIP combines the following three temperature checks:**\n\n* [AIP: Activate Stylus and Enable Next-Gen WebAssembly Smart Contracts 1](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x330ed0f609da63cf4b67b932ab0665a76e1c7d6a7789f3383339bad79c789d2b)\n* [AIP: Support RIP-7212 for Account Abstraction Wallets 1](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x2f73825f375d59a5d3c8b05074e17140a4967e6ccb6fe20a58f836f865fcaae5)\n* [AIP: Nova Fee Router Proposal 2](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4ad37b12ffe5c334e0c19113ac54222983e18d36a255fbde60e483592f35fc65)\n\nA new ArbOS 31 “Bianca” was released between the time of the temperature check votes and submitting this proposal. ArbOS 31 release builds upon ArbOS 30 and includes new optimizations that were discovered during rigorous testing and feedback from Stylus teams. The ArbOS upgrade is shipped as a new Nitro node release alongside new upgrades to the rollup contracts for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\n*Note: ArbOS 31 “Bianca” will be the canonical ArbOS version for the “Bianca” family of releases.*\n\n> **Since the DAO has already signaled support for the adoption of all three changes in all three temperature checks, this proposal will proceed to an on-chain AIP on Tally next.**\n\n# Changes included\n\n### 1. Activation of Arbitrum Stylus: a new WebAssembly-based (WASM) VM to support smart contracts written in Rust and C++\n\nStylus is an upgrade to the [node software](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro) that powers all Arbitrum chains. This upgrade introduces a new WASM-based Virtual Machine (VM) that runs alongside the EVM. This enables developers to write smart contracts in new programming languages, like Rust, that are more efficient than Solidity smart contracts.\n\nStylus is a first-of-its-kind technology resulting from breakthrough engineering efforts in the Arbitrum ecosystem. Unlike other alternative VMs, the Stylus VM is not a replacement for the EVM & is instead purely additive to the EVM. This means that Stylus contracts and EVM contracts are fully interoperable. The two VMs work together to facilitate state transitions, each playing their part in executing their respective bytecode. Support for more memory efficient and safer languages will unlock a new generation of applications that were previously impossible to build on the EVM.\n\nThe Stylus VM and fraud prover were originally developed as a fork of the [Nitro](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro) codebase before. The Stylus codebase has since been audited ([Trail of Bits audit report 1](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-05-offchain-arbitrumstylus-securityreview.pdf)) and merged back into the Nitro codebase:\n\n* [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus: Stylus VM and Fraud Prover](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus)\n  * Merged into the Nitro codebase in: [Arbitrum Stylus by rachel-bousfield · Pull Request #2242 · OffchainLabs/nitro · GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/2242) and [Stylus v2 by tsahee · Pull Request #2425 · OffchainLabs/nitro · GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/2425)\n* [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-geth](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-geth)\n  * Merged into Offchain Labs’ fork of Geth in: [Arbitrum Stylus by rachel-bousfield · Pull Request #305 · OffchainLabs/go-ethereum · GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/pull/305)\n* [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-contracts](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-contracts)\n  * Merged into the Nitro-contracts codebase in: [Arbitrum Stylus by rachel-bousfield · Pull Request #170 · OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts · GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/pull/170)\n\nStylus contracts can be written using the Stylus SDK, which employs Solidity-equivalent ABIs and storage patterns to ensure cross-language interoperability. For example, existing Solidity DEXs can list Rust tokens without modification. New SDKs for additional programming languages can be added over time. Current SDK repositories:\n\n* Rust SDK: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs: Rust Smart Contracts on Arbitrum](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs)\n* C/C++ SDK: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-c: C/C++ Smart Contracts on Arbitrum](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-c)\n* Stylus CLI: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/cargo-stylus: Cargo subcommand for developing Arbitrum Stylus projects in Rust](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/cargo-stylus)\n\nIf you would like to better understand the lifecycle of a Stylus contract, head over to [A Gentle Introduction: Stylus 1](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/stylus-gentle-introduction). For teams who are curious to learn more about how Stylus is expected to interact with their project’s existing infrastructure, we encourage folks to check out this [Stylus launch ecosystem one-pager](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-FGC1sO5DlypyEW77r83GJUHuuipHGUY2Tvlvqr7GWk/edit).\n\nNote: Support for Stylus contract verification is currently under development by major block explorers. We expect that contract verification will be fully supported before ArbOS 31 Bianca gets activated on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, pending the DAO’s decision to adopt this proposal.\n\n### 2. Addition of a new pre-compile, to Arbitrum Nitro, that reduces the costs of verifying the secp256r1 elliptic curve as part of [RIP-7212 1](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md)\n\nPasskeys offer a solution that removes the need for a web3 user to personally store a private key for their wallet. Passkeys accomplish this by leveraging WebAuthn, a global standard for passwordless authentication used by Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and all major web browsers. The private key generated when creating a passkey can be encrypted and can only be decrypted using a specialized hardware module called the Secure Enclave. The Secure Enclave ensures a user’s private key can never leave the device, transforming any compatible device into a hardware wallet. Users can authorize transactions with biometric features like Touch ID or Face ID when using passkey-based wallets for key management. These qualities add flexibility and significantly improve UX while maintaining high security.\n\nAdding support for [RIP-7212 1](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md) decreases the costs of verifying the secp256r1 curve on-chain [by 99%](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/what-is-rip-7212) when compared to current implementations, making them more feasible for everyday use and enabling dApp developers and protocols to offer their users improved UX on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. Without a precompile, verifying this signature on-chain is extremely expensive. Passkey-based wallets offer a better level of security than a typical EOA and seamless cross-device support. Many wallets, and notably, apps using embedded wallets, have been requesting this feature for over a year.\n\nThe specifications of [RIP-7212 1](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md), including test cases, can be found in the [RIP repository 1](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md). If approved, Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova will use this specification as the reference for implementation. The [Ethereum Magicians Forum](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7212-precompiled-for-secp256r1-curve-support/14789) discusses design decisions, iterations, and the transformation of the proposal from an EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) to a RIP.\n\nThis pre-compile is part of Nitro 3.1.0 and was added to our fork of Go Ethereum in [Add Precompile for secp256r1 conditionally based on ArbOS version by anodar · Pull Request #303 · OffchainLabs/go-ethereum · GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/pull/303) and has been upstreamed into Nitro 3.1.0. Nitro 3.1.0 is the minimum supported version of Nitro for ArbOS 31 “Bianca”.\n\n### 3. Update all Nova fund distributors to use a series of “fee routers” instead, while keeping the final destination as the ArbitrumDAO Treasury\n\nToday, the ArbitrumDAO’s portion of the transaction fees from Arbitrum Nova are sent to the [Core Governance L1 Timelock address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951D92B0C345144506576eC13Ecf5103aC905a), which is accessible via the core governance system. This setup is disadvantageous because any time the ArbitrumDAO wishes to spend/move the funds, a roundtrip, constitutional proposal must be passed before the DAO.\n\nThis proposal updates the setup such that all Arbitrum Nova transaction fees, that are currently sent to the Core Governance L1 Timelock Address, are instead sent to a system of “fee routers” that automatically send all funds to the ArbitrumDAO treasury. Benefits of this new setup include:\n\n* Lower quorum requirements for moving these funds (3% vs. the current 5%)\n* No ~2 week delay to spend funds (since a constitutional vote would not be needed, as per the [Lifecycle and anatomy of an AIP](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal))\n* Simpler accounting and bookkeeping, since all the funds would be in the ArbitrumDAO treasury.\n\nThis new, proposed system of “fee routers” results in a fee collection lifecycle as follows:\n\n1. A `distributeRewards` function call is made on the `RewardDistributor` contract, sending funds to a `ChildtoParentRouter` contract\n2. Either upon receiving funds or via a call to `routeFunds`, the `ChildToParentRouter` creates an [L2-to-L1 message](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/arbos/l2-l1-messaging) which sends the contract’s full Ether balance.\n3. The L2-to-L1 message is executed, transferring the Ether to a `ParentToChildRouter` contract on L1.\n4. `routeFunds` is called on `ParentToChildRouter`, creating a retryable ticket which transfers its full Ether balance to the DAO Treasury on Arbitrum One.\n\nNote that the addresses deployed during the [Snapshot vote 2](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4ad37b12ffe5c334e0c19113ac54222983e18d36a255fbde60e483592f35fc65) for the `ParentToChildRewardRouter` and `ChildToParentRewardRouter` have been re-deployed at `[0x40Cd7D713D7ae463f95cE5d342Ea6E7F5cF7C999](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x40Cd7D713D7ae463f95cE5d342Ea6E7F5cF7C999)` and `[0x36D0170D92F66e8949eB276C3AC4FEA64f83704d](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x36D0170D92F66e8949eB276C3AC4FEA64f83704d)`, respectively.\n\n# Implementation\n\nAll of the above changes were independently audited.

Node operators may see a small increase in latency for Stylus `eth_call` queries, if ArbOS 31 is approved for activation on mainnet by the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n### Upgrade Action smart contracts\n\nThe Action smart contracts used to execute the on-chain upgrade can be viewed in [Arbos 31 actions by godzillaba · Pull Request #296 · ArbitrumFoundation/governance · GitHub](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/296).\n\nAction contract deployments for ArbOS 31 and Stylus:\n\n* Mainnet OneStepProofEntry (v2.0.0) (new osp) deployed at: [OneStepProofEntry | Address 0xa328BAF257A937b7934429a5d8458d98693C6FC7 | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa328BAF257A937b7934429a5d8458d98693C6FC7)\n* Mainnet OneStepProofEntry (v1.3.0) (cond osp) deployed at: [OneStepProofEntry | Address 0x83fA8eD860514370fbcC5f04eA7969475F48CfEb | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x83fA8eD860514370fbcC5f04eA7969475F48CfEb)\n* Mainnet ChallengeManager (v2.0.0) deployed at: [ChallengeManager | Address 0x914B7b3053B35B84A24df08D7c9ceBCaEA4E2948 | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x914B7b3053B35B84A24df08D7c9ceBCaEA4E2948)\n* Arb1 CacheManger deployed at: [TransparentUpgradeableProxy | Address 0x51dedbd2f190e0696afbee5e60bfde96d86464ec | Arbitrum One](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x51dedbd2f190e0696afbee5e60bfde96d86464ec)\n\n$ cast storage 0x51dEDBD2f190E0696AFbEE5E60bFdE96d86464ec 0xb53127684a568b3173ae13b9f8a6016e243e63b6e8ee1178d6a717850b5d6103 --rpc-url=<https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc>\n\n0x000000000000000000000000db216562328215e010f819b5abe947bad4ca961e (Arb One Proxy Admin)\n\n* Nova CacheManger deployed at: [TransparentUpgradeableProxy | Address 0x20586F83bF11a7cee0A550C53B9DC9A5887de1b7 | Arbiscan](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x20586F83bF11a7cee0A550C53B9DC9A5887de1b7)\n\n$ cast storage 0x20586F83bF11a7cee0A550C53B9DC9A5887de1b7 0xb53127684a568b3173ae13b9f8a6016e243e63b6e8ee1178d6a717850b5d6103 --rpc-url=<https://nova.arbitrum.io/rpc>\n\n0x000000000000000000000000f58ea15b20983116c21b05c876cc8e6cdae5c2b9 (Nova Proxy Admin)\n\n* V31 Wasm Root: 0x260f5fa5c3176a856893642e149cf128b5a8de9f828afec8d11184415dd8dc69\n* Deployed actions: [Arbos 31 actions by godzillaba · Pull Request #296 · ArbitrumFoundation/governance · GitHub](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/296/commits/1e42f3b818a4da1ebc5ff665a2ec0a80c6bebb67)\n  * ArbOneAIPArbOS31UpgradeChallengeManagerAction: [ArbOneAIPArbOS31UpgradeChallengeManagerAction | Address 0x19b715cf310c28c9020e53aaa11ce9df42e718b5 | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x19b715cf310c28c9020e53aaa11ce9df42e718b5)\n  * NovaAIPArbOS31UpgradeChallengeManagerAction: [NovaAIPArbOS31UpgradeChallengeManagerAction | Address 0x658afc9d5ec4476fa6bb7033ea465f9901fbff27 | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x658afc9d5ec4476fa6bb7033ea465f9901fbff27)\n  * ArbOneAIPArbOS31AddWasmCacheManagerAction: [ArbOneAIPArbOS31AddWasmCacheManagerAction | Address 0xb040b105A4a0C7a9CC290164AcCBC32855368322 | Arbitrum One](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xb040b105A4a0C7a9CC290164AcCBC32855368322)\n  * NovaAIPArbOS31AddWasmCacheManagerAction: [NovaAIPArbOS31AddWasmCacheManagerAction | Address 0x61703Bf337341f2e09d96Dd6488c2907718A8E26 | Arbiscan](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x61703Bf337341f2e09d96Dd6488c2907718A8E26)\n  * Nova SetArbOS31VersionAction:\n    [SetArbOS31VersionAction | Address 0x75C5a4532102DDFa44527B382990C384Ec1dD57D | Arbiscan](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x75C5a4532102DDFa44527B382990C384Ec1dD57D)\n  * Arb1 SetArbOS31VersionAction:\n    [SetArbOS31VersionAction | Address 0x7ed9C3A779BE8b742AbFC17a2F15353ecBcE3e00 | Arbitrum One](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7ed9C3A779BE8b742AbFC17a2F15353ecBcE3e00)\n\nAction contracts, deployments, and Fee Router contracts for the Fee Router AIP:\n\nThe Fee Router contracts can be found here: [fund-distribution-contracts/src/FeeRouter at v1.0.1 · OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts · GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts/tree/v1.0.1/src/FeeRouter)\n\n* Note that during the Snapshot vote, a different set of Fee Router contracts were shared.

However, that includes a lot of code that isn’t part of the WASM module root. To filter down to just the replay binary which defines the state transition function, you can start by generating a list of files in the nitro and go-ethereum repositories included by the replay binary in either ArbOS 20 or ArbOS 31 with bash:\n\n\\# !/usr/bin/env bash\n\nset -e\n\nmkdir -p ~/tmp\n\n\\# This script uses ~/tmp as scratch space and output\n\n\\# This script should be run in the nitro repository:&#x20;\n\n\\# Checkout and update submodules for consensus-v31\n\ngit checkout consensus-v31\n\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n\nmake .make/solgen\n\n\\# List dependencies for replay command, filter nitro dependencies, and save to file\n\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/' | sed 's@github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/@@' | while read dir; do\n\n&#x20; find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1\n\ndone | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v31-nitro-files.txt\n\n\\# List dependencies for replay command, filter geth dependencies, and save to file\n\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/' | sed 's@github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/@go-ethereum/@' | while read dir; do\n\n&#x20; find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1\n\ndone | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v31-geth-files.txt\n\n\\# Checkout and update submodules for consensus-v20\n\ngit checkout consensus-v20\n\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n\nmake .make/solgen\n\n\\# List dependencies for replay command, filter nitro dependencies, and save to file\n\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/' | sed 's@github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/@@' | while read dir; do\n\n&#x20; find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1\n\ndone | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v20-nitro-files.txt\n\n\\# List dependencies for replay command, filter geth dependencies, and save to file\n\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/' | sed 's@github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/@go-ethereum/@' | while read dir; do\n\n&#x20; find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1\n\ndone | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v20-geth-files.txt\n\n\\# Combine and sort nitro dependencies\n\nsort -u ~/tmp/consensus-v20-nitro-files.txt ~/tmp/consensus-v31-nitro-files.txt > ~/tmp/replay-binary-nitro-dependencies.txt\n\n\\# Combine, sort, and filter geth dependencies\n\nsort -u ~/tmp/consensus-v20-geth-files.txt ~/tmp/consensus-v31-geth-files.txt | sed 's@^\\[./]\\*go-ethereum/@@' > ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt\n\nNow, ~/tmp/replay-binary-dependencies.txt contains a list of dependencies of the replay binary that were present in ArbOS 20 or ArbOS 31. To use that to generate a smaller diff of the nitro repository, you can run:\n\ngit diff consensus-v20 consensus-v31 -- cmd/replay $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-nitro-dependencies.txt)\n\nThe fraud prover is not part of the on-chain upgrade, but may be helpful in understanding the fraud proving smart contract changes and other components:\n\ngit diff consensus-20 consensus-v31 -- arbitrator/prover arbitrator/wasm-libraries/ arbitrator/arbutil ':!\\*\\*/Cargo.lock' ':!\\*\\*/kzg-trusted-setup.json'\n\nFor the go-ethereum submodule, you can first find out what go-ethereum commit ArbOS 20 and 31 used:\n\n$ git ls-tree consensus-v20 go-ethereum\n\n160000 commit abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de go-ethereum\n\n$ git ls-tree consensus-v31 go-ethereum\n\n160000 commit 5a89d012232039ab57e28f9628c8e50b9093edc7 go-ethereum\n\nThose commit hashes are the go-ethereum commit hashes pinned by each Nitro commit. Then, you can again use git diff and the files generated by the earlier script to generate a diff limited to code used by the replay binary:\n\n\\# this should be run inside the go-ethereum submodule folder\n\ngit diff abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de 5a89d012232039ab57e28f9628c8e50b9093edc7 -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt)\n\nThis diff also includes the diff between upstream go-ethereum versions v1.13.3 and v1.13.11, as ArbOS 20 used the former and ArbOS 31 uses the latter.\n\nTo filter out that difference, you can use this tool to find the intersection of two git diffs:\n\nGit diff intersection finder\n\nWe can use that to find the intersection of the diff of ArbOS 31’s go-ethereum against ArbOS 20’s go-ethereum and the diff of ArbOS 31’s go-etheruem against upstream go-ethereum v1.13.11:\n\n\\# This should be run inside the go-ethereum submodule folder\n\n\\# Generate diff between two specific commits and save to file\n\ngit diff abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de 5a89d012232039ab57e28f9628c8e50b9093edc7 -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-20-vs-31-geth.diff\n\n\\# Generate diff between upstream geth and nitro geth, and save to file\n\ngit diff v1.13.11 5a89d012232039ab57e28f9628c8e50b9093edc7 -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-31-vs-upstream-geth.diff\n\n\\# Run the diff-intersection script with the specified diff files and ignored files\n\ndiff-intersection.py ~/tmp/arbos-20-vs-31-geth.diff ~/tmp/arbos-31-vs-upstream-geth.diff --ignore-files 'core/blockchain\\*.go' arbitrum\\_types/txoptions.go 'rawdb/\\*\\*' 'rpc/\\*\\*'\n\nThe above command ignores files that are included by the replay binary but whose components are not used with these arguments:\n\n`--ignore-files 'core/blockchain*.go' arbitrum_types/txoptions.go 'rawdb/**' 'rpc/**'.`\n\nTo also review those diffs, you can remove those arguments.\n\nNote that by default, [diff-intersection.py](http://diff-intersection.py) does a line based intersection. To instead do an intersection based on chunks in the diff, known as hunks in git terminology, you can add the `--only-hunks` flag.",

      "title": "[Non-constitutional] Incentives Detox Proposal",
      "content": "### **Abstract**\n\nThis proposal seeks the consensus of delegates to temporarily pause incentive programs in Arbitrum for 3 months after the conclusion of LTIPP and STIP Bridge distribution timeframes and utilize that time to structure a perpetual incentives program based on the data and the lessons learned from the programs we’ve had so far.\n\nVoting in favor of this proposal means that you’re voting in favor of taking a break from incentive programs so we can allocate the necessary time and mindshare to assess the programs we’ve had so far and design a new, perpetual program based on the learnings.\n\nVoting against the proposal means that you believe the programs we’ve had so far do not need to be reviewed further and that we should directly move to create a new incentive program.\n\n### **TL;DR**\n\n* We agree that incentives are necessary for the continuous growth of individual protocols and for the ecosystem as a whole.\n* We propose not to rush into creating another incentive program and to agree on a 3-month break once the current incentive distribution periods conclude.\n* During the break, we should focus on analyzing the results of the previous programs and design a new, long-term one based on what we have learned.\n* Various analyses and reviews have already been conducted; we should focus on connecting the dots and designing the operational parameters of a new program.\n* Existing incentives should continue to be distributed as originally planned; this proposal doesn’t seek to stop any of those.\n* There should be a commitment from delegates not to vote for any program that might be proposed before the 3-month period concludes so we can utilize the full extent of that time frame on iterations and improvements.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nEver since the first program ([Short Term Incentives Program, aka STIP](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131)), the DAO has been jumping from one program to another without effectively reflecting on the data generated by each program. The[ STIP Backfund proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-to-backfund-successful-stip-proposals-savvy-dao-final/19046) was introduced to fund all the STIP applications that were approved but were not funded because the budget ran out. The distribution for STIP and Backfund incentives was extended to March 2024, while the[ Long Term Incentives Pilot Program (LTIPP)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/long-term-incentives-pilot-program/20223) was introduced in December 2023 and was poised to run from January 2024 to April 2024. Lastly, the [STIP-Bridge](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/double-down-on-stip-successes-stip-bridge/22353) proposal was meant to mitigate the ‘unfair’ advantage that protocols distributing incentives from LTIPP would have over those distributing incentives from STIP & Backfund after the latter programs had expired.\n\nAnyone who followed the discussions around the different proposals and programs is familiar with the fact that time constraints played a significant role in why we didn’t stop to analyze the data collected and iterate based on that. We needed to maintain momentum and remain competitive with other L2s, especially while the market was overall bullish.\n\nThings have changed over the past few months, and the need for an incentive program that accounts for all the data that we have collected through the past programs has become apparent. Our proposal is a social agreement (we will post a temperature check vote on Snapshot, but there will be no on-chain proposal) to use the three months following the conclusion of LTIPP and STIP Bridge explicitly to reflect on the learnings, design and refine a program based on them, and consider the feedback of key stakeholders.\n\nWe know incentives are vital to protocol and ecosystem growth in crypto, and we want to help create a perpetual program that leverages incentives efficiently to have the biggest positive impact on the protocols receiving them.\n\n\n### **Rationale**\n\nThere are already hundreds of data points to review, analyze, and ultimately distill into actionable insights on what works and what doesn’t regarding incentives. From professionally carried out analysis to opinion-article style posts in the forums from stakeholders close to the DAO and the incentive programs themselves, here is a non-exhaustive list of information to use (in chronological order):\n\n\n\n* **[Proposal to Improve Future Incentive Programs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-to-improve-future-incentive-programs/18948)**\n* **[Discussion: Reframing Incentives on Arbitrum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/discussion-reframing-incentives-on-arbitrum/19817)**\n* **[Serious People: Proposed KPIs for Arbitrum Grant Programs (LTIPP)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/serious-people-proposed-kpis-for-arbitrum-grant-programs-ltipp/20416)**\n* **[A New Thesis for Network-Level Incentives Programs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/a-new-thesis-for-network-level-incentives-programs/20757)**\n* **[Learnings from STIP: Community Interview Summaries and Notes](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/learnings-from-stip-community-interview-summaries-and-notes/20916)**\n* **[STIP Analysis (ARDC Research Deliverables)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-research-deliverables/23438)**\n* **[OpenBlock’s STIP Incentive Efficacy Analysis](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/openblocks-stip-incentive-efficacy-analysis/23687)**\n* **[[RFC] Thoughts on the End-Game Perpetual Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-thoughts-on-the-end-game-perpetual-incentives-program/23720)**\n* **[STIP Analysis (ARDC Risk Deliverables)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/arbitrum-research-development-committee-ardc/risk-member/33)**\n* **[Memories of a (grantor) cow: thoughts about incentives program and what could be next](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/memories-of-a-grantor-cow-thoughts-about-incentives-program-and-what-could-be-next/25406)**\n* [**Research Bounty Selections](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/research-bounty-selections/25012) (to be completed)**\n* **[The ARC’s vision of historical incentive programs and its future](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/treasure-delegate-communication-thread/18873/22)**\n\nBefore we embark on another incentive program, we should try to incorporate the culmination of all the learnings from the above posts (and others I might have missed) into the design process.\n\n\n### **Specifications**\n\nThe proposal will be submitted to Snapshot a week after this forum post. If it successfully passes temp-check, the proposed 3-month break from incentive programs will begin on September 17th, given that the LTIPP and STIP Bridge incentive distribution timeframes conclude on September 2nd and September 16th, respectively.\n\nWithin 2 weeks of a successful temp-check, we will facilitate the revival of the incentives working group and invite delegates, researchers who have conducted analysis, protocol builders, and other relevant stakeholders to participate in the working group.\n\nL2BEAT does not wish to lead the working group; we’d instead prefer to facilitate its creation and then step back and participate as delegates by providing our feedback and opinions. However, we commit to remaining active in the working group and helping drive the discussion forward.\n\nOnce the working group has been formed, it should regularly meet and work towards designing an incentive program that accounts for as many of the insights we’ve gathered as possible without sacrificing operational efficiency and introducing too many complicated and unnecessary structures.\n\n\n### **Steps to implement**\n\n\n\n1. This RFC collects feedback and goes to Snapshot.\n2. The proposal passes Snapshot successfully.\n3. We ‘revive’ the incentives working group and invite all relevant stakeholders to participate.\n4. We collectively start designing and refining a long-term incentives program based on all the gathered data.\n5. On September 17th, the 3-month incentives break period begins.\n6. Ideally, by the conclusion of the 3-months break, we will be able to transform the design into an actionable program that can be submitted to the DAO as a proposal.\n7. [Optional] If 6 doesn’t come from the working group itself, then we should at least create an overview of principles any future incentive program must consider to be considered by the DAO.\n\n\n### **Timeline**\n\nThe proposed timeline for the incentives detox is 3 months. If involved parties feel that more time is needed to design an incentive program that is as comprehensive as possible, then the timeline can be extended as needed without an additional vote.\n\n\n### **Overall Cost**\n\nThere is no cost associated with the execution of this AIP.",

      "title": "Entropy Advisors: Exclusively Working With Arbitrum DAO",
      "content": "## Abstract\nThis proposal aims to secure funding for Entropy Advisors to continue its work exclusively with the Arbitrum DAO for one year. During this period, we will deliver strategic proposals, guide key partners through the DAO processes, and align the priorities of essential stakeholders for the betterment of Arbitrum. We will also expand our efforts to include a small set of additional verticals by hiring skilled contributors in areas where the DAO needs support, such as data analytics, technical proposal creation, marketing, or any other needs that may arise.\n\nWith a budget of $2.47M for the year paid in monthly installments and stored with the Foundation for DAO-clawback capabilities, along with an optional up to 1.5 million ARB for performance-based bonuses voted on by the DAO near the end of the term and put in a 3-year vesting contact to ensure long-term alignment, we will continue to build a dedicated team focused solely on enhancing the Arbitrum DAO’s success. The primary goal of our work is to help Arbitrum DAO continue its path toward efficient and effective operations and execute its long-term vision of becoming a sustainable entity with diversified revenue streams. We believe that over the coming years, Arbitrum DAO has the potential to generate hundreds of millions of dollars per year while maintaining its status as the leading Ethereum scaling solution with an ever-growing base of users and developers. All of Entropy Advisors’ employees will work full-time towards achieving this goal.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\nArbitrum DAO is set up to prosper with its cutting-edge technology stack that will soon support numerous coding languages, a vibrant community of users and developers, abundant resources in the DAO treasury, and the ecosystem’s commitment to scaling the most decentralized and secure L2 on Ethereum. Despite our belief that Arbitrum holds a strong position in the market today, there is a lot of work to be done over the next 3-5 years to ensure Arbitrum maintains and advances its position. We have diagnosed some key areas in need of improvement that we feel well suited to take on:\n\n1. Designing, drafting and executing proposals that benefit Arbitrum.\n2. Strengthening overall governance processes and providing feedback to other DAO contributors, unlocking efficiencies and ensuring redundant work is avoided.\n3. Acting as a mesh layer between key stakeholders, e.g., active delegates, development teams such as Offchain Labs, and the Arbitrum Foundation.\n4. Helping potential 3rd party strategic partners navigate the DAO to attract high-quality companies and individuals within the ecosystem and RFP applicant pools.\n5. Attracting/retaining top talent working full-time, professionally on behalf of Arbitrum DAO.\n6. Improving the ability of the DAO to spend money effectively and support a long term sustainable future for Arbitrum.\n\nToday the Arbitrum DAO faces friction executing across all of the aforementioned tasks. Many times those creating proposals have known or unknown ulterior motives and incentives at play. It is difficult for aspiring contributors and partners to navigate the DAO. No one is incentivized to bolster RFP applicant pools. Communication is fragmented with no entity in place to tie perspectives together, and operations/goals often overlap across initiatives. There are numerous proposals that are consensus to move forward but do not progress because there is no financial incentive to do so. There is inadequate accountability over and transparency into DAO funded programs. The problems are ever-evolving and growing, and the Arbitrum DAO needs an entity that only has the DAO’s best interests in mind to fill the gaps.\n\nOur team (@swmartin19, @mattonchain, and @pruitt) brings an extensive network as well as experience in research, governance, brand building, and project management to the Arbitrum DAO, having led well-known brands in the space such as Blockworks Research and 404 DAO. We have all been involved in the DAO since the beginning, starting with Blockworks Research’s entry into the DAO by highlighting flaws in the DAO’s very first proposal, AIP-1. We are not afraid to push against the status quo if we believe it helps Arbitrum achieve its goals.\n\nEntropy Advisors was extremely fortunate to receive a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation. As such, we have been able to use the past few months contributing full-time to Arbitrum DAO to further showcase our value in the community. We have hosted bi-weekly 1-on-1 calls with a cohort of large delegates, with the foundation, and with OCL, and feel that we have a strong hold on various stakeholder’s interests, strategic goals for Arbitrum, working initiatives, etc. When paired with our experience and networks within the industry, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to help Arbitrum achieve its long-term goals with all stakeholder perspectives in mind. With exclusivity meaning no official or unofficial engagements with any other client, Entropy Advisors can serve Arbitrum DAO with no ulterior motives or conflicts of interest.\n\nToday, virtually no money is spent on operations, while the DAO has spent almost 435M ARB in total with ~95% going towards investments, incentives, and grants (Source: Delphi & R3gen). We believe it is absolutely imperative for the DAO to make an investment in operations, simultaneously ensuring different initiatives across the ecosystem can be set in motion swiftly, fit together seamlessly, and can reach the best talent, while the DAO’s expenditures can be managed in a way that enables long-term sustainability. It is evident that this is becoming a wider-reaching theme within the DAO, but requires a heavy lift (see OpCo proposal from @dkpremia that asks for 25M ARB). We are NOT looking to replace OpCo, but rather drastically reduce the scope and funding request by helping formulate operational procedures until the OpCo is formally stood up. At that point, the DAO can decide what role Entropy Advisors plays as a service provider to the OpCo.\n\nWith the budget as outlined, Entropy will be able to hire up to 10 employees with a diverse range of skill sets including governance, data analytics, marketing, and development/engineering. We will be able to hire top talent in our industry who will dedicate their full-time bandwidth to Arbitrum DAO. Regardless of Arbitrum’s current strategic priorities, whether cutting costs or scaling strategies, our team will work to execute the goals of the DAO. Given Arbitrum’s dominance, size, and number of initiatives it is important that we build a well-rounded team at Entropy that can operate as the tip of the spear as a catalyst for change across the many sectors that the DAO operates.\n\n## Entropy’s Portfolio\nAt the beginning of May, we introduced Entropy Advisors to the Arbitrum DAO. We are a governance operations-focused business, working exclusively with Arbitrum. Our initial efforts have already driven several notable initiatives, demonstrating our capability and commitment to enhancing the Arbitrum DAO:\n\n![entropy.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreiea7v6o66utcod7ynuqcwuoh7ybc53fkmq57tpubeqklzug7q32au)\n    \n* Worked with @r3gen_Finance to create a proposal that reduces DAO OpEx on multi-sig signers, by establishing the Multisig Support Service.\n\n   * We leveraged our network to ensure a competitive applicant pool, which ultimately resulted in one of the most competent applicant rosters (40 in total) in the DAO’s history despite just a $1,500-$2,500 monthly wage per signer.\n\n   * The proposal is expected to save the DAO almost $400,000 per year.\n\n   * Entropy managed the application process, and will soon host a call with the winning applicants to go over multi-sig best practices.\n\n* Conducted research into Arbitrum DAO’s sequencer margin / transaction fee mechanism, kicking off a conversation that aims to increase the DAO’s treasury value rather than deplete it of resources.\n\n   * Attended/helped drive forward discussions related to DAO budgeting and sequencer revenue through working group calls.\n\n   * Followed up with a formal proposal to increase the L2 minimum base fee on Arbitrum One, with plans to establish a more long-term solution that includes service providers.\n\n   * This proposal, if passed, could bring the DAO an extra $5-15M per year of profit.\n\n   * We also tapped on the ARDC to conduct research into these areas, thereby utilizing existing resources at the DAO’s disposal rather than wasting additional resources.\n\n* Moved quickly to get Hack Humanity, the entity behind GovHack, ample funding to throw an event in Brussels at ETH CC for the Arbitrum community. These events require a substantial amount of lead time to plan, and the event would not have been possible if a few extra weeks had passed prior to getting the event funded.\n\n    * This is a great example of Entropy Advisors helping 3rd party service providers navigate the DAO while also combatting the collective inactive problem mentioned above. Everyone wanted Arbitrum DAO representation in Brussels and Entropy stepped in to get it done.\n\n* Introduced a governance calendar that encourages proposals to start and finish Snapshot and Tally voting on the same day each week, requires some support from delegates before proposals move to Snapshot from the Forum, and a holiday break at the turn of the new year.\n\n   *  The goal of this proposal was to reduce delegate fatigue by incorporating a more predictable structure, and ensuring things only go to Snapshot once they have been thoroughly reviewed by the broader community.\n\n***PLEASE NOTE THE REMAINDER OF THIS PROPOSAL HAS BEEN CUT OF DUE TO CHAR COUNT BUT CAN BE FOUND IN FORUM***",

      "content": "On June 20, 2024, a call for GCP Council nominees was posted to the forum. This DAO elected council will be made of experienced members to join a collaborative brain trust that advises and oversees the GCP. \n\nCouncil members will leverage their deep DAO governance experience, industry knowledge and financial expertise to guide the program’s strategic direction and ensure the utmost transparency to the Arbitrum DAO. \n\nPlease see the [candidate thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/gcp-council-nominations/25093/24) for details associated with each candidate nomination.\n\nWe strive to be thoughtful during the voting processes to ensure that a range of skills and expertise are represented on the GCP Council. To that end, all Nominees should be evaluated based on their ability to contribute to a well-balanced council.\n\n#### Please note:\n* This election is for **three open** seats on the GCP Council.\n* All applicants were asked to specify a single domain for the election. For instance, a DAO member with both venture capital and technology experience should choose the domain that best represents their primary focus for the election. \n* Domains are additional information for the DAO to select a well balanced council and are not requirements to be represented in the overall council. (the DAO can vote for two members of one domain, and/or no members for another domain)\n* Applicants are grouped by domain to encourage well-balanced voting and to ensure the council has a diverse set of skills.\n* We have [two](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/nominated-gaming-venture-council-members/25075/3) Council Members chosen by the GCP working group with deep experience in games oriented venture capital and business development that will be going through a re-confirmation vote later this year.\n\nThis election structure is weighted, meaning delegates may allocate their voting power to several candidates.\n\n#### Meet your GCP Council Nominees:\n\n#### Domain: Governance Expert\n* Immutable Lawyer [Gov Exp]\n* CoinflipCanada [Gov Exp]\n* C.J.

      "title": " Change Arbitrum Expansion Program to allow deployments of new Orbit chains on any blockchain",
      "content": "On the 18th of January 2024, the Arbitrum Foundation announced the [Arbitrum Expansion Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-arbitrum-expansion-program-and-developer-guild/20722) which allows projects to fork the Arbitrum codebase, modify it to their business needs, and deploy it on any chain that derives security from Ethereum. In return, the new Orbit chain is expected to share 10% of their chain’s profit back to the wider Arbitrum ecosystem. This includes 8% for the ArbitrumDAO and 2% for a new Arbitrum Developer Guild.\n\n# Support chains other than Ethereum?\n\nOne restriction of the Arbitrum Expansion Program is that a new Orbit chain must be deployed on any chain that derives security from Ethereum.\n\nMore specifically:\nThe “**Arbitrum Expansion Program**” is a suite of tools and services maintained and provided by the Arbitrum Foundation, a Cayman Foundation Company (the “Foundation”) designed to enable you to deploy and operate a trust-minimized network that has its security depend on the security of the Ethereum blockchain, which by way of example, is intended to include optimistic rollups, zk-rollups, optimiums and validiums that settle to Ethereum (each, an “Arbitrum Nitro Instantiation”).\n\nOver the past few weeks, the Arbitrum Foundation has received inbound interest from projects that want to deploy their own Orbit chain on other networks including, but not limited to: Bitcoin, Binance Smart Chain, Cosmos, and others. We expect this type of interest to increase over time as the Arbitrum Tech Stack gains popularity on Ethereum.\n\nThis leads to the following question:\n\n* Should **the Arbitrum Expansion Program be changed to allow Orbit chains to be deployed on blockchain networks other than Ethereum?**\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is requesting the ArbitrumDAO to decide on whether the Arbitrum Expansion Program should further expand and allow new Orbit chains to be deployed on chains other than Ethereum (and its derivatives).\n\nThere are a few points to consider when evaluating the above question:\n\n* **Revenue share**. Allowing widespread deployment of Orbit could potentially increase the revenue generated for the ArbitrumDAO simply due to the increased number of deployments.\n\n* **EVM dominance**. It can be argued that the EVM and Solidity has become dominant across the industry as it was easily adoptable by blockchain projects including rollups like Arbitrum. Accordingly, allowing widespread deployment of Orbit can further bolster EVM and Stylus (EVM+) dominance across the industry.\n\n* **Ethereum’s competitive advantage**. Restricting Orbit chains to only Ethereum can potentially act as a competitive advantage for the Ethereum ecosystem, but there is a potential tragedy of the commons if the Arbitrum Tech Stack is only restricted to Ethereum while other rollups can be freely deployed elsewhere.\n\n* **Alleviate confusion on definitions**. There are increasingly blurry lines on what it means to settle on a particular chain as projects adopt different data availability layers, host chains, and bridge configurations. It may even be possible for a single rollup to have multiple validating bridges across different blockchains. Changing the license can alleviate the need to resolve these blurry lines and allow projects greater certainty when deciding to deploy an Orbit chain.\n\nOf course, the above is not an exhaustive list, and there are other points the community may want to consider when making their decision.\n\n# Implementation\n\nAssuming the ArbitrumDAO approves Orbit chains to be deployed on any chain, then the Arbiturm Foundation will be responsible for collecting the 10% chain profit revenue share on the new chain and eventually migrating the funds into the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury and the Arbitrum Developer Guild.\n\nThe only requirement a project should consider before deploying on a chain is to check whether the Arbitrum Foundation has deployed a multisig to collect the revenue share. A multisig will be required to help the Arbitrum Foundation collect the fees and periodically bridge it to the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury.\n\nAdditionally, the Arbitrum Expansion Program’s description will be updated with the following:\n\n**Arbitrum Expansion Program** \nThe “Arbitrum Expansion Program” is a suite of tools and services maintained and provided by The Arbitrum Foundation, a Cayman Islands foundation company (the “Foundation”) designed to enable you to deploy and operate a trust-minimized scaling solution on a public blockchain network (each, an “Arbitrum Nitro Instantiation”). Subject to the terms of, and your compliance with, this Arbitrum Expansion Program Agreement (“Agreement”), the Foundation hereby agrees to make the Arbitrum Expansion Program available to you to develop and launch an Arbitrum Nitro Instantiation. The Foundation will also help you pursue modifications and improvements to the Nitro Software (as defined below) in cooperation with the Arbitrum DAO and in accordance with the Arbitrum DAO Constitution, as amended, available at https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution (along with the Arbitrum Expansion Program, the “AEP Services”). The Foundation reserves the right to determine the AEP Services available to you, and it may change the nature of the AEP Services available to you under this Agreement from time to time in accordance with the values and decisions of the Arbitrum DAO.\n\n# Discussion and Voting schedule\n\nThere have been 2 governance calls to allow the community to discuss the merits on whether the expansion program should be extended:\n\n* 22/4/2024 → 10:00 UTC\n* 26/4/2024 → 16:00 UTC\n\nFollowing community discussion, the proposal is now being put for a temperature check on Snapshot with the following voting options:\n\n* FOR: ‘Any blockchain network’\n* AGAINST: ‘Only Ethereum L1’\n* ABSTAIN\n\n**There is no need for an on-chain governance vote (via Tally) as the license is managed by the Arbitrum Foundation. We will require the snapshot vote to reach the same Quorum as required by a Non-Constitutional AIP. Therefore, if the constitutional quorum isn’t achieved, the default will be to keep the Arbitrum Expansion Program as it is, and not change anything.**\n\nIf the ArbitrumDAO decides to change the license, then the Arbitrum Foundation will endeavor to implement the necessary changes.",

      "content": "# Abstract\n\nHaving reviewed the [STIP Analysis (ARDC Research Deliverables)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-analysis-ardc-research-deliverables/23438) prepared by Blockworks, the Arbitrum Foundation has observed that Furucombo misused 59.5K $ARB of its Backfund STIP grant.\n\nAccordingly, the Arbitrum Foundation is seeking a decision from the ArbitrumDAO on whether to ban Furucombo from the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n# Motivation\nOn Jul 11, 2024, the Arbitrum Foundation made a [public request](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/potential-misuse-of-funds-furucombo/25496), for Furucombo to present its case to ArbitrumDAO and return the misused funds, by July 18.\nThis deadline has now passed and Furocombo has not responded on the forum.\nThe Arbitrum Foundation has no choice but to seek a vote from the ArbitrumDAO on the following question: \n**Should Furucombo, including all founders, current team members, and affiliated contributors, be permanently banned from all future ArbitrumDAO programs? This includes (non-exhaustive):**\n- Applying for future DAO-affiliated grant programs\n- Qualifying for any retroactive programs from the DAO\n- Affiliated members applying for open roles in the DAO\n# Rationale\nThe Arbitrum Foundation, with the support of the STIP & STIP Bridge multi-sig committees and program manager, deems Furucombo to have misused its Backfund STIP grant for the following reasons:\n- Furucombo did not publish a final STIP report\n- Furucombo sent the 59.5K $ARB from the STIP to Kraken accounts, making it unclear how incentives were spent\n- Furucombo froze incentives towards ‘wash traders’, with users claiming they [received significantly fewer rewards than expected](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/furucombo-used-arbitrum-grants-to-incentivize-stealing-user-funds/23269)\n\n# Steps to Implement\nThe ArbitrumDAO will have the following voting options to choose from:\n- FOR - Ban Furucombo from the ArbitrumDAO\n- AGAINST - Do not ban Furucombo\n- ABSTAIN\n\nThis proposal will not require a Tally vote because there are no on-chain actions to be taken. Accordingly, this Snapshot vote aims to get social consensus from the DAO, and will serve as the final decision.\n\n# Timeline\nThis Snapshot vote will run from today (July 19) till July 26. If the DAO votes to ban Furucombo, then Furucombo will be ineligible to apply for any ArbitrumDAO programs from July 26th onwards.\n\n# Overall Cost\nRegardless of the outcome, there will be no cost to the ArbitrumDAO.",

These are: an effective knowledge base, investment frameworks, and a committed team of experts. We’ll align with DAO budgeting and strategic objectives, building on existing work and GCP learnings as a proof of concept.\nThe result will be capture-resilient to any one party’s interests and aligned with DAO governance best practices.\n\nThe execution of the work scoped in this pilot will lead to a specific proposal for the setup & funding of the Ecosystem Fund (or to smaller proposals for allocating capital to specific targets building up to it). Scope:\n\n1. Funding Ecosystem Health Report\n2. Ecosystem Investment Thesis & Strategy\n3. Strategic Recommendations\n\n## Motivation\n\nAfter observing the investment and venture challenges faced by the DAO, its builders, and investors, we need the Arbitrum Ecosystem Fund as a bold and decisive initiative. The significant opportunity cost requires quick action for AVI to produce actionable thesis, strategy, and recommendations. These will empower delegates and groups to make effective decisions, tackling the risks of an otherwise incongruent, piecemeal approach. A lean and pragmatic pilot will address these outcomes in the short term, incl. in relation to live proposals, while demonstrating the viability of a more holistic long term structure and laying a solid foundation for it.\n\n## Rationale\n\nArbitrum is already a highly desirable platform by engineers and a market leader. In order to continue to thrive, the DAO needs to double down on betting on these builders that are growing the ecosystem and expanding the sequencer volumes. Doing so in alignment with treasury sustainability, budgeting, and strategic goals, including increasing protocol revenues, diversifying revenue streams, and opening new markets.\n\nSince AVI started there has been a lot of interest from a broad spectrum of builders and investors. We have seen a growing number of proposals in this category, however selecting the correct mix of solutions, funding them, and ensuring accountability to the ecosystem has proven challenging. Thus AVI is focused on rapidly producing actionable outputs, while unlocking a variety of tactical steps for the DAO.\n\nOutputs:\n\n1. Enable Arbitrum to make the next step towards developing a best-in-class approach to a DAO-led Ecosystem Investment Fund in Web3 including a proposal for its further structure and deployment.\n2. Rigorous understanding of Arbitrum environment, including:\n   1. Funding gaps\n   2. Opportunities outlined by investors\n   3. Free market capital that can be mobilized\n   4. Live proposals for venture initiatives (e.g. BoB, SC, etc)\n3. Develop an Ecosystem Investment Thesis, Strategy, and Recommendations aligned with Arbitrum's long term goals to create a unified vision within the DAO on best practices for fostering a thriving venture ecosystem\n4. Develop an Ops plan for applying the Ecosystem Investment Thesis, Strategy, and Recommendations\n5. Community engagement for DAO accountability and transparency:\n   1. Evaluating approaches for community engagement in the work of the unit\n   2. Running engagement sessions with educational outcomes on key concepts\n   3. Ensured coordination with the work of other relevant groups\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Deliverables\n\n**Market Consultation Report** (State of Venture in the Arbitrum Ecosystem)\n\n* Discovery summary\n* Deck for Market Consultation\n* Consultation Schedule of 45+ participants (incl. groups that have made proposals to the DAO)\n* Anonymised data\n* Findings and summary\n\n**Thesis and Strategy Report for Investment and Venture Fund**\n\n* Types of funds, instruments, and initiatives to target (venture funds, accelerators, incubators, venture studios, etc.)\n* Development of foundational hypothesis for key strategic sectors for growth, investee profiles across multiple stages of maturity, and which markets and trends to focus on (integrated with active work of other working groups)\n* Portfolio construction\n* Evaluation frameworks for funds and initiatives (initial version)\n* Evaluation frameworks for Ecosystem Fund's - Impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem and long-term value creation (initial version)\n\n**Set of Strategic Recommendations**\n\n* Roadmap for the next AVI phases (considering emerging constraints and synergetic structures and work groups)\n* Analysis of strategic investment priorities and steps for fund deployment (building on Areta’s M\\&A Pilot)\n* Specific analyzed target deals\n\n**A detailed operational plan for the next phase of the Arbitrum Venture Initiative**\n\n* Timeline and milestones for key activities and deliverables\n* Resource allocation and team roles\n* Budget breakdown for next phases with an overall target allocation for Arbitrum having been considered\n\n**Community Engagement Report**\n\n* Recordings of engagement and educational events\n* Decks, Miro boards, and workshop summaries\n* Participation of AVI team in sessions opened by other working groups\n* Proactive engagement with relevant groups (GCP, M\\&A, DAO Budgeting, etc) to include their inputs on thesis, operations and legal\n* Findings on activities and formats producing valuable inputs for venture thesis development, strategy, and execution\n* Key learnings embedded for future community engagement to maintain transparency\n\n### Other Considerations\n\n1. **Proactive engagement and alignment with other working groups and streams including:**\n   1. DAO Budgeting\n   2. Treasury Management\n   3. GCP\n   4. M\\&A\n2. **Full alignment with legal structures and frameworks:**\n   1. GCP legal umbrella setup\n3. **Governance considerations:**\n   1. Top level oversight and control should be based on a committee with roles elected by the DAO\n   2. DAO votes should be triggered for decisions with high material impact like additional capital allocation, liquidating the structure, or actions outside the approved mandate for the roles above\n4. **Best practices on DAO engagement**\n   1. Transparency\n   2. Accountability\n   3. Participatory design (where feasible)\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nTo kick off working towards the Ecosystem Fund, we’re proposing the initial phase that includes:\n\n1. **Creating the State of Arbitrum’s Venture Ecosystem Report** to surface valuable insights from the community, bringing all stakeholders up to speed. This report will highlight successful initiatives and uncover gaps through dozens of discovery and market consultation interviews.\n2. **Building a Thesis and Strategy Report** for Investment and Venture fund set-up in the Arbitrum Ecosystem where we explore funds, instruments, and initiatives to target (venture funds, accelerators, incubators, venture studios, etc.), develop the foundational hypotheses for key strategic growth sectors and markets, and explore portfolio construction and evaluation frameworks.\n3. Leveraging these reports, we’ll produce a **set of strategic recommendations and proposal** for AVI to set up the initial iteration of the Ecosystem Fund to manage investment allocations, funding proposals, structuring deals, and managing the outcomes with the likes of RnDAO, EVM Capital, Outlier Ventures, Elixir Capital, and the relevant accelerators coming from ThankARB’s RFP programs. It is intended to be structured as a Fund of Funds, resilient to capture by any one group’s special interests.\n\nTo tackle this challenge, we are bringing a team with deep expertise in investment (including a decade in web3), early-stage and growth builders, and ecosystem building around frontier technologies, with 100s of millions deployed, billions in exits, and intimate knowledge of Arbitrum. Profiles are outlined on the forum and Snapshot proposal.\n\n**Core Full time team**\n\nLino & Ana\n\n**Subject-matter experts:**\n\nPaul, Konstantina, Joseph \\[Immutable Lawyer], Anish, Bart\n\n**DAO representative:**\n\nAlex Lumley\n\n## Timeline\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfl_9urpiYt_RYAVg1_rGh6Fd2oOkzgwge1fjirZyybRUs15QEOIPq6HAYmRg-kBQnC3zne7SamtTHDsuvBe2GMnWD4QrTDCk14LqhMnKgvGrNePS3pGwC9nOXZywGoIravo66Q20FBz9iibPc-JqVpuqJj?key=TBYl9rDlOsW_Ldf8hOk9hA \"gantt\")\n\n## Overall Cost\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd_rbFVgD9Q15bopYqhSLTScKwO5Sga90mog-c-eltOHB9keQMbyZwvHePknjTwibZEVnjKnjB0rK_oN4mS8u8LGWjD3TKCQjJ_gCdr24vP17WLItfQ1tTMMzLT67C1YvFdCPuo7u9fEqbLaM1nNDvGCMo?key=TBYl9rDlOsW_Ldf8hOk9hA \"budget\")\n\n#### Total - **$87,000.00**\n\nArb to be transferred to a Safe MSig (arb1:0x9271A08958C0406F59fc0E0510141563A2FFcD28) composed of the following signers:\n\n* Lino Velev: arb1:0xFf46A0dF4fB1729679420D71089a7dcc16C7fFad\n* Ana-Maria Yanakieva: arb1:0xbE6fE3cE690b8B2e86FA2d4B358386d2211feE1A\n* Alex Lumley: arb1:0xA9cD2D7Fe90321BadD16ebf6b5dB7A6Be099ef2E\n\nThe ARB amount to be transfered is based on the USD equivalent at time of submission with a 35% buffer.

      "content": "# Jumpstart fund for DAO improvement\n**Non-Constitutional**\n\n\nChallenge Statement: The DAO struggles with funding the initial steps needed for problem definition, alignment and scoping, causing slow progress and overburdening delegates with inadequate proposals.\nTeam Lead: Daniel, @mrjackalop on telegram \n\n\n[Slides presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WcCyR5Ty6SMsRNqykT5ZHTwdE_RQde4ddemh3P6fP68/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n[2 min video](https://www.loom.com/share/c4ee6c313a514e939f7c2ff0087efcbd?sid=5f6e4c5d-c1e5-4789-80fb-496e7c652e14)\n\n\n# Abstract\nThis proposal allows the DAO to proactively define key problem areas and have the community untangle them, as opposed to having delegates be reactive to proposals that benefit small subgroups of community members.\nThe DAO currently struggles with funding the initial steps needed for problem definition, alignment and scoping, causing slow progress and overburdening delegates with inadequate proposals. To address this, a pilot fund is proposed, utilizing Questbook's small grants model to support early-stage initiatives focused on problem definition (root causes, gathering requirements), alignment, and scoping proposals for operational and governance improvements. A problem gathering exercise will be conducted to inform proposers and the assessor by identifying key problem areas through user research interviews, qualitative surveys of delegates and other stakeholders, and a collective intelligence algorithm, clustering initiatives to ensure alignment between proposals and the DAO's current needs.\nThe pilot fund will prioritize initiatives aiming to improve ArbiturmDAO's operations and governance. An assessor, elected by the DAO, will oversee the proposal assessment, following the established Questbook program rules. The success of this pilot will be measured by the number of initiatives that receive subsequent funding, clarity and alignment generated within the community, and an over 80% approval rate in a Snapshot vote to continue the program.\n\n\n# The Problem:\n\n\nThe DAO has multiple challenges but currently needs a way to fund the initial steps of addressing them. As a result, only groups with a lot to win will invest all the necessary time and effort and take the risk to evolve a proposal without being paid.\n\n\nAreas like organisation design, strategy, spending plan, and more require not just crafting a proposal but they require problem definition work: significant stakeholder engagement to determine the right approach, understand root causes and requirements, generate buy-in, and craft the right proposal to make. There’s currently no way to fund all this problem definition and preparatory work leading to the DAO advancing slowly, delegates being overwhelmed assessing proposals that don’t quite hit the mark, and meanwhile key decisions and needed proposals don’t happen.\n\n\n# Proposed Solution:\n\n\n1. A method for the DAO to aggregate challenge statements or problems\n2. A funding program for initiatives that will carry out problem definition and initial solution work on one of the challenge statements.\n\n\nQuestbook has shown to be a viable mechanism for distributing small grants to groups. We propose to use this model and set up a pilot fund to evolve proposals that address key Operational and Governance needs to improve Arbiturm DAO.\n\n\nAdditionally, we’ll carry out a “collective intelligence exercise” to identify the key problem areas.\nAnd we're including an option in the Snapshot to also fund a Playbook for Proposing to the DAO, where we'll gather the learnings of the grantees who successfully pass a proposal through the DAO and the challenges of those who didn't, and document them as material for future grantees.\n\n\n**What will be funded via the Jumpstart Fund:**\n\n\n* Early-stage initiatives aiming to improve ArbiturmDAO ops and gov\n* Priority for funding initiatives advancing problem definition and alignment around key challenges.\n* Requirement for being referred by at least 3 of the top 30 delegates.\n* Priority for proposals including a last milestone for a successful snapshot vote (i.e. success bonus of at least 10%).\n* Initiatives expected to last up to 3 months.\n* Initiatives can request up to USD$50k equivalent (subsequent submissions considered).\n* product/protocol development will not be funded (that’s better suited for other Questbook tracks or programs).\n\n\n**How are proposals assessed:**\n\n\n* An assessor will be selected by the DAO via an election as conducted for previous Questbook tracks.\n* Proposals up to USD $25k can be approved directly by the assessor for this track. Proposals above this amount requires cross-checking with the assessors form other tracks.\n\n\n**Fund governance:**\n\n\nThis track will follow the same rules as the ongoing Questbook program ([link](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/questbook-dda-program-phase-2-request-for-continuation/21326)), whereby funds are held in the multisig operated by the assessors of the multiple Questbook tracks.\nThe totality of the funds are to be transferred there and the signers will provide payment for the service provision parts upon completion (e.g. problem assessment, playbook if completed, etc).\n\n\n**Method to Identify Problem Areas:**\n\n\nBefore opening the fund to proposals, we’ll work with the DAO to identify key problem areas that could then lead to proposals for problem definition and alignment work. This work will be carried by RnDAO's research team.\n\n\nBased on Professor Daniel Kahneman’s work, we have selected a collective intelligence method that provides high efficiency (low time involvement required from delegates) and is credibly neutral. The method is based on the use of a qualitative survey of delegates and other stakeholders to collect a list of statements proposing key challenges. We'll complement this mechanism with user research interviews with the top 30 delegates.\nThe statements are then analysed using a collective intelligence algorithm (SimScore) that identifies a theoretical ‘central’ statement that would be most agreed upon, and then analyses the provided statements to rank them for proximity to said theoretical centre.\n\n\nThe ranked statements, as well as the graph (positioning of statements relative to each other), will then be made publicly available to inform (not mandate, just inform) those proposing initiatives to the pilot fund.\n\n\n(Further untangling between statements and root cause analysis is part of the work this Questbook track will fund.)\n\n\n# Timeline:\n\n\nThe Pilot is expected to last 4-6 months depending on whether the option to distil learnings into a playbook for proposing to the DAO is approved in Snapshot or not.\n\n\n* Month 1 for identifying problem areas.\n* Month 2-4 for assessing and funding proposals.\n* Month 5 for reporting\n* month 6 for (optional) collecting learnings about proposal development into playbook\n\n\n# What does success look like?\n\n\n* Experts in the community can work towards improving Arbiturm DAO.\n* The initiatives funded generate clarity, buy-in, and alignment,\n* The initiatives funded evolve towards full proposals for the DAO and are funded.\n* The delegates love this pilot and want to continue funding it.\n\n\n**KPIs:**\n\n\n* 40%+ of initiatives continued and received subsequent funding\n* Over 80% approval in a Snapshot vote asking delegates whether the program should be continued after the pilot\n\n\n# Budget \n![Screenshot 2024-07-15 at 4.57.04 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreigovxyqq2et74lbej5yjjpwfdt4wgxdg5mz4rcvhjpk75owswl62a)",

Remaining ARB will be sent back to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury.*\n\n**Executive Summary**\n\nAs voted on in the ADPC proposal [<u>here</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/43616303506326656287362617487331059827021737444126158637397168372555259240241), one of the key tasks of the ADPC was to conceptualize and structure a subsidy fund for the Arbitrum DAO. As per the [<u>proposal </u>](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xd45c0426919353cbce3e7e2a3e7a00c01f9d606bb7ed6c9788db4598f044b16a)passed on 25-Apr-24, the Arbitrum DAO will fund 1 cohort of 8 weeks (2 months) for a total fund size of $2.5 million worth of ARB. \n\nFollowing the rejection of this [<u>proposal</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x285a0ef00fabce6e1d44b10ffff9fff5a30f62649339cfeded113e23bc58cdf1) which sought to set up a Sub-Committee for the Security Services Subsidy Fund based on community feedback received, the Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (hereinafter referred to as the ‘ADPC’) will be responsible for facilitating the selection of projects that will benefit from the whitelisted security audit service providers selected via the ADPC’s procurement framework, as originally proposed in the [<u>Subsidy Fund Proposal</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-subsidy-fund-for-security-services/22958?u=sid_areta). \n\n**Proposal Request**\n\nWe propose the creation of a procurement subsidy fund allocating up to $2.5 million worth of ARB to provide financial assistance to both new and existing projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThese subsidies will be exclusive to a pre-approved whitelisted set of security audit service providers, selected by the ADPC, who will publicly display their fees. This approach eliminates the need for the ADPC to assess the reasonableness of funds requests.\n\nThe aim of the subsidy fund is to incentivise participation and growth among smaller projects helping them to overcome barriers to entry, such as challenges to acquire funding to pay for the cost of robust security audits.\n\nA benchmarking exercise was conducted with various security audit service providers, with this [<u>form</u>](https://noteforms.com/forms/subsidy-fund-service-fee-consultation-mtg039) being shared with 10 service providers (including the likes of Spearbit, Halborn, Nethermind, Three Sigma, Guardian, Zellic, etc.) on their scope of services and fees associated. Based on this, we have estimated that each project will require a 2-month security audit at an average cost of $200K. This will enable the ADPC to potentially fund up to 12 projects; however, it should be noted that the average of $200K is an estimate and fees are usually specific to each project, each project requires a scoping exercise, and audit costs will vary based on the size of the codebase, complexity, etc.\n\n**Subsidy Fund Design & Approach**\n\n**Exec View**\n\n·       Up to $2.5 million worth of ARB allocated to spend on whitelisted security audit service providers, with an average amount of $200K worth of ARB allocated per project and a max cap of $250K per project (10% of the subsidy fund available).\n\n·       ADPC will be responsible for selection and oversight.\n\n·       The Subsidy Fund will be distributed across 1 cohort of 8 weeks. \n\n**Key Pillars**\n\n**(A) Subsidy Fund Principles and Criteria**\n\n**Core Principles Underlying the ADPC Subsidy Fund**\n\nBefore considering a subsidy application, applicants should carefully evaluate the need for support. The purpose of these guidelines is to clarify the subsidy program and make the process as straightforward as possible.\n\nAll applicants should keep in mind the following key principles:\n\n1\\.\t**Transparency & integrity** - Applicants must disclose any potential conflicts of interest and receipt of any prior funding.\n\n2\\.\t**Encouragement of investment** - Subsidies should incentivise investment that would not otherwise occur without the subsidy. They should not cover costs that the beneficiary would have funded independently in the absence of any subsidy.\n\n3\\.\t**Proportionate and necessary** - Subsidies should be proportionate to their intended objective and limited to what is necessary to achieve it.\n\n4\\.\t**Economic neutrality** - The requested subsidy amount should not confer an economic advantage. It should be provided on fair terms, comparable to what could reasonably be obtained on the market.\n\n5\\.\t**Consideration of funding options** - Applicants are expected to explore all available funding options and responsibly choose the option that best suits their needs.\n\n6\\.\t**Enhancement of beneficiary security** - Subsidies should bring about changes that enhance the security of the beneficiary’s protocol.\n\n7\\.\t**Positive impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem** - Subsidies should have a beneficial effect on the Arbitrum ecosystem, contributing to its growth and sustainability.\n\n8\\.\t**Value for Money** - The evaluation method should ensure decisions maximize both financial and non-financial value to Arbitrum.\n\n9\\.\t**Probity** - Subsidies should be issued in an environment that ensures fairness, impartiality, and compliance with established guidelines and rules. There will be an emphasis on transparency, accountability, and integrity throughout the procurement process, evidenced by the development of this publicly documented Means Test methodology. This focus on Probity will mitigate procurement risks and safeguard the integrity of the procurement process.\n\n10\\. **Risk Management** - Risk management policies will be implemented to identify and mitigate procurement risks.\n\n11\\. **Engagement with SMEs** - We have invited a wide range of organisations to participate, all of whom will be subject to the eligibility criteria.\n\n12\\. **Cyclical Whitelist events** - We will have clear rules for cyclical whitelist reviews to open a pathway for future applicants and new market entrants.\n\n**Means Test: Criteria for Evaluation**\n\nThe reason for this approach over a purely quantitative approach is that most projects, especially the smaller ones being targeted within this subsidy program do not possess obvious immediately measurable metrics.\n\nThe development of this Means Test aims to provide a structured approach for the ADPC to evaluate applications for financial assistance. This tool is designed to identify applicants who would benefit most from support, ensuring equitable access to subsidies within the Arbitrum Ecosystem, particularly for smaller entities with valuable contributions.\n\nThe intent is to allocate subsidies to those most in need, avoiding exploitation by larger players looking for a ‘free lunch/handout’. Such an event could give recipients an unfair advantage over their competitors or be an inefficient use of the DAO’s funds if they do not bring about a net positive change.\n\nThe means test will include a scoring system ranging from 1 to 5, reflecting the merit of each application.\n\n·       Rating 1: Unsatisfactory\n\n·       Rating 2: Below expectations\n\n·       Rating 3: Meets expectations\n\n·       Rating 4: Above expectations\n\n·       Rating 5: Exceptional\n\nEach of the sub-criteria in the means test have varying levels of importance, and they will each have a weighting attached. A weighting of 1 indicates low importance, 2 indicates neutral importance, and 3 indicates high importance.\n\nEach application will be scored by ADPC members, followed by a collective decision on the most deserving grant recipients, taking into account the rating against the eligibility criteria, a value-for-money evaluation and the funds available. \n\nAfter the applications have been reviewed and decisions taken as to the grant beneficiaries, the average score assigned to each project will be shared publicly, ensuring that transparency is maintained throughout the process. In the event that an applicant receives a high score but is not chosen as a grant recipient, explanatory feedback will be provided either on an individual or collective basis to the cohort.\n\n**EVALUATION CRITERIA**\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/183eecb1-da8e-4f44-b765-382856e3bb73_original.png)<img height=\"445\" width=\"714\" src=\"https://static.tally.xyz/f75882bb-4d50-4574-b052-3ac70a71d45a_original.png\" />\n\n<img height=\"667\" width=\"707\" src=\"https://static.tally.xyz/beaaf036-ae7e-46f8-91de-ac581b90721a_original.png\" />\n\n<img height=\"316\" width=\"685\" src=\"https://static.tally.xyz/b9768498-bdd5-4bcf-831d-4e3f5902d4b3_original.png\" />\n\n<img height=\"700\" width=\"682\" src=\"https://static.tally.xyz/12e204ca-2317-406e-a985-f3155a61f1cb_original.png\" />\n\n<img height=\"332\" width=\"680\" src=\"https://static.tally.xyz/bd8593cc-2843-45be-a2ec-127de568e880_original.png\" />\n\nRegarding the ‘Ecosystem Contribution’ metric above, we have conducted an initial assessment of the types of projects that are currently building in the Arbitrum ecosystem and identified a few verticals that the ecosystem would benefit from funding. These are set out below, along with the rationales for choosing them, providing more weight to such areas.\n\n*Note*: We have removed the Collab Tech and Gaming verticals which were present in the original proposal. There are a number of grants programs already centered around Collab Tech, while the Gaming vertical is sufficiently incentivized via the GCP.\n\n**RWAs & Tokenization**\n\n·       Commands a small proportion of Arbitrum attention and building however is a focus of big institutions & banks deploying large amounts of capital into tokenization.\n\n·       Arbitrum as the home of DeFi is currently trailing in this burgeoning key category (e.g.,[<u> Mantle</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth/proposal/0x26884fce58b66e82fa74735a2e255f76654618278432897f4ca2430702e95dcd) passed a $60 million support program for tokenized RWAs on their chain and Polygon and Avalanche have been very active in the space).\n\n·       Tokenized treasuries and private credit have [<u>passed $1.3 billion in terms of value tokenized</u>](https://app.rwa.xyz/treasuries), and are only projected to grow in importance in the near future, highlighted by the recent launch of [<u>BlackRock’s</u>](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/03/20/blackrock-enters-asset-tokenization-race-with-new-fund-on-the-ethereum-network/) tokenized fund.\n\n·       Forum discussions talking about RWA’s being used as a tool for diversifying the Arbitrum DAO treasury. See[<u> here</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/final-arbitrum-stable-treasury-endowment-program/20139).\n\n**Stylus Adoption**\n\n·       Stylus’s flexibility, as detailed in this [<u>proposal</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-activate-stylus-and-enable-next-gen-webassembly-smart-contracts-arbos-30/22970), allows developers to write smart contracts in Rust, C and C++, significantly expanding the developer base from an estimated 20,000 Solidity developers to include developers from other languages such as Rust and C++ which have around 3.5 million and 10 million developers respectively.  \n\n·       Provides a more efficient execution environment compared to the EVM, resulting in over 10x cheaper computation and 100x cheaper memory usage. These improvements will lead to substantial gas savings for complex smart contracts, making previously impractical use cases feasible.\n\n·       Enables interoperability between Stylus and EVM contracts, allowing developers to call Rust programs from Solidity and vice versa, seamlessly integrating existing infrastructure such as Oracles with new Stylus-based contracts. \n\n·       Extends capabilities of the EVM without altering its core functionality, providing a long-term competitive advantage for Arbitrum by enabling higher throughput, lower costs, and supporting new use cases.\n\n**(B) Application Process**\n\n**Application & Review Windows**\n\nThe Subsidy Fund will run in 1 cohort of 8 weeks consisting of an initial submission period of 2 weeks, followed by a 6-week review period. This will operate on a first-come-first-served basis for application reviews.\n\n**Initial Screening**\n\nTo efficiently handle the anticipated surge in applications and to ensure that the highest quality and most relevant applicants are selected, the below 5 sub-criteria (with the highest weights as mentioned above in the Means Test) will first be applied to all applicants, with the top-scoring applicants moving forward in the evaluation process and being assessed in greater depth:\n\n1\\.\tFunding Gap Rationale\n\n2\\.\tReasonableness of Subsidy Amount Requested\n\n3\\.\tKPIs\n\n4\\.\tEcosystem Contribution\n\n5\\.\tAccountability Measures\n\n**In-Depth Review & Feedback**\n\nProjects that pass the initial screening will undergo a review due diligence (DD) by the ADPC, including interviews and constructive feedback (either individually or on a collective basis).\n\n**Award & Monitoring**\n\nOnce approved, projects receive subsidies, with periodic check-ins and a concluding evaluation to measure impact and success.\n\n**(C) Selection Process & Reporting**\n\nTransparency and continuous dialogue form the backbone of our selection and reporting process, ensuring that each funded project remains aligned with program expectations.\n\n**Reports**\n\nWe will provide updates on our selections and updates on funded projects. These updates will include general project trajectory and progress toward milestones. To create the reports we will set regular monthly check-in dates where projects fill a template/slide in order to give the key info about the project’s status, such as:\n\n·       Summary of Achievements for the Month\n\n·       Funds Utilized\n\n·       Milestones Reached\n\n·       Challenges Faced & Plan of Action\n\n·       Feedback Integration, i.e., how projects have incorporated feedback provided.\n\n·       Next Steps & Priorities\n\n**Output Metrics**\n\nWith the initial priorities in mind, some effective measures for meaningful output will look as follows:\n\n·       **Number of Projects Funded:** Number of projects funded.\n\n·       **Total Funds Allocated:** Cumulative sum of funds distributed, showcasing the program’s financial impact.\n\n·       **Percentage of projects funded in target verticals:** As outlined in the Means Test, the two key verticals we have identified are RWAs & Tokenization and Stylus Adoption.\n\n**Outcome Metrics**\n\nDepending on the final portfolio of funded projects, we will gauge the success rate of awarded projects through specific outcome metrics. While these metrics can be influenced by a wide range of external factors, such as market conditions and individual decisions on a project level, we are committed to supporting and funding the most promising projects to the best of our ability. Metrics include:\n\n·       Percentage of funded projects successfully deployed on Arbitrum\n\n·       Percentage of KPIs outlined in the application achieved by funded projects\n\n**(D) Project Allocation**\n\nOur approach to subsidy fund allocation focuses on achieving high impact while ensuring that a de minimus number of projects obtain funding.\n\nTo ensure that the subsidy is spread across a large number of projects rather than concentrated in several larger projects, the maximum subsidy to be granted will comprise 10% of the subsidy fund available. Therefore, given that the subsidy fund comprises up to $2.5 million worth of ARB, the maximum subsidy that a project can receive will comprise no more than $250K worth of ARB.\n\n**(E) Team Setup**\n\nThe administration and selection process of these subsidies will be managed by the ADPC. Even though the ultimate decision will lie with the judgment of the ADPC, their assessment will be strongly guided by a means test that evaluates key metrics to determine deserving projects.\n\nThe activation of the ADPC to manage the Subsidy Fund will hinge on extending the current 6-month mandate once the Subsidy Fund becomes operational. Should the DAO or the ADPC opt against a continuation of the ADPC, a Subsidy Fund Management Committee will need to be elected. The ADPC will allocate ample time for this process to ensure the Subsidy Fund operation is not reliant on the ADPC’s mandate extension.\n\n**(G) Governance**\n\nThe Subsidy Fund governance aims for transparency, efficiency, and broad community involvement. It outlines mechanisms to ensure fair and balanced decision-making for all stakeholders.\n\n**Multi-Sig**\n\nAll providers must undergo and successfully complete the standard Know-Your-Business (hereinafter referred to as the ‘KYB’) verification processes with the Arbitrum Foundation prior to receiving the service-subsidy.\n\nSubsequently, the designated Multi-sig members, established at the inception of the ADPC and voted in favour of by the ArbitrumDAO, will take charge of disbursing funds to the selected beneficiaries, whereby the transactions will be streamed using Hedgey.\n\nIn recognition of the additional responsibilities undertaken, each of the five multi-sig wallets is proposed to receive a supplementary compensation ranging from 500 ARB - 1,000 ARB monthly.\n\nIt is also important to note, as per the ratified proposal which led to the formation of the ADPC, that the ArbitrumDAO has the authority to claw back funds from the ADPC’s multi-sig wallet using the [<u>Zodiac Governor Module</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrumdao-procurement-clawback-capability), if necessary.\n\n**Flows of Funds**  \n\nThe $2.5m worth of ARB will be going to an Arbitrum Foundation controlled wallet (0x40FcE28C9f3a0d7B75B917C95960D61D930dCA54) to be converted to an ideal stablecoin via OTC trading, with the funds then being sent to the ADPC multi-sig as explained above. The flow of funds for the entire program can be understood via the diagram below, as outlined in the [<u>ADPC’s Security Services RFP forum post</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/request-for-proposal-the-adpc-security-services-panel-and-procurement-framework/25031):\n\n<img height=\"467\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXffAEBXfRuoEZxoDAz44sbU5B8dsKbm51vlC1dSWJBxBjHPz3sPkSgaOS29V-qw3dyZ_iWO6RP4qlb97h4NbBR4zSPQB-b0VOqtBm8gBmZOosA0p4bLHy9vwNECpvojQGCCFgKGYCX7NbKT5ycXEvEGxDs?key=p_wBOku1sf7Kgrafe-VzeQ\" />\n\n**Checks & Balances**\n\nKindly note that the subsidy fund will be subject to the same checks and balances found within the [<u>procurement committee proposal</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-establish-the-arbitrumdao-procurement-committee/20064), regulated by an agreement entered into by all elected ADPC Members, with the Arbitrum Foundation serving as a counterparty to the agreement. These checks and balances include:\n\n**Conflict of Interest Provision:** ADPC Members will be bound to act in absolute good faith, utmost honesty, refraining from deriving unauthorized profits from their position & disclose conflicts of interest. ADPC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to other ADPC members who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ADPC Members’ involvement in the task in relation to which such ADPC Member is conflicted.\n\nTo sum up, all ADPC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ADPC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.\n\n**Record-keeping and Reporting:** Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ADPC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ADPC’s internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ADPC Administration.\n\n**Duty of Impartiality:** ADPC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ADPC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.\n\n**Obligation of Recusal:** ADPC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project and/or service provider being reviewed by the ADPC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation, facilitation & administration of the applicable procurement process.\n\n**Prohibition of Self-Dealing:** Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.\n\n**Ethical Trading:** Members are required to follow ethical trading standards concerning ARB and any other relevant digital assets.",

      "title": "Improving Predictability in Arbitrum DAO’s Operations",
      "content": "# Improving Predictability in Arbitrum DAO’s Operations\n\n#### Non Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to introduce guidelines for posting proposals to a vote; primarily to reduce delegate fatigue by ensuring that Snapshot and Tally votes are posted at a regular cadence with greater predictability. Rather than formally updating the language of the Arbitrum DAO Constitution, the chosen guidelines can be seen as a common social agreement between delegates. This proposal carries no cost to the DAO, and the guidelines can be implemented by the start of August if passed through a Snapshot vote.\n\n## Motivation\n\nSince its inception, the Arbitrum DAO has voted on over 280 Snapshots and 30 onchain votes. First anticipated almost a [year](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-1-time-management-in-arbitrumdao-governance/15718) ago by Cattin and Seedlatam, as the operations of the DAO continue to grow, a more efficient and predictable governance process is needed to prevent delegate fatigue.\n\n## Rationale\n\nOur team considered several possibilities for structuring Arbitrum DAO’s governance processes. This included creating voting periods organized around a monthly calendar or continuously repeating three week cycles. While both of those structures would greatly increase predictability and allow for the possibility of predetermined rest periods, they each come with tradeoffs:\n\n* Condensing the availability of when a proposal can be posted to a vote creates an incentive to rush proposals. This can be detrimental to overall proposal quality.\n* There is the potential to induce delegate fatigue if there is an overwhelming amount of votes all pushed into one short period.\n  * Limiting the number of votes in each batch opens up further questions on how to prioritize which proposals are included.\n* The DAO has typically [seen](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-create-a-standardized-guideline-for-non-security-council-elections/20915) a 14 day application window for RFPs. Ensuring elections begin in a timely manner post RFP is an additional consideration that adds complexity to any designed structure.\n\nPrevious conversations on the DAO’s process have also included introducing [standard guidelines for elections](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-create-a-standardized-guideline-for-non-security-council-elections/20915) or an Arbitrum Delegate Code of Conduct. These are topics that Entropy Advisors is beginning to work on as well, but in this case we believe it is better to start by leaning on the side of simplicity.\n\nKnowing that more complex structures can always be implemented later, below we propose the adoption of a set day each week for votes to start as well as a holiday break. Both of these would greatly increase predictability for delegates and can be adopted by the DAO without much of an adjustment period.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThis proposal does not seek to alter the language of the Arbitrum DAO Constitution, but rather create an agreed upon social contract between delegates on best practices in regards to posting proposals to a Snapshot or Tally vote.\n\nOur primary objective is to improve predictability and reduce the potential for delegate fatigue. Based on these priorities below are specifications for the two recommended adjustments to Arbitrum DAO’s governance processes.\n\n### Start all votes on Thursdays\n\nBy starting both Snapshot and Tally votes on Thursday, the DAO can not only increase predictability for delegates, but also prevent the scenario where votes begin/end on weekends.\n\nIn order for a Tally vote to start on Thursday, it must be posted on Monday given the 3-day delay from when a proposal is posted until voting begins. Each batch of proposals ready to move to a Snapshot vote can be scheduled beforehand beginning on Monday and through Wednesday. We encourage delegates to post/schedule votes to begin before Thursday at 12 pm UTC. While not a hard deadline, this will help ensure any votes start for a majority of delegates worldwide.\n\nOverall, this allows delegates who don’t follow discussions as closely a few days to see what will be voted on and properly prepare. Additionally, with multiple opportunities each month to move a proposal forward to a vote, the incentive to rush the process is reduced.\n\n### Holiday Break: December 20 - January 6th\n\nImplement a holiday break to ensure delegates have a break and can return refreshed for the new year. During this time it is advised that no new proposals are posted to the forums and only emergency proposals are put up to a vote.\n\n### Optional: Delegate Approval Process\n\nRecently, we have noticed a trend within Arbitrum DAO of delegates waiting until a proposal makes it to a Snapshot for feedback to be given. This has resulted in some proposals being posted to Snapshot prematurely. We assume this is a result of several factors including the increasing amount of topics delegates must stay up to date on and the fact that there are no specific guidelines on how much discussion is required before moving a proposal forward.\n\nIt would likely be very difficult to achieve DAO wide consensus on what specific requirements should be implemented to determine when a proposal is ready to move to a Snapshot vote. Thus a level of subjectivity is required and taking inspiration from procedures within Optimism DAO, a delegate approval process can be adopted.\n\nThere are currently 64 delegates with greater than 500k in voting power (VP), so our recommended threshold for delegate approval is 4 delegates. Once a proposal obtains this threshold it can be considered that there is consensus among enough delegates that it is ready to move forward.\n\nTo signal their support of a proposal, delegates can post a statement similar to the following: “I am an Arbitrum delegate with xx voting power and believe this proposal is ready to move forward to Snapshot”. Delegates should also link their Tally profile so that it is easy to verify their VP.\n\nThis approach introduces its own set of tradeoffs. While it would likely prevent premature proposals from going to a Snapshot vote, it does increase delegate responsibilities and can risk proposals authored by new contributors getting stuck due to the lack of connections to large delegates. Therefore we are presenting this as an option separate from the aforementioned adoptions and would welcome feedback from the community.\n\nTo help encourage delegates to take on this additional responsibility, as part of the [delegate incentive program](https://arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/) a bonus point can be awarded to delegates on Karma who approve a proposal that eventually passes on Snapshot or Tally. This is just a suggestion and something we will leave to the discretion of the Seed Latam team.\n\n### Additional Considerations: Emergency Proposals\n\nIn the event of an emergency proposal that is time-sensitive in nature we recommend that any adopted guidelines be waived and the proposal be put up to a vote immediately. In our opinion, only Constitutional AIPs that relate to security matters should be considered as emergency proposals.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nAny changes made to the DAO’s procedures need to be widely communicated and accessible for potential new members. Otherwise, there are minimal steps needed to implement other than coordinating delegates and helping the DAO adjust to the adopted changes.\n\nEntropy will also be responsible for:\n\n* Adding the agreed upon guidelines to the [Ground Rules Topic](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/ground-rules/10) so that it is easy for new community members to discover and access. Our team will coordinate with the Foundation to make this happen.\n* Adding the holiday break to the Arbitrum DAO [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_4157985d2452dfd8a91b6a36bccab37deb9bffe9053a4b9bcc4e9fff9ef02924%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York).\n\n## Timeline\n\nBelow is a proposed timeline to help ensure a smooth transition and adequate preparation for all delegates and community members.\n\n#### Feedback Period (June 24th - July 11th)\n\nTaking into account GovHack (July 5-7) and EthCC (8-11), we have proposed a longer feedback period so as to not hold a vote when several delegates will be traveling. These events also present an opportunity to gather additional feedback in person.\n\n#### Snapshot: July 11th - 18th\n\n#### Voting Options: Ranked Choice\n\n* FOR: Improving Predictability\n* FOR: Improving Predictability and Delegate Approval Process\n* AGAINST\n* ABSTAIN\n\n#### Preparation Period: July 18th - July 28th\n\nAssuming the proposal passes the Snapshot vote, preparation for the first batch of proposals to align with the new schedule. We recommend that no Snapshot votes are posted after July 21st to help ensure a smooth transition for the first batch to begin August 1st.\n\n#### First Tally Votes Scheduled: July 29th\n\n#### First Batch of Snapshot Votes: August 1st\n\n## Costs\n\nThere are no additional costs to the DAO for implementing this proposal. The primary resources required will be the time required to update and coordinate with delegates on whatever new schedule is decided upon. This will be handled by the Entropy Advisors team.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe wanted to also extend our gratitude to Cattin and the Seed Latam team for providing valuable feedback and assistance with this proposal.",

      "content": "In April 2023, the Arbitrum DAO passed a proposal for diversification of 35 million ARB into stable, liquid and yield bearing assets. \n\nhttps://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/38070839538623347085766954167338451189998347523518753197890888828931691912919\n\nThe committee appointed to examine applications has come out with its list of recommendations. We commend all 30 service providers that submitted an application under the program. After perusal of each application, the final recommendations are as follows (denominated in $ARB tokens);\n\nSecuritize BUIDL - 11 million\nOndo USDY - 6 million\nSuperstate USTB - 6 million\nMountain USDM - 4 million\nOpenEden TBill  - 4 million\nBacked Finance bIB01 - 4 million\n\nThis vote seeks to approve (or reject) the above list of service providers that ArbitrumDAO should use for diversifying its treasury, under the first iteration of the STEP program. A vote in favor instructs the Arbitrum Foundation and program manager to begin the process of executing these recommendations. A vote against will lead to the committee reconvening and examining the reasons posted by delegates to come up with a revised allocation addressing the concerns.",

      "content": "Please view the full proposal text on the attached form post. \n\n[Non-Constitutional] \n\nAfter successfully completing the development of ArbitrumHub.io, we are excited for the next major step.\n\n# Abstract\nBuilding on our earlier achievements, this proposal outlines the next phase for ArbitrumHUB, aiming to solidify its position as the central hub for the ArbitrumDAO community. Our recent progress, detailed in the ArbitrumHub Platform Successful Completion Report 1, demonstrates our commitment to creating a user-friendly platform for community members. This report highlights our initiatives and milestones, showcasing ArbitrumHub as a reliable source for essential information and community engagement within the ArbitrumDAO ecosystem.\n\nArbitrumHub’s vision is to be the go-to destination for comprehensive information about ArbitrumDAO and its initiatives. We aim to offer a unified platform for community updates, meeting information, and insights into upcoming events. Our strategy includes robust community participation, ensuring stakeholders have immediate access to critical information.\n\nThis proposal details the next steps, upcoming features, technical enhancements, and the implementation timeline for ArbitrumHub. Our goal is to establish ArbitrumHub as the ultimate platform, underpinned by strong foundations in security, design, development, research, management, transparency, and incentivized community contributions.\n\nWe will manage the platform and the ArbitrumHUB Twitter account 2 to ensure the community can easily navigate and utilize all resources effectively.\n\n# Motivation\nArbitrumHub addresses the need for a centralized resource within the ArbitrumDAO community. As the ecosystem grows, staying informed and connected becomes increasingly challenging. ArbitrumHub simplifies this by consolidating essential information and resources in one place, offering structured and reliable information.\n\n# Uses of ArbitrumHub:\nReal-Time Updates: Provides and integrates the latest news sources and developments within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nCommunity Interaction Updates: Keeps the community informed about upcoming meetups and interactions.\n\nEvent Coordination: Details events and workshops for easy participation.\n\nSupport and Resources: Offers support for platform-related queries.\n\nEnhanced Visibility: Utilizes social media and newsletters for increased engagement.\n\nComprehensive Resource Integration: Aggregates developer tools, grant information, and other initiatives.\n\nCommunity Participation: Designed to foster incentivized community participation and contributions through meets, events, educational resources, etc.\n\nAmbassador Highlights: Acts as a central directory to provide updates related to ambassador activities and programs, with direct access for ambassadors to keep all their initiatives in one place for easy access.\n\nWe have been active in the community for a long time, but when we started, we faced numerous hurdles in obtaining the information we needed. This is a common issue, resulting in the loss of many new members facing this problem. With ArbitrumHUB, this will be a thing of the past, and ArbitrumDAO will attract many new members. This project is crucial for the continuous growth of the DAO.",

      "content": "# **Please** [**refer here**](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/kwenta-x-perennial-arbitrum-onboarding-incentives-updated/22736) **for the full proposal description**\n\nKwenta, a prominent DeFi application in the Optimism ecosystem, is set to expand to Arbitrum, utilizing Perennial V2, an Arbitrum-native protocol. This joint proposal requests 1.9 million ARB to fund targeted onboarding incentives, aiming to bring Kwenta users to Arbitrum.\n\n* Full LITPP format\n* Ask of 1.9M ARB, down from 4.5M\n* Detailed onboarding incentives methodology & model: quest-style incentives, one targeting a broad base of users, one specifically scaling CAC to target the highest value users\n* Matt from Stable Lab & LTIPP multisig confirmed to handle accountability, in line with STIP.b requirements\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. Onboard New Users to Kwenta on Arbitrum: Target existing Kwenta users from Optimism and Base, sidelined Kwenta community members eager to trade on Arbitrum, and new DeFi or centralized exchange (CEX) traders. The focus is on attracting a large number of users from other ecosystems.\n2. Retain High-Value Users: Encourage recurring usage from the highest value users from other ecosystems (power users), delivering significant value for Kwenta, Perennial, and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.\n3. Mutual Growth: Utilize the combined strengths of Kwenta and Perennial to attract a substantial number of new users to Arbitrum beyond the duration of the grant.\n\nExecution Strategy:\n\n* Flexible Distribution Methods: Utilize both on- and off-chain data, with off-chain rewards distribution for flexibility, adjusting methods based on effectiveness.\n* Kwenta’s Frontend Application: Leverage Kwenta’s active user base to serve direct incentives through customized notifications within the application, facilitating a higher conversion rate.\n* Seamless Migration Experience: Develop a top-tier user experience for migrating to Arbitrum, minimizing costs, clicks, and time required for users to switch chains.\n\nIncentive Model:\n\n1. Targeted Trader Onboarding Incentives:\n\n* Quest 1 (Mass Onboarding): Aim to onboard up to 2,200 users from the past year, offering a reward of up to $50 to cover migration costs and encourage initial trading on Arbitrum. Users must open at least two trades of at least $1,000 each to qualify for the reward.\n* Quest 2 (Active Trader Incentivisation & Retention): A 12-week quest targeting high-value users. Rewards are divided into tiers based on trading volume, with higher rewards for more active users. Weekly multipliers incentivize consistent trading, and users can opt to vest their rewards for higher future multipliers.\n\n1. Targeted Fee Rebates:\n\n* Allocation: 66.6% for existing Kwenta users and 33.3% for non-Kwenta Arbitrum users.\n* Structure: Rebates are pooled and capped at fees paid, preventing wash trading. Distributed weekly, with options for users to vest their rebates for higher future rewards.\n\n1. Liquidity Bootstrapping Incentives:\n\n* Initial Focus: Primarily on ETH and BTC markets, with expansion to other assets based on trader demand.\n* Approach: Incentives to attract efficient liquidity providers, reducing reliance on retail liquidity, aiming for professional market makers with higher leverage to ensure deep liquidity at lower costs.\n\nIncentive Mechanisms:\n\n* Upfront Onboarding Incentives: Help users overcome switching costs with initial rewards, aiming for conversion to recurring users.\n* Weekly Rewards and Loyalty Multipliers: Encourage users to return regularly and increase their rewards through consistent participation.\n* Tiered Rewards and Vesting Options: Provide higher rewards for increased usage and incentivize users to lock their ARB for additional benefits.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\n* Onboarding KPIs: Measure net-new volume and users onboarded.\n* General KPIs: Track trading volume, open interest (taker), total liquidity (maker), and total value locked (TVL).\n\nGrant Timeline and Milestones:\n\n* Month 1:\n  * Focus on onboarding new users.\n  * Target $10M average daily volume and 250 net-new users.\n* Month 2:\n  * Scale up growth in volume and open interest.\n  * Target $25M average daily volume and 400 net-new users.\n* Month 3:\n  * Retain growth and volume.\n  * Target $50M average daily volume and 500 net-new users.\n\nJustification for Grant:\n\n* Net-New Capital and Users: Kwenta aims to onboard hundreds of users and over a billion in monthly volume to the Arbitrum ecosystem, providing significant value compared to other incentive programs.\n* Arbitrum Perps Proliferation: Kwenta’s perps aggregator will enhance the existing perp ecosystem on Arbitrum, fostering competition and efficiency.\n* Distribution for Innovation: Utilize Kwenta’s user base to introduce Arbitrum-native innovations, such as NFT perps and power perps, directly to the market.\n\nAccountability Details:\n\n* Program Manager: Matt from Stable Labs.\n* Multisig Oversight: A 5-out-of-7 multisig team confirmed to handle funds and ensure accountability.\n* Transparency and Reporting: Regular bi-weekly updates, a final closeout report, and adherence to OpenBlock Labs’ data requirements, ensuring detailed tracking and analysis of program metrics.\n\nCommitment to Arbitrum:\n\n* Alignment with Arbitrum Ecosystem: Kwenta and Perennial demonstrate strong commitment through actions such as launching the Kwenta token on Arbitrum, introducing Arbitrum-native products, and maintaining Arbitrum as the core of their ecosystem.\n* Further Actions: Kwenta plans additional initiatives to deepen its relationship with Arbitrum, including innovative product launches and ecosystem participation.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis proposal seeks a one-off grant due to its unique potential impact, aiming to onboard significant new capital and users to Arbitrum by leveraging Kwenta’s existing user base and Perennial's infrastructure. The proposed incentive mechanisms and detailed execution strategy aim to maximize user onboarding and retention, ensuring long-term benefits for the Arbitrum ecosystem.",

      "title": "Pilot Stage – Treasury Backed Vaults research and development",
      "content": "[Non-Constitutional] \n\n**TL;DR**\n\nWhat this proposal does:\n\n* Give Arbitrum DAO more options for doing grants in stablecoins, making long term investments using stablecoins, and having safer access to capital without needing to sell treasury assets like ARB tokens.\n* Design and build a system for borrowing stablecoins that prevents liquidations via more assets being pulled from the treasury to increase collateralization.\n* Release that Treasury Backed Vault system publicly as a public good which can be used on any stablecoin protocol.\n* Complete a security audit on the smart contact code for the TBV, and a thorough risk assessment.\n* Report the findings and parameter recommendations to the DAO.\n\nWhat this proposal does **NOT** do:\n\n* Give allowances to move ARB from the treasury to any CDP protocol.\n* Create debt or other positions with DAO funds.\n\n# Abstract \n\nThis pilot stage proposal seeks to complete Research & Development, as well as a comprehensive risk analysis, on a new Treasury Backed Vault (TBV) system which gives Arbitrum DAO the option to borrow stablecoins from existing protocols against ARB, with extremely reduced liquidation risk. It expands on existing discussions/designs of “DAO Owned Liquidations” for CDP protocols. Liquidations are always prevented by automatically pulling more collateral from the DAO treasury, increasing the collateral ratio of the loan.\n\n### Pilot Phase\n\nThis pilot is designed to give the DAO sufficient information to make an informed decision regarding borrowing stablecoins against assets in the treasury, and the confidence to use our proposed solution safely.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Arbitrum community is seeking ways to more efficiently and effectively use the capital in the treasury. The strategies for grant programs, Mergers and Acquisitions, long term investments, and treasury sustainability seek sustainable solutions that minimize required sell pressure on the ARB token.\n\nThe treasury currently has about $3.8B USD worth of ARB tokens. Long term diversification of this is key, but the community also needs access to capital now for grants, treasury management, M&A, and more. Developing an alternative strategy for accessing stablecoins gives Arbitrum DAO more options and power.\n\n# Key Terms\n\nCDP - Collateralized Debt Position. A type of financial primitive used by protocol like Maker, Open Dollar, Reflexer, etc.. Collateral backs stablecoins with required loan to value ratios.\n\nLiquidation - an event which happens when the value of collateral backing a loan is less than the value of the loan, or below a required threshold. This forces the collateral to be sold in order to pay back the debt.\n\n# Specifications\n\nThe DAO should have the option to borrow stablecoins against its ARB and other future assets. However, using traditionally structured lending protocols creates too much risk of liquidation. Our proposed solution is a Treasury Backed Vault that severely limits the liquidation risks and lets the community achieve its goals with open access to its capital.\n\nLiquidations are mitigated by a “savior module” connected to a CDP position. The savior module adds an additional step between a vault being marked for liquidation and becoming liquidated. The module automatically pulls more ARB tokens directly from the DAO treasury (or elsewhere), adds them to the collateral of the position until it is raised above the liquidation threshold, and completely prevents liquidations from occurring. Any time liquidation on the DAO’s position is called, the savior activates first. The module contract would be given an allowance of ARB tokens by the Treasury to spend, allowing the Arbitrum DAO to completely control and at any time update the bounds of how many tokens can be pulled from the treasury.\n\nExample usage of Treasury Backed Vaults:\n\n1. Arbitrum DAO deposits 1,000,000 ARB, worth $1,500,000 in a CDP protocol like Open Dollar or others where Treasury Backed Vaults are enabled.\n2. Arbitrum DAO gives a TBV savior module permission to spend an additional 1,000,000 ARB, which remains in the DAO treasury. The DAO sets parameters with the savior.\n3. Arbitrum DAO borrows 1,000,000 stablecoins worth $1,000,000\n4. Due to market conditions, the price of ARB drops 33% suddenly, and the position is under the required collateralization ratio. It is now up for liquidation.\n5. Anyone calls the public function to liquidate the position. The vault is marked for liquidation.\n6. Before liquidation occurs, the savior module is automatically called. It has been set with specific parameters by the DAO to pull an additional 1,000,000 ARB from the treasury and deposit it in the vault.\n7. The position now has 2,000,000 ARB deposited in it, and is safely over the collateralization requirements. No liquidation happens and no additional votes were required to manage the position safely.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nThe implementation is essentially split into 4 phases\n\n1. Research and Development\n\nA team of 3 solidity developers design, build, and document Treasury Backed Vaults with support for Arbitrum DAO specifically in mind.\n\n2. Risk Analysis\n\nA team of 2 financial analysts complete a report on suggested parameters and the greater ecosystem impact of different borrowing scenarios for Arbitrum DAO. This will come with many helpful recommendations that future delegates can lean on to make proposals to use the vaults how they choose.\n\n3. Audit\n\nA public audit contest will be conducted and managed by our team to review the security of the smart contracts of the TBV. This is important to complete at this stage because we want the DAO to be able to feel confident in the readiness of the system. A formal security report will be published and summarized in a post to the DAO. Audit reward recipients will be required to complete compliance and KYC before receiving funds.\n\n4. Reporting\n\nAt the end of the pilot a report will be made to the DAO that includes results of the security audit, documentation on using TBVs, and results of the risk analysis. The report will include recommendations like how much ARB should be allowed to be pulled by a TBV to limit risk, how many stablecoins could safely be borrowed at a time if the DAO should choose to use the TBVs, how much sell pressure on ARB could be avoided in different scenarios, suggested collateralization settings, and other parameters for real usage.\n\n# Timeline\n\nOverall time to project completion: ~2.5 months\n\nResearch and Development, done asynchronous with risk analysis reporting: 1.5 months\n\nSecurity audit and reporting: 2 weeks\n\nComplete report for the DAO and documentation on usage: 2 weeks\n\n# Team\n\nResearch and development will be completed by a designated team made up on contributors to Open Dollar and led specifically by [CupOjoseph](https://github.com/cupojoseph) & [Pi0neerpat](https://github.com/pi0neerpat). Open Dollar is the largest Arbitrum native stablecoin protocol by TVL. We will also oversee the third party audit of the code that is developed, and personally present the risk analysis (including recommendations) to the DAO at the end of the pilot.\n\n# Overall Cost -\nTotal cost: **250,000 ARB**\n\n### Breakdown\nResearch and Development: 125,000 ARB\n\nIndependent Security Audit: 50,000 ARB\n\nRisk Analysis Report: 50,000 ARB\n\nAdministrative: 25,000 ARB\n\nRemaining or unspent funds will be returned to the DAO treasury promptly.\n\nThank you!! Please support our proposal, we think this could be a huge unlock for the DAO and a powerful tool to add to the community’s toolbox. We appreciate any further feedback on and off the forum on this proposal and the Treasury Backed Vaults concept overall.\n\n## Helpful links:\n\n[Treasury Backed Vaults Overview from Open Dollar](https://www.opendollar.com/treasury-backed-vaults)\n\n[Original DAO Owned Liquidations post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/dao-owned-liquidations-using-collaterized-debt-positions/21109/2)\n\n[Arbitrum Treasury Sustainability Group discussion on DAO Owned Liquidations](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-treasury-and-sustainability-working-group/18978)\n\n[Existing proof of concept implementation](https://github.com/open-dollar/treasury-backed-vault-savior). That's right, we already started building. :sunglasses:\n\nEDIT:\nBased on the feedback so far we will publish this week a list of specific research and modeling questions that should be answered in the risk analysis report.\n\n## Risk Analysis Report Topics\nA list of topics, as requested by the community, that will be covered in the report. Each will have a model of different scenarios and specific recommendations to take on short, medium, and long term time horizons.\n\n- Over-Collateralization Ratio requirements for loans are different sizes\n- Interest rate settings for loans are different sizes\n- Loan sizes based on different market conditions (including worst case scenario)\n- Propose Debt ceiling requirements on CDP protocols that integrate TBV\n- Sell pressure situations on the stablecoin\n- Strategies for paying down debt long term given different market situations\n- Percentage of the stablecoin which is backed by TBV or ARB token versus baskets of other assets\n- Outline Mechanism for reporting on the health of TBV positions",

      "title": "AIP: Funds to bootstrap the first BoLD validator - Operational cost sentiment.",
      "content": "## Non-Constitutional Proposal\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is seeking 900 ETH, made up of:\n- **Service fees**. 500 ETH to pay proposers who are actively participating and advancing the chain.\n- **Refund L1 gas costs**. 400 ETH to reimburse all L1 gas costs for proposers who are actively advancing the chain and defending against malicious challenges, assuming 1 challenge per year.\n\nThis proposal is contingent on the AIP [upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232) being approved by the ArbitrumDAO. If the AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD doesn’t pass - the Arbitrum Foundation will return these funds, to the ArbitrumDAO within 30 days.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD only proposes the technical upgrade and intentionally does not yet introduce an economic incentive mechanism to grow the validator set (since Arbitrum only needs 1 honest, active proposer at any point in time). Without this incentive, the ArbitrumDAO holds the risk that no entity will fulfill the role of being the first honest party to secure Arbitrum One. By adopting this proposal, the ArbitrumDAO is appointing the Arbitrum Foundation to be the first active proposer for Arbitrum One.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n- **Active proposer**. A proposer who is actively posting assertions and helping advance the chain. Validators are not considered active proposers until they successfully propose an assertion with a bond. Subsequent assertions posted by the same address will simply move the already-supplied bond to their latest proposed assertion. There can only be 1 “active” proposer at any point.\n- **Assertion**. A claim posted to the Arbitrum rollup contracts on Ethereum L1 about the Arbitrum L2 execution state.\n- **Assertion bond**. Creating an assertion in the rollup contracts requires the proposer to join the validator set by putting up a bond, in the form of 3,600 ETH. Subsequent assertions posted by the same party do not require more bonds, instead, the protocol always considers validators to be bonded to their latest posted assertion until they withdraw.\n- **Challenge bond**. The challenge process in BoLD requires a proposer to post a bond whenever they want to challenge a malicious (and invalid) assertion from a dishonest proposer. This applies to the block level, big-step sub-challenge, and one-step sub-challenge levels, as part of the interactive dispute game played between challengers.\n- **One honest party**. In BoLD, a single, honest party can protect the integrity and liveness of the system. While only a single party is required to act, it is still an open and permissionless system, allowing anyone to step up at any time.\n- **Proposer**. An agent who looks up the list of ordered transactions, executes them off-chain, and then proposes a claim on the final execution output by posting an assertion on-chain. A proposer *must* have a bond deposited into the BoLD rollup contracts on Ethereum to be considered eligible, by the protocol, to post assertions.\n- **Service fee**. A fee for proposers who are actively and successfully posting on-chain assertions which should amount to the same income that Ethereum validators receive over the same time period. This fee removes the disincentive to lock up capital and be a proposer for the protocol and should not be viewed as an incentive or reward.\n\n## Budget Request\n\n### Service Fees for BoLD Validators\n\nAll blockchains, including Arbitrum One, should compensate participants who actively work to progress the chain.\n\nFor Arbitrum One, the [BoLD AIP](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232) proposes that the DAO pay a service fee to an active proposer who is advancing the chain by posting assertions. If approved, the service fee will correlate to the same annualized income earned by a validator on Ethereum mainnet, which at the time of writing is approximately 3% to 4% of the staked ETH per year ([Composite Ether Staking Rate benchmark by CoinDesk Indices](https://www.coindesk.com/indices/ether/cesr)). \n\nNOTE: This payment is a fee and not a reward. In both the currently deployed protocol and in BoLD, a new assertion is posted every hour and only the time that the proposer is considered actively bonded will be used to determine the fee amount. Additionally, proposers are only eligible for this fee when their assertion is confirmed. There can be multiple actors who deposit the required assertion bond and run a proposer, but the fee will only be paid to the proposer whose assertion is the first to be accepted on L1 (i.e. active).\n\nWe estimate the following service fee per year:\n- Assuming a 4% service fee based on the 3600 ETH bond size, equates to a maximum of 144 ETH per year per active proposer (at this assumed rate).\n\nThe Foundation therefore requests 500 ETH to support service fee payments for up to 3 years (144*3 years plus a buffer of 68 ETH) in the event that an active proposer, who is not the Arbitrum Foundation, steps up to advance the chain. \n\nTo learn more about service fees, check out the [forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#service-fee-for-active-proposers-7).\n\nNote: The Arbitrum Foundation will NOT be entitled to receive the service fee since the Arbitrum Foundation is proposing to use the ArbitrumDAO’s funds.\n\n### Reimbursement of L1 Gas Costs\n\nThe Foundation is requesting 400 ETH to reimburse the on-chain gas costs for active (and honest) proposers who are helping advance and defend the Arbitrum chain. It is estimated that 400 ETH will be sufficient to cover ~3 years of operational costs.\n\nThere are two on-chain gas costs:\n- **Posting assertions**. An active proposer must post an assertion for the chain to advance.\n- **Challenges**. A proposer who is defending the system must participate in a multi-round challenge process.\n\nNote: we only propose to reimburse L1 gas costs since that is publicly verifiable and computable by all. The off-chain costs to run a proposer will not be reimbursed.\n\n#### Estimated Reimbursement Costs\n\nAssuming a nominal gas price of 50 gwei/gas during normal operations (i.e. no challenges) and assuming an elevated 500 gwei/gas price during a challenge (i.e. worst-case scenario), to fully reimburse an honest party’s gas costs the Arbitrum Foundation is requesting 400 ETH for 3 years.\n\nThis includes ~308 ETH to cover the above costs and a ~92 ETH buffer in the event of higher gas prices during normal operations, during a challenge, and/or in the event that there is more than one challenge per year.\n\nTo learn more about these calculations, check out the [forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-funds-to-bootstrap-the-first-bold-validator/24506#reimbursement-of-l1-gas-costs-7).\n\n## Steps to implement & timeline\n\n1. Publication of an AIP to the ArbitrumDAO forums for engaged discussion and debate.\n2. Two separate temperature checks on Snapshot.\n  a. Bond sentiment. Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the Arbitrum Foundation’s request for 4234 ETH to run the first BoLD validator.\n  b. Operational cost sentiment. Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the additional service fee for active proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation) and the reimbursement of L1 gas costs for running an active proposer, totalling 900 ETH.\n3. Depending on the temperature check result:\n  a. Continue to Tally. If there is strong consensus on both temperature checks, then the AIP will be published as one on-chain AIP on Tally for an on-chain vote.\n  b. Re-iterate on numbers. If either temperature check is rejected by the DAO, then it will be iterated on and re-submitted for a temperature check again, until these is consensus.\n4. Assuming a successful vote on-chain, the funds will be transferred to a multi-sig wallet controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n5. The Arbitrum Foundation will then deposit the funds in a validator that will be used to secure Arbitrum One, if the AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD is passed.\n\n## Payment facilitation, final costs & restrictions\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is requesting 900 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO to cover the following costs:\n- 500 ETH as service fees for active BoLD proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation), and,\n- 400 ETH to reimburse honest parties on their L1 gas costs for 3 years.\n\nNotable points:\n- Arbitrum Foundation will not be entitled to the service fee,\n- Arbitrum Foundation will be reimbursed for the L1 gas costs,\n- All service fee payments and L1 gas reimbursements for non-Arbitrum Foundation actors will be manually processed by the Arbitrum Foundation periodically alongside a requirement that all payments adhere to the Foundation’s compliance process.\n\nAll requested funds will be sent to a multi-sig controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation and the funds will be returned if the BoLD proposal is not approved by the ArbitrumDAO. Additionally, after 3 years, any unspent funds from the service fee or gas reimbursements will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO and a subsequent proposal will be posted to help cover the future operational costs of Arbitrum.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO will have the authority to single-handedly return the funds to the ArbitrumDAO treasury by revoking the Arbitrum Foundation’s proposer at any time and returning the bonds back to the treasury. This will be implemented and enforced via the BoLD smart contracts:\n- **Withdrawal Address**. The funds will be deposited into BoLD from the Arbitrum Foundation-controlled multi-sig address but the withdrawal address will be set to the ‘UpgradeExecutor’ contract on L1.\n- **Triggering Withdrawal**. The ArbitrumDAO (via governance) or the Arbitrum Foundation will have the authority to trigger a withdrawal and the funds can only be sent to the pre-established withdrawal address (i.e. the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury).",

      "title": "AIP: Funds to bootstrap the first BoLD validator - Bond sentiment.",
      "content": "## Non-Constitutional Proposal\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is seeking 4,234 ETH, for **Assertion and challenge bonds** - to allow the Arbitrum Foundation to run a BoLD validator and fulfill the role of being the first, but not necessarily the only, honest and active proposer.\n\nThis proposal is contingent on the AIP [upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232) being approved by the ArbitrumDAO. If the AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD does not pass - then the Arbitrum Foundation will return these funds, to the ArbitrumDAO within 30 days.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD only proposes the technical upgrade and intentionally does not yet introduce an economic incentive mechanism to grow the validator set (since Arbitrum only needs 1 honest, active proposer at any point in time). Without this incentive, the ArbitrumDAO holds the risk that no entity will fulfill the role of being the first honest party to secure Arbitrum One. By adopting this proposal, the ArbitrumDAO is appointing the Arbitrum Foundation to be the first active proposer for Arbitrum One.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n- **Active proposer**. A proposer who is actively posting assertions and helping advance the chain. Validators are not considered active proposers until they successfully propose an assertion with a bond. In order to become an active proposer for Arbitrum One, post-BoLD, a validator has to propose an L2 state assertion to Ethereum. If they do not have an active bond on L1, they then need to attach a bond to their assertion in order to successfully post the assertion. Subsequent assertions posted by the same address will simply move the already-supplied bond to their latest proposed assertion. Meanwhile, if an entity, say Bob, has posted a successor assertion to one previously made by another entity, Alice, then Bob would be considered by the protocol to be the current active proposer. Alice would no longer be considered by the protocol as the active proposer and once Alice’s assertion is confirmed, then Alice gets her assertion bond refunded. There can only be 1 “active” proposer at any point.\n- **Assertion**. A claim posted to the Arbitrum rollup contracts on Ethereum L1 about the Arbitrum L2 execution state. Each claim consumes messages from the Arbitrum rollup inbox contract that are ordered by the Sequencer.\n- **Assertion bond**. Creating an assertion in the rollup contracts requires the proposer to join the validator set by putting up a bond, in the form of 3,600 ETH. Subsequent assertions posted by the same party do not require more bonds, instead, the protocol always considers validators to be bonded to their latest posted assertion until they withdraw.\n- **Challenge bond**. The challenge process in BoLD requires a proposer to post a bond whenever they want to challenge a malicious (and invalid) assertion from a dishonest proposer. This applies to the block level, big-step sub-challenge, and one-step sub-challenge levels, as part of the interactive dispute game played between challengers.\n- **One honest party**. In BoLD, a single, honest party can protect the integrity and liveness of the system. While only a single party is required to act, it is still an open and permissionless system, allowing anyone to step up at any time.\n- **Proposer**. An agent who looks up the list of ordered transactions, executes them off-chain, and then proposes a claim on the final execution output by posting an assertion on-chain. A proposer *must* have a bond deposited into the BoLD rollup contracts on Ethereum to be considered eligible, by the protocol, to post assertions.\n- **Service fee**. A fee for proposers who are actively and successfully posting on-chain assertions which should amount to the same income that Ethereum validators receive over the same time period. The fee is paid for every on-chain assertion posted by the proposer once their assertion is confirmed. This fee removes the disincentive to lock up capital and be a proposer for the protocol and should not be viewed as an incentive or reward.\n\n## Budget Request\n\n### Assertion and Challenge Bonds\n\nThe Foundation is requesting 4,234 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO treasury to cover the bonds required to establish a single honest proposer with the capability to defend the system.\n\nThe requested ETH is a combination of:\n- 3600 ETH required to post an assertion bond, and;\n- Subsequent 555 ETH + 79 ETH for challenge bonds for one challenge.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation will deposit these funds in the [RollupCore.sol] contracts on L1 Ethereum for the validator. If the [BoLD AIP](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232) passes, then the Arbitrum Foundation’s staked validator will be enabled to immediately act as a proposer for Arbitrum One.\n\nNote: the Arbitrum Foundation is proposing to be the first active proposer, not the ONLY proposer. BoLD removes the reliance on a permissioned set of validators who are eligible to be proposers, and any interested parties and/or teams can permissionlessly run validators to become proposers for Arbitrum One upon a successful upgrade of the dispute protocol.\n\n## Steps to implement & timeline\n\n1. Publication of an AIP to the ArbitrumDAO forums for engaged discussion and debate.\n2. Temperature checks on Snapshot.\n  a. Bond sentiment. Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the Arbitrum Foundation’s request for 4234 ETH to run the first BoLD validator.\n  b. Operational cost sentiment. Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the additional service fee for active proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation) and the reimbursement of L1 gas costs for running an active proposer, totalling 900 ETH.\n3. Depending on the temperature check result:\n  a. Continue to Tally. If there is strong consensus on both temperature checks, then the AIP will be published as one on-chain AIP on Tally for an on-chain vote.\n  b. Re-iterate on numbers. If either temperature check is rejected by the DAO, then it will be iterated on and re-submitted for a temperature check again, until there is consensus.\n4. Assuming a successful vote on-chain, the funds will be transferred to a multi-sig wallet controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n5. The Arbitrum Foundation will then deposit the funds in a validator that will be used to secure Arbitrum One, if the AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD is passed.\n\n## Payment facilitation, final costs & restrictions\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is requesting 4,234 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO to cover the following costs:\n- 3600 ETH to run the first BoLD-enabled proposer for Arbitrum One, and\n- 634 (555 + 79) ETH budget to counter one BoLD challenge.\n\nAll requested funds will be sent to a multi-sig controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation and the funds will be returned if the BoLD proposal is not approved by the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO will have the authority to single-handedly return the funds to the ArbitrumDAO treasury by revoking the Arbitrum Foundation’s proposer at any time and returning the bonds back to the treasury. This will be implemented and enforced via the BoLD smart contracts:\n- **Withdrawal Address**. The funds will be deposited into BoLD from the Arbitrum Foundation-controlled multi-sig address but the withdrawal address will be set to the ‘UpgradeExecutor’ contract on L1.\n- **Triggering Withdrawal**.

      "title": "AIP: BoLD - permissionless validation for Arbitrum",
      "content": "This Snapshot vote aims to solicit a temperature check from the ArbitrumDAO on their stance for bringing the BoLD upgrade to Arbitrum One and Nova. BoLD is a new dispute resolution protocol that unlocks permissionless validation for Arbitrum chains and enhances their security by mitigating the risk of delay attacks.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the original [BoLD AIP Forum Post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232) where you will find public audit reports, the BoLD whitepaper (that contain the formal specification and safety proofs), as well as further explanations of how BoLD works (including an overview of BoLD’s economics, spam prevention, rewards, reimbursements and penalties) and its proposed design for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\n## Constitutional Proposal\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis Constitutional AIP proposes upgrading Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova’s Rollup Contracts to use Arbitrum BoLD and to support a new challenger manager contract on Ethereum. Arbitrum BoLD is a new dispute resolution protocol that’s designed to replace the existing and currently deployed Arbitrum protocol. If the upgrade is approved, then validators on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova can use the Nitro software to participate in BoLD. BoLD delivers two critical improvements:\n- Unlocks permissionless validation for Arbitrum chains,\n- Enhances the security of Arbitrum chains by mitigating the risk of [delay attacks](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a).\n\nBoLD accomplishes this feat by ensuring that any single honest party can always successfully defend against malicious claims to an Arbitrum chain’s state. BoLD represents the next step on the journey to having the Arbitrum technology stack being recognized as a [Stage 2 Ethereum rollup](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571). The implementation of BoLD will be thoroughly tested to ensure both its effectiveness and safety. The testing plan includes:\n- A comprehensive [audit by Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-04-offchainbold-securityreview.pdf),\n- Deployment of the protocol to public testnets for at least 8 weeks,\n- A public [audit program](https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-05-arbitrum-bold),\n- [Publication of mathematical safety proofs and formal specifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10491).\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO should consider approving this AIP as BoLD delivers critical security and decentralization improvements for Arbitrum One and Nova that benefit all Arbitrum users, Arbitrum node operators, dApps on Arbitrum, and Arbitrum bridges. These benefits can be extended to any Orbit chain that wishes to adopt BoLD.\n\nMore specifically, this new dispute resolution protocol brings the following benefits to Arbitrum chains:\n- Permissionless validation\n- Fixed delay time for assertion confirmation\n- Security Council Safety-First Approach\n\nMore details on these benefits can be found in the [Motivation section of the original proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#motivation-2).\n\n## Rationale\n\nEnabling permissionless validation has been a long-term goal of Arbitrum on the [progressive journey towards decentralization](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization).\n\nBoLD mitigates the risk of delay attacks on Optimistic Rollups by ensuring challenges can be resolved within a fixed time period as long as there is an honest party involved. This particular change unlocks permissionless validation, enabling any well-resourced honest party or parties to defend and protect Arbitrum from malicious actors.\n\nMore details on the community values that this proposal supports, can be found in the [Rationale section of the original proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#rationale-3).\n\n## Implementation, Formal Specification, and Safety Proofs\n\nThe following link, [BoLD Implementation Deep Dive](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/TechnicalDeepDive.pdf), explains how BoLD is implemented and how it works at a high level. To read about the formal specifications and mathematical safety proofs for the protocol, check out the [official BoLD whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10491).\n\n## Economics of Disputes, including the cost to participate, rewards, and penalties\n\nThe economics behind BoLD are carefully researched and designed to optimize for the security of the protocol while keeping costs reasonable for honest parties. More details on this topic can be found in the [Economics section of the original proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#overview-of-bolds-economics-and-spam-prevention-5) and this short paper on the [Economics of Disputes in BoLD](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/Economics.pdf). \n\n## Technical Risks\n\nSome of the technical risks of the BoLD upgrade include:\n- Issues preventing liveness of challenges due to smart contract bugs in the new contracts. For instance, no honest validator able to make a move when it should be able to;\n- Safety issues where a malicious party is able to game the system and win due to logic errors in smart contracts;\n- Logic bugs in the assertion smart contracts that could affect assertion confirmation and posting, which could delay withdrawals until it is fixed; and\n- Bugs in bonding logic in the smart contracts that could lead to loss of funds due to logic errors in the Arbitrum Rollup and challenge manager smart contracts.\n\nRisks that remain the same between the current Arbitrum Rollup protocol and BoLD:\n- Bugs in the one step proof logic: BoLD does not change how one step proofs work for Arbitrum chains.\n\n## Timeline and steps to implement BoLD for Arbitrum One and Nova\n\nBelow is a list of initiatives to ensure the new BoLD dispute resolution protocol is ready to be reviewed and voted on by the ArbitrumDAO for adoption in Arbitrum One and Nova. Feedback from the community and any findings from testing will be collected and used to inform decisions and evolve BoLD along the way.\n\n1. Deployment of a public testnet with BoLD validators for a minimum of 4 weeks\n  a. Check out this guide on [how to deploy a BoLD validator on the testnet](https://github.com/offchainlabs/bold-validator-starter-kit) to begin testing out permissionless validation using Arbitrum technology!\n2. The submission of the AIP in the format of a [forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232).\n3. [Audit of the protocol’s implementation by Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-04-offchainbold-securityreview.pdf)\n4. Hosting of governance calls to talk about BoLD to answer questions from the community about BoLD and this AIP.\n5. This formal temperature check proposal to activate BoLD on Arbitrum’s Sepolia for a minimum of 4 weeks, be made via a Snapshot vote.\n6. Kick-start a [public audit program](https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-05-arbitrum-bold).\n7. Finalize pre-mainnet requirements, including:\n  a. Publication of BoLD migration documentation for existing validators;\n  b. Deployment of a monitoring stack to view on-going challenges on an Arbitrum chain; and\n  c. Publication of a formal procedure for The Arbitrum Foundation to handle L1 gas costs reimbursements for honest parties.\n8. Formal AIP gets submitted to Tally.\n9. Should the formal on-chain proposal pass, BoLD will activate on Arbitrum One and Nova.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nThere is no cost for this proposal to the ArbitrumDAO as Offchain Labs, Inc. will incur all engineering and audit costs to complete the implementation of BoLD and get this new dispute resolution protocol into a mainnet-ready state. Currently, future development work for BoLD is expected to also be undertaken by Offchain Labs, Inc.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe confirmation timing on any withdrawal that is in-flight when the proposed BoLD upgrade is activated will be delayed until the first BoLD assertion is confirmed. This means that for any Arbitrum chain that upgrades to use BoLD, including Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, all pending withdrawals to L1 Ethereum that were initiated before the upgrade will be delayed by 1 challenge period, plus the time between the withdrawal was initiated and the time that the BoLD upgrade takes place. This is because the upgrade effectively “resets” the challenge period for that are not yet finalized.\n\n## FAQ\n\nFor additional topics & questions, please visit the BoLD specific FAQ document [here](https://www.notion.so/arbitrumfoundation/Arbitrum-BoLD-FAQ-93210f430a6a470792496be040ac9990).",

      "title": "[NON-CONSTITUTIONAL] Pilot Phase: Arbitrum Ventures Initiative",
      "content": "![AVI Baner small.png](ipfs://bafybeih4mikfnicnv4svk2ejmqck63ngenuulgm7dclxvbdgvveswzwzyi)\n\n### TLDR\n>We are proposing a pilot of the Arbitrum Ventures Initiative\n> Scope:\n>1.  A 2-month pilot sprint of the core team focused on executing the market consultation part of the scope.\n>2. Running a series of online and IRL events before, during and after the 2 month sprint dedicated to the creation of an Arbitrum Ecosystem Investment Thesis. This thesis will help integrate the various investment initiatives already being run or proposed to the DAO.\n\n\n### Shortcast\nhttps://x.com/Sinkas_/status/1796573051414302910\n\n### Full proposal text\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-pilot-phase-arbitrum-venture-initiative/24247\n\n## Context:\nThis proposal builds upon discussions during ETHDenver, and a subsequent six weeks of conducting the Arbitrum Venture Initiative (AVI) Working Group.\n\nAs a result of the above, the AVI Working Group has identified existing pain points related to venture development and investment frameworks, and has proceeded to submit this proposal with the intent to formulate an eventual comprehensive go-to-market strategy for the AVI.\n\n\n## Abstract:\nThe AVI team’s mission is to grant the ArbitrumDAO an effective and practical knowledge base so as to equip delegates and future AVI contributors with the necessary toolkit to deploy the AVI Ecosystem Fund (or nomenclature equivalent).\n\n\n\n## Why conduct a pilot phase?\nOperating AVI represents a bold and pioneering initiative for blockchain ecosystems and as such it is also a complex undertaking that involves high capital needs. It also is one of several such initiatives the Arbitrum DAO that require complex stakeholder alignment around setting up legal and governance structures. Thus, it is not appropriate to rush before the relevant structures have been put in place. \n\nAt the same time, there is a significant opportunity cost in not progressing with good velocity on at least the components that can already clearly be acted on. A lean and pragmatic pilot phase to analyze key themes thoroughly and develop the necessary clarity, will provide us with a solid foundation to build on.\n\nA pilot phase will help us derisk the AVI initiative, provide a better understanding of the landscape and options at hand, surface and validate key assumptions, and engage and align key stakeholders. Running a pilot phase will help us refine and optimize our investment strategy to cater to investors and target developers of highest strategic significance and return potential to Arbitrum, while at the same time further fleshing out the next steps and cost assumptions. Ultimately, our goal is to foster iterative learning, robust and effective investment approach, and strong engagement from key ecosystem participants. \n\n\n## Pilot approach\nThe pilot sprint outputs intend to provide the DAO delegates and stakeholders with sufficient information to decide on advancing the Arbitrum Venture Initiative (AVI), or parts of it into the next phase of development. The sprint is designed to fund the operational team for 8 weeks and is the natural progression of our existing Working Group efforts. We will also be hosting the IRL thesis development event and online workshops before and after the core sprint. Thus, producing an overall timeline of up to 18 weeks.\n\nThe sprint will kick off in-depth research and workshops to identify opportunity areas (thesis development).\n\nThe pilot sprint will provide concrete data and analysis from various ecosystem participants and stakeholders. Armed with this information, we will have the strategic perspective (thesis development) ready for AVI’s operation.\n\n### Key Output // Deliverables\n- **Thesis Development Report:**\n  - A detailed thesis report outlining the strategic vision, objectives, and target areas for investment within the Arbitrum ecosystem. This should include:\n    - Identification of key sectors (e.g. within DeFi, Social, Consumer, DeSci, DePIN, etc) and their relevance to Arbitrum.\n    - Analysis of market trends, opportunities, and competitive landscape (while collaborating on any work done by other groups with clear overlap).\n    - Potential impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem and long-term value creation.\n    - Foundational hypothesis development on strategic relevance of key sectors and investee profiles.\n- **Market Consultation Findings:**\n  - A synthesis report from market consultations (Indicators in mind: 30 founders and 15 funds). This should cover:\n    - Insights into market perceptions and expectations.\n    - Identification of potential challenges and opportunities from the perspective of market participants.\n    - Recommendations based on feedback for refining the investment strategy.\n- **Community Engagement and Feedback:**\n  - A summary of community and stakeholder engagement activities, and feedback collected, including:\n    - Details of public events and their outcomes. \n    - Assessment of the effectiveness of alternative community engagement activities.\n    - Summary of feedback from community members and how it has been incorporated into the strategy.\n    - Plans for ongoing community engagement and transparency.\n- **Set of Strategic Recommendations:**\n  - A conclusive set of strategic recommendations for the ArbitrumDAO, encompassing:\n    - A clear roadmap for the next phases of the initiative.\n    - Analyzed specific strategic investment priorities and actionable steps for fund deployment.\n    - Substantiating the above with examples for potential deal warehousing.\n    - Metrics for evaluating the success and impact of the venture capital arm (initial version).\n- **Operational Plan and Budget:**\n  - A detailed operational plan for the next phase of the Arbitrum Venture Initiative. This should encompass:\n    - Timeline and milestones for key activities and deliverables.\n    - Resource allocation and roles of core team members.\n    - Detailed budget breakdown for the pilot phase and anticipated future phases.\n\n\n## Team\nThe AVI team brings deep expertise in the investment landscape (web3-specific and Venture Capital), working with early-stage builders and in ecosystem building (Development Venture Capital) around frontier and emerging technologies.\n\n- **Lino**\n  - 3x founder, 15 years of experience in developing startup ecosystems and specifically through VC instruments with development aspects.\n  - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lvelev/)\n  \n- **Konstantina**\n  - Head of Equity Financial Instruments in a EUR 1.3 billion Fund of Funds, focusing on Venture Capital ecosystem development.\n  - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/konstantina-voynova-5b660575/)\n\n- **Ana**\n  - web3 VC, 8 years of experience in web3, deep expertise in investing through executing 80+ deals as well as actively supporting early-stage founders.\n  - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-maria-yanakieva/)\n\n- **Bart**\n  - Former design researcher and founder with expertise in entrepreneurship education and community-based venture creation.

      "title": "ArbitrumDAO Contribution; Safeguarding Software Developers’ Rights",
      "content": "Abstract & Rationale - This proposal envisages a monetary contribution to DEF & Coin Center from the ArbitrumDAO to continue their policy, litigation & advocacy efforts in relation to open-source software & software developers’ rights.\n\n*Proposal authored by Immutablelawyer from* [*Axis Advisory*](https://www.axisadvisory.xyz/)\\*\\* \n\n**Context & Preamble**\n\nThe digital asset industry has been faced with recent legal challenges in relation to a software developer’s individual freedom to contribute to the development and subsequent deployment of open-source permissionless software. This goes as far back as 1990 when Phil Zimmerman released Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), one of the first openly available public-key cryptography applications that featured end-to-end (E2E) encryption. Zimmerman’s creation prompted a criminal investigation that was eventually dropped, resulting in federal court decisions that protect encryption under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment. This clash on personal privacy became dubbed the “encryption wars.”\n\nOur team over at Axis Advisory has published a write-up that offers contextual information in relation to the above: [Defending Open Source: A United Stand for Developer Rights and Software Freedom 4](https://axisadvisoryxyz.substack.com/p/defending-open-source-a-united-stand)\n\nIn this regard, we are proposing a contribution from the ArbitrumDAO to DEF & CoinCenter to continue their policy & litigation efforts in relation to privacy-enhancement tooling and software developer advocacy. Some of the institutions’ most notable contributions with an industry-wide impact will be noted hereunder:\n\n**COIN CENTER**\n\n1. Coin Center’s case against the Office of Foreign Assets Control about adding Tornado Cash to the OFAC Sanction List, (naturally, Tornado Cash not being a person or entity but a mere set of open-source smart contracts running on the Ethereum Blockchain). Albeit the court ruling against Coin Center in the initial proceedings, Coin Center is currently in the process of appealing the judgment.\n\n\\[Refer: [Coin Center is suing OFAC over its Tornado Cash sanction 2](https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-is-suing-ofac-over-its-tornado-cash-sanction/)].\n\n\\[Refer: <https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flnd.447304/gov.uscourts.flnd.447304.74.0.pdf>];\n\n1. Coin Center’s concerns raised to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) regarding the designation of convertible virtual currency (CVC) mixing as a primary money laundering concern (PMLC). In this regard, Coin Center highlighted the rule’s extensive scope and lack of precedent. They argued that the proposed designation lacks clarity and narrowly tailored definitions, potentially leading to the misclassification of legitimate transactions as criminal.\n\n\\[Refer: [Comments to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network on “Proposal of Special Measure Regarding Convertible Virtual Currency Mixing, as a Class of Transactions of Primary Money Laundering Concern”](https://www.coincenter.org/comments-to-the-financial-crimes-enforcement-network-on-proposal-of-special-measure-regarding-convertible-virtual-currency-mixing-as-a-class-of-transactions-of-primary-money-laundering-conce/)]\n\n1. Coin Center’s letter to the Senate Finance Committee highlighing the need for a regulatory approach that mirrors the successful, light-touch framework applied to the internet. Coin Center advocated for clear taxation guidelines on cryptocurrency transactions, emphasizing the importance of a de minimis exemption for minor gains from every transaction to facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies in daily commerce without undue tax burdens.\n\n\\[Refer: [Coin Center Suggestions to Address Uncertain Tax Treatment of Digital Assets](https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-suggestions-to-address-uncertain-tax-treatment-of-digital-assets/)]\n\n1. Coin Center’s contributions to Roman Storm’s and Alexey Pertsev’s legal defense in relation to the following:\n\n* Roman Storm’s legal dispute in relation to accusations levied against his person on charges of conspiracy to facilitate money laundering, operate an unlicensed money transmitter and violating sanctions \\[Court of New York]; and\n* Alexey Pertsev’s legal dispute in relation to accusations levied against his person on charges of facilitating money laundering \\[Netherlands Court].\n\n**DEFI EDUCATION FUND**\n\nSome of the DeFi Education Fund’s most notable contributions with an industry-wide impact will be noted hereunder:\n\n1. The DeFi Education Fund initiated a legal challenge against a patent held by True Return Systems, LLC regarding blockchain technology, challenging the novelty and validity of its claims. This action reflects DEF’s commitment to preserve the digital assets space’s core values: fostering innovation, ensuring open access, and maintaining an inclusive environment. By contesting what DEF consider to be an overly broad patent, they aim to prevent potential monopolistic control, ensuring the decentralization is not compromised.\n\n\\[Refer: [https://www.defieducationfund.org/\\_files/ugd/84ba66\\_0b48beb0dd404637b4d988988b1bf3fc.pdf1](https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_0b48beb0dd404637b4d988988b1bf3fc.pdf)].\n\n1. The DeFi Education Fund filed a legal complaint along with Beba LLC against the SEC, after they recently created and distributed their ‘BEBA token’ via airdrops. Beba and DEF are seeking legal relief due to concerns that the SEC may classify BEBA tokens as securities, which could end up hindering not only their business operations but also the broader digital asset market. In essence, the DEF are fighting against the SEC’s approach towards digital assets which has become overly broad without adequate rule-making procedures, stifling innovation.\n\n\\[Refer: <https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_3f7a8f2ca6614d7381122cb1beeed4a8.pdf>].\n\n1. The DeFi Education Fund submitted an amicus brief in support of James Harper against the IRS, advocating for the Fourth Amendment rights of cryptocurrency users. DEF emphasizes the need to balance law enforcement’s reach with individual’s financial privacy in the digital realm. They are arguing for a modern interpretation of privacy protections to reflect the realities of digital transactions and the traceability of cryptocurrency activities on public ledgers.\n\n\\[Refer: [DeFi Education Fund Files Amicus Brief In Coinbase Case](https://www.coinlive.com/news/DeFi-Education-Fund-Files-Amicus-Brief-In-Coinbase-Case)].\n\n1. The DeFi Education Fund also contributed to the support of Roman Storm’s legal defense arguing against the novel legal theories proposed by the government under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and money laundering statutes. DEF emphasizes the importance of distinguishing software developers from the actions of third-party users, in order to protect software developers from being held liability for third-party misuse of their open-source.\n\n\\[Refer: <https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_063f9d1fd563466cadfa3f5434f918e9.pdf>].\n\n**OBJECTIVE**\n\n**Coin Center Contribution**\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO is being provided the opportunity to vote & effect a contribution to Coin Center; the leading non-profit research and advocacy center focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency and decentralized computing technologies.\n\nBy way of a brief; Coin Center’s mission is to defend the rights of individuals to build and use free and open cryptocurrency networks: the right to write and publish code – to read and to run it. The right to assemble into peer-to-peer networks. And the right to do all this privately.\n\nCoin Center has been at the forefront of policy research, educating policymakers and the media about cryptocurrencies, advocating for sound public policy, and engaging in litigation to defend digital civil liberties of software developers and other stakeholders within the industry.\n\n**DeFi Education Fund Contribution**\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO is being provided the opportunity to vote & effect a contribution to the DEF whose mission revolves around educating policymakers globally about DeFi, promoting grassroots supports, enhancing legal support across jurisdictions, and advocating for policies welcoming of decentralized financial infrastructure.\n\nThey have initiated several key projects and grants to advance its objectives. One of their initial endeavors targeted a group of organizations and individuals, with the goal of expanding the understanding of decentralization and the DeFi ecosystem among policymakers.\n\nAdditionally, the DEF is taking a stand against how some governments interpret laws in a way that could establish a troubling precedent, potentially discouraging software developers in various fields. They pointed out the risk that developers might face legal action for their open-source code if it is misused by other for illegal activities. This could place developers are risk of being held criminally responsible for actions they didn’t partake in, possibly affecting them years or even decades later.\n\n**CONTRIBUTION TO COIN CENTER \\[A NOTE FROM THE ORGANIZATION]**\n\nFounded in 2014, [Coin Center 4](https://www.coincenter.org/) is an independent non-profit organization focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency and decentralized computing technologies. Our mission is to defend the rights of individuals to build and use free and open cryptocurrency networks: the right to write and publish code – to read and to run it. The right to assemble into peer-to-peer networks. And the right to do all this privately. We do this by producing and publishing policy research, educating policymakers and the media about cryptocurrencies, advocating for sound public policy, and by engaging in litigation to defend digital civil liberties.\n\nWe are presently litigating two cases against the U.S. government. One is on Section 6050I crypto tax reporting, [pushing back against expanded warrantless financial surveillance 1](https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-has-filed-a-court-challenge-against-the-treasury-dept-over-unconstitutional-financial-surveillance/). The other is a civil case [challenging the U.S. Treasury Department’s designation of immutable smart contracts 2](https://www.coincenter.org/coin-center-is-suing-ofac-over-its-tornado-cash-sanction/). We argue that the Treasury does not have the statutory authority to add the Tornado Cash pool contracts to the list of sanctioned persons because immutable smart contracts are neither sanctioned persons themselves nor the property of any sanctioned person. We are fighting not only for the right of U.S. persons to continue using these tools but also seeking to set an important precedent: that the Treasury Department can’t simply identify decentralized apps and add them to the sanctions list without any evidence that the app is controlled by or enriches any sanctioned person.\n\nWe are also coordinating with Roman Storm’s legal defense on an amicus brief in his criminal defense. Our amicus focuses on accurately describing the operation of Tornado Cash and the role that developers play in creating decentralized apps like Tornado Cash. We argue that publishing decentralized app software, both to the blockchain and to web servers, is not the kind of activity that can give rise to prohibitions under U.S. sanctions laws because (a) U.S. sanctions laws exclude from prohibitions any transactions for information or information materials and (b) the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment protects publishing software as “pure speech” warranting the strictest scrutiny from our courts.\n\nFinally, we are [continuously engaged](https://www.coincenter.org/blog/) in education and lobbying efforts in Congress and the various federal agencies in the U.S. to ensure that any changes to financial surveillance law does not impinge the free speech, privacy, and assembly rights of developers and users.\n\nA grant to Coin Center will be used to support our ongoing work and to contribute to the legal defense of developers facing criminal prosecution.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\nIn conclusion, the contributions mentioned above are not just a matter of protecting individual rights but a testament to our collective commitment to preserving the principles of innovation, decentralization, and individual sovereignty within the industry. By supporting this initiative, we affirm our dedication to upholding these principles and defending the right of developers to contribute to the deployment of permissionless open-source software without fear of reprisal or censorship.\n\n**Funding**\n\nAs per the temperature check passed by the ArbitrumDAO on the 24th of April 2024, Coin Center and DeFi Education Fund will receive 500,000ARB each. \n\n**Payment Terms**\n\nThe funds will from this proposal will initially be sent to an account controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation `0x5bb0a919345aF084854BCDc9A6DDdE8b7FEe79aD` , who will handle the transfers to Coin Center and DeFi Education Fund:\n\n60% of the funds will be directly sent to Coin Center and DeFi Education Fund with the remaining 40% being vested in a linear manner with no cliff for a period of 4 months thereafter.",

      "title": "Constitutional AIP - Security Council Improvement Proposal ",
      "content": "### **Abstract**\n\nThis AIP seeks to propose changes to the structure of the security council so Arbitrum can maintain the “Stage 1” designation as per L2BEAT and not fall back to “Stage 0” designation.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nOn December 7, [L2BEAT published an update](https://medium.com/l2beat/stages-update-security-council-requirements-4c79cea8ef52) to the security council requirements for the [Stages Framework](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe). The requirements were updated after a lot of research and feedback to make Stages more formal and precise.\n\n### **Rationale**\n\nUpgrading the security council as per the Stage 1 requirements set by L2BEAT, will help ensure Arbitrum remains decentralized, but properly secured. See ‘Specifications’ for more details.\n\n### **Key Terms**\n\n**Stages:** A framework, inspired by [Vitalik’s proposed milestones](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571), that categorises rollups into three distinct stages based on their reliance on these training wheels. You can learn [more about the Stages framework here](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe).\n\n**Security Council:** A group of 12 individuals who are responsible for addressing risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem through the selective application of **e**mergency actions and non-emergency actions. Learn more in [the ArbitrumDAO Docs](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/security-council).\n\n**Timelock:** Smart contracts which implement a delay between an upgrade confirmation and execution.\n\n**Exit Window:** The actual time users have to exit the system in case of an unwanted upgrade.\n\n### **Specifications**\n\nArbitrum currently has two multisigs and they both contain the same set of members:\n\na) A 9/12 multisig with instant upgrade power\n\nb) A 7/12 multisig that can upgrade with a 3+7+3 days delay\n\nWhile the higher threshold multisig can be classified as a Security Council, the lower one is below the minimum threshold and it’s considered a simple multisig according to the Stages framework introduced above.\n\nFor normal multisigs, L2BEAT requires at least a 7 days exit window for users. The current exit window for Arbitrum is 2 days (see [this thread](https://x.com/stonecoldpat0/status/1737840485967032739?s=20) for a quick explanation).\n\nMoreover, the higher threshold multisig is supposed to stop malicious upgrades attempted by the lower threshold multisig. However, since the member set is the same, if the lower threshold agrees on something there are not enough members in the higher threshold to stop them, which means that the actual security of the upgradeability mechanism boils down to the 7/12 threshold.\n\nFor the above reason, technically, with the updated requirements for Stages, Arbitrum falls back to the Stage 0 designation. Since we know that it takes time to upgrade Arbitrum, we decided to leave the Stage 1 designation with the promise of addressing the above issues in a timely manner. This proposal is about addressing the issues and moving them to be voted on by the DAO.\n\n**Proposed Solutions**\n\n1. The **first solution** would be to remove the lower threshold (7/12) multisig entirely. This can be done in two ways:\n\n* The contract is removed which requires an on-chain upgrade, or,\n* The lower threshold multisig increases its threshold from 7/12 to 9/12 which requires no upgrade.\n   \n  Increasing the threshold gives us the flexibility to restore a lower threshold in the future should the need arise, and it’s also a very quick and easy fix since it doesn’t require an on-chain upgrade.\n   \n  On the other hand, removing the dependency on the lower threshold mutlisig for all the contracts in Arbitrum is a broad and potentially risky change. Therefore we suggest raising the threshold for the time being and revisiting the removal of all the dependencies at a later date if needed.\n\n1. The **second solution** would be to leave the lower threshold multisig as it is, but to increase the exit window to 7 days. In practice, this involves increasing the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days, since there is a 1 day max delay to force transactions on Arbitrum via L1 using the ‘DelayedInbox’. Increasing the L1 Timelock would not be very beneficial due to delay attacks on the fraud proof systems, since, even with BoLD,  the challenge period would end up being up to [16 days](https://x.com/DZack23/status/1737864854059335905?s=20).\n2. The **third solution**, which is not strictly required by the Stages Framework for the Stage 1 designation, is to both remove the lower threshold multisig entirely and increase the L2 Timelock delay so users have more time to exit in case of unwanted upgrades, increasing the security of the system even more.\n\n**Chosen solution:** In the [temperature check vote](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc591f79422bf26faf13055df098142569785c04316fdae5be993e282721eb717) Arbitrum DAO decided to increase the threshold of the non-emergency Security Council to 9/12.\n\n### Steps to Implement\n\nFollowing a week of discussion of this RFC, the proposal will go for a vote on Snapshot with the following 4 options (as they are or slightly adjusted), and/or any additional ones, should they arise from the discussion during the RFC phase:\n\n1. Increase the threshold from 7/12 to 9/12.\n2. Increase the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days.\n3. Increase the threshold and the L2 timelock delay.\n4. Make no changes.\n\nFollowing the temp-check, if any of the aforementioned options apart from No.4 is the most popular, the proposal will move to on-chain vote to execute the proposal.\n\n### **Overall Cost**\n\nThere’s no overhead to the DAO for the implementation of this proposal.",

      "content": "This proposal was completed after a successful [Snapshot 8](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1a9f2097b0b5a0021628e9edb0e7c9bffae4fdbb104f9996463e40a3129c7718) temp check for the Arbitrum DAO to empower gaming with a three year, 200m ARB with the goal of powering the Arbitrum gaming ecosystem with the best studios and games in the web3 industry.\n\nThe temp check showcased the enthusiasm to support web3 gaming, but also revealed important questions to answer when launching an ambitious, multi-year plan requiring not only a strong team to run the program, but transparent, flexible collaboration between many stakeholders.\n\n# Introduction - Gaming Catalyst Program\n\nWhat changed: No changes\n\nThe Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP) is designed to immediately expand awareness and adoption of Arbitrum/Orbit/Stylus by builders and players in the Gaming community.\n\nArbitrum has emerged as a leader in the competitive network race through a dynamic formula of innovation, robust technology, organic builders, and a variety of short and long-term incentives.\n\nThe proliferation of DeFi on Arbitrum showcases how quickly a snowball effect can onboard builders, users, and ultimately value for the Arbitrum DAO and other stakeholders (i.e. Offchain Labs, Ethereum, etc.). The TAM for DEFI has surged to $50B and is projected to surge to over $120B by 2030 and Arbitrum is leading the way.\n\nWe believe that the same opportunity exists to attract the best builders that will in turn create sticky high quality games that bring and retain new users within Arbitrum. The gaming vertical has a $250B TAM today that is projected to grow to $500B+ by 2030. Though the “web 3 + games” segment of today’s game TAM is relatively small, it is poised to grow exponentially this decade.\n\nSeveral L1s and L2s see this opportunity (most notably Solana, Cardano, Opstack, Immutable, Optimism, to name a few) and are moving to claim the builders with grants and investments.\n\n# GCP Hypothesis\n\nWhat changed: Minor language updates\n\nArbitrum has had immense success in the decentralized finance vertical, but the branding of Arbitrum as a home for gamers and game builders is nascent. As a network, Arbitrum falls behind major competitors (Immutable X, Ronin, Solana, etc) across total games migrated, games launched, and total gamers.\n\n[This educational post ](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-and-the-future-of-web3-gaming/21270)shares some of the pain points and metrics within the gaming ecosystem in regards to Arbitrum.\n\nThrough the Gaming Catalyst Program, we aim to establish a dedicated team and fund to provide technical and strategic support to the game industry. This dedicated team is key to attracting and retaining the best established and independent developers.\n\nWe will know we are succeeding when we achieve the following:\n\n## Rapidly Increase the number of Game Developers using Arbitrum/Orbit/Stylus\n\nThe GCP aims to provide support and resources to developers interested in building on the Arbitrum network. This includes access to funding, mentorship by vetted experts, and other forms of assistance to expedite the development process and contribute to success in the market post-launch.\n\n## Strategic Allocation of Resources via Grants and Investments\n\nBy allocating resources strategically, the program can maximize its impact by focusing on proven publishers and developers as well as promising independent projects within gaming. This ensures that resources are used efficiently and effectively to foster the growth of high-quality games on Arbitrum.\n\n## Attracting and retaining Top Talent\n\nJust as DeFi projects have flocked to Arbitrum due to its innovative technology and incentives, the GCP aims to attract the best game developers in the industry. By offering support,incentives and game industry specific tools, Arbitrum can position itself as an attractive platform for game development, leading to a surge in high-quality gaming experiences on the network.\n\n## Expanding the Use Cases of Arbitrum\n\nWhile DeFi has been a major focus of Arbitrum’s success so far, expanding into the gaming vertical opens up new opportunities and use cases for the network. By supporting game and gaming infrastructure development, Arbitrum can diversify its ecosystem and appeal to a broader range of users and developers, with results that include but are not limited to Orbit chain and Stylus adoption.\n\n## Facilitating the Development of Sticky, Quality Games\n\nThe ultimate goal of the GCP is to encourage the development of sticky, high-quality games that not only attract users but also retain them over the long term. A dedicated GCP Team and Council representing the interests of the DAO will serve as quality control mechanisms to make sure the best applicants receive the full support of the GCP.\n\n# Proposal Summary\n\nWhat changed: No changes\n\nWe are asking the DAO to earmark 200m ARB over a three year period to expand the gaming ecosystem on Arbitrum and establish the network as the top choice for game builders across the landscape.\n\nThe GCP is meant to serve as a catalyst, not a comprehensive program, with a focus around onboarding and supporting high quality builders. After the roll out of the GCP, the aim is to use its learnings to mature the organization into a longer-term gaming program with a comprehensive approach to game ecosystem growth.\n\nStrategically, we believe that attracting, retaining, and supporting builders with a dedicated team and an ongoing investment in game developers and the technical solutions they need will be a key differentiating factor vs other competitive networks. This commitment to gaming will lead to high quality game launches that will in turn attract large numbers of engaged gamers.\n\nPart of the fund will be utilized to co-invest into promising studios and games along with approved, Arbitrum-aligned publishers, with the belief that the business model, industry expertise, and track record of publishers will streamline the outreach, vetting, negotiation, onboarding, and support process for builders. The fund will also be available for all other game builders seeking to create games on Arbitrum.\n\n### Controls\n\nPublishers and developers will be subject to a robust set of checks and balances to ensure alignment with this proposal’s goals and Arbitrum DAO’s values:\n\n* A GCP Council of 5 individuals with deep gaming, venture experience, analytics / reporting, and/or DAO governance skills will be elected by the DAO and will be responsible for holding the Catalyst GCP Team accountable - with influence including general oversight, visibility of performance reviews for GCP team members, offering a channel for constructive feedback.\\*\\*\n* A GCP Team will be created with the support of the Arbitrum Foundation, and will collaborate with the GCP Council (which will serve as oversight):\n  * An investment committee of 3 individuals including 1 Council member will approve investments\n  * Funding for projects will be contingent on achieving milestones\n  * A quarterly transparency report will be created with summary data on GCP performance\n  * Funding of projects will include terms that are market competitive\n* Program Outcomes and KPIs\n\nWhat changed: Adjusted KPIs for year 1 and year 2 to account for infrastructure setup time\n\nThe Gaming Catalyst program has an overarching goal to bring in talented builders, and help the builders accelerate their games through the lifecycle stages.\n\nThe highest level metric we will be tracking is studio / builder onboarding into the Arbitrum ecosystem. However, there will be a variance in the realized outcome due to publisher applications, types of builders targeted, and variables from network competition.\n\nPrimary expected outcome:\n\nWithin the initial time frame of the program (3 years), the goal is to establish Arbitrum as a de facto leader for on-chain gaming. Specifically:\n\n* 400-600 applications\n* 100-200 net funded games\n* Win net migrations to Arbitrum vs other L2s\n* 50+ new Orbit launches\n\nThe GCP will take time to reach its full potential, and setting milestones vs maturity of the program is prudent:\n\nKPIYear 1Year 2Year 3Daily Active Users20,00050,000To be set by GCP TeamOrbit Launches520To be set by GCP TeamStudio Deals1020To be set by GCP Team\n\n*Most games will be in dev and not (yet) live in 2024*\n\nThe GCP team will set appropriate OKRs and KPIs internally to align with the goals and milestones listed above.\n\nAn additional outcome that the program aims to achieve is incremental movement through the gaming lifecycles illustrated by the Helika presentation on 2/2/24 [here (slide 15)](https://docsend.com/view/ktydpd3etn2iq2gv) during our open office hours.\n\n# Initiatives & Budgeting\n\nWhat changed: Formatting changes, combined sections for readability\n\nWe are asking the DAO for 200m ARB to develop the gaming ecosystem on Arbitrum and establish the network as the top choice for game builders across the landscape.\n\nThe funding will be allocated towards the following initiatives over the span of a three year period:\n\n## 1. Builder Onboarding & Growth (160m ARB)\n\nFocused on attracting and supporting the best game builders into Arbitrum - open to publishers, established studios, and independent builders.\n\nUse of Funds: This funding is proposed to be reserved for established publishers, game studios and independent builders on Arbitrum to help scale the DAO’s ability to attract, secure, and accelerate talented teams on Arbitrum.\n\nThesis / Experiment: We are allocating a large majority of the budget to empower growth of publishers and studios on Arbitrum.\n\n### Build Grants (25m)\n\nGrants will primarily be used to empower teams that are aiming to accelerate early stage development on Arbitrum, or to incentivize user onboarding. Other grant uses may be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nGuidelines & Details:\n\n* Teams may apply via the GCP Grants form\n* Grants have a maximum size of 500k ARB\n* Preference for user onboarding incentives or early stage development\n* The grants manager has final approval on grants\n  * Scorecards and details must be shared with the GCP Council\n* Proposed: early grants period until legal entity is formed for GCP\n  * Onboard interim grants allocator\n  * Interim council of 5 members votes on individual grants\n  * Maximum allocation of 10m ARB prior to GCP entity formation\n* Each grant must have specific milestones agreed upon before funding\n\n### Investments (135m)\n\nTeams seeking more than 500k ARB or additional funding for development beyond initial development must work with the GCP investment team to align on deal terms.\n\nPublishers may submit multi-game deals to the GCP for consideration - allowing them to be more efficient and create more strategic plans for their ecosystem. As a packaged proposal, publishers and the GCP team may collaborate to set milestones, funding, kpis, etc in aggregate form or by each game, allowing for more flexible launch, development, and operational capabilities.\n\nGuidelines & Details:\n\n* Builders or publishers must agree on a commercial agreement value share through tokens, equity, revenue share (post recoupment), or other pathways.\n  * Other considerations include active use of Orbit chains with significant sequencer revenue share as part of the default licensing structure\n* More detailed deal structure guidelines will be created by the GCP Team upon its formation\n* By the end of the program term, any unused ARB will be returned to the DAO\n\n## 2. Infrastructure Bounties (40m ARB)\n\nFocused on creating game specific tech needed to make Arbitrum the best choice for game builders. Deals will follow grant or investment classifications based on the same sizing requirements as the Builder Onboarding and Growth program.\n\n* Allocated by RFP or decided by the Council on a per proposal basis for any tooling and infrastructure needed to support gaming within Arbitrum (i.e. account abstraction solutions and gasless transactions for games, payment rails, web and game engine SDKs, data analytics and attribution, etc.)\n* Promote Orbit, Stylus, and other development and infrastructure growth on top of new Arbitrum technology releases\n\nUse of Funds: This will be allocated by RFP or per proposal for any tooling and infrastructure needed to further support gaming within Arbitrum (i.e. onboarding documentation, gaming-centric boilerplates for Arbitrum Orbit, game contract libraries built via Stylus, account abstraction and gasless transactions solutions, payment rails for games, web and game engine SDKs (Unity, Unreal, Godot), etc.)\n\nThesis / Experiment: Web3 gaming is still nascent and there exists key gaps for game builders to build games and bring them to market. By incentivizing development for such infrastructure projects and tools, or accelerating development of Stylus as an Arbitrum native framework, this will help set Arbitrum further ahead in the competitive network landscape.\n\nCurrent Gaps: A non-exhaustive list of gaps that currently exist within the Arbitrum ecosystem:\n\n* Custom gaming-centric implementations of Orbit chains\n* Mobile App Infrastructure with wallet that is optimized for games and asset management (See Ronin Wallet on mobile as an example)\n* Web and game engine SDKs (Unity, Unreal, Godot) that allow for in-game contract calls\n* Desktop launcher and distribution solutions\n* Game analytics, optimization, and related tooling (tying together on-chain, off-chain, social, and player activity)\n\nFunding Guidelines:\n\n* The GCP Team will establish initial RFPs and funding guidelines\n* An infrastructure specific rubric will be established by the Council to assess proposals\n* Independent proposals that do not fit within RFP guidelines are welcome to apply separately for GCP Team consideration\n* Any approved applicants for RFPs may be selected for vendor whitelisting, which allows vendors to be marketed to GCP participants\n* By the end of the program term, any unused ARB will be returned to the DAO\n\n# GCP Org Structure\n\nWhat changed: No changes\n\nWhen designing the organizational structure of the GCP, two major dynamics were considered:\n\n1. Enabling autonomy of the GCP team while setting safeguards for program success\n2. Empowering the DAO to have transparency and representation without impacting compliance, disclosure, and other necessities for a grants program with commercial ties within the gaming industry\n\n# <img height=\"317\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/32aa04e5451d1ed33e09b4a6dd9a51620cc5ba14.png\" />\n\n## Decision making process\n\n* Decision is made by GCP team\n  * Investment committee decision, staffing, etc\n* Council meetings every two weeks to discuss / veto any decisions\n* Decision is ‘ratified’ and activated\n* Every half year, aggregate summary of data as applicable shared in a report to DAO\n\n# GCP Team\n\nWhat changed: Added roles / responsibilities, section on entity setup, team incentives, and overall costing estimates.\n\nThe GCP Team will be the primary operator of the GCP program.\n\nTeam members may join the program through a few pathways:\n\n* Nomination through the proposal process (to help accelerate standup of the program)\n* Hiring by the GCP team, with veto capabilities held by the Council\n\nThe below team roles and responsibilities are illustrative of an initial proposed structure, but may change based on industry / program demands.\n\n## GCP Team Roles & Responsibilities\n\nThese roles are understood to be the MVP in order to stand up successful programming.

programming and start funding talented teams within a reasonable time frame, we propose the following phases.\n\n## Phase 1: Early Activation (1-2 months)\n\n* Focus/Goal: Establish core operational framework.\n* Activities:\n  * Finalize entity setup for legal compliance.\n  * Working Group selects two interim council members with relevant expertise (gaming, industry influence, venture capital, DAO governance).\n  * Working Group, in collaboration with the interim council, selects initial team members for critical roles (Program Director, Analyst).\n  * Develop and present a clear timeline for council elections and full team buildout.\n\n## Phase 2: Program Development (2-4 months)\n\n* Focus/Goal: Build operational infrastructure and initiate program activities & tactics.\n* Activities:\n  * DAO elects remaining three council members & votes to confirm/reject interim council members.\n  * Establish key program infrastructure: website, grant application process, communication channels.\n  * Issue first RFP for infrastructure development.\n  * Open grant applications for game developers and studios.\n  * Develop initial marketing, brand, and outreach strategy (this includes identifying agency partners if needed).\n  * Finalize onboarding process for funded projects (includes research and team/project leader interviews).\n  * Begin recruiting for additional team members based on a prioritized hiring plan (which will be clarified early phase two).\n\n## Phase 3: Program Acceleration (4-6 months)\n\n* Focus/Goal: Achieve momentum, establish presence, and

      "title": "AIP: Activate Stylus and Enable Next-Gen WebAssembly Smart Contracts (ArbOS 30)",
      "content": "## Constitutional Proposal\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis AIP outlines a path toward activating Stylus on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. Stylus is an upgrade that introduces a new virtual machine that runs alongside the EVM. This enables developers to write smart contracts in new programming languages, like Rust, that are more efficient than Solidity smart contracts.\n\n## Motivation\n\nStylus is a first-of-its-kind technology resulting from breakthrough engineering efforts in the Arbitrum ecosystem. Unlike other alternative VMs, Stylus is purely additive to the EVM. This means that Stylus contracts and EVM contracts are fully interoperable.\n\nSome defining features of Stylus include:\n\n- Preferred Languages: There are [estimated](https://research.slashdata.co/reports/65b90140343d024fbe70f369) to be roughly 20k Solidity developers, compared to 3.5 million Rust developers and 10 million C++ developers. Developers can use their preferred programming language, all interoperable with each other, on any Arbitrum chain with Stylus. Scaling to the next billion users requires onboarding the next million developers.\n- EVM+: Stylus brings the best of both worlds. Developers still get all of the benefits of the EVM, including the ecosystem and liquidity, while getting efficiency improvements and access to existing libraries in Rust, C, and C++ — without changing anything about how the EVM works. EVM equivalence is no longer the ceiling; it’s the floor.\n- Cheaper Execution: Stylus is a more efficient execution environment than the EVM, leading directly to gas savings for complex smart contracts. Computation can be over 10x cheaper, and memory can be over 100x cheaper. Cryptography libraries can be deployed as custom application layer precompiles, permissionlessly. Use cases that are impractical in the EVM are now possible in Stylus.\n- Safer By Design: Stylus doesn’t just improve on cost and speed. WASM programs are also safer. Reentrancy is a common vulnerability that developers can only attempt to mitigate in Solidity. Stylus provides cheap reentrancy detection, and using the Rust SDK, reentrancy is disabled by default, unless intentionally overridden.\n- Fully Interoperable: Solidity programs and WASM programs are completely composable. If working in Solidity, a developer can call a Rust program or rely on another dependency in a different language. If working in Rust, all Solidity functionalities are accessible out of the box. This means your Rust smart contracts can rely on primitives and infrastructure (such as oracles) that were built using Solidity.\n\nSeveral exciting teams have been building their apps on the Stylus testnet for the past few months. These apps would simply not be possible on Arbitrum without the added efficiency or new language support. Stylus can onboard (1) the next generation of developers from alternate VM ecosystems and (2) new use cases that users cannot experience on EVM chains.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis proposal is aligned with the Arbitrum community’s mission and values:\n- Ethereum-Aligned: Stylus does not change anything about how the EVM works. Rather than replacing, Stylus is completely additive and extends what is possible in the EVM.\n- Sustainable: More efficiency at the execution layer can give Arbitrum chains long-term competitive advantages by allowing higher throughput, cheaper costs, and new use cases that are not possible on other EVM chains.\n- Accessibility: Arbitrum can become the home for new types of developers who don’t know Solidity. This includes Rust, C, C++, and any other programming language that compiles to WebAssembly.\n- Inclusivity: The Stylus SDK is 100% open-source, meaning developers are free to fork, modify, and contribute to the core patterns that the SDK represents.\n- Empowerment: The parameters defined in Stylus are fully configurable by the Arbitrum DAO (for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova) and individual Orbit chains. These customizations can supercharge Stylus by, for example, dropping activation prices, increasing contract size limits, and lowering opcode pricing.\n\n## Key Terms\n\nStylus: A new programming environment, including a WebAssembly-based virtual machine, a CLI, and a canonical SDK that defines the patterns and frameworks for writing smart contracts.\n\nWebAssembly (WASM): WebAssembly is a modern binary format used in significant web standards, browsers, and companies to speed up computation. Built to be fast, portable, and secure.\n\nVirtual Machine (VM): The software that executes smart contracts and processes transactions.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe Stylus VM and fraud prover have been developed as a fork of the Nitro codebase. These repositories will be merged into the main branch of Nitro if the Arbitrum DAO approves the AIP:\n\nThe Stylus VM and fraud prover have been developed as a fork of the Nitro codebase. These repositories will be merged into the main branch of Nitro if the Arbitrum DAO approves the AIP:\n\n- stylus: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus)\n  - Fork of [GitHub - OffchainLabs/nitro](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro)\n  - Includes node software, VM, and Fraud Prover\n- stylus-geth: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-geth](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-geth)\n  - Fork of [GitHub - OffchainLabs/go-ethereum](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum)\n  - Includes the execution client and databases\n- stylus-contracts: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-contracts](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-contracts)\n  - Fork of [GitHub - OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts)\n  - Includes rollup and fraud proof smart contracts\n\nThe Stylus VM is not a replacement for the EVM. Instead, the two VMs work together to facilitate state transitions, each playing their part in executing their respective bytecode. EVM contracts written in Solidity still use Geth’s EVM exactly as before, ensuring EVM equivalence. In other words, Stylus is entirely additive — a paradigm called EVM+.\n\nStylus contracts can be written using the Stylus SDK, which employs Solidity-equivalent ABIs and storage patterns to ensure cross-language interoperability. For example, existing Solidity DEXs can list Rust tokens without modification. New SDKs for additional programming languages can be added over time. Current SDK repositories:\n\n- Rust SDK: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs: Rust Smart Contracts on Arbitrum](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs)\n- C/C++ SDK: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-c: C/C++ Smart Contracts on Arbitrum](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-c)\n- Stylus CLI: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/cargo-stylus: Cargo subcommand for developing Arbitrum Stylus projects in Rust](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/cargo-stylus)\n\nIf you would like to better understand the lifecycle of a Stylus contract, head over to [A Gentle Introduction: Stylus](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/stylus-gentle-introduction).\n\nThere are some relevant components of Stylus that are listed below:\n\n- Host I/Os\n- The Memory Model\n- Dynamic Learning\n- Activation Pricing\n- Opcode Pricing\n\nMore details on these components can be found in the corresponding [forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-activate-stylus-and-enable-next-gen-webassembly-smart-contracts-arbos-30/22970), which is also linked below.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nIf the Arbitrum DAO approves the AIP, the path would consist of:\n\n1. Discussion of the proposal on the forum\n2. Completing the audit and remaining code changes\n3. Merging the Stylus branch into the canonical Nitro codebase\n4. A vote on Snapshot to enable Stylus on Arbitrum Sepolia\n5. Sufficient time for testing on a public testnet that emulates production environments\n6. An onchain vote to deploy the upgrade on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova\n\n## Timeline\n\nStylus is rapidly progressing toward being production-ready. Once it is, ideally the upgrade can take place on Arbitrum Sepolia, and Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova afterwards.

      "title": "AIP: Support RIP-7212 for Account Abstraction Wallets (ArbOS 30)",
      "content": "## Constitutional Proposal\n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal adopts [RIP-7212](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md) (Rollup Improvement Proposal), a precompile for verifying the [secp256r1 curve](https://www.nervos.org/knowledge-base/what_is_secp256r1) on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. Other major L2s have committed to adopting RIP-7212. Adding support for this precompile would enable account abstraction wallets to cheaply verify a type of signature widely used in passkeys and secure enclaves.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWallet security is one of the most prominent pain points for crypto users today. Adopting RIP-7212 will reduce the costs of using passkey-based wallets on Arbitrum One and Nova, making them more feasible for everyday use and enabling dApp developers and protocols to offer their users improved UX.\n\nPasskey-based wallets offer a better level of security than a typical EOA and seamless cross-device support. Specifically, adding this precompile will reduce the costs of verifying the secp256r1 curve for account abstraction wallets. Passkeys offer a solution that removes the need for personally storing a private key. They leverage WebAuthn, a global standard for passwordless authentication used by Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and all major web browsers. The private key generated when creating a passkey can be encrypted and then stored in the iCloud Keychain (or the Android Keystore for Android devices). The decryption of the private keys happens in a specialized module located in every iPhone (and other smartphones) called the Secure Enclave. The Secure Enclave ensures a user’s private key can never leave the device, transforming a smartphone into a hardware wallet. Users can authorize transactions with biometric features like Touch ID or Face ID when using passkey-based wallets for key management. These qualities add flexibility and significantly improve UX while maintaining high security.\n\nEthereum currently has a precompile for the [secp25k1](https://www.nervos.org/knowledge-base/secp256k1_a_key%20algorithm_(explainCKBot)) curve, which all EOA wallets use as their signature scheme. Account abstraction wallets can use alternative signature schemes, such as the one that passkeys utilize: secp256r1. Without a precompile, verifying this signature onchain is extremely expensive. Adding support for RIP-7212 would decrease the costs of verifying the secp256r1 curve [by 99%](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/what-is-rip-7212) when compared to current implementations. This makes implementing passkey-based wallets feasible for everyday use. Many wallets, and notably, apps using embedded wallets, have been requesting this feature for over a year.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis proposal is aligned with the Arbitrum community’s mission and values as per the [Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values):\n\n- Ethereum-Aligned: RIP-7212 is the first Rollup Improvement Proposal adopted by the broader Ethereum ecosystem. The RIP stakeholders coordinate with Ethereum Core Devs to ensure Ethereum will continue to be compatible with the upgrade.\n\n- Accessibility: Many users who are not crypto-native will refuse to write down a seed phrase or buy a dedicated hardware wallet. While options exist to get around those pain points, this upgrade empowers account abstraction wallets to provide high-level security without UX tradeoffs.\n\n- Secure: Passkeys and secure enclaves offer hardware-level security since a user’s private key can never leave the device. This is a great alternative to EOAs that does not compromise on usability.\n\n- Inclusivity: RIP-7212 was discussed publicly among all major L2s before being adopted. The codebase is open-source, and anyone can implement the upgrade.\n\n## Key Terms\n- RIP (Rollup Improvement Proposal): A process to establish optional norms and standards for L2s to extend the EVM and related tooling while limiting conflicts with the L1 EVM and preventing a proliferation of mutually incompatible standards among L2s.\n- Precompile: Predefined smart contracts with special addresses that provide specific functionality executed not at the EVM bytecode level but natively by the client.\n\n## Specification\nThe specifications of RIP-7212, including test cases, can be found in the [RIP repository](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md). If approved, Arbitrum One will use this specification as the reference for implementation.\n\nThe [Ethereum Magicians Forum](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7212-precompiled-for-secp256r1-curve-support/14789) discusses design decisions, iterations, and the transformation of the proposal from an EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) to a RIP.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nIf the Arbitrum DAO approves the AIP, the path would consist of:\n\n1. Discussion of the proposal on the forum and governance call(s)\n2. A vote on Snapshot to enable RIP-7212 on Arbitrum Sepolia\n3. Sufficient time for testing on a public testnet that emulates production environments\n4. An onchain vote to deploy the upgrade on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova\n\n## Timeline\nThis proposal will be included in the vote to upgrade to the next version of ArbOS along with [Stylus](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-activate-stylus-and-enable-next-gen-webassembly-smart-contracts/22970), which will move to a Snapshot vote once it is production-ready.\n\nNOTE:\nIf this vote passes on Snapshot, the tentative plan is to upgrade Arbitrum Sepolia to ArbOS 30 the week of June 10th.\n\nIf Arbitrum Sepolia upgrades to ArbOS 30, there will be an ecosystem-wide plan to ensure non-breaking compatibility of infrastructure and applications with Stylus, which will take several weeks or months. The ultimate goal is that the experience for EVM developers remains as unchanged as possible if ArbOS reaches mainnet. Once enough confidence is reached, there will be an onchain vote to upgrade Arbitrum One and Nova to ArbOS 30. The Arbitrum community will be informed of any significant updates as they arise.",

      "title": "AIP: Nova Fee Router Proposal (ArbOS 30)",
      "content": "## Constitutional Proposal\n\n## Abstract / Motivation\n\nCurrently, the DAO receives transaction fees on Nova at an address accessible via the core governance system. This means that any time the DAO wishes to transfer these funds, it must pass a [constitutional proposal](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal). We propose instead a system in which these funds are “automatically” (permissionlessly) sent from Nova to the Arbitrum DAO Treasury on Arbitrum One. This gives the DAO faster, easier accessibility to these funds, and should make bookkeeping simpler.\n\n## Details\n\nCurrently, the [portion of the Nova transaction fees](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/fee-distribution) that the DAO collects are sent via the [fund distributor contracts](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts) to [0xf7951D92B0C345144506576eC13Ecf5103aC905a](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951D92B0C345144506576eC13Ecf5103aC905a), the [address alias](https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing) of the core governance l1 timelock. This allows the DAO to spend the funds via a [round-trip core proposal](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal) initiated from the core governor on Arbitrum One.\n\nA system in which these funds were sent to the DAO Treasury without the DAO needing to take action is preferable for several reasons:\n\n- Spending from the DAO treasury requires a lower quorum (3% vs. 5%)\n- Spending from the DAO treasury is faster (doesn’t impose the additional ~ 2 weeks of delay\n- Keeping all fees in a single location makes bookkeeping simpler and easier to reason about.\n\nWe propose an update in which all Nova fund distributors that distribute to the timelock alias are updated to instead distribute to a system of “fee routers”, via which permissionless transactions will allow the funds to be routed to the Arbitrum Treasury.\n\nThe lifecycle works as follows:\n\n1. A distributeRewards is called on a RewardDistributor contract, sending funds to a ChildToParentRouter contract.\n2. Either upon receiving funds or via a call to routeFunds, the ChildToParentRouter creates an L2-to-L1 message which sends the contract’s full Ether balance.\n3. The L2-to-L1 message is executed, transferring the Ether to a ParentToChildRouter contract on L1.\n4. routeFunds is called on ParentToChildRouter, creating a retryable ticket which transfers its full Ether balance to the DAO Treasury on Arbitrum One.\n\n## Implementation\n\n- Fee Router contracts:\n  - Github link: [fund-distribution-contracts/src/FeeRouter at 61f4f60384e2ecba8250287dfb2778ce30bd82b0 · OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts · GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts/tree/61f4f60384e2ecba8250287dfb2778ce30bd82b0/src/FeeRouter)\n  - Deployments:\n    - [ParentToChildRewardRouter | Address 0x3EB1F638C115F7dE148FAE18b8217e6c200c8657 | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3EB1F638C115F7dE148FAE18b8217e6c200c8657)\n    - [ChildToParentRewardRouter | Address 0x47a85c0a118127f3968a6a1a61e2a326517540d4 | Arbiscan](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x47a85c0a118127f3968a6a1a61e2a326517540d4) \n  - Audit Link: [fund-distribution-contracts/audits at cb9ef7b5a5730fb9eb4bfdd2f9bc1f716a6e9253 · OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts · GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts/tree/cb9ef7b5a5730fb9eb4bfdd2f9bc1f716a6e9253/audits)\n - Upgrade Action contract:\n   - [ArbOS30 AIP: add AIPNovaFeeRoutingAction by DZGoldman · Pull Request #230 · ArbitrumFoundation/governance · GitHub](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/230)\n\n## Additional Action\n\nSometime after this proposal action, an additional proposal can be submitted to transfer the funds remaining in the timelock’s address alias to the fee router.\n\n## Timeline\n\nIf this vote passes on Snapshot, the tentative plan is to upgrade Arbitrum Sepolia to ArbOS 30 the week of June 10th.\n\nIf Arbitrum Sepolia upgrades to ArbOS 30, there will be an ecosystem-wide plan to ensure non-breaking compatibility of infrastructure and applications with Stylus, which will take several weeks or months.

      "content": "## [](#non-constitutional-aip-front-end-interface-to-force-transaction-inclusion-during-sequencer-downtime-1)**\\[Non-Constitutional AIP] Front-end interface to force transaction inclusion during sequencer downtime**\n\n### [](#abstract-2)**Abstract**\n\n[WakeUp Labs](http://www.wakeuplabs.io) proposal outlines the development of a simple but effective front-end interface that enables users to force-include transactions directly on L1 when the Arbitrum Sequencer is down, aiming to increase trust among end-users navigating the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nInspired by a few community discussions ([Link 1](https://x.com/Cattin0x/status/1735779772054077917?s=20) & [Link 2](https://x.com/fede_intern/status/1754226077981893052?s=20)) , and validated historical events like: [Sequencer Downtime 1](https://offchain.medium.com/todays-arbitrum-sequencer-downtime-what-happened-6382a3066fbc), [Sequener Downtime 2](https://dedaub.com/blog/arbitrum-sequencer-outage), [Historical Sequencer Status](https://status.arbitrum.io/history/3) and [L2BEAT status](https://l2beat.com/scaling/risk).\nThis tool aims to empower users with the ability to bypass the Sequencer in situations where it is unavailable or censoring transactions, thus aligning with Arbitrum’s vision for progressive decentralization.\n\nWakeUp Labs has a proven track record of expertise in crafting exceptional blockchain tools and infrastructure. Their contributions extend to collaborating on [open-source projects for major DAOs](https://x.com/0xMilton/status/1755972182553899487?s=20), enhancing Ethereum Foundation-funded initiatives, building complex DeFi protocols, SmartContracts and offering a [developer platform](http://www.platform.wakeuplabs.io) that facilitates robust and scalable API calls for smart contract deployment without requiring Solidity programming skills. (Currently operating even on the Arbitrum blockchain).\n\n### [](#introduction-3)**Introduction**\n\nThe Arbitrum Sequencer is a critical component of the network, responsible for submitting users’ transactions to L1.\n\nUnder the current system, the Sequencer is a potential single point of failure; if compromised, it could delay or prevent the processing of transactions.\n\nThere are ways to bypass it, but non-developer users lack that capability.\n\nThis proposal seeks to mitigate such risks by providing a user-friendly alternative transaction submission pathway, thereby enhancing the network’s resilience, user autonomy, and their confidence in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nFor the service to be truly useful in the event of catastrophic occurrences, empowering more teams to deploy their own instances is crucial. Thus, to boost the project’s reliability and significantly enhance its value to the Arbitrum DAO, it is essential to embrace an OpenSource approach from the beginning.\n\n### [](#rationale-4)**Rationale**\n\n* **Decentralization and user empowerment:** By enabling direct L1 transaction submissions, users can circumvent Sequencer outages or censorship, maintaining their ability to transact without interruption. This capability is crucial for ensuring the network’s operational integrity and aligns with the principle of progressive decentralization.\n* **Enhancing trustless security:** The proposed interface would serve as a valuable tool in rare situations where the Sequencer fails to perform its duties. It ensures that the Arbitrum Rollup maintains its trustless security model, even when permissioned components of the system are not functioning correctly.\n\n### [](#wakeup-labs-core-team-5)**WakeUp Labs core team**\n\n* [Milton Berman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miltonberman/), co-founder and CEO, brings extensive experience as a CTO in a decentralized identity project supported by IDB Lab and Bitcoin NGO. He has also worked as a Product Owner at Rootstock blockchain and as a CTO in a mobile game studio company. With a background in working with large corporations, Milton possesses the technical expertise and strategic vision necessary to drive the success of our project.\n* [Maximiliano del Hoyo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximiliandh/), co-founder and CBDO, has a diverse background in software and finance. His previous experience at notable companies like Microsoft and Nestle provides him with the necessary knowledge and network to navigate the intersection of technology and business, ensuring the effective achievement of the project’s goals.\n* [Gonzalo Silman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gonzalo-silman/), co-founder and COO, possesses a unique blend of expertise in economics (former university professor), finance, and entrepreneurial experience in creating gaming products for LATAM communities. This diverse background brings a fresh perspective and innovative thinking to our project, enabling us to understand user needs and craft tailored solutions that resonate with our target audience.\n\n### [](#proposal-details-6)**Proposal Details**\n\n### [](#technical-implementation-7)Technical Implementation\n\n1. **OpenSource from Day One**: Given that the project should be 100% trustless, as clearly outlined in its ‘Rationale’ above, we believe that the entire project, including both the Back-End and Front-End, should be OpenSource from the beginning. One of our goals is for this service to be run from different instances and by different providers; therefore, it will be a top priority to ensure that this repository is well-documented and our support is readily available so that any team or community project can implement it.\n2. **Transaction Monitoring:** Develop functionality to listen for user transactions on L2 that are not included by the Sequencer, with guidance from the Arbitrum SDK documentation.\n3. **Manual Transaction Hash Input:** In cases where automatic detection is not feasible, provide a user interface for manually entering the transaction hash or implement manually the previous transaction in the new solution.\n   * *Step 2 and 3 might not be resolved as outlined in the proposal due to Arbitrum’s specific traits. However, a solution will be proposed and explained in both the technical documentation and the research document from milestone 1.*\n4. **L1 Transaction Replication:** Implement mechanisms to replicate the intended L2 transaction on L1, using “Forced Withdrawal” type transactions to push the L2 transaction from L1.\n5. **Confirmation Display:** Ensure the interface provides feedback once the transaction has successfully been processed.\n6. **Processing Time Consideration:** Account for the approximately 24-hour processing period to prevent errors or transaction duplication across chains.\n7. **Hosting, Service & Maintenance:** WakeUp will host the service, ensuring it runs 24/7, even on IPFS. For the first three months, we will fine-tune and iterate the service. Additionally, should any problems occur, the WakeUp team is committed to identifying and resolving these issues for a minimum of the next two years.\n\n### [](#development-roadmap-budget-allocation-8)Development Roadmap & Budget Allocation:\n\n1. **Technical Research, POC, Documentation and Testing (4 weeks, $ARB 9000):**\n   Deep dive into the Delayed Inbox functionality and its integration, along with creating a PoC and validating the necessity of a new internal tool for transaction monitoring and sequencer status. We will also carefully check that our solution doesn’t disrupt the proper functioning of Arbitrum; if it does, we will enable this instance only when the official sequencer is not operating correctly. This research conducted by the WakeUp Team will be made public, and the community will be able to view it, both in a summary Twitter Thread and in an Article shared on the OSS Github repository once completed.\n   This document will also consider the security measures that must be taken into account when carrying out the development.\n2. **Endpoint Development (1.5 weeks, $ARB 3500):**\n   Creation of endpoints to interact with the backend logic.\n3. **Logic Integration and Testing (2.5 weeks, $ARB 3500):**\n   Connecting the frontend to the endpoints and verifying the operational logic, and test heavily the MVP.\n4. **Design Phase (4 weeks, $ARB 5000):**\n   Additional time allocated for the design process, ensuring a user-friendly experience.\n5. **UI Development (3 weeks, $ARB 5500):**\n   Crafting an aesthetic and intuitive user interface inspired by existing high-quality designs.\n   To enhance user security, we will add a banner at the top of the website to ensure the URL is correct and guard against phishing sites.\n6. **Enhancing Documentation Clarity and Usability (3 weeks, $ARB 6000):**\n   Finalizing and clearly documenting the open-source codebase. As detailed above, any team should be able to run their own instance of the service, so it’s crucial that everything is sufficiently clear. There, we will also add a list of URLs for instances set up by others that we can confirm are correctly implemented.\n   * *This process will not be linear. Since the project will be OpenSource from the beginning, it may not be sufficiently organized until milestone 6 is reached. This is why significant community contributions, like PRs or entirely new pieces of code, will be more practical after this milestone is completed.*\n7. **Service & Maintenance after Launch (24 months, $ARB 10000).**\n   We commit to hosting the site on Vercel or AWS, ensuring 24/7 operation for at least 24 months. Once a stable version has been achieved and properly tested, an instance will also be running on IPFS to ensure a 100% decentralized option. While this may not be the most performant option, it will be available for at least these 2 years. After evaluating its performance, we will attempt to provide it indefinitely. Initially, the WakeUp team will refine the website based on feedback from users and the Arbitrum community and will conduct continuous testing to ensure its reliability. Any issues, such as downtime or crashes, will be promptly addressed by the WakeUp team for at least the next two years.\n\n### [](#budget-resources-and-payment-schedule-9)**Budget, Resources and Payment Schedule**\n\n* **Estimated Timeframe:** Approximately 4.5 months for full implementation, including design phases; followed by 3 months dedicated to post-launch iterations and 24 months of hosting, monitoring, and bug fixing to address any possible error.\n* **Development Team:** One full-time senior Solidity developer for the core implementation and research, in coordination with the entire WakeUp Labs engineering team, plus additional design and developer resources for the UI/UX phase. The proposal also includes a Senior Developer working part-time for post-launch maintenance.\n  Gonzalo or Milton from the core team will also keep track of the project as PO.\n* **Payment Schedule & Terms:**\n  * A payment of 20% of the total grant required will be made on June 1st, as a *“Kick off payment”*.\n  * The remainder of the grant will be vested gradually, on a second-by-second basis, until approximately September (Over 4 months after the kickoff).\n  * The security council / The Arbitrum Foundation reserves the right to revoke the payment stream at any moment, to be used in case of unsatisfactory performance.\n* **Total Cost:** 42.500 $ARB\n\n### [](#conclusion-10)**Conclusion**\n\n### [](#h-11)\n\nDeveloping a front-end interface to enable force-including transactions during Sequencer downtime is a crucial requirement in the Arbitrum ecosystem. This proposal aims to empower users by ensuring transaction capabilities even when the Sequencer is unavailable. By doing so, it aligns with Arbitrum’s goals of decentralization and enhancing user autonomy.\n\nFor the solution to be truly useful in critical cases, we must ensure that other projects can run their own instances of this service. This is why the project is conceived as OpenSource from the very beginning, and the WakeUp Labs team will actively assist teams wanting to implement it.\n\nFurthermore, WakeUp will be responsible for maintaining the service operational and implementing minor improvements for a minimum of 2 years.\n\n#### [](#notes-12)Notes:\n\nSome changes have been made throughout the proposal; you can see the details here: [Tally: Front-end interface to force transaction inclusion during sequencer downtime](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-front-end-interface-to-force-transaction-inclusion-during-sequencer-downtime/21247/46) [Proposals\n](/c/proposals/7)\n\nOpenZeppelin did a security analysis of this proposal here: <https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/security-analysis-of-using-hedgey-for-proposal-payment-vesting/23780>",

      "content": "Non-constitutional\n\nPlease review the forum post for full proposal details: <https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pilot-phase-m-a-for-arbitrum-dao/23588>\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe 8-weeks M\\&A pilot phase proposal is the next step toward the Arbitrum M\\&A proposal outlining the opportunity for Arbitrum DAO to form an M\\&A Unit focused on identifying and executing on acquisition opportunities.\n\nThe overarching aim is to utilize M\\&A as a key growth driver for the Arbitrum ecosystem and to help the DAO expand non-organically through acquisition opportunities that are not accessible to competing ecosystems, thereby critically enhancing Arbitrum DAO's capital allocation methods.\n\nFull details on the M\\&A proposal, its operational processes and structure you can find in the [Arbitrum M\\&A Core Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/m-a-for-arbitrum-dao/23205 \"Arbitrum M\\&A Core Proposal\")\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe 8-week pilot phase is designed to provide the DAO with sufficient information to make an informed go/no-go decision regarding the further operationalization of the M\\&A unit and its funding requirements. It is the natural progression of a 6 weeks Working Group sprint to develop an initial structure of the M\\&A unit.\n\nIn addition to conducting an in-depth strategy study on the value upside of M\\&A, analyzing strategic target areas, aligning them with key stakeholders (both online and at the GovHack in Brussels), and providing exemplary analyses on targets, the pilot phase should serve as a facilitated platform for in-depth discussions based on data rather than opinions.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe dedicated goals of the pilot phase are the following:\n\n1. **Equip the DAO with sufficient knowledge** to make an informed decision about the operationalization of the fund.\n2. **Align the DAO on strategic target areas** by providing strategic analysis and coordinating key delegates and stakeholders.\n3. **Provide an orchestrated platform for discussion** of the efforts over an extended period of time to further sharpen the edges.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe initiative will be led by a dedicated team from Areta - the leading independent crypto-native investment bank specializing in M\\&A and complex financial transactions for some of the leading ecosystems in the crypto space with deep M\\&A transaction expertise and involvement in Arbitrum DAO.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nThe insights from the analyses will be condensed into an assessment report to be presented to the DAO. Further, the GovHack at EthCC will be used for status update and facilitation of a working session. The insights from the analyses will be condensed into an assessment report to be presented to the DAO, incl.:\n\n**1. Analysis of M\\&A value upside for Arbitrum DAO**\n\n* Arbitrum M\\&A value upside analysis, incl. benchmarking for the DAO\n* Assessment of tactical importance of M\\&A for the DAO, incl. activities that M\\&A will enable the DAO to engage in\n* Impact analyses of determined target areas\n\n**2. Development of strategic areas for Arbitrum DAO supported by in-depth analyses, incl. alignment of target areas with key stakeholders in the DAO**\n\n* In-depth strategic analyses of target areas, incl. financial and strategic upside to the Arbitrum ecosystem\n* Facilitating interactions across the DAO to present results of analyses and align stakeholders. Key part of these will be held at the GovHack in EthCC.\n\n**3. Analyses of target examples and presentation to the DAO**\n\n* Exemplary target identification on one target area to provide the DAO with a better understanding of what it would mean to have the M\\&A Mgmt Unit operate\n* Target analysis and example of outside-in due diligence process\n* Integration options per target in context of Arbitrum DAO\n\n## Timeline\n\nThe pilot phase (as detailed in the proposal) will entail an 8-week sprint structured into 3 work packages and underlying deliverables detailed out above.\n\n## **Overall Cost**\n\nOverall cost for the 8-weeks pilot phase will be $52k ARB, consisting of:\n\n* **Operational budget:** Minimal budget to cover cost for a lean team conducting the execution of outlined work packages: $25k ARB / month\n* **Access to Data Providers/Research Platforms:** $2k in ARB (remaining budget to be refunded to the DAO)\n\nReceiving wallet address: 0xd5c4E8dd598205045f406DC81b9e01E91005C912\n\nSafe MSig with 3 signers: Bernard Schmid (0x8F7A73A6e96fAb2C970bC4b76d236c3dCCD6e7Da); Karl-Martin (0xC6Dc0805c3e7cF1667f80F46bd9D5b1443280dBF); Jan-Philip Grabs (0x39B91ede1F2e7524207cDFB6823Be2a4f9B94012)\n\n## Helpful links:\n\n* M\\&A Core Proposal: [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/m-a-for-arbitrum-dao/23205)\n* M\\&A Working Group Progress: [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/start-of-arbitrum-m-a-working-group/22520)\n* M\\&A Telegram Group: [here](https://t.me/+IjizbmkcAisyZTli)\n* Easy-to-digest Video Summary (s/o to Sinkas): [here](https://twitter.com/Sinkas_/status/1784876301826073036)\n\n## Key Terms\n\nDefinitions of any terms within the proposal that are unique to the proposal, new to the Arbitrum community, and/or industry-specific. This section is optional, but recommended.\n\n**Mergers & Acquisitions (M\\&A)**\n\nMergers and Acquisitions (M\\&A) involve the process of combining two companies into one or one company taking ownership of another. These transactions aim to create a more efficient and effective entity by leveraging synergies\n\n**Target**\n\nA target in M\\&A refers to the company that is being pursued for acquisition by another company, known as the acquirer. The acquisition typically results in a change of control of the target company, transferring ownership to the acquiring company.\n\n*Special thanks to @jacobpphillips and @hiringdevs.eth for sparking the initiative at the GovHack in Denver, and the WG members for their continuous support.*",

      "title": "Kwenta x Perennial: Arbitrum Onboarding Incentives",
      "content": "[Please refer here for the entire proposal.](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/kwenta-x-perennial-arbitrum-onboarding-incentives-updated/22736)\n\nKwenta, a prominent DeFi application in the Optimism ecosystem, is set to expand to Arbitrum, utilizing Perennial V2, an Arbitrum-native protocol. This joint proposal requests 1.9 million ARB to fund targeted onboarding incentives, aiming to bring Kwenta users to Arbitrum.\n\n* Full LITPP format\n* Ask of 1.9M ARB, down from 4.5M\n* Detailed onboarding incentives methodology & model: quest-style incentives, one targeting a broad base of users, one specifically scaling CAC to target the highest value users\n* Matt from Stable Lab & LTIPP multisig confirmed to handle accountability, in line with STIP.b requirements\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. Onboard New Users to Kwenta on Arbitrum: Target existing Kwenta users from Optimism and Base, sidelined Kwenta community members eager to trade on Arbitrum, and new DeFi or centralized exchange (CEX) traders. The focus is on attracting a large number of users from other ecosystems.\n2. Retain High-Value Users: Encourage recurring usage from the highest value users from other ecosystems (power users), delivering significant value for Kwenta, Perennial, and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.\n3. Mutual Growth: Utilize the combined strengths of Kwenta and Perennial to attract a substantial number of new users to Arbitrum beyond the duration of the grant.\n\nExecution Strategy:\n\n* Flexible Distribution Methods: Utilize both on- and off-chain data, with off-chain rewards distribution for flexibility, adjusting methods based on effectiveness.\n* Kwenta’s Frontend Application: Leverage Kwenta’s active user base to serve direct incentives through customized notifications within the application, facilitating a higher conversion rate.\n* Seamless Migration Experience: Develop a top-tier user experience for migrating to Arbitrum, minimizing costs, clicks, and time required for users to switch chains.\n\nIncentive Model:\n\n1. Targeted Trader Onboarding Incentives:\n\n  * Quest 1 (Mass Onboarding): Aim to onboard up to 2,200 users from the past year, offering a reward of up to $50 to cover migration costs and encourage initial trading on Arbitrum. Users must open at least two trades of at least $1,000 each to qualify for the reward.\n  * Quest 2 (Active Trader Incentivisation & Retention): A 12-week quest targeting high-value users. Rewards are divided into tiers based on trading volume, with higher rewards for more active users. Weekly multipliers incentivize consistent trading, and users can opt to vest their rewards for higher future multipliers.\n\n2. Targeted Fee Rebates:\n\n  * Allocation: 66.6% for existing Kwenta users and 33.3% for non-Kwenta Arbitrum users.\n  * Structure: Rebates are pooled and capped at fees paid, preventing wash trading. Distributed weekly, with options for users to vest their rebates for higher future rewards.\n\n3. Liquidity Bootstrapping Incentives:\n\n  * Initial Focus: Primarily on ETH and BTC markets, with expansion to other assets based on trader demand.\n  * Approach: Incentives to attract efficient liquidity providers, reducing reliance on retail liquidity, aiming for professional market makers with higher leverage to ensure deep liquidity at lower costs.\n\nIncentive Mechanisms:\n\n* Upfront Onboarding Incentives: Help users overcome switching costs with initial rewards, aiming for conversion to recurring users.\n* Weekly Rewards and Loyalty Multipliers: Encourage users to return regularly and increase their rewards through consistent participation.\n* Tiered Rewards and Vesting Options: Provide higher rewards for increased usage and incentivize users to lock their ARB for additional benefits.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\n* Onboarding KPIs: Measure net-new volume and users onboarded.\n* General KPIs: Track trading volume, open interest (taker), total liquidity (maker), and total value locked (TVL).\n\nGrant Timeline and Milestones:\n\n* Month 1:\n  * Focus on onboarding new users.\n  * Target $10M average daily volume and 250 net-new users.\n* Month 2:\n  * Scale up growth in volume and open interest.\n  * Target $25M average daily volume and 400 net-new users.\n* Month 3:\n  * Retain growth and volume.\n  * Target $50M average daily volume and 500 net-new users.\n\nJustification for Grant:\n\n* Net-New Capital and Users: Kwenta aims to onboard hundreds of users and over a billion in monthly volume to the Arbitrum ecosystem, providing significant value compared to other incentive programs.\n* Arbitrum Perps Proliferation: Kwenta’s perps aggregator will enhance the existing perp ecosystem on Arbitrum, fostering competition and efficiency.\n* Distribution for Innovation: Utilize Kwenta’s user base to introduce Arbitrum-native innovations, such as NFT perps and power perps, directly to the market.\n\nAccountability Details:\n\n* Program Manager: Matt from Stable Labs.\n* Multisig Oversight: A 5-out-of-7 multisig team confirmed to handle funds and ensure accountability.\n* Transparency and Reporting: Regular bi-weekly updates, a final closeout report, and adherence to OpenBlock Labs’ data requirements, ensuring detailed tracking and analysis of program metrics.\n\nCommitment to Arbitrum:\n\n* Alignment with Arbitrum Ecosystem: Kwenta and Perennial demonstrate strong commitment through actions such as launching the Kwenta token on Arbitrum, introducing Arbitrum-native products, and maintaining Arbitrum as the core of their ecosystem.\n* Further Actions: Kwenta plans additional initiatives to deepen its relationship with Arbitrum, including innovative product launches and ecosystem participation.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis proposal seeks a one-off grant due to its unique potential impact, aiming to onboard significant new capital and users to Arbitrum by leveraging Kwenta’s existing user base and Perennial's infrastructure. The proposed incentive mechanisms and detailed execution strategy aim to maximize user onboarding and retention, ensuring long-term benefits for the Arbitrum ecosystem.",

      "title": "Streamlining the LTIPP Bounties",
      "content": "## Abstract\nThis proposal aims to streamline the LTIPP bounty process by allowing the LTIPP council more autonomy in choosing who completes each bounty. This will help create a faster-moving selection system with more accountability, allowing the DAO to gather more insights into the results of the incentive campaigns.\n## Motivation\nThe LTIPP proposal included up to 200,000 ARB available for research on STIP, the Backfund, and the LTIP Pilot Program. The bounties guarantee the DAO will have multiple teams working on providing meaningful conclusions regarding the incentive programs. These conclusions will be essential to allow the DAO to possess all the information necessary to create the best possible long-term incentive framework.\nHowever, in its current format, it will take multiple months and many DAO votes to decide who will complete each bounty. This proposal aims to streamline that process so that more teams can research Arbitrum Incentives programs in a timely manner. By allowing the LTIPP council more freedom in using the bounty funds, we can move faster to start the bounties the same week as the start incentives.\n## Rationale\nThis new process not only speeds things up but also creates more accountability and can lead to more teams applying to fulfill bounties.\nDAO-wide votes to select who completes each bounty can become a popularity contest. This discourages less well-connected or busy researchers from applying, as they don’t want to deal with the struggle of lobbying every delegate.\nHowever, allowing the elected LTIPP council to choose the most qualified teams without the researchers worrying about lobbying and DAO politics will encourage more bounty applications. This will lead to more options to choose from and result in better overall research being done.\nThis new process for selecting bounties also adds accountability, as the decision is made by a small group instead of the entire DAO. The DAO delegates might not want to take the time or have the expertise to read and understand each application. Additionally, it is hard to assign accountability for decisions when they are made by large groups like DAOs.\nHowever, with a smaller group making the decisions, more accountability and expertise will be placed in each decision, leading to better outcomes for the DAO. The LTIPP council comprises strong teams and individuals elected by the community who have the DAOs’ best interests in mind. The council has intimate knowledge of the incentives programs and understands what needs to be studied to create a new and improved incentives program.\n## Specifications\nThe LTIPP proposal allocated a maximum of 200k ARB for research bounties. To streamline the process, this proposal allows the council to choose who fulfills each bounty. The proposed new bounty format is as follows.\n#### Bounty Submission\nStarting May 20th, researchers can apply for bounties by submitting applications on the forum. The council will put out a list of bounties they would like researched but researchers can also submit their own ideas for bounties.\n####  Bounty Feedback\nApplications for research bounties will be due June 3rd. The council and delegates will give feedback on the forum up until the 3rd to give feedback and allow people to alter their applications.\n#### Bounty Selection\nThe LTIPP council will then select which bounties to fund on June 10th. Researchers whose bounty is selected would start their research immediately upon selection. This will align nicely with the start of LTIPP incentives beginning on June 3rd.\n#### Bounty Payments\nResearchers will be paid half of their bounty upon completing KYC and half of it upon completing their bounty. The LTIPP workstream will monitor the bounties throughout the program to ensure the bounties are completed and payments are made.\n## Steps to Implement\n* Complete Snapshot vote to give more autonomy to the LTIPP council.\n* Have teams submit proposals for bounties\n* The council selects which bounties to fund\n* Research starts\n* Researcher’s selected for bounties complete KYC\n* Half of the bounty is paid once KYC is completed\n* Half of the bounty is paid upon completion of the research\n## Timeline\n* Snapshot Vote: May 22 - May 29th\n* Application Period: May 22 - June 3rd\n* Selection Period: June 3rd - June 10th\n* Research: June 10th - September\n## Overall Cost\nThere is no additional cost to this proposal. The funding will come from the 200K arb budget from the LTIPP proposal.",

      "title": "Arbitrum Multi-sig Support Service (MSS)",
      "content": "Please view the full proposal text on the forum: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrum-multi-sig-support-service-mss/23737\n\n#### Non-Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\nWe propose creating a structured multi-sig framework to facilitate funded programs within Arbitrum DAO to reduce operational spend and increase proposal efficiency. \n\nAs of April 2024, the DAO administers six programs with a designated budget for multi-sig signing. The aggregate budgeted cost across these programs for signers stands at 158,000 ARB, with an annualized total expenditure, based on estimations, of 470,000 ARB or $627,840 at an ARB price of $1.34. This is a high cost for the DAO to pay on a purely operational function, especially **considering that these operational costs will likely rise as more programs are funded.** \n\nWe propose creating a “Multi-sig Support Service” (MSS) to unlock significant cost-saving opportunities, lessen committee fragmentation, ensure signers are competent with multi-sigs, and reduce friction for contributors creating proposals. The MSS will comprise 12 elected individuals to all DAO-funded multi-sigs. They will be compensated a base USD amount, paid in ARB, for performing these services across the DAO. \n\nThis proposal also includes the optional steps to fund the implementation of r3gen monthly Token Flow reporting on inflows (revenue) and outflows (spend) across the DAO as well as providing detailed information and analysis on spending from MSS multisigs. Together, this proposal will help create a “backroom finance” function within the DAO that can be used across different initiatives. \n\nThe proposed changes offer the potential to generate substantial cost savings, estimated to be ~$315,000 per annum, while increasing efficiency, transparency, and security of DAO spending.\n\n## Motivation\nThe Arbitrum DAO oversees six programs which pay multi-sig signers. Each multi-sig typically has five signers, except for the STIP and STIP backfund programs, which share the same multi-sig and have nine signers budgeted for. \n\nThe full analysis detailed in the forum post underscores the operational unsustainability of the current expenditure level, with an annualised cost totalling $627,840 USD based on the average ARB price of $1.34 between August 7, 2023 and April 30, 2024, the period starting when Arbitrum DAO’s first multisig was funded.\n\nThe cost per transaction appears excessive when comparing these figures against the volume of unique transactions sent from each multi-sig. While analysis for all multi-sig wallets is included for completeness, the STIP/Backfund multi-sig provides the clearest picture of the “cost per transaction” due to its proximity to completion.\n\nThis analysis highlights the urgent need for restructuring and cost optimization within the Arbitrum DAO to ensure financial sustainability and operational efficiency in the long term.\n\nIt is also worth highlighting that the current structure has individuals appearing across multiple different multi-sigs, drawing income from each.\n\nCurrently, the DAO experiences a significant dispersion in its structure, where each funded program operates its own multi-sig. This fragmentation not only leads to redundancy but also elevates the overall cost of operations. Through the “Multi-sig Support Service” (MSS), we can eliminate these inefficiencies and significantly reduce unnecessary expenditure.\n\nAdditionally, individuals on multi-sigs are generally not elected, posing a challenge in consistently ensuring that only the most trusted and competent members manage these critical roles. By shifting to an elected model within the MSS, we can enhance transparency, accountability, and professionalism, ensuring that every signer meets a high standard of trust and competency.\n\nFinally, contributors currently face friction in advancing proposals due to the need to wrangle signers, which can delay or deter the proposal process. The MSS aims to streamline this process by providing a reliable and consistent team of signers to be included in proposals, thereby reducing the time and effort of contributors, and accelerating the pace at which the DAO can execute its initiatives.\n\nBy creating a structured multisig committee, process, and reporting cadence around spending, the DAO will be better equipped to service its plethora of proposals that require payments and maintain transparency around the programs.\n\n## Proposed solution\nThe proposed framework for the Arbitrum DAO aims to address these issues by:\n\n1. Arbitrum DAO elects 12 signers via Snapshot weighted voting, shielded with Shutter\n      * Signers, when submitting their application to join the MSS, may opt in to be an MSS Chair, who will be responsible for communicating to the DAO on the MSS’s behalf. The three opted-in signers with the highest weight according to Snapshot will be allocated MSS Chairs.\n2. For each new DAO initiative requiring a multisig, a new 12 signer multisig is set up.\n     * The signing threshold will be dependent on the total dollar denominated value of the wallet\n          i. 6/12: <$1M\n          ii. 7/12: $1M-$5M\n          iii. 8/12: $5M-$10m\n          iiii. 9/12 $10M-$50M\n3. Signers are paid a fixed monthly fee of $1500 in ARB using spot price at the time of payment. The MSS Chairs will be paid $2500 per month in ARB using the spot price.\n     * We feel denominating the payment in a $ value is important to ensure the DAO pays a fair price for service rendered without the risk of ARB price movement leading to a series of overpayment or underpayment to signers for their duty. \n4. This will be paid out monthly from the MSS multi-sig, which will be a 6/12 including the entirety of the MSS.\n     * Payment for multisig signers will only start once the first new multisig is onboarded under the Multisig Support Service MSS structure.\n     * Existing multi-sigs have the option to “opt in” to the MSS structure. If they do so any existing ring-fenced budget for multisig signing should be sent directly to a new MSS multisig. An MSS Chair will coordinate with the Program to manage the transition process. We expect a gradual turnover given the incentives at play and that most multi-sigs will not opt into the transition process. \n5. The same process is repeated to onboard new MSS members 12 months after the first is complete (starting the process 4 months before the term is up to allow for ample time)\n\nWe suggest the program is capped at initiatives seeking funding of $50M or less. This will help ensure that the program is not bottlenecked by one single initiative. For programs seeking more than $50M in funding, we suggest inspiration in design be taken from this model while creating a dedicated multisig committee and process.",

      "content": "This vote is to seek support for a standalone grant application by LlamaRisk on behalf of and to support the growth of Curve Finance on Arbitrum\n\nThis grant application is NOT part of LTIPP but has been designed to follow a similar model and is proposed to be distributed over a similar period.  If this proposal is approved by the DAO and the LTIPP council is agreeable this proposal can fit within the monitoring of LTIPP as well.\n\n### Key Grant Information\n\n**Requested Grant Size**\n237,500 ARB\n\n**Grant Period**\n16 weeks\n\n**Grant Matching**\nMichael Egorov will donated 237,500 ARB from his personal ownership to match the arbitrum grant. The source of these tokens are from early personal investment into Arbitrum.\n\n**Grant Breakdown**\nThe goal of this proposal is to establish a deeply liquid borrowing and lending market for ARB tokens. The funds matched by the Arbitrum DAO will be used exclusively to bootstrap the supply side in the two ARB markets. The funds from Micheal Egorov are used for the crvUSD/ARB/CRV pool and upcoming LRT/WETH AMM pools. Possible LRT tokens are weETH (ether.fi), ezETH (Renzo) and reETH (KelpDAO), which have decent liquidity on arbitrum.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-26 at 8.36.34 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreihn7esgqmy7jaqqz7bfkrdgsrsgsvqpf4do4253ojjvz26gjl4ct4)\n\nThe ARB will be deployed to the market/pool rewards as a supply incentive and direct LP incentive.\n\nOnce funds have been received, we will work with the Curve core team to deploy the grant. Distribution will begin shortly after the necessary markets have been deployed.\n\n\n\n**Note added, 9. May 2024**\n\nCurve’s matching contribution of 237,500 donated by Michael Egorov has partly already commenced, to this date, 168’000 ARB has being distributed directly in the following lending markets: ARB/crvUSD, WETH/crvUSD, WBTC/crvUSD, CRV/crvUSD. They helped to bootstramp curve lending.\n\nUpon successful passing of this vote, the remaining, 69,500 ARB undistributed funds will be deposited into the multisig.\n\nDuring the incentive, Michael Egorov will add his monthly vested 19,791 ARB on top of the pledged 237,500 ARB.\n\nLlamaRisk will coordinate with LTIPP council to ensure any data reporting requirements and compliance requirements of LTIPP are followed\n\n\n\n**Link to Full Proposal below**\n\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-request-to-match-my-donation-to-boostrap-curve-lending-on-arbitrum/22975",

      "content": "# [](#hack-humanity-govhack-at-eth-cc-brussels-1)Hack Humanity: GovHack at ETH CC (Brussels)\n\n**non-constituional**\n\n## [](#abstract-2)Abstract\n\nHack Humanity is seeking $309k of funding from the Arbitrum DAO to host an event and after-party coinciding with [ETH CC](https://ethcc.io/) in Brussels, Belgium. Arbitrum GovHack Brussels will take place as a 3-day event on July 5, 6, and 7, the days directly prior to the start of the conference. ETH CC is only 11 weeks away, so approving the funds ASAP is of the utmost importance to ensure that Arbitrum has a strong presence at one of the most important Ethereum-centric events of the year.\n\nHack Humanity intends to continue serving the DAO by planning IRL activations and will seek additional funding in the coming months. The time constraints for ETH CC have led us to propose funding solely for this event in hopes of an expedient proposal process prior to asking the DAO for a larger funding package that ensures a long-term and optimal solution for Arbitrum DAO’s event participation.\n\nGovHack Brussels aims to:\n\n* Build trust and deepen relationships between Arbitrum contributors\n* Ideate and later implement proposals that benefit Arbitrum\n* Attract new talent to the DAO\n* Position Arbitrum as the go-to home for talent to build and the DAO as a world-class operation maturing and innovating at the forefront of decentralized governance\n\nGovHack Brussels, improves on and expands GovHack ETHDenver with additional prize pool, the introduction of a subsidy pool for high-value contributors, enhancing and running a proper community showcase day, and adding a dedicated afterparty.\n\n## [](#motivation-3)Motivation\n\nIn a world of remote work, decentralized technology, and decentralized finance, the human social-layer needs intentional facilitation and development to mature and enable building this next paradigm of technology and new ways of working together. Online collaboration can only get us so far. A key competitive advantage for the ArbitrumDAO is strategically investing in growing a high-trust network of talented contributors, delegates, service providers, and builders on Arbitrum. GovHack ETHDenver proved the thesis that in-person opportunities for the DAO to work together represent a significant competitive advantage for Arbitrum.\n\n[![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/4fec995f9c5fa12ec06eacbfd88bd65104c776a9.jpeg)](https://pitch.com/v/arbitrum-govhack----ethdenver-v21-ngcy5r)\n\nIf you are aiming to learn more about what GovHack aims to achieve, please check out their ETHDenver:\n\n* [Pitch](https://pitch.com/v/arbitrum-govhack----ethdenver-v21-ngcy5r) deck\n* [Impact Report](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-ethdenver-2024-impact-report-hack-humanity/23239) - 9.1 star rating and 67% NPS from participants\n* [Media production](https://www.youtube.com/@HackHumanity/playlists)\n* Aftermovie:\n\n[![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/7/7b1a008f0826ef178f0fe33e5b6bd4d4920622e8.jpeg \"GovHack Aftermovie - ETHDenver 2024 - Powered by Hack Humanity\")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Bt-wQt8sE)\n\nHack Humanity, was previously funded with a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation to host GovHack ETHDenver. Hack Humanity is looking to build on this success and momentum as an ecosystem development partner through IRL activations with the Arbitrum DAO for the long-term.\n\nIt is critical that Arbitrum has a significant presence at industry-leading events, and that contributors have regular and consistent IRL opportunities to grow high-trust relationships. It builds community and brand while attracting users, developers, and other important DAO contributors.\n\nHack Humanity offers deep custom work pre-event; with ecosystem mapping, facilitating community co-design processes to develop tracks & challenge statements most relevant to Arbitrum, identifying target talent contributor personas, skill gap analysis of who to market and recruit to the ecosystem. Hack Humanity drives innovation through unique custom IRL experiences that mature and evolve the DAO’s capabilities.\n\n\\[![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/9ebed2c3a93253ad459e7b1876b8701e8bb16055_2_599x341.jpeg)\n\n1600×912 352 KB\n\n]\\(https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/9/9ebed2c3a93253ad459e7b1876b8701e8bb16055.jpeg)\n\nA well-run event typically requires a minimum of 3 months of lead time, with factors such as securing suppliers, the team’s calendar, and venue down payments requiring capital upfront from the event organizer. We are less than 90 days out from ETH CC, and at this point Arbitrum is not well-positioned to have a strong presence in Brussels. [Klaus](https://twitter.com/klausbrave) (Hack Humanity founder) has exemplified his ability to host high-quality IRL activations on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO in the past, so we believe that getting funds approved ASAP so that Hack Humanity can begin organizing a governance hackathon and an after-party is very important.\n\nRelevant Hack Humanity resources:\n\n* [Arbitrum GovHack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0Bt-wQt8sE) Video (ETHDenver)\n  * GovHack ETH Denver [forum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-ethdenver-powered-by-hack-humanity/21119) proposal\n  * [Impact report](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-ethdenver-2024-impact-report-hack-humanity/23239)\n* [Klaus](https://twitter.com/klausbrave/)’ work at [IBM](https://youtu.be/cMMkxZo89GQ)\n* Company [Website](https://www.hackhumanity.com/)\n  * [Hack Humanity Pitch Deck](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/dqxabsyasoohpa4cyqh4y/Hack-Humanity-Human-Centred-Hackathons-v2024.pdf?rlkey=r0brje5hzkq8sxwryje6gbpc2\\&dl=0)\n* YouTube [Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@hackhumanity)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HackHumanityCo)\n\n## [](#rationale-4)Rationale\n\nThe most successful crypto brands, such as Uniswap, LayerZero, dYdX, and others, prioritize brand presence at events to reaffirm their positions as industry leaders. ETH CC is an Ethereum-focused event, and Arbitrum should lean into that given its status as the leading Ethereum L2. These events provide substantial value, such as brand strengthening, community building, attracting developer talent, in-person ideation, and more.\n\nMany hackathons cost north of $1M with smart contract base layers like Near, zkSync, Avalanche, and others throwing events/hackathons with more than 1000 participants. It’s important Arbitrum remains competitive with these other protocols to ensure its ability to attract talent.\n\n## [](#specifications-5)Specifications\n\nGovHack will run for three days, boast a prize pool of $20k for GovHack participants, have t-shirts and other swag for attendees to get their hands on, and pre, mid, and post-event media production and storytelling to represent the voice of the DAO and to amplify the event on social platforms.\n\nGovHack is 3 events in 1: A 2-day hackathon-style bootcamp, followed by a 1-day Community Showcase, followed by an afterparty. Hack Humanity is looking to build on GovHack ETHDenver’s success and coevolve with the DAO over the long term.\n\n**For GovHack Brussels a full impact report and transparency around the event and its cost will be posted in the forum following its completion.**\n\n## [](#steps-to-implement-6)Steps to Implement\n\nOnce spending is approved by the DAO, funds will be sent to a ⅔ multisig to be converted into dollars. These dollars will be used to pay for the costs associated with running and organizing the event. Hack Humanity will provide event details on the forum so that the entire community can participate in the event’s scope and execution.\n\n50% of the funds will be paid to Hack Humanity upon this proposal’s approval. An additional 35% will be disbursed the week before the event, and the final 15% will be disbursed after the event concludes.\n\nThe 3 multisig signers will be: Klaus + Abdullah Umar (Arana Digital) + Krzysztof Urbański\nThe multisig address is (arb1) 0x03D47B06Cc95bAFf2a408cD7c735ed7e7142Edb9\n\n**Any excess funds from the $309k that are not spent on the Brussels event will be rolled over and used to fund future Arbitrum events, but only if the DAO votes to spend additional funds on future events before the end of August. If the DAO votes against further spending on events, or a proposal fails to pass by the end of August, the excess ARB will be returned to the DAO.**\n\n## [](#timeline-7)Timeline\n\nThe event will take place July 5, 6, and 7 (2024) in Brussels, Belgium directly before ETH CC. Given the strict timeline, we are hoping to proceed to Snapshot on Wednesday, April 24th (if delegates approve), in order to hopefully have funds earmarked by the end of May.\n\nMore details will be shared with the DAO in the weeks leading up to the event surrounding the specifics of GovHack.\n\n\\[![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/4/42a260b615c30651c8298cc735e633da0d719008_2_187x465.png)\n\n502×1246 40 KB\n\n]\\(https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/4/42a260b615c30651c8298cc735e633da0d719008.png)\n\nWith the expedited process as outlined, Hack Humanity will only have a ~5 week buffer to plan the event. It is paramount that if the DAO wants representation at ETH CC, we move with haste.\n\n## [](#overall-cost-8)Overall Cost\n\nBrussels is an expensive European city, and successfully executing a world-class high-quality IRL activation requires a significant budget.\n\nThe event’s research, preparation and delivery phase determines the exact event program design, local costs, the number of participants, any scholarships/stipends, etc. Getting the funds approved is the top priority so that Hack Humanity can begin to work out these details.\n\nThe all-in cost to execute this proposal is expected to be $309k, with a rough budget broken down in the following table:\n\nItem\n\nCost\n\nVenue, Food, Drink, Swag, room equipment, interior decor, printing, stationery\n\n$85,000\n\nMarketing, targeted contributor outreach, Pre/Post Event Media Production, AV equipment rental, hackathon management software and other licensing\n\n$33,000\n\nHackathon Prize Pool\n\n$20,000\n\nScholarships\n\n$10,000\n\nAfter-party + Contingency\n\n$50,000\n\nOn-site living costs (5 days, lead in, lead out day + 3 delivery days for a team of 7): Flights, Accommodation, Ubers, Food\n\n$13,000\n\nHack Humanity margin and fees. GovHack Director and assistant to design, organize, deliver the event. Designer, local Brussels event producer advisory, on-site GovHack delivery team (7). Post-event Impact Report, community engagement, handover.\n\n$98,000\n\n**Total Cost**:\n\n**$309,000**\n\n**Any excess funds from the $309k that are not spent on the Brussels event will be rolled over and used to fund future Arbitrum events, but only if the DAO votes to spend additional funds on future events before the end of August. If the DAO votes against further spending on events, or a proposal fails to pass by the end of August, the excess ARB will be returned to the DAO.**\n\nThe amount of ARB to be moved to the multisig will be determined in accordance with the dollar equivalent of the trailing 14D ARB TWAP with a 30% buffer. **After the ARB is swapped to USDC, any amount in excess of $309k will be immediately back to the DAO.**\n\nThe scope of this proposal to the DAO is specifically for ETH CC in Brussels. Hack Humanity intends to produce a subsequent proposal to provide a year-round program of events on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO, this will require a larger funding package, with a component to cover a full-time team & and a component for an event budget to cover a series of IRL events. Hack Humanity needs the ability to hire and maintain a dedicated team committed to Arbitrum, this uniquely enables high-context, up to date and relevant continual program design in lockstep with the needs of Arbitrum’s roadmap and community needs, it also enables Hack Humanity and team to commit and block calendar dates for future events 6-12 months in advance, secure venues, and team member’s time. This requires upfront funding.\n\nExpect another proposal for further funding in the coming months. We need this GovHack Brussels proposal to be executed swiftly so that the event in Brussels can be organized as soon as possible, hence our decision to seek funding only for this event rather than trying to pass a larger DAO spend.",

      "title": "Pilot Phase: M&A for Arbitrum DAO",
      "content": "Please review the forum post for full proposal details: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pilot-phase-m-a-for-arbitrum-dao/23588\n\n## Abstract\n\n### Context\nThe 8-weeks M&A pilot phase proposal is the next step toward the Arbitrum M&A proposal outlining the opportunity for Arbitrum DAO to form an M&A Unit focused on identifying and executing on acquisition opportunities.\n\nThe overarching aim is to utilize M&A as a key growth driver for the Arbitrum ecosystem and to help the DAO expand non-organically through acquisition opportunities that are not accessible to competing ecosystems, thereby critically enhancing Arbitrum DAO's capital allocation methods.\n\nFull details on the M&A proposal, its operational processes and structure you can find in the [Arbitrum M&A Core Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/m-a-for-arbitrum-dao/23205) \n\n### Pilot phase\nThe 8-week pilot phase is designed to provide the DAO with sufficient information to make an informed go/no-go decision regarding the further operationalization of the M&A unit and its funding requirements. It is the natural progression of a 6 weeks [Working Group sprint](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/start-of-arbitrum-m-a-working-group/22520/6) to develop an initial structure of the M&A unit.\n\nIn addition to conducting an in-depth strategy study on the value upside of M&A, analyzing strategic target areas, aligning them with key stakeholders (both online and at the GovHack in Brussels), and providing exemplary analyses on targets, the pilot phase should serve as a facilitated platform for in-depth discussions based on data rather than opinions.\n\n## Expected Outcomes\nThe dedicated goals of the pilot phase are the following:\n\n1. **Equip the DAO with sufficient knowledge** to make an informed decision about the operationalization of the fund.\n2. **Align the DAO on strategic target areas** by providing strategic analysis and coordinating key delegates and stakeholders.\n3. **Provide an orchestrated platform for discussion** of the efforts over an extended period of time to further sharpen the edges.\n\n## Deliverables\n\nThe pilot phase (as detailed in the proposal) will entail an 8-week sprint structured into 3 work packages and underlying deliverables below. \n\nThe insights from the analyses will be condensed into an assessment report to be presented to the DAO. Further, the GovHack at EthCC will be used for status update and facilitation of a working session.\n\n**1. Analysis of M&A value upside for Arbitrum DAO**\n**2. Development of strategic areas for Arbitrum DAO** supported by in-depth analyses, incl. alignment of target areas with key stakeholders in the DAO\n**3. Analyses of target examples** and presentation to the DAO\n\n\n\n## Budget Request\n- **Operational budget:** Minimal budget to cover cost for a lean team conducting the execution of outlined work packages: $25k ARB / month\n- **Access to Data Providers/Research Platforms:** $2k in ARB (remaining budget to be refunded to the DAO)\n\n\n## Team\nThe initiative will be led by a dedicated team from [Areta](https://www.areta.io/) - the leading independent crypto-native investment bank specializing in M&A and complex financial transactions for some of the leading ecosystems in the crypto space with deep M&A transaction expertise and involvement in Arbitrum DAO. \n\n*Special thanks to @jacobpphillips and @hiringdevs.eth for sparking the initiative at the GovHack in Denver, and the WG members for their continuous support.*",

      "content": "#### Proposal Overview:\nIn response to the need for enhancing security measures, we propose the onboarding of DeDaub, a renowned security services firm, to assist the ADPC. This proposal outlines the scope of DeDaub's engagement and the budget required from the ADPC’s funds.\n\n#### Services Provided by DeDaub:\nDeDaub will be responsible for:\nCrafting Technical and Business Requirements: They will develop the specifications for the Request for Proposal (RFP) directed towards potential security service providers.\nWhitelisting Assistance: Over a period of four weeks, DeDaub will aid the ADPC in evaluating responses to the RFP and whitelisting suitable security service providers.\n\n#### Background of DeDaub:\nDeDaub is a security services firm with a significant track record, having conducted over 200 audits across 14 different blockchain platforms, including partnerships with major entities like the Ethereum Foundation and Chainlink.\n\n#### Budget Request:\nThe total budget request (which will be taken from the ADPC’s current Multi-sig and will not require further extraction of funds from the ArbitrumDAO Treasury) for engaging DeDaub and ensuring operational flexibility for the ADPC is 22,000 ARB, broken down as follows:\n\n- 12,000 ARB for DeDaub’s services related to the RFP process and whitelisting.\n- 10,000 ARB as an operational buffer for the ADPC, to allow for quick response capabilities and to cover unforeseen expenses. This amount will be returned to the DAO’s treasury at the end of the ADPC’s tenure if not utilized.\n\n#### Justification for Budget:\nThe compensation for DeDaub is considered fair given the market rates for Security SMEs and the specialized nature of the services.\nThe operational buffer is essential for maintaining the ADPC’s effectiveness without frequent DAO approvals for minor expenditures.\n\n#### Approval Process:\nThis proposal requires the DAO’s confirmation via a Snapshot vote to allocate funds from the ADPC’s Multi-Sig wallet, which holds the necessary budget as part of the initial endowment. This action is needed due to the absence of prior explicit approval for these specific expenditures in the original DAO vote.\n\n#### Additional Notes:\nDeDaub, by providing these services, will be excluded from participating as a contender in the RFP, ensuring no conflicts of interest in the selection process of security service providers.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThe ADPC strongly believes that the onboarding of DeDaub and the approval of the proposed budget are critical steps toward enhancing our security infrastructure and maintaining the integrity of the ADPC's operations. We urge the DAO members to approve this proposal to facilitate timely and efficient execution of these essential tasks.",

      "title": "Double-Down on STIP Successes (STIP-Bridge)",
      "content": "![]()**Abstract**![]()\n\nThis proposal introduces the STIP Bridge, aiming to sustain and enhance Arbitrum’s market leadership by extending support to key protocols amidst intense competition from other Layer 2 solutions. It serves as a strategic interim solution, maintaining incentive alignment and ensuring continuous engagement of vital projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem until the Perpetual Incentives Program is initiated.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem is currently facing unprecedented competitive pressures, with significant incentive programs launched by rival Layer 2 networks threatening to attract our established protocols away. The STIP Bridge is crucial for retaining these integral projects, ensuring they remain committed to Arbitrum by providing timely, targeted incentives. This initiative is essential to preserve network growth, user engagement, and overall ecosystem stability in a highly dynamic market environment.\n\n# **Rationale**\n\nAligning with Arbitrum’s mission to support and nurture its development community, the STIP Bridge embodies our commitment to our builders and their contributions. It strategically addresses the imminent risk of losing key ecosystem participants to competitors by offering a seamless transition in incentive support. This approach not only retains critical projects and liquidity within Arbitrum but also sets a solid foundation for the impending comprehensive Perpetual Incentives Program, reinforcing our long-term vision of innovation and community empowerment.\n\n# **Specifications**\n\n### **Eligibility**\n\n* Any protocol funded under STIP or the Backfund is eligible to apply for a bridge grant coinciding with the LTIPP distribution window.\n* This will allow Arbitrum to ensure protocols that had success during the STIP campaign can retain their users and continue to focus on building on Arbitrum.\n\n### **Maximum Funding Size:**\n\nMaximum funding requests under this bridge grant are capped based on a percentage of the prior funding received under STIP:\n\n* Greater than 500k ARB: may make a funding request of up to 50% of their prior funding.\n* Less than or equal to 500k ARB: may make funding requests up to 100% of their prior funding, capped at 250k ARB.\n\n### **STIP Performance Audits**\n\nTo give the community a better understanding of how protocols utilized their STIP grants, audits will be conducted.\n\nOpenBlock Labs has been monitoring protocols included in STIP and reporting their data using [dashboards](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum/grantees).\n\nOpenBlocks will be providing closing remarks on all protocols they have data for. These summaries will include:\n\n* The percentage of STIP allocation that recipients used\n* The amount of unused funds recipient protocols returned to the incentives multisig\n* Should be any remaining amount of full allocation\n* Success metrics compared to similar control protocols\n* Insights into oddities that occurred during the incentive period\n\nAdditional analysis opportunities:\n\nAdditionally, this proposal team has already asked the ARDC that once they are prepared to provide additional analysis and insights to prepare for LTIP.\n\nThis is also a great opportunity for Arbitrum community members to use the data that OpenBlocks has been sharing in their open-source dashboards to create their own analysis. Community-driven analysis of the success of STIP will bring many interpretations of the data and help delegates make the most informed decisions. This analysis could be compensated via a portion of the research bounty budget from LTIPP.\n\n### **Advisors Help**\n\nThe [advisors](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/ltipp-regarding-our-role-instructions-for-applicants-and-open-questions-we-aim-to-answer/21297) from the LTIPP (JoJo, SeedLatam, Castel Capital) proved to be a tremendous help to applicants as they ensured protocols received quality feedback, a better understanding of how much ARB they should request, and possible incentive mechanisms to use. Additionally, the Advisors stay on to support the protocols during the program allowing each team to better learn and iterate through testing.\n\nThe LTIPP advisors have agreed to assist similarly during the STIP bridge. Protocols applying to the bridge will have the opportunity to meet with an advisor. This will help them gain insights into their proposals. This not only helps guide applicants through the process but also ensures the DAO will have better proposals to review.\n\nThe advisors will hold office hours during the Addendum period to help answer questions protocols have, and to discuss with them through the Discord infrastructure already leveraged during LTIPP, in a way they could provide feedback on both previous results and/or new mechanisms to integrate.\n\n\n\n### **Program Manager Role**\n\nThe STIP Bridge will include a program manager to help ensure the program runs smoothly. As seen in other programs, a single manager is required to ensure efficient and effective operations and to deal with the unexpected situations that ultimately appear.\n\nProject manager responsibilities:\n\n* Ensure Addendums are properly posted\n* Administer deadlines for various phases of the program\n* Handle COI with advisors\n* Help facilitate the posting of snapshots\n* Help coordinate with the multisig to ensure funds are properly distributed\n* Update grant recipients on program progress as streams start, run, and end\n\nMatt Stein from StableLab will serve as the program manager.\n\n### **How To Apply - Addendum on STIP Forum post:**\n\nAny STIP protocol wishing to apply will fill out the [Addendum template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tdpAZAopmragWobcY3MdlROJN0hU3y_cAn0JOkdpsOE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nAfter filling out the Addendum, protocols will post it in the newly formed “STIP Bridge Addendum” section of the forum. These posts should be titled “\\[Protocol Name] STIP Addendum”\n\nApplicants will be able to meet with an advisor during office hours to get feedback regarding their incentive plan and grant amount as protocols did with LTIPP.\n\nApplicants will have around two weeks to submit their Addendums. Beginning when the Tally vote becomes active and ending when the tally vote ends.\n\nApplicants can edit their Addendums as many times as they want until the deadline. Once the Tally vote ends Addendums are final and can no longer be modified.\n\n### **Challenge and Review Period**\n\nDuring this time between the tally vote and the optimistic snapshots, delegates will have a week to review Addendums and prepare to post challenge snapshots for applicants they believe require a closer look.\n\nAny delegate with at least 500K ARB delegated can put up a challenge snapshot using this challenge [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bA7fjU6Mnl_XXd_NYdLoQAgttKX1J8XwGzYn3SeLl8w/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nAny desired challenges should be posted to the forum during the Challenge and review period (May 4th- May 11th). They then must be posted to Snapshot during the Challenge Snapshot period (May 11th- May 18th).\n\n### **Voting and Approval Mechanism:**\n\n#### **Optimistic Approach**\n\nAn optimistic voting mechanism will be used to mitigate the potential for delegate fatigue from voting on 50+ proposals while still holding projects accountable for their overall performance within STIP and in general.\n\nThis optimistic model hopes to reduce the load on all delegates but ensure that the DAO’s full attention is placed on the more contentious proposals.\n\n#### **Initial Voting Mechanism**\n\nThe Tally vote will earmark funds to allow the DAO to distribute up to the maximum permissible grants.\n\nShould this Tally vote pass, all STIP protocols that properly submitted an addendum will be optimistically awarded a grant\n\n#### **Challenge Snapshot Process**\n\nIf the DAO feels some applicants should not be optimistically funded and require a closer look, any delegate with at least 500K ARB delegated may post a challenge Snapshot for a specific applicant.\n\nIf a challenge snapshot is posted, that applicant must receive at least 66% of the votes in favor of funding (Excluding abstain votes) in order to receive their bridge funding.\n\nDelegates may seek a full DAO vote at their own discretion if they believe that a project did:\n\n* (a) not fulfill their STIP requirements,\n* (b) failed to deliver tangible results during the STIP period or\n* (c) the amount sought in the bridge application would not result in an effective utilization of the DAO’s funds.\n\nThis will allow the DAO delegates to focus their available attention to more closely examine contested applications.\n\nAny desired challenges should be posted to the forum during the Challenge and review period (May 4th- May 11th). They then must be posted to Snapshot during the Challenge Snapshot period (May 11th- May 18th).\n\n### **Possibility of Extension**\n\nIn case the full long-term incentives program gets delayed, this proposal will have a built-in extension method to prevent another gap between incentive programs.\n\nIf 4 weeks before the end of STIP Bridge incentives distribution, another incentive program has not passed a snapshot, then we will post another extension directly to Tally that extends funds for protocols that received funds from LTIPP and/or STIP Bridge.\n\n## **Steps to Implement**\n\n* Send funds to LTIP multisig\n* Have applicants post Addendums\n* Conduct Performance audits\n* Have DAO members challenge contested proposals on the forum\n* Conduct individual Snapshot votes for any challenged application\n* Have successful applicants complete compliance\n* Start streams along a similar timeline as LTIPP protocols\n* Monitored incentives throughout the program as done in STIP\n\n## **Timeline**\n\nThis is a rough timeline. We aim to start the STIP Bridge around the same time as LTIPP.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/2103876f-7f5f-463b-8d14-a648c24c0dc0_original.png)\n\n## **Overall Cost: 37.6M ARB**\n\n### **Incentives Budget: 37,500,000 ARB**\n\nSee estimated amounts [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ic15cTQNoa6xyIJcp-X8OC175MaCLMPrXtMW5eT87sI/edit#gid=1867228162)\n\n### **Operational Cost: 100K ARB**\n\nA maximum of 100K ARB will be used for the operational budget. This could be used to cover the costs of the advisors, pm, multisig signers, additional audits, and or any other expenses that come up while operating the proposal. A separate snapshot will be published to allow the DAO to decide how these funds will be spent.\n\n# **Additional Documents:**\n\n* [Addendum template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tdpAZAopmragWobcY3MdlROJN0hU3y_cAn0JOkdpsOE/edit?usp=sharing) for protocols\n* [Delegate challenge template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bA7fjU6Mnl_XXd_NYdLoQAgttKX1J8XwGzYn3SeLl8w/edit?usp=sharing)",

These LP NFT will have yield-bearing properties. They can be locked for a period of time (2 days to 90 days) to increase % of LP rewards.\n\nEvery LP NFT will have its own unique spec like amount and lockup period. The yield boosting pools are the final destination where LPs can stake their LP positions (aka. LP NFTs) to receive ARB rewards.\n\nMilestone:\n\n![|602x83](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ONdV5dMAWkCtEQsnaYRGiR380rvFSbva7ymZOlEdwZ0g6mVVx-JENlLoraSpGZrKvao1W4VzhxbHqAb-uu1YPgNlwb2oVS0Vv9ApKaBOA1SYg1JFbezK1rfM1QtDuML2gz846SAZxuD6NzDhyIAHAw8)\n\n2.

In each league, the daily ranking will recognize the top 30 traders with the highest absolute PnL and 10 traders with the lowest absolute PnL, awarding points based on their ranking.\n\nBased on the total accumulated points with each day’s weight, a weekly rank is derived. The allocation of the total ARB incentives is distributed based on the weight of the accumulated points.\n\nMilestone:\n\n![|602x100](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/sR_7phnGTgRSdMTbsSHiGl-AzxGC2LVUpjKEqSYeOGuQM_yEf4qLscZX0mby-Ggip60n9OjR4wQzVFC9-_pIb9FNYqEWWsek5sh6OCyXLZX5QHS8ne_1QZv0Eb_aF5mb7NS_rTQDQiGCBGuCByHuZMs)\n\n3. Randomized reinforcement to increase trading frequency per trader (Jackpots): 10,000 ARB\n\nThe user qualifies for the jackpot if the position size is equal to or exceeds the minimum trade size.

Buffer employs an AMM-based model similar to GMX, where the Buffer Liquidity Pool (BLP) facilitates market-making for exotic options trading. Buffer runs on a similar AMM based model as GMX - where the BLP (Buffer Liquidity Pool) provides market-making liquidity for exotic options trading.\n\nFollowing our September 2023 launch of Buffer v2.5, we implemented stringent risk management strategies—including tighter open interest caps and spreads—to maintain positive expectancy for the AMMs and safeguard LP interests (a trajectory similar to that of GMX and GMX v2). During this time, due to market fluctuations and competitor activities influenced our trading volume and performance, leading to weeks of lower averages post-launch.\n\nRecently, we initiated the Bull vs Bear Trading Competition, which, coupled with a relaxation of our conservative risk management policies, has reignited interest and activity within the protocol. Currently, the daily volume averages over 16,000 USDC.\n\n![|602x336](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/xm8sr2SroZFuymX2xfpEQOzgwuuWOB2Kwow8YMfyoqnCtRU99PUGUkogECU_tO_k80MAz6sQnwJNtqguEZ5iRO4j3M7lJ6Nv8w_6SDyXIbCluxxP5QHQX7inIxp3gFAjKw4am7AIkRssIAeZY3Li09Q)\n\nBull vs Bear Competition Summary (the campaign is still ongoing, we are 3 weeks into it):\n\n* Week 1\n\n![|602x121](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/W8ibCJeyFsz3XboMrNXn2Mob4CBU-9GjBOHx1tKi9sXa052xZS6UdsrzKo11Rlw0XN_YuOsqoKnHBuTQTtKnhDbZ6OSa9PtnojCMODhS5TrrbaA0UBkSgj6-2SbitXTo_7lmotBEb0nI9m_gBxLKY6o)\n\n* Week 2:\n\n![|602x115](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/jWI8M8tG1qEKmWDf-sntfQ8DD30WI5t8cKFOl9ev_B-c2ZKAPqKXAXFvWZV8KrVoW4a24QhC43AQEqOA2fzbdKgne0aZ78xiz8y84-HlOoXAxk3oDF5nqkMoChJ6kAxwkpEvMBDRjKZtUT8094CoFu4)\n\n* Week 3:\n\n![|602x123](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qLx_VF4eKGaU80_LNfLNqOSO7izfe_ynltaTKvgid3cKajdqstaZLK8A36VlnczyMdJmVNCG1peLIaBmy3VPxwkURiYuN29sF5NYwmJYShvmwxUKJsg7BqNGbwtR5FT_IM1NtXph94aYDnmNvjiTeSo)\n\nAll competition related metrics can be found here:\n\nhttps://app.buffer.finance/#/leaderboard/galxe\n\nDashboard shows a significant uptick in trading volume as well as returning users: https://app.buffer.finance/#/dashboard || https://stats.buffer.finance/\n\n* Measures to prevent Wash Trading:\n\nBuffer’s League based competition makes gaming the system incredibly difficult. The competition is designed to reward consistent, ongoing performance instead of a single one-time score.\n\nPending rewards are accumulated based on rank on the leaderboard. Total rewards for each rank are calculated based on a geometric sequence - to ensure that each position on the leaderboard earns more than the place below it, rather than grouping leaderboard standings into equal reward buckets.\n\nTrading leagues will have a cap on incentives based on fees earned to prevent any wash trading – this is further prevented by being focused on PnL, although volume may play a factor.\n\n* Accountability and Implementation:\n\nOn top of our [Dashboard](https://app.buffer.finance/#/leaderboard/galxe?week=3) and [Stats](https://stats.buffer.finance/arbitrum) page, we set up Dune Dashboards for tracking metrics around the initiatives. We will commit to regular updates around the protocol performance, especially around metrics including:\n\n* BLP TVL\n* Trading Volume\n* Trading Fee Generated\n* User growth and retention\n* Effective prevention of wash trading around competitions.\n\n* Details on Social Features:\n\nAs the new incentive layer unfolds on Buffer, we will introduce several features to increase stickiness and drive trading activity:\n\n1. Revamped Optopi Collection: Optopi is a collection of 8,888 unique PFP friendly NFTs on Arbitrum offering key utilities to traders. We plan to revamp the Optopi utility to offer exclusive features including: exclusive access to trading leagues (higher tier in trading leagues), discounts while buying payout boosts.\n\n2. Chatting rooms: allowing users to engage directly with other users on the platform who are interested in that community or page.\n\n3. Trading Challenges: allowing traders to engage into battle royale-styled PvP challenges to facilitate user onboarding and community building.\n\n4. Low risk PVP trading: play tokens or virtual tokens that allow traders to trade risk free on Buffer.\n\n5. Social Trading: enable social trading, allowing users to follow and replicate top performing traders on Buffer.",

The source of these tokens are from early personal investment into Arbitrum.\n\n**Grant Breakdown**\nThe goal of this proposal is to establish a deeply liquid borrowing and lending market for ARB tokens. The funds matched by the Arbitrum DAO will be used exclusively to bootstrap the supply side in the two ARB markets. The funds from Micheal Egorov are used for the crvUSD/ARB/CRV pool and upcoming LRT/WETH AMM pools. Possible LRT tokens are weETH (ether.fi), ezETH (Renzo) and reETH (KelpDAO), which have decent liquidity on arbitrum.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-26 at 8.36.34 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreihn7esgqmy7jaqqz7bfkrdgsrsgsvqpf4do4253ojjvz26gjl4ct4)\n\nThe ARB will be deployed to the market/pool rewards as a supply incentive and direct LP incentive.\n\nOnce funds have been received, we will work with the Curve core team to deploy the grant.

Had we received the council feedback earlier, we would have promptly made the necessary adjustments to align with the council’s expectations.\n\nBecause of this discrepancy, we feel it is essential for delegates to reconsider the Synthetix LTIP proposal with the following edits:\n\n**Summary of feedback from Councillors/Delegates:**\n\n**1. Grant Size:**\n\n* The requested grant size of 4.5 million ARB is notably large, and it may take a long time for Arbitrum to recoup the benefit.\n* The grant size could potentially crowd out other grants to projects with fewer resources than Synthetix.\n\n**2. Incentive Design and Justification:**\n\n* More details are needed on the proposed trading competition and its contribution to the sybil resistance/wash trading score.\n* The Proposal lacks clarity in justifying the requested grant size and outlining a comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategy.\n* The Proposal would benefit from more concrete evidence and data supporting the expected impact on trading activity, liquidity, and user adoption within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n**3. Long-term Alignment with Arbitrum:**\n\n* Given Synthetix’s planned chain as part of the OP Superchain, there is a risk that the Proposal may, in the long term, draw users/liquidity/etc. outside of Arbitrum and be detrimental to the broader Arbitrum market.\n\n**4. Collaboration and Ecosystem Integration:**\n\n* More detail is desired on the proposed candidates for collaboration partnerships with other Arbitrum proposals.\n\n**TLDR Changes**\n\n* Total grant request reduced from 4,500,000 ARB to 2,000,000 ARB\n* Grant breakdown updated:\n  * 1,000,000 ARB for LP incentives (reduced from 1,600,000 ARB)\n  * 900,000 ARB for trading fee rebates (reduced from 1,800,000 ARB)\n  * 100,000 ARB for stablecoin liquidity (reduced from 500,000 ARB)\n  * Removed 600,000 ARB allocation for trading competitions and growth experiments\n* Incentives distribution timeline updated:\n  * LP incentives will be utilized throughout the entire three months, with an initial ramp-up period during the first month, to ensure there is proper liquidity to support open interest once Perps trading scales up.\n  * Stablecoin liquidity incentives & trading/growth incentives will be the focus of the second and third months\n* Milestones updated (scaled down due to reductions in grant sizing):\n  * Week 1-4: Reach 30m in LP collateral\n  * Week 4-8: Reach 5m in stablecoin liquidity\n  * Week 8-16: Achieve 5b in cumulative trading volume\n\n**Detailed Responses to feedback and Changes:**\n\n1. Grant Size and Allocation:\n\n* We have reduced the total grant request from 4.5 million ARB to 2 million ARB to better align with the LTIP Council & Delegate Feedback. This better aligns our proposal with the sizing in LTIP, and will provide valuable incentives to scale up Synthetix on Arbitrum.\n\n2. The revised grant breakdown is as follows:\n\n* 1,000,000 ARB for LP incentives\n* 900,000 ARB for trading fee rebates\n* 100,000 ARB for stablecoin liquidity\n\n2. Justification for Grant Allocation:\n\n**1. 1,000,000 ARB for LP Incentives:**\n\n* This allocation will enable us to achieve a critical mass of LP collateral, supporting the following collateral growth over a 3-month period (excluding trading fee rewards) - We’ve added this information from the request of the CounciCouncil * 20% APY: $27.3 million TVL\n  * 15% APY: $36.4 million TVL\n  * 10% APY: $54.5 million TVL\n  * 5% APY: $109.1 million TVL\n* A critical mass of LP collateral is essential to underwrite Perps Markets. Each $1 of liquidity provider capital allows Synthetix Perps to support $4 of major cryptocurrency open interest or $2 of longer-tail cryptocurrencies. This allocation will enable us to support approximately $70-100 million in OI caps, catering to whale traders and those transitioning from CEXs.\n\n**2. 900,000 ARB for Trading Fee Rebates:**\n\n* Capped at 75% of fees paid for users, this allocation serves two key purposes:\n  * Incentivize users to trade on Synthetix on Arbitrum for the first time, helping to market the product, onboard new traders, and ease them into our ecosystem.\n  * Incentivize LPs backing these markets, as they will receive a majority of the rewards.\n  * Based on the estimated fees rebated at 3-6bp and an ARB price of $1.10, the 900,000 ARB allocated for trading fee rebates translates to approximately $2.7-5.5 billion in fully rebated volume.\n\n**3. 100,000 ARB for sUSD Incentives:**\n\n* sUSD is a core component of our Proposal. Users can deposit LP collateral, delegate it to Perps V3 markets to underwrite trading and earn fees, and mint sUSD to pre-borrow against their trading fees. Ensuring deep liquidity for sUSD is critical to support this functionality and enhance capital efficiency.\n* At 10% APY, the 100,000 ARB allocation can support a liquidity pool size of approximately $6 million.\n* At 15% APY, the allocation can support a liquidity pool size of approximately $4 million.\n* At 20% APY, the allocation can support a liquidity pool size of approximately $3 million.\n\n3. Long-term Alignment with Arbitrum:\n\n* We understand the concerns regarding the potential impact of our planned OP Superchain on the Arbitrum ecosystem. Before anything else, we’d like to clarify that we see Arbitrum as a critical path of growth for Synthetix, and DeFi Derivatives as a whole. It has been the home of almost all onchain DEX Perps protocols, and we are excited to offer traders and LPs Synthetix V3 as another trading option. Additionally, we propose the following:\n* We will prioritize the growth and development of Synthetix on Arbitrum, focusing on driving users, liquidity, and activity to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n  * It is also critical to note that the Synthetix deployment on Arbitrum is exclusive in its usage of an Arbitrum native stablecoin to increase system capital efficiency, support for additional assets outside of USDC (like Ethena sUSDe/USDe), and existing integrators ready to support this deployment.\n* We will work closely with the Arbitrum community and other projects to foster collaborations and integrations that benefit the entire ecosystem. There are ample opportunities for existing players, and due to the composable nature of Synthetix V3, we are excited to utilize these to increase the usage of Synthetix for Arbitrum native users.\n  * We’ve already passed a proposal with Ethena to support their stablecoin as collateral, and intend to onboard many more Arbitrum native assets as collateral types.\n* Clarify that Synthetix does not intend to bridge users to another chain through this program. We see a critical pathway to grow on Arbitrum as a home for DeFi Perps, and we intend to grow alongside the chain to grow onchain DEX Perps on Arbitrum.\n\n4. Collaboration and Ecosystem Integration:\n\n* We have identified several potential candidates for integration/asset support partnerships with projects on Arbitrum. These including existing ecosystem partners - Kwenta, Polynomial, Rage Trade, Infinex, and more.\n  * Additionally, at the asset level, Synthetix V3 can support any collateral type with an onchain oracle. Governance has already approved sUSDe/USDe as collateral on the platform and DAI/USDC/ETH/ARB.\n  * In the future, we intend to support yield-generating collateral types to increase the amount of composability, this will include (subject to governance) Lending Tokens (aave, comp, etc), sDAI from MakerDAO, LRT’s, LST’s, BTC on Arbitrum, and so on. We’ve listed this on our Proposal as well.\n\n5. Removed from the Proposal\n  * Trading Competitions/Growth Experiments - We’ve removed these from the Proposal due to council feedback.",

      "content": "## Summary\n\nClipper is submitting an amended proposal per the [Clarified Process for Non-Council Recommended Applications](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/clarified-process-for-non-council-recommended-applications-to-move-to-snapshot/23257). Clipper’s original LTIPP proposal for 249,004 ARB included components for Liquidity Mining and incentives for Clipper User Migration to Arbitrum. This proposal was rejected in a 3-2 decision. The judges highlighted three areas where Clipper’s application could be improved:\n\n* Three expressed concern that the requested liquidity mining grant size is too large relative to Clipper’s current TVL.\n* Three said the execution plan/milestones is sparse.\n* One said the data seems hard to believe, and think the applicant conflates an address with being a unique user.\n\nClipper has made revisions to the initial proposal:\n\n* Amended the application to 174,308 ARB from 249,004 ARB\n* In particular, Clipper decreased the liquidity mining component request by 40%, to 74,308 ARB from 123,846 ARB\n* Added specific milestones for each component including specifically user acquisition targets\n\nApplication Revisions have been posted to the Arbitrum forum:\n\n* https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/clipper-ltipp-application-draft/21726/5\n\nLink to Original Application\n\n* [ https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/clipper-ltipp-application-draft/21726/5 ](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/clipper-ltipp-application-draft/21726/5)\n\n### Milestones\n\nPer the judge’s feedback, Clipper has enhanced its execution plan and added monthly milestones to improve accountability.\n\nLiquidity Farming\n\nTotal Duration: 12 weeks (10 weeks + 2 weeks setup)\n\nTimeline: Once the grant is received, the team will need 2 weeks (maximum) to deploy and fund the farming pool contract on Arbitrum. This technology is already battle-tested since we’ve used it for past incentive programs on other chains.\n\nAfter this, the program will begin and incentives will be distributed gradually over the course of 10 weeks.\n\n* Month 1: ARB Farming contract is live, TVL has risen 25% from baseline;\n* Month 2: TVL has risen 60% from baseline\n* Month 3: TVL has risen 100% from baseline\n\nUser & TVL Migration\n\nTotal Duration: 12 weeks (10 weeks + 2 weeks setup)\n\nTimeline: This program will begin on the same day the liquidity farming program begins, so as to create the dual-reward incentive. Rewards will be distributed to LPs upon migration to Arbitrum, for the duration of the 12-week program. The key milestone for this program will be achieving the target 5% conversion rate. A mid-point milestone will be achieving a 2.5% conversion rate.\n\n* Month 1: Airdrop is executed and more than 50% claimed; 1,000 Clipper LPs have successfully migrated to Arbitrum pool.\n* Month 2: Airdrop is >75% claimed; 2,500 Clipper LPs have successfully migrated to Arbitrum pool.\n* Month 3: Airdrop is >90% claimed; 4,000 Clipper LPs have successfully migrated to Arbitrum pool.",

For instance, a previous initiative saw a 150% increase in TVL over a six-week period. This success underpins our confidence in achieving the set targets.\n    - **Incentive Plans:**\n        - **Liquidity Provider Incentives:** To achieve a $6M TVL with a competitive 20% APR, the required incentive is calculated at $1,200,000 annually. For the specific campaign period of 12 weeks, this translates to an estimated need of $266,666. At an ARB price of $1.15 (as of April 25, 2024), this equates to approximately 231,883 ARB tokens.\n        - **Trading Volume Incentives:** Aiming for a $15M daily trading volume requires incentives for trading fee rebates projected at $130,000 over 12 weeks. This corresponds to about 113,043 ARB tokens, recalculated with the current ARB price of $1.15.\n2. **We have added detailed milestones:**\n    \n    **Grant Timeline and Milestones:**\n    \n    - **Milestone 1:** Successfully deploy the dPoints system on Arbitrum. Announcement by the end of Week 1.\n    - **Milestone 2:** Stablecoin pair TVL reaches $4 million, average daily volume reaches $6 million by the end of Week 4.\n    - **Milestone 3:** Stablecoin pair TVL reaches $6 million, average daily volume reaches $10 million by the end of Week 8.\n    - **Milestone 4:** Bridge stablecoin LP into the newly launched Orbit L3 DODOchain, ensuring sustainable TVL and trading volume for the pair after the incentive period ends by the end of Week 12.\n3. **TVL growth**\n    \n    DODO has recently announced the launch of the [layer 3 solution DODOchain](https://x.com/DODO_chain/status/1782431708752859395), the first restaked rollup powered by Arbitrum Orbit, focusing on integrating liquidity from other chains. Securing this LTIPP grant will significantly boost the TVL and trading volume on Arbitrum, attracting new users from other ecosystems, who will lock up their assets through our LP pairs on Arbitrum and eventually bridge to DODOchain through the official Arbitrum Bridge.",

      "content": "Following the initial feedback of LTIPP Council, Tradao would like to re-submit its LTIPP application.\n\nThe full proposal can be found here:\n\n[https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tradao-ltipp-application-final/21884](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tradao-ltipp-application-final/21884)\n\n## Request: 100,000 $ARB (Reduced from 190,000 $ARB)\n\n### Feedback Summary:\n\nThe council feedback could be summarized as:\n\n1. Wintermute: Criticized the large grant request, unverifiable metrics, and lack of anti-sybil measures\n\n2. GMX: Lack of product-market fit and transaction numbers. Found the grant request to be inefficient and the incentive strategies unproven.\n\n3. GFX: Highlighted concerns about the large grant size and the challenge in verifying Tradao's metrics. Recommended revising the application with enhanced sybil protection measures and to consider feedback from multiple reviewers for a future submission.\n\n### Key Metric Update\n\nAs Tradao's permissionless copy trading function launched in early March before the LTIPP application program deadline, the metric of copy trading cannot fully reflect our product-market fit. Here is some update about our metric.\n\nPrevious\n\n* Trading volume: 27,920,792\n* Traded: 828\n* Address: 66\n\nNew\n\n* Trading volume: 70,540,917(Copy Trading) + 11,053,160(Direct Referral)\n* Traded: 2,576\n* Address: 153\n\nSource:\n\n1. https://dune.com/patrick_tradao/tradao-dashboard\n2. https://www.gmxreferrals.com/arbitrum (Search Code: Tradaox)\n\n### Key Adjustment\n\nIn response to feedback from the Council and recent dencun upgrade, we propose resubmitting the application with a reduced grant amount by removing the rebates of GMX's excution fee, eliminating trading competition and wallet generation incentive.\n\nSetting the new grant request at 100K ARB, we will implement the following incentive scheme:\n\n* Increase the total transacted volume via Tradao\n  * Currently at $1.63M daily volume\n  * Targeting ~$3M daily volume\n* Incentivize fee rebate → less cost to trade → more trades → more volume and likely users\n* As Tradao is totally free to every user, we don’t charge any cost from users. This means all the costs are the gas fee and the fee charged by GMX. We will rebate 80% of open fees back to users. To achieve this, at a target of $3M daily volume and 100 daily transactions, across 12 weeks, it would require:\n  * USD equivalent = ($3M * 0.06% * 80%) * 365 * 12/52 = $121.29K\n  * ARB amount = $121.29K / $1.2 = 100K ARB at $1.2\n\n## Expected milestones\n\nInitial unlock 33% of ARB\n\nMilestone 1: 84m Trading Volume (66% of ARB unlocked & 33% of ARB distributed)\n\nMilestone 2: 168m Trading Volume (100% of ARB unlocked & 66% of ARB Distributed)\n\nMilestone 3: 252m Trading Volume (100% of ARB unlocked & 100% of ARB Distributed)\n\nThe Tradao team agrees to return to the Arbitrum DAO any unused ARB funds once the 12-week LTIPP program is concluded.",

      "content": "Deri Protocol has updated the incentive mechanism and justification based on the council’s feedback, applying only 30% of the originally proposed grant.\n\nLink to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/deri-protocol-ltipp-application-final/21566 \n\n### Requested Grant Size:\nUSD equivalent: $230,769\nARB amount: 115,385 ARB at $2\n\n### Justification\nTo determine the size of the grant we should request, we chose to benchmark against the current TVL increases that we’ve seen so far with our DERI incentives program. As detailed below, we expect to see at least a 250% increase in TVL heading to Arbitrum during the lifetime of this grant.\nWe target an average of 20% APR in ARB in our pool. To achieve this level of rewards for LPs on $5M TVL across 12 weeks, it would require the following:\nUSD equivalent = $5M * 20% *12/52 = $230,769\nARB amount = $$230,769/$2=115,385 ARB at $2\n\n\n### Council Feedback: \nGFX Feedback)\nWe are supportive for 30% of the grant spend proposed. The remaining 70%, however, is to rebate users fees paid to the applicant. This is hard to support for several reasons. Firstly, the applicant hasn’t demonstrated that fee waivers worked to increase (and then retain) volume before asking for a large amount of funding. Secondly, rebating fees paid to the applicant, as opposed to gas or third party fees, is equivalent to governance directly giving the applicant funding. Thirdly, when fees are at or approach 100% and also are fees to the applicant, this creates a perverse incentive for the applicant to encourage wash trading, sybil farming, or steering the grant funds to rebate the highest margin trades. We recommend the applicant revise and resubmit in future grants cycles with either a different distribution mechanism or significant guard rails to address the concerns above.\n\nWintermute Feedback)\nhis application was decent and scored well across various criteria. Their execution strategy was clear however, it lacked any form of justification or calculations on how they intend to reach their milestones and KPIs. Incentives for LPs were not benchmarked against market rates and they just targeted arbitrary numbers for TVL and daily trading volume.\nTheir requested grant size is on the large end and is not sufficiently justified, this is further compounded by a lack of daily users.\nLastly, we are not sure if spending 70% of this grant on trading rebates are the best use of DAO funds.\nWe will not be supporting this application.\n\nKarel Feedback)\n    \nVote AGAINST Deri's proposal.\n\nDecent proposal but unable to endorse for following reasons: (i) 70% of grant is set to go to the applicant as a fee rebate vs. end users is outside of LTIPP scope and may lead to misaligned incentives to encourage wash trading/sybiling/etc.; and (ii) insufficient justification on how they will achieve target milestones/KPIs.\n\nConsider resubmitting with just the 30% grant size focused on LP rewards and greater justification on the above.",

      "content": "### Summary\nRage Trade is submitting an amended proposal per the [Clarified Process for Non-Council Recommended Applications](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/clarified-process-for-non-council-recommended-applications-to-move-to-snapshot/23257).\nTo recap, Rage Trade submitted [a proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rage-trade-ltipp-application-final/21621) to run weekly and daily trading competitions in the LTIPP initial review round. The proposal aimed to allocate 100% of the LTIPP grant to onboard and reward users via these competitions. The focus was on trading competitions rather than fee rebates because competitions could significantly level the playing field  — ultimately boosting participation. The initial proposal was, however, declined by the council due to two issues: \n- A large ask (1.25M ARB)\n- Too few details on how wash trading risks are handled during the competition.\n\nRage Trade has now made amendments to the initial proposal, including: \n- A reduced ask of 425k ARB \n- Highlighting already existing wash trading measures, including: \n   - Enforcing a minimum trade size\n   - Calculating trader ROI based on the average collateral used during a competition round to ensure fairness between large and small traders\n\nLink to Application Revisions:\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rage-trade-ltipp-application-final/21621/14\n\n### Revised feedback:\n- [GFXlabs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rage-trade-ltipp-application-final/21621/15):\n> As one of the initial reviewers, we feel our concerns were addressed and would score this proposal considerably higher. The applicant correctly identified and revised the areas of the grant plan we scored as the weakest and would likely receive a passing grade from GFX if reevaluated formally.\nAs a reminder, the LTIP pilot rules did not allow applicants the ability to revise after formal submission, and so were not able to react to feedback in real time from reviewers.\nAs a second reminder, all reviewers have their own opinions and views, and may or may not overlap on some topics.\n- [404DAO](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rage-trade-ltipp-application-final/21621/16):\n> As another reviewer of Rage Trade’s application, we also echo that our initial concerns have been addressed with these revisions. In addition to the revised grant size, Rage Trade has provided a more detailed execution plan that now includes prize distributions and the allocation breakdown between Daily & Weekly competitions. Lastly, we are pleased to see additional thought put towards preventing wash trading in the competitions.\nAs a delegate, we will be supporting this application once it goes live for a vote.\n- [Coinflip](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rage-trade-ltipp-application-final/21621/17):\n> Rage Trade has been a long time integration partner of GMX supporting us with various vaults and now aggregation solutions. I’m glad to see them having taken the feedback from the LTIPP council and brought forward a much improved proposal including revised sizing.\nGlad to confirm support as a delegate for this proposal.\n\n### Key Rage Trade v2 Stats \n- **Total Volume Traded**: $500 Million \n- **Launch Date**: 30th November 2023 (~5 months since launch)\n- **Number of Perps Integrated**: Five (GMX, Hyperliquid, Aevo, dYdX, Synthetix)\n- **Number of Traders**: >3000",

In their commitment to align with Arbitrum's expectations and ecosystem, they significantly reduced their initial grant request by 50% and refined their strategic objectives to enhance trading excellence, market stability, and widespread engagement within the ecosystem.\n### Key Adjustments:\nGrant Size Reduction: From 250,000 $ARB to 125,000 $ARB to address council concerns about the original grant size and ensure responsible allocation of resources.\n\nFocused Objectives:\n\n* Trading Excellence and Activity: Allocating 40,000 $ARB to boost trading via competitions.\n* Liquidity and Market Stability: Enhancing liquidity with a targeted 40,000 $ARB, focusing on a tiered incentive structure adjusted to the current $ARB price. This includes incentives for reaching up to $2M TVL.\n* Trading Engagement: Increasing trading engagement through raffles and rebates totaling 45,000 $ARB.\n### Council Feedback Response:\n* Addressed Wintermute’s concerns on grant justification by halving the request and detailing fund distribution.\n* Integrated GMX’s suggestions for clearer grant size justification and a phased funding approach.\n* Responded to Karel’s feedback by ensuring milestones are based on tangible, proven results.\n\n### Conclusion:\nCVI’s revised proposal aligns closely with Arbitrum’s goals for growth and innovation. By scaling down the request and focusing on key performance metrics, CVI is committed to demonstrating the value and effectiveness of the project within the ecosystem.",

      "content": "Abstract\n\nHack Humanity is seeking $309k of funding from the Arbitrum DAO to host an event and after-party coinciding with ETH CC 1 in Brussels, Belgium. Arbitrum GovHack Brussels will take place as a 3-day event on July 5, 6, and 7, the days directly prior to the start of the conference. ETH CC is only 11 weeks away, so approving the funds ASAP is of the utmost importance to ensure that Arbitrum has a strong presence at one of the most important Ethereum-centric events of the year.\n\nHack Humanity intends to continue serving the DAO by planning IRL activations and will seek additional funding in the coming months. The time constraints for ETH CC have led us to propose funding solely for this event in hopes of an expedient proposal process prior to asking the DAO for a larger funding package that ensures a long-term and optimal solution for Arbitrum DAO’s event participation.\n\nGovHack Brussels aims to:\nBuild trust and deepen relationships between Arbitrum contributors\nIdeate and later implement proposals that benefit Arbitrum\nAttract new talent to the DAO\nPosition Arbitrum as the go-to home for talent to build and the DAO as a world-class operation maturing and innovating at the forefront of decentralized governance\n\nGovHack Brussels, improves on and expands GovHack ETHDenver with additional prize pool, the introduction of a subsidy pool for high-value contributors, enhancing and running a proper community showcase day, and adding a dedicated afterparty.\n\nKey Funding Notes\n\nAny excess funds from the $309k that are not spent on the Brussels event will be rolled over and used to fund future Arbitrum events, but only if the DAO votes to spend additional funds on future events before the end of August. If the DAO votes against further spending on events, or a proposal fails to pass by the end of August, the excess ARB will be returned to the DAO.\n\nThe amount of ARB to be moved to the multisig will be determined in accordance with the dollar equivalent of the trailing 14D ARB TWAP with a 30% buffer. After the ARB is swapped to USDC, any amount in excess of $309k will be immediately back to the DAO.\n\nThe scope of this proposal to the DAO is specifically for ETH CC in Brussels.",

      "content": "Following the initial feedback of LTIPP Council, Connext would like to re-submit its LTIPP application.\n\nThe full proposal can be found here: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/connext-ltipp-application-final/21579/8\n\n The council feedback could be summarized as:\n\n* Incentives should go more towards users\n* Lack of benchmarking with other bridging projects to justify LP requests\n\n## Key facts about Connext:\n\n* Connext is positioned as a B2B2C protocol, serving apps (and indirectly their users). The protocol has experienced tremendous growth with innovations like its Restaking from Anywhere module, which allows users to restake their LRT from Arbitrum.\n* Connext facilitated and brought more than **$285m of LRTs to Arbitrum** in the last 3 months.\n* Connext volume through Arbitrum in the last 30 days was $280m\n\n![9a6944cf3c15fffb87f1cfd385e5ed1d338c6fcd_2_1035x363.png](ipfs://bafkreig6ai5hdwafn7dmsgjvvhnadl6a7buu72xnyu36ilrq5ycbz2kngi)\n    \n**Connext wants Arbitrum to succeed, and their priority remains to attract more users to bridge into Arbitrum and Restake ETH on the L2.**\n\n## Goal of the LTIPP incentives\nIncrease ETH TVL in the pools to provide better pricing for its integrated apps and their users\n\nHow (new strategy post feedback):\nincentivizing users who bridge into Arbitrum by subsidizing part of the bridging fees. This will further boost the utilization of the pools which will attract more liquidity. Higher TVL enables the best pricing when the Restaking module is used.\n\nIncentivizing users to bridge into Arbitrum has 2 benefits:\n\n1. It helps more users to bridge away from mainnet fees, onboarding them permanently onto Arbitrum\n2. It helps to rebalance the AMM pool, as the restaking activity tends to unbalance the pool in the opposite direction. Having a balanced pool means that users restaking ETH don’t incur a negative price impact.\n\n## Changes from previous requests:\n\n* **Remove any liquidity incentivization for  routers and LPs, and shift focus towards users** \n* **Refund 95% of the fees to the users bridging into Arbitrum, up to 13bps**. Fees vary depending on the origin chain (from mainnet it’s 9bps, from other L2s, 13bps) so only the actual fees incurred will be refunded.\nFees will only be subsidized to users who are onboarding to Arbitrum (from any other network), and users exiting Arbitrum will not get subsidized.\nThis is fully aligned with other crosschain protocols that saw their requests approved.\n\nThe estimate (according to the average of the last 7 days at the time of writing the original proposal) is for users to bridge 137k ETH during the pilot program.\n\nBridging fee rebate: 137,000 * 0.0013 (max fee) * 0.95 = 169 ETH\n\nTot ask: 446,472 ARB (1 ETH = 2,646.75 ARB at the time of writing)\n\nNote: pricing the ask in ARB vs ETH as the pair is less volatile\n\n## Expected milestones\n\nMonth 1: 45k ETH bridged into Arbitrum (30% of ARB distributed)\n\nMonth 2: 90k ETH bridged (60% of ARB)\n\nMonth 3: 137k ETH bridged ($100% of ARB)\n\nThe Connext team agrees to return to the Arbitrum DAO any unused ARB funds once the 12-week LTIPP program is concluded.",

      "content": "ACryptoS did not receive enough votes in the LTIPP Screening Period to be automatically moved to Snapshot for a DAO vote. After adjusting its proposal with the Council's feedback, they are applying for the LTIPP.\n\nLink to updated ACryptoS LTIPP proposal (post-Council feedback):\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/acryptos-ltipp-application-final/21572/12\n\n---\n\nACryptoS protocol is a liquidity manager for V3 Concentrated Liquidity DEXs. They believe that some of the Council's feedback was due to some misunderstood information written in the initial proposal, and that these concerns can be clarified in their updated forum reply.\n\nThe Council's feedback were also generally positive aside from the mentioned concerns. With the grant ask relatively low at 80k ARB, and the product innovative with good performance, they would like the DAO to review their proposal, hoping to qualify for the LTIPP grant and continue contributing to the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n---\n\nSummary\n\nProtocol Type: Automated Conc. Liquidity Manager (ACLM) for V3 DEXs\nLTIPP Grant Ask: 80,000 ARB\n\nGrant Breakdown: \n100% of the grant will be distributed as incentives to ACryptoS ACLM liquidity providers on Arbitrum, across 10-15 under-capitalized vaults over a 12-week period. The ACLM strategies serve to improve overall liquidity efficiency on Arbitrum, and also bring more yields to users.\n\nNotes on Retention of Liquidity:\nACryptoS's ACLM strategy have shown great performance since its launch last year, prioritizing generation of sustainable yields through swap fees. While there has been organic growth in TVL, the grant incentives serve to attract more initial liquidity, while also providing a way for the protocol to gain valuable exposure. This then allows the strategies' strong APY performance to speak for themselves and attract users organically.",

      "title": "Subsidy Fund for Security Services",
      "content": "[Non-constitutional] \n\nExecutive Summary\nAs voted on in the ADPC proposal, one of the key tasks of the ADPC was to conceptualize and structure a subsidy fund for the Arbitrum DAO. This proposal intends to set up this subsidy fund, seeking up to $10 million worth of ARB to be administered and selected by the Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (hereinafter referred to as the ‘ADPC’) to facilitate the selection of projects that will benefit from the whitelisted security audit service providers selected via the ADPC’s procurement framework. The ultimate decision will be made by the ADPC based on the Means Test and the Application Process Terms 13.\n\nProposal Request\nWe propose the creation of a procurement subsidy fund allocating up to $10 million worth of ARB to provide financial assistance to both new and existing projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThese subsidies will be exclusive to a pre-approved whitelisted set of security audit service providers, selected by the ADPC, who will publicly display their fees. This approach eliminates the need for the ADPC to assess the reasonableness of funds requests.\n\nThe aim of the subsidy fund is to incentivise participation and growth among smaller projects helping them to overcome barriers to entry, such as challenges to acquire funding to pay for the cost of robust security audits.\n\nThe figure of up to $10 million worth of ARB has been determined via a benchmarking exercise conducted with various security audit service providers. This form 4 was shared with these service providers and based on the responses of 10 service providers (including the likes of Spearbit, Halborn, Nethermind, Three Sigma, Guardian, Zellic, etc.) on their scope of services and fees associated, we have estimated that each project will require a 2-month security audit at an average cost of $200K. This will enable the ADPC to potentially fund up to 50 projects; however, it should be noted that the average of $200K is an estimate and fees are usually specific to each project, each project requires a scoping exercise, and audit costs will vary based on the size of the codebase, complexity, etc.\n\nWe ask delegates delegates to choose between following options for the initial size of the fund and length of the program:\n- Do not fund the program\n- 1 cohort of 8 weeks (2 months) for a total fund size of $2.5 million\n- 2 cohorts of 8 weeks each (4 months) for a total fund size of $5 million\n- 4 cohorts of 8 weeks each (8 months) for a total fund size of $10 million\n- Abstain\n\nPlease review the forum post (linked below) for a full proposal description and discussion.",

      "content": "Title – Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: ArbitrumDAO Contribution; Safeguarding Software Developers’ Rights & the Right to Privacy\n\nAbstract & Rationale - This proposal envisages a monetary contribution to DEF & Coin Center from the ArbitrumDAO to continue their policy, litigation & advocacy efforts in relation to open-source software & software developers’ rights.\n\nSteps to Implement - The steps to implement the AIP, including associated costs, manpower, and other resources for each step where applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, any AIPs involving transactions with third parties (such as grants) will need to ensure that applicable legal documentation and procedures are also included.\n\nTimeline - TBA\n\nOverall Cost - [Dependant on DAO vote]:\n\nFund with 500,000ARB each;\nFund with 750,000ARB each;\nFund with 1,000,000ARB each;\nFund with 1,250,000ARB each;\nFund with 1,500,000ARB each;\nDon’t Fund.\nProposal authored by Axis Advisory 1\n\nContext & Preamble\n\nThe digital asset industry has been faced with recent legal challenges in relation to a software developer’s individual freedom to contribute to the development and subsequent deployment of open-source permissionless software. This goes as far back as 1990 when Phil Zimmerman released Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), one of the first openly available public-key cryptography applications that featured end-to-end (E2E) encryption. Zimmerman’s creation prompted a criminal investigation that was eventually dropped, resulting in federal court decisions that protect encryption under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment. This clash on personal privacy became dubbed the “encryption wars.”\n\nOur team over at Axis Advisory has published a write-up that offers contextual information in relation to the above: Defending Open Source: A United Stand for Developer Rights and Software Freedom 4\n\nIn this regard, we are proposing a contribution from the ArbitrumDAO to DEF & CoinCenter to continue their policy & litigation efforts in relation to privacy-enhancement tooling and software developer advocacy. Some of the institutions’ most notable contributions with an industry-wide impact will be noted hereunder:\n\nCOIN CENTER\n\nCoin Center’s case against the Office of Foreign Assets Control about adding Tornado Cash to the OFAC Sanction List, (naturally, Tornado Cash not being a person or entity but a mere set of open-source smart contracts running on the Ethereum Blockchain). Albeit the court ruling against Coin Center in the initial proceedings, Coin Center is currently in the process of appealing the judgment.\n[Refer: Coin Center is suing OFAC over its Tornado Cash sanction].\n\n[Refer: https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flnd.447304/gov.uscourts.flnd.447304.74.0.pdf];\n\nCoin Center’s concerns raised to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) regarding the designation of convertible virtual currency (CVC) mixing as a primary money laundering concern (PMLC). In this regard, Coin Center highlighted the rule’s extensive scope and lack of precedent. They argued that the proposed designation lacks clarity and narrowly tailored definitions, potentially leading to the misclassification of legitimate transactions as criminal.\n[Refer: Comments to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network on “Proposal of Special Measure Regarding Convertible Virtual Currency Mixing, as a Class of Transactions of Primary Money Laundering Concern”]\n\nCoin Center’s letter to the Senate Finance Committee highlighing the need for a regulatory approach that mirrors the successful, light-touch framework applied to the internet. Coin Center advocated for clear taxation guidelines on cryptocurrency transactions, emphasizing the importance of a de minimis exemption for minor gains from every transaction to facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies in daily commerce without undue tax burdens.\n[Refer: Coin Center Suggestions to Address Uncertain Tax Treatment of Digital Assets]\n\nCoin Center’s contributions to Roman Storm’s and Alexey Pertsev’s legal defensen in relation to the following:\nRoman Storm’s legal dispute in relation to accusations levied against his person on charges of conspiracy to facilitate money laundering, operate an unlicensed money transmitter and violating sanctions [Court of New York]; and\nAlexey Pertsev’s legal dispute in relation to accusations levied against his person on charges of facilitating money laundering [Netherlands Court].\nDEFI EDUCATION FUND\n\nSome of the DeFi Education Fund’s most notable contributions with an industry-wide impact will be noted hereunder:\n\nThe DeFi Education Fund initiated a legal challenge against a patent held by True Return Systems, LLC regarding blockchain technology, challenging the novelty and validity of its claims. This action reflects DEF’s commitment to preserve the digital assets space’s core values: fostering innovation, ensuring open access, and maintaining an inclusive environment. By contesting what DEF consider to be an overly broad patent, they aim to prevent potential monopolistic control, ensuring the decentralization is not compromised.\n[Refer: https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_0b48beb0dd404637b4d988988b1bf3fc.pdf].\n\nThe DeFi Education Fund filed a legal complaint along with Beba LLC against the SEC, after they recently created and distributed their ‘BEBA token’ via airdrops. Beba and DEF are seeking legal relief due to concerns that the SEC may classify BEBA tokens as securities, which could end up hindering not only their business operations but also the broader digital asset market. In essence, the DEF are fighting against the SEC’s approach towards digital assets which has become overly broad without adequate rule-making procedures, stifling innovation.\n[Refer: https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_3f7a8f2ca6614d7381122cb1beeed4a8.pdf].\n\nThe DeFi Education Fund submitted an amicus brief in support of James Harper against the IRS, advocating for the Fourth Amendment rights of cryptocurrency users. DEF emphasizes the need to balance law enforcement’s reach with individual’s financial privacy in the digital realm. They are arguing for a modern interpretation of privacy protections to reflect the realities of digital transactions and the traceability of cryptocurrency activities on public ledgers.\n[Refer: DeFi Education Fund Files Amicus Brief In Coinbase Case].\n\nThe DeFi Education Fund also contributed to the support of Roman Storm’s legal defense arguing against the novel legal theories proposed by the government under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and money laundering statutes. DEF emphasizes the importance of distinguishing software developers from the actions of third-party users, in order to protect software developers from being held liability for third-party misuse of their open-source.\n[Refer: https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_063f9d1fd563466cadfa3f5434f918e9.pdf].\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\nCoin Center Contribution\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO is being provided the opportunity to vote & effect a contribution to Coin Center; the leading non-profit research and advocacy center focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency and decentralized computing technologies.\n\nBy way of a brief; Coin Center’s mission is to defend the rights of individuals to build and use free and open cryptocurrency networks: the right to write and publish code – to read and to run it. The right to assemble into peer-to-peer networks. And the right to do all this privately.\n\nCoin Center has been at the forefront of policy research, educating policymakers and the media about cryptocurrencies, advocating for sound public policy, and engaging in litigation to defend digital civil liberties of software developers and other stakeholders within the industry.\n\nDeFi Education Fund Contribution\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO is being provided the opportunity to vote & effect a contribution to the DEF whose mission revolves around educating policymakers globally about DeFi, promoting grassroots supports, enhancing legal support across jurisdictions, and advocating for policies welcoming of decentralized financial infrastructure.\n\nThey have initiated several key projects and grants to advance its objectives. One of their initial endeavors targeted a group of organizations and individuals, with the goal of expanding the understanding of decentralization and the DeFi ecosystem among policymakers.\n\nAdditionally, the DEF is taking a stand against how some governments interpret laws in a way that could establish a troubling precedent, potentially discouraging software developers in various fields. They pointed out the risk that developers might face legal action for their open-source code if it is misused by other for illegal activities. This could place developers are risk of being held criminally responsible for actions they didn’t partake in, possibly affecting them years or even decades later.\n\nPlease review the attached forum post for the full proposal and discussion.",

      "title": "Delegate to Voter Enfranchisement Pool — Event Horizon",
      "content": "Please review the forum post for full proposal details: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-to-a-public-access-public-good-citizen-enfranchisement-pool-through-event-horizon/21523/24\n\n## Summary\n\nEvent Horizon is a public good. It is a public-access metagovernance block. With the aim of enfranchising the tens of thousands of small voters, this proposal suggests we delegate (not grant) 7,000,000 ARB to a public access-voter block subject to a 1 year renewal. This delegation gets mobilized by Voter Pass and Gitcoin Pass holders functionally giving underrepresented DAO citizens multiplied voting power and therefore more incentive to express their voices. The Gitcoin DAO has [recently passed](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0xb2094445891a515a6c58d8b44c4c2428e66d2e5f1f1e81a2741036eb97e6d6e8) a proposal supporting Event Horizon, thereby making our Citizen Enfranchisement pool the #6 delegate on Gitcoin. \n\nWe also request a grant of 50k ARB to help the team maintain this public good across this 1 year experiment in addition to retroactively awarding the team for the fully-functional product thus far built out of pocket for the Arbitrum community over the past several months. \n\n## Problem\n\nToday, typical Arbitrum voter participation rate floats in the low single digits. However, there are thousands of individual voters who participate in each vote despite having effectively no meaningful say. They should be rewarded with a voice. Moreover, there are likely tens of thousands more incredibly talented community members who are very capable of adding to the collective cognition of the ecosystem, but simply lack the capital means to have a voice and are left discouraged from voting at all. Not voting when you only have, say, $500 worth of ARB doesn’t make sense, it’s a drop in the bucket. Sitting out governance proposals is, unfortunately, the rational decision but collectively makes everyone worse off. The strength of the DAO is directly related to the number of participants having their voices heard by the community. The governance platform and vote multiple that Event Horizon gives to these citizens incentivizes greater participation: our average participation rate is 30%.\n\n## Mechanism\n\nArbitrum Citizens interested in governance may mint a free, soul-bound Voter Pass which allows them to take part in mobilizing this voter enfranchisement pool subject to an additional Gitcoin Pass requirement to prevent sybil attacks to be implemented soon after delegation. As detailed further below, this model:\n\n1. Grants a clear and meaningful voice to statistically low capital DAO citizen voters regardless of their financial means\n2. Incentives participation with additional governance authority, not inflationary rewards\n3. Incentives participants interested in governance itself, not financial gain\n\nDAOs today rely exclusively on individuals and company entities to serve as network delegates. However, this isn’t the only option. While individual delegates certainly add incredible value to the Arbitrum Ecosystem, so would a governance allotment dedicated to the greater body of smaller citizen participants.\n\nIn this regard, Event Horizon slots into the Arbitrum ecosystem in a similar fashion to a standard delegate. However, rather than the block voting based on the decision of one individual, it votes with the collective cognition of hundreds of individual voter pass holders.\n\nThis serves two functions:\n\n1. It provides a clear and designated voice for smaller, citizen voters.\n2. It drives participation through a game-theoretic process called Implicit Delegation.\n\nOne of the greatest barriers to participation is lack of voice due to lack of capital. Implicit delegation and public access governance changes this. Implicit Delegation is a model by which the full public governance block mobilizes in favor of the consensus of those who do vote, thereby implicitly delegating the authority of those who don’t vote to those who do.\n\nWhen participation is low… each voter receives a larger slice of the public access pie. This means the fewer people there are voting, the more incentive there is for someone new to come and participate.\n\nWhen participation is high… there are more voters splitting the same pie, however, citizen participation is high, which is a win for the ecosystem.\n\nWhere Direct Governance allocates influence along the lines of capital, and Explicit Delegation allocates influence along the lines of popularity (which often reflects capital), Implicit Delegation allocates influence to those who care most: people showing up to vote. \n\nBecause the entirety of the block is always mobilized, those who are most vested are rewarded for their participation by having a larger share of the voting pie. In this regard, Event Horizon’s model leans into a systemic lack of participation to create a solution.\n\n## Rationale\n\n7,000,000 ARB would place the Event Horizon community as the 15th largest delegate. Based upon significant dialogue with existing Arbitrum delegates and stakeholders, we think this places a fair amount of power into the 3rd pillar of governance, namely citizens (the other two being organizational and individual delegations) without being large enough to flip any typical proposal.\n\n## Benefits compared to Token Incentivized Governance:\n\nWhile token rewards for participation hold legitimate merit and are an intuitive remedy for low turnout, it has limitations.\n\nMisaligned Incentives: Token-based incentives attract returns-interested parties. However, when it comes to governance, participation is most valuable when it comes from those interested in participating not payout. Implicit delegation directly appeals to these individuals as it rewards those who participate, not with capital, but with greater voting power.\n\nAdded Thought Capital: in line with the notion above, there are likely thousands, of community members each holding both strong ideas and valuable contributions for the ecosystem, but simply lack enough voice to justify participation. Through Implicit Delegation, any community member of the Arbitrum ecosystem has an opportunity to have their voice heard, bringing thousands more minds and ideas to the surface.\n\nInflationary: While token rewards drive participation at the expense of inflation, Implicit delegation simply leverages its game theory model to increase incentive to vote in the form of a greater voting share. This does not cost the token any inflation, nor the treasury any ARB.\n\nNon-scalable: Token-based rewards are finite and require a constant drain of ARB funds to continue driving participation. As the ecosystem scales, and more participants join, greater and greater sums of ARB will be needed to continue fueling growth. Implicit delegation has no cost, and its balanced game theory functions with no burn. \n\n## Specification\n\n**Past Performance**\n\nThe above is not just theory. The Event Horizon community is already active on Ethereum providing meta-governing public goods to Uniswap, AAVE, Compound, ShapeShift, and of course, Arbitrum. In fact, in several recent Uniswap votes, the Event Horizon community was the 10th largest voter in the Uniswap Ecosystem. Event Horizon has also recently voted as the 8th largest delegate in recent Aave votes. Gitcoin DAO just voted to make Event Horizon the 6th largest delegate in the DAO via delegation.\n \n![Screenshot 2024-04-16 at 3.03.39 PM.png](ipfs://bafybeibev6xxizm6o3t75i6ykaepxsdsst7uusfhrfnjcg7dwdhweu76qe)\n    \nSince its inception, the Event Horizon protocol has placed over $28M of governance authority and enfranchisement directly into the hands of the citizen voter, a feat not seen anywhere else in the DAO space. Some more metrics worth highlighting:\n\nVotes Processed on Behalf of Retail voters: $28,000,000\nNumber of Metagovernance Proposals Passed: ~250\nVoter Participation: >30%\nAverage Authority Mobilized Multiple: >8,000x \n    \n## Mechanisms\n\nStep 1 – Duplication: Once a delegation is established, Event Horizon begins automatically duplicating all base DAO (in this case Arbitrum) proposals within its own voting portal.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-16 at 3.05.02 PM.png](ipfs://bafybeicutfnm3gvojnx6pfd6ei2omh2frxwzcasj6ujthwznw7pagwlm7e)\n\nStep 2 – Metagovernance: Retail voters may mint a free voter pass and begin voting to decide how the retail enfranchisement pool is mobilized in the base DAO proposal.\n \n![Screenshot 2024-04-16 at 3.05.29 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreihuusuap534xe3r2mypdroiw4xri6orova73u62v6snbxvrsaqrpi)\n    \nStep 3 – Base DAO Voting: 24 hours prior to the closure of the base DAO proposal, the Event Horizon metagovernance proposal closes. Event Horizon then automatically pushes the consensus decision established by the retail community during the metagovernance proposal into the base DAO proposal.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-16 at 3.05.50 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreiczmh4orexqbiafeecq2366glb5hqwtdhjqsr3w4sxtdj2mruudbm)\n \n## Steps to Implementation\n\nThe primary step to implementation would be the delegation and grant of ARB to the EventHorizonArbitrum.eth SAFE. After initial delegation from the DAO Event Horizon handles everything from there. Event Horizon will facilitate and maintain all elements of the pool from pass minting to metagovernance. \n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nThe Arbitrum Event Horizon Oversight Committee: A committee of 5 existing, notable delegates will be voted on by the Arbitrum community to be given the ability to guide the Event Horizon voting pool on matters of Arbitrum metagovernance. A simple 3/5 majority would allow this committee to veto the decisions of the voter pool within the 24 hours between the closing of the Event Horizon proposal, and the underlying DAO’s proposal.\n\nWe also partnered with Gitcoin to add Gitcoin Passport requirements shortly after initial delegation to mitigate sybil risk.",

      "content": "## **Summary**\n\nAs we near the end of allocating the initial grant budget (link to proposal), where through the [Arbitrum Grants Program 14](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/) run via the Delegated Domain Allocation model by Questbook, $912k has already been allocated to over 60 proposals. Based on the overwhelming response and number of quality proposals the grant program has received, we propose to start a new program for the Arbitrum Grants via DDA through Questbook with a budget of $4,000,000 spread across 4 domains over the next two quarters. We have received great feedback and support from the community, builders, and domain allocators for requesting additional budget and continue funding projects through the delegated domain allocation model.\n\n## **Background and Progress**\n\n[The Arbitrum grants 14](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/), administered via DDA by Questbook and 4 domain allocators, (Cattin, Adam, Juandi and JoJo) went live on the 5th of October with a total [grants budget of $800k 6](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook-arbitrum-dao-grants/14688) spread across four domains. Since the launch of the grants program, the Arbitrum domain allocators approved proposals requesting $912k and disbursed a total of ~$394,000 to accepted proposals from a pool of 201 proposals. These domain allocators [**were elected from the community and by the community. 3**](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-dao-grants-domain-allocator-nominations/15759/72) The specific information regarding the accepted proposals and the funded teams can be found [here 14](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/).\n\nAs previously stated in our initial proposal, Questbook launched the grants program to further scale it based on proposal volume and learnings from the first ever grants program in the Arbitrum Ecosystem. The Arbitrum Grants run through DDA has received overwhelming response, receiving over 200+ proposals since launch.\n\nPlease find below the Arbitrum DDA Grant Programs funding breakdown of relevant metrics and insights and proposed improvements going forward.\n\n## Program Overview\n\n* Total Proposals: 201\n* Total Proposals approved: 60\n* Proposals by domain\n  * [Gaming 3](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0xbf93fc6825b5e9ba9a3d7fcf3d14cdfcf3b4c734\\&chainId=10\\&role=admin\\&proposalId=0x4a1): 51\n  * [New Protocol Ideas: 2](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x4494cf7375aa61c9a483259737c14b3dba6c04e6\\&chainId=10\\&role=admin\\&proposalId=0x500) 57\n  * [Dev Tooling: 3](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x706bc8efecb6002f00a052fe5688d0eb89ea45f4\\&chainId=10\\&role=admin\\&proposalId=0x503) 42\n  * [Education, Community and events: 4](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x650b4a0dc2aec18f55adb72f13c5d95631db04be\\&chainId=10\\&role=admin\\&proposalId=0x472) 51\n* Approved Proposals by domain (81/193 milestones completed)\n  * Gaming: 16\n    * 18/44 Milestones Complete\n  * New Protocol Ideas: 15\n    * 8/49 Milestones Complete\n  * Dev Tooling: 12\n    * 17/38 Milestones Complete\n  * Education, Community and events: 15\n    * 38/62 Milestones Complete\n* Grant Amounts committed by domain ($) - $912k allocated , 394k Paid out\n  * Gaming: 249K\n    * 107k Paid out\n  * New Protocol Ideas: 264k\n    * 65k Paid out\n  * Dev Tooling: 166k\n    * 84k Paid out\n  * Education, Community and events: 234k\n    * 138k Paid out\n\n### **Overview of Accepted and Funded Proposals with DA Report**\n\n**New Protocol Ideas Domain**\n\n1.

The Price fluctuations of the Arb tokens in the program were of concern for the program, as the overall budget which was denominated in USD kept fluctuating through the term of the grant program. In order to avoid a price fluctuation like that, and based on the feedback received on the Questbook DDA program feedback call from the DAO and delegates, an option is to convert all the Arb received at the time of the proposal passing to Stable coins immediately, to avoid fluctuation.\n2. As many projects have not completed their milestones yet, and with the milestones not having a due date for completion, a problem we foresee is these funds if the projects do not complete them may be locked for ever, or for an indefinite amount of time. If the projects complete their proposals post the program time, there is no structure in place to have the DAs review them post completion and fund them, as the program would have ended by then. To avoid this, for the next program, fixed deadlines will be set for a grant, where either the proposal can be taken over by a seperate team, or the funds can be clawbacked and allocated to another proposal.\n3. Work hour restrictions for DAs was limiting their ability to maximise their impact on the program, as they were only allowed to deliver 60 hours of effort a month. Based on the program so far, we realise that a time restriction only inhibits the DA from their ability assess proposals and support them more deeply, and therefore are suggesting a fixed monthly pay for the work a DA and PM does instead of pay on an hourly basis.\n4. Some of the proposals or conversations projects had with Quesbtook could not be followed on with a funding due to the soft cap established on the program to start with. To tackle this issue, and with the Arbitrum foundation grant ranging from $50-250k, we believe the program should increase its cap to $50k to cover the gap and accept a wider number of proposals.\n5. While all feedbacks, changes and evaluation were timely reported in the Questbook platform, was nonetheless necessary for DA to engage with grantees through chatting systems like Telegram and Google meet. This has generated some questions from the community as a whole regarding inhomogeneous communications ways. We will address this by standardizing both the report frequency, the template used, and especially by setting up a shared discord between all domains. 1:1 calls between DAs and teams will still be needed.\n\n### **Proposal**\n\nBased on the impact and insights derived from Arbitrum DDA program, we propose renewing the Program with a budget of $4M for two quarters. The domain allocators will utilize this budget to fund proposals that align with Arbitrum’s roadmap. After researching, gathering feedback from domain allocators, active community members, and builders, we propose supporting the same domains as the previous program:\n\nDomainDomain AllocatorProposed BudgetNew Protocol IdeasJojo$920,000GamingAdam$920,000Dev ToolingJuandi$920,000Education, Growth, Community and EventsCattin (Seed Latam)$920,000\n\n**RFPs, acceptance criteria and specifications for each domain**\n\n1.

Education, Growth, Community and Events - [Link](https://www.notion.so/e8e86fbd9ee349beb0d9046607dae812?pvs=21)\n\n* We propose increasing the allocated grants budget for all domains equally to a higher budget based on the number of proposals received in the previous round.\n* Additionally, in the first round we set a soft cap of $25,000, and we propose increasing the cap to $50,000, with a few more steps for approving a grant that is larger than $25,000, requiring the involvement of two DAs to approve a proposal rather than just the specific domain allocator.\n* Considering the previous softcap being half of what is currently proposed, and that for an average of $220,000 for each domain the program was able to run for around 3.5 months before being maxed out, we project that providing 4X the amount of the previous iteration to each domain should allow the program to constantly allocate, at the same rate or even higher, for the full 6 months projected duration\n* The increased cap will allow the Questbook Program to keep covering the bootstrap belt of grant between $1,000 to $25,000 while, at the same time, be able to serve larger protocols that inherently might have larger needs.\n\n### Specifications and Implementation\n\nSimilar to the model implemented in the initial program, the renewed grants program will be run using [**Delegated Domain Capital Allocation Model 1**](https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/). Each *domain allocator* will run their respective domain on-chain for full transparency using Questbook. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible to the community.\n\nWhile the program has produced, accordingly to preliminary conversation with protocols and delegates, good results, we want to address and integrate the feedbacks so far proposed and partially covered in the previous section, such as:\n\n* have better accountability for the increased soft cap\n* define a more robust and structured set of rules for applicants, in regards to providing a timeline for their project(s)\n* define a cost for the management and verification of milestones after the program is completed\n* define a plan to manage the volatility of funds being distributed by the DAO in ARB token.\n\nThe DA will evaluate all the proposals through the rubrics provided for each domain, with the following framework:\n\n* in case of request below or equal to $25,000, the evaluation process will be the same of the previous iteration, with rubrics being evaluated and scored by the specific DA\n* in case of request above $25,000, and below the new soft cap of $50,000, the evaluation will involve a second DA, chosen by the first one based on the proximity of the specific expertise and knowledge to that proposal, that will have to publish a second evaluation of the rubrics alongside the score. Assuming N rubrics, scored from 1 to 5, the grant will be approved only if both the DA will give each a scoring equal or above to N\\*3.\n\nThe disbursement of the grant will take place on-chain from a multi-sig wallet controlled by the program manager & the domain allocator. The domain allocator will approve or reject the application based on evaluation rubric. A Grants SAFE, with 3/5 multi-sig, between the program manager and 4 domain allocators will be setup. We will then have 4 SAFEs for each of the domains with a 2/2 between the program manager and the specific domain allocator. The funds for the grants program will flow from the treasury into the Grants SAFE. This SAFE will hold the funds related to operational costs, committee compensation, and the grants budget. Funds that will be disbursed to the proposers will reside in the domain-level SAFEs.\n\nAfter the end of two quarters, the grants committee and the Arbitrum community shall evaluate the performance of each domain using publicly available data and decide to eventually, renew the program and, if so, change any specification of the domains, the domain allocators or the program manager.\n\nTo ensure predictability of the funding of the program and a proper runaway, upon receiving the amount from the DAO, the DAs alongside the PM will convert it in stables. If the protocols request it, specific grants or milestones might be paid in $ARB by converting the needed amount at the moment of payout.\n\nArbitrum DDA program closed accepting new proposals from mid February. If the program will be renewed in the terms above, the DDA program will take care, alongside the evaluation of new proposal, to keep evaluating the milestones of the previous program, thus allowing for the continuity of the previous iteration in an accountable way for grantees.\n\n### Compensation\n\nSourcing, reviewing, funding, marketing, tracking and nurturing proposals requires **significant expertise and time commitment** from the grants committee members and they should be fairly and competitively compensated for their efforts. Based on the learnings from the previous program specified above, we believe that opting for a fixed payment structure over an hourly paid model may be more impactful for the program. DAs and PMs have months where the work goes above and beyond the work hours mentioned, which does not get compensated accordingly, and there are constraints to work hours and impact a DA can provide within the limited hours provided. This indeed also impacted the turnaround time, alongside some technical difficulties.\n\nWe propose the following payment structure for the PM and DAs, with a base salary of $100/h and an increased projected workload of DA by 33% compared to the previous program, in consideration of the fact that DA not only have on average worked more than what initially was expected in the previous program, but also that they will need to spend time to cross evaluate all proposals above $25,000. On the other hand, the compensation of the PM is instead unchanged.\n\nWe are also adding overhead for an extra 6 months, equivalent to 20% of full-time salaries, for the Domain Allocators and the PM to keep evaluating the milestones of the grantees after the natural end of the program. This will ensure the proper continuation of the program and the followup with grantees, despite the program potentially not being renewed if so decided by the DAO. In case the program would be renewed with the same structure and people, or in case the milestone verification would come to an end before the due time, any leftover would be given back to the Arbitrum DAO.\n\nRoleMonthly CostTotalProgram Manager and Questbook$10000$60,000\\*Domain Allocator$8000$192,000Overhead for extra 6 months$8400$50,400Operations Cost, Misc.$10,000Totals:$312,400\n\n* Note: Questbook will provide the grants committee its grants orchestration tool at a cost of $5000 per month, included in the numbers above with the PM’s payment.\n\nAs per the above, the current costs to run program would be 7.8% of the overall budget of the grant program.\n\n* We suggest that the grants committee continue with [Synapse 1](https://www.synaps.io/) for KYC services and [Docusign](https://www.docusign.com/en-in) for all contractual agreements, as we have been using these services throughout the Arbitrum DDA program 1.\n* However, for any specific asks from the grants team in order to run the process more smoothly, Questbook will charge for any additional feature requests based on the development overhead through a retrospective grant proposal from Arbitrum at the end of two quarters.\n\n### KPIs and Expectations\n\n**Program Success**\n\n* Increase in the number of contributors, proposals, and funded projects\n* Increase in milestone and proposal completion rates\n* Increase in NPS score from all proposers and grantees\n* Lower response turn around time to delegates’ and community’s queries\n* Diversity in projects being funded across technologies, geographies, and demographics, to name a few. We encourage the community members to review the proposals across different domains during community calls regularly\n* Timely publishing of comprehensive monthly grants report, outlining the status, progress, and impact of the program, ensuring transparency and accountability\n\n**Enhanced Community Involvement**\n\n* Increase in community engagement across :\n  * Discourse\n  * Discord, Telegram\n  * Social media (Twitter, Reddit)\n* Increase in the community members’ participation to keep domain allocators and program manager accountable (measured by the number of people looking at the dashboard and participating in the program)\n\n**Brand Awareness**\n\n* Strengthened contributors’ sentiment and word of mouth towards Arbitrum measured through frequent sentiment surveys/ polls to gauge satisfaction\n* Enhanced Arbitrum’s brand recognition and awareness within contributor circles through surveys or social media analytics, tracking mentions, reach etc.\n\n**Contribution of Funded Projects to Arbitrum**\n\n* Number of users onboarded by the funded proposals onto their app/protocol\n* TVL (if applicable) of the selected proposals\n* Number of new interfaces for supplying / borrowing / governance interactions\n* Number of projects that have raised follow on capital after getting a grant from Arbitrum Questbook program\n\n### **Domain Allocator Roles & Responsibilities**\n\n* All Domain Allocators and the Program Manager will continue to uphold their designated responsibilities as outlined in the Arbitrum DDA Program 1 proposal.\n* Domain allocators may request an audit for the considered/accepted proposals, particularly those that involve Solidity code being deployed into production and directly impacting Arbitrum with an high spending cap. In order to streamline the code auditing process and avoid potential time-consuming challenges, the domain allocators will provide assistance to the considered/accepted proposals by offering feedback on code quality and design.\n* As an addition to the previous iteration, projects will have to submit a proposed timeline for their project. The maximum time to complete the final milestone will be 1 year from the start of this iteration of the program (equivalent of 6 months after the natural end of it); after this date, all undistributed funds related to grant that did not complete their milestones will be given back to the Arbitrum DAO\n* The DAs, alongside the PM, will publish every 45 days in the Arbitrum governance forum a comprehensive report of the current status of the approved applications.\n* Every 2 weeks, the DAs will host a public office hour for protocols to come in and request information about any detail they might need to understand to apply to the grant program. This public call will also be used to provide general feedback on the ongoing program and will also let delegates and other stakeholders ask for information about it\n* Similar to the Arbitrum DDA program 1, the Program Manager will collaborate with the Arbitrum Foundation team and the elected domain allocators to **create and list out necessary RFPs** in order to ensure alignment with Arbitrum’s priorities and roadmap.\n\n### **About Questbook**\n\n* Questbook (YC-W21) is a decentralized grant orchestration tool, currently being/previously used by Polygon, AAVE, Celo, Solana, TON, Aleph Zero etc.\n* Considering the achievements of Arbitrum DDA program, as well as the time commitment and operational expertise necessary for running an effective grants program, Questbook will continue in the role of the Program Manager. Srijith from Questbook will keep his role with the responsibilities of the Program Manager.\n\n### Method for converting Arb to Stablecoins\n\nIn the process of converting Arb tokens to stablecoins, we are requesting for 30% additional Arb in notional USD terms to make sure that there are $4M in the multisig in the end of the process due to any price actions, and whatever is extra, will be returned back to the DAO post the conversion.\n\nIn addition, if there is an important downturn in the value of Arb from the beginning of the Tally vote towards the end which affects the value received in USD terms significantly, we would potentially putup a second vote to re-fund the leftover USD needed as per the original $4M request.\n\nQuestbook will work with Aera, in collaboration with Gauntlet, thanks [@Matt\\_Gauntlet](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/matt_gauntlet) for your help with this collaboration.\n\nThe following description is from the Aera team on the process of converting the Arb received to stablecoins.\n\nAs part of their engagement with the DAO, Questbook will be leveraging Aera to diversify out of the ARB tokens into USDC. Aera has engaged with the DAO previously to create a detailed report on treasury management. This report spoke in-depth about execution dynamics for ARB and specifically around the onchain impact of small and large ARB liquidations, particularly that there was outsized market impact relative to the size of liquidations from having grantees in individuals selling ARB themselves. Aera introduces a concept of Protocol Owned Execution (PoE), where the DAO would own the execution out of the governance token via Aera to achieve better execution on the whole.\n\nIn the context of the Questbook proposal, the flow for using Aera looks like the following:\n\n[image1664×608 85 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1d07eb28313bf4842dc100683a752d5fc3e19551.png)\n\n!<https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1d07eb28313bf4842dc100683a752d5fc3e19551_2_690x252.png>\n\nTo clarify how this works:\n\nQuestbook multisig will be the owner of the Aera vault. This gives only the Questbook Multisig the ability to withdraw and deposit from the vault at any time, as well as select which assets can be held, and which DeFi protocols can be interacted with.\n\nThe Guardian of the Aera Vault will be Gauntlet. Gauntlet acting as a guardian submits rebalance transactions against the vault to sell ARB for USDC.\n\nExecution will be done in batches to prevent a outsized price impact. Furthermore, Aera has the ability to conduct operations under specific slippage requirements, if desired.\n\nThe Aera vault has hooks in place that prevent >3% loss per day due to guardian interactions, and it disallows interaction with anything not previously approved by the Owner (Questbook Multisig).\n\nQuestbook is looking to generate $4M in USDC from selling ARB. One risk here is that price fluctuations in ARB bring the initial ARB allocation below the needed $4M USDC notional. While there is fundamentally no way to mitigate this entirely (From Mar 13th - 19th the price of ARB dropped >30%), it is possible to hedge this by asking for a sufficient buffer. Given historical drawdowns a 30% additional ARB buffer (in notional USD terms) should be sufficient.\n\nFor this proposal of converting the Arb to stablecoins, Aera will be using Bebop as the primary exchange and Uniswap as a fallback. Bebop is an onchain exchange that taps into a solver network. Bebop is critical for this proposal due to its ability to tap into offchain liquidity (which is much deeper than onchain liquidity). In concept, Bebop is similar to CoWSwap in how it taps into an offchain network of solvers. Uniswap will also be enabled as part of the Aera vault, and will be used in a fallback capacity. Uniswap has the deepest onchain liquidity for ARB on Arbitrum, and we will use it as a fallback should Bebop have worse execution.\n\nOne important question is why Bebop and Uniswap and not other aggregators or exchanges. In many ways Bebop is an aggregator already, solvers filling orders on Bebop can tap into whatever onchain or offchain liquidity sources they want in order to fill an order. As such Aera doesn’t need to explicitly tap into alternative DEXes or Aggregators to fill orders.",

Interesting model allowing you to leverage + hedge LP through lending markets and like the achievement (points) system to gamify activity. Current levels of adoption is lacking. It's a somewhat large requested grant size which is at par to current TVL to-date on Arbitrum and relative to their activity. Objectives are lofty (boosting TVL to $2.2M - ~24x what it is today on Arbitrum) but could be a worthwhile investment for the DAO to help bootstrap them the protocol. Will receive grant only if they achieve KPIs. For bringing this to the DAO.\"\t\t\n\n*404 Feedback)*\nPrimex provided very little links for the council to verify the data presented, but after looking through their app, we see that’ve begun to get some traction on Arbitrum. The grant ask is a little high relative to their current usage and we would have appreciated more granular details around how they plan to raise their utilization across some of their targeted pools. Overall though we were pleased with their execution strategy and milestones and believe this should move to a DAO vote, given the relatively low ask and current traction starting to increase.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThe grant proposal could have been significantly strengthened by identifying a past success, presenting data on the cost effectiveness of that mechanism, and then utilizing the grant funds to scale or replicate that prior success. \n\n*GMX Feedback*\nFirstly, while the requested grant size seems justified based on the outlined incentive program, the objectives and execution strategy lack specificity and clarity. The proposal lacks detailed plans for achieving the stated goals, such as boosting liquidity and increasing trading volume, within the specified timeline. We are not generally supportive of Primex Finance’s application. The DEX space is heavily saturated and it’s not clear to me what exactly Primex brings that’s new to the space.   \n\n*Wintermute Feedback: Conflict of interest*",

It was well-written and provided a good amount of information for all relevant sections. Their infrastructure and product are unique and promote network effects within the Perp DEX space.\nThe justification of the grant size is okay, but rather ambitious in their end goal.\nThe main concern with this application is that there are very few first-order or second-order effects that are captured by Arbitrum as all trading is done on their app-chain (which is built on the OP Stack).\nSo the main benefit for Arbitrum is that their users can deposit into a vault and earn yield.\nGiven these concerns, we don’t think this initiative is worth funding and do not support this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\n\nThe applicant requests a moderate amount of funding, has a clear and easy-to-monitor execution plan and milestones, and appears to be modestly growing without the grant. We believe the grant funds requested are appropriately sized to try to double down on recent growth. We recommend this grant be funded.\n\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\n\"Vote AGAINST Orderly Network's proposal.\n\nComprehensive proposal that ranked well in the rubric (distribution, strategy, etc.). Grant size is sized well when taking into account the moderate traction they've seen to-date. Milestones/KPIs are lofty to ~4x+ TVL and 3.5x their DAU throughout span of the LTIPP. Agreed with Wintermute's comments on effects being driven to their app-chain which is built on OP Stack. Given this and their differentiation at the product and end user experience level vs. other perp DEXs on Arbitrum, don't think this meaningfully contributes to supporting Arbitrum's competitive position in the market.\"\t\t\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nThe proposal submitted by Orderly Network is comprehensive, revealing a well-thought-out strategy for achieving growth and innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Their clear roadmap, detailed execution plan, and specific KPIs demonstrate a commitment to achieving tangible results. By offering competitive APRs and incentivizing user participation in various products such as Deposit Vaults, Quantum Pools, and Algo Trading Tools, Orderly aims to attract new users and increase TVL on Arbitrum significantly. The proposed grant will enable them to implement these initiatives effectively, ultimately driving adoption of Arbitrum among diverse user segments and enhancing the overall ecosystem's vitality. We would be supporting the proposal. \n\n*404 Feedback)*\nOrderly Network presented a very complete application and they have seen impressive growth over since launch. Overall, they had detailed milestones with trackable success metrics, detailed KPIs, and a clear execution strategy. We were concerned about the long term and 2nd order benefits Arbitrum would see from this grant since Orderly operates its own app chain. However, we believe they have sufficiently justified their grant request and will be supporting their application.",

They provide clear and concise explanations of their milestones, KPIs, and objectives.\nTheir product is innovative and unique and attempts to solve a major problem for one of the largest DeFi categories. We really like their esARB mechanism which should create a notable amount of supply side benefits post LTIPP. Their execution strategy is sound and their TVL estimations and calculations are sufficiently justified.\nUnfortunately, they are a niche product that is complex and may not appeal to a lot of users which is indicated in their lack of adoption. Nonetheless, there still seems to be some baseline of activity.\nTheir requested grant size is on the larger end for their protocol usage, however, given the points above we think it’s sufficiently justified.\nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThis application largely suffered from being a very large request relative to the TVL and age of the protocol. It would also have benefited from more details around under what conditions or guidelines the incentives would be deployed, as they currently appear to be very discretionary for the applicant. Recommend the applicant resubmit in future grants cycles once there is more history and an initial success to build upon using grant funding.\n\n*404 DAO Feedback)*\nGammaSwap presented a strong application, scoring well across most of the rubric. We did feel the grant ask was a little high relative to their TVL, but given the uniqueness to their product we can understand how the protocol may not attract your everyday user. Given the strength and justification of their execution strategy, KPIs, and milestones we are supportive of this proposal to move to a DAO vote.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\nVote FOR GammaSwap's proposal.\n\nGood proposal that scored well across the rubric which sufficient justifications around the grant size, the approach to executing against the plan, and maintaining results after LTIPP. Novel and innovative protocol that provides some degree of differentiation in contrast to the market which supports some of the stickiness considerations. They've demonstrated modest traction and adoption on Arbitrum to \"test the waters\" without incentives, and while the grant size requested is on the higher end in contrast to their TVL (~1-2 thirds of it), believe this is a worthwhile investment from the DAO to scale up adoption based on initial results.",

We think their UI/UX focused product will bring in new users and like their incentive design that bases the ARB emissions on TVL growth. A small grant ask that we think is properly justified. \n\n*Wintermute Feedback*\nContrax’s application was well written and provided a good amount of justification and calculation of their grant size and execution strategy. Their adoption thus far has been underwhelming, however, their product looks decent.\n\nWe like their intended execution strategy that focuses on adoption and retention. Ultimately, the incentives also carry a second-order effect by increasing TVL across other Arbitrum protocols.\n\nWhile their grant size is greater than their current TVL, we believe that they have a good enough execution strategy and product that focuses on driving users to Arbitrum.\n\nWe support this application.\n\n*Karel Feedback*\nVote AGAINST Contrax's proposal.\n\nDecent proposal that scored well on rubric. Like the cross-protocol partnerships they have in-place with other Arbitrum protocols. However, minimal product differentiation (beyond web3auth/social sign-on), has shown minimal adoption/demand for the product in contrast to peers, and requested grant size exceeds their TVL. Risk that incentives and APR boost will not lead to organic, long-term/renteitve usage. Believe they should prove out further traction first and resubmit proposal at a later grants window.",

We like their emphasis on targeting CEX users and how they intend to achieve this.\nThe main things lacking from this proposal was lack of data, novelty, and contribution to Arbitrum’s competitive advantage. The latter stems from Arbitrum’s abundance of Perp DEXs, but LogX provides some interesting product features.\nWe support this application.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\n\nLogX’s application presents a well-rounded proposal, with a grant size that is both justified and reasonable. The protocol's high composability enhances its ability to unlock new value propositions for other applications. The team boasts a solid track record in attracting and retaining both power users and casual traders, achieving an average daily volume of close to 60M. Remarkably, 75% of their volumes originate from Arbitrum, despite their deployment on other chains such as Optimism, Mantle, Linea, and Blast. Their execution plan is clear, and the grant is expected to facilitate Arbitrum in acquiring more Centralized Exchange (CEX) traders, potentially igniting a new growth cycle beyond referral and affiliate programs. We support this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThis grant plan scored well in most areas of the rubric. We recommend this grant be approved.",

They’re a team that has built on Arbitrum for over a year now and have properly justified the grant ask despite moderate (thought improving) usage. A more complete milestone section along with detailed KPIs that were more justified would’ve strengthened the application. But overall this is a project and application that we support. \n\n*Wintermute Feedback*\nBond Protocol’s application scored well across a lot of criteria. They have a great track record, a good Arbitrum relationship, and bring innovative infrastructure. Their application was well-written and clear in their goals, KPIs, and milestones.\n\nThey have a solid reward distribution mechanism and really like the focus on working with protocols for their treasury management needs as this is rather sticky; we hope that the asset acquisitions are directly supporting LP efforts. However, we would’ve liked to see more justification behind the calculation of the grant size.\n\nThe grant size is rather large given the total activity of Bond on Arbitrum, but given the usage of incentives, we think it’s okay.\n\nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*Karel Feedback*\nVote FOR Bond Proposal's proposal.\n\nStrong proposal with an innovative solution tackling bonds and treasury management needs for teams. Bonds are a strong reward and incentive mechanism is a sticky solution for projects (as evidenced through Olympus Pro adoption). Still nascent on Arbitrum but meaningful growth has been observed. Would have liked to see more detail around selection of the six bond issuers (criteria) as well as the timeline and milestones (eg. when this will turn on and how they will go through pipeline to execute against incentives).

There are multiple ways to incentive user activity - completing in-game quests, referrals, daily logins, etc - which we believe will likely bring in new users. While the overall execution strategy is lacking important details for an ask of this size, the other aspects of the application have led us to support this grant. Additionally, we’re under the impression that Beacon does not need a security audit for their NFTs and have therefore not graded them on this aspect. \n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\nThe Beacon’s application scored decently across a range of criteria. They have seen strong success during their demo phase which clearly shows their ability to attract users to Arbitrum and stimulate network activity. The product/industry is appealing to a wide variety of users inside and outside of Arbitrum and if successful creates a competitive advantage for Arbitrum.\n\nThe main concerns we had with this proposal were its lack of ARB distribution details and justification for grant size. They had a general idea of how they intend to distribute rewards but there was no granular breakdown on how much ARB will be allocated to each sub-sections. There is also very little discussion about sybil protections and the protocol has no audit history.\n\nOverall, given the positive points mentioned above, we think the application should be progressed to a DAO vote, however, we urge the DAO to take into consideration the areas of concern highlighted.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nThe Beacon’s application demonstrates a well-rounded approach, showcasing success and achieving product-market fit in attracting users to Arbitrum. While we seek more details regarding ARB distribution and note the protocol's lack of completed security audits, we are confident in The Beacon's ability to execute effectively, given their strong track record. The protocol's compatibility with other games like Bridgeworld and Kuroro Beast is notable. Their strategy aims to elevate Arbitrum as a gaming chain, potentially leading to significant impact through a global launch. We endorse The Beacon's application.",

They had some solid justification and calculation of KPIs, milestones, and goals, however, their estimations don’t really justify their grant size given the protocol’s current usage.\n\nThey could’ve also improved on their incentive design allocating some rewards to running trading competitions (which actively drive user engagement).\n\nWhile we are aware the protocol is in a private beta, looking at their Dune dashboard there is 1 active daily users indicating very low signs of adoption. We would typically be against supporting an application of this size and grant request, however, their milestone ARB unlocks provide sufficient protection for the DAO.\n\nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\n\"Vote FOR Pear Protocol's proposal.\n\nWell-written proposal that scored moderately well on the rubric. Innovative product that is composable with other Arbitrum protocols (liquidity agnostic). Despite being in closed beta, they have seen decent usage. Protocol was supposed to launch into full public launch on March 29 but have not seen any updated information on progress here. Proposal could have benefited from bettter distribution mechanisms (ie. capped per user) and more detailed milestones to also drive user metrics on top of TVL. For this proposal going to the DAO.\"",

Their project builds on top of GMX adding additional utility to the protocol.\nTheir requested grant size seems reasonable given the current TVL, however, some of their TVL goals are a bit ambitious. Their execution strategy is clear with a detailed list of vaults and pools they will be focusing on.\nWe would’ve liked to have seen some more innovation on the incentive side with a focus on stickiness. Nonetheless, we think the application is sufficient enough to progress to a DAO vote.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThe applicant has shown recent signs of growth, and we would like to support increasing that. To that end, it would have been helpful if the applicant identified specific mechanisms that they attribute current or past successes to, and then tailored their grant plan specifically to replicating or scaling that success. Given the size of the grant request, we prefer to see some data to validate a specific execution plan.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\n\"Vote AGAINST Steadefi's proposal.\n\nDetailed proposal who has shown impressive growth since launching v2. Gitcoin Passport implementation is interest to protect against sybils. The grant size on its own is reasonable but do not feel it has been sufficiently justified to effectively 10x TVL by the end of the LTIPP (across both lending and strategy vaults). Much of the justification was drawn around the target and associated assumptions to fill in the blanks to form a path to get there vs. drawing from data to execute against.\"\t\t\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nThe proposal from Steadefi outlines a comprehensive plan to attract and retain liquidity within the Arbitrum ecosystem through incentivizing users and providing innovative leverage yield strategies. Their detailed roadmap, including specific milestones and KPIs, demonstrates a clear path to achieving their objectives. Additionally, the team's past performance, security measures, and engagement with the community instill confidence in their ability to execute on their plans. The requested grant size and justification are reasonable given their projected impact on TVL and user growth. Overall, Steadefi's proposal aligns well with the objectives of achieving  growth and making it a strong candidate for approval. \n\n*404 Feedback)*\nSteadefi presented a strong application that covered all components of the rubric. Their current usage is a little low for the grant ask and their execution strategy could have used more justification/reasoning behind how they have chosen their pools. However, their proactive approach to sybil attacks by using Gitcoin passport is a plus and we believe this likely leads to a lower grant claim than allocated. Their milestones are effectively designed to measure their success and we appreciate their feasibility component in justifying each KPI. We will be supporting this application.",

They have a great reputation and a long history of development and growth. They bring some interesting and novel product offerings to Arbitrum under one UI making it easy for users to access, their upcoming integrations with Arbitrum-native applications are also a plus.\nThey have a strong user base with a lot of TVL across other chains which is valuable for Arbitrum. Their KPIs, milestones, and goals are clear and sufficiently justified.\nWhile their growth has not been explosive, there has been a steady upward trend since their deployment on Arbitrum.

While their recent usage has been in a downtrend for the last year, there are clear benefits for supporting this infrastructure within the Arbitrum ecosystem including further second order effects across the Defi heavy landscape. Due to the nature of their incentive design and robust application we will be supporting this proposal\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThe applicant’s protocol has seen declining usage throughout its deployment life and the grant plan requests funds to liquidity mine the applicant’s own token. Perhaps that is necessary for how IPOR the protocol functions? But that is not made clear in the application. Regardless, the novelty of the protocol, its potential use cases, and the modest size of the grant request lead us to recommend this grant be approved.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\n\nThe IPOR Protocol introduces a pioneering solution to Arbitrum, offering interest rate swaps and expanding DeFi opportunities. With a demonstrated history of achieving milestones and a skilled team, the project is poised to improve liquidity, enhance market efficiency, and aiming for growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The grant application aligns with strategic goals by aiming to incentivize participation and bootstrap liquidity, ensuring competitiveness alongside other projects. Given the potential for new trading options and the team's track record, the proposed KPIs and milestones appear reasonable for the modest grant request. If successful, this initiative could attract and retain users in the Arbitrum ecosystem, contributing to its overall development and vitality. Therefore, we recommend accepting this application, as it offers tangible benefits for Arbitrum users and adds value to the network.",

      "content": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/threshold-foundation-ltipp-application-draft/21783\n\n## Council -  3/4 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*404 Feedback)*\nOverall Threshold presented an extremely thorough application with a sound execution plan and strong KPIs. Their adoption showed a good track record and believe they are a great addition to the Arbitrum ecosystem. We acknowledge there is a component of the grant that falls outside the scope of the program (10% towards developing the tBTC direct minting dapp), however, we felt the grant application was strong enough to allow this to pass on to the DAO and have them vote to allow this exception. \n\n*Karel Feedback)*\n\"Vote AGAINST Threshold's proposal.\n\nStrong proposal that scored well across rubric (execution, KPIs, milestones, grant justification, etc.). Only hold up is 10% being allocated as a developer grant and while not significant, this has disqualified other applications (for me) and do not want to make an exception here despite all other criteria passing with flying colors.\"\t\t\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nThe proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy to aggressively grow the TVL of decentralized Bitcoin on Arbitrum, addressing liquidity provisioning, user stickiness, and direct minting functionalities. By incentivizing liquidity provision across key pools and implementing a tiered loyalty program, the protocol aims to attract and retain liquidity providers, thus deepening the liquidity pool on Arbitrum. Additionally, the integration of a direct minting DApp for Bitcoin on Arbitrum streamlines the process for BTC holders to access DeFi opportunities, fostering growth and innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Overall, the proposal demonstrates a clear understanding of the ecosystem's needs and presents a well-thought-out plan to address them effectively, making it a strong candidate for acceptance.\n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\nThreshold’s application was very strong, they provided thorough details and justifications for their requested grant size, milestones, KPIs, and objectives. We really liked their execution strategy as it was well thought out and focused on incentivizing key areas such as liquidity, direct Arbitrum minting, and stickiness.\nTheir adoption on Arbitrum has been underwhelming, however, we believe it’s important for the DAO to support such infrastructure that has already been successful on Mainnet and improve BTC alternatives.\nLastly, we appreciate their commitment to co-incentives during and 12 months after the LTIPP begins. We will be supporting this application.",

      "content": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/index-coop-ltipp-application/21793\n\n## Council -  3/4 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\n\nIndex Coop’s application was very strong and scored well across the majority of the criteria. They provided thorough explanations of their KPIs and goals and set out clear milestones.\nTheir justification of grant size was sufficient and they had a well-thought-out execution strategy that clearly targets increased TVL activity and users on Arbitrum. \nTheir product is highly composable and they have a large existing user base. Their emphasis on specifically rewarding existing ETH users to Arbitrum is a great idea.\nWe support this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThis protocol identifies and tries to fill a specific need. The grant plan, however, could have been considerably stronger if it had 1) identified a past driver of growth, and 2) tailored the plan to replicate or extend that growth. In particular, rebates for fees deserve some data that shows it moves user activity. Recommend the applicant revise and resubmit in future grants cycles with this in mind,\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nI am generally positive about supporting Index Coop’s application. They have a novel product, which has an offchain reach demonstrated by their partnership with eToro, CoinDesk and 21.co. In anticipation of RobinHood integrating Arbitrum to their app product-offering, and in consideration of the immense reach of mobile apps, I think that should Index Coop be successful it would greatly benefit Arbitrum as an ecosystem as well. Given that they partnered with etoro in Oct23, they could be a good fit to marry onchain with tradfi. Bitcoin ETF has been established with ETH ETF next, and I believe Index Coop would be a good fit for arbitrium for tradfi integration.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\nVote FOR Index Coop's proposal.\n\nStrong proposal that scored well across the rubric. Despite being newly deployed to Arbitrum, their proposal well captures their execution plan, target milestones/KPIs, how they plan to incentivize migration to Arbitrum from Ethereum, and provides strong justification behind their requested grant. Outside of this, their adoption/partnership with TradFi products like eToro is promising to potentially attract off-chain users (would like to understand if there's a strategy here). On stickiness post-LTIPP, there is some light description on this and proposal would benefit from further detail on their new mechanisms re: trading competition, cross-selling with other products (and if there are any Arbitrum partnerships in mind).",

KelpDAO has seen extremely impressive growth for its age and presents a strong opportunity for Arbitrum to bring native restaking infrastructure to the ecosystem. We believe this is extremely important opportunity for Arbitrum to capture a competitive advantage over other L2s.\nTheir KPIs, milestones, and goals are very clear and well justified. Their distribution mechanism is sound, however, will likely not provide any new data to the DAO. Lastly, their grant size is completely reasonable given the size of the protocol.\nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\n\nThe applicant lays out a simple, but complete, plan to attract and then retain LSTs on Arbitrum. Kelp’s current success demonstrates an interest in the product, and that it meets a demand in the market. We recommend approving this grant to migrate some of that demand to Arbitrum.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\n\nKelpDAO's application is comprehensive and has scored favorably in most aspects, with a reasonable grant size. It shows promising potential to enhance Arbitrum's native restaking infrastructure within the ecosystem. Considering prevailing market narratives, we believe that the application could be advantageous for Arbitrum if KelpDAO successfully achieves its milestones and KPIs. Their goals are clear, well-thought-out, and justified. KelpDAO has demonstrated product-market fit and addresses a significant demand in the current market landscape.

That’s what allows for large grants requests. The main weakness of this grant plan was a lack of deliverables promised that can help hold the grantee accountable - there are not explicit targets to hit in terms of traffic or other metrics. All other areas were strong, however. We recommend this grant be approved.\n\n*404 DAO Feedback*\nAcross has seen impressive usage since its launch and we are excited to bring an incentive program that was successful to Arbitrum. Execution strategy was clearly presented and there was extensive data to backup their plan. As GFX mentioned too, the only weakness in their application was the absence of trackable milestones that targeted hitting their presented KPIs. \n\n*GMX Feedback*\nThe team background is solid, with a history of successfully building projects and a deep understanding of incentive mechanisms. They have demonstrated the ability to attract organic traffic and retain users even after the conclusion of incentive programs, indicating a strong grasp of sustainable growth strategies. Their well-thought-out plan for utilizing incentives further strengthens our confidence in their proposal. Additionally, in line with successful grants related to bridging, Across protocol aims to incentivize users to bridge to Arbitrum by covering 95% of the fees associated with the bridging process. This approach recognizes the importance of bridge partners as the entry point for users into the Arbitrum ecosystem. The proposed allocation of 1 million ARB aligns with past bridge incentives and is expected to significantly reduce friction for users, thereby facilitating broader adoption. Overall, considering the team's expertise and the strategic importance of incentivizing bridge usage, we are inclined to support this proposal.",

Long tenure and history on Arbitrum, grant size well justified, etc. Like many projects, TVL peaked in 2021/2022 and tapered into 2023, and has not seen much demand in recent times. However, believe second/third-order benefits driven by their composability and their grant execution plan to drive the noted KPIs (TVL and fee income) is sufficiently justified to pass this through to the DAO.\"",

While the protocol does not necessarily bring anything new to Arbitrum, it is one of the more reasonable grant requests for bridging protocols. Furthermore, we appreciate the marketing efforts with Galxe to increase awareness and funnel users to Arbitrum.\nNot sure if it was implied under cross-chain swaps, but it would’ve been good to see Symbiosis incentivize cross-chain swaps into DeFi protocols on Arbitrum.\nWe will be supporting this application.\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThis grant plan focuses directly on lowering the cost to bridge onto Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova by subsidizing the gas costs to bridge in. While a 100% rebate may offer some niche griefing attack by someone seeking to drain the grant funds, they probably would not have a profit motive to do so. The request is reasonable in size, the plan easy to measure, and directly targets increasing the number of assets and users on Arbitrum. We recommend this grant be approved.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nI’m generally supportive of the Symbiosis application on the basis of the sector they’re involved with. Bridge and crosschain development can only benefit a network. The grant was straightforward and it seems Symbiosis is cognizant of the space they’re operating within and their place in it. The proposal from Symbiosis presents a comprehensive strategy to drive liquidity and user engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem. By offering gas fee refunds for cross-chain swaps, Symbiosis aims to incentivize users and attract significant trading volume to both Arbitrum One and Nova. The clear objectives, well-defined milestones, and commitment to transparent reporting demonstrate a thoughtful approach to achieving measurable outcomes. Furthermore, the integration of incentives with Galxe for wider outreach enhances the potential impact of the initiative. Overall, this proposal aligns with the goals of aiming growth and innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem, making it a worthy candidate for support.",

      "content": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/mountain-protocol-ltipp-application-draft/22064\n\n## Council -  3/5 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\nMountain Protocol’s grant request was rather large given the adoption of USDM. While the protocol has strong TVL on Ethereum mainnet, there is very little traction on other chain deployments. This is further confirmed by daily transfers, daily volume, and total USDM holders. Thus, given the lack of holders on Ethereum and other chains, we also expect incentives to land in a concentrated number of wallets.\n\nGoals, milestones, and KPIs were rather clear for the most part, however, there was little detail about the execution strategy and goals for ‘DeFi Partner Integrations’. The large focus on pure liquidity mining efforts without additional mechanisms does not provide a compelling case for such the size of the grant request.\n\nUnfortunately, we will not be supporting this proposal.\n\n*404 Feedback)*\nWhile we gave this application an average score, we still support it on the basis that we believe incentivizing liquidity for a yield-bearing asset pair is important. Deep liquidity in yield-bearing stablecoin / LST pairs will be a strong competitive advantage for Arbitrum. However, this application was lacking in a few areas such as incentive distribution, as traditional liquidity incentives will likely result in incentives landing in the hands of whales, and the execution strategy regarding DeFi Partner Integrations lacked clear details. But overall, Mountain Protocol has a good team and decent traction on mainnet which make for nice additions to our main reasonings for support. \n\n*Karel Feedback)*\n\"Vote AGAINST Mountain Protocol's proposal.\n\nWell-written proposal that ranked decently on the rubric and impressive adoption to-date from a market share perspective re: yield-bearing stablecoin backed by T-bills. While Mountain has seen strong adoption on Ethereum Mainnet, this is very limited in other ecosystems including Arbitrum. The current traction and execution plan to bring TVL into the Arbitrum ecosystem is lacking and may lead to concentrated number of wallets. The execution strategy to build stickiness is limited and centered around institutional players. Need more information and pserspective on composability / integration with other DeFi partners on Arbitrum to paint a better picture to pass this through to the DAO.\"\t\t\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nWe generally thought this grant plan was well constructed, but was expensive relative to the existing Arbitrum footprint of USDM. Other areas of the rubric were able to overcome this penalty in score, however. We recommend approving this grant.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nThe proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy to introduce and bootstrap USDM, a leading yield-bearing stablecoin, into the Arbitrum ecosystem. By incentivizing liquidity provision and fostering partnerships with DeFi protocols, the initiative aims to drive significant TVL growth on Arbitrum, ultimately strengthening both USDM and Arbitrum within the DeFi landscape. The requested grant size is justified based on projected TVL acquisition costs, offering a cost-effective approach compared to previous rounds. The execution plan is well-defined, with clear objectives, milestones, and KPIs to track success. The inclusion of specific KPIs related to USDM TVL, usage in DeFi protocols, and volume transacted with USDM provides a robust framework for measuring the effectiveness of the grant. Additionally, the proposal demonstrates a commitment to sustainability, aiming to establish use cases that are self-sustaining once bootstrapped. Overall, accepting this proposal would ramp-up the growth and innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem, solidifying its position as a leader in DeFi.",

We appreciate the team’s commitment to Arbitrum and their continued Arbitrum native roadmap. Additionally, the product has started to catch some traction with their recent incentives mechanism. While their grant ask is a little high for their current usage, we believe the incentives can compliment their recent traction and support further protocol growth benefits. However, their incentive design(bribe mechanism based on veFCTR) does lead to the potential of weak distribution, mainly whales and OGs receiving the majority of rewards. Overall, we feel the benefits outweigh the costs and we support this application. \n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nWe are generally supportive of Factor’s grant application. They have been present in the space for a while with a provable track record and the grant ask seems responsible, along with their proposed plan of action for the grants. Considering Factor is currently in the rollout stage of the product they have spent a long time building, I expect the grant to strengthen this process and be quite cost-effective and based on Factor's incentive strategy outlined in their proposal, We would be inclined to accept the proposal. The strategy demonstrates a clear understanding of how to incentivize user adoption and liquidity depth within the Factor ecosystem on Arbitrum. By leveraging dynamic reward allocation, targeted boost incentives, and enhanced rewards for veFCTR holders, Factor aims to create stickiness among users and ensure sustained engagement over time. The proposed KPIs are well-defined and directly align with the grant objectives, providing clear metrics for evaluating success. Additionally, the milestones set forth are ambitious yet realistic, with a clear roadmap for achieving them over the 12-week grant period. Overall, Factor's incentive strategy appears robust and well-thought-out, making it a compelling proposal for acceptance.\n*GFX Feedback) *\nOur main concern with this grant plan is requesting an amount that is nearly as much as the entire protocol’s TVL. The applicant scored highly in other areas, like composability, and solidly in most areas, which managed to offset the penalty to their score from the grant size. We recommend this grant be approved.",

This grant plan (smartly) identifies high friction to get a new user onto their own proprietary chain, and want to acquire users on Arbitrum where those users can interact with SX’s markets that are active on both chains. The danger to Arbitrum, however, is that this can act as a marketing funnel to find users on Arbitrum, give them a taste of SX’s product at reduced cost, and then possibly migrate those users to SX’s own dapp chain. \nThe grantee does, in fact, attempt to address this with statements that they intend to migrate their own users to Arbitrum, though this is not a clear part of the grant plan. Because of that, we are able to score this grant plan highly. We recommend this grant plan be approved.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\nVote FOR SX Bet's proposal.\n\nWell detailed proposal that scored highly on the rubric. Initially was concerned that the proposal and incentives would serve as a way to draw users away from Arbitrum, knowing that Polygon Edge has been deprecated serves as an opportunity to see SX Bet migrate to Arbitrum.

The grant plan generally scored well all around. We recommend this grant be approved.\n\n*Karel Feedback*\nVote FOR APX Finance's proposal.\n\nStrong proposal that scored well on rubric. Protocol has great traction on BSC and as evidenced in their various dashboards, and is an opportunity to draw a net new market to Arbitrum. Would have liked to see the following: (i) more granularity in milestones to highlight other key KPIs applied weekly/biweekly instead of monthly; and (ii) more detail behind stickiness strategies as they lightly touched on (centered around community and product delight) with a focus on rewarding ARB holders vs. driving stickiness of users/usage/liquidity + touching on strategy after incentives end\n\n*404 DAO Feedback*\nAPX scored well across a variety of categories and presented a thorough application. Links for team members would have been appreciated to verify the content they have presented. We felt their trading competition left a lot of details out relating to sybil attacks & wash trading. We appreciate the attempt to make the trading competition social in creating teams, but focusing around a volume based challenge rewards larger users to come together to maximize their allocation. Unfortunately we will not be supporting this proposal\n\n*GMX Feedback*\nThe proposal outlines a detailed plan for increasing TVL and trading volume on Arbitrum, accompanied by clear objectives and execution strategies. However, the milestones set are too low. Currently, the proposal suggests spending on incentives to create a $5 million pool on Arbitrum, but most trading is expected to occur on BSC rather than Arbitrum. While the team trading contest is a novel and promising idea, unfortunately, we cannot support the proposal.\n\n*Wintermute Feedback*\nAPX Finance’s application was thorough in their justification and details. They have proven their ability to natively run their own incentive programs which has worked out well. The unification of cross-chain liquidity will be a win for Arbitrum and their execution strategy seems sufficient. Their product has seen great traction outside of Arbitrum and we are hoping that this grant will be able to migrate existing users.\nWe would’ve liked to have seen a PnL Trading tournament alongside their trading volume tournament to encourage more organic trading activity. We also don’t really see the need for the ARB holder incentives, but it will be interesting data nonetheless.\nOverall, we believe this application is solid enough to present it to the DAO.",

The demonstrated growth, composability, and relatively straightforward execution plan and milestones allow this application to overcome our hesitations, though. We recommend this grant be approved.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nVaultka has a proven track record of delivering impactful grants, as demonstrated by their successful utilization of the GMX grant. The proposal stands out for its detailed timeline and milestone breakdown, which fosters accountability and facilitates progress monitoring throughout the program's implementation. Innovative incentive mechanisms, such as enhanced Vaultka NFT rewards, are introduced, showcasing Vaultka's commitment to fostering user engagement and retention. Moreover, the proposal's focus on creating a flywheel effect bodes well for both users and projects on Vaultka's platform, aligning with our sustainability goals. Additionally, Vaultka's early adoption of protocols and their significant TVL growth with various vaults highlight their pioneering role in the DeFi ecosystem. While the requested 1 million Arb Grant may seem substantial, supporting Arbitrum Native protocols like Vaultka, especially those introducing unique strategies, is crucial for the ecosystem's growth. The proposal's aim to attract significant TVL to their platform promises to benefit the broader ecosystem and attract new users. We would be inclined to support the proposal. \n\n*404 Feedback)*\nOverall, this was a great application that scored well in many sections. Vaultka presented a clear execution strategy to increase its lending capacity and TVL. They have also shown strong usage since going through GMX’s grant program, with the TVL staying relatively sticky. We are supporting this application.",

While we do not love the execution strategy around subsidizing a 3rd party for enabling the product, we understand the purpose. The milestone orientation could have been stronger and the grant ask is a little high but overall we believe this is something worthwhile for the DAO to fund and will be supporting this grant application.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nWe are generally supportive of Myso Finance’s grant application. They have a proven track record of pre-existing integrations, and their requested grant size is reasonable with clear application towards specific ends. The clear allocation of rewards to borrowers, lenders, and arrangers, along with the focus on fostering long-term engagement and growth, demonstrates a thoughtful approach towards achieving the grant objectives. By incentivizing various stakeholders and implementing mechanisms to encourage \"stickiness\" within the ecosystem, the proposal aims to create a self-sustaining environment conducive to innovation and expansion within the Arbitrum ecosystem. \n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThe applicant presents a clear plan, justification for the request size, and - while the grant is large compared to protocol size - demonstrates steady growth since Q4 of 2023 that can be increased with grant support.

Limited traction but interesting early signs however given the requested grant ask, it's a worthwhile experiment for the DAO to support and provide with the potential for them to achieve their target metrics. Look forward to seeing the V2 audit + bug bounty program in place.\n\nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback*\nCopra offers a use case not readily available on other chains, and has requested a relatively small amount that is appropriate for new experiments and protocols.

Gearbox has a unique and novel product that complements DeFi well and is very composable. They have proven their ability to achieve PMF and work with incentives\nThey provided clear objectives, KPIs, and goals, and a sufficient justification for their requested grant size.\nTheir execution strategy has a nice focus on migrating their existing users to Arbitrum while focusing on hot sectors in DeFi. We would’ve liked have seen a bit more details in their execution strategy regarding rewarding trading volume and anti-sybil measures.\nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nWe’re hesitant at this level of grant funding, but the applicant has demonstrated exceptional adoption on mainnet in recent months. The strong performance and track record of the applicant generally overcomes the large size of the request to what is effectively to deploy to Arbitrum.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nGearbox’s proposal introduces a unique feature called Credit Accounts, an account abstraction primitive that has the potential to attract significant capital to Arbitrum. The objectives outlined in the proposal are clear, well-defined, and aligned with driving growth and innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Their execution strategy, incorporating mechanisms such as farming and incentivizing margin trading, demonstrates a thoughtful approach to achieving the program's goals. The allocation of resources and incentives across different pools and strategies reflects a strategic focus on driving user engagement and liquidity provision.\n\n\nThe proposed timeline and milestones are realistic, offering a clear pathway for assessing progress throughout the grant period. Emphasizing target utilization ratios and total transaction volume underscores a commitment to driving user adoption and engagement, vital for the success of any protocol. Furthermore, their strategy to incentivize stickiness through continued integration with other protocols highlights a long-term commitment to enhancing composability within the ecosystem, benefiting not only Gearbox but also other projects and the overall Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n\nAdditionally, Gearbox has a proven track record of innovation, attracting users with both simplistic interfaces and high yields, such as their leveraged ETH EigenPoint system. The grant size appears modest considering the value Gearbox brings to the ecosystem, enabling users to explore new DeFi strategies with ease. With a history of successfully gathering TVL using their own incentives, coupled with the Arb Grant, Gearbox is expected to attract even more TVL. Overall, the proposal presents a well-thought-out plan with achievable objectives, clear KPIs, and a strategic approach to creating more growth and innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Therefore, we fully support the proposal.",

It offers a fun incentive mechanism with the prize box. Unfortunately, in a (correct) attempt to mitigate sybil farming of that prize box, it would be restricted to existing accounts. That dramatically narrows the focus of the grant, since it’s no longer able to use its most interesting mechanism to acquire new users for Arbitrum, and instead must make it up with increasing the amount of activity of existing users. In the end, the score was not high enough to recommend approval, but we strongly encourage the applicant to reapply to future grants cycles, particularly if they can find a way to retain sybil resilience and also target new users.\n\n*404 DAO Feedback*\nBebop presented a very thorough well written application. They scored well across most of the rubric; however, their milestone section could’ve been improved greatly to include trackability and focus on increasing activity. Due to the nature of the execution strategy, pairing usage incentives with increased solvers for best execution, as well as their strong justification, fair grant ask, and current traction we will be supporting application. \n\n*GMX Feedback*\nBebop, a DEX aggregator, has a considerable user base on various Layer 2 solutions, positioning them well to attract users from other L2 platforms to Arbitrum with the proposed incentives. Their unique incentive mechanisms, including gasless transactions and mystery box campaigns, add an unique aspect to their proposal. Moreover, Bebop offers easy integration for other projects through their APIs, enhancing composability within the ecosystem. The introduction of their aggregation system, JAM, aims to optimize trades for users, further contributing to their appeal. While the grant size is deemed somewhat high, there's confidence in Bebop's ability to deepen their presence within the Arbitrum ecosystem using the 400k incentives. Although it would have been preferable for them to demonstrate success on Arbitrum with a smaller grant initially, the overall consensus is to approve the proposal, acknowledging its potential to drive volume and engagement within the ecosystem.\n\n*Karel Feedback*\nVote FOR BeBop's proposal.\n\nStrong proposal that scored well across the rubric. Has demonstrated meaningful adoption across L2s with traction on Arbitrum ready to be scaled. Highly composable with other Arbitrum DeFi protocols. Meaningful target milestones/KPIs to grow volume and that are well justified relative to recent traction on Arbitrum without incentives to highlight ability to scale up from here. While not disqualifying aspects, would have liked to see the following adjusted: (i) slight reduction in grant size (300k); (ii) more detail around the Mystery Box mechanic on proposed allocation of the ARB and mechanics; and (iii) a rebalancing from the ARB Mystery Box allocation to another incentivization mechanic that can encourage new user growth (given the 1-month requirement for account age discourages new users from being able to access 70% of the incentives).",

They have an excellent reputation and strong usage statistics.\nThey provided clear milestones, KPIs, and goals, and provided sufficient justification for their grant size.\nOur main concern is with the overall distribution mechanism and cost to the DAO. We would’ve liked to see a justification of TVL target based on user cohort trade size which would inform how much TVL is required to reduce slippage and attract larger bridging volume. Or even begin bootstrapping in-demand assets to Arbitrum.\nFurthermore, we don’t think spending money on bridge rebates is the best use of DAO funds as it doesn’t actively target increasing user base and activity but mostly reduces the burden for users who were already looking to bridge.\nUnfortunately, due to the reasons above we will not be supporting this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThe primary weakness of this grant plan is the sheer size. Given clear execution plan, walking through how the applicant arrived at the requested amount, and milestones, the application overcomes the penalty for the large request. We recommend approving this grant.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\n\nWe are generally supportive of approving Hop’s grant. Hop Protocol is a substantial player in the bridge sector and has huge potential to help Arbitrum grow generally. Bridges are also sites of high crosschain traffic, so this provides an opportunity to put Artbiutrm in front of new users. The detailed breakdown of how the grant will be utilized, including specific percentages allocated to different aspects such as liquidity mining incentives, gas fee subsidies, and bonder fee subsidies, demonstrates a clear understanding of the challenges and opportunities within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The plan to incentivize user \"stickiness\" by subsidizing onboarding fees while ensuring a stake in the network through ARB token rebates is particularly innovative and likely to achieve long-term engagement. They, are also open to match the grants funds with the HOP protocol DAO treasury funds which is a good sign. \n\n*404 DAO Feedback)*\nHop presented a strong application that scored well on most sections in this rubric. In addition to being a long time supporter of Arbitrum, they provided detailed justifications for their KPIs, milestones, and overall execution strategy. We appreciated the sub-focus on Arbitrum Nova within their execution strategy and believe Hop plays an important role in driving further adoption and discovery for this chain. Overall, due to the robust nature of Hop’s application, their past success and impact to driving users to transact on Arbitrum native chains we will be supporting this grant proposal.",

Given its a peer to peer lending protocol we thought their might be some sybil concerns where individuals could just net the ARB yield, but given the over-collateralization requirements feel that this is mitigated.

Good execution strategy. Little product usage given date of deployment but believe it's a low risk grant that is dependent on the achievement of goals. For moving to DAO to decide. \"\t\t\n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\n\nLumin’s application was solid despite the low overall score. They did well in calculating and justifying their grant request and provided clear objectives, KPIs, and milestones. We liked that they split their grant request into two stages, requiring their protocol to hit certain milestones before having their second tranche of ARB unlocked. Their protocol also offers some unique product offerings and is pretty composable.\nHowever, they did score poorly due to their lack of product usage and age of deployment on Arbitrum. As a result, this pulled down the expected benefit from their requested grant size.\nWe think this application is worthy of progressing to a DAO vote as they have a clear vision of intended grant use with key milestones and they will only receive the full funds of the grant if they are successful in reaching their KPIs.",

That have clear execution plan with decently ambitious goals of 10x volume and 5x users & TVL. Their milestones and KPIs are clear and effective - overall a solid application that justified an appropriate ask of 50k ARB. While we feel like to large of a percentage is allocated to the ARB Leaderboard Competition and it was hard to verify some of their usage data, we will be supporting this application. \n\n*Karel Feedback)*\n\"Vote FOR Okto's proposal.\n\nInteresting proposal and mobile-first product focused on India, a prime crypto region of the world who is very mobile-friendly. As a multichain wallet, they have many chain partnerships ranging from 10 EVM chains (Polygon zkEVM), Aptos, and soon Solana and Cosmos. Initially, was a bit concerned but their Okto Futures product will be native to Arbitrum which has seen decent traction since launching. See an opportunity to drive users, volume, and TVL to Arbitrum through their product. Revised grant size is reasonable. \"\t\t\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nThe app is currently in the beta phase but has already shown impressive numbers. Given the grant's size, it's a clear choice based on the demonstrated metrics, and their commitment to matching the grant with generated fees adds further incentive. Notably, there's currently a lack of mobile-native futures aggregators within the Arbitrum ecosystem or on any other blockchain, particularly those integrated directly with supported wallets as proposed. The benefits of funding this innovative product outweigh the grant's cost and will likely drive increased adoption of Arbitrum among mobile users. The KPIs and milestones align well with the request size, indicating a reasonable and achievable roadmap for the project. Overall, this proposal presents a compelling opportunity to support the development of a unique and much-needed tool in the ecosystem.",

The cost per additional oracle is considerably higher than other oracle provider grant applications. Pyth, however, has a demonstrated ability to gain adoption on Arbitrum, and also provide more exotic or esoteric oracle feeds by virtue of the sheer number of feeds. On balance, the benefits of having a competitive oracle ecosystem on Arbitrum and Pyth’s track record with working within the ecosystem outweighs the scoring penalties from the large size of the request.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nPyth's application is undoubtedly beneficial for the ecosystem, although the grant size is considerable. While we support this application, we suggest exploring the possibility of reducing the requested amount. Having a diverse range of proven oracles within the Arbitrum ecosystem is immensely advantageous, particularly in light of numerous complaints about the high costs associated with other oracle services. Pyth boasts a proven track record and is poised to provide immediate benefits to the ecosystem upon integration. Despite the sizeable grant, the allocated ARB will be utilized for gas fee rebates, directly benefiting the ecosystem.\n\n\n*404 Feedback)*\nVery large grant size, but echo the sentiments of the other reviewers - Pyth has shown strong traction on Arbitrum and it is beneficial to have competing oracle ecosystems.",

Their product has also seen past success with incentives through GMX’s grant program. While their milestone section and KPIs could’ve been more detailed, we feel that their distribution mechanism and the novelty of their product are strong enough reasons to support this application.\n\n*Wintermute Feedback*\ndappOS’s application was good and scored well across various criteria. They seem to have a pretty large user base (hard to verify such data) that is active across multiple chains and protocols, therefore, acting as a nice funnel to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nTheir goals, KPIs, and milestones are all clear in their purpose and their justification of grant size is sufficient and reasonable given their goals and level of activity.\nOur main concerns are that they are already receiving funding from STIP via GMX’s grant program which could be seen as double dipping and it makes it hard to fully understand how organic the current metrics are.\nFurthermore, their incentive mechanism does not provide any new data and mimics what has previously been done for GMX.\nOverall, despite these concerns, their ability to generate strong activity seems sufficient enough to receive their requested grant size.\nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*Karel Feedback*\nVote FOR dappOS' proposal.\n\nGood proposal and scored moderately well on rubric. KPIs/milestones are realistic with existing figures and grant size is well justified. Lacking in data availability (or accessiblility of it) across chains (would be good to have source of truth across all chains/protocols). Would have been good to have more information on \"new campaigns on popular dApp partners\" re: stickiness.",

The main areas they lost points in are the grant request size in conjunction with the product’s usage and age.\n\nTheir distribution strategy seems fine although there may be potential for users to abuse self-referral rebates. Nonetheless, the distribution strategy is heavily focused on the end user and promoting trading activity on Arbitrum which is great.\n\nWhile we don’t think the grant size is justified, we plan to support Perpie as the Telegram bot industry has seen high demand.

They had clear milestones, KPIs, goals, and objectives, and based their ARB distribution according to key milestones which is great. Their incentive mechanism is very basic and more could of been done there to incentivise stickiness. Their project is very composable and they have decent integrations thus far.\nThey sufficiently justified their requested grant size, however, we would’ve like to see more thought behind trying to migrate their Avalanche users to Arbitrum by using ARB incentives. Lastly, we are slightly concerned about product demand on Arbitrum given their age.\nNonetheless, this was a solid application and we will be supporting it.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nWhile we feel the request is relatively high vs the Arbitrum traction to date, the persistent presence on Avalanche does suggest the team can maintain much of the TVL and activity if they can get some momentum. We also appreciate that the request is scaled to a targeted, capped incentive and represents a maximum spend. We recommend this grant be approved.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\nVote FOR Yield Yak's proposal.\n\nStrong, comprehensive proposal across major criteria (milestones, KPIs, etc.) with solid metrics driven largely by Avalanche (Arbitrum metrics are meh). Requested grant size is higher than ideal but sufficiently rationalized by the team in light of potential opportunity to migrate Avalanche users to Arbitrum and would have liked to see a more fulsome strategy drawn out to bring users over to Arbitrum as part of the incentivization strategy.",

The rest of their application was also very thorough in regards to milestones, KPIs, and available data. Their team has proven its ability to execute and they have gained significant traction on Arbitrum since STIP. Overall, we believe they have properly justified the grant request and we’ll be supporting this application. \n\n*GFX Feedback* \nBeefy offers a strong track record, a long history with Arbitrum, scored highly in security, and presents a straightforward plan of execution. We recommend this grant be approved.\n\n*GMX Feedback*\nYes, we will be supporting the proposal. Beefy has a solid reputation and a proven track record of building successful protocols not only on Arbitrum but also across other EVM ecosystems. The team's experience is commendable, instilling confidence in their ability to deliver on their proposed milestones. However, there is a concern regarding the timeline for disbursing the incentives, as the proposed timeframe seems to exceed the duration of the program. This discrepancy should be addressed to ensure proper fund allocation and utilization. The Beefy ALM product is innovative, leveraging concentrated liquidity from various DEXes on the Arbitrum ecosystem to incentivize users, which is a unique approach to distributing incentives. Nevertheless, there are some weaknesses to consider, such as the potential lack of stickiness of liquidity gained via LTIP Rewards and the competition in the concentrated liquidity space. Additionally, the selection criteria for incentivized pools and the sizable grant amount for an unproven product raise some concerns. While the project shows promise, it may face challenges in attracting significant TVL without sufficient incentives. Overall, while the proposal has strengths, it also presents valid concerns that warrant careful consideration before allocating funds.",

      "content": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/lido-ltipp-application-draft/21716\n\n## Council -  3/3 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*404 Feedback)*\nOverall, Lido presented a really thorough and great proposal. They provided a very detailed execution plan, grant justification, quantifiable milestones that are easily trackable. Co-contribution of incentives also helps ensure liquidity stickiness in addition to the further integrations of wstETH across Arbitrum’s DeFi ecosystem. Creating deep LST liquidity will considerably strengthen Arbitrum’s competitive position.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nThe proposal from Lido DAO's Liquidity Observation Labs (LOL) demonstrates a clear and comprehensive strategy to drive the adoption and usage of wstETH on Arbitrum. Their past success in growing wstETH on other Layer-2 networks, combined with a detailed plan for incentivization, integration, and measurement of success, instill confidence in their ability to achieve their objectives. The team's experience in managing previous grants and their focus on long-term sustainability and growth are evident. With a well-thought-out execution plan, including incentivizing liquidity pools, governance token pairs, and leveraged staking protocols, this proposal seems poised to significantly increase wstETH activity on Arbitrum, contributing to the broader expansion of the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem. We really like their strategy of matching the grant incentives post the LTIPP grants are over to maintain the liquidity on the protocol. Additionally, Lido is one of the most influential applications in the DeFi ecosystem. Their Wrapped Staked ETH (wstETH) has received traction on the platform without incentives. wstETH with enough liquidity could be a foundational staked asset on the chain, the additional liquidity allowing more projects to integrate the token and give users less reason to return back to the mainnet for wstETH buying/bridging. The LOL is also willing to match the grant request, further making this a good return on investment for the DAO. The KPIs and Milestones look fine to me. Overall, this proposal shows promise and deserves support.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\n\n\"Vote FOR Lido's proposal.\n\nWell thought out proposal and strongly ranked in the rubric. They've been a leader in the space and, with the success of folks like Blast and LRTs building on EigenLayer, it's in Arbitrum's best interests to maintain deep liquidity for LSTs. Lido has been well Arbitrum aligned, incentivizing liquidity here since its initial wstETH deployment. Also great to see co-contribution of incentives as well as partnerships with other DeFi protocols on Arbitrum will contribute towards stickier liquidity. There is the natural concern of overall market share (30%+) to weigh but feel it's a competitive proposal to let the DAO decide.\"",

The proposal aims to kickstart the adoption of GHO as a native stablecoin asset on Arbitrum while also focusing on growing and retaining users on the Aave V3 Arbitrum deployment\n\n*404 DAO Feedback*\nOverall, Aave presented a strong proposal that was thoroughly written. They provided extensive data on their relevant usage metrics along with a very detailed execution plan the incentives which we believe fully justifies the size of this grant. Enabling the growth of native Arbitrum GHO will help strengthen Arbitrum’s competitive position. \n\nProviding more trackable success metrics within their milestones as well as sybil defense mechanisms were areas we felt the application could be improved. And while co-contribution of incentives was mentioned, since a commitment is reliant on an Aave DAO vote we did not award a bonus point.\n\n*Karel Feedback*\nVote FOR Aave's proposal.\n\nStrong proposal; lots of data, detailed execution plan, thoughtful KPIs, and reasonable grant size given their traction and activity. Launch of the Native Arbitrum GHO feeds into ecosystem benefits from this grant, though some elements are dependent on passing through Aave DAO governance.

Their Arbitrum traction is lacking for their age, however, they have decent TVL across other chains.\nTheir application also mentioned that they would be using a portion of rewards to incentivize the yield of their native token without little justification. Their native token already benefits from protocol revenue that will be generated from other ARB rewards/activity on the platform. The iFARM vault at the time of marking has not been deployed on Arbitrum, however, the team has mentioned that they are in the process of deploying it.\nWe would’ve also liked to have seen more of an emphasis on incentivizing current users from other chains to Arbitrum.\nGiven the composability of the project and the fact that rewards will ultimately benefit other protocols, we will supporting this application so that the DAO can make the final decision.\n\n*404 DAO Feedback)*\nHarvest Finance presented a solid proposal overall and we appreciated their collaborations with multiple other protocols which could lead to the grant having strong secondary effects. Unfortunately, due to the lack of justification around their ask, milestones composition and current usage relative to the high grant ask, we are unable to support this proposal.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\n\n\"Vote FOR Harvest Finance's proposal.\n\nStrong proposal that scored well across the rubric. Happy to move this to the DAO but would have liked to see: (i) More thorough justification and calculation for requested grant size; (ii) Greater emphasis on building traction in Arbitrum; and (iii) Clearer explanation for incentivizing yield of native token, especially considering existing protocol revenue.\"\t\t\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nThe proposal has comprehensive strategy outlined by Harvest Finance, their track record of successful deployments across multiple networks, and their collaborative efforts within the Arbitrum ecosystem, we recommend accepting their proposal. Harvest's commitment to diversifying strategies, incentivizing partner vaults, and driving user adoption aligns well with the goals of achieving growth in the Arbitrum ecosystem. Their proposed allocation of incentives, targeted towards high-value vaults and LP pools, demonstrates a strategic approach to maximize TVL and yield for users. Additionally, the provision for users to stake ARB tokens into Harvest vaults further promotes stickiness and long-term engagement within the ecosystem. Overall, Harvest's proposal presents a compelling case for supporting their initiatives on Arbitrum. \n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThis grant suffered in two main areas. The milestones do not suitably hold the grantee accountable for increasing users or assets on Arbitrum, instead focusing on distribution of the grant itself. Secondly, it’s difficult to believe that Arbitrum governance funds need to subsidize vaults that are already yielding 30% or more. If that doesn’t attract users, then it doesn’t seem like a good use of governance resources.",

      "content": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/knights-of-the-ether-ltipp-application-draft/21905\n\n## Council -  2/4 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nWe appreciate the well-considered reasoning for this grant plan. The main objection is the size – around half a million dollars in ARB. We would prefer to see data on cost of acquiring new users or past campaigns that significantly increased the interaction of existing users with the chain. We recommend this applicant revise and resubmit in a future grants cycle with a smaller request that can be comfortably allocated to more experimental grant plans.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nOnchain gaming has huge potential but has yet to find a field-validated PMF which demonstrates that blockchain can mesh neatly with the business cycle of the gaming industry. Perhaps I’m being too skeptical about the prospects of onchain gaming, but it would be to Arbitrum’s benefit if they succeed. We would be supporting this proposal for several reasons. Firstly, the team behind Knights of the Ether has a strong track record of experience in game development, with notable achievements in both web2 and web3 gaming spaces. Their past successes in engaging and retaining users demonstrate their capability to execute and deliver results.\nSecondly, the proposed incentives program is well-structured and strategically designed to drive user acquisition, retention, and engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem. By leveraging Battle Passes, Loot Boxes, Leaderboard Events, and targeted community onboarding, Knights of the Ether aims to attract a significant number of new users to Arbitrum while incentivizing existing users to stay engaged.\nFurthermore, the clear roadmap and milestones outlined in the proposal provide a tangible framework for measuring the success of the grant. By focusing on key performance indicators such as MAU, WAU, DAU, marketplace volume, and on-chain transactions, the team aims to demonstrate tangible growth and impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n*404 Feedback)*\n\nKnights of the Ether scored decent across the rubric. While their request is fairly large, we like the Battle Pass incentive design enabling both a free and paid component to hopefully increase retention. They have also shown an ability to bring in new users to the Arbitrum ecosystem. While we would’ve appreciated more specific details for how ARB would’ve been distributed through the Loot Boxes & Battle Pass, we will be supporting this grant due to the long-standing commitment to Arbitrum, strength in being an onboarding agent for Arbitrum gaming, and the second order effects that come from incentivizing their gameplay rollout. \n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\nThis application presented solid milestones, KPIs, goals, and a decent execution plan. However, we found the application missed the key calculations and justifications of their requested grant size. We would’ve liked to have seen customer acquisition calculations and a breakdown of why certain buckets were being allocated X amount of ARB and why. Furthermore, there was very little data provided, of which most was given an in excel sheet which was hard to verify onchain. Their adoption seems to be moderate given the age of the game, but using their MAGIC marketplace volume as a proxy of activity their requested grant size is ~2x larger. Unfortunately, we cannot justify the request grant size but would encourage them to resubmit under a smaller grant size.\n\n*Karel Feedback) - Conflict of interest*",

Origin Protocol pvoided a complete application that scored well on most metrics; one thing we would’ve liked to see was better incorporation of their presented KPIs in the milestones. Overall the grant size was properly justified and we support this application. \n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nThe team has demonstrated a clear understanding of how to bootstrap liquidity and achieve growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem through targeted incentivization measures. By leveraging both ARB and their native token OGV, they aim to drive liquidity to their pools on Balancer and incentivize integrations with lending platforms like Silo, thereby facilitating the expansion of LST usage on Arbitrum. The proposed milestones are specific and achievable, with a clear timeline for execution over the 12-week grant period and We are generally supportive of Origin Protocl’s grant application. They have a proven track record in the LST sector, and out of the many LST applicants, boast one of the higher TVLs for their staked ETH offering. Helping proven players in competitive spaces should generally benefit Arbitrum. \n\n*Karel Feedback)*\n\"Vote FOR Origin Protocol's proposal.\n\nGood proposal and impressive growth on mainnet. Driving further LST adoption on Arbitrum is necessary and will help solidify Arbitrum's competitive position in the market.

The grant ask is minimal and properly justified. Matching of bribes is a nice component and overall team has a proven track record. \n\n*GMX Feedback*\nThe proposal from Bunni demonstrates a well-planned strategy, evidenced by their successful past incentive campaigns and ability to consistently achieve their targets. Their collaborative efforts, such as the partnership with Connext to improve bridge UX transaction time, reflect a commitment to product enhancement. Despite the small grant size, they intend to allocate a portion of the incentives to partner protocols, showcasing a collaborative approach to ecosystem growth. Bunni's protocol, which builds on UNI V3 to offer innovative tokenomics, has shown modest adoption on other chains. With Uni V4 on the horizon, having a protocol experienced in building on V3 and contributing liquidity to the ecosystem is valuable. The proposed KPIs and milestones are reasonable, further supporting the case for funding this proposal. Overall, the combination of strategic planning, collaborative ethos, and experience building on UNI V3 makes this proposal worthy of support. \n\n*Karel Feedback*\nVote FOR Bunni's proposal.\n\nDecent proposal. Low metrics on Arbitrum but grant ask is minimal and a worthwhile experiment to test the waters. Bribe matching strategy and co-alignment with protocols to support cost/commitment is a fine strategy.",

They’re offering unique infrastructure that can be easily leveraged by other game developers on Arbitrum specifically targeted towards increasing game usage and user retention. Their product is highly composable and their distribution mechanism is simple and clear. \nIn contrast, the application lacked clear anti-sybil mechanisms or best practices for protocols looking to set up in-game quests. There is also very little data or available metrics for the protocol given its age on Arbitrum.\n\nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThis grant plan highlights existing traction for the project, how to scale that with the aid of a grant, and delivers a clear strategy to do so.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\n\nDoG Protocol's application showcased a comprehensive approach, with their SDK compatible with major game engines, simplifying game development for developers. Their strategy involves collaboration with 21 games, aiming for synergy with prominent gaming protocols on Arbitrum, such as Treasure. The allocated funding is intended to bolster user acquisition, enhance game usage, and improve user retention. Their product exhibits high composability, and their execution plan is well-defined. However, there is a noted absence of anti-sybil mechanisms, and we encourage the inclusion of additional metrics for monitoring performance and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Despite these considerations, we extend our endorsement for DoG Protocol's application.",

Their application was very thorough in describing their execution strategy, goals, milestones, and KPIs. They had a good emphasis on attempting to attract new users and deposits to Arbitrum using their existing user base.\nTheir requested grant size is very large given their age and protocol usage. Typically we would be against such a request however, they have provided performance-based milestones to unlock further tranches of their grant.\nThe other concern is that they currently have no audit (one is being completed with ottersec).\nUltimately, we think that Pike brings new and novel infrastructure to Arbitrum making it easier to connect with users across different chains. It will allow collateral to stay on Arbitrum while users explore other chains; and vice versa. Therefore, we feel like it’s ultimately the DAO’s decision as to whether or not they want to take a risk on the potential long-term benefits of Pike. We will support this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThis was a strong proposal in most areas other than request size and audits (which are still ongoing). Given the clear execution strategy, milestones, and metrics to proceed with the grant plan, Pike was able to overcome the softer scores in those areas of the rubric. We recommend approving this grant.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nWhile the product offering seems compelling, I question the size of the requested ARB and the ability for Pike to deliver on their aspirational goals relative to the size of the ask. If Pike were to lower their ask, I would be more receptive to their application. The Pike Protocol is aiming to bring cross-chain lending to the Arbitrum Ecosystem, they are in a capped launch at the moment, the product has yet to prove that it has significant demand for cross-chain lending/borrowing. They have stiff competition with native borrowing/lending platforms that are native to Arbitrum including Radiant. Their grant request has a wide range but overall I think it is too expensive and I fear when the incentives dry up so will the TVL gathered from the protocol. It would be better if they had a firm lower ask to test if their protocol gathered significant traction and then come back to the DAO for a large ask at a later time. \n\n*Karel Feedback)*\nVote FOR Pike's proposal.\n\nComprehensive proposal that scored well across the rubric with a detailed execution plan, milestones, and with a lens to maintaining stickiness throughout LTIPP. While this is a very large (ranged) grant size request in contrast to their life, the protocol has seen strong adoption across TVL and users, and the grant unlocked will be conditional upon the achievement of milestones which reduces risk.

      "title": "Alchemix LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal",
      "content": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/alchemix-ltipp-application-draft/21395\n\n## Council -  3/5 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*404 DAO Feedback*\nAlchemix presented a strong application scored well due to their prior history on Ethereum mainnet and thorough application. Their incentive design causes some concern due to how they plan to melt the ARB as repayment for the end-users loan. While we are normally against directly selling the ARB incentives as part of LTIPP, we believe in this case it is justified with how their users interact with their product. Overall, Alchemix justified their grant ask and provided a thorough execution strategy and fair success metrics. We will be supporting this application.\n\n*GMX Feedback*\nThe project has been in the space for a long time and has seen significant growth. However, there is a lack of details on how the project has performed on Arbitrum. The numbers mentioned regarding the size of the grant are conservative, and we doubt whether the protocol would be able to maintain liquidity post-incentives. The purpose of this grant is to bootstrap the AL (alchemist) ecosystem. While the overall grant is not large, which is a positive, I am unsure about the lasting impact of temporary boosts to the AL (assets). The protocol has been live on multiple chains, creating a significant impact in the DeFi ecosystem. The KPIs and milestones also seem quite low. For example, Milestone 3 aims for 50 addresses with open positions two-thirds of the way into grant distribution, and Milestone 4 targets 100 addresses with open positions at completion of grant distribution. This doesn’t demonstrate a wide enough impact to enhance the ecosystem. Unfortunately we won't be supporting the proposal.  \n\n\n*GFX Feedback*\nThis was a reasonably sized grant request for a protocol established on Ethereum and newly launching on Arbitrum. The grant plan was straightforward in goals and execution plan. Only major improvement we would have suggested would be a marketing element to Alchemix’s established Ethereum user base to come try the product on Arbitrum as well. We recommend this grant be approved.\n\n*Karel Feedback*\nVote AGAINST Alchemix's proposal.\n\nGood proposal that scored well across the rubric criteria that has been able to show resilience on ETH L1 throughout the bear keeping in mind exploits and other events that affected the protocol. The requested grant size is not crazy with sufficient justification and matching, however unable to endorse for the following reasons: (i) inconsistencies in target TVL (5M vs. 20M; presumably from the reduction in grant size); (ii) more detail behind stickiness and the migration strategy to drive L1 TVL into Arbitrum (difficult to form a reference and see if milestones are obtainable); (iii) would like to see greater adoption on Arbitrum first to showcase initial Arbitrum market demand; (iv) would have liked to see all milestones mapped against the KPIs with more robustness (against TVL and users).\n\n*Wintermute Feedback*\n\nAlchemix’s application was very solid with thorough justifications of their requested grant size, KPIs, milestones, and goals. The product itself is unique infrastructure that Arbitrum can benefit from and has proven demand. Furthermore, the team has shown their ability to work with previous incentive programs, manage their own incentives, and focus on building out protocol relationships.\nWe will be supporting this application.",

We would have preferred to see the applicant highlight something that had already worked well in the past, identified the mechanism responsible, and tailored a grant request to scaling or replicating that past success. The requested amount is simply too much for experimentation unless the plan also includes very rigorous milestones to meet in order to unlock full funding.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\n Integral's grant proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy to grow the liquidity on Arbitrum, focusing on enhancing the trading experience and growing platform adoption. The allocation of rewards for LPs and integration efforts with aggregators reflects a well-considered approach to incentivizing participation. The emphasis on sustainable growth, along with proactive engagement with token projects and aggregators, underscores a commitment to long-term ecosystem development. Transparent metrics tracking and milestone setting provide clarity and accountability. With Integral's track record of building highly capital-efficient products, particularly in offering the most efficient swaps, their plan to allocate funds evenly between liquidity incentives and integration support appears sound. The proposed KPIs and milestones align well with the goals of increasing liquidity and fostering ecosystem growth on Arbitrum. Integral's focus on enabling other protocols to integrate and build on top of their platform could contribute significantly to Arbitrum's growth by offering cheaper swaps, attracting more users, and reducing friction. Overall, supporting this proposal could prove to be a mutually beneficial decision for the DAO and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n*404 Feedback)*\n\nIntegral presented a strong application that highlighted their recent growth, strong execution strategy, and thorough KPIs. The milestones should have been much more robust and while the grant ask is relatively large we believe given the recent growth there is value in supporting this request so we support this application. \n\n*Karel Feedback)*\nVote FOR Integral's proposal.\n\nGood proposal with very detailed justification behind grant size, and execution plan. and milestones/KPIs by week (re: LP incentives). Grant size is on the larger end in contrast to performance on Arbitrum vs. Ethereum but well justified re: capital efficiency + increased Arbitrum adoption and all in all presents a worthwhile experiment for Arbitrum to invest in scaling out. Would have liked to see more detail behind the development incentives (representing ~44% of the grant) and detail on parameters to be used to inform the 2-30k ARB incentives.",

They provided very thorough justifications and explanations of their goals, KPIs, milestones, and how they will benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nTheir product adds increased utility and features to Safe, making access to DeFi a lot easier for sticker users like DAOs and multisigs.\nThey provided a great execution strategy that incentivises usage of other Arbitrum DeFi protocols, encourages stickiness, and aims to migrate users to Arbitrum.\nTheir requested grant size was sufficiently justified. While the project doesn’t have a crazy amount of adoption, these are the types of infrastructure projects the DAO should be supporting.\n\n*GFX Feedback*\nThe applicant’s project is showing signs of traction, and the request amount was justified with target APY, which was helpful, but the target seemed somewhat arbitrary. The request is large relative to the protocol size, however. The applicant is advised to revise and resubmit in later grants cycles with a plan that identifies drivers of current growth and specifically replicates or scales that growth. \n\n*Karel Feedback*\nVote FOR Brahma's proposal. \n\nInnovative project and well-written proposal across the rubric. Liked the allocation factors and believe there's sufficient diversity to ensure grant goes to the right users within the project. Would like to see further detail on composability and partnerships with other Arbitrum protocols (re: automation/batched routines) and justification behind the grant size and the execution plan to 5x Arbitrum TVL by end of LTIPP but given current organic traction in past few months and exposure Brahma has with other ecos (Blast), believe this is achievable.\n\n*GMX Feedback*\n\nWe would approve this proposal because it presents a comprehensive plan to drive growth and innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem through the Brahma Console platform. The team's extensive experience and track record, coupled with their clear roadmap and well-defined objectives, inspire confidence in their ability to execute effectively. Their approach to incentivizing user engagement, increasing TVL, and achieving composability aligns well with the goals of the grant program. Additionally, the proposed milestones are ambitious yet feasible, supported by the team's past achievements and the organic growth of their platform on Arbitrum thus far. Overall, this proposal demonstrates a strong potential to contribute significantly to the development and expansion of the Arbitrum ecosystem.",

      "content": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/covenant-finance-ltipp-application-draft/21821\n\n## Council -  3/4 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*Wintermute Feedback*\nCovenant Finance’s application was decent and they provided a clear vision of how they expect to benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem. Their product is unique and introduces a new primitive to DeFi.\nTheir grant request is not large and their justification is sound. However, we are concerned about their ability to execute given their age and lack of adoption due to Beta and Alpha stages.\nTheir composability with Uniswap V3 is great and the ability for the protocol to work with long-tail and obscure assets is a great added benefit.\nGiven they are deployed on Optimism, we feel it should ultimately be up to the DAO to decide whether or not they want to take a risk in funding a potentially new DeFi primitive that improves Arbitrum’s competitive advantage. We will be supporting this application.\n\n\n*GFX Feedback*\nWe found this to be an interesting project, and a grant plan that was simple and clear. Unfortunately, the applicant did not quite meet the cutoff where we recommend a grant be approved. Recommend the applicant resubmit in later grants cycles and focus on improving their score in the security and product usage areas. What would make this grant plan much stronger would be to go live, have some success, identify the levers that were pulled to make that happen, and then tailor a grant to scale or reproduce that initial success.\n\n*GMX Feedback*\n\nCovenant Finance aims to bring new debt markets to the Arbitrum and Crypto Markets. The product is innovative as it allows for a perpetual debt which is not currently offered on Arbitrum. The project is able to integrate many of the native debt tokens in the ecosystem including Pendle-YT tokens. Although the project is in early stages I feel the level of innovation the project brings may be a net positive for the ecosystem, the grant size is modest and I think worth the risk for the DAO. The KPIs and milestones also seem reasonable and well thought out. We would be supporting the proposal. \n\n\n*404 DAO Feedback*\nCovenant presents a novel DeFi primitive focusing on instantiating liquidity for perpetual debt markets. While they lack usage, we believe this is an interesting use-case for Arbitrum’s DeFi ecosystem. They provided a strong execution plan and KPIs with relatively sound milestones. While this grant ask is a bit high given current usage, this is a project we think it is worth it for the DAO to take a risk on and will be supporting.",

      "content": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/gyroscope-ltipp-application-draft/21692\n\n## Council -  3/4 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nWe appreciated that the applicant cited a grant and its results on Optimism. The reward for the incentives was not compelling in that example, however. Also, funding support for as-yet-to-be-determined integration partners is hard to sign off on, since as reviewers, we need to know where the ARB funds will end up. Finally, Gyroscope has almost no presence on Arbitrum according to DeFi Llama, which makes a large grant request difficult to support.\n\n*404 DAO Feedback)*\nGyroscope presented a very thorough application. One that scored very well across most of the rubric. Specifically, they excelled in justifying their KPIs and objectives as it relates to expanding their E-CLPs and expanding their stablecoin integrations. The main concerns were centered around where the majority of their usage has been (Polygon and Optimism) and some lack of clarity around their milestones. Overall, we will be suppporting Gyroscope on the basis of expanding stablecoin innovation and adoption on Arbitrum for what we feel as a very reasonable grant ask.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nThe protocol may not have high numbers on the Arbitrum network currently, but they have demonstrated decent traction on other Layer 2 solutions. GYD stablecoin stands out by implementing a basket of assets for backing, along with automated risk diversification rules. Integration with Frax and Balancer enhances its composability with other ecosystem projects. The proposed $10 million TVL target appears reasonable given their grant ask. The team boasts a solid background, with one founder having published work on Google Scholar. Their effective use of incentives in the past, particularly with Optimism, bodes well for their ability to drive adoption. Leveraging their points system to attract more users seems like a sound strategy, although safeguards against Sybil attacks should be clarified. Overall, Gryoscope aims to introduce a decentralized stablecoin backed by various assets to the Arbitrum ecosystem. With clear KPIs and milestones, they aim to utilize the $100k grant to incentivize and bootstrap their stablecoin for adoption. If they can achieve a $10 million liquidity target, they believe they can kickstart adoption. While Arbitrum lacks decentralized stable value options, Gryoscope has the potential to fill that gap if they can gain traction. The proposal is well-written and outlines their objectives very well.\n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\nGyroscope’s application was very good, they provided very thorough details and justifications of their KPIs, milestones, goals, and objectives. They provided a clear vision of how they impact the DeFi landscape and how they will benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nTheir product is unique and they bring some interesting infrastructure to Arbitrum. Their demonstrated ability to successfully work with previous incentives is a plus. Their requested grant size is sufficiently justified and they have a solid execution strategy, however, we would’ve liked to have seen some more variety in the pool selection. Lastly, their project is highly composable and the product has demonstrated its ability to capture a significant amount of 1inch flow and transactions.\nWe will be supporting this application.",

They provided detailed explanations of their goals, KPIs, and milestones. Their requested grant size is rather large, however, given their ability to use previous grants effectively and increase TVL on Avalanche reduces some of the concerns. We also like how composable the project is which will lead to a direct boost in metrics for other protocols.\nIn contrast, we would’ve liked to have seen more data around protocol usage, user information, retention etc. \nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\nVote AGAINST DeltaPrime's proposal.\n\nWell written proposal that scored well in the rubric (team, strategy, KPIs, milestones, composability) + painted a clear picture that they understand their users well and have a good amount of insight from prior incentive programs they've run (re: points system). The large requested grant size relative to their activity on Arbitrum, the set goals of ~6x-ing TVL within a quarter, and lack of clarity on retention (to support their claim of TVL not flowing out of Prime Accounts for instance re: stickiness) brings pause.\n\nSuggest they resubmit in a future grants window with a lower amount (ie. 500k ARB / $50M TVL) after showing more PMF within Arbitrum and integration of other protocols.\n\n\n*404 DAO Feedback)*\nDeltaprime presented a very thorough application. Their organic metrics were quite impressive and the had strong justifications behind their grant ask. We appreciate their ability to incorporate learnings from past incentives and implement desired changes into this program. Overall, we felt the application was heavily tailored to enabling growth on Arbitrum and we will be supporting this proposal.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nBased on the detailed information provided, the proposal outlines a comprehensive plan to leverage the DeltaPrime protocol to encourage growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The protocol has already demonstrated success on Avalanche and Arbitrum, with a track record of high TVL and user engagement. The proposed grant will further incentivize liquidity provision and borrowing activities, driving TVL growth and deepening liquidity across partner protocols. The use of milestones, speed bonuses, and retention incentives ensures user engagement and stickiness, while the multi-chain integration through the LiFi bridge enhances accessibility and attracts capital from other networks. With a robust security infrastructure, clear objectives, and well-defined KPIs, the proposal exhibits a strategic approach to achieving its goals and contributing significantly to the development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. We would approve this proposal.",

We will be supporting this application.\n\n*Wintermute Feedback*\nContago’s application was clear and concise in describing its objectives, milestones, and KPIs; all of which were sufficiently justified through reasonable calculations. The protocol itself has seen strong growth since its launch and offers a unique product for the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nTheir incentive mechanism is okay but still gameable by someone remaining delta-neutral through a separate trading venue. We would’ve liked to have seen a better reward system that attempts to encourage activity instead of just holding an open position for a long period of time (e.g., PnL Trading competitions).\nLastly, given their protocol is built on top of other DeFi primitives there are strong second-order effects from activity on the protocol.\nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*Karel Feedback*\n \t\nVote FOR Contango's proposal.\n\nGood proposal that ranked well on rubric + protocol has seen meaningful growth on Arbitrum since launch.

We are not typically supportive of pure LM efforts, however, Gauntlet and the Uniswap DAO have previously proven their ability to target pools correctly in order to achieve longer-lasting results. The application provided sufficient justifications of KPIs and objectives, however, we would’ve liked to have seen some more specifics around target pools, APRs, and milestones.\nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nI’m supportive of approving Uniswap’s grant application. They are proven in the space and one of the leading innovators. Being a part of helping Uniswap grow their development can only be beneficial for Arbitrum. The proposed objectives, execution strategy, and KPIs are well-defined, indicating a thorough understanding of the project's goals and how to achieve them. Furthermore, the proposal emphasizes the importance of fostering sustainable growth and innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem, which aligns with the broader goals of promoting DeFi development and adoption. Overall, this proposal presents a compelling case for why the grant would enable significant positive impact on the Arbitrum network. \nJust one feedback from our side would be to not use the incentives towards UADP holding 15K ARB as a delegate. It won't make a significant difference; it's better to use that 15K ARB towards incentives.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\n\"Vote FOR Uniswap's proposal.\n\nStrong proposal and endorsing as believe this will lead to gowth + sustained activity on Arbitrum. Would have liked to see more specificity around Gauntlet's strategy to select pools + other mechanisms.\"",

They presented clear KPIs, milestones, and goals, and have a decent understanding of how their product benefits the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nTheir product has only recently begun to see substantial growth but is still slightly underwhelming given their age. Nonetheless, the protocol has a decent amount of activity and brings some novel infrastructure to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nTheir justification of the grant size is okay but rather ambitious. Given the level of activity on their protocol, the allocated amount of weekly ARB seems high.\nThey’ve incorporated some nice requirements on both the user and manager side to ensure rewards are going to more genuine users. However, we would’ve liked to see some of their rewards allocated towards a PnL trading league for managers to actively push activity on the platform.\n\nGiven their alignment with Arbitrum, composability, recent growth, and novel product, we will be supporting this proposal.\n\n*404 Feedback)*\nSTFX scored well across most of the rubric, mainly losing points for a large grant ask for their current usage which may lead to poor distribution. However, they have shown growth as the market has picked up and their execution strategy/milestone orientation is thorough and well-designed. We believe this market timing is opportune and this decision should be pushed to the DAO. We will be supporting this proposal.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\nVote FOR STFX's proposal.\n\nStrong proposal that scored well on rubric (protocol details, KPIs, milestones, etc). Despite launching in 2022, they have seen moderate growth with it beginning to balloon in recent times. While the grant size is high in contrast to usage and they have ambitious milestones/KPIs to hit, there are a number of product unlocks around the corner (Privy, PWA) that will help seed this on top of a potential LTIPP grant, believe it is a worthwhile use of capital from the DAO. Would have liked to see manager incentivization strategy as well on top of end users/investors and believe the assumed 50%/80% retention rate is too liberal and should be decreased.

While we appreciated they modeled their grant on previous grants, it would have been much more compelling to demonstrate that the prior grant for Dolomite delivered results supporting the goals of this applicant. Nonetheless, the plan scored well enough overall that we recommend approval.\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\nGravita’s application was solid and scored well across most criteria. They provided clear KPIs, goals, and milestones, with thorough justification of their grant size. Typically, we are not a huge fan of pure LM programs, however, given the nature of the protocol, it makes sense in this situation. Furthermore, it will certainly help the adoption of LRT tokens on Arbitrum, unlocking greater capital efficiency.\nThe protocol has seen solid growth since its inception and the team has proven they are effective in managing incentive programs. Lastly, they provided sufficient justifications and calculations for their request grant size.\nWe believe that this grant request will be a net positive for Arbitrum.\n*Karel Feedback)*\n\n\"Vote FOR Gravita's proposal.\n\nWell-written proposal and scored well on rubric. Protocol has seen moderate traction on mainnet and Arbitrum but GRAI currently sees limited liquidity and demand/integration on Arbitrum. Would have liked to see more granular milestones and KPIs biweekly with target APR for each pair (and how this changes from weeks 1-6 -> 6-9 -> 9-12) but believe a worthwhile bet to make from the DAO.\"",

Driving further LST adoption on Arbitrum is necessary and will help solidify Arbitrum's competitive position in the market. Straightforward request and good grant size to support well-justified KPI/metric targets. Cian's Grand Adventure initiative is novel and supports longer-term stickiness that may potentially outlive LTIPP.

This innovative approach unlocks a fresh yield source derived from treasury-backed RWAs, offering an alternative to conventional liquidity mining incentives.

This application benefitted from being very straightforward in their plan and purpose. While we felt their milestone orientation were weak and grant ask was relatively high to their TVL, we are supportive of this endeavor to drive this liquidity/capital to Arbitrum. The grant ask is pretty small and feel the risk is worth pushing this to the DAO. \n\n*Karel Feedback*\n\"Vote AGAINST Charm Finance's proposal.\n\nWell-written proposal but the justification for grant size focused on a single vault that exceeds total amount of TVL on Arbitrum is insufficient. There's indeed a large market to be tapped into but it seems unrealistic that this will be possible for the duration of the grant.\"\t\t\n\n*GMX Feedback*\nThe Charm Finance proposal aims to bring some of the 600 million in Mainnet Liquidity they have for their WETH/WBTC vault over to arbitrum using 55k of ARB. Given the relatively small ask of the grant and the need for more wBTC liquidity on Arbitrum I would be in support of this proposal. This incentive program's KPIs will depend on how much they can attract new users to the lower cost L2 environment. \n\nFor a fairly small grant this has the potential to deepen wBTC liquidity on Arbitrum and make it so users no longer need to leave the ecosystem to swap larger amounts. \n\n*GFX Feedback*\n\nThe request is small, the execution plan simple. This is at the upper bounds of what we consider appropriate for more experimental and speculative grants. We recommend approving this grant, as it scored well overall.",

It’s unclear how many users will want to connect an Arbitrum address to banking services, but the structure of the connection (via NFT) and the nature of payment services suggest any users will be extremely sticky to Arbitrum as a chain.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nSafepal’s grant proposal introduces an innovative strategy for linking Arbitrum with traditional banking services. While the potential demand for connecting an Arbitrum address to banking remains uncertain, this approach creatively enhances ecosystem engagement by leveraging payment rails and banking facilities. Although we have reservations about the $20 CPA, this initiative presents an opportunity for experimentation to assess its viability on Arbitrum. If successful, it could serve as a model for collaboration with other wallet providers and payment rails in the future.\n\n*404 Feedback)*\nSafePal provided a thorough justification for the grant size along with clear milestones, KPIs, and a solid distribution strategy. We ranked them high on sybil resistance due to the requirement of a banking KYC. The SafePal banking gateway and Visa card product is novel and an exciting addition to the Arbitrum ecosystem that we believe will bring in new users. \n\nSome additional points for improvement, there was a lot of duplicated content and several details could have been more concise. While the details and context were sometimes helpful, the length and redundancy of info made it sometimes difficult to grade the application. Additionally, SafePal provided a lot examples of previous incentive programs and product usage, but there was no way to verify most of this information.",

They have a clear vision of how their product intends to bring benefits to Arbitrum with straightforward KPIs and milestones. Their grant request is sufficiently justified and their project is quite composable. They didn’t score well in protocol activity, age, and usage on Arbitrum and other chains, and lastly, there was not much innovation in the incentive mechanism.\nOverall, it was a solid application with a reasonable grant request that attempts to solve an inherent DeFi problem. We will be supporting this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThis protocol aims to solve a pain point for rebasing tokens, though this is noticeably more of a pain point for issuers whose products suffer than it is for users who may simply opt into different tokens. The protocol is relatively young, with modest success in attracting users. This proposal would be considerably strengthened if the applicants identified clear mechanisms that have led to some initial success or momentum, and then craft the grant program around expanding or leveraging those mechanisms for sustained growth, rather than simply putting an APY target on LPing the major assets they already support without much differentiation.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nPoolside is a recently established protocol that has yet to gain significant traction. It aims to streamline the integration of yield-bearing assets within the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem while safeguarding Liquidity Providers against foreseeable losses, addressing a prevalent concern in DeFi. We appreciate their strategy to incentivize participation in their pools, fostering increased TVL and potentially generating a favorable feedback loop to enhance pool efficiency. The rationale behind their grant request is sound, and we support this application.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\nVote FOR Poolside's proposal.\n\nWell-written proposal that scored well across the rubric. While it's a young protocol, it has shown modest traction and the potential to grow/scale further with the right incentives in place (albeit Arbitrum adoption has been lacking). The proposal presents a relatively straightforward incentive structure but provides a detailed plan on how it hopes to achieve their goals. Would have liked to see more detail behind stickiness post-program and greater detail on their Points system + how that could potentially feed into the proposal. Grant size could have been slightly reduced given current traction but a worthwhile experiment for the DAO.",

Their product is relatively unique with a wide variety of assets, allowing Arbitrum to tap into their existing user base across multiple chains.\nTheir KPIs, goals, and milestones were clearly displayed with a good amount of justification. They have a solid execution strategy with experience in distributing grants previously, although they could’ve been a bit more innovative in rewarding existing users to move capital or take out loans on Arbitrum.\nTheir requested grant size is well justified and inline with their current TVL. Our main concern is that there hasn’t been a huge amount of growth or adoption of the protocol.\nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nNormally this request would be on the large side for the grant plan, but Prime’s cross-chain deployments and stated intention to introduce users on other chains to Arbitrum allow it to score highly enough that we recommend this grant be approved.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nWe would be supporting the proposal. The protocol demonstrates extensive experience in utilizing incentives, as evidenced by their successful implementation with Moonbeam. Their goal of achieving a TVL of $10 million aligns well with their proposed grant amount and appears to be quite feasible. Of particular significance is their strategy to attract users from other ecosystems to Arbitrum, leveraging the same approach that proved effective with Moonbeam. Additionally, they plan to utilize the Prime Points community program to efficiently distribute incentives, further bolstering user adoption on Arbitrum.\n\nThe Prime Protocol introduces a compelling concept whereby users can borrow against their liquidity on any chain, facilitating cross-chain liquidity utilization. For instance, users could borrow against their BNB holdings on a different network and access USDC on Arbitrum. This design has the potential to broaden Arbitrum's liquidity base by tapping into external ecosystems while providing users with exposure to Arbitrum's low-cost environment. However, there is a need for more detailed information in the KPI and milestones section, particularly regarding the planned \"ramping up\" process, which requires clarification to ensure transparency and accountability in project execution.",

      "content": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stakewise-ltipp-application-draft/21754\n\n## Council -  3/4 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\nStakewise had a strong application based on its product, attractiveness, user base, ability to execute, and potential for long-lasting benefits.\nWe would’ve liked to have seen Stakewise actively try and expand to Arbitrum prior to the launch of LTIPP, however, given they have demonstrated a strong ability to grow TVL on Ethereum we think their grant size is justified (through their calculations as well).\nWe appreciate their commitment to match ARB rewards with their native token and ensure that these rewards are committed for 12 months.\nTheir execution strategy is simple and clear; we would’ve liked to have seen some more innovation than pure liquidity mining but their emphasis on rewarding migration is nice. Furthermore, we like that they will also be attempting to migrate their native governance token. \nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThe applicant presents a plan that is both simple in execution and easy to monitor. Staked ETH also should be a priority for Arbitrum, as it is a quality, yield-bearing asset, thereby creating a capital flow from Ethereum to Arbitrum. Despite the high request size, we feel the potential gains for Arbitrum outweigh the price tag. We recommend this grant be approved.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nUnclear if they intend to support native minting as many other liquid derivatives have offered which greatly simplified the process of onboarding capital and continues to reinforce Arbitrum as a primary hub.  The fact that the only reference was a small bridged amount of osETH (via presumably the canonical bridge) makes it seem unlikely; 40% of the incentives are going to incentivize their own native token (it is an 80:20 balancer token so that is potentially still contributing more so to osETH liquidity but again it seems a less productive use of the proceeds for building protocol usage and more towards their token.  Would have been better to see these amounts go towards alternative uses.\n\nThe majority of the funds will be used to incentivize their own liquidity pool to deepen liquidity of the osETH/SWISE market and try and bring osETH from mainnet to Arbitrum. The grant size is large and I struggle to see how deep liquidity they may build with osETH will continue once the incentives end. I fail to see how incentivizing their own token liquidity will have a long lasting impact on the DAO and be a good return on investment.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\nVote FOR Stakewise's proposal.\n\nDetailed proposal that scored well in the rubric, namely re: stickiness to retain liquidity post-LTIPP and matching from Stakewise. Growing Arbitrum's share re: staked ETH is important and they've signalled a clear intention to align themselves with Arbitrum over the long term with the migration plans and incentives. The incentive mechanism is pretty straightforward re: liquidity mining. It's a large requested grant size relative to Arbitrum adoption/market demand and would have liked to see greater granularity + detail behind the milestones/timelines to match the stated KPIs, as well as the early start to a move into Arbitrum prior to LTIPP. Endorsing to the DAO despite this given importance of LSTs in the market.",

They scored well in reach, activity, age, composability, and novelty. In contrast, the application lacked specifics regarding how they plan to incentivizing users in game and why such mechanisms are relevant (execution strategy).\nThey also lost some points due to allocating 50k (⅓ of their grant request) to marketing campaigns, which leads to the ARB not reaching the hands of users and lacks the ability for oversight. However, they have been very open in reporting data for their marketing initiatives.\nOverall, we plan to support this proposal and think it offers the DAO a good opportunity to learn from ARB being spent on marketing efforts. The team has clearly shown their ability to attract users, so we think it’s worth it for the DAO to vote on whether or not they want to support this type of grant.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThe grant plan demonstrates existing and growing usage (as measured by DAUs). The plan is also tailored to build on existing growth by specifically targeting segments of gamer population on other chains and in the audience of web2 gamer influencers. The total amount requested seems appropriate for the ambitious milestones and the plan of attack laid out. We recommend this grant be approved.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\n\nKuroro shows promising potential, supported by a robust protocol performance since their game launch. The proposed funding aims to facilitate the integration of gamers from diverse ecosystems such as Immutable, Solana, and Ronin. Leveraging a strong user retention rate, attracting users through this funding could yield considerable value. Kuroro pledges to match incentives and utilize the funds to achieve their Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) However, a notable portion of the grant is allocated to marketing, which might not directly benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem. Nevertheless, the team has maintained transparency in reporting data concerning their marketing endeavors. We endorse Kuroro's application.",

They provided thorough explanations regarding their KPIs, milestones, and goals, with supporting calculations. Considering their age, their protocol has been able to establish a solid uptick in activity and TVL, however, this has declined notably since their application.\nTheir target TVL is pretty ambitious and therefore, their requested grant size is on the large end. However, they provided a solid execution strategy. In their execution strategy, we appreciate that they are focusing on important markets relevant to Arbitrum and the DeFi ecosystem. Their locking mechanism and long-term emission schedule is a nice addition that should help incentivise stickiness.\nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nWhile the request is large and the project relatively new, the applicant did a good job utilizing data from recent grants for similar projects to justify both the sizing and execution strategy. We recommend this grant be approved.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nThe protocol has experienced significant growth with its current incentives program and has garnered promising early traction. The proposal is well-defined, with clear milestones that outline the project's trajectory. Overall, it's a well-written proposal that provides comprehensive data on the protocol, and the incentive strategy appears sound. We are inclined to support this proposal.Synonym is a cross-chain lending platform, akin to Silo and Dolimite. While they have received funding from the foundation, it's not intended for use as incentives. This grant of 400k aims to stimulate borrowing and depositing on their platform. By funding this application, users will gain access to another lending/borrowing protocol with a proven track record, thereby enhancing the overall Arbitrum TVL and benefiting the ecosystem. Though the milestones may seem ambitious, they plan to use their token to incentivize users.",

      "content": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/fiat24-application-draft/21577\n\n## Council -  3/5 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\n\"Vote AGAINST Fiat24's proposal.\n\nInteresting and good proposal that scored well on the rubric. Coming from FinTech and the open banking world, it's an impressive feat with their accolades re: receiving a Swiss banking license and building this atop Arbitrum. On the grant size, it is large for what will generally support a relatively closed and less composable ecosystem and the structure of the grant is not optimal with a portion going towards affiliate partnerships. Recommend they resubmit in a later grants window with a lower amount and focus only on the referral campaigns.\"\t\t\n\n*404 DAO Feedback)*\nWhile Fiat24 presented a strong application we are concerned about the potential for a double dipping of grant funds due to the overlap in SafePal’s proposal. Both proposals presented similar execution plans by rewarding users who sign up, complete KYC, and transact. Additionally, the affiliate partner program grants will likely be going to other LTIPP applicants who use of Fiat24. Fiat24 has run a previous referral program of 19k, but the requested 490k is a big step up. Given the large ask of Fiat24, we have decided to support SafePal and its smaller request to see how this type of referral & sign up program performs over the next 3 months. Regarding their application specifically, the milestone section was lacking and additional  data on usage would’ve been helpful. We encourage Fiat24 to apply again for the LTIP. \n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nThe proposal presents a comprehensive overview, showcasing strong collaborations with industry giants like Visa and Mastercard. From the perspective of Real World Assets (RWA), the protocol has demonstrated decent growth, and with the proposed incentives and milestones, we anticipate significant adoption within the RWA space. The protocol's roadmap is clearly defined, with plans to expand and transition into an orbit chain, aligning well with Arbitrum's protocol goals. With all users undergoing KYC procedures, the risk of sybil attacks is mitigated, as each individual possesses a unique identity. Additionally, Fiat24 has previously proven its ability to onboard users into the RWA arena through a grant from the Arbitrum foundation. This presents a unique opportunity to blend DeFi and RWAs using the Arbitrum Stack. While the overall grant size is substantial, it has the potential to catalyze a wave of RWA users, benefiting the ecosystem as a whole. The proposed KPIs and milestones appear reasonable, and the team exhibits a commendable level of experience. Considering these factors, there is strong support for this proposal.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThis grant plan, while expensive, explicitly targets onboarding new users to Abitrum and with a product that provides real utility. We recommend approving this grant. \n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\nFiat24’s application was very unique and awesome to see. They bring novel infrastructure to Arbitrum that will likely result in very sticky TVL and users. Their application was solid with decent justifications for milestones, KPIs, and goals. Their requested grant size is on the larger end however, it is in line with their onchain metrics. They provided sufficient justification and calculation of their requested grant size through the cost of customer acquisition and their execution strategy follows closely to previous incentive plans that have worked well for them.\nWe are typically hesitant to reward grants to projects with KYC barriers, however, in this case, if successful, we believe Fiat24 can significantly improve the competitive landscape of Arbitrum.",

The team has a strong track record and the product has great usage metrics. Quests are great way to drive retention and onboard new users. Their milestones are clear and specifically target increasing users & activity on Arbitrum.

They presented thorough and clear KPIs, milestones, and objectives. Their value proposition to Arbitrum is clear with extensive historical data to support their requested grant size.

Product has shown solid PMF and adoption across projects and ecosystems. Good execution and milestone design, though believe main points off come from: further sybil/bot protection mechanisms and brinigng more data on-chain.

      "content": "## Link to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/debridge-ltipp-application-draft/21668\n\n## Council -  3/3 Yes Votes\n\n### Feedback\n\n*GMX Feedback*\nDeBridge has already demonstrated its value by processing over $200 million in trading volume through Arbitrum, representing a substantial portion of the total volume without any incentives. With the introduction of incentives, these numbers are expected to grow even further. Additionally, a portion of their incentives will be allocated to partner incentives for their deBridge API integration, enhancing their composability with other ecosystem projects. The proposal outlines clear milestones, and if achieved, they have the potential to attract a significant number of users to Arbitrum. The proposal is well-written and deserving of support. DeBridge has experienced significant growth and is seeking $1 million in incentives to reduce costs and friction for entry into the Arbitrum ecosystem. The proposed milestones aim for ambitious targets that, if met, could substantially improve the accessibility and ease-of-use of Arbitrum. This grant is expected to be a net benefit to the ecosystem, considering DeBridge's pre-incentive usage and the likelihood of retaining users post-incentives. Overall, the proposal is viewed positively, with confidence in DeBridge's ability to contribute positively to the ecosystem. \n\n*Karel Feedback*\nVote FOR deBridge's proposal.\n\nStrong proposal that scored well across rubric. The grant request, while large, is well justified and structured across end users (makers, takers, and integration partners). Milestones/KPIs are well justified and realistic to be achieved with added incentives from the program. Would have loved more detail regarding Arbitrum integration partners and any plans to continue to grow this over time.\n\n*404 DAO Feedback*\nDeBridge presented a strong application that scored well across most of the rubric. They provided strong justification for a rather large grant ask and presented a thorough execution strategy. One major issue with the proposal is around the subsidizing of outflows from Arbitrum. While this action is subsidized at a fraction of inflows, this is not an action that we would like to see incentivized and led to a point deduction. Regardless, their recent growth along with their strong justification has lead us to support this proposal.",

Stablecoins, while a competitive sector, are a primitive necessity for DeFi. It is one of the few sectors where you want a lot of competition because there are generally a lot of different approaches to a solution. Additionally, Verified USD wants to utilize the adoption of RWAs in their stablecoin model, which has some novelty. The team's proactive engagement with key partners such as Fiat24 and MugglePay, coupled with their track record of successful liquidity programs and ecosystem support, instills confidence in their ability to effectively utilize the grant funds to foster growth and innovation within the Arbitrum network. Additionally, their willingness to accept linear funding and the oversight of a multisig further ensures accountability and transparency throughout the grant execution process. Overall, this proposal aligns with the goals of promoting ecosystem development and advancing the utility of USDV within Arbitrum, making it a compelling candidate for approval. \n\n*Karel Feedback)*\nVote FOR Verified USD's proposal.\n\nStrong proposal that scored well across rubric (execution plan, grant justification, breakdown, milestones, etc.). Interesting opportunity to drive greater USDV adoption on Arbitrum from other ecosystems. Would have liked to see more justification re: why MugglePlay / Fiat24 as strategic partners for integration over others and also to fully confirm whether rebates to MugglePay/Fiat24 are to partners or directly to end-users. Regardless, support this moving to DAO.\t\n\n*404 Feedback)*\nVerifiedUSD presented a well-rounded proposal scoring well in most all categories. We support their integrations for enabling payments onchain and felt they provided solid justifications in their grant ask and planned strategy. We will be supporting this application.",

      "content": "# [](#constitutional-non-constitutional-1)Constitutional / Non-Constitutional\n\nNon-Constitutional\n\n## [](#abstract-2)Abstract\n\nTally has contributed to the Arbitrum DAO as a service provider since the DAO was created one year ago, serving as the home for [onchain governance](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum), [security council elections](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/council/security-council/election/0/round-2), and [delegation](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates). We’ve gathered feedback about how we can improve our support for Arbitrum through many conversations over the past year with DAO stakeholders including delegates, contributors, and Foundation representatives. We propose to expand our support for the Arbitrum DAO by improving the proposal process, upgrading the Governor contracts, and highlighting delegate contributions. We also propose to ensure that the DAO is set up for success by researching specifications for partial delegation and shielded voting.\n\n## [](#motivation-3)Motivation\n\nArbitrum is the largest and most decentralized DAO in the world. Tally is highly invested in the success of both the Arbitrum DAO specifically and the Arbitrum community as a whole. We have a strong track record as an Arbitrum governance service provider, [ecosystem builder](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tally-final-stip-round-1/17557), and [delegate](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegate/0xfrisson.eth). Tally continuously ships improvements for the Arbitrum DAO, including [transfer actions](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1732425795262714363?s=20), [improved Safe support](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1714647532423561257?s=20), [proposal collaboration](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1743325532786168149?s=20), and the [nominee selection stage](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-changes-to-the-constitution-and-the-security-council-election-process/20856/9) of Security Council elections. This proposal would enable us to invest more resources into the Arbitrum DAO and scale up our impact.\n\nThe majority of the improvements outlined in this proposal are specific to Arbitrum’s unique implementation of onchain governance and will not be re-used in other DAOs. We are long-term partners to the Arbitrum DAO who plan to continue investing specifically in making Arbitrum governance great.\n\n## [](#rationale-4)Rationale\n\nThis proposal contributes to Arbitrum [Community Values](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values) by making the Arbitrum DAO more socially inclusive, technically inclusive, and user-focused. Our proposed improvements make it easier for contributors of all backgrounds and technical abilities to engage with Arbitrum governance.\n\n## [](#specifications-and-steps-to-implement-5)Specifications and Steps to Implement\n\nWe propose to expand our support for the Arbitrum DAO by improving the proposal process, upgrading the Governor contracts, and highlighting delegate contributions. We also propose to ensure that the DAO is set up for success by developing a specification for partial delegation and shielded voting.\n\n**Improve the proposal process**\n*Watch a demo video* [here](https://youtu.be/yORl1yZPt7Q) *- note that this demo is designed to provide a general overview of the user experience. It is not a final design.*\n\n* Link forum proposal posts and Tally proposals so that delegates can create Tally proposals from forum posts, see forum proposal comments directly on Tally, and be updated by a Tally Discourse bot when onchain proposals are created.\n  * In order to show posts on the proposal page, Tally would need [Embedding permission](https://meta.discourse.org/t/embed-discourse-comments-on-another-website-via-javascript/31963)\n  * In order to post “this proposal is now onchain (link)”, the Tally Discourse bot would need an API key with topics.writepermission from <https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/admin/api/keys/new>\n* Build a diff checker into Tally proposals that shows what text has changed from Snapshot without having to click back over to Snapshot, to help delegates understand any relevant changes from the temp check phase to the onchain governance phase.\n* Enable cancel functionality on Tally proposals so proposal creators can cancel onchain proposals if there are mistakes. (see upgrade Governor contracts section)\n* Develop full proposal execution integration by dynamically showing [each phase of proposal execution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal#the-lifecycle-of-an-arbitrum-improvement-proposal) with accurate time stamps so that contributors and delegates can easily manage proposals through the execution process.\n* Improve support for [late quorum extension](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-glossary#late-quorum-extension) on Tally so onchain proposals are automatically extended on Tally when late quorum extension is triggered.\n* Fully integrate the [quorum of each Governor](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-faqs#what-determines-the-quorum-minimum-votes-required-for-a-governance-proposal) throughout Tally, including on the proposal page and the delegates page so that delegates always know exactly how much voting power is required to reach quorum.\n* Show [Security Council](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/security-council#the-role-of-the-security-council) transactions on the main [Arbitrum DAO page](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum) on Tally so the DAO can easily view actions taken by the Security Council.\n\n**Upgrade Governor contracts**\n*We’re planning to partner with* [Scopelift](https://scopelift.co/) *to implement the upgrades. Scopelift is the developer of Flexible Voting and has deep experience with high-value governance contract upgrades.*\n\n* Add a [cancel() function](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/92ff025622cdf6694318fc11af1c995236793a77/contracts/governance/Governor.sol#L455-L473) to the Arbitrum DAO’s implementation of OpenZeppelin Governor so proposal creators can cancel onchain proposals if there are mistakes.\n* Add [Flexible Voting](https://github.com/ScopeLift/flexible-voting) to the Arbitrum DAO Governors to enable future innovations like voting from Orbit chains, voting from DeFi contracts, and shielded voting.\n\n**Highlight delegate contributions**\n*Watch a demo video* [here](https://youtu.be/WY1jQ2tP70U) *- note that this demo is designed to provide a general overview of the user experience. It is not a final design.*\n\n* Integrate [Karma’s](https://www.karmahq.xyz/) delegate score and contributor metrics into Tally’s delegate page so token holders and DAO stakeholders have access to holistic participation information. Karma will provide the following via their API:\n  * Onchain and Snapshot voting pct, delegator count, voting power, list of delegators\n  * Stats for different timeframes: Lifetime, last 30 days, last 90 days etc\n  * Various sorting criteria (score, voting power, voting pct, forum activity)\n  * Onchain endorsements by peer delegates\n  * Updates to the scoring logic if needed (Based on community feedback)\n  * Software maintenance and keeping data updated on daily basis\n\n**Research to set the DAO up for long-term success**\n\n* Research a partial delegation solution so that token holders can delegate to more than one address.\n* Research a solution for shielded onchain voting so that large delegate voting does not influence other voters during the voting or election period. Ensure that this solution applies to Security Council elections.\n\n## [](#timeline-6)Timeline\n\nResearch and Design: 0.5 months\n\nDevelopment: 2 months\n\nTesting, audit, and deployment (includes DAO proposal): 2 months\n\n**Total:** 4.5 months\n\n## [](#overall-cost-7)Overall Cost\n\nImprove the proposal process: $120,000 USD in ARB&#x20;\n\nUpgrade Governor contracts: $50,000 USD in ARB (100% will go to Scopelift)&#x20;\n\nHighlight delegate contributions: $40,000 USD in ARB&#x20;\n\n* Tally: $20,000 USD in ARB\n* Karma: $20,000 USD in ARB\n\nResearch to set the DAO up for long-term success: $10,000 USD in ARB&#x20;\n\n*The price of ARB at the time of onchain proposal creation was used to determine the amount of ARB to include in the transactions in this proposal.*\n\n**Total:** $220,000 USD in ARB\n\n*special thanks to the DAO Ops Excellence team at GovHack who helped moved this proposal forward* [@shawn16400](/u/shawn16400)\\*\\* [@hiringdevs.eth](/u/hiringdevs.eth) [@hung-vu](/u/hung-vu) [@cbxm](/u/cbxm)",

      "title": "Empowering Early Contributors: The community Arbiter Proposal 2.0",
      "content": "**Summary:** This proposal proposes to allocate 125,000 $ARB tokens, equal to 0.00125% of the total supply, to recognize and reward the outstanding contributions of the Arbitrum community member known as \"Arbiter\". Arbiter receives the arbiter community role in the arbitrum discord after having made significant contributions to Arbitrum, as recognized by members of the Arbitrum team.\n\nOver the three-year period 2021-2023, these contributors played a key role in the development of Arbitrum, from translating, advising, publicizing, and docking projects to community support, fraud prevention, and docking activities etc. At the time of the Arbitrum DAO's inception, Arbiters did not receive any airdrops or rewards.\n\nBy establishing a transparent and fair reward system through the Arbitrum DAO, our goal is to recognize past contributions and inspire continued dedication to the development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Considering that arbiters did not keep proof of their contributions before and after the establishment of the Arbitrum DAO, and that a great deal of their work could not be counted or quantified, the dedication of each arbiter is also exceptionally valuable.\n\nAll members of arbiters unanimously agreed to initiate the proposal as a whole and agreed on an equal share of the reward amount.\n\n**Foreword:** 25 Arbiters come from different countries with different time zones, speak different languages. Arbiters have been deprecated by the Arbitrum team, and it has become extremely difficult to bring arbiters together. Arbiters who have made outstanding contributions to the Arbitrum community from 2021 to 2023. Compared to on-chain activists and ecosystem projects which have conducted a large number of airdrops, arbiters haven’t received any airdrop retroactive rewards\n\nConsidering the large number of contributions made by arbiters prior to the establishment of the Arbitrum DAO that have not been effectively preserved, and the fact that there are many members whose work cannot be counted and quantified, and that the dedication of each arbiter has been exceptionally valuable, all members of the arbiters have agreed that arbiters as a whole should initiate the proposal. All members of Arbiters unanimously agreed to initiate the proposal and apply for retroactive awards for Arbiters as a whole.\n\nArbiter as a whole (or project) is asking for retroactive rewards. If each member's contribution is listed one by one to make a forced comparison, this will bring arbiter infinite tug-of-war, mutual disputes, suspicion etc.. At the same time, Arbiter is not professional to establish a very systematic and perfect evaluation system.\n\nSpecial statement: As the earliest arbitrum contributor, arbiter is retroactively obtaining voting rights and voice in the governance of Arbitrum DAO. The Arbitrum DAO airdrop to early adopters and ecosystem projects also does not take price into account, but rather the weight of governance. The choice of 125,000 $ARB is fully considered (explained in detail below). If the current arb price is $0.1, the arbiter also only apply for 125,000 $ARB, which has little to do with price.\n\n**Motivation:** The Arbitrum community thrives on collaboration, decentralization, and the Ethereum community spirit. This proposal aligns with these principles and strives to:\n\n1.Recognize the exceptional contributions made by Arbiters to Arbitrum’s development.\n\n2.Demonstrate the spirit of collaboration and decentralization within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring its long-term sustainability.\n\n3.Establish a clear and equitable reward mechanism through the Arbitrum DAO, ensuring that Arbiters are treated fairly.\n\n4.Inspire more individuals to actively participate in the advancement of the Arbitrum ecosystem by retroactively rewarding Arbiters.\n\n**Rationale:** The Arbitrum community, driven by its contributors, has been instrumental in shaping Arbitrum over the past two years. These dedicated individuals have contributed significantly through a wide range of activities, including translation, promotion, event organization, community guidance, safety assurance, and collaboration with other communities. These efforts have been essential to the success and vibrancy of the Arbitrum community.\n\nPlease review the forum post for full proposal details: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-empowering-early-contributors-the-community-arbiter-proposal-2-0/20404",

      "title": "Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program",
      "content": "TL;DR : This proposal aims to support the budding RWA ecosystem on Arbitrum by diversifying 35 million ARB from our treasury into assets that are stable in value with minimal volatility, liquid in conversion and provide yield uncorrelated to crypto markets that is at least commensurate with the so called \"risk free rate of return\" of US Treasuries (hereby called ‘stable RWAs’)\n\nThis proposal is a trial run for a larger investment policy of the ArbitrumDAO treasury, both in\n\n1. Creating a legal and infrastructural pipeline that future diversification proposals can take guidance from and\n2. Proof of concept that we can diversify our treasury in a way that supports ecosystem growth\n\nThis is NOT a grant; it is an investment that Arbitrum governance can exercise control over and recall, subject to agreed-upon conditions with successful applicants.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Stable Treasury Endowment Program (STEP) is the first proposal floated by the Treasury WG before the DAO. We are targeting stable RWAs backed by t-bills or money market instruments as the 1st step towards larger treasury diversification for several reasons\n\n1. Our conversations with RWA protocols on Arbitrum indicate that they do not want grants so much as legitimate customers of their product. Another way of looking at STEP is as an ecosystem growth program for the RWA vertical on Arbitrum, with the added advantage that it’s in the form of an investment we earn yield from and can recall at anytime, rather than a grant. More generally, stable RWAs have an attractive risk-reward ratio for Arbitrum in terms of sectors we should be nurturing. The total US treasury market is over $20 trillion, some of which is expected to come onchain to satisfy demand from wealthy investors. As the home of De-Fi, we should not cede space to [Base](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/12/12/coinbase-debuts-rwa-platform-built-on-base-under-abu-dhabi-regulators-oversight/) or [Mantle](https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth/proposal/0x26884fce58b66e82fa74735a2e255f76654618278432897f4ca2430702e95dcd) that have their own RWA support programs.&#x20;\n2. The stable coins we use today in De-Fi are mostly backed by t-bill RWAs. Creating our own exposure can increase capital efficiency and mitigate risk. Although protocols on Arbitrum and governance might wish to hold stable RWAs, they are limited by having to conduct due diligence on providers they can trust. This proposal creates a qualified  committee that evaluates applicants and prepares an Assessment Report on them, providing a roster of vetted service providers that anyone can use for investing assets into RWAs on Arbitrum.&#x20;\n\nIn conclusion, we expect that lessons learned from implementation of this proposal can pave the way for a new form of an ecosystem support program, where the ArbitrumDAO supports projects not with grants but purchases of financial products built on our chain that also diversify our treasury holdings.\n\n### Timeline and Procedure\n\n1. Snapshot temperature check ([COMPLETE](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x5050ef61a4cbff56344ad558c2c880b547fef3b81df607818238ed3031f840b3))\n2. Screening committee publishes RFP with specific information requested from applicants and minimum criteria they must satisfy to be considered (COMPLETE)\n3. Onchain Tally vote (March 20th to April 3rd)\n4. Receive applications from service providers (submission window April 5th to May 5th );\n5. Committee reviews each application, and where needed, conduct additional due diligence and research (May 5th to June 5th)\n6. Snapshot vote for approval of recommended allocations between service providers (June 20th)\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n1. The Arbitrum foundation will act as the legal entity and face the service provider during the KYC process. They shall also hold any tokens/NFTs received in exchange of investments and have authority to withdraw assets from the service provider should any risks be discovered; however an explanation for the same shall be posted on the forum within 3 days of taking such an action. They will also periodically sweep interest earned from these assets to our treasury. Fire Drills will be periodically conducted to test solvency and clear out any AML delays in returning investments\n2. Interest earned from RWAs will be swept to our treasury for increasing our bridged USDC holdings (currently at 10 cents). For reference, $20 million in t-bills currently returns roughly $1 million in annual interest. Delay of more than 60 days in returning interest earned will result in liquidation of an investment from a service provider.\n3. Proposals to utilize interest earned will follow the same process as requesting funds from the treasury\n4. The committee will comprise of 6 members: Karpatkey, GFX Labs Steakhouse Financial, Nethermind and North Lake Legal, & the Treasury WG acting as facilitator and tie-breaking vote\n   * **Karpatkey** is a DeFi-native organisation specialising in professional DAO finance through industry-leading research and tooling since 2020. We’ve been working with GnosisDAO, Balancer, ENS, CoW Protocol, and Lido on financial planning, operations, and strategy, diversifying their treasuries into sustainable portfolios of DeFi investments designed to support DAOs in executing their missions.\n   * **GFX Labs** is the leading provider of professional governance services in DeFi. We are most known for our extensive past and present contributions at Uniswap, MakerDAO, Compound, and Optimism. GFX focuses on operational improvements and improving organizational quality and structure, with strong relevant experience in real-world asset onboarding and stablecoins.\n   * **Steakhouse Financial** is the leading CFO-as-a-service consulting company for DAOs. We specialize in stablecoins and RWAs. Our team has been merging TradFi and DeFi for years – our team met as contributors to the Strategic Finance Core Unit at MakerDAO. We’ve contributed extensively to asset-liability management research and structuring MakerDAOs RWA portfolio, including its exposure to treasuries. We specialize in deep due-diligence reports of tokenized issuers and publish the leading research report and Dune dashboards covering the space <https://dune.com/steakhouse/tokenized-securities>\n   * **Nethermind** is a blockchain research and software engineering company empowering enterprises and developers worldwide to work with and build upon decentralized systems. Our work touches every part of the Web3 ecosystem, from fundamental cryptography research to security, node infrastructure, DeFi, and application-layer protocol development. We have a team of over 220, with more than 180 engineers on board. Nethermind is a key contributor to the development of Ethereum, with our execution client representing over a quarter of all synced nodes. Additionally, we actively build the Starknet ecosystem and support our institutional and enterprise partners in advanced blockchain, digital assets, and decentralized finance (DeFi) fields.\n   * **North Lakes Legal** is a law firm at the leading edge of bridging decentralized finance, DAOs and Real World Assets. North Lakes Legal implemented the standards for the initial high-profile real- world asset (“RWA”) financings in the DeFi space. Christian Petersen is the principal of North Lakes Legal and has 26 years of cross border project and structured finance experience. In support of Maker DAO, North Lakes Legal has structured, negotiated, and implemented the following:\n     * Société Generale – DAI 40 million, tokenized French covered bonds\n     * Huntingdon Valley Bank – DAI 100 million vault to acquire RWA loan participations\n     * BlockTower Credit – DAI 150 million vault utilizing Tinlake for various RWAs\n     * Monetalis Clydesdale – DAI 500 million to acquire U.S. treasury ETF\n     * Most recently, North Lakes Legal advised Ondo Finance in the development, structuring and launch of Ondo USDY.\n   * [**Arbitrum Treasury WG**](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-treasury-and-sustainability-working-group/18978) as a facilitating, nonvoting member except in case of a tie.\n5. The Assessment Report prepared by the committee will contain a recommended division of the sanctioned amount between service providers, which the DAO can approve or reject via Snapshot vote. Other details in the Assessment Report include schedule for returning interest, relationship with Arbitrum (debtor or custodian), maturation period of asset, legal structure (bankruptcy remote assessment), solvency, Arbitrum alignment, turnaround time for returning investment, transparency level (proof of reserves/read only access to accounts), and fees charged.\n6. 300,000 ARB for implementation of this proposal; unused funds returned to treasury\n\nAnticipated expenditures include\n\n* 150,000 ARB between 6 committee members (25k ARB per committee member is equivalent to the LTIPP Grants Council members)\n* 50,000 ARB to the Arbitrum Foundation for payment of outside legal counsel\n* 100,000 ARB for additional due diligence required by the committee and to program manager for management oversight and monitoring of selected providers.\n  **Candidates for STEP Program Manager will be selected by a vote of the** [**procurement committee**](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-establish-the-arbitrumdao-procurement-committee/20064), valid for a period of one year, after which they need to return to the DAO for a vote on paying their retainer fees. In case they do not get approval and there is no program manager overseeing our investments, the Arbitrum Foundation will liquidate and return assets to the treasury\n\nDuties of the program manager in the pre-allocation phase, for which we received a quotation of $1000 per application, include:\n\n1. Receiving applications from service providers\n2. Conduct a first pass on applications received; filter out incomplete applications or those not fitting the RFP\n3. After the committee reviews valid applications and shortlists eligible providers, prepare an assessment report on each provider that allows for easy comparison between them\n\nPost allocation duties, for which we received a quotation of $100,000 per year plus $15k for every selected provider, include;\n\n**1. Cashflow & Accrual Monitoring:** Enable the Arbitrum Foundation to easily ensure that the Arbitrum Treasury receives timely payments or accruals.

Supplementary\n\n**Summary and Arbitrum info**\n\n**Introduction**\nArbitrum governance is seeking proposals from qualified applicants for the purposes of diversifying the governance treasury and supporting ecosystem growth.\n\nThe purpose of the RFP is to identify products that provide trading volume and depth (i.e., liquidity), are stable in value, produce income for governance independent of crypto market volatility, offer transparency, and can potentially see use in developing a nascent “real-world assets” sector on Arbitrum chains.\n\nApplicants whose products meet certain quality thresholds will be presented to ARB holders and their delegates for possible asset allocation. All final asset allocation decisions rest with ARB holders and their representatives. This RFP is intended to both collect relevant information for the committee and also to recommend allocations for tokenholders to vote upon.\n\n**Requester background**\n\nArbitrum governance maintains and upgrades the Arbitrum technology stack, upon which are built multiple blockchains, including the largest Layer 2 on Ethereum, with more than $2.8b in assets onchain.\n\n**Description**\n\n**Asset information**\n\nThis program is intended to convert 35,000,000 ARB into stable, liquid and yield earning assets. The dollar notional amount of this investment is subject to market volatility, but at the time of February 9, 2024, is valued at approximately $66,000,000. These assets do not have a specific futured obligation or liability they are matched against. The Arbitrum Foundation, a Cayman Islands legal entity, will be the transacting counterparty.\n\n**Oversight**\n\nThe committee is comprised of 6 members including GFX Labs, Steakhouse Financial, Karpatkey, Nethermind, and North Lakes Legal. The Arbitrum Treasury & Sustainability Working Group also serves as a non-voting member of the committee, except in the case of ties.\n\nAll members are required to recuse themselves for any application in which they have a monetary interest, direct or indirect.\n\nThe Arbitrum Treasury & Sustainability Working Group leads this process, and answers to stakeholders within Arbitrum governance.\n\n**Scope of service/criteria**\n\nPlease include the following as part of your proposal:\nSample or template investment contract and the governing instrument (credit agreement, partnership agreement, etc.).\nInvestment selection, monitoring, and reporting plan.\nCompliance requirements. Be specific about requirements you anticipate from Arbitrum governance.\n\n**RFP process overview**\n\n**RFP Timeline**\n\nRFP published : March 15\nSubmissions open : April 1\nSubmissions deadline : May 1\nFinalists announced : June 1\nARB holders vote on proposed allocation : June 15\n\n**Participants**\n\nThis RFP will be open to all applicants with a stable, liquid and yield earning product. The screening committee will review all submissions and announce allocation between finalists for ARB tokenholders to vote upon.\n\nAfter receiving applications, the committee will prepare an allocation policy for distribution to applicants and recommend a split between them. The DAO will then vote on whether to approve the split or not.\n\n**Questionnaire**\n\nApplicant information\n\nName\n\nAddress (Headquarters)\n\nCity, State, Postal Code\n\nCountry\n\nWebsite\n\nPrimary contact\nName\n\nTitle\n\nCountry\n\nEmail, Telegram, Forum, & other methods of contact\n\n**Key Information**\n\nExpected Yield\n\nExpected Maturity\n\nUnderlying asset\n\nMinimum/Maximum transaction size\n\nCurrent AUM for product\n\nCurrent AUM for issuer\n\nVolume of transactions LTM\n\nSource of first-loss capital\n\n**Basics and background**\n\n1.

      "title": "Double-Down on STIP Successes (STIP-Bridge) ",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis proposal introduces the STIP Bridge, aiming to sustain and enhance Arbitrum's market leadership by extending support to key protocols amidst intense competition from other Layer 2 solutions. \n\nIt serves as a strategic interim solution, maintaining incentive alignment and ensuring continuous engagement of vital projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem until the Perpetual Incentives Program is initiated.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem is currently facing unprecedented competitive pressures, with significant incentive programs launched by rival Layer 2 networks threatening to attract our established protocols away. \n\nThe STIP Bridge is crucial for retaining these integral projects, ensuring they remain committed to Arbitrum by providing timely, targeted incentives. This initiative is essential to preserve network growth, user engagement, and overall ecosystem stability in a highly dynamic market environment.\n\n## Rationale\n\nAligning with Arbitrum's mission to support and nurture its development community, the STIP Bridge embodies our commitment to our builders and their contributions. It strategically addresses the imminent risk of losing key ecosystem participants to competitors by offering a seamless transition in incentive support. This approach not only retains critical projects and liquidity within Arbitrum but also sets a solid foundation for the impending comprehensive Perpetual Incentives Program, reinforcing our long-term vision of innovation and community empowerment.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Eligibility\n\n* Any protocol funded under STIP is eligible to apply for a bridge grant coinciding with the LTIPP distribution window.\n* This will allow Arbitrum to ensure protocols that had success during the STIP campaign can retain their users and continue to focus on building on Arbitrum.\n\n## Maximum Funding Size:\n\nMaximum funding requests under this bridge grant are capped based on a percentage of the prior funding received under STIP:\n\n* Greater than 500k ARB: may make a funding request of up to 50% of their prior funding.\n* Less than or equal to 500k ARB: may make funding requests up to 100% of their prior funding, capped at 250k ARB.\n\n## Addendum on STIP Forum post:\n\nAfter applying with an addendum on the respective project’s original STIP forum post, projects will be included in a list of all extension applicants. Specifically, a project should add the tag “STIP Bridge” to the end of their forum post. The addendum is intended to be relatively lightweight, not requiring a full STIP type proposal but should still include:\n\n* Requested amount (protocols have the option to size down their asks if they deem it more appropriate, including to help secure the support of delegates).\n* Data on the performance of their activities during STIP.\n* If the intended use of incentives is different than STIP, then details of the updated usage.\n* Links to bi-weekly STIP performance reports and Openblocks Dashboard.\n\n## Voting and Approval Mechanism:\n\n### Optimistic Approach\n\nAn optimistic voting mechanism will be used to mitigate the potential for delegate fatigue from voting on 50+ proposals while still holding projects accountable for their overall performance within STIP and in general.\n\nThis optimistic model hopes to reduce the load on all delegates but ensure that the DAO's full attention is placed on the more contentious proposals.\n\n### Voting Mechanism\n\nThe current snapshot and the immediately subsequent Tally vote will earmark funds to allow the DAO to distribute up to the maximum permissible grants.\n\nAfter applying with an addendum on the respective project's original STIP forum post, all properly submitted projects will be included in a list of extension applicants for consideration to be funded.\n\nDuring the challenge review period, any delegate with at least 500K ARB delegated can put up a forum post and an associated snapshot proposal that will result in a full DAO vote for the individual grant streams for it to be approved.  \n\nDelegates may seek a full DAO vote at their own discretion if they believe that a project did (a) not fulfill their STIP requirements, (b) failed to deliver tangible results during the STIP period or (c) the amount sought in the bridge application would not result in an effective utilization of the DAO’s funds.\n\nThis will allow the DAO delegates to focus their available attention to more closely examine contested applications. To be accepted into the bridge program alongside the unchallenged proposals, the proposal to fund must receive a supermajority (66%) of votes in favor.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\n* Send funds to STIP multisig\n* Create an addendum template for applicants\n* Have applicants post addendums\n* Conduct DAO challenge vote on Snapshot\n* Conduct individual Snapshot votes for any challenged application\n* Have successful applicants complete compliance\n* Start streams at the same time as LTIPP protocols\n* Monitored incentives throughout the program as done in STIP\n\n# Timeline\n\nThis is a rough timeline. We aim to start the STIP Bridge at the same time as LTIPP.\n\n* Week 1 (March 11 - 17)\n  * Posted to Governance Forum\n  * If requested, Community Call including discussion of Voting Mechanism\n* Week 2 (March 22 - 29)\n  * Snapshot Vote for the creation of Bridge Program\n* Week 3\n  * Tally Vote for establishing funding to LTIPP or community multisig (17 days)\n  * Start of 2-week window for protocols to submit addendums, protocols are encouraged but not obligated to submit early to allow delegates time to review\n* Week 4\n  * Continue addendum submissions\n* Week 5\n  * One week Optimistic Approval / Challenge Vote Period\n* Week 6\n  * Tally vote ends (17 days)\n  * Review and discussion period of remaining protocols not cleared in Optimistic / Challenge voting\n  * Vote on remaining contested applicants\n* Week 6\n  * STIP.b & LTIPP incentives start at the same time\n\n# Overall Cost\n\n\n## Incentives Budget: \n37,025,522 ARB\nSee estimated amounts [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ic15cTQNoa6xyIJcp-X8OC175MaCLMPrXtMW5eT87sI/edit#gid=1867228162)\n\nThe incentives budget above is the maximum allocation earmarked, any extra funds not used due to ineligible asks, projects not applying, or other reasons returned to the multisig. \n\n### Overhead: 0M ARB\n\n\n* Assumed to be the same data provider and multisig as STIP without added cost.\n* Analytics: This proposal should result in no material increase in work for the analytics vendor, given that the same team already covers STIP protocols, was mandated for making dashboards for the same, and is mandated for the entire time of LTIPP. Additionally, the multisig signing can be done at the same time as other disbursements or will use oSnap reducing the need for multi-sig signing.\n* If there is an objection, a volunteer multisig from the DAO will be assembled and community grants can be allocated by the LTIPP special grants for taking over the existing dashboards from STIP, as they are open source and IP rights if any already resides with the DAO.\n\n## Proposers:\nIncludes some proposers and developers of both STIP round 1, Backfund, LTIP and an LTIP Council member. \nAlex Lumley of SavvyDao, Dan Peng of Vela Exchange, CoinflipCanada of GMX",

      "title": "[Non-constitutional] Proposal to fund Plurality Labs Milestone 1B(ridge)",
      "content": "## Introduction\n\nBack in August, Arbitrum DAO passed our AIP-3 to build a pluralistic grants framework that decentralizes grants decision-making, avoids capture and scales valuable grants allocations, and grows the Arbitrum ecosystem overall.\n\nOur proposal [passed on Tally](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-3-non-constitutional-fund-the-arbitrum-grants-framework-proposal-milestone-1/14976) with ~99% of delegate votes. It had overwhelming support, we believe, because you a) trust our motives and capabilities, and b) understand how big and important the problem is:\n\nNearly every DAO struggles to create sustainable value - largely because DAO decision-making is famously slow, and inefficient, which drives them to compromise their values and centralize. Arbitrum is committed to being better, and you believed in our ability to help.\n\n## Background (Milestone 1a Retrospective)\n\nAcross Milestones 1a, we pluralistically deployed funds via 12 different grants programs and different modalities for grants decision-making.\n\nExperimenting with multiple modalities allows us to allocate grants to support quick feedback about what works and can scale now. We can quickly evolve our grants decision making based the below success rubric, which determines where to allocate grants:\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/19f2561a1ec3653e1dbc41d5a646874c679c4d6a_2_621x415.jpeg)\n\n* Grow = double-down / start to scale\n* Coach = make changes / try again\n* Cut = discontinue / recommend to seed program\n\nIn Milestone 1a, we seeded the initial 12 Grants Programs. In Milestone 1b, we will lean on our newly established Plurality Labs board (more later!) as well as community voices who can evaluate our grants via our Thrive Protocol to inform where to cut, coach, and grow.\n\n\\[Based on our pluralistic grants framework and success criteria, these are the current results of milestone 1 ([details here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/plurality-labs-milestone-1-review/20198/2?u=senad.eth))]\n\n### Milestone 1a Wins include:\n\n* Firestarters: Four proposals passed Snapshot because of our Firestarters program - which funds unbiased research, cat herding, and crafting of proposals crucial to the DAO. These include STIP, ARDC, ARPC, and STEP. ([TNorm talking about our role with STIP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pAiy5IABZ48b0o-NqVIRcu4_NRuM9vzI/view?usp=sharing))\n* Experimenting with Grants Decision-Making Modalities: We drove over 30 experiments in collective decision-making, including proactive and retroactive grant-making, and grant-making driven by experts, expert-counsels, permissionless counsels, random counsels, and direct input mechanisms.\n* Retroactive Grants: We drove the first retroactive grants program in Arbitrum, rewarding unpaid contributors, and setting the stage for follow-on experiments. Some of these people are creating obvious value in the ecosystem now, like Atom from castlecap who is now an LTIPP advisor.\n* Quadratic Funding: Via Gitcoin, we brought thousands of new users, and hundreds of builders and builder projects to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n### Milestone 1a Lessons:\n\n* Investing in documentation: We funded 250+ projects, and spurred movement all over the DAO. But we didn’t document our work and value well. More importantly, we didn’t deliver certain written deliverables that people in the DAO were expecting on time. It hurt us. We won’t make that mistake again.\n* Investing in communications: Our bias was for action. We cared about creating value and learning - and put blinders on for everything else. We should have hired a Marketing or Comms person. We didn’t. Going forward, we’ll button up. We have a good story to tell. We’re excited to tell it.\n* Leveraging internal team: Plurality Labs was acquired by ThriveCoin in August of 2023. We have a team of 26 people who support other big ecosystems. We could have leveraged Thrive best practices. But in an effort to stay “true” to the Milestone 1 proposal, we kept the teams separate - too separate. We’ll use all available resources this time.\n\n### Vision\n\nWe have a big vision. We’re seeking to build the most robust pluralistic grants ecosystem in DAO history. To do it, we took some big shots on goal in Milestone 1a - funding 12 grant programs using 30 decision making experiments to fund 250+ projects. Some shots scored and others missed.\n\nThis is aligned with the expectations of the pluralistic grants approach. The only way to create and scale pluralistic grants is to decentralize bet taking… and to get as comfortable with the shots that embarrassingly fly into the stands as we are with the goals.\n\nWe will use data to help us double-down on winners and cut others. With the data we’re collecting, we will create a robust, long-term pluralistic grants framework for Arbitrum DAO. This framework is emerging now, and it will continue to become clearer throughout Milestone 1b(ridge).\n\n## Milestone 1(bridge):\n\nIn our maiden proposal, the principal outcome we sought to achieve was to demonstrate that we could deliver and scale enormous value creation via a pluralistic grants framework. The general feedback from delegates has been: kind of…\n\nThere seems to be wide agreement that we created value but need to scale,  document, and showcase.\n\nThus, after consultation with a number of the top delegates, we created this Milestone 1b(ridge) proposal that asks for the exact same amount of ARB and same timeframe as passed with 99% of delegate vote in August.\n\nIn Milestone 1b, we will show:\n\n1. We can build on winners and cut underperformers with our initial grants allocations.\n2. We can continue to drive experimentation with new grants allocations.\n3. We can deliver on all deliverables for Milestone 1 to the satisfaction of our top delegates.\n4. We can leverage better tech and systems to support further scale in Milestone 2.\n\nTo ensure we achieve these goals, we are implementing best-practices from the Thrive team that, also, are aligned with feedback we received from delegates:\n\n1. Plurality Labs Board: We are welcoming a board of top voices in the Arbitrum community for oversight, and to ensure decentralized decision-making.\n2. Human validations: Thrive Protocol allows us to validate when value is created, and pay out funds to projects upon value creation. This is critical for scale. We’ll use it.\n3. Team upgrade: We are bringing in the big guns for this one, adding team members that know grants, know DAOs, and know scale.\n\nHere’s more information about our commitments in Milestone 1b(ridge):\n\nPlurality Labs Board: We brought together trusted and known voices in the Arbitrum community. Their role with us is to gather feedback and data from our Arbitrum community, and to make strategic decisions about grants allocators, specific grants / contributions, and validations.\n\nThis board is part of this vote. We found people to represent the different stakeholder groups in Arbitrum. Now your votes will ratify this group - which includes two who voted \"No\" to our temp check for Milestone 2!\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/81db971f7a5e9910d522a44171d3f3625bffb3cb_2_936x702.jpeg)\n\nHuman Validations: Going forward, we will fund our grants at specific milestones of value creation. White-listed Arbitrum community members will - in a pluralistic way - help clarify when value is created, and will also be rewarded for their services (more on this later).\n\nTeam revamp: We are fully utilizing our 26-person ThriveCoin team), we have also added some key team members to our roster, including: Ben West (GitCoin grants lead), Kyler Wandler (DAO Research Collective), and Scott Mandel (Complex Labs, Flexa, 2Q Ventures).\n\n## Cost\n\nAs aligned with the feedback we’ve received from delegates and community members, we made this proposal easy: The total cost and timeframe are the same as the first proposal: 3.36M ARB and 6 months, with 336k ARB to Plurality Labs and 224k ARB to program management, as in the first proposal.\n\n2.8M ARB will be funding ecosystem development, including demonstrating that we can create incrementally more value with our emerging pluralistic grants framework. We are also adding a layer of oversight to our work - welcoming an esteemed Plurality Labs board. They will, among other things, help ensure we deliver the value we promise.\n\nThe 560k ARB services fee (same ARB and same buckets as first proposal) includes:\n\nAs aligned with the feedback we’ve received from delegates and community members, we made this proposal easy: The total cost and timeframe are the same as the first proposal: 3.36M ARB and 6 months, with 336k ARB to Plurality Labs and 224k ARB to program management, as in the first proposal.\n\n2.8M ARB will be funding ecosystem development, including demonstrating that we can create incrementally more value with our emerging pluralistic grants framework.

If we do our work right (and we believe we’re on the right track) we should be spurring thriving, net-positive ecosystem activity in Arbitrum for years to come.\n\nAdditionally, we’ll be doing it via a pluralistic grants framework that has a consistent bias for value creation, further decentralization, and resistance to capture. We will be building the future of web3 together, and providing a path for all great people and teams to work with Arbitrum.\n\nWhen the value of Milestone 1b is obvious, we’ll present Milestone 2.",

      "title": "Expand Tally Support for the Arbitrum DAO",
      "content": "## Constitutional / Non-Constitutional\n\nNon-Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\n\nTally has contributed to the Arbitrum DAO as a service provider since the DAO was created one year ago, serving as the home for [onchain governance](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum), [security council elections](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/council/security-council/election/0/round-2), and [delegation](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates). We’ve gathered feedback about how we can improve our support for Arbitrum through many conversations over the past year with DAO stakeholders including delegates, contributors, and Foundation representatives. We propose to expand our support for the Arbitrum DAO by improving the proposal process, upgrading the Governor contracts, and highlighting delegate contributions. We also propose to ensure that the DAO is set up for success by researching specifications for partial delegation and shielded voting.\n\n## Motivation\n\nArbitrum is the largest and most decentralized DAO in the world. Tally is highly invested in the success of both the Arbitrum DAO specifically and the Arbitrum community as a whole. We have a strong track record as an Arbitrum governance service provider, [ecosystem builder](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tally-final-stip-round-1/17557), and [delegate](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegate/0xfrisson.eth). Tally continuously ships improvements for the Arbitrum DAO, including [transfer actions](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1732425795262714363?s=20), [improved Safe support](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1714647532423561257?s=20), [proposal collaboration](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1743325532786168149?s=20), and the [nominee selection stage](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-changes-to-the-constitution-and-the-security-council-election-process/20856/9?u=frisson) of Security Council elections. This proposal would enable us to invest more resources into the Arbitrum DAO and scale up our impact.\n\nThe majority of the improvements outlined in this proposal are specific to Arbitrum's unique implementation of onchain governance and will not be re-used in other DAOs. We are long-term partners to the Arbitrum DAO who plan to continue investing specifically in making Arbitrum governance great. \n\n## Rationale\n\nThis proposal contributes to Arbitrum [Community Values](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values) by making the Arbitrum DAO more socially inclusive, technically inclusive, and user-focused. Our proposed improvements make it easier for contributors of all backgrounds and technical abilities to engage with Arbitrum governance.\n\n## Specifications and Steps to Implement\n\nWe propose to expand our support for the Arbitrum DAO by improving the proposal process, upgrading the Governor contracts, and highlighting delegate contributions. We also propose to ensure that the DAO is set up for success by developing a specification for partial delegation and shielded voting.\n\n**Improve the proposal process** \n*Watch a demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yORl1yZPt7Q) - note that this demo is designed to provide a general overview of the user experience. It is not a final design.*\n\n* Link forum proposal posts and Tally proposals so that delegates can create Tally proposals from forum posts, see forum proposal comments directly on Tally, and be updated by a Tally Discourse bot when onchain proposals are created.\n  * In order to show posts on the proposal page, Tally would need [Embedding permission](https://meta.discourse.org/t/embed-discourse-comments-on-another-website-via-javascript/31963)\n  * In order to post \"this proposal is now onchain (link)\", the Tally Discourse bot would need an API key with topics.writepermission from https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/admin/api/keys/new\n* Build a diff checker into Tally proposals that shows what text has changed from Snapshot without having to click back over to Snapshot, to help delegates understand any relevant changes from the temp check phase to the onchain governance phase.\n* Enable cancel functionality on Tally proposals so proposal creators can cancel onchain proposals if there are mistakes. (see upgrade Governor contracts section)\n* Develop full proposal execution integration by dynamically showing [each phase of proposal execution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal#the-lifecycle-of-an-arbitrum-improvement-proposal) with accurate time stamps so that contributors and delegates can easily manage proposals through the execution process.\n* Improve support for [late quorum extension](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-glossary#late-quorum-extension) on Tally so onchain proposals are automatically extended on Tally when late quorum extension is triggered.\n* Fully integrate the [quorum of each Governor](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-faqs#what-determines-the-quorum-minimum-votes-required-for-a-governance-proposal) throughout Tally, including on the proposal page and the delegates page so that delegates always know exactly how much voting power is required to reach quorum.\n* Show [Security Council](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/security-council#the-role-of-the-security-council) transactions on the main [Arbitrum DAO page](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum) on Tally so the DAO can easily view actions taken by the Security Council.\n\n**Upgrade Governor contracts**\n*We’re planning to partner with [Scopelift](https://scopelift.co/) to implement the upgrades. Scopelift is the developer of Flexible Voting and has deep experience with high-value governance contract upgrades.*\n\n* Add a [cancel() function](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/92ff025622cdf6694318fc11af1c995236793a77/contracts/governance/Governor.sol#L455-L473) to the Arbitrum DAO’s implementation of OpenZeppelin Governor so proposal creators can cancel onchain proposals if there are mistakes.\n* Add [Flexible Voting](https://github.com/ScopeLift/flexible-voting) to the Arbitrum DAO Governors to enable future innovations like voting from Orbit chains, voting from DeFi contracts, and shielded voting.\n\n**Highlight delegate contributions**\n*Watch a demo video [here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=WY1jQ2tP70U) - note that this demo is designed to provide a general overview of the user experience. It is not a final design.*\n\n* Integrate [Karma’s](https://www.karmahq.xyz/) delegate score and contributor metrics into Tally’s delegate page so token holders and DAO stakeholders have access to holistic participation information. Karma will provide the following via their API:\n  * Onchain and Snapshot voting pct, delegator count, voting power, list of delegators\n  * Stats for different timeframes: Lifetime, last 30 days, last 90 days etc\n  * Various sorting criteria (score, voting power, voting pct, forum activity)\n  * Onchain endorsements by peer delegates\n  * Updates to the scoring logic if needed (Based on community feedback)\n  * Software maintenance and keeping data updated on daily basis\n\n**Research to set the DAO up for long-term success**\n\n* Research a partial delegation solution so that token holders can delegate to more than one address.\n* Research a solution for shielded onchain voting so that large delegate voting does not influence other voters during the voting or election period. Ensure that this solution applies to Security Council elections.\n\n## Timeline\n\nResearch and Design: 0.5 months\n\nDevelopment: 2 months\n\nTesting, audit, and deployment (includes DAO proposal): 2 months\n\n**Total:** 4.5 months\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nImprove the proposal process: $120,000 USD in ARB\n\nUpgrade Governor contracts: $50,000 USD in ARB (100% will go to Scopelift)\n\nHighlight delegate contributions: $40,000 USD in ARB\n\n* Tally: $20,000 USD in ARB\n* Karma: $20,000 USD in ARB\n\nResearch to set the DAO up for long-term success: $10,000 USD in ARB\n\n**Total:** $220,000 USD in ARB\n\n*special thanks to the DAO Ops Excellence team at GovHack who helped moved this proposal forward @shawn16400 @hiringdevs.eth @hung-vu @cbxm*",

      "title": "[Non-Constitutional AIP] Front-end interface to force transaction inclusion during sequencer downtime",
      "content": "### **Abstract**\n\n[WakeUp Labs](http://www.wakeuplabs.io/) proposal outlines the development of a simple but effective front-end interface that enables users to force-include transactions directly on L1 when the Arbitrum Sequencer is down, aiming to increase trust among end-users navigating the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nInspired by a few community discussions ([Link 1](https://x.com/Cattin0x/status/1735779772054077917?s=20) & [Link 2](https://x.com/fede_intern/status/1754226077981893052?s=20)) , and validated historical events like: [Sequencer Downtime 1](https://offchain.medium.com/todays-arbitrum-sequencer-downtime-what-happened-6382a3066fbc), [Sequener Downtime 2](https://dedaub.com/blog/arbitrum-sequencer-outage), [Historical Sequencer Status](https://status.arbitrum.io/history/3) and [L2BEAT status](https://l2beat.com/scaling/risk).\nThis tool aims to empower users with the ability to bypass the Sequencer in situations where it is unavailable or censoring transactions, thus aligning with Arbitrum's vision for progressive decentralization.\n\nWakeUp Labs has a proven track record of expertise in crafting exceptional blockchain tools and infrastructure. Their contributions extend to collaborating on [open-source projects for major DAOs](https://x.com/0xMilton/status/1755972182553899487?s=20), enhancing Ethereum Foundation-funded initiatives, building complex DeFi protocols, SmartContracts and offering a [developer platform](http://www.platform.wakeuplabs.io/) that facilitates robust and scalable API calls for smart contract deployment without requiring Solidity programming skills. (Currently operating even on the Arbitrum blockchain).\n\n### **Introduction**\n\nThe Arbitrum Sequencer is a critical component of the network, responsible for submitting users' transactions to L1.\n\nUnder the current  model, the Sequencer represents a point of failure that, if compromised, could delay or prevent transaction processing.\n\nThere are ways to bypass it, but non-developer users lack that capability.\n\nThis proposal seeks to mitigate such risks by providing a user-friendly alternative transaction submission pathway, thereby enhancing the network's resilience, user autonomy, and their confidence in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n### **Rationale**\n\n- **Decentralization and user empowerment:** By enabling direct L1 transaction submissions, users can circumvent Sequencer outages or censorship, maintaining their ability to transact without interruption. This capability is crucial for ensuring the network's operational integrity and aligns with the principle of progressive decentralization.\n- **Enhancing trustless security:** The proposed interface would serve as a valuable tool in rare situations where the Sequencer fails to perform its duties. It ensures that the Arbitrum Rollup maintains its trustless security model, even when permissioned components of the system are not functioning correctly.\n\n### **WakeUp Labs core team**\n\n- **[Milton Berman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miltonberman/)**, co-founder and CEO, brings extensive experience as a CTO in a decentralized identity project supported by IDB Lab and Bitcoin NGO. He has also worked as a Product Owner at Rootstock blockchain and as a CTO in a mobile game studio company. With a background in working with large corporations, Milton possesses the technical expertise and strategic vision necessary to drive the success of our project.\n- **[Maximiliano del Hoyo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximiliandh/)**, co-founder and CBDO, has a diverse background in software and finance. His previous experience at notable companies like Microsoft and Nestle provides him with the necessary knowledge and network to navigate the intersection of technology and business, ensuring the effective achievement of the project's goals.\n- **[Gonzalo Silman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gonzalo-silman/)**, co-founder and COO, possesses a unique blend of expertise in economics (former university professor), finance, and entrepreneurial experience in creating gaming products for LATAM communities. This diverse background brings a fresh perspective and innovative thinking to our project, enabling us to understand user needs and craft tailored solutions that resonate with our target audience.\n\n### **Proposal Details**\n\n### Technical Implementation\n\n1. **Transaction Monitoring:** Develop functionality to listen for user transactions on L2 that are not included by the Sequencer, with guidance from the Arbitrum SDK documentation.\n2. **Manual Transaction Hash Input:** In cases where automatic detection is not feasible, provide a user interface for manually entering the transaction hash or implement manually the previous transaction in the new solution.\n3. **L1 Transaction Replication:** Implement mechanisms to replicate the intended L2 transaction on L1, using \"Forced Withdrawal\" type transactions to push the L2 transaction from L1.\n4. **Confirmation Display:** Ensure the interface provides feedback once the transaction has successfully been processed.\n5. **Processing Time Consideration:** Account for the approximately 24-hour processing period to prevent errors or transaction duplication across chains.\n6. **Hosting, Service & Maintenance:** WakeUp will host the service, ensuring it runs 24/7. For the first three months, we will fine-tune and iterate the service. Additionally, should any problems occur, the WakeUp team is committed to identifying and resolving these issues for a minimum of the next two years.\n\n### Development Roadmap & Budget Allocation:\n\n1. **Technical Research, POC, Documentation and Testing (3 weeks, $ARB 9000):**\nDeep dive into the Delayed Inbox functionality and its integration, along with creating a PoC and validating the necessity of a new internal tool for transaction monitoring and sequencer status. We will also carefully check that our solution doesn't disrupt the proper functioning of Arbitrum; if it does, we will enable this instance only when the official sequencer is not operating correctly. This research conducted by the WakeUp Team will be made public, and the community will be able to view it, both in a summary Twitter Thread and in an Article shared on the OSS Github repository once completed.\n2. **Endpoint Development (1.5 weeks, $ARB 3500):**\nCreation of endpoints to interact with the backend logic.\n3. **Logic Integration and Testing (2 weeks, $ARB 3500):**\nConnecting the frontend to the endpoints and verifying the operational logic, and test heavily the MVP.\n4. **Design Phase (4 weeks, $ARB 5000):**\nAdditional time allocated for the design process, ensuring a user-friendly experience.\n5. **UI Development (3 weeks, $ARB 5500):**\nCrafting an aesthetic and intuitive user interface inspired by existing high-quality designs.\n6. **Open-source Preparation (3 weeks, $ARB 6000):**\nFinalizing and documenting the codebase for open-source release.\n7. **Service & Maintenance after Launch (24 months, $ARB 10000).**\nWe commit to hosting the site on Vercel or AWS, ensuring 24/7 operation for at least 24 months. Initially, the WakeUp team will refine the website based on user and Arbitrum community feedback and conduct continuous testing to ensure its reliability. Any issues, such as downtime or crashes, will be promptly addressed by the WakeUp team at least for the next two years.\n\n### **Budget and Resources**\n\n- **Estimated Timeframe:** Approximately 4.25 months for full implementation, including design phases; followed by 3 months dedicated to post-launch iterations and 24 months of hosting, monitoring, and bug fixing to address any possible error.\n- **Development Team:** One full-time Sr Solidity developer for the core implementation and Research, additional design and developer resources for the UI/UX phase. The proposal also considers a Sr part-time dev for the Maintenance after launch.\nGonzalo or Milton from the core team will also keep track of the project as PO.\n- **Cost Estimate:** 42.500 $ARB\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nDeveloping a front-end interface to enable force-including transactions during Sequencer downtime is a crucial requirement in the Arbitrum ecosystem. This proposal aims to empower users by ensuring transaction capabilities even when the Sequencer is unavailable. By doing so, it aligns with Arbitrum's goals of decentralization and enhancing user autonomy.\n\nAdditionally, the project will provide the open-source code for the back-end solution, thereby improving trust in the solution and tool.\n\n### 03/11/2024 - Notes:\n\nSome changes have been made in this proposal, thanks to the feedback provided by @cp0x, @maxlomu and @frisson.",

      "title": "Request for Continuation of the Arbitrum DDA Program Request",
      "content": "## **Summary**\n\nAs we near the end of allocating the initial grant budget (link to proposal), where through the [Arbitrum Grants Program ](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/) run via the Delegated Domain Allocation model by Questbook, $912k has already been allocated to over 60 proposals. Based on the overwhelming response and number of quality proposals the grant program has received, we propose to start a new program for the Arbitrum Grants via DDA through Questbook with a budget of $4,000,000 spread across 4 domains over the next two quarters. We have received great feedback and support from the community, builders, and domain allocators for requesting additional budget and continue funding projects through the delegated domain allocation model.\n\n### **Proposal**\n\nBased on the impact and insights derived from Arbitrum DDA program, we propose renewing the Program with a budget of $4M for two quarters. The domain allocators will utilize this budget to fund proposals that align with Arbitrum’s roadmap. After researching, gathering feedback from domain allocators, active community members, and builders, we propose supporting the same domains as the previous program:\n\n|Domain|Domain Allocator|Proposed Budget|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|New Protocol Ideas|Jojo|$920,000|\n|Gaming|Adam|$920,000|\n|Dev Tooling|Juandi|$920,000|\n|Education, Growth, Community and Events|Cattin (Seed Latam)|$920,000|\n\n**RFPs, acceptance criteria and specifications for each domain**\n\n1. New Protocol Ideas - [Link ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/120s88WVycDyP2pUfgcT0eE8ILuribuayHDnd5aeZxbM/edit#heading=h.4th1bgre9sv4)\n2. Gaming - [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UIQA_kGeLsXQOZsIiGaNzE35TRTbqXBl5JauNt4LECQ/edit#heading=h.ig7e612gb5vt)\n3. Dev Tooling - [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/144gTfeKKXOtPxMTEB9d73wELepJ9mNPjMJHjvCSy3uE/edit)\n4. Education, Growth, Community and Events - [Link](https://www.notion.so/e8e86fbd9ee349beb0d9046607dae812?pvs=21)\n\n* We propose increasing the allocated grants budget for all domains equally to a higher budget based on the number of proposals received in the previous round.\n* Additionally, in the first round we set a soft cap of $25,000, and we propose increasing the cap to $50,000, with a few more steps for approving a grant that is larger than $25,000, requiring the involvement of two DAs to approve a proposal rather than just the specific domain allocator.\n* Considering the previous softcap being half of what is currently proposed, and that for an average of $220,000 for each domain the program was able to run for around 3.5 months before being maxed out, we project that providing 4X the amount of the previous iteration to each domain should allow the program to constantly allocate, at the same rate or even higher, for the full 6 months projected duration\n* The increased cap will allow the Questbook Program to keep covering the bootstrap belt of grant between $1,000 to $25,000 while, at the same time, be able to serve larger protocols that inherently might have larger needs.\n\n### Specifications and Implementation\n\nSimilar to the model implemented in the initial program, the renewed grants program will be run using **[Delegated Domain Capital Allocation Model 1](https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/)**. Each *domain allocator* will run their respective domain on-chain for full transparency using Questbook. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible to the community.\n\nWhile the program has produced, accordingly to preliminary conversation with protocols and delegates, good results, we want to address and integrate the feedbacks so far proposed and partially covered in the previous section, such as:\n\n* have better accountability for the increased soft cap\n* define a more robust and structured set of rules for applicants, in regards to providing a timeline for their project(s)\n* define a cost for the management and verification of milestones after the program is completed\n* define a plan to manage the volatility of funds being distributed by the DAO in ARB token.\n\nThe DA will evaluate all the proposals through the rubrics provided for each domain, with the following framework:\n\n* in case of request below or equal to $25,000, the evaluation process will be the same of the previous iteration, with rubrics being evaluated and scored by the specific DA\n* in case of request above $25,000, and below the new soft cap of $50,000, the evaluation will involve a second DA, chosen by the first one based on the proximity of the specific expertise and knowledge to that proposal, that will have to publish a second evaluation of the rubrics alongside the score. Assuming N rubrics, scored from 1 to 5, the grant will be approved only if both the DA will give each a scoring equal or above to N*3.\n\nThe disbursement of the grant will take place on-chain from a multi-sig wallet controlled by the program manager & the domain allocator. The domain allocator will approve or reject the application based on evaluation rubric. A Grants SAFE, with 3/5 multi-sig, between the program manager and 4 domain allocators will be setup. We will then have 4 SAFEs for each of the domains with a 2/2 between the program manager and the specific domain allocator. The funds for the grants program will flow from the treasury into the Grants SAFE. This SAFE will hold the funds related to operational costs, committee compensation, and the grants budget. Funds that will be disbursed to the proposers will reside in the domain-level SAFEs.\n\nAfter the end of two quarters, the grants committee and the Arbitrum community shall evaluate the performance of each domain using publicly available data and decide to eventually, renew the program and, if so, change any specification of the domains, the domain allocators or the program manager.\n\nTo ensure predictability of the funding of the program and a proper runaway, upon receiving the amount from the DAO, the DAs alongside the PM will convert it in stables. If the protocols request it, specific grants or milestones might be paid in $ARB by converting the needed amount at the moment of payout.\n\nArbitrum DDA program closed accepting new proposals from mid February. If the program will be renewed in the terms above, the DDA program will take care, alongside the evaluation of new proposal, to keep evaluating the milestones of the previous program, thus allowing for the continuity of the previous iteration in an accountable way for grantees.\n\n### Compensation\n\nWe propose the following payment structure for the PM and DAs, with a base salary of $100/h and an increased projected workload of DA by 33% compared to the previous program, in consideration of the fact that DA not only have on average worked more than what initially was expected in the previous program, but also that they will need to spend time to cross evaluate all proposals above $25,000. On the other hand, the compensation of the PM is instead unchanged.\nWe are also adding overhead for an extra 6 months, equivalent to 20% of full-time salaries, for the Domain Allocators and the PM to keep evaluating the milestones of the grantees after the natural end of the program. This will ensure the proper continuation of the program and the followup with grantees, despite the program potentially not being renewed if so decided by the DAO. In case the program would be renewed with the same structure and people, or in case the milestone verification would come to an end before the due time, any leftover would be given back to the Arbitrum DAO.\n\n|Role|Monthly Cost|Total|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Program Manager and Questbook|$10000|$60,000*|\n|Domain Allocator|$8000|$192,000|\n|Overhead for extra 6 months|$8400|$50,400|\n|Operations Cost, Misc.||$10,000|\n||Totals:|$312,400|\n\n*Note: Questbook will provide the grants committee its grants orchestration tool at a cost of $5000 per month, included in the numbers above with the PM’s payment.\n\nAs per the above, the current costs to run program would be 7.8% of the overall budget of the grant program.\n\n* We suggest that the grants committee continue with [Synapse ](https://www.synaps.io/) for KYC services and [Docusign](https://www.docusign.com/en-in) for all contractual agreements, as we have been using these services throughout the Arbitrum DDA program 1.\n* However, for any specific asks from the grants team in order to run the process more smoothly, Questbook will charge for any additional feature requests based on the development overhead through a retrospective grant proposal from Arbitrum at the end of two quarters.\n\n### Read the whole proposal on the forum for Domain Allocator roles, responsibilities, KPIs, and Expectations",

      "title": "[Non-Emergency Action] Fix Fee Oversight ArbOS v20 “Atlas”",
      "content": "Request Non-Emergency Security Council Action\nAbstract\nThe transaction fee paid by users is composed of two parts, L2 fees and L1 fees, which together include the execution cost for running the transaction on Arbitrum alongside the cost of posting data to Ethereum (to learn more about this, read the deep dive on the subject 1).\n\nHistorically, the rollup fee market has been dominated by the L1 cost component. With the Dencun upgrade soon being enabled on Ethereum, the current pricing structure may no longer be optimal. The ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas” upgrade is a step towards better consuming the new data availability affordances offered by Ethereum, but will also potentially require further adjustment once EIP-4844 has been deployed and tested.\n\nThere was an oversight during the ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas” upgrade where two configuration should be updated for users when the Dencun upgrade occurs:\n\nL1 surplus fee. Reduce the surplus fee per byte from 32 gwei to 0.\nL2 base fee. Reduce the minimum from 0.1 gwei to 0.01 gwei.\nIn both cases, the configuration changes will match what is currently implemented in Arbitrum Nova. As evidenced by the recent surge of transactions in Arbitrum Nova, the network can handle the increased transaction throughput while offering lower fees for users in general under that configuration.\n\nImpact on the ArbitrumDAO’s revenue\nThe L2 base fee change will impact the revenue received by the ArbitrumDAO. The potential impact based on the past 30 days of activity was calculated, which if the changes had been implemented (ignoring potential changes in demand based on lower fees), would have resulted in overall profit going from 816.13 ETH → 79.89 ETH\n\nWhile the fee reduction will result in lower revenue for the ArbitrumDAO in the short term, it will ensure that the Arbitrum One network continues to offer competitive costs to its users and in turn it can lead to an increase in transaction traffic.\n\nSince the parameter change affects the revenue generated, it is important to carry out a temperature check for the ArbitrumDAO to discuss and ultimately vote on the change. If it is approved by the ArbitrumDAO, then the Security Council will be requested to initiate a non-emergency action to execute the configuration change. The goal is to ensure the fees are changed as soon as possible in line with the Decun upgrade.\n\nImplementation details\nThe following configured values will be changed in the ArbOwner smart contract that can be viewed in Contract Address 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000006b | Arbiscan.\n\nThe following governance action smart contracts will be used to initiate the action:\n\nArbOneSetAtlasL1PricingRewardAction | Address 0x36D0170D92F66e8949eB276C3AC4FEA64f83704d | Arbiscan\nArbOneSetAtlasMinBaseFeeAction | Address 0x849E360a247132F961c9CBE95Ba39106c72e1268 | Arbiscan\nThe security council will separate the two parameter change actions to enable the ArbitrumDAO to decide whether to accept one, both, or neither. The ability to decide will be reflected on Snapshot using a ranked voting with the following options:\n\nSet L1 surplus fee and L2 minimum base fee.\nSet only L1 surplus fee.\nSet only L2 minimum base fee.\nSet neither option and cancel security council action.\nTimeline\nThe ArbOS v20 “Atlas” upgrade is due to be activated on the 14th of March, and the following schedule will be pursued to address the configuration issues in a timely manner:\n\n5th March - Temperature Vote on Snapshot\n5th March - Initiate non-emergency security council action\n18th March - Activate configuration change to reduce fees\nA non-emergency security council action is viewed as ideal as it exists primarily to approve and implement routine software upgrades, routine maintenance and other parameter adjustments in a non-emergency setting.\n\nTemperature check: Snapshot 3\nSecurity council transaction: [update shortly]\n\nTaking this route will mean that Arbitrum One network will have higher than anticipated fees for 5 days.\n\nThe following governance calls will also enable the community to discuss the technical changes:\n\n6th March - Wednesday at 6pm EST\n7th March - Thursday at 9am EST\nBoth calls will be added to the governance call and more calls can be arranged if necessary.",

      "content": "The Research member should ideally possess a range of skills, including the ability to conduct objective analysis and contribute to the design of various mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, and data availability solutions, with a strong emphasis on objective data-driven research. They should also be proficient in creating processes that incentivize active delegate participation, such as developing delegate incentives frameworks and hosting regular collaborative calls. Additionally, they should be skilled in content creation to promote the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth. Moreover, the candidate should have a knack for producing impartial, data-driven research to aid delegates in making informed decisions and improving proposal quality. Excellent communication skills and the ability to manage interactions with DAO stakeholders and service providers are essential, along with the capacity to document ARDC activities and recommend solutions for any issues that arise, maintaining a governance process for continuity.\n\nOn the 22nd of January 2024, the ArbitrumDAO voted to establish & fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective; a collective of specialised individuals in Risk, Research & Security aimed at providing ongoing specialised assistance to the ArbitrumDAO: {https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/56002054155248055908873103086558103132748843103210580613728556162036150296506?chart=bubble}\n\nFollowing a call for applications, review process and amendment period in line with the Election Process as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO, we are now posting the elections for the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective in line with the applications as finalised on the 3rd of March 2024 [https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-research-development-collective-elections-applications/20805]\n\nWe encourage all Arbitrum Delegates to vote with responsibility and in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO.",

      "title": "[Non-emergency action] Fix Fee Oversight ArbOS v20 \"Atlas\"",
      "content": "Request Non-Emergency Security Council Action\n\nAbstract\nThe transaction fee paid by users is composed of two parts, L2 fees and L1 fees, which together include the execution cost for running the transaction on Arbitrum alongside the cost of posting data to Ethereum (to learn more about this, read the deep dive on the subject 1).\n\nHistorically, the rollup fee market has been dominated by the L1 cost component. With the Dencun upgrade soon being enabled on Ethereum, the current pricing structure may no longer be optimal. The ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas” upgrade is a step towards better consuming the new data availability affordances offered by Ethereum, but will also potentially require further adjustment once EIP-4844 has been deployed and tested.\n\nThere was an oversight during the ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas” upgrade where two configuration should be updated for users when the Dencun upgrade occurs:\n\nL1 surplus fee. Reduce the surplus fee per byte from 32 gwei to 0.\nL2 base fee. Reduce the minimum from 0.1 gwei to 0.01 gwei.\nIn both cases, the configuration changes will match what is currently implemented in Arbitrum Nova. As evidenced by the recent surge of transactions in Arbitrum Nova, the network can handle the increased transaction throughput while offering lower fees for users in general under that configuration.\n\nImpact on the ArbitrumDAO’s revenue\nThe L2 base fee change will impact the revenue received by the ArbitrumDAO. The potential impact based on the past 30 days of activity was calculated, which if the changes had been implemented (ignoring potential changes in demand based on lower fees), would have resulted in overall profit going from 816.13 ETH → 79.89 ETH\nWhile the fee reduction will result in lower revenue for the ArbitrumDAO in the short term, it will ensure that the Arbitrum One network continues to offer competitive costs to its users and in turn it can lead to an increase in transaction traffic.\n\nSince the parameter change affects the revenue generated, it is important to carry out a temperature check for the ArbitrumDAO to discuss and ultimately vote on the change. If it is approved by the ArbitrumDAO, then the Security Council will be requested to initiate a non-emergency action to execute the configuration change. The goal is to ensure the fees are changed as soon as possible in line with the Decun upgrade.\n\nImplementation details\nThe following configured values will be changed in the ArbOwner smart contract that can be viewed in Contract Address 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000006b | Arbiscan.\n\nThe following governance action smart contracts will be used to initiate the action:\n\nArbOneSetAtlasL1PricingRewardAction | Address 0x36D0170D92F66e8949eB276C3AC4FEA64f83704d | Arbiscan\nArbOneSetAtlasMinBaseFeeAction | Address 0x849E360a247132F961c9CBE95Ba39106c72e1268 | Arbiscan\nThe security council will separate the two parameter change actions to enable the ArbitrumDAO to decide whether to accept one, both, or neither. The ability to decide will be reflected on Snapshot using a ranked voting with the following options:\n\nSet L1 surplus fee and L2 minimum base fee.\nSet only L1 surplus fee.\nSet only L2 minimum base fee.\nSet neither option and cancel security council action.\nTimeline\nThe ArbOS v20 “Atlas” upgrade is due to be activated on the 14th of March, and the following schedule will be pursued to address the configuration issues in a timely manner:\n\n5th March - Temperature Vote on Snapshot\n5th March - Initiate non-emergency security council action\n18th March - Activate configuration change to reduce fees\nA non-emergency security council action is viewed as ideal as it exists primarily to approve and implement routine software upgrades, routine maintenance and other parameter adjustments in a non-emergency setting.\n\nTemperature check: [update shortly]\nSecurity council transaction: [update shortly]\n\nTaking this route will mean that Arbitrum One network will have higher than anticipated fees for 5 days.\n\nThe following governance calls will also enable the community to discuss the technical changes:\n\n6th March - Wednesday at 6pm EST\n7th March - Thursday at 9am EST\nBoth calls will be added to the governance call and more calls can be arranged if necessary.",

      "title": "[Non-constitutional] Proposal to fund Plurality Labs Milestone 1B(ridge)",
      "content": "## Introduction\n\nBack in August, Arbitrum DAO passed our AIP-3 to build a pluralistic grants framework that decentralizes grants decision-making, avoids capture and scales valuable grants allocations, and grows the Arbitrum ecosystem overall.\n\nOur proposal [passed on Tally](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-3-non-constitutional-fund-the-arbitrum-grants-framework-proposal-milestone-1/14976) with ~99% of delegate votes. It had overwhelming support, we believe, because you a) trust our motives and capabilities, and b) understand how big and important the problem is:\n\nNearly every DAO struggles to create sustainable value - largely because DAO decision-making is famously slow, and inefficient, which drives them to compromise their values and centralize. Arbitrum is committed to being better, and you believed in our ability to help.\n\n## Background (Milestone 1a Retrospective)\n\nAcross Milestones 1a, we pluralistically deployed funds via 12 different grants programs and different modalities for grants decision-making.\n\nExperimenting with multiple modalities allows us to allocate grants to support quick feedback about what works and can scale now. We can quickly evolve our grants decision making based the below success rubric, which determines where to allocate grants:\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/19f2561a1ec3653e1dbc41d5a646874c679c4d6a_2_621x415.jpeg)\n\n* Grow = double-down / start to scale\n* Coach = make changes / try again\n* Cut = discontinue / recommend to seed program\n\nIn Milestone 1a, we seeded the initial 12 Grants Programs. In Milestone 1b, we will lean on our newly established Plurality Labs board (more later!) as well as community voices who can evaluate our grants via our Thrive Protocol to inform where to cut, coach, and grow.\n\n[Based on our pluralistic grants framework and success criteria, these are the current results of milestone 1 ([details here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/plurality-labs-milestone-1-review/20198/2?u=senad.eth))]\n\n### Milestone 1a Wins include:\n\n* Firestarters: Four proposals passed Snapshot because of our Firestarters program - which funds unbiased research, cat herding, and crafting of proposals crucial to the DAO. These include STIP, ARDC, ARPC, and STEP. ([TNorm talking about our role with STIP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pAiy5IABZ48b0o-NqVIRcu4_NRuM9vzI/view?usp=sharing))\n* Experimenting with Grants Decision-Making Modalities: We drove over 30 experiments in collective decision-making, including proactive and retroactive grant-making, and grant-making driven by experts, expert-counsels, permissionless counsels, random counsels, and direct input mechanisms.\n* Retroactive Grants: We drove the first retroactive grants program in Arbitrum, rewarding unpaid contributors, and setting the stage for follow-on experiments. Some of these people are creating obvious value in the ecosystem now, like Atom from castlecap who is now an LTIPP advisor.\n* Quadratic Funding: Via Gitcoin, we brought thousands of new users, and hundreds of builders and builder projects to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n### Milestone 1a Lessons:\n\n* Investing in documentation: We funded 250+ projects, and spurred movement all over the DAO. But we didn’t document our work and value well. More importantly, we didn’t deliver certain written deliverables that people in the DAO were expecting on time. It hurt us. We won’t make that mistake again.\n* Investing in communications: Our bias was for action. We cared about creating value and learning - and put blinders on for everything else. We should have hired a Marketing or Comms person. We didn’t. Going forward, we’ll button up. We have a good story to tell. We’re excited to tell it.\n* Leveraging internal team: Plurality Labs was acquired by ThriveCoin in August of 2023. We have a team of 26 people who support other big ecosystems. We could have leveraged Thrive best practices. But in an effort to stay “true” to the Milestone 1 proposal, we kept the teams separate - too separate. We’ll use all available resources this time.\n\n### Vision \nWe have a big vision. We’re seeking to build the most robust pluralistic grants ecosystem in DAO history. To do it, we took some big shots on goal in Milestone 1a - funding 12 grant programs using 30 decision making experiments to fund 250+ projects. Some shots scored and others missed.\n\nThis is aligned with the expectations of the pluralistic grants approach. The only way to create and scale pluralistic grants is to decentralize bet taking… and to get as comfortable with the shots that embarrassingly fly into the stands as we are with the goals.\n\nWe will use data to help us double-down on winners and cut others. With the data we’re collecting, we will create a robust, long-term pluralistic grants framework for Arbitrum DAO. This framework is emerging now, and it will continue to become clearer throughout Milestone 1b(ridge). \n\n## Milestone 1(bridge):\n\nIn our maiden proposal, the principal outcome we sought to achieve was to demonstrate that we could deliver and scale enormous value creation via a pluralistic grants framework. The general feedback from delegates has been: kind of…\n\nThere seems to be wide agreement that we created value but need to scale,  document, and showcase.\n\nThus, after consultation with a number of the top delegates, we created this Milestone 1b(ridge) proposal that asks for the exact same amount of ARB and same timeframe as passed with 99% of delegate vote in August.\n\nIn Milestone 1b, we will show:\n\n1. We can build on winners and cut underperformers with our initial grants allocations.\n2. We can continue to drive experimentation with new grants allocations.\n3. We can deliver on all deliverables for Milestone 1 to the satisfaction of our top delegates.\n4. We can leverage better tech and systems to support further scale in Milestone 2.\n\nTo ensure we achieve these goals, we are implementing best-practices from the Thrive team that, also, are aligned with feedback we received from delegates:\n\n1. Plurality Labs Board: We are welcoming a board of top voices in the Arbitrum community for oversight, and to ensure decentralized decision-making.\n2. Human validations: Thrive Protocol allows us to validate when value is created, and pay out funds to projects upon value creation. This is critical for scale. We’ll use it.\n3. Team upgrade: We are bringing in the big guns for this one, adding team members that know grants, know DAOs, and know scale.\n\nHere’s more information about our commitments in Milestone 1b(ridge):\n\nPlurality Labs Board: We brought together trusted and known voices in the Arbitrum community. Their role with us is to gather feedback and data from our Arbitrum community, and to make strategic decisions about grants allocators, specific grants / contributions, and validations.\n\nThis board is part of this vote. We found people to represent the different stakeholder groups in Arbitrum. Now your votes will ratify this group - which includes two who voted \"No\" to our temp check for Milestone 2! \n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/81db971f7a5e9910d522a44171d3f3625bffb3cb_2_936x702.jpeg)\n\nHuman Validations: Going forward, we will fund our grants at specific milestones of value creation. White-listed Arbitrum community members will - in a pluralistic way - help clarify when value is created, and will also be rewarded for their services (more on this later).\n\nTeam revamp: We are fully utilizing our 26-person ThriveCoin team), we have also added some key team members to our roster, including: Ben West (GitCoin grants lead), Kyler Wandler (DAO Research Collective), and Scott Mandel (Complex Labs, Flexa, 2Q Ventures).\n\n## Cost\n\nAs aligned with the feedback we’ve received from delegates and community members, we made this proposal easy: The total cost and timeframe are the same as the first proposal: 3.36M ARB and 6 months, with 336k ARB to Plurality Labs and 224k ARB to program management, as in the first proposal.\n\n2.8M ARB will be funding ecosystem development, including demonstrating that we can create incrementally more value with our emerging pluralistic grants framework. We are also adding a layer of oversight to our work - welcoming an esteemed Plurality Labs board. They will, among other things, help ensure we deliver the value we promise.\n\nThe 560k ARB services fee (same ARB and same buckets as first proposal) includes:\n\nAs aligned with the feedback we’ve received from delegates and community members, we made this proposal easy: The total cost and timeframe are the same as the first proposal: 3.36M ARB and 6 months, with 336k ARB to Plurality Labs and 224k ARB to program management, as in the first proposal.\n\n2.8M ARB will be funding ecosystem development, including demonstrating that we can create incrementally more value with our emerging pluralistic grants framework.

If we do our work right (and we believe we’re on the right track) we should be spurring thriving, net-positive ecosystem activity in Arbitrum for years to come.\n\nAdditionally, we’ll be doing it via a pluralistic grants framework that has a consistent bias for value creation, further decentralization, and resistance to capture. We will be building the future of web3 together, and providing a path for all great people and teams to work with Arbitrum.\n\nWhen the value of Milestone 1b is obvious, we’ll present Milestone 2.",

      "title": "AIP: ArbOS 20 “Atlas” - Arbitrum Support for Dencun + Batch Poster Improvements ",
      "content": "# Constitutional\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis AIP proposes a number of improvements to Arbitrum chains, including the capability to leverage EIP 4844 to post batches of L2 transactions as Blobs on L1 Ethereum at a cheaper price. The proposal also includes support for most of the changes included in [Ethereum's Dencun upgrade](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7569) and 2 improvements to batch posting for Arbitrum One and Nova. The proposed ArbOS 20 “Atlas” upgrade will be ready for adoption by any Arbitrum Chain; this proposal concerns the Arbitrum One and Nova chains, as they are governed by the Arbitrum DAO. On a high level, an ArbOS upgrade can be seen as Arbitrum’s equivalent of a hard fork - more can be read about the subject over in [Arbitrum ArbOs upgrades](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-arbos-upgrades/19695).\n\nThis AIP combines following two temperature checks: [AIP: ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas”](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x813a366e287a872ada13d4f8348e771c7aa2d8c3cb00b2be31539ceab5627513) and [AIP: Batch Poster Manager and Sequencer Inbox Finality Fix](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xbecc45a6beb55a708e25195f34db2f5ff757e0da5ff55171ca731b39428e27c3) - both of which have passed.\n\nPlease note that ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas” is an upgrade that builds upon [ArbOS version 11](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-arbos-version-11/19696/) which has been adopted by the ArbitrumDAO - this proposal increments the version number to 20 instead of 12 due to technical details that allow for better Orbit chain customizability.\n\n# Changes Included\n\n## 1. Posting batches of transactions as blobs to L1 Ethereum ([EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844))\n\nWith ArbOS 20 “Atlas”, any Arbitrum chain that settles on L1 Ethereum will be able to post transactions as either calldata or “blob-data” - the latter of which is to be introduced in EIP-4844 as part of Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade.\n\nSome notes on how this is implemented for Arbitrum:\n\n* Applications on Arbitrum will not have to be modified or take any explicit action to get the benefits of using EIP-4844 (i.e. the whole chain opts-in with ArbOS 20 “Atlas”).\n* ArbOS 20 “Atlas” adds support for Arbitrum chains to send data in a blob storage format to data availability layers, like L1 Ethereum, that support the blob transaction type. This includes Arbitrum One and Nova. ArbOS 20 “Atlas” does not add support for Arbitrum chains to *receive* data in a blob storage format. This means that any L3 Orbit chain settling to an L2 Arbitrum chain will post data to the underlying L2 Arbitrum chain as calldata. The L2 Arbitrum chain will then be able to post data to a L1 data availability layer like Ethereum using blobs.\n* There currently aren't estimates on what the end-user gas savings of using blob data will be yet. This topic is something being actively worked on and monitored. Without mainnet data, the estimates for blob gas prices will not be accurate enough to reliably predict the cost reductions that users will experience - and even with mainnet data, the savings will vary by use case (i.e. no current way to predict the price impacts from all blob gas market participants yet). In general, however, the use of blobs will generally reduce the cost of using Arbitrum L2s.\n\nThis AIP includes a number of upgrades that enable Arbitrum chains to utilize EIP-4844:\n\n* Updated Sequencer Inbox contract with new methods allowing the Sequencer to post Arbitrum transactions in blob data.\n* Updates to the OneStepProof (OSP) contract to support the new Nitro fraud prover (mentioned above), along with a small patch to the ChallengeManager contract to allow changing the OSP.\n* Update to the Nitro fraud prover to support proving additional hashes, i.e., KZG and SHA256 preimages.\n* Update to the core Nitro node software to handle parsing chain data from 4844 blobs.\n\n**Nitro core changes:**\n\nCurrent full code diff can be viewed via this link: <https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/compare/consensus-v11...finalize-arbos-20>.

Enable partial support for Dencun Execution Layer\n\nEthereum’s Dencun upgrade is technically a combination of two upgrades: one to the Execution Layer and another to the Consensus Layer, named Cancun and Deneb, respectively. While the Consensus Layer upgrades are not applicable to Nitro (since Nitro is Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova’s execution engine), some of the Execution Layer changes are, including [EIP-1153](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1153) as described above. The full Cancun network upgrade specification for Ethereum can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/1fed0c0074f9d6aab3861057e1924411948dc50b/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/cancun.md).\n\nNitro’s upgrade to ArbOS 20 adds support for three specific EIPs from Cancun, those being:\n\n* Support the new transient storage EVM opcodes introduced in [EIP-1153](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1153): `TSTORE` and `TLOAD`, offering a cheaper option than storage for data that’s discarded at the end of a transaction.\n* Support the new `MCOPY` EVM opcode introduced in [EIP-5656](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5656) for cheaper memory copying.\n* Support the changes in functionality of the`SELFDESTRUCT` EVM opcode, as outlined in [EIP-6780](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6780).\n\nSince Nitro uses [Geth at the Core](https://docs.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#geth-at-the-core), the above 3 EIPs were implemented by merging in a Cancun-supported version of Geth upstream. More specifically, [Geth version 1.13.1](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.13.3) was merged into Nitro’s go-ethereum fork here:\n\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/pull/284>\n\nWith the above merged, the below PR is used to enable the Cancun fork in ArbOS 20.\n\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/pull/285>\n\n## 3. Batch Poster Manager and Sequencer Inbox Finality Fix\n\n### **Motivation**\n\n**Batch Poster Manager:**\n\nCurrently, both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, each have a single address that is granted the batch-poster role (this is currently the same as the Sequencer). The Sequencer posts batches frequently, and thus the batch-poster address must be controlled by a hot wallet. This means that if the batch poster’s keys were compromised, Sequencing could be unstable until the DAO took action.\n\nThis AIP proposes a system in which a “batch poster manager” role is granted to the operator of the Sequencer which has the ability to grant and revoke batch-posting affordances. This way, the batch poster manager could perform key rotations for the batch posters— routinely, and/or if a batch poster address is ever compromised — quickly and without the DAO needing to take coordinated action. Note that this proposal does not change the sequencer, but more so allow for easier key rotations on the batch poster.\n\nCrucially, this would not represent a change on the current system’s trust model:\n\n* In both the current and the new proposed system, the Sequencer is entrusted with managing the batch posting affordance; in the current system, for example, the entity behind Sequencer could technically grant batch posting to an additional entity by simply sharing it’s keys.\n* In the new system, the DAO would *still* have the same ability to revoke the Sequencer role; i.e., the DAO could update the batch poster manager (along with any batch posters).\n\nPR: <https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/commit/c7554852a7c41ca5eaef298dab10472a7f550df7>\n\n**MaxTimeVariation:**\n\nThe futureBlocks value in the the SequencerInbox enforces a max block height that a batch can be posted relative to the current block (likewise with futureSeconds). The current value for futureBlocks is 12, which was set prior to the Ethereum merge. A small value for future blocks means that a relatively small L1 reorg can cause an otherwise valid batch to revert. This proposal increases the value to 64, two epochs, in line with Ethereum’s finality guarantees.\n\nPR: <https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/233>\n\n### Dencun changes *not* included in ArbOS 20 “Atlas”\n\nEthereum’s Dencun upgrade includes various proposals that impact both the execution layer and the consensus layer, as mentioned earlier. Among the execution layer changes, there are two EIPs that are explicitly not included in ArbOS 20 “Atlas”. This section briefly covers the scope of the two excluded EIPs and a rationale for why they are not included in ArbOS 20 “Atlas”.\n\n* [**EIP-7516**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7516)**:** `BLOBBASEFEE` **opcode**\n\nThis EIP adds a new opcode to the EVM that returns the base fee of the current blob and is identical to the `BASEFEE` opcode introduced in [EIP-3198](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3198). This is applicable for Ethereum because it enables blob data users, such as rollup contracts or infrastructure, to programmatically account for the blob gas price.\n\nThis opcode is excluded from ArbOS 20 “Atlas” because Arbitrum chains are not currently planned to support *receiving* blobs from other chains, like an L3 Orbit chain. Calls to the `BLOBBASEFEE` opcode on Arbitrum One and Nova after the ArbOS 20 “Atlas” upgrade will revert.\n\n* [**EIP-4788**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4788)**: Beacon block root in the EVM**\n\nThis EIP commits a given block’s beacon chain root to the payload header for that particular block as a hash - essentially exposing beacon chain roots to the EVM. This is applicable for Ethereum because it improves the trust assumptions for a variety of applications that rely on data in the consensus layer. Examples of use cases that this would benefit include: staking pool, restaking constructions, smart contract bridges, and more.\n\nThis EIP is excluded from ArbOS 20 “Atlas” because Arbitrum’s execution engine (i.e. Nitro) does not have a consensus layer and relies on Ethereum consensus for data security and data finality. Calls to the beacon root opcode on Arbitrum One and Nova after the ArbOS 20 “Atlas” upgrade will revert.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThe canonical version of ArbOS 20 “Atlas” this proposal aims to adopt is implemented in the Arbitrum Nitro git commit hash `cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749` and can be viewed in <https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/commit/cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749>.\n\nArbOS 20 “Atlas” will be shipped as part of a future release of Nitro.\n\nSpecifically for the batch poster manager changes, the difference can be found here: <https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/commit/c7554852a7c41ca5eaef298dab10472a7f550df7>\n\n### Upgrade Action smart contracts\n\nThe Action smart contracts used to execute the on-chain upgrade can be viewed in <https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/244>.\n\nAction contract deployments:\n\n* 4844 + ArbOS20 (L1, for Arb One): <https://etherscan.io/address/0x76d8e97cd4514bebbc21d2044ff4a8d9ea1f0cc4>\n* 4844 + ArbOS20 (L1, for Nova): <https://etherscan.io/address/0x874356173cfd6c739aeab1f5abfb5f3afb3d4d33>\n* ArbOS 20: (Arb One): <https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3e313eeed58e851ca3841c6109697b9eb35c7726>\n* ArbOS 20: (Nova): <https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x3e313eeed58e851ca3841c6109697b9eb35c7726>\n* MaxTimeVariation (L1, for Arb One): <https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e313eeed58e851ca3841c6109697b9eb35c7726>\n* MaxTimeVariation (L1, for Nova): <https://etherscan.io/address/0x47a85c0a118127f3968a6a1a61e2a326517540d4>\n* Batch poster manager (L1, for Arb One): <https://etherscan.io/address/0xce0af261eb511cb41b8d0a2e31df80ba37e265ab>\n* Batch poster manager (L1, for Nova): <https://etherscan.io/address/0x501f30810d2b0eaec15cc3785dbb29e4a8a92a70>\n\n### Verifying the ArbOS Code Difference\n\nThe current ArbOS version used on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova is ArbOS 11, corresponding to the Arbitrum Nitro `consensus-v11`git tag. You can verify this by running the previously mentioned steps to build the WASM module root on that git tag, which produces the WASM module root `0x8b104a2e80ac6165dc58b9048de12f301d70b02a0ab51396c22b4b4b802a16a4`, which is what the rollup contract’s `wasmModuleRoot()` method returns for both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\nTo audit the code difference from ArbOS 11 to ArbOS 20, you could simply generate a full nitro diff with `git diff consensus-v11 cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749` (and also generate a diff of the go-ethereum submodule mentioned in that nitro diff). However, that includes a lot of code that isn’t part of the WASM module root. To filter down to just the replay binary which defines the state transition function, you can start by generating a list of files in the nitro and go-ethereum repositories included by the replay binary in either ArbOS 11 or ArbOS 20 with bash:\n\n\\#!/usr/bin/env bash\nset -e\nmkdir -p ~/tmp # this script uses ~/tmp as scratch space and output\n\\# this script should be run in the nitro repository\ngit checkout cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nmake .make/solgen\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/' | sed 's@github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/@@' | while read dir; do find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v20-nitro-files.txt\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/' | sed 's@github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/@go-ethereum/@' | while read dir; do find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v20-geth-files.txt\ngit checkout consensus-v11\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nmake .make/solgen\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/' | sed 's@github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/@@' | while read dir; do find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v11-nitro-files.txt\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '\\[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/' | sed 's@github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/@go-ethereum/@' | while read dir; do find \"$dir\" -type f -name '\\*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '\\_test\\\\\\\\.go$' > ~/tmp/consensus-v10-geth-files.txt\nsort -u ~/tmp/consensus-v11-nitro-files.txt ~/tmp/consensus-v20-nitro-files.txt > ~/tmp/replay-binary-nitro-dependencies.txt\nsort -u ~/tmp/consensus-v11-geth-files.txt ~/tmp/consensus-v20-geth-files.txt | sed 's@^\\[./]\\*go-ethereum/@@' > ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt\n\nNow, `~/tmp/replay-binary-dependencies.txt` contains a list of dependencies of the replay binary that were present in ArbOS 11 or ArbOS 20. To use that to generate a smaller diff of the nitro repository, you can run:\n\ngit diff consensus-v11 cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749 -- cmd/replay $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-nitro-dependencies.txt)\n\nThe fraud prover is not part of the on-chain upgrade, but may be helpful in understanding the fraud proving smart contract changes and other components:\n\ngit diff consensus-11 cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749 -- arbitrator/prover arbitrator/wasm-libraries/ arbitrator/arbutil ':!\\*\\*/Cargo.lock' ':!\\*\\*/kzg-trusted-setup.json'\n\nFor the go-ethereum submodule, you can first find out what go-ethereum commit ArbOS 11 and 20 used:\n\n$ git ls-tree consensus-v11 go-ethereum\n160000 commit abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de  go-ethereum\n$ git ls-tree cf2eadfcc1039eca9594c4f71477a50f550d7749 go-ethereum\n160000 commit 1acd9c64ac5804729475ef60aa578b4ec52fa0e6  go-ethereum\n\nThose commit hashes are the go-ethereum commit hashes pinned by each nitro commit. Then, you can again use `git diff` and the files generated by the earlier script to generate a diff limited to code used by the replay binary:\n\n\\# this should be run inside the go-ethereum submodule folder\ngit diff abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de 1acd9c64ac5804729475ef60aa578b4ec52fa0e6 -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt)\n\nThis diff also includes the diff between upstream go-ethereum versions v1.11.6 and v1.13.3, as ArbOS 11 used the former and ArbOS 20 uses the latter. To filter out that difference, you can use this tool to find the intersection of two git diffs: [Git diff intersection finder](https://gist.github.com/PlasmaPower/795af590f88cfb5e21c5ad9b8a32afdf)\n\nWe can use that to find the intersection of the diff of ArbOS 20’s go-ethereum against ArbOS 11’s go-ethereum and the diff of ArbOS 20’s go-etheruem against upstream go-ethereum v1.13.3:\n\n\\# this should be run inside the go-ethereum submodule folder\ngit diff abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de 1acd9c64ac5804729475ef60aa578b4ec52fa0e6 -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-20-geth.diff\ngit diff v1.13.3 1acd9c64ac5804729475ef60aa578b4ec52fa0e6 -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-20-vs-upstream-geth.diff\ndiff-intersection.py ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-20-geth.diff ~/tmp/arbos-20-vs-upstream-geth.diff --ignore-files 'core/blockchain\\*.go' arbitrum\\_types/txoptions.go 'rawdb/\\*\\*' 'rpc/\\*\\*'\n\nThe above command ignores files that are included by the replay binary but whose components are not used with these arguments: `--ignore-files 'core/blockchain*.go' arbitrum_types/txoptions.go 'rawdb/**' 'rpc/**'`. To also review those diffs, you can remove those arguments.\n\nNote that by default, `diff-intersection.py` does a line based intersection. To instead do an intersection based on chunks in the diff, known as hunks in git terminology, you can add the `--only-hunks` flag.",

      "title": "Changes to the Constitution and the Security Council Election Process",
      "content": "## Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis Constitutional AIP proposes improvements to the ArbitrumDAO Constitution and the Security Council election process, which include:\n\n* Candidates are given a week to apply for a Security Council position before the nominee selection stage takes place.\n* Candidates need to sign a transaction from their EOA (Externally Owned Account) to apply for a Security Council position.\n* The ArbitrumDAO Constitution is updated to reflect these changes as well as correct previous mistakes in wording with regard to timing and quorum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis AIP aims to improve the election process ensuring that candidates are not overlooked during the nominee selection stage and that candidates stand an equal chance of being nominated to the following stage of the election process, irrespective of when in the registration period they express their interest. It also updates the system so contenders must provide a signed message before running in the elections - this ensures they are able to produce signed messages for the different chains that the Security Council needs the ability to act on.\n\nIssues with the current Security Council election process:\n\n* In the nominee Selection stage, because contender registration and endorsement occur in the same 7-day period, delegates are likely to overlook applications that are submitted at the end of the period. This results in candidates who submit their applications at the start of the period having an unfair advantage, as they are more likely to be endorsed and therefore progress to the next stage.\n* Candidates might sign up to the elections using an on-chain smart contract wallet which is not able to produce signatures valid for other ArbitrumDAO-governed chains.\n* The constitution does not clearly express the election procedure.\n\n## Specifications\n\nAccordingly, this AIP aims to implement the following changes:\n\n1. A 7-day ‘Contender Submission’ stage before the ‘Nominee Selection’ stage. Accordingly, the duration of the entire election process will increase from 42 days to 49 days.\n2. For candidates to apply for a Security Council position, they are required to provide a signed message from their wallet.\n3. The wording on the ArbitrumDAO Constitution is updated to correctly reflect how quorum for proposals (as well as the election process) is handled, which should also take into account ‘abstain’ votes.\n4. The wording on the ArbitrumDAO Constitution is updated to reflect the new format of the Security Council elections.\n\nThe code representing the proposed changes is final and available for full review in: [https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/231 7](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/231) and [https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/docs/pull/731 2](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/docs/pull/731)\n\nThe Governance Action contract was deployed and is available for review in [NomineeGovernorV2UpgradeAction | Address 0xd9a2e0e5d7509f0bf1b2d33884f8c1b4d4490879 | Arbiscan 7](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xd9a2e0e5d7509f0bf1b2d33884f8c1b4d4490879#code)",

      "title": "Long Term Incentives Pilot Program",
      "content": "# Abstract\n\nThis AIP establishes a Long-term Term Incentives Pilot Program for the DAO to test new incentive designs and answer the necessary questions to ensure we are ready to commit to the long-term program. This Pilot Program will distribute a maximum of 45M ARB to protocols building on Arbitrum that were not funded during STIP or the Backfund. The program will distribute ARB to protocols for 12 weeks.\n\n# Motivation\n\n### Testing Incentives Mechanisms For a Long-Term Framework\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO has spent the last few months experimenting with incentive programs to attract new users and liquidity to Arbitrum. There is a consensus the DAO will use what we learn from these short-term programs to establish a long-term framework. While STIP V1 brought tons of attention to Arbitrum and has resulted in [upticks 1](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum/overview) in protocol metrics, we have learned there were many flaws with the structure of STIP Round 1. This Pilot Program looks to implement new mechanisms to address the issues seen during STIP. The DAO will use this Pilot Program as a test run for a long-term framework before committing to a year-long program.\n\nThe Pilot Program will operate using a Council, have Advisors to ensure protocols receive adequate feedback and assistance, and allow protocols more freedom to create innovative ARB incentive plans. We believe these changes will help remedy many of the pain points seen in Round 1. Running the Pilot Program to test these new features will allow the DAO to compare different program methods before implementing a long-term framework beginning in Q2 2024. This will help ensure we have all the knowledge necessary to implement the most effective long-term incentives program for Arbitrum.\n\n### Why Protocols Need a Round 2\n\nSTIP was an experimental program to distribute ARB to protocols to use as incentives for their users. While it was initially intended to have two rounds, the program was substantially more popular than expected, and the entire 50M ARB budget was used in Round 1 and an additional 21.4M ARB was passed through STIP Backfund for teams that were “approved but not funded”.\n\nThis meant no funds remained for Round 2, leading to its cancellation. Many protocols either missed the Round 1 deadline, intentionally waited for Round 2 or simply did not know about STIP. This left several protocols with no alternative route to apply for ARB incentives.\n\nMany STIP Round 1 grantees have seen [upticks 1](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum/overview) in their metrics. This Pilot Program would allow protocols that missed out on Round 1 the opportunity to apply to gain these benefits, which will help level the playing field for these protocols. The Pilot Program will replace a round 2 and will be funded with 45M ARB to accommodate the large expected protocol demand we have already seen. This will complete the incentivizing of Arbitrum-based teams to create a holistic competitive edge not against each other but against other chains.\n\n# Rationale\n\nThere is a DAO consensus that Arbitrum will need a long-term incentive program in 2024. However, many delegates feel the DAO is moving too quickly and spending too much money on backfund or V2 proposals without yet receiving any of the data on STIP’s effectiveness.\n\nWe have learned a lot from STIP and can use what went wrong in STIP and the Backfund to hypothesize what changes would create a better long-term framework. However, we have little evidence to prove these new ideas would be a better solution. DAO members currently don’t have the resources or funds to create a long-term program, nor do we understand what a good long-term program looks like.\n\nThis proposal focuses on obtaining this evidence using a committed working stream to guarantee we come away from this program ready to make informed decisions on a long-term framework. The pilot program also allows the DAO to test new aspects of an incentive program such as Advisors, Councils, and more flexible incentive distributions before committing long-term.\n\nThis will help save the DAO money and time in the long term by preventing the need for more short-term programs before we are ready to commit to the Long-Term Framework.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Problem / Solutions:\n\nThe specifications of the Pilot Program were designed to remedy the 3 largest complaints regarding STIP. The Pilot Program hopes to be a test run for these additions for the DAO to determine if they should also be included in the long-term framework.\n\n#### Problem #1: Too large a burden placed on delegates\n\nIn the original STIP, delegates voted on each incentive proposal individually, with almost 100 snapshot votes. This was extremely tiring for delegates and left many feeling they could not make informed decisions on every proposal.\n\n#### Solution #1: Elected council\n\nTo remedy this problem, the Pilot Program will have a 5 person council elected by the DAO responsible for evaluating applications and selecting which protocols will advance to a snapshot vote to receive ARB. This will ensure all applications are thoughtfully evaluated with only the most deserving receiving incentives. Not only will this help to reduce the burden on delegates, but it will also help expedite the process and allow protocols to receive incentives quickly and efficiently.\n\n#### Problem #2: Protocols did not receive adequate feedback on their proposals\n\nA major gripe from protocols was they struggled to get feedback from delegates before the deadline. This left many feeling as though the better-connected protocols had an advantage as they were able to modify their proposals based on feedback to make them more competitive during the vote. Many protocols were willing to make changes to their applications to make them more appealing to the DAO but never received the proper feedback necessary to do so.\n\n#### Solution #2: Advisors\n\nThe Pilot Program introduces Advisors to assist protocols throughout the pilot program. This will be impartial organizations tasked with providing each applicant with detailed feedback and guidance on how to improve their applications and eventually their incentive programs. This ensures each applicant can iterate on their proposal so they can put forward the best possible incentive plan for the council.\n\n#### Problem #3: Strict Limitations on Incentives Mechanisms\n\nSTIP Round 1 had strict limitations on how the ARB could be used as incentives. This was done to protect the DAO and prevent misuse of funds. However, the strict rules resulted in the stifling of many innovative incentive designs. Many protocols had interesting designs that used the ARB in ways that increased alignment, improved cost efficiency, or helped to limit the dumping of ARB. However, these designs were not permitted in Round 1 leading to almost all protocols resulting in generic liquidity incentive models.\n\n#### Solution #3\n\nThe Pilot Program provides more flexibility to protocols to create innovative incentive structures. With the addition of the Council and Advisors, the Pilot Program does not require the rules to be as stringent. Malicious or inefficient designs will be first filtered out by the Advisors and then rejected by the council. Allowing protocols to innovate on incentive distribution mechanisms will allow Arbitrum protocols and community members to get a better idea of which designs work and which don’t work. This will help everyone as we prepare for a longer-term incentives program.\n\n## Flow of Pilot Program\n\n#### Application Period (2 week)\n\nProtocols will have 2 weeks to apply using the Pilot Program application template. The application template will be created by the Council and the Advisors to ensure everyone has the same goals and make it easier for the council to process applications. Applications will be posted in the Pilot Program section of the Arbitrum forum. Protocols only need to post the initial draft of their application during this period. They will then have 2 additional weeks during the feedback period to edit their applications. No late submissions will be accepted.\n\n#### Feedback Period (2 weeks)\n\nDuring the feedback period, the Applications Advisors will provide feedback and guidance on all proposals. Protocols will be assigned an Application Advisor who will provide feedback and guidance on applications on a rolling basis. Protocols will then use this time to work with the Advisors to edit their proposals before applications lock at the end of the 2 weeks.\n\nProtocols can continuously adjust their requested ARB amounts until the feedback period is finished. No changes can be to the requested ARB amount during the screening period.\n\nStableLab will also read all submissions during this period and highlight any rule violations to allow applicants to edit their submissions to ensure they comply with all program rules.\n\n#### Screening Period (1 week)\n\nDuring this period, the council will use the pre-determined rubric to grade each protocol and decide which protocols will advance to the voting period to receive ARB. The Council will use the rubric to select which applications will progress to a snapshot vote. The protocols that the council selects to advance to a snapshot vote must have a total funding amount that is equal to or lower than the incentives budget. This will ensure the DAO does not overspend should all Snapshot votes pass. Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO.\n\nThe rubric will be created by the Council and Advisors during the Tally voting period and will be publicly available by the time protocols begin to apply. The council will be required to publish a brief reasoning for all of their decisions on the forum to create transparency and accountability.\n\nThe council must judge applications as they are and cannot accept protocols at lower amounts than their application states. For example, if an application asks for 200,000 ARB the council can not fund them with 100,000 ARB\n\nEXAMPLE: This is a hypothetical example using a budget of 10 ARB with 50 applicants that each request 1 ARB\n\n50 protocols apply requesting 1 Arb Each → Council grades all 50 applications using the rubric and narrows the selection down to the top 10 applicants to not exceed the budget → 10 snapshot votes are created to allow the DAO to confirm the council’s decisions → 9/10 Snapshot votes receive a majority of “fund” votes → 9 protocols are funded with 1 ARB each and 1 Arb is returned to the DAO\n\n#### Voting Period (1 Week)\n\nUpon completion of the preliminary applicant screening process by the council, the selected applications will be formally presented to the DAO for consideration. Each application will then be subject to a voting process via Snapshot, allowing Arbitrum delegates to vote on the allocation of funds.\n\n#### Compliance Period (3 weeks)\n\nAll protocols that successfully pass the voting period will undergo a KYC period during these three weeks. Arbitrum Foundation members will reach out to coordinate these KYCs. All protocols will be required to complete the KYC during this period or they may be disqualified from receiving funds.\n\nOnce all KYCs are completed, there will be one vote to ratify the DAOs selection of screened and KYC’d protocols. In the event that the Snapshot vote is favorably concluded, protocols will commence receiving its funding through an Hedgey stream, facilitated by oSnap execution.\n\n#### Incentives Period (12 weeks)\n\nSelected protocols will receive their requested ARB using bi-weekly Hedgey streams for 12 weeks. During this time, protocols will be required to provide bi-weekly updates on the progress of their incentives using a template created by the Council and Advisors. Protocols will be required to finish their incentive distributions or return any unused funds two weeks after their final disbursement is available.\n\nDuring this period Advisors will continue to work with the protocols to help them analyze and improve their distribution mechanisms. Protocols will be allowed to adjust their incentive plans as long as they do not violate any rules and provide their updated plans in their next bi-weekly update.\n\n## Roles & Responsibilities\n\n### The Council\n\nThe council will comprise 5 members. These members should be unbiased and knowledgeable builders, delegates, or organizations with experience in incentive programs, grants councils, or growing a protocol.\n\nThe council will decide which protocols will progress to a snapshot vote to be awarded the ARB incentives. The council **does not need to spend** the entire incentives budget should they feel there are not enough quality applications. **Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO to be used in the Long Term Framework.**\n\nThe council members will be responsible for creating a rubric that all protocols will be judged against. The council will design this rubric with input from the Advisors and will communicate what they are looking for with the Advisors to ensure the Advisors guide protocols in the right direction. The highest-scoring protocols will progress to Snapshot votes to allow the DAO to determine if they should receive ARB. The council will be responsible for publishing the graded rubrics as well as a brief explanation for all decisions.\n\nThe council will also be responsible for determining when to halt a protocol’s stream should they violate program rules or misuse funds. All reports of violations will be evaluated by the council. It will require 4 out of 5 council members to vote in favor of halting the stream for a stream to be stopped. Council members will coordinate with the multi-sig signers to halt a stream. Streams can also be halted via a DAO snapshot vote should the DAO disagree with the council’s judgment.\n\n#### Council Not required to Use entire 45M ARB Budget\n\nWhile 45 million was the DAO’s [selected budget](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x8112be08246466f870d0b91590fe99211f73d15cfdadac62ff3f1e6b2f74869a), the Council does not need to allocate the full amount. The council is responsible for screening applications and will only progress applications they view as worthy of moving to Snapshot. The total funding amount of applications moved to snapshot can be anywhere between 0 and 45M ARB. Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO treasury by the multisig.\n\n#### Council Selecting Research Bounties\n\nThe council will create the RFPs for the research bounties.\n\nEach RFP will include the research question that should be answered as well as the maximum budget for the bounty. While there is 200,000 ARB allocated for research bounties the council does not need to allocate the entire budget. Arbitrum delegates will then select who will complete each of these RFPs via a snapshot election.\n\n#### Council Election\n\nThe 5 council members have been selected by [DAO vote 2](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc2d7ebf5ef78084b26544905fd6febf0b8256293ce7f67a71fdcdefc5e6284a4). The 5 Council Applicants with the most votes were elected to serve on the council for the Pilot Program.\n\nThose who serve on the Pilot Program Council are not guaranteed to be included on a council in the full Long Term Incentives Program. There will be new elections to select council members when it comes time for the full long-term program.\n\n#### Council Members\n\nCouncil members have been elected via [Snapshot vote 2](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xc2d7ebf5ef78084b26544905fd6febf0b8256293ce7f67a71fdcdefc5e6284a4) and are listed below.\n\n* GFX Labs\n* 404 DAO\n* Wintermute\n* GMX\n* Karel Vuong\n\n#### Council Conflict of Interest\n\nShould a Council member have a conflict of interest with an applicant they may excuse themselves from grading said applicant. A conflict of interest can include an investment or close personal ties to an applying protocol. Should this happen the council member will have to disclose they are not grading and provide a reason.\n\nShould there be a dispute over whether the circumstances qualify as a conflict of interest the other council members will vote on whether or not the situation warrants the council members abstaining from grading that applicant.\n\n#### Removing Council Members\n\nShould the DAO feel a member or members of the council are not fulfilling their duty they may remove them using a snapshot vote.\n\nAnyone with sufficient voting power can initiate a Snapshot poll to remove council member(s). Should the poll receive a majority “remove” votes the council member(s) will be immediately removed.\n\nShould this occur there will then be a week-long application process where replacement council members can apply via the forum. This will be followed by a Snapshot vote to elect replacement member(s)\n\n#### Council Cost Breakdown\n\nEach council seat will receive **25,000 ARB** streamed biweekly throughout the program.\n\nThe council will be compensated at 83.33 ARB per hour. The amount is denominated in ARB to incentivize council members to try to maximize the Value of ARB. Additionally, offering compensation in ARB helps to attract contributors who believe in the future success of Arbitrum.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the council’s responsibilities as well as the expected amount of time they will take to complete.\n\n\n\n[<img height=\"492\" width=\"690\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 9.03.12 AM\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8c991eb08a48cd9ff205179caa08f132619b71bb_2_690x492.png\" />](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8c991eb08a48cd9ff205179caa08f132619b71bb.png \"Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 9.03.12 AM\")\n\n\n\n#### Council Responsibilities:\n\n* Design an application template and grading rubric with the help of Advisors\n* Grade all protocols against the rubric to determine who will progress to snapshot vote\n* Provide public reasoning for all funding decisions made\n* Decide whether a protocol’s funding should be halted if they violate the rules or fail to distribute ARB\n* Create research bounty RFPs\n* Pick retrofunding mechanisms and allocations for the DAO to vote on\n\n### Incentive Advisors\n\n#### Overview\n\nThree Advisors will help protocols design, implement, and iterate their incentive programs. Advisors are integral to the proposal process, serving as impartial entities with DeFi expertise. Their primary function is to provide detailed, unbiased feedback on applications, aiding protocols in refining and improving their submissions.\n\nThe Advisors will also work closely with the council to create the application template and grading rubric. This will ensure the council and advisors are on the same page so they can provide the best feedback to applicants and ensure the council understands the details of the incentive mechanisms the Advisors are helping protocols design.\n\nAs this is an experimental addition to the incentives framework, having expert advisors working with protocols will help protocols and the DAO understand what is most helpful from an advisor and allow the DAO to adjust the role for the longer-term framework. This will also help protocols design more innovative incentive distribution mechanisms that can be tested to see how effective they are going into a long-term incentives framework.\n\n#### Responsibilities\n\n*Collaboration with Council and Program Manager:* Work jointly to design the application template, KPIs, and a grading rubric, ensuring alignment with council expectations and clarity in the evaluation process.\n\n*Feedback and Recommendations:* Offer detailed feedback on each eligible application assigned to your team during the review period.\n\n*Communication with Applicants:* Engage actively with applicants to streamline the application process, aiding in proposal improvements and clarifications.\n\n*Hosting Office Hours:* Schedule and conduct public office hours 3 times per week while the program is running for protocols to seek advice. This will focus on transparency and accessibility. All interactions during these sessions will be recorded and summarized for everyone. Order of speaking during office hours will be on a first come first serve basis.\n\n#### Expectations\n\n*Impartiality*: Advisors must remain unbiased, especially as they do not have the final say in proposal acceptance. While Advisors will work closely with the council members to create the Rubric, advisors should not interfere with the votes from the council nor guarantee any outcome to projects they speak with.\n\n*Continuous Engagement:* Post-application feedback is crucial, as is ongoing involvement in the later stages of the process, subject to discussion and agreement with relevant parties. There may also be later involvement in the process when the program is running or over.\n\n#### Timeline and Process\n\n*Pre-Application Phase*: Advisors we assist the Council with the design of the application template and grading rubric. Advisors are required to hold open office hours, focusing on guiding applicants in preparing their proposals.\n\n*Application Review Phase*: Each proposal receives at least one detailed feedback report addressing key criteria established by the DAO.\n\n*Post-Application Feedback*: After the submission of proposals, advisors provide insights on the process and suggest improvements for future cycles.\n\n#### Selection and Ratification\n\nThose who serve as a Pilot Program Advisor are not guaranteed to be included onboarded in the full Long Term Incentives Program. There will be new elections to select Advisors when it comes time for the full long-term program.\n\nThe Advisors have been elected via [Snapshot vote 1](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1e5052579c5ed931f90e03e59f34274ba0a006093a6eeeab65e5e4df552668cc) and are listed below.\n\n* JoJo\n* SEEDLatam Gov\n* Castle Capital\n\n#### Advisor Budgets\n\nEach Advisor will receive **35,000 ARB** streamed biweekly throughout the program.\n\nThe council will be compensated at 83.33 ARB per hour. The amount is denominated in ARB to incentivize Advisors to try to maximize the Value of ARB. Additionally, offering compensation in ARB helps to attract contributors who believe in the future success of Arbitrum.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the Advisor’s responsibilities as well as the expected amount of time they will take to complete.\n\n\n\n[<img height=\"500\" width=\"674\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 9.03.58 AM\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/f/f9656f0ade40e4b87036d5dc325caa53b90e2353_2_674x500.png\" />](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/f/f9656f0ade40e4b87036d5dc325caa53b90e2353.png \"Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 9.03.58 AM\")\n\n\n\n### The Multisig\n\nA new multisig will be created for this program. A few individuals from the original [STIP-ARB multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0x5a5c8Da41220EeF8E7f423f6e9028da5b9E70f8B) used in Round 1 and the backfund proposal are now serving as council members in LTIPP which could create a conflict of interest. Additionally, a new multisig will help to prevent confusion regarding which funds are from STIP and which belong to LTIPP. Finally, a new multisig reduces redundancy of signers across multiple DAO programs which helps to protect the DAO by increasing decentralization.\n\nThe new [multisig 1](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=arb1:0x544cBe6698E2e3b676C76097305bBa588dEfB13A) will be a ⅗ multisig and include:\n\n1. Lindsey\n2. Limes\n3. Joseph\n4. Bobbay\n5. Alex Lumley\n\nMulti-sig address: 0x544cBe6698E2e3b676C76097305bBa588dEfB13A\n\nThe funds in the multisig belong to the DAO, and the signers act as grant managers on behalf of the DAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. In LTIPP, the council is responsible for deciding when to halt streams and can coordinate with the multi-sig signers so they can enact this request. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in DAO governance, including delegation.\n\nThe multisig includes two features to ensure the accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n1. Clawback capability so the DAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement.\n2. Streaming of funds to grantees every second week for the grant’s duration using Hedgey. This allows for the halting of funds if misuse is discovered to stop bad actors, not punish bad designs.\n\n#### Multisig Budget\n\nEach Multisig signer will receive **1,000 ARB** streamed biweekly throughout the program.\n\nIn LTIPP, the council is responsible for deciding when to halt streams. This has decreased a significant amount of the multisig’s workload. Due to this, the budget has been lowered from the STIP budget.\n\n### Program Manager\n\nThe Program Manager will be responsible for coordinating between all parties involved to ensure the Pilot Program runs smoothly. They will be available to answer any questions the DAO has regarding the Pilot Program and will publish bi-weekly reports so the community understands the status of the program. This role is designed to add efficiency and clarity to all aspects of the Pilot Program. The Program Manager will have no input into which protocols receive funds. However, they will be responsible for handling any operational tasks that arise throughout the Pilot Program.\n\nMatt from StableLab will act as the program manager. StableLab will function in a similar capacity as they did for STIP Round 1. They will help coordinate between the multisig, council, Advisors, applicants, foundation, and community to ensure the Pilot Program program runs smoothly. StableLab will serve as a neutral party and have no power to decide which protocols receive funding or which streams are halted.\n\nStableLab was responsible for designing this Pilot Program and will continue working on designing a long-term Framework with the help of the incentives working group and the DAO. StableLab will be responsible for publishing a research report on the effectiveness of the Pilot Program and their findings on how it operationally compared to STIP V1.\n\nShould the DAO feel StableLab is not fulfilling their duties as program manager, they may remove them using a snapshot vote. An emergency Snapshot vote will then be used to elect a replacement program manager.\n\nIn the Long Term Incentives Framework, this position will be decided by the DAO. However, because the Pilot Program is intended to move quickly, it will continue using StableLab’s services given they have experience from managing STIP V1 and already have knowledge from designing this process.\n\n#### Program Manager Budget and Responsibilities\n\nThe Program Manager will receive **70,000 ARB** total streamed biweekly throughout the program.\n\nThe Program Manager will be compensated at 83.33 ARB per hour. The amount is denominated in ARB to incentivize Advisors to try to maximize the Value of ARB. Additionally, offering compensation in ARB helps to attract contributors who believe in the future success of Arbitrum.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the Program Manager’s responsibilities and the expected amount of time they will take to complete.\n\nResponsibilityEstimated time SpentCompensation**Pre Application period*** Setting up council/advisor elections* Coordinating between council and advisors to ensure rubrics and templates are created* Connecting data provider to council and advisors* Preparing forum application set up* Creating systems for the Council and Advisors to track progress of applications40 hours per week for 2 weeks = 80 hours6,666.4 ARB**Application Period*** Guiding protocols on the application process* Checking Protocol eligibility* Providing announcements regarding stages of the application period* Coordinating and broadcasting Advisor Office hours to applicants* Connecting applicants to their Advisors* Assisting Council and Advisors to stay organized and ensure they are properly reviewing each applicant* Closing applications at deadline40 hours per week for 4 weeks = 160 hours13,332.8 ARB**Screening / Voting Period*** Providing operational assistance to the council to help with communication and process of screening protocols and protocols and release of rubrics* Coordinate between foundation and protocols to finish KYC* Preparing snapshot votes for protocols that pass the council screening process* Organizing Hedgey Streams for selected protocols* Answering questions from delegates regarding how to vote* Communicating with DAO to keep everyone updated on the progress of the program as well as which protocols will move to vote* Encourage delegates to vote plus guide them to applications/feedback to make informed choices.40 hours per week for 2 weeks = 80 hours6,666.4 ARB**Incentives Period:*** Help data provider connect with protocols to ensure proper data is collected* Coordinating and ensuring Protocols post their updates* Bringing concerns of misuse of funds to the council* Organize research bounty RFP selection process* Answer stream questions from protocols* Help protocols who have questions regarding the incentive rules/timelines* Addressing issues between protocols and their advisor* Provide Bi-weekly updates on the status of the program30 hours per week for 12 weeks = 360 hours29,998.8 ARB**Post Incentives*** Coordinating retroactive funding.* Coordinating Reflection Pieces from contributors* Conducting reflection interviews with applicants, contributors, and delegates* Providing operational reflection reports and recommendations for future programs.* Ensuring all unused arb is transferred back to the treasury40 hours per week for 4 weeks = 160 hours13,332.8 ARBTotal= 840 hours70,000 ARB\n\n### Data and Analytics Provider\n\n#### Overview\n\nThe Pilot Program will onboard OpenBlock Labs as a service provider for data and analytics monitoring and reporting.\n\nTo optimize each initiative, the DAO must collect and analyze data regarding the efficacy of incentives. For the two prior incentive programs, the DAO has partnered with OpenBlock Labs to provide robust incentive data, which can be found [here](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum). In addition to the data, OpenBlock provides biweekly updates to the forum, and has collaborated with dozens of protocols and delegates to share meaningful insights; our most recent analysis can be found [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/openblock-labs-bi-weekly-stip-efficacy-update-1-19/20759/1).\n\nIn the following section, we outline OpenBlock’s scope for the LTIPP.\n\n#### Responsibilities\n\n***Incorporate Past Learnings:*** Collaborate with LTIPP advisors to strategically distribute incentive budgets across categories and protocols, utilizing insights derived from OpenBlock’s STIP efficacy analysis. Our previous endeavors have uncovered millions of dollars in unoptimized spending, and we are confident that OpenBlock is well-positioned to guide the DAO in implementing improvements based on these insights.\n\nTo illustrate these insights more vividly, we present two examples of real scenarios within the STIP where OBL’s recommendations could effectively guide substantial capital allocation in a meaningful direction, showcasing the potential ROI of OBL’s work:\n\n***1. Concentration of Rewards:*** A handful of protocols have dispersed the majority of their rewards (50-70% or more) to a small group of users (less than 10). In such cases, the DAO is essentially committing millions of dollars to highly concentrated bets on user acquisition. Frequently, these major stakeholders have vested interests in the protocol, resulting in rewards flowing toward rent-seeking participants. The underlying data is available in the “User Claim Activity” section [here](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum/claims).\n*2. Excessive Spending:* Some protocols have distributed significant rewards without showing substantial additional growth compared to their pre-STIP trajectory, as observed in our competitive analysis control groups. Leveraging the data, OBL can offer insights on optimizing allocations and implementing mechanisms to enhance the efficiency of incentive spending. This includes setting specific performance targets to guide the continued deployment of funds. Since we have already spent a lot of time investing in these relationships with protocols, we are in a prime position to efficiently offer these services. The underlying data is available in the “Protocol Metrics Normalized” section [here 1](https://www.openblocklabs.com/app/arbitrum/overview).\n\n***Protocol Data Aggregation:*** Interface with each protocol to audit and aggregate data on their KPIs. Monitor efficacy through a diverse set of metrics, mirroring the approach taken in the STIP (such as nominal TVL/volume/fees/DAU growth at the protocol level, normalized by claimed ARB, competitive intelligence, aggregated data at the category and ecosystem levels, etc.). Leverage any additional resources to help teams optimize their incentive mechanisms by building more granular insights. To provide more clarity on the resources required for this section, we have detailed the scope below:\n\n*Protocol-Specific:*\n\n1. Reach out and establish connections with protocols and their data teams.\n2. Audit existing queries for accuracy and relevance.\n3. Understand the KPIs and metrics associated with their queries.\n4. Build new queries or modify existing ones based on identified KPIs.\n5. Implement ETL processes. Manage separate ETL streams for teams with data in APIs or other platforms.\n6. Create visualizations tailored to each protocol.\n7. Collaborate with protocols to appropriately label their contract addresses.\n8. Flag any instances of misbehavior to the organizing team.\n\n*Aggregate:*\n\n1. Track the flow of funds within the protocols.\n2. Develop aggregate views based on the ecosystem.\n3. Conduct competitive intelligence analysis spanning various ecosystems.\n4. Generate aggregate views covering all categories within the ecosystems.\n5. Research efficacy metrics and establish normalization standards.\n6. Compile biweekly reports summarizing findings and insights. Engage with the community and iterate on findings to inform recommendations.\n\n***Making Data Publically Available:*** The Data provider will be responsible for making the data behind each dashboard publicly available. This will ensure those completing the Research Bounties have access to this information so they can provide proper analysis of this data. Easy access to data will allow for the Bounty completers to provide better reports and data visualizations for the community. This provides the DAO with a decentralized method for analyzing and understanding how effective this program is as well as better setting up the DAO for the Long Term Framework.\n\n***Monitor For Misuse of Funds:*** The data provider will monitor data from all funded protocols to detect any misuse of funds. Should they find suspicious activity the data Provider will be responsible for sharing this with the Council.\n\n***Create a Recap Report:*** The Data provider will be responsible for creating a recap report that tells the story of the Pilot Program and breaks down the successes and failures of the different incentive strategies.\n\n***Biweekly updates:*** The data provider will provide biweekly updates of the overall themes, trends, and findings from the program.\n\n***Interface with the council, advisors and protocols:*** The analytics providers have access to a wealth of incentive data, thus they are expected to leverage this data to provide feedback to teams who are designing incentive programs.\n\n***Interface with the research bounties and community:*** The analytics provider should work with the research bounty teams and any interested community members to ensure all data is open source and available for teams to access and interact with.\n\n#### Expectations\n\nImpartiality: The Data Provider must remain unbiased. While the Data providers will not have the power to halt streams themselves, they must be impartial when it comes to reporting the data and examining for any misuse of funds. Any suspicious behavior they find must be communicated to the council for further review.\n\nContinuous Monitoring: The Data Provider must continually update the data to reflect the latest updates. This will ensure the bounty researchers and community have access to the correct information. They also must continually monitor for misuse of funds to allow the council to act quickly should any issues arise\n\n#### Selection and Ratification\n\nThis will be an elected position in the long-term program. Additionally, given the long-term framework will have a much larger scope and will include many separate incentive categories, it will most likely require the DAO to onboard multiple different organizations to handle the long-term framework’s data monitoring and reporting. However, because the Pilot Program is intended to move quickly, the Data provider will be selected and ratified by the DAO similar to STIP round 1.\n\n#### Data Provider Budget\n\nThe Data and Analytics Provider will receive **100,000 ARB** streamed throughout the program.\n\nFor this budget, OpenBlock Labs will commit 3 full-time equivalent data scientists.\n\nDuring this time they will be responsible for:\n\n* Using the data and learnings they gathered during STIP to:\n  * Help the advisors recommend strong incentive ideas to applicants\n  * Help inform the council as to what a quality applicant looks like\n* Meet with all successful applicants to create public dashboards displaying all required metrics\n  * Make the data open source so the research bounty teams have easy access to all data\n* Monitor all incentive programs for misuse of funds and report any finding to the council\n* Communicate with Research Bounty teams via telegram to ensure they have full access and understanding of the data that has been collected from the protocols\n* Provide Bi-weekly updates regarding the progress of the program.\n* Creating a final report with recommendations for how to structure future incentive programs.\n\n### Proposal Authors\n\nThis proposal has been continuously worked on by the authors since the middle of November after requests from the DAO emerged to create an alternative round 2 of STIP. The protocol authors have drafted the proposal, met with delegates for feedback, presented open workshopping calls, implemented feedback, and progressed the proposal towards a vote for the past few months. This funding section retroactively compensates the proposal authors for the hundreds of hours of work put into creating this proposal.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the three contributors as well as their time commitments over the past few months of creating this proposal.\n\nTotal Cost **30,000 ARB**\n\nContributorResponsibilityEstimated time SpentCompensationStableLabAuthoring the proposal, leading efforts to gather delegate feedback, co-hosting workshop calls and working group pitches30 hours per week for 8 weeks = 240 hours15,000 ARBAlex LumleyAssisting in proposal design, leading efforts to gather delegate feedback, co-hosting workshop calls and working group pitches20 hours per week for 8 weeks = 160 hours10,000 ARBBobby BolaAdvising proposal design, assisting with delegate outreach and feedback10 hours per week for 8 weeks = 80 hours5,000 ARBTotal450 hours30,000 ARB\n\n### Research Bounties\n\nThe Pilot Program proposal will include research bounties to ensure the DAO collects sufficient data and draws meaningful conclusions from STIP, the Backfund, and the LTIP Pilot Program to help inform the future LTIP design. There will be up to 200,000 ARB available to those who complete bounties.\n\nThis process guarantees the DAO will have multiple teams working on providing meaningful conclusions regarding incentive programs. These conclusions will be essential to allow the DAO to possess all the information necessary to create the best possible long-term incentive framework.\n\nThe Council will be responsible for creating the research bounties RFPs that will include what question the research should answer as well as a maximum budget.\n\nSome possible questions the bounties could address are:\n\n* Which protocol incentive designs were most effective at attracting sticky users/liquidity?\n* What is an appropriate budget for a Long Term Incentives Incentive Program?\n* What was more effective the council or delegates voting?\n* What category of protocol received the most funding? Were any categories left out?\n\nNote: See more [community-created research buckets in the forum here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/serious-people-research-bounties-for-ltipp/20378)\n\nResearchers will then apply to claim these bounties by providing why they are the best fit to answer the question as well as providing a budget.\n\nThe DAO will be responsible for selecting who completes each bounty based on the applicant’s experience and proposed budget.\n\nThe 200,000 ARB is the maximum amount spent on research bounties. Should the DAO choose to fund lower budgets, any unused funds will be returned to the DAO.\n\n### Retroactive Community Funding\n\nIn STIP Round 1 we saw many community members go above and beyond by providing valuable contributions without any funding. 100,000 ARB will be allocated for retroactive funding to community members who add valuable contributions during the Pilot Program. Earmarking these funds upfront lets people know there will be retro funding which will encourage community members to contribute. This section is intentionally vague to encourage all kinds of community contributions. The DAO will have the final say in how these funds will be used.\n\nThe exact methods used to distribute the funds will be selected by the DAO. The council will create a list of possible ways to retroactively distribute funds to those who have contributed to the Pilot Program. The DAO will then vote on which retroactive method(s) should be used. The DAO will also decide on who these retroactive payments will go to.\n\n### Arbitrum Delegates\n\nThis program is designed to reduce the large burden delegates faced during STIP round 1. While many of their responsibilities will be taken on by the Council and Advisors, the Arbitrum delegates will still retain the final say in many aspects of this proposal.\n\nDelegates will retain the following powers:\n\n* Elect Council Members and Advisors\n* Ratify all additional roles included in this proposal\n* Remove any position holder via a snapshot vote should the delegates feel they are not fulfilling their responsibilities\n* Vote on all incentive proposals selected by the council.\n* Select who fulfills the research bounties\n* Select the Method of distributing Retro Funding\n* Select who receives retro Funding\n\n## Eligibility Requirements\n\nThe pilot program is for protocols that did not receive ARB during STIP or the Backfund. However, protocols that received grants from the Arbitrum Foundation, Questbook’s grant program, or any other Arbitrum Grants program are eligible to receive Pilot Program funding. Additionally, receiving funding from the Pilot Program does not prohibit protocols from applying for funding from other DAO or foundation programs including the Long Term Incentives Program.\n\n#### Additional eligibility requirements\n\n* Grantees must be live on Arbitrum at the time of application\n* Grantees must refrain from farming their own incentive programs.\n* Grantees must outline a spending plan, provide a pro forma, and state the grant’s objective.\n* Grantees must commit to providing data on distributions, all ARB spending transactions, and key metrics like daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period, and be presented preferably in a Dune Spell/dashboard.\n* Grantees must agree to share all contract addresses being used to distribute incentive rewards.\n* Grantees must disclose the contracts being incentivized and denote any external contracts being incentivized as part of the program.\n* Grantees can only incentive contracts on the Arbitrum Network.\n* Grants are not to be used in DAO governance.\n* Grantees are expected to not encourage or partake Sybil attacks against the forum to sway community opinion.\n* Grantees must agree to KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation to receive funds.\n* Grantees must apply using the approved program application template\n\nBy streaming grant payments, the multisig will be empowered to hold grantees accountable to their proposals by halting fund streaming for any of the following reasons:\n\n* Any use of funds not explicitly described in the grantee’s application.\n* Failure to comply with data reporting standards.\n  * Grantee recipients will be required to provide Dune dashboards uploaded and posted to the forum by eligible teams\n    * Dashboard requirements are: Daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees for incentivized protocols. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period. If a metric does not apply, or this is not achievable, it should be noted in the application.\n    * More granular dashboards (including pool-level and user analysis) will be noted by the community for future programs.\n  * If dashboards are not posted by this date, the multisig will be empowered to halt incentive funding streams for protocols at their discretion.\n\nIn that this proposal aims to be experimental, the multisig is not intended to provide quality control on the design of incentive programs. Rather, they are empowered to halt streaming in the event of negligence or misuse of funds.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\n* The Council and Advisors have already started creating the application template and rubric\n* When the Tally vote ends the Application period will begin the next business day. Protocols will apply using the application template\n* At the same time, applicants will begin the KYC process with the foundation to expedite the process should they receive funding.\n* The Advisors and the council will begin providing feedback on proposals on a first come first serve basis.\n* Once this proposal passes the on-chain vote, the total amount of ARB will be sent to the [multisig 1](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=arb1:0x544cBe6698E2e3b676C76097305bBa588dEfB13A).\n* During the review period, the Protocols will work with Advisors to improve their applications.\n* During the review period, the council begins creating the research bounty questions.\n* All protocols that pass through the council screening phase, pass KYC, and sign grant agreements will move to a snapshot.\n* Applicants who pass the snapshot will have their streams automatically funded\n* Successful applicants will receive incentives for 12 weeks and will provide bi-weekly updates\n* The community will vote on who will fulfill the research bounties\n* The community will vote on Retrofunding\n* After the completion of the program, final reports will be posted to the forum\n* Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO\n\n# Overall Cost\n\n### Total Cost: 45,735,000 ARB\n\n* **Incentives**: 45,000,000 ARB. The entire budget does not need to be spent by the council. Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO\n* **Council Members**: 125,000 ARB - 25,000 ARB each\n* **Advisors**: 105,000 ARB - 35,000 ARB each\n* **Research Bounties**: 200,000 ARB Total - the exact amount and sizes of specific bounties will be selected by the Council and can be vetoed by delegates.\n* **Data and Analytics Provider**: 100,000 ARB for data monitoring and reporting\n* **Program Manager**: 70,000 ARB for program design, organization, management, and research report.

      "title": "Proposal: [Non-Constitutional] Funding for Into the Dungeons: Machinata - a PvP Digital Miniature Game V2",
      "content": "# Abstract\n\nThis is a revised version of the initial proposal put forth to the DAO that can be found [here.](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-funding-for-into-the-dungeons-machinata-a-pvp-digital-miniature-game/20806)\n\n## Summary\n\nWe have a lot to say about Into the Dungeons, a world we’ve been building for over 2 years, however, in the interest of preserving the DAO’s and delegates’ time this summary will aim to provide a concise overview of:\n\n1. What is Machinata?\n2. Our Ask\n3. Why DAO Funding?\n4. How does the DAO Benefit?\n\nPlease ask questions. The goal of this post is to be direct and on point. Happy to share more details with whomever is curious, but wanted this post to be easy to follow.\n\n## What is Machinata?\n\nMachinata is a 2 player turn based tactics digital miniature game where each player creates a 9 card deck consisting of units, buildings and spells. Each player then utilizes their deck to capture the opponent’s base.\n\nMachinata is designed to have short to medium session-based gameplay that lends itself to competitive gaming. This would be the first competitive e-sport like title in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nWe want to launch a playable version of Machinata during the 2nd half of 2024.\n\n## Our Ask\n\n**We are asking the DAO for 60,000 $ARB up front as a first tranche, and 180,000 $ARB in total. The rest of the 120,000 $ARB would be paid out in two tranches, 60,000 $ARB each.**\n\n**1. First tranche of 60,000 $ARB to enable us to deliver the following:**\n\n|Deliverable| Description|\n|--- | ---|\n|Into the Dungeons Branding, Website, and Marketplace Pt.1 – BRANDING AND DESIGN  | The ITD universe is expansive and will be much more than just one game. It will all live on Arbitrum.  We are aiming for a site at the level of KPR and have already had calls with the design agency that made the site.  The Marketplace is our first product – one where people will come to buy and sell their miniatures and so it needs to make an amazing impact.                                  |\n|Progress on Base Miniature Deck Pt.1 – 7 ADDITIONAL CARDS | We currently have 5 cards completed and will be able to complete the rest of the cards with the funding. Each milestone will include delivery of 7 cards.                                |\n|UPDATED UNREAL ENGINE PROTOTYPE WITH 12 CARDS | The existing prototype has 4 cards integrated. We will integrate an additional 8 cards and release 2 small teaser scenarios for marketing purposes on our website that will be playable for free.  The DAO is welcome to try the full build at the time. |\n\n**2. After the milestones above have been met and confirmed by the DAO, we would ask for the next tranche of 60,000 $ARB which will enable us to meet the following milestones:**\n\n|Deliverable | Description|\n|--- | ---|\n|Into the Dungeons Branding, Website, and Marketplace Pt.2 – RELEASE OF MARKETPLACE | This second tranche will enable us to work with the design agency and release the completed website that will not only serve as an entry point to the ITD universe but will also include our first completed product – the Marketplace.  The Marketplace is where players will be able to purchase the Base Pack, Expansion, or Single Miniatures.  The Marketplace is also a key part of the sustainability of the game. By allowing community members to submit their designs/variants of Miniatures or completely new units, we will be enabling a creator economy that will generate revenue for artists, creators, and Machinata.                            |\n|Progress on Base Miniature Deck Pt.2 – 7 additional cards completed | By the end of this milestone, we will have 19 cards completed.                              |\n|Smart Contracts | We will complete smart contracts for: 1.\tMinting miniatures (on behalf of the community creator, if a design is accepted) with their wallet receiving 70% of the proceeds and Machinata receiving 30% of the proceeds for each unit bought/sold. 2.\tSince miniatures are collectables, we want to enable collectors to trade them freely without paying us a percentage fee. However, if a miniature is traded to a player OTC, then to use it in the game, the player must register it with us by paying a small activation fee. 3.\tMatch History to be written on chain.                        |\n\n**3.\tThe final tranche of 60,000 $ARB will enable us to:**\n\n|Deliverable | Description|\n|--- | ---|\n|Begin Crowd sale of Base Game set (27 cards) + 1 PFP | With the previous two milestones completed, the last tranche will predominantly be used for launching our collection which will have an actual game tied to it!  We are currently contemplating 7777 packs with a percentage reserved for the Arbitrum community – See next section                      |\n|Initial Marketing and Partnerships | A lot of marketing and partnership money will be coming from the actual crowd sale as that will be key to making an impact in the Web3 space and bringing more users into the Arbitrum community to play Machinata and all the other cool games the community has been and will continue to build!|\n\nThis funding released over three tranches will allow us to speed up development and raise the rest of the capital required for longer term growth of the game that will include some features such as:\n1.\tStreamed competitions (similar to what Parallel did with their invitational)\n2.\tNew miniature packs being released\n3.\tNew game modes\n4.\tFurther development of the ITD ecosystem\n\n## Why Should the DAO Fund It?\nWe know asking for 60,000 $ARB upfront is a risk for the DAO, but here is why we think it is worth it.\n1.\tWe have a playable prototype – footage from in-engine (Unreal Engine) gameplay can be seen in the forum post.\n\n2.\tWe are making a high-quality digital miniature game that has been self-funded so far. Each miniature has an illustration, which is turned into a card and 5 animated pixel art sprites – some of these sprites can be seen in the forum post.\n\n3.\tWe have been active participants of the ecosystem for the last several years. Our first project https://www.ruffionreborn.xyz was self-funded and is completely opensource with all client side (Godot), server side and assets (CC0) being freely available for the Arbitrum community to make their own games. We are currently working on adding smart contracts to Ruffion Reborn.\n\n4.    We are doxxed builders and Arbitrum is home!\n[Ali Husain | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-husain1/)\n[Zehra Akbar | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zehra-akbar/)\n\n## How does the DAO Benefit?\n\nThe digital miniature model is not something that has been done yet in Web3. Games Workshop, the company behind Warhammer40K is currently valued at 4.15B USD. The concept of collectable digital miniatures with different editions, enabling artists to create variants and create a community powered economy is something that fits in very with NFT technology.\n\nWe are also creating some Arbitrum specific variants of miniatures. One example you can see in the forum post that the Soul Thief MUX variant placed alongside the Soul Thief Original Character.\n\nWe recognize that Arbitrum has a large and thriving De-Fi community and we want to involve and reward (even if it is a subset of) them for being a part of the ecosystem.\n\nA portion of the total supply (total supply will be 7777 1st edition packs, but the portion is TBD, likely 777 packs for the community) will be distributed to the Arbitrum community for free as a thank you for helping us build the game. We would like to work with the Arbitrum community via the DAO to figure out a fair distribution mechanism when we reach that point.\n\nMachinata’s success is Arbitrum’s success as the network will see more users come onboard and more transactions. Most importantly, a very high quality IP, native to Web3, native to Arbitrum.\n\nThank you,\n\nZehra & Ali\nForgotten Machine",

      "title": " Empowering Early Contributors: The community Arbiter Proposal 2.0",
      "content": "**Summary:** This proposal proposes to allocate 125,000 $ARB tokens, equal to 0.00125% of the total supply, to recognize and reward the outstanding contributions of the Arbitrum community member known as \"Arbiter\". Arbiter receives the arbiter community role in the arbitrum discord after having made significant contributions to Arbitrum, as recognized by members of the Arbitrum team.\n\nOver the three-year period 2021-2023, these contributors played a key role in the development of Arbitrum, from translating, advising, publicizing, and docking projects to community support, fraud prevention, and docking activities etc. At the time of the Arbitrum DAO's inception, Arbiters did not receive any airdrops or rewards.\n\nBy establishing a transparent and fair reward system through the Arbitrum DAO, our goal is to recognize past contributions and inspire continued dedication to the development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. Considering that arbiters did not keep proof of their contributions before and after the establishment of the Arbitrum DAO, and that a great deal of their work could not be counted or quantified, the dedication of each arbiter is also exceptionally valuable.\n\nAll members of arbiters unanimously agreed to initiate the proposal as a whole and agreed on an equal share of the reward amount.\n\n**Foreword:** 25 Arbiters come from different countries with different time zones, speak different languages. Arbiters have been deprecated by the Arbitrum team, and it has become extremely difficult to bring arbiters together. Arbiters who have made outstanding contributions to the Arbitrum community from 2021 to 2023. Compared to on-chain activists and ecosystem projects which have conducted a large number of airdrops, arbiters haven’t received any airdrop retroactive rewards\n\nConsidering the large number of contributions made by arbiters prior to the establishment of the Arbitrum DAO that have not been effectively preserved, and the fact that there are many members whose work cannot be counted and quantified, and that the dedication of each arbiter has been exceptionally valuable, all members of the arbiters have agreed that arbiters as a whole should initiate the proposal. All members of Arbiters unanimously agreed to initiate the proposal and apply for retroactive awards for Arbiters as a whole.\n\nArbiter as a whole (or project) is asking for retroactive rewards. If each member's contribution is listed one by one to make a forced comparison, this will bring arbiter infinite tug-of-war, mutual disputes, suspicion etc.. At the same time, Arbiter is not professional to establish a very systematic and perfect evaluation system.\n\nSpecial statement: As the earliest arbitrum contributor, arbiter is retroactively obtaining voting rights and voice in the governance of Arbitrum DAO. The Arbitrum DAO airdrop to early adopters and ecosystem projects also does not take price into account, but rather the weight of governance. The choice of 125,000 $ARB is fully considered (explained in detail below). If the current arb price is $0.1, the arbiter also only apply for 125,000 $ARB, which has little to do with price.\n\n**Motivation:** The Arbitrum community thrives on collaboration, decentralization, and the Ethereum community spirit. This proposal aligns with these principles and strives to:\n\n1.Recognize the exceptional contributions made by Arbiters to Arbitrum’s development.\n\n2.Demonstrate the spirit of collaboration and decentralization within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring its long-term sustainability.\n\n3.Establish a clear and equitable reward mechanism through the Arbitrum DAO, ensuring that Arbiters are treated fairly.\n\n4.Inspire more individuals to actively participate in the advancement of the Arbitrum ecosystem by retroactively rewarding Arbiters.\n\n**Rationale:** The Arbitrum community, driven by its contributors, has been instrumental in shaping Arbitrum over the past two years. These dedicated individuals have contributed significantly through a wide range of activities, including translation, promotion, event organization, community guidance, safety assurance, and collaboration with other communities. These efforts have been essential to the success and vibrancy of the Arbitrum community.\n\nPlease review the forum post for full proposal details: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-empowering-early-contributors-the-community-arbiter-proposal-2-0/20404",

The proposal also includes support for most of the changes included in [Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7569). The proposed ArbOS 20 “Atlas” upgrade will be ready for adoption by any Arbitrum Chain; this proposal concerns the Arbitrum One and Nova chains, as they are governed by the Arbitrum DAO. On a high level, an ArbOS upgrade can be seen as Arbitrum’s equivalent of a hard fork - more can be read about the subject over in [Arbitrum ArbOs upgrades ](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-arbos-upgrades/19695).\n\nPlease note that ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas” is an upgrade that builds upon [ArbOS version 11](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-arbos-version-11/19696/) which has been adopted by the ArbitrumDAO - this proposal increments the version number to 20 instead of 12 due to technical details that allow for better Orbit chain customizability.\n\nPlease review the forum post for a full description of changes included",

      "title": "[Non-Constitutional]: Arbitrum Stable Treasury Endowment Program",
      "content": "TL;DR : This framework supports the budding RWA ecosystem on Arbitrum by diversifying 35 million ARB from our treasury (~1%) into stable & liquid bills or money market instruments earning a rate of return roughly equivalent to US Treasuries (hereby called ‘stable RWAs’)\n\nThis proposal is a trial run for a larger investment policy of the ArbitrumDAO treasury, both in: \n1. Creating a legal and infrastructural pipeline that future diversification proposals can take guidance from and\n2. Proof of concept that we can diversify our treasury in a way that supports ecosystem growth\n\nThis is NOT a grant; it is an investment that Arbitrum governance can exercise control over and recall, subject to agreed-upon conditions with a successful applicant.\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Stable Treasury Endowment Program (STEP) is the first proposal floated by the Treasury WG before the DAO. We are targeting stable RWAs backed by t-bills or money market instruments as the 1st step towards larger treasury diversification for several reasons;\n1. Once we figure out how to hold stable RWAs on our books, we can easily diversify based on best practices rather than procedural considerations. The stable coins we use today in De-Fi are mostly backed by t-bill RWAs; creating our own exposure can increase capital efficiency and mitigate risk.\n2. An insight from the Arbitrum Days workshop at Istanbul was the DAO needs a strategy/program for different verticals - RWAs, gaming, NFTs, De-Fi, DeSo, DeSci, etc. Another way of looking at STEP 1 is that it’s a proposal boosting the stable RWA vertical on Arbitrum, with the added advantage that it’s in the form of an investment rather than a grant.\n\n    More generally, stable RWAs have an attractive risk-reward ratio for Arbitrum in terms of sectors we should be nurturing. The total US treasury market is over $20 trillion, some of which is expected to come onchain to satisfy demand from wealthy investors. As the home of De-Fi, we should not cede space to [Base](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/12/12/coinbase-debuts-rwa-platform-built-on-base-under-abu-dhabi-regulators-oversight/) or [Mantle](https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth/proposal/0x26884fce58b66e82fa74735a2e255f76654618278432897f4ca2430702e95dcd) that have their own RWA support program.\n\n3. Although protocols on Arbitrum and governance might wish to hold stable RWAs, they are limited by having to conduct due diligence on providers they can trust. This proposal creates a qualified screening committee that evaluates applicants and prepares a Assessment Report on them, providing a roster of vetted service providers that anyone can use for investing assets into RWAs\n\nIn conclusion, we expect that lessons learned from implementation of this proposal can pave the way for a new form of an ecosystem support program, where the ArbitrumDAO supports projects not with grants but purchases of financial products built on our chain that also diversify our treasury holdings.\n\n### Timeline and Procedure\n\n1. Snapshot temperature check and [if successful] an on-chain vote via Tally to fully implement this framework in February 2024;\n2. Screening committee publishes RFP with specific information requested from applicants and minimum criteria they must satisfy to be considered;\n3. Receive applications from service providers (30-day submission window);\n4. Screening committee reviews each application, and where needed, conduct additional due diligence and research;\n5. Assessment report on eligible service providers released by screening committee (April);\n6. ARB token holders divide their voting power among approved service providers to allocate sanctioned amount using the [Snapshot Weighted Voting](https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/proposals/voting-types) strategy. Providers receive an allocation proportionate to their support from ARB holders, provided they clear a threshold of 10% of all eligible votes.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n1. The Arbitrum foundation will act as the legal entity and face the service provider during the KYC process. They shall also hold any tokens/NFTs received in exchange of investments and have authority to withdraw assets from the service provider should any risks be discovered; however an explanation for the same shall be posted on the forum within 3 days of taking such an action. They will also periodically sweep interest earned from these assets to our treasury. Fire Drills will be periodically conducted to test solvency and clear out any AML delays in returning investments\n2. Interest earned from RWAs will be swept to our treasury for increasing our bridged USDC holdings (currently at 10 cents). For reference, $20 million in t-bills currently returns roughly $1 million in annual interest. Delay of more than 60 days in returning interest earned will result in liquidation of an investment from a service provider.\n3. Proposals to utilize interest earned will follow the same process as requesting funds from the treasury\n4. The screening committee will comprise of 6 members: Karpatkey, GFX Labs Steakhouse Financial, Nethermind and North Lake Legal, & the Treasury WG acting as facilitator and tie-breaking vote\n    * Karpatkey is a DeFi-native organisation specialising in professional DAO finance through industry-leading research and tooling since 2020. We’ve been working with GnosisDAO, Balancer, ENS, CoW Protocol, and Lido on financial planning, operations, and strategy, diversifying their treasuries into sustainable portfolios of DeFi investments designed to support DAOs in executing their missions.\n    * GFX Labs is the leading provider of professional governance services in DeFi. We are most known for our extensive past and present contributions at Uniswap, MakerDAO, Compound, and Optimism. GFX focuses on operational improvements and improving organizational quality and structure, with strong relevant experience in real-world asset onboarding and stablecoins.\n    * Steakhouse Financial is the leading CFO-as-a-service consulting company for DAOs. We specialize in stablecoins and RWAs. Our team has been merging TradFi and DeFi for years – our team met as contributors to the Strategic Finance Core Unit at MakerDAO.\n\n        We’ve contributed extensively to asset-liability management research and structuring MakerDAOs RWA portfolio, including its exposure to treasuries. We specialize in deep due-diligence reports of tokenized issuers and publish the leading research report and Dune dashboards covering the space https://dune.com/steakhouse/tokenized-securities\n\n    * *Nethermind* is a blockchain research and software engineering company empowering enterprises and developers worldwide to work with and build upon decentralized systems. Our work touches every part of the Web3 ecosystem, from fundamental cryptography research to security, node infrastructure, DeFi, and application-layer protocol development. We have a team of over 220, with more than 180 engineers on board. Nethermind is a key contributor to the development of Ethereum, with our execution client representing over a quarter of all synced nodes. Additionally, we actively build the Starknet ecosystem and support our institutional and enterprise partners in advanced blockchain, digital assets, and decentralized finance (DeFi) fields.\n    * North Lakes Legal is a law firm at the leading edge of bridging decentralized finance, DAOs and Real World Assets. North Lakes Legal implemented the standards for the initial high-profile real- world asset (“RWA”) financings in the DeFi space. Christian Petersen is the principal of North Lakes Legal and has 26 years of cross border project and structured finance experience. In support of Maker DAO, North Lakes Legal has structured, negotiated, and implemented the following:\n        -  Société Generale – DAI 40 million, tokenized French covered bonds\n        - Huntingdon Valley Bank – DAI 100 million vault to acquire RWA loan participations\n        - BlockTower Credit – DAI 150 million vault utilizing Tinlake for various RWAs\n        - Monetalis Clydesdale – DAI 500 million to acquire U.S. treasury ETF\n        - Most recently, North Lakes Legal advised Ondo Finance in the development, structuring and launch of Ondo USDY.\n\n5. The Assessment Report prepared by the screening committee on eligible service providers will be used to inform delegates and ARB holders in casting their weighted snapshot vote dividing sanctioned ARB among providers. Details in the Assessment Report include schedule for returning interest, relationship with Arbitrum (debtor or custodian), maturation period of asset, legal structure (bankruptcy remote assessment), solvency, Arbitrum alignment, turnaround time for returning investment, transparency level (proof of reserves/read only access to accounts), and fees charged.\n6. 200,000 ARB for implementation of this proposal; unused funds returned to treasury\n\nAnticipated expenditures include\n* 6 month third party audit on selected providers\n* Honorarium of 500 ARB per application for each of the 6 screening committee members (NB: this * may * be supplemented with a small application fee not exceeding $1000 to prevent spam proposals;\n* Engaging external experts and due diligence specialists where relevant.\n* Full account of fund utilization will be posted on the forum. \n\n7. Eligibility: Full RFP will be created by screening committee post Snapshot approval. Some preliminary considerations;\n* Tokenized tbills launched or bridged to Arbitrum are NOT a hard requirement to apply.\n* Attested for verifiability of assets by a 3rd party\n* Strong reputation with relevant team experience, evidence of managing assets, and regulatory compliance\n* Fully liquid, secured, and safe investments that can be called back by the DAO with 3 working days notice\n* Between 0.15-0.4% (15-40 bps) of total amount in fees with no bonuses, \n* Liquid t-bills or money market instruments approximating the so called “risk-free rate of return”",

      "title": "[Constitutional] Changes to the Constitution and the Security Council Election Process",
      "content": "Abstract\nThis Constitutional AIP proposes improvements to the ArbitrumDAO Constitution and the Security Council election process, which include:\n\n- Candidates are given a week to apply for a Security Council position before the nominee selection stage takes place.\n- Candidates need to sign a transaction from their EOA (Externally Owned Account) to apply for a Security Council position.\n- The ArbitrumDAO Constitution is updated to reflect these changes as well as correct previous mistakes in wording with regard to timing and quorum.\n\nMotivation\nThis AIP aims to improve the election process ensuring that candidates are not overlooked during the nominee selection stage and that candidates stand an equal chance of being nominated to the following stage of the election process, irrespective of when in the registration period they express their interest. It also updates the system so contenders must provide a signed message before running in the elections - this ensures they are able to produce signed messages for the different chains that the Security Council needs the ability to act on.\n\nIssues with the current Security Council election process:\n\n- In the nominee Selection stage, because contender registration and endorsement occur in the same 7-day period, delegates are likely to overlook applications that are submitted at the end of the period. This results in candidates who submit their applications at the start of the period having an unfair advantage, as they are more likely to be endorsed and therefore progress to the next stage.\n\n- Candidates might sign up to the elections using an on-chain smart contract wallet which is not able to produce signatures valid for other ArbitrumDAO-governed chains.\n\n- The constitution does not clearly express the election procedure.\n\nSpecifications\nAccordingly, this AIP aims to implement the following changes:\n\n1. A 7-day ‘Contender Submission’ stage before the ‘Nominee Selection’ stage. Accordingly, the duration of the entire election process will increase from 42 days to 49 days.\n\n2. For candidates to apply for a Security Council position, they are required to provide a signed message from their wallet.\n\n3. The wording on the ArbitrumDAO Constitution is updated to correctly reflect how quorum for proposals (as well as the election process) is handled, which should also take into account ‘abstain’ votes.\n\n4. The wording on the ArbitrumDAO Constitution is updated to reflect the new format of the Security Council elections.",

      "title": "Proposal [Non-Constitutional]: Establish the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee",
      "content": "**Abstract** - The ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) is tasked with facilitating & administering various procurement frameworks within the Arbitrum Ecosystem, creating new procurement frameworks for DAO Ratification & creating a proposal for security-service subsidies.\n\n**Motivation** - Implementing the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) and its associated frameworks is essential for the Arbitrum community as it ensures a transparent, efficient, and accountable approach to procurement, benefiting the ecosystem by securing high-quality service providers via a preemptive quality assurance mechanism which is the procurement framework.\n\n**Rationale** - the ADPC will play a pivotal role in achieving further organization within the ArbitrumDAO. The mandate of the ADPC aims to create an optimal organizational framework for service procurement while also creating a marketplace for service providers that would have gone through preemptive quality assurance.\n\n**Steps to Implement** - The AIP passed Snapshot on the 9th of January 2024. Following the conclusion of the Snapshot vote, the AIP is now proceeding to the on-chain voting stage so as to ratify the funding & process for the ADPC. Once the forecited steps are concluded the election process will commence.\n\nSpecifications & Timeline - Specifications & timeline can be found in the following sections.\n\n**Overall Cost** - For a 6-month term, $8,000 per month, per member (payable in ARB at the applicable conversion rate at the end of the respective month) & 1,000ARB per Multi-sig member \\[per month]\n\n**The Funding Request from the on-chain vote will be 200,000ARB (a buffer has been added so that, in the case of ARB depreciation, the ADPC Multi-sig is still able to satisfy payments to procurement committee members. Unutilized ARB will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury)**\n\n***\n\nNon-Constitutional\n\nTL;DR\n\n* The ADPC (ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee) has the immediate mandate of overseeing the ‘Procurement Framework for Security Service Providers’ recently ratified by the ArbitrumDAO.\n* The ADPC may add additional procurement frameworks that will be ratified through Snapshot.\n* The committee will research and propose a subsidy fund for security-oriented services within the Arbitrum Ecosystem. A ‘Means Test’ will be implemented to determine project eligibility for security service-fee subsidies.\n* The ADPC will establish procurement frameworks for various verticals and service types within the ArbitrumDAO.\n* Three members will be elected to the ADPC through Snapshot’s weighted voting system.\n* Eligibility criteria for members include experience, integrity, conflicts of interest disclosure, industry knowledge, analytical skills, financial acumen, communication skills, negotiation skills, project management abilities, ethical conduct, teamwork, technology proficiency, and decision-making skills.\n* The election process involves application submission, KYC/KYB review, and member election via Snapshot.\n* The ADPC’s term is 6 months, with a monthly stipend of $8,000 per month, per member (payable in ARB at the applicable conversion rate at the end of the respective month)\n* Operational parameters include meeting minutes, monthly reports, bi-weekly calls, and a public dashboard.\n* The ADPC’s Multi-Sig will be a 3/5 with signers receiving 1,000 ARB per month for their services. Signers cannot be Procurement Committee members.\n* Streaming of funds and clawback capabilities are implemented for multisig accountability.\n* The ADPC will be regulated via an Agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation.\n* The Agreement will cover appointment, conflict of interest, mandate, record-keeping, duty of impartiality, recusal, self-dealing prohibition, and ethical trading standards for ADPC members.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThis proposal intends to formalize a structured group within the ArbitrumDAO (the ‘ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee’ or ‘ADPC’) responsible for overseeing and managing Procurement Frameworks that are ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time depending on the needs of the organization. The ADPC’s primary purpose is to ensure that procurement activities are conducted efficiently, transparently, and in compliance with the applicable framework/s.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe ADPC’s immediate mandate will be that of facilitating & administering the recently ratified ‘Procurement Framework for Security Service Providers’ \\[REF:[Proposal \\[Non-Constitutional\\]: \\*\\*Procurement Framework \\[Security Service Providers\\]\\*\\* 15](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-procurement-framework-security-service-providers/19704) & [Snapshot 11](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3404df8a6e105dcf8b60cb22f22928aeedd3ffa5d80dc36e4f8fd74d0f5f14cb)]. This mandate can be supplemented by virtue of a Snapshot vote whereby the ArbitrumDAO may add another procurement framework that the Procurement Committee will be responsible to administer & facilitate.\n\nComposition of the ADPC \\[Mandate, Eligibility, Election Process, Funding, Operational Parameters]\n\n**\\[i] MANDATE**\n\n1. The primary mandate of the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) is to oversee and facilitate the recently ratified procurement framework for security-oriented service providers within the Arbitrum Ecosystem, as per the following reference: \\[Snapshot Proposal Link: [Snapshot 11](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3404df8a6e105dcf8b60cb22f22928aeedd3ffa5d80dc36e4f8fd74d0f5f14cb)]. In this capacity, the ADPC bears the responsibility of diligently executing the steps essential to implement the aforementioned procurement framework in a manner characterized by transparency and efficiency.\n2. The ADPC will be tasked with researching & drafting a proposal to the ArbitrumDAO to set up a subsidy-fund for security-oriented services that will be used to subsidize the costs for security-services for smaller projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n3. The ADPC will be tasked with researching & implementing a framework that will establish a set of qualitative & quantitative metrics that will be utilized so as to assess a project’s eligibility for the ‘Subsidy Fund’ referred to in point \\[b] above. This ‘Means Test’ (as referred to in traditional administrative practices), will be bundled in with the proposal that will set up the subsidy fund referred to in \\[b]. The Means Test will be used to assess whether a project is eligible for security service-fee subsidies. Initially, this methodology will only be applied to security-oriented services. However, this does not preclude the application of this same concept to other verticals within the ArbitrumDAO.\n4. The ADPC will be tasked with establishing procurement frameworks for a myriad of verticals/service-types that the ArbitrumDAO could need in the foreseeable future. This proactive approach towards procurement will naturally aid in ensuring that projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem have immediate access to high-quality whitelisted service providers when the need arises. In this regard, all procurement frameworks developed by the ADPC will need to be ratified through a Snapshot vote by the ArbitrumDAO.\n5. The ADPC will be tasked with creating & communicating guidance notes & circulars that will substantiate & provide additional detail in relation to any procurement framework that is ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time. The aim of these guidance notes & circulars is to provide prospective applicants going through the procurement process with the necessary information that would enable them to satisfactorily complete the steps of the corresponding procurement framework.\n\n**Steps \\[2], \\[3] & \\[4] of the mandate will necessarily have to be coupled with a 14-day consultation period pre-structuring so that input is solicit from the ArbitrumDAO and other relevant third-parties. The input collated during the public consultation period will necessarily need to be made public.**\n\nThe ADPC will be composed of three \\[3] members that will facilitate & administer procurement frameworks as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time. The appointment of ADPC members will be effected via an open election process via Snapshot’s weighted voting system; wherein the first three \\[3] ranked members in the vote will be elected to the ADPC. Albeit not legally binding, when voting for prospective members of the ADPC, delegates & token holders alike should prioritize the following eligibility criteria so as to properly equip the ADPC to carry out its mandate.\n\n**\\[ii] ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA**\n\nAlbeit not being legally binding, prospective voters looking to assess election applicants should in-principle conduct their assessments in light of these criteria.\n\nExperience\n\n* A demonstrated knowledge of procurement principles & best practices;\n* In-depth knowledge of procurement frameworks as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time;\n* At least 3 years experience in Legal, Operations or Administrative role.\n\nIntegrity\n\n* Disclosure of any involvement in ethical breaches, fraud, manipulation, or other forms of misconduct, whether in the past or present.\n* Failure to provide accurate and complete disclosure of such information will result in the forfeiture of the applicant’s eligibility upon the discovery of this information.\n\nConflicts of Interest and Independence of Mind\n\n* Disclosure is required for any actual or potential conflicts of interest that may emerge upon being selected for the role applied for.\n* This includes any factors that may impair one’s ability to carry out decisions with sound, objective, and independent judgment.\n\nIndustry Knowledge\n\n* A comprehensive grasp of industry-specific service procurement challenges, procurement frameworks, and prevailing best practices.\n* Previous experience drafting governance proposals.\n\nAnalytical Skills for Service Contracts\n\n* Robust analytical capabilities for evaluating and negotiating service contracts, including service-level agreements (SLAs) and performance metrics.\n* The ability to identify and assess risks associated with service procurement decisions.\n\nFinancial Acumen (Service Costs)\n\n* A firm grounding in financial aspects of service procurement, including budgeting, cost analysis, and financial implications.\n\nCommunication Skills\n\n* Exceptional communication abilities, both oral and written, for interactions with service providers, stakeholders, and fellow committee members.\n* The capacity to convey complex service procurement information clearly and effectively.\n\nNegotiation\n\n* A high degree of proficiency in negotiating service agreements and SLAs to secure favorable terms, pricing structures, and quality standards with service providers should the need arise.\n* The ability to build and maintain positive relationships with service providers.\n\nProject Management Abilities\n\n* Proficiency in project management related to service procurement, including project planning, execution, and performance monitoring.\n* The capability to manage timelines, resources, and deliverables effectively for service projects.\n\nEthical Conduct\n\n* An unwavering commitment to ethical conduct in all service procurement activities, ensuring transparency and fairness in service provider whitelisting & facilitation.\n\nTeam Player\n\n* The ability to function effectively as a team player within the committee and collaborate with other organizational departments, stakeholders, and service providers.\n* Willingness to consider diverse perspectives and reach consensus on service procurement decisions.\n\nTechnology Proficiency\n\n* Familiarity with service procurement software and tools for managing service procurement processes, data analysis, and reporting.\n* Previous experience with Asana/Airtable.\n* Previous experience with Multi-Sigs.\n\nDecision-Making Skills\n\n* Sound judgment and decision-making skills to make informed and strategic service procurement choices aligned with the organization’s service procurement strategy.\n\n**\\[iii] ELECTION PROCESS**\n\nWe propose adapting section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution & optimizing it to apply to the election for ADPC Members \\[REF: [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 5](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)]. Hereunder, we propose an adapted model of Section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution to implement in the ADPC Elections.\n\nThe ADPC election process is scheduled to begin 3 business days from the ratification of the on-chain proposal that will secure the funding for the ADPC.\n\nThe date chosen for the first election will form the basis for all future elections. Every election should begin 6 months after the previous election has been finalized.\n\nAll ADPC committee members are expected to serve their term unless terminated by the ArbitrumDAO through Snapshot as stipulated in the Agreement regulating the ADPC \\[Further details below re. the Agreement & Defining provisions in the Checks & Balances section].\n\nThere will be one election with the first three \\[3] ranking members in the weighted voting Snapshot being elected to the ADPC.\n\n**\\[iv] PROCEDURE & ELECTION TIMELINE**\n\n1. Application Submission (T+7 business days):\n\nAnyone may submit an application on a dedicated page on the ArbitrumDAO Forums in conformity with the application template stipulated hereunder;\n\n1. KYB/KYC + Delegate Review Period (7 business day period following the end of Application Submission Period):\n\nApplicants who would have validly submitted their applications in conformity with the application template will then be required to undergo KYC/KYB processes. All candidates will cooperate with the Arbitrum Foundation and complete the compliance process. The Arbitrum Foundation is responsible for removing any candidates who fail the compliance process. Only applicants who pass KYB/KYC will be eligible for the ADPC election.\n\n1. Member election (7 business day period following the end of KYB/KYC + Delegate Review Period):\n\nA Snapshot with weighted voting will be put up, including the list of all eligible candidates. The three \\[3] highest voted candidates will be elected to the Procurement Committee.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO may approve and implement a Non-Constitutional AIP to change the rules governing future ADPC elections, but the AIP process may not be used to intervene in an ongoing election.\n\n**\\[v] ELECTION APPLICATION TEMPLATE**\n\nApplicant Information:\n\nName of Applicant & Applicant’s Representative \\[If Applicable]:\n\nEmail Address:\n\nTelegram Handle (if applicable):\n\nLinkedIn Profile (if applicable):\n\nPrimary languages spoken:\n\nDisclosure of other time commitments:\n\nExperience\n\n\\[Refer to Eligibility Criteria] Please provide a brief overview of your experience in the digital asset industry and, more specifically, the Ethereum & Arbitrum Ecosystems.

This package includes a monthly stipend of $8,000 per month, per member (payable in ARB at the applicable conversion rate at the end of the respective month) to support them in their roles and responsibilities within the ADPC.\n\n**TERM**\n\nThe duration of the ADPC’s mandate will be of 182 days \\[6 months] from the moment the on-chain proposal that funds the ADPC is approved by the ArbitrumDAO.\n\n**OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS**\n\n* Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;\n* Monthly report detailing performance of the ADPC;\n* Bi-weekly calls with the community in relation to the ADPC;\n* Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ADPC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.\n\nWe believe this eliminates information asymmetry while allowing ADPC members to conduct their work in the most efficient possible manner. For token holders and the community, they can quickly go to these operational dashboards and see ADPC progress. These dashboard will also grant applicants going through the procurement process insight into internal timelines & progress, thus ensuring a high degree of transparency operationally.\n\n**ADPC \\[Multi-Sig]**\n\nThe ADPC’s 3/5 multisig is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the ArbitrumDAO and the signers act as Multi-Sig administrators on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Signers will receive 1,000 ARB per month for their contribution. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in ArbitrumDAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes:\n\n* DisruptionJoe \\[Plularity Labs]\n* [@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3) \\[Premia Finance]\n* [@limes](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/limes)\n* [@KlausBrave](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/klausbrave)\n* Dan \\[Vela]\n\nThe ADPC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\nThe ADPC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and members elected:\n\n* Streaming of funds to elected members through Hedgey on a monthly basis. The ArbitrumDAO will maintain control over this stream and have the ability to cut it off with an on-chain vote as the ArbitrumDAO will be made the Grant Admin on the Hedgey module.\n* Clawback capability as explained hereunder.\n\nThe Multi-Sig will grant the ArbitrumDAO the function to clawback funds from the ADPC Multi-Sig via the [Zodiac Governor Module via the created ArbitrumDAO ADPC.](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrumdao-procurement-clawback-capability)\n\nIn addition, after the ADPC Elections & thus, member appointment, the ADPC Multi-Sig members will utilise Hedgey to stream the respective funds to the elected members with the ArbitrumDAO being the Grant Admin thereof. The ArbitrumDAO’s Grant Admin role thus gives the DAO the ability to halt any streaming of funds to any member via governance.\n\n**CHECKS & BALANCES**\n\nThe ADPC will be regulated via an Agreement entered into by all elected ADPC Members with the Arbitrum Foundation serving as a counterparty to the Agreement.\n\nThe Agreement will be made public & include, but will not be limited to the following provisions:\n\nAppointment & Termination: ADPC Members will be appointed via the forecited election process in accordance with ArbitrumDAO Consent by the Arbitrum Community.\n\n* Arbitrum Community will be defined as follows:\n\n“Arbitrum Community” means those persons who have the right to propose and vote on proposals ergo, the token holders of the ARB token with the following contract address \\[0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548] from time to time visible at \\[[$2.03 | Arbitrum (ARB) Token Tracker | Arbiscan 1](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x912ce59144191c1204e64559fe8253a0e49e6548#balances)].\n\n* ArbitrumDAO Consent will be defined as follows:\n\n“ArbitrumDAO Consent” means a vote of the ArbitrumDAO Community in favour of a proposal satisfying the minimum requirements set forth at [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 5](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution) (as such minimum requirements set forth therein on the date hereof may be revised from time to time with ArbitrumDAO Consent) taken by any of the following means:\n\n1. [Snapshot 2](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth) (or any successor thereto); or\n2. another mechanism, whether on or off a blockchain, that ensures only and all people voting hold or have been delegated blockchain-based tokens known as ARB.\n\nConflict of Interest Provision: ADPC Members will be bound to act in absolute good faith, utmost honesty, refraining from deriving unauthorized profits from their position & disclose conflicts of interest. ADPC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to other ADPC members who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ADPC Member’s involvement in the task in relation to which such ADPC Member is conflicted.\n\nTo sum up, all ADPC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ADPC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.\n\nMandate & Purpose of the ADPC: The ADPC members are pivotal in executing the purposes of the ADPC, ensuring that the activities thereof align with the ADPC Mandate objectives and the stipulations of ratified proposal.\n\nRecord-keeping and Reporting: Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative.

      "title": "[Non-constitutional] Scaling Value Creation in Arbitrum - Milestone 2 - Plurality Labs",
      "content": "We're pleased to announce the next phase in our journey with the Arbitrum DAO community. Following extensive dialogue with delegates and insights from our overwhelmingly positive forum poll, we are presenting a streamlined temperature-check on Snapshot.\n\nThis proposal is the second milestone of our originally proposed three milestone phased approach to bring scalable and capture-resistant governance to Arbitrum DAO.\n\n### Background\n\nEthereum provides a digital public infrastructure which no single entity controls. Who remembers “unstoppable code”? In web2, we saw developers rugged by the platform they built on too many times. From Facebook banning Zynga to build their own version of popular games, to Apple’s app store battles today, web2 was and is built on politically centralized platforms.\n\nWe wanted unruggable money. We wanted to build applications not dependent on the executive of a platform - and we got it! Almost…\n\n- Bitcoin showed us that decentralized and autonomous organizing is possible\n- Ethereum brought decentralization to computation\n- Arbitrum is leading the technology race to scale Ethereum\n\nL1 grant programs have seen hundreds of millions of dollar value not to mention the myriad of new L2s launching. Optimism alone just allocated over $100 million in RPGF 3 and is poised to allocate almost $1 billion in a few years. Avalanche has allocated 4M AVAX ($290M USD), Polygon Village has a budget of 110M MATIC, Uniswap has a $72 million grant program, Binance, Polkadot, DFINITY; the list goes on. We believe we can match their impact with much less funding using the Pluralist Grants Framework.\n\nAribtrum’s credible neutrality is dependent on the enduring political decentralization of Arbitrum DAO, but we all know that over time, DAOs tend to recentralize. This is CAPTURE. \n\nPolitical power builds around the entities which distribute resources. Even the time spent together by top decision makers create social bonds that create bias and “circles of influence”. This is how capture happens. \n\n### Our Pluralist Grants Framework\n\nPlurality Labs brought the idea of a pluralist grants framework to Arbitrum. It distributes power across a larger set of actors. A pluralist democracy in governance can both enhance political decentralization and accelerate the growth of the ecosystem by scaling faster than a traditional hierarchical system. It uses evolutionary mechanics which are responsive to the needs of an infinite game.\n\nThe only way for Arbitrum to become a truly neutral digital public infrastructure is to solve capture-resistance. The strange thing is that it requires some level of centralization to do it. \n\nIn this proposal, we are asking the community to continue their trust in our processes and our ability to lead the effort to find a capture-resistant model for distributing resources. We do this in a “container” we call Thank ARB. Within this container we intend to scale the framework that we have been working on the last 6 months. \n\nDuring the first milestone, we allocated 3 million ARB to over 200 projects via 12 distinct programs. These programs included over 30 governance experiments. We learned the realities of dealing with compliance issues and have now built out both a process and technical infrastructure for collaborating with the foundation which has served other grant programs such as STIP, Backfund STIP, and the upcoming LTIPP. We plan to bring on additional staff to provide capacity for improvements in professionalization of our documentation, much better marketing reach, and to allow us to provide immediate impact upon approval of Milestone 2. \n\nWe are much more like a startup than an enterprise. We are responsible for innovation which requires our ability to execute and learn. We are in a technological race which requires us to execute with speed. We are in a cultural revolution fueling financial sovereignty which requires your trust in us to remove ourselves from the position you are granting us. Designing onchain accountability processes resilient to centralizing pressure without a sustaining administrative entity is the primary objective of Plurality Labs.\n\nOur first milestone mandated the allocation of 3 million ARB. Our second milestone was originally proposed to be 30M ARB - and our third milestone was proposed to be 100M ARB! But, because of the rapid price increase of ARB we are choosing to denominate the second milestones in USD instead. Therefore, this milestone we will request $30M as the size of the allocation fund we are responsible to deliver during 2024. \n\nThe allocation fund will be used to fund initiatives aligned with the DAOs strategic priorities. This happens in parallel to the experimentation and design work needed to deliver our overarching goals. The intention of the second milestone is to scale the amount the DAO can safely fund while also decentralizing from Plurality Labs being the primary funder for DAO operational costs. By empowering workstreams and working groups as Program Providers, Plurality Labs can remove itself from being the sole allocator funding DAO operations and focus. \n\nBased on our learnings, our plan for 2024 is to cleanly wrap up the allocation of the fund prior to December allowing for multiple months of review time for delegates to investigate our work before the Milestone 3 proposal. \n\n### Funding Request Overview\n\n- **Allocation Fund Size:** $30 million in ARB, priced based on the 30-day moving average as of the day it's posted on Tally.\n- **Plurality Labs Funding:** $3.75 million, consistent with market rates, structured as follows:\n  - $1 million in ARB paid upfront (30-day moving average pricing).\n  - $2.75 million in ARB, secured in a Hedgey Token Lockup contract for 1 year.\n\n**Funding Considerations:**\n\nThroughout Milestone 2, we'll allocate our service fee between the Plurality Labs and ThriveCoin teams, in recognition of their contributions.\n\nIn total, $33.75 million USD of ARB will be sent to the PL-ARB Grant Safety Multisig upon a successful vote on Tally. We intend to increase participation to be a 4/9 from 4/6 current setup prior to Tally. This includes only 2 Plurality Labs signers and the rest top 50 delegates. The DAO retains a clawback option for 2.75 million ARB from the fee portion and the entirety of the $30M allocation fund.\n\n**Upon approval, we'll refine any emerging details and proceed to Tally.**\n\nThis is a very brief summary of the proposal, written by Plurality labs and reviewed by me (Griff).

      "title": "Constitutional AIP - Security Council Improvement Proposal",
      "content": "### **Abstract**\n\nThis AIP seeks to propose changes to the structure of the security council so Arbitrum can maintain the “Stage 1” designation as per L2BEAT and not fall back to “Stage 0” designation.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nOn December 7, [L2BEAT published an update](https://medium.com/l2beat/stages-update-security-council-requirements-4c79cea8ef52) to the security council requirements for the [Stages Framework](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe). The requirements were updated after a lot of research and feedback to make Stages more formal and precise. \n\n### **Rationale**\n\nUpgrading the security council as per the Stage 1 requirements set by L2BEAT, will help ensure Arbitrum remains decentralized, but properly secured. See ‘Specifications’ for more details.\n\n### **Key Terms**\n\n**Stages:** A framework, inspired by [Vitalik’s proposed milestones](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571), that categorises rollups into three distinct stages based on their reliance on these training wheels. You can learn [more about the Stages framework here](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe).\n\n**Security Council:** A group of 12 individuals who are responsible for addressing risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem through the selective application of **e**mergency actions and non-emergency actions. Learn more in [the ArbitrumDAO Docs](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/security-council).\n\n**Timelock:** Smart contracts which implement a delay between an upgrade confirmation and execution.\n\n**Exit Window:** The actual time users have to exit the system in case of an unwanted upgrade.\n\n### **Specifications**\n\nArbitrum currently has two multisigs and they both contain the same set of members:\n\na) A 9/12 multisig with instant upgrade power \n\nb) A 7/12 multisig that can upgrade with a 3+7+3 days delay \n\nWhile the higher threshold multisig can be classified as a Security Council, the lower one is below the minimum threshold and it’s considered a simple multisig according to the Stages framework introduced above.\n\nFor normal multisigs, L2BEAT requires at least a 7 days exit window for users. The current exit window for Arbitrum is 2 days (see [this thread](https://x.com/stonecoldpat0/status/1737840485967032739?s=20) for a quick explanation).\n\nMoreover, the higher threshold multisig is supposed to stop malicious upgrades attempted by the lower threshold multisig. However, since the member set is the same, if the lower threshold agrees on something there are not enough members in the higher threshold to stop them, which means that the actual security of the upgradeability mechanism boils down to the 7/12 threshold.\n\nFor the above reason, technically, with the updated requirements for Stages, Arbitrum falls back to the Stage 0 designation. Since we know that it takes time to upgrade Arbitrum, we decided to leave the Stage 1 designation with the promise of addressing the above issues in a timely manner. This proposal is about addressing the issues and moving them to be voted on by the DAO.\n\n**Proposed Solutions**\n\n1) The **first solution** would be to remove the lower threshold (7/12) multisig entirely. This can be done in two ways:\n\n1. The contract is removed which requires an on-chain upgrade, or,\n2. The lower threshold multisig increases its threshold from 7/12 to 9/12 which requires no upgrade.\n\nIncreasing the threshold gives us the flexibility to restore a lower threshold in the future should the need arise, and it’s also a very quick and easy fix since it doesn’t require an on-chain upgrade.\n\nOn the other hand, removing the dependency on the lower threshold mutlisig for all the contracts in Arbitrum is a broad and potentially risky change. Therefore we suggest raising the threshold for the time being and revisiting the removal of all the dependencies at a later date if needed.\n\n2) The **second solution** would be to leave the lower threshold multisig as it is, but to increase the exit window to 7 days. In practice, this involves increasing the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days, since there is a 1 day max delay to force transactions on Arbitrum via L1 using the ‘DelayedInbox’. Increasing the L1 Timelock would not be very beneficial due to delay attacks on the fraud proof systems, since, even with BoLD,  the challenge period would end up being up to [16 days](https://x.com/DZack23/status/1737864854059335905?s=20).\n\n3) The **third solution**, which is not strictly required by the Stages Framework for the Stage 1 designation, is to both remove the lower threshold multisig entirely and increase the L2 Timelock delay so users have more time to exit in case of unwanted upgrades, increasing the security of the system even more.\n\n### Steps to Implement\n\nFollowing a week of discussion of this RFC, the proposal will go for a vote on Snapshot with the following 6 options (as they are or slightly adjusted), and/or any additional ones, should they arise from the discussion during the RFC phase:\n\n1. Increase the threshold from 7/12 to 9/12.\n2. Increase the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days.\n3. Increase the threshold and the L2 timelock delay.\n4. Make no changes.\n\nFollowing the temp-check, if any of the aforementioned options apart from No.4 is the most popular, the proposal will move to on-chain vote to execute the proposal.\n\n### **Overall Cost**\n\nThere’s no overhead to the DAO for the implementation of this proposal.\n\n### **Timeline**\n\n**RFC -** January 11th to January 18th\n\n**Snapshot -** January 18th to January 25th\n\n**On-Chain Vote:** January 30th to February 13th\n\n**Execution Delay:**\n\n- February 13th to February 16th - L2 Waiting Period\n- February 16th to February 23rd - L2-to-L1 Message\n- February 23rd to February 27th - L1 Waiting Period\n\n**Please note the aforementioned timeline is tentative and the actual timeline might be slightly different.**",

      "content": "# Final Version with Option 2 (Karma)\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe introduce an Experimental Incentive System aimed at the ArbitrumDAO delegates with a duration of six months. The goal is to assess the incentives' impact on the delegates' active participation and involvement in the DAO's governance. *This proposal is subject to changes.*\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal is the final result of the proposal published and voted in favor of option 2 in snapshot. It contains some minor changes.\n\n* [Proposal: Experimental Incentive System for Active ArbitrumDAO Delegates](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-experimental-incentive-system-for-active-arbitrumdao-delegates/19467)\n* [Snapshots Voting: Option 2 - With Karma](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xef3ed3b3735cad375953947437980db576baebbba5a0c209b2cccabcb1c30740)\n\n# **Spec: Delegate Incentive System**\n\n## Duration of the Incentive System\n\nWe've allocated an initial trial period of 6 months. This timeframe should allow us to gather initial metrics to gauge the system's functionality and its anticipated impact.\n\n## Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives\n\nWe have set the number of eligible delegates to **50**. This figure isn't based on specific reasoning, but we believe it's a good starting point, these ranking is based on the score they achieve each month.\n\n## Funding\n\n* 1,500,000 ARB Incentives\n* 30,000 ARB Karma development\n* 20,000 ARB Admin costs\n* 30,000 ARB Multisig signers\n\n**Total: 1,580,000 ARB**\n\n## **Delegate Selection Process**\n\n### Requirements\n\nBased on the feedback received, we've opted for a single-tier instead of a multi-tiered program, allowing a wider array of participants, the requirements would be as follows:\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n> **Note:**\\* So following this model, the top fifty delegates - defined by their final score - within the range, would be compensated\\* The 5000 ARB per month is the max amount a delegate could earn, but this amount could be lower depending on their score.* Certain votes won't be counted towards the Tally Participation Rate, as detailed in the following links:1. [Core Test Proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/60371879178081104082641012273221287927865067413661362234634146098631763379427)1.

[\\[OLD\\] AIP-1.1 - Lockup, Budget, Transparency ](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/79904733039853333959339953965823982558487956291458141923259498272549038367575)\n\n### Incentive Program Application\n\nDelegates matching the requirements must confirm their participation in the Incentive System in the forum (a dedicated channel will be established for this). They must post using the template provided below, within a 14-day application window.\n\n**Incentive Program Confirmation Template:**\n\n* Forum Username (Link):\n* Twitter Profile (Link):\n* Snapshot Profile (Link):\n* Tally Profile with Exact All-time Participation Rate % (Link):\n\n> **Note:**\\* Failing to send a confirmation message will exclude you from the incentive system, regardless of eligibility.\\* Applicants should ensure accuracy in numbers and links, facilitating quicker verification.\n\n**Eligible delegates for the incentive program will be announced on the forum.**\n\n## Scoring and Framework\n\nTo determine which delegates will be paid monthly, we will use a point system and a framework. Please note that this framework will be developed by Karma. Delegates can track their activities using this template.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/c8a836d3-fac3-469a-bee8-993a562b21a3_original.png)\n\n[Framework - Experimental Incentive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTRXhxcw3o8RJYWw0Nvf48Ak0ihOe5kUJUcTWH0IDgg/edit#gid=374367862)\n\n### Details: Terminology, Symbols, and Formulas\n\nWe explain in detail the framework and points system:\n\n* **Delegates (DD):** Delegates with right to access to incentives\n* **Ranking (TOP):** Delegate's position in this Dune table <https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power>\n* **Funds ARB (FARB):** The amount of ARB allocated per month to the delegates' payment\n* **Activity Weight (%):** Represents the weight assigned to each key activity to be measured in delegates.\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20:** Percentage of the total participation of the member in votes. Karma pulls the participation activity directly from onchain transactions. This is the only parameter that is not reset monthly.\n    * **PR% formula: (PR \\* 20) / 100**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15:** Percentage of delegate participation in snapshot voting. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to snapshots for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted on in the month.\n    * **SV% formula: (SV(Rn) / SV(Tn)) \\* 15**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25:** Percentage of delegate participation in on-chain voting in Tally. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to Tally for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted in Tally in the month.\n    * **TV% formula: (TV(Rn) / TV(Tn)) \\* 25**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25:** Percentage of communication threads with the justification of the delegate's vote on the proposals sent to snapshots and Tally (if necessary if the vote does not change). This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of proposals that were submitted to a vote.\n    * **Rn:** Number of real communication rational threads where the delegate communicated and justified his/her decision.\n    * **CR% formula: (CR(Rn) / CR(Tn)) \\* 25**\n  * **Commenting Proposal (CP) - Weight 15:** Percentage of proposals where the delegate asked questions or generated important discussion for the advancement of the proposal. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of formal proposals posted on the forum.\n    * **Rn:** Number of actual proposals where the delegate made a genuine and quality contribution. Spam messages will not be considered.\n    * **CP% formula: (CP(Rn) / CP(Tn)) \\* 15**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP:** This parameter is extra. If the delegate makes a significant contribution to the DAO, he/she is automatically granted +40% extra TP. This parameter is at the discretion of the program administrator. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month\n* **Total Participation (TP):** Sum of the results of activities performed by the delegate. A TP% of 100 indicates full participation.\n  * **TP% formula: PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**\n* **Payment ARB (PARB):** Final amount of ARB that the delegate will receive based on his TP% and his position in the table.\n  * **PARB formula: IF(TP% >=100; 50000 ;(5000 \\* TP% / 100))**\n\n### Parameter summary\n\n* **Activity Weight (%):**\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20%**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Commenting Proposals (CP) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP (Total Participation)**\n* **Total Participation (TP):**\n  * **TP = PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + %CP + BP**\n\n### Weight and activity considerations\n\nThe activities that have been considered in shaping the framework and scope are measurable activities that we believe can positively impact governance.\n\nWe have distributed the weight according to the type of activity, as we believe this is the fairest way to do it at the moment.\n\n**Surely both the activities and the weightings are far from being the final parameters, ideally after these 6 months we should have a clear idea of how to modify certain parameters or which ones to add/remove.**\n\n> **Note:**\n> We have not included the governance call in the list of activities because we feel that it may be difficult for delegates in different time zones to attend because of the specific timing of the call. Plus some delegates might not want to dox their voices.\n\n### Total Participation (TP)\n\nThe 50 delegates who conclude the month with a **TP score of +60%** will be the ones to receive incentives based on the result provided by the **PARB** parameter.\n\nShould more than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only the top 50 scores will be selected.\n\nIf fewer than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only those meeting the criteria will be compensated\n\n> **Note:**\n> In the exceptional circumstance where scores are identical or more than 50 delegates exceed +90%, the entire month's budget may be distributed amongst all delegates with such scores. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\n### Bonus Point\n\nShould a delegate propose or actively participate in an enhancement proposal for Arbitrum DAO and execute it, like the [Arbitrum’s Short-Term Incentive Program (Arbitrum Improvement Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131)), they will be granted an additional +30% to their TP score for making a valuable contribution to the DAO. This could also be a governance process enhancement proposal or a template for grant selection.\n\nWe understand that this is one of the weakest points of the proposal and we believe it is very objective. To assess this point we will try to answer these questions\n\n* Is the proposal of interest to the ArbitrumDAO, does it cover any vertical that has not yet been worked on?\n* Is the proposal well described, does it have details of the objectives it wants to achieve?\n* Does the proposal generate debate among delegates, is there interest among DAO members (for or against) about the proposal?\n* Does the proposer exhaust existing resources to demonstrate that their proposal adds value to ArbitrumDAO (governance calls, responds in the governance forum, etc).\n* Was the proposal put to a vote: was it a close vote or a resounding no?\n\nWhen evaluating the bonus points we will try to answer these questions and the administrator will have to upload a post to the forum with the answer and a justification of why he/she grants the bonus point. We also look forward to hearing the community's opinion on the matter.\n\n### Parameter Snapshot\n\nWhen we refer to a month, we consider from the first day of the month 00:00 UTC to the last day 23:59hs UTC of each month. Within these days and hours, delegates have the opportunity to perform all actions to meet the parameters. The month's activities conclude on the last day of the month, so delegates must be punctual.\n\n### Incentive System Administrator Responsibilities\n\nOn the last day of each month, the incentive system administrator is responsible for collecting and carefully reviewing the data provided by Karma. During this initial stage, several inconsistencies are likely to be identified and corrected. Subsequently, the administrator should announce on the forum the names of the delegates selected to receive incentives, as well as the amounts allocated to each. This procedure must be completed within 10 days.\n\nAfter the publication of these results, the delegates will have a period of 2 days to present any dispute, in case they disagree with the amounts or the selection made.\n\n### Dispute\n\nDelegates have a 2-day window to dispute if they disagree with the results presented by the Incentive System Administrator.\n\nTo raise a dispute, they must do so via a forum post with the following template:\n\n* Title: Dispute\n* Username\n* Reason for dispute (be detailed)\n\nThe system administrator must promptly address the issue, resolving it within a maximum of 2 days.\n\n#### Incentive System Ban\n\nShould a delegate or any community member attempt to deceive or game the incentive system, they will be banned. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\nWe must remember that this system is experimental, and we hope for community members' cooperation for its success.\n\n### Payment Execution\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the delegate payments are expected to be executed from the programs multisig, with full details of the payments posted on the forum, between the 13th and 14th. This will be repeated for the duration of the program.\n**Payments are made in ARB tokens.**\n\n#### Considerations\n\nLike every new and experimental system, there may be delays, so please be [patient](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lll5H9ekrsQPe7zMbvkiWTIzevlwpSJLkQql8B8UhTA/edit#gid=0).\n\n## Incentive system administrator\n\nGiven the short duration of the program and the lack of a DAO Facilitator, SEED Latam is willing to assume the administration of this program. This means that our delegation won't participate in it and that the administration won't be carried out by myself, but by the organization SEED Latam.\n\nHowever, we're also open to a group of delegates or potentially a third party administering this program, in which case we would provide any assistance necessary.\n\nFor the administration of said program the budget would be 20,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and will be sent in the proposal to Tally along with the payments to the delegates.\n\n***\n\n# **Karma automation for the delegate incentive program**\n\n### Features summary\n\nKarma will develop features to enhance administrator efficiency and provide transparency to the Arbitrum community. Given the experimental nature of this program, they have committed to implementing any modification necessary to the program, including new parameters. The features that will be built include:\n\n1. Automated fetching of all delegates with Voting Power (VP) over 50k, along with their details.\n2. Profile display for each delegate, showing their voting history and voting reasons they post on Snapshot, Tally or Forum.\n3. Calculation and display of PR, SV, TV, CR, CP (TBD if CP can be automated) for each delegate as specified in the proposal.\n   **Karma will implement automatically fetching delegates’ forum data**\n4. Functionality for the Administrator to allocate Bonus Points.\n5. Computation and presentation of the final Total Points (TP) and PARBB for each delegate on: `arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation`.\n\n**This automation eliminates the need for delegates to manually report their monthly activities.**\n\n### Timeline\n\n* **Week 1:** Collaborating with administrators and community members to finalize the project requirements.\n* **Weeks 2 and 3:** Initiating the sprint to design and develop all the features\n* **Week 4:** The product will undergo comprehensive end-to-end testing and be deployed to production. At this stage, the community will gain full access to all features.\n* **Week 5 and Beyond:** Implementation of bug fixes and enhancements based on insights and feedback gathered.\n\n### Payment Schedule\n\n* **Payment 1:** 10k ARB when the proposal passes and the project is kicked off.\n* **Payment 2:** 10K ARB on the successful launch of the product (After week 4 per the timeline above)\n* **Payment 3:** 10K ARB 2 months after launch as we continue to fix bugs and make enhancements (week 12 of program kickoff)\n\n**Karma payments will also be executed from the DAO and tracked by the program administrator.**\n\n## Multisig Management\n\nSince it would be very complicated to KYC 50 delegates (or more) for this program, and following the Foundation's recommendation, we're going to proceed with a multisig to manage payments.\n\nWe propose to use a configuration similar to that of [Plurality Labs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-3-non-constitutional-fund-the-arbitrum-grants-framework-proposal-milestone-1/14976#multisig-management-13). Having a 3/5 multisig where apart from myself, there would be a mix of DAO delegates + contributors, each receiving a 1,000 ARB payment per month for the duration of the program.\n\n#### Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module\n\n* DAO can clawback funds from a multisig directly to its treasury with a vote\n* Protects from a corrupted set of multisig signers\n* This multisig will be configured with a Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module looking at the Arbitrum token contract. This means that the DAO can at any point reclaim the funds in this multisig with a vote on Tally.\n\n**Zodiac module:** <https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum-delegate-incentives-zodiac-module>\n\n#### Signatories\n\nWe propose that the signatories be:\n\n* @Frisson\n* @dk3\n* @JoJo\n* @maxlomu\n* @cattin\n\n**Multisig:** 0xff1f38f8cDae7C1B1B289FCF6f5C1AA234DF1443\n\n## **SEED Latam Commitment**\n\nSeed Latam is committed to monitoring the proper functioning of Karma and collecting feedback from the community on the dashboard's performance. We also commit to collaborating with Karma so that the dashboard meets the needs of the incentive system.\n\nWe will also assume the responsibilities of the incentive system administrator, as mentioned in the previous points.\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nSEED Latam does not have any commercial relationship with Karma nor does it receive any payment from them for incorporating them into this proposal.\n\nThe only link between SEED Latam and Karma is that both want the success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n# Overview\n\n**Duration of the incentive system**\n\n* 6 month\n\n**Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives**\n\n* 50 delegates\n\n**Selection process**\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n*Eligible delegates must confirm their participation in the incentive system by posting a message on the forum.*\n\n## Key Points\n\n**Scoring**\n\n* Karma Delegate Dashboard\n\n**Minimum score to receive incentives**\n\n* TP= +60%\n\n**Bonus Point**\n\n* +30% TP\n\n**Parameter Snapshot**\n\n* Last day of the month 23:59 UTC\n\n**Dispute**\n\n* 2 days\n\n**Payments**\n\n* On the 13th-14th of each month from a multisig.\n\n**Incentive system administrator**\n\n* SEED Latam / Any delegate or entity willing to collaborate\n\n### Total Cost: 1,580,000\n\n* 1,500,000 ARB Incentives\n* 30,000 ARB Karma development\n* 20,000 ARB Admin costs\n* 30,000 ARB Multisig signers\n\n> **Note**\n> Costs may vary, since we probably won't give the max amount to every delegate every month, so the cost mentioned would be the max this program would cost assuming we compensate 50 delegates per month for 6 months with the maximum allocation.\n\n## Reports\n\nSEEDLatam commits to deliver two reports, one after the third month and one after the sixth (and final) month of the program with metrics on its impact, delegates' performance, and expenditures. They will also collect feedback from both the community and participating delegates.\n\n*The reports will be a detailed forum post and also accompanied by a community call explaining the metrics and feedback collected.*\n\n**ArbitrumDAO has the power to:**\n\n* Change the direction or parameters of the program when it deems necessary, with a snapshot vote.\n* Terminate the program at any time, with a snapshot vote.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nPlease note that this initial incentive system is experimental and is not intended to be the final version. With this initiative, we aim to evaluate the performance of the DAO and determine its impact. We also anticipate collaboration from both the DAO and facilitators to ensure its success.\n\nAt the end of the six months, SEED Latam commits to delivering a report containing the gathered data and feedback from the governance.\n\n## Modifications introduced post-snapshot\n\n* Karma integration (since option 2 won)\n* One additional parameter to include forum activity\n* Multisig since it would be operationally unviable to KYC every delegate",

      "content": "This is a non-constitutional proposal.\n\n**Amendments in light of community feedback:**\n\n* Standard 50,000ARB for the DAOAdvocate role due to the important nature of the role re. the ARDC.\n* Added detail re. clawback functions on \\[Multi-Sig] + \\[Service Provider Streams]\n* Created the ArbitrumDAO ARDC \\[Clawback Capability] Governor via the Zodiac Governor Module: [Tally | ArbitrumDAO ARDC \\[Clawback Capability\\]](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrumdao-ardc-clawback-capability)\n\n**Abstract** - This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.\n\n**Motivation** - The ARDC’s role in reviewing and enhancing governance proposals, conducting code reviews for security, providing quantitative analysis for economic risk, and fostering active delegate engagement will contribute significantly to the growth and success of the Arbitrum ecosystem. It will provide valuable tools and reports for proposal authors, helping them refine their ideas and make better-informed decisions.\n\n**Rationale** - the ARDC’s primary mandate aligns with the strategic priorities of the ArbitrumDAO, particularly in terms of governance optimization, risk management, research, and security. By funding the ARDC, the ArbitrumDAO can enhance its governance framework and future-proof the ecosystem through specialized verticals dedicated to these critical areas.\n\n**Steps to Implement** - Steps to Implement - The AIP moved to Snapshot on the 11th of December 2023. Following the conclusion of the Snapshot vote, the AIP will then proceed to the on-chain voting stage so as to ratify the funding & process for the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective. Once the forecited steps are concluded, [@Immutablelawyer](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/immutablelawyer) will be announcing the starting date of the election process.\n\nLink to passed Snapshot proposal: <https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xf49d88ec2f4fa7373efc66a7cf9441d916519f48a2d90e7db3ea688357150a44>\n\n**Specifications & Timeline** - Specifications & timeline can be found in the following sections.\n\n**Total Cost -**\n\nTotal: 1,761,000 ARB\n\n665,000 ARB \\[Security] \\[Applicable Cap]\n\n665,000 ARB \\[Research] \\[Applicable Cap]\n\n335,000 ARB \\[Risk] \\[Applicable Cap]\n\n50,000 ARB \\[DAOAdvocate]\n\n1,000 ARB \\[per signer - per month for the 6-month term] \\[Multi-Sig Budget]\n\nUSD16,000 payable in ARB - ImmutableLawyer \\[as retroactive payment for Research, draft and reviews of of the ARDC Proposal + Coordinating individually across stakeholders, community members & delegates] + management & administration of the pre-election application process & the election process itself until all members are appointed & the ARDC is fully operational. as envisaged in this proposal.\n\n**\\[Excess ARB which will not be utilised will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury]**\n\n***\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[ARDC]**\n\n**Non-Constitutional**\n\n*Defining ‘Arbitrum Research & Development Collective’ or ‘ARDC’: An alliance for combined action used to achieve a common goal in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO*\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.\n* This proposal intends on forking the Arbitrum Coalition proposal that was submitted & spearheaded by Blockworks Research, Gauntlet & Trail of Bits on the 25th of October 2023 ([Proposal: The Arbitrum Coalition 11](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-the-arbitrum-coalition/19145)). The proposal failed the Snapshot temperature check submitted on November 3rd 2023 ([Snapshot 7](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x42f68a26ff5a5be692a80468a1d1885cf07d590836536f5169cc4b69f64f3f37));\n* Alignment to the ArbitrumDAO Strategic Priorities:\n\n1. The ARDC’s mandate will naturally aid in ‘Governance Optimization’ through research & development of tooling related to the ArbitrumDAO’s governance framework.\n2. The ARDC’s mandate will aid in future-proofing the ArbitrumDAO by virtue of its member-specific verticals re. Risk, Research & Security.\n\n* This proposal intends on improving on the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by implementing an election mechanism to choose the service providers that may participate in the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* This proposal intends on implementing a set of legally enforceable checks & balances to regulate the internal operations of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* The ARDC will be made up of the following members \\[Subject to change following forum post feedback]: The DAOAdvocate, Risk Management-Oriented Members, Security-Oriented Members, Research-Oriented Members.\n* Fund the ARDC for a 6-month term.\n\n**Background - Perspective**\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition was an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aimed to execute turnkey R\\&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate was to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition would have provided the necessary resources so that the ArbitrumDAO can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition proposal received a lot of feedback from delegates, community members and contributors alike. In general, the general consensus was that the Arbitrum Coalition was a great theoretical idea & would have provided a great value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem. However, it lacked optimal execution in relation to its structural mechanics, especially mechanics re. the appointment & policing of service providers.\n\nThis proposal forks the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by iterating & optimizing on such proposal. Hence, certain parts of the proposal will be similar or identical.\n\n**The Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Why?]**\n\nThe Arbitrum forum is host to numerous commendable proposals, discussions & ideas. These Forum posts frequently lack the pre-requisite research, coordination, design, and risk evaluation mechanisms necessary for them to result in net-positive progress for the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\nFor instance, the iterative refinement of proposals, the cultivation of delegate awareness & participation at the Forum & voting stage, and the identification of suitable partners to execute an idea often present formidable challenges for proposers themselves (especially when they are newer entrants to the ArbitrumDAO). The primary mandate of the ARDC will be that of providing objective assessment of governance posts by distilling information and expediting governance decision-making; thereby enabling participants in the ArbitrumDAO to make better-informed choices.\n\nThe ARDC aims to possess unparalleled expertise by having an established dedicated team capable of executing this initiative. Ideally, all of the ARDC members would have made significant contributions to the ArbitrumDAO. The subject-matter areas that the ARDC Verticals aim to cater for include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Governance Proposals;\n* Research;\n* Framework Development;\n* Risk Assessment;\n* Secure Code Reviews;\n* Threat Modeling; and\n* Testing Enhancements.\n* Retroactive Analysis Of Passed Initiatives\n\nIn our opinion, the forecited subject-matter areas would provide the ArbitrumDAO with the necessary resources so as to ensure that ARDC members provide the ArbitrumDAO with a holistic execution of the ARDC mandate.\n\n**Mandate of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective (ARDC):**\n\n***Forum Proposal Review & Assistance:***\n\n* Objective Reporting: The impartial data-driven research conducted by ARDC aids delegates in making well-informed decisions by offering a comprehensive understanding of proposal contexts and competitive landscapes.\n* Proposal Improvement Tooling: These reports double as valuable tools for proposal authors, helping them enhance their work by incorporating feedback and addressing shortcomings. In this regard, the ARDC will serve as an assistant to proposers on an on-request basis to optimize & structure proposals that could prove to be a value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n***Review on Chain Proposal Code Updates:***\n\n* Enhanced Security: Through manual and automated code reviews, ARDC ensures a rigorous white-box security assessment, identifying design flaws and security issues, thus bolstering the integrity of the ecosystem.\n* Audit Executables (eg plutus dao community created staking contracts)\n\n***Quantitative Assistance:***\n\n* Quantitative Analysis: The ArbitrumDAO needs an element of quantitative rigor added to proposal evaluations, offering insights into economic risk, design optimization, and overall proposal viability.\n* Risk Mitigation: This service assists the ArbitrumDAO in identifying and mitigating economic risks associated with proposed initiatives, promoting sound decision-making.\n\n***Project Management \\[On a Request-Basis]:***\n\n* Efficient Coordination: The ARDC aims to assist in facilitating effective communication & management of proposals between the ArbitrumDAO, stakeholders, and service providers.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned services, the ARDC aims to offer the following benefits:\n\n***Tooling Creation and Enhancement:***\n\n* Security Enhancement: Developing and enhancing tools for security assessment strengthens the integrity of the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring proposal code updates meet stringent security standards.\n\n***Research New Mechanisms:***\n\n* Innovative Contributions: ARDC will objectively analyze and contributes to the development of innovative mechanisms, promoting data-driven decision-making and enhancing the ecosystem’s capabilities.\n\n***Delegate Engagement:***\n\n* Active Participation: ARDC’s processes incentivize delegates to actively contribute to proposal refinement, fostering a more engaged and collaborative governance community.\n\n***Growth Initiatives:***\n\n* Community Expansion: Through content creation, including podcasts, Twitter threads, and newsletters, ARDC attracts developers and users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, promoting growth and awareness.\n\nIn summary, the services provided by the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective(ARDC) serve to enhance governance decision-making, security, transparency, and community engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ultimately contributing to its continued growth and success.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective - Specifications of Verticals \\[Risk, Research, Security, DAOAdvocate]**\n\nThe ***DAOAdvocate***\n\nThe DAOAdvocate will be a single designated person (Legal/Natural) that will represent the ArbitrumDAO & maintains the ability to direct the ARDC’s efforts; Functions as the bridge between the ArbitrumDAO and the ARDC. The DAOAdvocate will be elected via Snapshot. The advocate will receive a stipend per month as per his ask in the application submitted to the DAO pre-election. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring that the Arbitrum DAO’s best interests are met by the ARDC & that the ARDC acts in accordance with its mandate & purposes.\n\nIf a member of the ARDC is deemed to have acted negligently, in bad faith, or contrary to the mandate/purposes of the ARDC as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO, the DAOAdvocate will have a legal obligation submit a proposal via Snapshot to terminate such a member of the ARDC together with the necessary details that justify such termination. Following this, the DAOAdvocate will have an ancillary legal obligation to submit a call for applications for the vacant ARDC seat. The decision as to who ought to take up the vacant seat will be determined by the ArbitrumDAO via the election mechanism stipulated in this Forum Post.\n\n***The Risk Member***\n\nThe Risk member should ideally possess a range of skills. This includes a strong quantitative background for conducting thorough reviews, research, and modeling or simulations related to economic risk, design, and optimization. The Risk member is to provide the ArbitrumDAO \\[through the ARDC] with a comprehensive knowledge-base in relation to digital asset-focused risk identification, risk assessment & risk mitigation. The Risk member should ideally have experience re. risk-focused design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic protocol health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights.\n\n***The Security Member***\n\nThe Security member should ideally possess skills in specific static analysis bug detection targeting code updates and developing fuzzing capabilities to validate upgrade states. They should be proficient in visualizing the state of governance contracts, ensuring correct encoding of values, and providing educational materials and guidelines for reviewing upgrade procedures. Additionally, they should have expertise in whitebox source code reviews, identifying design flaws, and ensuring security and correctness properties in on-chain upgrade proposals. This role is crucial for preventing governance attacks and may involve building tools and educational materials to support proposal reviews when no code review is required.\n\n***The Research Member***\n\nThe Research member should ideally possess a range of skills, including the ability to conduct objective analysis and contribute to the design of various mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, and data availability solutions, with a strong emphasis on objective data-driven research. They should also be proficient in creating processes that incentivize active delegate participation, such as developing delegate incentives frameworks and hosting regular collaborative calls. Additionally, they should be skilled in content creation to promote the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth. Moreover, the candidate should have a knack for producing impartial, data-driven research to aid delegates in making informed decisions and improving proposal quality. Excellent communication skills and the ability to manage interactions with DAO stakeholders and service providers are essential, along with the capacity to document ARDC activities and recommend solutions for any issues that arise, maintaining a governance process for continuity.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Elections]**\n\n[<img height=\"468\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed_2_624x468.png\" />1024×768 63.9 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed.png)\n\nWe propose adapting section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution & optimizing it to apply to the election for ARDC Members \\[REF: [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 3](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)].

ARDC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to the DAOAdvocate who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ARDC Member’s involvement in the task in relation to which such ARDC Member is conflicted.\n\nTo sum up, all ARDC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ARDC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.\n\n**Mandate & Purpose of the ARDC**: The ARDC members are pivotal in executing the purposes of the ARDC, ensuring that the activities thereof align with the ARDC’s objectives and the stipulations of ratified proposal. Here, it is also a role of the DAOAdvocate, to see that this is actually being done and that activities within the ARDC will actually further or are in conformity with the purposes outlined in the ratified proposal.\n\n**Record-keeping and Reporting**: Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ARDC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ARDC’S internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes taken by the DAOAdvocate. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ARDC Administration (such as which ARDC Member is working on which task & deadlines for the expected publication of tasks that fall in line with the purposes of the ARDC).\n\n**Duty of Impartiality**: ARDC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ARDC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.\n\n**Obligation of Recusal**: ARDC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project being reviewed by the ARDC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation and should vote Abstain if a proposal directly related to the ARDC is submitted. Additionally, ARDC members will abstain from commenting or voting on proposals made by any company that can be deemed a direct competitor.\n\n**Prohibition of Self-Dealing**: Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.\n\n**Ethical Trading**: Members are required to follow ethical trading standards in regard to ARB and any other relevant digital assets.\n\n**Operational parameters to be implemented**\n\n* Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;\n* Monthly report detailing performance of the ARDC;\n* Bi-weekly calls with the community in relation to the ARDC;\n* Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ARDC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.\n\nWe believe this eliminates information asymmetry while allowing ARDC members to conduct their work in the most efficient possible manner. For token holders and the community, they can quickly go to these operational dashboards and see ARDC progress. When research is released, it’s clearly defined who worked on it, amount of hours, and total project time.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Multi-Sig]**\n\nThe ARDC’s 3/5 multisig is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the ArbitrumDAO and the signers act as Multi-Sig administrators on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Signers will receive 1,000 ARB per month for their contribution. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in ArbitrumDAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes:\n\n* Sam \\[Gains Network]\n* Matt \\[StableLab]\n* ImmutableLawyer \\[Axis Advisory]\n* Max \\[Connext]\n* Brian \\[Gamma Strategies]\n\nThe ARDC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and members elected:\n\n* Streaming of funds to elected members through Hedgey on a monthly basis. The ArbitrumDAO will maintain control over this stream and have the ability to cut it off with an on-chain vote as the ArbitrumDAO will be made the Grant Admin on the Hedgey module.\n* Clawback capability as explained hereunder.\n\n**The Multi-Sig will grant the ArbitrumDAO the function to clawback funds from the ARDC Multi-Sig via the Zodiac Governor Module via the created ArbitrumDAO ARDC \\[Clawback Capability]:** [**Tally | ArbitrumDAO ARDC \\[Clawback Capability\\] 1**](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrumdao-ardc-clawback-capability)\n\n**In addition, after the ARDC Elections & thus, member appointment, the ARDC Multi-Sig members will utilise Hedgey to stream the respective funds to the elected members with the ArbitrumDAO being the Grant Admin thereof. The ArbitrumDAO’s Grant Admin role thus gives the DAO the ability to halt any streaming of funds to any member via governance.**\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Term]**\n\nThe duration of the ARDC’s mandate will be of 182 days \\[6 months] from the moment the on-chain proposal is approved. The ARDC may seek to identify and complete other initiatives for the ArbitrumDAO & the wider Arbitrum Ecosystem, depending on the changing needs of such ecosystem, at the discretion of the DAOAdvocate following consultation with the ArbitrumDAO via the ArbitrumDAO Forums.",

It will provide valuable tools and reports for proposal authors, helping them refine their ideas and make better-informed decisions.\n\n**Rationale** - the ARDC’s primary mandate aligns with the strategic priorities of the ArbitrumDAO, particularly in terms of governance optimization, risk management, research, and security. By funding the ARDC, the ArbitrumDAO can enhance its governance framework and future-proof the ecosystem through specialized verticals dedicated to these critical areas.\n\n**Steps to Implement** - Steps to Implement - The AIP will move to Snapshot on the 11th of December 2023. Following the conclusion of the Snapshot vote, the AIP will then proceed to the on-chain voting stage so as to ratify the funding & process for the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective. Once the forecited steps are concluded, [@Immutablelawyer](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/immutablelawyer) will be announcing the starting date of the election process.\n\n**Specifications & Timeline** - Specifications & timeline can be found in the following sections.\n\n**Total Cost -**&#x20;\n\n665,000 ARB \\[Security] \\[Applicable Cap]\n\n665,000 ARB \\[Research] \\[Applicable Cap]\n\n335,000 ARB \\[Risk] \\[Applicable Cap]\n\n50,000 ARB \\[DAOAdvocate]\n\n1,000 ARB \\[per signer - per month for the 6-month term] \\[Multi-Sig Budget]\n\n16,000 ARB - ImmutableLawyer \\[as retroactive payment for Research, draft and reviews of of the ARDC Proposal + Coordinating individually across stakeholders, community members & delegates] + management & administration of the pre-election application process & the election process itself until all members are appointed & the ARDC is fully operational. as envisaged in this proposal.\n\nTotal: 1,761,000 ARB\n\n**\\[Excess ARB which will not be utilised as a result of the elected members and their corresponding fees will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury]**\n\n***\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[ARDC]**\n\n**Non-Constitutional**\n\n*Defining ‘Arbitrum Research & Development Collective’ or ‘ARDC’: An alliance for combined action used to achieve a common goal in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO*\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.\n* This proposal intends on forking the Arbitrum Coalition proposal that was submitted & spearheaded by Blockworks Research, Gauntlet & Trail of Bits on the 25th of October 2023 ([Proposal: The Arbitrum Coalition 11](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-the-arbitrum-coalition/19145)). The proposal failed the Snapshot temperature check submitted on November 3rd 2023 ([Snapshot 7](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x42f68a26ff5a5be692a80468a1d1885cf07d590836536f5169cc4b69f64f3f37));\n* Alignment to the ArbitrumDAO Strategic Priorities:\n\n1. The ARDC’s mandate will naturally aid in ‘Governance Optimization’ through research & development of tooling related to the ArbitrumDAO’s governance framework.\n2. The ARDC’s mandate will aid in future-proofing the ArbitrumDAO by virtue of its member-specific verticals re. Risk, Research & Security.\n\n* This proposal intends on improving on the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by implementing an election mechanism to choose the service providers that may participate in the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* This proposal intends on implementing a set of legally enforceable checks & balances to regulate the internal operations of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* The ARDC will be made up of the following members \\[Subject to change following forum post feedback]: The DAOAdvocate, Risk Management-Oriented Members, Security-Oriented Members, Research-Oriented Members.\n* Fund the ARDC for a 6-month term.\n\n**Background - Perspective**\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition was an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aimed to execute turnkey R\\&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate was to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition would have provided the necessary resources so that the ArbitrumDAO can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition proposal received a lot of feedback from delegates, community members and contributors alike. In general, the general consensus was that the Arbitrum Coalition was a great theoretical idea & would have provided a great value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem. However, it lacked optimal execution in relation to its structural mechanics, especially mechanics re. the appointment & policing of service providers.\n\nThis proposal forks the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by iterating & optimizing on such proposal. Hence, certain parts of the proposal will be similar or identical.\n\n**The Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Why?]**\n\nThe Arbitrum forum is host to numerous commendable proposals, discussions & ideas. These Forum posts frequently lack the pre-requisite research, coordination, design, and risk evaluation mechanisms necessary for them to result in net-positive progress for the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\nFor instance, the iterative refinement of proposals, the cultivation of delegate awareness & participation at the Forum & voting stage, and the identification of suitable partners to execute an idea often present formidable challenges for proposers themselves (especially when they are newer entrants to the ArbitrumDAO). The primary mandate of the ARDC will be that of providing objective assessment of governance posts by distilling information and expediting governance decision-making; thereby enabling participants in the ArbitrumDAO to make better-informed choices.\n\nThe ARDC aims to possess unparalleled expertise by having an established dedicated team capable of executing this initiative. Ideally, all of the ARDC members would have made significant contributions to the ArbitrumDAO. The subject-matter areas that the ARDC Verticals aim to cater for include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Governance Proposals;\n* Research;\n* Framework Development;\n* Risk Assessment;\n* Secure Code Reviews;\n* Threat Modeling; and\n* Testing Enhancements.\n* Retroactive Analysis Of Passed Initiatives\n\nIn our opinion, the forecited subject-matter areas would provide the ArbitrumDAO with the necessary resources so as to ensure that ARDC members provide the ArbitrumDAO with a holistic execution of the ARDC mandate.\n\n**Mandate of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective (ARDC):**\n\n***Forum Proposal Review & Assistance:***\n\n* Objective Reporting: The impartial data-driven research conducted by ARDC aids delegates in making well-informed decisions by offering a comprehensive understanding of proposal contexts and competitive landscapes.\n* Proposal Improvement Tooling: These reports double as valuable tools for proposal authors, helping them enhance their work by incorporating feedback and addressing shortcomings. In this regard, the ARDC will serve as an assistant to proposers on an on-request basis to optimize & structure proposals that could prove to be a value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n***Review on Chain Proposal Code Updates:***\n\n* Enhanced Security: Through manual and automated code reviews, ARDC ensures a rigorous white-box security assessment, identifying design flaws and security issues, thus bolstering the integrity of the ecosystem.\n* Audit Executables (eg plutus dao community created staking contracts)\n\n***Quantitative Assistance:***\n\n* Quantitative Analysis: The ArbitrumDAO needs an element of quantitative rigor added to proposal evaluations, offering insights into economic risk, design optimization, and overall proposal viability.\n* Risk Mitigation: This service assists the ArbitrumDAO in identifying and mitigating economic risks associated with proposed initiatives, promoting sound decision-making.\n\n***Project Management \\[On a Request-Basis]:***\n\n* Efficient Coordination: The ARDC aims to assist in facilitating effective communication & management of proposals between the ArbitrumDAO, stakeholders, and service providers.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned services, the ARDC aims to offer the following benefits:\n\n***Tooling Creation and Enhancement:***\n\n* Security Enhancement: Developing and enhancing tools for security assessment strengthens the integrity of the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring proposal code updates meet stringent security standards.\n\n***Research New Mechanisms:***\n\n* Innovative Contributions: ARDC will objectively analyze and contributes to the development of innovative mechanisms, promoting data-driven decision-making and enhancing the ecosystem’s capabilities.\n\n***Delegate Engagement:***\n\n* Active Participation: ARDC’s processes incentivize delegates to actively contribute to proposal refinement, fostering a more engaged and collaborative governance community.\n\n***Growth Initiatives:***\n\n* Community Expansion: Through content creation, including podcasts, Twitter threads, and newsletters, ARDC attracts developers and users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, promoting growth and awareness.\n\nIn summary, the services provided by the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective(ARDC) serve to enhance governance decision-making, security, transparency, and community engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ultimately contributing to its continued growth and success.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective - Specifications of Verticals \\[Risk, Research, Security, DAOAdvocate]**\n\nThe ***DAOAdvocate***\n\nThe DAOAdvocate will be a single designated person (Legal/Natural) that will represent the ArbitrumDAO & maintains the ability to direct the ARDC’s efforts; Functions as the bridge between the ArbitrumDAO and the ARDC. The DAOAdvocate will be elected via Snapshot. The advocate will receive a stipend per month as per his ask in the application submitted to the DAO pre-election. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring that the Arbitrum DAO’s best interests are met by the ARDC & that the ARDC acts in accordance with its mandate & purposes.\n\nIf a member of the ARDC is deemed to have acted negligently, in bad faith, or contrary to the mandate/purposes of the ARDC as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO, the DAOAdvocate will have a legal obligation submit a proposal via Snapshot to terminate such a member of the ARDC together with the necessary details that justify such termination. Following this, the DAOAdvocate will have an ancillary legal obligation to submit a call for applications for the vacant ARDC seat. The decision as to who ought to take up the vacant seat will be determined by the ArbitrumDAO via the election mechanism stipulated in this Forum Post.\n\n***The Risk Member***\n\nThe Risk member should ideally possess a range of skills. This includes a strong quantitative background for conducting thorough reviews, research, and modeling or simulations related to economic risk, design, and optimization. The Risk member is to provide the ArbitrumDAO \\[through the ARDC] with a comprehensive knowledge-base in relation to digital asset-focused risk identification, risk assessment & risk mitigation. The Risk member should ideally have experience re. risk-focused design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic protocol health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights.\n\n***The Security Member***\n\nThe Security member should ideally possess skills in specific static analysis bug detection targeting code updates and developing fuzzing capabilities to validate upgrade states. They should be proficient in visualizing the state of governance contracts, ensuring correct encoding of values, and providing educational materials and guidelines for reviewing upgrade procedures. Additionally, they should have expertise in whitebox source code reviews, identifying design flaws, and ensuring security and correctness properties in on-chain upgrade proposals. This role is crucial for preventing governance attacks and may involve building tools and educational materials to support proposal reviews when no code review is required.\n\n***The Research Member***\n\nThe Research member should ideally possess a range of skills, including the ability to conduct objective analysis and contribute to the design of various mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, and data availability solutions, with a strong emphasis on objective data-driven research. They should also be proficient in creating processes that incentivize active delegate participation, such as developing delegate incentives frameworks and hosting regular collaborative calls. Additionally, they should be skilled in content creation to promote the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth. Moreover, the candidate should have a knack for producing impartial, data-driven research to aid delegates in making informed decisions and improving proposal quality. Excellent communication skills and the ability to manage interactions with DAO stakeholders and service providers are essential, along with the capacity to document ARDC activities and recommend solutions for any issues that arise, maintaining a governance process for continuity.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Elections]**\n\n[<img height=\"468\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed_2_624x468.png\" />1024×768 63.9 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed.png)\n\nWe propose adapting section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution & optimizing it to apply to the election for ARDC Members \\[REF: [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 3](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)].

(400 words max)\n\nFeel free to attach any relevant documents, portfolios, or links to previous work or contributions.\n\n**Checks & Balances**\n\nThe ARDC will be regulated via an Agreement entered into by all elected ARDC Members with the Arbitrum Foundation serving as a counterparty to the Agreement.\n\nThe Agreement will be made public & include, but will not be limited to the following provisions:\n\nAppointment & Termination: ARDC Members will be appointed via the forecited election process in accordance with ArbitrumDAO Consent by the Arbitrum Community.\n\n* Arbitrum Community will be defined as follows:\n\n*“Arbitrum Community” means those persons who have the right to propose and vote on proposals ergo, the token holders of the ARB token with the following contract address \\[0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548] from time to time visible at \\[*[*$2.03 | Arbitrum (ARB) Token Tracker | Arbiscan 1*](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x912ce59144191c1204e64559fe8253a0e49e6548#balances)*].*\n\n* ArbitrumDAO Consent will be defined as follows:\n\n*““ArbitrumDAO Consent” means a vote of the ArbitrumDAO Community in favour of a proposal satisfying the minimum requirements set forth at* [*The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 3*](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution) *(as such minimum requirements set forth therein on the date hereof may be revised from time to time with ArbitrumDAO Consent) taken by any of the following means:*\n\n*1.* [*Snapshot*](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth) *(or any successor thereto); or*\n\n*2. another mechanism, whether on or off a blockchain, that ensures only and all people voting hold or have been delegated blockchain-based tokens known as ARB.*\"\n\n**Conflict of Interest Provision**: ARDC Members will be bound to act in absolute good faith, utmost honesty, refraining from deriving unauthorized profits from their position & disclose conflicts of interest. ARDC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to the DAOAdvocate who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ARDC Member’s involvement in the task in relation to which such ARDC Member is conflicted.\n\nTo sum up, all ARDC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ARDC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.\n\n**Mandate & Purpose of the ARDC**: The ARDC members are pivotal in executing the purposes of the ARDC, ensuring that the activities thereof align with the ARDC’s objectives and the stipulations of ratified proposal. Here, it is also a role of the DAOAdvocate, to see that this is actually being done and that activities within the ARDC will actually further or are in conformity with the purposes outlined in the ratified proposal.\n\n**Record-keeping and Reporting**: Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ARDC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ARDC’S internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes taken by the DAOAdvocate. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ARDC Administration (such as which ARDC Member is working on which task & deadlines for the expected publication of tasks that fall in line with the purposes of the ARDC).\n\n**Duty of Impartiality**: ARDC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ARDC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.\n\n**Obligation of Recusal**: ARDC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project being reviewed by the ARDC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation and should vote Abstain if a proposal directly related to the ARDC is submitted. Additionally, ARDC members will abstain from commenting or voting on proposals made by any company that can be deemed a direct competitor.\n\n**Prohibition of Self-Dealing**: Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.\n\n**Ethical Trading**: Members are required to follow ethical trading standards in regard to ARB and any other relevant digital assets.\n\n**Operational parameters to be implemented**\n\n* Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;\n* Monthly report detailing performance of the ARDC;\n* Bi-weekly calls with the community in relation to the ARDC;\n* Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ARDC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.\n\nWe believe this eliminates information asymmetry while allowing ARDC members to conduct their work in the most efficient possible manner. For token holders and the community, they can quickly go to these operational dashboards and see ARDC progress. When research is released, it’s clearly defined who worked on it, amount of hours, and total project time.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Multi-Sig]**\n\nThe ARDC’s 3/5 multisig is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the ArbitrumDAO and the signers act as Multi-Sig administrators on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Signers will receive 1,000 ARB per month for their contribution. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in ArbitrumDAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes:\n\n* Sam \\[Gains Network]\n* Matt \\[StableLab]\n* ImmutableLawyer \\[Axis Advisory]\n* Max \\[Connext]\n* Brian \\[Gamma Strategies]\n\nThe ARDC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n* Streaming of funds to the multi-sig every second week for the ARDC’s term using Hedgey. The ArbitrumDAO will maintain control over this stream and have the ability to cut it off with an on-chain vote.\n* Clawback capability so the ArbitrumDAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement via an offchain vote.\n\n**The Multi-Sig will grant the ArbitrumDAO the function to clawback funds from the ARDC Multi-Sig via the Zodiac Governor Module via the created ArbitrumDAO ARDC \\[Clawback Capability]:** [**Tally | ArbitrumDAO ARDC \\[Clawback Capability\\]**](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrumdao-ardc-clawback-capability)\n\n**In addition, after the ARDC Elections & thus, member appointment, the ARDC Multi-Sig members will utilise Hedgey to stream the respective funds to the elected members with the ArbitrumDAO being the Grant Admin thereof. The ArbitrumDAO’s Grant Admin role thus gives the DAO the ability to halt any streaming of funds to any member via governance.**\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Term]**\n\nThe duration of the ARDC’s mandate will be of 182 days \\[6 months] from the moment the on-chain proposal is approved. The ARDC may seek to identify and complete other initiatives for the ArbitrumDAO & the wider Arbitrum Ecosystem, depending on the changing needs of such ecosystem, at the discretion of the DAOAdvocate following consultation with the ArbitrumDAO via the ArbitrumDAO Forums.",

      "content": "# Final Version with Option 2 (Karma)\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe introduce an Experimental Incentive System aimed at the ArbitrumDAO delegates with a duration of six months. The goal is to assess the incentives' impact on the delegates' active participation and involvement in the DAO's governance. *This proposal is subject to changes.*\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal is the final result of the proposal published and voted in favor of option 2 in snapshot. It contains some minor changes.\n\n* [Proposal: Experimental Incentive System for Active ArbitrumDAO Delegates](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-experimental-incentive-system-for-active-arbitrumdao-delegates/19467)\n* [Snapshots Voting: Option 2 - With Karma](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xef3ed3b3735cad375953947437980db576baebbba5a0c209b2cccabcb1c30740)\n\n# **Spec: Delegate Incentive System**\n\n## Duration of the Incentive System\n\nWe've allocated an initial trial period of 6 months. This timeframe should allow us to gather initial metrics to gauge the system's functionality and its anticipated impact.\n\n## Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives\n\nWe have set the number of eligible delegates to **50**. This figure isn't based on specific reasoning, but we believe it's a good starting point, these ranking is based on the score they achieve each month.\n\n## Funding\n\n* 1,500,000 ARB Incentives\n* 30,000 ARB Karma development\n* 20,000 ARB Admin costs\n* 30,000 ARB Multisig signers\n\n**Total costs: 1,580,000 ARB**\n\n## **Delegate Selection Process**\n\n### Requirements\n\nBased on the feedback received, we've opted for a single-tier instead of a multi-tiered program, allowing a wider array of participants, the requirements would be as follows:\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n> **Note:**\\* So following this model, the top fifty delegates - defined by their final score - within the range, would be compensated\\* The 5000 ARB per month is the max amount a delegate could earn, but this amount could be lower depending on their score.\\* Certain votes won't be counted towards the Tally Participation Rate, as detailed in the following links:1. [Core Test Proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/60371879178081104082641012273221287927865067413661362234634146098631763379427)1.

[\\[OLD\\] AIP-1.1 - Lockup, Budget, Transparency ](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/79904733039853333959339953965823982558487956291458141923259498272549038367575)\n\n### Incentive Program Application\n\nDelegates matching the requirements must confirm their participation in the Incentive System in the forum (a dedicated channel will be established for this). They must post using the template provided below, within a 14-day application window.\n\n**Incentive Program Confirmation Template:**\n\n* Forum Username (Link):\n* Twitter Profile (Link):\n* Snapshot Profile (Link):\n* Tally Profile with Exact All-time Participation Rate % (Link):\n\n> **Note:**\\* Failing to send a confirmation message will exclude you from the incentive system, regardless of eligibility.\\* Applicants should ensure accuracy in numbers and links, facilitating quicker verification.\n\n**Eligible delegates for the incentive program will be announced on the forum.**\n\n## Scoring and Framework\n\nTo determine which delegates will be paid monthly, we will use a point system and a framework. Please note that this framework will be developed by Karma. Delegates can track their activities using this template.\n\n![image](upload://jR5ofua1KGdUBlRqyh5OwcAlXCo.png)![](https://static.tally.xyz/e6a52900-773d-4b73-abee-6b68d095ce0b_original.png)\n\n[Framework - Experimental Incentive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTRXhxcw3o8RJYWw0Nvf48Ak0ihOe5kUJUcTWH0IDgg/edit#gid=374367862)\n\n### Details: Terminology, Symbols, and Formulas\n\nWe explain in detail the framework and points system:\n\n* **Delegates (DD):** Delegates with right to access to incentives\n* **Ranking (TOP):** Delegate's position in this Dune table <https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power>\n* **Funds ARB (FARB):** The amount of ARB allocated per month to the delegates' payment\n* **Activity Weight (%):** Represents the weight assigned to each key activity to be measured in delegates.\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20:** Percentage of the total participation of the member in votes. Karma pulls the participation activity directly from onchain transactions. This is the only parameter that is not reset monthly.\n    * **PR% formula: (PR \\* 20) / 100**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15:** Percentage of delegate participation in snapshot voting. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to snapshots for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted on in the month.\n    * **SV% formula: (SV(Rn) / SV(Tn)) \\* 15**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25:** Percentage of delegate participation in on-chain voting in Tally. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to Tally for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted in Tally in the month.\n    * **TV% formula: (TV(Rn) / TV(Tn)) \\* 25**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25:** Percentage of communication threads with the justification of the delegate's vote on the proposals sent to snapshots and Tally (if necessary if the vote does not change). This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of proposals that were submitted to a vote.\n    * **Rn:** Number of real communication rational threads where the delegate communicated and justified his/her decision.\n    * **CR% formula: (CR(Rn) / CR(Tn)) \\* 25**\n  * **Commenting Proposal (CP) - Weight 15:** Percentage of proposals where the delegate asked questions or generated important discussion for the advancement of the proposal. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of formal proposals posted on the forum.\n    * **Rn:** Number of actual proposals where the delegate made a genuine and quality contribution. Spam messages will not be considered.\n    * **CP% formula: (CP(Rn) / CP(Tn)) \\* 15**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP:** This parameter is extra. If the delegate makes a significant contribution to the DAO, he/she is automatically granted +40% extra TP. This parameter is at the discretion of the program administrator. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month\n* **Total Participation (TP):** Sum of the results of activities performed by the delegate. A TP% of 100 indicates full participation.\n  * **TP% formula: PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**\n* **Payment ARB (PARB):** Final amount of ARB that the delegate will receive based on his TP% and his position in the table.\n  * **PARB formula: IF(TP% >=100; 50000 ;(5000 \\* TP% / 100))**\n\n### Parameter summary\n\n* **Activity Weight (%):**\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20%**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Commenting Proposals (CP) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP (Total Participation)**\n* **Total Participation (TP):**\n  * **TP = PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + %CP + BP**\n\n### Weight and activity considerations\n\nThe activities that have been considered in shaping the framework and scope are measurable activities that we believe can positively impact governance.\n\nWe have distributed the weight according to the type of activity, as we believe this is the fairest way to do it at the moment.\n\n**Surely both the activities and the weightings are far from being the final parameters, ideally after these 6 months we should have a clear idea of how to modify certain parameters or which ones to add/remove.**\n\n> **Note:**\n> We have not included the governance call in the list of activities because we feel that it may be difficult for delegates in different time zones to attend because of the specific timing of the call. Plus some delegates might not want to dox their voices.\n\n### Total Participation (TP)\n\nThe 50 delegates who conclude the month with a **TP score of +60%** will be the ones to receive incentives based on the result provided by the **PARB** parameter.\n\nShould more than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only the top 50 scores will be selected.\n\nIf fewer than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only those meeting the criteria will be compensated\n\n> **Note:**\n> In the exceptional circumstance where scores are identical or more than 50 delegates exceed +90%, the entire month's budget may be distributed amongst all delegates with such scores. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\n### Bonus Point\n\nShould a delegate propose or actively participate in an enhancement proposal for Arbitrum DAO and execute it, like the [Arbitrum’s Short-Term Incentive Program (Arbitrum Improvement Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131)), they will be granted an additional +30% to their TP score for making a valuable contribution to the DAO. This could also be a governance process enhancement proposal or a template for grant selection.\n\nWe understand that this is one of the weakest points of the proposal and we believe it is very objective. To assess this point we will try to answer these questions\n\n* Is the proposal of interest to the ArbitrumDAO, does it cover any vertical that has not yet been worked on?\n* Is the proposal well described, does it have details of the objectives it wants to achieve?\n* Does the proposal generate debate among delegates, is there interest among DAO members (for or against) about the proposal?\n* Does the proposer exhaust existing resources to demonstrate that their proposal adds value to ArbitrumDAO (governance calls, responds in the governance forum, etc).\n* Was the proposal put to a vote: was it a close vote or a resounding no?\n\nWhen evaluating the bonus points we will try to answer these questions and the administrator will have to upload a post to the forum with the answer and a justification of why he/she grants the bonus point. We also look forward to hearing the community's opinion on the matter.\n\n### Parameter Snapshot\n\nWhen we refer to a month, we consider from the first day of the month 00:00 UTC to the last day 23:59hs UTC of each month. Within these days and hours, delegates have the opportunity to perform all actions to meet the parameters. The month's activities conclude on the last day of the month, so delegates must be punctual.\n\n### Incentive System Administrator Responsibilities\n\nOn the last day of each month, the incentive system administrator is responsible for collecting and carefully reviewing the data provided by Karma. During this initial stage, several inconsistencies are likely to be identified and corrected. Subsequently, the administrator should announce on the forum the names of the delegates selected to receive incentives, as well as the amounts allocated to each. This procedure must be completed within 10 days.\n\nAfter the publication of these results, the delegates will have a period of 2 days to present any dispute, in case they disagree with the amounts or the selection made.\n\n### Dispute\n\nDelegates have a 2-day window to dispute if they disagree with the results presented by the Incentive System Administrator.\n\nTo raise a dispute, they must do so via a forum post with the following template:\n\n* Title: Dispute\n* Username\n* Reason for dispute (be detailed)\n\nThe system administrator must promptly address the issue, resolving it within a maximum of 2 days.\n\n#### Incentive System Ban\n\nShould a delegate or any community member attempt to deceive or game the incentive system, they will be banned. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\nWe must remember that this system is experimental, and we hope for community members' cooperation for its success.\n\n### Payment Execution\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the delegate payments are expected to be executed from the programs multisig, with full details of the payments posted on the forum, between the 13th and 14th. This will be repeated for the duration of the program.\n**Payments are made in ARB tokens.**\n\n## Incentive system administrator\n\nGiven the short duration of the program and the lack of a DAO Facilitator, SEED Latam is willing to assume the administration of this program. This means that our delegation won't participate in it and that the administration won't be carried out by myself, but by the organization SEED Latam.\n\nHowever, we're also open to a group of delegates or potentially a third party administering this program, in which case we would obviously provide any assistance necessary.\n\nFor the administration of said program, the budget would be 20,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and it will be managed from the DAOs multisig.\n\n***\n\n# **Karma automation for the delegate incentive program**\n\n### Features summary\n\nKarma will develop features to enhance administrator efficiency and provide transparency to the Arbitrum community. They have committed themselves to incorporating any modification to the dashboard, understanding the experimental nature of this program. The features that will be built include:\n\n1. Automated fetching of all delegates with Voting Power (VP) over 50k, along with their details.\n2. Profile display for each delegate, showing their voting history and voting reasons they post on Snapshot, Tally or Forum.\n3. Calculation and display of PR, SV, TV, CR, CP (TBD if CP can be automated) for each delegate as specified in the proposal.\n   **Karma will implement automatically fetching delegates’ forum data**\n4. Functionality for the Administrator to allocate Bonus Points.\n5. Computation and presentation of the final Total Points (TP) and PARBB for each delegate on: `arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation`.\n\n**This automation eliminates the need for delegates to manually report their monthly activities.**\n\n### Timeline\n\n* **Week 1:** Collaborating with administrators and community members to finalize the project requirements.\n* **Weeks 2 and 3:** Initiating the sprint to design and develop all the features\n* **Week 4:** The product will undergo comprehensive end-to-end testing and be deployed to production. At this stage, the community will gain full access to all features.\n* **Week 5 and Beyond:** Implementation of bug fixes and enhancements based on insights and feedback gathered.\n\n### Payment Schedule\n\n* **Payment 1:** 10k ARB when the proposal passes and the project is kicked off.\n* **Payment 2:** 10K ARB on the successful launch of the product (After week 4 per the timeline above)\n* **Payment 3:** 10K ARB 2 months after launch as we continue to fix bugs and make enhancements (week 12 of program kickoff)\n\n**Karma payments will also be executed from the DAO and tracked by the program administrator.**\n\n## Multisig Management\n\nSince it would be very complicated to KYC 50 delegates (or more) for this program, and following the Foundation's recommendation, we're going to proceed with a multisig to manage payments.\n\nWe propose to use a configuration similar to that of [Plurality Labs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-3-non-constitutional-fund-the-arbitrum-grants-framework-proposal-milestone-1/14976#multisig-management-13). Having a 3/5 multisig where apart from myself, there would be a mix of DAO delegates + contributors, each receiving a 1,000 ARB payment per month for the duration of the program and said signers would be required to undergo a KYC process.\n\n#### Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module\n\n* DAO can clawback funds from multisig directly to its treasury with a vote\n* Protects from a corrupted set of multisig signers\n* This multisig will be configured with a Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module looking at the Arbitrum token contract. This means that the DAO can at any point reclaim the funds in this multisig with a vote on Tally.\n\n#### Signatories\n\nWe propose that the signatories be:\n\n* @Frisson\n* @dk3\n* @JoJo\n* @0xWenMoon\n* @cattin\n\n## **SEED Latam Commitment**\n\nSeed Latam is committed to monitoring the proper functioning of Karma and collecting feedback from the community on the dashboard's performance. We also commit to collaborating with Karma so that the dashboard meets the needs of the incentive system.\n\nWe will also assume the responsibilities of the incentive system administrator, as mentioned in the previous points.\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nSEED Latam does not have any commercial relationship with Karma, nor does it receive any payment from them for incorporating them into this proposal.\n\nThe only link between SEED Latam and Karma is that both want the success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n# Overview\n\n**Duration of the incentive system**\n\n* 6 month\n\n**Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives**\n\n* 50 delegates\n\n**Selection process**\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n*Eligible delegates must confirm their participation in the incentive system by posting a message on the forum.*\n\n## Key Points\n\n**Scoring**\n\n* Karma Delegate Dashboard\n\n**Minimum score to receive incentives**\n\n* TP= +60%\n\n**Bonus Point**\n\n* +30% TP\n\n**Parameter Snapshot**\n\n* Last day of the month 23:59 UTC\n\n**Dispute**\n\n* 2 days\n\n**Payments**\n\n* On the 13th-14th of each month from the multisig.\n\n**Incentive system administrator**\n\n* SEED Latam / Any delegate or entity willing to collaborate\n\n### Total Cost: 1,580,000\n\n* 1,500,000 ARB Incentives\n* 30,000 ARB Karma development\n* 20,000 ARB Admin costs\n* 30,000 ARB Multisig signers\n\n> **Note**\n> Costs may vary since we probably won't give the max amount to every delegate every month, so the cost mentioned would be the max this program would cost assuming we compensate 50 delegates per month for 6 months with the maximum allocation.\n\n## Reports\n\nSEEDLatam commits to delivering two reports, one after the third month and one after the sixth (and final) month of the program with metrics on its impact, delegates' performance, and expenditures. They will also collect feedback from both the community and participating delegates.\n\n*The reports will be a detailed forum post and also accompanied by a community call explaining the metrics and feedback collected.*\n\n**ArbitrumDAO has the power to:**\n\n* Change the direction or parameters of the program when it deems necessary, with a snapshot vote.\n* Terminate the program at any time, with a snapshot vote.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nPlease note that this initial incentive system is experimental and is not intended to be the final version. With this initiative, we aim to evaluate the performance of the DAO and determine its impact. We also anticipate collaboration from both the DAO and facilitators to ensure its success.\n\nAt the end of the six months, SEED Latam commits to delivering a report containing the gathered data and feedback from the governance.\n\n## Modifications introduced post-snapshot\n\n* Karma integration (since option 2 won)\n* One additional parameter to include forum activity\n* Multisig since it would be operationally unviable to KYC every delegate",

      "content": "This is a non-constitutional proposal.&#x20;\n\n**Amendments in light of community feedback:**\n\n* Standard 50,000ARB for the DAOAdvocate role due to the important nature of the role re. the ARDC.\n\n**Abstract** - This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.\n\n**Motivation** - The ARDC’s role in reviewing and enhancing governance proposals, conducting code reviews for security, providing quantitative analysis for economic risk, and fostering active delegate engagement will contribute significantly to the growth and success of the Arbitrum ecosystem. It will provide valuable tools and reports for proposal authors, helping them refine their ideas and make better-informed decisions.\n\n**Rationale** - the ARDC’s primary mandate aligns with the strategic priorities of the ArbitrumDAO, particularly in terms of governance optimization, risk management, research, and security. By funding the ARDC, the ArbitrumDAO can enhance its governance framework and future-proof the ecosystem through specialized verticals dedicated to these critical areas.\n\n**Steps to Implement** - Steps to Implement - The AIP will move to Snapshot on the 11th of December 2023. Following the conclusion of the Snapshot vote, the AIP will then proceed to the on-chain voting stage so as to ratify the funding & process for the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective. Once the forecited steps are concluded, [@Immutablelawyer](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/immutablelawyer) will be announcing the starting date of the election process.\n\n**Specifications & Timeline** - Specifications & timeline can be found in the following sections.\n\n**Overall Cost** - Fund the ARDC with 1.715 Million ARB + Multi-Sig Budget for a 6-Month Term.\n\nTotal: 1,761,000 ARB\n\n* 665,000 ARB \\[Research] \\[Applicable Cap]\n* 335,000 ARB \\[Risk] \\[Applicable Cap]\n* 50,000 ARB \\[DAOAdvocate]\n* 5,000 ARB per month - Multi-Sig members\n* 16.0000 ARB - ImmutableLawyer \\[as retroactive payment for Research, draft and reviews of of the ARDC Proposal + Coordinating individually across stakeholders, community members & delegates] + management & administration of the pre-election application process & the election process itself until all members are appointed & the ARDC is fully operational. as envisaged in this proposal.\n\n**\\[Excess ARB which will not be utilised as a result of the elected members and their corresponding fees will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury]**\n\n***\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[ARDC]**\n\n**Non-Constitutional**\n\n*Defining ‘Arbitrum Research & Development Collective’ or ‘ARDC’: An alliance for combined action used to achieve a common goal in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO*\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.\n* This proposal intends on forking the Arbitrum Coalition proposal that was submitted & spearheaded by Blockworks Research, Gauntlet & Trail of Bits on the 25th of October 2023 ([Proposal: The Arbitrum Coalition 11](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-the-arbitrum-coalition/19145)). The proposal failed the Snapshot temperature check submitted on November 3rd 2023 ([Snapshot 7](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x42f68a26ff5a5be692a80468a1d1885cf07d590836536f5169cc4b69f64f3f37));\n* Alignment to the ArbitrumDAO Strategic Priorities:\n\n1. The ARDC’s mandate will naturally aid in ‘Governance Optimization’ through research & development of tooling related to the ArbitrumDAO’s governance framework.\n2. The ARDC’s mandate will aid in future-proofing the ArbitrumDAO by virtue of its member-specific verticals re. Risk, Research & Security.\n\n* This proposal intends on improving on the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by implementing an election mechanism to choose the service providers that may participate in the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* This proposal intends on implementing a set of legally enforceable checks & balances to regulate the internal operations of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* The ARDC will be made up of the following members \\[Subject to change following forum post feedback]: The DAOAdvocate, Risk Management-Oriented Members, Security-Oriented Members, Research-Oriented Members.\n* Fund the ARDC for a 6-month term.\n\n**Background - Perspective**\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition was an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aimed to execute turnkey R\\&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate was to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition would have provided the necessary resources so that the ArbitrumDAO can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition proposal received a lot of feedback from delegates, community members and contributors alike. In general, the general consensus was that the Arbitrum Coalition was a great theoretical idea & would have provided a great value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem. However, it lacked optimal execution in relation to its structural mechanics, especially mechanics re. the appointment & policing of service providers.\n\nThis proposal forks the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by iterating & optimizing on such proposal. Hence, certain parts of the proposal will be similar or identical.\n\n**The Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Why?]**\n\nThe Arbitrum forum is host to numerous commendable proposals, discussions & ideas. These Forum posts frequently lack the pre-requisite research, coordination, design, and risk evaluation mechanisms necessary for them to result in net-positive progress for the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\nFor instance, the iterative refinement of proposals, the cultivation of delegate awareness & participation at the Forum & voting stage, and the identification of suitable partners to execute an idea often present formidable challenges for proposers themselves (especially when they are newer entrants to the ArbitrumDAO). The primary mandate of the ARDC will be that of providing objective assessment of governance posts by distilling information and expediting governance decision-making; thereby enabling participants in the ArbitrumDAO to make better-informed choices.\n\nThe ARDC aims to possess unparalleled expertise by having an established dedicated team capable of executing this initiative. Ideally, all of the ARDC members would have made significant contributions to the ArbitrumDAO. The subject-matter areas that the ARDC Verticals aim to cater for include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Governance Proposals;\n* Research;\n* Framework Development;\n* Risk Assessment;\n* Secure Code Reviews;\n* Threat Modeling; and\n* Testing Enhancements.\n* Retroactive Analysis Of Passed Initiatives\n\nIn our opinion, the forecited subject-matter areas would provide the ArbitrumDAO with the necessary resources so as to ensure that ARDC members provide the ArbitrumDAO with a holistic execution of the ARDC mandate.\n\n**Mandate of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective (ARDC):**\n\n***Forum Proposal Review & Assistance:***\n\n* Objective Reporting: The impartial data-driven research conducted by ARDC aids delegates in making well-informed decisions by offering a comprehensive understanding of proposal contexts and competitive landscapes.\n* Proposal Improvement Tooling: These reports double as valuable tools for proposal authors, helping them enhance their work by incorporating feedback and addressing shortcomings. In this regard, the ARDC will serve as an assistant to proposers on an on-request basis to optimize & structure proposals that could prove to be a value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n***Review on Chain Proposal Code Updates:***\n\n* Enhanced Security: Through manual and automated code reviews, ARDC ensures a rigorous white-box security assessment, identifying design flaws and security issues, thus bolstering the integrity of the ecosystem.\n* Audit Executables (eg plutus dao community created staking contracts)\n\n***Quantitative Assistance:***\n\n* Quantitative Analysis: The ArbitrumDAO needs an element of quantitative rigor added to proposal evaluations, offering insights into economic risk, design optimization, and overall proposal viability.\n* Risk Mitigation: This service assists the ArbitrumDAO in identifying and mitigating economic risks associated with proposed initiatives, promoting sound decision-making.\n\n***Project Management \\[On a Request-Basis]:***\n\n* Efficient Coordination: The ARDC aims to assist in facilitating effective communication & management of proposals between the ArbitrumDAO, stakeholders, and service providers.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned services, the ARDC aims to offer the following benefits:\n\n***Tooling Creation and Enhancement:***\n\n* Security Enhancement: Developing and enhancing tools for security assessment strengthens the integrity of the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring proposal code updates meet stringent security standards.\n\n***Research New Mechanisms:***\n\n* Innovative Contributions: ARDC will objectively analyze and contributes to the development of innovative mechanisms, promoting data-driven decision-making and enhancing the ecosystem’s capabilities.\n\n***Delegate Engagement:***\n\n* Active Participation: ARDC’s processes incentivize delegates to actively contribute to proposal refinement, fostering a more engaged and collaborative governance community.\n\n***Growth Initiatives:***\n\n* Community Expansion: Through content creation, including podcasts, Twitter threads, and newsletters, ARDC attracts developers and users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, promoting growth and awareness.\n\nIn summary, the services provided by the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective(ARDC) serve to enhance governance decision-making, security, transparency, and community engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ultimately contributing to its continued growth and success.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective - Specifications of Verticals \\[Risk, Research, Security, DAOAdvocate]**\n\nThe ***DAOAdvocate***\n\nThe DAOAdvocate will be a single designated person (Legal/Natural) that will represent the ArbitrumDAO & maintains the ability to direct the ARDC’s efforts; Functions as the bridge between the ArbitrumDAO and the ARDC. The DAOAdvocate will be elected via Snapshot. The advocate will receive a stipend per month as per his ask in the application submitted to the DAO pre-election. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring that the Arbitrum DAO’s best interests are met by the ARDC & that the ARDC acts in accordance with its mandate & purposes.\n\nIf a member of the ARDC is deemed to have acted negligently, in bad faith, or contrary to the mandate/purposes of the ARDC as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO, the DAOAdvocate will have a legal obligation submit a proposal via Snapshot to terminate such a member of the ARDC together with the necessary details that justify such termination. Following this, the DAOAdvocate will have an ancillary legal obligation to submit a call for applications for the vacant ARDC seat. The decision as to who ought to take up the vacant seat will be determined by the ArbitrumDAO via the election mechanism stipulated in this Forum Post.\n\n***The Risk Member***\n\nThe Risk member should ideally possess a range of skills. This includes a strong quantitative background for conducting thorough reviews, research, and modeling or simulations related to economic risk, design, and optimization. The Risk member is to provide the ArbitrumDAO \\[through the ARDC] with a comprehensive knowledge-base in relation to digital asset-focused risk identification, risk assessment & risk mitigation. The Risk member should ideally have experience re. risk-focused design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic protocol health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights.\n\n***The Security Member***\n\nThe Security member should ideally possess skills in specific static analysis bug detection targeting code updates and developing fuzzing capabilities to validate upgrade states. They should be proficient in visualizing the state of governance contracts, ensuring correct encoding of values, and providing educational materials and guidelines for reviewing upgrade procedures. Additionally, they should have expertise in whitebox source code reviews, identifying design flaws, and ensuring security and correctness properties in on-chain upgrade proposals. This role is crucial for preventing governance attacks and may involve building tools and educational materials to support proposal reviews when no code review is required.\n\n***The Research Member***\n\nThe Research member should ideally possess a range of skills, including the ability to conduct objective analysis and contribute to the design of various mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, and data availability solutions, with a strong emphasis on objective data-driven research. They should also be proficient in creating processes that incentivize active delegate participation, such as developing delegate incentives frameworks and hosting regular collaborative calls. Additionally, they should be skilled in content creation to promote the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth. Moreover, the candidate should have a knack for producing impartial, data-driven research to aid delegates in making informed decisions and improving proposal quality. Excellent communication skills and the ability to manage interactions with DAO stakeholders and service providers are essential, along with the capacity to document ARDC activities and recommend solutions for any issues that arise, maintaining a governance process for continuity.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Elections]**\n\n[<img height=\"468\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed_2_624x468.png\" />1024×768 63.9 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed.png)\n\nWe propose adapting section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution & optimizing it to apply to the election for ARDC Members \\[REF: [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 3](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)].

ARDC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ARDC’S internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes taken by the DAOAdvocate. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ARDC Administration (such as which ARDC Member is working on which task & deadlines for the expected publication of tasks that fall in line with the purposes of the ARDC).\n\n**Duty of Impartiality**: ARDC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ARDC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.\n\n**Obligation of Recusal**: ARDC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project being reviewed by the ARDC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation and should vote Abstain if a proposal directly related to the ARDC is submitted. Additionally, ARDC members will abstain from commenting or voting on proposals made by any company that can be deemed a direct competitor.\n\n**Prohibition of Self-Dealing**: Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.\n\n**Ethical Trading**: Members are required to follow ethical trading standards in regard to ARB and any other relevant digital assets.\n\n**Operational parameters to be implemented**\n\n* Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;\n* Monthly report detailing performance of the ARDC;\n* Bi-weekly calls with the community in relation to the ARDC;\n* Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ARDC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.\n\nWe believe this eliminates information asymmetry while allowing ARDC members to conduct their work in the most efficient possible manner. For token holders and the community, they can quickly go to these operational dashboards and see ARDC progress. When research is released, it’s clearly defined who worked on it, amount of hours, and total project time.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Multi-Sig]**\n\nThe ARDC’s 3/5 multisig is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the ArbitrumDAO and the signers act as Multi-Sig administrators on behalf of the ArbitrumDAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Signers will receive 1,000 ARB per month for their contribution. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in ArbitrumDAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes:\n\n* Sam \\[Gains Network]\n* Matt \\[StableLab]\n* ImmutableLawyer \\[Axis Advisory]\n* Max \\[Connext]\n* Brian \\[Gamma Strategies]\n\nThe ARDC multisig includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n* Streaming of funds to the multi-sig every second week for the ARDC’s term using Hedgey. The ArbitrumDAO will maintain control over this stream and have the ability to cut it off with an on-chain vote.\n* Clawback capability so the ArbitrumDAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement via an offchain vote.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Term]**\n\nThe duration of the ARDC’s mandate will be of 182 days \\[6 months] from the moment the on-chain proposal is approved. The ARDC may seek to identify and complete other initiatives for the ArbitrumDAO & the wider Arbitrum Ecosystem, depending on the changing needs of such ecosystem, at the discretion of the DAOAdvocate following consultation with the ArbitrumDAO via the ArbitrumDAO Forums.",

      "content": "**Amendments in light of community feedback:**\n\n* Standard 50,000ARB for the DAOAdvocate role due to the important nature of the role re. the ARDC.\n\n**Abstract** - This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.\n\n**Motivation** - The ARDC’s role in reviewing and enhancing governance proposals, conducting code reviews for security, providing quantitative analysis for economic risk, and fostering active delegate engagement will contribute significantly to the growth and success of the Arbitrum ecosystem. It will provide valuable tools and reports for proposal authors, helping them refine their ideas and make better-informed decisions.\n\n**Rationale** - the ARDC’s primary mandate aligns with the strategic priorities of the ArbitrumDAO, particularly in terms of governance optimization, risk management, research, and security. By funding the ARDC, the ArbitrumDAO can enhance its governance framework and future-proof the ecosystem through specialized verticals dedicated to these critical areas.\n\n**Steps to Implement** - Steps to Implement - The AIP will move to Snapshot on the 11th of December 2023. Following the conclusion of the Snapshot vote, the AIP will then proceed to the on-chain voting stage so as to ratify the funding & process for the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective. Once the forecited steps are concluded, [@Immutablelawyer](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/immutablelawyer) will be announcing the starting date of the election process.\n\n**Specifications & Timeline** - Specifications & timeline can be found in the following sections.\n\n**Overall Cost** - Fund the ARDC with 1.715 Million ARB + Multi-Sig Budget for a 6-Month Term.\n\nTotal: 1,761,000 ARB\n\n* 665,000 ARB \\[Research] \\[Applicable Cap]\n* 335,000 ARB \\[Risk] \\[Applicable Cap]\n* 50,000 ARB \\[DAOAdvocate]\n* 5,000 ARB per month - Multi-Sig members\n* 16.0000 ARB - ImmutableLawyer \\[as retroactive payment for Research, draft and reviews of of the ARDC Proposal + Coordinating individually across stakeholders, community members & delegates] + management & administration of the pre-election application process & the election process itself until all members are appointed & the ARDC is fully operational. as envisaged in this proposal.\n\n**\\[Excess ARB which will not be utilised as a result of the elected members and their corresponding fees will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO Treasury]**\n\n***\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[ARDC]**\n\n**Non-Constitutional**\n\n*Defining ‘Arbitrum Research & Development Collective’ or ‘ARDC’: An alliance for combined action used to achieve a common goal in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO*\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* This proposal aims to fund the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 6 months.\n* This proposal intends on forking the Arbitrum Coalition proposal that was submitted & spearheaded by Blockworks Research, Gauntlet & Trail of Bits on the 25th of October 2023 ([Proposal: The Arbitrum Coalition 11](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-the-arbitrum-coalition/19145)). The proposal failed the Snapshot temperature check submitted on November 3rd 2023 ([Snapshot 7](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x42f68a26ff5a5be692a80468a1d1885cf07d590836536f5169cc4b69f64f3f37));\n* Alignment to the ArbitrumDAO Strategic Priorities:\n\n1. The ARDC’s mandate will naturally aid in ‘Governance Optimization’ through research & development of tooling related to the ArbitrumDAO’s governance framework.\n2. The ARDC’s mandate will aid in future-proofing the ArbitrumDAO by virtue of its member-specific verticals re. Risk, Research & Security.\n\n* This proposal intends on improving on the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by implementing an election mechanism to choose the service providers that may participate in the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* This proposal intends on implementing a set of legally enforceable checks & balances to regulate the internal operations of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective;\n* The ARDC will be made up of the following members \\[Subject to change following forum post feedback]: The DAOAdvocate, Risk Management-Oriented Members, Security-Oriented Members, Research-Oriented Members.\n* Fund the ARDC for a 6-month term.\n\n**Background - Perspective**\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition was an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aimed to execute turnkey R\\&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate was to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition would have provided the necessary resources so that the ArbitrumDAO can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition proposal received a lot of feedback from delegates, community members and contributors alike. In general, the general consensus was that the Arbitrum Coalition was a great theoretical idea & would have provided a great value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem. However, it lacked optimal execution in relation to its structural mechanics, especially mechanics re. the appointment & policing of service providers.\n\nThis proposal forks the Arbitrum Coalition proposal by iterating & optimizing on such proposal. Hence, certain parts of the proposal will be similar or identical.\n\n**The Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Why?]**\n\nThe Arbitrum forum is host to numerous commendable proposals, discussions & ideas. These Forum posts frequently lack the pre-requisite research, coordination, design, and risk evaluation mechanisms necessary for them to result in net-positive progress for the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\nFor instance, the iterative refinement of proposals, the cultivation of delegate awareness & participation at the Forum & voting stage, and the identification of suitable partners to execute an idea often present formidable challenges for proposers themselves (especially when they are newer entrants to the ArbitrumDAO). The primary mandate of the ARDC will be that of providing objective assessment of governance posts by distilling information and expediting governance decision-making; thereby enabling participants in the ArbitrumDAO to make better-informed choices.\n\nThe ARDC aims to possess unparalleled expertise by having an established dedicated team capable of executing this initiative. Ideally, all of the ARDC members would have made significant contributions to the ArbitrumDAO. The subject-matter areas that the ARDC Verticals aim to cater for include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Governance Proposals;\n* Research;\n* Framework Development;\n* Risk Assessment;\n* Secure Code Reviews;\n* Threat Modeling; and\n* Testing Enhancements.\n* Retroactive Analysis Of Passed Initiatives\n\nIn our opinion, the forecited subject-matter areas would provide the ArbitrumDAO with the necessary resources so as to ensure that ARDC members provide the ArbitrumDAO with a holistic execution of the ARDC mandate.\n\n**Mandate of the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective (ARDC):**\n\n***Forum Proposal Review & Assistance:***\n\n* Objective Reporting: The impartial data-driven research conducted by ARDC aids delegates in making well-informed decisions by offering a comprehensive understanding of proposal contexts and competitive landscapes.\n* Proposal Improvement Tooling: These reports double as valuable tools for proposal authors, helping them enhance their work by incorporating feedback and addressing shortcomings. In this regard, the ARDC will serve as an assistant to proposers on an on-request basis to optimize & structure proposals that could prove to be a value-add to the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n***Review on Chain Proposal Code Updates:***\n\n* Enhanced Security: Through manual and automated code reviews, ARDC ensures a rigorous white-box security assessment, identifying design flaws and security issues, thus bolstering the integrity of the ecosystem.\n* Audit Executables (eg plutus dao community created staking contracts)\n\n***Quantitative Assistance:***\n\n* Quantitative Analysis: The ArbitrumDAO needs an element of quantitative rigor added to proposal evaluations, offering insights into economic risk, design optimization, and overall proposal viability.\n* Risk Mitigation: This service assists the ArbitrumDAO in identifying and mitigating economic risks associated with proposed initiatives, promoting sound decision-making.\n\n***Project Management \\[On a Request-Basis]:***\n\n* Efficient Coordination: The ARDC aims to assist in facilitating effective communication & management of proposals between the ArbitrumDAO, stakeholders, and service providers.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned services, the ARDC aims to offer the following benefits:\n\n***Tooling Creation and Enhancement:***\n\n* Security Enhancement: Developing and enhancing tools for security assessment strengthens the integrity of the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring proposal code updates meet stringent security standards.\n\n***Research New Mechanisms:***\n\n* Innovative Contributions: ARDC will objectively analyze and contributes to the development of innovative mechanisms, promoting data-driven decision-making and enhancing the ecosystem’s capabilities.\n\n***Delegate Engagement:***\n\n* Active Participation: ARDC’s processes incentivize delegates to actively contribute to proposal refinement, fostering a more engaged and collaborative governance community.\n\n***Growth Initiatives:***\n\n* Community Expansion: Through content creation, including podcasts, Twitter threads, and newsletters, ARDC attracts developers and users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, promoting growth and awareness.\n\nIn summary, the services provided by the Arbitrum Research & Development Collective(ARDC) serve to enhance governance decision-making, security, transparency, and community engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ultimately contributing to its continued growth and success.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective - Specifications of Verticals \\[Risk, Research, Security, DAOAdvocate]**\n\nThe ***DAOAdvocate***\n\nThe DAOAdvocate will be a single designated person (Legal/Natural) that will represent the ArbitrumDAO & maintains the ability to direct the ARDC’s efforts; Functions as the bridge between the ArbitrumDAO and the ARDC. The DAOAdvocate will be elected via Snapshot. The advocate will receive a stipend per month as per his ask in the application submitted to the DAO pre-election. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring that the Arbitrum DAO’s best interests are met by the ARDC & that the ARDC acts in accordance with its mandate & purposes.\n\nIf a member of the ARDC is deemed to have acted negligently, in bad faith, or contrary to the mandate/purposes of the ARDC as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO, the DAOAdvocate will have a legal obligation submit a proposal via Snapshot to terminate such a member of the ARDC together with the necessary details that justify such termination. Following this, the DAOAdvocate will have an ancillary legal obligation to submit a call for applications for the vacant ARDC seat. The decision as to who ought to take up the vacant seat will be determined by the ArbitrumDAO via the election mechanism stipulated in this Forum Post.\n\n***The Risk Member***\n\nThe Risk member should ideally possess a range of skills. This includes a strong quantitative background for conducting thorough reviews, research, and modeling or simulations related to economic risk, design, and optimization. The Risk member is to provide the ArbitrumDAO \\[through the ARDC] with a comprehensive knowledge-base in relation to digital asset-focused risk identification, risk assessment & risk mitigation. The Risk member should ideally have experience re. risk-focused design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic protocol health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights.\n\n***The Security Member***\n\nThe Security member should ideally possess skills in specific static analysis bug detection targeting code updates and developing fuzzing capabilities to validate upgrade states. They should be proficient in visualizing the state of governance contracts, ensuring correct encoding of values, and providing educational materials and guidelines for reviewing upgrade procedures. Additionally, they should have expertise in whitebox source code reviews, identifying design flaws, and ensuring security and correctness properties in on-chain upgrade proposals. This role is crucial for preventing governance attacks and may involve building tools and educational materials to support proposal reviews when no code review is required.\n\n***The Research Member***\n\nThe Research member should ideally possess a range of skills, including the ability to conduct objective analysis and contribute to the design of various mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, and data availability solutions, with a strong emphasis on objective data-driven research. They should also be proficient in creating processes that incentivize active delegate participation, such as developing delegate incentives frameworks and hosting regular collaborative calls. Additionally, they should be skilled in content creation to promote the Arbitrum ecosystem’s growth. Moreover, the candidate should have a knack for producing impartial, data-driven research to aid delegates in making informed decisions and improving proposal quality. Excellent communication skills and the ability to manage interactions with DAO stakeholders and service providers are essential, along with the capacity to document ARDC activities and recommend solutions for any issues that arise, maintaining a governance process for continuity.\n\n**Arbitrum Research & Development Collective \\[Elections]**\n\n[<img height=\"468\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed_2_624x468.png\" />1024×768 63.9 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/1/1834b50612c4477ebb6c860b1425b215308dd3ed.png)\n\nWe propose adapting section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution & optimizing it to apply to the election for ARDC Members \\[REF: [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 3](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)].

ARDC members should always disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interests to the DAOAdvocate who will then proceed to mitigate the respective ARDC Member’s involvement in the task in relation to which such ARDC Member is conflicted.\n\nTo sum up, all ARDC Members must declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which the ARDC Member is aware that she, he or it has in a proposed task at hand.\n\n**Mandate & Purpose of the ARDC**: The ARDC members are pivotal in executing the purposes of the ARDC, ensuring that the activities thereof align with the ARDC’s objectives and the stipulations of ratified proposal. Here, it is also a role of the DAOAdvocate, to see that this is actually being done and that activities within the ARDC will actually further or are in conformity with the purposes outlined in the ratified proposal.\n\n**Record-keeping and Reporting**: Comprehensive and precise record-keeping is imperative. ARDC Members will be required to maintain detailed accounts and documentation of the ARDC’S internal operational workflow together with meeting minutes taken by the DAOAdvocate. Furthermore, periodic reporting is essential so as to keep the ArbitrumDAO updated re. Task-specific progress & internal ARDC Administration (such as which ARDC Member is working on which task & deadlines for the expected publication of tasks that fall in line with the purposes of the ARDC).\n\n**Duty of Impartiality**: ARDC Members will have an obligation to act in an impartial manner in relation to their tasks & workflow, ensuring that the ARDC is not compromised by personal interests or external influences.\n\n**Obligation of Recusal**: ARDC Members with a conflict of interest involving a project being reviewed by the ARDC should recuse themselves from participating in the evaluation and should vote Abstain if a proposal directly related to the ARDC is submitted. Additionally, ARDC members will abstain from commenting or voting on proposals made by any company that can be deemed a direct competitor.\n\n**Prohibition of Self-Dealing**: Participants should refrain from voting on sending funds to themselves or organizations where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their other projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.\n\n**Ethical Trading**: Members are required to follow ethical trading standards in regard to ARB and any other relevant digital assets.\n\n**Operational parameters to be implemented**\n\n* Meeting minutes will be taken for every meeting and published on a public Notion site for review by the ArbitrumDAO;\n* Monthly report detailing performance of the ARDC;\n* Bi-weekly calls with the community in relation to the ARDC;\n* Public Asana/Airtable dashboard to be utilized by ARDC members to submit updates on specific tasks and sub-tasks and thus, keeping the ArbitrumDAO in the loop.\n\nWe believe this eliminates information asymmetry while allowing ARDC members to conduct their work in the most efficient possible manner.

Signers cannot be Procurement Committee members.\n* Streaming of funds and clawback capabilities are implemented for multisig accountability.\n* The ADPC will be regulated via an Agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation.\n* The Agreement will cover appointment, conflict of interest, mandate, record-keeping, duty of impartiality, recusal, self-dealing prohibition, and ethical trading standards for ADPC members.\n\n**Executive Summary**\n\nThis proposal intends to formalize a structured group within the ArbitrumDAO (the ‘ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee’ or ‘ADPC’) responsible for overseeing and managing Procurement Frameworks that are ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time depending on the needs of the organization. The ADPC’s primary purpose is to ensure that procurement activities are conducted efficiently, transparently, and in compliance with the applicable framework/s.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe ADPC’s immediate mandate will be that of facilitating & administering the recently ratified ‘Procurement Framework for Security Service Providers’ \\[REF:[Proposal \\[Non-Constitutional\\]: \\*\\*Procurement Framework \\[Security Service Providers\\]\\*\\* 11](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-procurement-framework-security-service-providers/19704) & [Snapshot 4](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3404df8a6e105dcf8b60cb22f22928aeedd3ffa5d80dc36e4f8fd74d0f5f14cb)]. This mandate can be supplemented by virtue of a Snapshot vote whereby the ArbitrumDAO may add another procurement framework that the Procurement Committee will be responsible to administer & facilitate.\n\nComposition of the ADPC \\[Mandate, Eligibility, Election Process, Funding, Operational Parameters]\n\n**\\[i] MANDATE**\n\n1. The primary mandate of the ArbitrumDAO Procurement Committee (ADPC) is to oversee and facilitate the recently ratified procurement framework for security-oriented service providers within the Arbitrum Ecosystem, as per the following reference: \\[Snapshot Proposal Link: [Snapshot 4](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x3404df8a6e105dcf8b60cb22f22928aeedd3ffa5d80dc36e4f8fd74d0f5f14cb)]. In this capacity, the ADPC bears the responsibility of diligently executing the steps essential to implement the aforementioned procurement framework in a manner characterized by transparency and efficiency.\n2. The ADPC will be tasked with researching & drafting a proposal to the ArbitrumDAO to set up a subsidy-fund for security-oriented services that will be used to subsidize the costs for security-services for smaller projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n3. The ADPC will be tasked with researching & implementing a framework that will establish a set of qualitative & quantitative metrics that will be utilized so as to assess a project’s eligibility for the ‘Subsidy Fund’ referred to in point \\[b] above. This ‘Means Test’ (as referred to in traditional administrative practices), will be bundled in with the proposal that will set up the subsidy fund referred to in \\[b]. The Means Test will be used to assess whether a project is eligible for security service-fee subsidies. Initially, this methodology will only be applied to security-oriented services. However, this does not preclude the application of this same concept to other verticals within the ArbitrumDAO.\n4. The ADPC will be tasked with establishing procurement frameworks for a myriad of verticals/service-types that the ArbitrumDAO could need in the foreseeable future. This proactive approach towards procurement will naturally aid in ensuring that projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem have immediate access to high-quality whitelisted service providers when the need arises. In this regard, all procurement frameworks developed by the ADPC will need to be ratified through a Snapshot vote by the ArbitrumDAO.\n5. The ADPC will be tasked with creating & communicating guidance notes & circulars that will substantiate & provide additional detail in relation to any procurement framework that is ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time. The aim of these guidance notes & circulars is to provide prospective applicants going through the procurement process with the necessary information that would enable them to satisfactorily complete the steps of the corresponding procurement framework.\n\nThe ADPC will be composed of three \\[3] members that will facilitate & administer procurement frameworks as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time. The appointment of ADPC members will be effected via an open election process via Snapshot’s weighted voting system; wherein the first three \\[3] ranked members in the vote will be elected to the ADPC. Albeit not legally binding, when voting for prospective members of the ADPC, delegates & token holders alike should prioritize the following eligibility criteria so as to properly equip the ADPC to carry out its mandate.\n\n**\\[ii] ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA**\n\nAlbeit not being legally binding, prospective voters looking to assess election applicants should in-principle conduct their assessments in light of these criteria.\n\nExperience\n\n* A demonstrated knowledge of procurement principles & best practices;\n* In-depth knowledge of procurement frameworks as ratified by the ArbitrumDAO from time to time;\n* At least 3 years experience in Legal, Operations or Administrative role.\n\nIntegrity\n\n* Disclosure of any involvement in ethical breaches, fraud, manipulation, or other forms of misconduct, whether in the past or present.\n* Failure to provide accurate and complete disclosure of such information will result in the forfeiture of the applicant’s eligibility upon the discovery of this information.\n\nConflicts of Interest and Independence of Mind\n\n* Disclosure is required for any actual or potential conflicts of interest that may emerge upon being selected for the role applied for.\n* This includes any factors that may impair one’s ability to carry out decisions with sound, objective, and independent judgment.\n\nIndustry Knowledge\n\n* A comprehensive grasp of industry-specific service procurement challenges, procurement frameworks, and prevailing best practices.\n* Previous experience drafting governance proposals.\n\nAnalytical Skills for Service Contracts\n\n* Robust analytical capabilities for evaluating and negotiating service contracts, including service-level agreements (SLAs) and performance metrics.\n* The ability to identify and assess risks associated with service procurement decisions.\n\nFinancial Acumen (Service Costs)\n\n* A firm grounding in financial aspects of service procurement, including budgeting, cost analysis, and financial implications.\n\nCommunication Skills\n\n* Exceptional communication abilities, both oral and written, for interactions with service providers, stakeholders, and fellow committee members.\n* The capacity to convey complex service procurement information clearly and effectively.\n\nNegotiation\n\n* A high degree of proficiency in negotiating service agreements and SLAs to secure favorable terms, pricing structures, and quality standards with service providers should the need arise.\n* The ability to build and maintain positive relationships with service providers.\n\nProject Management Abilities\n\n* Proficiency in project management related to service procurement, including project planning, execution, and performance monitoring.\n* The capability to manage timelines, resources, and deliverables effectively for service projects.\n\nEthical Conduct\n\n* An unwavering commitment to ethical conduct in all service procurement activities, ensuring transparency and fairness in service provider whitelisting & facilitation.\n\nTeam Player\n\n* The ability to function effectively as a team player within the committee and collaborate with other organizational departments, stakeholders, and service providers.\n* Willingness to consider diverse perspectives and reach consensus on service procurement decisions.\n\nTechnology Proficiency\n\n* Familiarity with service procurement software and tools for managing service procurement processes, data analysis, and reporting.\n* Previous experience with Asana/Airtable.\n* Previous experience with Multi-Sigs.\n\nDecision-Making Skills\n\n* Sound judgment and decision-making skills to make informed and strategic service procurement choices aligned with the organization’s service procurement strategy.\n\n**\\[iii] ELECTION PROCESS**\n\nWe propose adapting section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution & optimizing it to apply to the election for ADPC Members \\[REF: [The Amended Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs 1](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)]. Hereunder, we propose an adapted model of Section 4 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution to implement in the ADPC Elections.\n\nThe ADPC election process is scheduled to begin 3 business days from the ratification of the on-chain proposal that will secure the funding for the ADPC.\n\nThe date chosen for the first election will form the basis for all future elections. Every election should begin 6 months after the previous election has been finalized.\n\nAll ADPC committee members are expected to serve their term unless terminated by the ArbitrumDAO through Snapshot as stipulated in the Agreement regulating the ADPC \\[Further details below re. the Agreement & Defining provisions in the Checks & Balances section].\n\nThere will be one election with the first three \\[3] ranking members in the weighted voting Snapshot being elected to the ADPC.\n\n**\\[iv] PROCEDURE & ELECTION TIMELINE**\n\n1. Application Submission (T+7 business days):\n\nAnyone may submit an application on a dedicated page on the ArbitrumDAO Forums in conformity with the application template stipulated hereunder;\n\n1. KYB/KYC + Delegate Review Period (7 business day period following the end of Application Submission Period):\n\nApplicants who would have validly submitted their applications in conformity with the application template will then be required to undergo KYC/KYB processes.

Only applicants who pass KYB/KYC will be eligible for the ADPC election.\n\n1. Member election (7 business day period following the end of KYB/KYC + Delegate Review Period):\n\nA Snapshot with weighted voting will be put up, including the list of all eligible candidates. The three \\[3] highest voted candidates will be elected to the Procurement Committee.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO may approve and implement a Non-Constitutional AIP to change the rules governing future ADPC elections, but the AIP process may not be used to intervene in an ongoing election.\n\n**\\[v] ELECTION APPLICATION TEMPLATE**\n\nApplicant Information:\n\nName of Applicant & Applicant’s Representative \\[If Applicable]:\n\nEmail Address:\n\nTelegram Handle (if applicable):\n\nLinkedIn Profile (if applicable):\n\nPrimary languages spoken:\n\nDisclosure of other time commitments:\n\nExperience\n\n\\[Refer to Eligibility Criteria] Please provide a brief overview of your experience in the digital asset industry and, more specifically, the Ethereum & Arbitrum Ecosystems.

      "title": "Long-Term Incentives Pilot Program",
      "content": "**The full proposal exceeds Snapshot’s 20K character limit. A brief summary has been provided below. The full proposal can be seen [HERE](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/long-term-incentives-pilot-program/20223/19?u=matt_stablelab).**\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal establishes a Long Term Incentives Pilot Program for the DAO to test new incentive designs and answer the necessary questions to ensure we are ready to commit to the long-term program. This Pilot Program will distribute 25-45M ARB to protocols building on Arbitrum. The exact amount will be determined by the DAO via Snapshot vote and will be ratified via Tally vote. The program will distribute ARB to protocols for 12 weeks.\n\nThe specifications of the Pilot Program were designed to remedy the 3 largest complaints regarding STIP Round 1. The Pilot Program hopes to be a test run for these additions for the DAO to determine if they should also be included in the long-term framework.\n\n#### Problem #1: Too large a burden placed on delegates\n\nIn the original STIP, delegates voted on each incentive proposal individually, with almost 100 snapshot votes. This was extremely tiring for delegates and left many feeling they could not make informed decisions on every proposal.\n\n#### Solution #1\n\nTo remedy this problem, the Pilot Program will have a 5 person council elected by the DAO responsible for evaluating applications and selecting which protocols will advance to a snapshot vote to receive ARB. This will ensure all applications are thoughtfully evaluated with only the most deserving receiving incentives. Not only will this help to reduce the burden on delegates, but it will also help expedite the process and allow protocols to receive incentives quickly and efficiently.\n\n#### Problem #2: Protocols did not receive adequate feedback on their proposals\n\nA major gripe from protocols was they struggled to get feedback from delegates before the deadline. This left many feeling as though the better-connected protocols had an advantage as they were able to modify their proposals based on feedback to make them more competitive during the vote. Many protocols were willing to make changes to their applications to make them more appealing to the DAO but never received the proper feedback necessary to do so.\n\n#### Solution #2\n\nThe Pilot Program introduces Application Advisors. This will be impartial organizations tasked with providing each applicant with detailed feedback and guidance on how to improve their applications. This ensures each applicant can iterate on their proposal so they can put forward the best possible incentive plan for the council.\n\n#### Problem #3: Strict Limitations on Incentives Mechanisms\n\nSTIP Round 1 had strict limitations on how the ARB could be used as incentives. This was done to protect the DAO and prevent misuse of funds. However, the strict rules resulted in the stifling of many innovative incentive designs. Many protocols had interesting designs that used the ARB in ways that increased alignment, improved cost efficiency, or helped to limit the dumping of ARB. However, these designs were not permitted in Round 1 leading to almost all protocols resulting in generic liquidity incentive models.\n\n#### Solution #3\n\nThe Pilot Program provides more flexibility to protocols to create innovative incentive structures. With the addition of the Council and Application Advisors, the Pilot Program does not require the rules to be as stringent. Malicious or inefficient designs will be first filtered out by the Application Advisors and then rejected by the council. Allowing protocols to innovate on incentive distribution mechanisms will allow Arbitrum protocols and community members to get a better idea of which designs work and which don’t work. This will help everyone as we prepare for a longer-term incentives program.\n\n## Flow of V2\n\n#### Application Period (2 week)\n\nProtocols will have 2 weeks to apply using the Pilot Program application template. The application template will be created by the Council and the Application Advisors to ensure everyone has the same goals and make it easier for the council to process applications. Applications will be posted in the Pilot Program section of the Arbitrum forum. Protocols only need to post the initial draft of their application during this period. They will then have 2 additional weeks during the feedback period to edit their applications. No late submissions will be accepted.\n\n#### Feedback Period (2 weeks)\n\nDuring the feedback period, the Applications Advisors will provide feedback and guidance on all proposals. Protocols will be assigned an Application Advisor who will provide feedback and guidance on applications on a rolling basis. Protocols will then use this time to work with the Advisors to edit their proposals before applications lock at the end of the 2 weeks.\n\nStableLab will also read all submissions during this period and highlight any rule violations to allow applicants to edit their submissions to ensure they comply with all program rules.\n\n#### Screening Period (1 week)\n\nDuring this period, the council will use the pre-determined rubric to grade each protocol and decide which protocols will advance to the voting period to receive ARB. The Council will use the rubric to select which applications will progress to a snapshot vote. The protocols that the council selects to advance to a snapshot vote must have a total funding amount that is equal to or lower than the incentives budget. This will ensure the DAO does not overspend should all Snapshot votes pass. Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO.\n\nThe rubric will be created by the Council and Application Advisors during the Tally voting period and will be publicly available by the time protocols begin to apply. The council will be required to publish a brief reasoning for all of their decisions on the forum to create transparency and accountability.\n\nThe council must judge applications as they are and cannot accept protocols at lower amounts than their application states. For example, if an application asks for 200,000 ARB the council can not fund them with 100,000 ARB\n\n**EXAMPLE**: This is a hypothetical example using a budget of 10 ARB with 50 applicants that each request 1 ARB\n\n50 protocols apply requesting 1 Arb Each -> Councils grades all 50 applications using the rubric and narrow the selection down to the top 10 applicants to not exceed the budget -> 10 snapshot votes are created to allow the DAO to confirm the council's decisions -> 9/10 Snapshot votes receive a majority of “fund” votes -> 9 protocols are funded with 1 ARB each and 1 Arb is returned to the DAO\n\n#### Voting Period (1 Week)\n\nUpon completion of the preliminary applicant screening process by the council, the selected applications will be formally presented for consideration. Each application will then be subject to a voting process via Snapshot, allowing Arbitrum delegates to vote on the allocation of funds. In the event that the Snapshot vote is favorably concluded, the respective protocol will commence receiving its funding through an Hedgey stream, facilitated by oSnap execution pending the protocol successfully passing KYC.\n\n#### Incentives Period (12 weeks)\n\nSelected protocols will receive their requested ARB using bi-weekly Hedgey streams for 12 weeks. During this time, protocols will be required to provide bi-weekly updates on the progress of their incentives using this [template](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-bi-weekly-update-template/19436). Protocols will be required to finish their incentive distributions or return any unused funds two weeks after their final disbursement is available.\n\nDuring this period Application Advisors will continue to work with the protocols to help them analyze and improve their distribution mechanisms. Protocols will be allowed to adjust their incentive plans as long as they do not violate any rules and provide their updated plans in their next bi-weekly update.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\n#### Total Cost: 25,815,000 - 45,815,000 ARB\n\n* **Incentives**: 25,000,000 - 45,000,000 ARB. The exact amount will be determined by the DAO through a Snapshot vote. The entire budget does not need to be spent by the council. Any unused funds will be returned to the DAO\n\n* **Council Members**: 125,000 ARB - 25,000 ARB each\n\n* **Application Advisors**: 105,000 ARB - 35,000 ARB each\n\n* **Research Bounties**: 200,000 ARB Total - the exact amount and sizes of specific bounties will be selected by the Council and can be vetoed by delegates.\n\n* **Data and Analytics Provider**: 150,000 ARB for data monitoring and reporting\n\n* **Program Manager**: 100,000 ARB for program design, organization, management, research report, and continuing development of the Long Term Incentives Framework. See the full list of responsibilities above.\n\n* **Proposal Creation Assistance:** 15,000 ARB - 10,000 ARB for Alex Lumley and 5,000 ARB for Bobby Bola for their time spent assisting with proposal design, hosting proposal office hour calls, and communicating with delegates to gather feedback.\n\n* **Retroactive Community Funding**: 100,000 ARB\n\n* **Multisig Signers**: 20,000 ARB - 2,500 ARB each",

      "title": "AIP: ArbOS Version 11",
      "content": "# AIP: ArbOS Version 11\n\n# Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis AIP introduces a number of improvements to Arbitrum chains, including support for the EVM Shanghai upgrade and the PUSH0 opcode, along with miscellaneous bug fixes. These improvements are now audited and ready for adoption, including by Arbitrum Orbit chains, Arbitrum One, and Arbitrum Nova. This proposal concerns the latter two, as they are governed by the Arbitrum DAO. On a high level an ArbOS upgrade can be seen as Arbitrum's equivalent of a hardfork - more can be read about the subject over in https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-arbos-upgrades/19695\n\n## Changes Included\n\n### 1. EVM Shanghai support (including the PUSH0 opcode)\n\nRecent versions of go-ethereum already includes support for the changes to the EVM made in the Shanghai L1 upgrade, but we need to enable them for Arbitrum chains. Instead of using a time based activation, it’s better to activate support based on the ArbOS version, which makes sure that even if the upgrade is delayed, Shanghai support will take effect uniformly and without causing divergences with out of date node software.\n\nPRs:\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1583>\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1664>\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1712>\n\n### 2. Retryable fixes\n\nRetryable fees previously always used the network fee account, instead of also using the infrastructure fee account. The infrastructure fee account should be paid fees from the basefee, and the network fee account should be paid any surplus fees when the gas price is elevated. That was correctly implemented for normal transactions, but retryables only dealt with the network fee account. Retryable redemption also reported an incorrect gas usage in the block header. This matters to Arbitrum Nova, where the infrastructure fee account pays out some fees to the Data Availability Committee members, but the network fee account does not.\n\nPRs:\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1789>\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1980>\n\n### 3. Fix the chain owner list returned by precompile\n\nThis change doesn’t affect the actual chain owner set, but the list being returned by the ArbOwnerPublic precompile was incorrect for Arbitrum Nova due to an internal ArbOS issue. To be clear, this does not affect who was able to make chain owner actions. As intended, only the DAO is able to make chain owner actions on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. This change only affects the list of chain owners presented by the ArbOwnerPublic precompile.\n\nPRs:\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1525>\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1768>\n\n### 4. Fix some precompile methods taking up all gas when reverting\n\nSome precompile methods such as ArbSys’s arbBlockHash method took up all gas when reverting. That meant that if a transaction called arbBlockHash with an out-of-range block number, it’d use up all the gas when reverting.\n\nPR:\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1490>\n\n### 5. Create missing precompile methods to view some L1 pricing parameters\n\nThe L1RewardReceipient and L1RewardRate were previously not exposed via precompiles. This change adds methods to get them to ArbGasInfo so that the current chain configuration can be easily checked.\n\nPR:\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1775>\n\n### 6. Fix the possibility of a staticcall from the owner to ArbOwner emitting a log\n\nThis shouldn’t matter in practice, but it was theoretically for a staticcall from the chain owner to the ArbOwner precompile to emit a log. In the EVM, staticcalls should never be able to emit logs. This PR fixes the Arbitrum precompile logic to disallow emitting logs in staticcall contexts.\n\nPR:\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1562>\n\n### 7. Fix default L1 pricing params\n\nThis shouldn’t matter for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, because these parameters were already corrected in [AIP-7](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-7-arbitrum-one-governance-parameter-fixes/15920). However, it’s included in ArbOS version 11 so that any Arbitrum Orbit chains automatically get the correct parameters.\n\nPR:\n<https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1549>\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe canonical version of ArbOS 11 this proposal aims to adopt is implemented in the Arbitrum Nitro git commit hash  `df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d`\n\nThat commit builds a WASM module root of `0xf4389b835497a910d7ba3ebfb77aa93da985634f3c052de1290360635be40c4a`, which is a hash of the code that’s put on-chain for fraud proofs. You can verify this WASM module root on a x86\\_64 computer (i.e. not on ARM which builds slightly different symbol names) with Docker setup by checking out the previously mentioned commit of the nitro repository, running `git submodule update --init --recursive`, and then running `docker build . --target module-root-calc --tag wavm-machine && docker run --rm wavm-machine cat /workspace/target/machines/latest/module-root.txt` This uses Docker to perform a reproducible build of the WebAssembly code used in fraud proofs, and outputs its hash.\n\nThe above code has audited by Trail of Bits - the audit report can be viewed in <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uwA1PK3AB9ggHMqaw91mubu5WHcEp398/view?usp=sharing>\n\n### Upgrade Action smart contracts\n\nThe Action smart contracts used to execute the on-chain upgrade can be viewed in\n\n<https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/170>\n\nAction contract addresses:\n[SetArbOneArbOS11ModuleRootAction](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3b70f2da6f3b01f9a53dcbcb3e59ad3ad8bed924#code)\n[SetNovaArbOS11ModuleRootAction](https://etherscan.io/address/0x54c2c372943572ac2a8e84d502ebc13f14b62246#code)\n[SetArbOS11VersionAction](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xF6c7Dc6eaE78aBF2f32df899654ca425Dfa99481#code)\n[SetArbOS11VersionAction](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x5357f4d3e8f8250a77bcddd5e58886ad1358220c#code)\n\nThe above code has audited by Trail of Bits - the audit report can be viewed in <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N3197Z7DuqBpu9qdt-GWPewe8HQakfLY/view?usp=sharing>\n\n### Verifying the ArbOS Code Difference\n\nThe current ArbOS version used on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova is ArbOS 10, corresponding to the Arbitrum Nitro `consensus-v10` git tag. You can verify this by running the previously mentioned steps to build the WASM module root on that git tag, which produces the WASM module root `0x6b94a7fc388fd8ef3def759297828dc311761e88d8179c7ee8d3887dc554f3c3`, which is what the rollup contract’s `wasmModuleRoot()` method returns for both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\nTo audit the code difference from ArbOS 10 to ArbOS 11, you could simple generate a full nitro diff with `git diff consensus-v10 df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d` (and also generate a diff of the go-ethereum submodule mentioned in that nitro diff). However, that includes a lot of code that isn’t part of the WASM module root. To filter down to just the replay binary which defines the state transition function, you can start by generating a list of files in the nitro and go-ethereum repositories included by the replay binary in either ArbOS 10 or ArbOS 11 with bash:\n\n`#!/usr/bin/env bash\nset -e\nmkdir -p ~/tmp # this script uses ~/tmp as scratch space and output`\n\n`# this script should be run in the nitro repository`\n\n`git checkout df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nmake solgen\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '[]' | sed 's/ /\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/' | sed 's@github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/@@' | while read dir; do find \"$dir\" -type f -name '*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '_test\\.go`\n\nNow, `~/tmp/replay-binary-dependencies.txt` contains a list of dependencies of the replay binary that were present in ArbOS 10 or 11. To use that to generate a smaller diff of the nitro repository, you can run:\n\n`git diff consensus-v10 df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d -- cmd/replay $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-nitro-dependencies.txt)`\n\nFor the go-ethereum submodule, you can first find out what go-ethereum commit ArbOS 10 and 11 used:\n\n`$ git ls-tree consensus-v10 go-ethereum                                                                                                                                                                                           128 ↵\n160000 commit 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298  go-ethereum\n$ git ls-tree df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d go-ethereum\n160000 commit abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de  go-ethereum`\n\nThose commit hashes are the go-ethereum commit hashes pinned by each nitro commit. Then, you can again use `git diff` and the files generated by the earlier script to generate a diff limited to code used by the replay binary:\n\n`git diff 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt)`\n\nThis diff also includes the diff between upstream go-ethereum versions v1.10.25 and v1.11.6, as ArbOS 10 used the former and ArbOS 11 uses the latter. To filter out that difference, you can use this tool to find the intersection of two git diffs: <https://gist.github.com/PlasmaPower/795af590f88cfb5e21c5ad9b8a32afdf>\n\nWe can use that to find the intersection of the diff of ArbOS 11’s go-ethereum against ArbOS 10’s go-ethereum and the diff of ArbOS 11’s go-etheruem against upstream go-ethereum v1.11.6:\n\n`git diff 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-10-vs-11-geth.diff\ngit diff v1.11.6 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-upstream-geth.diff\ndiff-intersection.py ~/tmp/arbos-10-vs-11-geth.diff ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-upstream-geth.diff`\n\nIn addition, you can pass the following arguments to `diff-intersection.py` to ignore files that are included by the replay binary but whose components are not used: `--ignore-files 'core/blockchain*.go' arbitrum_types/txoptions.go 'rawdb/**' 'rpc/**'`\n\nNote that by default, `diff-intersection.py` does a line based intersection. To instead do an intersection based on chunks in the diff, known as hunks in git terminology, you can add the `--only-hunks` flag.",

      "title": "Proposal: Experimental Incentive System for Active ArbitrumDAO Delegates",
      "content": "## **Abstract**\n\nWe introduce an Experimental Incentive System aimed at the ArbitrumDAO delegates with a duration of six months. The goal is to assess the incentives' impact on the delegates' active participation and involvement in the DAO's governance. *This proposal is subject to changes.*\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nThis proposal represents an improved version compared to previous initiatives and requests for comments (RFCs):\n\n- [[RFC-2] Delegate Incentive System for ArbitrumDAO](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-2-delegate-incentive-system-for-arbitrumdao/15720)\n- [[DRAFT] Experimental Incentive System for Active ArbitrumDAO Delegates](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/draft-experimental-incentive-system-for-active-arbitrumdao-delegates/16501)\n\nWe have developed this new proposal considering the comments and observations provided by other delegates. Our additional motivation lies in the recent increase in proposals and increased activity within ArbitrumDAO. We believe that delegates are the core base of the DAO and should be properly incentivized to maintain active participation, both in voting and feedback on proposals and in the ideation of governance processes.\n\n# **Delegate Incentive System**\n\n## **Before reading the proposal, note how we have decided to structure it**\n\nThis proposal is structured into four main sections:\n\n* **Option 1:** This is our main proposal detailing all the specifications of the incentive system.\n* **Option 2:** Introduces the implementation of \"Karma\" to automate certain processes. It's important to note that this option entails additional costs.\n* **General Summary:** An overview of the proposed items.\n* **Next Steps:** Voting deadline\n\n# **Option 1 - Main Proposal**\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Duration of the Incentive System\n\nWe've allocated an initial trial period of 6 months. This timeframe should allow us to gather initial metrics to gauge the system's functionality and its anticipated impact.\n\n## Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives\n\nWe have set the number at **50 delegates**. This figure isn't based on specific reasoning, but we believe it's a reasonable starting point.\n\n## Funding\n\n- Incentives for delegates: 1,500,000 ARB\n- Incentive Program Administrator: 25,000 ARB\n\n## Delegate Selection Process\n\n### Requirements\n\nBased on the feedback received, we've opted for a single tier instead of a multi-tiered program, allowing a wider array of participants, the requirements would be as follows:\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n> **Note:**\n> * So following this model, the top fifty delegates - defined by their final score - within the range, would be compensated\n> * The 5000 ARB per month is the max amount a delegate could earn, but this amount could be lower depending on their score.\n> * Certain votes won't be counted towards the Tally Participation Rate, as detailed in the following links:\n> 1. [Core Test Proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/60371879178081104082641012273221287927865067413661362234634146098631763379427)\n> 2.

[[OLD] AIP-1.1 - Lockup, Budget, Transparency ](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/79904733039853333959339953965823982558487956291458141923259498272549038367575)\n\n### Incentive Program Application\n\nDelegates matching the requirements must confirm their participation in the Incentive System in the forum (a dedicated channel will be established for this). They must post using the template provided below, within a 7-day application window.\n\n**Incentive Program Confirmation Template:**\n* Forum Username (Link):\n* Twitter Profile (Link):\n* Snapshot Profile (Link):\n* Tally Profile with Exact All-time Participation Rate % (Link):\n\n> **Note:**\n> * Failing to send a confirmation message will exclude you from the incentive system, regardless of eligibility.\n> * Applicants should ensure accuracy in numbers and links, facilitating quicker verification.\n\n**Eligible delegates for the incentive program will be announced on the forum.**\n\n## Scoring and Framework\n\nTo determine which delegates will be paid on a monthly basis, we will use a point system and a framework that will be made public.\n\n![scores.png](ipfs://bafybeieuu4yypwmkapdkznz4arvsci7t7ond4a7qh55us2fuz5ijjbhwsa)\n    \n[Framework - Experimental Incentive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTRXhxcw3o8RJYWw0Nvf48Ak0ihOe5kUJUcTWH0IDgg/edit#gid=374367862)\n\n### Details: Terminology, Symbols, and Formulas\n\nWe explain in detail the framework and points system:\n\n* **Delegates (DD):** Delegates with right to access to incentives\n* **Ranking (TOP):** Delegate's position in this Dune table https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power\n* **Funds ARB (FARB):** The amount of ARB allocated per month to the delegates' payment\n* **Activity Weight (%):** Represents the weight assigned to each key activity to be measured in delegates.\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20:** Percentage of the total participation of the member in votes. This parameter is extracted from Tally. This is the only parameter that is not reset monthly.\n    * **PR% formula: (PR * 20) / 100**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15:** Percentage of delegate participation in snapshot voting. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to snapshots for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted on in the month.\n    * **SV% formula: (SV(Tn) /SV(Fn)) * 15**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25:** Percentage of delegate participation in on-chain voting in Tally. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to Tally for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted in Tally in the month.\n    * **TV% formula: (TV(Fn) - TV(Rn)) * 25**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25:** Percentage of communication threads with the justification of the delegate's vote on the proposals sent to snapshots and Tally (if necessary if the vote does not change). This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of proposals that were submitted to a vote.\n    * **Rn:** Number of real communication rational threads where the delegate communicated and justified his/her decision.\n    * **CR% formula: (CR(Fn) - CR(Rn)) * 25**\n  * **Commenting Proposals (CP) - Weight 15:** Percentage of proposals where the delegate asked questions or generated important discussion for the advancement of the proposal. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of formal proposals posted on the forum.\n    * **Rn:** Number of actual proposals where the delegate made a genuine and quality contribution. Spam messages will not be considered.\n    * **CP% formula: (CP(Fn) - CP(Rn)) * 15**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP:** This parameter is extra. If the delegate makes a significant contribution to the DAO, he/she is automatically granted +40% extra TP. This parameter is at the discretion of the program administrator. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month\n\n* **Total Participation (TP):** Sum of the results of activities performed by the delegate. A TP% of 100 indicates full participation.\n  * **TP% formula: PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**\n* **Payment ARB (PARB):** Final amount of ARB that the delegate will receive based on his TP% and his position in the table.\n  * **PARB formula: IF(TP% >=100; 50000 ;(5000 * TP% / 100))**\n\n#### Parameter summary\n\n* **Activity Weight (%):**\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20%**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Commenting on Proposals (CP) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP (Total Participation)**\n* **Total Participation (TP):**\n  * **TP = PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**\n\n### Weight and activity considerations\n\nThe activities that have been considered in shaping the framework and scope are measurable activities that we believe can positively impact governance.\n\nWe have distributed the weight according to the type of activity, as we believe this is the fairest way to do it at the moment.\n\n**Surely both the activities and the weightings are far from being the final parameters, ideally after these 6 months we should have a clear idea of how to modify certain parameters or which ones to add/remove.**\n\n> **Note:**\n> We have not included the governance call in the list of activities because we feel that it may be difficult for delegates in different time zones to attend because of the specific timing of the call. Plus some delegates might not want to dox their voices.\n\n\n### Total Participation (TP)\n\nThe 50 delegates who conclude the month with a **TP score of +60%** will be the ones to receive incentives based on the result provided by the **PARB** parameter.\n\nShould more than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only the top 50 scores will be selected.\n\nIf fewer than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only those meeting the criteria will be compensated\n\n> **Note:**\n> In the exceptional circumstance where scores are identical or more than 50 delegates exceed +90%, the entire month's budget may be distributed amongst all delegates with such scores. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\n### Bonus Point\n\nShould a delegate propose or actively participate in an enhancement proposal for Arbitrum DAO and execute it, like the [Arbitrum’s Short-Term Incentive Program (Arbitrum Improvement Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131)), they will be granted an additional +30% to their TP score for making a valuable contribution to the DAO. This could also be a governance process enhancement proposal or a template for grant selection.\n\nWe understand that this is one of the weakest points of the proposal and we believe it is very objective. To assess this point we will try to answer these questions\n\n- Is the proposal of interest to the ArbitrumDAO, does it cover any vertical that has not yet been worked on?\n- Is the proposal well described, does it have details of the objectives it wants to achieve?\n- Does the proposal generate debate among delegates, is there interest among DAO members (for or against) about the proposal?\n- Does the proposer exhaust existing resources to demonstrate that their proposal adds value to ArbitrumDAO (governance calls, responds in the governance forum, etc).\n- Was the proposal put to a vote: was it a close vote or a resounding no? \n\nWhen evaluating the bonus points we will try to answer these questions and the administrator will have to upload a post to the forum with the answer and a justification of why he/she grants the bonus point. We also look forward to hearing the community's opinion on the matter.\n\n### Parameter Snapshot\n\nWhen we refer to a month, we consider from the first day of the month 00:00 UTC to the last day 23:59hs UTC of each month. Within these days and hours, delegates have the opportunity to perform all actions to meet the parameters. The month's activities conclude on the last day of the month, so delegates must be punctual.\n\n### Delegate Responsibilities\n\nDelegates are responsible for keeping track of their actions. At the end of the month, they have until the 3rd of the following month to submit a forum post with the following requirements:\n\n* A copy (Link) of the framework with their activity data for that month.\n* Additionally, the post must have a summary with all the links including:\n  * Snapshot voting link\n  * Forum post link explaining the reasoning behind the snapshot vote\n  * Tally voting link\n  * Forum post link explaining the tally vote reasoning (if you have changed your vote)\n  * Commenting on Proposals link (only those that went to snapshots)\n* The summary should also include:\n  * Delegate proposal links\n  * Links to any significant contribution (discussion, questions, suggestions, etc.) made to a proposal.\n\n> **Note:**\n> * Delegates failing to post the requested information will not receive incentives.\n> * To avoid forum spam and disarray, we will ask the facilitators to add a channel for the incentive system so delegates can input all their information there.\n\n### Incentive System Administrator Responsibilities\n\nAfter the delegates post and present their results in the framework, the incentive system administrator has 10 days to gather all the information, review, verify, and unify it. Then, present all the unified data on the forum in the [framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTRXhxcw3o8RJYWw0Nvf48Ak0ihOe5kUJUcTWH0IDgg/edit#gid=374367862) and attach a summary explaining that month's final result.\n\nOnce the final result is presented, delegates have 2 days to file a claim in case of disagreement.\n\n#### Dispute\n\nDelegates have a 2-day window to dispute if they disagree with the results presented by the Incentive System Administrator.\n\nTo raise a dispute, they must do so via a forum post with the following template:\n\n* Title: Dispute\n* Username\n* Reason for dispute (be detailed)\n\nThe system administrator must promptly address the issue, resolving it within a maximum of 2 days.\n\n#### Incentive System Ban\n\nShould a delegate or any community member attempt to deceive or game the incentive system, they will be banned. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\nWe must remember that this system is experimental, and we hope for community members' cooperation for its success. \n\n### Payment Execution\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the delegate payments are expected to be sent as a proposal to Tally, with full details of the payments, between the 16th and 17th. This will be repeated for the 6 months, so that the DAO has control over the incentive program and can cut it off whenever it wants.\n\n**Payments are made in ARB tokens.**\n\n#### Considerations\n\nLike every new and experimental system, there may be delays, so please be [patient](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lll5H9ekrsQPe7zMbvkiWTIzevlwpSJLkQql8B8UhTA/edit#gid=0).\n\nEstimated schedule:\n\n![schedule.png](ipfs://bafkreie7nlxyh7jx7myxgfj6eqogu6p7kfebmokq3v5fvxzskmmb7j2h64)\n    \n### Administrator Perspective\n\n1. Start of the month: Track delegate participation in governance.\n2. Last day of the month: Begin collecting delegate posts from the forum.\n3. Review all the information, check for accuracy, and compile it into the framework.\n4. Establish the results within the given timeframe.\n5. If everyone agrees, send a proposal to Tally with the payment details, to be voted on.\n6. Keep the DAO informed\n\n## Incentive system administrator\n\nGiven the short duration of the program and the lack of a DAO Facilitator, SEED Latam is willing to assume the administration of this program. This means that our delegation won't participate in it and that the adminstration won't be carried out by myself, but by the organization SEED Latam.\n\nHowever, we're also open to a group of delegates or potentially a third party administering this program, in which case we would obviously provide any assistance necessary.\n\nFor the adminstration of said program the budget would be 25,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and will be sent in the proposal to Tally along with the payments to the delegates. In this way the DAO will have control over the administrator.\n\n---\n\n# **Option 2 - Karma automation for delegate incentive program**\n\n### Features summary\n\nKarma will develop features to enhance administrator efficiency and provide transparency to the Arbitrum community. The features that will be built include:\n\n1. Automated fetching of all delegates with Voting Power (VP) over 50k, along with their details.\n2. Profile display for each delegate, showing their voting history and voting reasons they post on Snapshot, Tally or Forum.\n3. Calculation and display of PR, SV, TV, CR, CP (TBD if CP can be automated) for each delegate as specified in the proposal.\n**Karma will implement automatically fetching delegates’ forum data**\n4. Functionality for the Administrator to allocate Bonus Points.\n5. Computation and presentation of the final Total Points (TP) and PARBB for each delegate on: `arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation`.\n\n**This automation eliminates the need for delegates to manually report their monthly activities.**\n\n### Timeline\n\n- **Week 1:** Collaborating with administrators and community members to finalize the project requirements.\n- **Weeks 2 and 3:** Initiating the sprint to design and develop all the features\n- **Week 4:** The product will undergo comprehensive end-to-end testing and be deployed to production. At this stage, the community will gain full access to all features.\n- **Week 5 and Beyond:** Implementation of bug fixes and enhancements based on insights and feedback gathered.\n\n### Payment Schedule\n\n- **Payment 1:** 10k ARB when the proposal passes and the project is kicked off.\n- **Payment 2:** 10K ARB on successful launch of the product (After week 4 per the timeline above)\n- **Payment 3:** 10K ARB 2 months after launch as we continue to fix bugs and make enhancements (week 12 of program kickoff)\n\n**Karma payments will also be executed from the DAO and tracked by the program administrator.**\n\n### Cost\n\n- 30000 ARB\n\n\n## **SEED Latam Commitment**\n\nSeed Latam is committed to monitoring the proper functioning of Karma and collecting feedback from the community on the dashboard's performance. We also commit to collaborating with Karma so that the dashboard meets the needs of the incentive system.\n\nAs with Option 1, we are also open to having a group of delegates or potentially a third party administer Karma's progress and the program, in which case we would obviously provide all necessary assistance.\n\nFor the administration of the program for this option the budget would be 20,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and will be sent in the proposal to Tally along with the payments to the delegates. In this way the DAO will have control over the administrator. \n\n### Disclaimer\n\nSEED Latam does not have any commercial relationship with Karma nor does it receive any payment from them for incorporating them into this proposal.\n\nThe only link between SEED Latam and Karma is that both want the success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n# Overview\n\nProposal overview\n\n**Duration of the incentive system**\n* 6 month\n\n**Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives**\n\n* 50 delegates\n\n**Selection process**\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n*Eligible delegates must confirm their participation in the incentive system by posting a message on the forum.*\n\n## CONT IN FORUM POST",

      "title": "Timeline Extension for STIP and Backfund Grantees",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to extend the deadline for protocols in both STIP and the backfund proposal. Should this proposal pass, the new deadline for protocols to distribute ARB to users would be March 29th. 2024. Since backfunded protocols will experience significant delays to the start of their streams, this proposal aims to have backfunded streams continue until March 15th, 2024. These timeline modifications will help to ensure all protocols have enough time to distribute ARB to users.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe [Proposal to Backfund Successful STIP Proposals](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/13413460212244439965325761903593975061091934953503684497413508380387288651335?chart=2) has recently passed quorum on Tally and will soon commence. The backfund proposal was inappropriately dated to end on January 31st, 2024. As it will likely take several weeks for back-funded protocols to pass KYC, this will only leave around 6 weeks for these protocols to distribute 16 weeks' worth of incentives. This extension proposal aims to continue the streams for these protocols until March 15th, 2024, and allow these protocols to continue incentivizing users until March 29th, 2024. This extension will allow these protocols closer to the full 16 weeks to distribute their ARB incentives to users.\n\nAdditionally, due to extreme variations in KYC timing of the original STIP grantees, some protocols were given much shorter timelines to distribute their ARB incentives. This extension proposal also offers the option to extend the STIP deadline to distribute ARB to users until March 29th, 2024. This will ensure all STIP protocols are given adequate time to distribute their ARB. This however will not change their hedgey stream disbursement dates as the multisig has already started these streams.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe grant funds for both STIP and the Backfund proposal are held by the incentives multisig as stated in the two previous proposals. However, these funds belong to the DAO and the multisig has agreed to follow the DAO's directions. This proposal signals to the multisig if the DAO would like to extend the timelines for STIP and the backfund grant. If this proposal passes the multisig will extend the backfunded protocols’ streams to end on March 15th, 2024, and will allow these protocols to continue distributing their ARB to users until March 29th, 2024. Additionally, should the DAO choose, this proposal could signal to the multisig to allow any original STIP protocols to continue distributing incentives to users until March 29th, 2024 without halting their streams.\n\nThese extensions will ensure that protocols’ incentive distributions to users are not rushed. This will help even the playing field for those who took longer to pass KYC. It will allow the DAO to get more accurate data on the success of these programs.\n\n## Key Terms -\n\nSTIP - The full Short Term Incentives program proposal can be seen [here](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/92535731414466076465748260699234569033779695239254902723866669906112586724812?chart=2)\n\nBackfund Proposal - The full backfund proposal can be seen [here](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/13413460212244439965325761903593975061091934953503684497413508380387288651335?chart=2)\n\nOriginal Timeline - Originally both STIP and the backfund were to end by January 31st\n\nHedgey Stream Disbursements - The ARB protocols receive biweekly from the multisig\n\nGrant Distributions - The ARB protocols award to users as incentives\n\nIncentives Multisig - The 5/9 multisig that holds the funds for both Incentives programs. Details can be seen [here](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/92535731414466076465748260699234569033779695239254902723866669906112586724812?chart=2)\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Extended Backfunded Protocol Timeline\n\nProtocols included in the backfund proposal will have their streams started in batches similar to STIP based on the time they pass KYC. These protocols will also receive disbursements from the multisig using hedgey streams every two weeks.\n\nThe last disbursement date will be March 15th, 2024. Protocols will then have two weeks to finish distributing ARB incentives to users with a deadline of March 29th, 2024.\n\n### Extended STIP Protocol Timeline\n\nProtocols included in the original STIP will have until March 29th, 2024 to finish distributing ARB incentives to users.\n\nThese protocols do not have to extend their distribution schedules until this deadline. Many STIP protocols already have distribution plans in progress that end earlier than March 29th. Protocols may choose to keep their initial plans and finish distributing rewards earlier than March 29th.\n\nProtocols that do wish to extend to the March 29th deadline will be expected to update their distribution plans in their biweekly updates and maintain consistency with their fund usage as expressed in their grant application.\n\nThe hedgey streams for the STIP protocols will not be adjusted as they have already been initiated by the multisig.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nThe multisig would initiate streams for all backfunded protocols to end on March 15th, 2024 given that the backfund proposal passes and these protocols pass KYC and sign grant agreements.\n\nSTIP protocols that wish to adjust their distribution timelines will need to provide updated timelines in their next biweekly update.\n\nBackfunded protocols will also need to provide new distribution schedules that meet the March 29th Deadline.\n\nStableLab will work with the incentives multisig, foundation, protocols, and DAO to help coordinate KYC confirmation, stream initiation, stream monitoring, biweekly updates, and community questions throughout the process.\n\n## Timeline\n\nMarch 15th, 2024 - Backfunded protocols receive their last stream disbursement\n\nMarch 29th, 2024 - Deadline for STIP / backfunded protocols to finish distributing ARB to users\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nThere is no additional to cost the DAO associated with this proposal\n\n## Voting Options\n\n1. Extend deadline for both STIP and Backfunded\n2. Extend deadline only for backfunded protocols\n3. Do not extend either deadline\n4. Abstain",

      "title": "AIP: ArbOS Version 11",
      "content": "# AIP: ArbOS Version 11\n\n# Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis AIP introduces a number of improvements to Arbitrum chains, including support for the EVM Shanghai upgrade and the PUSH0 opcode, along with miscellaneous bug fixes. These improvements are now audited and ready for adoption, including by Arbitrum Orbit chains, Arbitrum One, and Arbitrum Nova. This proposal concerns the latter two, as they are governed by the Arbitrum DAO. On a high level an ArbOS upgrade can be seen as Arbitrum's equivalent of a hardfork - more can be read about the subject over in https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-arbos-upgrades/19695\n\n## Changes Included\n\n### 1. EVM Shanghai support (including the PUSH0 opcode)\n\nRecent versions of go-ethereum already includes support for the changes to the EVM made in the Shanghai L1 upgrade, but we need to enable them for Arbitrum chains. Instead of using a time based activation, it’s better to activate support based on the ArbOS version, which makes sure that even if the upgrade is delayed, Shanghai support will take effect uniformly and without causing divergences with out of date node software.\n\nPRs: \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1583 \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1664  \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1712\n\n### 2. Retryable fixes\n\nRetryable fees previously always used the network fee account, instead of also using the infrastructure fee account. The infrastructure fee account should be paid fees from the basefee, and the network fee account should be paid any surplus fees when the gas price is elevated. That was correctly implemented for normal transactions, but retryables only dealt with the network fee account. Retryable redemption also reported an incorrect gas usage in the block header. This matters to Arbitrum Nova, where the infrastructure fee account pays out some fees to the Data Availability Committee members, but the network fee account does not.\n\nPRs: \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1789\nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1980\n\n### 3. Fix the chain owner list returned by precompile\n\nThis change doesn’t affect the actual chain owner set, but the list being returned by the ArbOwnerPublic precompile was incorrect for Arbitrum Nova due to an internal ArbOS issue. To be clear, this does not affect who was able to make chain owner actions. As intended, only the DAO is able to make chain owner actions on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. This change only affects the list of chain owners presented by the ArbOwnerPublic precompile.\n\nPRs: \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1525\nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1768\n\n### 4. Fix some precompile methods taking up all gas when reverting\n\nSome precompile methods such as ArbSys’s arbBlockHash method took up all gas when reverting. That meant that if a transaction called arbBlockHash with an out-of-range block number, it’d use up all the gas when reverting.\n\nPR: \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1490\n\n### 5. Create missing precompile methods to view some L1 pricing parameters\n\nThe L1RewardReceipient and L1RewardRate were previously not exposed via precompiles. This change adds methods to get them to ArbGasInfo so that the current chain configuration can be easily checked.\n\nPR: \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1775\n\n### 6. Fix the possibility of a staticcall from the owner to ArbOwner emitting a log\n\nThis shouldn’t matter in practice, but it was theoretically for a staticcall from the chain owner to the ArbOwner precompile to emit a log. In the EVM, staticcalls should never be able to emit logs. This PR fixes the Arbitrum precompile logic to disallow emitting logs in staticcall contexts.\n\nPR: \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1562\n\n### 7. Fix default L1 pricing params\n\nThis shouldn’t matter for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, because these parameters were already corrected in [AIP-7](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-7-arbitrum-one-governance-parameter-fixes/15920). However, it’s included in ArbOS version 11 so that any Arbitrum Orbit chains automatically get the correct parameters.\n\nPR: \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1549\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe canonical version of ArbOS 11 this proposal aims to adopt is implemented in the Arbitrum Nitro git commit hash  `df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d`\n\nThat commit builds a WASM module root of `0xf4389b835497a910d7ba3ebfb77aa93da985634f3c052de1290360635be40c4a`, which is a hash of the code that’s put on-chain for fraud proofs. You can verify this WASM module root on a x86_64 computer (i.e. not on ARM which builds slightly different symbol names) with Docker setup by checking out the previously mentioned commit of the nitro repository, running `git submodule update --init --recursive`, and then running `docker build . --target module-root-calc --tag wavm-machine && docker run --rm wavm-machine cat /workspace/target/machines/latest/module-root.txt` This uses Docker to perform a reproducible build of the WebAssembly code used in fraud proofs, and outputs its hash.\n\nThe above code has audited by Trail of Bits - the audit report can be viewed in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uwA1PK3AB9ggHMqaw91mubu5WHcEp398/view?usp=sharing\n\n### Upgrade Action smart contracts\n\nThe Action smart contracts used to execute the on-chain upgrade can be viewed in \n\nhttps://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/170\n\nAction contract addresses:\n[SetArbOneArbOS11ModuleRootAction](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe8e5dc1793d6fe39452ddcb90d12997fa39de1de#code)\n[SetNovaArbOS11ModuleRootAction](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6B125347f3B0790197d5247f32f91fd3e7140eD7#code)\n[SetArbOS11VersionAction](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xF6c7Dc6eaE78aBF2f32df899654ca425Dfa99481#code)\n[SetArbOS11VersionAction](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x5357f4d3e8f8250a77bcddd5e58886ad1358220c#code)\n\n\nThe above code has audited by Trail of Bits - the audit report can be viewed in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N3197Z7DuqBpu9qdt-GWPewe8HQakfLY/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n\n### Verifying the ArbOS Code Difference\n\nThe current ArbOS version used on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova is ArbOS 10, corresponding to the Arbitrum Nitro `consensus-v10` git tag. You can verify this by running the previously mentioned steps to build the WASM module root on that git tag, which produces the WASM module root `0x6b94a7fc388fd8ef3def759297828dc311761e88d8179c7ee8d3887dc554f3c3`, which is what the rollup contract’s `wasmModuleRoot()` method returns for both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\nTo audit the code difference from ArbOS 10 to ArbOS 11, you could simple generate a full nitro diff with `git diff consensus-v10 df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d` (and also generate a diff of the go-ethereum submodule mentioned in that nitro diff). However, that includes a lot of code that isn’t part of the WASM module root. To filter down to just the replay binary which defines the state transition function, you can start by generating a list of files in the nitro and go-ethereum repositories included by the replay binary in either ArbOS 10 or ArbOS 11 with bash:\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nset -e\nmkdir -p ~/tmp # this script uses ~/tmp as scratch space and output\n# this script should be run in the nitro repository\ngit checkout df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nmake solgen\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/' | sed 's@github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/@@' | while read dir; do find \"$dir\" -type f -name '*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '_test\\\\.go\n```\n\nNow, `~/tmp/replay-binary-dependencies.txt` contains a list of dependencies of the replay binary that were present in ArbOS 10 or 11. To use that to generate a smaller diff of the nitro repository, you can run:\n\n```\ngit diff consensus-v10 df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d -- cmd/replay $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-nitro-dependencies.txt)\n```\n\nFor the go-ethereum submodule, you can first find out what go-ethereum commit ArbOS 10 and 11 used:\n\n```\n$ git ls-tree consensus-v10 go-ethereum                                                                                                                                                                                           128 ↵\n160000 commit 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298  go-ethereum\n$ git ls-tree df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d go-ethereum\n160000 commit abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de  go-ethereum\n```\n\nThose commit hashes are the go-ethereum commit hashes pinned by each nitro commit. Then, you can again use `git diff` and the files generated by the earlier script to generate a diff limited to code used by the replay binary:\n\n```\ngit diff 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt)\n```\n\nThis diff also includes the diff between upstream go-ethereum versions v1.10.25 and v1.11.6, as ArbOS 10 used the former and ArbOS 11 uses the latter. To filter out that difference, you can use this tool to find the intersection of two git diffs: https://gist.github.com/PlasmaPower/795af590f88cfb5e21c5ad9b8a32afdf\n\nWe can use that to find the intersection of the diff of ArbOS 11’s go-ethereum against ArbOS 10’s go-ethereum and the diff of ArbOS 11’s go-etheruem against upstream go-ethereum v1.11.6:\n\n```\ngit diff 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-10-vs-11-geth.diff\ngit diff v1.11.6 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-upstream-geth.diff\ndiff-intersection.py ~/tmp/arbos-10-vs-11-geth.diff ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-upstream-geth.diff\n```\nIn addition, you can pass the following arguments to `diff-intersection.py` to ignore files that are included by the replay binary but whose components are not used: `--ignore-files 'core/blockchain*.go' arbitrum_types/txoptions.go 'rawdb/**' 'rpc/**'`\n\nNote that by default, `diff-intersection.py` does a line based intersection. To instead do an intersection based on chunks in the diff, known as hunks in git terminology, you can add the `--only-hunks` flag.",

      "title": "Empowering Early Contributors: The community Arbiter Proposal",
      "content": "**Abstract:**\nThis proposal recommends the allocation of 500,000 $ARB tokens, equivalent to 0.005% of the total supply, to acknowledge and reward the outstanding contributions of Arbitrum community members known as “Arbiters.” These contributors have played pivotal roles in Arbitrum’s development, from translation and publicity to community support and protection from fraudulent activity. By establishing a transparent and equitable reward system through the Arbitrum DAO, we aim to recognize past contributions and inspire continued dedication, fostering the growth of our ecosystem.\n\n**Motivation:**\nThe Arbitrum community thrives on collaboration, decentralization, and the Ethereum community spirit. This proposal aligns with these principles and strives to:\n\n1. Recognize the exceptional contributions made by Arbiters to Arbitrum’s development.\n2. Demonstrate the spirit of collaboration and decentralization within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring its long-term sustainability.\n3. Establish a clear and equitable reward mechanism through the Arbitrum DAO, ensuring that Arbiters are treated fairly.\n4. Inspire more individuals to actively participate in the advancement of the Arbitrum ecosystem by retroactively rewarding Arbiters.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe Arbitrum community, driven by its contributors, has been instrumental in **shaping Arbitrum over the past two years**. These dedicated individuals have contributed significantly through a wide range of activities, including translation, promotion, event organization, community guidance, safety assurance, and collaboration with other communities. These efforts have been essential to the success and vibrancy of the Arbitrum community.\n\n**Partial contribution value**\nSince 2021-2023, the work and contributions made by Arbiter are too numerous to list and quantify individually, and the data provided are statistically estimated due to the lack of prior targeted data counting and retention.\n\n1. Provided millions of help to Arbitrum community users and developers. It allows Arbitrum team members to focus more on the development of technology, and also allows millions of Arbitrum community members to get answers to all kinds of questions and needs feedback. (Anyone can view the help and contributions of the arbitrators on the arbitrum Discord server, wechat groups, and other language communities, etc.)\n2. Arbiters are online 24/7 (in Odyssey and Guild activities related to many arbiters are 16 + hours online, for community members to provide the most immediate, high-quality help) arbiter two years, has been involved in the maintenance and management of the community order, to report and stop more than 100,000 times of the scam, to ensure that hundreds of thousands of members of the community are able to get help in a timely manner and to keep the server safe.\n3. Establish Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean and other Arbitrum local communities, such as: Chinese more than 10 WeChat groups, WeChat public number, microblog, Coinhub, and other media (due to policy reasons, a number of Chinese media has canceled the account)The establishment of language communities has further expanded Arbitrum’s influence, attracted more than 100,000 users and developers to choose to use Arbitrum, and promoted the prosperity of the ecosystem.\n4. Translate and proofread more than 50 Arbitrum articles, arbiters in various language areas edit, typeset and publish Arbitrum daily information more than 2,000 times, publish more than 300 articles and blogs, explain more than 50 videos, and all kinds of accounts with a large number of real fans and readers, for hundreds of thousands of users around the world to provide a quick understanding of the use of Arbitrum and the information and guidelines.\n5. arbiter has provided community optimization, management, operation, and promotion suggestions for arbitrum more than 300 times, making the system of Arbitrum publicity, service, promotion, and operation more perfect, and allowing Arbitrum users, developers, and ecosystem projects to get better service experience and help.\n6. dock 30 Arbitrum AMA, more than 20 events, more than 100 docking projects, affecting hundreds of thousands of community members, attracting more than 50 projects to choose an arbitrum network for deployment.\n7. Some Arbiters have their own communities, and as KOLs in Twitter and famous communities, they vigorously promote Arbitrum through their own influence, posting blogs and all kinds of information, and their continuous influence involves hundreds of thousands of crypto community users. This has brought great enthusiasm and new users to the Arbitrum community.\n8. arbiters has been accompanying and witnessing the prosperous development of the Arbitrum community and ecosystem, continuously carrying forward the spirit of the Arbitrum community and promoting and marketing Arbitrum.\n\nFrom 6,400 wallet addresses at the initial mainnet launch to 1,270,000+ wallet addresses now, including the growth of on-chain TVLs and a thriving ecosystem. Helped and assisted Arbitrum Discord to grow from tens of thousands of members to now 460,000, providing millions of high quality help, all kinds of Arbitrum promotion and publicity with millions of views.\n\n***The following document is the basis for some of the contribute saved***\n\\[[arbiter Simple example table of contributions in different categories - Google Sheets 34](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YjSCrAYJg2A1T5r8YpZx5BbfLQeyhBePqPtW5pA83dU/edit?usp=sharing)]\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n*Beneficiaries:*\nArbiters: Comprising the most dedicated contributors to the Arbitrum community over the past two years, recognized for their exceptional and humble service to the Arbitrum community.\n\n*Distribution of Incentives:*\nThe Arbitrum community requests a total of 500,000 $ARB tokens, to be evenly distributed among 24 of its members, recognizing their past work for the Arbitrum community.\n\nCalculation: 20,833.333 $ARB tokens per member x 24 Discord Arbiter = 500,000 $ARB\n\n**Wallet Address Collection and Distribution:**\nArbiters’ contributor wallet addresses will be collected through a specified process, ensuring accuracy and fairness. If the proposal is approved, the Arbitrum DAO will disburse rewards to each Arbiter contributor’s address, following thorough verification and confirmation.\n\n**Future Plans:**\nUpon the successful implementation of this proposal, we will continue to enhance Arbiter contribution methods, ensuring the sustained growth of the arbitrum community.\n\narbiters will continue to translate blogs, do publicity, organize AMAs, hold offline activities, provide community suggestions, optimize community services, maintain community order, provide high-quality help to the community, actively connect with various activities and projects, and help promote cooperation with other communities. On the basis of arbitrum, actively participate in the arbitrum Ambassador Program and explore more ways to contribute, and continue to provide value to the broader arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nOur goal is to continually contribute value to arbitrum and collaborate with the broader community to foster a vibrant and thriving arbitrum ecosystem.\nAs arbitrum continues to evolve, we will also be able to really demonstrate our knowledge of the protocol and help show more new users that arbitrum is the optimal scaling solution for Ethereum.\n\n**Milestones**\nWhen the arbitrum discord server exceeds 700,000 members,or when TVL passes $3b,or when we have helped community members more than two million times, or when we have made significant progress in various types of outreach and publicity. We are committed to transparently communicating milestone updates and displaying data about what arbiters are doing or contributing.\n\nAfter this proposal, we will pay attention to the statistics and retention of examples of contributions made by arbiters, and data. This will facilitate more detailed examples and data presentation at the next milestone.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe implementation of a robust reward system via the Arbitrum DAO is crucial for recognizing and appreciating the invaluable contributions of Arbiters to the community. This initiative will reinvigorate community engagement, foster openness, and encourage sustained participation, ultimately ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Arbitrum community. Transparency, fairness, and continuous improvement based on community input will be at the forefront of this endeavor. With this proposal, we are confident in building a more collaborative, innovative, and dynamic Arbitrum community that embodies the values and spirit of our ecosystem.\n\nYour insights are valued and essential in shaping the future of our community. We welcome you to provide feedback and engage with us.\n\n\n\n**List of Arbiters’ partial contributions and arbiter profile info,For the sake of DAO reps checking for updates, we’ve listed them separately**\n\n* <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YjSCrAYJg2A1T5r8YpZx5BbfLQeyhBePqPtW5pA83dU/edit#gid=336825191>\n* <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YjSCrAYJg2A1T5r8YpZx5BbfLQeyhBePqPtW5pA83dU/edit#gid=2082014896>\n\n*Additionally, the Arbiter with Discord ID BILLY#7943 has voluntarily forfeited his reward and split it equally amongst the other Arbiters, so we will be modifying the original forum proposal and will be changing the 25 Arbiters in the original proposal to 24, so that the final calculation will be: 20,833.333 $ARB tokens per member x 24 Discord Arbiter = 500,000 $ARB*",

As a preliminary document, it seeks input from both the Arbitrum DAO and the Liquidity Working Group.\n* This proposal frequently cites AIP-9.\n* For all of our resources see here: svy.gg/stip-backfund \n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal outlines a one-time backfund to all \"approved but not funded proposals’’ from Arbitrum STIP. The proposed AIP increases the total budget by 21.4M to 71.4M while increasing the total participating protocols by 26, for a total of 56 funded projects. The program plans to allocate DAO-owned ARB towards incentives while leveraging distribution systems, consensus, and delegate diligence already created from STIP 1.\n\nThis program is designed to backfund approved protocols while maintaining the timelines and systems of STIP 1:\n\n* Timeline: The program is scheduled to commence and conclude concurrently with STIP 1, or within a similar timeframe, starting from the first week of November and running through January 31, 2024.\n* KYC: The program will utilize the same KYC system as STIP 1.\n* Reporting: Participating grantees are required to self-report data, maintain dashboards, and regularly summarize grant performance\n\n# Considerations\n\nBefore this proposal was drafted, a working group was formed to gauge sentiment, gather key data points, and outline the proposal’s structure. The working group collaborated with delegates and projects affected by the STIP, engaging in multiple calls—including sessions with the creators of the STIP and the Incentive Working Group—to solicit feedback and refine the proposal accordingly.\n\nKey concerns discussed include:\n\n### Why not just push towards a round 2 and go through voting for all proposals again?\n\nFirst and foremost, we believe that the successful execution of this Backfund proposal will, in time, serve as a crucial catalyst for future grant structures, including a successful STIP round 2. Why? This opportunity will unify the Arbitrum ecosystem by addressing key weaknesses in the original STIP 1 structure by quickly providing approved projects and other stakeholders with the resources/data needed to design and support future programs.\n\nKey issues associated with delaying an immediate backfund and moving towards a round 2 include:\n\n* Proper design and execution add considerable time delay to a highly competitive environment within Arbitrum and other L2s\n* Requires teams with limited resources approved already for STIP 1 to spend significant time lobbying delegates\n* Removes attention away from new Round 2 proposals\n* Adds additional burden to delegates that should be focused on long-term design improvements and new STIP grants not yet approved\n* Removes key data for STIP experiment analysis by skewing learnings towards larger, well-established projects\n* Delays the alignment of the STIP with the Arbitrum constitution values of inclusivity and diversity\n* Negatively impacts new builder sentiment towards Arbitrum at a critical time in the L2 Wars\n\n### The budget set aside was 50M, and the DAO decided that was the acceptable spend for a short-term incentive.\n\nWhile the budget was set at 50M, the original working group proposed 75M so that:\n\n> “The budget was raised to 75M ARB to accommodate larger protocols (Pinnacle Grants) without compromising smaller applications.” [tnorm, September 3rd 2023.](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131/12)\n\nExcess demand was a significant possibility due to the high interest in STIP and the absence of a cap for Pinnacle grants. Voters lacked the data to ascertain whether the initial 50M would be adequate to achieve the objectives of STIP.\n\nNoteworthy is that, in the event of excess demand, measures including backfunding were already outlined as potential options.\n\nProper design and fulfillment of a Round 2 or similar future funding programs may take time to develop. Meanwhile, projects that received approval but no funding have immediate initiatives requiring support. Our opportunity is to fund these initiatives, level the competitive playing field, and enhance the data available for the STIP process.\n\n[<img height=\"285\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/3/3698b8811ac5887c127ab2bbfc94d7f6dcbd554a_2_624x285.jpeg\" />**1600×733 150 KB**](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/3/3698b8811ac5887c127ab2bbfc94d7f6dcbd554a.jpeg)\n\n[<img height=\"356\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/8/8487c56a2a8f7c7f6dd102ad36e9a20b7459b041_2_624x356.png\" />**1458×832 92.8 KB**](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/original/2X/8/8487c56a2a8f7c7f6dd102ad36e9a20b7459b041.png)\n\n### Voting behaviors for a 50M proposal shouldn’t carry over to a proposal that includes the additional backfunded amounts.\n\nDuring our consultation process, we engaged in numerous discussions that brought forth questions about backfunding. Despite the criticisms, backfunding remains the most straightforward method to address the current STIP’s skewed sample size. We advocate that backfunding is the optimal approach to achieve the STIP’s intended outcomes—specifically, to examine the impact that incentives have on the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, if the STIP continues without rectifying the issues with its sample, the analysis will be compromised by a significant methodological flaw. Backfunding is not just the “best” option; it is essential for preserving the integrity of the STIP overall.\n\nVoting behavior might have differed if the budget cap were set at 75M or 100M. The only way to determine this would be to repeat the experiment with a raised cap (an option that is unfeasible as time travel has not yet been realized).\n\nIt’s helpful for us to remember the original objectives of the STIP:\n\n* To provide incentives to a diverse and inclusive group of Arbitrum projects.\n* To quickly establish an incentives program that is in harmony with Arbitrum’s values and constitution.\n* To generate robust, meaningful data to shape the future design of Arbitrum grants for projects of all types and sizes.\n\n# Motivation\n\n> Motivation - A statement on why the Arbitrum community should implement the AIP.\n\nHow can Arbitrum create an incentives structure to grow the ecosystem? STIP started when the community began investigating creative uses for incentives. A short-term program was devised to act quickly, collect data about how incentives are used by Arbitrum protocols, and learn from the results to design new programs and grow the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\nAn unexpected budget problem caused many successful STIP applications to receive no funding. The real-world consequence of this mistake caused the STIP sample to be cut in half - but not at random. To determine the final STIP cohort, the applications were sorted by approval, which inadvertently skewed the sample towards incumbent protocols. This sampling bias is most egregious for collecting data about the smallest protocols; over 70% of Beacon grants were rejected due to the sorting algorithm that was used. Consequently, STIP may not be collecting sufficient data about new builders on Arbitrum.\n\nThis AIP seeks to achieve STIP’s original motivations by:\n\n1. nearly doubling the sample size;\n2. adding protocols across a broad array of industry categories; and\n3. including protocols at different stages of development.\n\nThis AIP will ensure an important builder population is included in the study, while increasing the validity of the STIP results.\n\nOne of the most important questions facing Arbitrum today is how to grow the ecosystem and win the L2 Wars. STIP is a novel study on the impact of incentives for growing the Arbitrum ecosystem. In practice, the STIP excluded most new builders from the study, severely limiting the data that will be collected about the early stages of the builder pipeline. This AIP includes a broader range of protocols in the STIP study, ensuring that Arbitrum gets the data it needs about how incentives impact new builders in the Arbitrum ecosystem. It stands to reason that extending incentives to smaller projects could serve to incubate projects that grow into the high-usage dApps of tomorrow. Extending the STIP may not only increase the inclusivity of the program but also incentivize significant growth for the broader Arbitrum ecosystem at a lower cost per project, and this possibility is worth exploring.\n\n# Rationale\n\n`Rationale - An explanation of how the AIP aligns with the Arbitrum community's mission and guiding values`\n\nArbitrum’s community values highlight the importance of diversity, which increases the fitness of the entire Arbitrum ecosystem by representing the needs of many kinds of participants. The original work to design STIP was careful to consider how both large and small protocols would fare under the framework. However, the unexpected budget cutoff caused the sample to skew towards large protocols, which is at odds with the values of the Arbitrum community. The cost of falling short of this ideal is that STIP systematically overlooks the possibility that incentives might be uniquely interesting to small and new protocols. By failing to incorporate protocols at the first stages of the builders onboarding pipeline, Arbitrum will be unsure about how incentives operate among this crucial group of protocols.\n\nThe Arbitrum community also values neutrality, which received careful consideration during the STIP design stages. It was well-understood that incumbent protocols were likely to prevail with their STIP applications - but it was hoped this would not preclude smaller participants from also being funded. Unfortunately, this wish for inclusion was not fulfilled and - unintentional though it may have been - funding was nevertheless distributed according to a ranking that was likely to favor incumbents. Again, despite the best efforts of the DAO and the STIP designers, the result was at odds with the values of the Arbitrum community.\n\nAbove all, Arbitrum seeks to create and nurture a thriving ecosystem - and the DAO’s values are designed to provide guiding values that will always trend towards the health of the ecosystem. When the values aren’t met - even unintentionally - it is possible the best interests of the ecosystem aren’t met, either. In the case of STIP, accidentally excluding Beacon grants falls short of the community values - which, in all likelihood, is a critical oversight that Arbitrum would benefit from fixing.\n\n# Key Terms:\n\n* Approved but not funded STIP proposals\n* AIP-9\n* Backfund\n* Extension\n* STIP\n* STIP Round 1\n* STIP Backfunded\n\n# Specifications:\n\n`Specifications - A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used.`\n\nWill approve funding of an additional 21.4M ARB through the end of January 31, 2024.\n\nPlease note the STIP Backfund will leverage the multiple sections of [AIP-9 1](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131) such as [Specification section](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#financial-proposal-5) and [Outstanding Questions and Concerns](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#outstanding-questions-and-concerns-13) and specifically:\n\n* [Financial Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#financial-proposal-5)\n* [Multisig Setup](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#eligibility-and-evaluation-guidelines-7)\n* [Eligibility Requirements](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#what-are-the-eligibility-requirements-6) and [Eligibility and Evaluation Guidelines](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#eligibility-and-evaluation-guidelines-7).\n* [KPIs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#what-are-the-eligibility-requirements-6)\n\nSteps to Implement - The steps to implement the AIP, including associated costs, manpower, and other resources for each step where applicable.

      "content": "##### **Abstract**\nCreating a procurement framework for security-oriented service providers within the ArbitrumDAO. The proposal aims to create a streamlined & harmonised approach re. service procurement for security-oriented services.\n\n##### **Motivation**\nProcurement Frameworks maintain quality control, ensuring consistency in the services procured. These frameworks also promote transparency and fairness, building trust and adhering to legal standards. Moreover, they aid in risk management, safeguarding against various procurement-related risks, and streamline processes for time-saving and operational efficiency.\n\n##### **Rationale**\nThis procurement framework is designed to ensure that only qualified and reliable security service providers are selected, thereby safeguarding the integrity and security of the projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem. This will aid in ensuring that the security-specific needs of projects building within the Ecosystem are safeguarded to a larger extent & thus serve to safeguard the high standards and reputation of the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n##### **Specifications & Timeline**\nSpecifications & Timeline can be found in the following sections.\n\n###### **Steps to Implement**\nThis AIP will move to a Snapshot vote on the 24th of November 2023. Passing of the Snapshot vote will be deemed as a ratification of the Procurement Framework. There are no associated costs with the implementation of the Procurement Framework.\n\n##### **Overall Cost**\nNo cost for AIP implementation.\n\n---\n\n## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**\n\n- This procurement process is designed to ensure that only the most qualified and reliable security service providers are selected, thereby safeguarding the integrity and security of the projects within the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n- Should the ArbitrumDAO vote for the implementation/ratification of this framework, we wil then be proposing the setup of the Procurement Committee that will facilitate & administer this framework.\n- The proposal for the procurement committee will also contain further details on the operational implementations that are to be effected in documenting, record-keeping, and disclosing material in relation to the procurement framework.\n\nThe document outlines a comprehensive procurement framework for the Arbitrum Ecosystem, focusing on sourcing and selecting service providers for blockchain security and related services. It comprises several key components:\n\n- Needs Assessment: Identifying and prioritizing the specific requirements of the Arbitrum Ecosystem, including evaluating the current situation and determining market availability for the required services.\n- Defining Eligibility Criteria: Establishing standards for technical expertise, reputation, tools and techniques, and financial stability that service providers must meet to be considered.\n- Publication of Request for Proposal (RFP): Detailing the scope of work required and the submission guidelines for prospective service providers, along with evaluation criteria and a timeline for the procurement process.\n- Proposal Submission: Requiring service providers to submit comprehensive documentation for evaluation, with submissions made via ArbitrumDAO Forums, allowing community feedback and private collection of sensitive information.\n- Evaluation of Proposals: This includes initial screening for eligibility, in-depth technical and commercial evaluations, reference checks, and possibly interviews, with a focus on transparency and community involvement.\n- Whitelisting, Onboarding & Contracting: Selecting the most suitable service providers, conducting Know-Your-Business processes, facilitating contract negotiations, and finalizing approval of agreements.\n- Ongoing Obligations and Ancillary Matters: Monitoring performance, establishing feedback loops, setting renewal criteria, outlining exit strategies, and ensuring thorough documentation and record-keeping using tools like Airtable for transparency.\n- Public Disclosure: Making key details of the procurement process and the list of whitelisted providers publicly available, respecting confidentiality agreements.\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/9/96d131d75a56e3d72921707f2756d78262307f1a_2_548x411.png)\n\n---\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\n[1] On the 3rd of November, DK (Myself) posted a proposal on the Arbitrum DAO Forums aimed at establishing a framework for security-oriented proposals via a consolidated framework ([Consolidate Security Proposals into a RFP Process](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-consolidate-security-proposals-into-a-rfp-process/19328)). By way of a summary, the proposal on the Arbitrum DAO forum discusses establishing a Request for Proposal (RFP) process to consolidate the selection of auditors and security service providers within the Arbitrum ecosystem (for the purposes of this endeavor, we shall be referring to this consolidated framework as the ‘Procurement Framework).\n\n[2] The Snapshot Vote for the establishment of the aforementioned Procurement Framework has since passed ([Snapshot 1](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1ac6079871dc4af55b7d67eae130e4c1bbcbabd9bb35405bc1733ef2efe45875)).\n\n[3] On the 10th of November, Immutablelawyer posted a public consultation period on the Arbitrum Forums ([Public Consultation re. 'Consolidate Security Proposals into an RFP Process'](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/public-consultation-re-consolidate-security-proposals-into-an-rfp-process/19478)). This contained a base-line framework aimed at giving some context to community members & relevant stakeholders intending on participating in the public consultation. The Public Consultation ended on the 22nd of November 2023. Following calls held, submissions received & several discussions with numerous ecosystem participants, we would now like to present the final procurement framework for ratification via Snapshot.\n\nWe would like to thank all participants who took their time to provide insight in this endeavor. This was a true testament to the collaborative nature of this ecosystem.\n\nCopy of Proposal in Google Docs: [Snapshot Proposal Ratification: Procurement Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g1W9BYCNMYWi67E4Zj_TjdtCke321fTL3yhpIuo73HY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n---\n\n## [Procurement Framework for Ratification](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-constitutional-procurement-framework-security-service-providers/19704#procurement-framework-for-ratification-2)\n\n### **1. ‘Needs’ Assessment**\n\n- Gather Phase: Collect detailed information on what is needed in the Arbitrum Ecosystem. This involves understanding the specific requirements of the end-users, the goals of relevant stakeholders, and any constraints (budgetary, time, legal, regulatory, procedural etc.). This stage often involves interviews, surveys, or group discussions with stakeholders.\n- Analyze Current Situation: Assess the current resources, systems, or services in place. Determine if there are gaps between the current state and the desired state. This analysis should consider whether existing solutions can be upgraded or if new solutions are needed.\n- Define the Scope of the Need: Clearly define what is needed to address the gap identified in the current situation analysis. This definition should be as specific as possible, outlining the functionalities, features, quality standards, quantities, and any other relevant attributes that are relevant.\n- Prioritize Needs: Not all needs have the same level of urgency or importance. Prioritize the needs based on factors like strategic importance, impact on operations, cost-benefit analysis, risk mitigation, and regulatory compliance.\n- Assess Market Availability: Research the market to understand what products or services are available that meet the needs identified above.\n\n### **1.1. Defining Eligibility Criteria**\n\n- Technical Expertise: Prospective Service Providers must demonstrate expertise in blockchain security, including prior experience with smart contracts, the Ethereum network, and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum.\n- Reputation: A track record of successful security audits, with references and case studies.\n- Tools and Techniques: Tools for detecting vulnerabilities, including static and dynamic analysis, and formal verification methods.\n- Financial Stability: Proof of financial stability to ensure the longevity and reliability of the service provider.\n\n### **2. Publication of the Request for Proposal (RFP)**\n\n- Scope of Work: Following the conclusion of the ‘Needs Assessment’ in the Procurement Committee will publish a request for submissions. This will be done via the ArbitrumDAO Forums wherein a detailed description of services required, including security audit scope, frequency, and expected deliverables will be provided by the PC.\n- Submission Guidelines: Clear instructions on how to apply, including formats and submission channels will be provided for prospective applicants so that the approach is harmonized in nature.\n- Evaluation Criteria: Metrics on how prospective service providers [as per ‘Eligibility Critera’].\n- Timeline: Submission deadlines and timeline for the evaluation process.\n\n### **3. Proposal Submission**\n\n- Documentation: Applicant service providers must submit comprehensive documentation, including company profiles, client testimonials, and detailed descriptions of methodologies.\n- Submissions: Will be effected on a dedicated section of the ArbitrumDAO Forums. This way, the PC can already get a sense of community feedback prior to putting the security service provider through the procurement process. Financial statements will & other ancillary information will not be required to be posted publicly but will be collected through private channels.\n\n### **4.

      "title": "Funding Gas Rebate and Trading Competition Program to Amplify Arbitrum’s Ecosystem Growth ",
      "content": "Abstract:\nThis Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP) is presented with the vision of further enhancing the Arbitrum ecosystem following the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP). Acknowledging the STIP’s instrumental role in the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem, this proposal seeks to extend its positive impact by introducing a gas rebate and trading incentive program created by Rage Trade, a native perp aggregator on Arbitrum. Through this initiative, we aspire to not only complement the milestones achieved by the STIP but also to significantly increase the influx of new traders into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nMotivation:\nAs the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP) kicks off, it sets the stage for the Arbitrum ecosystem to experience amplified growth. The STIP is poised to play a pivotal role in promoting on-chain activities and reinforcing key protocols. However, there is plenty of opportunity to intensify user engagement and participation, especially when considering innovative platforms like Rage Trade.\n\nThis proposal is driven by the ambition to harness this potential, acting synergistically with the anticipated successes of the STIP. Through Rage Trade’s introduction of a gas rebate and trading incentive program, our objective is not just to elevate trading activity, but also to enhance the overall user experience, attracting and onboarding new traders to the ecosystem. This effort is geared towards empowering platforms that, in line with Arbitrum’s vision, are poised for growth but require additional support to maximize their contribution.\n\nRationale:\n\nThis proposal aligns with Arbitrum’s mission to foster a dynamic and engaged community. By allocating 100% of the grant funds to create a gas rebate and trading incentives program, Rage Trade’s platform aims to refine the user experience of traders while offering gas savings and trading incentives to stimulate a competitive yet cooperative environment.\n\nSpecifications: A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used.\nRage Trade Platform:\n\nAs a prime broker and perpetual aggregator, Rage Trade unifies top decentralized perpetual exchanges across all EVM-compatible chains. It streamlines the trading experience by eliminating complexities associated with collateral and gas fund management, ensuring a faster, more efficient, and user-friendly environment for traders.\n\nGas Tank Mechanism:\n\nThe Gas Tank is a unique feature of Rage Trade that simplifies trading across different chains. Users deposit funds into their account, and a portion goes into the Gas Tank. This fund is then used to cover gas fees across various chains, eliminating the need for users to manage gas fees separately.\n\nSession-Based Trading System:\n\nRage Trade employs a session-based trading system where users create a session that lasts for a specified duration (e.g., 7 days). This system reduces the need for manual transaction signing, making the trading experience smoother and more akin to centralized exchanges.\n\nMulti-Leg Trading and Auto-Populating Bridge:\n\nThe platform allows users to create multiple trades from different chains and perps on Arbitrum, enabling them to spread risk and optimize execution. Additionally, Rage Trade handles all the bridging details, automatically selecting the best bridge or swap routes for seamless trade execution.\n\nCustom Route Selection:\n\nUsers have the option to split their orders based on various criteria such as best execution price, lowest funding fees, or routes with bonuses like emissions or airdrops. This feature provides flexibility and optimization for trade execution.\n\nAggregated Referral & Competitions:\n\nRage Trade aggregates referrals and competitions across different perp protocols, allowing users to participate in various trading competitions and referral programs through a single platform.\n\nIncentive Distribution:\n\nThe proposal involves the distribution of 1.5 million ARB tokens to incentivize trading volume on Rage Trade. The distribution will be structured to reward active traders and participants in trading competitions, fostering increased engagement and liquidity on the platform.\n\nTrading Competitions:\n\nA series of trading competitions will be organized, with ARB tokens allocated as prizes. These competitions aim to attract traders, boost trading volume, and create a vibrant trading community on Rage Trade.\n\nUser Engagement and Performance Metrics:\nRage Trade has successfully cultivated a dynamic user base, boasting 70,000 active traders who regularly engage with our platform. This robust participation is a testament to our platform’s appeal and functionality within the trading community.\n\nIn addition to our active traders, we have nurtured a strong Liquidity Provider (LP) community, with 26,000 LPs contributing to our ecosystem. This substantial number of LPs underscores our platform’s reliability and the trust placed in us by those who provide liquidity, further cementing our role as a pivotal player in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nOverall, our protocol’s historical performance not only demonstrates significant growth and adoption but also highlights our consistent delivery of value to our users, traders, and liquidity providers. These metrics are indicative of our integral position within the Arbitrum ecosystem and our potential to further enhance and expand our offerings with sustained support.\n\nRage’s Perpetual Performance:\n\nRage Trade v1 has experienced a remarkable market reception, evidenced by a staggering $735M in Total Trading Volume against Rage’s Total Value Locked (TVL). This impressive figure reflects the high demand and active engagement within our user base, showcasing the platform’s appeal and effectiveness.\n\n\n\n962×642 21.9 KB\nRage’s Vaults Performance:\n\nOur vault offerings, including the 80-20 Tricrypto Vault and GLP Vault, have achieved a notable peak TVL of approximately $19.87 million (at 100% max capacity since launch). This achievement highlights the trust and confidence users place in our vault products.\n\nAt its peak, Rage Trade accounted for about 1.4% of the entire Arbitrum TVL, marking our significant contribution to the overall ecosystem. This percentage represents our substantial impact and the value we add to the broader Arbitrum community.\n\nThe 80-20 Tricrypto vault, in particular, has demonstrated exceptional performance. Over its 10-month lifespan, it outperformed holding GLP by 8%. Specifically, from July 2022 to April 2023, the 80-20 Tricrypto vault yielded a 44% return compared to a 36% return from merely holding GLP, showcasing its effectiveness and profitability.\n\nSteps to Implement: The steps to implement the AIP, including associated costs, manpower, and other resources for each step where applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, any AIPs involving transactions with third parties (such as grants) will need to ensure that applicable legal documentation and procedures are also included.\nTo implement this proposal, we will follow a structured approach, ensuring each phase contributes effectively to the overall goal. Here’s how we plan to proceed:\n\nData Reporting and Transparency: Rage Trade is committed to transparency and will implement Dune dashboards for real-time tracking of all relevant metrics. These dashboards will ensure community members have access to up-to-date data, reflecting our progress and adherence to the commitments outlined in this proposal. This approach emphasizes our dedication to transparency and accountability within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nIncentive Allocation: We will begin by using a portion of the ARB tokens for our gas rebate program to offset gas fees for our users. This will serve as the initial spark to ignite trading activities on the Rage Trade platform.\n\nFee Offset & Trading Competitions: We will then allocate the remaining tokens to incentivize trading, including trade competitions and offsetting fees implemented by integrated perp protocols. The trading competitions will be strategically scheduled over time to ensure ongoing participation and interest.\n\nRegular Updates and Reporting: Throughout the implementation, we will continuously monitor platform performance, trader engagement, and community feedback. This will allow us to make real-time adjustments and improvements where necessary. To maintain transparency, we will provide the community with regular updates and reports. These will include key performance metrics and insights gained from the implementation process.\n\nReview and Analysis: At the end of the implementation phase, we will conduct a thorough review. This will involve analyzing successes, identifying areas for improvement, and extracting key learnings for future initiatives.\n\nBy following these steps, we aim to ensure not just the successful implementation of the proposal but also to contribute valuable insights for the continuous growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nTimeline: Relevant timing details, including but not limited to start date, milestones, and completion dates.\nThe implementation of this proposal is structured into a 4-month period, with each month focusing on specific objectives and milestones:\n\nMonth 1 - Initiation and Setup (Immediately upon approval):\n\nAllocation of ARB tokens to the designated multisig wallet to immediately initiate gas rebates and trading fee offsets. Setup of the Dune dashboard for tracking key metrics such as trading volume and unique traders. Announcement of the initiative and upcoming trading competitions to the community.\n\nMonth 2 - Launch of Trading Competitions:\n\nOfficial launch of the first set of trading competitions.\n\nActive monitoring of trading activities and engagement levels.\n\nFirst monthly update provided to the community, highlighting early results and trader participation.\n\nMonth 3 - Mid-term Review and Adjustments:\n\nComprehensive review of the first two months, analyzing trader engagement and competition outcomes.\n\nAdjustments made to competitions and incentives based on feedback and data analysis.\n\nSecond monthly update provided, including insights and any changes implemented.\n\nMonth 4 - Final Push and Comprehensive Analysis:\n\nContinued incentivization and promotion of trading activities.\n\nFinal monthly update provided, leading up to the comprehensive quarterly report.\n\nPreparation of the detailed analysis report, evaluating the proposal’s success based on predefined objectives.\n\nPost-4-Month Period - Evaluation and Reporting:\n\nRelease of a comprehensive quarterly report, detailing the overall impact of the proposal on trading volume, trader engagement, and growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Evaluation of the initiative’s success and consideration of potential future actions based on the outcomes.\n\nThis timeline ensures a structured approach to implementing the proposal, with regular updates and transparency. It allows for adjustments based on real-time data and community feedback, ensuring the initiative remains aligned with its goal of driving growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nTo measure the success of achieving the grant objectives, we will focus on the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nDaily Volume: Aiming for a 30-day moving average of $10M in daily volume.\nDaily Traders: Targeting a 30-day moving average of 300 unique traders.\nIntegration: Committing to integrate 1 or more perpetual DEXes per 2 weeks (accounting for audit time).\nThese KPIs will serve as benchmarks to gauge our progress and effectiveness in utilizing the grant to drive growth and engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nGrant Breakdown:\nRage Trade aims to leverage the grant to attract a substantial influx of users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, bolstering user interaction, transaction volume, TVL, and overall activity.\n\nStrategically, Rage Trade will allocate ~ 33% of the grant to gas rebates, with the other ~ 66% of the grant being directed towards offsetting integrated perp protocols’ trading fees and various trading competitions. The endgame is to amplify user onboarding and trading enthusiasm, resonating with genuine market dynamics.\n\nIt’s crucial to clarify that rebate rates will be determined by the genuine fees incurred by users. If our partnering protocols grant separate rebates or rewards, Rage Trade commits to ensuring that the total sum of rebates will never surpass the fees accrued. Throughout this promotional phase, trade-to-earn schemes will not be entertained. Additionally, the Rage Trade team will vigilantly deter and counteract wash trading and Sybil-attack incidents. Offending addresses linked with such activities will be publicly disclosed and denied the associated rebates.\n\nGas Rebates Explained:\nOnce a week, traders will receive ARB tokens as a gas rebate, mirroring the gas fees they’ve incurred throughout the week. This rebate system ensures that users can trade more freely, knowing a portion of their gas fees will be returned. The gas rebate will be uniformly applied across all protocols integrated with Rage Trade on Arbitrum, ensuring fairness and consistency for all traders. The rebate amount a trader receives will be directly proportional to the actual gas fees they’ve paid, eliminating any potential for manipulative practices like trade-to-earn schemes.\n\nFee Rebates Explained:\n\nARB tokens will be rewarded as fee rebates to our traders every Friday, reflecting the fees they’ve accumulated over the week.\n\nThis fee waiver will be consistently applied across all collaborating protocols.\n\nTraders’ rebate entitlements will strictly correlate with their actual trading fees, nullifying the chance for trade-to-earn practices. The rate of expenditure from the grant will be contingent on the volume of organic trading transpiring each week. The Rage Trade team pledges to continually identify and thwart wash trading and sybil-attack attempts.\n\nTo safeguard the integrity of the campaign, the specifics of the anti-wash-trading & anti-sybil-attack measures will be kept confidential and will be communicated post-event, mirroring best practices employed in protocol airdrop launches.\n\nExample of Fee Structure Post-Reduction:\n\nIf additional perps trading mechanisms in the Arbitrum realm are incorporated with Rage Trade amidst this campaign, the fee waiver will extend to those as well.\n\nIntegrated protocol trading fee rates before and after reduction\n\nGMX V1: 0.1% → 0%\n\nGMX V2: 0.05% / 0.07% → 0%\n\nOverall Cost: The total cost to implement the AIP.\nThe total cost to implement this AIP for Rage Trade is 1.5M ARB tokens. This cost is solely dedicated to funding trading competitions and volume incentives on the Rage Trade platform. The breakdown is as follows:\n\nGas Rebates: 500k ARB tokens will be allocated for offsetting gas fees when trading perps on Arbitrum.\n\nTrading Fee Rebates & Competitions: The remaining 1m ARB will be used as trading fee offsets and trading competitions.\n\nThere are no additional costs involved in this proposal. The entire 1.5M ARB token request is focused on directly incentivizing users and enhancing their trading experience on Rage Trade.",

As a preliminary document, it seeks input from both the Arbitrum DAO and the Liquidity Working Group.\n* This proposal frequently cites AIP-9.\n* For all of our resources see here: [svy.gg/stip-backfund (DocSend)](https:/svy.gg/stip-backfund)\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal outlines a one-time backfund to all \"approved but not funded proposals’’ from Arbitrum STIP. The proposed AIP increases the total budget by 21.4M to 71.4M while increasing the total participating protocols by 26, for a total of 56 funded projects. The program plans to allocate DAO-owned ARB towards incentives while leveraging distribution systems, consensus, and delegate diligence already created from STIP 1.\n\nThis program is designed to backfund approved protocols while maintaining the timelines and systems of STIP 1:\n\n* Timeline: The program is scheduled to commence and conclude concurrently with STIP 1, or within a similar timeframe, starting from the first week of November and running through January 31, 2024.\n* KYC: The program will utilize the same KYC system as STIP 1.\n* Reporting: Participating grantees are required to self-report data, maintain dashboards, and regularly summarize grant performance\n\n# Considerations\n\nBefore this proposal was drafted, a working group was formed to gauge sentiment, gather key data points, and outline the proposal's structure. The working group collaborated with delegates and projects affected by the STIP, engaging in multiple calls—including sessions with the creators of the STIP and the Incentive Working Group—to solicit feedback and refine the proposal accordingly.\n\nKey concerns discussed include:\n\n### Why not just push towards a round 2 and go through voting for all proposals again?\n\nFirst and foremost, we believe that the successful execution of this Backfund proposal will, in time, serve as a crucial catalyst for future grant structures, including a successful STIP round 2. Why? This opportunity will unify the Arbitrum ecosystem by addressing key weaknesses in the original STIP 1 structure by quickly providing approved projects and other stakeholders with the resources/data needed to design and support future programs.\n\nKey issues associated with delaying an immediate backfund and moving towards a round 2 include:\n\n* Proper design and execution add considerable time delay to a highly competitive environment within Arbitrum and other L2s\n* Requires teams with limited resources approved already for STIP 1 to spend significant time lobbying delegates\n* Removes attention away from new Round 2 proposals\n* Adds additional burden to delegates that should be focused on long-term design improvements and new STIP grants not yet approved\n* Removes key data for STIP experiment analysis by skewing learnings towards larger, well-established projects\n* Delays the alignment of the STIP with the Arbitrum constitution values of inclusivity and diversity\n* Negatively impacts new builder sentiment towards Arbitrum at a critical time in the L2 Wars\n\n\n### The budget set aside was 50M, and the DAO decided that was the acceptable spend for a short-term incentive.\n\nWhile the budget was set at 50M, the original working group proposed 75M so that:\n\n> \"The budget was raised to 75M ARB to accommodate larger protocols (Pinnacle Grants) without compromising smaller applications.\" [tnorm, September 3rd 2023.](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131/12)\n\nExcess demand was a significant possibility due to the high interest in STIP and the absence of a cap for Pinnacle grants. Voters lacked the data to ascertain whether the initial 50M would be adequate to achieve the objectives of STIP.\n\nNoteworthy is that, in the event of excess demand, measures including backfunding were already outlined as potential options.\n\nProper design and fulfillment of a Round 2 or similar future funding programs may take time to develop. Meanwhile, projects that received approval but no funding have immediate initiatives requiring support. Our opportunity is to fund these initiatives, level the competitive playing field, and enhance the data available for the STIP process.\n\n \n![3698b8811ac5887c127ab2bbfc94d7f6dcbd554a_2_624x285.jpg](ipfs://bafkreibtmidazgguawh6jfzjpsmn35br2qv3uba23zvdz3kffhdwc4hyj4)\n \n![8487c56a2a8f7c7f6dd102ad36e9a20b7459b041_2_624x356.png](ipfs://bafybeihuzqen65up5nh4t666unrsu6i7mtdbazw2tcicvqewmmrx2j3zdy)\n    \n    \n\n\n### Voting behaviors for a 50M proposal shouldn’t carry over to a proposal that includes the additional backfunded amounts.\n\nDuring our consultation process, we engaged in numerous discussions that brought forth questions about backfunding. Despite the criticisms, backfunding remains the most straightforward method to address the current STIP’s skewed sample size. We advocate that backfunding is the optimal approach to achieve the STIP’s intended outcomes—specifically, to examine the impact that incentives have on the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem. \n\nFurthermore, if the STIP continues without rectifying the issues with its sample, the analysis will be compromised by a significant methodological flaw. Backfunding is not just the “best” option; it is essential for preserving the integrity of the STIP overall.\n\nVoting behavior might have differed if the budget cap were set at 75M or 100M. The only way to determine this would be to repeat the experiment with a raised cap (an option that is unfeasible as time travel has not yet been realized).\n\nIt's helpful for us to remember the original objectives of the STIP:\n\n* To provide incentives to a diverse and inclusive group of Arbitrum projects.\n* To quickly establish an incentives program that is in harmony with Arbitrum's values and constitution.\n* To generate robust, meaningful data to shape the future design of Arbitrum grants for projects of all types and sizes.\n\n\n# Motivation\n\n> Motivation - A statement on why the Arbitrum community should implement the AIP.\n\nHow can Arbitrum create an incentives structure to grow the ecosystem? STIP started when the community began investigating creative uses for incentives. A short-term program was devised to act quickly, collect data about how incentives are used by Arbitrum protocols, and learn from the results to design new programs and grow the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\nAn unexpected budget problem caused many successful STIP applications to receive no funding. The real-world consequence of this mistake caused the STIP sample to be cut in half - but not at random. To determine the final STIP cohort, the applications were sorted by approval, which inadvertently skewed the sample towards incumbent protocols. This sampling bias is most egregious for collecting data about the smallest protocols; over 70% of Beacon grants were rejected due to the sorting algorithm that was used. Consequently, STIP may not be collecting sufficient data about new builders on Arbitrum.\n\nThis AIP seeks to achieve STIP's original motivations by:\n\n1) nearly doubling the sample size;\n2) adding protocols across a broad array of industry categories; and\n3) including protocols at different stages of development.\n\nThis AIP will ensure an important builder population is included in the study, while increasing the validity of the STIP results.\n\nOne of the most important questions facing Arbitrum today is how to grow the ecosystem and win the L2 Wars. STIP is a novel study on the impact of incentives for growing the Arbitrum ecosystem. In practice, the STIP excluded most new builders from the study, severely limiting the data that will be collected about the early stages of the builder pipeline. This AIP includes a broader range of protocols in the STIP study, ensuring that Arbitrum gets the data it needs about how incentives impact new builders in the Arbitrum ecosystem. It stands to reason that extending incentives to smaller projects could serve to incubate projects that grow into the high-usage dApps of tomorrow. Extending the STIP may not only increase the inclusivity of the program but also incentivize significant growth for the broader Arbitrum ecosystem at a lower cost per project, and this possibility is worth exploring.\n\n# Rationale\n\n`Rationale - An explanation of how the AIP aligns with the Arbitrum community's mission and guiding values`\n\nArbitrum's community values highlight the importance of diversity, which increases the fitness of the entire Arbitrum ecosystem by representing the needs of many kinds of participants. The original work to design STIP was careful to consider how both large and small protocols would fare under the framework. However, the unexpected budget cutoff caused the sample to skew towards large protocols, which is at odds with the values of the Arbitrum community. The cost of falling short of this ideal is that STIP systematically overlooks the possibility that incentives might be uniquely interesting to small and new protocols. By failing to incorporate protocols at the first stages of the builders onboarding pipeline, Arbitrum will be unsure about how incentives operate among this crucial group of protocols.\n\nThe Arbitrum community also values neutrality, which received careful consideration during the STIP design stages. It was well-understood that incumbent protocols were likely to prevail with their STIP applications - but it was hoped this would not preclude smaller participants from also being funded. Unfortunately, this wish for inclusion was not fulfilled and - unintentional though it may have been - funding was nevertheless distributed according to a ranking that was likely to favor incumbents. Again, despite the best efforts of the DAO and the STIP designers, the result was at odds with the values of the Arbitrum community.\n\nAbove all, Arbitrum seeks to create and nurture a thriving ecosystem - and the DAO's values are designed to provide guiding values that will always trend towards the health of the ecosystem. When the values aren't met - even unintentionally - it is possible the best interests of the ecosystem aren't met, either. In the case of STIP, accidentally excluding Beacon grants falls short of the community values - which, in all likelihood, is a critical oversight that Arbitrum would benefit from fixing.\n\n# Key Terms:\n\n- Approved but not funded STIP proposals\n- AIP-9\n- Backfund\n- Extension\n- STIP\n- STIP Round 1\n- STIP Backfunded\n\n# Specifications:\n\n`Specifications - A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used.`\n\nWill approve funding of an additional 21.4M ARB through the end of January 31, 2024.\n\nPlease note the STIP Backfund will leverage the multiple sections of [AIP-9](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131) such as [Specification section](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#financial-proposal-5) and [Outstanding Questions and Concerns](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#outstanding-questions-and-concerns-13) and specifically:\n\n* [Financial Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#financial-proposal-5)\n* [Multisig Setup](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#eligibility-and-evaluation-guidelines-7)\n* [Eligibility Requirements](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#what-are-the-eligibility-requirements-6) and [Eligibility and Evaluation Guidelines](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#eligibility-and-evaluation-guidelines-7).\n* [KPIs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131#what-are-the-eligibility-requirements-6)\n\nSteps to Implement - \nThe steps to implement the AIP, including associated costs, manpower, and other resources for each step where applicable.

      "title": "The Arbitrum Coalition",
      "content": "Non-Constitutional\n\nAbstract\nTLDR: This proposal funds a coalition led by Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits in order to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 12 months.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition is an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aims to execute turnkey R&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate is to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition will provide the necessary resources so that the DAO can make informed decisions.\n\nMotivation\nThe Arbitrum forum includes many worthwhile suggestions, but often lacks the required research, coordination, design, and risk assessment to move forward optimally. For example, iterating on proposals, drumming up delegate awareness, and finding the necessary partners to execute an idea are often difficult tasks. The Arbitrum Coalition’s mandate is to help distill information and accelerate governance decision-making so DAO participants can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Coalition has best-in-class experience/specialized expertise and personnel to execute on this venture and are all already notable contributors to the DAO. Areas of expertise include but are not limited to research, framework creation, risk assessment, secure code reviews, threat modeling, and testing enhancements.The Coalition will take the necessary steps to ensure the Arbitrum DAO has the resources it needs to accomplish its goals.\n\nAs a case study demonstrating the need for the Coalition, there was a lot of discussion around returning tokens 3 accidentally sent to the airdrop address back to the recipients. However, there was no one to call on to look at the landscape of how other protocols deal with this issue, design and implement a mechanism, or take it through the governance process. Likewise, the DAO has seen multiple grant programs suggested but has not been able to assess what has worked or not worked for similar programs in the past from an objective perspective. A multitude of such cases can be seen over Arbitrum DAO’s short tenure. These are the exact roles the coalition will undertake for ideas that gain traction among DAO stakeholders.\n\nHad the coalition existed during the time of the STIP proposal, it would have played a pivotal role in alleviating many of the inefficiencies and challenges delegates faced in the process. Blockworks Research and Gauntlet would have been prepared to develop comprehensive resources in support of the program end-to-end. From simplifying the evaluation of proposals with concise explanations and quantitative analysis to simplifying the voting process for delegates, and ultimately eliminating the need for a second process aimed at finding a service provider to monitor and analyze the program once live, by doing it ourselves. While we did make modest contributions in this regard 4 [2 1], our commitment would have been backed by substantially greater resources. In addition, the Coalition would (and will, should this proposal pass) do its own analysis of how this STIP program performed (after the fact) and provide feedback and recommendations on how to improve it in the future. The Coalition would have advocated for streamlined voting methods in place of 105 separate votes and created efficient voting dashboards, reducing the reliance on last-minute community-funded solutions. While it’s a missed opportunity, it highlights the potential for future value.\n\nAdditionally, complex mechanism designs like creating a permissionless validator set (BOLD) and sequencer design (timeboost) can be made more easily understandable for ARB delegates with support from the Coalition and researched impartially versus other potential solutions when proposals of this nature inevitably go on the forum.\n\nThe Coalition will help community stakeholders make the best possible decisions when it comes to AIPs. For example, Trail of Bits will aim to review each onchain proposal’s source code to ensure it achieves what is stated. This code review ability is a feat many delegates cannot achieve on their own and will be extremely useful to enable competent voting. Blockworks Research will distill the competitive landscape and underlying technology and Gauntlet will be able assess potential risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nAn example that demonstrates the value the Coalition will provide relates to support decision-making for the Arbitrum Plutus DAO proposal to Activate ARB Staking 8. Adding an inflation rate to the token poses concerns around risks to the token, new independently created staking contracts would need to be audited, and it would be helpful if delegates had access to quantitative research surrounding how inflation has impacted other tokens in the past. The Coalition can work together to provide objective analysis, quantitative research, and, if desired by the community, audits and execution for this proposal and others like it.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition will help the DAO reduce friction and operate effectively. Having three of the most experienced service providers in crypto best positioned and resourced to act at the behest of the DAO will be a tremendous value add.\n\nRationale\nOne key difference between Arbitrum and many other protocols is the immense power given to the DAO at token generation, which makes the DAO fully responsible for the coordination and growth of the protocol.\n\nArbitrum’s impressive decentralization demonstrates that the DAO can’t rely on single entities such as Offchain Labs or the Arbitrum Foundation. Any steps taken to help create a robust decentralized ecosystem of service providers so that the DAO is not dependent on any single entity is a step in the right direction. This way if any one organization falls, is negatively regulated, or otherwise encumbered, the protocol continues to march forward. The Arbitrum Coalition is the first initiative toward this overarching goal.\n\nAdditionally, the Coalition will aid in bringing more service providers subservient to the DAO. For example, it can be a steward in creating a methodology for other budgeted entities to come into existence.\n\nOther DAOs have a diverse ecosystem of service providers who help the DAO operate efficiently. The Coalition will be the first entity working towards this overarching structure such that over time the DAO will have an ecosystem of service providers executing on key roles like grants, development, growth, risk, legal, and more. This is a necessity in maintaining a truly decentralized and efficiently operating DAO.\n\nTwo additional benefits to funding the coalition will be the professionalization of DAO undertakings and growth for Arbitrum. All representatives of the coalition are professional and will bring competent and effective work and communication into the DAO that should help proposals move along with less friction. Additionally, the entities involved have a combined audience of far over 500,000 and will be sure to produce public content on the work we do for the DAO to hopefully drive more users and developers into the ecosystem.\n\nThe Coalition’s purpose is not to replace delegates, but rather to support, serve, and empower both them and the community as a whole with tools and deep insights to streamline effective decision making.\n\nIntroduction to The Coalition\nTrail of Bits: Since 2012, Trail of Bits has helped secure some of the world’s most targeted organizations and devices. They combine high-end security research with a real-world attacker mentality to reduce risk and fortify code. They have worked extensively with Offchain Labs and performed over 1,800 hours of security review of Arbitrum through four focused engagements, including Nitro and Arbitrum V2. Many firms in DeFi, including Optimism, Balancer, Uniswap, and Compound 1 trust Trail of Bits expertise to help secure their code, and you can find many more in their Publications repository. They’ve succeeded in finding vulnerabilities in highly verified systems 1 and providing the best solutions regardless of whether they invented them. They are relentless about raising the baseline in the communities they work, and have developed and made freely available some of the most-used security tools, reference guides, and security 1 research in the industry.\n\nGauntlet: Gauntlet 3’s quantitative optimization solutions drive rapid and sustainable growth for DeFi’s top protocols, DAOs, and ecosystems through research 2, reports 2, products 2, and bespoke engagements 4. Gauntlet has the longest track record in DeFi risk management, with a managed peak at $40+B for DeFi protocols such as Aave and Compound.\n\nBlockworks Research: Blockworks Research 1 is a team of analysts that delivers institutional-grade data-driven research and analysis for L1s, L2s, DeFi, and gaming/consumer applications. Our team is well-known in the industry for producing high-quality, actionable research reports and data dashboards covering various topics, including L2s, dApps, tokenomics, technical upgrades, emerging trends, governance, MEV, and market analysis. The team is divided into protocol-specific coverage so that our analysts are experts in their respective niches. Blockworks Research is a branch of Blockworks 1, a media company hosting conferences, podcasts, and an editorial site.\n\nKey Terms\nThe Arbitrum Coalition (“the Coalition”): A group initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits whose mandate is to empower delegates with resources for making the most informed decisions possible.\n\nDAO Advocate: A single designated entity that maintains the ability to direct the coalition’s efforts. Functions as a referee between the DAO and the coalition. We suggest L2BEAT fulfill the role of the Advocate as a proven good actor for the Arbitrum DAO given their contributions and status in the DAO. The advocate will receive a stipend of $8,000 per month for their work. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring the DAO’s best interests are met by the Coalition.\n\nCoalition Member Termination: Ultimately, and above all, this Coalition will exist to serve the Arbitrum DAO. As such, individual members of the Coalition can be considered for replacement if their service does not meet the standards of this proposal or the DAO’s expectation. In the scenario a Coalition Member is considered for replacement, the DAO will need to examine the list of alternative vendors as well as any new market entrants eligible for consideration and pass a vote through\na Snapshot vote (reaching quorum) to stop the following payments to the vendor and replace said entity with a counterpart. The Coalition member will be considered terminated upon the vote passing. The same process may be executed in order to terminate and stop the stream of funds for the entirety of the Coalition and/or the DAO Advocate.\n\nCoalition Member Exit: As a malleable entity, if a member of the Arbitrum Coalition wishes to exit for any reason, they may do so by providing a two week lead time of departure and offer a list of viable replacements. Payments to the Member will stop 14 days after notice is given.\n\nSpecifications\nThe advocate will have the ability to call on the coalition for R&D efforts at their discretion and act as the DAO’s representative to ensure that the Coalition is working on the most value-added initiatives and providing beyond satisfactory value. The advocate will solely act on the DAO’s behalf and function as a facilitator. From analysis, to modeling, to payload the Coalition will tackle and streamline workstreams together.\n\nThe roles of the Coalition include but are not limited to:\n\nTrail of Bits: Reviewing onchain upgrade proposals to ensure that they align with the design and specification of the proposal through whitebox source code reviews. This role is particularly important given the prevalence of governance attacks, as seen with Tornado Cash. When no proposal requires a code review, Trail of Bits will focus on building content to help review further proposals, including tools (dedicated Slither detectors, fuzzing harness, proposal state diff visualizer, … ) and educational material (tutorial, checklist, code walkthrough, …)\n\nGauntlet: Will empower the Arbitrum DAO with an understanding of the optimal path for growth through our quantitative work. Decisions in ecosystems, specifically DeFi, benefit from design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights. Examples of some recent work include Aave Killswitch 1, Uniswap incentive design 1, ongoing Arbitrum USDC migration 1, and Cost of MEV: Quantifying Economic (un)Fairness in the Decentralized World 1.\n\nBlockworks Research: Will provide objective data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context, competitive environments, and make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. Additionally, Blockworks Research will function as the project manager handling logistics such as communication with the DAO and speaking with delegates. BWR is also able to input on mechanism design.\n\nThe Advocate is not a part of the coalition and exists purely to facilitate the DAO’s interests and direct the coalition. The Advocate is a representative of the DAO.\n\nWe believe it pertinent to get The Coalition stood up with haste and that Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits make up ideal initial members. That said, The Coalition is a malleable entity that can change, expand, and contract in domains and members as the DAO wishes. The Advocate as L2BEAT, likewise, should be looked at as a temporary seat that is always open to change. At the end of the 12 month period the domains and members should be reevaluated based on performance, lessons learned, and the adapting needs of the DAO as expected for the following 12 months.\n\nProjects\nThe Arbitrum Coalition aims to provide the following services as a first priority\n\nForum Proposal Review [BWR]\nWill provide impartial data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context and competitive environments such that they can make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. The Advocate will direct the frequency and research topics of this work.\nReview on chain proposal code updates [Trail of Bits]\nWhite box security review of source code through a combination of manual and automated review, which may include a review the proposal for design flaws and identifying security and correctness properties\nReviews do not include proposals that are initiated by Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum foundation. These proposals are already going through security reviews (including by Trail of Bits)\nJust-In-Time Quants [Gauntlet]\nGauntlet’s Applied Research 4 and Risk teams will deliver quantitative review, research, and modeling or simulation for DAO proposals and initiatives relating to economic risk, design, or optimization.\nArbitrum Ecosystem Risk Dashboard [Gauntlet]\nA public ecosystem risk dashboard, similar to Aave 3 and Compound 1, provides users, investors, and voters continuous visibility into market risk throughout the ecosystem. Market risk metrics will include Volatility, CEX/DEX liquidity, and Gauntlet Safety Ratings, to inform ongoing risk-return optimizations. Gauntlet will hold monthly Risk Training sessions on how to use the dashboard from deployment to adoption and beyond.\nService Provider Onboarding Framework [BWR]\nEstablish a framework that the DAO may choose to utilize as a tool for onboarding future service providers.\nThe framework will include potential requirements and criteria; solutions for checks and balances; onboarding and offboarding processes for additional service providers including but not limited to legal counsel, operations, engineering, and marketing. All potential service providers can be thoroughly vetted by BWR, if the DAO chooses, ensuring sufficient staffing and resource availability.\nFollowing the DAO signaling an appetite for such an activity, Blockworks Research can propose and host a service provider onboarding process. The initial proposal will attempt to allocate a budget of ARB that service providers can then apply to receive a portion of through an RFP. The DAO will then vote which service providers to onboard. Recruiting, criteria, the process, budgeting suggestions, and facilitation can be handled by The Coalition. Though BWR is happy to take the proposal through the process, the DAO may opt to use the framework in any capacity it wishes, including ones that exclude BWR from future involvement.\nProject Management [BWR]\nWill handle communication with DAO surrounding coalition activities. Additionally, it will be the point of contact for DAO stakeholders and service providers. Blockworks is responsible for the overall execution of the coalition, documenting its success, escalating issues, and recommending solutions. Blockworks will maintain its own governance process to ensure continuity.\nOnce the first priority services are met, the Arbitrum Coalition can provide the following. Though these are examples of activities that can be executed on, the DAO, through The Advocate, will have decision making power over the scope of the coalition’s work.\n\nTooling Creation and Enhancement [Trail of Bits]\n\nDevelop and enhance tooling to enhance the security of the Arbitrum ecosystem and its proposals, including:\nSpecific static analysis bug detectors targeting code update.\nDevelop fuzzing capabilities to test the validity of the new upgrade states and verify that the state changing will not break any invariant\nVisualize the state of the governance contracts, in particular: the state of previous proposals, current emitted and delegates votes, how the tokens are delegated,\nVisualize and verify correct encoding of values used in the governance contracts and the action contracts.\nEducational material [Trail of Bits]\n\nProvide educational material and guidelines for reviewing upgrades procedures, including: Tutorials, Checklists, Code walkthrough\nResearch New Mechanisms [BWR]\n\nObjectively analyze and contribute to the design of new and existing mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, data availability solutions, and more. All research will be data and evidence driven evidence, where available. Projects to be prioritized by The Advocate.\nDelegate Engagement [BWR]\n\nWill create processes that incentivize delegates to be more active contributors to proposals rather than passive reviewers. For instance, a delegate incentives framework with accompanying requirements. Additionally, host regular cadence calls with delegates and those that authored proposals to work together on iteration.\nGrowth Initiatives [BWR]\n\nWill produce content surrounding coalition activities. Blockworks Research’s podcast, 0xResearch, will feature a segment on a weekly basis throughout the coalition’s term that will discuss the latest updates in Arbitrum the protocol or governance. Additionally, Twitter threads and newsletter mentions will be regularly provided in order to attract more developers and users into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nCosts\nThe total cost of the coalition for the 1-year term will be based on the 30-day VWAP price of ARB on the day prior to the onchain proposal. One quarter of payment will be paid upfront to each Coalition Member, with a 274 day stream of the following ¾ starting 91 days from the AIP’s execution. The stream of funds will remain in DAO control and can be cut off at any time through an onchain DAO proposal. As of the ARB price on October 25th, this proposal is estimated to cos",

      "title": "The Arbitrum Coalition",
      "content": "Non-Constitutional\n\nAbstract\nTLDR: This proposal funds a coalition led by Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits in order to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 12 months.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition is an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aims to execute turnkey R&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate is to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition will provide the necessary resources so that the DAO can make informed decisions.\n\nMotivation\nThe Arbitrum forum includes many worthwhile suggestions, but often lacks the required research, coordination, design, and risk assessment to move forward optimally. For example, iterating on proposals, drumming up delegate awareness, and finding the necessary partners to execute an idea are often difficult tasks. The Arbitrum Coalition’s mandate is to help distill information and accelerate governance decision-making so DAO participants can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Coalition has best-in-class experience/specialized expertise and personnel to execute on this venture and are all already notable contributors to the DAO. Areas of expertise include but are not limited to research, framework creation, risk assessment, secure code reviews, threat modeling, and testing enhancements.The Coalition will take the necessary steps to ensure the Arbitrum DAO has the resources it needs to accomplish its goals.\n\nAs a case study demonstrating the need for the Coalition, there was a lot of discussion around returning tokens 3 accidentally sent to the airdrop address back to the recipients. However, there was no one to call on to look at the landscape of how other protocols deal with this issue, design and implement a mechanism, or take it through the governance process. Likewise, the DAO has seen multiple grant programs suggested but has not been able to assess what has worked or not worked for similar programs in the past from an objective perspective. A multitude of such cases can be seen over Arbitrum DAO’s short tenure. These are the exact roles the coalition will undertake for ideas that gain traction among DAO stakeholders.\n\nHad the coalition existed during the time of the STIP proposal, it would have played a pivotal role in alleviating many of the inefficiencies and challenges delegates faced in the process. Blockworks Research and Gauntlet would have been prepared to develop comprehensive resources in support of the program end-to-end. From simplifying the evaluation of proposals with concise explanations and quantitative analysis to simplifying the voting process for delegates, and ultimately eliminating the need for a second process aimed at finding a service provider to monitor and analyze the program once live, by doing it ourselves. While we did make modest contributions in this regard 4 [2 1], our commitment would have been backed by substantially greater resources. In addition, the Coalition would (and will, should this proposal pass) do its own analysis of how this STIP program performed (after the fact) and provide feedback and recommendations on how to improve it in the future. The Coalition would have advocated for streamlined voting methods in place of 105 separate votes and created efficient voting dashboards, reducing the reliance on last-minute community-funded solutions. While it’s a missed opportunity, it highlights the potential for future value.\n\nAdditionally, complex mechanism designs like creating a permissionless validator set (BOLD) and sequencer design (timeboost) can be made more easily understandable for ARB delegates with support from the Coalition and researched impartially versus other potential solutions when proposals of this nature inevitably go on the forum.\n\nThe Coalition will help community stakeholders make the best possible decisions when it comes to AIPs. For example, Trail of Bits will aim to review each onchain proposal’s source code to ensure it achieves what is stated. This code review ability is a feat many delegates cannot achieve on their own and will be extremely useful to enable competent voting. Blockworks Research will distill the competitive landscape and underlying technology and Gauntlet will be able assess potential risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nAn example that demonstrates the value the Coalition will provide relates to support decision-making for the Arbitrum Plutus DAO proposal to Activate ARB Staking 8. Adding an inflation rate to the token poses concerns around risks to the token, new independently created staking contracts would need to be audited, and it would be helpful if delegates had access to quantitative research surrounding how inflation has impacted other tokens in the past. The Coalition can work together to provide objective analysis, quantitative research, and, if desired by the community, audits and execution for this proposal and others like it.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition will help the DAO reduce friction and operate effectively. Having three of the most experienced service providers in crypto best positioned and resourced to act at the behest of the DAO will be a tremendous value add.\n\nRationale\nOne key difference between Arbitrum and many other protocols is the immense power given to the DAO at token generation, which makes the DAO fully responsible for the coordination and growth of the protocol.\n\nArbitrum’s impressive decentralization demonstrates that the DAO can’t rely on single entities such as Offchain Labs or the Arbitrum Foundation. Any steps taken to help create a robust decentralized ecosystem of service providers so that the DAO is not dependent on any single entity is a step in the right direction. This way if any one organization falls, is negatively regulated, or otherwise encumbered, the protocol continues to march forward. The Arbitrum Coalition is the first initiative toward this overarching goal.\n\nAdditionally, the Coalition will aid in bringing more service providers subservient to the DAO. For example, it can be a steward in creating a methodology for other budgeted entities to come into existence.\n\nOther DAOs have a diverse ecosystem of service providers who help the DAO operate efficiently. The Coalition will be the first entity working towards this overarching structure such that over time the DAO will have an ecosystem of service providers executing on key roles like grants, development, growth, risk, legal, and more. This is a necessity in maintaining a truly decentralized and efficiently operating DAO.\n\nTwo additional benefits to funding the coalition will be the professionalization of DAO undertakings and growth for Arbitrum. All representatives of the coalition are professional and will bring competent and effective work and communication into the DAO that should help proposals move along with less friction. Additionally, the entities involved have a combined audience of far over 500,000 and will be sure to produce public content on the work we do for the DAO to hopefully drive more users and developers into the ecosystem.\n\nThe Coalition’s purpose is not to replace delegates, but rather to support, serve, and empower both them and the community as a whole with tools and deep insights to streamline effective decision making.\n\nIntroduction to The Coalition\nTrail of Bits: Since 2012, Trail of Bits has helped secure some of the world’s most targeted organizations and devices. They combine high-end security research with a real-world attacker mentality to reduce risk and fortify code. They have worked extensively with Offchain Labs and performed over 1,800 hours of security review of Arbitrum through four focused engagements, including Nitro and Arbitrum V2. Many firms in DeFi, including Optimism, Balancer, Uniswap, and Compound 1 trust Trail of Bits expertise to help secure their code, and you can find many more in their Publications repository. They’ve succeeded in finding vulnerabilities in highly verified systems 1 and providing the best solutions regardless of whether they invented them. They are relentless about raising the baseline in the communities they work, and have developed and made freely available some of the most-used security tools, reference guides, and security 1 research in the industry.\n\nGauntlet: Gauntlet 3’s quantitative optimization solutions drive rapid and sustainable growth for DeFi’s top protocols, DAOs, and ecosystems through research 2, reports 2, products 2, and bespoke engagements 4. Gauntlet has the longest track record in DeFi risk management, with a managed peak at $40+B for DeFi protocols such as Aave and Compound.\n\nBlockworks Research: Blockworks Research 1 is a team of analysts that delivers institutional-grade data-driven research and analysis for L1s, L2s, DeFi, and gaming/consumer applications. Our team is well-known in the industry for producing high-quality, actionable research reports and data dashboards covering various topics, including L2s, dApps, tokenomics, technical upgrades, emerging trends, governance, MEV, and market analysis. The team is divided into protocol-specific coverage so that our analysts are experts in their respective niches. Blockworks Research is a branch of Blockworks 1, a media company hosting conferences, podcasts, and an editorial site.\n\nKey Terms\nThe Arbitrum Coalition (“the Coalition”): A group initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits whose mandate is to empower delegates with resources for making the most informed decisions possible.\n\nDAO Advocate: A single designated entity that maintains the ability to direct the coalition’s efforts. Functions as a referee between the DAO and the coalition. We suggest L2BEAT fulfill the role of the Advocate as a proven good actor for the Arbitrum DAO given their contributions and status in the DAO. The advocate will receive a stipend of $8,000 per month for their work. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring the DAO’s best interests are met by the Coalition.\n\nCoalition Member Termination: Ultimately, and above all, this Coalition will exist to serve the Arbitrum DAO. As such, individual members of the Coalition can be considered for replacement if their service does not meet the standards of this proposal or the DAO’s expectation. In the scenario a Coalition Member is considered for replacement, the DAO will need to examine the list of alternative vendors as well as any new market entrants eligible for consideration and pass a vote through\na Snapshot vote (reaching quorum) to stop the following payments to the vendor and replace said entity with a counterpart. The Coalition member will be considered terminated upon the vote passing. The same process may be executed in order to terminate and stop the stream of funds for the entirety of the Coalition and/or the DAO Advocate.\n\nCoalition Member Exit: As a malleable entity, if a member of the Arbitrum Coalition wishes to exit for any reason, they may do so by providing a two week lead time of departure and offer a list of viable replacements. Payments to the Member will stop 14 days after notice is given.\n\nSpecifications\nThe advocate will have the ability to call on the coalition for R&D efforts at their discretion and act as the DAO’s representative to ensure that the Coalition is working on the most value-added initiatives and providing beyond satisfactory value. The advocate will solely act on the DAO’s behalf and function as a facilitator. From analysis, to modeling, to payload the Coalition will tackle and streamline workstreams together.\n\nThe roles of the Coalition include but are not limited to:\n\nTrail of Bits: Reviewing onchain upgrade proposals to ensure that they align with the design and specification of the proposal through whitebox source code reviews. This role is particularly important given the prevalence of governance attacks, as seen with Tornado Cash. When no proposal requires a code review, Trail of Bits will focus on building content to help review further proposals, including tools (dedicated Slither detectors, fuzzing harness, proposal state diff visualizer, … ) and educational material (tutorial, checklist, code walkthrough, …)\n\nGauntlet: Will empower the Arbitrum DAO with an understanding of the optimal path for growth through our quantitative work. Decisions in ecosystems, specifically DeFi, benefit from design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights. Examples of some recent work include Aave Killswitch 1, Uniswap incentive design 1, ongoing Arbitrum USDC migration 1, and Cost of MEV: Quantifying Economic (un)Fairness in the Decentralized World 1.\n\nBlockworks Research: Will provide objective data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context, competitive environments, and make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. Additionally, Blockworks Research will function as the project manager handling logistics such as communication with the DAO and speaking with delegates. BWR is also able to input on mechanism design.\n\nThe Advocate is not a part of the coalition and exists purely to facilitate the DAO’s interests and direct the coalition. The Advocate is a representative of the DAO.\n\nWe believe it pertinent to get The Coalition stood up with haste and that Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits make up ideal initial members. That said, The Coalition is a malleable entity that can change, expand, and contract in domains and members as the DAO wishes. The Advocate as L2BEAT, likewise, should be looked at as a temporary seat that is always open to change. At the end of the 12 month period the domains and members should be reevaluated based on performance, lessons learned, and the adapting needs of the DAO as expected for the following 12 months.\n\nProjects\nThe Arbitrum Coalition aims to provide the following services as a first priority\n\nForum Proposal Review [BWR]\nWill provide impartial data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context and competitive environments such that they can make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. The Advocate will direct the frequency and research topics of this work.\nReview on chain proposal code updates [Trail of Bits]\nWhite box security review of source code through a combination of manual and automated review, which may include a review the proposal for design flaws and identifying security and correctness properties\nReviews do not include proposals that are initiated by Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum foundation. These proposals are already going through security reviews (including by Trail of Bits)\nJust-In-Time Quants [Gauntlet]\nGauntlet’s Applied Research 4 and Risk teams will deliver quantitative review, research, and modeling or simulation for DAO proposals and initiatives relating to economic risk, design, or optimization.\nArbitrum Ecosystem Risk Dashboard [Gauntlet]\nA public ecosystem risk dashboard, similar to Aave 3 and Compound 1, provides users, investors, and voters continuous visibility into market risk throughout the ecosystem. Market risk metrics will include Volatility, CEX/DEX liquidity, and Gauntlet Safety Ratings, to inform ongoing risk-return optimizations. Gauntlet will hold monthly Risk Training sessions on how to use the dashboard from deployment to adoption and beyond.\nService Provider Onboarding Framework [BWR]\nEstablish a framework that the DAO may choose to utilize as a tool for onboarding future service providers.\nThe framework will include potential requirements and criteria; solutions for checks and balances; onboarding and offboarding processes for additional service providers including but not limited to legal counsel, operations, engineering, and marketing. All potential service providers can be thoroughly vetted by BWR, if the DAO chooses, ensuring sufficient staffing and resource availability.\nFollowing the DAO signaling an appetite for such an activity, Blockworks Research can propose and host a service provider onboarding process. The initial proposal will attempt to allocate a budget of ARB that service providers can then apply to receive a portion of through an RFP. The DAO will then vote which service providers to onboard. Recruiting, criteria, the process, budgeting suggestions, and facilitation can be handled by The Coalition. Though BWR is happy to take the proposal through the process, the DAO may opt to use the framework in any capacity it wishes, including ones that exclude BWR from future involvement.\nProject Management [BWR]\nWill handle communication with DAO surrounding coalition activities. Additionally, it will be the point of contact for DAO stakeholders and service providers. Blockworks is responsible for the overall execution of the coalition, documenting its success, escalating issues, and recommending solutions. Blockworks will maintain its own governance process to ensure continuity.\nOnce the first priority services are met, the Arbitrum Coalition can provide the following. Though these are examples of activities that can be executed on, the DAO, through The Advocate, will have decision making power over the scope of the coalition’s work.\n\nTooling Creation and Enhancement [Trail of Bits]\n\nDevelop and enhance tooling to enhance the security of the Arbitrum ecosystem and its proposals, including:\nSpecific static analysis bug detectors targeting code update.\nDevelop fuzzing capabilities to test the validity of the new upgrade states and verify that the state changing will not break any invariant\nVisualize the state of the governance contracts, in particular: the state of previous proposals, current emitted and delegates votes, how the tokens are delegated,\nVisualize and verify correct encoding of values used in the governance contracts and the action contracts.\nEducational material [Trail of Bits]\n\nProvide educational material and guidelines for reviewing upgrades procedures, including: Tutorials, Checklists, Code walkthrough\nResearch New Mechanisms [BWR]\n\nObjectively analyze and contribute to the design of new and existing mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, data availability solutions, and more. All research will be data and evidence driven evidence, where available. Projects to be prioritized by The Advocate.\nDelegate Engagement [BWR]\n\nWill create processes that incentivize delegates to be more active contributors to proposals rather than passive reviewers. For instance, a delegate incentives framework with accompanying requirements. Additionally, host regular cadence calls with delegates and those that authored proposals to work together on iteration.\nGrowth Initiatives [BWR]\n\nWill produce content surrounding coalition activities. Blockworks Research’s podcast, 0xResearch, will feature a segment on a weekly basis throughout the coalition’s term that will discuss the latest updates in Arbitrum the protocol or governance. Additionally, Twitter threads and newsletter mentions will be regularly provided in order to attract more developers and users into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nCosts\nThe total cost of the coalition for the 1-year term will be based on the 30-day VWAP price of ARB on the day prior to the onchain proposal. One quarter of payment will be paid upfront to each Coalition Member, with a 274 day stream of the following ¾ starting 91 days from the AIP’s execution. The stream of funds will remain in DAO control and can be cut off at any time through an onchain DAO proposal. As of the ARB price on October 25th, this proposal is estimated to cos",

      "content": "### Background\nMultiple security proposals are being introduced piecemeal; the Arbitrum DAO should not rush into anything but work together on an inclusive RFP framework.\n\n## Introduction\nThe security of smart contracts is of utmost importance in the Arbitrum ecosystem. To ensure the highest level of security, we propose implementing an RFP structure for smart contract security auditors. This proposal aims to establish a process for onboarding security service providers and then selecting them on a per-project basis in a transparent, fair, and efficient manner. The process will be open to all security engineers, researchers, and organizations.\n\n## Proposal\nThe Arbitrum DAO shall issue an RFP for security services. The RFP will outline the requirements for security professionals, including their experience, qualifications, and methodology. The RFP will also specify the scope of the security services needed, the timeline, and the compensation rates for various project categories. [RFP Details TBD]\n\n## Selection Process\nThe selection process will be based on the following criteria:\n\nExperience and Qualifications: Security researchers must have a proven track record of conducting smart contract security audits and/or tooling development. They must have experience with the Arbitrum ecosystem and be familiar with its unique features.\n\nMethodology: Security researchers must have a rigorous audit and tooling SDLC methodology. They must be able to identify vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for remediation.\n\nPrice: Auditors must provide a competitive price for their services. [Standarized Metrics for rates TBD]\n\nThe selection process will be overseen by a committee of experts appointed by the Arbitrum DAO. The committee will review the proposals submitted by auditors and select the most qualified candidate based on the abovementioned criteria.\n\n## A Call to Action\nImplementing an RFP structure for security services will ensure the Arbitrum ecosystem remains secure and resilient. By establishing a transparent and fair service provider onboarding and project selection process, we can attract the best professionals and ensure they are compensated fairly for their services. We urge the Arbitrum DAO to consider this proposal and participate in the conversation, as the current state of the proposals is unmanageable, rushed, and exclusive.\n\n### Voting\nFor: Yes, invite security orgs to collaborate with the DAO on a RFP.\nAgainst: No, each security org should create its own proposal.\n\nPlease join the discussion on the [Arbitrum Forums](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-consolidate-security-proposals-into-a-rfp-process/19328)",

In 2022 alone, DeFi experienced hacks resulting in losses of over $3.1B. In 2023, a staggering $2.3B has already been stolen, indicating a trajectory higher than the previous year.\n\nThis is a security problem, a best practices problem, and a branding problem - rightfully keeping away institutions and users from a world-changing technology. Not solving this makes any effort of making web3 mainstream, vain.\n \n![7dbb9b4b71e82d06bc9ed50d172fbd4f740875d5.png](ipfs://bafkreig3zhjhipa7wcbmrhahe3smkhj6ytridrczvc4gizwkkkliyordde)\n    \nEvery time there is a hack on an Arbitrum project, both the Arbitrum ecosystem and the entire industry, suffer.\n\nGetting this right increases adoption at scale. Value exchange technologies without developers capable of using them appropriately have a hard time succeeding. Value exchange technologies with developers and protocols lacking security best practices create an unsafe environment for everyone participating.\n\n– The future of crypto hinders on projects prioritizing smart contract security.\n\nCyfrin commits to leveraging our team of industry experts to strengthen, support, and secure Arbitrum’s ecosystem and its developers.\n\n## Rationale\nLeveraging our auditing, engineering, and educational skill sets, the Cyfrin team will keep projects built on Arbitrum and its users safe. Through this proposal, Cyfrin aims to contribute to the long-term success of the Arbitrum ecosystem through attracting incoming TVL for the Arbitrum ecosystem, gain user trust, and show traction to potential future investors.\n\nLaser-focused on Web3 security, Cyfrin is a market leader in smart contract audits. Cyfrin offers everything from private audits to competitive public and private audits, as well as a multi-phase auditing approach we’ve designed to ensure stronger security guarantees.\n\n![eef6f8ad9af263c4f7d23396654d6993e05d7dcd.png](ipfs://bafkreigtdj7fs7vq3fy2jdavaghommp3ha5vrtd4727gvrqhmwipf6uptm)\n\nAdditionally, you may find case studies for Oku Trade and SudoSwap to learn more about how Cyfrin works.\n\nSome testimonials from clients:\n\n“It was a pleasure to work with the Cyfrin team. Their approach to security and meticulous testing is exceptionally thorough. Additionally, their intimate knowledge of the Chainlink protocol made them particularly useful for our audit.” - Getty Hill, Oku Trade Founder\n\n“Working with Cyfrin feels like a true partnership — they are just plain good at what they do and above all are as motivated as anyone to move our industry’s security practices forward” - Beanstalk\n\n“Working with Cyfrin was a good experience, they kept in touch throughout the entire audit, and also followed up post-launch. Competitive with the best of the firms.\" - 0xmons from Sudorandom Labs\n\nThrough this proposal, we’re asking Arbitrum to fund a Security Enhancement Fund to audit projects built on its infrastructure. The fund will allocate funds to private, competitive, or multi-phase audits for projects built on Arbitrum.\n\nCyfrin will power the long-term success of Arbitrum protocols, so protocols feel safer going to market and users more comfortable interacting with the Arbitrum chain.\n\n## Key Terms\nAudit: An audit is a service where a security researcher reviews a codebase in depth with the intent of finding potential vectors for exploitation. Once completed, a report is presented to the protocol to fix any potential vulnerabilities found.\n\nPrivate audit: A team, consisting of usually 2-3 security researchers, spends weeks looking at a protocol’s codebase with the aim of finding the most critical exploit vectors in a codebase, as well as perform architecture analysis, fuzz testing, improvement pull reviews, etc.\n\nPublic Competitive Audit: An audit where hundreds, if not thousands, of security researchers review a codebase and compete for funds in a set reward pool based on the complexity of vulnerabilities found, its impact, and its uniqueness.\n\nPrivate Competitive Audit: An invite-only audit where a protocol invites top-performing auditors to review their code and compete in community driven audit competition.\n\nMulti-Phase Audit: a new, innovative model known as the Diverge-Converge Multi-Phase Model. Crafted to maximize the quality of audits, a critical aspect in the Web3 space, by strategically incentivizing auditors and ensuring that the protocol codebase goes through at least three comprehensive auditing phases, enhancing the protocol’s ultimate security.\n\n## Specifications\nThe entirety of the funds will be allocated towards funding security reviews for protocols, including the costs to run the audits, hire auditors, promote contests, bring judges, do customer support, and competition moderation.\n\nThe Fund will match up to 60% for the audit requested. The remaining amount will have to be paid by the project itself requesting for funding. This is mostly to weed out projects just looking for a free audit, ensuring we’re truly enabling long-lasting impact for the ecosystem.\n\nThe one exception to this rule is projects who are already deployed on Arbitrum and who can prove a high number of active users, total value locked, or who provide user retention and stickiness across the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole. Establishing the details of what “high” means in this case will be a task of the Allocation Committee once formed.\n\nThese audits may come in the form of competitive audits, through our CodeHawks platform, private audits through our security research team, or through our multi-phased approach combining the above.\n\n## Audit Types\nCompetitive Audits\nCodeHawks, one of the leading competitive auditing platforms in the market and home to some of the top security experts in the industry, enhances the security of protocols through community-driven smart contract security reviews.\n\nOn CodeHawks, hundreds of auditors study, test, stress, and review the same protocol’s codebase for a defined amount of time - finding bugs and potential exploit vectors. Auditors then submit the findings to the platform for judge review and monetizing based on the vulnerabilities uncovered.\n\nPrivate Audits\nPrivate audits, an option tailored to yet-to-be deployed, and already-live protocols. A hand-in-hand relationship between protocol’s engineering team and our security research squad is formalized to uncover vulnerabilities and support developers with state-of-the-art best practices guidance.\n\nThrough constant communication, the protocol’s engineering team is able to revise vulnerabilities as soon as they’re found - ensuring the team can start working on fixes immediately. Auditors also provide architecture analysis, fuzz testing, improvement pull reviews, specific knowledge like formal verification, code smells, testing feedback, etc.\n\nMulti-phase Audits\nDesigned for large and more complex protocols, the Multi-Phase audit approach has the stronger security guarantee of them all since it encourages the protocol to go through several audit phases before completing the final report.\n\nTo learn more about the Multi-Phase Audits, review here. \n\n![94de3d610083fec1fdc4d0cd35c1720832865f5b.png](ipfs://bafkreiauxpn2v4ymg4djs22mshbdtzucp73zr62byswrmto5dzr7fzqloq)\n\n## Allocation Committee\nThe Allocation Committee is the group responsible for determining which projects should receive audit funding. Cyfrin will lead the charge of setting this Committee up within 2 weeks of proposal approval.\n\nThe multisig account for the Allocation Committee will contain 5 people (3 from Arbitrum’s side, 2 from Cyfrin). Each team (Cyfrin and Arbitrum) will select who from their organizations will represent them in the Allocation Committee within 10 days of proposal approval.\n\nOnce composed, the committee will determine any additional eligibility criteria and share them with the community before opening up the application funnel. The application funnel should open within a maximum of one month post proposal approval.\n\nAdditionally, the Allocation Committee is responsible for defining the appropriate application process and reviewing applications on a recurrent basis. The process for reviewing these applications, as well as how often the Committee meets will be determined by the members based on the amount of applications received and their complexity.\n\nWe saw the community gather together under the STIP proposal and would like the same community participatory process to guide the direction of how the fund allocates the distribution. It’s a discovery process that we will run, partnering with Arbitrum to validate findings and iterate repeatedly.\n\n## Eligibility criteria for protocols applying to the Security Enhancement Fund\nThe Security Enhancement Fund aims at improving the security of all projects that have already deployed or will be deploying into the Arbitrum chain.\n\nAny protocol that adds value to the Arbitrum ecosystem across DeFi, Gaming, DAOs, or social projects, real world assets tokenization, track and trace solutions, or any other track, bringing a healthy and sustainable contribution to the ecosystem, is welcomed to apply.\n\nProjects should have already deployed to Arbitrum mainnet to apply, although exceptions can be made for:\n\nProtocols who commit to deploying on Arbitrum within 6 months of the audit - if this is the case, the code being audited must be deployed exclusively on Arbitrum for 6 months before launching elsewhere. The Allocation Committee will determine when taking such a risk is worth the assessment.\n\nProtocols who already have deployed and gained traction on other chains, looking to deploy to Arbitrum as well - if this is the case, information regarding the protocol’s TVL, active user base, and Arbitrum strategy should be shared in the application for review by the Allocation Committee.\n\n## Ineligible Projects\nIn an effort to keep the Arbitrum ecosystem secure and sustainable, we comply and leverage Arbitrum’s guidelines 2 to determine which projects are ineligible to apply for the Security Enhancement Fund.\n\nAdditionally, the Allocation Committee may establish additional guidelines for ineligible projects.\n\n## Security Enhancement Fund Distribution\nThe 100% of the funds from the Security Enhancement Fund will be used to audit Arbitrum projects.\n\nThe fund allocation per project will cover 60% of the protocol audit, expecting the protocol to cover the rest. The reasoning behind this is to ensure only protocols serious about their long-term growth get audited. However, an exception of sponsoring 80% of the audit could be made for unique situations as established by the Allocation Committee, like for a protocol amounting for large ecosystem growth or a large protocol deploying to Arbitrum.\n\nThis makes it extremely convenient for protocols built on Arbitrum to enhance the security of their codebase and protect users’ assets.\n\nAudit prices are aligned with industry standards and calculated based on the complexity of the codebase under review.\n\nFor competitive audits, the prize pool is calculated as approximately $30 multiplied by the number of lines of code in the code base.\n\nFor private audits, the cost is calculated as $60,000 multiplied by the number of weeks required by the auditors to read, understand, and review the code base in scope. The time required for each audit is evaluated before the security review by the lead auditor assigned to the project and will be made publicly available to the community.\n\nProtocols are permitted to undergo one or multiple smart contract security reviews per protocol update. The number of reviews is determined based on the codebase size, as indicated below:\n\nFor codebases or protocol updates with less than 5000 nSloc, security reviews will be limited to 1 per type.\n\nFor codebases or protocol updates with more than 5000 nSloc, security reviews will be limited to 2 per type.\n\nnSloc is an objective measure and industry that stands for Normalized Source Code. Calculated reducing all multiline functions declarations to a single line, removing all comments and empty lines and counting the remaining number of lines of code.\n\nWhatever allocation we don’t spend, at the end of the year we will return to the DAO for further use.\n\n## Steps to implement\nWithin the next year, the Cyfrin team commits to:\n\n1. Technical implementation of creating the Allocation Committee’s multisig and define its members\n2. Allocation Committee details eligibility requirements and allocation criteria\n3. Define and implement process for protocols to apply for audits alongside the Allocation Committee\n4. Review applications and start distributing funds strategically for protocols who meet the criteria\n5. Pair auditors with protocols\n6. Kick-off auditing process\n7. Amplify the Security Enhancement Fund as a great reason for projects to choose Arbitrum as their L2 of choice, as well as promotion of the protocols Cyfrin audits\n8. Final report to protocols\n\n– Keep in mind, this process may vary depending on whether the protocol is undergoing a private, competitive or multi-phase audit.\n\n## Team\nPatrick Collins: Cyfrin’s CEO and former Lead of Chainlink DevRel, Patrick revolutionized the industry onboarding hundreds of thousands of developers into web3 with its courses and speeches, with more than 3 million views on his courses and ~160.000 subscribers across platforms.\n\nAlex Roan: Cyfrin’s CTO, Alex is a veteran Web3 developer who has contributed to core DeFi infrastructure such as Chainlink and Compound - securing billions of dollars in value.\n\nHans Friese: Cyfrin Lead Auditor and Co-founder, Hans is one of the world’s top auditors, consistently ranking at the top within competitive auditor leaderboards 2. He is also the founder and Lead Engineer of Solodit, the most used vulnerability aggregator tool for auditors.\n\nDon Dodge: tech veteran with a past in Google, Microsoft, Groove, Napster, AltaVista, and more. Startup investor, advisor, and board member.\n\nMark Scrine: previously the Strategic Lead for Proof of Reserve at Chainlink Labs and led a number of their biggest integrations. These included protocols such as TUSD, Matrix Port, Avalanche Bridge, BackedFi, and Swell Network.\n\nDeveloper Relations & Marketing: Our industry leading DevRel team will work together with the Arbitrum’s community to promote, educate, and onboard auditors into the Cyfrin ecosystem, advocating for audit quality for protocols. Additionally, through Cyfrin’s Education platform, our DevRel team is brewing the next generation of software engineers into the space with Arbitrum as their L2 of choice. Composed of 6 people total, here’s an example of some of the leaders in our team:\n\nVitto Rivabella, formerly leading Developers Experience at Alchemy, the popular Web3 infrastructure provider, and Alchemy University, educating tens of thousands of Web3 developers. Web3 educator, investor, developer, public speaker and a former VFX supervisor.\n\nJuliette Chevalier, former Lead of Developer Relations at Aragon and Co-founder of Surge Women, an organization bridging the educational gap between women and crypto products. She is also a key contributor to various DAOs, angel investor, software engineer, and public speaker.\n\nCommunity Manager: Our Community Manager will foster peer-to-peer relationships and manage technical support for the students going through the Arbitrum courses - a vital resource for community members seeking assistance and supporting CodeHawks auditors to do their best work.\n\nDesign: Our design team will create visually engaging and user-friendly materials, enhancing the overall learning experience for the Abitrum developer community and CodeHawks auditors.\n\nCodeHawks Team: The CodeHawks team together with Cyfrin will run, promote, judge, support and moderate the competitions and the community, onboarding and assisting the protocols looking to onboard on Arbitrum. Once the team has made sure the protocol respects the eligibility criteria, they will manage the entire cycle from start to finish. This includes sales (answering to active inbounds, and protocols suggested by the community), contest details, marketing, judging, and final report submission.\n\nAudit Team: Our team of security researchers are experts across a variety of fields like DeFi, oracles, Web3 social, and more. They come from the industry’s top auditor leaderboard and are dedicated entirely to the private audits.\n\n## Cost\nThe budget for this proposition totals $2 million.\n\nThe entirety of the funds is dedicated towards the sponsoring of audits for protocols deployed or deploying on Arbitrum.\n\nThe entirety of the funds will be expected upon proposal approval to maintain a rapid response to audit requests and safeguard protocol integrity.\n\nUpon the onchain approval of the proposal, these funds will be transferred to the Allocation Committee’s multi-sig, as set up by Cyfrin containing the 2 Cyfrin Committee representatives. The multi-sig’s first transaction will then add the 3 Arbitrum representatives before transferring any funds to protocols.\n\nAdditionally, Cyfrin suggests the Allocation Committee reimburses the DAO quarterly in the event that the minimum expected capital for that quarter ($500,000) isn’t spent within that time period. This will also enable a tangible oversight mechanism for the DAO to ensure Cyfrin is doing the expected work.\n\n## Why $2M?\n\nAt an average cost of $60,000, sponsored at 60%, $2M would cover anywhere from 20-25 audits in the span of a year.\n\nAlthough the cost of an audit varies widely based on codebase size, complexity, and audit type, audit prices typically range between $30,000-$100,000, with an average audit being ~$60,000.\n\nAssuming the Fund covers 60% of the audit, $2M are estimated to cover anywhere from 20-25 audits within the span of a year. Additionally, 70% of the fund will be used to cover existing protocols on Abitrum, with the remaining 30% used to cover new protocols launching on the chain.\n\n– Important to note that in order to have the best possible security for a protocol, projects often go through 2 or more audits - including private and competitive audits. Particularly for complex projects already holding a high TVL, a multi-phase audit is highly advised to decrease the chances of an exploit to an absolute minimum.\n\nConsidering Arbitrum is believed to have 1.2M total commits and over 1,100 Arbitrum repositories, with over 450 active developers, this fund would cover ~10% of Arbitrum’s development.\n\n https://www.developerreport.com/ecosystems/arbitrum\n\n## Framework on payments, reporting, and oversight\n\nCyfrin pledges to publish financial reports to the DAO to uphold transparency and accountability every quarter, outlining expenditure details, audits funded, decisions made, and progress updates. These reports will be posted in the Arbitrum DAO’s forum for the DAO to periodically review.\n\nSnapshot has a maximum character limit.

      "title": "Proposal: Activate ARB Staking",
      "content": "**Changes Based on Feedback Since the Temperature Check Version (posted 20th Oct)**\n\n- For simplicity and security reasons, decided to forego the token mint aspect of the proposal entirely and fund staking with a treasury request instead. Using the mint to fund staking was deemed too circular and not a necessary step based on feedback.\n- Added the idea of the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ as a potential key partner to gather data and monitor the impacts of this staking mechanism over the next 12 months with the end goal of using these insights to refine the ARB staking mechanism further. This collaboration is reliant on the Arbitrum Coalition’s conditional funding.\n- Added an additional 1.25% voting option\n- Clarified that voting will be ranked choice voting with five different options\n\n**Changes Based on Feedback Since the RFC Version**\n\n- Added several options for voting - 1.75%, 1.5%, and 1%. Examples of APRs at different ARB staking percentages can be found later in the proposal.\n- The maximum lock penalty % has been changed from 80% to 60%.\n- Suggested that the implementation details (selecting a vendor and auditor) will be decided in a further proposal\n\n# Abstract\nThe Arbitrum DAO treasury is growing rapidly, yet that growth is not currently being shared with token holders. The Arbitrum DAO treasury address holds 3,54B ARB tokens, and an unexpected $69,4M of unclaimed individual ARB airdrops were recently returned to the DAO treasury. The treasury is exceptionally well funded, and it’s important to note that the DAO fully controls the usage of the Arbitrum DAO treasury and that all surplus revenues belong to the DAO. This includes sequencer revenues.\n\nWe believe that the Arbitrum token needs a staking mechanism. We propose creating a mechanism that distributes ARB to token lockers. A locking mechanism would incentivize long-term token holders and become a fundamental building block for future token utility proposals (e.g., distributing sequencer revenues).\n\nAlong with creating a locking mechanism, we propose requesting 1.75%, 1.5%, 1.25% or 1% of the total ARB token supply from the Arbitrum DAO treasury and distributing this over 12 months through the proposed locking mechanism. The final amount would be decided with a Snapshot and that decision cemented on-chain with a Tally vote. We suggest that the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ gathers data and monitors the impacts of this staking mechanism over the 12-month period and potentially audits the contracts if funded in time. Of course, this relationship is reliant on both proposals passing and the DAO and Coalition Advocate supporting the scope of work for the coalition. The goal is to use these insights to give the DAO the data and tools to refine the ARB staking mechanism further.\n\nIt is important to note that this proposal is entirely separate from the ongoing liquidity incentives framework and grant discussion. Both can and should co-exist - Arbitrum should have a functional grants framework and a staking mechanism. The Arbitrum DAO STIP program has recently concluded, and 50M ARB tokens will enter the market over the coming months. As proposed here, a supply sink through staking would benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole.\n\nIn the discussions over the previous months, we’ve seen the legal aspect be a deterrent to sharing value with ARB token holders in the form of revenue. The way we are proposing the staking mechanism through using existing treasury funds to reward lockers in ARB is the most palatable option from a legal perspective, as it does not involve sharing revenues. It also does not rule out the possibility of later moving on to a model that allows for other value accrual methods to the token. Should our proposal pass, when additional value accrual methods are proposed and the legal landscape is more mature and better understood, the process will likely be much quicker since a staking mechanism is already in use with audited contracts in place.\n\nWe thank the following delegates and others for their valuable feedback while drafting this proposal.\n\nWestie from Blockworks Research\nCoinflipcanada\nAnd several others\n\n# Motivation\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem would benefit in multiple ways from a staking mechanism that is constructed to heavily align incentives with those most aligned with the ecosystem long-term. While staking mechanisms are familiar and a mainstay across DeFi, sustainable models and their impact on the token in question have been scarcely studied. These staking mechanisms are often poorly designed and have rampant inflation that negatively affects the token.\n\nRegarding staking mechanisms, there are few examples to model after in the Layer 2 token space. We propose that the Arbitrum ecosystem takes the first step in this endeavor and leads the way - as it already does in many other verticals. We believe that to construct a long-term staking mechanism that is sustainable, there is first a need to gather actual data that is strictly specific to the Arbitrum ecosystem and the ARB token.\n\nBecause of this, we propose that the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ monitors the effects of this 12-month staking experiment and provides quarterly updates on the impacts of the mechanism through dashboards and qualitative reporting. After the 12-month staking experiment is over, we suggest that the DAO funds the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ to produce a comprehensive report with results and recommendations on what they believe is the most sustainable way forward in building a staking mechanism and incentive model that is sustainable yet attractive for the ARB token. The expertise of the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ is perfectly suited for analyzing the results of this experiment, given that Gauntlet is an industry-leading authority in tokenomics design, Blockworks spearheads the industry’s research efforts and Trail of Bits is a top-tier security organization. To read more about the Arbitrum Coalition, please visit their proposal here.\n\n# Broader Implications for Arbitrum\nThis proposal passing would have extremely positive implications for the entire Arbitrum ecosystem. Having a native staking model that the DAO officially approves would be likely to have the following consequences:\n\n- Significantly increase interest in Arbitrum and the ARB token\n- Allow for composability around an ARB token that can earn yield\n- Reward long-term aligned stakers with yield while penalizing mercenary capital and short-term actors\n- Positively differentiate ARB from any other L2 tokens and bring the spotlight back to Arbitrum\n- Offer a first step and infrastructure towards introducing different forms of revenue sharing in the future\n\nThese are some of the benefits that will likely result from having a staking mechanism; however, verifying these predictions’ accuracy by an independent third party such as the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ is important. These hypotheses cannot be truly verified without actual data, highlighting the importance of a 12-month trial period for staking.\n\n# Benefits for Users\nBy introducing a staking contract that responsibly distributes the allotted amount of tokens to users who are willing to lock their ARB, the incentives are aligned in a way that rewards those parties most loyal to the Arbitrum ecosystem. This includes long-term holders of ARB and DAOs that have received an airdrop and are willing to lock their tokens.\n\nThe figures below detail possible APRs for stakers at different staked percentages if 1.75%, 1.5%, 1.25% or 1% of the total supply was distributed annually. The current circulating supply of ARB is approximately 1.275B.\n\n![87f8dc9e506d60ebd15f3098d0ff626ee8453c71.png](ipfs://bafkreifv3akc3qub3mmknewbcjwchy2vc7astm2wp33occluoj4r576lu4)\n\n# Specification\n- The ARB staking contract will allow users to lock their ARB for up to 365 calendar days. A user’s weight is proportional to their lock time.\n- Users may increase their lock times.\n- Users may pause their lock times (meaning the time to unlock does not increase this saves having to relock continuously)\n- Users may have many independent locks.\n- Users will receive and may claim ARB emissions according to their weight.\n- Users may exit their lock for a penalty between 0-60% of their lock amount, linear vs. lock time remaining (365 days remaining would mean a 60% penalty, and 0 days would be a 0% penalty). This penalty is shared between remaining users according to weight.\n\nExample usage: ARB locker\n\n- The user locks 100 ARB for 365 days.\n   - The lock weight formula is (ARB amount locked * lock time / 365)\n   - Their ARB lock ‘weight’ is currently 100 (100 ARB * 365/365).\n   - All rewards are distributed based on a user’s weight / the total sum of all the users’ weights.\n- After 182.5 days, the user will have a lock ‘weight’ of 50 (100 ARB * 182.5/365).\n   - At this point, they may increase their lock time, do nothing, or withdraw.\n   - The early exit penalty is (0.6 * lock time / 365)%.\n   - For a lock time of 182.5 days, the penalty is, therefore, 30% of the locked amount - if the user were to withdraw now, they would receive back 70 ARB.\n- ARB staked in this contract will still have voting rights and can be delegated - voting power will not be diminished by a shorter lock length\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n1. Why a locking mechanism?\n\nA locking mechanism allows users who are long-term believers in Arbitrum to signal this belief through their actions and get rewarded for it accordingly. Locking for longer is always optional - users may lock for any time period. One year is a reasonable lock time compared to the previously popular 4-year locking model. A one-year lock is not too long to the point of disincentiving locking, as users can choose the lock duration. Not only does this give individuals optionality and a mechanism to earn a native yield on their ARB tokens, but it also gives protocols that were a part of the DAO airdrop or have otherwise accumulated ARB a mechanism to earn on their treasury.\n\n2. What are the consequences of this proposal?\n\nUltimately, this proposal introduces utility to ARB and gives users more incentive to hold. In addition, long-term believers will be net increasing their network share, which sets up a base from which we can build further proposals for ARB value accrual without worrying about the distribution mechanism.\n\n3. What would this staking mechanism mean for delegation?\n\nFrom a user standpoint, it’s important to note that the ARB staked in the proposed contract will still have voting rights and can be delegated - voting power will not be diminished by a shorter lock length. The staking contract will be upgradeable and controlled by the DAO - this ensures that the DAO can pause this distribution at any time.\n\n# Summary\nAs it stands today, ARB has no native utility or yield. We propose approving the creation of the staking contract detailed above and distributing an equivalent of 1.75%, 1.5%, 1.25%, or 1% of the total ARB supply from the DAO treasury to the staking contract. These tokens would be distributed over a 12-month period, during which the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ could - pending their proposal passing - monitor the impacts of the proposed staking mechanism and draft a report and recommendations by the end of the period. Note that the Arbitrum Coalition proposal is entirely separate yet synergistic to this proposal. The passing of either proposal is not conditional on the other proposal’s performance.\n\nIt’s important to highlight that to move toward a final and refined version of value accrual to the ARB token, trial and experimentation is required. We believe there is a strong need for actual data from a live staking mechanism, such as the one suggested in this proposal, from the unique context of Arbitrum’s growing ecosystem to make more informed decisions on what the ultimate mechanism for ARB staking and value accrual might look like.\n\nInnovation has always been Arbitrum’s forte in both technical advancements and building a vibrant community - we believe that the approach to building a cutting-edge staking model for ARB through trial and experimentation is a logical way forward.\n\n# Timeline\nThis proposal will follow the official lifecycle of an AIP detailed here. Please note that this proposal is a non-constitutional proposal.\n\nThe suggested timeline can be found below.\n\nWeek 36-37 - Forum post, request for comments and feedback (Complete)\nWeek 43-44 - Temperature check forum post & Snapshot poll (1 week)\nWeek 45 - Formal AIP and call-for-voting (3 days)\nWeek 45-46 - On-chain DAO vote on Tally (14 days)\nWeek 47 onwards - Implementation phase\n\nIf the proposal passes, a draft of the implementation phase is detailed below in “Suggested Steps to Implement.” The final implementation schedule depends on the result of the vendor decision proposal, community review, audit schedules, and subsequent findings. A concrete schedule for the implementation stage will thus be locked in at a later stage.\n\n# Voting Options on Snapshot\nWhen this proposal moves to Snapshot, there will be five voting options. The voting method will be ranked choice voting. To read more about ranked choice voting, please visit this article from Snapshot.\n\n1. Fund staking with 1.75% of the total ARB supply (175M ARB tokens)\n2. Fund staking with 1.5% of the total ARB supply (150M ARB tokens)\n3. Fund staking with 1.25% of the total ARB supply (125M ARB tokens)\n4. Fund staking with 1% of the total ARB supply (100M ARB tokens)\n5. Do not fund staking\n\n# Suggested Steps to Implement\n1. The Arbitrum DAO will receive another proposal concerning implementation, which will aim to decide the vendor of the implementation and associated contracts and an auditor.\n2. After the contracts and audits are finished, they will be provided to the community for review for two weeks.\n3. After the community review period, the contracts will be deployed to Arbitrum, and the ownership will be transferred to the DAO.\n4. Ratification of reimbursement of costs as illustrated in the Cost sections below and disbursement of such reimbursements to applicable service providers\n\n# Costs\nThe costs of this proposal are mainly related to the implementation process, during which a vendor and auditor will be decided. The true extent of these costs can only be estimated after these decisions are made.",

      "title": "Proposal: Build Optimal Onboarding for STIP Teams (BOOST)",
      "content": "Abstract\n\nThis Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP) seeks to enhance user acquisition and engagement efficiency in the Arbitrum ecosystem following the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP). The proposal aims to deploy 95 total quests across 62 unique applications. The goal is to provide a comprehensive onboarding, educational, and interaction model that results in sustained user commitment and thus solidifies Arbitrum’s position as a leading Layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution.\n\nMotivation\n\nWe propose an innovative solution to address an opportunity that has surfaced following the execution of the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP) – the need for effectively onboarding, educating, and retaining new users on the Arbitrum platforms that received STIP. The STIP successfully provides incentive to perform onchain actions, but it does not address the user onboarding experience aspect of attracting new users. This proposal is viewed as the missing puzzle piece to STIP. In addition, the STIP had teams qualify, but not receive funding, providing a situation we aim to reconcile by running additional quests for those teams that will improve user retention and increase usage of their protocols.\n\nRationale\n\nOur proposal aligns meticulously with Arbitrum’s mission to foster an inclusive, vibrant, and engaged community. By ensuring all users - existing and new ones - are carried along inclusively and effectively via well-designed quests, we will be creating an environment that promotes continued learning, interaction, and commitment. This “sticky factor” is critical for a sustainable and thriving ecosystem.\n\nKey Terms\n\nWhat are Quests?\nQuests are guided learning activities, organized around specific crypto protocols and apps. They are designed to familiarize users with different protocols, their processes, and the potential benefits they offer within ecosystems like DeFi on Arbitrum.\n\nWhy are Quests Helpful?\n\nQuests provide a hands-on learning experience which makes the understanding of complex protocols more enjoyable and interactive. They provide delightful step-by-step guidance which motivates users to explore and use these protocols, thereby increasing user adoption and contributing to the broader understanding of apps.\n\nFor instance, consider the quest on Layer3 called “Exploring Radiant”. It guides users through learning about onmichain money markets, swapping, and depositing on Radiant, breaking down each step into comprehensible segments.\n\nBy engaging with the quest, users not only learn how to use the Radiant platform, but also get practical experience which they can apply in real-world situations. Quests like these play a crucial role in demystifying DeFi protocols, making them more accessible, and bringing users to Arbitrum.\n\nIn the case of Exploring Radiant, it managed to attract 31,181 completions. This demonstrates the high engagement rate and efficiency of quests as interactive learning tools in the DeFi space. The large number of participants signifies that the quest was not only successful in providing valuable insights about the protocol but also in garnering interest from a wider community, thereby increasing the adoption rate of the whole Radiant platform.\n\nBut it isn’t just Radiant.\n\nThere is a whole library of Arbitrum quests available on Layer3. As part of the STIP Enhancement and Inclusion Quest Proposal, a whole new category will be created on Layer3 to display the quests included in the STIP Enhancement and Inclusion Quest Program\n\nWhy Layer3?\nLayer3 has played a significant role in the growth of Arbitrum.\n\nWe’ve guided over 337,613 users to complete more than 5.9 million on-chain transactions on Arbitrum, all at no cost to the user or Arbitrum DAO. Our initiatives, particularly interactive quests, have already greatly increased user engagement and education on Arbitrum.\n\nBy transforming onchain operations into bite-sized, step-by-step quests, we have managed to make Arbitrum accessible to a wider audience. We have made it accessible and comprehensible to users, regardless of their technical proficiency level.\n\nSpecifications:\nTeams:\nUpon approval, we will embark on the design and execution of 95 quests structured strategically for the following protocols and teams in direct support of the STIP.\n\nThis includes one quest for each STIP-qualified protocol (29 projects, one quest each) and two quests for each recipient that received a greater than 50% majority in favor of their STIP proposal and more than 71.51 million ARB in support for their proposal (33 projects, two quests each). Each quest is meticulously designed to enhance user comprehension, interaction, and loyalty to the respective protocols.\n\nThe list of protocols and teams includes but is not limited to:\n\n1\tCamelot, Jones, Dopex, GMX, LODESTAR, Socket, Timeswap, RADIANT, Pendle Finance, MUX, Frax, Tally, Rysk, Silo Finance, Stella, Good Entry, Gamma, Umami, Abracadabra, KyberSwap, OpenOcean, Angle, Trader Joe, Dolomite, Premia, Vertex, Perennial Finance, Balancer, WINR\n\n2\tWOOFi, Gains Netowrk, DefiEdge, Synapse Protocol, PancakeSwap, Notional Finance, Rodeo, Magpie, Stargate, Savvy, Tales of Elleria, Thales, TIDE, Solv Protocol, Furucombo, dForce, Sanko GameCorp, RAMSES, Vela Exchange, Thetanuts, JOJO Exchange, Wormhole, Shell Protocol, REALM, unshETH, StakeDAO, Curve, iZUMi, Beefy Finance, Arrakis Finance, Florence Finance, CVI, Prime Protocol\n\nPayment Terms:\nThe compensation for this proposal will encompass a real-time, continuous flow of 1 million ARB tokens, streamed via the Superfluid protocol. The stream will commence immediately post-approval and will run continuously up until May 19, 2024.\n\nShould we fall short of fulfilling our obligations at any point within the specified period, a new proposal can be initiated to stop the stream of funds.\n\nIn the spirit of transparency, we commit to providing regular progress updates and upon completion of each of the 3 phases and maintaining Dune Analytics impact dashboards for the duration of the initiative, both at the application and ecosystem level. In a scenario where we fail to deliver our commitments, the community possesses the full right to propose halting the stream until the matter is adequately addressed and resolved.\n\nSteps to Implement\n\nInitiate a cooperative process with all STIP-qualified protocols to design a unique quest for each, and create two additional quests for the teams that met the criteria but weren’t granted STIP.\n\nImplement the quests in month-long phases, during which we will monitor user engagement, quest completion rates, and user feedback, among other indicators.\n\nImpact Analysis with Dune Dashboards: Post-sprint, we will analyze and present our impact utilizing detailed Dune dashboards. These dashboards will visually represent key metrics to paint a clear picture of the project’s success. Metrics categories include user engagement, unique user rates, and protocol specific metrics.\n\nBy confronting these steps, we can continuously refine our approach, ensuring that we provide mutually beneficial outcomes for both users and protocols involved in the STIP program.\n\nPhase 1 - STIP Proposal Quests (November 2023 - January 2024): Quests specifically designed for all STIP-qualified protocols will be released in six groups, each running for a month. The intention is to boost user engagement with these protocols that have received official STIP funding and guide users on how to use STIP protocols.\n\nPhase 2 - Non-STIP Proposal Quests 1 (February 2024 - April 2024): The second phase focuses on those teams that met the STIP criteria but did not receive funding. This stage ensures that these projects also get beneficial visibility and user engagement through their initial quests.\n\nPhase 3 - Non-STIP Proposal Quests 2 (March 2024 - May 2024): The final phase continues the support for non-STIP funded projects, further providing engagement through a second quest for each team. This step is designed to maintain and enhance user interest and interaction, consolidating the engagement prompted in Phase 2.\n\nRunning two quests for non-STIP funded projects (Phase 2 and 3) is particularly beneficial as it contributes to user retention through a deeper experience with the protocol.\n\nThe first quest provides users with initial exposure to the protocol, its functions, and utility. It attracts & onboards new users and raises their curiosity, while also providing a sense of familiarity and comfort with the protocol.\nThe second quest aims to solidify this relationship. A user returns to reinforce their understanding and re-engage with the protocol – a follow-up to further strengthen the interaction between the user and protocol.\nThe aim is to attract users and provide a solid foundation for them to be engaged, active and aligned with the protocol over a longer period. This ultimately contributes to the longevity and sustainability of each protocol.\n\nThis phased approach allows us to target attention to each group of protocols, ensuring each has optimized quests and yields the best possible results for all involved.\n\nOverall Cost Estimate:\nThe total cost to implement this AIP is 1M ARB where:\n\nRecurring costs will entail updates and maintenance, community engagement efforts, partnerships, performance tracking, and reporting.\n\nThis proposal lends to Arbitrum’s goal to build an engaged and knowledgeable community committed to the platform’s longevity. By incorporating all users in a guided and rewarding learning journey, we act as a funnel for new Arbitrum users, rather than current participants dominating rewards. By also acknowledging and rewarding the efforts of teams that did not qualify for STIP, we foster a fairer and more inclusive community spirit, further underlining Arbitrum’s commitment to its members.\n\nThis dynamic, transparent, and comprehensive approach propels the strength and sustainability of the Arbitrum community.",

      "title": "Proposal: Empowering Early Contributors: The community Arbiter Proposal",
      "content": "# Abstract\nThis proposal recommends the allocation of 500,000 $ARB tokens, equivalent to 0.005% of the total supply, to acknowledge and reward the outstanding contributions of Arbitrum community members known as “Arbiters.” These contributors have played pivotal roles in Arbitrum’s development, from translation and publicity to community support and protection from fraudulent activity. By establishing a transparent and equitable reward system through the Arbitrum DAO, we aim to recognize past contributions and inspire continued dedication, fostering the growth of our ecosystem.\n\n# Motivation\nThe Arbitrum community thrives on collaboration, decentralization, and the Ethereum community spirit. This proposal aligns with these principles and strives to:\n\nRecognize the exceptional contributions made by Arbiters to Arbitrum’s development.\nDemonstrate the spirit of collaboration and decentralization within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring its long-term sustainability.\nEstablish a clear and equitable reward mechanism through the Arbitrum DAO, ensuring that Arbiters are treated fairly.\nInspire more individuals to actively participate in the advancement of the Arbitrum ecosystem by retroactively rewarding Arbiters.\n\n# Rationale\nThe Arbitrum community, driven by its contributors, has been instrumental in shaping Arbitrum over the past two years. These dedicated individuals have contributed significantly through a wide range of activities, including translation, promotion, event organization, community guidance, safety assurance, and collaboration with other communities. These efforts have been essential to the success and vibrancy of the Arbitrum community.\n\n# Partial contribution value\nSince 2021-2023, the work and contributions made by Arbiter are too numerous to list and quantify individually, and the data provided are statistically estimated due to the lack of prior targeted data counting and retention.\n\nProvided millions of help to Arbitrum community users and developers. It allows Arbitrum team members to focus more on the development of technology, and also allows millions of Arbitrum community members to get answers to all kinds of questions and needs feedback. (Anyone can view the help and contributions of the arbitrators on the arbitrum Discord server, wechat groups, and other language communities, etc.)\n\nArbiters are online 24/7 (in Odyssey and Guild activities related to many arbiters are 16 + hours online, for community members to provide the most immediate, high-quality help) arbiter two years, has been involved in the maintenance and management of the community order, to report and stop more than 100,000 times of the scam, to ensure that hundreds of thousands of members of the community are able to get help in a timely manner and to keep the server safe.\n\nEstablish Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean and other Arbitrum local communities, such as: Chinese more than 10 WeChat groups, WeChat public number, microblog, Coinhub, and other media (due to policy reasons, a number of Chinese media has canceled the account)\n\nThe establishment of language communities has further expanded Arbitrum’s influence, attracted more than 100,000 users and developers to choose to use Arbitrum, and promoted the prosperity of the ecosystem.\n\nTranslate and proofread more than 50 Arbitrum articles, arbiters in various language areas edit, typeset and publish Arbitrum daily information more than 2,000 times, publish more than 300 articles and blogs, explain more than 50 videos, and all kinds of accounts with a large number of real fans and readers, for hundreds of thousands of users around the world to provide a quick understanding of the use of Arbitrum and the information and guidelines.\n\narbiter has provided community optimization, management, operation, and promotion suggestions for arbitrum more than 300 times, making the system of Arbitrum publicity, service, promotion, and operation more perfect, and allowing Arbitrum users, developers, and ecosystem projects to get better service experience and help.\n\ndock 30 Arbitrum AMA, more than 20 events, more than 100 docking projects, affecting hundreds of thousands of community members, attracting more than 50 projects to choose an arbitrum network for deployment.\n\nSome Arbiters have their own communities, and as KOLs in Twitter and famous communities, they vigorously promote Arbitrum through their own influence, posting blogs and all kinds of information, and their continuous influence involves hundreds of thousands of crypto community users. This has brought great enthusiasm and new users to the Arbitrum community.\n\narbiters has been accompanying and witnessing the prosperous development of the Arbitrum community and ecosystem, continuously carrying forward the spirit of the Arbitrum community and promoting and marketing Arbitrum.\n\nFrom 6,400 wallet addresses at the initial mainnet launch to 1,270,000+ wallet addresses now, including the growth of on-chain TVLs and a thriving ecosystem. Helped and assisted Arbitrum Discord to grow from tens of thousands of members to now 460,000, providing millions of high quality help, all kinds of Arbitrum promotion and publicity with millions of views.\n\nThe following document is the basis for some of the contribute saved\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YjSCrAYJg2A1T5r8YpZx5BbfLQeyhBePqPtW5pA83dU/edit?usp=sharing]\n\n# Specifications\n\nBeneficiaries: Arbiters: Comprising the most dedicated contributors to the Arbitrum community over the past two years, recognized for their exceptional and humble service to the Arbitrum community.\n\nDistribution of Incentives: The Arbitrum community requests a total of 500,000 $ARB tokens, to be evenly distributed among 25 of its members, recognizing their past work for the Arbitrum community.\n\nCalculation: 20,000 $ARB tokens per member x 25 Discord Arbiters = 500,000 $ARB.\n\n# Wallet Address Collection and Distribution\nArbiters’ contributor wallet addresses will be collected through a specified process, ensuring accuracy and fairness. If the proposal is approved, the Arbitrum DAO will disburse rewards to each Arbiter contributor’s address, following thorough verification and confirmation.\n\n# Future Plans\nUpon the successful implementation of this proposal, we will continue to enhance Arbiter contribution methods, ensuring the sustained growth of the arbitrum community.\n\narbiters will continue to translate blogs, do publicity, organize AMAs, hold offline activities, provide community suggestions, optimize community services, maintain community order, provide high-quality help to the community, actively connect with various activities and projects, and help promote cooperation with other communities. On the basis of arbitrum, actively participate in the arbitrum Ambassador Program and explore more ways to contribute, and continue to provide value to the broader arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nOur goal is to continually contribute value to arbitrum and collaborate with the broader community to foster a vibrant and thriving arbitrum ecosystem.\nAs arbitrum continues to evolve, we will also be able to really demonstrate our knowledge of the protocol and help show more new users that arbitrum is the optimal scaling solution for Ethereum.\n\n# Milestones\nWhen the arbitrum discord server exceeds 700,000 members,or when TVL passes $3b,or when we have helped community members more than two million times, or when we have made significant progress in various types of outreach and publicity. We are committed to transparently communicating milestone updates and displaying data about what arbiters are doing or contributing.\n\nAfter this proposal, we will pay attention to the statistics and retention of examples of contributions made by arbiters, and data. This will facilitate more detailed examples and data presentation at the next milestone.\n\n# Conclusion\nThe implementation of a robust reward system via the Arbitrum DAO is crucial for recognizing and appreciating the invaluable contributions of Arbiters to the community. This initiative will reinvigorate community engagement, foster openness, and encourage sustained participation, ultimately ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Arbitrum community. Transparency, fairness, and continuous improvement based on community input will be at the forefront of this endeavor. With this proposal, we are confident in building a more collaborative, innovative, and dynamic Arbitrum community that embodies the values and spirit of our ecosystem.\n\nYour insights are valued and essential in shaping the future of our community. We welcome you to provide feedback and engage with us.",

      "title": "AIP 9: Arbitrum Short-term Incentive Program",
      "content": "Note: This proposal has been drafted on behalf of the Arbitrum Incentives Working Group as a result of multiple community calls and workshops between multiple stakeholders. It does not exclude external incentive proposals from outside of the proposed structure.*\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal outlines a one-time, community-created consensus framework to distribute up to 50,000,000 ARB of DAO-funded incentives targeting active Arbitrum protocols. Aimed at fulfilling short-term community needs, the program plans to allocate DAO-owned ARB towards incentives while ensuring transparent consensus and distribution methods. It spans two voting rounds and provides incentives to eligible programs designed to fund incentives through January 31, 2024. \n\nGranted funds are expected to be distributed by the end of January 31, 2024. Participating grantees will be expected to self report data, dashboards, and summarize grant performance on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis provisional framework aims to allow delegates to distribute incentives fairly and effectively using transparent criteria agreed upon by the community, while a thorough system is developed ([1](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/4-arbitrum-open-governance-call-26-07-2023/15559), [2](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-now-a-pragmatic-approach-for-the-moment/15779), [3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/quit-shooting-the-dao-foundation-in-the-foot/15771/2), [4](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-accelerating-arbitrum-leveraging-camelot-as-an-ecosystem-hub-to-support-native-builders/15116)).\n\nThe goals of the framework are to:\n\n* **Support Network Growth**: Accelerate the distribution of incentives to Arbitrum dApps to drive network and ecosystem growth.\n* **Experiment with Incentive Grants**: Experiment with grant distribution to uncover new incentive strategies that increase user engagement and increase volume, transactions, and liquidity in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n* Find new models for grants and developer support that generate maximum activity on the Arbitrum network.\n* Create Incentive Data: Generate data on the efficacy of distributed grants to inform future incentive programs and incentive design.\n\n## Rationale\n\nBy incentivizing the use of existing Arbitrum dApps through this proposal, we anticipate increased volume, transactions, users, and liquidity, laying the groundwork for a dynamic ecosystem. While the proposal acts as an experimental program, its primary goal is to ensure basic safeguards while promoting innovative incentive strategies.\n\nGiven that this proposal aims to be a one-time, short term incentive distribution, it lacks the accountability and operational rigor that a full program may provide. As such, we encourage protocols to consider that the use of funds will be both evaluated, and monitored by the community. Any misbehavior, or failure to comply with grant requests will likely result in ineligibility, or at the very least significant discernment, in future incentive or grant programs.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program will comprise up to a 50,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols. In order to expedite the distribution of this capital to the ecosystem, the DAO will adopt a bifurcated process comprising two separate processes: the Financial Proposal and Application Process.\n\nFollowing a successful [Snapshot Temperature Check](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x5e0057920df9a278918e4de4ee1e6de7e2415d2af985e40a6c7a1a4b47a4ce01), the DAO will launch an expedited application and review process, allowing applicants to apply to delegates for grants concurrent with the on-chain vote to distribute DAO funds from the treasury.\n\nThe Snapshot Temperature Check achieved consensus and approved funding of up to 50,000,000 ARB through the end of January 31, 2024.\n\n## Financial Proposal\n\nThe Financial Proposal will comprise the following:\n\n* A ratification of the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program and [application template](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-application-template/16544) as articulated in this document.\n* Approval of the eligibility criteria, grant budget parameters, distribution strategy, and evaluation requirements.\n* A 50,000,000 ARB distribution to the [STIP-ARB multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0x5a5c8Da41220EeF8E7f423f6e9028da5b9E70f8B).\n* A 94,000 ARB operational budget for community/project facilitation.\n  * 20,000 ARB to @tnorm as retroactive payment for conducting community moderation:\n    * Draft and review of multiple iterations of the STIP framework.\n    * Moderation of community calls and working group telegram.\n    * Coordination individually across dozens of stakeholders and community members over the past three weeks.\n   * 54,000 to ARB Multisig Signers (6,000 ARB per Signer).\n   * 20,000 ARB to StableLab streamed weekly for organizing and highlighting applications and managing review processes. This includes:\n        * Overseeing forum application and review stages.\n        * Monitoring progression of applications throughout the application and review process.\n        * Monitoring progression of applications throughout the application and review process.\n        * Collaboration with the Foundation for forum setup and oversight.\n       * Facilitation of Delegate x Grantee Community Calls during review periods.\n\n**Multisig Setup**\n\nThe [STIP-ARB 5/9 multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0x5a5c8Da41220EeF8E7f423f6e9028da5b9E70f8B) is being created. The funds in the multisig belong to the DAO and the signers act as grant managers on behalf of the DAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in DAO governance including delegation. The multisig includes the signers from the original PL-ARB multisig with the addition of to three community members (pending KYC):\n\n* Karel Vuong, Treasure DAO\n* Jack Sanniota, 404 DAO\n* Lindsey Winder, Hedgey Finance\n\nThis new multisig, the STIP-ARB multisig, includes two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n1. Clawback capability so the DAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement.\n\n2. Streaming of funds to grantees every second week for the grants duration using Hedgey. This allows for the halting of funds if misuse is discovered with the goal to stop bad actors, *not punish bad designs*.\n\n## What are the Eligibility Requirements?\n\nGrant Requirements:\n\n* Grantees are required to keep distributions in ARB without converting to other assets.\n* Grantees must not farm their own incentive programs. \n* Grantees must outline a spending plan, provide a pro forma, and state the grant's objective.\n* Grantees must commit to providing data on distributions, all ARB spending transactions, and key metrics like daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period, and be presented preferably in a Dune Spell/dashboard .\n* Grantees must agree to share all contract addresses being used to distribute incentive rewards.\n* Grantees must disclose the contracts being incentivized and denote any external contracts being incentivized as part of the program.\n* Grantees can only incentive contracts on the Arbitrum Network.\n* Grants are not to be used in DAO governance.\n* Grantees are expected to not encourage or partake in sybil attacks against the forum to sway community opinion.\n* Grantees must agree to KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation in order to receive funds.\n* Grantees must apply using the approved program application [template](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-application-template/16544). \n\nBy streaming grant payments, the multisig will be empowered to hold grantees accountable to their proposals by halting fund streaming for any of the following reasons:\n\n* Any use of funds not explicitly described in the grantees application.\n* Failure to comply with data reporting standards.\n  * Grantee recipients will be required to provide Dune dashboards uploaded and posted to the forum by eligible teams by December 15, 2023.\n    * Dashboard requirements are: Daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees for incentivized protocols. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period. If a metric does not apply, or this is not achievable, it should be noted in the application.\n    * More granular dashboards (including pool-level and user analysis) will be noted by the community for future programs.\n  * If dashboards are not posted by this date, the multisig will be empowered to halt incentive funding streams for protocols at their discretion.\n\nIn that this proposal aims to be experimental, the multisig is not intended to provide quality control on the design of incentive programs. Rather, they are empowered to halt streaming in the event of negligence or misuse of funds. \n\n## Eligibility and Evaluation Guidelines\n\nGrants span two award cycles, but projects can only be awarded once. Projects rejected in the first cycle are invited to address delegate/community feedback and reapply for the second cycle.\n\nProtocols can submit grant applications for amounts they feel appropriate. While there's no ARB limit, delegates and voters will assess each grant individually.\n\nAs such, the Arbitrum Working Group has included four grant categories, as well as some recommended metrics by which the community might consider evaluating the grants:\n\n* Beacon Grants (<= 200K ARB)\n  * Recommendations:\n    * Live on Arbitrum for at least 2 months.\n    * Meets one of the following criteria:\n      * .> $1.5M TVL.\n      * .>$2M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n* Siren Grants (Up to 750K ARB)\n  * Recommendations:\n    * Live on Arbitrum for at least 4 months.\n    * Meets one of the following criteria:\n      * .> $4M TVL.\n      * .>$40M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n* Lighthouse Grants* (Up to 2M ARB)\n  * Recommendations:\n    * Live on Arbitrum for at least 6 months.\n    * Meets one of the following criteria:\n      * .> $15M Arbitrum Network TVL.\n      * .> $100M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n* Pinnacle Grants* (> 2M ARB)\n  * Recommendations:\n    * Live on Arbitrum for at least 12 months\n    * Meets one of the following criteria\n      * .> $30M Arbitrum Network TVL\n      * .> $200M 30D cumulative volume\n\nOne could reasonably use the date of publication for this proposal to inform these metrics.\n\n# Steps to Implement (How does the DAO Approve Grants)?\n\nGrants will be approved via a three week process across two cycles.\n\n### Cycle 1\n\n1. Application Period (1 Week):\n\nDuring the Application Stage of the program, eligible protocols will be invited to post proposals in the “Incentive Grant Applications” Category of the Arbitrum Forum using the official Application [Template](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-application-template/16544).\n\nOnce posted, the community may provide feedback on the proposal through the end of the Review Period.\n\n2. Review Period (1 Week):\n\nDelegates and network stakeholders will be asked to provide feedback on grant applications upon each specific forum post. Delegates should engage with the goal of ensuring the responsible use of funds. This means an application should represent a comprehensive strategy for incentive distribution, align with the program goals and requirements, and present their plan to adhere to the aforementioned data standards.\n\nApplicants are expected to adjust, amend, and update their proposals in line with community feedback over this time period. Due to the accelerated timeline of the program, feedback and communication between delegates and applicants will be critical.\n\n3. Voting Period (1 Week):\n\nA delegate will sponsor the proposal throughout the governance process for each grant application. ARB holders and ARB delegates will be invited to vote on each submitted proposal via Snapshot Poll.\n\nTo succeed, eligible applications must receive a greater than 50% majority in favor of the proposal, and receive greater than 71.51 million ARB in favor of the application. If successful, applicants will coordinate with the Arbitrum Foundation and the STIP-ARB multisig to secure the completion of KYC, and receive funding to the address included in their application.\n\n### Cycle 2\n\nRepeat the process outlined in Cycle 1, with the exception that the review period for the second round will comprise a 2 week review period.\n\n# Projected Timeline \nSep. 01, 2023 - Forum Post\nSep. 10, 2023 - Snapshot Vote Begins\nSep. 20, 2023 - On-Chain Vote Begins\n\nRound 1 \n* Application Date Starts: September 20, 2023 12:00 AM EST\n* Application Deadline: September 27, 2023 11:59 PM EST\n* Review Period Starts: September 28, 2023 12:00 AM EST\n* Review Period Deadline: October 3, 2023 11:59 PM EST\n* Voting Period Starts: October 4, 2023\n* Voting Period Deadline: October 11, 2023\n\nRound 2 (Subject to changes)\n* Application Date Starts: October 12, 2023 12:00 AM EST\n* Application Deadline: October 18, 2023 11:59 PM EST\n* Review Period Starts: October 19, 2023 12:00 AM EST\n* Review Period Deadline: November 01, 2023 11:59 PM EST\n* Voting Period Starts: November 2, 2023\n* Voting Period Deadline: November 09, 2023\n\n\n# Overall Cost\n50,094,000 ARB.\n\n# Outstanding Questions and Concerns\n\n**What happens if the budget is exceeded?**\n\nWe do not expect applications to exceed the funding budget of 50M ARB. However, if requested grants do exceed the allocated budget, funding will be allocated based on the amount of votes in favor of a proposal, and then on a first-come, first-serve basis dependent upon the time the proposal was submitted to the Arbitrum Forum. In the event that the budget is exceeded, the DAO may choose to unlock further funds for a third round, or backfund successful incentive proposals.\n\n**What will happen to excess funds?**\n\nFollowing Cycle 2, excess funds remaining in the multisig will be returned to the Arbitrum Treasury address by the multisig.\n\n**What is the plan after the Short Term Incentive Program?**\n\nThe Short Term Incentive Program is designed specifically as a one-time program, with the intention of empowering delegates to process incentives while the DAO designs a more robust, sustainable program in the months throughout the end of the year.\n\nAt the end of the year, if there is no program in place, protocols can put forth direct votes to on-chain governance to extend their programs. This program offers an opportunity for participating protocols to demonstrate mission-aligned conduct as justification for future funding.\n\n**How does the program determine whether to halt funding streams?**\n\nFunds can be stopped by the STIP-ARB Multisig with a 5/9 consensus. Funds will be stopped in the event of negligent actions in violation of the previously defined grant requirements. If halted, the multisig must publish the justification of its decision on the Arbitrum Forum. The stream can restart either through a Snapshot Veto or if the multisig decides the grantee has corrected their actions and it’s appropriate to continue.\n\n**What are the specific KPIs for this program - what determines its success?**\n\n* **Community Support**: The primary KPI for this proposal is aligning with both delegates and protocols to agree on the distribution of funds through the end of 2023, with an agreement to work towards a more efficient, comprehensive, and effective program in 2024.\n* **Network Activity**: An increase in network metrics such as TVL, Volume, Users and Transactions on the incentivized protocols in addition to an increase in general network activity.\n* **Community Awareness**: Raised awareness, collaboration, and understanding of incentive distribution strategies and tactics.\n* **Incentives Data**: Increased data on incentives, grants, and protocol behavior to inform future Arbitrum incentive programs and iterations.\n\n\n***Regarding the StableLab Engagement** StableLab has offered to handle management of the forum process starting September 22, 2023 and has agreed to accept back pay (from the proposal's passing) via weekly streams forward through January 31, 2023. This arrangement was initiated due to their proactive outreach regarding a competitive rate and interest under unique time-constraints and circumstances. If at any point the multisig feels StableLab has not upheld diligence in its responsibilities the multisig is empowered to halt the stream and appoint a new service provided by election. \n\nFurther, due to these last-minute circumstances, the DAO is entitled to elect competitive service providers during the first voting round by signaling a competitive offer in this proposal thread. If a counteroffer(s) is endorsed by a delegate with over 500,000 ARB VP the DAO will hold an election for the remainder of the contract length (endorsement to avoid spam).\n\n\n",

      "content": "# AIP: Building the Future of NFTs: The Rarible Protocol - Arbitrum Integration Proposal [2nd Revision]\n\nThis is an amended draft proposal by the RARI Foundation, addressing community feedback.\n\n## Abstract \n\nThe Rari Foundation is submitting a proposal to jumpstart the growth in the Arbitrum NFT ecosystem. The proposal involves integrating Arbitrum One with the open-source Rarible protocol, which is an indexer, orderbook and SDK powering NFT-based applications, which, once integrated, can be freely and easily used by the Artbitrum builders. \n\n## Motivation \n\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem is hard for independent developers to build NFT-based applications due to a lack of easy-to-use tooling and infrastructure. Without this support, the developer community will be opting for other chains with more robust support for building.\n\nOptimism vs Arbitrum NFT stats as of July 27, 2023 indicate Arbitrum is not the first choice for the creation of NFT assets or contracts. Source [NFT Scan](https://arbitrum.nftscan.com/).\n\nThe open-source Rarible Protocol is specifically focused on the NFT use case and will enable builders to develop their next dapps choosing Arbitrum, resulting in bringing in new Arbitrum users and sequencer revenue. \n\nThe Rarible Protocol is a trusted choice as it’s community governed, has an easy-to-use API, a comprehensive SDK, and is committed to expanding its capabilities to power innovative NFT use cases. Furthermore, the Protocol is used by Rarible.com NFT marketplace, whose brand and community can be leveraged in raising awareness about Arbitrum venturing deeper into NFT tooling. Such signaling to the market will show that the Arbitrum community is serious about growing its ecosystem and flourishing NFTs. Rarible and the Rari Foundation will promote the integration in a cross-marketing push to ensure the NFT and crypto community knows that Arbitrum is serious about NFT growth. This support will consist of (and shall not be limited to): \n- Regular features on Rarible.com top spotlight section (1 million MAU)\n- Dedicated social support for the launch on Rarible’s and Rari Foundation's owned channels (Twitter, Instagram, Discord, 800k+ followers combined)\n- Email blasts for the integration (500k+ subscribers)\n- Leveraging Rarible's and Rari Foundation's press relations\n- Potentially a hackathon\n\nThis proposal is being submitted outside of the pending grants framework, in order to implement the integration asap, as waiting for the grants framework would result in significant implementation delays. As such, the Arbitrum DAO has an opportunity to express its willingness to incentivize ecosystem growth via strategic partnerships.\n\n## Rationale \n \nThe proposed AIP aligns with the Arbitrum community's mission and guiding values by enhancing the utility, scalability, and inclusivity of the Arbitrum network. The Rarible Protocol, a decentralized toolset for NFT applications, is open-source and free, mirroring Arbitrum's commitment to technical inclusivity and neutrality.\nBy integrating Arbitrum One into the Rarible Protocol, we empower developers to create more complex and innovative applications on Arbitrum. This integration increases accessibility to real-time and historical Arbitrum blockchain data, aligning closely with Arbitrum's commitment to user-centricity and technical inclusivity. \n\n## Key Terms\n\n**The Rari Foundation:** The legal entity for the Rari DAO community that is in possession of $RARI Treasury and on the path of possession of the Rarible protocol\n\n**Rarible Inc.:** A leading NFT marketplace that allows users to mint, buy, and sell NFTs. One of the applications using the Rarible protocol.\n\n**Rarible Protocol:** Open-source, free-to-use, community-governed Protocol (which includes an SDK, indexer and orderbook) for the creation, transaction, and distribution of NFTs.\n\n**Rarible SDK:** A part of the Rarible protocol that provides a set of tools for developers to interact with multiple blockchains\n\nA few notes on the [Rarible Protocol](https://rarible.org/):\n\n- It is an open-source, EVM-based SDK and multichain indexer that currently powers 4,000+ NFT marketplaces (including Rarible.com), and a series of non-marketplace-based applications (like wallets and NFT analytics services - see more use cases [here](https://docs.rarible.org/use-cases/use-cases-overview/)). \n- Designed as a set of building blocks, the Rarible protocol empowers the creation of fully customized NFT experiences of any level and complexity. ️\n- API access is lightning-fast, unified, and comprehensive. You gain seamless access to NFT Items, Collections, -Activities, and NFT Metadata across multiple blockchains, including ETH, POL,  IMX, FLOW, TEZ, to name a few —all consolidated within a single endpoint.\n- The protocol’s indexer is the fastest on the market. It retrieves blockchain data through fast APIs, eliminating the need for your own indexer and reducing costs associated with maintaining Blockchain Nodes. \n- User-friendly SDK allows you to seamlessly connect wallets, mint NFTs, put them up for sale, purchase NFTs, showcase collections, and so much more.  The Protocol is the feature-rich product on the market (you can do anything NFT related on our Protocol).\n- Comprehensive Marketplace Support: Our platform offers unrivaled support for various marketplaces, providing access to aggregated orderbooks from major platforms like OS, LR, X2Y2, Sudoswap, and Tezos, so you can ensure your users have access to the most competitive listings in the market.\n- Cutting-Edge NFT API Integration: We pride ourselves on providing the best NFT API support, seamlessly integrating with popular communication tools such as Discord, Zendesk, VIP support, Slack, and TG.\n- Powerful Analytics Capabilities: Our platform boasts best-in-class analytics tools, including OLAP statistics and floor price analysis, empowering users with valuable insights into market trends and performance.\n- Unmatched Reliability: We maintain the highest level of reliability, ensuring a remarkable 99.99% uptime for our protocol, making us the most dependable choice in the market.\n\n## Specifications \n\nBelow is a detailed breakdown of how the integration will take place and the platforms and technologies that will be used. \n\n### Rarible Protocol: Integrating Arbitrum One\n\nThe Rarible Protocol is a decentralized toolset that allows developers to build NFT applications. It includes smart contracts, an indexer, an SDK, and APIs. The integration of Arbitrum One into the Rarible Protocol will extend these capabilities to the Arbitrum ecosystem, enhancing its utility and inclusivity.\n\n- Rarible Arbitrum SDK\n    - The Rarible SDK will expedite Arbitrum application development. By extending the SDK to support Arbitrum One, we will provide developers with tools for interacting with smart contracts, supporting NFT operations like minting, transferring, and burning, and integrating with multiple wallets.\n- Rarible Orderbook & Smart Contracts\n    - Our contracts, specifically the Rarible Exchange V2, will be deployed to the Arbitrum chain, granting access to our off-chain order book. Certain actions such as canceling, confirming, updating, or when price changes occur, are on-chain but the creation of orders is off-chain.\n- Rarible Public API\n    - With the integration of Arbitrum One, the API will offer extended support for these chains, allowing developers to easily access and interact with NFT data on Arbitrum.\n- Rarible Arbitrum Indexer\n    - Rarible’s multichain Indexer will be able to track and record NFT events on Arbitrum, providing developers with a comprehensive view of NFT activities on Arbitrum.\n\n\n## Steps to Implement \n\n### Arbitrum One integration into Rarible Protocol \n\nThe first key milestone will be integrating Arbitrum into the Rarible Protocol, which will set the foundation for future milestones involving building NFT applications on Arbitrum.\n\n**Tasks: Integration of Arbitrum One chain into Rarible Protocol**\n\n- **Arbitrum API Integration:** This task involves integrating the Arbitrum API into the Rarible Protocol API to support Arbitrum One.\n- **Node Preparation:** A separate node for Arbitrum will be set up for rapid indexing upon approval \n- **Contract Deployment:** The Rarible Shared NFT, Rarible Factory (for creating collections), and Rarible ExchangeV2 contracts will be deployed to Arbitrum for users to interact with.\n- **Orderbook:** Rarible’s orderbook will be able to store listings, orders, and bids made with the protocol\nArbitrum Indexer: Index NFT contracts, ERC-721/1155, ERC-20 tokens, Exchange orders & bids (from Seaport & Rarible).\n- **Arbitrum support on Rarible Multichain SDK:** This involves adding a new blockchain, connectors to wallets, and ensuring functionality similar to ETH/Polygon.\n- **Debugging and Testing:** General debugging of all components will be conducted, along with testing on production with OpenSea orders.\n- **Build Testnet for Arbitrum:** An additional environment for the testnet will be set up, including indexing, reindexing, etc.\n\n\n## Timeline \n\nThe tentative timeline consists of 7 weeks in total, 5 of which are the integration phase. If the proposal is approved by early September 2023, the project implementation can be executed in early Q4 2023. \n\n## Overall Cost \n\nAs the integration of the Rarible Protocol and Arbitrum will benefit both ecosystems, we are offering to split the Rarible Protocol integration costs between our two parties with an equal share.\n\n### Integration of Arbitrum One into the Rarible Protocol\n**Duration:** 5 Weeks  \n**Costs:** 200,000 $ (Artibtrum portion = **100,000 $**)\n\n**Payment terms:**\n\n50% payable upon proposal approval\n\n50% payable upon completion (identified as the release of Rarible's protocol integration to Arbitrum, with the API up and running, contracts deployed, NFTs are queryable)\n\nThe 100,000 USD amount is payable in ARB under the exchange rate on the day of the proposal submission. As of Sept 13, the rate is 1 ARB = $0.785339, which translates to 127,351 ARB.\n\nNote that the Rari Foundation will absorb costs related to the service and maintainance of the Protocol upkeep after the integration implementation.\n",

      "title": "Arbitrum Short-term incentive Program",
      "content": "Note: This proposal has been posted on behalf of the Arbitrum Incentives Working Group as a result of multiple community calls and workshops between multiple stakeholders. It does not exclude external incentive proposals from outside of the proposed structure.*\n\n**Abstract**\nThis proposal outlines a one-time, community-created program to distribute up to 75,000,000 ARB of DAO-funded incentives targeting active Arbitrum protocols. Aimed at fulfilling short-term community needs, the program plans to allocate DAO-owned ARB towards incentives while ensuring transparent consensus and distribution methods. It spans two voting rounds and provides incentives to eligible programs designed to fund incentives through the January 31, 2024. It asks all participating grantees to self report data, and dashboards, summarizing grant performance.\n\n**Motivation**\nThis provisional framework aims to distribute incentives fairly and effectively using transparent criteria agreed upon by the community, while a thorough system is developed (1 19, 2 7, 3 4, 4 5).\nThe goals of the program are to:\n•\tSupport Network Growth: Accelerate the distribution of incentives to Arbitrum dApps to drive network and ecosystem growth.\n•\tExperiment with Incentive Grants: Experiment with grant distribution to uncover new incentive strategies that increase user engagement and increase volume, transactions, and liquidity in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n•\tFind new models for grants and developer support that generate maximum activity on the Arbitrum network.\n•\tCreate Incentive Data: Generate data on the efficacy of distributed grants to inform future incentive programs and incentive design.\n\n**Rationale**\nBy incentivizing the use of existing Arbitrum dApps through this proposal, we anticipate increased volume, transactions, users, and liquidity, laying the groundwork for a dynamic ecosystem. While the proposal acts as an experimental program, its primary goal is to ensure basic safeguards while promoting innovative incentive strategies.\n\nGiven that this proposal aims to be a one-time, short term incentive distribution, it lacks the accountability and operational rigor that a full program may provide. As such, we encourage protocols to consider that the use of funds will be both evaluated, and monitored by the community. Any misbehavior, or failure to comply with grant requests will likely result in ineligibility, or at the very least significant discernment, in future incentive or grant programs.\n\n**Specifications**\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program will comprise up to a 75,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols. In order to expedite the distribution of this capital to the ecosystem, the DAO will adopt a bifurcated process comprising two separate processes: the Financial Proposal and Application Process.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\n \n![8b05a5d34faf8659a144f1d35081a89ae83e237e.png](ipfs://bafkreiaizvrpzwo5bn6lxl5ikdywhfakyphtdukgkywpuzpvlrokaaj2oe)\n     \nFollowing a successful Snapshot Temperature Check, the DAO will launch an expedited application and review process, allowing applicants to apply for grants concurrent with the on-chain vote to distribute DAO funds from the treasury.\n\nThe Snapshot Temperature Check will be designed to both achieve consensus and approve funding across four options, where each vote will distinguish support of up to X ARB through the end of January 31, 2024:\n•\tFor up to **25M ARB** through January 31, 2024.\n•\tFor up to **50M ARB** through January 31, 2024.\n•\tFor up to **75M ARB** through January 31, 2024.\n•\tAgainst.\n\n**Financial Proposal**\nThe Financial Proposal will comprise the following:\n•\tA ratification of the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program and application template 37 as articulated in this document.\n•\tApproval of the eligibility criteria, grant budget parameters, distribution strategy, and evaluation requirements.\n•\tA 25,000,000, 50,000,000 or 75,000,000 ARB distribution to the program Multisig.\n•\tA 32,000 ARB operational budget for community/project facilitation.\no\t20,000 ARB to @tnorm as retroactive payment for conducting community moderation:\n\tDraft and review of multiple iterations of incentive proposals.\n\tModeration of community calls and working group telegram.\n\tCoordination individually across dozens of stakeholders and community members over the past three weeks.\no\t12,000 ARB Multisig Signers (A new version of the PL-ARB Grants Safety Multisig 17 - 2K per signer).\n\n**Multisig Setup**\nA new multisig will be created with the signers from the original pl-ARB multisig, under the name of the Arbitrum DAO. The new multisig will include two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n1.\tClawback capability so the DAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement.\n2.\tStreaming of funds to grantees every second week for the grants duration using Hedgey. This allows for the halting of funds if misuse is discovered with the goal to stop bad actors, not punish bad designs.\n\n**What are the Eligibility Requirements?**\n\nGrant Requirements:\n•\tGrantees are required to keep distributions in ARB without converting to other assets.\n•\tGrantees must not farm their own incentive programs.\n•\tGrantees must outline a spending plan, provide a pro forma, and state the grant’s objective.\n•\tGrantees must commit to providing data on distributions, all ARB spending transactions, and key metrics like daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period, and be presented preferably in a Dune Spell/dashboard or alternatively in a report.\n•\tGrantees must agree to share all contract addresses being used to distribute incentive rewards.\n•\tGrantees must disclose the contracts being incentivized and denote any external contracts being incentivized as part of the program.\n•\tGrantees can only incentive contracts on the Arbitrum Network.\n•\tGrants are not to be used in DAO governance.\n•\tGrantees are expected to not encourage or partake in sybil attacks against the forum to sway community opinion.\n•\tGrantees must agree to KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation in order to receive funds.\n•\tGrantees must apply using the approved program application template 15.\n\nBy streaming grant payments, the multisig will be empowered to hold grantees accountable to their proposals by halting fund streaming for any of the following reasons:\n\n•\tAny use of funds not explicitly described in the grantees application.\n•\tFailure to comply with data reporting standards.\no\tGrantee recipients will be required to provide Dune dashboards uploaded and posted to the forum by eligible teams by December 15, 2023.\n•\t•\tDashboard requirements are: Daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees for incentivized protocols. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period. If a metric does not apply, or this is not achievable, it should be noted in the application.\n•\t•\tMore granular dashboards (including pool-level and user analysis) will be noted by the community for future programs.\no\tIf dashboards are not posted by this date, the multisig will be empowered to halt incentive funding streams for protocols at their discretion.\nIn that this proposal aims to be experimental, the multisig is not intended to provide quality control on the design of incentive programs. Rather, they are empowered to halt streaming in the event of negligence or misuse of funds.\n\n**Eligibility and Evaluation Guidelines**\nGrants span two award cycles, but projects can only be awarded once. Projects rejected in the first cycle are invited to address delegate/community feedback and reapply for the second cycle.\nProtocols can submit grant applications for amounts they feel appropriate. While there’s no ARB limit, delegates and voters will assess each grant individually.\nAs such, the Arbitrum Working Group has included four grant categories, as well as some recommended metrics by which the community might consider evaluating the grants:\n\n•\t**Beacon Grants (<= 200K ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 2 months.\n\tMeets one of the following criteria:\n\t.> $1.5M TVL.\n\t.>$2M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n•\t**Siren Grants (Up to 750K ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 4 months.\n\tMeets one of the following criteria:\n\t.> $4M TVL.\n\t.>$40M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n•\t**Lighthouse Grants* (Up to 2M ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 6 months.\n\tMeets one of the following criteria:\n\t.> $15M Arbitrum Network TVL.\n\t.> $100M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n•\t**Pinnacle Grants* (> 2M ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 12 months\n\tMeets one of the following criteria\n\t.> $30M Arbitrum Network TVL\n\t.> $200M 30D cumulative volume\n\n*Grants greater than $1M ARB will be asked to include milestone-based funding tranches in their application.\n\nOne could reasonably use the date of publication for this proposal to inform these metrics.\n\n**Steps to Implement (How does the DAO Approve Grants)?**\nGrants will be approved via a three week process across two cycles.\n\nCycle 1\n1.\tApplication Period (1 Week):\nDuring the Application Stage of the program, eligible protocols will be invited to post proposals in the “Incentive Grant Applications” Category of the Arbitrum Forum using the official Application Template 20.\nOnce posted, the community may provide feedback on the proposal through the end of the Review Period.\n\n2.\tReview Period (1 Week):\nDelegates and network stakeholders will be asked to provide feedback on grant applications upon each specific forum post. Delegates should engage with the goal of ensuring the responsible use of funds. This means an application should represent a comprehensive strategy for incentive distribution, align with the program goals and requirements, and present their plan to adhere to the aforementioned data standards.\nApplicants are expected to adjust, amend, and update their proposals in line with community feedback over this time period. Due to the accelerated timeline of the program, feedback and communication between delegates and applicants will be critical.\n\n3.\tVoting Period (1 Week):\nA delegate will sponsor the proposal throughout the governance process for each grant application. ARB holders and ARB delegates will be invited to vote on each submitted proposal via Snapshot Poll.\nTo succeed, eligible applications must receive a greater than 50% majority in favor of the proposal, and receive greater than 71.51 million ARB in favor of the application. If successful, applicants will coordinate with the Arbitrum Foundation and the PL-ARB multisig to secure the completion of KYC, and receive funding to the address included in their application.\n\nCycle 2\nRepeat the process outlined in Cycle 1, with the exception that the review period for the second round will comprise a 2 week review period.\n\n**Timeline**\n[See image above]\nSep. 01, 2023 - Forum Post\nSep. 09, 2023 - Snapshot Vote Begins\n\nCycle 1\nSep. 16, 2023 - On-Chain Vote and Application Period\nSep. 23, 2023 - Review Period Begins\nSep. 30, 2023 - Voting Round Begins\nOct. 07, 2023 - Funds Distributed\n\nCycle 2\nOct 07, 2023 - Application Period 2 Begins\nOct 14, 2023 - Review Period 2 Begins\nOct 28, 2023 - Voting Round 2 Begins\nNov. 04, 2023 - Funds Distributed\n\n**Overall Cost**\nUp to 75,032,000 ARB.\n\n**Outstanding Questions and Concerns**\n\nWhat happens if the budget is exceeded?\nWe do not expect applications to exceed the funding budget of 75M ARB. However, if requested grants do exceed the allocated budget, funding will be allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis dependent upon the time the proposal was submitted to the Arbitrum Forum. In the event that the budget is exceeded, the DAO may choose to unlock further funds for a third round, or backfund successful incentive proposals.\n\nWhat will happen to excess funds?\nFollowing Cycle 2, excess funds remaining in the multisig will be returned to the Arbitrum Treasury address by the multisig.\n\nWhat is the plan after the Short Term Incentive Program?\nThe Short Term Incentive Program is designed specifically as a one-time program, with the intention of allowing incentives while the DAO designs a more robust, sustainable program in the months throughout the end of the year.\nAt the end of the year, if there is no program in place, protocols can put forth direct votes to on-chain governance to extend their programs. This program offers an opportunity for participating protocols to demonstrate mission-aligned conduct as justification for future funding.\n\nWhat are the specific KPIs for this program - what determines its success?\n•\tCommunity Support: The primary KPI for this proposal is aligning with both delegates and protocols to agree on the distribution of funds through the end of 2023, with an agreement to work towards a more efficient, comprehensive, and effective program in 2024.\n•\tNetwork Activity: An increase in network metrics such as TVL, Volume, Users and Transactions on the incentivized protocols in addition to an increase in general network activity.\n•\tCommunity Awareness: Raised awareness, collaboration, and understanding of incentive distribution strategies and tactics.\n•\tIncentives Data: Increased data on incentives, grants, and protocol behavior to inform future Arbitrum incentive programs and iterations.\n\n**Forum Link **\n\nThis snapshot is replication of the forum post.

      "title": "AIP-7: Arbitrum One Governance Parameter Fixes",
      "content": "# AIP-7: Arbitrum One Governance Parameter Fixes\n\n## Non-Constitutional \n\n## Abstract\nThree independent issues have been identified in the Arbitrum One Governance system and the current proposal aims to address them. Given this is maintenance of the system, after the forum discussion period it will skip the Snapshot temperature check and go directly for an on-chain vote.\n\n## Specifications \n\n### 1. Updating the airdrop distributor fee sweep address to the DAO Treasury’s address\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO airdrop was distributed to users via the [TokenDistributor contract](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x67a24CE4321aB3aF51c2D0a4801c3E111D88C9d9). The recipients are able to claim their tokens until the Ethereum block #18208000 (estimated to be created on the 24th September 2023).\n\nAfter the claim period is over, unclaimed leftover tokens may be swept over to the specified sweepReceiver address, which is currently set to the [L2 treasury timelock](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/deployment-addresses). Per the [Governance Architecture](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md#overall-configuration) documentation, this should be set to the [DAO Treasury’s address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xF3FC178157fb3c87548bAA86F9d24BA38E649B58).\n\n**Fix:** \nCall the the 'setSweepReciever()' function on the TokenDistributor contract, and include the [DAO Treasury address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xF3FC178157fb3c87548bAA86F9d24BA38E649B58) as the _sweepReceiver(address).\n\n### 2. Sequencer gas fee reimbursement parameterization\n\nThe Arbitrum One sequencer pays the necessary gas fees for posting user transactions to Ethereum. This is done through transactions to the Sequencer inbox.\n\nThe sequencer gets reimbursed for these fees in Arbitrum One. The reimbursement is calculated by ArbOS, but two parameters are currently incorrectly configured.\n\n1. The Sequencer Inbox has a fixed cost associated with including a transaction. The value is currently configured to 100000 Ethereum L1 gas units - this can be viewed in the ArbGasInfo precompile through the getPerBatchGasCharge function. If you inspect transactions live in the system (sample from [June 15th](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/tx/mainnet/0xd2eb2dea13148ac8080544cd4eb1df27ad984055760609b23664a54d6e3e24c4/gas-usage) and [July 17th](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/tx/mainnet/0xe11e940a8e0e21c3092bf1785438351348d333a751f658838f0a90dc27813058/gas-usage)), it is possible to see that the fixed cost of including a batch is actually much closer to 240000 Ethereum L1 gas units.\n\n2. The ArbOS L1 pricing system features an optional “amortization cost cap” which is intended to subsidize the fixed posting cost for chains with low activity or AnyTrust chains whose fixed cost is much larger than other data posting costs. This feature was not intended to be enabled on Arbitrum One. As such, the cap was set to its maximum value, 2^64 - 1 (this can be viewed in the ArbGasInfo precompile through the getAmortizedCostCapBips function). However, this did not fully disable the cap. As visible in the code, the amortization cap is only disabled with a value of 0. With the cap set to its maximum value, but still enabled, the cap would prevent the L1 pricer from taking into account the cost of multiple batches posted in the same L1 block. That’s because it would consider the costs of all but the first batch as having a weight of zero, because no time passes since the previous batch if the batches are in the same L1 block. Setting the amortization cap to 0 fixes this issue by bypassing the previously linked if statement to fully disable the amortization code.\n\nThe combination of these two issues add up to gas funds being incorrectly charged to end users, thus not fully reimbursing sequencer operations. This fix will increase fees for users but they will now reflect the actual costs of the system - it is expected to be a minor difference.\n\n**Fix** \n➡️ Transaction to [ArbOwner](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000070#writeContract) precompile calling setPerBatchGasCharge(int64) with the intended value '240000'.\n\n➡️ Transaction to [ArbOwner](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000070#writeContract) precompile calling setAmortizedCostCapBips(uint64) with the intended value '0'.\n\n### 3. L1 Core Governance Timelock scheduleBatch Bug\n\nWhen executing a batch of operations on the [L1ArbitrumTimelock](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE6841D92B0C345144506576eC13ECf5103aC7f49), if more than one operation creates a retryable ticket (i.e., more than one operation targets an L2 chain), the full msg.value value will be forwarded to each one. If not properly constructed, this can lead to retryable tickets that fail to get created. While there are workarounds, the current implementation is error-prone and the fix allows for more graceful creation of several L1 to L2 operations.\n\n**Fix**\nUpgrade the implementation of the [L1ArbitrumTimelock](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE6841D92B0C345144506576eC13ECf5103aC7f49) with the change [here](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/86/files#diff-93cdc770d0b61d15d694632048ac3aa46ff9dd5fa5bfae6b1310568b2e1df187).\n\n–\n\nThe fixes were implemented through Governance Action contracts and can be viewed on the [Governance codebase](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/tree/7d6f4dac06ab98eaa0a4bef9c0dc09a9af6d67fd/src/gov-action-contracts/AIPs/MiscAIP). They have been audited by Trail of Bits and no issues were identified - the audit report will be shared publicly soon.\n\nThe Action contracts have been deployed to the following addresses and can be verified/audited by the community:\n\n* UpdateGasChargeAction: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7b1247f443359d1447cf25e73380bc9b99f2628f\n* SetSweepReceiverAction: https://arbiscan.io/address/0xbaba4daf5800b9746f58c724f05e03880850d578\n* UpdateL1CoreTimelockAction: https://etherscan.io/address/0xbaba4daf5800b9746f58c724f05e03880850d578\n",

      "content": "Informational Non-Constitutional AIP\n\n## Abstract\n\nTo optimize time and organization, we propose that all Snapshot voting, that is, Phase 1 (as displayed on our diagram on the details of the proposal below), start on Monday of each week.\n\nThis will be organized as follows:\n\n* 17 Votes for what remains of this 2023 (starting from September)\n* 53 Votes throughout 2024\n\n \n![Pwv_L9X7r2Zs_4OK7spesPWN4GJOFYzlx1Ni-eQUYpgPRWOq_9FHxdmxZm5VJvE_i05jcDemx3lHqisNdV1XFci35fslxQgzn0E2DTqMvsjECRH5mmVlbpSvQyTGoGOqP1kMApGOnBBqDXEQnRBJsrw.png](ipfs://bafybeifjml2bsdnsq4fidkrfkoucmzrks4z2jri5zpuxprgygnxi2a2lxu)\n    \n\n## Motivation\n\nOn April 2nd, the Arbitrum governance presented its first proposal for discussion. Since then, the forum has received about 39 proposals covering a variety of topics and motivations. Although most of these discussions have been managed in an orderly manner, an increase in the volume of daily proposals could lead to the disorganization of the DAO and an overload of work for the voters.\n\nThe order and predictability of the dates aim to make the DAO more efficient without losing its dynamism.\n\n## Justification\n\nWe consider it necessary to establish the basic infrastructure for the DAO. Therefore, we propose an improvement in the scheduling of proposals. As time goes on, we are likely to see more and more proposals being published; this growth in proposals is fundamental for Arbitrum's success, so we must be organized so that the flow of voting and proposal is as clear and simple as possible.\n\n## Details of the Proposal\n\nCurrently, the procedure to bring an AIP to a vote is as follows:\n\n![592b3c93c0daa6161427ffa1a5926933e33dfc76.png](ipfs://bafkreiemrsidr37dngxewbijvpe73vfluchh2clj42wagujei7ec45i5lm)\n    \nA proposal can be sent to Snapshot (by an address with a weighted vote of 0.01%) randomly any day of the week.\n\nWe propose that proposals only be sent to Snapshot every Monday so that the votes start at the beginning of the week. The votes for 1 month would look something like this:\n \n![d3ab2463d208946cc43eda4aa933f9f960f29010.png](ipfs://bafkreibt5u65pugwvi4puf5dr7x4xev5jgavo6wi32edemfusrfhrbgf44)\n    \n## Considerations\n\n* More than one proposal can be sent to Snapshot. This depends on the delegates who pass the proposals to vote.\n* This schedule does not interfere with the Security Council voting process.\n* Proposals should be sent to Snapshots every Monday from 00:00 until 23:59.\n* If a proposal is not sent to Snapshot the Monday after its publication, it can still be sent in the following weeks.\n* There may be some Mondays when there are no proposals to publish.\n* In case the Arbitrum Foundation integrates a Governance Facilitator, this should ensure that the schedule is followed.\n\nWe also have to emphasize that given the nature of onchain governance, this proposal isn’t necessarily binding to delegates - since delegates can still push proposals at any moment, so it simply serves as a recommendation for better organizational practices and forum guidelines, making Arbitrum’s governance more predictable for both contributors and voters.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal, if accepted, can be implemented the first Monday after it has been approved since it doesn't really require any technical implementations or funding.\n\n## General Cost\n\nThis AIP does not require funds.",

      "title": "AIP 6: Security Council Elections Proposed Implementation Spec",
      "content": "Disclaimer:\nThis proposal and the attached executable were created by the Arbitrum Foundation\n\n# **Security Council Elections**\n\n## **Category: Constitutional - Process**\n\nAs part of its governance, the Arbitrum DAO incorporates a Security Council that can take certain emergency and non-emergency actions:\n* [Section 3 of the Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-3-the-security-council) describes this council in more detail.\n* [Initial Setup Transparency Report](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/foundational-documents/transparency-report-initial-foundation-setup) details the current members of the council.\n* [Section 4 on the Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-4-security-council-elections) outlines an election process that will replace six security council members every six months.\n\nThe first election to replace the first cohort of Security Council Members is expected to begin on the 15th September.\n\n### **Executive summary**\n* This vote relates to the enactment of the Arbitrum Security Council elections.\n* A smart contract system has been developed to enable on-chain voting. That system is final and has undergone multiple security audits.\n* This vote is meant to enable the smart contract system that will allow for the elections, as well as temperature check with the DAO.\n* A successful vote will lead to an on-chain proposal that updates the constitution text with the new sections below, as well as the new Security Council election system being activated within the broader [Arbitrum governanc architecture](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/4f0714cf3651a9ebcddd5bb05b2f841314845c34/docs/overview.md).\n\n### **Implementation Status**\n\nThe code representing the proposed architecture is final and available for full review in:\nhttps://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/commit/46dd56f55f4e0d96548fb6546122d47623c7a804.\n\nThe work has already been audited by Trail of Bits and the identified issues have been patched, the full audit report is available [here](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/6413778294037033c56a25f32ef766c302544a9b/audits/trail_of_bits_sec_council_elections_report_8_9_2023.pdf).\n\nA Code4Rena audit competition has also been completed for the election system.\n\n# **Background**\n\nAn overview of the election process as described by the Constitution\nalongside the process for how to enact a code change to Arbitrum's smart\ncontract suite:\n* [Constitution of the Arbitrum DAO](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution) (esp. sections [3](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-3-the-security-council) and [4](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-4-security-council-elections)) - As noted above, this proposal seeks to enact what is already described in the Constitution.\n* [DAO Governance Architecture](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md) - The proposed architecture makes use of a number of existing governance components.\n\nAn understanding of the following smart contract suites will help the\nreader evaluate this proposal as it re-uses several components:\n* [Open Zeppelin Governor](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-security-council-elections-proposed-implementation-spec/15425) - The proposed architecture inherits a number of OpenZeppelin contracts.\n* [Gnosis Modules](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-docs/blob/e5a669fa66a32aa4fc2ef84b219bc836e9328f6b/safe-core-protocol/plugins.md) - Each of the security councils is a Gnosis Safe, and updating members of the security council is handled via adding Gnosis modules.\n\n# **High-level Election Overview**\n\nThe Constitution specifies that membership of the Security Council is split into two cohorts. Every 6 months, all positions in a single cohort are put up for election.\n\nThe proposed election implementation, which must adhere to [the specification laid out in the Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-4-security-council-elections), is split into:\n* Election stages: The process for selecting and voting for nominees.\n* Update stages: Installing the newly elected cohort into the Arbitrum smart contracts.\n\nThe election process and update stages are performed via on-chain smart contracts. A brief overview of each stage includes:\n\n### **Election Stages**\n\nProcess for selecting and voting for the new cohort of Security council members.\n\n1.  Nominee selection (7 days). Candidates must gain 0.2% of total votable tokens in order to make it to the next step.\n2.  Compliance check by Foundation (14 days). As dictated in the Constitution, the selected nominees must undergo a compliance check to ensure they comply with the legal requirements, service agreements, and additional rules dictated by the Constitution.\n3.  Member election (21 days). Votes are cast and the top 6 nominees are selected.\n\n### **Update Stages**\n\nProcess to install the newly elected cohort of Security Council members into the Arbitrum smart contracts.\n\n1.  Security Council manager update (0 days). The manager is the source of truth for specifying who are the current council members. It processes the election result and takes note on who will be the new security council members.\n2.  L2 timelock + withdrawal + L1 timelock (3 + 7 + 3 days). All actions that directly affect the core Arbitrum contracts must go through a series of timelocks to protect the right for all users to exit. This is a built-in safety mechanism for users who are unhappy with the approved changes.\n3.  Individual council update (0 days). Once the updates have passed through the relevant timelocks, the Security Council manager can install the security council members. This requires updating 4 Gnosis Safe smart contracts that are controlled by the Security Council members.\n\n\n# **Election Stages in detail**\n\n## **1. Nominee selection (7 days)**\n\nThis stage consists of handling election timing, candidate registration,\ncandidate endorsement:\n* Election creation. Elections can be created by anyone, but only every 6 months. The election alternates between targeting the positions on the two cohorts. Once created, this first stage of the election process lasts for 7 days.\n* Candidate registration. During these 7 days, any candidate can register, unless they are already a member of the other cohort. Members of the current cohort (the cohort up for election) are allowed to register for re-election.\n* Endorsing candidates. Delegates can endorse a candidate during this 7 day window. A single delegate can split their vote across multiple candidates. No candidate can accrue more than 0.2% of all votable tokens.\n* Fallback in case of too few candidates. In the event that fewer than 6 candidates receive a 0.2% endorsement, outgoing members of the cohort up for election will be selected to make up to 6 candidates.\n\n### **Implementation details**\n\nThe nominee selection process is implemented by the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor contract.\n\nIt inherits most of its functionality from the Open Zeppelin Governor contracts and we have extended it with an extra feature:\n* Custom counting module to allow delegates to endorse multiple candidates.\n\nThe governor contract has the following characteristics:\n* A new proposal is created each election cycle, with an identifier unique to that election cycle.\n* Candidates can the put themselves forward by calling addContender.* Delegates can call castVoteWithReasonAndParams, supplying custom arguments in the params to indicate which candidate they wish to endorse with what weight.\n\n## **2. Compliance check by the Foundation (14 days)**\n\nThe Foundation will be given 14 days to vet the prospective nominees. If they find that a candidate does not meet the compliance check, they can exclude the candidate from progressing to the next stage. Note that grounds for exclusion could include greater than 3 members of a given organization being represented in the nominee set (as described in section 4 of the Constitution).\n\n### **Implementation details**\n\nThe foundation can exclude a nominee by:\n* Calling a custom excludeNominee function on the same SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor contract.\n\nThe Governor smart contract enforces the 2 week time period and the Foundation must exclude nominees by this deadline.\n\nOnce the compliance check has completed:\n* Anyone can call the execute function on the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor to proceed to the member election stage.\n\nIf there are less than 6 eligible nominees, then the Foundation will consult with outgoing members of the cohort on whether they will continue in this role for another 12 months. Members of the existing cohort may be selected at random to fill the remaining seats.\n\n## **3. Member election (21 days)**\n\nThe voting process can begin once a set of compliant candidates have been successfully nominated.\n\nThe voting process is designed to encourage voters to cast their vote early. Their voting power will eventually decay if they do not cast their vote within the first 7 days:\n* 0 - 7 days. Votes cast will carry weight 1 per token\n* 7 - 21 days. Votes cast will have their weight linearly decreased based on the amount of time that has passed since the 7 day point. By the 21st day, each token will carry a weight of 0.\n\nAdditionally, delegates can cast votes for more than one nominee:\n* Split voting. delegates can split their tokens across multiple nominees, with 1 token representing 1 vote.\n\n### **Implementation details**\n\nThe Security Council member election will take place in a separate\nSecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor contract which will also inherit\nfrom Open Zeppelin Governor contracts.\n\nAfter the 14 day waiting period for the compliance check, anyone can\ntrigger a new member election:\n* Call the execute function in SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor to deploy a new election proposal for SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor\n\nThe SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor includes:\n* A custom counting module that allows delegates to split their vote and accounts for the linear decrease in voting weight.\n* These additional parameters are supplied as the params argument when calling castVoteWithReasonAndParams.\n* The custom counting module also checks that the nominee being voted is a compliant one by checking against the compliant nominee list in the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.\n\nAt the end of the 21 days of election:\n* Anyone can call the execute function on the SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor contract to initiate the update of top 6 nominees with the most votes into SecurityCouncilManager.\n\n# **Update stages in detail**\n\n## **1. Security Council manager update**\n\nThe security council manager is a contract which contains the canonical list of security council members, and which cohort they are part of. When a member election completes, the manager updates its local list of the current cohorts then forms cross chain messages to propagate those updates to each of the Security Council Gnosis safes.\n\nThe manager also provides some additional functionality to allow the security council to:\n* Remove a member: As described in the Constitution, the council can remove one of its own members. The DAO can also remove a member under special conditions described by the Constitution.\n* Add a member: After removing a member, the council can add a member\n* Address rotation: As a practical matter, a council member can rotate one of their own keys. This can only be done with the approval of at least 9/12 council members.\n\n### **Implementation details**\n\nThe manager functionality is contained within a custom SecurityCouncilManager smart contract. Since the SecurityCouncilManager is indirectly able to make calls to the standard UpgradeExecutor contracts which have far reaching powers, special care must be take to ensure the manager only makes council member updates.\n\nCalling the UpgradeExecutors on each of the chains requires navigating withdrawals transactions, timelocks and inboxes, the SecurityCouncilManager outsources the calldata creation for these routes to a UpgradeExecRouteBuilder contract.\n\n## **2. Timelocks and withdrawal**\n\nConstitutional DAO proposals all pass through:\n* L2 timelock (3 days),\n* L2 → L1 withdrawal (\\~7 days),\n* L1 timelock (3 days).\n\nYou can read more about these stages in the [governance docs](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md#proposal-delays). The purpose of these delays is to ensure that users wishing to withdraw their assets before the proposal is executed will have the time to do so. Changing the Security Council members should also provide this guarantee, so after the election has completed and before the Security Councils are updated the update message also goes through these same stages. The update message will use the existing timelocks to enforce these delays.\n\n### **Implementation details**\n\nThe existing governance timelock contracts are used as part of this flow.\n\nThe SecurityCouncilManager is given the PROPOSER role on the L2 timelock enabling it to create messages that will eventually be received by each UpgradeExecutor.\n\n## **3. Individual council updates**\n\nThe new Security Council members need to be installed into 4 Gnosis\nsafes:\n* Arbitrum One 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\n* Arbitrum One 7 of 12 Non-Emergency Security Council\n* Ethereum 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\n* Nova 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\n\nThe old cohort of members will be removed, and the new cohort will\nreplace them.\n\n### **Implementation details**\n\nTo do this the existing [Upgrade Executor contracts](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md#l1-upgrade-executor) on each chain will be installed as Gnosis Safe modules into the Security Council safes. A custom [Governance Action\nContract](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/src/gov-action-contracts/README.md) will be used to call the specific OwnerManager `addOwnerWithThreshold` and\nremoveOwner methods on the Gnosis safes.\n\n## **Additional affordances**\n\nThe Constitution also declares some other additional affordances to certain parties\n\n1.  The DAO can vote to remove a member prior to the end of their term, as long as 10% of possible votes are cast in favor and 5/6 of cast votes are in favor. This will be implemented as a governor with correct quorum and proposal passed thresholds. This governor will be given the rights to call removeMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\n2.  The Security Council can remove a member prior to the end of their term, if 9 of 12 members agree. The 9 of 12 council will be given the rights to call removeMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\n3.  The Security Council can add a member once one has been removed, if 9 of 12 members agree and if there are less than 12 members currently on the council. The 9 of 12 council will be given the rights to call addMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\n\n## **Constitution Updates**\n\nThe proposed implementation mostly satisfies the specification outlined by the Arbitrum Constitution. There are some minor changes that are required to the Constitution's text to take into account the time it takes to install new candidates and to support compliance procedures set out by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nNote, the final wording for how to update the Constitution will be provided in a later revision. We simply want to notify the requirement that the text needs to be changed. At this stage, our request for feedback is focused on the implementation details of the smart contract suite.\n\n### **Update timeline for the election**\n\nThe Section 4 of the Constitution contains the text:\n* From T until T+7 days: Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n* From T+7 days until T+28 days: Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+14 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+14 days and T+28 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+14 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+28 days.\n* At T+28 days: The 6 candidates who have received the most votes are elected and immediately join the Council, replacing the Cohort that was up for re-election.\n\nWe need to make three changes to the Arbitrum Constitution:\n* **New timeline.** A dedicated compliance process must be included between the nominee selection and member election phases. This will shift the timeline of events and the total election will now last at least 42 days alongside additional time to install the newly elected Security Council members via the on-chain governance smart contracts.\n* **Less than 6 eligible nominees.** The Arbitrum Foundation has the authority to add new nominees during the Compliance stage if there are less than 6 eligible nominees.\n* **Installation time.** We need to remove the phrase 'immediately join the Council' to take into account the on-chain governance process for installing the newly elected candidates. For example, the various time locks to protect a user's right to exit Arbitrum during the upgrade and the time it takes to send an L2 -\\L1 message.\n\nWith the above in mind, we propose an update to Section 4 of the\nConstitution with the following text:\n* **Nominee selection (T until T+7 days):** Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens.\n* **Compliance process (T+7 until T+21 days):** All candidates will cooperate with The Arbitrum Foundation and complete the compliance process. The Arbitrum Foundation is responsible for removing any candidates that fail the compliance process. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n* **Member election (T+21 until T+42 days):** Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+28 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+28 days and T+42 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+28 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+42 days.\n* **At T+42 days:** The process for replacing the cohort of Security Council members with the 6 candidates who received the most votes will be activated. The installation process must be executed via the on-chain governance smart contracts and it may take several days until the new Security Council members are installed.\n\n### **Compliance checks by the foundation.**\n\nThe Constitution contains the text:\n* \"Prior to the next Security Council election, The Arbitrum Foundation shall establish and set forth more detailed procedures and guidelines regarding the election process for the Security Council, which may include, but aren't limited to, a candidate intake process in order to comply with Cayman Islands laws, a standard template for candidates to complete for purposes of their public nominations and other processes to ensure an orderly, fair and transparent election.\"\n\nThe text gives an affordance to the Foundation to conduct a compliance check on the potential nominees. We propose to make this check an explicit stage of 14 days between Nominee Selection and Member Election to allow the Foundation to conduct these checks. Details of compliance checks will be provided by the Arbitrum Foundation at a later date.\n\nWe propose to update the Constitution with the following text:\n* The Arbitrum Foundation is allocated 14 days for the Compliance process and it should be executed between the Nominee selection and Member election. The Arbitrum Foundation has flexibility to update its compliance policy for every new election. This is required to allow The Arbitrum Foundation to comply with Cayman Island laws. Furthermore, The Arbitrum Foundation maintains the right to issue new procedures and guidelines for off-chain components of the Security Council election. All efforts should be made by The Arbitrum Foundation to ensure an orderly, fair, and transparent election.\n\n**Security Council cannot re-appoint a member who was removed by the DAO.\n**\nThe Constitution contains the text:\n* The seats of Security Council members who have been removed prior to the end of their respective terms shall remain unfilled until the next election that such seats are up for appointment, unless otherwise replaced prior to such next election by a vote of at least 9 of the Security Council members, in which case such seat shall be up for appointment at the next such election.\n\nThe text focuses on how to replace a security council member who was removed by a vote from the DAO or 9/12 of the current security council members. We plan to update the Constitution to remove an edge-case that allows the Security Council to re-appoint a member who was removed by a DAO vote.\n\nWe propose to update the Constitution with the following text:\n* The seats of Security Council members who have been removed prior to the end of their respective terms shall remain unfilled until the next election that such seats are up for appointment, unless otherwise replaced prior to such next election by a vote of at least 9 of the Security Council members, in which case such seat shall be up for appointment at the next such election. The Security Council may not re-appoint a member removed and they must be re-elected via the election voting system.\n\n### **Final update to the Constitution text.**\n\nFor completeness, the amended text for Section 4 of the Arbitrum Constitution, including the changes from AIP-4:\n\nThe Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into two Cohorts of 6 members.\n\nThe initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the \\'First Cohort\\' and 6 members in the \\'Second Cohort\\'. The members of the initial Security Council Cohorts are detailed in a transparency report [here](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmcny9xqHG9s9HduycwpooW4sV9VUMxYtVwU2eBts7vyYq).\n\nThe first Security Council election is scheduled to begin on the 15th September 2023 or the earliest possible date. The election can only begin upon the availability of an on-chain election process that is approved and installed by the Arbitrum DAO. This first election replaces the \\'First Cohort\\'. The next election replaces the \\'Second Cohort\\' and so forth.\n\nThe date chosen for the first election will form the basis for all future elections. Every election should begin 6 months after the previous election has started and it will replace its respective cohort of 6 members.\n\nAll Security Council members are expected to serve their term until the election is complete and the new Security Council members are installed.\n\nThe following timeline governs an election that starts at time T:\n\n1.  **Nominee selection (T until T+7 days):** Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens.\n2.  **Compliance process (T+7 until T+21 days):** All candidates will cooperate with the Arbitrum Foundation and complete the compliance process. The Arbitrum Foundation is responsible for removing any candidates that fail the compliance process. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n3.  **Member election (T+21 until T+42 days):** Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+14 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+21 days and T+35 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+21 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+42 days.\n4.  **At T+42 days:** The process for replacing the cohort of security council members with the 6 candidates who received the most votes will be activated. The installation process must be executed via the on-chain governance smart contracts and it may take several days until the new security council members are installed.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is allocated 14 days for the Compliance process and it should be executed between the Nominee selection and Member election. The Arbitrum Foundation has flexibility to update its compliance policy for every new election. This is required to allow The\nArbitrum Foundation to comply with Cayman Island laws. Furthermore, The Arbitrum Foundation maintains the right to issue new procedures and guidelines for off-chain components of the Security Council election. All efforts should be made by The Arbitrum Foundation to ensure an orderly, fair, and transparent election.\n\nAs a matter of best practice for maintaining an independent Security Council, no single organization should be overly represented in the Security Council. In particular, there should not be more than 3 candidates associated with a single entity or group of entities being elected to the Security Council, thereby ensuring that there will be no single entity or group of entities able to control or even veto a Security Council vote.\n\nFurthermore, no candidate with conflicts of interest that would prevent them from acting in the best interests of the ArbitrumDAO, Governed Chains and/or The Arbitrum Foundation should be elected to the Security Council. Potential conflicts of interest could be, but are not limited to, affiliations with direct Arbitrum competitors, proven histories of exploiting projects and others.\n\nThe DAO may approve and implement a Constitutional AIP to change the rules governing future Security Council elections, but the AIP process may not be used to intervene in an ongoing election.\n\nSecurity Council members may only be removed prior to the end of their\nterms under two conditions:\n\n1.  At least 10% of all Votable Tokens have casted votes \\\"in favor\\\" of removal and at least 5/6 (83.33%) of all casted votes are \\\"in favor\\\" of removal; or\n2.  At least 9 of the Security Council members vote in favor of removal.\n\nThe seats of Security Council members who have been removed prior to the end of their respective terms shall remain unfilled until the next election that such seats are up for appointment, unless otherwise replaced prior to such next election by a vote of at least 9 of the Security Council members, in which case such seat shall be up for appointment at the next such election. The Security Council may not re-appoint a removed member and they can only be re-elected via the election voting system.",

      "title": "Proposal: Building the Future of NFTs: The Rarible Protocol - Arbitrum Integration Proposal [REVISED]",
      "content": "Category: Non-constitutional\nProposer: RARI Foundation\n\n## Abstract\nThe Rari Foundation is submitting a proposal to jumpstart the growth in the Arbitrum NFT ecosystem. The proposal involves integrating Arbitrum One with the open-source Rarible Protocol, which is an indexer, order book, and SDK powering NFT-based applications, which, once integrated, can be freely and easily used by the Artbitrum builders.\n\n## Motivation\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem is hard for independent developers to build NFT-based applications due to a lack of easy-to-use tooling and infrastructure. Without this support, the developer community will opt for other chains with more robust support for building.\n\nOptimism vs. Arbitrum NFT stats as of July 27, 2023, indicate Arbitrum is not the first choice for the creation of NFT assets or contracts. Source: [NFT Scan 3](https://arbitrum.nftscan.com/).\n\n![98d064c39ba85a45bcb0c4831594150174c0ad8c_2_1380x364.png](ipfs://bafkreibumjn6k4xpmflli2bplvqr73mph4t6uuhrzvrzwuw7izhdcnkll4)\n \n![54086dc9319855e9a48199d7ee4860def6b9399b_2_1380x360.png](ipfs://bafkreieaxoqoikmypdsggspy5vjlqzajm4iod2kq5ib5k5n4ouqpoybsrm)\n\nThe open-source Rarible Protocol is focused explicitly on the NFT use case and will enable builders to develop their next dapps choosing Arbitrum, resulting in bringing in new Arbitrum users and sequencer revenue.\n\nThe Rarible Protocol is a trusted choice as it’s community governed, has an easy-to-use API, a comprehensive SDK, and is committed to expanding its capabilities to power innovative NFT use cases. Furthermore, the Protocol is used by [Rarible.com](https://rarible.com/) NFT marketplace, whose brand and community can be leveraged in raising awareness about Arbitrum venturing deeper into NFT tooling. Such signaling to the market will show that the Arbitrum community is serious about growing its ecosystem and flourishing NFTs. Rarible and the Rari Foundation will promote the integration in a cross-marketing push to ensure the NFT and crypto community knows that Arbitrum is serious about NFT growth. This support will consist of (and shall not be limited to):\n\n* Regular features on [Rarible.com](https://rarible.com/) 1 top spotlight section (1 million MAU)\n* Dedicated social support for the launch on Rarible’s and Rari Foundation’s owned channels (Twitter, Instagram, Discord, 800k+ followers combined)\n* Email blasts for the integration (500k+ subscribers)\n* Leveraging Rarible’s and Rari Foundation’s press relations\n* Potentially a hackathon\n\nThis proposal is being submitted outside of the pending grants framework in order to implement the integration asap, as waiting for the grants framework would result in significant implementation delays. As such, the Arbitrum DAO has an opportunity to express its willingness to incentivize ecosystem growth via strategic partnerships.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe proposed AIP aligns with the Arbitrum community’s mission and guiding values by enhancing the utility, scalability, and inclusivity of the Arbitrum network. The Rarible Protocol, a decentralized toolset for NFT applications, is open-source and free, mirroring Arbitrum’s commitment to technical inclusivity and neutrality.\n\nBy integrating Arbitrum One into the Rarible Protocol, we empower developers to create more complex and innovative applications on Arbitrum. This integration increases accessibility to real-time and historical Arbitrum blockchain data, aligning closely with Arbitrum’s commitment to user-centricity and technical inclusivity.\n\nKey Terms\nThe Rari Foundation: The legal entity for the Rari DAO community that is in possession of $RARI Treasury and on the path of possession of the Rarible Protocol\n\nRarible Inc.: A leading NFT marketplace that allows users to mint, buy, and sell NFTs. One of the applications using the Rarible Protocol.\n\nRarible Protocol: Open-source, free-to-use, community-governed Protocol (which includes an SDK, indexer, and order book) for the creation, transaction, and distribution of NFTs.\n\nRarible SDK: A part of the Rarible Protocol that provides a set of tools for developers to interact with multiple blockchains\n\nA few notes on the [Rarible Protocol](https://rarible.org/):\n* It is an open-source, EVM-based SDK and multichain indexer that currently powers 4,000+ NFT marketplaces (including [Rarible.com](https://rarible.org/), and a series of non-marketplace-based applications (like wallets and NFT analytics services - see more use cases [here](https://docs.rarible.org/use-cases/use-cases-overview/)).\n* Designed as a set of building blocks, the Rarible protocol empowers the creation of fully customized NFT experiences of any level and complexity. ️\n* API access is lightning-fast, unified, and comprehensive. You gain seamless access to NFT Items, Collections, Activities, and NFT Metadata across multiple blockchains, including ETH, POL, IMX, FLOW, and TEZ, to name a few —all consolidated within a single endpoint.\n* The Protocol’s indexer is the fastest on the market. It retrieves blockchain data through fast APIs, eliminating the need for your own indexer and reducing costs associated with maintaining Blockchain Nodes.\n* User-friendly SDK allows you to connect wallets seamlessly, mint NFTs, put them up for sale, purchase NFTs, showcase collections, and so much more. The Protocol is the feature-rich product on the market (you can do anything NFT related on our Protocol).\n* Comprehensive Marketplace Support: Our platform offers unrivaled support for various marketplaces, providing access to aggregated order books from major platforms like OS, LR, X2Y2, Sudoswap, and Tezos, so you can ensure your users have access to the most competitive listings in the market.\n* Cutting-Edge NFT API Integration: We pride ourselves on providing the best NFT API support, seamlessly integrating with popular communication tools such as Discord, Zendesk, VIP support, Slack, and TG.\n* Powerful Analytics Capabilities: Our platform boasts best-in-class analytics tools, including OLAP statistics and floor price analysis, empowering users with valuable insights into market trends and performance.\n* Unmatched Reliability: We maintain the highest level of reliability, ensuring a remarkable 99.99% uptime for our Protocol, making us the most dependable choice in the market.\n\n## Specifications\nBelow is a detailed breakdown of how the integration will take place and the platforms and technologies that will be used.\n\n### Rarible Protocol: Integrating Arbitrum One\nThe Rarible Protocol is a decentralized toolset that allows developers to build NFT applications. It includes smart contracts, an indexer, an SDK, and APIs. The integration of Arbitrum One into the Rarible Protocol will extend these capabilities to the Arbitrum ecosystem, enhancing its utility and inclusivity.\n\n1. Rarible Arbitrum SDK\n - The Rarible SDK will expedite Arbitrum application development. By extending the SDK to support Arbitrum One, we will provide developers with tools for interacting with smart contracts, supporting NFT operations like minting, transferring, and burning, and integrating with multiple wallets.\n2. Rarible Orderbook & Smart Contracts\n - Our contracts, specifically the Rarible Exchange V2, will be deployed to the Arbitrum chain, granting access to our off-chain order book. Certain actions, such as canceling, confirming, updating, or when price changes occur, are on-chain, but orders are created off-chain.\n3. Rarible Public API\n - With the integration of Arbitrum One, the API will offer extended support for these chains, allowing developers to easily access and interact with NFT data on Arbitrum.\n4. Rarible Arbitrum Indexer\n - Rarible’s multichain indexer will be able to track and record NFT events on Arbitrum, providing developers with a comprehensive view of NFT activities on Arbitrum.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n### Arbitrum One integration into Rarible Protocol\n\nThe first key milestone will be integrating Arbitrum into the Rarible Protocol, which will set the foundation for future milestones involving building NFT applications on Arbitrum.\n\nTasks: Integration of Arbitrum One chain into Rarible Protocol\n\n* Arbitrum API Integration: This task involves integrating the Arbitrum API into the Rarible Protocol API to support Arbitrum One.\n* Node Preparation: A separate node for Arbitrum will be set up for rapid indexing upon approval\n* Contract Deployment: The Rarible Shared NFT, Rarible Factory (for creating collections), and Rarible ExchangeV2 contracts will be deployed to Arbitrum for users to interact with.\n* Orderbook: Rarible’s order book will be able to store listings, orders, and bids made with the Protocol\n* Arbitrum Indexer: Index NFT contracts, ERC-721/1155, ERC-20 tokens, Exchange orders & bids (from Seaport & Rarible).\n* Arbitrum support on Rarible Multichain SDK: This involves adding a new blockchain, connectors to wallets, and ensuring functionality similar to ETH/Polygon.\n* Debugging and Testing: General debugging of all components will be conducted, along with testing on production with OpenSea orders.\n* Build Testnet for Arbitrum: An additional environment for the testnet will be set up, including indexing, reindexing, etc.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThe tentative timeline consists of 7 weeks, 5 of which are the integration phase. If the proposal is approved by early September 2023, the project implementation can be executed in early Q4 2023.\n\n![f2c50222937695d8622cbfc5429a99a48c1efaab_2_1380x274.png](ipfs://bafkreidspk3ghv2f32w5jfvtidmypu32j4pmzyf4lius3zl2nflisd2xsm)\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nAs the integration of the Rarible Protocol and Arbitrum will benefit both ecosystems, we are offering to split the Rarible Protocol integration costs between our two parties with an equal share.\n\nIntegration of Arbitrum One into the Rarible Protocol\n\nDuration: 5 Weeks\n\nCosts: 200,000 $ (Artibtrum portion = 100,000 $)\n\nPayment terms:\n* 50% payable upon proposal approval\n* 50% payable upon completion\n\nThe amount is payable in USDC or ETH.\n\nNote that the Rari Foundation will absorb costs related to the service and maintenance of the Protocol upkeep after the integration implementation.",

      "content": "# Proposal: Update Security Council Election Start Date to Ensure Time for Security Audit\n**Category: Constitutional - Process**\n\n* Disclaimers:\n1. The text changed slightly since snapshot (becuase of L2Beat's forum comment)\n2. This proposal and the attached executable were created by the Arbitrum Foundation *\n\n## High Level Overview\nThe ArbitrumDAO Constitution specifies that the first Security Council election should start on the 15th September alongside a specification for the election.\n\nAn on-chain implementation of the entire election is still a work in progress. The Arbitrum Foundation has sponsored the implementation of a smart contract suite by Offchain Labs, an extension of Tally’s user interface, and the respective audits.\n\nThis proposal seeks to revise the ArbitrumDAO Constitution to provide flexibility for the start date of the election. If passed by a Constitutional Vote, the new start date will be on the 15th September or the earliest possible date in which an on-chain election can begin.\n\nThe motivation to change the election’s start date is to provide time for the implementation to be completed, security audits to be performed, for the community to gain confidence in the quality of its implementation and for the Arbitrum DAO to vote on a separate Constitutional AIP to install an on-chain election system.\n\nThe overarching goal is to still allow the election to begin on the 15th September, but it is prudent to provide leeway and ensure all parties, especially the Arbitrum DAO, are confident in the election software’s security and completeness.\n\n## Path to a Smart Contract Enabled Election\nThis proposal seeks approval from the Arbitrum DAO that the first and all subsequent security elections should be performed via the on-chain election process.\n\nThe activation of the Security Council election is dependent on:\n\n- Complete implementation for the on-chain smart contracts,\n- Complete implementation of the user interface,\n- Smart contract audit by a highly regarded auditing firm,\n- All parties, including the Arbitrum DAO, have gained confidence in the implementation’s completeness and security,\n- Successful Constitutional Vote by the DAO to install the new election software.\n\nA vote on this proposal is approving that the above conditions are mandatory for any election software before it can be installed into the on-chain smart contracts.\n\n## Modified Start Date for Election\nThe implementation sponsored by the Arbitrum Foundation should be ready for the start date of the 15th September.\n\nEven so, given the naunces of implementation details and the potential security risks to a critical part of the system, we believe it is still prudent to provide leeway and extra time for the Security Council elections to begin some time after the required date set out by The Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nAfter all, it is not just about having a complete implementation, but ensuring all parties have confidence that all efforts have made been to minimize the risk of bugs in the implementation.\n\n###  Revision to ArbitrumDAO Constitution\nThe revised text focuses on the election beginning at the earliest possible date from the 15th September. Additionally, the election can only begin once an on-chain election system is installed via a separate Constitutional Vote.\n\nAll future elections can begin exactly six months after the previous election. As such, the chosen date for the first election will decide the earliest start date for the next election.\n\nFor extra clarity in the text, we have renamed “September Cohort” to “First Cohort” and “March Cohort” to “Second Cohort”\n\nFinally, to remove any ambiguity, all security council members are expected to serve the time until the new Security Council members are installed in the respective smart contracts.\n\n### Current text of ArbitrumDAO Constitution:\n\n> The Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into a September Cohort of 6 members, and a March Cohort of 6 members. Every year on September 15, 12:00 UTC, an election starts for the 6 September Cohort seats; and every year on March 15, 12:00 UTC, an election starts for the 6 March Cohort seats.\n\n> This means that the initial September Cohort will serve an initial term of 6 months, whereas the initial March Cohort will serve an initial term of 1 year.\n\n> The initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the September Cohort and 6 members in the March Cohort. The members of the initial Security Council Cohorts are detailed in a transparency report \n\n\n### Proposed Revision of Arbitrum Constitution:\n\n> The Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into two Cohorts of 6 members.\n\n> The initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the ‘First Cohort’ and 6 members in the ‘Second Cohort’. The members of the initial Security Council Cohorts are detailed in a transparency report here.\n\n> The first security election is scheduled to begin on the 15th September 2023 or the earliest possible date. The election can only begin upon the availability of an on-chain election process that was approved and installed by the Arbitrum DAO. This first election replaces the ‘First Cohort’. The next election replaces the ‘Second Cohort’ and so forth.\n\n> The date chosen for the first election will form the basis for all future elections. Every election should begin 6 months after the previous election has started and it will replace its respective cohort of 6 members.\n\n> All Security Council members are expected to serve their term until the election is complete and the new Security Council members are installed.\n\n\n## AIP 4 executable code\n\nThis document explains how to create a governance proposal, which can trigger an [AIP action contract](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x85792f6BF346e3Bfd3A275318aDd2c44A1058447#code). \n\nThe AIP can be created in https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/create\n\nTo go through the [governance lifecycle](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md#proposal-lifecycle), the proposal's executable code must first trigger a L2 to L1 transaction through the ArbSys precompile.\n\nFor AIP 4, the `Arbitrum Core` should be selected since this is a constitutional proposal. \n\nTarget contract address: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000064`\n\nCalldata\n\n```\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\n\n```\n\nTo verify the above the calldata, you can generate it yourself with the code from https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/130.\nTo do so, you want to run `scripts/proposals/AIP4/generateProposalData.ts` then encode it as an L2 to L1 transaction to ArbSys, as seen in `sims/arbcore-aip4.sim.ts` from https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance-seatbelt/blob/117639ff19b3c9a664fd92db4e0f4dbabb2a932b/sims/arbcore-aip4.sim.ts#L19\n\nThe deployment can be checked with https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/57758a4e203f43566f587a77282e8a078d1a9ce2/scripts/proposals/AIP4/verifyDeployment.ts\n\nThe side effects of running the proposal can also be verified with [governance-seatbelt](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance-seatbelt)\n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Proposal: Security Council Elections Proposed Implementation Spec",
      "content": "Category: Constitutional - Process\nAs part of its governance, the Arbitrum DAO incorporates a Security Council that can take certain emergency and non-emergency actions:\n\nSection 3 of the Constitution 10 describes this council in more detail.\nInitial Setup Transparency Report 3 details the current members of the council.\nSection 4 on the Constitution outlines an election process that will replace six security council members every six months.\nThe first election to replace the first cohort of Security Council Members is expected to begin on the 15th September.\n\nExecutive summary\nThis vote relates to the enactment of the Arbitrum Security Council elections.\nA smart contract system has been developed to enable on-chain voting. That system is final and under multiple security audits.\nThis vote is meant to temperature check with the DAO both the process that will be conducted for the elections, as well as the smart contract system that will enable them.\nA successful vote will lead to an on-chain proposal that updates the constitution text with the new sections below, as well as the new Security Council election system being activated within the broader Arbitrum governance architecture.\nImplementation Status\nThe code representing the proposed architecture is currently under audit and is available for full review in: GitHub - ArbitrumFoundation/governance at c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5.\n\nThe work has already been audited by Trail of Bits and the identified issues have been patched in, the full audit report will be made available in the codebase soon. A Code4Rena audit competition has also been commissioned for the election system and can be viewed at Code4rena | Keeping high severity bugs out of production\n\nBackground\nAn overview of the election process as described by the Constitution alongside the process for how to enact a code change to Arbitrum’s smart contract suite:\n\nConstitution of the Arbitrum DAO 2 (esp. sections 3 10 and 4) - As noted above, this proposal seeks to enact what is already described in the Constitution.\nDAO Governance Architecture 5 - The proposed architecture makes use of a number of existing governance components.\nAn understanding of the following smart contract suites will help the reader evaluate this proposal as it re-uses several components:\n\nOpen Zeppelin Governor - The proposed architecture inherits a number of OpenZeppelin contracts.\nGnosis Modules 1 - Each of the security councils is a Gnosis Safe, and updating members of the security council is handled via adding Gnosis modules.\nHigh-level Election Overview\nThe Constitution specifies that membership of the Security Council is split into two cohorts. Every 6 months, all positions in a single cohort are put up for election.\n\nThe proposed election implementation, which must adhere to the specification laid out in the Constitution, is split into:\n\nElection stages: The process for selecting and voting for nominees.\nUpdate stages: Installing the newly elected cohort into the Arbitrum smart contracts.\nThe election process and update stages are performed via on-chain smart contracts. A brief overview of each stage includes:\n\nElection Stages\nProcess for selecting and voting for the new cohort of Security council members.\n\nNominee selection (7 days). Candidates must gain 0.2% of total votable tokens in order to make it to the next step.\nCompliance check by Foundation (14 days). As dictated in the Constitution, the selected nominees must undergo a compliance check to ensure they comply with the legal requirements, service agreements, and additional rules dictated by the Constitution.\nMember election (21 days). Votes are cast and the top 6 nominees are selected.\nUpdate Stages\nProcess to install the newly elected cohort of Security Council members into the Arbitrum smart contracts.\n\nSecurity Council manager update (0 days). The manager is the source of truth for specifying who are the current council members. It processes the election result and takes note on who will be the new security council members.\nL2 timelock + withdrawal + L1 timelock (3 + 7 + 3 days). All actions that directly affect the core Arbitrum contracts must go through a series of timelocks to protect the right for all users to exit. This is a built-in safety mechanism for users who are unhappy with the approved changes.\nIndividual council update (0 days). Once the updates have passed through the relevant timelocks, the Security Council manager can install the security council members. This requires updating 4 Gnosis Safe smart contracts that are controlled by the Security Council members.\nSecurity Council Election Flow\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreia2bk2mmknletnshsvxbohkbszppbkb3wdntpnraj7x2gwgx2rgqq)\n    \nElection Stages in detail\n1. Nominee selection (7 days)\nThis stage consists of handling election timing, candidate registration, candidate endorsement:\n\nElection creation. Elections can be created by anyone, but only every 6 months. The election alternates between targeting the positions on the two cohorts. Once created, this first stage of the election process lasts for 7 days.\nCandidate registration. During these 7 days, any candidate can register, unless they are already a member of the other cohort. Members of the current cohort (the cohort up for election) are allowed to register for re-election.\nEndorsing candidates. Delegates can endorse a candidate during this 7 day window. A single delegate can split their vote across multiple candidates. No candidate can accrue more than 0.2% of all votable tokens.\nFallback in case of too few candidates. In the event that fewer than 6 candidates receive a 0.2% endorsement, outgoing members of the cohort up for election will be selected to make up to 6 candidates.\nImplementation details\nThe nominee selection process is implemented by the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor contract.\n\nIt inherits most of its functionality from the Open Zeppelin Governor contracts and we have extended it with an extra feature:\n\nCustom counting module to allow delegates to endorse multiple candidates.\nThe governor contract has the following characteristics:\n\nA new proposal is created each election cycle, with an identifier unique to that election cycle.\nCandidates can the put themselves forward by calling addContender.\nDelegates can call castVoteWithReasonAndParams, supplying custom arguments in the params to indicate which candidate they wish to endorse with what weight.\n2. Compliance check by the Foundation(14 days)\nThe Foundation will be given 14 days to vet the prospective nominees. If they find that a candidate does not meet the compliance check, they can exclude the candidate from progressing to the next stage. Note that grounds for exclusion could include greater than 3 members of a given organisation being represented in the nominee set (as described in section 4 of the Constitution).\n\nImplementation details\nThe foundation can exclude a nominee by:\n\nCalling a custom excludeNominee function on the same SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor contract.\nThe Governor smart contract enforces the 2 week time period and the Foundation must exclude nominees by this deadline.\n\nOnce the compliance check has completed:\n\nAnyone can call the execute function on the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor to proceed to the member election stage.\nIf there are less than 6 eligible nominees, then the Foundation will consult with outgoing members of the cohort on whether they will continue in this role for another 12 months. Members of the existing cohort may be selected at random to fill the remaining seats.\n\n3. Member election (21 days)\nThe voting process can begin once a set of compliant candidates have been successfully nominated.\n\nThe voting process is designed to encourage voters to cast their vote early. Their voting power will eventually decay if they do not cast their vote within the first 7 days:\n\n0 - 7 days. Votes cast will carry weight 1 per token\n7 - 21 days. Votes cast will have their weight linearly decreased based on the amount of time that has passed since the 7 day point. By the 21st day, each token will carry a weight of 0.\nAdditionally, delegates can cast votes for more than one nominee:\n\nSplit voting. delegates can split their tokens across multiple nominees, with 1 token representing 1 vote.\nImplementation details\nThe Security Council member election will take place in a separate SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor contract which will also inherit from Open Zeppelin Governor contracts.\n\nAfter the 14 day waiting period for the compliance check, anyone can trigger a new member election:\n\nCall the execute function in SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor to deploy a new election proposal for SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor\nThe SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor includes:\n\nA custom counting module that allows delegates to split their vote and accounts for the linear decrease in voting weight.\nThese additional parameters are supplied as the params argument when calling castVoteWithReasonAndParams.\nThe custom counting module also checks that the nominee being voted is a compliant one by checking against the compliant nominee list in the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.\nAt the end of the 21 days of election:\n\nAnyone can call the execute function on the SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor contract to initiate the update of top 6 nominees with the most votes into SecurityCouncilManager.\nUpdate stages in detail\n1. Security Council manager update\nThe security council manager is a contract which contains the canonical list of security council members, and which cohort they are part of. When a member election completes, the manager updates its local list of the current cohorts then forms cross chain messages to propagate those updates to each of the Security Council Gnosis safes.\n\nThe manager also provides some additional functionality to allow the security council to:\n\nRemove a member: As described in the Constitution, the council can remove one of its own members. The DAO can also remove a member under special conditions described by the Constitution.\nAdd a member: After removing a member, the council can add a member\nAddress rotation: As a practical matter, a council member can rotate one of their own keys. This can only be done with the approval of at least 9/12 council members as well as explicit approval from the member carrying out the rotation.\nImplementation details\nThe manager functionality is contained within a custom SecurityCouncilManager smart contract. Since the SecurityCouncilManager is indirectly able to make calls to the standard UpgradeExecutor contracts which have far reaching powers, special care must be take to ensure the manager only makes council member updates.\n\nCalling the UpgradeExecutors on each of the chains requires navigating withdrawals transactions, timelocks and inboxes, the SecurityCouncilManager outsources the calldata creation for these routes to a UpgradeExecRouteBuilder contract.\n\n2. Timelocks and withdrawal\nConstitutional DAO proposals all pass through:\n\nL2 timelock (3 days),\nL2 → L1 withdrawal (~7 days),\nL1 timelock (3 days).\nYou can read more about these stages in the governance docs 1. The purpose of these delays is to ensure that users wishing to withdraw their assets before the proposal is executed will have the time to do so. Changing the Security Council members should also provide this guarantee, so after the election has completed and before the Security Councils are updated the update message also goes through these same stages. The update message will use the existing timelocks to enforce these delays.\n\nImplementation details\nThe existing governance timelock contracts are used as part of this flow.\n\nThe SecurityCouncilManager is given the PROPOSER role on the L2 timelock enabling it to create messages that will eventually be received by each UpgradeExecutor.\n\n3. Individual council updates\nThe new Security Council members need to be installed into 4 Gnosis safes:\n\nArbitrum One 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\nArbitrum One 7 of 12 Non-Emergency Security Council\nEthereum 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\nNova 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\nThe old cohort of members will be removed, and the new cohort will replace them.\n\nImplementation details\nTo do this the existing Upgrade Executor contracts on each chain will be installed as Gnosis Safe modules into the Security Council safes. A custom Governance Action Contract 2 will be used to call the specific OwnerManager addOwnerWithThreshold and removeOwner methods on the Gnosis safes.\n\nAdditional affordances\nThe Constitution also declares some other additional affordances to certain parties\n\nThe DAO can vote to remove a member prior to the end of their term, as long as 10% of possible votes are cast in favour and 5/6 of cast votes are in favour. This will be implemented as a governor with correct quorum and proposal passed thresholds. This governor will be given the rights to call removeMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\nThe Security Council can remove a member prior to the end of their term, if 9 of 12 members agree. The 9 of 12 council will be given the rights to call removeMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\nThe Security Council can add a member once one has been removed, if 9 of 12 members agree and if there are less than 12 members currently on the council. The 9 of 12 council will be given the rights to call addMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\nConstitution Updates\nThe proposed implementation mostly satisfies the specification outlined by the Arbitrum Constitution. There are some minor changes that are required to the Constitution’s text to take into account the time it takes to install new candidates and to support compliance procedures set out by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nNote, the final wording for how to update the Constitution will be provided in a later revision. We simply want to notify the requirement that the text needs to be changed. At this stage, our request for feedback is focused on the implementation details of the smart contract suite.\n\nUpdate timeline for the election\nThe Section 4 of the Constitution contains the text:\n\nFrom T until T+7 days: Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n\nFrom T+7 days until T+28 days: Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+14 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+14 days and T+28 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+14 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+28 days.\n\nAt T+28 days: The 6 candidates who have received the most votes are elected and immediately join the Council, replacing the Cohort that was up for re-election.\n\nWe need to make three changes to the Arbitrum Constitution:\n\nNew timeline. A dedicated compliance process must be included between the nominee selection and member election phases. This will shift the timeline of events and the total election will now last at least 42 days alongside additional time to install the newly elected Security Council members via the on-chain governance smart contracts.\nLess than 6 eligible nominees. The Arbitrum Foundation has the authority to add new nominees during the Compliance stage if there are less than 6 eligible nominees.\nInstallation time. We need to remove the phrase ‘immediately join the Council’ to take into account the on-chain governance process for installing the newly elected candidates. For example, the various time locks to protect a user’s right to exit Arbitrum during the upgrade and the time it takes to send an L2 → L1 message.\nWith the above in mind, we propose an update to Section 4 of the Constitution with the following text:\n\nNominee selection (T until T+7 days): Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens.\n\nCompliance process (T+7 until T+21 days): All candidates will cooperate with The Arbitrum Foundation and complete the compliance process. The Arbitrum Foundation is responsible for removing any candidates that fail the compliance process. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n\nMember election (T+21 until T+42 days): Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+28 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+28 days and T+42 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+28 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+42 days.\n\nAt T+42 days: The process for replacing the cohort of Security Council members with the 6 candidates who received the most votes will be activated. The installation process must be executed via the on-chain governance smart contracts and it may take several days until the new Security Council members are installed.\n\n\nWe propose to update the Constitution with the following text:\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is allocated 14 days for the Compliance process and it should be executed between the Nominee selection and Member election. The Arbitrum Foundation has flexibility to update its compliance policy for every new election. This is required to allow The Arbitrum Foundation to comply with Cayman Island laws. Furthermore, The Arbitrum Foundation maintains the right to issue new procedures and guidelines for off-chain components of the Security Council election. All efforts should be made by The Arbitrum Foundation to ensure an orderly, fair, and transparent election.\nFinal update to the Constitution text.\nFor completeness, the amended text for Section 4 of the Arbitrum Constitution, including the changes from AIP-4:\n\nThe Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into two Cohorts of 6 members.\n\nThe initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the ‘First Cohort’ and 6 members in the ‘Second Cohort’. The members of the initial Security Council Cohorts are detailed in a transparency report  linked in the discussion",

      "content": "**Proposer:** disruptionjoe.eth\n\n**Authors:** Plurality Labs\n\n# TL;DR\nThis proposal requests 3,360,000 ARB (0.07% of the total treasury) to fund the first of three milestones in a comprehensive plan to build an Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants Program.\n\n### Voting Options\n- Yes, fund Milestone 1 (3.36 million ARB)\n- No, do not fund Milestone 1\n- Abstain\n\nMilestone 1 is the start of this journey with a funding request that breaks down as follows:\n\n### Fund Allocation\n- 2.5 million ARB: Funding Ecosystem Development\n- 300k ARB: Matching Gitcoin Funding Pools which use Arbitrum\n\n**Total Funds to be Allocated = 2.8 million ARB**\n\n### Services\n- 336k ARB (12%): Plurality Labs Services\n- 224k ARB (8%): Grant Program Managers\n\n**Total Service Fees (20%) = 560k ARB**\n\n#### Proposal Total = 3,360,000 ARB\n\nSuccessful completion of these Milestone 1 deliverables will be a major value driver for the Arbitrum ecosystem further establishing Arbitrum as the go to scaling solution for Ethereum. Plurality Labs is committing to being held accountable for the following Milestone 1 deliverables.\n\n# Deliverables\nAt the end of Milestone 1 (Est. March 2024), Plurality Labs will have delivered:\n\n### Discover | Facilitate DAO native workshops\n\n- Conduct DAO native sensemaking to find the Arbitrum DAO Vision, Mission, Values\n- Clearly define funding priorities including short & long-term goals & boundaries\n- Establish and confirm key success metrics for the Grants Program\n- Scope out requirements for a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum\n- Establish clear communications cadences & channels for all key stakeholders to engage with the program\n\n### Design | Construct best-in-class Pluralistic Grants Program\n\n- Identify suitable tools and technology to support a robust, secure and efficient grants program (i.e. Allo)\n- Design and process map the end-to-end grant funding flows\n- Design approach, process, and channels for sourcing high impact grants ideas\n- Design Grantee Registration process and grant pipeline management structure\n- Design Grant Program manager application process and assessment criteria\n- Work with Gitcoin to set up and launch a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum\n- Design credibly neutral grant funding evaluation criteria, reporting structure and cadence\n\n### Execute | Facilitate the successful execution of Pluralist Grants Programs\n\n- Onboard and coach Pluralist Program Managers in grant program best practices\n- Deploy 2.5 million ARB in funding to programs selected via the Pluralist Program Managers\n- Deploy 300k ARB to Gitcoin Grants round recipients\n- Oversee grants rounds to ensure they are free from fraud or abuse\n\n### Evaluate | Report back on grant funding outcomes\n\n- Publish financial & analytics reports on grant funding value, volume, outcomes, and other relevant metrics requested by the community\n- Share key learnings and grants program best practices with Arbitrum DAO and the wider web3 community\n- Collate community feedback and input on grants programs' efficacy and success\n- Evaluate, review, and iterate based on this feedback to continually improve the overall impact of the Arbitrum DAO grants program\n\n# Motivation\n\nWe are here because Arbitrum intends to deploy one of the largest DAO treasuries ever to grow its ecosystem. A 10% difference in the allocation efficiency of funds could mean hundreds of millions of waste which would impede Arbitrum’s ability to actualize its full potential. It’s easy to say, “We can solve these problems later”, but we have an opportunity to start on the right track and solve these problems today\n\nThe Plurality Labs team has a chip on our shoulder. We have all been in DAOs and have seen how governance can fail, sometimes quickly, sometimes quietly. Our common thread is the shared values of trust, transparency and freedom combined with a passion for helping DAOs solve hard problems.\n\n# Rational\n\nA Pluralist Grants program provides a perfect middle ground between Decentralized and Centralized Grants programs, unlocking the “best of both worlds\".\n\nAt its core, the Pluralistic Grants Model will see the Pluralistic Grants Program Allocator onboard 4-6 pluralist grants managers who will be responsible for distributing funds to grant applicants that benefit the Arbitrum Ecosystem. Sourcing and selection of these ideas will use novel combinations of bottoms-up and top-down mechanisms facilitated by Plurality Labs.\n\nThe programs will focus on specific needs within the ecosystem and their potential impact, for example, one Pluralist Grants Manager may focus on bringing a novel new technique for fund allocation or deep grants proposal expertise (i.e. Questbook). Another might stand up an Arbitrum gaming-specific grants program. This flexibility allows for experimentation to allow Arbitrum DAO to discover what works best and allows for the specific needs of the Arbitrum ecosystem to be catered to.\n\nOur approach includes a progressive decentralization of the Pluralist Grants Program Allocator. During Milestone 1, Plurality Labs will maintain accountability for sourcing, selecting, reporting on and delivering results of the chosen pluralist grants programs.\n\nMilestones 2 & 3 will see experimentation with decentralized allocation mechanisms in a Proof of Concept stage with the goal of running at least one round of Pluralist Grants Program selection in a fully decentralized way without needing any corrective intervention.\n\nDuring the discovery phase, we will gather input from delegates and the broader community to define the vision, mission, and values of the Arbitrum DAO, and determine what needs to be funded.\n\nOnce this foundation is established, we will evaluate the best domains and mechanisms for allocating resources and capital to grantees. Pluralistic Program managers will play a crucial role in promoting experimentation, decentralization of decisions, and improved resource allocation outcomes.\n\nWe have observed that many previous grants programs have struggled with an inability to source great grant opportunities, which we hope to address in the following ways:\n\n- Applications to be program managers should separate from the applications for grant program ideas\n- Create a backlog of “high impact work to be done” be created, allowing competent builders to step to deliver impact for Arbiturm DAO\n- Create a list of builders, potential grantees, and those interested in supporting the Arbitrum ecosystem which can be direct towards the “high impact work that needs to be done”\n- Robust evaluation and reporting facilitated by Plurality Labs reduce time/effort/reliance on Project Manager and  Grantees to demonstrate their success to the community\n- Launch a Grant Program accelerator program to provide grantees clear guidelines, training and support to develop a high quality grant submissions\n\nThe selection of the Pluralist Grants Programs and their managers will involve a facilitated bottoms-up approach, sourcing ideas, people, and processes. Factors considered in the selection may include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Previous experience delivering grants programs.\n- Domain expertise and knowledge\n- Ability to source innovative grants projects and support in the maintenance of a healthy pipeline of grants submission\n- Maturity of program-specific processes and tooling\n- Nature of proposed funding allocation mechanism and data on demonstrated impact/success of the mechanism\n- Demonstrated involvement with and commitment to Arbitrum ecosystem and its values\n- This is an exhaustive list, and the criteria for selecting Program Managers will be further refined in the Discovery and Design phase, with input from delegates and the broader community. We are committed to maintaining credible neutrality in the selection process.\n\nWith this approach we are confident that the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants Program will be fair, impactful and ultimately support the growth and success of the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\nThe Pluralistic Grants model also provides 300k ARB to support matching Gitcoin rounds which run on Arbitrum.\nThis is not a payment to Gitcoin the organization, but a payment to match the funding pools of programs willing to run on Arbitrum. Gitcoin core rounds include support for Open Source Software, Ethereum Infrastructure, & Zero Knowledge. This aligns with the stated Arbitrum goal of supporting the Ethereum ecosystem while also attracting users who might otherwise choose another L2. It also allows us to tap into the support of the Gitcoin DevRel team to help source builders, host hackathons.\n\nFunding grants this way will not only benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem but enable the Gitcoin product team to prioritize making their Allo protocol available on Arbitrum. By being able to execute pluralistic programs on their Allo protocol allows us an open data substrate which will enable us to compare programs and projects across the pluralist framework. It also allows program managers to use quadratic funding and quadratic voting (if they choose) which require Sybil defense. This is a crucial enabler for the next section.\n\n\n\n# Improved Accountability, Transparency, and Reporting\nImproved Accountability, Transparency, and Reporting are key benefits of the Pluralistic Grants model. Web3 spends 100’s of millions annually on different grants and grants programs and to date, there has been little focus on the efficiency of those grant programs or the efficacy of their spending. We intend to build grant program efficiency metrics as well as specific grantee project efficacy (or results) metrics.\n\nBy using a common framework for executing a plurality of grant programs, we have the ability to identify, track and refine metrics for each unique grant program. Something that has not been done to date, and would be more difficult to do in stand-alone grant environments.\n\nBy doing this, we can begin to build qualitative data on the efficiency of each distribution method in a way that can identify improvements for that mechanism, but also compare mechanisms across stakeholder groups and use cases. By building these metrics, Arbitrum will be able to parse down the crowded field of grant execution options and deliver the most effective Grants Program web3 has seen to date.\n\nGrant program execution typically stops when the money has been distributed, and we think that is premature. As part of this program we intend to experiment with a series of existing post-project evaluation tools (after action reviews, qualitative/quantitative metrics, case studies) but add in or invent novel web3 project evaluation solutions (hypercerts, on-chain analysis, panel reviews) to rate every project receiving funding in a way that can demonstrate the efficacy of the spending as it relates to building the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nWe know there are inefficiencies and fraud in the web3 grant mechanisms; this part of the program allows Arbitrum to make the most of its investments. Doing this will lead to a higher return on the Arbitrum investment and more funding for the most worthy projects while leaving room to experiment with the novel web3 mechanism that can help us revolutionize the grant process.\n\n# Multisig Management\n## Grants Safety Multisig\nOn Tally, the request is to send 3.36 million ARB to the PL-ARB Grants Safety Multisig.\n\narb1:0xC158b555F0B1ddd7F4D4f97Fd2a9acd144f8e0D4\n\nThe 4/6 which includes 4 delegates with over 500k ARB plus 2 Plurality Labs team members. \n\n### Signers include:\n\n**Delegates**\n- Frisson (6.59m)\n -Soby (5.33m)\n- Coinflipcanda (4.95m)\n- Nathan (680k)\n\n**Plurality Labs**\n- Disruption Joe\n- Shawn Grubb\n\nThere are two layers of community protection against misuse or abuse of funds.\n\n### Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module\n\n- DAO can clawback funds from multisig direct to its treasury with a vote\n- Protects from a corrupted set of multisig signers\n### Grants Safety Multisig Signers\n\n- A multisig protects from simple wallet hacks\n- Protects from having the service provider hold all the funds\n- Protects against obvious self dealing or abuse\n- Provides a more integrated delegate watching the program closely\n- Does not decide how funds are allocated - Only a signer\n- This multisig is set up with a Gnosis Zodiac OZ governor module looking at the Arbitrum token contract. This means that the DAO can at any point reclaim the funds in this multisig with a vote on Tally. (Quorum is set at 100 million ARB for non-constitutional vote)\n\n## Role of Signers and Governance \nThe role of the multisig signer is solely to protect and prevent fraud and abuse such as perceived “self-dealing” by Plurality Labs. They are not expected to actively participate in deciding where funds should be allocated.\n\nThis multisig will review, sign and execute all fund disbursement for the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants program.\n\nDuring our sessions with the community, we learned that there is not an expectation of any election or term limits for this multisig because it does not actively make any decisions. Instead the requirements should be large delegates (skin in the game), active (will actually sign in timely manner), and has reputation (wants to maintain positive impression).\n\n***This vote will enable the DAO at any time to set term limits or request elections and for that request to be executed within 30 days. Governance requests for the Grants Safety Multisig will only require a winning vote on snapshot which meets non-constitutional quorum.***\n\n## Plurality Labs Payment\nUpon receipt of 3.36 million ARB, the Grants Safety Multisig will send 30% of the Plurality Labs service fee to the Plurality Labs wallet: arb1:0x76Ae3Af25332F5cd01c312E281685Bb35D7d27eA\n\nThe remaining 70% will be streamed to the Plurality Labs wallet over a period of 6 months. This means that if the DAO believes Plurality Labs is performing poorly, they can even clawback the payment to Plurality Labs.\n\nWe also intend to use the Zodiac module shared by the Tally team allowing the DAO the ability to clawback funds from the grants program at any time.\n\n# Plurality Labs Team\n### Disruption Joe\n\nRan grants operations for Gitcoin Grants rounds 8-10 growing gross marketplace value from $2 - $10 million. First Gitcoin employee to leave the company and work full-time for the DAO. Started the Fraud Detection & Defense (FDD) workstream. FDD is responsible for stopping over $3 million in fraud while Gitcoin Grants delivered over $50 million in funding.\n\nMore reading about the work done in the FDD Review. Joe will be supporting overall project management and grants framework design.\n\n### Pepperoni Jo3 (on behalf of r3gen.finance 2)\n\nCofounder of r3gen, a web3 financial service provider working with clients including Squid, Coordinape, Inverse Finance and Treasure DAO.

Introduced to the blockchain in 2015 he went full-time degen in 2019 but moved to DAOs in 2021 when he joined Index Coop leading the governance communications and people operations. In August 2022, he joined Gitcoin where he currently leads governance\n\n# Looking Ahead: Milestone 2 & 3\nThe overall plan is to deploy a pluralist grants framework which operates in a politically decentralized & capture resistant way. This will fund grants programs in a continuous way that minimizes bureaucracy and increases action while providing accountability as part of the system.\n\nPrior to releasing funds for milestone 2 to begin, Plurality Labs will offer a review of the previous milestone accomplishments and failures… The same process will occur before Milestone 3.\n\nMilestones 2 & 3 are about scaling the frameworks and models we use while iteratively testing them. By the end of Milestone 3, we hope to have built the needed components for the entire process to run autonomously onchain.\n\n## Milestone 3 - Completion of the full project\nWe expect this to take 18 months in total. Each milestone being a 6 month cycle of iterative improvement. At the end of the third milestone we will provide:\n\n### Metrics\n- The number of quality active developers building on Arbitrum is growing at an increasing rate. (The combination of a quality assessment and the nuance of an increasing rate of growth indicates healthy and sustainable growth.)\n- Voter participation is increasing as indicated by # of active ARB holders in participating in grants governance. (Participation, especially those buying ARB to participate, is a key indicator of ARB value as a governance token providing political decentralization.)\n- DAO delegates’ satisfaction with Plurality Labs service is improving as measured by NPS. (The delegate’s happiness with Plurality Labs service indicates success as viewed by the delegates.)\n\n### What will have been achieved?\n- Capture-resistant governance of the grants program which supports continuous and sustainable funding of the grants program going forward.\n- Ability to massively scale allocation amounts such that the DAO can comfortably allocate significant capital to grow the Arbitrum ecosystem by improving sourcing pipelines, standardizing evaluation models, and using multiple allocation methods appropriately aligned to outcomes.\n- Improvements in the DAOs ability to sense, make and drive impact and outcomes by bringing the right information to the right decision making apparatus in a way that cuts off poor performance and doubles down on high-impact work.\n\n# Voting Options\n- Yes, fund Milestone 1 (3.36 million ARB)\n- No, do not fund Milestone 1\n- Abstain\n\n# Reference Discussions\n\nForum Discussion https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-3-non-constitutional-fund-the-arbitrum-grants-framework-proposal-milestone-1/14976\n\nSnapshot Passed 7/18 https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xa0e14b85197d73e825ac30f72b7d895d644ed06159a32a578f4efe47a2739b2f",

      "title": "Arbitrum DAO Grants - Delegated Domain Allocation by Questbook",
      "content": "Author Saurabh, Questbook\n\nType Non-Constitutional\n\n### **Abstract**\n\n- We propose Arbitrum DAO to launch Arbitrum grants program with a budget of $1M spread across 2 quarters to fund a *wide variety* of teams building apps on top of Arbitrum in a transparent manner. Questbook is leading [Compound](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136) grants program through [delegated domain capital allocation model](https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/) , a community-run grants program.\n- We additionally propose that this budget be managed by **4** **individuals called Domain Allocators - chosen from the community and by the community**. These domain allocators would manage grants for a *domain*. These domains are strategic areas of focus for which Arbitrum wants to disburse grants\n- The performance of each of these *domain allocators* will be publicly viewable and auditable using rich dashboards. At the end of the quarter, the Arbitrum community can vote to replace, continue domain allocators or increase budgets for each *domain allocator.*\n- We ([Questbook.xyz](https://questbook.xyz/) ) **will help facilitate setting up these *domain allocators* and provide the tooling to run the grants program in an efficient and transparent way**. We have previously set up or currently setting up the grants process for Compound, Polygon, Solana, Celo, and Aave.\n\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nAs we continue to experience the depth of the bear market, it is increasingly important for Arbitrum to retain the mindshare of key ecosystem contributors and incentivize builders to build on top of it. Grants program is a great way to attract high-quality builders and grow the ecosystem more quickly. This proposal details the benefit to all the stakeholders involved - token holders, builders and DAO members\n\n## **Rationale (Benefits to Arbitrum)**\n\nThe proposed structure will lead to the following outcomes:\n\n1. Aligned allocation of funds: By leveraging the Delegated Domain Allocator (DDA) model, Arbitrum DAO can ensure that funds are allocated to projects that align with the domain (selected by the Arbitrum community), promoting efficient and effective use of resources. This approach aligns with Arbitrum’s goal of enabling the distribution of grants and empower the community to build and participate in the future of the Arbitrum.\n2. Increased transparency: The Delegated Domain Allocator approach provides a clear and transparent process for allocating funds, ensuring stakeholders understand the decision-making process and building community confidence. Questbook, a decentralized grant management platform, provides a transparent space for teams to showcase their backgrounds and experience. In addition, Questbook’s reporting features will allow Arbitrum to quickly generate monthly reports on the allocation of funds, with the details for each grant proposal.\n3. Increased accountability: With a dedicated group of stakeholders responsible for allocating funds, the Delegated Domain Allocator approach promotes increased accountability, ensuring that the funds are used effectively and efficiently. Domain allocators can be replaced through a community vote if their performance is not up to the standards accepted by the community.\n4. Lower Turnaround Time (TAT): The Delegated Domain Capital Allocation model will help improve proposals’ turnaround time and overall outcomes for the ecosystem. An example of this is Compound who’s already leveraging the DDA model and has a communication TAT of less than 48 hours. The performance of domain allocators will be measured using objectives and key results (OKRs) to ensure goals are achieved efficiently and effectively.\n5. Strong Brand Recognition : The Delegated Domain Allocator model will play a crucial role in boosting developer engagement with Arbitrum, as well as forming strategic partnerships with important ecosystems to jointly fund grants in mutually beneficial areas.\n\n### Specifications\n\nThe program structure focuses on having community members as domain allocators. Arbitrum DAO will be required to set a budget of $1M to be disbursed by 4 domain allocators and for committee compensation. Each domain allocator will be elected by the community. Interested community members can self-nominate themselves to be considered for becoming a domain allocator. The domain allocator for each domain will be selected via a community-wide Snapshot vote. Domain allocators will run their domain on-chain for full transparency. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible to the community in order to evaluate the domain allocator’s performance.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\n\n**Arbitrum Grants Committee**\n\nThe program will consist of\n\n1. A Program Manager\n2. 4 Domain Allocators\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uIjprH3.png)\n\nWe propose [Tally’s Zodiac Governor Module](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/questbook-arb-dao-grants) for security purposes, furthermore, a Grants SAFE with a 4/6 multi-sig will be set up between the program manager and four domain allocators, one member from the DAO. We will then have four SAFEs for each of the domains with a 3/4 multi-sig setup between the program manager, the specific domain allocator, one more domain allocator, and one member from the DAO.\n\n**[Questbook ARB DAO GRANTS](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/questbook-arb-dao-grants)** acts as a security layer for grants multisig, empowering ARB holders to control multisig when needed.\n\nCurrently, we have four signers on the Safe, and the Safe is 3/4  until the domain allocators are elected by the community. As a result, we will have three temporary signers:\n\n1. Saurabh - Program Manager\n2. Frisson - Arbitrum Delegate \n3. Coinflip - Arbitrum Delegate\n4. Matt Stable Labs - Arbitrum Delegate\n\nHere’s the multi-sig address: [0xB7c1551BBEB47Eb86266153df5F9D7dA47F08308](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0xB7c1551BBEB47Eb86266153df5F9D7dA47F08308)\n\nWe have identified the following domains based on our thorough research and the feedback from the Arbitrum team and community.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Y0wompF.png)\n\n### Domain Allocator Roles & Responsibilities:\n\nThe following will be the roles and responsibilities of the selected domain allocators.\n\n1. Time commitment per week: Maximum of 25 hours per week for the program manager and 15 hours per week for the domain allocator, which might vary based on the number of applications. The program manager will ensure that the workload is evenly distributed\n2. Program Manager:\n    1. Communication:\n        1. Work with the Arbitrum team and the elected domain allocators to create and list out the necessary RFPs\n        2. Identify key areas and relevant ecosystem partners who will co-fund grants alongside Arbitrum\n        3. Create marketing content for communicating RPFs to the builders\n        4. Coordinate between Arbitrum team and the community regarding cohort announcement and funding requirements\n        5. Communicate the information regarding approval/rejection of proposals to the Arbitrum community regularly\n        6. Attend community calls, actively participate in the community forum, and keep the community updated and take their feedback on the program\n        7. Regularly update the progress of the grants program to the Arbitrum community over Discord and community calls\n        8. Bi-weekly reporting of key metrics of the grants program and progress each selected project such as:\n        \n![](https://i.imgur.com/IAmytlJ.png)\n\n2.  Grants Program: \n  a. Source good-quality proposals from developer communities\n  b. Sign the transactions for the approved projects\n  c. Ensure a quick turnaround time for proposers regarding their proposal decision\n  d. Coordinate between the domain allocators to ensure that the workload is evenly    distributed and take their feedback consistently\n\n1. Domain Allocator:\n    1. Review proposals received for their domains based on the rubrics set by the domain allocator\n    2. Reject/Approve proposals and coordinate consistently with the program manager\n    3. Source applications by reaching out to developer communities in their network\n    4. Discuss program improvements with the other domain allocators and program manager during scheduled meetings.\n\n### **Compensation:**\n\nThe grant budget will be $1M with $200k for each domain. The committee compensation will be $200K for 4 domain allocators and one program manager for 6 months. Note that this is the proposed budget. All unused funds from every domain and committee compensation will be returned to the treasury. The compensation for Domain Allocators and Program Managers has been factored into this overall proposed budget. Please find below its details.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qz3RmPL.png)\n\n**P.S** \n\nWe are inviting applications for all domain allocator roles. Once this proposal passes through Tally, we will create a separate forum post for the nomination of domain allocators. Delegates and community members can self-nominate themselves under the post for two weeks. After the nomination period, a snapshot vote will be conducted. \n\n## **What does success look like?**\n\nObjective\n\n1. The prime objective of this model is to have domains that align with Arbitrum’s priorities. This way the contribution of the projects as part of the grants program is directly adding value to the DAO and the token holders.\n2. Increase in the number of builders, proposals, and funded projects\n3. Number of partners who are co-funding grants alongside Arbitrum in mutually beneficial areas\n4. Increase in the homegrown leadership to run grant programs (measured by the number of people running grant programs)\n5. Increase in the community members’ participation to keep grant programs accountable (measured by the number of people looking at the dashboard and participating in the program)\n6. Diversity in projects being funded across technologies, geographies, and demographics, to name a few. We encourage the community to regularly review the project domains during Arbitrum’s community call\n7. Increased engagement in builder community’sDiscourseDiscord, TelegramSocial media (Twitter, Reddit)GitHub\n\nSubjective\n\n1. Improved community involvement in the grants program\n2. Strengthened builders’ sentiment towards Arbitrum\n3. Enhanced Arbitrum’s brand recognition in builder circles\n\n## **About Questbook:**\n\nQuestbook’s role in Arbitrum’s Grant Program\n\n- Saurabh from Questbook will be the program manager. Thereafter, the program manager will be elected from the community. Saurabh was previously working very closely with the Program manager of Polygon, where he facilitated the disbursement of approximately $1 million in grants. Saurabh has received a grant from IoTeX to establish their grant program, and he works closely with the Program Manager of Compound Grants Program 2.0. Saurabh has spoken to more than 100 builders and teams over the last 6-8 months and understands what it takes to make a grant program successful - from both program manager and builder perspectives.\n- Questbook Grants tool will make sure the workflows are systematic and transparent.\n\n### Product Flows\n\n1.

      "title": "Proposal: Update Security Council Election Start Date to Ensure Time for Security Audit",
      "content": "Category: Constitutional - Process\n\nHigh Level Overview\nThe ArbitrumDAO Constitution specifies that the first Security Council election should start on the 15th September alongside a specification for the election.\n\nAn on-chain implementation of the entire election is still a work in progress. The Arbitrum Foundation has sponsored the implementation of a smart contract suite by Offchain Labs, an extension of Tally’s user interface, and the respective audits.\n\nThis proposal seeks to revise the ArbitrumDAO Constitution to provide flexibility for the start date of the election. If passed by a Constitutional Vote, the new start date will be on the 15th September or the earliest possible date in which an on-chain election can begin.\n\nThe motivation to change the election’s start date is to provide time for the implementation to be completed, security audits to be performed, for the community to gain confidence in the quality of its implementation and for the Arbitrum DAO to vote on a separate Constitutional AIP to install an on-chain election system.\n\nThe overarching goal is to still allow the election to begin on the 15th September, but it is prudent to provide leeway and ensure all parties, especially the Arbitrum DAO, are confident in the election software’s security and completeness.\n\nPath to a Smart Contract Enabled Election\nThis proposal seeks approval from the Arbitrum DAO that the first and all subsequent security elections should be performed via the on-chain election process.\n\nThe activation of the Security Council election is dependent on:\n\nComplete implementation for the on-chain smart contracts,\nComplete implementation of the user interface,\nSmart contract audit by a highly regarded auditing firm,\nAll parties, including the Arbitrum DAO, have gained confidence in the implementation’s completeness and security,\nSuccessful Constitutional Vote by the DAO to install the new election software.\nA vote on this proposal is approving that the above conditions are mandatory for any election software before it can be installed into the on-chain smart contracts.\n\nModified Start Date for Election\nThe implementation sponsored by the Arbitrum Foundation should be ready for the start date of the 15th September.\n\nEven so, given the naunces of implementation details and the potential security risks to a critical part of the system, we believe it is still prudent to provide leeway and extra time for the Security Council elections to begin some time after the required date set out by The Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nAfter all, it is not just about having a complete implementation, but ensuring all parties have confidence that all efforts have made been to minimize the risk of bugs in the implementation.\n\nRevision to ArbitrumDAO Constitution\nThe revised text focuses on the election beginning at the earliest possible date from the 15th September. Additionally, the election can only begin once an on-chain election system is installed via a separate Constitutional Vote.\n\nAll future elections can begin exactly six months after the previous election. As such, the chosen date for the first election will decide the earliest start date for the next election.\n\nFor extra clarity in the text, we have renamed “September Cohort” to “First Cohort” and “March Cohort” to “Second Cohort”\n\nFinally, to remove any ambiguity, all security council members are expected to serve the time until the new Security Council members are installed in the respective smart contracts.\n\nCurrent text of ArbitrumDAO Constitution:\nThe Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into a September Cohort of 6 members, and a March Cohort of 6 members. Every year on September 15, 12:00 UTC, an election starts for the 6 September Cohort seats; and every year on March 15, 12:00 UTC, an election starts for the 6 March Cohort seats.\n\nThis means that the initial September Cohort will serve an initial term of 6 months, whereas the initial March Cohort will serve an initial term of 1 year.\n\nThe initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the September Cohort and 6 members in the March Cohort. The members of the initial Security Council Cohorts are detailed in a transparency report here.\n\nProposed Revision of Arbitrum Constitution:\nThe Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into two Cohorts of 6 members.\n\nThe initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the ‘First Cohort’ and 6 members in the ‘Second Cohort’. The members of the initial Security Council Cohorts are detailed in a transparency report here.\n\nThe first security election is scheduled to begin on the 15th September 2023 or the earliest possible date. The election can only begin upon the availability of an on-chain election process that was approved and installed by the Arbitrum DAO. This first election replaces the ‘First Cohort’.\n\nThe date chosen for the first election will form the basis for all future elections. Every election will begin exactly 6 months after the previous election has finished and it will replace its respective cohort of 6 members.\n\nAll Security Council members are expected to serve their term until the election is complete and the new Security Council members are installed.",

      "title": "Accelerating Arbitrum - leveraging Camelot as an ecosystem hub to support native builders",
      "content": "**Non-Constitutional Proposal**\n\n**AUTHORS**\n[Iron Boots](https://twitter.com/SirBootsOfIron) (BD Lead), [Myrddin](https://twitter.com/0xmyrddin) (Dev Lead)\n\n...\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis post proposes granting 1.5M ARB per month to Camelot DAO for the next 6 months to fund liquidity incentives for Arbitrum-focused projects on Camelot, including the onboarding of new and multi-chain protocols entering the ecosystem. Camelot strives to support the native ecosystem through collaborative relationships and has a proven track record of allocating incentives to enable sustainable growth and long-term liquidity for ecosystem protocols. This proposal will therefore support deeper spot liquidity for Arbitrum native builders, as well as supporting integration partners and the launch of new protocols, thereby enabling significant growth through an approach that prioritizes Arbitrum’s core values. Most importantly, this will further the adoption of ARB as a base asset within liquidity pools and partner integrations.\n\n...\n\n## Motivation\n\nCamelot is not just a DEX - it’s the infrastructure that enables native protocols to build sustainable and efficient liquidity. As Arbitrum’s first major native DEX, Camelot strives to support the ecosystem with a long-term and collaborative approach that moves beyond the traditional role of DEXs as simple ‘yield farms’.\n\nIn just over 6 months of being live, Camelot has achieved over $2,500,000,000 total volume traded, highs of $100m TVL, and the successful onboarding of countless protocols to the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Round Table is the hub for Camelot’s official long-term partners, and the initial members consisted of the core Arbitrum protocols such as Vela, Jones, Pendle, Plutus, GMX, Sperax, and more. On average, Round Table partners have over 90% of their total DEX liquidity and volume on Camelot.\n\nSince then, the Round Table now consists of over 25 official partner protocols, and through its launchpad Camelot has supported over 9 protocols to raise funds in a community-focused and decentralized way. Most importantly, Camelot is home to numerous community builders that leverage the custom-built features to manage their liquidity, with a combined reach of over 40 native protocols present on Camelot and over 15 integrations being built on top of its infrastructure. Camelot is one of the most used dapps in the ecosystem, with over 300,000 unique users since launch. Camelot is not a fork, and is custom-built code that has been thoroughly tested and audited by Paladin. In addition, Camelot has no private investors and was launched in a truly community-focused and decentralized way. The ownership of Camelot has been spread through the key Arbitrum players, thereby making the protocol truly part of the ecosystem and community.\n\nThis grant would have a significant impact on the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem in several ways:\n\n* Deep spot liquidity is the foundation for DeFi protocols to thrive, enabling further innovation and use cases for Arbitrum native protocols. For example, deeper spot liquidity unlocks the potential for tokens to be used in lending markets, options and perps protocols, structured products, and much more. Whilst other DEXs also tackle this for blue chip tokens, Camelot is uniquely positioned to most effectively support the native ecosystem builders. This proposal will specifically focus on Arbitrum protocols throughout their lifecycle, whilst leveraging the network and community of Camelot to generate sustainable growth with real users. Deepening pools that already have significant liquidity is not our only focus, as Camelot is positioned to ensure the distribution of ARB tokens materializes into a stronger ecosystem. Most importantly, Camelot can work with partners to pair their tokens with ARB as a base asset. This will advance ARB as a foundational asset of the ecosystem, providing it with direct value and utility.\n\n* Camelot has a proven track record of effectively allocating rewards in a sustainable and economical way. Therefore, not only will this grant proposal deepen liquidity, it will also ensure that the most active and aligned builders on Arbitrum directly benefit from it too. As an ecosystem hub for native builders, Camelot will leverage this grant to support and incentivise new protocols launching in the ecosystem, further cementing Arbitrum’s position as the go-to layer 2 for innovation and DeFi. Through its launchpad and network of Round Table partners, Camelot additionally offers protocols marketing, BD, and general support.\n\n* In addition to liquidity, Camelot is one of the largest Arbitrum governance delegates and has continued to foster collaboration in the ecosystem. Therefore, this proposal would also focus on integration partners that enable more efficient liquidity management and further use cases. These protocols also build on top of our partner liquidity pools, therefore multiplying the network effects of the allocated Arb incentives. Camelot currently has over 15 integration partners, ranging from advanced liquidity management apps, leveraged yield farming, derivatives, structured products, and more.\n\n...\n\n## Rationale\n\nCamelot was conceived to help deliver Arbitrum’s goal of scaling and revolutionizing the future of Ethereum. Through its commitment to supporting native builders, Camelot strives to build the foundation of sustainable liquidity and collaboration that will allow Arbitrum and its diverse ecosystem to thrive.\n\nSince its inception in December 2022, Camelot has maintained a robust upward trajectory, steered by a long-term, sustainable incentives approach. We've avoided the common pitfalls of being a ‘yield-farm for mercenary capital,’ and our proven track record of allocating incentives effectively to yield maximum returns for our community, protocol, and ecosystem stands testament to our potential. We plan to harness the power of Arbitrum grant incentives to maintain this growth trajectory.\n\nThough past performance doesn't necessarily predict future success, it does offer valuable insights into the potential of this proposal. Over the period from December 2022 to May 2023, Camelot experienced an impressive average monthly increase in volume and Total Value Locked (TVL) of 275% and 79% respectively. Even more noteworthy is that during this period, Camelot generated over $10m in protocol fees, with a significant proportion of these channelled back to our token holders. This strongly suggests that, with the additional Arbitrum incentives, we can stimulate significant growth and capture substantial long-term value across a large number of native protocols. Moreover, we can achieve this while ensuring a decentralized and sustainable token ownership distribution. Camelot also received an airdrop of over 2,000,000 ARB, which has so far been fully dedicated to being an active governance participant.\n\nTo allocate the Arbitrum incentives even more effectively we will distribute it across 4 different categories: Ecosystem Builders, Integration Partners, Core Pairs, and Liquid Staking Derivatives.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreicjatrrpsk2u22lkmiqwklpmnk5jqkacc45odyf7npqib3hrgydse)    \n\n### Ecosystem Builders\n\nCamelot is home to many of Arbitrum’s favourite protocols, and this category will distribute incentives to builders that are fully aligned with Camelot’s approach to sustainable liquidity and long-term collaboration. As detailed in the ‘Specifications’ section below, Camelot is one of the most effective hubs to distribute incentives, due to the large and expansive network of long-term partners.\n\n### Integration Partners\n\nBy providing incentives to partners that are building on top of Camelot’s infrastructure, we are diversifying the use of incentives to fuel even further innovation and growth that benefits all partners and the broader ecosystem, whilst also deepening the underlying liquidity at the same time. These partners would include concentrated liquidity managers, leveraged yield protocols, lending markets, liquidity management dapps and more.\n\n### Core pairs\n\nWhilst Camelot’s primary focus is on the native Arbitrum builders, ensuring Camelot can offer deep liquidity for the most actively traded tokens like ETH and USDC is also important as the native DEX. With the number of protocols actively building on Camelot, deep liquidity for core pairs will be an important piece to ensure we have a strong foundation that can expand to longer-tail tokens too.\n\n### Liquid staked derivatives\n\nLiquid staked derivatives are seeing rapid growth as they unlock significant liquidity on Ethereum whilst securing the network at the same time. The majority of LSD liquidity is currently on Ethereum, and we think it’s an important catalyst for the broader Arbitrum ecosystem to support LSD adoption natively too. Deeper LSD liquidity will allow Arbitrum native builders to tap into a highly productive asset to build on top of, leading to further growth, utility, and products for the ecosystem.\n\n### Velodrome on Optimism as Precedent\n\nWhile Arbitrum is a unique ecosystem which is difficult to compare to other networks, the effect of Optimism’s grant to Velodrome in July of 2022 supports that a similar grant to Camelot could have a positive effect on the Arbitrum ecosystem. Velodrome received a 3M OP grant from the Optimism Foundation in July of 2022 that was meant to last 4-5 months. As seen in the visual below, Velodrome had around $14M in TVL, generated around $3.3k in weekly fees, and had $2M in daily volume before the grant. In the last 3 months, Camelot has averaged over $80M in TVL, $450,000 in weekly fees, and $18M in daily volume. While TVL and volume numbers can be skewed by low fee-generating mercenary TVL, fees paid are less biased, and Camelot has been earning over 100x more fees than Velodrome before incentives.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreidwm2wtosajdmpiqyryhwv3wvbrr634fp2zavgebk5z7jjl6igwdu)    \n\nCamelot has surpassed Velodrome by nearly every metric by using novel, long-term emission incentives. Thus, we’re asking for 1.5M ARB per month vs Velodrome’s 3M OP over 4-5 months. Because Camelot is currently in a much better position than pre-grant Velodrome, we expect that the ARB grant will increase liquidity depth on Camelot and the general ecosystem expansion even more, supercharging the network to a new level.\n\nTo provide additional perspective, the Arbitrum DAO treasury currently holds 3,527,046,084 ARB tokens. Assuming a hypothetical 10-year runway of treasury spending, this would be equivalent to 352m ARB tokens a year. Camelot’s grant proposal for a total of 9m ARB tokens would therefore represent 2.56% of the annual budget, with the expectation of significant ecosystem growth and expansion.\n\n***Camelot TVL, Volume and Fees before ARB Grant***\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiflwh7et2aybm4bhk2aunxtlloz6h3yxtxdd4gffgawyhajcno4l4)\n\n...\n\n## Specifications\n\nCamelot will distribute 1,500,000 ARB tokens per month as incentives across a broad range of Arbitrum liquidity pools and integrations. The distribution of these incentives will adhere to the Proposal Objectives, the proposal parameters, and the Transparency Report. \n\nThe transparency report will ensure that Camelot has clearly documented where every $ARB token has been allocated, the relevant growth metrics achieved, and most importantly the progress for its broader Arbitrum objectives. You can see the objectives and parameters below and a template of the transparency report attached. This report will be provided at the latest 72 hrs before the following month’s incentives are to be distributed.\n\n### Proposal Objectives\n*(As measured and tracked within the transparency report, attached below)*\n\n* To grow the liquidity of Arbitrum builders, bringing new users into the ecosystem and directly supporting the growth of ecosystem protocols\n* To use the incentives to bring new protocols into the Arbitrum ecosystem\n* To support the launch of native builders and their liquidity requirements\n* To advance the adoption of ARB as a base asset in liquidity pools\n* To advance the adoption of ARB within integration partner strategies\n* To provide marketing and community support to the ecosystem builders included in the incentive programme\n\n### Proposal Parameters\n*(As measured and tracked within the transparency report, attached below)*\n\n* Incentives will be distributed to a minimum of 30 partner pools, as documented in the transparency report. Any new pool or integration needs to be clearly documented beforehand in the transparency report.\n* No single pool or partner (excluding core $ARB pools) can receive more than 5% of the total incentives (as measured over a 30-day period)\n* No single pool or integration partner can receive more than 5% of its TVL in monthly incentives (as measured over a 30-day period)\n* A pool must maintain a minimum trading volume of $1,000,000 annualized to be valid to receive rewards (as measured over a 30-day period).\n* A minimum of 33% of the total incentives will be used on liquidity pools with $ARB as the base asset. On top of this minimum, Camelot will provide bonus incentives to teams that actively transition their liquidity to ARB as a base asset too. This will be included and measured within the aforementioned transparency report.\n* The partner integration section has now been merged into the “Ecosystem Builders” section, with the relevant parameters above being applicable.\n* If at any point the Arbitrum community or DAO is not satisfied with the performance or delivery, they can move forward with a governance vote to end the grant early.\n\nCamelot will distribute the incentives across the following categories and pools detailed below. The distribution across these various pools will adhere to the Proposal Objectives and parameters, please reference the transparency report for a more in-depth breakdown:\n\n[TRANSPARENCY REPORT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_os6yN7G2kdoeoXNotX0nqsYXQyJ0bakGXavmLNIXdc/edit?usp=sharing)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifbxdwctnf335rkwqpw7k5dejulbgc3wbcmjxew45pkxxttyamhrq)\n\n* Ecosystem Builders 75%\n  * Liquidity incentives for partner pools such as Vela, Pendle, Plutus, Jones and a diverse range of Arbitrum protocols. This will include integration partners that build on top of Camelot liquidity pools, such as Gamma and DeFi Edge, following the same parameters and guidelines shared above.\n  * The transparency report contains a broader breakdown of the ecosystem pools that this will be focused on. In addition, these incentives will be used to encourage the adoption of ARB as a base asset for ecosystem protocol liquidity pools.\n\n* Core Pairs 15%\n  * These represent the core liquidity pools such as ARB/ETH, ETH/USDC, and USDC/USDC. Further examples are included in the transparency report.\n\n* Liquid Staking Derivatives 10%\n  * Focusing on a diverse range of LSDs, most of which have little liquidity on Arbitrum. This will therefore target protocols such as unshETH, Lido, Rocket Pool, Swell, Stafi and more.\n\nCamelot will utilize its Nitro Pools technology to release the granted ARB in combination with $GRAIL and $xGRAIL emissions to liquidity providers. Nitro Pools are custom-built permissionless solutions to distribute incentives to any liquidity pool, with the ability to add custom requirements also. Along with the rest of the protocol, Nitro Pools have been audited by Paladin, and used by Camelot and numerous partners over the previous 8 months.\n\n\n...\n\n## Steps to implement\n\nCamelot will receive 1,5000,000 monthly over a period of 6 months, for a total of 9m ARB. In order to most transparently receive the tokens requested, Camelot will use a new multisig that will have several ecosystem players from other Arbitrum protocols. The makeup of this multisig, including the protocol affiliation(s) of each signer will be made public upon the creation of the multisig (before the proposal is moved to snapshot), and all changes to the makeup of the multisig will be announced in advance. This multisig will be governed by a multisig participation agreement wherein each signer will agree to use their signing authority only to further the interest of the wallet itself, using the ARB tokens to incentivise liquidity in approved nitro pools. By structuring the multi-sig with signers representative of the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, Camelot will ensure that the ARB tokens granted by the Arbitrum DAO will be leveraged to support new protocols, DAOs, and projects that are broadly value additive for Arbitrum.\n\nCamelot currently has [2,189,094 ARB tokens](https://debank.com/profile/0x03ff2d78afb69e0859ec6beb4cf107d3741e97ab) in its treasury, which it has used entirely for governance purposes. As an additional safeguard and sign of assurance, Camelot commits to placing its own ARB into the grant multisig for the duration of the 6 month proposal, therefore at any given time, Camelot will have “guaranteed” more ARB than it would receive from the Arbitrum DAO. Once the grant is over, Camelot will receive its own 2,189,094 ARB tokens back.\n\nOnce the ARB tokens have been distributed to the intended multisig wallet, Camelot will bear the full responsibility and workload to ensure the effective allocation of these tokens. Camelot will actively manage and continuously analyze the effectiveness of the incentives being used, following the aforementioned proposal objectives and parameters, and clearly documenting any changes or adjustments in the transparency report.\n\nMore information on the mechanics of Camelot’s nitro pools is available [here](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/nitro-pools). Once the ARB tokens have been distributed to the grant multisig, Camelot will then further distribute them to internal wallets where the tokens will be used as incentives for the pools and partner integrations mentioned above under ‘Specifications’.\n\n* Camelot will receive 1,500,000 ARB tokens per month for 6 months, which it will distribute in accordance to the proposal objectives and parameters.\n* Camelot will detail how every ARB token is allocated and the progress towards the proposal objectives within the [transparency report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_os6yN7G2kdoeoXNotX0nqsYXQyJ0bakGXavmLNIXdc/edit?usp=sharing).\n* The transparency report will be shared no later than 72 hours before the next month's incentives are distributed.\n* Camelot will hold a bi-weekly public community call to discuss the performance and progress of the grant and the transparency report in further detail.\n\n...\n\n## Timeline\n\nCamelot will begin the grant distribution from the date this proposal is passed and the ARB is delivered until 6 months after. The 1.5M ARB will be distributed monthly to the relevant ecosystem multisig mentioned above, for a total of 6 months.\n\nOnce the grant is active, Camelot will provide the subsequent transparency reports no later than 72 hours before the next month's incentives are to be distributed. The transparency report will follow the template that is attached and will include all relevant information. Following the conclusion of the grant, Camelot will provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance of the grant and its impact.\n\n...\n\n## Overall cost\n\n1,500,000 ARB distributed monthly over 6 months, for a total of 9M ARB tokens.",

      "title": "AIP-2: Activate support for account abstraction endpoint on One and Nova",
      "content": "**Title** \n\nProposal: Activate support for account abstraction endpoint on One and Nova\n\n**Author** \n\nJason Windawi, Alchemy\n\n**Type** \n\nThis is a Constitutional proposal.\n\n**Abstract** \n\nAs part of the broader development of account abstraction standards and tooling, Ethereum researchers have proposed a new RPC [endpoint](https://notes.ethereum.org/@yoav/SkaX2lS9j) `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` that adapts L2 sequencers to the specific needs of ERC-4337 bundlers. Offchain Labs has contributed to this new method by developing, testing and incorporating adjustments necessary to support the endpoint for Arbitrum’s sequencer into Nitro with v.2.0.14, which is now live on the Arbitrum testnet. This AIP proposes that the Arbitrum DAO activate support for this endpoint on the One and Nova mainnets.\n\n**Motivation** \n\n[EIP-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) has created significant momentum for account abstraction across the EVM ecosystem. Among other innovations, the proposal split validation and execution into distinct steps in the process of bundling transactions for submission to an alternative mempool. This split introduced a potential issue for bundlers working on their L2 transactions.The delay between simulated transaction validation by the bundlers, and the final inclusion by sequencers, introduces a risk for reverting bundle submissions. This is due to the lag between the initial submission of a transaction and its ultimate inclusion, during which a smart contract account’s storage can change and invalidate the transaction. Reverted bundle transactions result in lost value for the bundler, discouraging operation of these services until the issue is addressed.\n\nEthereum researchers [developed](https://notes.ethereum.org/@yoav/SkaX2lS9j) the `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` endpoint to address this issue. This endpoint adds new options to the standard eth_sendRawTransaction endpoint that allow users to specify valid ranges for block height and timestamps. This will allow sequencers to reject transactions that don’t meet conditions for inclusion during the earlier validation stage, addressing the risk that in-account storage might change between validation and execution.\n\nOffchain Labs developed, tested and implemented a version of the `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` endpoint in the v.2.0.14 [update](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases/tag/v2.0.14) to Nitro, and have since implemented the endpoint on the Arbitrum testnet. This proposal requests that the DAO approve activating this endpoint for Arbitrum mainnets.\n\n**Rationale** \n\nThis proposal directly supports the DAO’s constitutional value of maintaining alignment with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. The `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` endpoint was [developed](https://notes.ethereum.org/@yoav/SkaX2lS9j) by the Ethereum Foundation to address the proposal’s implications for layer 2 sequencers. Variations of this endpoint are being actively explored and developed by [prominent EVM L2s](https://blog.oplabs.co/erc-4337-and-account-abstraction/) [and others](https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor/pull/700) in the ecosystem, indicating that the need for this endpoint in the context of sequencer/bundler interactions is a known problem with the need for active work toward a solution.\n\nOur proposal is also aligned with the DAO’s objective of ensuring decisions are sustainable over the medium and long term. As Arbitrum continues to push toward [decentralization](https://arbitrumfoundation.medium.com/arbitrum-the-next-phase-of-decentralization-e7f8b37b5226) beyond Vitalik’s second [milestone](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571), the need for a flexible and secure endpoint for 4337-compliant transactions on Arbitrum will only become more critical.\n\nFinally, the proposal is aligned with the Arbitrum community’s values of social and technical inclusion. By enabling one of the core features of account abstraction, Arbitrum’s ecosystem would have access to the enormous potential for improvements in UX and other benefits of account abstraction.\n\n**Specifications** \n\nPR # [1474](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1474) on Github provides a history of the development and testing done by Offchain Labs, as well as the multiple stages of review by the team before it was merged on April 11, 2023. Making the endpoint viable for Arbitrum entailed two key adjustments to the checks performed before transactions reach the sequencer. The most fundamental was a config value change to the load balancer. The protocol’s load balancer has historically limited the computational costs of processing transactions by setting the number of acceptable slots in a transaction to zero. The new endpoint’s [design](https://notes.ethereum.org/@yoav/SkaX2lS9j) allows for up to 1,000 slots. To accommodate this increase for conditional transactions, PR 1474 removed this 0 restriction for Nitro and for the testnet.\n\nAllowing conditional transactions also introduces a risk of DOS attacks spamming the protocol with transactions regardless of whether they meet the state conditions at the time they were submitted. To address this, Labs updated the Arbitrum sequencer’s pre-check to incorporate a backward-looking validity check of a given account’s state, meaning that transactions can only execute if they met their own conditions as of one second prior to submitting the transaction.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\n\nThe work already done by Offchain Labs on this endpoint means that the steps to implement this AIP reduce to changing the load balancer config value as described above.\n\n**Timeline** \n\nIdeally ASAP, or as soon as is practical for Offchain Labs.\n\n**Overall Cost**\n\nThe upfront costs for implementation should effectively be zero given the work done already by Offchain Labs.\n\n",

      "content": "Proposer: disruptionjoe.eth\n\nAuthors: Plurality Labs\n\nReviewers: ccerv1.eth, emu.eth, dennison.eth, nich.eth, zer8🧠.eth, pepperonijoe.eth, shawn164.eth, azeemkhan.eth, jmcook.eth, boilerrat.eth, jord.eth, ui369.eth, spengrah.eth, griff.eth\n\n[A 7 min explainer](https://www.loom.com/share/2852597b76b74fec8ce6c6698fa73bd3)\n\n### TL;DR\nThis proposal requests 3.971 million ARB (0.08% of the total treasury) to fund the first of three milestones in a comprehensive plan to build an Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants Program.\n\nIf successful, the project will further establish Arbitrum as the go to scaling solution for Ethereum.\n\nMilestone 1 is the start of this journey with a funding request that breaks down as follows:\n1. 2.6 million ARB (72%): Funding Arbitrum ecosystem development\n2. 450k ARB (12.5%): Plurality Labs Services\n3. 260k ARB (7.2%): Grant Program Managers\n4. 300k ARB (8.3%): Matching Gitcoin funding pools using Arbitrum\n5. 361k ARB project buffer*\n\n*Representing 10% of funds requested. This will be used as a project buffer with funds either deployed in support of the program, recycled into ecosystem development or returned to Arbitrum DAO.\n\nSuccessful completion of these deliverables will be a major value driver for the Arbitrum ecosystem. This success of this program will be assessed through metrics including, but not limited to:\n\n* Number of active developers\n* Dev Github quality\n* Delegate engagement satisfaction\n* Voter participation\n* Capture-resistance\n\n### Deliverables\n\nAt the end of Milestone 1, Plurality Labs will have delivered:\n\n**Discover | Facilitate DAO native workshops**\n\n* Conduct Arbitrum DAO Vision, Mission, Values workshops\n* Clearly define funding priorities in a bottom-up way\n* Establish and confirm key success metrics for the Grants Program\n* Scope out requirements for a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum\n* Establish clear communications cadences & channels for all key stakeholders to engage with the program\n\n**Design | Construct best in class Pluralistic Grants Program**\n\n* Identify suitable tools and technology to support a robust, secure and efficient grants program (i.e. Allo)\n* Design and process map the end to end grant funding flows\n* Design approach, process and channels for sourcing high impact grants ideas\n* Design Grantee Registration process and grant pipeline management structure\n* Design Grant Program manager application process and assessment criteria\n* Work with Gitcoin to set up and launch a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum\n* Design credibly neutral grant funding evaluation criteria, reporting structure and cadence\n\n**Execute | Facilitate the successful execution of Pluralist Grants Programs**\n\n* Onboard and coach Pluralist Program Managers in grant program best practices\n* Deploy 2.6 million ARB in funding to programs selected via the Pluralist Program Managers\n* Deploy 300k ARB to Gitcoin Grants round recipients\n* Oversee grants rounds to ensure they are free from fraud or abuse\n\n**Evaluate | Report back on grant funding outcomes**\n\n* Publish financial & analytics reports on grant funding value, volume, outcomes and other relevant metrics requested by the community\n* Share key learnings and grants program best practices with Arbitrum DAO and the wider web3 community\n* Collate community feedback and input on grants programs efficacy and success\n* Evaluate, review and iterate based on this feedback to continually improve the overall impact of the Arbitrum DAO grants program\n\n### Motivation\n\nWe are here because Arbitrum intends to deploy one of the largest DAO treasuries ever to grow their ecosystem. A 10% difference in the allocation efficiency of funds could mean hundreds of millions of waste which would impede Arbitrum’s ability to actualize its full potential. It’s easy to say, “we can solve these problems later”, but we have an opportunity to start on the right track and solve these problems today\n\nThe Plurality Labs team has a chip on our shoulder. We have all been in DAOs and have seen how governance can fail, sometimes quickly, sometimes quietly. Our common thread is the shared values of trust, transparency and freedom combined with a passion for helping DAOs solve hard problems.\n\n### Issues with fully Centralized and Decentralized Grants Programs\n\nWithin web3 we have seen three main vehicles by which Grants Funding can be allocated to builders. Below we have outlined why we believe Arbitrum DAO should take a pluralist approach to grants funding.\n\n### Centralised Grants Program: Problems\n \n![0311b2837f5d19e1de6302c085e0eb8b800963cf_2_624x345.png](ipfs://bafkreidp5ob5oiuy77fqrklknkgy2jujbdeavyhhxyxptnaar7txya4ybu)\n    \n* Limited transparency and auditability: A centrally managed grants program may lack transparency in decision-making processes, grant distribution, and fund allocation. This opacity can undermine trust and hinder the overall effectiveness of the program\n* Limited community participation: Web3 communities thrive on active participation and collaboration. A centrally managed grants program may not effectively engage community members at all levels of the organization in the decision-making and codesign processes.\n* Domain expertise and scale: Volume of grants requests may overwhelm capacity of small centralized team who may also lack domain specific expertise on programs requesting funding\n* Bias and limited experimentation: Centralized Grants teams bring their standardized approach to grant vetting leading to a lack of experimentation which creates an inherent selection bias. The selection bias can even be non-malicious as they are biased by forces like being more likely to “open the door” for those who they know or have worked with before.h.\n\n### Decentralised Grants Program: Problems\n\n![b5cb3f790e8de949030775b29bba6030f6ef6421_2_624x287.png](ipfs://bafkreidqzewoyc2jyhr6a5mbqrcaml4cowvjqbp7bmtjgpzyfe2hqcwcbe)\n    \n* Lack of time: Delegates will stop engaging if the request is for more than is reasonable. Reviewing a grant, especially if it is a direct grant for larger amounts can be expected to take from 1-4 hours each. Delegates cannot take that much time.\n* Inclusion and accessibility: Navigating the delegates and governance process of a large DAO represents a major lift for any prospective grants applicants. Those able to do so will likely have the best network and most capital, not necessarily the best grants ideas…\n* Lack of coordination: With a decentralized grants program, decision-making and coordination are distributed among multiple stakeholders. This can lead to challenges in achieving consensus, coordinating efforts, and aligning priorities.\n* Evaluation of impact: It is challenging for the DAO to assess the relative impact of different grants programs if no standardized reporting cadence, key metrics and evaluation criteria is maintained centrally.\n* Mitigating risks and fraud: Decentralized grants programs are vulnerable to risks such as fraudulent proposals, mismanagement of funds, and malicious actors. Implementing mechanisms for due diligence, verification, reputation systems and Sybil defense can help mitigate these risks and protect the integrity of grants funding.\n* Not fully developed: Even solutions like quadratic funding which lets users directly express their interest still require a program manager. They must shepherd the round and ensure quality fraud protection while making objective decisions about eligibility criteria, user and project appeals, and more. Until we design the open and permissionless protocol to handle these subjective components, the model still has single points of failure.\n\n### Launching the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants program\n\nA Pluralist Grants program provides a perfect middle ground between Decentralized and Centralized Grants programs, unlocking the “best of both worlds.\n\nAt its core the Pluralistic Grants Model will see the Pluralistic Grants Program Allocator onboard 4-6 pluralist grants managers who will be responsible for distributing funds to grant applicants that benefits the Arbitrum Ecosystem. Sourcing and selection of these ideas will use novel combinations of bottoms-up and top-down mechanisms facilitated by Plurality Labs.\n\nThe programs will focus on specific needs within the ecosystem and their potential impact, for example, one Pluralist Grants Manager may focus on bringing a novel new technique for fund allocation or deep grants proposal expertise (i.e. Questbook). Another might stand up an Arbitrum gaming specific grants program. This flexibility allows for experimentation to allow Arbitrum DAO to discover what works best and allows for the specific needs of the Arbitrum ecosystem to be catered to.\n\nOur approach includes a progressive decentralization of the Pluralist Grants Program Allocator. During Milestone 1, Plurality Labs will maintain accountability for sourcing, selecting, reporting on and delivering results of the chosen pluralist grants programs.\n\nMilestones 2 & 3 will see experimentation with decentralized allocation mechanisms in a Proof of Concept stage with the goal of running at least one round of Pluralist Grants Program selection in a fully decentralized way without needing any corrective intervention.\n\n![0e9c91acb14f197ac0396d79f28b7f530aedfd36_2_624x363.png](ipfs://bafkreiaumlf7kbilxwrxnx7hixajjiz5pzbpr73ciybkkgdnbqsjefqzru)\n    \n> 💡The Pluralist Grants Programs will be selected after the proposal passes governance and the Discovery Phase is completed.\n\nDuring the discovery phase, we will gather input from delegates and the broader community to define the vision, mission, and values of the Arbitrum DAO, and determine what needs to be funded.\n\nOnce this foundation is established, we will evaluate the best domains and mechanisms for allocating resources and capital to grantees. Pluralistic Program managers will play a crucial role in promoting experimentation, decentralization of decisions, and improved resource allocation outcomes.\n\nWe have observed that many previous grants programs has struggled with an inability to source great grant opportunities, which we hope to address in the following ways:\n\n* Applications to be program managers should separate from the applications for grant program ideas\n* Create a backlog of “high impact work to be done” be created, allowing competent builders to step to deliver impact for Arbiturm DAO\n* Create a list of builders, potential grantees, and those interested in supporting the Arbitrum ecosystem which can be direct towards the “high impact work that needs to be done”\n* Robust evaluation and reporting facilitated by Plurality Labs reduce time/effort/reliance on Project Manager and Grantees to demonstrate their success to the community\n* Launch a Grant Program accelerator program to provide grantees clear guidelines, training and support to develop a high quality grant submissions\n\nThe selection of the Pluralist Grants Programs and their managers will involve a facilitated bottoms-up approach, sourcing ideas, people, and processes. Factors considered in the selection may include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Previous experience delivering grants programs.\n* Domain expertise and knowledge\n* Ability to source innovate grants projects and support in the maintenance of a health pipeline of grants submission\n* Maturity of program specific processes and tooling\n* Nature of proposed funding allocation mechanism and data on demonstrated impact/success of mechanism\n* Demonstrated involvement with and commitment to Arbitrum ecosystem and its values\n\nThis is an exhaustive list, and the criteria for selecting Program Managers will be further refined in the Discovery and Design phase, with input from delegates and the broader community. We are committed to maintaining credible neutrality in the selection process.\n\nWith this approach we are confident that the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants Program will be fair, impactful and ultimately support the growth and success of the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n### The Pluralistic Grants model also provides 300k ARB to support matching Gitcoin rounds which run on Arbitrum.\n\nThis is not payment to Gitcoin the organization, but a payment to grant recipients in a Gitcoin Arbitrum round we intend to launch. Gitcoin core rounds include support for Open Source Software, Ethereum Infrastructure, & Zero Knowledge. This aligns with the stated Arbitrum goal of supporting the Ethereum ecosystem while also attracting users which might otherwise choose another L2. It also allows us to tap into support of the Gitcoin DevRel team to help source builders, host hackathons.\n\nFunding grants this way will not only benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem, but enable the Gitcoin product team to prioritize making their Allo protocol available on Arbitrum. By being able to execute pluralistic programs on their Allo protocol allows us an open data substrate which will enable us to compare programs and projects across the pluralist framework. It also allows program managers to use quadratic funding and quadratic voting (if they choose) which require Sybil defense. This is a crucial enabler for the next section.\n\n![88d617338384427ed53607b929264bc8b623ef43_2_624x281.png](ipfs://bafkreiaylf4ugerhg5c755rx2ffjydpjcri6sx7mohjrafoiuylihkijfy)\n    \n### Improved Accountability, Transparency and Reporting are key benefits of the Pluralistic Grants model.\n\nWeb3 spends 100’s of millions annually on different grants and grants programs and to date, there has been little focus on the efficiency of those grant programs or the efficacy of their spend. We intend to build grant program efficiency metrics as well specific grantee project efficacy (or results) metrics.\n\nBy using a common framework for executing a plurality of grant programs, we have the ability to identify, track and refine metrics for each unique grant program. Something that has not been done to date, and would be more difficult to do in stand alone grant environments.\n\nBy doing this, we can begin to build qualitative data on the efficiency of each distribution method in a way that can identify improvements for that mechanism, but also compare mechanisms across stakeholder groups and use cases. By building these metrics, Arbitrum will be able to parse down the crowded field of grant-execution options and deliver the most effective Grants Program web3 has seen to date.\n\nGrant program execution typically stops when the money has been distributed, and we think that is premature. As part of this program we intend to experiment with a series of existing post-project evaluation tools (after action reviews, qualitative/quantitative metrics, case studies) but add in or invent novel web3 project evaluation solutions (hypercerts, on-chain analysis, panel reviews) to rate every project receiving funding in a way that can demonstrate the efficacy of the spending as it relates to building the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nWe know there are inefficiencies and fraud in the web3 grant mechanisms; this part of the program allows Arbitrum to make the most of its investments. Doing this will lead to a higher return on the Arbitrum investment and more funding for the most worthy projects, while leaving room to experiment with the novel web3 mechanism that can help us revolutionize the grant process.\n\n### Multisig Management\n\nAll funds will be sent to a Grants Safety Multisig*. This multisig will review, sign and execute all fund disbursement for the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants program. The role of the grants multisig is to process the requests made by Plurality Labs while also being able to review issues. At no point will Plurality Labs hold the funds designated for grant funding. The final form of this proposal will either name the selected individual or state the electoral process.\n\n> 💡 We also intend to use the Zodiac module shared by the Tally team allowing the DAO the ability to clawback funds from the grants program at any time.\n\n### Team\n\nPlurality Labs Team\n\n**Disruption Joe**\n\nRan grants operations for Gitcoin Grants rounds 8-10 growing gross marketplace value from $2 - $10 million.

In August 2022, he joined Gitcoin where he currently leads governance\n\n### Looking Ahead: Milestone 2 & 3\n\nThe overall plan is to deploy a pluralist grants framework which operates in a politically decentralized & capture resistant way. This will fund grants programs in a continuous way that minimizes bureaucracy and increases action while providing accountability as part of the system.\n\nPrior to releasing funds for milestone 2 to begin, Plurality Labs will offer a review of the previous milestone accomplishments and failures. They will provide a breakdown at that time based on how this project evolves.\n\nMilestones 2 & 3 are about scaling the frameworks and models we use while iteratively testing them. After Milestone 3, we hope to have built the needed components for this whole process to run on chain.\n\nIf successful, Plurality Labs would no longer be needed as a project manager of the overall grants program. Onchain decisions of the community would allocate funding to the programs which have been proven useful. Plurality labs could then be an equal peer to any other program competing for a portion of continuous funding available to the ecosystem.\n\n### Voting Options\n\n1.

      "title": "Arbitrum DAO Grants - Delegated Domain Allocation by Questbook",
      "content": "Author\nSaurabh, Questbook \n\nType \n**Non-Constitutional**\n\n### **Abstract**\n\n- We propose Arbitrum DAO to launch Arbitrum grants program with a budget of $1M spread across 2 quarters to fund a *wide variety* of teams building apps on top of Arbitrum in a transparent manner. Questbook is leading [Compound](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136) grants program through [delegated domain capital allocation model](https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/) , a community-run grants program.\n- We additionally propose that this budget be managed by **4** **individuals called Domain Allocators - chosen from the community and by the community**. These domain allocators would manage grants for a *domain*. These domains are strategic areas of focus for which Arbitrum wants to disburse grants\n- The performance of each of these *domain allocators* will be publicly viewable and auditable using rich dashboards. At the end of the quarter, the Arbitrum community can vote to replace, continue domain allocators or increase budgets for each *domain allocator.*\n- We ([Questbook.xyz](https://questbook.xyz/) ) **will help facilitate setting up these *domain allocators* and provide the tooling to run the grants program in an efficient and transparent way**. We have previously set up or currently setting up the grants process for Compound, Polygon, Solana, Celo, and Aave.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nAs we continue to experience the depth of the bear market, it is increasingly important for Arbitrum to retain the mindshare of key ecosystem contributors and incentivize builders to build on top of it. Grants program is a great way to attract high-quality builders and grow the ecosystem more quickly. This proposal details the benefit to all the stakeholders involved - token holders, builders and DAO members\n### **Rationale** **(Benefits to Arbitrum)**\n\nThe proposed structure will lead to the following outcomes:\n\n1. **Aligned allocation of funds:** By leveraging the Delegated Domain Allocator (DDA) model, Arbitrum DAO can ensure that funds are allocated to projects that align with the domain (selected by the Arbitrum community), promoting efficient and effective use of resources. This approach aligns with Arbitrum’s goal of enabling the distribution of grants and empower the community to build and participate in the future of the Arbitrum.\n2. **Increased transparency:** The Delegated Domain Allocator approach provides a clear and transparent process for allocating funds, ensuring stakeholders understand the decision-making process and building community confidence. Questbook, a decentralized grant management platform, provides a transparent space for teams to showcase their backgrounds and experience. In addition, Questbook’s reporting features will allow Arbitrum to quickly generate monthly reports on the allocation of funds, with the details for each grant proposal.\n3. **Increased accountability:** With a dedicated group of stakeholders responsible for allocating funds, the Delegated Domain Allocator approach promotes increased accountability, ensuring that the funds are used effectively and efficiently. Domain allocators can be replaced through a community vote if their performance is not up to the standards accepted by the community.\n4. **Lower** **Turnaround Time (TAT):** The Delegated Domain Capital Allocation model will help improve proposals’ turnaround time and overall outcomes for the ecosystem. **An example of this is Compound who’s already leveraging the DDA model and has a communication TAT of less than 48 hours.** The performance of domain allocators will be measured using objectives and key results (OKRs) to ensure goals are achieved efficiently and effectively.\n5. **Strong Brand Recognition** : The Delegated Domain Allocator model will play a crucial role in boosting developer engagement with Arbitrum, as well as forming strategic partnerships with important ecosystems to jointly fund grants in mutually beneficial areas. \n\n### **Specifications**\n\nThe program structure focuses on having community members as domain allocators. Arbitrum DAO will be required to set a budget of $1M to be disbursed by 4 domain allocators and for committee compensation. Each domain allocator will be elected by the community. Interested community members can self-nominate themselves to be considered for becoming a domain allocator. The domain allocator for each domain will be selected via a community-wide Snapshot vote. Domain allocators will run their domain on-chain for full transparency. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible to the community in order to evaluate the domain allocator’s performance.\n\n### **Steps to Implement**\n\n**Arbitrum Grants Committee**\n\nThe program will consist of\n\n1. A Program Manager\n2. 4 Domain Allocators\n\n \n![1.1.png](ipfs://bafkreicew52tsgud3subrurhrv6jud3zyep743fpgfiv4yzw54nnty423m)\n    \n\nWe propose  [Tally’s Zodiac Governor Module](https://docs.tally.xyz/user-guides/using-governor-with-gnosis-safe/zodiac-governor-module-for-subdaos-and-grants-programs) for security purposes. Furthermore, a Grants SAFE with 4/6 multi-sig will be set up between the program manager and 4 domain allocators. We will then have 4 SAFEs for each of the domains with a 3/3 multi-sig setup between the program manager, the specific domain allocator, and one member from the DAO.\n\nWe have identified the following domains based on our thorough research and the feedback from the Arbitrum team and community.\n\n![1.2.png](ipfs://bafkreifk7yaqw2lvwj35tx2rumagctyd3of6nd2bh3fawsiij74bmdlyv4)\n\n## Domain Allocator Roles & Responsibilities:\n\nThe following will be the roles and responsibilities of the selected domain allocators.\n\n1. Time commitment per week: Maximum of 25 hours per week for the program manager and 15 hours per week for the domain allocator, which might vary based on the number of applications. The program manager will ensure that the workload is evenly distributed\n2. Program Manager:\n    1. Communication:\n        1. Work with the Arbitrum team and the elected domain allocators to create and list out the necessary RFPs\n        2. Identify key areas and relevant ecosystem partners who will co-fund grants alongside Arbitrum\n        3. Create marketing content for communicating RPFs to the builders\n        4. Coordinate between Arbitrum team and the community regarding cohort announcement and funding requirements\n        5. Communicate the information regarding approval/rejection of proposals to the Arbitrum community regularly\n        6. Attend community calls, actively participate in the community forum, and keep the community updated and take their feedback on the program\n        7. Regularly update the progress of the grants program to the Arbitrum community over Discord and community calls\n        8. Bi-weekly reporting of key metrics of the grants program and progress each selected project such as:\n  \n \n![13a.png](ipfs://bafybeihd4opx3atmhvarhrd5t6edpmpyfi4m6ptblpl4siihpqip5qh2wu)\n    \n    \n\n2. Grants Program: \na. Source good-quality proposals from developer communities\nb. Sign the transactions for the approved projects\nc. Ensure a quick turnaround time for proposers regarding their proposal decision\nd. Coordinate between the domain allocators to ensure that the workload is evenly distributed and take their feedback consistently\n\n3. Domain Allocator:\n    1. Review proposals received for their domains based on the rubrics set by the domain allocator\n    2. Reject/Approve proposals and coordinate consistently with the program manager\n    3. Source applications by reaching out to developer communities in their network\n    4. Discuss program improvements with the other domain allocators and program manager during scheduled meetings.\n\n### **Compensation:**\n\nThe grant budget will be $1M with $200k for each domain. The committee compensation will be $200K for 4 domain allocators and one program manager for 6 months. Note that this is the proposed budget. All unallocated funds from every domain and committee compensation will be returned to the treasury. The compensation for Domain Allocators and Program Managers has been factored into this overall proposed budget. Please find below its details.\n \n![14aaa.png](ipfs://bafybeig7zsa7e7vdk7zdnmspuq4z6ciajxorckhiy3ckpro4xfcv6ycheq)\n    \nP.S\n\n1. We are inviting applications for all domain allocator roles. Once this proposal passes through Snapshot, we will create a separate forum post for the nomination of domain allocators. Delegates and community members can self-nominate themselves under the post for two weeks. After the nomination period, a snapshot vote will be conducted.\n\n## **What does success look like?**\n\nObjective\n1. The prime objective of this model is to have domains that align with Arbitrum’s priorities. This way the contribution of the projects as part of the grants program is directly adding value to the DAO and the token holders.\n2. Increase in the number of builders, proposals, and funded projects\n3. Number of partners who are co-funding grants alongside Arbitrum in mutually beneficial areas\n4. Increase in the homegrown leadership to run grant programs (measured by the number of people running grant programs)\n5. Increase in the community members’ participation to keep grant programs accountable (measured by the number of people looking at the dashboard and participating in the program)\n6. Diversity in projects being funded across technologies, geographies, and demographics, to name a few.

      "title": "Proposal: Activate support for account abstraction endpoint on One and Nova",
      "content": "Author\nJason Windawi, Alchemy\n\nType\nThis is a Constitutional proposal.\n\nAbstract\nAs part of the broader development of account abstraction standards and tooling, Ethereum researchers have proposed a new RPC endpoint eth_sendRawTransactionConditional that adapts L2 sequencers to the specific needs of ERC-4337 bundlers. Offchain Labs has contributed to this new method by developing, testing and incorporating adjustments necessary to support the endpoint for Arbitrum’s sequencer into Nitro with v.2.0.14, which is now live on the Arbitrum testnet. This AIP proposes that the Arbitrum DAO activate support for this endpoint on the One and Nova mainnets.\n\nMotivation\nEIP-4337 has created significant momentum for account abstraction across the EVM ecosystem. Among other innovations, the proposal split validation and execution into distinct steps in the process of bundling transactions for submission to an alternative mempool. This split introduced a potential issue for bundlers working on their L2 transactions. The delay between simulated transaction validation by the bundlers, and the final inclusion by sequencers, introduces a risk for reverting bundle submissions. This is due to the lag between the initial submission of a transaction and its ultimate inclusion, during which a smart contract account’s storage can change and invalidate the transaction. Reverted bundle transactions result in lost value for the bundler, discouraging operation of these services until the issue is addressed.\n\nEthereum researchers developed the eth_sendRawTransactionConditional endpoint to address this issue. This endpoint adds new options to the standard eth_sendRawTransaction endpoint that allow users to specify valid ranges for block height and timestamps. This will allow sequencers to reject transactions that don’t meet conditions for inclusion during the earlier validation stage, addressing the risk that in-account storage might change between validation and execution.\n\nOffchain Labs developed, tested and implemented a version of the eth_sendRawTransactionConditional endpoint in the v.2.0.14 update to Nitro, and have since implemented the endpoint on the Arbitrum testnet. This proposal requests that the DAO approve activating this endpoint for Arbitrum mainnets.\n\nRationale\nThis proposal directly supports the DAO’s constitutional value of maintaining alignment with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. The eth_sendRawTransactionConditional endpoint was developed by the Ethereum Foundation to address the proposal’s implications for layer 2 sequencers. Variations of this endpoint are being actively explored and developed by prominent EVM L2s and others in the ecosystem, indicating that the need for this endpoint in the context of sequencer/bundler interactions is a known problem with the need for active work toward a solution.\n\nOur proposal is also aligned with the DAO’s objective of ensuring decisions are sustainable over the medium and long term. As Arbitrum continues to push toward decentralization beyond Vitalik’s second milestone, the need for a flexible and secure endpoint for 4337-compliant transactions on Arbitrum will only become more critical.\n\nFinally, the proposal is aligned with the Arbitrum community’s values of social and technical inclusion. By enabling one of the core features of account abstraction, Arbitrum’s ecosystem would have access to the enormous potential for improvements in UX and other benefits of account abstraction.\n\nSpecifications\nPR # 1474 on Github provides a history of the development and testing done by Offchain Labs, as well as the multiple stages of review by the team before it was merged on April 11, 2023. Making the endpoint viable for Arbitrum entailed two key adjustments to the checks performed before transactions reach the sequencer. The most fundamental was a config value change to the load balancer. The protocol’s load balancer has historically limited the computational costs of processing transactions by setting the number of acceptable slots in a transaction to zero. The new endpoint’s design allows for up to 1,000 slots. To accommodate this increase for conditional transactions, PR 1474 removed this 0 restriction for Nitro and for the testnet.\n\nAllowing conditional transactions also introduces a risk of DOS attacks spamming the protocol with transactions regardless of whether they meet the state conditions at the time they were submitted. To address this, Labs updated the Arbitrum sequencer’s pre-check to incorporate a backward-looking validity check of a given account’s state, meaning that transactions can only execute if they met their own conditions as of one second prior to submitting the transaction.\n\nSteps to Implement\nThe work already done by Offchain Labs on this endpoint means that the steps to implement this AIP reduce to changing the load balancer config value as described above.\n\nTimeline\nIdeally ASAP, or as soon as is practical for Offchain Labs.\n\nOverall Cost\nThe upfront costs for implementation should effectively be zero given the work done already by Offchain Labs.",

      "title": "AIP-1.1 - Lockup, Budget, Transparency [UPDATED]",
      "content": "## ATTENTION:\n\nThis is an updated version of a similar proposal that has been put up for a vote a day prior to this one. We have discovered that the target vesting contract in the previous proposal had an incorrect \"start\" date. A more detailed explanation is provided below. Please do not vote on the other proposal and vote on this proposal instead.\n\n### What happened?\n\nThe way this proposal works is that there is a special AIP smart contract (AIP1Point1Target) that references the location of the vesting vault for the Foundation Administrative Budget Wallet. The on-chain action that the proposal is executing is changing of the “passed” parameter on this AIP smart contract from false to true, documenting DAOs approval for the Foundation to use this referenced vesting vault, after the vote the Foundation will move 700M ARB tokens that are subject of AIP 1.1 to this contract and will be able to retrieve the vested amount to the Foundation’s multisig. \n\nOne parameter of this setup is a “start” timestamp, which determines the point in time from which the vesting schedule is being calculated. According to the text of AIP-1.1: “…ARB tokens in the “Administrative Budget Wallet” will be subject to a four year lockup schedule, unlocking on a continuous linear time basis commencing from the date of the Snapshot approval of AIP-1.1 by the DAO…”. So this timestamp should be set to 1681754400, which translates to Monday, 17 April 2023 18:00:00 GMT, the date of the Snapshot approval. However, in the vesting contract that was subject to the original vote, it has been wrongly set to the date of the ARB Airdrop (1679590871, which translates to Thursday, 23 March 2023 17:01:11 GMT). This means that the smart contract configuration did not reflect the text of the AIP and would result in the effective unlocked vested amount being too large.\n\n### Resolution\n\nSince we cannot cancel the vote at this point (it could be canceled by the Security Council, but only after the vote has passed), after thorough discussion, we have decided to create a new proposal with the correct smart contracts that are referenced in the vote. We recommend that the DAO ignore the other AIP-1.1 vote, and instead vote on this one.\n\nIf you’d like to check the parameters are set correctly this time, you can check (for example using Arbiscan) the AIP smart contract referenced by this vote: [https://arbiscan.io/address/0x9E43f733Da0445b35f038FB34a6Fb8C2947B984C#code](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/79904733039853333959339953965823982558487956291458141923259498272549038367575). In the Contract tab you can go to the Read contract sub-tab and check that the arbitrumFoundationWallet parameter references smart contract at [0x15533b77981cda0f85c4f9a485237df4285d6844](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x15533b77981cda0f85c4f9a485237df4285d6844), which is the vesting vault. You can now go to this smart contract and, again, go to the Contract tab, and Read as Proxy sub-tab to see that the “start” parameter is set correctly to 1681754400. \n\nWe hope that this resolution will cause as little confusion as possible among delegates. We plan to publish \"lessons learned\" from this case at a later date to elaborate on this case and suggest certain procedures to be implemented in the future to minimize the chances of such mistakes happening again. \n\n\n***\n\n\nCategory: Non-constitutional\n\n### Abstract\n\ntl;dr: AIP-1.1 proposes (1) a lockup, (2) a budget and (3) transparency reporting regarding the 7.5% of the $ARB tokens distributed to the Foundation’s “Administrative Budget Wallet”.\n\nThe Administrative Budget Wallet will be used for covering ongoing administrative and operational costs of The Arbitrum Foundation, payment of service providers, and for the purpose of fostering the growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. In respect to the 7.5% that has been distributed to the Administrative Budget Wallet, a transparency report regarding the 0.5% that has already been transferred is available here 163.\n\nThe remaining 7% of tokens will not be used until the approval of a budget, such as the one proposed in this AIP. The proposed budget is in-line with the Foundation’s strategic needs to represent and service the DAO and the allocation is smaller than initial allocations to peer foundations. This AIP proposes placing the 7% outstanding distribution in a smart contract-controlled lockup – linearly unlocking over 4 years – alongside transparency report structures to allow the DAO to periodically monitor expenditures and other activities of the Foundation.\n\nThe Administrative Budget Wallet will be used in pursuit of the Foundation’s mission statement as set out in the bylaws 24, which includes financing technical improvements and operations of the Arbitrum network, fostering ecosystem growth through grants to align with partner projects and educational initiatives with in-person and online events.\n\n### Motivation\n\nOn March 16, 2023, the Arbitrum networks (Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova) were decentralized and given to the newly formed Arbitrum DAO. Included in this transition were:\n\n- Control of the upgradeability and technical future of the chains\n- Control over the DAO treasury\n- Control over net fee revenue - i.e. the net difference between fees collected by on-chain operations and L1 fees paid by the Sequencer\n- All Arbitrum social media platforms and accounts\n- Ability to elect and, if deemed appropriate, remove the Security Council and Directors\n\nFull responsibility of the chain’s technology, future, and fee revenue were given to the DAO directly. With the DAO assuming those rights and controls, the DAO also assumed the responsibility to fund the ongoing operations of the chains and the costs of running critical chain infrastructure, including RPCs, the Sequencer, and third-party vendors and service contracts.\n\nWhile there are many activities that the DAO can do directly on-chain, several of its responsibilities require a representative that can engage, maintain and enter new agreements with service providers to run infrastructure that’s critical for the ecosystem (e.g. servers, RPCs, block explorers, data feeds and analytics platforms, and tooling), and ensure that both the chain and the ecosystem have the support they need to continue to thrive. In order to ensure a smooth transition to the DAO without any interruption of services, it was necessary to create an organization that would be ready to service the DAO immediately from launch.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation was created to fill this need, with its mission and scope outlined across the Foundation Bylaws 24. Prior to the launching of the DAO, The Arbitrum Foundation assumed responsibilities for funding and running chain infrastructure. However, in an arrangement that appears to be unique amongst Arbitrum’s peers, the Foundation does not receive or control the net revenue from transaction fees as this is given directly to the DAO treasury.\n\nThe DAO is also tasked with fostering and developing the Arbitrum ecosystem, where the DAO may seek to partner with companies or organizations that either cannot or will not publicly negotiate collaborations or partnerships due to confidentiality and other operational requirements. Often, large enterprises negotiate partnership opportunities in private without public processes, where these relationships can only be disclosed after they are agreed upon. Having a well-funded Foundation empowered to represent the DAO in this arena, alongside peer foundations, is in the best interests of the DAO to further develop the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n### Rationale\nWhile the need for the Foundation to exist and represent the DAO is well-motivated, it became clear through community discourse around AIP-1 that it was important to have additional insight and restrictions on the Foundation’s initial funding. This AIP-1.1 proposes a detailed set of controls and initiatives to achieve that goal.\n\n1. Smart Contract Lockup:\n\nThe remaining 7% of ARB tokens in the “Administrative Budget Wallet” will be subject to a four year lockup schedule, unlocking on a continuous linear time basis commencing from the date of the Snapshot approval of AIP-1.1 by the DAO (i.e., a total of 175m $ARB released over each year for 4 years). The lockup will be enforced on-chain through a smart contract which will designate a multisig wallet controlled by The Arbitrum Foundation as the beneficiary. The lockup contract will be configured in a manner that allows the DAO to adjust future funding and/or modify the unlock schedule.\n\n2. Operating Budget:\n\nBelow is a proposed annual operational budget for the first year of the Foundation. While the operational costs are denominated in USD, the expectation is that approximately half will be paid in USD and half will be paid in locked $ARB tokens.\n\nAs this will be the first year of the Foundation’s operation and as the Foundation is still young at the time of this AIP, it goes without saying that these are estimates with the expectation that this will be an upper bound on the operational costs for the first 12 months. The transparency reports described in the next section will be an opportunity to track the actual expenses against the budgeted categories and keep the community informed.\n\n- Operating Budget: Cost ($USD)\n- General and Administrative: $16,000,000\n- R&D: $9,000,000\n- Technical Infrastructure: $5,000,000\n- Events, Marketing & Communications: $6,000,000\n- Total - Next Twelve Months: $36,000,000\n- (50% $USD/50% $ARB)\n\n*The General and Administrative line-item includes personnel, contractors, legal, insurance and other operational costs. As of the date of this AIP, the Foundation currently has five full-time contributors, 8 contractors, and the Security Council engaged to support the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Foundation’s budget anticipates the need to hire an additional 15 full-time contributors across technical, growth and community functions over the course of this year.\n\nThis operating budget presents best-faith estimates of the Foundation’s anticipated budgetary needs which may be subject to change.\n\n3. Ecosystem Growth Initiatives\n\nAny additional funds released in compliance with the lock-up schedule above will be made available, but not necessarily deployed, to opportunistically pursue ecosystem growth opportunities and strategic partnerships on behalf of the DAO. The expectation is that the vast majority of ecosystem growth funds will be paid in tokens, and thus will not require the Foundation to sell any tokens. Wherever reasonable, the Foundation will include additional lockups and/or vesting when making distributions in tokens.\n\nThe Mission Statement in the Foundation’s bylaws 24 highlights the varied nature of the opportunities the Foundation intends to pursue, and a set of KPIs that can track all of these opportunities being developed. The basis of those KPIs will stem from a focus on onboarding and growing both the developer and user base of the Arbitrum ecosystem, attracting best-in-class infrastructure providers to the network, expanding across various industries, use-cases and scope of projects that engage with Arbitrum technology. The ultimate goal of the Foundation is to continue to foster the development of the technology and expand the Arbitrum ecosystem globally.\n\nIn addition to the Foundation’s processes for selecting grants, it is important to note that the DAO maintains control over the 3.527 billion $ARB and has the ability to distribute any additional grants as it sees fit. Additionally, should the DAO choose, it has the ability to trigger the inflation of the total supply of $ARB which will supplement the on-chain DAO treasury with 2% growth of the total supply of $ARB each year.\n\n4. Transparency Reports\n\nThe Foundation understands and agrees that the community should have oversight across how these funds are being utilized to gain comfort that spending is in the interest of the community. In furtherance of this goal, the Foundation is committed to providing a comprehensive annual report and a semi-annual progress update. This will provide the community with a better understanding of the Foundation’s expenditures, balance sheet and its pursuit of ecosystem growth opportunities alongside partnership developments, as well as the various internal and external committees and stakeholders that are involved in the decision making process.\n\nThe Foundation is continuing to build out its internal personnel to service grant requests and has already engaged a DAO service provider to assist with the administrative components of servicing grants. The Foundation is also talking with a number of different external service providers to assist in both the review and diligence processes.\n\nThe financial element of these transparency reports will include a breakdown of operational costs incurred while running the Foundation, including infrastructure spending for the Arbitrum chains, events, community building efforts, grants, etc.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned reports, the Foundation is providing an initial transparency report alongside this AIP covering all major actions and decisions the Foundation made during set-up, including the costs incurred up until now, which can be found [here](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/foundational-documents/transparency-report-initial-foundation-setup).\n\n### Links:\n\nPrevious version of this proposal with misconfiguration issue: [https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/79904733039853333959339953965823982558487956291458141923259498272549038367575](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/79904733039853333959339953965823982558487956291458141923259498272549038367575)\n\nSnapshot temperature check: [https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x7203289844e807781e8d2ec110d4b97a79a29944cae06a52dbe315a16381a2ae](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x7203289844e807781e8d2ec110d4b97a79a29944cae06a52dbe315a16381a2ae)\n\nGitHub PR: [https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/44](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/44)\n\nForum discussion thread: [https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-aip-1-1-lockup-budget-transparency/13360/1](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-aip-1-1-lockup-budget-transparency/13360/1)",

      "content": "Category: Constitutional - Process\n\n## Abstract:\nThis document (“AIP-1.2”) proposes amendments to the Constitution, and The Arbitrum Foundation Amended & Restated Memorandum & Articles of Association (the “A&R M&A”) and Bylaws (the “Bylaws”) to (1) remove references to AIP-1, and (2) make other changes reflecting feedback from the community.\n\n## Motivation:\nAIP-1 set out critical aspects of governance and included key governance documents for the ArbitrumDAO, and The Arbitrum Foundation which referenced AIP-1 throughout: the ArbitrumDAO Constitution (the “Constitution”), the Bylaws and the A&R M&A. However, after vigorous community debate, AIP-1 did not pass.\n\n## Rationale:\nThe Constitution is a foundational document that lays out the governance system and capabilities of the ArbitrumDAO; the Bylaws and A&R M&A outline The Arbitrum Foundation’s relationship with and obligations to the ArbitrumDAO. These documents should be updated, via amendment, to remove references to AIP-1 and also to reflect other changes requested by the community during the debate process over AIP-1.\n\n## Specifications:\n\n1. Amendments to the Constitution ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pIYxg9rJzIPcP0bvQAaPgmLITM9rVBIf/view?usp=share_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pIYxg9rJzIPcP0bvQAaPgmLITM9rVBIf/view?usp=share_link))\n- Remove references to AIP-1, except as reference to the moment the original Constitution became effective.\n- Make explicit that proposals to amend The Arbitrum Foundation’s A&R M&A and Bylaws take the form of a Constitutional AIP.\n- Make explicit that the DAO may make a Non-Constitutional Funding AIP with respect to the Administrative Budget Wallet.\n- Lower the threshold number of Votable Tokens required for an AIP to be posted on-chain from 5,000,000 $ARB to 1,000,000 $ARB.\n- Add a new Section 5, which details the Data Availability Committee, including processes for removing and appointing Data Availability Committee members.\n\n2. Amendments to the Bylaws ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VLYNk9VYUWMl0sL2wchot6I6arHCzd4r/view?usp=share_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VLYNk9VYUWMl0sL2wchot6I6arHCzd4r/view?usp=share_link))\n- Remove references to AIP-1.\n- Clarify that the definition of “Administrative Budget Wallet” includes all assets that are contributed to or otherwise acquired by the Administrative Budget Wallet, inclusive of assets specifically approved by the ArbitrumDAO. As pointed out by the DAO in its feedback in response to AIP-1, the “Administrative Budget Wallet” defined term in the Bylaws was unclear and didn’t clearly reflect the reality of The Arbitrum Foundation’s receipt of 7.5% of the token supply upon the $ARB token genesis.\n- Remove references to “Special Grants” and replace with the concept of Arbitrum ecosystem growth.\n- Remove “AIP Threshold” defined term as it is not used elsewhere in the Bylaws\n- Clarify that the ArbitrumDAO may replace The Arbitrum Foundation’s directors, change the number of directors, and require The Arbitrum Foundation to take certain actions.\n\n3. Amendments to the A&R M&A ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zmi5w21skdwuC7EAe59mYBC_4fS1vqzJ/view?usp=share_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zmi5w21skdwuC7EAe59mYBC_4fS1vqzJ/view?usp=share_link))\n- Remove references to AIP-1.\n\nLinks:\n- Snapshot temperature check: [https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x373dfa89fc9c5ccba8ed83fa3fa4f233edd270075b5f8f4f3902b408318d9d17](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x373dfa89fc9c5ccba8ed83fa3fa4f233edd270075b5f8f4f3902b408318d9d17)\n- GitHub PR: [https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/44](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/44)\n- Forum thread: [https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-aip-1-2-foundation-and-dao-governance/13362/58](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-aip-1-2-foundation-and-dao-governance/13362/58)\n",

      "title": "AIP-1.1 - Lockup, Budget, Transparency",
      "content": "Category: Non-constitutional\n\n## Abstract\ntl;dr: AIP-1.1 proposes (1) a lockup, (2) a budget and (3) transparency reporting regarding the 7.5% of the $ARB tokens distributed to the Foundation’s “Administrative Budget Wallet”.\n\nThe Administrative Budget Wallet will be used for covering ongoing administrative and operational costs of The Arbitrum Foundation, payment of service providers, and for the purpose of fostering the growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. In respect to the 7.5% that has been distributed to the Administrative Budget Wallet, a transparency report regarding the 0.5% that has already been transferred is available here 163.\n\nThe remaining 7% of tokens will not be used until the approval of a budget, such as the one proposed in this AIP. The proposed budget is in-line with the Foundation’s strategic needs to represent and service the DAO and the allocation is smaller than initial allocations to peer foundations. This AIP proposes placing the 7% outstanding distribution in a smart contract-controlled lockup – linearly unlocking over 4 years – alongside transparency report structures to allow the DAO to periodically monitor expenditures and other activities of the Foundation.\n\nThe Administrative Budget Wallet will be used in pursuit of the Foundation’s mission statement as set out in the bylaws 24, which includes financing technical improvements and operations of the Arbitrum network, fostering ecosystem growth through grants to align with partner projects and educational initiatives with in-person and online events.\n\n## Motivation\nOn March 16, 2023, the Arbitrum networks (Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova) were decentralized and given to the newly formed Arbitrum DAO. Included in this transition were:\n- Control of the upgradeability and technical future of the chains\n- Control over the DAO treasury\n- Control over net fee revenue - i.e. the net difference between fees collected by on-chain operations and L1 fees paid by the Sequencer\n- All Arbitrum social media platforms and accounts\n- Ability to elect and, if deemed appropriate, remove the Security Council and Directors\n\nFull responsibility of the chain’s technology, future, and fee revenue were given to the DAO directly. With the DAO assuming those rights and controls, the DAO also assumed the responsibility to fund the ongoing operations of the chains and the costs of running critical chain infrastructure, including RPCs, the Sequencer, and third-party vendors and service contracts.\n\nWhile there are many activities that the DAO can do directly on-chain, several of its responsibilities require a representative that can engage, maintain and enter new agreements with service providers to run infrastructure that’s critical for the ecosystem (e.g. servers, RPCs, block explorers, data feeds and analytics platforms, and tooling), and ensure that both the chain and the ecosystem have the support they need to continue to thrive. In order to ensure a smooth transition to the DAO without any interruption of services, it was necessary to create an organization that would be ready to service the DAO immediately from launch.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation was created to fill this need, with its mission and scope outlined across the Foundation Bylaws 24. Prior to the launching of the DAO, The Arbitrum Foundation assumed responsibilities for funding and running chain infrastructure. However, in an arrangement that appears to be unique amongst Arbitrum’s peers, the Foundation does not receive or control the net revenue from transaction fees as this is given directly to the DAO treasury.\n\nThe DAO is also tasked with fostering and developing the Arbitrum ecosystem, where the DAO may seek to partner with companies or organizations that either cannot or will not publicly negotiate collaborations or partnerships due to confidentiality and other operational requirements. Often, large enterprises negotiate partnership opportunities in private without public processes, where these relationships can only be disclosed after they are agreed upon. Having a well-funded Foundation empowered to represent the DAO in this arena, alongside peer foundations, is in the best interests of the DAO to further develop the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n## Rationale\nWhile the need for the Foundation to exist and represent the DAO is well-motivated, it became clear through community discourse around AIP-1 that it was important to have additional insight and restrictions on the Foundation’s initial funding. This AIP-1.1 proposes a detailed set of controls and initiatives to achieve that goal.\n\n1. Smart Contract Lockup:\n\nThe remaining 7% of ARB tokens in the “Administrative Budget Wallet” will be subject to a four year lockup schedule, unlocking on a continuous linear time basis commencing from the date of the Snapshot approval of AIP-1.1 by the DAO (i.e., a total of 175m $ARB released over each year for 4 years). The lockup will be enforced on-chain through a smart contract which will designate a multisig wallet controlled by The Arbitrum Foundation as the beneficiary. The lockup contract will be configured in a manner that allows the DAO to adjust future funding and/or modify the unlock schedule.\n\n2. Operating Budget:\n\nBelow is a proposed annual operational budget for the first year of the Foundation. While the operational costs are denominated in USD, the expectation is that approximately half will be paid in USD and half will be paid in locked $ARB tokens.\n\nAs this will be the first year of the Foundation’s operation and as the Foundation is still young at the time of this AIP, it goes without saying that these are estimates with the expectation that this will be an upper bound on the operational costs for the first 12 months. The transparency reports described in the next section will be an opportunity to track the actual expenses against the budgeted categories and keep the community informed.\n\n- Operating Budget: Cost ($USD)\n- General and Administrative: $16,000,000\n- R&D: $9,000,000\n- Technical Infrastructure: $5,000,000\n- Events, Marketing & Communications: $6,000,000\n- Total - Next Twelve Months: $36,000,000\n- (50% $USD/50% $ARB)\n\n*The General and Administrative line-item includes personnel, contractors, legal, insurance and other operational costs. As of the date of this AIP, the Foundation currently has five full-time contributors, 8 contractors, and the Security Council engaged to support the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Foundation’s budget anticipates the need to hire an additional 15 full-time contributors across technical, growth and community functions over the course of this year.\n\nThis operating budget presents best-faith estimates of the Foundation’s anticipated budgetary needs which may be subject to change.\n\n3. Ecosystem Growth Initiatives\n\nAny additional funds released in compliance with the lock-up schedule above will be made available, but not necessarily deployed, to opportunistically pursue ecosystem growth opportunities and strategic partnerships on behalf of the DAO. The expectation is that the vast majority of ecosystem growth funds will be paid in tokens, and thus will not require the Foundation to sell any tokens. Wherever reasonable, the Foundation will include additional lockups and/or vesting when making distributions in tokens.\n\nThe Mission Statement in the Foundation’s bylaws 24 highlights the varied nature of the opportunities the Foundation intends to pursue, and a set of KPIs that can track all of these opportunities being developed. The basis of those KPIs will stem from a focus on onboarding and growing both the developer and user base of the Arbitrum ecosystem, attracting best-in-class infrastructure providers to the network, expanding across various industries, use-cases and scope of projects that engage with Arbitrum technology. The ultimate goal of the Foundation is to continue to foster the development of the technology and expand the Arbitrum ecosystem globally.\n\nIn addition to the Foundation’s processes for selecting grants, it is important to note that the DAO maintains control over the 3.527 billion $ARB and has the ability to distribute any additional grants as it sees fit. Additionally, should the DAO choose, it has the ability to trigger the inflation of the total supply of $ARB which will supplement the on-chain DAO treasury with 2% growth of the total supply of $ARB each year.\n\n4. Transparency Reports\n\nThe Foundation understands and agrees that the community should have oversight across how these funds are being utilized to gain comfort that spending is in the interest of the community. In furtherance of this goal, the Foundation is committed to providing a comprehensive annual report and a semi-annual progress update. This will provide the community with a better understanding of the Foundation’s expenditures, balance sheet and its pursuit of ecosystem growth opportunities alongside partnership developments, as well as the various internal and external committees and stakeholders that are involved in the decision making process.\n\nThe Foundation is continuing to build out its internal personnel to service grant requests and has already engaged a DAO service provider to assist with the administrative components of servicing grants. The Foundation is also talking with a number of different external service providers to assist in both the review and diligence processes.\n\nThe financial element of these transparency reports will include a breakdown of operational costs incurred while running the Foundation, including infrastructure spending for the Arbitrum chains, events, community building efforts, grants, etc.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned reports, the Foundation is providing an initial transparency report alongside this AIP covering all major actions and decisions the Foundation made during set-up, including the costs incurred up until now, which can be found [here](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/foundational-documents/transparency-report-initial-foundation-setup).\n\nLinks:\n- Snapshot temperature check: [https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x7203289844e807781e8d2ec110d4b97a79a29944cae06a52dbe315a16381a2ae](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x7203289844e807781e8d2ec110d4b97a79a29944cae06a52dbe315a16381a2ae)\n- GitHub PR: [https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/44](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/44)\n- Forum discussion thread: [https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-aip-1-1-lockup-budget-transparency/13360/1](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-aip-1-1-lockup-budget-transparency/13360/1)\n",

      "content": "Category: Constitutional - Process\n\nAbstract:\nThis document (“AIP-1.2”) proposes amendments to the Constitution, and The Arbitrum Foundation Amended & Restated Memorandum & Articles of Association (the “A&R M&A”) and Bylaws (the “Bylaws”) to (1) remove references to AIP-1, and (2) make other changes reflecting feedback from the community.\n\nMotivation:\nAIP-1 set out critical aspects of governance and included key governance documents for the ArbitrumDAO, and The Arbitrum Foundation which referenced AIP-1 throughout: the ArbitrumDAO Constitution (the “Constitution”), the Bylaws and the A&R M&A. However, after vigorous community debate, AIP-1 did not pass.\n\nRationale:\nThe Constitution is a foundational document that lays out the governance system and capabilities of the ArbitrumDAO; the Bylaws and A&R M&A outline The Arbitrum Foundation’s relationship with and obligations to the ArbitrumDAO. These documents should be updated, via amendment, to remove references to AIP-1 and also to reflect other changes requested by the community during the debate process over AIP-1.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n1. Amendments to the Constitution (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pIYxg9rJzIPcP0bvQAaPgmLITM9rVBIf/view?usp=share_link)\n-Remove references to AIP-1, except as reference to the moment the original Constitution became effective.\n-Make explicit that proposals to amend The Arbitrum Foundation’s A&R M&A and Bylaws take the form of a Constitutional AIP.\n-Make explicit that the DAO may make a Non-Constitutional Funding AIP with respect to the Administrative Budget Wallet.\n-Lower the threshold number of Votable Tokens required for an AIP to be posted on-chain from 5,000,000 $ARB to 1,000,000 $ARB.\n-Add a new Section 5, which details the Data Availability Committee, including processes for removing and appointing Data Availability Committee members.\n\n2. Amendments to the Bylaws (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VLYNk9VYUWMl0sL2wchot6I6arHCzd4r/view?usp=share_link)\n-Remove references to AIP-1.\n-Clarify that the definition of “Administrative Budget Wallet” includes all assets that are contributed to or otherwise acquired by the Administrative Budget Wallet, inclusive of assets specifically approved by the ArbitrumDAO. As pointed out by the DAO in its feedback in response to AIP-1, the “Administrative Budget Wallet” defined term in the Bylaws was unclear and didn’t clearly reflect the reality of The Arbitrum Foundation’s receipt of 7.5% of the token supply upon the $ARB token genesis.\n-Remove references to “Special Grants” and replace with the concept of Arbitrum ecosystem growth.\n-Remove “AIP Threshold” defined term as it is not used elsewhere in the Bylaws\n-Clarify that the ArbitrumDAO may replace The Arbitrum Foundation’s directors, change the number of directors, and require The Arbitrum Foundation to take certain actions.\n\n3. Amendments to the A&R M&A (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zmi5w21skdwuC7EAe59mYBC_4fS1vqzJ/view?usp=share_link)\n-Remove references to AIP-1.\n\n\nSteps to Implement:\n1. Approval of amended Constitution.\n2. Approval of Amended & Restated Bylaws.\n3. Approval of amendments to the A&R M&A.\n\n\nTimeline:\nThis AIP-1.2 will be posted on the DAO forum and will have at least a 72-hour period for DAO comments and input. After the end of the 72-hour period and appropriate updates incorporating DAO feedback, this AIP-1.2 will be posted for vote on Snapshot for an additional 7 days. Subsequent to the Snapshot vote, an on-chain vote will be conducted according to the terms of the Constitution.",

      "title": "AIP-1.1 - Lockup, Budget, Transparency",
      "content": "Abstract\ntl;dr: AIP-1.1 proposes (1) a lockup, (2) a budget and (3) transparency reporting regarding the 7.5% of the $ARB tokens distributed to the Foundation’s “Administrative Budget Wallet”.\n\nThe Administrative Budget Wallet will be used for covering ongoing administrative and operational costs of The Arbitrum Foundation, payment of service providers, and for the purpose of fostering the growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. In respect to the 7.5% that has been distributed to the Administrative Budget Wallet, a transparency report regarding the 0.5% that has already been transferred is available here 163.\n\nThe remaining 7% of tokens will not be used until the approval of a budget, such as the one proposed in this AIP. The proposed budget is in-line with the Foundation’s strategic needs to represent and service the DAO and the allocation is smaller than initial allocations to peer foundations. This AIP proposes placing the 7% outstanding distribution in a smart contract-controlled lockup – linearly unlocking over 4 years – alongside transparency report structures to allow the DAO to periodically monitor expenditures and other activities of the Foundation.\n\nThe Administrative Budget Wallet will be used in pursuit of the Foundation’s mission statement as set out in the bylaws 24, which includes financing technical improvements and operations of the Arbitrum network, fostering ecosystem growth through grants to align with partner projects and educational initiatives with in-person and online events.\n\nMotivation\nOn March 16, 2023, the Arbitrum networks (Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova) were decentralized and given to the newly formed Arbitrum DAO. Included in this transition were:\n\n-Control of the upgradeability and technical future of the chains\n-Control over the DAO treasury\n-Control over net fee revenue - i.e. the net difference between fees collected by on-chain operations and L1 fees paid by the Sequencer\n-All Arbitrum social media platforms and accounts\n-Ability to elect and, if deemed appropriate, remove the Security Council and Directors\n\nFull responsibility of the chain’s technology, future, and fee revenue were given to the DAO directly. With the DAO assuming those rights and controls, the DAO also assumed the responsibility to fund the ongoing operations of the chains and the costs of running critical chain infrastructure, including RPCs, the Sequencer, and third-party vendors and service contracts.\n\nWhile there are many activities that the DAO can do directly on-chain, several of its responsibilities require a representative that can engage, maintain and enter new agreements with service providers to run infrastructure that’s critical for the ecosystem (e.g. servers, RPCs, block explorers, data feeds and analytics platforms, and tooling), and ensure that both the chain and the ecosystem have the support they need to continue to thrive. In order to ensure a smooth transition to the DAO without any interruption of services, it was necessary to create an organization that would be ready to service the DAO immediately from launch.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation was created to fill this need, with its mission and scope outlined across the Foundation Bylaws 24. Prior to the launching of the DAO, The Arbitrum Foundation assumed responsibilities for funding and running chain infrastructure. However, in an arrangement that appears to be unique amongst Arbitrum’s peers, the Foundation does not receive or control the net revenue from transaction fees as this is given directly to the DAO treasury.\n\nThe DAO is also tasked with fostering and developing the Arbitrum ecosystem, where the DAO may seek to partner with companies or organizations that either cannot or will not publicly negotiate collaborations or partnerships due to confidentiality and other operational requirements. Often, large enterprises negotiate partnership opportunities in private without public processes, where these relationships can only be disclosed after they are agreed upon. Having a well-funded Foundation empowered to represent the DAO in this arena, alongside peer foundations, is in the best interests of the DAO to further develop the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nRationale\nWhile the need for the Foundation to exist and represent the DAO is well-motivated, it became clear through community discourse around AIP-1 that it was important to have additional insight and restrictions on the Foundation’s initial funding. This AIP-1.1 proposes a detailed set of controls and initiatives to achieve that goal.\n\n1. Smart Contract Lockup:\n\nThe remaining 7% of ARB tokens in the “Administrative Budget Wallet” will be subject to a four year lockup schedule, unlocking on a continuous linear time basis commencing from the date of the Snapshot approval of AIP-1.1 by the DAO (i.e., a total of 175m $ARB released over each year for 4 years). The lockup will be enforced on-chain through a smart contract which will designate a multisig wallet controlled by The Arbitrum Foundation as the beneficiary. The lockup contract will be configured in a manner that allows the DAO to adjust future funding and/or modify the unlock schedule.\n\n2. Operating Budget:\n\nBelow is a proposed annual operational budget for the first year of the Foundation. While the operational costs are denominated in USD, the expectation is that approximately half will be paid in USD and half will be paid in locked $ARB tokens.\n\nAs this will be the first year of the Foundation’s operation and as the Foundation is still young at the time of this AIP, it goes without saying that these are estimates with the expectation that this will be an upper bound on the operational costs for the first 12 months. The transparency reports described in the next section will be an opportunity to track the actual expenses against the budgeted categories and keep the community informed.\n\nOperating Budget: Cost ($USD)\nGeneral and Administrative:\t$16,000,000\nR&D:\t$9,000,000\nTechnical Infrastructure:\t$5,000,000\nEvents, Marketing & Communications:\t$6,000,000\nTotal - Next Twelve Months:\t$36,000,000\n(50% $USD/50% $ARB)\n\n*The General and Administrative line-item includes personnel, contractors, legal, insurance and other operational costs. As of the date of this AIP, the Foundation currently has five full-time contributors, 8 contractors, and the Security Council engaged to support the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Foundation’s budget anticipates the need to hire an additional 15 full-time contributors across technical, growth and community functions over the course of this year.\n\nThis operating budget presents best-faith estimates of the Foundation’s anticipated budgetary needs which may be subject to change.\n\n3. Ecosystem Growth Initiatives\n\nAny additional funds released in compliance with the lock-up schedule above will be made available, but not necessarily deployed, to opportunistically pursue ecosystem growth opportunities and strategic partnerships on behalf of the DAO. The expectation is that the vast majority of ecosystem growth funds will be paid in tokens, and thus will not require the Foundation to sell any tokens. Wherever reasonable, the Foundation will include additional lockups and/or vesting when making distributions in tokens.\n\nThe Mission Statement in the Foundation’s bylaws 24 highlights the varied nature of the opportunities the Foundation intends to pursue, and a set of KPIs that can track all of these opportunities being developed. The basis of those KPIs will stem from a focus on onboarding and growing both the developer and user base of the Arbitrum ecosystem, attracting best-in-class infrastructure providers to the network, expanding across various industries, use-cases and scope of projects that engage with Arbitrum technology. The ultimate goal of the Foundation is to continue to foster the development of the technology and expand the Arbitrum ecosystem globally.\n\nIn addition to the Foundation’s processes for selecting grants, it is important to note that the DAO maintains control over the 3.527 billion $ARB and has the ability to distribute any additional grants as it sees fit. Additionally, should the DAO choose, it has the ability to trigger the inflation of the total supply of $ARB which will supplement the on-chain DAO treasury with 2% growth of the total supply of $ARB each year.\n\n4. Transparency Reports\n\nThe Foundation understands and agrees that the community should have oversight across how these funds are being utilized to gain comfort that spending is in the interest of the community. In furtherance of this goal, the Foundation is committed to providing a comprehensive annual report and a semi-annual progress update. This will provide the community with a better understanding of the Foundation’s expenditures, balance sheet and its pursuit of ecosystem growth opportunities alongside partnership developments, as well as the various internal and external committees and stakeholders that are involved in the decision making process.\n\nThe Foundation is continuing to build out its internal personnel to service grant requests and has already engaged a DAO service provider to assist with the administrative components of servicing grants. The Foundation is also talking with a number of different external service providers to assist in both the review and diligence processes.\n\nThe financial element of these transparency reports will include a breakdown of operational costs incurred while running the Foundation, including infrastructure spending for the Arbitrum chains, events, community building efforts, grants, etc.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned reports, the Foundation is providing an initial transparency report alongside this AIP covering all major actions and decisions the Foundation made during set-up, including the costs incurred up until now, which can be found here 163.\n\nSteps to Implement\n\n1. Foundation to deploy smart contract vesting wallet in the specified configuration and transfer 700 million $ARB to it.\n2. Foundation to implement all processes described in this AIP.\nTimeline\n\nThis AIP-1.1 shall be posted on the DAO forum and will have at least a 72-hour period for DAO comments and input. After the end of the 72-hour period and appropriate updates incorporating DAO feedback, this AIP-1.1 will be posted for vote on Snapshot for an additional 7 days.\n\n",

      "title": "AIP-1: Arbitrum Improvement Proposal Framework",
      "content": "## Category: Constitutional - Process\n\n### Submitted by: Lemma Ltd\n\n### Abstract\nThis document (“**AIP-1**”) proposes the structure of a decentralized autonomous organization called the ArbitrumDAO that would be governed by holders of $ARB, the decentralized token that will serve as the primary token for fostering, developing, authorizing and/or governing the ArbitrumDAO-approved chains (as defined in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution). The ArbitrumDAO Constitution, located at https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation, a Cayman Islands foundation company, which will serve the ArbitrumDAO community and be governed by it, aims to foster the growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO will have the ability to submit Arbitrum Improvement Proposals (“**AIPs**”), vote on them and make them a reality through The Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nThe guiding values of The Arbitrum Foundation and ArbitrumDAO are described in Section 5 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution and are incorporated herein.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation serves the ArbitrumDAO by administering the wishes of the community and otherwise adhering to its guiding values. The Arbitrum Foundation and DAO governance are intended to serve as vehicles enabling impactful, transparent and fair decentralized governance by the broader Arbitrum community.\n\nThrough the submission of AIPs, the ArbitrumDAO will be able to collectively decide and effectuate changes ranging from core protocol technology to non-technical decisions that otherwise impact the community and $ARB tokenholders.\n\n\n### Specifications\n\n**Governance powers breakdown**\n\n**1. $ARB Tokenholders**\n\n* $ARB tokenholders, who make up the ArbitrumDAO, play the most critical role in the proper functioning of decentralized governance in the pursuit of a trustless, transparent and verifiable Arbitrum ecosystem. As Arbitrum is intended to be a public good, it is only right that governance over it should be governed by those for whom such public good is intended for.\n\n* $ARB tokenholders have the ability to directly propose, vote on and effectuate on-chain AIPs with respect to the ArbitrumDAO-approved chains.\n\n\n**2. Special Grants**\n\n* The Arbitrum Foundation shall be permitted to issue grants out of the Administrative Budget Wallet without undergoing a full on-chain AIP process (such grants, “**Special Grants**”).\n\n* The rationale behind the ability of The Arbitrum Foundation to issue Special Grants is to avoid inundating governance with grant applications, while at the same time alleviating voter fatigue.\n\n* The Special Grants application process and criteria will be released at a later date by The Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n\n**3. Directors**\n\nAs a Cayman Islands foundation, The Arbitrum Foundation is required to have at least 1 director responsible for the management and operation of The Arbitrum Foundation, in particular approving and entering into contractual arrangements on behalf of The Arbitrum Foundation (i.e., the parties actually approving and signing agreements).|\n\nThe directors are responsible for ensuring that AIPs do not:\n\n* Compromise their fiduciary duties owed to The Arbitrum Foundation;\n* Violate The Arbitrum Foundation’s Amended & Restated Memorandum of Association or bylaws, the ArbitrumDAO Constitution, the AIP Process or any other laws or regulations of applicable jurisdictions (including but not limited to Cayman Islands laws); and \n* Cause The Arbitrum Foundation to be in breach or violation of any contracts, agreements or any other arrangements.\n\nThe initial directors of The Arbitrum Foundation are: \n* Campbell Law, \n* Edward Noyons and \n* Ani Banerjee\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO may remove or elect The Arbitrum Foundation’s directors or expand or reduce the number of directors at any time pursuant to a Non-Constitutional AIP\n\n**4.\tSecurity Council**\nThe Security Council is a committee of 12 members of a multi-sig wallet which has the ability to perform both Emergency and Non-Emergency Actions, which are further detailed in Section 3 of the [ArbitrumDAO Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution), which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nThe initial Security Council members, split by cohort, are as follows:\n\ni.\tSeptember Cohort\n1.\t[Mo Dong](https://twitter.com/no89thkey) is the Co-Founder of Celer Network.

Data Availability Committee (Arbitrum Nova chain only)**\n\nTransactions occurring on the Arbitrum Nova chain are settled on Ethereum mainnet, but, unlike transactions occurring on the Arbitrum One chain, the underlying transaction data batches are posted and stored by the members of the Data Availability Committee on a [Data Availability Server](https://developer.arbitrum.io/das/daserver-instructions) (and not on Ethereum mainnet).\n\nThe initial members of the Data Availability Committee are authorized representatives of the following parties:\n* Reddit, Inc.\n* ConsenSys Software Inc.\n* QuikNode, Inc.\n* P2P Business Technologies\n* Google Cloud ( Google LLC.)\n* Offchain Labs, Inc.\n* Opensea Innovation Labs Private Limited\n\n\nData Availability Committee members can be appointed and removed at any time pursuant to a Constitutional AIP approved by the ArbitrumDAO. In the event that a Data Availability Committee member is removed (and not otherwise replaced) pursuant to a Constitutional AIP approved by the ArbitrumDAO, or in the event that a Data Availability Committee member resigns without a replacement, the Security Council may execute an emergency action (9-of-12 approval required) to appoint a replacement for such removed or resigned Data Availability Committee member.\n\n### AIP Guidelines and Process Breakdown\n\nSection 2 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution lays out the AIP process and voting procedures, as well as the various categories of AIPs, and is incorporated herein.\n\n**Arbitrum Voting Protocol Procedure**\n\n1. [Tally.xyz](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum) will act as the initial on-chain voting platform for the ArbitrumDAO to submit and vote on AIPs\n\n2. Tally will serve as a front-end user interface that allows DAO members to do several things, namely:\n*   Create AIPs;\n*   View delegates and their voting share;\n*   Re-delegate votes to a different delegate;\n*   View current and past AIPs;\n*   Vote on AIPs on-chain, interacting with the on-chain governance contracts via the Tally front-end; and\n*   View the status of AIP execution during all voting stages\n\n### **Steps to Implement**\n\n1. Ratification of formation of The Arbitrum Foundation and its [Amended & Restated Memorandum of Association](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19MLHbkvCgbP9grygn6YfxxM9oA_T1mEK-aYDD7nRA04/edit?usp=sharing) and [bylaws](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YkV8IC-TXQFjPZn5_IJGb2wjlxNTjDZXK3cCzoF8hqM/edit?usp=sharing) linked in this AIP-1.\n2. Ratification of the [ArbitrumDAO Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)\n3. Ratification of Security Council and Data Availability Committee member appointments and respective powers\n4. Ratification of the following allocations of the L2 basefee on the Arbitrum Nova chain: 8% of the basefee to the Data Availability Committee and 12% of the basefee to Arbitrum Nova validators\n5. Ratification of the funding of the DAO Treasury (as defined in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution)\n6. Approval of the AIP process as described in this AIP-1\n7. Completed setup of the [Arbitrum ](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation)[Forum](http://forum.arbitrum.io), [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth) and [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum)\n8. Ratification of funding the Administrative Budget Wallet\n9. Ratification of reimbursement of costs as illustrated in the Overall Cost sections below and disbursement of such reimbursements to applicable service providers\n\n**Timeline**\n\nSolution prepared and ready to be ratified and approved\n\n**Overall Costs**\n\n**Initial Setup Costs of The Arbitrum Foundation and ArbitrumDAO**\n\nTotal setup costs, including legal costs, DAO administration setup and registration fees to be reimbursed to service providers:  $3.5 million (“**Total Setup Costs**”)\n\n**DAO Treasury**\nIn order to best provide the ArbitrumDAO with the ability to effectively govern and foster the development of Governed Chains (as defined in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution), 3,527,046,079 $ARB tokens have been transferred to the DAO Treasury. The ArbitrumDAO will have direct on-chain governance powers over the DAO Treasury in accordance with the AIP process as delineated in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution.\n\n\n**The Arbitrum Foundation Administrative Budget Wallet**\n\nFor the sake of operational and administrative efficiency, a separate account controlled by The Arbitrum Foundation will be created (“**Administrative Budget Wallet**”). 750 million $ARB tokens will be transferred to the Administrative Budget Wallet for purposes of making Special Grants, reimbursing applicable service providers for the Total Setup Costs and covering ongoing administrative and operational costs of The Arbitrum Foundation. Further funding of the Administrative Budget Wallet shall require approval of an AIP by the ArbitrumDAO pursuant to the AIP process.\n\n[The Arbitrum Foundation Memorandum of Association](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19MLHbkvCgbP9grygn6YfxxM9oA_T1mEK-aYDD7nRA04)\n\n[The Arbitrum Foundation Bylaws](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YkV8IC-TXQFjPZn5_IJGb2wjlxNTjDZXK3cCzoF8hqM/edit?usp=sharing)",
