      "title": "Coral Connectü™∏ Proposal",
      "content": "**Why Coral Connectü™∏**\n\nCurrently in the world there are operations working to regrow reefs in many locations with land-based nurseries. The problem is that there are no coordinated communications between them, no transparency for funding these operations, no aggregated shared knowledge pool for education, and no standard metrics reported. Because of these limitations, reefs are dying faster than we are collectively regenerating them.\nCoral Connect is a novel solution to these problems. Our platform will allow for coral regeneration operations all over the world to share research data on species, growth rates, total amount of reef regeneration, environmental changes and so much more. All of this while also serving to translate digital assets into direct real-world impacts actually growing coral with every partner location and individual user added (currently 13 locations in Mexico, Dominican Republic, Indonesia and most recently Palau). This will also provide public access to the larger knowledge base of coral restoration data for standardized reportable impact metrics to be shared. This solves the problem of transparency by adding publicly visible accountability to each site.\n\n**How it works**\nCoral Connect is building much more than just one public good. Currently we are on track to provide two direct impacts. The first of these impacts is global. We have already begun development of a Dapp (MVP) to connect the world's coral regeneration projects as described. The Coral Connect Dapp allows all restoration sites to upload data regarding their impact, coral species grown, and conditions of the environment where the grown corals are to be out planted. This platform will allow for data sharing to increase functionality of all existing coral regeneration operations, offer your everyday individual the ability to contribute as well as learn by actively participating in the restoration of our world's reefs.\n![alt text](\"C:\\Users\\mcspa\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\GHVoAxLaIAAlgn8.jpeg\")\n **Previous tests and Developments**   \nPrior sections of our development plan have been funded by Gitcoin and the Arbitrum Foundation as we have progressed. The test run was completed in Magnetic Island, Queensland. We successfully grew over 50 corals; each coral was grown on a personalized start disk that was engraved to show the NFT chosen by each individual user. Each coral then has a steward as it grows and is directly linked to the individual via the platform. As we move this technology and partnership locations forward, coral type and location can both be chosen bridging this product to various locations worldwide. The choice of what image is engraved is up to each individual. Stewards can currently feed their coral and check up on the progress with a direct link through their laptop or mobile device. This has been showcased on twitter, Instagram and through other platforms such as Karma Gap. Since the testing went well, we are ready to scale.\n![alt text](\"C:\\Users\\mcspa\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\IMG_5553.jpg\") ![alt text](\"C:\\Users\\mcspa\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\GHVoAwWaoAAkHzD.jpeg\")\n**Support for ACTIVE regeneration sites**\nThe second part of this mission is to help fund many regeneration sites regrowing many reefs much faster than currently possible due to funding limitations. All corals will be funded by individuals, the platform allows for you to ‚Äúgrow your own coral‚Äù. Inside of the dap the location of impact can be chosen along with coral type. This is completed through a fiat or crypto payment and the funds are given directly to that specific initiative. During their time in these nurseries, all corals will be tracked with a digital twin in the Dapp that belongs to an individual user who sponsors the coral until its final geolocation and out planting. In between initial growth and out planting, the metadata captured will be relative to size, type of coral, individual carbon sequestration, location where it is growing. The entire process to out planting in the reef takes 6-7 months of growth in the tank with a small acclimatizing period. Again, all this data is collected and can be applied collectively allowing all nurseries to grow the most resilient and biodiverse reefs possible in every section of the world.\n**Relevance**\nThis is the technology and process necessary to have the best chance at solving this global crisis. Coral Connect creates a designated platform that will allow existing nurseries transparency through metrics, grow funding for all coral regeneration operations accelerating their impact, and create a larger more accessible knowledge pool for reef regeneration/education efforts by making research data publicly available for all interested parties. This particular public good has the potential to turn the tide as a feasible solution providing the coordination and access necessary to solve a larger shared problem.\n\n**How Does Public Nouns benefit?**\nPublic nouns holders will have the opportunity to grow their own coral at no cost. A google sheet will be provided for details regarding which image they would like on their disk and all corals grown will be integral to maintaining the biodiversity for our land-based nursery in Palau. You will be given a choice to add it to the biobank for future coral spawning or out planting directly in the Palauan reef system. By doing so, everyone who wants to will be able to use the Coral Connect Dapp to view their digital asset mirroring the living coral in the tank as it grows with all metadata included. Once the corals are to be out planted, each coral will be geolocated and data relative to its permanent home in the reef will be added to the digital asset. If you choose to participate in the biobank the metadata will reflect the exact location of that biobank used for spawning. All in all we want Public Nouns to be the first Nouns showcased in the nursery we are building in Palau. This specific nursery is being funded by the Palauan Government and will be using Coral Connect technology to share research and showcase impact.\n\n**How is Coral Connect non-excludable and non-rivalrous?**\nBy design Coral Connect is non-excludable. We want everyone in the world to use it. Quite simply the more people, businesses, and initiatives that use Coral Connect the faster we can regenerate our world's reef systems. No one is excluded from use of the platform and even the nursery in Palau itself is non-excludable because it will be funded by global users of the platform itself. Secondarily, Coral Connect is non-rivalrous. Since the goal is to onboard as many users and as many coral regeneration projects as possible, in no way would one person's or initiative‚Äôs use of the platform limit another's. Even in the cases of conflicting data sets there is no exclusion, and it does not limit or cause the system overall to be less useful to a single party. The platform and the nursery are both designed to serve all, be hyper scalable, and regenerate reef systems as quickly as possible while opening new channels for participation, donation, and data aggregation to improve global functionality and scope of applicable knowledge for anyone who wants to learn.\n\n**Budget**\n2 ETH - directly funds finishing the Coral Connect MVP \n1.2 ETH funds server costs for the first year, along with initial set up for all coral nurseries that have agreed to us the platform currently, allowing for adjustments to be made to the MVP\n1.6 Eth funds flights to Palau and Indonesia for initial setup with sites across Indonesia and our site being built in Palau. I will personally be going to do this.\n\n**The impact of the Coral Connect Dapp**\n- It streamlines global efforts creating large scale data aggregation for direct use in coral regeneration and research operations\n- It provides a higher level of visibility and direct donation funnel for all existing coral restoration projects worldwide in a non-exclusionary platform.\n- It allows government use cases for mass adoption as well as non web3 native onboarding to solve a globally shared problem directly. \n- The platform also provides transactional network instances for public goods tokens and cryptocurrency causing further adoption worldwide.\n\n**Deliverables**\n1. Figma design for the Coral Connect Dapp will be shared immediately\n\n2. Standard Key metrics become reportable in Dapp by Coral Regeneration Operations Smart contract then will be shared with Public Nouns\n\n3. Fully working Dapp shared\n\n4. Our CMO will travel to Palau to work alongside our scientists and provide direct oversight of all Coral regeneration operations in Palau. He will also be travelling to onboard existing Indonesian Coral Gardners sites to the Dapp.\n5. A Google sheet to be provided for all Public Noun holders to grow a coral at no cost. (1 per Public Noun)\n\n**Reporting (Feedback Loop)**\nWe propose a simple feedback loop to create a seamless operation between Coral Connect and Public Nouns. Firstly, all current and proposed milestones will be added to our Karma Gap for public transparency and reportability.\n<https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/coral-connect-1/grants/0x48ce1421fdee9b0c7fa260a1b8ebded09f862a0ca6011df563ee162459cd5de0/milestones-and-updates>\n\nOnce milestones are complete, they will be reported and attested to on-chain. These milestones will also be reported on our website <https://www.coralconnect.life/>\nAll deliverables will be shown to your selected evaluator via email including required proofs will be provided promptly as each step is completed.\nThe Dapp itself and the nurseries involved both already have feedback loops and layers of reporting. This will be amplified by data coming from the regeneration sites and citizen scientist portal native to the Dapp itself. This is actually taken one step further because the corals grown in the nurseries themselves also have feedback loops correlating to growth rates and directly measured outcomes as we begin to showcase the MRV and biodiversity of each site. This takes place within each operation individually and is aggregated through the Dapp allowing reporting for many different reef systems all at the same time through a variety of metrics.\n\n**Request**\nWe are requesting 5 ETH in total. To finish the current Dapp build. All other funding such as land acquisition for nursery and costs associated with the building of the infrastructure, including the lab have been previously arranged through U.S. developers, the Palauan government, and other companies focused on direct ocean impact. As a team we simply need your help to complete this intermediary step so that we can make the bigger move and provide an outstanding avenue for global collaboration, public education, data sharing, and direct reef restoration.\n\nRecipient Address:\n0xFad96031f28BCcE112Fbf71f207a9302d64D937E\nAmount in ETH: 5\n\n==Thank you for taking the time to review this proposal and vote to helpüôè==\n\nMike Spaulding (The Hill)\nX profile: <https://x.com/hardmoustache>\nLinkedin: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-spaulding-862890257/>",

      "title": "Coral Connectü™∏ Grant Request",
      "content": "By supporting this proposal, you are voting \"YES\" to better aggregation of scientific research, data sharing for amplified direct impacts, an increased knowledge base for public education, on chain global data pools, and increased publicly visible metrics. Basically, you are providing others with the technology they need to solve a larger shared problem. As we see it the coral reef systems of the world are an integral component of life on this planet. In fact, twenty-five percent of life on the planet exists in coral reefs, if they die, we all do. However, from our point of view we have the opportunity to act now and make a direct change not only with our project but with every other initiative and coral regeneration project globally. Currently in the world there are operations working to regrow reefs in many locations. The problem is that there are no coordinated communications between them, no real large-scale visibility for funding these operations, no aggregated shared knowledge pool for education, and no standard metrics reported. Because of these facts coral is dying faster than we are collectively regenerating it.\n\nEnter our solution, Coral Connect. This novel approach will allow for coral regeneration operations all over the world to share research data on species, growth rates, survivability, environmental changes and so much more. All of this while also serving to translate digital assets to direct in real life impact actually growing coral with every partner location we add (currently 13 locations have agreed in Mexico, Dominican Republic, Indonesia and most recently Palau). This also will provide public access to the larger aggregated knowledge base of coral restoration data and allow for standardized reportable impact metrics to be shared. For the last year we have worked to build relationships with many restoration projects, the Indonesian and Palauan governments, as well as highly specialized scientists to provide a direct and efficient solution to not just one problem plaguing these coral regeneration operations but several at the same time. We aim to leverage all of our contacts, government relationships, national media influence, and web3 experience to accelerate a public good that is specifically designed to solve the world's exponential death of coral and turn the tide of regeneration efforts in every country we expand too. \n\n\nHow do we plan to apply this?\n\nCoral Connect is building much more than just one public good. Currently we are on track to provide two direct impacts. The first of these impacts is global. We have already begun development of a Dapp to connect the world's coral regeneration projects. This platform will allow for data sharing to increase relative functionality of all existing operations, streamline donations by creating transparency through blockchain and data reporting, and offer your everyday individual the opportunity to contribute as well as learn by actively participating in the restoration of our world's reefs. Prior sections of our development plan have been funded by Gitcoin and Arbitrum as we have progressed. With their help we have rebranded, developed our website, and begun Dapp development. However, even with our own personal finances combined we simply do not have enough to finish the Dapp in the way we would like to make it as useful as possible to individuals, businesses, and the coral regeneration projects themselves.\n\nThe second part of this mission is to create a fully sustainable solar powered land based coral nursery in Palau complete with biobanks and out planting services layered with Coral Connect technology. This facility will include a fragmentation laboratory used for coral propagation and 3d scanning capability for metadata capture to be used in the Dapp. All metadata captured will be updated regularly in the platform for each individual coral. The function of this land-based operation is to directly outplant several thousand corals to the surrounding Southeast Asian coral triangle every six months. During their time in the tank, all corals will be tracked with a digital twin in the Dapp that belongs to an individual user who sponsors the coral until its final geolocation and out planting. All legal guidelines and SOP are followed to increase overall coral survivability and general biodiversity after out planting as well as expedite growth rates 50x faster than the ocean itself. In between initial growth and out planting the metadata captured will be relative to size, type of coral, individual carbon sequestration, location it is growing, and with which initiative it is being grown. As this data is collected it can then be applied to global operations allowing us all to grow the most resilient and biodiverse reefs possible in every section of the world even though all reefs are different and have various species and spawning schedules. This is the technology and process necessary to actually solve this global crisis. While corals are extremely resilient, at this time they need our help to mitigate the damage humankind has done to them. This project creates a specific initiative that will hire and upskill local people, regenerate reefs in the coral triangle, grow funding for all coral regeneration operations thus accelerating their impact, and create a larger more accessible knowledge pool for all regeneration efforts providing publicly accessible data for interested parties globally, while raising awareness of public goods use cases through national media coverage and eco-focused social media campaigns. This particular public good has the potential to turn the tide of a global problem and further the adoption for all public goods as feasible solutions to larger shared problems. \n\n\n\nHow is Coral Connect non-excludable and non-rivalrous?\n\nBy design Coral Connect is non-excludable. We want everyone in the world to use it. Quite simply the more people, businesses, and initiatives that use Coral Connect the faster we can regenerate our world's reef systems. No one is excluded from use of the platform and even the nursery itself is non-excludable because it will be funded by global users of the platform itself. Secondarily, Coral Connect is non-rivalrous. Since the goal is to onboard as many users and as many coral regeneration projects as possible, in no way would one person's or initiative‚Äôs use of the platform limit another's. Even in the cases of conflicting data sets there is no exclusion, and it does not limit or cause the system overall to be less useful to a single party. The platform and the nursery are both designed to serve all, be hyper scalable, and regenerate reef systems as quickly as possible while opening up new channels for participation, donation, and data aggregation to improve global functionality and scope of applicable knowledge base for anyone who wants to learn.\n\n\nWhy do we need funding NOW?\n\nWith every day that passes the shared problem that Coral Connect aims to solve gets worse. Corals are dying at an increasing rate so the sooner we can pump out this technology and coordinate global efforts the better. Furthermore, by building the nursery in Palau, we can set a global standard of restoration practices with experts supported and backed by the Palauan government to then present our use case of this public good to the United Nations as part of global efforts against climate change. We must act now to take advantage of our partnerships currently in place. If we want to have any hope of survival as a species, we must address this problem with innovative collaborative solutions like Coral Connect and use our high-level relationships to push this efficient solution forward.\n\n\nImpact/Deliverables \nThe impact of the Coral Connect Dapp is threefold:\nIt streamlines global operations creating large scale data aggregation for direct use in coral regeneration and research operations\nIt provides a higher level of visibility and direct donation funnel for all existing coral restoration projects worldwide in a non-exclusionary platform.\nIt allows for government use cases and mass adoption as well as non web3 native onboarding to solve a globally shared problem directly. Our platform also provides transactional network instances for public goods tokens and cryptocurrency causing further adoption\n\nDeliverables are broken into four specific reportable outcomes.\nFigma design for the Coral Connect Dapp will be shared\nDigital asset production.\nFully working Dapp shared with Public Nouns \nMike Spaulding, (The Hill) will relocate to Palau to work alongside and provide direct oversight of all Coral regeneration operations in Palau as well as travel to onboard existing regeneration sites to the Dapp.\n\n\nReporting (Feedback Loop) \n\nWe propose a simple feedback loop to create a seamless operation between Coral Connect and Public Nouns. Firstly, all current and proposed milestones will be added to our Karma Gap for public transparency and reportability.\nhttps://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/coral-connect-1/grants/0x48ce1421fdee9b0c7fa260a1b8ebded09f862a0ca6011df563ee162459cd5de0/milestones-and-updates  \n\nOnce milestones are complete, they will be reported and attested to on-chain. These milestones will also be reported on our website https://www.coralconnect.life/\n\nAll deliverables will be shown to your selected evaluator via email including proof of Mike‚Äôs move, place of residence, and his ticket to Palau, when purchased, will be provided promptly as each step is completed.\n\nThe Dapp itself and the nursery both already have feedback loops and layers of reporting coming from the user base, regeneration sites, and citizen scientist portals native to the Dapp itself. This is actually taken one step further because the corals grown in the nurseries themselves also have feedback loops correlating to growth rates and directly measured outcomes as we begin to measure survivability and biodiversity. This takes place within each operation individually allowing reporting for many different reef systems all at the same time.\n\n\nRecipient Address:\n\n 0xFad96031f28BCcE112Fbf71f207a9302d64D937E\n\nAmount in ETH:\nWe are requesting 5 ETH in total. To finish the current Dapp build. All other funding such as land acquisition for nursery and costs associated with the building of the infrastructure and lab have been previously arranged by Mike through U.S. developers and Palauan companies focused on ocean initiatives. \n\nAs a team we simply need your help to complete this intermediary step so that we can make the bigger move and provide an outstanding avenue for global collaboration, public education, data sharing, and direct reef restoration.\n\nThank you for taking the time to review this proposal.\n\nMike Spaulding (The Hill)\nX profile: https://x.com/hardmoustache\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-spaulding-862890257/",

The platform helps communities and ecosystems use their resources to grow public goods as effectively as possible.\n\nGardens emphasizes a community experience that‚Äôs healthy, fun, intuitive, secure, and open.\n\nThe platform is designed to improve the ROI of spending on public goods for communities and ecosystems - starting in web3 and then eventually for the entire economy. Gardens' modular conviction voting framework helps with:\n\n* Resisting voter manipulation & gaming common in many decentralized funding mechanisms through time-weighted support and proposal disputability.\n* Reducing friction and administrative overhead common in many centralized funding mechanisms through continuous, parameterized funding.\n* Improving funding accountability through modularity, enabling many narrowly defined funding scopes to be run at the same time.\n\nHere are the perks for the Public Nouns community as a Gardens Protopian:\n* Create a community in Gardens v2 where members pay no Protocol Fees\n* Premium community placement on the Gardens token ecosystem page\n* A share of 4.5% of all Gardens Protocol Fees, split between all Protopians\n\n*A quick note on Gardens v2 fees - there are 2 types of fees in Gardens v2: Community and Protocol Fees. Community Fees are optionally set on the creation of a community along with a beneficiary address, and are paid by community members on registration to support the community itself. Protocol fees go to the Gardens platform, and are also paid by users when joining a community. Beekeeper and Protopian NFTs don't affect a Gardens community's ability to collect Community Fees from its members.*\n\n^ to use the Gardens platform as a public good, communities can select no fees on creation of the community. \n\n**Here‚Äôs the breakdown of where funding from the Juicebox campaign goes (screenshot attached):**\n* 50% - Future Token Liquidity - reserved to be added as community-owned liquidity for an eventual Gardens token.\n* 35% - Gardens Operations - funds operational expenses including contributor compensation and platform expenses. Our contributor pay spreadsheet is publicly viewable.\n* 10% - 1Hive - goes to the DAO that incubated Gardens.\n* 5% - Security Audit - funds an audit to uncover potential bugs and vulnerabilities in Gardens smart contracts.\n\n**The Gardens Team:**\n\n* Paul Glavin, Project Lead - https://forum.1hive.org/t/fluid-proposal-paul2-active-contributor/5525\n* Felipe Novaes Rocha, Smart Contract Lead - https://github.com/kamikazebr\n* Corantin, UI/UX Lead - https://github.com/Corantin\n* Mati0x, UI/UX - https://github.com/Mati0x\n* Lucho, UI/UX - https://github.com/Lucianosc\n* Kevin, Developer - https://github.com/kafann\n* Rodrigo, Developer - https://github.com/kafann\n* Vermeer, Social Media - https://x.com/ha_vermeer\n* Thiago, Growth, Community Onboarding - https://www.linkedin.com/in/thiago-rossi/\nProject Impact & Deliverables\n\n## Deliverables\n* 1 Protopian NFT and the market rate of Juicebox tokens, sent to the pnOps mainnet Safe as beneficiary (0xda04c025F4d8Ac555Fdb3497B197D28FCEcf4d41)\n* Within 1 month: Gardens v2 public beta shipped.

      "title": "Promoting the Contribution for Data Analysis for Achieving Better Public Goods Funding",
      "content": "## Abstract\nWe are conducting research and development aimed at achieving more effective public goods funding mechanisms by quantitatively comparing various crypto grants models. Previous research has highlighted differences in funding distribution methods across grants programs, suggesting that a diverse approach may be necessary to effectively support a range of projects. We seek contributions to continue performing a deeper quantitative analysis of grants programs.\n\nLatest research: [https://research.fracton.ventures/reports/a-retrospective-quantitative-review-of-crypto-grants-programs/](https://research.fracton.ventures/reports/a-retrospective-quantitative-review-of-crypto-grants-programs/)\n\n## Background\nPublic goods often suffer from underfunding due to the free-rider problem, necessitating intervention by third parties like the government to ensure their adequate provision in traditional economics. Grants programs are crucial for supporting public goods, which are essential for achieving a positive-sum state in the crypto ecosystem. In the crypto space, these programs are generally well-operated, providing vital funding for various projects. However, while individual analyses and reviews of grants programs are common, there is a scarcity of comparative studies that analyze multiple grants programs side by side.\n\nActually, we have researched and published a detailed, quantitative comparison of different crypto grants programs to uncover and characterize differences among them. The study particularly focuses on the decision-making bodies and methods of various grants programs: Uniswap, dYdX, Optimism, and Gitcoin. We are categorizing them into \"top-down type,\" \"bottom-up type,\" and \"QF type (algorithmic type).\"\n\nThe study quantitatively compares the grant amounts and distribution methods across these programs. We can gain the result (hypothesis) that ‚Äúbottom-up and QF types tend to distribute funds more evenly, with smaller variability and smaller grant amounts; in contrast, top-down types show greater variability in the amounts received by each grantee, with fewer recipients generally receiving larger grants‚Äù.\n\n![image1](https://images.ctfassets.net/xloor8rjevux/4e4ZyGgwNRjhCXza4jh22l/344b3667dbbda8ca4fe2b6595576f790/image16.png)\n\n![image2](https://images.ctfassets.net/xloor8rjevux/202Ro9jpP2jY5cerP8LQzy/dc9c8fe64ec6ed160d42386a0f8c71c3/image9.png)\n\n## Proposal\nI propose a contribution to conduct a deeper analysis of our research. In our previous study, due to limitations in funding and time, the scope of the investigation was restricted, making it difficult to perform a thorough and detailed analysis. With the contribution from Public Nouns this time, we can keep researching. This will enable the expansion of the study subjects and a focus on collecting and analyzing more detailed data. Additionally, this contribution will provide opportunities to collaborate with more DAOs and projects that operate grants programs, broadening the scope of our research. Ultimately, I believe that our research will offer valuable insights to the community, contributing to the design and implementation of more effective grants programs.\n\n## How does this initiative support Public Goods?\nBy examining the characteristics of each grants program, there is a potential to identify entities that can provide funding to projects that are currently underserved. Our research indicates that Quadratic Funding (QF) alone is insufficient. To effectively support a diverse range of projects, it is necessary to have multiple grants programs that complement QF. These additional programs would play a crucial role in addressing the funding gaps and ensuring a more equitable distribution of resources across various initiatives.\n\nAlso, we will arrange grants data of Public Nouns. A series of our research will serve as a compass for future funding decisions made by Public Nouns. This holds the potential to enable more effective funding strategies and the ability to provide financial support to areas that are different from those targeted by other programs.\n\n### How is it non-excludable?\nThe research and analysis we conduct will be published and made freely available to the entire crypto community, ensuring that anyone interested can access and benefit from our findings. This includes DAOs, individual contributors, and other stakeholders who can utilize our insights to improve their grants programs. By sharing our results openly, we ensure that no one is excluded from accessing the information, thus promoting transparency and inclusivity within the ecosystem.\n\n### How is it non-rivalrous?\nThe use of our research and findings does not diminish the ability of others to use it as well. Multiple DAOs, grants programs, and community members can simultaneously benefit from the insights provided without any depletion of the resource. Our data and analysis can be replicated and applied in various contexts without affecting the availability or quality for others, making it a truly non-rivalrous resource that enhances collective knowledge and decision-making processes across the crypto space.\n\n### Why does it need funding right now?\nImmediate funding is crucial to capitalize on the current momentum and interest in improving grants programs within the crypto ecosystem. The rapid evolution of decentralized technologies and the increasing number of DAOs necessitate timely and relevant research to guide funding decisions. By securing funding now, we can promptly address existing knowledge gaps, provide actionable insights, and influence upcoming funding cycles to ensure more equitable and efficient resource distribution. Delaying the funding could result in missed opportunities to positively impact the community and enhance the effectiveness of grant programs in the near term.\n\n### Team Size\n2-3 people (Research Lead, Data Analyst, and Assistant who we may hire)\n\n### Impact/Deliverables\n\n**Within 3 to 6 months after being funded**\nExpanding Survey Scope: Broaden the scope of our research to include additional grants programs and DAOs, thereby providing a more comprehensive analysis.\nDeeper Analysis: Conduct a more detailed and nuanced examination of the data to uncover patterns and insights that were not possible in the initial study due to resource constraints.\nPublication of Report: Publish a detailed report within 3 to 6 months, summarizing our findings and providing actionable recommendations for improving grant program effectiveness.\n\n*Note: After 6 months (Future plan) though \nMaking a Database: Develop and maintain a comprehensive database of grants programs to facilitate easier and more efficient analysis by researchers and stakeholders in the future.\nPractice of Grants Programs: Use the insights from our research to inform and potentially implement our own grants program, serving as a practical demonstration of our findings and recommendations.*\n\n### Recipient Address\n0x411f9a3cf8B761c0b29A7c18f0ca228C8E79BEB3\n\n### Amount in ETH\n5 ETH",

      "title": "Local Experimentations with Public Goods Funding Mechanisms - PGF Ethereum Mexico",
      "content": "## TLDR;\nLet's help advance experimentation and capability building of Public Goods Funding Mechanisms at a local level! With the 5 ETH being requested, Public Nouns will help support over 25 local projects/communities in Mexico. \n\nYou can read our conversation in discord here: https://discordapp.com/channels/1019622975705726986/1237174360221941856/1237174360221941856\n\n## Who we are\n\nPGF Ethereum Mexico, focuses on pioneering and testing new funding mechanism designs for public goods at a local level. Through this initiative, we aim to increase funding impact at the edges and increase access to funding for impactful projects in Mexico, while seeking to be a source of inspiration and innovation for the broader Web3 ecosystem.\n\nWe are in the development process of the first Retroactive Round with private voting (leveraging MACI's zk tech) based on impact. In this round we‚Äôre building local communities know-how on how to measure and track their impact on-chain, and developing a new Retroactive voting platform that integrates Hypercerts to enable the development of local Impact Markets once a round has been completed. This platform is open source and is being developed with a detailed blueprint to support its redeployment by other Latam communities. \n\n\n## About this proposal \n\nPGF Ethereum Mexico is dedicated to experiment with mechanisms that enable the funding of local Public Goods at the edges by addressing the critical issue of effective impact measurement, evaluation, and transparency in traditional funding approaches. To do so, in this first experiment we‚Äôre leveraging web3 tools such as Hypercerts, EAS Attestations, and the EasyRetroPGF x MACI (ZK private voting) build to ensure transparency, accuracy and accountability throughout the funding process and increase funding options for these projects once the round has been completed.\n\nCurrently, there are several primitives out there that look to solve different existing needs in the Public Goods Funding space, however, their strength lies in their composability. These tools can be used as building blocks to build different experiments that can lead to improved outcomes in the allocation of resources.\n\nWith this in mind, we are leveraging the following primitives of the Public Goods Funding tech stack: Hypercerts for Claims of Impact, EAS Attestations for on-chain gating of eligible projects and voters and to build an immutable registry of participating projects throughout our rounds for identity building, the EasyRetroPGF x MACI build which enables us to run the very first privacy led retroactive voting round. This round will run in OP Mainnet which makes our round accessible to anyone in the community. \n\n## Deliverables:\n\n- Open Source Code used for the round. Repo can be found here: https://github.com/Ethereum-Mex/ethmx-maci-rpgf \n- Blueprint for Future Retro Rounds: This blueprint will offer step-to-step guidance for other local communities interested in using this mechanism and leverage our learnings to improve their own local implementations. **And thus creating a virtous cycle in which we will have more Public Goods being funded at a local level.**\n- Public Nouns branding and acknowledgment as a driver for mechanism experimentation. : Ensure all materials, resources, and communications related to the QV/QF funding rounds are branded by Public Nouns.\n\n### What we're innovating on \n\n- Integration with easyRetroPGFxMACI Build: Leveraging the easyRetroPGFxMACI build developed by the PSE team, we're enabling the automatic minting of Hypercerts once disbursement of received funds has been claimed by the receiving project. This integration streamlines the process and ensures accuracy, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of the funding mechanism.\n- Integration of Hypercerts in a Retroactive Funding Round: Hypercerts will be issued to projects who received funding through this round.\n- Fractionalization of Hypercerts: We're experimenting with funding designs by fractionalizing Hypercerts based on the impact claims provided by participating projects. This approach involves retaining a subset of fractions by Ethereum Mexico as the funder of a percentage of the impact generated, while issuing another subset to the project. This innovative strategy promotes transparency and accountability in fund allocation.\n- Creation of Marketplace for Unfunded Fractions: After the round is completed, we're looking to develop a Marketplace where projects with unfunded fractions can display them for acquisition by others. This marketplace enables retroactive funding of projects post-round, fostering continued support and sustainability within the ecosystem.\n\n## How does this support public goods? \n\nWe are pioneering transformative approaches that have the potential to improve the public goods funding landscape, specially at the edges. For this reason, we believe our initiative aligns perfectly with Public Nouns DAO's mission, embodying a dedication to innovation and inclusion in public goods funding. \n\nThis round serves as catalysts to raise awareness and support for public goods at a local level, and, moreover, drive the inclusion of new public goods generators new to web3 to adopt new means of coordination and transparency and the development of an on-chain footprint for their impact. \n\nHowever, our most significant contribution lies in driving innovation within the public goods mechanism design. Our goal is not simply to fund projects, but to cultivate a culture of innovation, implementation of new web3 tools and collaboration that fosters long-term impact and the efficient use of resources in the participating projects. \n\n## Direct impact Public Nouns will help generate:\n- 1200 People Voting Across 25+ Communities in 32 States in Mexico\n- First use of a community developed QF round leveraging their own build\n- Over 1000 people using ZK technology in their voting process for public goods funding\n\n### What we need funding for\n- Cover development costs for the tool and process\n- Cover Operational costs associated with running the round\n**This round is being co-sponsored by the Ethereum Foundation and Ethereum Mexico for a Matching Pool of 10k USD** \n\n## Our past achievements\n- 5 IRL Workshops with Ledger\n- 11 IRL meetups supported by Optimism RetroPGF2\n- 5 IRL meetups self-funded\n- Presence in 16/32 states in the country\n- Organized and led Ethereum Mexico with ~700 attendees\n- +1,000 unique participants in all our gatherings\n\nMore information on Ethereum Mexico and PGF Ethereum Mexico: \nhttps://ethmexico.org/\nhttps://pgf.ethmexico.org/home",

The next round is in a week so let‚Äôs speed run this proposal!\n\n## If this vote passes, it will increase the GIV-Earth matching pool from $30k to $37k!\n(depending on the price of ETH)\n\n## Introduction\nGiveth, a zero-fee, year-round, multichain donation platform, offers unique opportunities for supporting public goods through quadratic funding. Known for our user-friendly interface and donor rewards, we have successfully completed two QF rounds since summer 2023.\n\n\nYour previous support has played a crucial role in the success of our past QF rounds, leading to substantial donations that nearly doubled the total amount of public goods funding distributed. We're excited about the prospect of replicating this success in the upcoming QF rounds.\n\n## Benefits of Sponsorship\n- Brand Exposure via banner on donation page: Prominent placement of the Public Nouns brand on our QF landing page for two consecutive rounds.\n- Social Media Content: Featured content about Public Nouns across Giveth's social media platforms corresponding to two QF rounds.\n- Project Nominations: Opportunity to nominate 3 projects for our upcoming QF round and 3 projects in the following round.\n- GIVbacks: Receive up to 80% back in GIV, distributed over time.\n\n## Previous Impact\n\nThe most detailed information for our impact can be found [here on karma gap]( https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/giveth-2/grants?tab=milestones-and-updates&grantId=0x7fd1b3d1a886f99e457d79e3d7ee19306e886a118a0e3fafc227231e0e7e741a)\n\nThe TL;DR is, the impact is a HUGE. These funds get multiplied  by other sponsors and donations. As well as it seems to be one of the largest promotional events of PN every round and even helps to fund operations.\n\n## Impact of this next Sponsorship\n\nWe invite Public Nouns to continue making a profound impact on public goods projects. Let's create positive change together!\n\nThe next round will be focused on Environmental projects, so 2.5 ETH will be directed towards incentivizing donations to take care of mother earth. Details for this round can be found here: \n\n[https://giveth.notion.site/GIV-Earth-Round-42dcbb24ef5d469d86dbcedb154ee7b0](https://giveth.notion.site/GIV-Earth-Round-42dcbb24ef5d469d86dbcedb154ee7b0)\n\n\nIf this vote passes, it will increase the GIV-Earth matching pool from $30k to $37k!\n\nThe round after that is yet to be decided, but we expect it to be a general purpose round that will support any verified public good project on the platform.\n\n\n*Note: To maintain our operations and ensure the integrity of each round, Giveth will allocate:\n- 10% of the pool funds for operational and management costs.\n- 5% for robust post round analysis.*",

      "content": "[Discord Forum Prost](https://discord.com/channels/1019622975705726986/1216603944260862032/1216603944260862032)\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n[Aura](https://github.com/Meta-Node) -- the new and improved verification method for BrightID, will eclipse \"meets\" verification in reliability and scalability, and is nearing a v2 beta launch and we are asking Public Nouns support for the development of this public good. BrightID is requesting a 10 ETH grant to support this work.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nIdentity is a human right.\n\nBy building an alternative to nation-state and biometric identities BrightID allows anyone in the world to prove they're a unique person and own their digital identity.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nBrightID is a social identity network that enables individuals to authenticate themselves as unique with control over a single account. We do this through the creation and analysis of a social graph by those who already know you. It requires no personal data from users other than the anonymous graph of connections.\n\nUse cases:\n\n- Distributing universal basic income.\n- Enabling digital democratic voting.\n- Improving polling, rating, and reviews.\n- Combating bots on social media.\n- Sharing anything equitably.\n\nAura is a new and improved decentralized verification protocol (built by BrightDAO--the community of BrightID) that will eclipse BrightID meets. Watch [Adam's EthDenver 2023 talk on Aura + BrightID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT0Jg4X473E&ab_channel=ETHDenver). Some of the key features of Aura are:\n\n- Anonymously find which friends are using BrightID--especially which are Aura players, so someone can be verified without using BrightID meets.\n- Use a \"Known Identifier\" protocol, built with Waku (the same tech behind Status.IM) to fight small-scale sybil attacks with known identifiers - BrightID.\n- Make BrightID nodes output Ethereum Attestations (for on or off-chain use) to expand our reach and make no-code integration even simpler.\n\n**How does this initiative support Public Goods?**\n\nBrightID and Aura are public goods that exist for the benefit of humanity. They are designed as nonintrusive, decentralized, and open-source technology seeking to reform identity verification--and lay the groundwork for a free and democratic society.\n\nCurrently, there is no equitable method to share resources with all people. BrightID empowers everyone to receive their fair share of opportunities while preventing exploitation and abuse beyond one's rightful portion. Enabling fairness & allowing some public goods to exist and thrive that couldn't otherwise. In other words, BrightID protects the access of unique individuals to public goods.\n\n**How is it non-excludable?**\n\n- Anyone in the world can access BrightID. They can get verified by any BrighID user. BrightID DAO hosts verification calls to make it easier for users who are not connected to other BrightID users. Aura is set to make it easier to get verified by Aura players.\n\n**How is it non-rivalrous?**\n\n- Not only is BrightID non-rivalrous, but BrightID's benefits actually increase when more people join the protocol. There are network effects in terms of advancing anonymous decentralized identity verification.\n\n**Why does it need funding right now?**\n\nBrightID is a mature product, but the core team has a backlog of critical features that have been on hold due to lack of funding. We have a protocol that can scale to world scale, but we need funding to support the launch of Aura V2 beta.\n\n**Impact/Deliverables**\n\n- Aura V2 beta launched with the following features:\n- simplifying the sponsorship flow\n- integrating with Ethereum Attestations\n- launching \"known identifiers\" as an Aura tool\n- improving the \"find friends\" feature in BrightID--especially to help BrightID users find Aura players so they can become Aura verified\n- A tweet acknowledging Public Nouns support to launch Aura V2 beta.\n\n**Feedback Loop**\n\nHere is a list of the metrics, acknowledgments and accomplishments BrightID has reached and that can be considered feedback loop:\n- BrightID was the first verification used by Gitcoin Grants, and helped develop the \"trust bonus\" which became Gitcoin passport.(https://passport.gitcoin.co/#/)\n- BrightID is the only Sybil-resistant attestation used by CLR.fund for its MACI (<https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413>) protected Quadratic voting.\n- BrightID has over 100,000 unique users.\n- 15 Apps trust BrightID for Sybil-resistance.\n- BrightID was exemplified as a Proof of Personhood solution in Vitalik's article: Moving beyond coin voting governance. (https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html)\n- Green Pill Podcast BrightID with Adam Stallard | Green Pill #35 - GreenPill | Podcast on Spotify\n- Bankless Podcast https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3DbMFYGRoM\n- Metrics are available at https://apps.brightid.org\n- A visualization of the graph and more statistics are viewable from the BrightID graph explorer (https://explorer.brightid.org/).

We know of many initiatives who could use these funds regenerate their local communities and start new businesses using web3. \n\nImpact/Deliverables \nWe will fund at least 3 project in the region, such as [Futuro Nativo](https://www.futuronativo.org) , [Upe](https://u.pe/), [Amigos Riomachuca](https://amigosriomachuca.my.canva.site/regeneracion) we plan to walk these communities through the onboarding process to setup  grants and share their impact. Projects ranges from empowering local data stewardship to developing infrastructural projects. \n\nFeedback Loop \nWe plan to do a write up after the campaign is closed (May 15th - August 1st) + periodic updates with photos from the projects as funding is distributed. \n\n## Mechanisms \n\nWe plan to use Artizen fund, a grant matching program that allocates funds from their partners like [Microsoft, Sundance Films, & Protocol Labs](https://help.artizen.fund/en/collections/4075653-match-funds) to increase the amount of funding available to these projects. \n\nSome other comparable campaigns are the Funding the Commons, where the inital 5 ETH pool was matched by $350k in sponsor and donor funds, was raised by 75 projects via the [matching pool](https://artizen.fund/?main=Match%20fund%20detail&fund=1699993465541x616373638739557500&view=Match%20fund%20detail&menu=Collectors&season=4&MFmenu=Submissions) \n\n![FTC2024-05-13 at 10.35.01‚ÄØAM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkRFHaJ70.png)\n\n## Conclusion \n\nPartnering with grants matching programs such as Gitcoin, Giveth, and now Artizen is a great way to get the most impact out of any grant and should be a focus and a priority for Public Nouns, as the treasury is small and constantly being depleted by proposals, if this season of grants goes well I could see more avenues for generating impact for local communities including bringing more crypto-native payment solutions to businesses in across the region, collecting and preserving cultural artifacts, and raising funds for communities outside of Costa Rica as part of MetaCamps mission to develop regenerative global communities expands : ) \n\n![Map 1](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1AoPa1QC.png)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "# Abstract\nUpe is developing real-world use cases within our local community that leverage blockchain technology to scale a public good. Our model can be duplicated or forked for any local community to replicate.\n\nOur mission is to empower local communities to crowdsource, curate and syndicate their information. We are bringing together those who are in the loop to fill in the knowledge gaps, and those who have access to local networks to share, so that the entire community can benefit from being able to access local information. \n\nUpe is extending its grassroots experiment of taking a community-first approach to developing the tooling and knowledge base needed for people to curate and syndicate hyperlocal information. Our mission is to create an open-source playbook aimed at bootstrapping local communities and making them stewards of the collective‚Äôs information. The playbook will include:\n\n* Tech stack recommendations and repos \n* Docs, instructions and other materials for synergizing IRL community\n# How Does This Initiative Support Public Goods?\nUpe provides a public good by making community information available to everyone.\n## How is it non-excludable?\nInformation is publicly available for everyone on the main Upe platform ( https://u.pe), the Upe forum (https://f.u.pe), and the Upe community digest (https://m.u.pe/d), all of which are live today and built using open source tech. The content on our platform is indexed and ranked in search engines so that more people outside our network can access and share community information.\n![10](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/By6Xx-MeR.png)\n\nCommunity information about water, security and other critical topics are often only shared in gated group chats. The Upe forum is now home to [monthly town water consumption reports](https://forum.u.pe/t/community-info-events-potrero-flamingo/228/218/), [annual beach clean up collection results](https://forum.u.pe/t/community-info-events-potrero-flamingo/228/222/), and [community association meeting recaps](https://forum.u.pe/t/community-info-events-potrero-flamingo/228/213), making this information, which was previously only available in private groups, publicly available to everyone. It‚Äôs clear the community finds this information important as there are spikes in forum traffic on days when the link to that information is shared in the weekly community digest.\n ![Screenshot 2024-04-04 at 11.26.57 AM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyIe7whyA.png)\n\n \n## How is it non-rivalrous?\nAccess to information will not deplete as it is consumed.\n\n# Upe Needs Funding to Extend Season 2\n## Season 2 Recap\nUpe has successfully created community resources that locals agree are ‚Äúawesome, informative and non-toxic.‚Äù The Upe community digest has 1,000 local subscribers, continuously exceeds at 50% open rate on a weekly basis, and the traffic to the digest landing page exceeds the number on our syndication list.\n![Upe & Public Nouns Recap Final](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkGfNvn1A.png)\n\n\nSee the full [Upe Season 2 Recap Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18SyoAowQ7FPSShECNtDoMODWuxLLQ3w7/view?usp=sharing) and [Season 2 grant on Karma GAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/upe-1/). \n\nWe have published hundreds of community events, and have since learned we underestimated the number of community events, which was 50, occurring monthly in our area. In actuality, we are publishing between 90 and 120 community events per month.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-04 at 11.51.25 AM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJgb5vn1A.png)\n\nAnyone can sign up to post in our community forum, and verified users are eligible to have their information shared to Upe‚Äôs network. The Upe weekly digest now has a faithful following, and our community pages are featured in hundreds of rental properties, reaching property managers, hotels, and restaurants.\n\n## Dawn of the Kooks\n30+ local impact makers, aka the Upe Kooks, are assembling to collaborate on projects, and share knowledge and connections. The Kooks are key community players. \n\n![5](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1thQu210.png)\nVisit our [Upe Hall of Kooks](https://forum.u.pe/t/hall-of-kooks/372).\n\nEvery week, a new Kook is added to the fold, and announced in the community digest. We have hosted a handful of meetups, and Kooks are beginning to self-organize in a group chat to share dank memes and photos of doggos. They are also sharing community events and info to be added to Upe, self-organizing to attend and support each other‚Äôs events and collaborating on local initiatives. \n# Season 2 Extension Objectives\nNow that we‚Äôve collectively created a useful resource of hyperlocal information, it‚Äôs time to empower the community to take ownership of this information.\n\nThe extension of Season 2 through July 2024 has three objectives:\n\n1. To work towards decentralizing the curation and syndication of community information;\n2. To foster an environment to encourage Kooks and local contributors to connect and collaborate; and\n3. To experiment with various sources of income potential to position Upe as a ‚Äúnaturally‚Äô public but monetizable goods that can be funded through commercial channels by tweaking them a bit‚Äù (Vitalik, [The Revenue-Evil Curve](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/10/28/revenue_evil.html))\n\nSince we began last August, an annual cycle for keeping community information flowing has become evident. A local community‚Äôs season lasts for 11 months followed by a one month break. The season is composed of four phases that take into account factors such as the seasons, tourism ebbs and flows, and school schedules. For the beach communities of Santa Cruz, Guanacaste, the new season starts in mid July and winds down mid June.\n\n![9](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/By3A1ZMgA.png)\n\n\nThe season begins with a Master Planning phase to build and the blueprint and guidelines for everyone to implement during the season. A new season begins in mid August and lasts through the end of November. During this phase, Upe focus will be on tasks that ensure new assets and procedures are in place, new partners are properly onboarded, old information is sanitized, and old processes are properly sunsetted, among other tasks. It‚Äôs generally raining and tourism is low, so there‚Äôs more time for members to participate. December through April is our high season, and it‚Äôs difficult to attract help during this time because everyone is busy. The Peak Season Execution phase will provide insights about how the network performs during the season‚Äôs peak. After high season wanes, we have an annual Audit & Season Wrap Up to evaluate performance of the network‚Äôs impact, contributions made and more. \n## Upe Deploys Local Quests \nUpe has formed four types of local quests to steer the community towards fulfilling its mission of crowdsourcing, verifying and syndicating hyperlocal information:\n* üî¶ **Search Party** - finds and verifies community info\n* ‚õ¥Ô∏è **Ship It** - syndicates community info\n* ü™ê **Space Maker** - containerizes the Kooks and contributors\n* üå± **Oh Grow Up** - grow the Upe network\n\n![Join Upe Community Mar 24(2)](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1Hs2Dh1C.png)\n\n\nUpe Kooks and other local builders will be able to sign up to help complete community quests from now until the end of July. We estimate that we need a minimum of 12, and will cap it at 40 local contributors to keep the hyperlocal information readily available to the public. At the end of each month, all contributions are reviewed and those who completed the quest will receive a POAP for participation. \n\n# Challenges/Hurdles\n## Objective 1: Work towards decentralizing the curation and syndication of community information.\nIn January we surveyed our community to get feedback on Upe's evolution. Not only were we able to capture the types of information they'd like to see, we also learned preferred channels and likelihood for sharing.  \n![Screenshot 2024-04-04 at 12.20.45 PM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJtqgdhyA.png)\n\nWe are creating a simple-to-use mechanism to empower the local community to vote on which information they‚Äôd like to see elevated and syndicated. We have already begun this, and you can see the [Upe Local Digest Data Dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/tpYvTGYOfhA) for all of our weekly voting results and more.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-04 at 12.09.42 PM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rynM6w31R.png)\n\n\nDrawing inspiration from spengrah‚Äôs [Anticapture](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ) framework, our voting process allows members to: \n\n* **PROPOSE** new events to vote on by submitting them to the Upe community calendar.\n* **DECIDE** which events they want to see elevated in the weekly local digest.\n* **EXECUTE** by featuring the top voted events at the beginning of the digest and in Upe social media posts.\n* **EVALUATE** if the voting mechanism functions as intended, and if it or the content needs to be adjusted.\n\nBy taking a community-first approach, it takes time to run an experiment and build trust, foster consistent user behavior and encourage new user adoption. There are no shortcuts to creating a feedback loop and iterating on requests. \n\n## Objective 2: Foster an environment to encourage Kooks and local contributors to connect and collaborate.\nOur biggest challenge is the wide range of technical abilities within our group. We are engaging in feedback loops to gain more knowledge about their tech habits and needs for sharing and collaborating, to build something that is simple and intuitive for most basic users.\n\nUpe has already begun prototyping and testing the voting mechanism among the Kooks. After a few iterations, we implemented a partial vote capture after several people who claimed to have voted had not submitted their vote. We are receiving wildly varying results, between 65.7% - 89.7% completion rate. While we are seeing promising results and a [majority of voters returning week after week](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/d9db3085-95a5-4235-82b6-e83bbd98624d/page/p_rgwv8nmvfd?s=tpYvTGYOfhA), we need more time to continue testing to refine our voting mechanism. \n\nWe are also initiating community quests in hopes of attracting more tech-oriented members in our community to support the Kooks and Upe‚Äôs mission of crowdsourcing and syndicating hyperlocal information. A bulk of the funds for this grant is allocated for quest completion, because we know that by completing these tasks together, it will build trust within the group.\n\n![Join Upe Community Mar 24(3)](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Byy2Tw2y0.png)\n\n\n## Objective 3: Experiment with various sources of income potential. \nUpe can‚Äôt run on goodwill and grants forever. We need to find a way for our community to be self-sustaining. Referencing Vitalik‚Äôs [The Revenue-Evil Curve](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/10/28/revenue_evil.html), Upe is evolving towards being a ‚Äú‚Äònaturally‚Äô public but monetizable goods that can be funded through commercial channels by tweaking them a bit.‚Äù \n\nVitalik asserts that:\n> One practical example of how this framework can be used to analyze decision-making is Wikimedia donations‚Ä¶ I've always thought that they could and should fund themselves‚Ä¶by just adding a few advertisements, and this would be only a small cost to their user experience and neutrality. \n\n*‚ÄúAdding a few advertisements‚Äù* is easier said than done at a local level. Currently, we have a conflict of interest with hosting advertising as a revenue source. We have businesses ready and willing to give us money to advertise on Upe. It‚Äôs too early to define what we are offering and we don‚Äôt want to make packages for purchase, but we do want to test for community reception, and what community buy-in looks like. We surveyed tolerance of advertising space from within the community, and that is something that they are concerned would taint the integrity of Upe. \n\nOur community has already posited the question internally on how this will not succumb to the fate of ad bloat. We don‚Äôt have an answer yet, but our members feel empowered to have a voice in the matter. More importantly, a much deeper issue has surfaced during our previous experiment: some locals were unwilling to share Upe with their network if local competitors or ads that could undercut their bottom line. For example, if one hotel agreed to pay for ad space, almost every other hotel AND property manager in the area would not participate in our network. However, even after Upe was given this ultimatum from several businesses, many were still willing to suggest alternatives for neutral advertisers in order to continue the conversation of sharing Upe resources with their network.  \n\nTraditional advertising is only one monetization model a local community can implement. Upe is creating a mechanism to unlock financial resources and coordination at both local and global levels by integrating microdata with big data while maintaining data ownership in local communities.\n![Join Upe Community Mar 24(5)](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyL47bGgR.png)\n\n\n# Deliverables\n* Prototype an easy-to-use mechanism to give collective voting power to the community members to choose what goes in the community digest and on community pages.\n* Deploy and track progress of community quests for contributors, information syndicators, validators and local builders to keep community information free-flowing and non-biased.\n* Experiment with community buy-in to curate community information and take ownership to syndicate it within their local network. \n* Another awesome Upe Impact Report, a catalog of Kook Community Projects and Events during Season 2.\n\n# Impact\nThe community agrees: having information public and accessible to all is important for everyone. For its most critical use case, having the correct emergency services information accessible saves lives. For daily users, Upe has become a resource for locals who want unbiased, no BS community information in one easy, convenient place.  Plus we love sharing how much impact our Kooks make in the community. Here are a few examples:\n\n* Kook #06‚Äôs event raised [$5,000 for monkey bridges](https://forum.u.pe/t/community-info-events-playa-grande-matapalo/154/22)\n* Kook #09 has been [grilling out on Sundays](https://forum.u.pe/t/community-info-events-playa-grande-matapalo/154/47/) and donated over $1000 for Playa Grande lifeguards and kids park\n* Kook #20 hosts bingo and brought in [$1,000 for Tamarindo‚Äôs lifeguards](https://forum.u.pe/t/community-info-events-tamarindo-langosta/221/153) and [$7,000 for the local animal shelter](https://forum.u.pe/t/community-info-events-tamarindo-langosta/221/174)\n* Kook #24 and Kook #26 host regular games like [trivia](https://u.pe/events/trivia-surf-club-bar-grill/) where funds are donated to local charities and causes\n* Kook #03 and Kook #05 collaborate on events like this [charity poker tournament](https://u.pe/events/charity-poker-here/) and [tree planting](https://u.pe/events/plant-one-pour-one-treeplanting-at-apami/)) to benefit a wildlife rescue \n\nMost importantly, we are  developing real world use cases within our local community that demonstrate the power of blockchain technology to scale a public good. Our model can be duplicated or forked by any local community to replicate. If Metcalfe‚Äôs Law is true, then as Upe unites more  local communities, a metanetwork of hyperlocal impact makers will naturally emerge to share successes, failures and opportunities. \n\n# Feedback Loop\nOur extended round of experiments will collect data to create feedback loops:\n\n* What do users find most valuable and useful?\n* What channels are users accessing Upe through?\n* Where is the community comfortable seeing advertising on Upe?\n* Would locals, businesses or tourists pay to keep it ad free?\n* Will new economic engines emerge from these local communities?\n* Which quests were most easily completed by contributors and Kooks?\n* Which quests need re-evaluation and why? \n\n# Recipient Address\nupe.eth\n0xe6829705c43530973c9a9394513a18e6a60ea22a\n\n# Amount in ETH\n6.9 ETH & 1 Public Noun\n\nThe Public Noun will be awarded to one of the contributors who participate as a validator of voting and other community data derived from feedback loops.\n\n# Use of Funds\n* Local quests that steer the group towards fulfilling its mission of crowdsourcing, verifying and syndicating hyperlocal information.\n* Tech, software, debugging & dev \n* Community activation events e.g meetups, hacking sessions, etc.\n* The Public Noun will be awarded to one of the Upe vote validators.\n\n# Other Reasoning\n1. We kicked ass with our last grant and have the [KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/upe-1/) reviews to back it up. \n2. Public Nouns will gain an awesome new member who is already a champion of public goods in Costa Rica. \n3. MetaCartel gave us funds to host an event, but we‚Äôre not stopping at just one. We are hosting several: 1) monthly Kook and contributor meetups, 2) an Upe Town Hall and 3) a fundraiser collaboration in May. \n4. Upe is *super serial* about moving their community and their data on chain. We have partnered with General Magic for our next phase of evolution.\n![superseria](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJttID3yC.jpg)\n5.  Upe :heart: Public Nouns as much as we :heart: public goods. Many Public Noun members continue to be instrumental in Upe's growth, and we are grateful for sharing their knowledge, experience, time and resources as we navigate bootstrapping our genesis community.\n\n![Upe & Public Nouns Recap Final(2)](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJJCrun1R.png)",

      "title": "HPGF Ecosystem Support Machine",
      "content": "HPGF Ecosystem Support Machine\n\n## Overview:\nHyperactive Public Goods Funding (HPGF) is a fusion of some of the most innovative elements of the public goods space. The flow finds synergy between prospective crowdfunding, impact tracking and evaluation, and the participatory retroactive public goods funding mechanisms developed by the Optimism community, fusing them by way of rigorous impact validation strategies and other open peer review processes. The goal of HPGF is to generate a virtuous cycle that, over time, will cohere enough to attract large pools of capital into the markets whose terminus is not profit extraction, but rather the judgment of impact by open process and participatory bodies interested in the flourishing of prosocial enterprises. \n\nAs it stands, this flow is only recently coming into shape. Because it's born from a concert of already complex and ambitious initiatives, the flow has a high risk of remaining inaccessible or even incoherent to the communities most in need of its innovation - indeed, at this point in development the acccessiblity and coherence of the flow is a question even for the builders shaping it. The HPGF Ecosystem Support Machine (ESM) is a workgroup dedicated to solving this problem by locating friction points where focused efforts in one domain (e.g., user onboarding) generate reciprocal clarity and coherence across the entire HPGF project ecosystem. Our work focuses on mending some of the natural fragmentation in the current public goods space, generating bridges not just between siloed web3 teams but between the public goods community and those communities outside of the web3 space that would benefit from their mechanisms immediately. \n\nOur first community of concentration in this effort is what we call the global investigative commons - that is, the journalists, researchers and data scientists that navigate the uncertain terrain of finding truth outside of the sanction of nation-states and private enterprise.  The parallel interests as well as the incidental convergence represented by this community's funding crisis make it an excellent first choice to stage our efforts, but the onboarding, concierging and explanatory work it will demand is sure to generate positive externalities that will extend far beyond journalism. Our workgroup is thus most concerned with finding the interventions that are most animated by mutual alignment and a shared problem space in order to develop HPGF Ecosystem Support output that has multidimensional benefit.\n\n---\n\n### Impact and Deliverables\n- HPGF Meta Flow\n- Bespoke Reciprocal Concierge Services\n- Technical and User Experience Documentation:\n- Protocol Experience and Editorial Content\n- Collaboration with JournoDAO\n- Community Engagement with Global Investigative Commons:\n\nOur aspiration extends beyond the immediate project outcomes, encompassing a desire to share our learnings and successes with a diverse audience that spans both Web3 enthusiasts and real-world communities. This endeavor is geared towards maximizing the societal impact of all our efforts, ensuring that the benefits of hyperactive public goods funding are accessible, relevant, and responsive to a wide demographic.\n\nMore detail here: https://hackmd.io/@esm/S1tEBwo0p\n\n## Ask\n\nFrom discussion in the forum, we're splitting our 10 eth ask into two tranches. This proposal requests the first 5 eth to begin accelerating our efforts. At an approximate 2 month checkin point, we will submit a proposal requesting the remaining 5 eth. Below are some milestones we aim to meet by then, on our way to full completion of our first HPGF cycle.\n\n- educational website of the HPGF ecosystem, with clear paths to action for those inside the ecosystem as well as impact creators on the outside. At this point it would still mostly be legible to insiders, the first step before taking it the outside and refining along with their direct needs.\n- progress on setting up an rpgf round for impact journalism.\n- progress on helping journoDAO bootstrap a long term org/foundation to steward future funding rounds and support for journalists onboarding into the ecosystem\n- likely a few other outputs could be shared as well that emerge along the way, such as hypercerts minted, reviews, editorial content, etc\n\n",

      "title": "Tree Planting Guinness World Record Sponsorship",
      "content": "**Abstract:**\nTreegens is growing the Regen movement & building the most rewarding & transparent tree planting tech. I (Jimi) have already broken the world record for most trees planted twice and plan to do so a third time with a Guinness World Records Adjudicator on site. My goal is 30,000 mangroves trees planted in 24 hours in Pha Nga, Thailand. This will not only promote the ReFi / public goods ecosystem globally, it will help us spark a movement of regenerators planting trees around the world & make a tangible impact on the ground.\n \n![Results](https://i.postimg.cc/8PVdd32X/GWR-p-Nouns.png)\n\n**How does it support Public Goods?**\n\nThis record attempt supports public goods by enhancing ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity, and coastal protection. The widespread benefits of this mangrove restoration effort underscore the project's contribution to the global commons, promoting environmental sustainability and resilience. I also want to promote Public Nouns in a variety of ways listed below. \n\n**How is it non-excludable?**\n\nMangrove tree planting is non-excludable because the benefits derived from these trees are for everyone & not a select few. From carbon sequestration to biodiversity, protection from coastal erosion, tsunamis, even filtering the water & helping nearby coral reefs - the benefits are far reaching to the public. \n\n**How is it non-rivalrous?**\n\nMangrove tree planting is non-rivalrous because many people can simultaneously enjoy their benefits & one person enjoying these benefits does not prevent another from doing so. For example, when one person benefits from the role of mangroves in preventing climate change, this does not prevent other people nor animals from also benefiting from the resultant biodiversity support. \n\n**These are all the marketing benefits to raise awareness for Public Nouns:**\n- Large Public Nouns logo on Jimi‚Äôs shirt. \n- Since it is on my shirt, the Public Nouns logo will be featured in the Guinness World Records book (150M copies sold in total so far)\n- Engaging promotion for Public Nouns Integrated into main long form video \n- Dedicated Email blast to lists from NFT giveaways\n- Year round recognition by @JimiCohen for making this possible. \n- Livestreaming of the event will feature Public Nouns logo regularly & will be streamed across a wide variety of social media platforms simultaneously\n- Media coverage - a Forbes writer has already expressed interest in writing a story, I'm in touch with multiple already & will be doing 300 press releases!\n- Public Nouns logo featured in short form clips, which will be posted on Guinness World Records socials. This is their follower count on each respective platform:\n![Results](https://i.postimg.cc/prYYgJNt/Screenshot-2024-03-21-at-20-04-57.png)\n\n**Why do we need funding?**\n- Guinness World Records will charge us 8,100 GBP + travel expenses for the adjudicator to come and authenticate the record on site & for us to licence their brand for content and media. \n- We will need to hire talented videographers because Guinness World Records assured us they would post short form clips on all their socials if the content is high enough quality. These videos can get 10M+ views\n- Will hire a team of 10-15 people to help collect mangrove propagules, pass them to me in shifts, & to keep tally of the trees with the adjudicator \n\n![Results](https://i.postimg.cc/C503V72h/Screenshot-2024-02-01-at-05-14-02.png)\n\n**Impact from Event:**\n- 30,000 mangrove trees planted in Phuket, Thailand under the official Guinness World Records methodology \n- If Jimi plants less than 30,000 propagules during his GWR attempt, the rest will be planted on a separate day.\n- Any mangrove trees which do not survive the initial plant will also be replanted.\n\nSince Public Nouns is purely about supporting Public Goods, I‚Äôd like to offer our DAO the ‚ÄòChampion Tier‚Äô in our Sponsorship Package valued at $20,000 for 5 ETH\n\nThis is the sponsorship proposal that we sent to potential sponsors: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OtB4jozYtRRbC-U2DY6CUOnMswguvciO/view\n\n**Why now?**\n- Making this tree planting world record Guinness Official is the first step towards locking in the massive partnerships necessary to break the next world record of most trees planted in a day set by Ethiopia - 560M. \n- Doing this tree planting world record on Earth Day will help us garner more media publicity\n\n\n**Feedback Loop:**\nEvery tree will not only be certified by an official Guinness World Record adjudicator & many third party tree planting experts, our AI tree counting tool will also be used to track how many have been planted & survival rates. We will also do detailed reporting on the event, tree planting outcomes & the local media will additionally document the outcomes. All of these methods will ensure accountability and ongoing engagement with our supporters and the broader community.\n\nRecipient Address: 0x48f2696FB6FAB7ac0956175b2E25B456E61B3FCf\n\nAmount in ETH:\n5ETH\n",

      "content": "## Overview\n\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkDqtpGoT.png)\n\nStreaming quadratic funding (SQF) supercharges quadratic funding (QF), the public goods funding mechanism popularized in web3 by Gitcoin, into a real-time allocation engine. \nIn SQF, donations are open-ended streams rather than one-off transfers. Changes to these streams immediately (and gas-efficiently) impact each grantee‚Äôs quadratic matching stream. SQF can be thought of as tabulating and distributing a quadratic matching round every second.\nBy eliminating time discontinuities of the traditional ‚Äúround,‚Äù SQF can help improve grantee and donor user experiences (no more 2-week shillfests), public goods impact (get funds to public goods faster & more consistently), and governance effectiveness (embrace real-time composability & an active allocation mindset).\nMore product details are available here\n\n## Where is this coming from?\nSQF is an open-source collaboration between Gitcoin, Superfluid, and Geo Web. \nThe pilot implementation is a Gitcoin Allo Protocol v2 strategy enabled by Superfluid‚Äôs new General Distribution Agreement and continuously funded by the Geo Web‚Äôs PCO land market. \nThe SQF pilot will be launched in late February & run for two months‚Äîafter which the teams (and hopefully new contributors!) can apply lessons learned to prepare SQF for broader use and to perpetuate the public goods funding flywheel.\n**All of SQF‚Äôs contracts, interfaces, and tooling are open-source.**\n\n## How can PublicNouns help?\nWe are requesting a 5 ETH grant to supplement the pilot‚Äôs quadratic matching pool (the Geo Web is a small public good project itself) and to help elevate the profile/legitimacy of this experiment. \n100% of the funds will be streamed to public good grantees over the course of the pilot according to community QF votes/donations. The pilot grantee list will be small but include a diverse collection of trusted public goods from the industry. \nWe would welcome grantee nominations from the pNouns community and, of course, help spreading the word about this new public goods funding primitive.\n\n## Recipient Address\n\n0xDE798cD9C53F4806B9Cc7dD27aDf7c641540167c (og.geoweb.eth)\n\nNote: This is a Geo Web-owned EOA that we‚Äôll use to immediately bridge to Optimism, wrap to ETHx, and deposit into the SQF Matching Pool.\n\n## Amount in ETH\n\n5\n\n\n[Word Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QtX_yHMEfXf4FDEJ9tT1_F5IyuAV7ftyZttTZ79H10o/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "content": "# TL;DR \n\nShielded Voting increases fairness & integrity of DAO votes on Snapshot using threshold encryption to hide how participants vote until the poll closes. \n\nShutter Network offers Shielded Voting to all communities on Snapshot completely free of charge. Shutter Network also hopes to offer Shielded Voting to communities on other voting platforms like Kleros and Fractal in the near future. \n\n# Abstract\n\n## Problem\n\nVoting is the backbone of DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) decision-making. web3 voting mechanisms aim to be transparent & verifiable. However, these same voting mechanisms also suffer from voter apathy, manipulation, and lack of privacy - which can lead to unrepresentative outcomes and compromised governance systems. Examples of web3 voting going wrong:\n\n- A DAO voter might be discouraged from voting or from forming an opinion if it seems that the vote is moving early overwhelmingly in one direction.\n- A malicious actor might wait for a vote to play out. Only to come in at the last minute, borrowing/buying just the right amount of tokens needed to sway the vote. And doing this at a time when there's no more time for the rest of the community to react.\n\n## Solution\n\nShielded Voting Shielded Voting addresses these challenges by using threshold encryption. In a nutshell: During the vote, the voting platform only displays the total amount of voting power already deployed. After the vote, the voting platform displays all votes, including how each person voted. \n\n## Advantages\n\n- Pre-voting information symmetry\n- Enhanced confidentiality, fairness and censorship resistance\n- Protection against vote manipulation by large token holders\n- Improved user experience\n\n## Impact\n\nShielded Voting on Snapshot, provides partial privacy, ensuring a fair and transparent voting environment for DAOs. It is now the preferred voting setup of Snapshot. Shielded Voting on Snapshot is currently used by 382 unique communities. It has protected over 2,330 proposals and 216,805 cast votes. \n\n## Expansion\n\nShutter Network is working with Kleros and Fractal to offer Shielded Voting to communities on their voting platforms in the near future. \n\n## Links\n\n[https://blog.shutter.network/shutter-brings-shielded-voting-to-snapshot/](https://blog.shutter.network/shutter-brings-shielded-voting-to-snapshot/)\n[https://snapshot.mirror.xyz/yGz91njKbw-sXsnAT6RkoMzPwvuddZritz37h1OWO8o](https://snapshot.mirror.xyz/yGz91njKbw-sXsnAT6RkoMzPwvuddZritz37h1OWO8o)\n[https://linktr.ee/shutter.network](https://linktr.ee/shutter.network)\n\n# How does this initiative support Public Goods?\n\n## How is it non-excludable?\n\nShutter Network committed to building open source technology. Shutter Network is and has always been an open source project and open protocol. Here is our Github repo https://github.com/shutter-network/shutter.\n\nShielded Voting is currently available free of charge to all communities on Snapshot, itself a permissionless and open source project.\n\nOther voting platforms may integrate or fork Shielded Voting without the permission of Shutter Network.\n\n\n## How is it non-rivalrous?\n\nIf a voting platform implements Shielded Voting, it does not prevent other voting platforms from doing so - and it does not decrease the value of their implementation. Similarly, if a community on a voting platform enables Shielded Voting, it does not prevent other communities from doing so - and it does not decrease the value of their implementation. \n\nIn fact, each implementation of Shielded Voting will likely increase the value of all voting platforms and DAO votes by increasing fairness & integrity of DAO votes. \n\n## Why does it need funding right now?\n\nShutter Network launched Shielded Voting on Snapshot in October 2022. Since then, we have provided Shielded Voting free of charge to all communities on Snapshot. \n\nShutter Network will use grant funds to maintain Shielded Voting on Snapshot and offer Shielded Voting to other web3 governance mechanisms like Kleros, Fractal and others.\n\n## Impact/Deliverables\n\n- Shutter Network will continue to provide Shielded Voting free of charge to all communities on Snapshot \n- Shutter Network will accelerate integration of Shielded Voting with Kleros and Fractal\n- Public Nouns will be acknowledged as a funder for the maintenance of 2 quarters of Shielded Voting on Snapshot on the next 2 quarters\n## Feedback Loop\n\nShutter Network launched Shielded Voting on Snapshot in October 2022.\n\nCurrently, Shielded Voting is the preferred voting setup of Snapshot.\n\n382 unique communities currently use Shielded Voting on Snapshot. It has protected over 2,330 proposals and 216,805 cast votes.\n\nAt least two additional voting platforms are interested in integrating Shielded Voting.\n\n### Disclosure\n\nShutter Network is currently funded mainly by brainbot gmbh, a blockchain venture builder that has been building for profit and non-profit projects on Ethereum since 2014. brainbot contributed to the original Python client in 2014 & to state channel technology in 2018. brainbot funds its work via consulting, grants, and private token sales. \n\nShutter Network has 2 applications: Shielded Voting (which is seeking funding here) and Encrypted Mempools for Base Layer Neutrality (i.e. malicious MEV prevention and censorship resistance) (which is not seeking funding here).\n\nShielded Voting is a non-profit application of Shutter Network. We have never charged for this service and we have no plans to do so. \n\nIn early 2024, brainbot will hand over Shutter Network to the community. From then on, Shutter Network will be managed by a future Shutter DAO.\n",

      "content": "*TLDR;*\nDream DAO is the only DAO investing in Gen-Z‚Äôs (15‚Äì20 yo) by providing them with the essential tools and opportunities to succeed in the Web3 ecosystem. \n\n*Links:* \n¬∑ Website - https://www.dreamdao.xyz/\n¬∑ X - https://twitter.com/DreamDAO_\n¬∑ Dream DAO deck (achievements & testimonials) - https://bit.ly/4aohK0q\n\n*How does it support Public Goods?*\n¬∑ It is non-excludable by welcoming Gen-Z‚Äôs all around the globe to join the DAO & participate. \n¬∑ It promotes inclusivity by allowing Gen-Z‚Äôs from diverse, nontechnical backgrounds, to gain experience from the Web3 ecosystem. \n\nDream DAO has partnered with organizations like Coinbase, Celo & Near to provide diverse Gen-Z‚Äôers around the globe with the training, funding, mentorship, and opportunities they need to leverage the power of web3 to build a brighter future for humanity. \n\nDream DAO needs funding to kick off season 5 early next year, which will welcome new Gen-Z Builders and the Champions who will guide them through educational sessions, one-on-one mentorship, and internship programs. Public Nouns will play a crucial role in keeping the DAO alive and helping us to make this new season happen.\n\n*Abstract* \nDream DAO is a Web3 social impact initiative driven by and for Gen-Z‚Äôs. The DAO consists of Builders, Gen-Z‚Äôs aged 15-20, who are interested in exploring the intersection between web3 and social impact. Complementing them are Dream DAO Champions, established leaders representing a range of industries who generously lend their expertise, network, and other resources to the DAO. \n\nThe \"Learning Together Sessions,\" held weekly, are educational talks featuring prominent figures from the web3 and social impact spheres, that lead to a community discussion on a topic related to web3.\n\nDream DAO‚Äôs most dedicated Builders are given the opportunity to attend and co-organize IRL events & web3 conferences like NFT.NYC, Web3Conf in Goa, ETHM√©xico & Devcon VI. They are also encouraged to take part in hackathons and other valuable experiences.\n\nThe Dream DAO Bootcamp is a three-week initiative designed to onboard and educate new builders about the fundamentals of Web3 technology, and onboard them to Dream DAO. This effort started last season, with 50 builders integrated into the DAO.\n\nIn addition, the Explorers Program is a three-month internship opportunity that financially supports young individuals to contribute to well-known web3 social impact organizations. Builders can join these organizations to learn about working in the web3 ecosystem, be part of teams, explore future job possibilities, and build a valuable network. \n\n*How does this initiative support Public Goods?*\nBy investing in the future of Gen-Z, a demographic that will play a crucial role in shaping the world's future. By providing them with essential tools, training, mentorship, and opportunities in the web3 ecosystem, Dream DAO ensures that the next generation is well-equipped to contribute positively to society. \n\nThe \"Learning Together Sessions\", the Explorers Program and the Dream DAO Bootcamp are prime examples of how Dream DAO is creating a ripple effect of knowledge and opportunity, benefiting not just the Gen-Z participants but also the broader community.\n\n*How is it non-excludable?*\nDream DAO welcomes inclusivity by inviting Gen-Z individuals worldwide, regardless of their background, to be part of the DAO. The initiative champions diversity, ensuring that even those without technical expertise can join the Web3 ecosystem. Anyone can apply to join Dream DAO, emphasizing its open-door approach. \n\n*How is it non-rivalrous?*\nDream DAO's offerings are non-competitive in nature; the involvement of one individual doesn't reduce the chances or advantages for another. From attending \"Learning Together Sessions\", to participating in the Explorers Program, the countless opportunities Dream DAO offers are abundant for all. \n\n*Why does it need funding right now?*\nDream DAO requires funding to initiate season 5, which is planned to kick off early next year (2024). This season aims to onboard 40 new Gen-Z Builders and 30 Champions, who will be instrumental in guiding these young minds through educational sessions, mentorship, and internship programs. \n\nPublic Nouns, as mentioned, will play a vital role in making this new season a reality.\n\n*Impact/Deliverables:*\n1) Season 5 Launch:\nCoordinate with Working Group leaders for execution.\nSet up social media campaigns. \n2) Onboarding Process:\nLaunch an onboarding program for Builders ‚Äì Provide them with essential resources, mentorship, and tools.\nWelcome 30 Champions with an orientation session: Align them with builders based on expertise and interest.\n3) Dream DAO Bootcamp:\nFinalize the agenda and timeline for the 3 weeks Bootcamp\n4) \"Learning Together\" Sessions:\nIdentify and invite outstanding figures from the Web3 & social impact spheres.\nConduct weekly sessions \n\n*Impact*\nSince its inception in November 2021, Dream DAO has successfully completed four seasons, gathering a vibrant community of 167 active members. This includes 58 Champions and 109 Builders from over 18 countries across four continents. In particular, the USA, India, and Mexico. \n\nOur internship program has successfully placed 17 Builders in renowned web3 organizations, including The Climate Collective, Giveth, dOrg, Regen Network, Aera Force, among others.\n\nFurthermore, the dedication to continuous learning is evident in the 84+ \"Learning Together\" sessions we've hosted, collaborating with esteemed organizations in the web3 space, including Sky from Public Nouns! \n\nDuring the last season, 50 Dream DAO Builders received Web3 training as part of the Dream DAO Bootcamp‚Äîan initiative that is set to continue in the upcoming season. \n\n26 Builders have received scholarships to attend different Web3 conferences around the Globe like ETHMexico 2022, Web3 Conference Goa, Devcon Bogot√°, Consensus 2022, & NFT.NYC 2023.\n\nAmount in ETH\n5 ETH\n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "The Birth of Meliora",
      "content": "## The Birth of Meliora ##\n\n**TLDR;**\nMeliora aims to democratize access to blockchain education through an interactive graphic novel. By providing free access to educational content and tools, it enables broader participation in the web3 ecosystem.\n\nHow does it Support Public Goods?\n‚Ä¢ It is non-excludable by making educational content available freely and to all, requiring only an internet connection, email, or wallet verification\n‚Ä¢ It is non-rivalrous since one person accessing the content does not exclude others from accessing it.\n‚Ä¢ It promotes inclusivity by abstracting complex blockchain concepts into users from diverse, nontechnical backgrounds\n\nWe partner with organizations like BrightID and Unitapp to provide free resources enabling individuals to participate without upfront investment. Meliora needs funding now to further develop and expand access to its educational offering which is crucial in this time while the markets are quiet and there is room for newcomers to focus on upskilling and growing within the web3 landscape. The funding would support creating more content, translating to new languages, and building out the technical infrastructure to reach a broader audience.\n\n**Abstract:**\nThe Meliora Universe project seeks to create an interactive graphic novel that serves as both an engaging narrative and an educational tool. By leveraging the power of NFTs and digital collectibles, this initiative aims to introduce a broad audience to the world of blockchain and web3, demystifying complex terminologies and concepts in an accessible format. Central to our philosophy is the conviction that knowledge is empowerment. \n\n**Background:**\nThe blockchain and web3 space, while revolutionary, remains daunting for many. The Meliora Universe project recognizes the need for innovative educational tools that can make this domain more approachable. By combining the allure of storytelling with the interactive potential of NFTs and digital collectibles, we aim to create a seamless learning experience.\n\nNow is the prime moment to ready individuals for the upcoming surge in the blockchain market by grounding them in the fundamentals. Bear markets are for builders. This is the opportunity to prepare the next generation of leaders.\n\n**What is Melior(a)?**\n\nOur guiding principle, *Melior*ism, champions the belief that the world can be made a better place through human effort. \n\nMeliora is a universe created out of abstracted descriptions of the world we are a part of, and the world we wish to see through the fusion of technology and nature. Our team of writers, artists, developers and game designers have been building the story and world for the past year. We are dedicated to demystifying blockchain, aiming to make it comprehensible for people and entities globally. Our modular games and stories are so engaging that players forget they're gaining skills and blockchain knowledge.\n\n**How does this initiative support Public Goods?**\n\nDeeply rooted in the ethos of democratizing knowledge, Meliora is inspired by ancient stories of seekers on a quest for wisdom. Our game and narrative embraces the idea that everyone, regardless of background, has a right to access, comprehend, and benefit from blockchain technology. We have partnered with Unitap to create freely accessible multi-chain gas token faucets, allowing any individual to mint, quest and explore on any chain with zero investment. Cybil attacks to manipulate or steal gas tokens are prevented via our other partner, BrightID.\n\nIn addition to being chain-agnostic, Meliora is also ‚Äúagnostic. We will initially release the beta app in English, but quickly expand to Spanish as well. This further democratizes blockchain knowledge, bridging gaps in access. By providing free public access to quality educational content, our initiative enables more people to up-skill and prepare to contribute their talents to its ongoing development. Just as past knowledge seekers traveled far to uncover truths, Meliora aims to spread the transformative potential of blockchain far and wide.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n1. 32 pages of lore\n2. MVP with the first module available to everyone for life!\n3. Short introduction to chapter 2 and the upcoming modules\n\n**Impact:**¬†\nThe Meliora Universe novel¬† will serve as a beacon for those curious about blockchain but deterred by its complexity. By providing an engaging narrative coupled with interactive learning, we anticipate reaching thousands of players, guiding them towards informed web3 adoption.\n\nThe platform will increase blockchain literacy, empower a broader audience to participate in web3 technologies, partner with organizations and provide tools for people to co-create the future of tomorrow.\n\n**Meliora Needs Funding to‚Ä¶**\nBuild/Create:\n* Art, characters, story, settings, game mechanics, worldbuilding, etc.\n* Animations and GUI design and implementation\n* Web3 backend: web wallet interaction, smart contracts, etc. \n\n## Feedback Loop ##\nOur Work Thus Far: \nStart reading here: https://app.charmverse.io/nofun-labs/page-30219360476504575\nRead the Prologue: https://app.charmverse.io/nofun-labs/page-07913989628289175\nMeet The Characters: https://app.charmverse.io/nofun-labs/page-9266348974898024\n\n**Recipient Address:**\n0xA860e6AD4E5f0ecA9d034A2700C28cF516eB660E\n\n**Amount in ETH**\n5 ETH",

      "title": "Glitch Blockchain Art Residency",
      "content": "## Summary\n4 ETH to fund a NFT/Blockchain research-focused art residency at Chateau du Fey in France, Burgundy, called GLITCH. We are hosting a 2-week residency for artists, musicians, NFT protocol designers, AI artists, metaverse platform builders, token economists, researchers, and philosophers.¬†\nThe multidisciplinary gathering at Glitch is an opportunity to experiment with new forms of collective creation, remixing, and distributing art. We think there is a unique opportunity to build new types of public goods during Glitch, where blockchain engineers, AI and blockchain artists can collaborate on the creation of new NFT collections that actually explore the use of REMIX NFT that was developed at GLITCH 2021, and more fair and equitable redistribution models for artists. We will also work with artists and musicians on applying the new open source NFT Token-Bound Licensing¬† standard which was developed at Glitch 2022 for embedding Creative Commons-like licensing conditions directly into the NFT.\n## Core team members\n* Isaac Patka\n* Primavera De Filippi\n* Ooli Shannon De Vill√®le\n* Will Papper\n\n## What is GLITCH\nGLITCH is a two-week focused residency at an 18th century chateau in France. About 30-40 participants will be invited to create, imagine, develop theories, build projects and standards aimed at supporting a new creative ecosystem of open creativity and digital abundance in the blockchain art world.¬† The participants will be a highly curated group of creative and smart individuals actively engaged with NFTs, art, music and AI. *The goal is to bring the right people, in the right place, at the right time, and then let the magic happen.*\nAt GLITCH, we strive to empower people with ideas, visions, and expertise, while providing space for our attendees to reach deep into their minds and forge better models together. We exist to disrupt the status quo and to manifest positive solutions for society.\nThe outcomes of the residency will be, first and foremost, a tight community of value-aligned people eager to collaborate with one another, new collaborations and synergies in order to shape the world of tomorrow. The residency will also promote a variety of new initiatives about how to promote the value of openness and interoperability in the blockchain art world. Expected deliverables include new NFT protocols that encourage remix and creativity, new NFT protocols geared towards maximization of social and environmental impact, as well as a variety of collaborative exhibitions for NFT artists. All content produced within the residency will be released and made available to all under Creative Commons licenses.\n\n## Why did you decide to build it\nThe NFT landscape is still struggling to provide the new opportunities it has the potential to create. Existing NFT platforms are driven by commercial purposes, and miss the objective of providing an interoperable ecosystem for openness and creativity. Alongside this, creative practices within the NFT are yet to be perfected, often focusing mainly on speculation, and lacking the desire to rely on open and interoperable standards. To make things worse, many of NFT platforms do not provide for the proper licensing of digital assets to their participants, and instead establish terms of services that remain under the exclusive control of the platform operators. Many NFT collectors are just following the trend, eager to pump and dump digital artworks, which they can ‚Äúshill‚Äù on the secondary market, in order to earn money from speculation. We need dedicated individuals to research their use cases and the ways in which blockchain and NFTs can contribute to more creativity and collaboration, how they can enact a striving economy of digital abundance, how NFT platform should be structured to become more interoperable, which standards they should adhere to, and how they should be governed so that members can be protected and engaged to participate in this new environment.¬†\n\nGLITCH aims to bring together the brightest individuals contributing towards or researching the use of blockchain in art to produce standards, philosophies, research or products that tackle some of these key societal issues. GLITCH also aims at gathering artists, musicians, performers, etc. to collaborate in the production of collaborative pieces, jamming together in order to brainstorm novel ideas and generate new content. It is hosted at chateau du Fey - a place that has become the home of an intentional community of artists, thinkers and activists over the past 4 years ([http://feytopia.com](http://feytopia.com/)), and within which participants can remain undistracted from outside forces.¬†\n## About the event\n*Participant Count*\n\nThere will be 30-40 active Participants including the core team committee members for a duration of two weeks (Oct 23 - Nov 5). Each of these will be carefully selected to contribute to the extitutional framework by being active and engaged artists, thinkers, builders, or entrepreneurs.¬†\n\n*Agenda*\n\nThere is no clear cut agenda for topics to be worked on, as the team believes in the natural synergies that occur from a selection of top-level participants. There will be no scheduled talks or workshop: we expect these to emerge organically over time. The idea is to have a value-aligned cohort of creative and open-minded individuals live under the same roof for an extended period of time. Participants are encouraged to work on their own projects as well as to collaborate with one another, both at the conceptual, operational and artistic level. As the organizers, we will try to maximize the opportunities for serendipity and cross-pollination. There will be some room for group building activities towards the beginning, presentations to be held throughout the event, and an ‚ÄúOpen House‚Äù Weekend open¬† to outsiders to visit the facilities and view our progress.\n\n*Visitors / VIPs*\n\nSome established artists, musicians, top level developers and guests from the external world, including traditional metaverse industries, will be invited to visit the event in the hope that they can contribute with their own experiences and help building a bridge between the still seclusive Web3 and Traditional Worlds.¬†\n\n*Location and Reasoning*\n\nThe Chateau du Fey has served as the home to the Feytopia community for 3 years, and has hosted many events geared towards Web3, blockchain technology, digital art, and future-proof environmental thinking. By harnessing the network of the place, Chateau du Fey has become a centrepoint for great thinkers oriented towards rebuilding the future in an open and collaborative way. The space and the facilities are perfectly oriented to explore potential use cases of Web3 and NFT in the context of the Metaverse.\n## How much funding are you requesting\n4 ETH from Public Nouns. This is intended to be part of a co-funding round supported by several key organizations across the NFT / Metaverse ecosystem. The funding will be used for preparing the venue for the residency, hosting the guests, and paying for event related expenses.\nOur total budget for the event is $60,000. Budget breakdown available on request.¬†\n## Why fund this?\nIn our experience having successfully organized residencies with similar formats in the past, events like this lead to immense amounts of collaboration, open source knowledge, and leaps forward in technical progress. Sponsors have a unique opportunity to be involved, fund positive-sum outcomes, and build a network with highly aligned builders and leaders in the space.\n## Website\nDeck with additional information concerning the residency is available here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/11uDyyC_etEQ4DriBfTzHsSkPQZBnnWG4/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11uDyyC_etEQ4DriBfTzHsSkPQZBnnWG4/view)\n## What makes a good sponsor?\nWe value sponsors that contribute to the development of resilient, decentralized coordination tools in all ways. Some sponsors contribute technical tooling, research, and products. Some sponsors bring perspectives from academia, economics, politics, and institutions where they learned what works and what doesn‚Äôt. We are seeking participatory & cultural sponsors, beyond covering the event costs.\n\n## Success\nWe will measure the success of the project by the new lifelong friendships that will be established, the research outcomes, new initiatives and future collaborations between the residents, the NFT space, and the sponsors.\n\n## Previous outcomes\nBeyond the several artistics collaborations that have emerged during GLITCH1 and GLITCH2, the projects listed below are a direct outcome of GLITCH 2021 and GLITCH 2022, which specifically focus on increasing public goods within the NFT and blockchain art spaces:¬†\n* DAO Palace (2022 and 2023): two 10 days research-focused residencies at the Bueckeburg Palace in Germany . About 30-40 participants attended to create, imagine, develop theories, and build projects and standards aimed at supporting a more open and collaborative DAO ecosystem.\n* REMIX NFT to promote a culture of remix within the NFT space: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EJ4ywCeEU6ZG0VODaDgK0SzWxjWgyYR8LwctfRpti4I/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EJ4ywCeEU6ZG0VODaDgK0SzWxjWgyYR8LwctfRpti4I/edit)\n* IMPACT NFT: [https://pdefilippi.com/impact/](https://pdefilippi.com/impact/), using NFT to promote climate positive solutions, in collaboration with Tomas Saraceno\n* Eco-coin: a 2 weeks gathering in Wilbur, California, to design standards and protocols to reward ecologically-friendly activities through voluntary markets for impact certificates\n* Token-bound License, to embed legal licenses directly into the tokens: [https://james.grimmelmann.net/files/articles/token-bound-nft-license.pdf](https://james.grimmelmann.net/files/articles/token-bound-nft-license.pdf)\n* Feral File exhibition (ecotone): [https://objkt.com/collection/feralfile-20-ecotone](https://objkt.com/collection/feralfile-20-ecotone), promoting collaboration between artists and blockchain engineers.\n* GLITCH 2.5: art residency in Portugal to support the creation of a festival for NFT artists and builders / makers.\n* Bio-glitch: [https://glitch.bio/](https://glitch.bio/) - a collective interested in exploring the use of blockchain and web3 for supporting the environment.\n\n## Team description\n**Isaac Patka** is the co-creator of Logos, a DAO exchange furthering the adoption of Web3 governance in IRL communities. He is also a core developer in the Moloch Mystics building Moloch v3, a member of DAOHaus, and a research fellow with DAOstar, building interoperable standards for web3 communities.\n**Primavera De Filippi** is a Research Director at the National Center of Scientific Research in Paris, and Faculty Associate at the Berkman-Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard. She is the author of ‚ÄúBlockchain and the Law‚Äù published by Harvard University Press. Former member of the Global Future Council on Blockchain Technologies at the World Economic Forum, she is the founder and coordinator of the U.N. Internet Governance Forum‚Äôs dynamic coalitions on Blockchain Technology (COALA).¬†\n**Ooli De Vill√®le** is a web3 fashion designer interested in how DAOs can bridge the physical and the digital. Previous to this she was the founder and CEO of a tech startup, growing the company to over $100 million in three years on the market. Ooli holds a patent for a wireless mesh technology that she built while acquiring her MFA at University of California, San Diego. With this work, she held a dual research appointment at the California Institute of Telecommunications & InfoTechnologies and the Center for Development Finance in Chennai, India.\n\n## Proposal Feedback\nThis proposal was discussed in the [Discord forum](https://discord.com/channels/1019622975705726986/1151574299166130257/1151574299166130257) prior to posting, after canceling [an earlier version](https://publicnouns.wtf/vote/25) to allow for time for discussion. Thoughtful points were brought up around whether it's higher impact to fund events (which are excludable by necessity due to available space) or to fund non-excludable initiatives directly.\n\nGlitch is different in many ways than e.g. a hackathon sponsorship or a conference booth. Most of the artists and builders at Glitch are working on initiatives that are short on time to collaborate, but don't need significant funding. There have been many public goods outcomes in the past editions, such as the Token-Bound NFT License developed to facilitate the licensing of right via NFTs or the REMIX NFT Protocol, which embeds the values of remixes and Creative Commons into an NFT framework (all released under Open Source code). These didn't require follow on funding -- once the license is done, it's published and complete -- but it did require getting experts into the same place for two weeks to figure it out. Along these lines, open source initiatives that were not born at Glitch, but that were heavily worked on at Glitch, and benefited from the contributions of many of the participants there, e.g [https://eden.art/](https://eden.art/) -- they were able to produce cleaner code and better architecture than they would have been able to otherwise.\n\nGlitch this year will have a specific emphasis on developing workshops around new tooling. The workshops will be open sourced (the attendees have a strong open source ethos), and they'll be higher quality because they had a \"trial run\" at Glitch prior to publishing. Funding the event doesn't directly fund the initiatives, but it does ensure that collaboration happens that makes the initiatives much stronger. This does have a sweet spot -- one or two days is not enough, a few months is too long -- and two weeks has been a good balance between ensuring that projects are improved collectively while making the best use of the funds.",

      "content": "# Summary\nGasHawk solves expensive and volatile transaction fees by providing a free RPC that submits transactions when gas is cheap - helping scale ethereum and save its users fees.\n\nBy monitoring the network and predicting the optimal time to submit a transaction, GasHawk can save users and institutions up to 95% on fees. Visit GasHawk.io to learn more. It‚Äôs cutting-edge technology has the potential to transform how users interact with the Ethereum network, saving them both time and money. The average cost savings are 25 - 30%.\n\nAs a non-custodial service, GasHawk aims to help users and institutions optimize their transaction cost during periods of high and volatile gas fees. We currently provide minimized transaction costs, eliminate stuck transactions, prevent transaction failures and ward off front running or sandwiching. GasHawk is a MEV resistant, gas rebate RPC layer with the capacity to grow our product offerings and value add exponentially.\n\nGasHawk is designed for transactions with a minimum time window of one minute and offers greater potential savings for longer deadlines. By targeting local minima in gas prices, our service ensures users pay the lowest possible fee, even during periods of low fees. GasHawk is free to use and easily accessible by connecting your Metamask to our RPC. Additionally, we offer an SDK and a REST API - more information can be found in our documentation.\n\nIn summary, GasHawk presents a powerful solution to the problem of high and volatile transaction fees on the Ethereum network. We are a category defining startup that offers an order of magnitude improvement to the status quo of on-chain transactions. We help users and institutions save up to 95% on transaction fees and optimize their transactions, making their experience on the Ethereum network more efficient, cost-effective and secure.\n\nI believe that this is a critical public good, as it makes Ethereum more accessible to more people in terms of cost, and also helps balance the network load. **I am requesting a 5 ETH grant to help the team keep offering the service for free and expand its effectiveness.**\n\n## Why is it a public good?\n1. Balancing the network load helps scale Ethereum, which is for the good of the people.\n2. Saving users money is for the good of the people and in our best interest.\n3. The RPC infrastructure is free, and using it lowers gas fees for other people transacting on the network, not only its own users. GasHawk is non-rivalrous and non-excludable.\n\n\n## Stats\n- +$7,000 saved by GasHawk users\n- Cost of hosting the infrastructure: ~$800 per month\n- Additional daily transaction growth of Ethereum if everyone used this balancer service: ~20%\n- I have personally saved more than 70% of default estimated gas costs on some transactions using this free service\n- GasHawk has successfully processed 7,364 transactions for over 2,900 users since launch in November\n\nI'm hoping to take this live later this week as I think there is broad support from the private convos I've had with a handful of folks and feedback we've gotten.",

      "content": "We propose **Smart Grants** ‚Äì an innovative application of Smart Invoice's on-chain milestone-based escrow invoicing system [https://smartinvoice.xyz/](https://smartinvoice.xyz/) that is optimized explicitly for the grant-funding and delivery process. \n\nSmart Grants intends to revolutionize the grant-giving ecosystem by linking the release of grant funds directly to the completion of project deliverables. It ensures secure, efficient, and fraud-resistant grant project management, making the public grant allocation process more accountable and reliable in the Web3 ecosystem and ensuring grant funds are utilized to their maximum potential.\n\n**How does this initiative promote Public Goods?**\nSmart Grants is both a public good and serves to bolster public goods.\n\nSmart Grants democratizes access to secure, reliable, and efficient grant management solutions. No initial costs are associated with Smart Grants, which allows any individual or organization to use this trustless system for grant allocation and deliverable tracking.\n\nGrant-awarding organizations often lack cohesive and reliable systems for tracking deliverables associated with grant funds. Smart Grants provides an integrated approach for these organizations to efficiently fund and incentivize deliverables for public good grants and manage those milestone releases all from within one platform.\n\n**What makes it non-excludable?**\nAs an open-source tool, Smart Grants is available to anyone with an internet connection and a wallet. Any individual or entity can utilize our services without restrictions. This inclusivity allows us to extend the benefits of secure on-chain grant management to a broad range of grant-giving organizations and recipients.\n\n**What makes it non-rivalrous?**\nThe utility of Smart Grants does not diminish with increased usage. On the contrary, as more users engage, it forms a robust and dynamic network. Hence, it exemplifies non-rivalry: one user's consumption of the service does not detract from others' ability to use it.\n\n**Why does it need funding right now?**\nWhile Smart Invoice  is currently functional and serving a growing user base, Smart Grants does not currently exist. Our proposal is to fork Smart Invoice and adapt the dApp and protocol for the needs of Smart Grants.\n\nThese funds will go towards a Smart Grants re-design, optimizing the record-keeping UX flow for both grantors and grantees, an integrated dashboard for grant organizations to view releases and manage deliverables, and a PR effort to contact organizations who would benefit from smart grants.\n\n## Impact/Deliverables:\nWith the successful procurement of the grant, we anticipate:\nRe-design for Smart Grants\nProject dashboard so grant-givers can manage several projects simultaneously and release milestones from an integrated dashboard.\nEach grant giving organization can have their own branded portal.\nGrant recipients can upload proof of deliverables and request release of the milestone through the platform. This action will generate a notification for milestone release to the grant-giving organization\n\nTo see the full discussion relating to this proposal prior to coming on-chain please see the forum thread in the Public Nouns Discord [https://discord.com/channels/1019622975705726986/1134214864039055410](https://discord.com/channels/1019622975705726986/1134214864039055410)\n\nRecipient Address: 0x9Ab379432d2AEAe17Ae2665496708aFbe1433c2b",

      "title": "Glitch Blockchain Art Residency",
      "content": "## Summary\n4 ETH to fund a NFT/Blockchain research-focused art residency at Chateau du Fey in France, Burgundy, called GLITCH. We are hosting a 2-week residency for artists, musicians, NFT protocol designers, AI artists, metaverse platform builders, token economists, researchers, and philosophers.¬†\nThe multidisciplinary gathering at Glitch is an opportunity to experiment with new forms of collective creation, remixing, and distributing art. We think there is a unique opportunity to build new types of public goods during Glitch, where blockchain engineers, AI and blockchain artists can collaborate on the creation of new NFT collections that actually explore the use of REMIX NFT that was developed at GLITCH 2021, and more fair and equitable redistribution models for artists. We will also work with artists and musicians on applying the new open source NFT Token-Bound Licensing¬† standard which was developed at Glitch 2022 for embedding Creative Commons-like licensing conditions directly into the NFT.\n## Core team members\n* Isaac Patka\n* Primavera De Filippi\n* Ooli Shannon De Vill√®le\n* Will Papper\n\n## What is GLITCH\nGLITCH is a two-week focused residency at an 18th century chateau in France. About 30-40 participants will be invited to create, imagine, develop theories, build projects and standards aimed at supporting a new creative ecosystem of open creativity and digital abundance in the blockchain art world.¬† The participants will be a highly curated group of creative and smart individuals actively engaged with NFTs, art, music and AI. *The goal is to bring the right people, in the right place, at the right time, and then let the magic happen.*\nAt GLITCH, we strive to empower people with ideas, visions, and expertise, while providing space for our attendees to reach deep into their minds and forge better models together. We exist to disrupt the status quo and to manifest positive solutions for society.\nThe outcomes of the residency will be, first and foremost, a tight community of value-aligned people eager to collaborate with one another, new collaborations and synergies in order to shape the world of tomorrow. The residency will also promote a variety of new initiatives about how to promote the value of openness and interoperability in the blockchain art world. Expected deliverables include new NFT protocols that encourage remix and creativity, new NFT protocols geared towards maximization of social and environmental impact, as well as a variety of collaborative exhibitions for NFT artists. All content produced within the residency will be released and made available to all under Creative Commons licenses.\n\n## Why did you decide to build it\nThe NFT landscape is still struggling to provide the new opportunities it has the potential to create. Existing NFT platforms are driven by commercial purposes, and miss the objective of providing an interoperable ecosystem for openness and creativity. Alongside this, creative practices within the NFT are yet to be perfected, often focusing mainly on speculation, and lacking the desire to rely on open and interoperable standards. To make things worse, many of NFT platforms do not provide for the proper licensing of digital assets to their participants, and instead establish terms of services that remain under the exclusive control of the platform operators. Many NFT collectors are just following the trend, eager to pump and dump digital artworks, which they can ‚Äúshill‚Äù on the secondary market, in order to earn money from speculation. We need dedicated individuals to research their use cases and the ways in which blockchain and NFTs can contribute to more creativity and collaboration, how they can enact a striving economy of digital abundance, how NFT platform should be structured to become more interoperable, which standards they should adhere to, and how they should be governed so that members can be protected and engaged to participate in this new environment.¬†\n\nGLITCH aims to bring together the brightest individuals contributing towards or researching the use of blockchain in art to produce standards, philosophies, research or products that tackle some of these key societal issues. GLITCH also aims at gathering artists, musicians, performers, etc. to collaborate in the production of collaborative pieces, jamming together in order to brainstorm novel ideas and generate new content. It is hosted at chateau du Fey - a place that has become the home of an intentional community of artists, thinkers and activists over the past 4 years ([http://feytopia.com](http://feytopia.com/)), and within which participants can remain undistracted from outside forces.¬†\n## About the event\n*Participant Count*\n\nThere will be 30-40 active Participants including the core team committee members for a duration of two weeks (Oct 23 - Nov 5). Each of these will be carefully selected to contribute to the extitutional framework by being active and engaged artists, thinkers, builders, or entrepreneurs.¬†\n\n*Agenda*\n\nThere is no clear cut agenda for topics to be worked on, as the team believes in the natural synergies that occur from a selection of top-level participants. There will be no scheduled talks or workshop: we expect these to emerge organically over time. The idea is to have a value-aligned cohort of creative and open-minded individuals live under the same roof for an extended period of time. Participants are encouraged to work on their own projects as well as to collaborate with one another, both at the conceptual, operational and artistic level. As the organizers, we will try to maximize the opportunities for serendipity and cross-pollination. There will be some room for group building activities towards the beginning, presentations to be held throughout the event, and an ‚ÄúOpen House‚Äù Weekend open¬† to outsiders to visit the facilities and view our progress.\n\n*Visitors / VIPs*\n\nSome established artists, musicians, top level developers and guests from the external world, including traditional metaverse industries, will be invited to visit the event in the hope that they can contribute with their own experiences and help building a bridge between the still seclusive Web3 and Traditional Worlds.¬†\n\n*Location and Reasoning*\n\nThe Chateau du Fey has served as the home to the Feytopia community for 3 years, and has hosted many events geared towards Web3, blockchain technology, digital art, and future-proof environmental thinking. By harnessing the network of the place, Chateau du Fey has become a centrepoint for great thinkers oriented towards rebuilding the future in an open and collaborative way. The space and the facilities are perfectly oriented to explore potential use cases of Web3 and NFT in the context of the Metaverse.\n## How much funding are you requesting\n4 ETH from Public Nouns. This is intended to be part of a co-funding round supported by several key organizations across the NFT / Metaverse ecosystem. The funding will be used for preparing the venue for the residency, hosting the guests, and paying for event related expenses.\nOur total budget for the event is $60,000. Budget breakdown available on request.¬†\n## Why fund this?\nIn our experience having successfully organized residencies with similar formats in the past, events like this lead to immense amounts of collaboration, open source knowledge, and leaps forward in technical progress. Sponsors have a unique opportunity to be involved, fund positive-sum outcomes, and build a network with highly aligned builders and leaders in the space.\n## Website\nDeck with additional information concerning the residency is available here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/11uDyyC_etEQ4DriBfTzHsSkPQZBnnWG4/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11uDyyC_etEQ4DriBfTzHsSkPQZBnnWG4/view)\n## What makes a good sponsor?\nWe value sponsors that contribute to the development of resilient, decentralized coordination tools in all ways. Some sponsors contribute technical tooling, research, and products. Some sponsors bring perspectives from academia, economics, politics, and institutions where they learned what works and what doesn‚Äôt. We are seeking participatory & cultural sponsors, beyond covering the event costs.\n\n## Success\nWe will measure the success of the project by the new lifelong friendships that will be established, the research outcomes, new initiatives and future collaborations between the residents, the NFT space, and the sponsors.\n\n## Previous outcomes\nBeyond the several artistics collaborations that have emerged during GLITCH1 and GLITCH2, the projects listed below are a direct outcome of GLITCH 2021 and GLITCH 2022, which specifically focus on increasing public goods within the NFT and blockchain art spaces:¬†\n* DAO Palace (2022 and 2023): two 10 days research-focused residencies at the Bueckeburg Palace in Germany .

A Dune dashboard Nouns Metrics website: A dashboard showing Public Nouns DAO's main on-chain metrics:\n(i) Treasury: Easily visualize treasury growth and spending. A list of all the proposals where the DAO deployed capital. Market value evolution of the assets held by the Treasury.\n(ii) Auctions: How much are Public Nouns selling for and who is deploying capital to buy them? Who is auctioning Public Nouns?\n(iii) Governance: Understanding voting power (taking in consideration to delegations), active voters and no-voters\n(iv) User persona: Understanding the Public nouns holders and help to draw insights\n\n 2. Public Nouns Data Digest\nA Monthly digest of the main on-chain data points of Nouns DAO will be shared. This digest will present the Monthly and yearly evolution of these data points. \n\nWe will perform scoping to understand which data points are more relevant to the community. \n\n3. Nouns Metrics Dune Account\nA Dune Account organizing all Nouns DAO data in one place. We will implement the Public Nouns Datapod's Dune design philosophy ie. Data will be organised into small dashboards that are modular, and concise. \n\nWhy is this valuable?\n- All the data analysis and queries will be public and enable the community to be forked and extended by the web 3 community as needed. \n- On-chain data is available, but should be easily accessible and digestible. \n- The Sixdegree team will be able to make data easily accessible and user their expertise to increase transparency in Public Nouns DAO, but also help every member make data driven discussions and decisions.\n- More data will lead to a better understanding of our community and thus help to grow Public Nouns and increase our impact on public good funding \n\nPast works that can be relevant\n-  Nouns Users Ranking: https://dune.com/sixdegree/nouns-users-ranking\n-  Lens Protocol Ecosystem Analysis: https://dune.com/sixdegree/lens-protocol-ecosystem-analysis\n- ParaSwap insight: https://dune.com/sixdegree/paraswap-insight\n- Website: https://sixdegree.xyz/\n\nTeam\n- https://sixdegree.xyz/\n\nRoadmap: MVP and Timeline\n2 weeks: Building requirements with Public Nouns DAO.\n4 weeks: Full launch.\n\nCosts\n- Quarterly engagement of 5 ETH for 3-months (equivalent to 1.7 ETH per month)\n- Quarterly review and checking \n\nNote, as the treasury is expanding, allocating 5-10% of total annual treasury to data and Ops is important.

      "title": "Upe | Crowdsourcing hyperlocal community information in Latin America",
      "content": "## Abstract\nUpe is a digital space for locals to crowdsource and curate community information that‚Äôs important to them.  \n\nWhile developed areas have institutional infrastructure to provide this integral information, remote tourist destinations in Costa Rica do not. Not even our local police phone number is publicly available--even in common places like Google. Local's are left helpless, not knowing who to contact in critical situations. \n\n\"*When is the next disruption in my water service?*\" \n\"*When is recycling pickup in my community*?\n\"*What's the number to the nearest police station?*\"\n\nCurrently, the best place to find answers to these questions are in private WhatsApp chats and social media groups.\n\nLocals needed a single, convenient place to aggregate and verify important information--so that **everyone** can access it. We bootstrapped Upe (https://u.pe) to fulfill this need.\n\n### How does this initiative support Public Goods?\nUpe provides an public good by making vital community information available to everyone online.\n\nOur goal is to create an open source playbook and framework for other communities to bootstrap. There are hundreds of communities in Latin America, and the world at large, navigating similar challenges and opportunities that will benefit from the information derived from this experiment. \n\n#### How is it non-excludable?\nInformation is publicly available for everyone at https://u.pe, which is live today. The content on our platform is indexed and ranked in search engines so that more people outside our network can access and share community information.\n#### How is it non-rivalrous?\nAccess to information will not deplete as it is consumed.\n### EXPERIMENT 1 COMPLETED: Upe Is Interesting to Locals\nFor our first experiment, we activated 20 locals to join a team led by one of our founders. Our core mission was to aggregate and publicly share useful, real-time information about our community. See [Experiment 1 team checklist and documentation](https://hackmd.io/@0x3V3/SJfyk-t83) for more details. \n\nThese participants were onboarded as the genesis cohort of curators and stewards of the local information aggregated on Upe. They were incentivized to earn points in the Upe ecosystem by:\n\n1. Curating information on the Upe platform\n2. Showing up to designated IRL meetups, hacking sessions, and community improvement activities e.g. beach cleanups \n3. Collecting donated vouchers from local businesses\n\nPoints accrued in this experiment (and the upcoming) will be redeemable for vouchers to local businesses at a later date.\n\n#### Outcome\nUpe has confirmed through our initial experiment that there is synergy around this curating of our community's living information. We have attracted a community of 20 local contributors. Moreover, the content generated on our platform has proven to be useful to locals. Upe receives more than 15k unique users per month.\n\nParticipants smashed two of Upe's previous monthly records: \n* 2X number of listings entered\n* 2X new user sign-ups\n\nCollectively we volunteered 26 hours of our time to participate in community beach cleanups organized by local NGO, The Clean Wave. Contributors synced at local meetups, and digitally for a community town hall call. Additionally, teams worked async to complete their checklist.\n\nThrough these interactions, we have established a series of questions to surface what local's deem vital information: \n* What critical local information are you currently unable to find online?\n* What local information would improve day-to-day living here?\n* When are the next community events and how can I participate?\n* What services or goods do you have a hard time finding here? What do you wish there was more of?\n* Which businesses would you love to receive local vouchers from? \n\nOur next experiment will iterate on getting answers from more locals, as well as ensuring the information is readily available for everyone to find.\n\n**Challenges/Hurdles** \nBefore our experiment, a majority of our content was generated by the founders, and a few core business users. Community organizations and NGOs do not have the bandwidth to share and syndicate critical information, making our work vital contribution to our local ecosystem. \n\nWithout incentives, users are not motivated to contribute to the information creation process. In order to correct the free rider problem, participants can exchange points for vouchers from local businesses. By teaming up with local businesses, we are keeping the capital from this grant circulating within our local economy. This naturally creates a flywheel to strengthen the Upe network.\n\n## Upe Needs Funding to Iterate on Our Initial Experiment\nDue to the outcome from our initial experiment, we need funding now to keep the momentum with contributors going and eliminate the free rider problem.\n\nOver the next 6 months, we are conducting a feasibility study (online and IRL) to determine if contributors will cultivate and self-manage their living, critical information so that the community at large can access it when they need it.\n\nEven though local businesses are already altruistically giving vouchers for Upe's participants to redeem for goods and services, our goal is to form long-term, mutually beneficial partnerships to avoid donor fatigue and foster a sense of community.\n\n## Deliverables\n* Implement a bounty board to complete tasks based on contributor feedback and community requests.\n* Onboard local contributors to complete bounties.\n* Procure vouchers from local businesses. \n* Provide documentation on the local onboarding initiative and reception of crypto from this experiment for Public Nouns to use for press, and flex the positive impacts of public goods.\n\n## Impact\nThe outcome of having this public information is beneficial many times over. At its most critical use case, having the correct emergency services information listed can potentially saves lives. \n\nBy sharing community event information across our local network, more participants will amplify the impact of their initiatives. For example, when Upe's cohort showed up to the Tamarindo beach cleanup, we doubled the number of participants. \n\n## Feedback Loop \nWe are creating a feedback loop by collecting data from locals about what information they deem important, what is missing (so that we can collectively add it), as well as the pain points that make daily life in remote tourism towns challenging. \n\nAdditionally, Upe is uncovering what is working, and what's challenging for onboarding non-crypto natives through activation events and community quests. \n## Recipient Address \nupe.eth\n0xe6829705c43530973c9a9394513a18e6a60ea22a\n\n## Amount in ETH\n5 ETH\n### Use of Funds\n* Onboard local community: 1) local contributors to fulfill local bounties 2) NGOs and community initiatives to receive donations and 3) businesses to purchase gift certificates\n* Community activation events e.g meet ups, hacking sessions, etc.\n* Team drivers: onboarding efforts, wrangling contributors, verifying work\n* Tech, software, dev, debugging\n### Other Reasoning\nWe want Public Nouns to pop our public goods grant cherry. Our founders personal connections with many Public Nouners have been instrumental in the evolution of Upe. \n\nMoreover, our Ask comes with a Give. The success that will come from the execution of this grant will be proof  of the power of Public Nouns, and we will provide written documentation on our experiment and results so that they can be shared with the public goods community at large. **Positive sum gains or bust!**\n\nLastly, Upe is forming strategic partnerships + community alliances at the local to international level. Collaborations include: [Instituto de Costaricense Tourismo](https://visitcostarica.com) (Costa Rica's Tourism board), [ADI Tamarindo](https://www.playatamarindo.org/) and [The Clean Wave](http://thecleanwave.org/).",

      "title": "DCTRL Hackerspace Growth Grant",
      "content": "**TL;DR**\n\nHelp fund a public hackerspace in Vancouver, BC, with the intent of live streaming weekly public interactive presentations about Ethereum, helping grow out resources in the space such as the [main website](https://dctrl.wtf), [Sidewalk Controller](https://yvrSidewalk.com), [Soda Machine](https://yvrBepsi.com) and other future resources like them, help raise awareness about Public Nouns and the Nouns ecosystem with rotating Public Nouns and Nouns NFT displays, Public Nouns Mural on a wall in the space, and help cover some running costs for public use supplies.  \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kl6ZJRy.jpg)\n\n# How does this initiative support Public Goods?\nDCTRL (pronounced Decentral or D-Control) is a hackerspace and commons in Vancouver, BC, Canada, which has been around since 2014, and has grown to create an IRL decentralized community commons. DCTRL has hosted hundreds of Meetups in the past, and is still hosting some now. We have a bunch of history and some museum pieces on display, such as old ASIC‚Äôs, Bitcoin and Crypto memorabilia, hyperinflationary currencies, and stickers galore.  Notable figures have visited the space, such as Vitalik during the inception of Ethereum, Benny Giang and Jaden Windel during the CryptoKitties launch, Gerald Cotton from now defunct QuadrigaCX, Richerd from Manifold.xyz, Gary LeChance from the Decentralized Dance Party, Bitcoin activist Andreas Antonopoulos, CoinOS and Raretoshi creator Adam Soltys, plus many other influential developer, artist, and crypto personalities. \n\nThe space has run primarily on donations and volunteers. It was particularly challenging throughout the pandemic, as many people were not around to help maintain or contribute to the space. On the other side of this now, we are trying to build out as much as possible to create an educational, self-sustaining, welcoming commons. \n\nCurrently, the main event which is open to the public is an [Ethereum Vancouver](https://twitter.com/EthVancouver) event night every Thursday where we have speakers present a topic around Ethereum or Web3. Even though these events are open and free to the public, we would like to extend the reach even further than just local. There are also Friday night \"Learn to DJ\" events, and NFT meetups every other Wednesday. Hoping to get more events running as we continue to grow and gain traction. \n\nWe also have a few interesting aspects to the space, such as a light up sidewalk outside of our door on the street, which can be programmed to have different patterns, or have words scroll across it! There are glass cubes that can be accessed from underneath in the hackerspace, so individual LEDs have been put in place to light up each cube. The live stream may not be working right now, but check out [https://yvrsidewalk.com/](https://yvrsidewalk.com/). \n\nIt's set up to work on Polygon as it‚Äôs cheap and easy. So anyone in the world can donate to change it. We would like to expand to other networks like Optimism, and Arbitrum as well.\n\nThere is also an old Pepsi machine which has been repurposed and rewired and connected to a Raspberry pi, which allows users to make on-chain donations to get beverages: [https://yvrbepsi.com](https://yvrbepsi.com). We also have an old vending machine that could dispense snacks or small items, but has not been fully configured and set up like the Pepsi machine. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hJ5rldI.jpeg)\n\nThere are a few other interesting things in the space as well, such as a library of interesting books, a workbench with tools, along with a rich history of meetups, helping inform and educate the local public. Previous Meetup account with past events can be found here: [https://www.meetup.com/decntrlvan/events/past/](https://www.meetup.com/decntrlvan/events/past/)  \nAll of these aspects can be built out and grown further to extend the reach of DCTRL to more of the public.\n\nHaving the option to live stream events, proper lighting, proper audio setup, materials to freshen up the space with paint or art will help it flourish. It will also be beneficial to have an option to provide bounties to devs who could help build out the technical infra (Sidewalk, Soda Machine, Vending Machine, Discord tools), adding some more technical things like screens and devices that could rotate through NFT collections like pNouns, or things like cleaning up the place, or fixing things that break. It would also be great to have a small budget to bootstrap drinks, snacks, and small items to go in the soda machine and vending machine, along with other things like toilet paper, paper towel, soap, and other cleaning supplies.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0JPZ4Ff.jpeg)\n\nAs the space is growing and more people are getting involved, we can attract more developers, and create a bounty board (Dework/Wonderverse) to incentivise anyone to come pick up a task or collaborate on it with others. This will expedite the process of completing things like the Sidewalk, the Pepsi Machine, the Vending Machine, or new ideas in the future!\n\n# How is it non-excludable?\nDCTRL‚Äôs goal is to expand out and be as inclusive as possible to the local public, and to the online public community. By extending the reach to have an online presence with live streams, this allows others who can not make it to the physical space the opportunity to engage and learn about topics and discussions that are being held at the physical space. Including a chat screen for online individuals to ask questions would also help make it more inclusive. Putting bounties online via a bounty board like Dework or Wonderverse will also allow outside developers to contribute to the space as well. \n\n\n# How is it non-rivalrous?\nAs more people get involved with DCTRL, it will be able to grow and flourish. More involvement means more abundance. Expanding to an online presence will only help grow as well. Upgraded infrastructure will help make this all a reality, and hopefully encourage outsiders to get involved. \n\n\n\n# Why does it need funding right now?\nIn order to keep this common space alive and flourishing, it would be ideal to broaden the reach of our community, and share as many of our resources as possible with others. As we are hosting events on a regular basis, it would be ideal to capture those and share them with the greater public, and create a database of all of these sessions for others to view and learn from. As this is a hackerspace, we need to fund a few of the projects that need to be built out to help us become self-sustainable. Development of things like the Sidewalk, Soda Machine, and Vending Machine can and would be super beneficial to the public, and being able to give use cases and onboarding people into Web3.\n\n\n# Request Amount for Funding in ETH\n\n- Dedicated PC for Live Streaming: 0.75 ETH (Quantity: 1)\n- Monitor for PC: 0.20 ETH (Quantity: 1)\n- Accessories / Cables for PC: 0.15 ETH (Quantity: 1)\n- Cameras for Live Stream: 0.50 ETH (Quantity: 1)\n- Microphone for Presenter: 0.10 ETH (Quantity: 1)\n- Microphones for Audience: 0.10 ETH (Quantity: 2)\n- Monitor for Livestream Chat: 0.10 ETH (Quantity: 1)\n- Restream.io Subscription: 0.10 ETH (Quantity: 1)\n- Raspberry Pi‚Äôs for NFT Displays: 0.05 ETH (Quantity: 3)\n- Displays/Monitors for NFTs: 0.10 ETH (Quantity: 3)\n- Paint and Bounty for Public Nouns Mural: 0.10 ETH (Quantity: 1)\n- Bounties for Devs: 0.10 ETH (Quantity: 10)\n- Lighting for Presenters: 0.05 ETH (Quantity: 2)\n- Supplies for the Hackerspace/Resources: 0.45 ETH (Quantity: 1)\n\nTotal: 4.20 ETH\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/34oaiUm.jpg)\n\n# Impact Deliverables\n\nA YouTube and Twitch channel will be set up where Live Streams can be viewed by the public, where comments can come in via YouTube, Twitch or Discord, and all be consolidated by Restream.io. NFT Displays and Mural will be created and shared on Public Nouns Discord. Resources like the Sidewalk, Soda Machine, and Vending Machine will all come to life for public use on additional chains.  \n\n\n# Feedback Loop\n\nAs DCTRL grows, more of the public will be empowered to learn and be educated about Web3, and be among other like minded people who are passionate about Web3. Also raising awareness about Public Nouns and the Nouns ecosystem through the Mural and NFT displays. \n\n# Recipient Address\n\ndctrl.eth\n[0xD5184c0d23f7551DB7c8c4a3a3c5F1685059A09c](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD5184c0d23f7551DB7c8c4a3a3c5F1685059A09c)\n\n# Amount in ETH\n\n4.20",

He‚Äôs interested in public goods and knows how to find the right memes and fun messaging to engage with communities.\n\nImpact\nOur Public Nouns Twitter is extremely quiet. And we aren‚Äôt maximising the opportunities to engage with the public to raise awareness for our mission.\n\nLow hanging fruits include engaging with our partner public goods communities and amplifying obvious wins for the community, such as Public Nouns art being showcased in the Colorado State Capitol and podcasts like the recent one with Giveth.\n\nI think this is a low outlay for a relatively high impact.\n\nBudget\nAsking for 6 months of this upfront as a test budget.\n\nThis would be for $500 / month for a tweet of at least one tweet a day, as well as some additional work to coordinate efforts around any campaigns that Public Nouns run from time to time, as well as any additional initiatives with our PGCs.\n\nI will set up a multi sig managed by me and at least 4 other community members to coordinate the initial payments to Nigel, unless we decide to use the pnounders one instead.\n\nI think we should donate him a Public Noun from the treasury if we keep him on for more than a few months. I may donate him one of my Public Nouns in the interim period, as it would be easier for all to have him in the DAO members section of the discord.\n\nDissenting Opinions\nWe shouldn‚Äôt pay out operational costs using the DAO‚Äôs treasury.\n\nWhile I like the idea of this in principle. Unfortunately, we, don‚Äôt have any other funding sources at the moment. And until we raise more awareness for Public Nouns, this is unlikely to change, so we are in a bit of a chicken and egg problem.\n\nSomeone from the DAO should do this\nThat would be ideal! Please raise your hand if you‚Äôre willing to take this on. If you don‚Äôt have time to do this yourself on a daily basis but do have some expertise, please - if this proposal passes - help with onboarding Nigel so we make the most of his time.\n\nDeliverable(s)\nI initially suggested at least one or two tweets a day, with a more intensive campaign once a month that would be more involved.\n\nNigel is very relaxed and a hard worker, so I see this as an emergent process that will get better over time. Our downside is limited to $500/month.\n\nFeedback loop\nI‚Äôm happy to be Nigel‚Äôs main liaison as we already have a prior working relationship. However, in an ideal world, someone else would take this on, so Nigel has multiple contact points in the DAO. We should review his output every week, and course adjust as necessary",

So I am putting it back up as maintenance.  \n\nBonus -> If you have been following the Public Nouns twitter: https://twitter.com/PublicNouns \nyou will see the top quality work being done!\n\n\nOriginal text by dermot.‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® :\n\nDescription\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1019622975705726986/1067817376571195452\n\nI failed to notify everyone last time, so I'm putting it up again as it failed quorum despite getting 10 votes for and 0 against...\n\nSummary\nEveryone in this wonderful little community of ours shares the need for more awareness of Public Nouns and how a more active Twitter presence is a key starting point.\n\nNigel Dollentas (https://discord.com/channels/1019622975705726986/1027335025265475654/1067219205503598742) has run socials in the past for portfolio companies of mine like Pocket Network and Tenderize, as well as DeFi protocols like Yearn. He‚Äôs interested in public goods and knows how to find the right memes and fun messaging to engage with communities.\n\nImpact\nOur Public Nouns Twitter is extremely quiet. And we aren‚Äôt maximising the opportunities to engage with the public to raise awareness for our mission.\n\nLow hanging fruits include engaging with our partner public goods communities and amplifying obvious wins for the community, such as Public Nouns art being showcased in the Colorado State Capitol and podcasts like the recent one with Giveth.\n\nI think this is a low outlay for a relatively high impact.\n\nBudget\nAsking for 6 months of this upfront as a test budget.\n\nThis would be for $500 / month for a tweet of at least one tweet a day, as well as some additional work to coordinate efforts around any campaigns that Public Nouns run from time to time, as well as any additional initiatives with our PGCs.\n\nI will set up a multi sig managed by me and at least 4 other community members to coordinate the initial payments to Nigel, unless we decide to use the pnounders one instead.\n\nI think we should donate him a Public Noun from the treasury if we keep him on for more than a few months. I may donate him one of my Public Nouns in the interim period, as it would be easier for all to have him in the DAO members section of the discord.\n\nDissenting Opinions\nWe shouldn‚Äôt pay out operational costs using the DAO‚Äôs treasury.\n\nWhile I like the idea of this in principle. Unfortunately, we, don‚Äôt have any other funding sources at the moment. And until we raise more awareness for Public Nouns, this is unlikely to change, so we are in a bit of a chicken and egg problem.\n\nSomeone from the DAO should do this\nThat would be ideal! Please raise your hand if you‚Äôre willing to take this on. If you don‚Äôt have time to do this yourself on a daily basis but do have some expertise, please - if this proposal passes - help with onboarding Nigel so we make the most of his time.\n\nDeliverable(s)\nI initially suggested at least one or two tweets a day, with a more intensive campaign once a month that would be more involved.\n\nNigel is very relaxed and a hard worker, so I see this as an emergent process that will get better over time. Our downside is limited to $500/month.\n\nFeedback loop\nI‚Äôm happy to be Nigel‚Äôs main liaison as we already have a prior working relationship. However, in an ideal world, someone else would take this on, so Nigel has multiple contact points in the DAO. We should review his output every week, and course adjust as necessary",

This program combines a unique DAO onboarding experience with a dynamic online hackathon and networking opportunity, providing a solid pathway into Web3 work with a focus on regen values.\n\nBy structuring our program into cohorts, we provide a highly focused training environment that fosters collaboration, peer-learning, and community spirit. This approach has already produced impressive results, with former participants becoming full-fledged RaidGuild members, starting their own companies, or contributing to renowned organizations like Gitcoin, Bankless DAO, EF, and MetaMask. Our commitment to transparency and integrity of the entire Web3 ecosystem aligns with the ethos of public goods and intentional growth.\n\nWe are seeking funding to continue providing top-tier mentorship and resources to our cohort participants. PublicNouns support of 2Œû will directly influence the development of future Web3 leaders and innovators who will contribute significantly to the direction of the whole ecosystem. \n\nPlease consider joining us in this (ad)venture. Together, we can continue fostering the development of quality talent for the wider Web3 ecosystem, a public good that benefits all.

      "title": "Support DAO Palace 2023, Incubating the future of DAOs and stewarding Cultural Heritage Sites",
      "content": "### Abstract\nThe most brilliant contributors to public goods projects surrounding DAOs will be collaborating, sharing, experimenting and building at DAO Palace 2023, in a few months. \n\nProjects like pNouns, Family DAO and Constitutions of Web3 were incubated or launched at DAO Palace 2022, all of which are supporting open source commons and public goods. \n\nParticipation in DAO Palace 2023 is open, collaborative and curated in a decentralized manner, balancing inclusivity and exclusivity.\n\npNouns is invited to share an integral role in DAO Palace 2023, as a Villa sponsor. What will emerge this year?\n\nHow does this initiative support public goods?\nDAO Palace brings together the individuals that contribute to public goods. It is a gift to these individuals to collaborate and learn from each other. \n\nDAO Palace participants build in the open, so that iterative evolutions can happen faster. When they are all together in a physical space, like DAO Palace, this intended evolution is exponential, because learnings and experiences are combined and integrated in ways that could not be prescribed, especially from the proprietary perspective that encourages building in parallel, which is slow and often detrimental, wasting time and resources.\n\nDAO Palace is supporting the public goods that the participants support, which is not only what they support today, but also what they will support in the future.\n\n### How is it non-excludable?\nWhile DAO Palace does have limited spaces available for participation, which naturally creates an imbalance in supply and demand that results in a highly curated group of DAO experts, the barrier to entry is not exclusive. The event is free to participants, supporting the attention towards including more diverse perspectives.  Sponsors and alumni are encouraged to nominate participants from other organizations. \n\n### How is it non-rivalrous?\nA goal with the DAO Palace alumni is to support more events like DAO Palace. Partnerships with events from outside the community are welcome.\n\n### Why does it need funding right now?\nBecause the event is free to participants, DAO Palace is able to bring together the brightest minds to collaborate, experiment, build and share.\n\nDAO Palace 2023 is scheduled for June 20 - 29. It is important to secure vendors for accommodations and meals as soon as possible. \n\n### Impact:\nThe 15 projects listed below have emerged as inspiration from, or in collaboration with, individual‚Äôs experience during DAO Palace 2022.  Nothing here is proprietary; it‚Äôs all free and open. \nGlitch\nThe DAO Book\nDAO East West\nFamily DAO\nConstitutions of Web3\nPublic Nouns\ngm bus\nNonce<> Raid Guild Hack\nEIP-4824\nValidator Commons\nExtitution podcast\nDAO or Never in the Treehouse\nCollectives, modular NFTs\nDAOcember\nESP\n\n### Deliverables\nThere are three sponsorship tiers. Tier 3: Villa is being proposed ($5,000 tax deductible sponsorship)\n1 participant spot\n3 nominations of attendees from other orgs\nFeature in social media posts and newsletter\nLogo placement on website\nDiscount for a future event at the castle\nDAOESCO membership for participants\nAccess to alumni projects\nPriority sign up for future events\n\n### Feedback loop:\nPublic Nouns was hacked on during DAO Palace 2022. Many of the early bidders, helping to promote the pNouns brand, were DAO Palace participants, who often use their pNoun as a PFP. DAO Palace loves pNouns!\n\n### Team description:\nDonatus zu Schaumburg Lippe, Primavera De Filippi, Ooli De Vill√®le, Anastasia Analova, V4N, Sky and BorrowLucid bring expertise from accessibility in blockchain solutions, blockchain and law, bridging physical and digital, business development and growth strategy, DAO2DAO relations and DAO governance and operations.\n\n### Proposal details\nSends ETH 2.7 to DAOESCO / DAO Palace MS - (0x19c3Dea98C46141aa5749dcc19f6f0eF4b2BE4B0)\n\nThis is also DAOESCO's Giveth receiving address.\nhttps://giveth.io/project/daoesco-dao-palace\n",

      "content": "This is a simple zodiac module and front end app that builds on the idea of daily spending limits with a managed allow list.\n\nIt's a great way to minimize governance around the small tasks. Good for DAOs that have done the hard work up front of building trust or for delegated teams managing a \"slush\" fund\n\nHow it works\nBasically a funded Safe and a daily allowance to anyone on the allow list. Allow list can be implemented in any on chain mechanic, a DAO, nft holders, govrn, hats., etc. All claims are transparently recorded through poster.sol so the allow list can be  audited/curated to remove cookie monsters. A cookie (daily limit per account) can be any size, native token or erc20.\n\nCo-Funded\nThis is also an experiment in co-funding. The proposal would be to co-fund a small DAO (RaidGuild, and DAOhaus have already shown support). Which funders receive loot (can ragequit in the event the project dies). The DAO structure also opens up to further decentralized development and retros for funders. \n\nProject is opensource, and being built in the open. A POC is being used for Gas refunds in DH and for small ops tasks in RG.\n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1019622975705726986/1100815988196380704",

      "title": "Fund Protocol Guild 1-year vesting contract with 10 ETH",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nProtocol Guild is a collective of 130 Ethereum core protocol contributors ‚ú® enabling distributed funding for distributed systems.\n\nThe have their own vesting contract setup to take donations, that vests over the course of 1 year:\nhttps://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3-smart-contract.html\n\nWe should fund this with 10 ETH\n\n## About Protocol Guild\n\nAttracting and retaining talented core protocol contributors is critical to the long-term success of Ethereum. Unfortunately, financial incentives for core protocol work are significantly lower than comparable work in the ecosystem. Think about it: how much would entities such as Google or Ava Labs pay to acquire the skills of an Ethereum core protocol developer? Or alternatively, how much token upside could a core dev get by working for an L2 like Arbitrum or Optimism? \n\nThe Protocol Guild was conceived to address these issues: to rebalance financial incentives in favor of core protocol work, by providing contributors with a way to indirectly participate in the success of the broader ecosystem, and incentivize continued contributions over the long term.\n\nThe Protocol Guild itself is a registry of members who are actively contributing to Ethereum's core protocol. Today the Guild has 128 members, including client & infra teams like EthereumJS, Geth and Teku, research orgs like the Robust Incentives Group, as well as coordination and support groups Ethereum Cat Herders. \n\n## Other Reasoning\nA 10 eth donation will still have a significant impact in building the social norm that projects built on Ethereum should help support the protocol they depend on. If every project donated a small amount, e.g. 1% of their tokens or treasury, then the Protocol Guild could become a long-term sustainable funding mechanism for Ethereum's core protocol work.\n\n",

The venue is also cannabis friendly, so we may have some pre-rolls to give out as well.\n\nWe can feature Public Nouns related content in our slideshow on the projector in the main room and on posters and digital materials for the event.\n\nAs people leave the event they will be offered the opportunity to take on an Impact quest, delivering pizza to the homeless of the city.

If a party goer does this, Giveth will give them a POAP and some swag üòÑ\n\nExpected duration or delivery date (if applicable):\nASAP, event rapidly approaching\n\nTeam Information (For Funding Proposals)\nPizzaDAO: https://twitter.com/pizza_dao\nSnax:\nDiscord: snax#6922\nhttps://twitter.com/snack_man\n\nSkills and previous experience in related or similar work:\nPizzaDAO has thrown the BIGGEST PIZZA PARTY IN THE WORLD, twice!

Because we need to **act fast to decrease global emissions** (by 40% before 2030) if we don‚Äôt want to overshoot the limit of 1.5Àö C set by the Paris agreement, a limit that is considered already catastrophic by the IPCC.\n2. Because we have an opportunity to **flip the narrative** vis a vis of naysayers and regulators, and **show that crypto is also a force for good**, and that decentralised technology can help better coordinate people and capitals around public goods\n3. Decarbonizing Ethereum-1 historical consumption and emissions would lead the conversation and **show the world and other industries what needs to be done**.\n\n### üí∏¬†Why does it need funding right now?\nwe're launching next week + to solve climate change we should have started acting yesterday.. or 10 years ago. Blocks.garden is accelerating adoption of provably green crypto now \n\n## üí•¬†Impact\n- üåø Public Nouns would actually be decarbonizing a % of Ethereum blocks (for the 16 blocks it would be making 224,64 MWh of Ethereum's historical emissions green)\n\n- üì£ this story will have huge repercussion and exposure across the crypto space and in traditional media too. The **story hooks strongly on 2 current hot debates, that of the climate crisis and the regulation of crypto:**\n\n- üí° owning a **permanent advertising space** in Blocks.garden Public nouns could **use it to  experiment visibility campaigns, advertise the current auction, or showcase projects it wants to amplify** (the content can be changed)\n\n## üöö¬†Deliverables\nPublic Nouns would get \n\n- **some Blocks NFTs** in the Day1-the Merge canvas, where to exhibit content,  probably in the public goods cluster near Nick Johnson of ENS, and Fracton Ventures (aka Public Nouns 24)\n- **some Green NFTs** (tokenized Renewable Energy Certificates) that prove green a certain amount of energy consumed by Ethereum 1 proof of work before the merge.\n-- green NFTs will **mark Public Nouns as a Green Hero**, give the DAO **governance rights** in this protocol and potentially in other public good contexts where we are going to push for adoption\n\n\n## ‚ôªÔ∏è¬†Feedback Loop\n¬†Blocks.garden aligns with and can **enhance the memetic nature of the (Public) Nouns model, because it‚Äôs inherently an advertising canvas** where to showcase the Public Nouns brand, the current PN live auction or any of the projects the DAO will manage to support.\n\n## üí∞¬†Amount in ETH\na soft vote in the [discord forum post](https://discord.com/channels/1019622975705726986/1038233255985557574) chose a 4x4 = 16 pixel size for 5 ETH frame",

      "content": "## Summary\n\nSocial Nouns is seeking 10 ETH to boost the development of its ecosystem in various ways. \n\nWe will transfer the funds from the Social Nouns multisig to a smart contract fund that will be able to bid on Social Nouns NFTs, which will then be transferred by the contract to the Public Nouns DAO.\n\nWe‚Äôll then create proposals from within Social Nouns for use of the funds to cover e.g. expenses and compensation for work. The contract has been more thoroughly explained here: https://prop.house/nouns/open-round:-12/2220 \n\nOur co-founder Martti Malmi is the first developer to work with Satoshi on Bitcoin in 2009-2011.\n\n## Social Nouns Mission\n\n- Be ‚Äúthe Front Page of Web3 Social‚Äù by providing various analytics and features on the landing page for anyone seeking information about the space.\n- Foster and facilitate the emergence of paradigm breaking decentralized social applications.\n- Nurture an environment supportive of rapid, parallel safe-to-fail experimentation (the source of true radical innovation) for open-source social protocols to collaborate and integrate with each other.\n\n## How does this initiative support Public Goods?\n\nSocial Nouns itself supports specific, vetted - open-source and decentralized social media protocols such as https://www.lens.dev/ and https://iris.to/.\n\n## Thesis\n\nHundreds of millions in investments have been committed into capturing the web3 social landmass via monetization by tokens. On the app side, that has yet to yield any earth shattering innovations, mostly incremental web2 skeuomorphism.\n\nTruly disruptive web3 social dapps will emerge from open networks, utilizing multiple protocols and as a result of democratically voted experiments within a collaborative ecosystem.\n\n## How is it non-excludable?\n\nFor a protocol to join Social Nouns, it currently requires a due diligence brief (main factors: open-source and fully decentralized), purchase of a Social Noun. The creation of a new head trait (often e.g. the logo of the protocol), and addition to the list of supported protocols: https://socialnouns.wtf/protocols\n## Why does it need funding right now?\n\nOur team has been working out of pocket for the past six months and covering all expenses on their own. We‚Äôre seeking to extend our runway and capabilities to develop the project further in order to support the ultimate public good: the emergence of a fully decentralized social media that is controlled and owned by the user.\n\nOne where you are not the product. The protocol is. The dapps are. A social media that doesn‚Äôt cancel ideas or police thought. Where you keep your privacy, pseudonymity and even anonymity if you so wish.\n\nA social media that is natively crypto, where profiles travel with you. Where you own everything you post. And can see the source code of the algorithms if need be. Ultimately even having a say in what gets developed, instead of that being a decision for the darkness of foundation grant committees.\n\nAll this needs to be created today, while it‚Äôs still possible.\n\n## Impact/Deliverables\n\nWork on SocialNouns.wtf front and the underlying Nouns protocol continues. Current priorities are:\n- Fully develop the smart contract fund so that Nounish DAOs can receive angel / seed investment easily while remaining a pure DAO.\n- Major evolution of the current analytics page, which is currently static and user feedback has already indicated that e.g. on-chain statistics / data is required https://socialnouns.wtf/analytics.\n- Continue the work toward building a decentralized alternative to Nounish DAO Discords. Because as a centralized tool, it‚Äôs currently a systemic risk for DAO communities. As having their communications channels pulled at any moment due to one corporate decision. We will be utilizing the Iris and Lens protocols in pursuing this.\n\n## References\n\nhttps://twitter.com/marttimalmi/status/1584498824759812098\nhttps://twitter.com/StaniKulechov/status/1595739983373078528 \nhttps://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/bitcoin-list/29/ \n\n## Links\n\nhttps://twitter.com/socialnouns \nhttps://socialnouns.wtf/\n\n\n\n\n## Documents\n\nDescription of the smart contract fund: https://prop.house/nouns/open-round:-12/2220 \n\nPlease refer to the Public Nouns Discord for a graphical deck ü•Çüçª\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThank you for reading and considering us!\nWith love, Social Nouns\n",

      "content": "## Summary \nCreate a student group focused on public goods with a specific set of outcomes and outputs. The goal is to bring together a group of students across blockchain clubs from around the world to help develop a reading list/seminar, host meetups, partake in ideation events or hackathons, and contribute to public good outputs such as reading lists, an open problem list, curricula, etc.\n\n## Problem to Solve\nThe main problem being solved is that there is no single mechanism coordinating learning and building attention around public goods. Conferences like Funding the Commons have created an opportunity for consistent interaction around public goods, but more focused community building is needed in order to actually capture the interest and attention beyond conferences and to convert that energy to actionable results and building. \n\nAdditionally, we need to onboard more students and academics into web3 and engage them through the development of public goods and provide opportunities for them to contribute to the positive impacts of web3. \n\n## Planned Activities \nThe focus for the first three months is:\n- Getting the first 8 active clubs onboarded \n- Setting up a reading group / open seminar series (host 4 by the end of February 2023)\n- Hire an intern from one of the clubs to help further plan the series / subsequent bullets \n- Set up a public goods meetup grant program focused on student groups \n- Plan an ideation focused event at Funding the Commons in late January 2023\n\nBeyond that, we want to focus on:\n- Plan and execute a 8+ week hackathon during Spring 2023 \n- Create a first draft of a ‚Äòopen problems in public goods‚Äô list that is then review/curated by experts \n- Create a list of relevant non-web3 academics to be invited to speak/join\n- Run consistent public good seminars \n- Integrate with SCRF web3 tooling experimentation (using Mercle, Otterspace, etc. to streamline academic onboarding into web3) \n\n## Funding Request \n5 ETH \n\n## State of the Project\nWe have mapped ~100 clubs internationally, started some initial outreach, and are working on securing funding for the first 3-6 months. Once we can secure the funding, we will start planning the first reading groups and start planning the ideation event. \n\nProtocol Labs has committed $35k if we can raise another $30k. Gitcoin has committed to $5k of support and we're waiting to hear back from EF and NEAR. Our goal is to coordinate this seminar group with all of the main players focused on public goods, which is why we're applying here. \n",
