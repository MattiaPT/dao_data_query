      "title": "Migrate USDC and USDT from Morpho Optimizers to Morpho Vaults",
      "content": "*This is a follow-up to [a previous proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/origingov.eth/proposal/0x8a126eb71bdfaee62fe3f3159ff85d99c3a0e1170ec86d9b9dfb3e5acf71d795) authored by [DegenSensei](https://snapshot.org/#/profile/0xcaF1798440e399AE16B7ee29aE4ed062B409B2ae).*\n\n## Summary\n\nApprove two new Morpho Vault strategies and authorize the Guardian to reallocate up to 100% of OUSD's USDC and USDT holdings from the current Morpho Aave Optimizer.\n\n## Background\n\nSince late 2022, OUSD has been accumulating token rewards by allocating USDC and USDT to Morpho. The existing strategies deposited stablecoins into the original Morpho Optimizers, which generated a yield premium through peer-to-peer matching and otherwise passed the funds through to Compound and Aave. After launching Morpho Blue, the optimizers are slowly being deprecated. The primary mechanism for encouraging capital to migrate has been the shift of MORPHO incentives from the optimizers to Morpho Vaults. As a result, OUSD is earning fewer MORPHO rewards and is actually unable to allocate new funds since deposits have been paused.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nOUSD currently holds 2,684,812 USDC and 1,867,153 USDT in its Morpho Optimizer Aave V2 strategy. This proposal would signal the DAO's approval for new Morpho Vault strategies and would authorize the Guardian (2 of 9 multi-sig) to fully migrate all current and future USDC and USDT deposits to Morpho by utilizing the following curated Vaults:\n\n- 0xBEEF01735c132Ada46AA9aA4c54623cAA92A64CB\n- 0xbEef047a543E45807105E51A8BBEFCc5950fcfBa\n\nFrom [DegenSensei](https://snapshot.org/#/profile/0xcaF1798440e399AE16B7ee29aE4ed062B409B2ae):\n\nI suggest we add the MetaMorpho vault to our whitelisted strategies and we move our funds to the MetaMorpho USDC vault that is curated by Steakhouse Finance. It takes moderate risk when it lends the funds to borrowers of assets with a lot of staying power, such as mainly wstETH and wBTC. These experience less volatility than the majority of the market and have a lot of liquidity available on DEXs making it easy to liquidate a position in case of emergency preventing bad debt.\n\nThere is currently $38,85M USDC supplied into the vault and the $2.68m Origin has supplied into Morpho Aave v2 would take it to $41.4M and bring the yield down from 7.93% to 7.41% which is still very lucrative for OUSD holders. Additionally, the value proposition here is that we want to continue accruing MORPHO rewards that we have previously done on Morpho Aave V2 before the conditions changed.\n\nWhile there are many interesting vaults on the platform, this one provides a good balance between deep liquidity which means that we aren't the dominant LP in the pool, and supplying capital to reliable assets.\n\nIn addition, we should also consider whitelisting the Steakhouse USDT vault as a MetaMorpho strategy. Although we are not planning to move funds directly into this vault, having it among our whitelisted strategies for USDT provides us with additional flexibility. The USDT vault that is curated by Steakhouse Finance has a similar risk profile to the USDC one, which focuses on assets with high staying power and deep liquidity. This would position us well to continue earning MORPHO rewards from this strategy in the future. The inclusion of this strategy would broaden our scope for potential yield opportunities while maintaining solid risk management.",

If we want to continue earning lucrative yields for OUSD we need to move our funds to a vault on MetaMorpho or another platform.\n\n## Background\n\nWe have had funds deposited in Morpho for a long time which has proven to be a reliable yield source for OUSD holders while we have been accruing additional MORPHO rewards as well. Considering the launch of Morpho Blue and MetaMorpho, the protocol has migrated the rewards from Morpho Aave to MetaMorpho instead which would mean that we wouldn't be earning any MORPHO rewards if our capital remained on Morpho Aave.\n\nI suggest we add the MetaMorpho vault to our whitelisted strategies and we move our funds to the MetaMorpho USDC vault that is curated by Steakhouse Finance. It takes moderate risk when it lends the funds to borrowers of assets with a lot of staying power, such as mainly wstETH and wBTC.

      "title": "Proposed Merger of primeETH into YieldNest ynLSD",
      "content": "![image](ipfs://bafybeibvrhjumd5bhtivct3ircvn5ynymujzojntq7l7e7snyiyqbnitbu)\n\n[Visit the YieldNest Governance forum for an easier-to-read version.](https://gov.yieldnest.finance/t/proposed-merger-of-primeeth-into-yieldnest-ynlsd/72/1)\n\n## Summary\n\nYieldNest aims to be the most community-centric LRT provider and is anticipating committing 60+% of its governance token, YND, to community incentives (e.g., airdrops, LP incentives, treasury, grants, etc.). YieldNest proposes a long-term partnership with Origin. As part of this partnership, the protocols would merge their respective LRT products, primeETH and ynLSD. primeETH users will be able to migrate their deposits to YieldNest’s ynLSD. YieldNest will allocate a significant amount of its upcoming governance token, YND, to the Origin community in multiple phases, rewarding both primeETH holders (retroactively and going forward) and OGN stakers (xOGN holders). Origin’s DeFi money legos (e.g., OETH) will become a backing asset of ynLSD, and the two core teams and communities will jointly promote each other’s products to grow their collective TVL.\n\nThrough this partnership, YieldNest aims to become the premier management and programmatic yield layer for restaked Origin Assets on Symbiotic, EigenLayer, and future restaking/DeFi protocols providing more utility to Origin assets throughout the DeFi landscape.\n\n## Background\n\nThe YieldNest team is working on new restaking primitives designed to provide users safe, secure, and easy restaking options across EigenLayer, Symbiotic, and upcoming restaking protocols. YieldNest wants to build the most community-centric LRT protocol. YieldNest anticipates that the total airdrop allocation will be 15% of the total supply of YND and aims to increase the amount allocated to airdrops contingent upon TVL increasing over time with a target of being one of the most generous airdrops to hit the market in the restaking vertical with community incentives anticipated to be over 60%.\n\nThe founding team has deep experience in DeFi and is backed by notable angels, including the founders of Curve (Michael Egorov), Convex (Winthorpe & C2TP), Frax (Sam Kazemian), Kyber (Loi Luu), Algorand (Steve Kokinos), Yearn, Moralis (Ivan on Tech), and others. YieldNest’s upcoming ynLSD and full product suite promise to be among the most innovative LRT protocols in the market. YieldNest is superior to existing LRT players due to its cutting-edge technology and risk-adjusted, opinionated deployment across isolated and curated AVS/Network baskets, resulting in higher yields.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreibfts57fr2agdh7jiu22mirr6mdtr2ranta5hm5onux4awtpdvk3i)\n\nThe Origin team believes that restaking is a powerful new paradigm for securing new decentralized protocols while providing new yield options for users. OETH is one of the accepted LSTs on EigenLayer, and primeETH was launched as Origin’s foray into the LRT space. The core Origin team believes that primeETH and its users will benefit from a merger with YieldNest that can be used to supercharge TVL growth while providing additional incentives for OETH holders. Origin is committed to accruing value to OGN and does not have plans to launch a new token for primeETH. The core team believes focusing on OETH and its upcoming L2 derivatives as building blocks within restaking will be a more effective strategy and will accrue more protocol revenue for OGN stakers (xOGN holders).\n\nThe Origin team has spent significant time and energy to find a suitable partner with a clear vision in the ever-evolving restaking landscape, in which YieldNest has emerged as the most capable and technologically advanced. YieldNest aims to become the premier management and programmatic yield layer for restaked Origin assets on Symbiotic, EigenLayer, and future restaking/DeFi protocols, providing more utility to Origin assets throughout the DeFi landscape.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeicmha2gnm3v67clkgzamiwohzft7zltaolvnqangwvn4fgn6kuyce)\n\nThe Origin and YieldNest teams are aligned in wanting to work together and create new innovations in the restaking landscape while driving significant value to both OGN and YND.\n\nThis proposal is being written by the CEO and co-founder of YieldNest, Amadeo Brands, with support from the Origin executive team.\n\n## Migration Proposal and Incentives\n![image](ipfs://bafybeigzcujlho7d6ztv7fozomoyuiu6jabjlg5vmuv3rt3zmwn3xa3rsi)\n\nIn the upcoming weeks, primeETH users will be able to migrate their underlying ETH and LSTs (e.g., OETH) to ynLSD via the primestaked.com DApp. They can stay in the protocol and start earning YieldNest seeds. At migration and at TGE, users will be eligible for a sizable amount of YieldNest incentives. primeETH users who migrate to ynLSD will get additional incentives and rewards.\n\nYieldNest’s ynLSD contracts will be audited by top-tier auditors ChainSecurity and yAudit.\n\n### Proposed Incentive Program\n\n#### primeETH Holders\n\n- **Exclusive PrimeStaked YND Retroactive Airdrop**\n  - A snapshot will be taken for PrimeStaked XP at the time that the migration to YieldNest goes live. primeETH will receive an airdrop on their pro rata share of YND at TGE based on how much PrimeStaked XP they have accrued at the time of the snapshot.\n  \n- **YND Airdrop Seasons (anticipated to be 15+% of the YND total supply)**\n  - Season 1 will commence at the time of migration, and users who migrate to ynLSD will be eligible to get their pro rata share of YND based on how much TVL they bring to the protocol. A minimum of 4% of YND total supply will be allocated to the Season 1 airdrop campaign.\n  - primeETH users will accrue YieldNest Seeds (YieldNest’s points program) over time as long as they continue restaking with YieldNest.\n  - YieldNest will increase the amount allocated to airdrops as TVL increases over time, with a target of being one of the most generous airdrops to hit the market in the restaking vertical, with community incentives anticipated to be over 60%.\n  \n- **Exclusive primeETH Seeds Boost**\n  - Users who migrate to ynLSD will receive a 5% Seeds Boost (YieldNest points program) at the commencement of the next season, which starts when the migration from primeETH to ynETH is open.\n  \n- **YieldNest Pioneer NFT**\n  - Users who migrate at least 5 OETH will get the exclusive YieldNest Pioneer NFT. This NFT provides a permanent 15% Seeds Boost and a fast-track into governance and opportunities to earn more rewards. Think of this as a whitelist NFT that will allow you to participate and earn more in the YieldNest ecosystem.\n\n#### OGN Stakers (xOGN holders)\n\n- YieldNest will allocate up to an additional 2.5% of YND total supply to xOGN holders, contingent on Origin and its community contributing TVL to YieldNest products. OGN stakers will be able to claim this YND allocation at TGE.\n\n## Voting Options\n\nxOGN stakers will be able to vote for or against this proposal. If the proposal passes, the YieldNest and Origin teams will launch the migration contracts that will allow users to convert primeETH to ynLSD. This will enable primeETH users to claim their YND tokens, additional benefits, and rewards as identified in the proposal. The two teams will engage in a deep partnership to ensure that both projects succeed.\n\nIf the proposal is rejected, we will seek community feedback to understand the objections and make adjustments for the two teams to re-engage to discuss alternative ways to partner.\n\nUsers who have specific feedback should feel welcome to message the core teams in Discord.",

      "title": "OGN Tokenomics ",
      "content": "## **Summary**: \nProposal to introduce improved tokenomics to OGN post-merger with OGV. \n\n## **Background**:\nThe proposed merger to absorb OGV into OGN saw two successful governance votes in recent weeks. The initial proposal to the OGN community was followed by another proposal to the OGV community. Both proposals have passed with overwhelming support, placing OGN at the core of Origin’s diverse multichain yield ecosystem. \n\nBased on the approved proposals, OGV holders and veOGV stakers will have 1 year to convert their holdings into OGN and xOGN, respectively. The approved exchange ratio was based on a snapshot of OGN and OGV on April 1, 2024 at 12:00AM UTC. At that time, OGN was trading at $0.21731 and OGV was trading at $0.01986.  Current holders of OGV will therefore be able to convert their OGV to OGN at the stated exchange ratio of 0.09137 OGN per OGV.\n\nWork is currently underway to create an interface that allows OGV holders to convert their tokens to OGN. Similarly, veOGV holders will be able to convert to xOGN to earn governance and economic rights. We will also allow users a one-time exit option on their staked positions to OGV without penalty for those OGV holders that do not wish to continue staking with OGN. \n\nBelow, we propose tokenomics changes and describe their impact on the OGN ecosystem. We also propose introducing new utility to OGN in the form of governance privileges and value accrual.\n\n## **OGN Supply**:\n\nOGN’s current circulating supply is 573,135,902 and the total supply is 1,000,000,000.\n\nTo absorb the total supply of OGV at the snapshot ratio of 0.09137 OGN per OGV, there will be a one-time mint of 409,664,846 OGN, bringing OGN’s total supply to 1,409,664,846. \n\nHowever, the vast majority of these minted tokens will not enter circulation. We anticipate approximately a 10% increase in circulating supply by the end of year one post-merger, leading to approximately 630M circulating OGN in May of 2025. This is well below initial projections that were published at the request of multiple exchanges in the past.\n\n- Upbit projections (https://static.upbit.com/guide/circulating_supply/OGN_20231205.pdf) - 703M estimated circulating tokens for April 2024 and 774M estimated circulating tokens for May 2025\n- Binance projections (https://www.binance.com/en/research/projects/origin) - 800M estimated circulating tokens for April 2024 (no estimate for May 2025)\n\nHistorically, the Foundation has sought to make ongoing token emissions more conservative than were originally allocated to Community incentives, liquidity mining, etc. In this case, we anticipate being well over 100M short of the projected circulating supply one year from the merger.\n\nThere are multiple reasons that circulating supply will only modestly increase over the next several years, despite the one-time increase in total supply.\n\n- Note that over 86.1% of OGV’s total supply is not part of the circulating supply. Circulating supply currently sits at 622,939,474 tokens. The remaining 3,874,032,143 of non-circulating OGV will convert to non-circulating OGN by default.\n- Next, we will be releasing a new staking contract that allows users to convert OGN to vote-escrowed OGN (xOGN). This program will grant governance and economic rights to xOGN holders. We anticipate that additional OGN that is currently circulating today will be locked up in the new staking contract, creating a powerful new token sink.\n- Finally, the Origin Treasury is further committing to locking any OGN and xOGN that it receives from the completed merger.\n\nThis token merger also presents us with an exciting opportunity to introduce improved tokenomics for OGN based on learnings and feedback we’ve received over the years from both OGV and OGN holders. Please see an outline of the proposed token utility below. \n\n## **Overview:**\nOGN will adopt a similar governance and value accrual mechanism as OGV currently has, including the ability to stake OGN for vote-escrowed OGN (xOGN) for governance and economic rights. As a result, OGN will become more decentralized and have increased utility.\n\n### New OGN/xOGN\n\n- **Buybacks:** In line with the previous OGV model, a 20% performance fee will be taken from yield earned on OETH and OUSD. Of that performance fee, half will be redistributed to OGN stakers. The other half will be used to acquire flywheel tokens such as CVX or CRV in order to generate additional yield for the protocol. In addition, as fees are added to Origin’s new products, such as primeETH and ARM, more protocol revenue will be accruing to OGN. It is the intention of the core team that our entire updated roadmap, including multi-chain OETH derivatives and LSTs for other EVM chains, will all accrue value to OGN.\n- **Staking rewards**: will be funded by the Origin Treasury and protocol revenue buybacks.\n- **Voting Power Curve:** The voting power and APY users earn for locking up OGN will have a flatter decay curve on OGN than it did on OGV. This will increase the rewards users earn for locking up tokens, even if they don’t max lock. The K factor will decrease from 1.8 to 1.4.\n- **Max Lock:** OGN holders will be able to lock their tokens for up to one year (compared to the previous 4 year max lock on OGV) and minimum of one month. Having analyzed OGV and other DeFi tokens, we believe a shorter max lock up will further incentivize stakers to participate, further decreasing circulating supply and increasing governance participation.\n- **Early Exit:** OGN will offer a novel “early exit” option for stakers (which wasn’t available with OGV) allowing them to exit a stake early but pay a penalty that will depend on the time left in the lockup. The penalty for unlocking OGN early will result in OGN being redistributed to current active OGN stakers.\n\n### Legacy OGV/veOGV\n\n- No new stakes will be allowed after the token migration goes live\n- All stakes will become unlocked. Users will be guided to migrate to OGN staking by converting their veOGV to xOGN.\n- Holders can continue to claim any accrued OGV rewards\n- New OGV staking rewards will be stopped when the migration contracts are deployed and audited (targeting end of May), encouraging users to migrate to OGN\n- There will be no more new buyback rewards on the OGV contract as all buybacks will now occur with OGN\n\nThe core team believes the merger will align Origin’s core team, open-source developers, and community members  under a single token, OGN, enabling all ecosystem participants to be focused and share in the same incentives going forward.\n\n## **Voting options**\n\nThis proposal has two options:\n\n- Accept: Move forward with the proposed tokenomics.\n- Decline: Do not move forward with the proposed tokenomics.\n\nVoters that are in favor of improved tokenomics under different conditions are encouraged to vote “Decline” and then provide comments and proposals for alternative mechanics.\n\nWhile these are the tokenomics proposals from the core team, the community may always choose to amend or update the tokenomics mechanics with future governance proposals.",

      "title": "Merge OGV into OGN",
      "content": "### Authors\n\nOrigin co-founders (Matthew Liu and Josh Fraser) and core team\n\n### Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to consolidate all of Origin’s suite of products and associated traction with a singular governance and value accrual token, OGN.\n\n- OGN will merge with OGV, combining the fully-diluted valuations of both tokens into one.\n- OGN will adopt a similar governance and value accrual mechanism as OGV, including the ability to stake OGN for vote-escrowed OGN for governance and economic rights (including OGN staking rewards). As a result, OGN will become more decentralized and have increased utility.\n- The Origin Treasury will lock all of its converted OGN (from OGV merger) to vote-escrowed OGN, ensuring that there won’t be a significant increase in OGN’s circulating supply in the near-term.\n- OGV holders and veOGV stakers will have 1 year to convert their holdings into OGN and vote-escrowed OGN respectively.\n- Origin’s core team, open-source developers, and community members will all be aligned under a single token, OGN, enabling all ecosystem participants to be focused and share in the same incentives going forward.\n- Origin’s core team, in addition to open-source developers and integration partners, will advance Origin’s products in an ambitious and compelling [2024 roadmap](https://www.originprotocol.com/proposal-to-merge-ogn-and-ogv).\n\n### Opportunity\n\nOrigin is doubling down on DeFi. Currently, OGV is the governance and value accrual token for Origin’s DeFi products. OETH, primeETH, and OUSD currently account for $200M of TVL and dozens of integrations and use cases across DeFi. \n \n![Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 2.54.23 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreiguxfeten5hid7zygd2ucgjaqcztg442bd5joqspzfb6avad5b2gq)\n    \nTVL and protocol revenue is expected to grow considerably as these products continue to gain traction. OETH and primeETH are very well-positioned to capitalize on the explosive restaking market (e.g. EigenLayer), perhaps the hottest narrative and most disruptive technology of this market cycle. Meanwhile, OUSD’s APY is in the double digits as DeFi lending rates increase, making it far more competitive than US treasuries and other competitive products.\n\nCurrently, OGV’s [market cap is $10.8M](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/origin-defi-governance). When looking at comparable market caps in DeFi, OGV appears to be an outlier. Multiple community members and crypto researchers have noticed this fundamentals mispricing.\n \n![Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 2.57.36 PM.png](ipfs://bafybeihllnhherhaa5sphysmmu7fhtthlnarjawhkrm3lqiv4z2t2fiu6i)[X.com post from @InfoSpace](https://twitter.com/InfoSpace_OG/status/1771071763495182434)\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 3.00.53 PM.png](ipfs://bafybeigoq7zqpb2zgsjsetvg4yvqrluj7tzupvebmliqj6r7a7pykgx5kq)[X.com post from @Flowslikeosmo](https://x.com/Flowslikeosmo/status/1771175177864519756?s=20)\n\nOGV appears to be mispriced for at least several reasons:\n\n- The ratio between the market cap of OGV and the amount of capital it controls is significantly below other similar DeFi projects.\n- OGV holders govern over $1M of protocol-owned CVX.\n- 2.3% of all distributed MORPHO tokens have been awarded to protocols governed by OGV. This can be a huge windfall for the Origin community as Morpho is a rising DeFi protocol with $1.2B of TVL.\n\nWe and many community members believe it is time to merge OGN and OGV and capitalize on these catalysts that can help a combined token perform better than two separate tokens.\n\nThrough this proposed merger, OGN holders would benefit from 9-figures of TVL and consistent and growing protocol revenues being directed to OGN. OGV holders will benefit from holding a highly liquid token that is trading on all major exchanges and will join the OGN community that has hundreds of thousands of community members in all regions of the world. Both sets of stakeholders will benefit from a clear vision/narrative and focused and aggressive product roadmap. The Origin core team will benefit from having less overhead of interacting with two tokens and communities, allowing us to be more singularly focused in doing our part to drive value capture to OGN with a powerful DeFi ecosystem and Super DApp for all of Origin’s products.\n\nFurthermore, we’ve recently seen the market react positively to other token mergers and migrations that consolidate product traction and value accrual to single tokens. For example, the Frax (FXS, FPIS) merger, Ribbon to Aevo migration, and MeritCircle to Beam migration have all been positively received by the respective communities.\n\n### Mechanics\n\nWe took a snapshot of OGN and OGV at April 1, 2024 12:00AM UTC. At that time, OGN was trading at $0.21731 and OGV was trading at $0.01986. Therefore, we propose that 1 unit of OGV will convert to 0.09137 OGN in the merger. \n\nTotal token supply was [4,483,581,550](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9c354503c38481a7a7a51629142963f98ecc12d0) and [1,000,000,000](https://etherscan.io/token/0x8207c1ffc5b6804f6024322ccf34f29c3541ae26) for OGV and OGN respectively. OGV’s FDV was $89.0M while OGN’s FDV was $217.31M. This proposal aims for a value accretive merger, combining the two tokens for a FDV of approximately $306.31M. \n\nTo do this, the protocol would perform a one-time mint of 409,664,846 OGN to fully absorb all OGV. The vast majority of these minted tokens will not enter circulating supply.\n\n- Note that over 85.7% of OGV’s total supply has not yet entered circulation, with circulating supply currently at 640,579,154 tokens. 3,843,002,396 of non-circulating OGV will convert to non-circulating OGN.\n- In addition, of the 640,579,154 OGV tokens in the circulating supply, approximately 80% is currently locked as veOGV for up to 4 years. This further reduces near and mid-term circulating supply for OGN.\n- Finally, the Origin Treasury is further committing to locking any OGN and vote-escrowed OGN that it receives from a successful merger.\n\nTotal OGN supply will increase to 1,409,664,846 OGN, with the vast majority of the increased supply being locked and non-circulating.\n\nCurrent holders of OGV will be able to convert their OGV to OGN at the stated exchange ratio of 0.09137 OGN per OGV. veOGV holders can convert directly to vote-escrowed OGN to earn governance and economic rights. Or, they can choose to exit their staked positions to OGV without penalty. There will be a one-year limit for converting OGV and veOGV. \n\nWe will also work with the 8 centralized exchange partners who have listed OGV to figure out the best migration path if/when this proposal passes. The core team will no longer support OGV with products, token utility, or liquidity at the time of the merger. We welcome members of the community to continue to develop products for OGV if they desire.\n\n### Voting options\n\nThis proposal has two options:\n\n- Move forward with the proposed OGN and OGV merger\n- Keep the status quo and do not move forward with the proposed OGN and OGV merger\n\nVoters that are in favor of a merger under different conditions are encouraged to vote No and then provide comments and proposals for alternative mechanics.\n\n### Next steps\n\nIf the proposal does not pass, the core team will continue building out OGN and OGV and their respective products separately.\n\nIf the proposal passes, we anticipate members of the OGV community to vote on whether to accept or reject the merger proposal from the OGN side. If that second proposal passes on the OGV side, the core team will begin development work to enact a value accretive and successful token merger.\n\nConcurrently, the core team will also continue building new products for Origin’s ambitions and ecosystems. Look out for blog and social media posts in the near future providing more context about our yield-bearing tokens going multi-chain and the launch of a new Origin product, ARM.",

      "title": "Increase staking rewards for OGN staking",
      "content": "This proposal aims to increase the attractiveness of the OGN staking program with subsidized ETH and/or OGN for Season 3 of OGN staking beginning on March 8th. The goal is to increase the effective APY and total amount of OGN staked (currently 56M). \n\nCurrently, approximately 11% of circulating supply is staked, and we’d like to increase this number over time. Higher staking participation leads to better tokenomics and a healthier ecosystem.\n\nThe NFT market is rapidly changing. In recent weeks, there has been an aggressive push by competing marketplaces to lower marketplace transaction fees and also cut creator royalties. Blur has introduced 0% marketplace transaction fees and a 0.5% royalty. They have gained considerable market share while focusing on growth first over monetization. Opensea has similarly followed suit with promotional pricing.\n\nAt Origin, we are pro-creator. We believe that this is an opportune time to gain market share with Opensea and Blur commoditizing their supplier base of NFT artists, PFP projects, and other creators. We’ve received a ton of inquiries from new prospective partners that want to stand up their own marketplaces on Origin Story that respect creator royalties and that  enhance their brand, artwork, and collector experiences. \n\nHowever, to gain market share at this critical time, one of our key team members has proposed a reduction in marketplace transaction fees for the next 3 months. \n\nhttps://vote.story.xyz/#/proposal/0x5aaf411d871c540a46456a1979c9d2a2ddc74c6b47c301c60f087eb7912c4a50\n\nIf that proposal passes, we will have a short-term reduction of platform revenues that would otherwise have been awarded to OGN stakers.\n\nWe want to ensure the OGN staking program continues to grow; therefore, we should allocate ETH and/or OGN that would have otherwise been used to grow the protocol (e.g. marketing budget, community incentives, sales commissions) in the quarter to the staking program instead.\n\nIf this proposal passes, we invite the community and other team members to submit more specific proposals on ETH and/or OGN budget to allocate into the pool. For example, we may see follow-on proposals to add a fixed weekly amount of OGN to the pool or to target a specific APY for the pool.\n",

      "title": "Reduce Story marketplace fees on native transactions to 0% until June 1, 2023",
      "content": "Since launching its branded marketplace platform in 2022, dozens of popular NFT collections (including Pudgy Penguins, 0n1Force, Moonrunners, Karafuru, 247 Comics, and many more) with vibrant communities have launched and operated their official marketplaces through Origin Story. Communities and creators have praised the marketplace product for its security, user experience, innovative features, and creator-friendly approach. Transaction volume has been growing – including landmark transactions like the record 400 ETH sale of a rare Pudgy Penguin (facilitated through our marketplace aggregator) and sales of real-world properties in partnership with Roofstock onChain – which is a testament to the growing interest and trust in the platform. However, trading market share is low relative to the huge potential of this platform. We believe there is a huge opportunity to gain market share for Story, as a creator- and collector-friendly NFT marketplace platform that is a compelling alternative to general marketplaces like OpenSea and Blur.\n\nOver the last few months, NFT marketplaces have been aggressively cutting fees (including marketplace fees and creator royalties) as they compete for market share. Notably, marketplace aggregator Blur has significantly grown market share by charging 0% marketplace fees and 0.5% minimum creator royalty (with user option to increase). In response, OpenSea announced they would change marketplace fee to 0% for a limited time and make full creator royalties optional. Many NFT creators’ businesses have been disrupted by these decisions by centralized NFT marketplaces. Many NFT creators have spoken out against the move to optional royalties, and have cited Origin Story as an attractive alternative for web3 brands to create their own official marketplaces (examples: https://twitter.com/RooTroopNFT/status/1629265617399459840 and https://twitter.com/notalexlin/status/1628924150218919939). There is no better time to double down on our approach. The Story Core Team is fielding an increasing number of conversations with NFT creators (many of whom have top volume collections) that are excited by Story’s marketplace solution. We believe creators will be increasingly incentivized to use Story to enforce creator royalties and drive their audience to transact on Story marketplaces.\n\nThis proposal’s objective is to grow adoption, reach, and usage of Story’s branded marketplace platform by simplifying pricing structure and reducing pricing for a limited period of time. This promotional pricing will apply to large scale web3 NFT collections (e.g., 10K PFP collections) using the Story platform.\n\nCurrent marketplace transaction fees: \n* Marketplace fees: 1.25% (Story’s fee) + additional fees (defined by the creator)\n* Creator royalties: fully honored (defined by the creator)\n\nProposed marketplace transaction fees:\n* Marketplace fees: 0% (until June 1, 2023)\n* Creator royalties: fully honored (defined by the creator)\n\nWe believe this promotional pricing will drive more creators to launch marketplaces with Story, and drive more end users to transact on Story.\n\nIf this proposal passes, the Story platform will implement this promotional pricing, work with creator teams to promote usage of the marketplace, and facilitate increased marketplace launches with new partners.\n\nThis proposal would mean a reduction in Story platform fees going to the OGN staking rewards pool during the promotional period. A separate community proposal to be published soon will recommend incentives and bonus rewards to OGN stakers to compensate for the expected reduction in OGN staking rewards. We encourage the community to put forward ideas on additional incentives and token utility. \n\nWe believe Story should focus on creating long-term, sustainable value for the platform and token holders, instead of focusing on near-term fee generation. We have seen industry examples of successful token performance for marketplace protocols despite the lack of protocol fee generation. Notable examples include Uniswap and Blur ($BLUR token), both of whom currently have 0% protocol fees.\n\nIn upcoming proposals and announcements, we will share more detailed proposals for increasing usage of the marketplace through major features and trading incentives, as well as proposals for new OGN token utility and sinks.

Now that Origin's two products have their own governance tokens and distinct roadmaps, it makes sense to transition from this single space to separate spaces for each.\n\nWe are specifically proposing to move OUSD governance to a newly created space (snapshot.org/#/ousdgov.eth), which will require participants to hold veOGV, the vote-escrowed representation of staked OGV. The minimum threshold for new proposals has been set to 10,000 veOGV and the quorum requirement will be 10,000,000 veOGV.\n\nThe new space will primarily serve as the venue for our weekly strategy allocation vote, which allows interested stakeholders to determine how OUSD's backing funds are allocated across our three preapproved yield strategies. We will soon be launching an on-chain, binding vote portal at governance.ousd.com, but some governance actions are infeasible on-chain.

      "title": "Temporarily reduce OUSD's exposure to Tether?",
      "content": "Given the continued market volatility and circulating questions around Tether, this proposal is to reduce OUSD's exposure to USDT temporarily. \n\nUsers have been voting with their feet, with around 16 billion dollars exiting Tether over the last 2 months (with most of it moving to USDC). We were reminded with the recent depegging of stETH that it's not enough to be fully backed. There also needs to be enough liquidity to meet redemptions. We know that some percentage of USDT backing is held in illiquid long-term bonds and some volatile assets that may be currently underwater. \n\nWe are also hearing rumors of coordinated attacks against Tether, that could increase the risk of a liquidity squeeze (https://twitter.com/WatcherGuru/status/1541473040847994883?s=20&t=G1HS4M0L29AGwkp4bu4LqQ).\n\nMaking sure users' funds are safe is always the #1 priority. Out of an abundance of caution, we are proposing we temporarily sit out of USDT until we have more transparency into assets that are backing USDT.\n\nSpecifically, the core team at Origin are proposing:\n1. A one-time swap out of USDT into USDC or DAI (100% of holdings)\n2. Granting the Strategists permission to continue divesting future USDT holdings if deemed prudent given market conditions.\n3. Continuing to include USDT as a backing asset for now.\n\nOUSD already has depeg protection that protects the vault in case any of our backing assets lose their peg. We have additional code already written and waiting to be deployed that will ratchet up our paranoia to prevent OUSD from being minted with any asset that is currently off its peg.\n\nTo be clear, we are suggesting this move simply as a precaution. We don't have any inside information about the internal state of Tether and do not want to cause panic. For now, we recommend that USDT continue to be supported as a backing asset of OUSD.",

      "content": "10% of OUSD's yield is currently held by the protocol and then used to automatically buy OGN on Uniswap.\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/originbuyback.eth#tokentxns\n\nWith the introduction of OGV as the new governance token for OUSD, there will no longer be a direct relationship between OUSD and OGN. It's also likely that veOGV holders may prefer that fees accrue to them directly rather than indirectly through token buybacks.\n\nAs we prepare for the launch of OGV, I propose that the 10% service continue to accumulate OUSD in the buyback contract (originbuyback.eth) but that the automated OGN swapping be disabled. If this proposal passes, the buyback should be disabled prior to the OGV airdrop on July 12, 2022.\n\nIt's worth noting that, when the buyback contract was initially deployed, it accumulated OUSD for 19 days before the first automated swap to OGN occurred. Similarly today, the OUSD balance in this contract should continue to grow and then a subsequent proposal can determine how those funds should be used.",

      "title": "Distribute NFT platform revenues to OGN stakers?",
      "content": "Origin Story, our NFT platform, has powered multiple record-breaking, multi-million dollar drops and is now open to the general public. We’ve been scaling the product and making headlines with continued success, but until now, there has never been a direct tie between the platform’s growth and OGN.\n\nFor example, our recent Lucky Ducky drop grossed 604 ETH ($2.04M at current ETH price of $3,388) in 15 minutes. The Story platform fee of 7.5% accounts for $153,476 that is currently collected by the company. Despite generating millions in revenue (e.g. 3LAU’s $11.7M, Metacask’s $2.3M, and many others) over the last year, OGN holders have only indirectly benefited from Story's success, which came in the form of token buybacks. It's evident that the market has undervalued and overlooked OGN for this reason, and our community has been clear in asking for more direct forms of utility and value accrual. \n\nThis proposal’s objective is to create a decentralized and direct value accrual mechanism between Story and OGN, additionally creating a powerful and concise narrative for why token holders should buy, hold, and stake OGN.\n\nIf this proposal passes, the team will build new smart contracts that will trustlessly and automatically direct 100% of on-chain platform fees from the Story platform to new OGN staking smart contracts. These fees include primary sale fees as well as future secondary marketplace and royalty fees. OGN stakers will be able to collect their share of protocol fees based on how much OGN they have staked relative to the entire pool of OGN stakers.\n\nOGN stakers will also be able to stake their OGN to multiple pools, akin to DeFi yield farms, including a platform-wide pool and individual collection pools. Using the Lucky Ducky example, we can imagine 50% of fees, or 302 ETH, being directed to the overall platform pool (which aggregates fees from all Story drops) and the other 50% of fees being directed to the Lucky Ducky pool. Actual percentages can be set via governance votes.\n\nOGN stakers who want a simple and diversified return on the Story platform will want to stake to the platform pool. This means that they benefit from all Story drops, including Lucky Ducky but also the many others that will happen concurrently or over time. Of course, it is likely that this pool will be the most crowded. OGN stakers who are especially bullish on Lucky Ducky (as an example) doing well in the primary and secondaries may find that they are able to generate higher returns by staking to that individual pool if other stakers aren’t participating. This also incentivizes these stakers to further evangelize the Lucky Ducky drop since they can directly benefit from the project’s success. This creates a win-win between the creator and OGN stakers.\n\nIf this proposal is approved, we will rapidly begin working on upgrading OGN token utility and our staking contracts as well as the Story NFT contracts:\n- When creators launch new NFT collections on Story by deploying their own smart contracts, the ensuing mint proceeds will be split between the creator and the protocol. \n- The protocol fees will be withdrawable by new OGN staking contracts, effectively funding the staking pools. Importantly, the entire flow of funds will occur on-chain in a permissionless fashion that does not involve the Origin team or treasury. The Origin team will contribute the initial code, but the smart contracts will be responsible for distributing funds to stakers. When complete, creators will be launching their own NFT smart contracts with the community of OGN holders staking to pools of their choosing.\n- It’s worth mentioning that we will deprecate our old OGN staking program currently at www.ousd.com/stake. All existing stakers will still get their rewards, but we will prevent new stakers from using the old program after a brief grace period if this proposal passes.\n\nWe are eager to get community feedback on this proposal. The core team is very excited about creating this new value accrual mechanism for the OGN community and creating the virtuous flywheel between Story and OGN.\n",

      "title": "Should be OGN in BNB Chain?",
      "content": "BNB Chain = Binance Smart Chain (BSC)\n\nOrigin Protocol has currently closed the door to other blockchains to their project and it is concerning to all holders. It should be noted that not only whales holding a currency cannot have a voice and vote in a space such as \"Snapshot\". This is why an alternative blockchain with low transaction costs plays such an important role.\n\nTo define itself as a project with plans to unveil the power of governance, this is a great time to demonstrate it.\n\nOne of the many problems facing society is that centralized exchanges (CEXs) are being banned or expelled from many countries because they simply do not follow their laws. It is there, where holders seek refuge in a blockchain and thus avoid being censored.\n\nOne of the solutions for this case is to allow OGN to be integrated to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC)\n\nWhy?\n\n1. The level of credibility that the Binance team has managed to build around the world is no secret to anyone, in addition to the fact that it is the project that allowed the listing of OGN in the first instance in a CEX.\n2. BSC has some of the best Automatic Market Makers (AMM) / Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) such as PancakeSwap, ApeSwap, DODO, Beefy.finance, and others.\n3. Very low transaction fees. This would allow OGN holders to transfer their funds from other centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Kucoin, Huobi, Crypto.com, Gate.io, etc.\n4. The developers have established various cross-chain bridges so that BSC users can easily move tokens from one blockchain network to another. Binance Bridge currently supports more than 40 tokens. This allows users to move assets like USDT, ETH, and many other tokens to and from Binance Smart Chain with ease. “For the long term if OGN is allowed to launch on other blockchains, this would be key to transferring and buying OGN without touching centralized exchanges.”",

      "title": "A New Chapter for Origin - The Dshop Platform; Decentralized eCommerce",
      "content": "For all of those new to Origin, this proposal is focused on the original flagship product from Origin; the DShop Platform.  This was a revolutionary project which saw the successful launch of a decentralized ecommerce store on the Ethereum Blockchain.  \n\nOrigin announced in late 2021 the decentralized governance for Origin has begun a new community initiative that will open a new chapter for Dshop.  DShop is a ready made eCommerce platform that works on the Ethereum Blockchain and the IPFS decentralized web.  It’s one of the leading decentralized solutions for ecommerce that is fully functional.\n\nDShop Platform GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/OriginProtocol/dshop\n\nWe strongly believe that Origin’s DShop Platform could be a leading decentralized eCommerce solution if we foster community members to propose and vote for improvements through our Governance Portal hosted on Snapshot. \n\nIn this proposal, we ask for the Origin community to approve the funding of Gitcoin bounties, as originally outlined by the Origin Team.\n\nOrigin Blog Post:\nhttps://blog.originprotocol.com/a-new-chapter-for-dshop-giving-control-to-the-community-12e8ec7ee5ca\n\nAs part of this new chapter, we would request the approval of funding to setup GitCoin bounties for all 34 open bugs pending on GitHub for DShop.  This proposal would ensure that the DShop platform can be used by anyone in the community to launch their own DShop store with 3rd party hosting on AWS, Google Cloud or IPFS using services like Pinata.  \n\nCurrently, due to IPFS restrictions DShop is not working for any other hosting option outside of the origin.app domain.  This is the priority bug fix to put to a vote on our governance portal.   \n\nWe propose a bounty via governance for these 34 GitHub issues, as a sign of good faith from the Origin team to continue the development of the DShop Platform. \n\nAs Origin have set aside an initial budget of $1M for community grants, this will hopefully be the starting point for the community to support the DShop Platform by providing bounties to any developer looking to work on DShop so the community can launch their own stores with an independent IPFS Pinata account.  \n\nThis proposal is a call to the community to revive our support for the DShop Platform and ensure that further development is incentivized for the community to get involved.  In order for this to happen, we need to bring together community developers and ensure that this code base can work independently of the origin.app domain.\n\nIn the near future, we can envision DShop launching on multiple blockchain platforms to reduce and eliminate high gas fees, therefore making decentralized ecommerce a realistic option.  But first, we need to ensure that the DShop Platform is being supported by Origin and handed over to the community.\n\nWe’d like to thank Franck, Mike Shultz and Rajath specifically for continuing the DShop Platform forward - it’s up to us the community to now keep this open source project evolving.\n\nWant to get involved?  Join our DShop Community Group, please register your interest here: \nhttps://bit.ly/Origin-Dshop \n\nPlease vote to support this proposal to ensure the community is taking a leading role in writing DShop’s next chapter.\n",

      "title": "Launch new governance token for OUSD? ",
      "content": "Origin has two separate product lines, Origin Dollar and Origin Story, that have both found product-market fit and are doing extraordinarily well. We believe they both deserve to have their own tokens with clear value accrual mechanisms that are clear and easy to articulate. Launching a new governance token for OUSD will maximize both short-term and long-term token holder value for existing OGN holders and new token holders alike.\n\nOur yield-bearing stablecoin, Origin Dollar (OUSD) has grown to hundreds of millions of dollars in circulating supply. OUSD continues to be the best risk-adjusted stablecoin strategy on the market today. OUSD has regularly outperformed other stablecoin strategies, despite being the simplest and most gas-optimized way to get access to competitive DeFi yields. We're also thrilled by the recent increase in institutional interest around OUSD from family offices, corporate treasuries, crypto funds, DAOs, and even other protocols starting to look at holding OUSD on their balance sheets. We expect this trend to continue as we double down on our BD efforts, integrate with more DeFi protocols and centralized exchanges, and restart incentives.\n\nSimilarly, our NFT platform has been experiencing incredible growth. Just in the past month, Paris Hilton has promoted Origin on Jimmy Fallon and Nightline and Pablo Picasso's great-grandson teamed up with John Legend to drop their NFTs on the Origin platform. These successes follow multiple record-breaking sales like 3LAU's $11.7M sale, the Inspiration4/SpaceX partnership which sold over 63k NFTs in a single drop, and the Charlie Bit Me NFT that made headlines around the world. Our NFT platform, Origin Story, recently opened up to all creators around the world, and we expect usage to scale exponentially. We are also more excited than ever about our near-term product upgrades that will focus on generating more secondary transaction volumes that can accrue protocol fees to OGN token holders.\n\nWith the OGN rewards given out on Curve and Convex, we've seen the power of incentives to drive adoption of Origin Dollar. It has become increasingly clear a native token for OUSD will allow us to offer more generous rewards and increase our growth rate. Ultimately, we want to see the circulating supply of OUSD measured in the billions of dollars.\n\nDespite the tremendous customer traction, global press mentions, and maturation of our products, the price of OGN has struggled since our ATH price in April of last year. Besides the obvious impact of bearish macro trends in the last few months, we also attribute OGN’s lackluster performance to the confusing narrative from having OGN represent two completely separate products that appeal to very different audiences. OGN holders are clamoring for clearer utility, value accrual, and updated tokenomics for both projects. It’s been a struggle to implement proper DeFi token utility while being mindful of OGN's role as the value accrual and utility token for Origin Story. As a result, we have a token that is used for both products but is failing to do a good job at either. In this case, the sum of the parts has been less than the individual parts. It is time to give both protocols the best chance of being top performers in the rest of 2022 and beyond. \n\nWe are early in our planning but we are eager for community feedback early in this process. Here’s our current thinking:\n\n1. Assuming community approval, a new ERC20 token, OGV will be launched as the new governance and fee accrual token for OUSD.\n\n2. OGV will be claimable by OGN holders on a 1:1 basis via a Merkle-distributor contract (similar to how Uniswap distributed UNI). If you have 100 OGN, you’ll be able to claim 100 OGV. This includes OGN holders who are currently staking OGN. We will work with centralized exchanges to make sure their OGN holders also receive OGV.\n\n3. Having a native token for OUSD will let us provide rewards directly to current and future OUSD holders and liquidity providers. This will further incentivize protocol growth and adoption.\n\n4. OGV will be the governance token for Origin Dollar via a veOGV mechanism (similar to Curve) that distributes economic and voting power to those most committed to the long-term success of the protocol. veOGV stakers will be able to set protocol fees as a percentage of yield, determine asset allocation, propose new strategies, etc.\n\nWhile the exact details need to be ironed out, the core team is aligned that this proposed strategy is in the best interests of all OGN holders as we seek to 10x and 100x user growth across both products. With each step forward, we will be conscious to take in community feedback with the goal of maximizing token value.\n\nIt should be noted that other projects have successfully gone through similar transitions. We’re watching as Gnosis launches tokens for Cowswap (COW) and Gnosis Safe (SAFE) on top of their original token GNO. We watched the BOBA airdrop to all OMG holders and observed how the combined market cap of both projects is higher today than it was before the airdrop (despite a massive market correction to both tokens). In short, we believe having separate tokens for each product will deliver a better outcome for all current OGN holders, resulting in holders now having two tokens that each have clear narratives, utilities, and value accrual mechanisms, priming them for positive growth.\n\nThis is obviously a huge decision and we welcome community input. Please join us in Discord (https://www.originprotocol.com/discord) where we will be discussing this proposal in our #governance channel.\n",

This will also make it possible for harvests to occur more frequently, which will lead to a smoother APY. Harvests are incentivised by dividing a share of the reward token proceeds with the caller of the harvest function. The percentage share of reward tokens awarded to the caller is configured on a per-strategy basis:\n\nCompound strategy: 1%\nAave strategy: 1%\nConvex strategy: 1%\n",

      "title": "Reduce the OUSD exit fee from 0.5% to 0.25%",
      "content": "This proposal is to reduce the exit fee on OUSD to 0.25%. This will help keep our AMM pools balanced and ensure OUSD trades closer to its $1 peg, increasing confidence in OUSD.\n\nCurrently, a 0.5% exit fee is charged when the underlying stablecoins are redeemed from the OUSD vault. This fee is distributed as additional yield to the remaining holders of OUSD, rewarding long-term holders over short-term participants. Importantly, the exit fee serves as a security feature to prevent attackers from taking advantage of lagging oracles to siphon stablecoins from the vault in the event of mispriced underlying assets. \n\nThe 0.5% percentage was chosen to match Chainlink's deviation threshold for the USDT/USD and USDC/USD oracles. The deviation threshold represents how much the price can change before Chainlink nodes will update the price onchain. Chainlink have communicated their intent to lower their deviation thresholds to 0.25% for the USDT/USD, USDC/USD, DAI/USD oracles. Once Chainlink updates the oracles, we will be able to safely reduce our exit fee to match. We won't execute any changes until after the deviation thresholds have been updated. \n\nYou can check the status of the relevant oracles below:\n\nhttps://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/usdt-usd\nhttps://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/usdc-usd\nhttps://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/dai-usd\n\nThe high exit fee deters holders from redeeming with the vault even when demand falls. Currently, the price of OUSD needs to fall below $0.995 before it makes economic sense for arbitrageurs to redeem OUSD with the vault. This leads to AMM's occasionally becoming unbalanced like our Curve pool is right now. This also leads to the price of OUSD straying further from $1 than we would like. Since redemptions are a revenue generator for the protocol, we are okay with more frequent redemptions, especially if they lead to a healthier overall market. \n\nWhile this proposal will likely lead to a temporary decrease in our circulating supply, I believe it will be better for OUSD long term. We want people to stay in OUSD because it's awesome, not because we're locking them in with a high exit fee.\n",

      "content": "Hello all,\n\nAs some of you may be aware, the Dshop Solution on AWS Marketplace [“Marketplace Solution”] is currently unavailable to new customers (https://github.com/OriginProtocol/dshop/issues/1011). To bring it back online, AWS requires our product to comply with their security policies, one of which states that it \"must not request or use access or secret keys from users to access AWS resources\".\n\nAs per the code published on the `master` branch of DShop, shop admins can choose to use the AWS S3 storage service to store their shop data. To enable us to (programatically) create S3 buckets on shop admins' behalf, we request that they submit their AWS accessKeyId and AWS secretKey [“AWS credentials”] to the DApp when configuring their super-admin account. It appears as though AWS Marketplace’s security policies will not allow us to store these credentials, even if they are encrypted. Publishing an updated Marketplace Solution that’s compliant with AWS policies will therefore necessitate that we make a few key decisions.\n\nWho will we support?\n\nConsider these two points:\n- A new shop admin may or may not use the Dshop Marketplace Solution to launch their shop.\n- They may or may not choose to use Amazon S3 Storage service to store their shop data.\n\nTo help bring the Marketplace Solution back, I request your help in deciding who Origin/the Dshop team should officially support:\n\nA shop admin who\n1) Launches their shop using the AWS Marketplace Solution AND wants to use Amazon S3 for storage \n2) Launches their shop using the AWS Marketplace Solution, but will use a 3rd party service for storing shop data (IPFS, Google Cloud Platform [“GCP”])\n3) Launches their shop using a 3rd party solution (ex. GCP), but wants to use Amazon S3 for storage\n4) Launches their shop using a 3rd party solution (ex. GCP) AND intends to use a 3rd party service for storing shop data (IPFS, GCP) \n\nPlease vote for the choice(s) that correspond to the 4 options above. ",

      "title": "Remove the withdrawal buffer from OUSD",
      "content": "OUSD currently has a withdrawal buffer where a small portion of backing funds are held in the vault instead of being deployed into underlying strategies. Today, 543,161.37 (0.5%) stablecoins are sitting idle not doing anything. This is hurting the APY for all OUSD holders. \n\nThe original idea of the buffer was to allow people to redeem OUSD without having to pay so much in gas costs. However, since adding intelligent price routing to the OUSD DApp, redemptions have become exceedingly rare. Given the depth of liquidity for OUSD, it's almost always a better deal to sell your OUSD to an AMM than pay the 0.5% exit fee. By removing the withdrawal buffer we can simplify our code, reduce the gas costs for mints, and slightly increase the APY for all OUSD holders. \n\nBy removing the buffer, redemptions will cost more gas since they will require actually withdrawing funds from the underlying strategies. I think this is an acceptable tradeoff as we should always prioritize the experience of OUSD holders instead of people exiting the protocol.\n\nI'd propose we remove the buffer in two steps. Assuming this proposal passes, we would first set the buffer to zero. Then later when we get a chance, we should clean up the code to remove the buffer logic altogether.",

However, when a DShop customer reaches the 'Checkout' page, they may not see icons corresponding to the ERC-20 tokens configured for payment. Despite there being little resistance to the idea of displaying token images, there is no clarity on where we might get these token images from.\n\nSpecifically speaking, a solution to the above-mentioned issue was offered via https://github.com/OriginProtocol/dshop/pull/852. As noted, I authored code to fetch token images from one of two sources: \n1) TrustWallet's Github repository\n2) Ethereum Lists\n\nAlthough a community member was concerned that sourcing images from a Github repository is introducing a \"dependency\", I stand by what I said in the thread -- having A solution is better than having NONE. Moreover, our reliance on a centralized resource like TrustWallet is alleviated by having Ethereum Lists (a decentralized alternative) as a 'fallback'. With us having the ability to display images for over 6000 unique tokens right now, I question whether we really need to keep waiting for a 'better' solution to come along. \n\nPlease vote to show support for merging the authored code into DShop's codebase.

      "title": "Allocate 1M of OGN rewards for 10 weeks to the OUSD Curve Pool?",
      "content": "As long discussed on our weekly community calls, I am a strong proponent of offering liquidity mining rewards to increase the circulating supply of OUSD and create a stronger long-term bull thesis for OGN as its governance token. Every single project on the DeFi Pulse leaderboard is offering some kind of incentives. We’ve made remarkable progress considering we haven’t offered any additional incentives, but now after concluding our latest round of security audits and protocol upgrades, we're ready to hit our inflection point.\n\nFor a stablecoin to be useful it must be ubiquitous. We are keenly aware of the fact that it’s still too difficult for most people to acquire OUSD or use it as their default cryptocurrency for all USD-denoted payments. Our growth plan is simple. First, we want to increase the circulating supply to 9-figures before the end of the year. This will make it easier for us to complete the listing process on several top centralized exchanges and get integrated into other DeFi protocols. As we get listed on more exchanges, it will become significantly easier for people to buy OUSD and start using it as their stablecoin of choice. This will create a virtuous cycle as liquidity begets liquidity. This increased demand for OUSD will also drive more awareness and interest in OGN as the governance token.  \n\nWe’ve been working hard over the past few months to get OUSD supported by Curve. The OUSD+3crv pool is now live and liquidity providers are eligible to earn both CRV and OGN rewards. The exact percentage of CRV rewards that are distributed to the LPs in our pool is dependent on veCRV voters and how they choose to allocate those rewards. We can sway the vote by offering incentives to voters who support our pool. We intend to use roughly 1/4 of the rewards for bribes and the rest as rewards for liquidity providers.\n\nThis proposal requests an initial budget of up to 1M OGN / week for 10 weeks to be used for OGN incentives for liquidity providers and bribes. We expect to adjust the campaigns each week based on the results, while taking into consideration the competition from other projects. Measuring ROI of OUSD circulating supply per OGN spent will be a critical metric to ensure that we are getting the results that we want. For example, we may not offer any incentives for a given week and instead defer to another week if the competition is too high. We also expect to taper rewards down in weeks after getting our initial kickstart. Other weeks, we may use the maximum allotment if we believe that we are close to clearing certain milestones that will particularly help us with top exchange listings and DeFi integrations. \n\nThe community has previously expressed concern about yield farmers dumping their earned OGN and causing negative price pressure on our token. Obviously, this is something we want to avoid as well. This is a calculated short-term bet for long-term rewards. We believe this campaign will create long-term value for OGN holders. By running a short-term campaign with negligible price impact we can make OGN into a token governing hundreds of millions of dollars, reaching tens of thousands of more users. Our proposed weekly budget represents well under 1% of our weekly trading volume and 0.1% of the total circulating supply. It is not expected to have a noticeable impact on our token price. Unlike many new token launches, we have very deep liquidity and are using a much smaller percentage of our total supply to fund this campaign. We do NOT expect to offer OGN incentives in perpetuity. We’ve also decided to keep Origin Staking running for the time being until we see how this campaign performs.\n\nWe believe liquidity mining rewards on Curve will be an important tool in increasing the supply, liquidity, and usage of OUSD. This will also increase yields for OUSD holders and thus fees earned by OUSD, directly benefiting OGN holders. As a reminder, 10% of the yield generated by OUSD is used to buyback OGN on the open market. This campaign will also dramatically increase the visibility of OUSD and OGN in the DeFi ecosystem and lead to increased composability and more integrations.\n\nI recognize this proposal may be controversial, but we believe this is the best path forward for OUSD and is in the best interests of all OGN holders. As always, we welcome debate in our #governance channel on Discord. \n",

      "content": "I propose rolling out a new AAVE v2 Strategy with a starting allocation of 10% of DAI.\n\n### AAVE v1  to AAVE v2\n\nOUSD previously used AAVE v1, which has now been depreciated. OUSD has already withdrawn all funds from its old AAVE v1 strategy.\n\nI and other Origin core team members have developed a new AAVE v2 strategy contract. The new code is built on the base of the previous AAVE V1 strategy contract, and adds support for v2's incentives program. The code for the new contract can be seen here, along with tests, mocks, and fork simulations: https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-dollar/pull/601\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe proposed rollout process would be:\n\n  - Deploy and verify contracts.\n  - Governance actions to add the new strategy to the vault, with support for DAI.\n  - A one day mainnet fork testing period for simulations against the actual deployed contracts.\n  - A two week shakeout period with 10% of current DAI (about $200,000) allocated to the strategy.\n\nTowards the end of this shakeout period, everyone can evaluate yield and decide on the next allocation amount.",
