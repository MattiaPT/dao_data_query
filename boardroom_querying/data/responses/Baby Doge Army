      "title": "Rebrand BabyDoge Logo",
      "content": "![IMG_5994.png](ipfs://bafybeidpson5o7jrwnjptrl3yi5skhozvormt3fjs6laa4jk3wde7zuvxy)\n## Summary:\nThis proposal seeks community approval to rebrand the BabyDoge logo on a couple of websites and analytical sites such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. The new branding will focus on the BabyDoge face only, moving away from the current full-body image. This change aims to enhance brand recognition and simplify the production of merchandise and real-life goods.\n\n## Background:\nThe current BabyDoge logo features a full-body image of the mascot. While it has served us well, the trend among other meme brands is to focus on a face-only logo. This approach has proven to be more effective for brand recognition, especially on analytical sites where the logo is often displayed in a small size. By adopting a face-only logo, BabyDoge can stand out more clearly and be easily recognized.\n\n## Proposal Details:\n1. **Objective:** Rebrand the BabyDoge logo on analytical sites to feature the face only.\n2. **Rationale:**\n   - **Enhanced Recognition:** A face-only logo is easier to recognize and more memorable.\n   - **Consistency:** Aligning with other meme brands that use face-only logos.\n   - **Simplicity:** Simplifies the logo for easier use in merchandise and real-life goods.\n3. **Implementation Steps:**\n   - Design and finalize the new face-only logo.\n   - Update the logo on CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and other relevant analytical sites.\n   - Communicate the rebranding to the community and provide updated branding guidelines.\n4. **Timeline:** The rebranding process is expected to take approximately 2-3 weeks, including design finalization and updates on analytical sites.\n\n## Benefits:\n- **Improved Brand Recognition:** A face-only logo is more distinguishable and effective for branding.\n- **Simplified Branding:** Easier to produce and use in various applications, from online presence to merchandise.\n- **Alignment with Industry Trends:** Keeps BabyDoge in line with other successful meme brands.\n\n## Risks and Mitigation:\n- **Community Reception:** Ensure thorough communication and gather feedback from the community to address any concerns.\n- **Implementation Challenges:** Work closely with analytical sites to ensure a smooth transition of the logo update.\n\n## Voting:\nCommunity members are invited to vote on this proposal. A \"Yes\" vote signifies approval to proceed with the rebranding of the BabyDoge logo on analytical sites, while a \"No\" vote indicates opposition to the proposed rebranding.\n\n## Conclusion:\nRebranding the BabyDoge logo to a face-only design on analytical sites will enhance brand recognition, align us with industry trends, and simplify branding efforts. Your support and approval are essential for the success of this initiative.\n\n## Thank You:\nWe extend our heartfelt thanks to the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Together, we continue to grow and strengthen the BabyDoge brand.",

      "title": "Open Perpetual Markets for BabyDoge on Centralized Exchanges",
      "content": "## Summary:\nThis proposal seeks community approval to initiate the listing of BabyDoge perpetual markets on leading centralized exchanges. Establishing these markets will improve liquidity, enhance trading opportunities, and align BabyDoge with the standards of top 100 cryptocurrencies, all of which have active perpetual markets.\n\n## Background:\nPerpetual markets, also known as perpetual futures, are a type of derivative that allows traders to buy or sell an asset at any time, with leverage. Unlike traditional futures, perpetual contracts have no expiration date, making them highly flexible and attractive to traders. As of now, all top 100 cryptocurrencies have perpetual markets, which significantly contribute to their liquidity and trading volume.\n\n## Proposal Details:\n1. **Objective:** List BabyDoge perpetual markets on major centralized exchanges to boost liquidity and organic trading activity.\n2. **Rationale:**\n   - **Increased Liquidity:** Perpetual markets attract high trading volumes, leading to deeper liquidity pools.\n   - **Enhanced Market Access:** Traders can engage in long or short positions, providing opportunities in various market conditions.\n   - **Competitive Positioning:** Aligning with industry standards by offering perpetual markets helps BabyDoge stay competitive and attractive to a broader audience.\n   - **Market Maturity:** Perpetual markets signal maturity and robustness, essential for gaining trust and potential interest from institutional investors and serious traders.\n\n## Implementation Steps:\n1. Identify and engage with top centralized exchanges known for their robust perpetual markets (e.g., OKX, Bybit).\n2. Negotiate perpetual listing terms, market making requirements, and fulfill necessary requirements for each exchange, if any.\n3. Develop and implement a marketing strategy to promote the new perpetual markets and educate the community on how to utilize them.\n4. Monitor market activity and adjust strategies as needed to maximize liquidity and trading activity.\n5. **Timeline:** The process is expected to take approximately a few weeks to a month, including negotiations, technical integration, and promotional activities.\n\n## Benefits:\n- **Liquidity Improvement:** Enhanced liquidity through perpetual markets can lead to tighter spreads and more efficient price discovery.\n- **Attracting Traders:** Perpetual markets appeal to a wide range of traders, from retail to institutional, driving higher engagement.\n- **Price Stability:** Deeper liquidity pools might contribute to less volatile pricing, benefiting all token holders.\n- **Market Validation:** Listing on major exchanges perpetual markets validates BabyDoge’s credibility and market presence.\n\n## Risks and Mitigation:\n- **Market Volatility:** While perpetual markets can increase liquidity, they can also introduce volatility. Proper risk management strategies and community education will be crucial.\n- **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensuring compliance with all relevant regulations to avoid potential legal issues.\n\n## Voting:\nCommunity members are invited to vote on this proposal. A \"Yes\" vote signifies approval to proceed with opening perpetual markets for BabyDoge on centralized exchanges, while a \"No\" vote indicates opposition to the proposed listings.\n\n## Conclusion:\nOpening perpetual markets for BabyDoge on centralized exchanges is a strategic move to enhance liquidity, attract diverse traders, and position BabyDoge among the top cryptocurrencies. Your support and approval are vital for the success of this initiative.",

The community has already expressed strong support for this initiative in the initial temperature check vote.\n\n## Proposal Details:\n1. **Objective:** Deploy BabyDoge token on Solana to improve scalability and user experience.\n2. **Rationale:**\n   - **Transaction Speed:** Solana processes over 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), significantly faster than most blockchains.\n   - **Low Fees:** The average transaction cost on Solana is $0.00025, making it extremely cost-effective.\n   - **Scalability:** Solana's high throughput ensures smooth and rapid transactions, ideal for our growing community.\n   - **Total Value Locked (TVL):** Over $4.75 billion, showcasing strong network security and liquidity.\n   - **User Count:** Over 1 million active users, reflecting its growing popularity.\n   - **Volume:** Solana has recently surpassed BNB Chain and Ethereum in daily transaction volume, emphasizing its efficiency and scalability.\n3. **Implementation Steps:**\n   - Engage with a development team experienced in Solana deployments.\n   - Develop and audit the Solana-compatible BabyDoge smart contract.\n   - Initiate a token bridge to allow seamless transfer of BabyDoge tokens between [current blockchain] and Solana.\n   - Communicate the deployment to the community and provide a user guide for interacting with BabyDoge on Solana.\n4. **Timeline:** The deployment process is expected to take approximately 1-2 months, including development, auditing, and testing phases.\n\n## Benefits:\n- **Speed:** Solana's high throughput ensures faster transaction times.\n- **Cost Efficiency:** Lower transaction fees on Solana benefit both users and the network.\n- **Interoperability:** Enhancing BabyDoge's presence on multiple blockchains increases its accessibility and usability.\n\n## Risks and Mitigation:\n- **Technical Challenges:** Hiring experienced developers and conducting thorough audits will mitigate technical risks.\n- **Adoption:** A comprehensive marketing and education plan will be implemented to ensure smooth adoption by the community.\n\n## Clarification:\nThis deployment will not affect anyone's token holdings. It simply establishes a bridge between ETH, BNB Chain, and Solana, allowing seamless transfers. The total supply of BabyDoge will remain unchanged.\n\n## Voting:\nCommunity members are invited to vote on this proposal. A \"Yes\" vote signifies approval to proceed with the deployment on Solana, while a \"No\" vote indicates opposition to the proposed deployment.\n\n## Conclusion:\nDeploying BabyDoge on Solana aligns with our goal of providing a superior user experience and expanding our token's reach. Your support and approval are crucial to making this initiative a success.\n\n## Thank You:\nWe extend our heartfelt thanks to the community for passing the temperature check! Your support and enthusiasm drive the continued growth and success of the BabyDoge community.",

      "title": "Renounce BabyDoge Token Contract on Ethereum & BNB Chain",
      "content": "![IMG_5958.png](ipfs://bafybeieylscrljupqx4g4dldsk4pucfrgabvzzw3r4bhozsvolyyw7hcam)\n\nSummary:\nThis proposal seeks community approval to renounce the ownership of the BabyDoge token contract on both the Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Smart Chain (BNB Chain) networks. By renouncing ownership, we aim to enhance the decentralization and trust within the BabyDoge ecosystem.\n\nBackground:\nOwnership renouncement is a significant step in the life cycle of a token, signifying the project's commitment to decentralization. Once ownership is renounced, the contract's admin privileges are permanently relinquished, preventing any further changes to the contract by the developers. This move aligns with the principles of transparency and security, ensuring that the contract operates autonomously without external interference.\n\nProposal Details:\n1. Objective: Renounce the ownership of the BabyDoge token contract on both ETH and BNB Chain to enhance decentralization and community trust.\n2. Rationale: \n   - Decentralization: Renouncing ownership ensures that no single entity has control over the contract, aligning with the ethos of decentralized finance (DeFi).\n   - Security: Reducing the risk of potential admin misuse or malicious activity.\n   - Community Trust: Demonstrating our commitment to a fully decentralized and autonomous token ecosystem.\n3. Implementation Steps:\n   - Confirm the final status and functionality of the token contract to ensure no further updates or changes are needed.\n   - Initiate the renouncement process by calling the renounceOwnership function on both ETH and BNB Chain contracts.\n   - Verify the successful renouncement through transaction confirmations and public announcements.\n4. Timeline: The renouncement process is expected to take approximately 1-2 weeks, including verification and community communication.\n5. Communication Plan: \n   - Announce the proposal details and timeline to the community through official channels (Twitter, Discord, Telegram).\n   - Provide regular updates on the progress and final confirmation of ownership renouncement.\n   - Educate the community on the implications and benefits of this decision.\n\nBenefits:\n- Enhanced Decentralization: Solidifies BabyDoge's status as a truly decentralized token.\n- Increased Security: Minimizes the risk of centralized control and potential security breaches.\n- Community Confidence: Builds greater trust and confidence within the BabyDoge community.\n\nRisks and Mitigation:\n- Finality: Once ownership is renounced, no further changes can be made to the contract. Comprehensive review and confirmation of the contract's functionality are crucial.\n- Communication: Clear and transparent communication with the community to ensure understanding and support of the decision.\n\nVoting:\nCommunity members are invited to vote on this proposal. A \"Yes\" vote signifies approval to proceed with renouncing ownership of the BabyDoge token contract on ETH and BNB Chain, while a \"No\" vote indicates opposition to the proposed renouncement.\n\nConclusion:\nRenouncing the ownership of the BabyDoge token contract on ETH and BNB Chain is a strategic move towards achieving complete decentralization and reinforcing our commitment to transparency and security. Your support and approval are essential for the success of this initiative.\n\nNotes:\nThis does not affect your token holdings in any way. This just means that the team won’t be able to make changes to the token contract itself.",

      "title": " [Temperature Check] Deploy BabyDoge Token on Solana Blockchain",
      "content": "Greeting from the new team! 👋\n\nSummary:\nThis proposal seeks a temperature check to see whether there’s enough interest to deploy the BabyDoge token on the Solana blockchain to enhance transaction speed, reduce fees, and increase interoperability within the crypto ecosystem.\n\nBackground:\nBabyDoge is currently deployed on Ethereum & BNB Chain. While this has served us well, the growing demand for faster and cheaper transactions necessitates exploring additional blockchain solutions. Solana, known for its high throughput and low transaction costs, presents a viable option for expanding BabyDoge's capabilities.\n\nProposal Details:\n1. Objective: Deploy BabyDoge token on Solana to improve scalability and user experience.\n2. Rationale: Solana's blockchain offers faster transaction speeds and lower fees compared to many other blockchains, making it an attractive option for BabyDoge users.\n3. Implementation Steps:\n   - Engage with a development team experienced in Solana deployments.\n   - Develop and audit the Solana-compatible BabyDoge smart contract.\n   - Initiate a token bridge to allow seamless transfer of BabyDoge tokens between ETH, BNB Chain and Solana.\n   - Communicate the deployment to the community and provide a user guide for interacting with BabyDoge on Solana.\n4. Timeline: The deployment process is expected to take approximately 1 month past DAO vote ending, including development, and testing phases.\n\nBenefits:\n- Speed: Solana's high throughput ensures faster transaction times.\n- Cost Efficiency: Lower transaction fees on Solana benefit both users and the network.\n- Interoperability: Enhancing BabyDoge's presence on multiple blockchains increases its accessibility and usability.\n\nRisks and Mitigation:\n- Technical Challenges: Hiring experienced developers and conducting thorough audits will mitigate technical risks.\n- Adoption: A comprehensive marketing and education plan will be implemented to ensure smooth adoption by the community.\n\nVoting:\nCommunity members are invited to vote on this proposal. A \"Yes\" vote signifies approval to proceed with the deployment on Solana, while a \"No\" vote indicates opposition to the proposed deployment. Please note that this is only a temperature check and the actual vote will only be created once the temperature check passes.\n\nConclusion:\nDeploying BabyDoge on Solana aligns with our goal of providing a superior user experience and expanding our token's reach. Your support and approval are crucial to making this initiative a success. **This will not increase the circulating supply of BabyDoge.**",

      "title": "Proposal For 0% on BabyDoge BNB chain",
      "content": "Proposal to Lower Fees to 0% on Baby Doge BNB chain\nIntroduction\n\nThe community has been requesting to potentially reduce transaction fees on Baby Doge to 0%. This proposal, prepared in response to that request, aims to enhance the accessibility of Baby Doge for a broader audience while shifting power to our community to decide the future through voting and carry the project moving forward.\n\nRationale for Fee Reduction\n\nEnhanced Accessibility and Adoption:\n\nLowering fees to 0% may make Baby Doge more accessible to a wider user base:*\n0% fees may encourage more frequent usage and transactions\nCompetitive Advantage:\n\nA 0% fee structure positions Baby Doge as a more attractive option compared to other memes with higher transaction costs, potentially drawing in new user adoption and use cases.\nConsiderations\n\n1.No Burns or reflections each transaction:\n\nThis change means there will NOT be burns, reflections, or fees collected (other than gas fees) for each on-chain transaction. This decision aligns with our commitment to low fees and simplicity in transactions. After testing lowering the fees on the Ethereum chain, we have seen demand for the same reduced fees on BNB chain. There will be not be burns each month.\n\n2.Project Road map Completion:\n\nWith the road map completed, the community's role becomes more vital than ever. With a ton of utility we focus on adoption. This milestone achievement allows us to shift our focus towards reducing user’s fees and empowering ease of use for Baby Doge. This proposal lays the foundation for new contributors to emerge to help lead the community.\n\nCommunity-Driven Future:\nThe future of Baby Doge will continue to be community-driven. We believe in empowering our community to be the driving force behind the project's growth and direction. The community will continue to use snapshot for proposals and voting moving forward. The community will unite to develop future of baby doge with 0% fees.\n\nBenefits\n1.-The community has been requesting lower fees.\n\nLowering fees to 0% can position Baby Doge as a meme that is easier to interact with.\nCommunity Empowerment and Engagement:\nThis change seeks to empower the community, giving every member the ability to directly influence the future of Baby Doge. By removing barriers to entry and making transactions more straightforward, this lays the foundation for adoption and community use of Baby Doge.\nThis proposal marks a significant step in our meme's evolution and the beginning of a new chapter. Baby Doge will remain as a meme known for its light heartedness, charity, utility, & community strength. Baby Doge is firmly rooted in decentralization entrusting the entire community with the responsibility for its success.\n\nClosing Remarks\n\nThis proposal is more than just a reduction to 0% in fees; it's a testament to our belief in the power of community-driven initiatives. As a community, let's unite to make Baby Doge have a fee-free future.\n\nAs a result of 0% fees, unlocked tokens may be used for funding initiatives including, but not limited to: team & core contributor allocations, project expenses, team & contributor compensation, community initiatives, donations, grants, contests, rewards, which allows for new team and contributors to emerge and more. Tokens maybe allocated among several wallets.\n\nThis proposal aims to present the benefits of lowering fees to 0%, while also emphasizing the important role of the community in the ongoing development and success of Baby Doge Coin.\n\nThe inherent nature of community powered meme projects carries a significant degree of unpredictability and risk. If approved and adopted by the community., there are no definitive assurances regarding the impact or volatility that the 0% fee update may have on Baby Doge token function, the Baby Doge community, or otherwise.\n\nOur meme is only as strong as our community supporting it. We welcome all members to contribute to the project and spreading memes!\n\nPlease note there is NO MIGRATION OR AIRDROP CLAIM REQUIRED. ADDITIONALLY NO CHANGE OF THE TOKEN ADDRESS.\n\nToday you can already visit multiple outlets where the 10% fee is not applied including on Ethereum network and centralized exchanges.\n\nWe are looking for over 80% in favor of 0% fees to pass this proposal.",

      "content": "Objective: To enhance BabyDoge's market presence and appeal to Ethereum whales by establishing a bridge between the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum networks, thereby reducing transaction costs and leveraging the current bullish market trend.\n\nSolution Details: Introduce a bridge, preferably via Stargate, to facilitate seamless transactions between BSC and Ethereum. This will allow whales to buy and sell BabyDoge on the Ethereum chain without incurring high taxes, thus increasing the attractiveness of BabyDoge to the Ethereum community.\n\nAccording to team, we can use cex as a bridge as they are bit hesitant to take a risk for launching another bridge after what happened to MULTICHAIN, but kucoin doesn’t accept Eth babydoge deposit and htx mexc don’t allow eth babydoge withdraw possibly because of lack of user deposit via eth babydoge that’s why we need a wormhole/bridge service to facilitate smooth transition and calling a cex a bridge is just plain lazy.\n\n\nValue Proposition:\n•\tTap into the current meme market momentum and the popularity of BabyDoge by making it more accessible to Ethereum whales.\n•\tDrive up volume on the Ethereum chain, expanding BabyDoge's reach and market presence.\n•\tShowcase BabyDoge's commitment to innovation by adopting cutting-edge technology like interoperability.\n•\tFinancial Considerations: Implement a 10% tax rate for the first three months after launching the bridge:\n\n•\t9% for burning tokens organically, aligning with the meme nature of BabyDoge.\n•\t1% for liquidity to ensure a stable ecosystem.\n\nWhy Ethereum:\n•\tRecent team dedication to Ethereum through recent launches of an AI image generator and an NFT generator.\n•\tBsc is mostly for small investor but Ethereum got the big guns\n•\tWe already have implemented 0% tax rate on the Ethereum chain.\n\nTimeline and Milestones:\n1.\tImmediate Action: Initiate discussions with the community about the proposed bridge.\n2.\tShort Term (Within 3 Months): Launch the bridge via Stargate and implement the 10% tax rate.\n3.\tMid-Term (Beyond 3 Months): Evaluate the performance of the bridge and consider reducing fees on BSC from March onwards.\n\nRationale for Burning 9%:\n•\tAs BabyDoge started as a joke (420q), burning 9% aligns with the meme culture and reduces the token supply organically.\n•\tCreating scarcity may trigger a positive CHAIN reaction (pun intended), driving further interest and demand.\n\nCons of Multichain Bridge:\n•\tPotential downsides, such as reliability concerns and susceptibility to hacks.\n•\tThough a multichain bridge may have drawbacks, it is a necessary step to leverage current technology and appeal to a broader audience.\n\nThis proposal aims to position BabyDoge strategically in the evolving meme market, capturing the attention of Ethereum whales and solidifying its presence across multiple chains.",

      "title": "Proposal: Implementing a 5 Quadrillion Baby Doge Burn on BSC",
      "content": "Proposal: Implementing a 5 Quadrillion Baby Doge Burn on BSC\n\nIn light of our current liquidity position and market dynamics, we present the proposal to initiate a 5 quadrillion Baby Doge burn on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\n\nTo rationalize this proposition, we intend to incorporate surplus LP tokens from the BDSwap into our burn. The rationale behind this lies in our current liquidity status, which significantly surpasses both recommended liquidity benchmarks outlined in Ape Swap liquidity ratings and industry averages. While maintaining a robust liquidity, our aim is to align ourselves within the range of the recommended liquidity amount while still retaining a liquidity balance well above the initial 178k LP tokens. Worth noting, our liquidity ratio outpaces benchmarks set by Shib and Floki.\n\nTo establish a minimum liquidity threshold, our plan ensures that we maintain a minimum balance of 180k Cake-LP tokens, thereby sustaining healthy liquidity ratio levels. Any amount exceeding this may potentially be burned.\n\nAs evidence of our adherence to the original LP token balance, documentation is available: https://bscscan.com/tx/0x46e3419f0a76fd824ac176041edcf22c7ab2ee49d4dd31ac4f627744b232eaed\n\nMoreover, it's pertinent to highlight that 90k LP tokens have been permanently burned and cannot ever be removed. For verification purposes, this transaction record can be accessed: https://bscscan.com/token/0xc736cA3d9b1E90Af4230BD8F9626528B3D4e0Ee0?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead\n\nAcknowledging that our current liquidity surplus remains largely untapped due to comparatively lower trading volumes, our proposition involves incorporating these excess LP tokens into the monthly burn. This strategic move is anticipated to facilitate the burn of an estimated 5 quadrillion Baby Doge tokens from circulation. \nBNB allocation will be directed to the team\n\nIt's crucial to emphasize that these LP tokens do not constitute the initial liquidity, but rather represent the surplus generated by the protocol. The proposed action is not obligatory but reflects our commitment to considering community feedback. \n\nIf successful the burn will be carried out on October 1st (or shortly after).\nThis achievement will set the total burn % to be over 50% of the supply!",

      "content": "Exciting News: A Proposal to Strengthen Security with a 100 Quadrillion Token Burn on ETH and fee reduction to 0%\n\nWe've been listening to your concerns and have come up with an innovative solution to further enhance the security and integrity of our project. As these 100 quadrillion tokens have been sitting idle since our launch on ETH, we propose a monumental token burn to reduce potential exploitation risk associated with them. This would effectively remove a significant portion of the tokens on ETH, ensuring the long-term stability and safety of our ecosystem.\n\nWe understand the importance of reserving some tokens to facilitate bridging to ETH. This proposed burn will still allow for seamless bridging, while also reducing the fee on ETH transactions to 0%! This means our community members can enjoy more efficient, and cost-effective transactions within the ecosystem.\n\nThis monumental event could be one of the largest token burns in history, with an estimated value of hundreds of millions of dollars! We are eager to hear your thoughts and feedback on this bold proposal. If we see overwhelming support from our incredible community, we will draft an official proposal for the DAO to consider.\n\nRemember, this is all about strengthening our project and enhancing security while offering our community members a seamless and cost-effective experience. Let's make history together and continue to build a vibrant, secure, and thriving ecosystem!\n\nThis initiative would initially be carried out on ETH and depending its success could be explored on BNB chain.\n\n\nHow it will work:\n\nWithin 24 hours after the vote passes the ETH network fees will be set to 0%\n\nBurn will happen on June 1st 2023\n\nThis will leave approximately 85Q baby doge left that can be bridged. \nOne downside of this proposal is that all baby doge will not be able to move to ethereum if something ever happened to BNB chain only 85/155q of the supply would be able to make it to the ETH network.\n\nThings to understand\n1. Manually burning tokens that are not in the circulating supply will have little to zero effect of the price of baby doge token.\n2. BabyDoge is a fun meme token.\n\n\n\n(Pending official vote by the DAO)\"",

      "title": "Developers took this down, I put it back",
      "content": "The taxation is not insurmountable, but it makes selling and buying the token very difficult. In order for this token to actually work itself down to a manageable number people must have incentive to sell it and re-buy it. That is not possible under the current situation. Even if we burned all the quadrants that are available to burn there are still quadrillions out there being held. If baby doge is to obtain a .00001 value people will have to buy and sell and bring their personal assets below trillions. As long as individuals own so much of the coin, it cannot truly depreciate as the model intends. My idea for babydoge is as follows:\n\n1 - The monumental amount of quadrillion’s available to burn must be liquidated by the developers. If holders buy up a majority of these quadrillion’s, the token will stagnate and die.\n\n2 - The tax on the token cannot continue in its present form in perpetuity. At some point if quadrants are eliminated and the price rises, people will need to sell, which will bring the price back down at which time people will buy back in and this cycle will be repeated several times, to eliminate the quadrillions being held.\nCurrently, if you sell and buy back in that is a 20% margin and the price doesn’t move that quickly. My suggestion is that the taxation either be just on purchases and not on selling. This would definitely promote holders to sell and not maintain such high quantities, so that the token may still be deflationary after developers reduce the supply. The magic number for four zeros seems to be a round the 400 to 600 trillion mark. Mind you that that will only get you those four zeros and will never get you to a penny. The numbers will never work otherwise after the token is in the mid-trillions it can still take many years of deflation to bring it anywhere near a penny.\n\n3 - Everyone should understand that when people buy and sell tokens money is not only made but money is lost. Money is only changing hands in a gamble. That’s why it is essential that tokens be bought and sold continuously and not just held. The tokens utility as payment for goods is useless. Vendors cannot take a 20% loss nor can the buyers of products. If there were some mechanism for buying products without the taxation from the coin, either by the seller, or the buyer, that utility could be much better than it is. I understand the concept that the developers had when they made so many quadrillions, and made the token deflationary with the taxation plus helping our canine friends I think, baby doge has a following similar to the other doge coins, Shiba, and doge. Doge will eventually die because it’s inflationary and the numbers won’t allow it to work after it grows too much. In that regard a deflationary token is superior, but it must pass a barrier so that the numbers will make sense. The developers need to decide whether they want this token to try to survive 20 to 30 years to obtain a better value or to speed up that process to occur within 2 to 3 years. I’m sure anyone can see the latter will keep peoples attention much more than the preceding. It’s imperative that the developers realize stagnation will kill the token.\n\nThere are so many things to consider, and if the developers are truly listening, then they should understand that acting quickly is in everyone’s best interest for this coin, to become substantial, and not just another token. They have done a great job, especially with babydoge swap. But some of the points that I have expressed need to be attended to in a timely manner. Thank you for your time. ",

Baby Doge is one of the most liquid MEMEs in crypto based on DEX liquidity.\n\nCurrently approximately 14.5% of LP tokens are burned therefore they will always remain on pancake swap v2\n\nMajority of liquidity is currently in PancakeSwap: approximately X tokens.\n\nWorth 47,756 BNB at time of this post.\n\n79.9% or approximately 40,590 BNB will be moved to baby doge swap from this proposal.\n\n\nWe propose that we migrate 85% of the liquidity from PancakeSwap to BabyDogeSwap. It requires no changes on user end. Liquidity will be locked immediately after migration we will share the transaction.\n\nScreenshots and transaction links verifying the same value has moved will be shared with the community for transparency.\n\nWhy do we want the liquidity on our swap?\n\nDeeper liquidity on our swap gives lower slippage for our users.\nIncrease TVL on baby doge swap\nEncourage community to adopt baby doge swap \nOffer 0% swap fee as opposed to pancakes 0.25% fee\nCreate arbitrage opportunities from pancake <> baby doge swap\nCreate stronger brand awareness and credibility to baby doge swap\n\n\nWe hope to make Baby Doge Swap a premiere swap on BSC and believe having majority of liquidity and TVL on our platform will benefit the project overall.\n\nWe hope the community agrees with this proposal.\n\nWe Prefer to go with Option 1 for simplicity but the community will decide:\n\nOption 1. Move all liquidity at once in 1 transaction and share the transaction with community. \n\nOption 2. Move 25% per month over 4 months. Share each transaction with community\n\nOption 3. Leave all liquidity all on PanCakeSwap we don't need Baby Doge Swap",
