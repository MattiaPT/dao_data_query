      "content": "UPDATE THE CURRENT MULTI-SIG TEAM FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE CURRENT TERM.\n\nAuthors: Avereth\nType: Proposal\nImplementer: Multi-sig Team\nCreated Date: [26/8/24]\nAbstract:\nThis proposal aims to approve the replacement of multi-sig member SanLeo with daniel g in the Founder's DAO. The objective is to remove an inactive member within the DAO to an active member, who has already been approved as a prior signer and to see out the remainder of the current term up to December 18th 2024.\nMotivation:\nThe loss of SanLeo is felt around the DAO however by replacing SanLeo with daniel g, is a step forward in getting our DAO back on track and up to date to begin functioning and acting like a DAO again. Having an active member with good intentions for the DAO within the multisig team would be a great addition.\nConnection to Mission:\nAs per proposal: 08c88217af0ae2adbfed6d1378e7b55b0bd2e31c22af4\n\nOur mission is: “Our DAO empowers community-driven investment, with a focus on discovering new opportunities while advancing the vision of Pixel Vault. We prioritize transparency, accountability, and integrity in all we do.” \nBy adding an active member it aligns with a focus on discovering new opportunities for the DAO and getting them processed sooner.\nSpecification:\nThe proposal will involve the following technical details:\n\nThe signers listed below are responsible for the SAFE addresses:\n0x580A96BC816C2324Bdff5eb2a7E159AE7ee63022\n0x2C0BDb957F5a6976E4Ceb5A34470bFB13D30a278\n\nCurrent Signers:\n0xfB0d1448D814E02ef8a84e8D59D1Cfb1041043Ee - SANLEO (Discord user ID: sanleo)\n0x46b03d28dddaEBa99c27E07E4301949821A35b92 - not6209 (Discord user ID: 6209)\n0xFd25Dc31196c73E15eDE57391c32472193147FF5 - IGI (Discord user ID: igi_oida)\n0x651EC1afd03C4A5F731dA8Fa4fc124802392b8dA - Perpetual_cgi (Discord user ID: perpetual_cgi)\n0x10316BEc523d5Cf7321e51d6A27B365366C1b387 - AERON (Discord user ID: aeron523)\n0x3F8b55Efa76AF49372Efe2224029efCBCbC3B71f - DIMITROVI (Discord user ID: dimitrovi)\n0x115Ab9e1dBe84030719835dd3d4B74503BE8921B - GFUNK (Discord user ID: ggfunk)\n\nNew Signers:\n\n0x35c17dd9df9156ee74726e29f598dca529efac8d - daniel g (Discord user ID: daniel.g.) NEW\n0x46b03d28dddaEBa99c27E07E4301949821A35b92 - not6209 (Discord user ID: 6209)\n0xFd25Dc31196c73E15eDE57391c32472193147FF5 - IGI (Discord user ID: igi_oida)\n0x651EC1afd03C4A5F731dA8Fa4fc124802392b8dA - Perpetual_cgi (Discord user ID: perpetual_cgi)\n0x10316BEc523d5Cf7321e51d6A27B365366C1b387 - AERON (Discord user ID: aeron523)\n0x3F8b55Efa76AF49372Efe2224029efCBCbC3B71f - DIMITROVI (Discord user ID: dimitrovi)\n0x115Ab9e1dBe84030719835dd3d4B74503BE8921B - GFUNK (Discord user ID: ggfunk)\n\nAddition of daniel g as a multi-sig member, allows us as a DAO to get proposals potentially approved faster by having more active members. Updating the DAO's documentation and records to reflect the change in multi-sig members. Also being a prior signer means his wallet is already pre approved and does not require payment.\n\nExecution:\nThe proposal will be executed through the following steps:\nFounder's DAO members will vote on the proposal and provide feedback.\nIf the proposal is approved, the DAO will initiate the process of removing SanLeo as a multi-sig member.\nDaniel g will be invited and on boarded as a multi-sig member again, following the DAO's established procedures. Until the current term.\nThe DAO's documentation and records will be updated to reflect the new multi-sig member composition.\n\nBenefits:\nThe proposed benefits of switching multi-sig members are as follows:\nInclusion of an active member will benefit by ensuring there are more members available to process future transactions and signatures on our multi sig wallet and responsiveness to community requirements.\n\nDrawbacks:\nThe potential drawbacks of the proposal are as follows:\nLoss of SanLeos expertise and contributions in a technical and developer aspect is felt through the PV team as well as within the Multisig team (He has already left the community). Time Zones will also play a role with all members' availability to process transactions at the same time.\n\nOutcomes:\nThe expected outcomes of the proposal are as follows:\nSuccessful replacement of SanLeo with daniel g as a multi-sig member.\nImproved MultiSig Team participation by adding more active member(s).\n\nIf this proposal is voted against enacting, we will have the same team for the remainder of the year, making the DAO proposal approval and enacting process a lot harder and longer.\n\nFeedback and progress reports on future proposal outcome progress shared with the community.\nThe updated multi-sig member composition and documentation will be reported to the Founder's DAO community.\n\nVoting Options:\nYes- Update the team signers.\nNo- Leave the team signers the same.\nAbstain",

      "title": "“All-in” - Maximum $GG exposure for the FoundersDAO",
      "content": "Title: “All-in” - Maximum $GG exposure for the FoundersDAO\nAuthor(s): Avereth\nType: Action\nImplementer: Multi-sig Team (See team list in Discord server), @Avereth.au\nCreated Date: 3 Aug 2024\n\nSUMMARY\nFounders DAO (FD) will switch to be “all-in” with maximum exposure to $GG and Reboot Protocol. 3 things need to happen. \n1. Swap our $punks tokens for $gg token. \n2. Burn our remaining $pow tokens for $gg. \n3. “Attach” our 199 Evolution Tier 6 DOTs to our Plant Dust Tokens to accelerate the vesting in such a way to maximise the amount of $GG unlocked during this process. Then repeating the same process of “attaching” the DOTs to the next most valuable planets and so on claiming any liquid $gg if required along the way. \n\nThis proposal seeks to permit the Multi-sig members of the FD to engage with the FoundersDAO.eth wallet (Wallet: 0x580A96BC816C2324Bdff5eb2a7E159AE7ee63022) to \n1. Swap our $punks tokens for $gg. 2. Burn our $pow tokens for $gg. 3. Accelerate the maximum amount of our vested $GG with our 199 Evo 6 DOTs once the process goes live on Reboot Protocol. Repeating this process for the next most valuable planets available as all 199 DOT accelerated vesting periods conclude and to claim unlocked $gg tokens.\n\nVOTING\n\n-Option #1. “All in!” 1. Swap all $punks for $gg. 2. Burn all $pow for $gg. 3. Maximum allocation of 199 DOTs to accelerate our vested $GG in Planet Dust as detailed in this proposal.\n\n-Option #2. “Call” - 1. Hold $punks tokens for fractional ownership of CryptoPunks and/or to swap at a later date. 2. Burn all $pow for $gg. 3. Maximum allocation of 199 DOTs to accelerate our vested $GG in Planet Dust as detailed in this proposal.\n\n-Option #3. “Fold” - Everything stays as is, I want more time to think about this. 1. No, I prefer fractional ownership of the CryptoPunks. 2. No, let’s hold the $pow tokens that have no use. 3. No DOTs acceleration, we are a tortoise in this race and want our vested $GG to take the maximum vesting time for now not wanting to unlock any vested $GG faster.\n\n-Option #4. Abstain.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWhat: \n\nThe FD has:\n25,014,834 $punks tokens. 32,478 $pow tokens. 6470 Planet Dust tokens. 199 EVO 6 DOTs. \nAfter conversion our current holdings equates to:\n$punks = 18,761,125.5 $gg. $pow = 13,315.98 $gg after vesting. \nTotal Planet Dust = 20,118,265 $gg.\n\nCombined and upon completion of all vesting periods (max 24 months), the FD could possess a total of approximately 38,892,706.48 $gg tokens if option #1 passes and 20,118,265 $gg if option #2 or #3 passes.\n\nThe FD would benefit more so by allocating our 199 DOTs to the Planet Dust tokens with the most $gg locked in them. With current holdings this would be allocated as follows: 97 DOTs on Mercury, 10 DOTs on Moon, 92 DOTs on Venus. Total=199 dots.\nMoon = 590, 230 $GG  \nMercury = 2,720,365 $GG \nVenus = 1,410,186 $GG \nTotal = 4,720,781 $GG\n\nAn EVO 6 DOT speeds up the vesting period of $gg on Planet Dust by 4X (recently confirmed with the team). It will be the amount of $GG the DAO has remaining on those planets that would vest 4x as fast.  Since our dust has been vesting already, it will be less than 6 months before fully vested when adding DOT acceleration, from when we attach the DOTs.\n\nAn EVO 6 DOT once having completed an accelerated vesting cycle can be used again on another Plant Dust token. The multi-sig team will at their own discretion and within a reasonable timeframe continue to re-“attach” our DOTs to the next most locked $gg valuable planet. This will continue until all vested $gg has been accelerated and extracted as liquid $gg tokens into the FD wallet. The Reboot developers have also kindly offered a “white glove service” to assist the FD and the multi-sig singers in accelerating our $gg token unlocks using our DOTs. This will be an ongoing process until all $gg Planet Dust tokens have been unlocked. \n\nThe order of the multi-sig team allocating our 199 DOTs to our Planet dust tokens shall follow the following DOT acceleration cycles until the end of Stage 1 vesting is 100% unlocked:\n\nCycle #1\nMercury: 97 DOTs\nMoon: 10 DOTs\nVenus: 92 DOTs\n\nCycle #2\nVenus: 110 DOTs\nEarth: 73 DOTs\nPluto: 16 DOTs\n\nCycle #3 \nPluto: 32 DOTs\nMars: 114 DOTs\nSaturn: 53:DOTs\n\nCycle #4\nSaturn: 199 DOTs\n\nContinue Saturn until all Vested $gg is unlocked. During saturn cycles two years will have passed and all vested $gg will be unlocked.\n\nIf option #1 is approved in this proposal the 25,014,834 $punks tokens swapped will equal 18,761,125.5 $gg that is linearly unlocked over the course of one year from the time of substitution. The $pow tokens burned for $gg. The 199 Dots will be \"attached\" and $gg unlock accelerated on 199 planets.\n\nIf the vote option #2 is approved in this proposal the $pow tokens will be burned for $gg. 199 Dots will be \"attached\" and $gg unlock accelerated on 199 planets. \n\nIf the vote option #3 is approved in this proposal nothing happens and our Planet Dust $gg is unlocked over 24 months only.\n\nThe multi-sig team will at their discretion and within a reasonable timeframe claim any $gg token amount as it unlocks for the FD wallet from either DOT accelerated planet unlocked $gg or $punks tokens unlocked $gg tokens.\n\n-Some other information below to assist in members' decisions-\n\nThe FD currently owns 25% supply of $punks as #1 holder. See link: https://etherscan.io/token/0x30c084890fc07d78f3499ffc818b3225bc8812ea#balances\n\nDue to the Planet Dust $gg DOT acceleration unlock process not online or available yet at the time of writing this proposal, certain terminologies may differ used here as to what is mentioned or used on Reboot. As long as the outcome is the same and aligns with this proposal, no further proposal should be required to carry out the outcome and actions detailed within this proposal. \n\nThe Multi-sig team will utilise the FD member tokens to make this proposal reach quorum by voting to abstain before the voting period ends. This will ensure this proposal reaches a decision by those who voted.\n\nWhy: \n\n-Going “all-in” on Reboot is an easy way to allow the FD to start earning revenue on our $gg holdings faster in the future via earning fees from validating once it goes live.\n-Whilst $punks token does have fractional ownership of the vaulted CryptoPunks, going “all-in” could provide better value being returned back to the DAO faster. The likelihood of selling one of our grail punks and distributing profits could be regarded as slim by many community members.\n-$pow token has no utility other than being burned for a 12 month linear unlock of $gg token.\n-We as a DAO have no reason not to accelerate our planet vesting with our DOTs to unlock $gg token faster, thus putting it to use for earnings within Reboot. (subject to proposal).\n\nHow:\n\nOption #1 “I’m all in!”: Upon approval the FD multi-sig team will execute the appropriate transactions to swap our $punks tokens for $gg, burn our $pow tokens for $gg, and “attach” our 199 DOTs to the appropriate planet dust tokens.\n\nOption #2 “Call”: Upon approval the FD multi-sig team will execute the appropriate transactions to burn our $pow tokens for $gg, and “attach” our 199 DOTs to the appropriate planet dust tokens.\n\nOption#3 “Fold”: Upon approval the FD multi-sig team will do nothing. No transactions required. Our wallet holdings stay the same at no cost.\n\nThis will be carried out in the most cost effective manner as soon as reasonably practicable after approval. Likely costs involved will only be gas to carry out transactions. The Reboot developers have also offered a “white glove service” to assist with carrying out our required transactions\n\nWho: \n\nMulti-sig team will be responsible for executing the attaching of DOTs from the FoundersDAO.eth wallet to planet dust tokens. Avereth will provide oversight.\nWhere: \nTransactions will take place in the FoundersDAO.eth wallet on the Reboot platform. \n\nPOSITIVES\n\n1. This provides maximum exposure to $gg token and any potential value in the future. It would put us in a strong position for the DAO to earn fees generated on Reboot. 2. $pow token has no use, so burning for $gg is only positive for the DAO. 3. Giving up fractional ownership of CryptoPunks by swapping $punks tokens makes a statement that the FD commitment to $gg and Reboot. \n\nNEGATIVES\n\n1. This would likely be a one way transaction. The ability to swap $punks for $gg is always an option and any given time in the future at a fixed rate and it would be unlikely to be able to buy back 25% supply of $punks tokens in the future. There has been talk within the DAO for a while about distributing $punks tokens to FD token holders. There has not been any action taken as of time of writing this proposal. Swapping $punks tokens eliminates this as a future option. \n2. The DAO could be regarded as having enough exposure to $gg token already. It will still be #1 holder by the end of the vesting period regardless of the outcome of this proposal. So the argument can be made that by going “all-in“ we would be over exposed.\n\nRISKS\n\n1. Swapping $punks and losing our 25% ownership over the vaulted CryptoPunks could lose the DAO any potential profits if sold in the future. \n2. Price fluctuations and drops in $gg value against the value of the CryptoPunks. \n3. The legal status of the FD as an independent entity distributing $GG tokens or tokens of value to its members is currently unclear. Exchanging our $Punks tokens for $GG could potentially lock up funds that may not be distributable in the future. Similarly, holding onto $Punks tokens with the intention of distributing them to holders at a later time also raises similar concerns about their future distribution.\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nFounders DAO will decide on going “all-in” on $gg token and Reboot, deciding whether to have the maximum exposure to $gg token it can by swapping $punks for $gg. Versus having its normal exposure via planets and DOTs only. And decide about burning $pow token for $gg and Utilising our DOTs for $gg unlock acceleration.",

      "title": "Proposal for DAO Token Redemption Program",
      "content": "Summary\nThis proposal aims to initiate a token redemption program where the DAO allocates 25 ETH to be distributed equally among all DAO members who participate by sending their DAO tokens to the DAO vault. The redemption period will last for at least two weeks. At the end of this period, the 25 ETH will be evenly distributed back to the addresses that participated in the token redemption.\n\nObjectives\n1. Token Circulation Reduction Reduce the number of circulating DAO tokens, potentially increasing their value.\n\n2. Fair Exit Opportunity Provide DAO members with a fair opportunity to exit their position by redeeming their DAO tokens for ETH. \n\nProgram Details\n\nToken Redemption Period\nAll tokens sent to the founders' dao wallet before the announced end date will be accepted. The official end date will be announced on the founder’s dao twitter account. The end date will be 2 weeks after the initial announcement. \n\n\nTwitter account:\n@foundersdao\n\nRedemption Mechanics\n1. DAO Wallet: Members will send their DAO tokens to the designated DAO wallet address: \n\n\nThe wallet Address is:\nFoundersdao.eth\n\n\n2. Distribution: After the end date, the 25 ETH will be distributed equally among all the addresses that participated by sending in DAO tokens.\n\nParticipation Guidelines\n- Minimum/Maximum Tokens: There is no minimum or maximum number of tokens required for participation.\n- Deadline: Only tokens sent before the end date will be eligible for the redemption program.\n\nCalculation and Distribution\n1. Calculation: At the end of the period, the total number of DAO tokens sent to the DAO wallet will be calculated.\n2. Distribution Formula: Each participating wallet will receive an equal share of the 25 ETH, calculated as follows:\n\nEth per Token = ( 25 eth  ) / (# of tokens Received)\n\nEach participating wallet will then receive:\nETH per Wallet = Number of DAO Tokens Sent by the Wallet × ETH per Token\n   \n3. Distribution Date: The ETH distribution will be initiated within 7 days after the end of the redemption period.\n\nBenefits\n- Token Supply Control: Reduces the overall supply of DAO tokens in circulation, potentially benefiting the remaining token holders.\n- Fair Exit: Provides a structured and fair mechanism for members who wish to exit their position in the DAO.\n\nImplementation\n\nThe multisig team will be responsible for distributing the eth for the proposal. The founders dao twitter account will publish the distribution list at least one day prior to the dispersal for review. \n\nRisks and Considerations\n- Market Impact: Sudden changes in DAO token supply and demand could impact token value.\n- Participation Rate: The effectiveness of the program depends on member participation.\n\nConclusion\nThe token redemption program provides a fair and transparent mechanism for reducing the supply of dao tokens. This proposal seeks approval to proceed with the outlined plan.",

      "title": "PVFD Proposal to Pay 2023 Invoices and Continue Legal Wrapper",
      "content": "**Proposal Title:** PVFD Proposal to Pay 2023 Invoices and Continue Legal Wrapper\n\n**Date of Submission:** 1/20/24\n\n**Proposal Committee:** Executive Committee\n\n**Implementer(s):** The Executive Committee is organizing the components of the proposal. The Multisig team is responsible for transferring funds to the Director (Campbell Law) who is responsible for dispersing to appropriate accounts to ensure invoices are paid in full for 2023.\n\n**Discussion:** https://forum.foundersdao.app/t/pvfd-proposal-to-pay-2023-invoices/285\n\n**Abstract:** The Founder’s DAO has a legal wrapper set up as a Foundation Company through the Cayman Islands, which allows us to operate as a decentralized organization. As part of this legal wrapper we pay Silverside Management, a Supervisor, and a Director, to ensure we are legally protected and the proper paperwork for the foundation company is submitted to the proper entities in the Cayman Islands. (Invoices are linked below). In addition, a Yes vote for this proposal will allow the Director and Executive Committee members to complete the paperwork to keep the Foundation and Legal Wrapper in place and operating as is for 2024.\n\n**Motivation:** We need to pay our bills for 2023 and officially approve the extension of the Foundation and therefore the Legal Wrapper. \n\n**Connection to Mission:** The Legal Wrapper allows us to execute on all proposals that support the Mission, because it allows us to operate in a decentralized manner while providing protections to our members. \n\n**Specification:** \nInvoices for 2023: \nSilverside Management LTD (Registered office, Secretary, Supervisor): https://drive.google.com/file/d/14UDZeLLbynQU0XpXdmPg30ghcpRCRCZW/view?usp=sharing \nDirector (Campbell Law): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1voB27E1oWX56iany-8vikSYTsu-Fcy3M/view?usp=sharing \n\n**Total for 2023 invoices:** $36,135.00\n\nInvoices for 2024 (to be paid in advance): \nAnnual and Professional Fees: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GKjdXHX59iRyJB8WFrrL-_pI1lai5OoM/view?usp=sharing \n\n**Total for 2024 (more will be paid at the end of the year):** $6,703.10\n**Extra funds for Transfer Fees:** $100.00\n**Grand Total to be paid after approval of this proposal:** $42,938.10\n\n**Execution:** If quorum is reached and a Yes vote is the Majority: \nThe Multisig will send $42,838.10 USDC to our Director (Campbell Law) at the address: 0x443Bff886BE2658655a32c1B2008Fb432D7DF0CE \nThe Director will use the USDC to pay all invoices listed above via wires and/or transfers. \nThe Director (Campbell Law) will provide invoice receipts for PVFD records. \nThe Director, along with Executive Committee members, will complete paperwork necessary to continue the Legal Wrapper as is. \n\n\n**Benefits:** The Founders’ DAO must pay its outstanding bills in order to stay legally compliant. In addition, with a yes vote for this proposal, we will be continuing the legal wrapper in its most basic form. The purpose is to stay legally compliant, legally protected, and decentralized, as we move towards finding our true purpose and possible revenue sources. \n\n**Drawbacks:** \nPaying the Invoices: The bills must be paid. The drawback for paying the invoices is that we are using a significant amount of funds.  \n\nContinuing the Legal Wrapper: The drawback for continuing the legal wrapper is also financial.  If we vote to continue operating as is, we will owe around the same amount at the end of 2024. Since we don’t have a clear path to profits, it’s expensive to keep the legal wrapper in place, however, the cost of not having one could be significant as we could face legal and financial liability.  \n\n**Outcomes:** A successful outcome for a Yes vote is our invoices being paid in full and our paperwork for continuing the Legal Wrapper being submitted.",

      "content": "Implementer(s): Founders DAO Multisig Team\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis proposal focuses on migrating all $PUNKS ERC-20 tokens held in the Founders DAO's current wallet to a new multi-chain wallet compatible with Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova (eth:0x2C0BDb957F5a6976E4Ceb5A34470bFB13D30a278). The current multi-sig wallet address can only operate on the ETH Mainnet.\n\nFollowing the transfer, a predetermined number of tokens will be swapped in exchange for vested $GG, a process to be executed by the Founders DAO Multisig Team (list of signers can be found in #fd-resources). This $GG will be set to linearly unlock over the course of one year from the time of substitution.\n\nThere has been discussion in PVFD discord regarding a potential $PUNKS distribution to members rather than swap for $GG. Should this proposal fail to pass, that discussion would be continued and require a further proposal.\n\nMotivation:\n\nThe central goal is to optimize the DAO's asset portfolio for functionality within the Arbitrum One / Nova ecosystems, enhancing both liquidity and strategic positioning. This allows us to collect $GG after the 1 year vesting period and utilize said $GG as seen fit. There may also be an option to linearly claim $GG as it unlocks for distribution and/or further use, although this is outside of the scope of this proposal and would require further discussion.\n\nConnection to Mission:\n\nAligning with the Founders DAO’s ethos of innovation and adaptability, this move to a multi-chain environment on Arbitrum One / Nova represents a strategic pivot towards modernized, efficient asset management and community-driven asset optimization. This move also supports the Reboot platform and shows our conviction for its success.\n\nTechnical Aspects:\n\nSecure transfer of all 25,014,834.007 $PUNKS tokens from the current wallet to the new multi-chain wallet, followed by the swapping of the specified number of tokens via https://app.reboot.gg/.\n\nBudget and Funding:\n\nPrimarily involves the reallocation of existing assets and will require ETH for gas to move these assets.\n\nExpected Returns:\n\nThe released $GG after the 1 year vesting period has reached its finish and enhanced operational capabilities on Arbitrum.\n\nExecution:\n\nSecure DAO community approval for the proposal.\nTransfer all $PUNKS tokens from the existing wallet FD to the new multi-chain wallet, this has already been set up in accordance with the proposal here - \n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/foundersdao.eth/proposal/0xbf9abb9fcd15835f575c44ee0e848f40e4091d6c2b7e2ddf9f5f0f74f50e536f\n\nSwap the agreed number of tokens for $GG which will be set to linearly unlock over the course of one year.\nEnsure transparency and reporting throughout the process.\n\nBenefits:\n\nImproved functionality and flexibility within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nEnhancement of DAO's asset management and strategic positioning.\nIncreased liquidity through the acquisition of $GG.\nA large voting percentage in the forthcoming Reboot DAO.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nThe irreversible nature of swapping tokens could lead to potential regrets if market conditions change.\nReliance on the Arbitrum ecosystem's stability and success.\nAny $PUNKS tokens substituted for $GG would proportionately decrease the DAO’s claim to ETH from the sale of the 16 Cryptopunks held in the Punks fractional vault if/when that sale takes place.\n\nOutcomes:\n\nSuccessful transfer of $PUNKS token and swap to $GG.\nQuantifiable increase in $GG holdings.\nEvaluation of the impact on the DAO's positioning within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nContinuous monitoring and reporting by the Founders DAO Multisig Team.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe successful execution of this proposal will mark a significant step for the Founders DAO in embracing multi-chain functionality and optimizing its asset portfolio, in line with its mission of pioneering and adaptive asset management.",

      "title": "DOT Accelerator Evolution",
      "content": "Title: DOT Accelerator Evolution\n \nAuthor(s): Rolldawg, SanLeo\n \nType: Action\n \nImplementer: Multi-sig Team, RollDawg\n \nCreated Date: Dec 28, 2023\n \n\nSUMMARY\n \nFounders DAO (FD) will burn MP2 to create EVO6s DOTs, in preparation for the Supernova and DOT acceleration.\n\nThis proposal seeks to permit the Multi-sig members of the FD to engage with the FoundersDAO.eth wallet (Wallet: 0x580A96BC816C2324Bdff5eb2a7E159AE7ee63022) to mint DOTs using MP2, as determined in this proposal, to maximize the FD holdings of EVO6.\n \nVOTING CHOICES\n\nOption #1 Maximize EVO6 DOTs. \nEvolve 16 EVO1 DOTs with MP2 to EVO6 (16 EVO1 & 496 MP2). \nMax mint MP2 directly to EVO6 (5472 MP2). \nThis yields 187 EVO6 DOTs. \nThe estimated cost is 1 ETH for gas.\n\nOption #2 Max Mint MP2 directly to EVO6 (5952 MP2). \nThis yields 186 EVO6 DOTs. \nThe estimated cost is 1 ETH for gas.\n\nOption #3 Mint MP2 to EVO1. \nSelect the highest rarity EVO1 DOTs to evolve to EVO6. \nThis Yields 187 EVO6 DOTs. Estimated Costs of 25 ETH for gas.\n\nChoice #4 is to do nothing and costs nothing.\n\nChoice #5 is to abstain and it costs nothing.\n\nABSTRACT\n \nWhat: The FD has 5970 MP2, 16 EVO1 DOTs, and 6470 planet tokens. The FD can create 187 EVO6 DOTs with these holdings. This proposal will increase the FD total of EVO6 DOTs to accelerate the vesting of the FD’s planet tokens to $GG.\n \nWhy: Providing utility to the FoundersDAO.eth wallet by minting MP2 to EVO6 DOTs. EVO6 DOTs will allow the FD to vest their planet dust and convert to $GG quicker through DOT acceleration. Quicker realization of $GG vesting provides flexibility for the FD to best utilize its assets.\n \nHow\n\nOption 1:\nUpon approval, the multi-sig team will be sent 1 ETH for gas costs.\nThe multi-sig team will evolve all 16 EVO1s currently in the FoundersDAO.eth wallet with MP2s (496 MP2). *These EVO1 DOTs were saved from previous FD events and have desirable traits (8 traits, 4 traits, 3+ matching traits, etc.)*\nMax mint remainder of MP2 to EVO6 (5472 MP2).\nYields 187 EVO6 DOTs.\nAny unused ETH will be returned to the FD wallet.\n\nOption 2:\nUpon approval, the multi-sig team will be sent 1 ETH for gas costs.\nThe multi-sig team will max mint MP2 to EVO6 (5952 MP2).\nYields 186 EVO6 DOTs.\nAny unused ETH will be returned to the FD wallet.\n\nOption 3:\n1) Upon approval, the FoundersDAO.eth wallet will disperse 7.5 ETH to the multi-sig team to cover the initial minting gas. *An additional 17.5 ETH will be earmarked and allocated for further gas costs incurred by the multi-sig team.*\n2) Multi-sig team will mint all MP2 to EVO1.\n3) Once all EVO1 DOTs are minted, Rolldawg and the multi-sig team will determine which DOTs will be evolved to EVO6, based upon highest rarity rankings from inhabitants.tools.\n4) Once the highest rarity EVO1 DOTs are chosen, the multi-sig team will begin to evolve all selected EVO1 DOTs by burning the lower rarity EVO1 DOTs. 18 EVO1 DOTS will remain.\n5) If/when during minting and evolving the multi-sig team exhausts the initial allocation of 7.5 ETH, additional ETH allocations for gas can be requested in 5 ETH increments.\n \nWho: Multi-sig team will be responsible for executing the minting and evolution of DOTs from the FoundersDAO.eth wallet. Rolldawg will provide oversight.\n \nWhere: Transactions will take place in the FoundersDAO.eth wallet.\n \n \nPOSITIVES\n \nThis provides utility to the FD’s MP2. Once evolved to EVO6 the DOTs will allow an equal number of planet dust tokens to be converted to $GG 4x quicker, providing liquid $GG to the FD. \n \n\nRISKS\n \nGas will be spent on the evolutions with no guaranteed recoup of value. There is no guarantee that once DOTs have accelerated the $GG vesting they will continue to hold equal or greater value than the equivalent number of MP2. \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n \nFD will convert the holdings of MP2 to EVO6 DOTs via Minting.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n  \nGAS ADDENDUM\nThis section will involve calculations for the gas costs discussed, to show how we arrived at our estimates for ether required. If you don’t need the technical details you can safely skip this section.\n\nA simulation was run to calculate how much gas evolving 500 EVO 1s from MP2 would cost, which can be found here: https://www.tdly.co/shared/simulation/f480a423-5d01-4c00-af52-9b3cc99943d4\nGas cost: 25.91m\n\nA simulation was run to calculate how much gas evolving 186 EVO 6 dots directly from MP2 would cost, which can be found here: https://www.tdly.co/shared/simulation/3d077908-e090-4436-93f4-39c9097998cf\nGas cost: 13.81m\n\nA simulation was run to calculate how much gas evolving 5 EVO1 dots to EVO6 using other EVO1 dots would cost (155 other EVO1s), which can be found here: https://www.tdly.co/shared/simulation/1263e546-97b2-4fea-a101-c2270c251856\nGas cost: 4.51m\n\nA simulation was run to calculate how much gas evolving 5 EVO1 dots to EVO6 using MP2 (155 MP2) would cost, which can be found here: https://www.tdly.co/shared/simulation/1a51e9c2-0e5d-4669-84a2-d19b7c0ee90e\nGas cost: 211k\n\nUsing these numbers we can extrapolate estimated costs for our options.\n\n\n\nOption 1\n\nEvolve 16 EVO1 to EVO6 using MP2: 211000 * 16/5 =675200 \nEvolve 171 EVO6 using 5472 MP2:  13810000 * 171/186 =12696290 \nTotal cost: 13,371,490 gas\n\nOption 2\n\nEvolve 16 EVO1 to EVO6 using MP2: 211000 * 16/5 =675200 \nEvolve 186 EVO6 using 5952 MP2:  13810000 \nTotal cost: 14,485,200 gas\n\nOption 3\n\nMint 5952 EVO1s using MP2: 25910000 * 5952/500 =308432640 \nEvolve 187 EVO6 using 5797 other EVO1s:  4510000 * 187/5 =168674000 \nTotal cost: 477,106,640 gas\n\nGas is a measure of compute, to find the tx fee we must multiply by the current cost of gas, which is variable. A table is provided to show how fees for different options change with the cost of gas. The multi-sig team will attempt to work to keep gas fees low by executing during off-peak times, but must eventually finish the proposal and as such must be prepared for worst-case gas fees.\n\n![DOT EVO gas table.png](ipfs://bafkreiel3fgczxy32i3b5m5yajwkdhtc3tks656rze344ho2kr52nntxry)\n\n\nAs there will be many transactions to execute this proposal, this table is representative of the average price of gas over the many transactions.\nThe base gas for executing multisig txs has not been included in these calculations, but is negligible in comparison.",

This proposal seeks to have all three continue to serve on the committee for another 12-month term, until 5 December 2024. If not reappointed to the Communications Committee, the committee will fall below the minimum threshold of membership of three members. If not reappointed the Communications Committee is threatened with dissolution.\n\nStatements from those seeking re-election:\n\nGooniebrad: Hey founders, goonie here.\nI have thoroughly enjoyed my time on the communications committee thus far and hope y’all see value in my position. My main responsibilities have been posting snapshot-related announcements on both X and Discord along with day-to-day X content that keeps our community in people’s minds and showcases our future potential, which hopefully entices new members to join the DAO. My election for another term will continue to see great engagement from X content. Once BattlePlan! launches you can expect I will be focused on turning BP! & PVFD engagement into new members of our vibrant community. With all the activity fast approaching regarding reboot/BP/$gg, having solid communications will be essential.\n\nJuicyJama: Hey fam Juicy Jama here, most of you know me. A day 1 comic minter, I have been interested in Pixel Vault from the get-go. I always wanted to buy a second comic to burn for PVFD which I never got around to. Was finally able to join the family last year, and it has quickly become my web3 home. My professional background is in I.T. specifically networking and cyber security. I have always been obsessed with gadgets and technology. Always trying to learn a new skill. In 2021 I started creating some NFT content which eventually led to some PVFD members asking if I could help create Moonlings. The rest is history. I have built some incredible connections and more importantly friendships in the community and look forward to getting to know more of you. I have had the pleasure of working with some community members to make tools like the DOT Builder, the MetaHero Tailor, etc. If accepted for this role, I would continue to use my skills to create a content schedule and create content for the official DAO's X account.  To help educate the Founder's DAO messaging across the world, as well as create some fun engaging content where possible. Looking forward to the future and seeing what this community is capable of 🤝\n\nWiggles: Dear Committee Members,\nI've greatly enjoyed my time on the Founders DAO Communications Committee, where I've had the opportunity to enhance our communications strategy. This experience along with my time on the Core Committee has deepened my understanding of our community's needs and has allowed me to effectively see our broader goals.\nWith this background, I am eager to propose the continuation of my role, along with an expansion of my responsibilities:\n1. Hosting Monthly Spaces: Committing to monthly Spaces sessions focused on substantive, relevant discussions for the DAO.\n2.

      "content": "Author(s): Rolldawg\n\nType: Action\n\nImplementer: Multi-sig Team, RollDawg\n\nCreated Date: September 9, 2023\n\nSUMMARY\n\nFounders DAO will burn MP2 to create EVO6 DOTs, in preparation for the Supernova and DOT acceleration.\n\nThis proposal seeks to permit the Multi-sig members of the Founder’s DAO to engage with the FoundersDAO wallet (Wallet: 0x580A96BC816C2324Bdff5eb2a7E159AE7ee63022) to mint MP2, as determined in this proposal, to EVO1 then based on the rarity of Inhabitants.tools, to EVO6. \n\nABSTRACT\n\nWhat: The PVFD has 5970 MP2 and 6470 planet tokens (10 Moon, 97 Mercury, 202 Venus, 73 Earth, 114 Mars, 2.2k Jupiter, 1.9k Saturn, 918 Uranus, 908 Neptune, 48 Pluto). The PVFD has the ability to create 186 EVO6 DOTs to accelerate the $GG vesting from 48 months to 6 months. This proposal will add a number of EVO6 DOTs to the Foundersdao.eth wallet to accelerate the vesting of the DAO’s planet tokens to $GG. \n\nWhy: This provides utility to the Foundersdao.eth wallet in the way of EVO6 DOTs. This proposal will provide that utility through minting EVO6 DOTs which will allow the PVFD to accumulate $GG quicker through DOT vesting acceleration. \n\nHow:\n1) Upon approval, the multi-sig wallet will mint MP2 as determined by this proposal to EVO1. \n\n2) Once all EVO1 DOTs are minted Rolldawg and the Multi-sig team will determine which DOTs will be evolved to EVO6.\n\n3) Once the determination of which DOTs will make it to EVO6 is made, the multi-sig team will begin to evolve all selected DOTs.\n\n4) Once all evolutions have taken place, the MP2 rewards will be distributed.\n\nWho: Multi-sig team will be responsible for executing the minting and evolving from the FoundersDAO wallet. Rolldawg will determine which DOTs will be evolved to EVO 6 and provide oversight.\n\nThe multi-sig team will receive two MP2 each (12 total). Rolldawg will be compensated with six MP2.\n\nWhere: Transactions will take place in the Foundersdao.eth wallet.\n\n\nPOSITIVES\n\nThis provides utility to the PVFD’s MP2. Once evolved to EVO 6 the DOTs will allows an equal number of  planet tokens to be converted to $GG 4x faster. \n\nRISKS\n\nGas will be spent on the evolutions will no guaranteed recoup of value. There is no guarantee that once DOTs have accelerated the $GG vesting they will continue to hold equal or greater value than the equal number of MP2.\nOVERVIEW\n\nMint MP2 to EVO 1 DOTs. Evolve all to EVO 6 based on the highest rarity as determined by inhabitants.tools.\n\nChoice #1 costs all 5970 MP2 owned by PVFD and will yield 186 EVO 6 DOTs.\nChoice #2 costs 75% of MP2 owned by PVFD (4498) and will yield 140 EVO 6 DOTs.\nChoice #3 costs 50% of MP2 owned by PVFD (2994) and will yield 93 EVO 6 DOTs.\nChoice #4 costs 25% of MP2 owned by PVFD (1490) and will yield 46 EVO 6 DOTs.\nChoice #5 is to do nothing and costs nothing.\nChoice #6 is to abstain and costs nothing.",

      "content": "This proposal seeks to update the terms of FoundersDAO SAFE multisig signers.\n\nMultisig signers were elected with a previous proposal <https://snapshot.org/#/foundersdao.eth/proposal/0x3facc1dd180dbbea3faec9820102806aadc9e8952d1387ad00978e45bb72ffaa> but there are a few issues that were overlooked and we need an update.\n\nCurrently Multisig signers are paying the gas fees to execute Founder's DAO multisig transactions from their own pockets and this is not ideal.\n\nAttached is how much each signer spent until August 30th, 2023. Ethereum spent on these transaction executions are not a subject of the previous proposal's terms. (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14kDOitDZU6p2OSd_5abmxvolmxIXjj97H3pQhbXYQkg/)\n\nHere are the new terms:\n\n1-) Multisig signers will receive 0.3 eth each from FoundersDAO SAFE Multisig wallet (which was set and approved with the previous proposal as well) at the beginning of their terms instead of at the end of their terms. Since current signers are already elected they shall receive 0.3 eth on the first available date once and if this proposal passes.\n\n2-) Ethereum spent by FDAO SAFE multisig signers on FDAO SAFE Multisig wallet transaction executions shall be reimbursed to SAFE signers every 3 months from FoundersDAO SAFE Multisig wallet.\n\n3-) Each FoundersDAO SAFE Multisig Signer is responsible for tracking their own transaction executions and the Ethereum they spent as gas fees on their own. They are required to publish these documents to \"Pixel Vault Founders DAO\" token holders via appropriate channels before they receive any type of reimbursement.\n\n--------------------------\n\nExceptional situations:\n1-) If a signer's term expires before the 3 months period of gas reimbursement, the gas they spent on each Founder's DAO gnosis multisig transaction to that date shall be reimbursed by FDAO Multisig Wallet. The signer is required to report each related transaction to FDAO via appropriate channels before the reimbursement.\n\n2-) If all previous signers are being renewed by new signers; all signers from the previous term are responsible for reporting the gas they spent on FDAO multisig TXNs via appropriate channels and the new signers are responsible for paying the gas reimbursement using FDAO SAFE wallet.\n\n--------------------------\n\nAdditional notes:\n\n1-) Daniel G generously offered his signer position to SanLeo to make SAFE transactions more efficient and secure. He worked for 3 months and he was always quick to sign every transaction as well as leading most of the trades. He will receive his 0.3eth/4 = [0.075eth] as his deserved compensation.\n\n--------------------------\n\nReminder:\nThis is the second time we (signers) are proposing the update. And proposal terms are practically the same with what we proposed on 25th of May, 2023.\n<https://snapshot.org/#/foundersdao.eth/proposal/0x75e542e38578b9904646581fe6c1e3c7821ee16ec1ebc900e9bdd11dcc9d76ed>",

      "content": "Proposal Title: Unstaking Founders DAO Punk Comics\n\nDate of Submission: 8/23/2023\n\nProposal Committee: BennyDLowkey \n\nImplementer(s): Multi Sig Team\n\n\n\nAbstract: We propose the unstaking of Founders DAO's Punk Comics. This proposal aims to safely return all of our comics to our wallet, executed by the multi-sig team. By unstaking the comics, we ensure their security and liquidity while contributing to the overall stability of the Founders DAO ecosystem.\n\nMotivation: The primary goal of this proposal is to enhance the security and liquidity of our assets. Unstaking the Punk Comics will minimize the risks associated with keeping them staked, thereby ensuring their availability for any potential utility or trading opportunities. This action aligns with our commitment to responsible asset management and risk reduction.\n\nConnection to Mission: This proposal directly supports the Founders DAO Mission by safeguarding our assets and maximizing their potential utility.

Summarized, the PUNKS Tokenholder Vote propses to authorize the transfer of its community-owned ETH assets to Reboot Protocol’s rewards contract. This transfer is not only a testament to our commitment to the Reboot Protocol but also a necessary step to meet the requirements outlined in the Transparency Report v1.\n\nConclusion:\nIf this proposal passes, the multisig controllers of the Founders DAO should vote directly using the multisig in the PUNKS Tokenholder vote according to the results of this proposal. This must be done sometime between the closing of this proposal (Aug 15) and the closing of the PUNKS Tokenholder vote (Aug 18)",

      "title": "DOT Survival Pool",
      "content": "Title: DOT Survivor Pool\n\nAuthor(s): Rolldawg\n\nType: Community Event(s), Action\n\nImplementer: Multi-sig Team, Communications Committee, Potamus, and RollDawg\n\nCreated Date: July 10, 2023\n\nSUMMARY\n\nFounders DAO will burn MP2 to create EVO6s DOTs. At the conclusion of this proposal, the Founders DAO will have one EVO6 DOT of each back trait.\n\nThis proposal seeks to permit the Multi-sig members of the Founder’s DAO to engage with the FoundersDAO wallet (Wallet: 0x580A96BC816C2324Bdff5eb2a7E159AE7ee63022) to transfer MP2s, as determined in this proposal to the “DOT Madness” wallet (0x84B65890dfc325Ab9Fa90523e82F30E2af2c6570) managed by Potamus to evolve additional DOTs to EVO6.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWhat: The PVFD will use a survival pool mechanic to engage the community with community votes centered around evolving Founders DAO DOTs. At the conclusion of this proposal, the Founders DAO will own one of each EVO6 DOT back traits. \nThere are liquid assets currently totaling ~2.86 ETH in the “DOT Madness” wallet that remain from the DOT Madness proposal. Approval of this proposal will allow the liquid assets to be allocated for all transactions in this proposal.\nThe multi-sig team, the Founders DAO communications committee, Potamus, and Rolldawg will be responsible for the actions in this proposal.\n\nWhy: EVO6 has arrived, which allows the Founders DAO community to forecast how any DOT will appear at the EVO6 level. This proposal will allow the FD to provide a community activity that leverages assets we have on hand. The FD currently has more than 6300 MP2 and only has two EVO6 DOTS. The FD can utilize a fraction of the MP2s in the vault to complete a full set of EVO6 DOTs in the vault. The survivor pools will be organized to allow only new back-trait DOTs not currently owned by the Founders DAO to be eligible to win the survivor pools. \n\nHow:\n1) Upon approval the multi-sig wallet will transfer 320 MP2 to Potamus' “DOT Madness\" wallet (wallet: 0x84B65890dfc325Ab9Fa90523e82F30E2af2c6570). \n\n2) Potamus will evolve all allocated MP2 to EVO1.\n\n3) Pools will be organized by back trait. All back traits will be grouped together (for example all Gun Experts together, all Miners together, etc) to be voted on.\n\n4) Once the Survivor Pools are set the PVFD communications committee will run the voting. The voting duration will allow the community enough time to place their votes.\n\n5) When voting has concluded the Communications Committee will provide Potamus & Rolldawg with a list of the winning DOTs. DOTs that do not win but are either 3 or greater matching traits or 4T/8T will be “rescued\" and returned to the FD wallet and replaced with MP2.\n\n6) Once all DOTs eligible to be rescued are returned to the FD wallet, Potamus will evolve the winning DOTs with the remaining fragments. \n\n7) At the conclusion of evolving Potamus will transfer the DOTs and any unused ETH back to the FoudersDAO wallet.\n\n8) MP2 compensation will be distributed to Potamus & Rolldawg.\n\nWho: Multi-sig team will be responsible for executing any transactions leaving the FoundersDAO wallet. Potamus will execute MP2 to DOT mints, DOT evolutions, and transactions in the DOT Madness wallet. PVFD will vote on the survivor pool(s). PVFD Communications Committee will proctor the voting and promotion of the event and inform Potamus/Rolldawg of the results of community voting. Rolldawg will create the Survivor Pools, supervise DOT rescue, and provide oversight to all aspects of the DOT Survivor Pool.\n\nPotamus & Rolldawg will be compensated with two MP2 each.\n\nWhere: Transactions will take place in Potamus’s wallet until the conclusion of the Pool(s), at which time all assets will be transferred back to the FoundersDAO wallet.\nVoting on the pool will take place via Discord with announced deadlines.\n\nPOSITIVES\n\nThis provides an event for the PVFD to directly participate in and for the Pixel Vault community as a whole to indirectly participate in.  The Founders DAO will have 12 EVO6 DOTs in the vault, curated by the community.\n\nRISKS\n\nTrust in Potamus with FD assets leads to inherent risk that cannot be completely mitigated in a web3 environment. Potamus is however a trusted member of the PV community and an employee of PV, and he flawlessly executed the DOT Madness proposal.\nGas will be spent on the transfer and evolution of assets. There is no guaranteed return on investment of burning MP2s for the evolution of DOTs including gas required to execute these transactions, however, EVO6(s) will be returned to the FoundersDAO wallet that will represent an equal number of fragments used during the evolution process of the DOT Survivor Pool. By the nature of the pool mechanism and for ease of execution, “desirable” DOTs have the potential to be burned based on the voting of the community. Compensation in the form of MP2 will be spent and will not have a tangible return to the Founders DAO.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nAllocate and Transfer 324 MP2 to execute a survivor pool(s) that the PVFD will vote on. The PVFD Communications Committee will run the voting. Potamus will execute transactions. Rolldawg will provide oversight to the process and ensure deadlines are adhered to and executed smoothly.\n\n-Choice #1 costs 324 MP2 (320 to burn/evolve & 4 for compensation). Will yield 10 EVO6 DOTs for the Founders DAO.\n-Choice #2 Costs nothing, and nothing will happen.\n-Choice #3 Abstain to vote, but you will be included to meet quorum.",

      "content": "The Founder’s DAO is the heart of the Pixel Vault community and the most vibrant online space where Pixel Vault-related discussions occur. Vibrant online communities are essential for growth, education and engagement and I believe that keeping the Founder’s DAO community invisible behind a token-gated discord may be detracting from the greater Pixel Vault ecosystem. This also materially detracts from the Founder’s DAO, given that the DAO holds primarily Pixel Vault assets and has a primary interest in advancing, promoting and building alongside the larger PV ecosystem.\n\nOver the next 60 days we expect that Battle Plan! and the Reboot protocol will launch. This will be a critical period for engagement, and attention and discussion around the game is important for onboarding new players and community members. Despite prior efforts to shift discussion to the main Pixel Vault channel, this has proven difficult to make a persistent habit for Founder's DAO members.\n\nI (Zentensivist) propose a 60-day period where the Founder’s DAO channel would be open, with read-only access to all members of the Pixel Vault discord. Members of the discord could view the Founder’s DAO main channel chat, but could only post if they held a Founder’s DAO token.\n\nOverview:\n\nDespite the excellent work and continual presence of the moderator team, the general Pixel Vault and UPDAO chats see a very low volume of chat activity, and few daily active users outside the moderator team and Founder’s DAO members.\n\nIn contrast, the Founder’s DAO main channel is lively 24 hours a day with news, speculation and discussion largely related to Punks Comic, Inhabitants Universe and other Pixel Vault related discussion, in addition to discussion about the larger crypto and web3 space.\n\nWhile access to the Founder’s DAO discord channel is a key benefit to holding a Founder’s DAO token, I believe that it is possible that hiding all DAO discussion behind a token-gated channel actually detracts from the DAO’s progress toward its goals of promoting and generating excitement about the Pixel Vault ecosystem, given that vast majority of all value in the DAO wallet is held in Pixel Vault assets.\n\nTherefore, I propose a 60-day trial of opening up the Founder’s DAO main discord channel to allow for read-only access to any member of the Pixel Vault discord. This will coincide with the launch of Reboot and the initial phase of Battle Plan!, which I believe is a key period to maximize engagement and discussion.\n\nI believe this would potentially be a net positive for the Founder’s DAO for several reasons:\n\n-It would allow the larger community, both within Pixel Vault and the NFT community at large to see how active the Founder’s DAO discord remains even in a bear market\n\n-It would allow people to view and experience discussions that happen in the Founder’s DAO around the strategic decision making and game theory that is the hallmark of the Pixel Vault ecosystem.\n\n-While engaging, the complexity of the ecosystem can be daunting and allowing people to view the ongoing discussion within the Founder’s DAO could spur interest and help onboard new members. As a result it may generate both more interest in the Founder’s DAO, and in the larger Pixel Vault ecosystem, both of which would ultimately benefit the DAO. It may also spur more activity within the Pixel Vault general chat.\n\nPotential downsides include:\n\n-Part of the value of the Founder’s DAO token lies in access to the exclusive discord channel. Making this access less exclusive could detract from this specific aspect\n\n-The Founder’s DAO channel can be a site of criticism and open discussion, some of which the community and Pixel Vault may prefer to not be entirely open to the public. Having the channel open with read-only access could cause members to be less open within the channel.\n\nI believe that over the prior trial period of read-only access that the upsides outweighed the downsides, and that another read-only period would benefit the DAO and larger PV community. \n\nThis proposal is for another time limited period of read-only access, and after 60 days this would expire and the DAO general channel would return to being viewable only to holders. The DAO would have to make a new proposal to extend read-only access or make read-only access permanent.",

      "content": "This proposal seeks to update the terms of FoundersDAO SAFE multisig signers.\n\nMultisig signers were elected with a previous proposal (https://snapshot.org/#/foundersdao.eth/proposal/0x3facc1dd180dbbea3faec9820102806aadc9e8952d1387ad00978e45bb72ffaa) but there are a few issues that were overlooked and we need an update.\n\nCurrently Multisig signers are paying the gas fees to execute Founder's DAO multisig transactions from their pockets and this is not ideal.\n\nAttached is how much each signer spent until May 22nd, 2023. Ethereum spent on these transaction executions are not a subject of previous proposal's terms. (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14kDOitDZU6p2OSd_5abmxvolmxIXjj97H3pQhbXYQkg/)\n\nHere are the new terms:\n\n1-) Multisig signers will receive 0.3 eth each from FoundersDAO SAFE Multisig wallet (which was set and approved with the previous proposal as well) at the beginning of their terms instead of at the end of their terms. Since current signers are already elected they shall receive 0.3 eth on the first available date once and if this proposal passes.\n\n2-) Ethereum spent by FDAO SAFE multisig signers on FDAO SAFE Multisig wallet transaction executions shall be reimbursed to SAFE signers every 3 months from FoundersDAO SAFE Multisig wallet.\n\n3-) Each FoundersDAO SAFE Multisig Signer is responsible of tracking their own transaction executions and the Ethereum they spent as gas fees on their own. They are required to publish these documents to \"Pixel Vault Founders DAO\" token holders via appropriate channels before they receive any type of reimbursement.\n\n---\n\nExceptional situations:\n1-) If a signer's term expires before the 3 months period of gas reimbursement, the gas they spent on each Founder's DAO gnosis multisig transaction to that date shall be reimbursed by FDAO Multisig Wallet. The signer is required to report each related transaction to FDAO via appropriate channels before the reimbursement.\n\n2-) If all previous signers are being renewed by new signers; all signers from the previous term are responsible of reporting the gas they spent on FDAO multisig TXNs via appropriate channels and the new signers are responsible of paying the gas reimbursement using FDAO SAFE wallet.\n\n---\n\nAdditional notes:\n\n1-) Daniel G generously offered his signer position to SanLeo to make SAFE transactions more efficient and secure. He worked for 3 months and he was always quick to sign every transaction as well as leading most of the trades. He will receive his 0.3eth/4 = [0.075eth] as his deserved compensation.",

      "content": "Acquire Inhabitants for the Pixel Vault Founders DAO (PVFD)\nAuthors: @rolldawg\nType: Acquisition\nImplementor: Multi-sig Team, Trading Team\nCreated Date: May 17, 2023\n\nSUMMARY: This proposal will allow the PVFD Trading Team to purchase 50 Inhabitants: Generative Identities (PiPs) for no more than 25 ETH for an average cost of 0.5 ETH each with a time limit of six weeks. \n\nABSTRACT: \nWhat: The FoundersDAO currently has ~180 ETH (ETH & WETH) in liquidity. This purchase will utilize less than 14% of the total ETH held by the FoundersDAO. \n\nWhy: This proposal would capitalize on the current low price of PiPs prior to the Battle Plan! game release, continuing to align FD vault holdings with Pixel Vault’s impending game execution, while further reducing the FD’s cost-average of their Inhabitants’ Generative Identities.\n\nWho/Where: Multi-sig team will be responsible for all transactions leaving the FoundersDAO.eth wallet (FD wallet: 0x580A96BC816C2324Bdff5eb2a7E159AE7ee63022). Trading Team: bennydlowkey#1164 & daniel g#8576, will be responsible for any purchasing and negotiating to acquire PiPs from the Trading Team hot wallet (0x1993f7392A94f15847D9c2881A590C8a2e1d55Bb) and transferring PiPs to the FoundersDAO.eth wallet.\n\nHow: The Multi-sig team will transfer 8 ETH to the Trading Team hot wallet. \nPurchasing committee uses funds to make PiP purchases.\nPiPs will be transferred to the FD wallet immediately after purchase to ensure a low value is maintained in the hot wallet.\nWhen the hot wallet value falls below 3 ETH, the Trading Team will notify the Multi-sig team which will then send another 8 ETH to the Trading Team hot wallet.\nThe above process repeats until the specified amount of PiPs has been purchased.\nWhen complete or time expires, the remaining Trading Team hot wallet funds will be sent back to the FD wallet.\n\nPOSITIVES: Lower the FD’s cost average of PiPs owned. Align FD vault holdings with Pixel Vault’s execution and building. Increase the FD’s potential benefit with Pixel Vault’s impending release of Battle Plan! game. FD wallet will have ~155 ETH following the execution of this proposal.\n\nRISKS: Battle Plan! has no guarantee of improving market sentiment surrounding PiPs. PiPs prices may continue to fall. The trading wallet could become compromised. No guaranteed financial return from the execution of this proposal.\n\nOVERVIEW: This proposal will allow the PVFD Trading Team to purchase 50 Inhabitants: Generative Identities (PiPs) for no more than 25 ETH for an average cost of 0.5 ETH each with a time limit of six weeks.

      "content": "Authors: [BennyDLowkey, SanLeo]\nType: Proposal\nImplementer: Multi-sig Team\nCreated Date: [5/3/23]\n\nAbstract:\nThis proposal aims to approve the replacement of multi-sig member Daniel G with SanLeo in the Founder's DAO. The objective is to include a developer in the multi-sig team, which will bring significant benefits to the community.\n\nMotivation:\nThe inclusion of a developer in the multi-sig team is crucial for the Founder's DAO to enhance its technical capabilities and address the evolving needs of the community. By replacing Daniel G with SanLeo, who has the necessary developer skills, the DAO will have a member who can contribute actively to the technical decision-making process and provide valuable insights and expertise.\n\nConnection to Mission:\nThe Founder's DAO's mission is to create a decentralized organization that empowers its members to make informed decisions and foster the growth of the community. By approving the switching of multi-sig members and adding a developer to the team, the DAO aligns with its mission by strengthening its technical capacities and ensuring that decisions regarding technical aspects are made by individuals with relevant expertise.\n\nSpecification:\nThe proposal will involve the following technical details:\n\nRemoval of Daniel G as a multi-sig member from the DAO's governance structure.\nAddition of SanLeo as a multi-sig member, bringing developer expertise to the governance process.\n\nUpdating the DAO's documentation and records to reflect the change in multi-sig members.\n\nExecution:\nThe proposal will be executed through the following steps:\n\nFounder's DAO members will vote on the proposal and provide feedback.\nIf the proposal is approved, the DAO will initiate the process of removing Daniel G as a multi-sig member.\n\nSanLeo will be invited and onboarded as a new multi-sig member, following the DAO's established procedures.\n\nThe DAO's documentation and records will be updated to reflect the new multi-sig member composition.\n\nBenefits:\nThe proposed benefits of switching multi-sig members are as follows:\n\nInclusion of a developer in the multi-sig team, enabling technical decision-making aligned with community needs.\nAccess to expertise and insights from a developer to guide the DAO's technical strategies.\nEnhanced technical capabilities and responsiveness to community requirements.\nAbility to enhance security by determining suitability for direct use of multisig when interacting with contracts and protocols, over other solutions such as hot wallets.\nAbility to save on fees by crafting more complex and optimized multisig transactions.\n\nDrawbacks:\nThe potential drawbacks of the proposal are as follows:\n\nLoss of Daniel G's expertise and contributions in non-technical aspects of governance.\n\nOutcomes:\nThe expected outcomes of the proposal are as follows:\n\nSuccessful replacement of Daniel G with SanLeo as a multi-sig member.\nImproved technical decision-making and execution within the Founder's DAO.\nFeedback and progress reports on technical initiatives shared with the community.\n\nThe updated multi-sig member composition and documentation will be reported to the Founder's DAO community.",

The multi-sig team, the FoundersDAO wallet, the Founders DAO communications committee, Potamus, and Rolldawg will be responsible for the actions in this proposal.\n\nWhy: The final EVO of DOTs is fast approaching, which is the last time the Founders DAO can align a community event to coincide with a known DOT event of Pixel Vault’s. The FD will capitalize on and enhance the momentum around EVO6 with a fun activity that leverages assets we have on hand. The FD currently has roughly 6300 MP2 and is only currently slated to have two EVO6 DOTS. The FD can utilize a fraction of the MP2s in the vault to add additional EVO6 DOT(s) to the vault. Creating an additional EVO6 DOT(s) will allow the FD to participate in the final known anomaly event. The survivor pools will be seeded specifically to allow new back-trait DOTs* to be eligible to win the survivor pool, maximizing the variety of DOTs in the FD vault.\n*Based on evolving DOT#1 and DOT Madness the FD vault will have a Terraformer and either a Subscripter or Bard. This proposal aims to avoid adding another EVO6 with these back traits.\n\nHow:\n1) Upon approval the multi-sig wallet will transfer the appropriate amount of MP2 to Potamus (wallet: 0x84B65890dfc325Ab9Fa90523e82F30E2af2c6570):\n1 Survivor Pool = 32 MP2\n2 Survivor Pools = 64 MP2\n3 Survivor Pools = 96 MP2\n\n2) Potamus will evolve all allocated MP2 to EVO1.\n\n3) If multiple Survival Pools are implemented Rolldawg will allocate DOTs to the various pools to allow for balance and to reduce the chance of multiples of a winning back-trait.\n\n4) Once the Survivor Pools are set the PVFD communications committee will run the voting. The voting duration will conclude with sufficient time to allow the evolution of the winning DOT(s) prior to the anomaly event.\n\n5) When voting has concluded the Communications Committee will provide Potamus with a list of the winning DOTs* and Potamus will upgrade the list of winners. \n\n6) At the conclusion of EVO6 Potamus will transfer the DOT(s) and any unused ETH back to the FoudersDAO wallet.\n\n7) MP2 compensation will be distributed to Potamus & Rolldawg.\n\n*If a “Rescue” option is agreed upon eligible DOTs will be returned to the FD wallet and replaced with MP2s. Eligible DOTs to be saved are 3+ matching traits, 4T/8T, and ear trait DOTs. (Rescue is the same concept as “Tampering” from the DOT Madness proposal)\n\nWho: Multi-sig team will be responsible for executing any transactions leaving the FoundersDAO wallet. Potamus will execute MP2 to DOT mints, DOT evolutions, and transactions. PVFD will vote on the survivor pool(s). PVFD Communications Committee will proctor the voting and promotion of the event and inform Potamus of the results of community voting. Rolldawg will create the Survivor Pools to optimize balance, reduce the opportunity of a duplicate back-trait to enter the vault, and provide oversight to all aspects of the DOT Survivor Pool.\n\nPotamus & Rolldawg will be compensated with two MP2 each.\n\nWhere: Transactions will take place in Potamus’s wallet until the conclusion of the Pool(s), at which time all assets will be transferred back to the FoundersDAO wallet.\nVoting on the pool will take place via discord with an announced deadline.\n\nPOSITIVES\n\nCapitalize on the hype and momentum of the DOTs EVO6 event. This gives an additional event for the PVFD to directly participate in and for the Pixel Vault community as a whole to indirectly participate in pool winner reveals, evolution reveals, and potential anomaly reveals.\n\nRISKS\n\nTrust in Potamus with FD assets leads to inherent risk that cannot be completely mitigated in a web3 environment. Potamus is however a trusted member of the PV community and an employee of PV. Gas will be spent on the transfer and evolution of assets. There is no guaranteed return on investment of burning MP2s for the evolution of DOTs including gas required to execute these transactions, however, EVO6(s) will be returned to the Founders DAO wallet that will represent an equal number of fragments used during the evolution process of the DOT Survivor Pool. By the nature of the pool mechanism and for ease of execution, “desirable” DOTs have the potential to be burned based on the voting of the community. Compensation in the form of MP2 will be spent and will not have a tangible return to the Founders DAO.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nAllocate and Transfer 32/64/96 MP2 to execute a survivor pool that the PVFD will vote on. The evolution will take place prior to the anomaly event to ensure participation in it. The PVFD Communications Committee will run the voting. Potamus will execute transactions. Rolldawg will provide oversight to the process and ensure deadlines are adhered to and executed smoothly.\n\nChoice #1 costs 36 MP2 (32 to burn/evolve & 4 for compensation). Will yield 1 EVO6 DOT for the Founders DAO.\nChoice #2 costs 36 MP2 (32 to burn/evolve + rescue swaps & 4 for compensation). Will yield 1 EVO6 DOT for the Founders DAO and the possibility of “rescued” DOTs. See above in the HOW section for specifications of rescuing DOTs.\nChoice #3 costs 68 MP2 (64 to burn/evolve & 4 for compensation). Will yield 2 EVO6 DOTs for the Founders DAO.\nChoice #4 costs 68 MP2 (64 to burn/evolve + any rescue swaps & 4 for compensation). Will yield 2 EVO6 DOTs for the Founders DAO and the possibility of redeemed DOTs. See above in the HOW section for specifications of rescuing DOTs.\nChoice #5 costs 100 MP2 (96 to burn/evolve + rescue swaps & 4 for compensation). Will yield 3 EVO6 DOT for the Founders DAO and the possibility of redeemed DOTs. See above in the HOW section for specifications of rescuing DOTs. \nChoice #6 Costs nothing, and nothing will happen.\nChoice #7 Abstain to vote, but you will be included to meet quorum.",

      "content": "**Abstract:** \n\nI (Zentensivist https://twitter.com/zentensivist) would like to remain a member of the Founder’s DAO communications committee following the expiration of my initial one year term, which is set to expire April 1, 2023. Per the committee charter, this requires a community vote. This proposal is to seek community approval to remain on the committee for an additional one year term.\n\n**Details:**\n\nThe last year has been a challenging one for the DAO, but also a year of tremendous growth, fun and learning. I remain as committed as ever to helping the DAO succeed, both as the center of gravity of the Pixel Vault community and as an independent entity with its own goals and aspirations.\n\nTo make the case for staying on, I put forward here some of the accomplishments I am proud to have led or contributed to this year:\n\n--I conceived of and helped to implement the Community Content challenge, which helped to inspire and reward such tools as the Dot Builder (https://dotbuilder.flutterflow.app/#/), DOT rarity tools (https://www.inhabitants.tools/pips/rarity), and Bevs’ initial video series before being hired by Pixel Vault.\n\n--I am the primary author of the Founder’s DAO gitbook (https://foundersdao.gitbook.io/founders-dao-assets/, unfortunately not adopted as an official Founder’s DAO document due to not reaching quorum during the summer doldrums of 2022)\n\n--From the months of approximately August 2022 to February 2023 I primarily operated the Founder’s DAO twitter account, and helped grow it from inception to over 4,000 followers.\n\n--I have authored a regular series of threads educating, updating and promoting the Founder's DAO, Punks Comic and Inhabitants Universe. The most recent example of this was an explainer of the Reboot Whitepaper which has garnered nearly 60,000 impressions on Twitter (https://twitter.com/zentensivist/status/1631363143824977921)\n\nMy goals for next year, should I stay on:\n\n--Continue my primary current role as a writer and communicator to educate and promote the Founder’s DAO and broader Pixel Vault ecosystem, as this represents the primary value of the DAO’s collection of assets.\n\n--Continue finding innovative ways to reward community generated content from DAO members, and promote the activities of DAO members.\n\n--Re-submit the Founder’s DAO gitbook for approval as an official Founder’s DAO document, and continue to keep it updated as a resource both for DAO members and as a marketing tool to display our impressive holdings.\n\n--Establish a closer link with the executive committee to do more education and promotion around DAO specific activities",

      "title": "Alpha Channel Proposal",
      "content": "Founder's Alpha Proposal\nAuthor: 2ToN\nType: Implementation of Alpha Channel\nDate: 3/06/2023\n\nSummary:\nThis is a proposal to create an Alpha Channel for the Founder's DAO that would be housed on the Pixel Vault server, and will be token gated to Founder's DAO token holders only. There are two parts to the proposal - an abridged version with the salient points and a longer version that will explain the mechanics of the agreement in detail. I know many of you hate reading and would rather have some bullet points while others want a longform explanation of everything, so best of both worlds!\n\nABRIDGED VERSION\nThe purpose of the Alpha Channel has many primary objectives which will be outlined in short here. Please check the longform version below for a more detailed explanation of how it will all be implemented and the prices attached.\n\n- A channel that is token gated to Founder's DAO token holders only, with future changes in subscription models to be determined by DAO vote. \n- Alpha tools/bots will be developed by the hired developer (SanLeo461) then, in conjunction with the PV team, be implemented within the PV discord. It would take a few months to fully deploy all bots, with weekly to bi-weekly updates along the way. Expected timeline and tools being built can be seen here: https://i.imgur.com/w4CNopi.png Tentative timeline, subject to change\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1qgH2rExpDL5VoOX-41pikjRmp8rlB-vZh9dUiuTzbb4/edit?usp=sharing Tools\n- The channel can be open immediately for alpha/trading discussion while waiting for the bot deployments. There will be a developer discord during this time, which the dev will invite FD members/PV team over to check out the bots. This allows some testing and feedback from the community to SanLeo461 as things progress towards a final product for deployment\n- A central alpha hub within PV that allows focused trading discussion to take place without taking away attention from other discussions or get lost in conversation\n\nBenefits to the DAO\n- The alpha channel should be a strong sales driver for the FD token which would increase royalties paid out to the DAO (we now receive 100% of the royalties)\n- Reintroduce what made FD such a popular buy to many traders' portfolios with focused and engaged trading/alpha discussion, just like the old days\n- A sharper focus on trading/alpha discussion would hopefully entice more traders to join in the conversation and bring their knowledge to the table, which in turn strengthens the reputation of the FD and becomes an attractive option for future collabs/partnerships\n- Potential to not only be a passive revenue for the FD but the strengthened reputation and value add to the token should incentivize a larger voting turnout for future endeavors related to FD business decisions/proposals as well as bring back some FD holders who may have felt left out due to diminished alpha/trading discussions\n- Increased visibility on FD showcasing how much value FD can give back to its holders through its treasury and connections\n- Help embolden the community to come together and increase visibility of the FD through such initiatives like events, spaces held by Comms committee that could showcase early projects and/or upcoming alpha, discord AMAs, and much more. FD needs to give the Comms committee something to actively market and come up with ideas and creative ways to get the FD brand out in the open\n\nLONGFORM VERSION\n\nThe purpose of the longform version is to explain how many of the proposed mechanics would be implemented and the costs to do so. This includes the format once the channel is created, security, moderation, salaries, tools to be used, and more.\n\nAgreement Overview\nThe Founder's DAO shall do the following pursuant to the agreement:\nUpon the passing of the proposal, the Founder's DAO will go into a contract with SanLeo461 to provide the services needed to create the infrastructure for the Alpha discord. These services are as follows but not limited to:\n- Creation of the developer's discord for invited FD users and PV team to test beta software and discover bugs, as well as give any early feedback to help improve the software\n- Coordination with Pixel Vault team on best security measures and deployment/deletion of desired alpha tools/bots as listed in timeline\n- Addition of a server such as VPS (Virtual Private Server) and a node service such as QuickNode for development purposes and to satisfy blockchain requirements of the alpha bot software\n- Maintenance/upkeep of the alpha bot software such as server/node service costs, and any bugfixes/updates of the aforementioned tools/bots\n- Minor technical support\n\n\nTERM\n\n- SanLeo461 will be under contract for as long as needed to fully flesh out the alpha bot software and tools as dictated on the timeline. It is expected to be completed within 90 days after the execution of the contract\n- The alpha channel will be up indefinitely until otherwise voted by the DAO, and it will have the license to use the tools in perpetuity from SanLeo461 as outlined in the contract. The Founder's DAO will then sub-license to Pixel Vault in order to deploy the tools within its server on behalf of the FD\n- SanLeo461 will go into a 180 day term cycle for the services of bot/software maintenance/upkeep, bugfixes, and technical support within reason after completion of the tools as outlined in the contract's deliverables\n\nDEVELOPER RESUME\n\nSanLeo461 has worked with several Web3 companies/projects over the years such as NFTSensei, hebys.io, Odious' Odiville, and was the main developer for Chill Bears Club which many of you may already know about.\n- Worked on bounty program for NFTSensei, writing modules for newly launched mints/projects for their mint bot\n- Currently working with hebys.io's NFT search engine analysis work, blockchain data, and decoding software\n- Currently working with Odious' Odiville as the principcal developer, further details cannot be revealed for privacy reasons\n- Main developer for Chill Bears Club, helped create the infrastructure and maintenance of the discord such as the dApps, smart contracts, cross-chain systems, and more\n- 7+ years of software coding experience\n- Won a recent CTF hacking competition at his university, aided by security + hacking experience from managing large-scale Minecraft servers that were under constant attacks\n- Proficient in majority of programming languages such as Java, Kotlin, C#, Python, Rust, Solidity, JavaScript, and much more\n\nCOST & EXPENSES\n\n- The Founder's DAO will pay $10,000 to SanLeo461, in ETH equivalent to the USD value of the agreed upon price at the time of payment(s), for the completion of the alpha bot software within the following parameters: \n\t- 15% deposit upfront before any work is done\n\t- 10% of full amount weekly after the initial \tdeposit, 5% will be the final payment.\nEach payment will be the ETH equivalent of the agreed upon prices at the time of the payment(s).\n- After the completion of the alpha discord as according to the contract, the Founder's DAO will retain SanLeo461 for 180 days for maintenance/upkeep, bugfixes/updates, and minor technical support. This will cost the Founder's DAO $1,000 USD, payable in ETH equivalent to the agreed upon price at the time of payment(s), per 30 days after competion of deliverables.

It is my hope that eventually we will simply let the community vote within the channels and the committee tasked with managing it all will be able to quickly implement necessary changes and/or requests. \n\nFor now, SanLeo461 will coordinate with Pixel Vault team to take any necessary security/audit checks/changes and both the Executive committee and Pixel Vault team will help manage the channel(s) until such a designated committee is created and/or selected. \n\nMODERATION\nThe Pixel Vault team will help moderate any additional channels in the FD section of the server as they have continued to do so in the past. There may be an easement of workload or sharing of moderation duties in the future through steerco/sub-committee elections.\n\nLEGAL\n\nAll matters related to legal will be handled and outlined within the contract signed upon between SanLeo461 and Founder's DAO. Any other legals between Founder's DAO and Pixel Vault will be handled in the sub-license agreement.",

      "title": "Proposal to create an Alpha Discord",
      "content": "Founder's Alpha Proposal\nAuthor: 2ToN\nType: Implementation of Alpha Discord\nDate; 2/24/22\n\nSummary:\nThis is a proposal to create an Alpha Discord that is separate from the Pixel Vault server that would be token gated to Founder's DAO token holders only. There will be two parts to the proposal - an abridged version with the salient points and a longer version that will explain the mechanics of the agreement in detail. I know many of you hate reading and would rather have some bullet points while others want a longform explanation of everything, so best of both worlds!\n\nABRIDGED VERSION\nThe purpose of the Alpha Discord has many primary objectives which will be outlined in short here. Please check the longform version below for a more detailed explanation of how it will all be implemented and the prices attached.\n\n- A discord that is token gated to Founder's DAO token holders only, with future changes in subscription models to be determined by DAO vote. \n- Alpha tools/bots will be implemented within the discord by the hired developer - SanLeo461. It would take a few months to fully flesh it out, with weekly to bi-weekly updates along the way. Expected timeline and tools being built can be seen here: https://i.imgur.com/w4CNopi.png Tentative timeline, subject to change\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1qgH2rExpDL5VoOX-41pikjRmp8rlB-vZh9dUiuTzbb4/edit?usp=sharing Tools\n- The discord can be open for all as early as a few weeks after the first update is done as according to the timeline. This allows some testing and feedback from the community to SanLeo461 as things progress\n- A central hub that would represent the Founder's DAO brand that everyone within the community can share with anyone and everyone across the board. Think socials and branding!\n\nBenefits to the DAO\n- The alpha discord should be a strong sales driver for the FD token which would increase royalties paid out to the DAO (we now receive 100% of the royalties)\n- Reintroduce what made FD such a popular buy to many traders' portfolios with focused and engaged trading/alpha discussion, just like the old days\n- A sharper focus on trading/alpha discussion would hopefully entice more traders to join in the conversation and bring their knowledge to the table, which in turn strengthens the reputation of the FD and becomes an attractive option for future collabs/partnerships\n- Potential to not only be a passive revenue for the FD but the strengthened reputation and value add to the token should incentivize a larger voting turnout for future endeavors related to FD business decisions/proposals\n- Increased visibility on FD showcasing how much value FD can give back to its holders through its treasury and connections\n- Help embolden the community to come together and increase visibility of the FD through such initiatives like events, spaces held by Comms committee that could showcase early projects and/or upcoming alpha, and much more without worry of infringing upon other parties. It is the best route towards legitimatizing Founder's DAO as not only a reputable brand but a project worth investing in and collaborating with.\n\nDue to the intrinsic nature of the permissions within discords, having the alpha discord separate from the Pixel Vault discord would be in our best interest. This is because ownership and admin permissions will be interchanging hands over time as outlined in the proposal. A centralized hub for alpha and trading discussion shared among members is imperative for the future success of Founder's DAO. Should this proposal be approved, expect to see follow-up proposals that would help further bolster the alpha discord.\n\nLONGFORM VERSION\n\nThe purpose of the longform version is to explain how many of the proposed mechanics would be implemented and the cost to do so. This includes the infrastructure in place once the discord is created, security and admin duties, moderation, salaries, tools to be used, and more.\n\nAgreement Overview\nThe Founder's DAO shall do the following pursuant to the agreement:\nUpon the passing of the proposal, the Founder's DAO will go into a contract with SanLeo461 to provide the services needed to create the infrastructure for the Alpha discord. These services are as follows but not limited to:\n- Creation of the discord\n- Infrastructure in place for security measures and deployment/deletion of desired alpha tools/bots as listed in timeline\n- Addition of a server such as VPS (Virtual Private Server) and a node service such as QuickNode for development purposes and to satisfy blockchain requirements of the alpha bot software\n- Admin duties for auditing the security and technical work within the discord\n- Maintenance/upkeep of the discord such as server/node service costs, and any bugfixes of the aforementioned tools/bots\n- Minor technical support\n\n\nTERM\n\n- SanLeo461 will be under contract for as long as needed to fully flesh out the alpha discord as dictated on the timeline. It is expected to be completed within 90 days after the execution of the contract\n- Upon completion of the development of the alpha discord to the best of SanLeo461's abilities, ownership of the alpha discord shall be transferred to a member of the Executive Committee - Bennydlowkey - until such time that is otherwise voted by future steering committees/sub-committees or Founder's DAO. SanLeo461 will restrict permissions to the highest degree possible for himself and any alpha bots to increase security before the transfer takes place.\n- The alpha discord will be up indefinitely until otherwise voted by the DAO, and it will have the license to use the tools in perpetuity from SanLeo461 as outlined in the contract\n- SanLeo461 will go into a 180 day term cycle for the services of discord maintenance/upkeep, bugfixes and technical support within reason after completion of the alpha discord\n\nDEVELOPER RESUME\n\nSanLeo461 has worked with several Web3 companies/projects over the years such as NFTSensei, hebys.io, Odious' Odiville, and was the main developer for Chill Bears Club which many of you may already know about.\n- Worked on bounty program for NFTSensei, writing modules for newly launched mints/projects for their mint bot\n- Currently working with hebys.io's NFT search engine analysis work, blockchain data, and decoding software\n- Currently working with Odious' Odiville as the principcal developer, further details cannot be revealed for privacy reasons\n- Main developer for Chill Bears Club, helped create the infrastructure and maintenance of the discord such as the dApps, smart contracts, cross-chain systems, and more\n- 7+ years of software coding experience\n- Won a recent CTF hacking competition at his university, aided by security + hacking experience from managing large-scale Minecraft servers that were under constant attacks\n- Proficient in majority of programming languages such as Java, Kotlin, C#, Python, Rust, Solidity, JavaScript, and much more\n\nCOST & EXPENSES\n\n- The Founder's DAO will pay $10,000 to SanLeo461 in ETH for the completion of the alpha discord's infrastructure and alpha bot software within the following parameters: \n\t- 15% deposit upfront before any work is done\n\t- 10% of full amount weekly after the initial \tdeposit, 5% will be the final payment.\nEach payment will be the ETH equivalent of the agreed upon prices at the time of the payment(s).\n- After the completion of the alpha discord as according to the contract, the Founder's DAO will retain SanLeo461 for 180 days for maintenance/upkeep, security audit and bugfixes, and minor technical support. This will cost the Founder's Dao $1.000 USD, payable in ETH equivalent to the agreed upon price at the time of payment, per 30 days upon the completion of the alpha discord. Termination rights and notices will be outlined in the contract.\n- Total expected cost is $16,000 USD, split between the 90 day contract for the delivery of the alpha discord ($10,000) and the 180 day contract for the maintenance/upkeep and technical support of the alpha discord ($1,000 per month)\n\nFUTURE MANAGEMENT\n\nIt is expected that the alpha discord will be managed by either the steering committee or a sub-committee dedicated to running the alpha discord without the cumbersome red tape associated with DAO voting for specific permission(s) to take action on any necessary decisions. It is my hope that eventually we will simply let the community vote within the discord and the committee tasked with managing it all will be able to quickly implement necessary changes and/or requests. \n\nFor now, SanLeo461 will handle admin duties for security/audit purposes and Bennydlowkey will help manage the discord under the advisement of both Executive Committee and the collective FD community until such a designated committee is created and/or selected. \n\nMODERATION\n\nThe executive committee will help with the moderation of the server at their own discretion until there is a committee/sub-committee in place to take over the management of the alpha discord. Any contract or money/assets exchanged will be up for DAO voting in regards to moderation.\n\nLEGAL\n\nAll matters related to legal will be handled and outlined within the contract signed upon between SanLeo461 and Founder's DAO.\n",

      "title": "Winner Selection for Content Challenge #2 Inhabitants Universe ",
      "content": "The FoundersDAO communication’s committee launched the second ‘Community Content Challenges’ on November 15th. The second content challenge was focused on the Inhabitants  Universe and the guidelines were simple - create content that helps educate and promote the Inhabitant Universe. The challenge is now closed and we are thrilled to have received 14 submissions from 10 individuals. The content produced is wide ranging, informative and fun.\n\nNow, each FoundersDAO community member needs to vote and rank each submission based on what you believe best delivered on the mission of creating content that “educates and promotes the Inhabitant Universe”. One member gets one vote, as this is a community poll of what content best represented the community and IP. \n\nThe reward structure is tiered and the final ranking (via community voting) will determine how many Mint Pass 2’s each submission is rewarded. There are 10 possible rewards, so each submission will win at least 1 Mint Pass 2. The breakdown of rewards are as follows:\n\n1st - 20 MP2\n2nd - 10 MP2\n3rd - 5 MP2\n4th - 5 MP2\n5th - 5 MP2\n6-10th - each will receive 1 MP2\n\nEach PVFD holder should vote/rank all content creators 1st - 10th. The 1st position is the best and will receive 20MP2’s and 10th is your least favorite and will receive 1 MP2. We will then tally all points (10 pts for a 1st place vote, 9 pts for 2nd, etc) and assign a final ranking according to the community’s vote. Additionally, there is only 1 vote per token holder. So if you hold 10 PVFD’s then your vote/ranking will only be counted once. \n\nPlease take a moment to review all 14 submissions below, then rank them from 1 (best) to 10 (least favorite). Once voting closes we will tabulate the final ranking and share with the community.\n\nThanks and we hope you enjoy the community's effort!\n\nCOMMUNITY CONTENT CHALLENGE #1 SUBMISSIONS\n\n1.

      "content": "\nProposal Title: Vote to Select The Official Founders DAO Mission Statement\n\nDate of Submission: 2/15/23\n\nProposal Committee: The Executive Committee \n\nImplementer(s): The Executive Committee will be responsible for creating and updating foundational documents to include the community chosen mission statement. In addition, the Executive Committee will utilize the chosen mission statement while building the Founders DAO Constitution. \n\nDiscussion: A dedicated discussion channel was established on 11/22/22. A mission statement survey was administered starting 12/17/23. One on One interviews were conducted. Data analysis was shared with the community and opened for further discussion in all channels. \n\nSummary: Based on the Executive Committee’s research, 8 mission statements were created.  This proposal allows for the community to select the best option from the 8, in order to establish an Official Founders DAO Mission Statement.\n\nAbstract: Members will determine one official mission statement from 8 choices put forth by the Executive Committee or vote for the committee to bring forth different options. \n\nMotivation: The selection of a mission statement will make official the direction and purpose of the Founders DAO. The official Founders DAO Mission Statement should be considered in the planning of all future endeavors including a business model or any future proposals. \n\nSpecification: Members have provided information, opinions, and engaged in discussion over a 2 month period of time. Analysis of that information by the Executive Committee has resulted in 8 mission statement options ranging from large and specific to small and broad. To help inform the communities voting decisions the 1Data Analysis, 2Raw Data, 3Full Interim Strategy, and a 4Mission Statement Selection Guide have all been  linked below. \n\nA single mission statement will be selected as the “winner” (#1 choice) using ranked choice voting. A 5RCV guide has been linked below. A single mission statement will be determined the “winner” and become the Official Founders DAO Mission Statement. The winning mission statement will be official when it reaches a majority of the votes, the voting period has ended, and quorum has been reached.  Members will also have an option to vote down all 8 statements and request other options. Mission Statement Options:\n\nMission 1: To build alongside PV and create a smooth adaptable DAO that can represent our members and enable them to create thriving communities and sustainable business models.\n\nMission 2: To push the boundaries of web3 as a community of creatives, executing on opportunities along the way\n\nMission 3: Our DAO empowers community-driven investment, with a focus on discovering new opportunities while advancing the vision of Pixel Vault. We prioritize transparency, accountability, and integrity in all we do.\n\nMission 4: Empowering our web3 community, growing assets, and unlocking cutting-edge information through decentralized collaboration.\n\nMission 5: To provide our token holders a community for growth, personal wealth from the opportunities it creates, and shared wealth through better leverage of our assets.\n\nMission 6: Make a lot of money having fun along the way.\n\nMission 7: To carry our bags to Valhalla.\n\nMission 8: To build on what we’ve got.\n\nOption 9: NO WINNER; new statements needed. \n\n\nExecution: \nProposal Submitted by Executive Committee\nThe Executive Committee makes an announcement and engages in public discussion. \nProposal goes live.\nRank choice voting starting with all 8 mission statements and a “no winner” option. \nOne “winner” chosen when quorum has been reached, the voting period has ended, and a single option has reached a majority. \n\nBenefits: A well chosen mission that encompasses our near and long term goals will help guide the community as we build our business plan and determine the best proposals to create and pass.\n\nDrawbacks: The mission statement chosen by the community will help guide our current and future endeavors. Future business plans, and all future proposals, will need to be aligned to the chosen mission in order to have the best possible chance at success. Selecting one that is not accurate to our goals or is too broad or narrow, may have lasting negative impacts.   \n\nOutcomes: This proposal will be successful when voting is closed, quorum has been reached, and a single voting option has reached a majority of the votes.  If the winning option is one of the 8 mission statements, that statement will become the Official Founders DAO Mission Statement. \n\nLinks:\nData Analysis: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sNYlxE0i0MK6JmZcaTrQw75fWO83bntZ/view\nMission Research, Raw Data:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1luht0ADdHOHOkMdtu5QIhlH6RnS2Irx6/view \nFull Interim Strategy: https://drive.google.com/file/d/116FZHVKgpxj8TRuh2gt8j3hG0a04eAHg/view\nMission Statement Selection Guide: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R-S1pmMc-KnoWQq0kIUQEo21Qy_MFYDc/view\nHow Ranked-Choice Voting works: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UqszbY7dQEjZkITFY9uGQmSf_nQR8-FB/view\n\n\n",

      "title": "Moon DAO Token Acquisition",
      "content": "Title: Moon DAO Token(s) Acquisition\n\nAuthor(s): Rolldawg\n\nType: Financial\n\nImplementer: Multi-sig Team, bennydlowkey#1164, daniel g#8576, zeekay#9999\n\nCreated Date: Feb 14, 2023\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe Founder’s DAO has a significant number of Planet DAO tokens, but zero Moon DAO tokens. This proposal will allow the Multi-sig members of the Founder’s DAO to engage with the multi-sig FoundersDAO wallet (Wallet: 0x580A96BC816C2324Bdff5eb2a7E159AE7ee63022) to transfer ETH, as determined in this proposal, to a trading wallet managed by daniel g#8576, bennydlowkey#1164, and zeekay#9999 (Trading Team) to acquire Moon DAO Tokens.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWhat: Founders DAO will acquire Moon DAO Token(s) as specified in this proposal. The lowest planet total the FD holds is Pluto at 48, so the maximum number of sets the FD could complete with its current holding is 48 planet sets. The Founders DAO currently has approximately 127 ETH.\n\nWhy: The Founder’s DAO does not own any Moon DAO tokens. Acquiring tokens via this proposal will allow the FD to have significant voting power within the UPDAO for all proposals, securing significant influence in the matters of the UPDAO. There may be future benefits and utility for planet sets and this allows the FD to secure planet sets. Passive drip of $POW to the FD during the Auto-Brawler Inhabitants game (details undisclosed atm from Pixel Vault).\n\nHow: ETH will be transferred to a Trading Wallet controlled by the Trading Team in maximum increments of 10 ETH. The Trading Team will attempt to use trading methods to keep the average costs of the Moon DAO as low as reasonably achievable but by no means higher than the approved average amount in this proposal.\n\nWho: Multi-sig team will be responsible for executing any transactions leaving the FoundersDAO wallet. The Trading Team will be responsible for managing the trading wallet to acquire Moon DAO tokens and manage ETH.\n\nTrading Team members will be compensated with 3 MP2 each from the FoundersDAO.eth wallet.\n\nWhere: Trading ETH for Moon DAO tokens will take place in the trading wallet. All Moon DAO token and unused ETH will be transferred from the Trading Wallet to the FoundersDAO wallet at the conclusion of this proposal.\n\nWhen: Immediately following the approval of this proposal ETH will be transferred from the FoundersDAO wallet to the trading wallet. This proposal will remain in effect until the appropriate amount of Moon DAO tokens are acquired or a duration of 3 months from when this proposal was passed. The MP2s will be awarded at the conclusion of the implementation of this proposal.\n\nPOSITIVES\n\nAcquire voting power for all UPDAO proposals. \nIncrease influence in the UPDAO. \n$POW drip from the Auto-Brawler game.\nReap any planet set benefits.\n\nRISKS\n\nPrices may fluctuate outside of the trading team’s control resulting in a potential loss of value over time. Moon DAO token listings are the smallest of all planets and as such price fluctuations could be significant. Acquiring multiple Moon DAO tokens on marketplaces could price the trading team out of their approved price range. No guaranteed ROI.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nAllocate and Transfer ETH in maximum increments of 10 ETH for Moon DAO acquisition and gas to the Trading Team in the Trading Wallet.\nThe current balance of the FoundersDAO wallet is 127 ETH. The maximum number of planet sets that the FoundersDAO can create with current assets is 48.\n\nChoice #1 will allocate 16 ETH to acquire 10 Moon DAO tokens at an average price of no more than 1.5 ETH. 1 ETH is allocated for gas.\nChoice #2 will allocate 36 ETH to acquire 20 Moon DAO tokens at an average price of no more than 1.75 ETH. 1 ETH is allocated for gas.\nChoice #3 will allocate 61 ETH to acquire 30 Moon DAO tokens at an average price of no more than 2 ETH. 1 ETH is allocated for gas.\nChoice #4 will allocate 98 ETH to acquire 48 Moon DAO tokens at an average price of no more than 2 ETH. 2 ETH is allocated for gas.\nChoice #5 Costs nothing, and nothing will happen.\nChoice #6 Abstain to vote, but you will be included in the quorum.",

      "content": "Author: Radrob (@Radrob#4248 on Discord)\nType: Governance\nImplementor: Pixel Vault, Inc.\nCreated Date: January 26, 2023\n\nSummary\nThis proposal suggests to change the current Snapshot space voting system settings from Ranked choice voting to Any.\n\nAbstract\nThe current voting system used in the PVFD Snapshot space is set to “Ranked choice voting”. This type of voting system is not always necessary as sometimes a simple choice vote would be preferred. By letting the author of any proposal choice the voting system, it gives the DAO members more flexibility in how we move proposals forward.\n\nMotivation\nTo encourage higher voting participation and flexibility.\n\nSpecification\nIn the Voting section on the FD Snapshot settings page (Snapshot), the Snapshot space admin(s) will change the Type from “Ranked choice voting” to “Any”.\n\nBenefits\nAuthor choice on voting system will allow for more flexibility and simplicity for proposals.\n\nDrawbacks\nThe author may choose a voting system that doesn’t make sense for the type of proposal itself. There will also be less standards around proposals. Forcing ranked choice can also make runoffs easier by default.\n\nOutcomes\nWe will know the proposal is successful when the author of a new proposal can choose their voting system themselves.\n",

      "title": "Sewer Pass Sell Proposal",
      "content": "Sewer Pass Sell Proposal\nAuthor: 2ToN\nType: Sale of assets\nDate: 1/22/2023\n\nSummary\n\nProposal to dump all eligible Sewer Passes for FD liquidity. As it stands, the FD is eligible to claim two Tier 1 and two Tier 3 Sewer passes. There will also be a fail safe provision in case the full dump proposal choice does not get enough votes so we can at least have a backup plan. It would make sure that the passes themselves won't expire without being played on in order to lock in a score (the only way to actualize value on them) and losing the chance to continue with the mint experience.\n\nBenefits to the DAO\n\nThe Founder's DAO does not have the mechanisms set in place to be a swift trading entity, so selling passes that would otherwise need to be played in order to progress in the Yuga mint experience would be in our best interests rather than holding what would essentially become worthless once the window closes in February. Not only would this increase FD's liquidity to do further business endeavors, there is a real deadline to sell the passes before they become worth zero due to mint mechanics. This also avoids any overly complicated framework needed to actually play on the passes (who? where? why? when? cost? time?).\n\nAgreement Overview\n\nThe Founder's DAO shall allow the executive committee to make decisions on the timing of the sale(s) within the timeframe as given here:\n- Executive committee shall decide among themselves on who best to facilitate the sale(s) of eligible Sewer passes, using previous members of trading committees in past sales such as those who helped faciliate the BAYC sales.\n- Chosen members of the trading committee shall have up until 12:00am EST February 8th to sell the Sewer Pass assets upon passing of this proposal. \n- Trading committee shall set up a hot wallet to faciliate the sale(s) if needed should the Multi-sig function proves too difficult of an undertaking\n- After completion of sale(s), all funds from the hot wallet, if used, will be sent back to the FD treasury \n\nCOSTS & FEES\n\nThe Founder's DAO shall only incur fees related to gas charges in the process of transferring assets if necessary. All other costs and fees shall be the responsibility of the trading committee.\n\nFAIL SAFE\n\nIf the Full Sell proposal choice does not garner enough votes to pass but the fail safe option gets enough votes to pass, then the following guidelines will come into effect:\n\n- The FD shall give the executive committee permission to seek out a way or ways to participate on the passes before February 8th as to ensure a score that would allow for further progression.\n- This shall not incur any fees upon the Founder's DAO or take any funds out of it beyond paying for gas charges if needed.\n- Any potential decision(s) made by the executive committee shall follow the same principles laid out in the agreement above regarding multi sig and hot wallet usage. \n- Any passes taken out from the FD during this time will be immediately returned to the FD after the playing window has ended on February 8th, if not already returned beforehand.",

      "content": "Title: Evolving DOT #1\nAuthor: Rolldawg\nType: Action\nImplementer: Multi-sig team\nCreated Date: January 9, 2023\n\nSUMMARY\nThis proposal seeks to permit the members of the Pixel Vault Founder’s DAO multi-sig team to engage with the FoundersDAO wallet (Wallet: 0x580A96BC816C2324Bdff5eb2a7E159AE7ee63022) to evolve DOT #1 to the maximum level.\n\nABSTRACT\nWhat: The Pixel Vault Founders DAO having been awarded the first-ever DOT, ID #1, will lead the community and evolve DOT #1 through every EVO tier, as outlined in this proposal. \n\nWhy: The Founders DAO is the leader of the Pixel Vault ecosystem in actions, ideas, assets, and community. As such DOT #1 should be one of the lynchpin assets in the Founders DAO and through evolving it to EVO6 and 7 DOT #1 will achieve this status.\n\nWho: Multi-sig team will execute all transactions within the Founders DAO wallet. Rolldawg will serve as oversight to the multi-sig team to ensure the evolution of DOT #1 will occur prior to anomaly events, to the best of the multi-sig's ability.\n\nHow: DOT #1 is currently at EVO1. To achieve EVO6, 31 additional MP2 must be used to complete the proper evolutions. Once this proposal is passed DOT #1  31 MP2s will be earmarked for the evolution transactions. If the evolution to EVO7 requires nothing more than gas, the multi-sig team will also execute that evolution step. However, if the requirements for EVO7 are more than gas a separate proposal will be required.\n\nPOSITIVES\nDOT #1 will be at the maximum level in the Pixel Vault Founders DAO vault. This allows the possibility of DOT #1 being used in future Pixel Vault games. Potential passive or active earning in future Pixel Vault games. The intangible benefit of having evolution party spaces, discord events, twitch streams, or other community-coordinated events in association with the evolution of DOT #1.\n\nRISKS\nNone determined at the time of this proposal.",

      "content": "Title: The Path of Evolution with DOT #1\nCo-Authors: Rolldawg, bennydlowkey\nType: Action\nImplementer: Multi-sig team, Rolldawg\nCreated Date: January 2, 2023\n\nSUMMARY\nThis proposal seeks to permit the members of the Pixel Vault Founder’s DAO multi-sig team to engage with the FoundersDAO wallet (Wallet: 0x580A96BC816C2324Bdff5eb2a7E159AE7ee63022) to evolve DOT #1 to the maximum level.\n\nABSTRACT\nWhat: The Pixel Vault Founders DAO having been awarded the first-ever DOT, ID #1, will lead the community and evolve DOT #1 through every EVO tier, so long as the Founder DAO possesses the means available to do so. The DOT Evolution process is dynamic and time-gated so several provisions are included to ensure the evolution process can be accomplished.\nWhy: The Founders DAO is the leader of the Pixel Vault ecosystem in actions, ideas, assets, and community. As such DOT #1 should be one of the lynchpin assets in the Founders DAO and through evolving to EVO6 and 7 it will achieve this status.\nWho: Multi-sig team will be utilized for transactions out of the Founders DAO wallet. Rolldawg will execute evolutions and transfer DOT #1 back to the FoundersDAO wallet.\nHow: DOT #1 is currently at EVO1. To achieve EVO6, 31 additional MP2 must be used to complete the proper evolutions. Once this proposal is passed DOT #1, 31 MP2s and 175 $APE (approximately 0.5 ETH to be used for gas) will be allocated to Rolldawg. Rolldawg will use a “fresh” hardware wallet for the evolution of DOT #1. Rolldawg will evolve DOT #1 during each evolution phase prior to Anomaly Events. Once DOT #1 is EVO6 Rolldawg will transfer DOT #1 back to the FoundersDAO wallet. Specifics on the transfer of assets are listed below.\n\nPOSITIVES\nDOT #1 will be at maximum level in the Pixel Vault Founders DAO vault. This allows the possibility of DOT #1 being used in future Pixel Vault games. Potential passive or active earning in future Pixel Vault games. The intangible benefit of having evolution party spaces, discord events, twitch streams, or other community-coordinated events in association with the evolution of DOT #1.\n\nRISKS\nTrust in Rolldawg with FD assets leads to inherent risk that cannot be mitigated in a web3 environment. However, Rolldawg has been shown to be a trusted member of the Founders DAO. Rolldawg will also share the private keys to the wallet used to evolve DOT#1 with Potamus for contingency sake. $APE will be swapped for ETH to pay for gas during the transfer and evolution of assets. There is no guaranteed return on investment of burning MP2s for the evolution of DOT #1.\n\nOVERALL\n\nExecution steps for voting option 1:\n1) Once this proposal passes DOT #1 and 31 MP2 will be transferred to Rolldawg. Rolldawg will continuously evolve DOT #1 to the highest EVO tier prior to any Anomaly Events. Once evolved to EVO6 Rolldawg will transfer DOT #1 back to the FoundersDAO wallet. \n\nExecution steps for voting option 2:\n1) Once this proposal passes DOT #1 and 1 MP2 will be transferred to Rolldawg to allow Rolldawg to evolve DOT #1 to EVO2 immediately. Once evolved to EVO2 Rolldawg will transfer DOT #1 back to the FoundersDAO wallet. \n2) Once the EVO3 evolution window opens DOT #1 and 2 MP2 will be transferred to Rolldawg to allow Rolldawg to evolve DOT #1 to EVO3. Once evolved to EVO3 Rolldawg will transfer DOT #1 back to the FoundersDAO wallet.. \n3) Once the EVO4 evolution window opens DOT #1 and 4 MP2 will be transferred to Rolldawg to allow Rolldawg to evolve DOT #1 to EVO4. Once evolved to EVO4 Rolldawg will transfer DOT #1 back to the FoundersDAO wallet.\n4) Once the EVO5 evolution window opens DOT #1 and 8 MP2 will be transferred to Rolldawg to allow Rolldawg to evolve DOT #1 to EVO5. Once evolved to EVO5 Rolldawg will transfer DOT #1 back to the FoundersDAO wallet.\n5) Once the EVO6 evolution window opens DOT #1 and 16 MP2 will be transferred to Rolldawg to allow Rolldawg to evolve DOT #1 to EVO6. Once evolved to EVO6 Rolldawg will transfer DOT #1 back to the FoundersDAO wallet.\n\nVoting option 3: DOT #1 will not be evolved by this proposal. Nothing happens.\n\nVoting option 4: Abstain.\n",

      "title": "Grant the greater Pixel Vault community read-only access to the PVFD for 30 days",
      "content": "Abstract:\n\nThe Founder’s DAO is the heart of the Pixel Vault community and the most vibrant online space where Pixel Vault-related discussions occur. Vibrant online communities are essential for growth, education and engagement and I believe that keeping the Founder’s DAO community invisible behind a token-gated discord may be detracting from the greater Pixel Vault ecosystem. This also materially detracts from the Founder’s DAO, given that the DAO holds primarily Pixel Vault assets and has a primary interest in advancing, promoting and building alongside the larger PV ecosystem.\n\nI (Zentensivist) propose a 30-day period where the Founder’s DAO channel would be open, with read-only access to all members of the Pixel Vault discord. Members of the discord could view the Founder’s DAO main channel chat, but could only post if they held a Founder’s DAO token.\n\nOverview:\n\nDespite the excellent work and continual presence of the moderator team, the general Pixel Vault and UPDAO chats see a very low volume of chat activity, and few daily active users outside the moderator team and Founder’s DAO members.\n\nIn contrast, the Founder’s DAO main channel is lively 24 hours a day with news, speculation and discussion largely related to Punks Comic, Inhabitants Universe and other Pixel Vault related discussion, in addition to discussion about the larger crypto and web3 space.\n\nWhile access to the Founder’s DAO discord channel is a key benefit to holding a Founder’s DAO token, I believe that it is possible that hiding all DAO discussion behind a token-gated channel actually detracts from the DAO’s progress toward its goals of promoting and generating excitement about the Pixel Vault ecosystem, given that vast majority of all value in the DAO wallet is held in Pixel Vault assets–and this is set to increase further with the proposal to sell BAYC assets and purchase more inhabitants.\n\nAs an experiment to see if this might be case, I propose a 30-day trial of opening up the Founder’s DAO main discord channel to allow for read-only access to any member of the Pixel Vault discord.\n\nI believe this would potentially be a net positive for the Founder’s DAO for several reasons:\n\n-It would allow the larger community, both within Pixel Vault and the NFT community at large to see how active the Founder’s DAO discord remains even in a bear market\n\n-It would allow people to view and experience discussions that happen in the Founder’s DAO around the strategic decision making and game theory that is the hallmark of the Pixel Vault ecosystem.\n\n-While engaging, the complexity of the ecosystem can be daunting and allowing people to view the ongoing discussion within the Founder’s DAO could spur interest and help onboard new members. As a result it may generate both more interest in the Founder’s DAO, and in the larger Pixel Vault ecosystem, both of which would ultimately benefit the DAO. It may spur more activity within the Pixel Vault general chat\n\nPotential downsides include:\n\n-Part of the value of the Founder’s DAO token lies in access to the exclusive discord channel. Making this access less exclusive could detract from this specific aspect\n\n-The Founder’s DAO channel can be a site of criticism and open discussion, some of which the community and Pixel Vault may prefer to not be entirely open to the public. Having the channel open with read-only access could cause members to be less open within the channel.\n\nI believe that a trial period would be an effective way to mitigate any downside risks. If we find that the potential benefits fail to materialize, or if the downsides outweigh the upside, the read-only period will expire and the DAO can choose to allow the Founder’s DAO to remain closed. If this experiment is seen as a positive, the Founder’s DAO could choose to extend it or make it permanent, but this would require an active choice. I see little possible permanent downside risk to a trial period of this length.",

      "content": "Title: New Multi-Sig Signers, Proposal to Update “Founder’s DAO Improvement Proposal - Gnosis Safe Signers (Update 1)\n\nPreamble: \nAuthors: @bennydlowkey, @averagejocrypto\n\nCreation Date: December 18th 2022\n\nSummary: \n\nThis proposal seeks to update the “The Founder’s DAO Improvement Proposal - Gnosis Safe Signers” which was approved on March 14, 2022.  (https://forum.foundersdao.app/t/founder-s-dao-improvement-proposal-gnosis-safe-signers/15)  The original proposal expanded the Gnosis Safe “signers” from 3 to 7 and elected specific members to 1 year terms with specified ending dates.  The members listed below have either 1. Become inactive in PVFD 2. Have expressed interest in being removed as a signer or 3. Their term has expired according to the original proposal. This new proposal (update 1) replaces the 5 outgoing signers with 5 new signers, and begins new 1 year terms for each. All other parts of the original proposal remain in place. \n\nCurrent signers that will be removed from the Gnosis Safe Signers group with the passing of this proposal:  \nChuba\n Jacob\n Spacewalk\n Andy\nRusty\n\nActive members that have applied to  be added to the Gnosis Safe Signers group with the passing of this proposal (The 5 With the most votes will be added to the multi signature team):   \n\nDaniel G (Term end - December 18, 2023)\nDimitrovi#2122  (Term end - December 18, 2023)\nAERON#5472  (Term end - December 18, 2023)\nPerpetual_cgi I Dot the Builder#2736  (Term end - December 18, 2023)\nGilotine#5466  (Term end - December 18, 2023)\nigi#1343  (Term end - December 18, 2023)\nRollDawg#9095  (Term end - December 18, 2023)\nabsolutely.eth#6209  (Term end - December 18, 2023)\nJAWS#6839  (Term end - December 18, 2023)\nswazzleneuf#5100 (Term end - December 18, 2023)\nDarkSideOfTheMoonDao#5296 (Term end - December 18, 2023)\n\nEach of the 11 members presented have easily met the minimum requirements (3) as outlined in the original proposal. These Members will be Valid Multi Sig Signers for a 1 year term, after which they will each be paid .3ETH as per the original proposal. \n\nIn addition, this proposal approves the payment of .3eth to the outgoing signers listed above. These payments will be made when 1. The Founders DAO can secure the appropriate liquidity and 2. The Founders DAO along with the “Foundation” can ensure all laws and regulations have been followed. \n\nTo Vote, Select in order the candidates you feel will represent the DAO well and accomplish the goals of the Multi Signature Team. \n\n\nEach Candidates Response to the question “What makes you a good candidate?” Can be found below \n\ndaniel g: spend a lot of time in pv discord, know the ins and outs of ecosystem pretty well, have kept strong reputation among community, am usually available to sign and am part of the trading committee so being a signer would be convenient and efficient\n\ndimitrovi#2122 : I am online all the time and have a big PV bag\n\nAΞRON#5472 : My wife would say that I'm addicted to my phone. I would say that I'm always available. Other than that I'm in discord daily and can usually get to my laptop in a few minutes.\n\nperpetual_cgi | Dot the Builder#2736 : I am almost a fulltime-degen and when I am not degening I am working from home so I am usually around my trezor. I am a pvfd member since day 1 (in fact one of the first messages in PVFD channel) and I am in PV discord since before the PC1 drop. I know how to use gnosis multisig and I know my way around most web3 things.\n\n\nGilotine #5466 : I have held a DAO token for over a year and currently own 3 in total along with numerous other PV assets, and am a highly engaged member of the group. I regularly contribute in the FD channel (and gen pop too) as well as on proposals and the business chat and have a good track record of voting also. I am reliable, will ensure I always have my ledger close by if successful and own my own business which I would like to think makes me more responsible too. Overall I feel I would be an excellent candidate for the multisig.\n\nigi#1343 : Almost online 24/7\n\nRollDawg#9095 : Activity and Availability\n\nabsolutely.eth#6209 : As a dedicated member of the PVFD community, I am honored to be considered to serve as a signer on the multi-sig. As a comic minter and day 1 burner, I have been an active participant in the Founders DAO and have always been committed to the success of the community. I am more of a lurker/emoji reactor than a commentooor, so I may be less visible than some applicants, but I bleed for PVFD and want nothing more than to see us all succeed, both in the short term as well as the very long term. I believe I have demonstrated my commitment to the community through my actions, including donating ETH (and even a PVFD token) to fellow members when they are in need. I believe that participation is crucial to the success of a DAO, and I am a diligent voter on PVFD proposals. I work from home and have access to my computer at all times, so signing approvals quickly is not a problem. Being a signer on the multi-sig would be an honor and a commitment I would take incredibly seriously. I am already doxxed, which I believe is of utmost importance for this responsibility. This is not a vanity position. It is an essential piece of DAO infrastructure and it would be my pleasure to faithfully execute the DAO's business on behalf of all members. Thank you for your consideration.\n\n\n\n@JAWS#6839 : I have no issue doxing myself to the dao committee/PV or even just in general if that's what it takes to make everyone comfortable. I vote on every proposal, am in the discord every day, and have no plans to sell my PV assets for years to come. I seek no compensation and am willing to do my part to help the DAO progress forward.\n\n\nswazzleneuf#5100 : Intense and constant interest and participation since mint. I also have a different business background (hotel, banking, tax collection, movie studio, etc) than most members. I really just want the project to succeed and will give my best efforts to making that happen.\n\nDarkSideOfTheMoonDao#5296 : TIMSecondRodeo is my other account, I want to be an integral part of the Pixel Vault journey and direct my passion towards something buildable!\n\n\n\n\nOLD PROPOSAL for reference \n\nAuthor: Jacob Wittman (@jakewittman)\nCo-Authors: @RustySailor_\nType: Governance\nImplementor: Pixel Vault, Inc.; Founder’s DAO Community Members\nCreated Date: March 7, 2022\nSummary\nThe Founder’s DAO assets are currently held in the following wallet address: 0x580a96bc816c2324bdff5eb2a7e159ae7ee63022 (the “Founder’s DAO Wallet”). While the snapshot.page vote serves as a mechanism for the Founder’s DAO to exercise their voice, no action will be taken until the keyholder to the Founder’s DAO Wallet acts. Currently, the Founder’s DAO wallet is managed via a Gnosis Safe, which has three keyholders. At least two signatories must sign for any action in the Founder’s DAO Wallet to be completed on-chain.\nThe current Gnosis Safe keyholders are Sean Gearin, the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Pixel Vault, Inc. (“Pixel Vault”), Chuba, Lead Solidity Developer at Pixel Vault and Andy8052, Founder of Fractional.art. This proposal seeks to expand the number of signatories from three (3) to seven (7) and appoint four (4) new signers to serve as the additional signatories.\nNewly Elected Signatories\nWe’ve spent a lot of time thinking about who should serve these roles, and what the requirements (if any) should be. We landed on three minimums that each keyholder should have:\nOwn at least one PVFD Token\nBe an active member of the Founder’s DAO Discord\nHave a proposal ready to submit to the Founder’s DAO for debate\nNumber 3 above might seem a bit unnatural as a “requirement,” but something that we are inspired to see in the Founder’s DAO is a level of civil discourse and debate that not many other DAOs reach. As an already engaged community on Discord, the opportunity for continued growth is limitless; however, to sustain that growth each level of the DAO (from community to keyholders) should be engaged in finding new ways to innovate and operate.\nAfter discussing with various members of the Founder’s DAO community (s/o to Rusty, Potamus and others for the help here), we landed on the following individuals to discuss this opportunity with:\nRichard [MetaHero No. 5], member of the Founder’s DAO\nRustySailor, members of the Founder’s DAO\nSpaceWalk.eth, member of the Founder’s DAO\nJacob Wittman, member of the Founder’s DAO; General Counsel, Pixel Vault\nEach of the individuals above has expressed an immense amount of support for the Founder’s DAO and is thrilled to be proposed signers on the Founder’s DAO multisig.\nStaggered Voting; Fees\nThe current process of using a Gnosis Safe and requiring an m-of-n vote will likely transition to a full on-chain vote and the Gnosis Safe will no longer be needed. However, to ensure fair mechanics and protect against a backdrop where the transition to on-chain is delayed, we propose that the keyholders serve one (1) year terms. These terms will be staggered, with one keyholder rotating out every 3 months. The first rotation will be scheduled six (6) months from the passing of this proposal, which will result in certain individuals serving longer than 1 year, but allows for the staggered process to be implemented.\nThis FDIP proposes the following rotation for the keyholders:\nChuba to serve until September 7, 2022, at which point in time the Founder’s DAO will vote a new keyholder in his place.\nJacob Wittman - December 1, 2022\nSean Gearin - March 1, 2023\nAndy8052 - June 1, 2023\nRustySailor - September 1, 2023\nSpaceWalk.eth - December 1, 2023\nRichard [MetaHero No. 5] - March 1, 2024\nFurthermore, we propose that each keyholder shall be eligible to receive 0.3 ETH from the Founder’s DAO to help cover time and costs associated with the management of the Gnosis Safe. This distribution will come later after the Founder’s DAO has considered various liquidity opportunities.\n[End of proposal]\n",

      "title": "DOT Madness Bracket Challenge",
      "content": "Title: DOT Madness Bracket Challenge\n\nAuthor(s): Rolldawg\n\nType: Community Event(s), Action\n\nImplementer: Multi-sig Team, Communications Committee, Potamus, JuicyJama, RollDawg\n\nCreated Date: December 25, 2022\n\nDiscussion: https://forum.foundersdao.app/t/dot-madness-bracket-challenge/259\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThis proposal seeks to permit the Multi-sig members of the Founder’s DAO to engage with the multi-sig FoundersDAO wallet (Wallet: 0x580A96BC816C2324Bdff5eb2a7E159AE7ee63022) to transfer MP2s, as determined in this proposal, ETH, and APE to a \"fresh\" wallet managed by Potamus to evolve DOTs based upon PVFD bracket-style voting.\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWhat: The Pixel Vault Founders DAO will use a bracket-style challenge to engage the Pixel Vault community with a regular entertaining event centered around DOTs. The multi-sig team, the FoundersDAO wallet, the Founders DAO communications committee, Potamus, Juicy Jama, and Rolldawg will be responsible for the actions in this proposal.\n\nWhy: The initial release of DOTs has created a strong sense of community and engagement around the mechanics and activity of the DOT minting/evolving process. The FD should capitalize on and enhance this momentum with a fun activity that leverages assets we have on hand.\n\nHow (reference - Flow-chart at the end of the proposal):\n1) Upon approval the multi-sig wallet will transfer ETH and APE coin for transactions (0.5 $ETH and 2,000 $APE) & the appropriate amount of MP2 to Potamus:\n1 Bracket = 32 MP2\n2 Brackets = 64 MP2\n3 Brackets = 96 MP2\n\n2) Potamus will use a DeFi exchange to exchange 2,000 APE to ETH.\n(Currently, the FoundersDAO wallet holds 26,344 APE. Utilizing 2,000 APE equates to roughly 13% of the total APE in the wallet. This will yield roughly 5.9 ETH, at current prices on 22 Dec 22, to be used for transactions listed in this proposal. All unused ETH will be returned to the FoundersDAO wallet at the conclusion of the actions in this proposal)\n\n3) Potamus will evolve all allocated MP2 to EVO2.\n\n4) JuicyJama will create graphic(s) for the bracket(s) for the community to visualize the matchups.\n\n5) After every Anomaly Event, PVFD communications committee will run the bracket voting. Brackets will be created in “snake” order, with traditional seeds. For example, 1st EVO2 minted will be #1 seed, the last EVO2 minted will be #16 seed. #1 vs #16, #2 vs #15, #3 vs #14, etc. The voting duration will conclude no later than 24 hours from the opening of the next evolution window. This includes cutting voting short to evolve and participate in the anomaly event.\n\n6) When the next EVO window opens and when voting has concluded the Communications Committee will provide Potamus a list of the winning DOTs* and Potamus will upgrade the list of winners. JuicyJama will update the graphics to represent the updated bracket(s).\n\n7) Repeat steps 4 through 6 until the DOT(s) are EVO6.\n\n8) Potamus will transfer the DOT(s) and any unused ETH back to the FoudersDAO wallet.\n\n9) MP2 compensation will be distributed to Potamus & JuicyJama.\n\n*If a “Tampering” option is agreed upon the PVFD Communications Committee will be responsible for running an additional vote for Redemption to determine DOTs that will be saved from burning. Eligible DOTs to be voted on for redemption are 3+ matching traits, 4T/8T, and anomalies only.\nRedemption Votes will occur quickly and conclude no later than 123 hours after the following evolution phase opens, to allow for proper replacement and evolution for the winners. A vote of yes/no will be accomplished for redemption and a simple majority will determine whether a losing DOT is redeemed. If a vote deems that the eligible DOTs are to be redeemed they will be transferred back to the FoundersDAO wallet, and the multi-sig team will replace them with an equivalent number of MP2.\n\nWho: Multi-sig team will be responsible for executing any transactions leaving the FoundersDAO wallet. Potamus will execute DeFi exchanges, MP2 to DOT mints, DOT evolutions, and transactions. PVFD will vote on the brackets and/or redemptions. JuicyJama will create graphics for the brackets and update them based on the minting/burning voted on by the Founders DAO. PVFD Communications committee will proctor the voting and promotion of the event and inform Potamus and JuicyJama of the results of community voting. Rolldawg will provide oversight to all aspects of the DOT Madness Bracket Challenge.\n\nPotamus will be compensated with 4 MP2, JuicyJama will be compensated with 4 MP2.\n\nWhere: Transactions will take place in Potamus’s wallet until the conclusion of the Bracket(s), at which time all assets will be transferred back to the FoundersDAO wallet.\nVoting on the brackets will take place via discord with an announced deadline.\nBracket graphics will be created by JuicyJama and shared on Discord and Twitter.\n\nPOSITIVES\n\nCapitalize on the hype and momentum of the DOTs mint. This gives a regular event for the PVFD to directly participate in and for the Pixel Vault community as a whole to indirectly participate in bracket winner reveals, evolution reveals, and potential anomaly reveals.\n\nRISKS\n\nTrust in Potamus with FD assets leads to inherent risk that cannot be completely mitigated in a web3 environment. Potamus is however a trusted member of the PV community and an employee of PV. Gas will be spent on the transfer and evolution of assets. There is no guaranteed return on investment of burning MP2s for the evolution of DOTs including gas required to execute these transactions, however EVO6(s) will be returned to the Founders DAO wallet that will represent an equal number of fragments used during the evolution process of the DOT Madness Bracket Challenge. By the nature of the bracket mechanism and for ease of execution, “desirable” DOTs have the potential to be burned based on the voting of the community. Compensation in the form of MP2 will be spent and will not have a tangible return to the Founders DAO.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nAllocate and Transfer 32/64/96 MP2 to execute a bracket challenge that the PVFD will vote on for each evolution phase. The evolutions will take place prior to anomaly events to maximize exposure to anomalies. The PVFD Communications Committee will run voting. Potamus will execute transactions. JuicyJama will execute bracket graphics. Rolldawg will provide oversight to the process and ensure deadlines are adhered to and executed smoothly.\n\nChoice #1 costs 40 MP2 (32 to burn/evolve & 8 for compensation) and 0.5 ETH & 2,000 APE for gas. Will yield 1 EVO6 DOT for the Founders DAO.\nChoice #2 costs 40 MP2 (32 to burn/evolve & 8 for compensation) and 0.5 ETH & 2,000 APE for gas. Will yield 1 EVO6 DOT for the Founders DAO and the possibility of redeemed DOTs. See above for specifications of redeeming DOTs.\nChoice #3 costs 72 MP2 (64 to burn/evolve & 8 for compensation) and 0.5 ETH & 2,000 APE for gas. Will yield 2 EVO6 DOT for the Founders DAO.\nChoice #4 costs 72 MP2 (64 to burn/evolve & 8 for compensation) and 0.5 ETH & 2,000 APE for gas. Will yield 2 EVO6 DOT for the Founders DAO and the possibility of redeemed DOTs. See above for specifications of redeeming DOTs.\nChoice #5 costs 104 MP2 (96 to burn/evolve & 8 for compensation) and 0.5 ETH & 2,000 APE for gas. Will yield 3 EVO6 DOT for the Founders DAO and the possibility of redeemed DOTs. See above for specifications of redeeming DOTs. 2 brackets will be permitted to be tampered with & 1 bracket will be designated the “EVO6 or Frags!” Bracket and no tampering will be permitted.\nChoice #6 Costs nothing, and nothing will happen.\nChoice #7 Abstain to vote, but you will be included in the quorum.\n\n \n![Flowchart_snip.jpg](ipfs://bafkreic73ujf4z5ibi5ip4togvbpefsmo2ejns2fliwkp4tsxna5ii34e4)\n    ",

      "content": "Preamble: \nAuthors: bennydlowkey#1164 averagejocrypto#8842 \nImplementer: Multi Sig Team x Executive Committee\n\nCreated Date: December 6th, 2022\n\nSummary:\nThis proposal updates the “Motion to Sell Yuga Assets to Accumulate Currency Reserves and Inhabitants” proposal by adding clarifying language to three specific parts of the proposal.\n\nUpdate 1: Selling Deadline\nCurrent Language: “These assets will remain at trait floor price until Zeekay brings a buyer, the asset sells, or the year 2022 ends”\nUpdate: Sale of Yuga assets must occur before April 1, 2023. \nPurpose: Extend the sale deadline. \n\nUpdate 2: Sale Mechanics\nCurrent Language: “The member nominated to facilitate the BAYC trade is Zeekay (Zeekay#9999). He will be finding buyers in the BAYC Discord for possible OTC deals on nfttrader.io.” \nUpdate: A hot wallet will be set up by 0xRichard#9127 which will be used to sell the Yuga assets without the need for the multi sig team. \nDetails of Mechanics: \nHot wallet set up by 0xRichard#9127\nMulti sig team transfers Yuga assets to hot wallet\n0xRichard#9127 and IH purchasing committee (bennydlowkey#1164 & danielg#8576) and Zeekay#9999 will list and sell the Yuga assets or agree to trade the Yuga assets for IH’s. This team retains the ability to make subjective decisions in order to best execute the proposal. \nOnce sale or trade is completed, eth or assets gained in trade are sent directly to FD wallet.\nPurpose:  Selling or trading the assets from a hot wallet provides the best opportunity to recoup the highest value possible without further delay caused by multi sig issues. \n\n\nUpdate 3: Purchasing Mechanics\nCurrent Language - Original proposal language does not provide details for purchasing mechanics.\nUpdate: A hot wallet will be set up by bennydlowkey#1164 which will be used by the IH purchasing committee (bennydlowkey#1164 & danielg#8576) to more easily make strategic purchases of IH’s without the need to use the multi-sig process for each transaction.\nDetails of Mechanics:\nHot wallet set up by bennydlowkey#1164 (0x1993f7392A94f15847D9c2881A590C8a2e1d55Bb.)\nMulti-sig team transfers 8 eth to newly created hot wallet.\nPurchasing committee uses funds to make IH purchases.\nIH’s will be transferred to the FD wallet immediately after purchase to ensure the lowest value in the hot wallet possible.\nWhen the hot wallet value falls below 3 eth, the multi-sig team will be notified by the purchasing committee and will send another 8 eth to the hot wallet.  \nProcess repeats until the specified amount of IH’s have been purchased. \nWhen complete, the remaining hot wallet funds will be sent back to the FD wallet. \nPurpose: Purchasing IH’s from a hot wallet provides the best opportunity to get the best value by eliminating the use of a multi sig for each purchase or trade. \n\n\nVoting Options:\n\nOption 1: Yes vote on all updates (1 - 3)\nOption 2: Deny the Motion and do Nothing \n\n",

      "content": "![infinigods.jpg](ipfs://bafkreicya2amah3hnfserbjc7m4jwib2njnyb43siyxt6ka5inwj4bqfyu)\nSummary:\nThe Founders DAO is proposing to purchase one InfiniGods Ultimate Pass. The pass can be found at the following link: https://opensea.io/collection/infinipass.\n\nRequirements:\nIf this proposal is approved, the Founders DAO will authorize the wallet executor(s) of the Pixel Vault Founder's DAO wallet (foundersdao.eth, which corresponds to wallet 0x580a96bc816c2324bdff5eb2a7e159ae7ee63022) to sell the necessary amount of ApeCoin ($APE) from the DAO's treasury on a decentralized exchange (DEX) such as Uniswap in order to obtain the funds needed to purchase the pass.\n\nReasoning/Benefits:\nThe Founders DAO is seeking to diversify its assets in the Vault by adding assets from different ecosystems. The InfiniGods Universe holds Noxious-0 and IH was also featured in the InfiniMerge Community Event with a PV pricepool. The Ultimate Pass offers exclusive benefits such as airdropped NFTs for every InfiniGods release, enhanced gameplay boosts and power-ups, access to the Roundtable and game development team, and special NFT drops. These benefits could potentially provide longterm value to the DAO and its members.\n",

These delegates may also apply or open discussions for future opportunities involving our core.\n\nPV have confirmed that 1 member from the PVFD can apply to join the core committee on behalf of the PVFD. We propose for Brain from Uranus to apply for the core committee should this proposal be successful.\n\nVoting ‘Yes’ to this proposal acknowledges that decisions regarding Array-1 will be relayed & discussed within the PVFD discord channel (as much info as can be discussed due to potential NDA agreements), with the delegates having a 3 way informal vote on any decisions.\n\nWe have already seen a successful vote to include Array-1 in the first 16 characters of the AAA game title scheduled for early release late 2023.\n\nRepresenting Array-1 as a PVFD asset alongside other core PV identities is an important step to increase visibility of the DAO and to increase the value of the PV assets that the DAO holds.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to make sure Array-1, and by extension the PVFD, is well represented in all Core identity discussions and development pathways.\n\nWe take the position to share as much information as we can with the pvfd, in order for the DAO to be well informed on the opportunities and developments for core identities. However, there may be some information that cannot be shared widely due to agreements with Pixel Vault such as NDAs. There will be an element of trust required in the people representing Array 1, with the option that the DAO can at any time vote to replace members or even dissolve the delegation entirely if it wants to do so.\n\nIf this proposal passes, the delegates will be remunerated with 1 MP2 NFTs each per month.",

      "title": "Proposal to fill vacant spots on the Communications Committee",
      "content": "Abstract: \n\nThe communications committee currently has 2 members, out a maximum of 5 possible. We seek to add three committee members with active online presences. We recommend DAO members – Gooniebrad, Wiggles and Juicy Jama – to fill these roles. \n\nOverview and Proposed New Communications Committee Members: \n\nThe Founders DAO Communications Committee has recently lost two members, West Coast Walker who stepped down from his position, and myself who has taken a full time role with Pixel Vault Inc. The Founder’s DAO Communications Committee would like to propose adding three active community members to replace our outgoing committee members. \n\nThe Communications Committee would like to thank WestCoastWalker for his valuable service on the Communications Committee over the last several months, which included taking a lead role in the innovative Community Content Challenge. \n\nIn addition, I would like to thank all Founders DAO members for their support during my time on the Communications Committee. I still plan on being heavily involved in the PVFD as well as the Comms Committee in an advisory capacity. However, given my employment by Pixel Vault Inc, I believe it makes sense for me to step down from this paid DAO position and allow one of the many talented community members the opportunity to jump in and contribute. \n\nThe committee now seeks to add Gooniebrad (https://twitter.com/gooniebrad), Wiggles (https://twitter.com/WigglesCEO) and Juicy Jama (https://twitter.com/JuicyJama_) as members. All are active community members with a significant Twitter presence, who we believe will be effective at both promoting the DAO on a day-to-day basis as well as coming up with creative initiatives and assets moving forward. \n\nBelow are brief biographies and statements of interest. \n\nGooniebrad: \nI’ve been proud and passionate PixelVault community member since the very beginning. I was initially drawn to PixelVault by the IP which I think is the best in the space, but what really made it home for me was the people in the community that I interacted with on a daily basis and became my web3 family. My dedication in the discord server was recognised by Potamus and I was invited into the Moderator team. Data recently revealed by a PV staff member showed that I was the biggest supporter of PixelVault related content on Twitter over the last 30 day period - and honestly, I could even ramp that up from a PVFD perspective. I am really excited about the future of the PVFD and think my knowledge, passion and skills would be a benefit to the comms committee. \n\nWiggles: \nHey all, it’s your friendly neighbourhood shitposter here! As most of you know I’ve been in Pixel Vault from the very beginning. The PVFD community is the one I have vibed with most in this space, and would love to represent. My background is in healthcare, which taught me many valuable lessons, specifically about having fun and staying positive while working through different challenges. Over the past couple of years through some close personal connections I transitioned into digital marketing, SEO, communications…and now full-time Web3. I feel like I would be a valuable communications committee member as I am strong in building relationships with different stakeholders within the NFTs/Web3 space. I also have a wide array of skills and knowledge relating to the NFT space. I look forward to building with you all, alongside Pixel Vault, and forming many great and rewarding partnerships for the PVFD. Wiggles out. The current committee members believe that these two candidates are well-suited to roles on the communications committee. However, in the interest of inclusivity and transparency we also invite any other community members with interest to comment here or reach out directly to the Communications Committee members to express interest in being considered before a formal proposal is placed to a vote.\n\nJuicy Jama:\nHey fam, feelin' Juicy? As a day 1 comic minter I have been interested in Pixel Vault from the get go. I always wanted to buy a second comic to burn for PVFD which I never got round to. Was finally able to join the family this year, and it has quickly become my web3 home. My professional background is in I.T. specifically networking and cyber security. I have always been obsessed with gadgets and technology. Always trying to learn a new skill. In 2021 I started creating some NFT content which eventually lead to some PVFD members asking if I could help create Moonlings. The rest is history. I have built some incredible connection and more importantly friendships in the community and look forward to getting to know more of you. If accepted for this role, I would continue to use my art and design to help educate the Founder's DAO messaging across to the world, as well as create some fun engaging content where possible. Looking forward to the future of what this community is capable of. Stay Juicy ;)\n\nPlease see the previously passed proposal establishing the committee for a description of the committee’s purpose, compensation and other details: https://snapshot.org/#/foundersdao.eth/proposal/0xd4f916bd521c36add885a4b30c55d6ddbfc2d1319f562308aab5d7b4118d433f\n",

      "content": "\nTitle: Motion to Sell Yuga Assets to Accumulate Currency Reserves and Inhabitants \n\nPreamble: \nAuthors: @verbdan, @wiggles, @bennydlowkey, @averagejocrypto\nImplementor: Pixel Vault Founder’s DAO Community Members\n\nCreated Date: November 16, 2022\n\n\nSummary:\nThis proposal will offer 5 options to address the lack of liquidity and diversification of the Founders DAO holdings. \nOption 1 (100% eth): Sell Bored Ape #5860, Mutant Ape #21720, and list Other seeds  [#28468, #28469, #28470, #2002, #5860] (apes and other deeds sold at trait floor prices) \nOption 2 (100% eth): In ADDITION to selling assets from Option 1, BAYC #9004 and it’s associated MAYC #2808 will be sold (trait floor prices)\nOption 3 (50% eth/usd): Sell Bored Ape #5860, Mutant Ape #21720, and listing Other deeds  [#28468, #28469, #28470, #2002, #5860] (apes and other deeds sold at trait floor prices)\nOption 4 (50% eth/usd): In ADDITION to selling assets from Option 1, BAYC #9004 and it’s associated MAYC #2808 will be sold (trait floor prices)\nOption 5: Do not sell any assets\n\n**Note: for 50% eth/usd option - 50% of eth profits will immediately be changed to USCD if/when the price of eth is above $1,100 usd. \n\n\nThis proposal at current prices would provide the DAO with funds that it currently holds little of, outside of the $APE (provided by said ape(s)). These funds will be used to execute inhabitants purchases (details provided below). Remaining funds, after Inhabitant purchases, will be kept in the PVFD wallet to be used based on future proposals set forth by the community. \n\n\nAbstract:\n\nCurrently the PVFD has approximately 1.5E available (excluding $APE). Assuming the associated assets sell at the current floor price and before royalties/fees are considered:\n- upon a ‘yay’ vote for Option 1 & 3 the ‘treasury’ would hold approximately ~81E after sales.\n- upon a ‘yay’ vote for Option 2 & 4 the ‘treasury’ would hold approximately ~156E after sales.\n- upon a ‘yay’ vote for Option 5 the treasury will remain unchanged \n- additionally the ‘abstain’ option is included, as well.\n\nMotivation:\n\nThe options presented in this proposal have been discussed at length within the PVFD community, and the time to act is now. The goal of this proposal is to take advantage of the low market for Inhabitants and build a treasury, in addition to the freedom in liquidity to pay for future endeavors/proposals for the PVFD, as we collectively see fit through further proposals. \n\nSpecifications:\n\nCurrent Liquidity as of 11/23/22 2:00pm EST:\n-26,812 $APE ($90,000)\n-1.57 $WETH ($1850)\n\nEstimated net proceeds as of 11/23/22 2:00pm EST:\nOption 1/3:\nBAYC: ~64.5E\nMAYC: ~11.5E\nOtherdeed: ~1.23E x5 (Otherdeed #9004 will be saved as it contains a koda)\n\nTotal: ~81E (~$95k) pre royalties/fees\n\nOption 2/4:\nBAYC: ~130E\nMAYC: ~23E\nOtherdeed: ~6.25E\n\nTotal: ~169E (~$198k) pre royalties/fees\n\nOption 5:\nNo sales.\nTotal: 1.57E\n\n\nTo facilitate these sales, a temporary committee will be established to deal with the sale of these assets, and get fair market value, then finally return the funds to the Founders Wallet (foundersdao.eth), then dissolve said committee. Assets cannot be sold for less than the floor price of each respective collection. The committee will, to the best of their ability, attempt to extract the maximum value possible. The committee reserves the right to not sell any/all assets if they are not able to sell for appropriate value. Market movements that are dramatic and or sharp in nature, should be resolved in the DAO, dynamically and timely; instead of made on the committee members individual authority.\n\nThe Committee member or members involved with this proposal, will be compensated with 3 mp2’s each.\n\nThe member nominated to facilitate the BAYC trade is Zeekay (Zeekay#9999). He will be finding buyers in the BAYC Discord for possible OTC deals on nfttrader.io. These assets will remain at trait floor price until Zeekay brings a buyer, the asset sells, or the year 2022 ends\n\n\nBenefits:\n\nLiquidity upon a ‘yay’ vote for Option 1- 4, and successful sales. This is a big enough win for many within the PVFD community, due to future opportunities that liquidity opens up.\n\nPlan for Funds:\n\nThe temporary committee will have the additional task of purchasing between 20 and 80 IH’s that are at or near the IH Floor.  These will be immediately staked in the gaming contract once available and could be used for IP development, free game play, tournament prizes or many other things as the community sees fit in the future. \n\nPurchasing Parameters:\n\nCurrently listed Inhabitants will not be considered for purchase if the listed price increases more than 5% from current listing price (snapshot taken 11/27/22)\n\n\nPurchase details per selected option:\nOption 1: 40 - 50 Inhabitants\nOption 2: 60 - 80 Inhabitants\nOption 3: 20 - 40 inhabitants \nOption 4: 50 - 60 inhabitants \n\nThe members nominated to facilitate the Inhabitants' trades are Bennydlowkey. (Bennydlowkey#1164) and Daniel G (Daniel g#8576) They will be finding sellers in the PV Discord for possible OTC deals on nfttrader.io as well as buying and placing WETH offers on Blur and the PV Marketplace. \n\nDrawbacks:\n\nThe drawbacks revolve around asset floors that the Pixel Vault Founders DAO would rather not speculate around. While we as a collective in the PVFD love our Yuga assets, we also understand the need for liquidity in our DAO. The drawbacks have been considered, we press on with our remaining Apes/assets if this proposal passes, eager to maintain our position in that ecosystem, as we have so far.\n\nIn Conclusion: We ambitiously launch this proposal as the first of many steps that we as a collective will be making to further solidify our legacy in the web3 space and beyond. \n\nThank You!\n\n\n",

The purchase of Strobe-1 is to be fixed in the amount of `27ETH` and will require prior agreement from Founders DAO member @0xfinity, whom currently owns Strobe-1. `@0xfinity` will also be requested to list the item directly on the Pixel Vault marketplace prior to the execution of the `APE/ETH` trade.\n\n## Reasoning/Benefits: ##\n\nAs a DAO, we are lacking a diverse treasury of assets in our own Pixel Vault ecosystem. We're currently heavy on assets that are not tangential to the success of Pixel Vault. For the purpose of this sale, it's worth noting that the DAO is holding `26,811.9 $APE`, equivalent to `$116,899.88` at the time of writing this proposal. We would be selling an estimated `9,803.42` (`36.56369%`) of our `$APE` holdings to own core intellectual property. The Founders DAO currently holds a single core identity. Prior to the release of the beta game later this year, and knowing that rental mechanics will be in play, it would seem wise for us to invest in the core intellectual property of our own ecosystem and utilize it in the future lending/leasing system. Furthermore, the asset in question is from the planet Mercury, which is an integral and early part of the future gameplay mechanics of the Inhabitants Universe.",

      "title": "Election of the Executive Committee to Stand-Up DAO Business Strategy & Constitution",
      "content": "Proposal to Elect the Executive Committee to Stand-Up DAO Business Strategy & Constitution\n\nThis proposal seeks to elect an executive committee (the “Committee”) for the Founder’s DAO (“DAO”) that will oversee the development and finalization of the business strategy and the constitution for the DAO. Additionally, the Committee shall be charged with collecting feedback and community input about the business strategy and constitution before submitting it for final approval of adoption by the DAO. The committee should consist of (5) DAO token holders, and will disperse after the business strategy and constitution are completed. The hope is that a Steering Committee of (3) members will be elected and formed after to help manage and steer the DAO business ventures. \n\nThis proposal aims to start an election so that the DAO members can elect the (5) representatives who will define and complete a formal business strategy and constitution for the DAO to execute upon. The Candidates are as follows (You can find out more about each candidate at the application form responses here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hJhnUfINnYxf4xcfZKs5gnkLqanyJWKzocQM-Br72T4/edit?usp=sharing )\n\nCandidates: \n\n@mesk__85 / mesk85.eth#1911\nsAndElf#8691\nbennydlowkey\nMacdad#5273\naveragejocrypto#8842\nCryptoScottie#6527 / @CryptoScottie\nverbdan\n@SoCalBeachDaze / Lain333#6643\n@Doop#1373\n\nPlease select the order of which candidates you believe best for this temporary executive committee to formulate the constitution and business strategy for the DAO as outlined in this proposal that passed: https://snapshot.org/#/foundersdao.eth/proposal/0x8ff2089d2f91f3993d0f93db7a400843e931d59db72f22d000cc359f2ffbb507\n\nBusiness strategies and constitutions (example in the last sections below) are pivotal to the success of any organization, including decentralized autonomous organizations. Currently, PVFD is looking to shape its brand, build income streams and scale its value. Establishing a specific committee that can represent the interests of DAO members is necessary for the community to quickly and definitively build our strategy and constitution to hand over to a steering committee to help manage and progress with the community. \n\nBusiness Strategy & Constitution Launch Election Process:\n\nThe Communications Committee will create and post a Survey in DAO Announcements for all members within the FoundersDAO interested in being elected to the Executive Committee to participate with. (done)\nInterested members will need to complete the survey by the posted deadline in order to be a candidate in the election. (done)\nA Twitter Spaces for PVFD will be held to chat with any candidates that would like to share their vision for PVFD and experience with business strategy \nMembers will be allowed to share their portfolio or anything else that will help their chances within the discord or in the forum section of the proposal.\nSnapshot will be used to vote in the (5) members on this temporary Executive Committee to create the business plan and constitution \n\nThe election will take place through Snapshot. A google survey will be sent out to all DAO members so they can apply for the committee. \n\nCommittee Charter\n\nSecond, the Committee must adhere to the Communications Committee Charter, which is in draft form here (link 5). This charter shall seek to be a guidepost for current and future Committee representatives, as they seek to scale the DAO communications channels properly and efficiently.\n\nCommittee Fees\n\nThe DAO should seek to engage with individuals who are (1) passionate about business structuring and strategy and (2) have the necessary skills to effectively scale the DAO business and asset worth. In order to capture the most optimal talent, and in consideration for the services provided, the Committee representatives should receive value each month.\n\nThe estimated time per month that each Committee representative will spend to draft up the final business strategy and constitution is approximately 10 - 20 hours. Our initial suggestion  would be to propose that each Committee representative receive $500 worth of $APE Coin  so long as such person is a part of the completed version of the Founders DAO business strategy and constitution. Each member will be paid $500 in APE after the proposal to instate the business strategy and constitution has passed via Snapshot vote. \n\n\n\nCommittee Suggested Experience\n\nThis proposal proposes that the elected committee members who serve should have the necessary experience and can commit the 10-20 hours time as soon as the proposal is passed. Committee members will have the ability to vote out someone of their own committee if necessary. \n\nMotivation\n\nTo establish a constitution and business strategy  platform outside of Pixel Vault, Inc.and specifically for the Founders DAO; to create a sustainable and concrete plan to grow our vault assets and community member base in an adaptive and progressive way that appeals to the majority of our current members. \n\nBenefits\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish DAO’s business strategy and constitution so that it can carry on with other ventures in a seamless and brand aligned fashion. \n\nDrawbacks\n\nFormalizing a business constitution and strategy will require time and dedication that DAO token holders may not have to come together in an organized manner; however, by adding a small incentive mechanism, we look to have engaged representatives of the community participate on this committee. Another drawback is operations and implementation amongst DAO tokenolders. \n\nStrategy Framework \n\n“A Good Strategy identifies one or two critical issues and then focuses and concentrates action and resources on them. It doesn’t just draw on existing strength; it creates strength through the coherence of its design.”\n\nA strategy is not a list of goals or aspirations. We must diagnose the most important challenges to focus on, and then build an approach to deal with the obstacles. \n\nWhat are the most critical challenges facing the FoundersDAO? \nWhat are the guiding principles that are important to the FoundersDAO?\nWhat are realistic actions that can be taken to deal with those challenges?\n\nExample Strategy for the FoundersDAO:\n\nAn example of a business strategy for the Founders DAO can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-OVfcRwQDciaP8l2RCzcarF5zCdVJAnrjZnaVlexpM0/edit?usp=sharing\n\nAn example of a DAO constitution from ENS - https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/ens-dao-constitution\n\nOutcomes\n\nThe goal for this proposal is to establish a DAO-specific business strategy and constitution that will efficiently scale the DAO’s assets, income streams and community base beyond its current status. The optimal outcomes include (1) A business strategy which includes our mission/vision/executive summary that will then lead into defining what milestones, brand and business development should be like, (2) An understanding of how we look to leverage our assets and community to create more wealth for the DAO and notoriety in the space and (3) to build an adaptable system of growing our DAOs business strategy and development. \n\nThe overall community's primary challenge is to onboard new members into the deep character and complex universe of Pixel Vault, FoundersDAO, and UPDAO. The care and support of new and existing members can only be accomplished by our collective efforts. We are all responsible for being advocates and of service to others.  Peer-support is a core principle value of all FoundersDAO members. \n",

      "title": "Elect the Executive Committee Members to Stand-Up DAO Business Strategy & Constitution",
      "content": "This proposal seeks to elect an executive committee (the “Committee”) for the Founder’s DAO (“DAO”) that will oversee the development and finalization of the business strategy and the constitution for the DAO. Additionally, the Committee shall be charged with collecting feedback and community input about the business strategy and constitution before submitting it for final approval of adoption by the DAO. The committee should consist of (5) DAO token holders, and will disperse after the business strategy and constitution are completed. The hope is that a Steering Committee of (3) members will be elected and formed after to help manage and steer the DAO business ventures. \n\nThis proposal aims to start an election so that the DAO members can elect the (5) representatives who will define and complete a formal business strategy and constitution for the DAO to execute upon. The Candidates are as follows (You can find out more about each candidate at the application form responses here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hJhnUfINnYxf4xcfZKs5gnkLqanyJWKzocQM-Br72T4/edit?usp=sharing )\n\nCandidates: \n\n@mesk__85 / mesk85.eth#1911\nsAndElf#8691\nbennydlowkey\nMacdad#5273\naveragejocrypto#8842\nCryptoScottie#6527 / @CryptoScottie\nverbdan\n@SoCalBeachDaze / Lain333#6643\n@Doop#1373\n\nPlease select the order of which candidates you believe best for this temporary executive committee to formulate the constitution and business strategy for the DAO as outlined in this proposal that passed: https://snapshot.org/#/foundersdao.eth/proposal/0x8ff2089d2f91f3993d0f93db7a400843e931d59db72f22d000cc359f2ffbb507\n\nBusiness strategies and constitutions (example in the last sections below) are pivotal to the success of any organization, including decentralized autonomous organizations. Currently, PVFD is looking to shape its brand, build income streams and scale its value. Establishing a specific committee that can represent the interests of DAO members is necessary for the community to quickly and definitively build our strategy and constitution to hand over to a steering committee to help manage and progress with the community. \n\nBusiness Strategy & Constitution Launch Election Process:\n\nThe Communications Committee will create and post a Survey in DAO Announcements for all members within the FoundersDAO interested in being elected to the Executive Committee to participate with. (done)\nInterested members will need to complete the survey by the posted deadline in order to be a candidate in the election. (done)\nA Twitter Spaces for PVFD will be held to chat with any candidates that would like to share their vision for PVFD and experience with business strategy \nMembers will be allowed to share their portfolio or anything else that will help their chances within the discord or in the forum section of the proposal.\nSnapshot will be used to vote in the (5) members on this temporary Executive Committee to create the business plan and constitution \n\nThe election will take place through Snapshot. A google survey will be sent out to all DAO members so they can apply for the committee. \n\nCommittee Charter\n\nSecond, the Committee must adhere to the Communications Committee Charter, which is in draft form here (link 5). This charter shall seek to be a guidepost for current and future Committee representatives, as they seek to scale the DAO communications channels properly and efficiently.\n\nCommittee Fees\n\nThe DAO should seek to engage with individuals who are (1) passionate about business structuring and strategy and (2) have the necessary skills to effectively scale the DAO business and asset worth. In order to capture the most optimal talent, and in consideration for the services provided, the Committee representatives should receive value each month.\n\nThe estimated time per month that each Committee representative will spend to draft up the final business strategy and constitution is approximately 10 - 20 hours. Our initial suggestion  would be to propose that each Committee representative receive $500 worth of $APE Coin  so long as such person is a part of the completed version of the Founders DAO business strategy and constitution. Each member will be paid $500 in APE after the proposal to instate the business strategy and constitution has passed via Snapshot vote. \n\n\n\nCommittee Suggested Experience\n\nThis proposal proposes that the elected committee members who serve should have the necessary experience and can commit the 10-20 hours time as soon as the proposal is passed. Committee members will have the ability to vote out someone of their own committee if necessary. \n\nMotivation\n\nTo establish a constitution and business strategy  platform outside of Pixel Vault, Inc.and specifically for the Founders DAO; to create a sustainable and concrete plan to grow our vault assets and community member base in an adaptive and progressive way that appeals to the majority of our current members. \n\nBenefits\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish DAO’s business strategy and constitution so that it can carry on with other ventures in a seamless and brand aligned fashion. \n\nDrawbacks\n\nFormalizing a business constitution and strategy will require time and dedication that DAO token holders may not have to come together in an organized manner; however, by adding a small incentive mechanism, we look to have engaged representatives of the community participate on this committee. Another drawback is operations and implementation amongst DAO tokenolders. \n\nStrategy Framework \n\n“A Good Strategy identifies one or two critical issues and then focuses and concentrates action and resources on them. It doesn’t just draw on existing strength; it creates strength through the coherence of its design.”\n\nA strategy is not a list of goals or aspirations. We must diagnose the most important challenges to focus on, and then build an approach to deal with the obstacles. \n\nWhat are the most critical challenges facing the FoundersDAO? \nWhat are the guiding principles that are important to the FoundersDAO?\nWhat are realistic actions that can be taken to deal with those challenges?\n\nExample Strategy for the FoundersDAO:\n\nAn example of a business strategy for the Founders DAO can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-OVfcRwQDciaP8l2RCzcarF5zCdVJAnrjZnaVlexpM0/edit?usp=sharing\n\nAn example of a DAO constitution from ENS - https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/ens-dao-constitution\n\nOutcomes\n\nThe goal for this proposal is to establish a DAO-specific business strategy and constitution that will efficiently scale the DAO’s assets, income streams and community base beyond its current status. The optimal outcomes include (1) A business strategy which includes our mission/vision/executive summary that will then lead into defining what milestones, brand and business development should be like, (2) An understanding of how we look to leverage our assets and community to create more wealth for the DAO and notoriety in the space and (3) to build an adaptable system of growing our DAOs business strategy and development. \n\nThe community's primary challenge is to onboard new members into the deep character and complex universe of Pixel Vault, FoundersDAO, and UPDAO. The care and support of new and existing members can only be accomplished by our collective efforts. We are all responsible for being advocates and of service to others.  Peer-support is a core principle value of all FoundersDAO members. As owners we should contribute to supercharged communications, build lore, and make this the most epic LARP adventure in the Heroverse.\n",

      "content": "Abstract: \n\nThis proposal seeks to award retroactive payment of $500 in $APE coin to the communications committee members who were mistakenly left off the initial proposal where this payment was authorized.\n\nBevs has chosen to voluntarily forego this payment, which means this proposal would authorize a one time payment of $500 in $APE to Villainsky for service on the committee for the month of July.\n\nDetails:\nThe motion to add Villainsky and Bevs to the communications committee went live for voting on July 1st and passed July 6th, and both began working on the committee immediately afterwards (https://snapshot.org/#/foundersdao.eth/proposal/0xcc8129bc2ec40ac07c19e78c712956abc020a6ce6ef03fad2ba7e92869ce23b9).\n\nA proposal to update the compensation of the communications committee and award retroactive payment for June and July was passed on August 4th (https://snapshot.org/#/foundersdao.eth/proposal/0xdde57b93800011e28533ec91248309d0b8f72f05122a407428f0423b85d599d7).\n\nThis proposal was not written by the communications committee and failed to include the two new members for the month of July–only awarding payment to melvincapital, zentensivitst and westcoastwalker.\n\nGiven that both Bevs and Villainsky served on the committee during July, it is fair to award them the same retroactive compensation.\n\nBevs, who is now employed by Pixel Vault Inc, has voluntarily chosen to forego this payment.\n\nUpsides to the proposal:\n-It is important for the DAO to operate professionally and compensate people for their time. It is only fair to award the same pay to all members of the communications committee.\n\nDownsides:\nThere would be a one-time cost to the DAO of $500. This is the same amount that the proposal to compensate the communications committee awards to all members for each month served.\n",

      "title": "Adopt Founder's DAO gitbook, propose annual communications committee budget, and backpayment for Bevs and Villainsky",
      "content": "Abstract: \n\nThe communications committee proposes the following:\n\n-Adopting a gitbook for presentation of the DAO’s assets (https://foundersdao.gitbook.io)\n-An annual budget for maintaining the gitbook and creative tools\n-Back pay for July for Villainsky and Bevs not included in the original proposal\n-Total costs for all of the above $2338 to be paid in $ape coin. $480 for gitbook subscription, $858 for creative tools, $1000 for backpay.\n\nSee below for detailed descriptions of each proposed action item.\n\nGitbook:\nThe communications committee would like to propose adopting this gitbook that we have created as the official presentation of the Founder’s DAO wallet assets. \nLink here: https://foundersdao.gitbook.io/founders-dao-assets/\n\nWe have created a curated selection of the DAO’s holdings with descriptions of their history and significance. This has been posted in the DAO-feedback channel and on the community discourse for the last week and has received positive feedback.\n\nWe believe that maintaining an official presentation of our DAO’s holdings is important both for informing the community about what assets we hold, as well as for recruiting new members. Gitbook provides an easily updatable and customizable interface for this task.\n\nAnnual Communications Committee budget:\n\nAs part of this proposal we would like to propose a small annual budget for the communications committee for maintaining the gitbook and several other subscriptions and products we feel are needed to best do the work of promoting the Founder’s DAO and keeping our members informed and engaged.\n\nThe total proposed budget for the next year is $1238, which includes the following:\n-Microphone for Villainsky for hosting community spaces ($108)\n-$500 for subscriptions to music and special effects platforms and purchase of graphic assets for video content\n-$250/year for a photoshop license\n-$480 for a group gitbook subscription\n\nJuly Back Payment for Bevs and Villainsky:\n\nThe original proposal to switch payment of communications committee members to $500/month in $ape coin mistakenly did not include back payment for Bevs and Villainsky, despite having served on the committee in July. As part of this proposal we request authorization to include them on the July back-payment at a total cost of $1000 in $ape.\n\nProposed benefits:\n-The gitbook will provide an easy reference for community members to see the DAO’s wallet assets, which can allow for more knowledge and creativity for how we might productively use them.\n-We believe an attractive and educational presentation of wallet assets can help attract new members to the DAO\n-The proposed budget for creative tools will allow the committee to create more and better quality content to promote the DAO\n\nPossible downsides:\n-It is possible that the work and content produced by the communications committee may not add value to the degree of the costs\n-It is possible that $ape coin appreciates and the USD cost of the proposed expenses is higher in one year’s time than today\n",

      "content": "The FoundersDAO communication committee launched the first of four ‘Community Content Challenges’ on June 15th. The first content challenge was focused on the Punks Comic Universe and the guidelines were simple - create content that helps educate and promote the Punks Comic Universe. The challenge is now closed and we are thrilled to have received 10 submissions from 9 individuals. The content produced is wide ranging, informative and fun. \n\nNow, each FoundersDAO community member needs to vote and rank each submission based on what you believe best delivered on the mission of creating content that “educates and promotes the Punks Comic Universe”. \n\nThe reward structure is tiered and the final ranking (via community voting) will determine how many Mint Pass 2’s each submission is rewarded. There are 10 possible rewards, so each submission will win at least 1 Mint Pass 2. The breakdown of rewards are as follows:\n\n1st - 20 MP2\n2nd - 10 MP2\n3rd - 5 MP2\n4th - 5 MP2\n5th - 5 MP2\n6-10th - each will receive 1 MP2\n\nEach PVFD holder should vote/rank all content creators 1st - 10th. The 1st position is the best and will receive 20MP2’s and 10th is your least favorite and will receive 1 MP2. We will then tally all points (10 pts for a 1st place vote, 9 pts for 2nd, etc) and assign a final ranking according to the community’s vote. Additionally, there is only 1 vote per token holder. So if you hold 10 PVFD’s then your vote/ranking will only be counted once. We did this to avoid having a PVFD whale sway the entire reward distribution. \n\nPlease take a moment to review all 10 submissions below, then rank them from 1 (best) to 10 (least favorite). Once voting closes we will tabulate the final ranking and share with the community.\n\nThanks and we hope you enjoy the community's effort!\n\nCOMMUNITY CONTENT CHALLENGE #1 SUBMISSIONS\n\nXurd - $PUNKS Token Infographic: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MFS6MiqY4lLFQM5rfM1XkR4I3_vaVshN/view?usp=sharing\n\nMetaNFT - Burning Comic 1 Artwork: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YTsZpx_nICz_8FOSRod_yMKCcCdF-8b_/view?usp=sharing\n\nDenze #1 - Pixel Vault Community Gitbook: PUNKS ecosystem: https://denze.gitbook.io/pixel-vault/learn/ecosystem/punks\n\nDenze #2: Origin Stories Dashboard: https://dune.com/denze/pv-origin-stories\n\nCircular Waves - Punks Universe Infographic: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bmjwU66FPf5qWXxFWwyn8hK5kdjR_nq1/view?usp=sharing\n\nVillianksy - Punks Comic Twitter Spaces: https://twitter.com/villainsky_/status/1563219309266030594?s=20&t=udE335cqhAxEoCddBiudqg\n\nBevs - Punks Comic Video: https://twitter.com/bevs809/status/1542542225514659840?s=20&t=Bs_NOCAjGhQUWojjRhU-ZA\n\nJuicyJama - Punks Comic Infographic: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NMInNNIElX3O0vhTvHg5QCsTMP74J6hk/view?usp=sharing\n\nBoomroasted.eth - Punks Comic Memes (1) (2):  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FD-bcy3QwUWc7xzVEvhgKShjQ6SHSpbP/view?usp=sharing \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1uNwR6WYDGmePVDZPQ1FBd03nhE8ffkeZ/view?usp=sharing\n\nProblyNothing - Punks Comic Youtube Video: https://youtu.be/biu3IX3hY6Y",

      "title": "Executive Committee to Stand-Up DAO Business Strategy & Constitution",
      "content": "Executive Committee to Stand-Up DAO Business Strategy & Constitution\n\nThis proposal seeks to elect an executive committee (the “Committee”) for the Founder’s DAO (“DAO”) that will oversee the development and finalization of the business strategy and the constitution for the DAO. Additionally, the Committee shall be charged with collecting feedback and community input about the business strategy and constitution before submitting it for final approval of adoption by the DAO. The committee should consist of (5) DAO token holders, and will disperse after the business strategy and constitution are completed. The hope is that a Steering Committee of (3) members will be elected and formed after to help manage and steer the DAO business ventures. \n\nThis proposal aims to start an election so that the DAO members can elect the (5) representatives who will define and complete a formal business strategy and constitution for the DAO to execute upon. \n\nBusiness strategies and constitutions (example in sections below) are pivotal to the success of any organization, including decentralized autonomous organizations. Currently, PVFD is looking to shape its brand, build income streams and scale its value. Establishing a specific committee that can represent the interests of DAO members is necessary for the community to quickly and definitively build our strategy and constitution to hand over to a steering committee to help manage and progress with the community. \n\nBusiness Strategy & Constitution Launch Election Process:\n\nThe Communications Committee will create and post a Survey in DAO Announcements for all members within the FoundersDAO interested in being elected to the Executive Committee to participate with. \nInterested members will need to complete the survey by the posted deadline in order to be a candidate in the election. \nA Twitter Spaces for PVFD will be held to chat with any candidates that would like to share their vision for PVFD and experience with business strategy \nMembers will be allowed to share their portfolio or anything else that will help their chances within the discord or in the forum section of the proposal.\nSnapshot will be used to vote in the (5) members on this temporary Executive Committee to create the business plan and constitution \n\nThe election will take place through Snapshot. A google survey will be sent out to all DAO members so they can apply for the committee. \n\nCommittee Charter\n\nSecond, the Committee must adhere to the Communications Committee Charter, which is in draft form here (link 5). This charter shall seek to be a guidepost for current and future Committee representatives, as they seek to scale the DAO communications channels properly and efficiently.\n\nCommittee Fees\n\nThe DAO should seek to engage with individuals who are (1) passionate about business structuring and strategy and (2) have the necessary skills to effectively scale the DAO business and asset worth. In order to capture the most optimal talent, and in consideration for the services provided, the Committee representatives should receive value each month.\n\nThe estimated time per month that each Committee representative will spend to draft up the final business strategy and constitution is approximately 10 - 20 hours. Our initial suggestion  would be to propose that each Committee representative receive $500 worth of $APE Coin  so long as such person is a part of the completed version of the Founders DAO business strategy and constitution. Each member will be paid $500 in APE after the proposal to instate the business strategy and constitution has passed via Snapshot vote. \n\n\n\nCommittee Suggested Experience\n\nThis proposal proposes that the elected committee members who serve should have the necessary experience and can commit the 10-20 hours time as soon as the proposal is passed. Committee members will have the ability to vote out someone of their own committee if necessary. \n\nExperience that is a plus:\n\nExperience with business strategy, project management/controls or sales marketing is required. \nAn experience with managing assets and IP development \nAn active members within the discord and overall Founders DAO activities\nBusiness Ownership\nStartup experience \nCreative directing and development Proposal For Executive Committee to Stand-Up DAO Business Strategy & Constitution\nBusiness development and analysis q\nProfessional experience with law or taxation \n\nMotivation\n\nTo establish a constitution and business strategy  platform outside of Pixel Vault, Inc.and specifically for the Founders DAO; to create a sustainable and concrete plan to grow our vault assets and community member base in an adaptive and progressive way that appeals to the majority of our current members. \n\nBenefits\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish DAO’s business strategy and constitution so that it can carry on with other ventures in a seamless and brand aligned fashion. \n\nDrawbacks\n\nFormalizing a business constitution and strategy will require time and dedication that DAO token holders may not have to come together in an organized manner; however, by adding a small incentive mechanism, we look to have engaged representatives of the community participate on this committee. Another drawback is operations and implementation amongst DAO token holders. \n\nStrategy Framework \n\n“A Good Strategy identifies one or two critical issues and then focuses and concentrates action and resources on them. It doesn’t just draw on existing strength; it creates strength through the coherence of its design.”\n\nA strategy is not a list of goals or aspirations. We must diagnose the most important challenges to focus on, and then build an approach to deal with the obstacles. \n\nWhat are the most critical challenges facing the FoundersDAO? \nWhat are the guiding principles that are important to the FoundersDAO?\nWhat are realistic actions that can be taken to deal with those challenges?\n\nExample Strategy for the FoundersDAO:\n\nAn example of a business strategy for the Founders DAO can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-OVfcRwQDciaP8l2RCzcarF5zCdVJAnrjZnaVlexpM0/edit?usp=sharing\n\nAn example of a DAO constitution from ENS - https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/ens-dao-constitution\n\nOutcomes\n\nThe goal for this proposal is to establish a DAO-specific business strategy and constitution that will efficiently scale the DAO’s assets, income streams and community base beyond its current status. The optimal outcomes include (1) A business strategy which includes our mission/vision/executive summary that will then lead into defining what milestones, brand and business development should be like, (2) An understanding of how we look to leverage our assets and community to create more wealth for the DAO and notoriety in the space and (3) to build an adaptable system of growing our DAOs business strategy and development. \n\nThe community's primary challenge is to onboard new members into the deep character and complex universe of Pixel Vault, FoundersDAO, and UPDAO. The care and support of new and existing members can only be accomplished by our collective efforts. We are all responsible for being advocates and of service to others.  Peer-support is a core principle value of all FoundersDAO members. As owners we should contribute to supercharged communications, build lore, and make this the most epic LARP adventure in the Heroverse. \n\nRecommended Structure for Developing a Strategy: \nGood Strategy/Bad Strategy book\nBook Summary of Good Strategy/Bad Strategy\n",

      "title": "Motion as Formal Request to PixelVault for 10KTF to Consider the MetaHero Generative Collection ",
      "content": "Preamble: \nAuthors: @verbdan, @fortunate, @brooklyn\nImplementor: Founder’s DAO Community Members\n\nCreated Date: August 8, 2022\n\n\nSummary:\n\nThis proposal will be about garnering internal support to illustrate to PixelVault and further 10KTF our (the PVFD) dedication to being included in their supported umbrella of web3 communities. Our collective sentiment is the only measure of this proposal; though as contributors to this proposal, making it on-chain is personally important. \nThis well renown NFT project utilizing a charming master craftsman as the spokesperson, also incorporates incredible leadership and community support which deserves nothing but respect in our approach for acceptance. \nNotice us, Senpai!\n\n\nAbstract:\n\nUpon a ‘yay’ vote for this proposal, verbdan et al. will submit this proposal to PixelVault, with the expectation to open official (verifiable) communication to 10KTF, in lieu of our community’s beloved Generative MetaHero’s (collection name as of creation date). The communication would be to ask to be incorporated into their related lore, experiences, and ultimately smart contracts as an accepted collection.\nThere is a separate goal to demonstrate how NFT communities and further DAO’s can be metaphorical megaphone for those with smaller voices but caring communities. \n\n\nMotivation/Background:\n\nWagmi-san has been the face of an adventure for the followers (frens) of the 10KTF project, drawing in (now extremely) loyal fans since fall of 2021. This has been expertly done using story-telling elements that have absolutely pioneered a path within web3, using peripheral projects (read: BAYC, CryptoPunks, MAYC, WoW, CoolCats, WolfGame, etc.) as the sentimental draw to the story. \nSeeing that many communities want to be a part of the 10KTF story, we feel absolutely compelled to let them know our passion; as the very first day Wagmi-san opened his doors we as MetaHero’s we’re outside and crafting our favorite supported profile pic’s (pfp’s) Hi-tops and daypacks. Inclusion for our MetaHero’s would be remarkable, and expressing that on the blockchain, feels like the heart of web3.\n\nOne last thing as a motivating piece: \nIn the 10KTF decentralized application’s ‘FAQ’*, an answer to ‘Can you make items for XYZ NFT project?’, was responded to with the language ‘Yes! Send us your suggestions. However, please note that 10KTF items can only be created for NFT projects that grant commercial rights to their owners’. Our generative MetaHero’s (brief mention of the unknown future name change) fit this requirement, per our agreement**.\n\n\nBenefits: \n\n- The benefit to our DAO comes from further IP growth through the means of greater NFT community acceptance, if the 10KTF team decides to welcome us. \n- Even in the event they say no, (that is: to a successful vote here and followed request to them), we get feedback to perhaps try again.\n\n\nDrawbacks:\n\n- We don’t get accepted into Wagmi-san’s fold. Simple as. We can handle a ‘no’.\n  \n\nCitations:\n*https://10ktf.com/#FAQ \n**https://punkscomic.com/assets/files/MetaHeroLicenseAgreement.pdf (section 3, paragraph d)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreicknijvymxkc3pzmpo2ncjutw2khsfr2gx3rluwmxxyhzxjpvsj5e)\n    \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigmgih2nygoprhen5l2bjhaosfq6x27ai7i74ju7gzth54blf6r6q)\n    ",

      "title": "Updating the Communication Committee's Compensation ",
      "content": "Author: WestCoastWalker, with support from the Comms Committee.\n\nThis proposal is to clarify and amend the previous communications committee proposal, specifically to clarify the compensation of communications committee members. \n\nIn the previous communication committee proposal, it was stated the members would receive 2 Jupiter tokens, which at the time of proposal was roughly $500 ($250 per Jupiter token). The proposal also mentions that a new proposal could be brought forth in the event that the value of planets dropped. \n\n“The DAO currently owns 2,235 Jupiter tokens, and as of today, each is valued at 0.08 ETH (or approximately $250 USD). With no more than five (5) committee representatives serving at any time, this equates to 10 Jupiter tokens per month, or 120 per year. Furthermore, as of today’s value, this equates to approximately $500 per month in value that each Committee representative will receive. This will be the target compensation for a Committee representative and may be adjusted from time to time through a separate FDIP (or through delegation to a Finance Committee in the future) should the market value of the Jupiter tokens materially change.”\n\nAs of 7/24/22, the Jupiter planet is currently worth $72 per Jupiter or roughly $140 per month. This is substantially less compensation than what was intended to provide our committee members. \n\nI propose setting the compensation for each committee member to $500 worth of Jupiter tokens at the time of each pay period (the 1st of the month). I also believe the committee members should be retroactively awarded the full June and July compensation amount. This would equate to an additional 6 Jupiters tokens each for MelvinCapital, Zentensivist, and WestCoastWalker, to be awarded upon this proposal passing.\n \nThe Communications Committee has provided a great service and value to the Founders DAO community. The amount of work each member has contributed is far beyond the $140 per month that is currently being awarded to each member. Also, with the addition of Bevs and Villiansky, the comms committee has added significant talent, which will only increase the quality and speed of our content and support.\n\nI ask that the community support this proposal and vote yes to set compensation to the original intention of $500 of Jupiter tokens per month.

      "title": "Creation of a PVFD Steering Committee",
      "content": "The purpose of this proposal is to call for the creation of a PVFD Steering Committee. A steering committee is generally concerned with the development of strategy and execution for a project’s vision, prioritizing strategies, and monitoring progress.\n\nRecent events in PV writ large and in the PVFD community suggest that the time is right for us to establish a steering committee:\n\n1. PV providing a royalty split with PVFD on secondary sales of PVFD token and the forthcoming pfp from Odious.\n2. Odious creating a new pfp for PVFD with to-be-determined utility by the PVFD.\n3. The role of PVFD in the MH UPDAO with planet tokens and voting rights.\n4. Creation of the PV Sports vertical where PVFD will minimally indirectly benefit from new partnerships.\n\nA reality our DAO will soon be faced with is how to manage not just these opportunities but the general identity of PVFD and the mechanisms to create and maintain a presence in web3 that attracts newcomers and maintains strong ties to PV. In light of these events, I propose that we create a steering committee consisting of 5 members whose charge is to:\n\n1. Develop and propose the mission statement of PVFD.\n2. Develop and propose the main objectives the steering committee wishes to act on [e.g., develop proposal(s) for odious pfp utility, develop proposal(s) for PVFD fund use].\n3. Create subcommittees as needed to achieve the goals associated with identified objectives.\n4. Interface with the Communications Committee.\n5. Create possible bylaws for steering committee governance.\n\nInitial steering committee members will be determined by interested PVFD members providing a short bio as to their knowledge, skills, and experience that will be posted in a steering committee channel in PVFD. The top 5 vote-getters will serve on the steering committee for a term of 1-year that can be renewed through an annual vote. Other facets of committee membership can be developed and proposed by the steering committee.\n\nIn all manner of operations, the steering committee interacts with the PVFD community so that the committee takes its cues from the PVFD to create direction, and in turn the PVFD community supports and shapes the proposal ideas from the steering committee.",

      "title": "Refund Comic 3 Mint Donations",
      "content": "This proposal aims to refund the 7 individuals who donated .1 ETH each to help the DAO mint comic 3. This seems like a no brainer and I wish we didnt need a proposal for it, but as a DAO, we need a proper vote to have our signers execute a tx.\n\nSummary: In an effort to raise some ETH for the DAO to mint comic 3 (the FoundersDAO only had 1.41 ETH in its treasury at the moment) a few faithful community members joined together and donated a total of .7 ETH to the DAO. We did this because we believed that the DAO should try and mint a few comic 3’s, as we were eligible for 4 mints in window 1, and basically unlimited in window 2. So, a few days before the mint of Comic 3, I (WCW) proposed that the community ban together and each send .1 ETH to the Founders DAO account so that we could purchase some Comic 3’s. There was no guarantee that those who donated the .1 ETH would be rewarded or even reimbursed if the DAO did not mint. And no guarantee that we were going to be able to execute the mint.\n\nHowever, even though many of us were asking our signers to mint comic 3, nothing happened and nothing was minted. A bummer, but in retrospect makes sense since we did not have a formal vote on minting comic 3.\n\nAnd even though the DAO did not mint, I think this was a great, organic community effort to show support for minting an asset together as a community. There were 7 individuals who donated .1 ETH each and I would like to request that the DAO reimburse each address the .1 ETH\n\nAs someone who initiated the idea of funding the DAO so we could mint comic 3, I feel obligated to submit this proposal on behalf of the others who donated. I think sending the .1 ETH back to each address that donated is the right thing to do.\n\nThe donating addresses are below:\n0x8f4115a174b5d669f8c78cdf460a0a0be3747c30\n0x659c314ea1fc4d4fbdb870ae03fec93e50683cd1\n0x144f7375c888297f8a9166381e0f8cd48b8b33b9\n0x5b60117255df27fdd885629c0210d9dd975ff975\n0xea575259026de1352d7ef5a4b96a6fd8868146bb\n0x3862903859ea9b1ce6804823bd9ca7a249afebb3\n0x49cacab31682089ea11913614d2ba3065264294d",

      "content": "**Abstract:**\n\nThe communications committee currently has 3 members, out a maximum of 5 possible members. We seek to add two committee members with skills in video presentation and hosting live, online community events. We recommend two DAO members–Bevs and Villainsky–to fill these roles. \n\n**Overview and Proposed New Communications Committee Members:**\n\nThe Founder’s DAO Communications Committee currently has 2 vacant spots and this is a proposal to fill them. Please see the previously passed proposal establishing the committee for a description of the committee’s purpose, compensation and other details (https://snapshot.org/#/foundersdao.eth/proposal/0xd4f916bd521c36add885a4b30c55d6ddbfc2d1319f562308aab5d7b4118d433f)\n\nThe Communications Committee would like to thank Rusty Sailor and MickyD for their valuable service on the Communications Committee over the last several months, and recommend adding two community members Bevs (https://twitter.com/bevs809) and Villainsky (https://twitter.com/villainsky_) to fill their vacant roles. The Communications Committee has a significant need for their skills and interests in video communications and live audio hosting and we believe both the community and the committee would benefit greatly from their addition. Their brief biographies are below:\n\n**Bevs.eth:**\n\nI’m a video marketing professional with 10+ years of industry experience, including managing social media for one of Australia’s largest sporting franchises. I’m currently employed as global head of video at a multi-billion dollar consulting firm, where I work alongside some internationally recognised marketers to deliver content for global marketing campaigns and major partnerships.\n\nI am a Pixel Vault maxi, and have a deep understanding of PV’s many offerings. I’d love the opportunity to join the talented PVFD comms committee and to build together with all of you. I believe we can use the power of video to cut through the noise of the NFT space, and effectively communicate the Pixel Vault ecosystem. Driving value to the PVFD, and all PV NFTs.\n\nSee the following posts for examples of Bevs previous work creating videos within the Pixel Vault ecosystem:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/bevs809/status/1539003279060783104\n\nhttps://twitter.com/bevs809/status/1539782789490302976\n\n**Villainsky:**\n\nFirst off, I’m honored and excited to be considered for joining the PVFD communications committee. Although I’m fairly new to PVFD, I’ve been a part of the Pixel Vault ecosystem since October 2021. I’m no whale, or even dolphin, but PV is my largest bag. I currently host a Twitter Spaces for the PV community on Saturdays at 1030am PST in which 100s of people have joined. It’s something I enjoy hosting immensely, and would be happy to do the same specifically for PVFD and it’s members. I’m based in Orange County California, and studied civil engineering.\n\nI’m 31 and currently work as a Project Manager for one of the largest Construction companies globally. My communication background is heavily chiselled by me being a Project Manager wearing man hats and also running a few startups myself. I enjoy networking, socializing and learning about people and their story, which has been why the community spaces has been so much fun. My motivation for joining the community is that Pixel Vault is built around fair governance technology and distribution, as well as the possible gaming economy they are building for us and future generations. The core reason I believe in NFTs and Web3 is the transparency and ownership it provides to the community, and try to invest in the projects that focus on community governance, fair distribution and diverse inclusion. I love that PVFD’s culture is centered around this, and that it’s working alongside Pixel Vault to accomplish these grand endeavors.\n\nSee below for the community space hosted most recently by Villainsky:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/villainsky_/status/1539639765141557248\n",

      "title": "Community Generated Content Initiative",
      "content": "Community generated content is an incredibly valuable asset for any community. This type of grass roots content is very authentic and is often a reflection of an engaged and passionate community. It’s also a powerful tool for educating and growing a community - which is particularly useful for an ecosystem as intricate and engaging as Pixel Vault.\n\nWe, the communications committee, believe creating and supporting a ‘community generated content’ program is a great way to create awareness and education of our brands. We also believe an important use case for the Founder’s DAO treasury can be supporting important community initiatives like this.\n\nTherefore, to encourage the development of community content, the Founder’s DAO communications committee proposes creating a reward pool of 200 MintPass 2’s (allocated from the DAO treasury) that will be used as rewards for creating specific types of content that will advance our Pixel Vault ecosystems. The communications committee will develop content challenges that community members will be able to create and submit to the community. Once a challenge has ended, we will post all content creators into a proposal on Snapshot where the community can vote on the distribution of rewards. We imagine doing four challenges, each with 50 MP2’s available as rewards. Some challenges will be open-ended (show us your ideas!) and others will be content specific (Founders DAO branding). Community content can include: videos, articles, memes, youtube videos, podcasts, spaces, educational resources, and more!\n\nOne example of truly excellent community generated content has been the MetaVault podcast and newsletter. MetaVault has been an extremely valuable resource for the entire Pixel Vault community. Not only does it keep the community up to date on all the happenings of the Pixel Vault ecosystem, but it has also aided in bringing in new members to our community - educating and inspiring them to get involved. As a sign of appreciation, the communication committee - along with the community’s support - would like to retroactively reward MetaVault for their amazing contribution to the Pixel Vault community. We propose rewarding the MetaVault team with a total of 12 Mint Pass 2’s (allocated from the DAO treasury). These 12 MP2’s would be in addition to 200 MP2’s mentioned above.\n\nBut how will this community content initiative drive value to the Founders DAO? The Founder’s DAO has significant asset holdings of both the Metahero Universe, via its many MP2’s and planets, as well as its 9.8% stake in UPDAO; and the Punks Comic ecosystem with its holdings of 25,000,000 $PUNKS tokens. Members of the DAO also have significant individual holdings of these assets. Therefore, community generated content that advances these ecosystems directly benefits both the DAO treasury and individual holders’ assets.\n\nProposal: Requesting 212 Mint Pass 2’s from the Founders DAO Treasury for a community generated content program that will be managed by the communication committee. 200 of the Mint Pass 2’s will be used for the reward pool, and 12 Mint Pass 2's will be retroactively rewarded to the MetaVault team.\n\nYes, I support this\nNo, I dont support this",

The Phase 2 token will be returned to the PVFD wallet immediately after claim.\n\n• If there are no volunteers on the council to receive the merch claim, then we will still proceed with the Claim for Phase 2, but skip the delivery of the merch.\n\n• If the merch is claimed, PVFD will have a raffle to give it away. This can be within the PVFD only, or done as a public raffle to help market & promote PVFD.\n\n• Should there be an issue with claiming from a multisig, this proposal approves the transfer to a hot wallet controlled by a trusted council member to proceed with the claim.\n\nA \"YES\" vote, is a vote to approve the measure.\n\nDue to the system requiring rank choice voting, you must choose your selection as your 1st vote and then the other choice as your 2nd vote.",

      "title": "Motion to Initialize an Ethereum Lighthouse Validator",
      "content": "Preamble: \nAuthor: @verbdan\nImplementor: Founder’s DAO Community Member\n\nCreated Date: April 10, 2022\n\n\nSummary:\n\nThis proposal will be about staking 32 Ethereum in becoming an Ethereum Consensus Mainnet  Validator, with a Lighthouse build. This proposal at current prices would lock up 32 Ethereum (approximately $91,000/USD) while costly, if implemented would not only increase the number of decentralized validators, which is key to the Ethereum mission of decentralization. Though running a validator, will importantly, generate more Ethereum through validation as a form of stable investment for the PixelVault Founders DAO, which will commence with the donation of an assembled computer (in specifications) from verbdan to the PixelVault Founders DAO’s location of choice.\n\n\nAbstract:\n\nUpon a ‘yay’ vote for this proposal, verbdan would ship the already built computer (described in specifications), that only requires the lighthouse configuration, to PixelVault’s requested location. Following receipt of the computer, [a non-designated PixelVault employee] would assist with verification of product, condition, validity of parts, etc; then install and configure the computer with requisite software to run the Sigma Prime Lighthouse client (also in specifications), to then connect to the Ethereum Mainnet. \nAfter successful deployment testing on Rinkeby, send the required amount of Ethereum (increments of 32 Ethereum) as further instructed, in delicate instructions, to begin staking. \nUpon a successful connection, syncing, creation of keys (gnosis?), testing and final deposit of eth, the node should be live. From this point forward monitoring, and updating the node will be all the maintenance this new decentralized node will require; without it, rare slashing events can affect the stability and functioning of said node. \nThis running node will act as a beacon of leadership in web3, as locking that Ethereum and operating that node, until deposited Ethereum is unlocked (at which we could vote once again), is far from a short term flip, and promotes decentralization for all.\n\n\nMotivation:\n\nThis new proposal is put forward as a hope to both: continue to lead by example in the web3 space by helping decentralize the Ethereum Network. This first goal will hopefully be encouraged by the second motivation, to generate Ethereum through validating that network; this could be viewed as a ‘long term investment’ for the PVFD. \nHaving both financial and communal benefits, and minimal upkeep, this could help further cement PVFD as true leaders in this space, and with any influence, push other projects to do the same (see: how the Mint Pass has become a movement).\nWe hope to make these benefits clear and push for a strong opportunity.\n\n\nSpecifications:\n\nCurrent specifications to run a validator are listed in the link* below, but listed will be the specifications of the computer that verbdan is pledging to donate, all installed and ready for shipping:\n- Intel Core i3-9100F 3.6 GHz Quad-Core Processor\n- Supermicro X11SCL-IF Mini ITX LGA1151 Motherboard\n- Samsung 16 GB (1 x 16 GB) DDR4-2133 CL15 Memory\n- Samsung 970 Evo Plus 1 TB M.2-2280 NVME Solid State Drive\n- Fractal Design Node 804 MicroATX Mid Tower Case\n- SeaSonic PRIME Fanless 500 W 80+ Platinum Certified Fully Modular Fanless ATX Power Supply\n- intel cpu cooling fan, regular circulation fans, cables (connected), all included \n\nThese specifications meet/exceed the recommended specs to run a lighthouse and I’ve included an extra 1TB drive in the event space is needed in the future, or RAID is configured.\n\nOutside of the computer, one of the final requirements upon successfully syncing to the network is going to be depositing a minimum of 32 Ethereum (per validator) to Fund the Validator Keys making this lighthouse validator active.\n\nLink for guiding the building process and allowing members to be able to follow along (very verbose):\n*https://someresat.medium.com/guide-to-staking-on-ethereum-2-0-ubuntu-lighthouse-41de20513b12, or as updated since 4/16/2022.\n\n\nBenefits: \n\nThe benefits to the proposal come from multiple avenues for our DAO. \n- Passive dependable revenue, resulting in stable ethereum growth for the DAO in the form of Ethereum PoS (Proof of Stake).\n- Camaraderie building with the Ethereum Network, as we would be helping decentralize the greater network, and could create a shift in what ‘community’ can achieve utilizing internal funds for a measurable good.\n- Teaching opportunity for new users that could potentially never dig deep enough to learn about the decentralization mission, but that’s nerd stuff.\n\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nThe validators each cost 32 Ethereum to run, which is no little amount to consider putting on ice. For many of us, this is a life changing amount of money. Our DAO currently holds liquid assets in excess of 150+ Ethereum; this is about 1/5th of our (current) liquidity locked away until Ethereum 2.0 rolls out (to be determined, no use speculating). \nI wage that this amount put away into a validator, whether immediately removed from the validator once the staking lock is removed or not, is an effective way for our DAO to effectively lock and build funds, which allows for greater trust from the community involved in our collective DAO to make exciting plays, while simultaneously also feeling responsible in various verticals. \nAdditionally, using extra resources to verify the proper running of the validator is something that should be considered. Not expected to be much upkeep, but it is going to definitely require attention and care, to prevent slashing.\nSlashing is when a validator isn't doing something it should, which we will have discussion and update one another about, to mitigate our opportunity of encountering as a DAO. \n\n\nOutcomes:\n\nFrom a positive vote for this proposal, verbdan will comply with packing and shipping the computer (from specifications), responsibly to an approved location where approved PV members can/will verify contents, install and configure the lighthouse software, generate and fund validator keys, then monitor and update said validator for an indeterminate amount of time (till a new vote to defund the validator is made), like Desmond from the Lost television show.

For example, say the FD purchases a new NFT with the funds (no matter the cost), it provides an opportunity for publicity and discussion on Twitter. As more active buys and sells occur (no matter the monetary amount), it showcases the DAO and markets to new potential members.\n\nI am using tiered voting so we can vote on the portion to sell, if any: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%.",

      "title": "Motion & Solution to Change the Mintpass Core Raffling System",
      "content": "Preamble: \nAuthor: @verbdan\nType: Governance\nImplementor: Founder’s DAO Community Member\n\nCreated Date: March 9, 2022\n\nSummary:\n\nThis proposal offers an alternative answer to the MetaHero core(s) raffling system, to apply a more balanced approach to what is an already great community focused giveaway system, using the MintPass1 (MP1) ERC-1155 holders. This new adjustment should be what I understand as (at its simplest form) an O(1) complexity solution, and if implemented would increase the number of core holders substantially, in contrast to the current raffle system.\n\nMotivation:\n\nThis adjustment is being proposed due to a constant murmur from the MP1 holders, after each raffle, to be able to contest against the larger holders. The community is under the impression that holders with a small amount of MP1’s are dealing with dependent probability scenarios; where they have an ever increasing chance of their ticket being selected per core drawn, this is not the case. I hope to make that argument and push for a stronger opportunity between each selected core winner for a new wallet to be drawn.\n\nSpecifications:\n\nCurrently prior to the raffle, a snapshot is taken of all MP1 holders, 1 entry per MP1. Following this event, the raffle for each of the cores is held through the Chainlink VRF, 12 Core MetaHeroes at a time and sent to the wallets of each winner. \nThe adjustment to this procedure would be to instead, aggregate the wallet holdings for each wallet, assign weighted  hold 12 separate, though consecutive raffles. \nBetween each raffled core, a step is taken to remove the winner from the snapshot, then continue the raffle. \nWith the psuedo-removal of the MP1 from the raffle pool, in this way, the likelihood of each for each holder winning demonstrably increases.* Regardless of the size of the winner. \n\n*Slides have been created, dm to see visual demonstration of both systems next to one another; as attachments are not allowed.\n\nBenefits: \n\nThe benefits to the proposed changes to the raffle system, may feel like a small gripe of the little man not having an opportunity to win, but it extends further to that. It extends an opportunity for future drops to also have this balanced approach, as well as other communities and projects continuing to look to PV for innovation and balanced drop mechanics. While this proposed change, has the ever present opportunity for large holders of MP1’s to spread out their chances of winning multiple, it measurably expresses a greater probability for smaller holders to realize the odds they actually hold, in these independent probabilistic scenarios.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nCurrent and future core winners/holders lose potential of winning concurrently, which is a change in the original framework. This is likely to be frustrating to any that have already won, understandably, as they can no longer win multiple.\nThis could lead to a short term dip in price, but we aren’t here with that as a leading concern. \nAlternatively, large holders could move NFT’s to subvert this proposed change’s intention; I wage this is not as big of a concern after first glance (in this case). Seeing that in our case we have 72 cores left to raffle off to the community, we can manually (I’ll volunteer if needed) check transfers and validate any suspicious core wallet activity after a snapshot and remove those wallets. This solution lacks a dynamic call for future, more robust, potential use cases, but for our remaining core raffle situation it works.\n\nOutcomes:\n\nThe proposal would be deemed successful, when each of the remaining raffled cores (72) end up in the wallets of more collectors than the first half of the prized collection; that is:\ngreater than 69% (or greater than 51 winners) of newly released cores end up in diverse wallets during the raffle selection.*\n\n*This is determined from identifying staked cores and where they were transferred from, against wallets also holding cores.\nPurchases, trades, etc, not considered.\n",

The planets are eligible to claim 1 Mintpass #2 per planet, and so PVFD would be able to claim at least 6147 MP#2 (more given rewards for holding genesis set, etc.). Given the 5,902 PVFD Tokens, I would propose that each PVFD Token is allowed to claim 1 Mintpass #2. All excess MP#2 (minimum of 245) as well as any unclaimed MP#2 (would have a PVFD deadline to claim) would instead be claimed by PVFD.\n\nThis proposal would continue to bring tangible value to PVFD token holders. This is particularly important as we continue to grow the PV community, as new members contemplating joining the PVFD community want to see both short term and long term return on their investment.",

      "content": "Author: WestCoastWalker\nType: Wallet Action\nImplementer: Founder’s DAO Community Members, PVFD keyholders\nCreated: March 11, 2022\n\nSummary: After 3 days of official discussion on the forum, as well as plenty of discussion on Discord, it seems unanimous that he PVFD would like to stake our two Metaheros to generate a $POW reward for the PVFD. Our two Metaheros are; Core - Array 1 and Generative - #1\n\nAbstract: If the vote passes, the current keyholders of the PVFD will initiate the staking of our two Metaheros. This will allow us to accumulate $POW. \n\nMotivation: Our Metaheros are doing nothing sitting in our wallet. As of now, their purpose is to be staked for $POW. We should be utilizing these assets and stake them to earn roughly 50,000 in $POW rewards for the PVFD. Additionally, time is of the essence. Everyday we wait, the fewer $POW we will generate for the PVFD.\n\nSpecification: Keyholders of the PVFD will stake our Metahero’s for the remainder of the pool 1 staking period. Pool 1 will end roughly June 5, 2022. \n\nBenefits: We will earn the PVFD roughly 50,000 in $POW rewards for the remainder of the pool1 staking period.\n\nDrawbacks: n/a\n\nOutcomes: This proposal would be successful if at the end of the pool 1 staking period (June 5ish), we have generated roughly 50,000 in $POW for the PVFD.\n",
