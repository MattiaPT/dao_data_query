      "content": "# DESCRIPTION\n## TLDR;\n\nThe GLITCH art collective is organising the third edition of its art residency. It’s a 2 weeks long event gathering blockchain / AI artists and engineers, collaborating on the creation of new NFT collections inspired by the notion of CC-0 and Remix. GLITCH is a unique opportunity to build new types of public goods, past editions have led to the creation of several protocols (e.g. REMIX NFT, IMPACT NFT) as well as an open source NFT Token-Bound Licensing standard to embed Creative Commons-like licensing conditions directly into NFTs.\n\n**Total funds requested: 0.971 ETH**\n\n![GLITCH community](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=126XxNSe_cLiVf0vE7tPmRHelc9c28-dg)\n\n# GLITCH 3.0\n\n## Art residency\n\nART RESIDENCY\nGLITCH is a two-week focused residency at an 18th century chateau in France. About 40-50 participants will be invited to create, imagine, develop theories, build projects and standards aimed at supporting a new creative ecosystem of open creativity and digital abundance in the blockchain art world. The participants will be a highly curated group of creative and smart individuals actively engaged with NFTs, art, music and AI. The goal is to bring the right people, in the right place, at the right time, and then let the magic happen.\n\nAt GLITCH, we strive to empower people with ideas, visions, and expertise, while providing space for our attendees to reach deep into their minds and forge better models together. We exist to disrupt the status quo and to manifest positive solutions for society.\nThe outcomes of the residency will be, first and foremost, a tight community of value-aligned people eager to collaborate with one another, new collaborations and synergies in order to shape the world of tomorrow. The residency will also promote a variety of new initiatives about how to promote the value of openness and interoperability in the blockchain art world. Expected deliverables include new NFT protocols that encourage remix and creativity, new NFT protocols geared towards maximization of social and environmental impact, as well as a variety of collaborative exhibitions for NFT artists. All content produced within the residency will be released and made available to all under Creative Commons licenses.\n\nMore details about the third edition of GLITCH can be found at the [following link](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1xWfm3HfZJHDdlb8-7bhrVE4fWmNJDOhd)\n\n![GLITCH people](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1EHB6ZJxOhGZOb1wWWz1YobCez6UViYop)\n\n## FUNDINGS\nWe are requesting 0.971 ETH in order to support the GLITCH residency, i.e. to provide catering and accommodation for the participants\n\n## TEAM\nThe GLITCH collective is stewarded by Primavera De Filippi, Will Papper, Isaac Patka and many other amazing blockchain artists and engineers !\n\n![GLITCH people](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1LWgWO67u5aDXgF7vP5rQej8bkIDPJL1M)",

It is our belief that curated media is of major importance—now more than ever, in this environment oversaturated with information—and **it is our goal to resurface the building blocks of yesterday for the thinkers and makers of tomorrow**.\n\n**VISION**  \nThe think tank has been conducting creative research and setting up internal archives since the beginning of the year and is now ready to begin working on the first series of bi-monthly publications, aiming to release its first issue in October. Every installment will explore a topic from different angles, drawing links and parallels between the fields mentioned above, presenting research and curated media with the intent of sparking new thoughts and ideas in the reader. The format will be image-focused but may also include essays, interviews, and time-based media such as video, music, or interactive works.\n\n<source/code> editorial will be digital-first to facilitate access to as many people as possible, but there will also be a limited number of printed copies to accompany each issue.\n\n**FUNDING**  \nThe financial support that is being asked is 6 ETH, which would be enough to cover an entire year of publications, and would be used to secure the archival material that is needed, support research and curatorial efforts, design and production of the magazine, and setting up a website to keep <source/code> publications accessible to everyone.\n\n**LINKS**  \nCloud Connect: https://twitter.com/cloud___connect",

      "title": "WIDE_open v2",
      "content": "\nIntroduction and Executive Summary:\n\nWIDE_open is a cooperative driven by the mission to empower creatives through resources and opportunities. Our unique approach centers around a shared treasury as a funding mechanism and uses the network of its members as a development hub, utilizing resources and connections from members. This treasury fuels creative growth, offering support for innovative personal projects that might not align with traditional agency models. \nWIDE_open, at the core of its operation, is dedicated to developing creatives, this means giving back not just to established creatives, but also providing creative resources to underserviced communities who may not have access to creative development early on in life.\n\nHow it works:\n\nMonetarily:\nAt WIDE_open, the shared treasury is the nucleus, serving as the primary engine for project development. Projects are sourced and developed through scouting members or direct submissions via the website. For funding, projects must secure a majority vote from active members. Projects funded by the shared treasury commit to redistributing 15% to 40% of their profits back into the treasury to sustain the collective. The percentage will be decided upon by members depending upon the scale and size of the project.  Remaining true to the main tenet, percentages must be decided with the goal of creative development, and not profits, at the heart but must seek to at least grow the shared treasury to enable future projects.\n\nProject Development:\nWIDE_open extends beyond financial backing, offering comprehensive project development services. Leveraging our network of members, we provide resources such as website development, publishing contacts, distribution channels, and blockchain integration. \n\nAn exemplar scenario involves aiding a zine project: WIDE_open connects the artist with a suitable publishing house, offers funding, and a portion of the project’s profits replenish the shared treasury.\n\nContributing to Underserved Communities:\n\nAn annual commitment of 5% of the shared treasury’s funds is dedicated to underserved communities. This percentage is subject to change and growth depending on yearly finances and will be open to a vote once a year. This allocation underscores WIDE_open’s unwavering commitment to fostering inclusivity and positive social impact through creativity. The co-operative will also use its network to provide mentorship and educational initiatives, equipping aspiring artists from underserved backgrounds with the skills, resources, and support they need to pursue creative careers free of charge.\n\nGovernance and Decision-making:\nOperating democratically, WIDE_open works collective input. Regular meetings facilitate discussions on strategy, revenue allocation, project funding, and other key matters. All decisions concerning WIDE_open’s operations, strategies, and initiatives are made collectively by the members through majority vote. This democratic structure ensures that every member’s voice contributes to the cooperative’s core tenet of placing creative development at the heart of all. The founding member Jonathan Frydman, he will look to invite Ennntropy ecosystem players as their first members, such as but not limited to Jay Islate, Cedric Payne, Ignacio Reveredo & Yatù Espinosa.\n\nMembership Criteria:\n\nMembership is granted through direct invitation to artists with proven excellence, endorsed by members or leadership. Each new member must be approved by a super-majority vote.\n\n\tMembership Benefits and Creative Agency Collaboration:\n\tWIDE_open members enjoy a range of privileges:\n\n\t•\tVoting Rights: Members shape the cooperative’s direction by participating in decision-making processes. All members have the same amount of votes (1).\n\t•\tDirect Project Introduction: Members can propose projects directly, tapping into the shared \ttreasury for financial backing and support.\n\t•\tInvitations: Members have the power to invite other artists, expanding our community of \t\t\texceptional talent.\n\t•\tCreative Agency Collaboration: Our network, cultivated through project scouting, serves as a creative agency resource. Members can tap into this network to use WIDE_open as a creative agency to help them work for commercial clients.  Engaging the cooperative as a creative agency follows a balanced 5-5-5% revenue distribution, as listed below.\n\nImplementation: Synergy of Artistic Exploration and Creative Agency Collaboration\n\nShared Treasury\n\nStep 1 - Empowering Personal Explorations:\n\nOur central focus is nurturing individual projects. By providing finances and other resources we aim to grow creatives’ career potential. At first, these projects will be scouted by members, specifically Jonathan Frydman, and brought forward to the board of members. It is vital in these first projects to find artists that have untapped potential and will benefit greatly from WIDE_open’s platform as well as help grow funding in the shared treasury. We will also be looking at opening a website to accept personal project proposals.\n\nStep 2- Introduction of Project\n\nFollowing the introduction of a potential project, members will work to shape a contract and plan of action in line with WIDE_open’s ideals. This part can be spearheaded by any member but must be accepted by a majority of members. During this time a suitable business plan with a look at potential earnings & costs must be developed and presented to all members for a vote.\n\nStep 3- Voting\n\nOnce a business plan, with a plan of action is drawn up. All members must vote on it. Abstention votes will not count.\n\nCreative Agency Integration:\n\nStep 1- WIDE_open as a creative agency\n\nHarnessing the collective’s network and funds, members may leverage the cooperative as a creative agency if they so wish. Drawing from our scouting process, a diverse talent pool, and industry connections developed within the treasury, members may use the collective to develop projects for commercial clients. In this scenario, the goal is not to use the shared treasury but rather leverage the cooperative to execute contracts for clients who turn a profit.\n\nStep 2 - Revenue Distribution:\nEngaging the cooperative as a creative agency follows a balanced 5–5-5% revenue distribution:\n\n\t•\t5% finder’s fee for securing the project.\n\t•\t5% strengthens the shared treasury for future artistic ventures.\n\t•\t5% contributes to underserved communities, reflecting inclusivity and impact.\n\nUnderserved Community Outreach:\n\nStep 1 : Finding the right communities.\n\nConduct thorough research to identify the specific underserved communities you intend to engage with. Consider factors such as demographics, location, and the unique challenges faced by each community. This research will help tailor your outreach efforts to meet the needs of the target audience effectively. Once found, a vote must be held to move forward on selected community.\n\nStep 2: Develop Outreach Initiatives\n\nDesign outreach initiatives that align with the identified needs of the target communities and budget available to WIDE_open. These initiatives could include:\n\n\t•\tWorkshops and Classes: Offer free or affordable workshops on various creative skills, such as painting, photography, writing, or digital design.\n\t•\tMentorship Programs: Pair aspiring artists from underserved backgrounds with experienced mentors who can provide guidance and support.\n\t•\tArt Exhibitions and Shows: Organize art exhibitions and cultural events in collaboration with the target communities to showcase their creativity.\n\t•\tCreative Tool Distribution: Provide art supplies, software, or tools that enable individuals to express themselves creatively.\n\nA vote must be held once an outreach initiative is determined\n\nStep 3: Measure and Evaluate Impact\n\nRegularly assess the impact of your initiatives. Collect data on participation rates, skills acquired, changes in confidence, and overall satisfaction. Use both quantitative and qualitative data to understand the program’s effectiveness and make improvements.\n\nStep 4: Adapt and Improve\n\nBased on the collected data and feedback, adapt your initiatives to better meet the needs and preferences of the target communities. Continuously refine your approach to ensure maximum impact and meaningful engagement.\n\nBy following these steps, WIDE_open can establish a community outreach program that not only empowers underserved communities through creativity but also strengthens the cooperative’s reputation as an agent of positive change.\n\n\n*The cooperative recognizes that the creative landscape is dynamic and constantly evolving. As such, WIDE_open is open to significant changes should the majority of members vote for them. This approach ensures that the cooperative remains relevant and responsive to emerging opportunities and challenges.\n\n*All on-chain sales would go back to the Entropy DAO, subject to artist’s decisions.\n\nUse Case Scenarios and 1st projects\n\nZine with Kristie Mueller: Youth AAU Tournaments, June 2024\nWIDE_open will look as its first project to work with photographer, Kristie Mueller on a zine project that delves into the world of Youth AAU tournaments. The zine will be shot during the month of July 2024, giving WIDE_open the time to work with publishing houses and stockists to find the best fit for the the zine, monetarily and culturally. July 2024 allows Kristie Mueller the perfect opportunity to capture the height of AAU basketball: the July 2024 Nike EYBL tournament. The goal is to bring a fresh look to an already hyper stylized sport & use the fanbases of both Kristie Mueller (with over 15k followers) & AAU basketball (which generates millions of views daily on social). PDFs of the book would also go unchain and a percentage of sales would go back to Entropy DAO, subject to Kristie Mueller’s discretion.\nBudget Allocation:\n* Travel: A budget of $3,000 has been allocated for travel expenses, ensuring that Kristie can attend the tournaments and capture the raw moments and emotions of the event.\n* Bookmaking & Editing: $2,000 has been set aside for the creation of the zine. This includes costs related to bookmaking, editing, and ensuring that the final product is of the highest quality.\n* Marketing & Additional Services: An additional $2,000 will be used for marketing efforts, including hiring a publicist to promote the zine. This budget also covers additional services like a photo assistant to aid Kristie during the tournaments.\nSales and Revenue:\nThe zine will have a limited print run of approximately 300 copies. The exact number will be determined based on stockists' availabilities. Each copy will be sold at an estimated price of $50, leading to a potential gross income of $15,000.\nRevenue Distribution:\nFrom the gross income:\n* $7,000 will be returned to WIDE_open's shared treasury to fund future projects.\n* An additional 30% of the income, which amounts to $2,400 will also be channeled back to WIDE_open.\n* The remaining profit, totaling $5,600, will be for Kristie Mueller.\n\n\nMerch Drop with Amalcrossing: An Exploration into Replicable Use Cases\nWIDE_open is thrilled to partner with Amalcrossing for a unique merch drop that serves as an exploration into a model that can be easily replicated for future collaborations. This venture leverages our established connections with manufacturers and our expansive distribution network, especially on platforms like Twitter, through partners such as tshiiiiirts and ethereal. The primary goal is to create a sustainable revenue stream for both the artists and WIDE_open, ensuring mutual growth and success.\nBudget and Production:\n* Production Costs: The costs associated with the design, manufacturing, and quality assurance of the shirts are estimated at $2,000. This ensures that each piece of merchandise meets the high standards expected by our audience and represents the artistic vision of Amalcrossing.\nSales and Revenue:\n* Pricing and Quantity: A limited run of 100 shirts will be produced, each priced at $30. This sets the potential gross income at $3,000 from shirt sales alone.\n* Revenue Distribution: From the gross income, WIDE_open and Amalcrossing have agreed on a revenue-sharing model where WIDE_open would receive between 30-40% of the gross income. The initial proceeds would go to Amalcrossing, ensuring the artist's efforts and creativity are duly rewarded. The remaining revenue, after covering production costs, will be split according to the agreed-upon percentages, contributing to the shared treasury of WIDE_open and furthering our mission of supporting and empowering creatives.\nFuture Collaborations:\nBuilding on the success and learnings from our collaboration with Amalcrossing, WIDE_open is already eyeing future partnerships with other talented artists. Artists such as Frank Dorrey, Audemonciklar, and Afro S8nt have been identified as the next potential candidates for similar merch drops.

      "title": "Pollen Storefront",
      "content": "Pollen Storefront (Agora)\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn recent years, the dynamic concept of popup storefronts has emerged as a powerful platform for expressing innovative ideas, nurturing intellectual exploration, and facilitating the dissemination of creative and intellectual endeavors. The transient nature of pop-ups has proven invaluable for burgeoning brands and collectives with limited resources, offering an opportunity to showcase their offerings without the commitment of permanent spaces. However, the financial burden associated with extended rentals and maintenance remains a challenge, particularly for long-term endeavors. Moreover, a pressing need persists for artists, creators, and cultural visionaries to have a tangible outlet for showcasing and sharing their physical work. This proposal seeks to establish Agora, a physical space aimed at supporting, incubating, and amplifying the efforts of artists, designers, technologists, researchers, and creatives within our vibrant community.\n\nVision and Objectives\n\nPollen envisions a communal hub where artists, technologists, and researchers converge to share ideas and cross-pollinate their talents. Our objectives include:\n\nAffordable Access: Offering a three-month popup storefront, reducing financial burden while maximizing exposure.\nCollaborative Synergy: Curated installations, workshops, and events will foster interaction and inspire creativity.\nCommunity Engagement: Beyond physical boundaries, the initiative will engage locals through interactive experiences, workshops, and discussions.\nDiverse Showcase: A carefully curated mix of items will celebrate various artistic, intellectual, and technological expressions.\n\nWhy Support Us?\n\nThe creative community requires spaces that amplify their work. Financial constraints often hinder talented individuals from showcasing their creations. The Agora aims to address this challenge, ensuring that artists can distribute their work physically without the pressure of long-term costs.\n\nTo materialize our vision, we seek 20 ETH in funding. This capital will cover:\n\nSpace Costs: Rental, setup, and maintenance of the storefront.\nEvent Funding: Organizing curated events, workshops, and discussions.\nOnline Presence: Establishing a virtual extension to reach a global audience.\n\nRoadmap:\nSecure storefront location, initiate curation process, and plan event lineup.\nComplete setup, finalize curation, and launch the physical store.\nCurated events and workshops, community engagement initiatives.\nCreate online shop to work with physical store, expanding reach and sustaining engagement.\n\nRelevant links:\n\n\nPollen -  https://twitter.com/pppollen, Cedric Payne, https://twitter.com/CedricPayne,  will be assisting with curation and production.\n",

      "title": "WIDE_open",
      "content": "WIDE_open, a new way to fund creatives\n\nIntroduction and Executive Summary:\n\nWIDE_open is a cooperative driven by the mission to empower creatives through resources and opportunities. Our unique approach centers around a shared treasury as a funding mechanism and uses the network of its members as a development hub, utilizing resources and connections from members. This treasury fuels creative growth, offering support for innovative personal projects that might not align with traditional agency models. \nWIDE_open, at the core of its operation, is dedicated to developing creatives, this means giving back not just to established creatives, but also providing creative resources to underserviced communities who may not have access to creative development early on in life.\n\nHow it works:\n\nMonetarily:\nAt WIDE_open, the shared treasury is the nucleus, serving as the primary engine for project development. Projects are sourced and developed through scouting members or direct submissions via the website. For funding, projects must secure a majority vote from active members. Projects funded by the shared treasury commit to redistributing 15% to 40% of their profits back into the treasury to sustain the collective. The percentage will be decided upon by members depending upon the scale and size of the project.  Remaining true to the main tenet, percentages must be decided with the goal of creative development, and not profits, at the heart but must seek to at least grow the shared treasury to enable future projects.\n\nProject Development:\nWIDE_open extends beyond financial backing, offering comprehensive project development services. Leveraging our network of members, we provide resources such as website development, publishing contacts, distribution channels, and blockchain integration. \n\nAn exemplar scenario involves aiding a zine project: WIDE_open connects the artist with a suitable publishing house, offers funding, and a portion of the project’s profits replenish the shared treasury.\n\nContributing to Underserved Communities:\n\nAn annual commitment of 5% of the shared treasury’s funds is dedicated to underserved communities. This percentage is subject to change and growth depending on yearly finances and will be open to a vote once a year. This allocation underscores WIDE_open’s unwavering commitment to fostering inclusivity and positive social impact through creativity. The co-operative will also use its network to provide mentorship and educational initiatives, equipping aspiring artists from underserved backgrounds with the skills, resources, and support they need to pursue creative careers free of charge.\n\nGovernance and Decision-making:\nOperating democratically, WIDE_open works collective input. Regular meetings facilitate discussions on strategy, revenue allocation, project funding, and other key matters. All decisions concerning WIDE_open’s operations, strategies, and initiatives are made collectively by the members through majority vote. This democratic structure ensures that every member’s voice contributes to the cooperative’s core tenet of placing creative development at the heart of all. The founding member Jonathan Frydman, he will look to invite Ennntropy ecosystem players as their first members, such as but not limited to Jay Islate, Cedric Payne, Ignacio Reveredo & Yatù Espinosa.\n\nMembership Criteria:\n\nMembership is granted through direct invitation to artists with proven excellence, endorsed by members or leadership. Each new member must be approved by a super-majority vote.\n\n\tMembership Benefits and Creative Agency Collaboration:\n\tWIDE_open members enjoy a range of privileges:\n\n\t•\tVoting Rights: Members shape the cooperative’s direction by participating in decision-making processes. All members have the same amount of votes (1).\n\t•\tDirect Project Introduction: Members can propose projects directly, tapping into the shared \ttreasury for financial backing and support.\n\t•\tInvitations: Members have the power to invite other artists, expanding our community of \t\t\texceptional talent.\n\t•\tCreative Agency Collaboration: Our network, cultivated through project scouting, serves as a creative agency resource. Members can tap into this network to use WIDE_open as a creative agency to help them work for commercial clients.  Engaging the cooperative as a creative agency follows a balanced 5-5-5% revenue distribution, as listed below.\n\nImplementation: Synergy of Artistic Exploration and Creative Agency Collaboration\n\nShared Treasury\n\nStep 1 - Empowering Personal Explorations:\n\nOur central focus is nurturing individual projects. By providing finances and other resources we aim to grow creatives’ career potential. At first, these projects will be scouted by members, specifically Jonathan Frydman, and brought forward to the board of members. It is vital in these first projects to find artists that have untapped potential and will benefit greatly from WIDE_open’s platform as well as help grow funding in the shared treasury. We will also be looking at opening a website to accept personal project proposals.\n\nStep 2- Introduction of Project\n\nFollowing the introduction of a potential project, members will work to shape a contract and plan of action in line with WIDE_open’s ideals. This part can be spearheaded by any member but must be accepted by a majority of members. During this time a suitable business plan with a look at potential earnings & costs must be developed and presented to all members for a vote.\n\nStep 3- Voting\n\nOnce a business plan, with a plan of action is drawn up. All members must vote on it. Abstention votes will not count.\n\nCreative Agency Integration:\n\nStep 1- WIDE_open as a creative agency\n\nHarnessing the collective’s network and funds, members may leverage the cooperative as a creative agency if they so wish. Drawing from our scouting process, a diverse talent pool, and industry connections developed within the treasury, members may use the collective to develop projects for commercial clients. In this scenario, the goal is not to use the shared treasury but rather leverage the cooperative to execute contracts for clients who turn a profit.\n\nStep 2 - Revenue Distribution:\nEngaging the cooperative as a creative agency follows a balanced 5–5-5% revenue distribution:\n\n\t•\t5% finder’s fee for securing the project.\n\t•\t5% strengthens the shared treasury for future artistic ventures.\n\t•\t5% contributes to underserved communities, reflecting inclusivity and impact.\n\nUnderserved Community Outreach:\n\nStep 1 : Finding the right communities.\n\nConduct thorough research to identify the specific underserved communities you intend to engage with. Consider factors such as demographics, location, and the unique challenges faced by each community. This research will help tailor your outreach efforts to meet the needs of the target audience effectively. Once found, a vote must be held to move forward on selected community.\n\nStep 2: Develop Outreach Initiatives\n\nDesign outreach initiatives that align with the identified needs of the target communities and budget available to WIDE_open. These initiatives could include:\n\n\t•\tWorkshops and Classes: Offer free or affordable workshops on various creative skills, such as painting, photography, writing, or digital design.\n\t•\tMentorship Programs: Pair aspiring artists from underserved backgrounds with experienced mentors who can provide guidance and support.\n\t•\tArt Exhibitions and Shows: Organize art exhibitions and cultural events in collaboration with the target communities to showcase their creativity.\n\t•\tCreative Tool Distribution: Provide art supplies, software, or tools that enable individuals to express themselves creatively.\n\nA vote must be held once an outreach initiative is determined\n\nStep 3: Measure and Evaluate Impact\n\nRegularly assess the impact of your initiatives. Collect data on participation rates, skills acquired, changes in confidence, and overall satisfaction. Use both quantitative and qualitative data to understand the program’s effectiveness and make improvements.\n\nStep 4: Adapt and Improve\n\nBased on the collected data and feedback, adapt your initiatives to better meet the needs and preferences of the target communities. Continuously refine your approach to ensure maximum impact and meaningful engagement.\n\nBy following these steps, WIDE_open can establish a community outreach program that not only empowers underserved communities through creativity but also strengthens the cooperative’s reputation as an agent of positive change.\n\nGuiding values\n\nSynergy of Artistic Exploration and Positive Impact:\n\nBy embracing the principles of dual financial streams, nurturing cooperative unity, empowering underserved communities, and being open to evolution and innovation, WIDE_open embodies a holistic and dynamic approach to fostering creativity, collaboration, and positive impact within the artistic realm.\n\nDual Financial Streams:\nWIDE_open’s commitment to dual financial streams is fundamental to its sustainable growth and the empowerment of artists. This principle encompasses two vital aspects:\n\n\t1.\tShared Treasury Resilience: The shared treasury stands as the cooperative’s lifeline, driving innovation and supporting creative projects. Contributions from successful endeavors replenish the treasury, securing resources for upcoming initiatives. This financial continuity ensures that WIDE_open remains a reliable source of support for artists’ visions.\n\t2.\tEmpowerment through Commercial Collaboration: By engaging with commercial clients as a creative agency, WIDE_open generates additional revenue streams. This dual approach not only strengthens the shared treasury but also empowers members to showcase their skills in the commercial arena, fostering personal growth and cooperative sustainability.\n\nNurturing Cooperative Unity & Growth:\nThe essence of WIDE_open lies in its commitment to fostering unity and collaboration among its members. This core tenet is exemplified through several key principles:\n\n\t1.\tInclusive Decision-Making: WIDE_open ensures that every member’s voice is heard and valued. Decisions concerning project funding, strategies, and resource allocation are collectively made through a majority vote. This inclusive approach guarantees that the cooperative’s trajectory is shaped collectively, representing the diverse perspectives of its members.\n\t2. \tTransparency and Accountability: Sustaining unity relies on transparency and accountability. WIDE_open upholds these values by consistently sharing updates, progress reports, and financial statements. This open communication fosters trust and ensures that every member is well-informed about the cooperative’s operations and impact.\n\n\t3.\tFlexibility for Change: The cooperative recognizes that the creative landscape is dynamic and constantly evolving. As such, WIDE_open is open to significant changes should the majority of members vote for them. This approach ensures that the cooperative remains relevant and responsive to emerging opportunities and challenges.\n\n\t4.\tCollective Ownership: Members actively contribute to shaping the cooperative’s evolution. Proposals for significant changes, improvements, or new initiatives are subject to member voting. This collective ownership empowers every member to play a role in defining the cooperative’s future trajectory.\n\n\nEmpowering Underserved Communities:\nWIDE_open’s dedication to underserved communities embodies a core value of social responsibility and inclusivity. This commitment involves:\n\n\t1.\tEquitable Allocation: The cooperative allocates an annual 5% of its shared treasury funds to support underserved communities. This allocation is subject to a yearly vote, ensuring flexibility and responsiveness to evolving needs.\n\t2.\tCommunity-Centric Initiatives: WIDE_open collaborates with non-profit organizations, educational institutions, and community groups to design transformative art projects. These initiatives engage, inspire, and empower marginalized communities, aiming to bridge gaps and spark positive change.\n\t3.\tMentorship and Education: WIDE_open invests in mentorship and educational programs, providing aspiring artists from underserved backgrounds with the necessary skills, resources, and guidance to pursue creative careers. This support aims to break down barriers and create opportunities for personal and professional growth.\n\t4.\tAdvocacy and Impact: Beyond financial support, WIDE_open uses its platform to advocate for diversity, inclusion, and representation within the creative industry. Through awareness campaigns the cooperative strives to foster positive change on a broader scale.\n\nInitial Funding:\n\n\t•\tInitial Treasury Fund: $20,000 This fund will serve as the initial capital for the shared treasury, providing members with the resources needed to kickstart their personal projects. 2,000$ is allocated for a first year backup fund for any development needed for WIDE_open’s first year. Following that the money will be transitioned into the treasury fund.\n\t•\tPersonnel Costs: $15,000  This will cover the salaries for all initial workers and employees of WIDE_open, this will only happen during the first stage, afterwards the co-operative will require less staff & gain funding for salaried positions from the shared treasury if necessary upon member votes. Within this is also money all. This will cover the initial business expenses, including website development, marketing, and other operational costs.\n\t•\tLegal Fees & Administration: $1,500. These costs will cover the legal and administrative expenses associated with setting up the cooperative, including registration fees, legal consultation, and other necessary paperwork.\n\t•\tInitial Community Outreach: $3,500. This budget will be allocated to our community outreach program, which aims to provide creative tools and opportunities to underserved communities\n\t\nTotal:\n\n\t40,000 USD or 22 ETH\n\nConclusion:\n\nWIDE_open's unique approach, anchored in a shared treasury, democratic decision-making, and an unwavering commitment to creative development, reflects our collective vision for a more inclusive and vibrant creative landscape. The journey ahead is guided by our core tenets, where dual financial streams support both personal explorations and collaborative agency projects. Strength through democracy, whether on individual paths or agency collaborations, will drive our decision-making, ensuring that every voice contributes to shaping our cooperative's trajectory.",

      "title": "Terminal Reatreat",
      "content": "\n**Abstract**\n\nThere is a new meta being built today around these four core pillars that will enable the next decade of internet / post-internet technologies: hardware, ethereum/crypto, artificial intelligence, and spatial. \n\nAnd, in the least shocking turn of events, the youth are at the forefront of many of these fields. How do we platform and empower these voices? How do we bring capital resources into the fold through shared vision, instead of a \"you don't know\" style of communication that negs the resources into our accounts. \n\nThe retreat format is inherently different from a conference. There's a sense of intimacy, ideas being shared, potential for collaboration... what could the young technologist \"Sun Valley\" look like. \n\n**Proposal**\n\nTerminal Retreat will gather founders and builders in these fields to a large residence in Utah I've already secured. They will spend a long weekend (3-4 days) here to share their work, as well as co-produce thought together. \n\nThe residence is equipped with a home theatre. Several family rooms and game rooms. And of course plenty of bedrooms to host, 20-30 people, depending on how close people don't mind being. \n\nThis will be a highly highly curated event.\nSome sessions will be recorded, others completely off the record. \nAll of it will drive a much needed intimacy across disciplines & people. \n\n**Why do we need Entropy Funding**\n\nThe only thing I want founders to worry about is getting there.\n\nFood, recording equipment / support, and the rest should be handled in order to produce a freeing psychological environment that allows for free flowing thought. \n\nAdditionally, I believe there are people that will need support\n\n**Next Steps**\n\nIf this gets approved I'd be spending most of my time curating and planning programming. This is something I'm uniquely capable of doing. And I believe my personal track record of talks, work with Eternal, relationship with founders and investors, community building with Tweetups/Terminal -> all proves this point. \n\n**Relevant Links To Support My Ability To Do This**\n\nhttps://hipcityreg.substack.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/HipCityReg\nhttps://www.instagram.com/eternaltilidie/\n",

Online radio has held together subcultures during times of global crisis through independent stations such as NTS, Lot Radio, and Rinse FM to name a few. \n\nThe medium has been inaccessible to many people due to gatekeeping, and expensive and clunky hardware and software. **Evenings’ north star is to democratize high-quality audio broadcasting, giving anyone the tools to start their own station.**\n\nWe’ve built a prototype for the most portable tool for broadcasting and recording high-quality audio from any source and a web app for managing and distributing audio. We’re looking for support from the Entropy Dao to manufacture the first batch of Evenings hardware. \n\n**EVENINGS Roadmap follows: **\n- Onboard internet radio stations to EVENINGS.FM (ensure that our broadcasting service is stable)\n- Scale up Evenings broadcasting infrastructure to support more listeners\n- Release our first small batch of hardware to stations on EVENINGS.FM \n- Get feedback on the first batch, refine, produce, and release to the public \n\n**Why we need Entropy’s support:**\nWe’ll need Entropy’s support to fund the production of our first hardware batch. We’re asking for 20 ETH. Production will include: \n- 10 ETH for PCB manufacturing \n- 6 ETH for enclosure manufacturing \n- 4 ETH for packaging and shipping \n\n**Bill of Materials:**\n[EVENINGS HARDWARE PCB Bill of Materials ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G-_3s_JxTmnR4T0R4bT6wLhxJOtZaBFo5NVWmQBd--k/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nRelevant links:\n[https://evenings.fm](https://evenings.fm)\n[https://www.instagram.com/eveningsfm](https://www.instagram.com/eveningsfm/)\n[https://twitter.com/EVENINGSFM ](https://twitter.com/EVENINGSFM)\n[https://www.are.na/evenings ](https://www.are.na/evenings)\n[https://www.are.na/share/pNGIbBJ ](https://www.are.na/share/pNGIbBJ)",

We see the way to get it lies on the chain.\n  \n⬜️\n\n**Why onchain?**\n  \n⬜️\n\nEntropy is an organization that is advancing the Internet. It attracts people because it has a narrative, values that are reflected in every image we see in the feed.\n  \n⬜️\n\nPeople mint stories. That is what we actually see when we observe onchain social feeds. Every NFT is an artifact created within a seamless narrative. It is a part of the world that proceeds and complements the whole story simultaneously, developing the observer’s journey into the depth of the storyline. Moreover, artifacts are eternal things. Each of them will exist long after our time comes.\n  \n⬜️\n\nOnchain provides novel approaches to distributing cultures, as NFTs are one of the most powerful tools of storytelling. The more people see artifacts and their mints, the more people will learn about Entropy as an Internet home.\n  \n⬜️\n\nSo, how can we engage as many internet strangers as possible with Entropy’s artifacts?\n \n⬜️\n\n**How to make Entropy go viral onchain?**\n \n⬜️\n\nEntropy is Entropy because pictures go viral online, and their flaw is endless.

This approach is the main approach for Entropy online, but can we transfer it to onchain, considering all the peculiarities of the decentralized internet?\n  \n⬜️\n\nOne of Entropy’s last collections did go viral. Was it a coincidence? The mint was random, so we don’t have an answer, just more questions.\n \n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreidjouxnscswgusreygxjs5tchztwvn33gkt36enngkp3skhnyfqdi)\n \nWe want to think that this case was a proof that Entropy’s approach can work onchain: we flood the space with artifacts (NFTs), and some of them will take off.\n  \n⬜️\n\n**What is onchain virality?** We don’t know the numbers, as they are not stable. We tend to think that it starts from 5,000 mints. Also, we think that every artifact we offer to mint should cost $1.\n  \n⬜️\n\nIf an artifact reaches 10,000 mints, we could earn $10,000. People are already willing to pay for gas fees, so adding an extra dollar won’t be a big deal for them. This way, we can generate income from every image and use it to benefit our community. If it works, it opens limitless monetization opportunities for Entropy.\n  \n⬜️\n\n90% of the profits from 10,000 mints will go back to treasury and the curator. This is straight reinvestment towards producing more artifacts and enhancing the creative vision of the Entropy universe. It’s a win-win for both the community and the organization\n  \n⬜️\n\nSo, the question is how to make Entropy go viral onchain constantly? What are the practices of breaking through the mainstream barrier? What should we mint every day?\n  \n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeidrpsgcdreuumkaja3rwz3wabdl7p2sycuytdqfchcf4hhe5mzzvi)\n OEs are changing the paradigm of collecting onchain artifacts\n   \n⬜️\n\nThe path to the answers lies in experiments. Different open editions, different types of content, different results to find the one that will explode onchain space. We want to build a tool that will allow us to practice regular artifact producing powered by Entropy’s community. Having developed this practice, we will be able to test different hypothesis and approaches towards onchain virality.\n  \n⬜️\n\n**Artifact Builder**\n  \n⬜️\n\nCreation should be a fun activity for everyone who is willing to collaborate. A process that brings joy is always more efficient and productive.\n  \n⬜️\n\nWe will create a Figma playground for all core curators consisting of Entropy’s signature marks, patterns, fonts, and graphic elements. It will offer quick artifact creation, as the curators won’t have to worry about toolkits and their usage - all components are already designed. Speed is crucial for rapid hypothesis testing. We will also constantly look for new artists to supplement the collection of graphic elements to make artifacts more diverse and viral.\n  \n⬜️\n\nThe Artifact Builder will not only be a tool but also an open space where every contributor can design an artifact according to their personal Entropy feeling, whether it’s a self-assembled visualization from scratch or made from an exciting picture with Entropy’s logo image.\n  \n⬜️\n\nInitially, we plan to launch a beta mode working only with core curators who possess the Entropy DAO Token. Since the community is highly creative, we can test all our hypotheses without requiring external artists. If our efforts are successful and generate revenue, the rewards will go directly to the community.\n  \n⬜️\n  \nIf successful, in future iterations, the playground will be developed into a full-featured platform, making artifact creation an automated practice.\n  \n⬜️\n \n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeigyuumcgflgfdcwkjs5y5bcyd6afjlrb6uuhakl3keugwl4ywptkm)\n Examples of artifacts that can be created with Artifact Builder\n \n⬜️\n\nHere’s how it works, step by step:\n1. A curator goes to the Figma playground and assembles an artifact.\n2. Once the artifact is ready, the curator sends it to Entropy to create an open edition (this step will eliminate the need for the curator to pay gas fees) and immutable split. Recipients are Entropy, the curator, and Artifact Builder.\n3. We add the split’s address to the open edition’s pay-off, which will automatically divide any generated revenues.\n  \n⬜️\n\nEverything is simple. If the artifact goes viral, the curator receives the money from the split to spend on a new laptop or phone, and Entropy’s treasury is replenished. Replenishment itself will lead to further reinvestments into the organization.\nThis speculation is positive-sum: if you win, many others might, and the whole community will have progressed as a result.\n  \n⬜️\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeibo57s4uabpvm3rpsd43urramyh4jgo3bh4u7rjwndrqah6kauia4)\n Example of what an artifact mint page might look like\n  \n⬜️\n\nThe strategy and all future strategies can be tested and refined through the Artifact Builder tool, allowing Entropy to experiment with different approaches towards onchain virality. With the right combination of creativity, experimentation, and collaboration, *Entropy has the potential to rapidly emerge as a top NFT producer*.\n  \n⬜️\n\n**What will be received at the conclusion of the trial (one month)?**\n  \n⬜️\n\nWe plan to test about 10-20 content hypotheses based on Artifact Builder.\n  \n⬜️\n  \nIn any case:\n1. The constructed Artifact Builder - a playground with a standardized set of components that will help the curators to easily create artifacts while ensuring consistency and ease of use.\n 2. Onchain infrastructure (splits, multisigs) that can be reused between members of the community as many times as needed without creating a new one.\n3. The collective experience of co-creation. Things that are made together always play a more valuable role in consciousness. The process of “artifact making” creates a connection between DAO members and ensures the community’s formation as it engenders collective memories shaping. It’s what really matters: the more memories we have, the more connected to “us” we feel.\n4. Documented metadata to keep conducting such kind of experiments that will help avoid repeating past mistakes and build upon previous successes.\n\nIf successful:\n1. A source of ongoing funding that will support all of Entropy’s curators who design artifacts. It will allow contributors to devote more time to expanding Entropy’s Universe.\n2. Knowledge of the mechanisms of onchain virality - a practice we can reuse as many times as needed to distribute other artifacts and replenish DAO’s treasury.\nThere is the nerd page which explains all technical and bureaucratic details: [the nerd page](https://www.notion.so/the-nerd-page-f9e945757db5426596afcd9026ef3c1f).\n   \n⬜️\n \nWhat will we do in the very near future (within 2 weeks)?  \n\n1. Create a hub with all willing DAO members: for constant work side by side with them\n2.

We aim to empower the community and create an opportunity to keep pursuing our passions, giving this universe as much time as one wants. We see the way to get it lies on the chain.\n  \n⬜️\n\n**Why onchain?**\n  \n⬜️\n\nEntropy is an organization that is advancing the Internet. It attracts people because it has a narrative, values that are reflected in every image we see in the feed.\n  \n⬜️\n\nPeople mint stories. That is what we actually see when we observe onchain social feeds. Every NFT is an artifact created within a seamless narrative. It is a part of the world that proceeds and complements the whole story simultaneously, developing the observer’s journey into the depth of the storyline. Moreover, artifacts are eternal things. Each of them will exist long after our time comes.\n  \n⬜️\n\nOnchain provides novel approaches to distributing cultures, as NFTs are one of the most powerful tools of storytelling. The more people see artifacts and their mints, the more people will learn about Entropy as an Internet home.\n  \n⬜️\n\nSo, how can we engage as many internet strangers as possible with Entropy’s artifacts?\n \n⬜️\n\n**How to make Entropy go viral onchain?**\n \n⬜️\n\nEntropy is Entropy because pictures go viral online, and their flaw is endless.

With this new update, this proposal suggest we airdrop Governance Tokens to some of the earliest and most invested curators.\n\n**WHY:**  We(Entropy) are at a point where we can actually start funding incredible experiments, artists, hardware, and anything else we can dream of.  Our curators have helped get us to this point and create the reputation Entropy has.  By retro-actively rewarding these curators we show that Entropy is owned and built by the people who believe in it.  Through airdrop we can recognize that work is more important than capital in regards to joining Entropy.  This also allows us to have the incredible taste, vision, and ethos of each curator involved in the decision making process of future proposals.\n\nWe are setting the foundation for artist, curator, and collector fueled futures.\n\n**HOW:** The top 10 entropy scores of all time were used to determine entropy power users/supporters who will receive the airdrop\n\n**WHO:** \n![image](https://ipfs.zora.co/ipfs/bafkreicgbyqzzz2o6emdjlm3avzbm4uhch42sjv34lhx7f56jyoewnmpzi)",

      "content": "<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/HrQKZMG.png\"></p><h2><br></h2><h2>Summary</h2><p>This proposal upgrades the DAO to V1.1 to add the following features, improvements and bug fixes.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Updatable Founder Shares</h3><p>DAOs will now be able to propose changes to founders shares. This gives DAOs the ability to add, modify and remove founders shares via proposal.</p><p>With this new feature DAO creators will have the ability to modify any errors that may have been caused at DAO deployment.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Upgrade Visibility</h3><p>In V1.1, each smart contract of a DAO now has an explicit version attached. This means that members and developers will be able easily understand which protocol implementation a DAO is utilizing at any given time.</p><p>This will also make it easier for future upgrades that are in development: including <em>airdrops</em> and <em>custom metadata renderers</em>.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Proposal Spam Fix</h3><p>Proposal submission to a DAO has an incorrectly implemented check which can allow for spam proposals to be submitted to a DAO. In V1.1 it works as expected.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Auction Improvements</h3><p>Improved bid handling and edge case management in the Auction House contracts.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Author</h3><p>This upgrade has been developed and proposed by <strong>Zora</strong> (<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xd1d1d4e36117ab794ec5d4c78cbd3a8904e691d0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 122, 183); background-color: transparent;\">zora.eth</a>)</p>",
