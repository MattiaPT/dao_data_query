      "title": "Grant Proposal IRL Africa: Transforming Live Music Experiences with Blockchain",
      "content": "IRL Africa seeks to reshape the live event experience through the integration of blockchain technology, inclusivity, and sustainability. Our goal is to make live music more accessible across Africa, allowing artists to perform and communities to enjoy music while utilizing decentralized tools such as Unlock Protocol for ticketing, fan engagement, and monetization. This proposal outlines our mission, objectives, implementation plan, and the framework to scale across multiple cities in Africa.\n\nMission\n\nTo make live music events sustainable and accessible across Africa using free concerts, blockchain-based tools, and community-driven approaches.\n\nVision\n\nWe aim to build an inclusive platform for African artists to showcase their talents, while communities across the continent enjoy live music through decentralized and sustainable means. By integrating cutting-edge technology, we envision a global expansion where African music transcends borders through blockchain innovation.\n\n\n---\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Artist Empowerment: Provide fair payment structures and global exposure for African artists by utilizing blockchain for ticketing, fan engagement, and revenue generation.\n\n\n2. Community Participation: Enable communities to curate, fund, and engage with live music performances through decentralized mechanisms. Fans can be part of the event planning process and directly influence concert selections using blockchain technology.\n\n\n3. Blockchain Education: Introduce both artists and fans to blockchain tools (Unlock Protocol, Base), showing how these tools can solve real-world challenges in the music industry such as ticket fraud, artist compensation, and fan engagement.\n\n\n4. Onboarding Untapped Markets: Focus on onboarding communities like Harare into the Web3 ecosystem, creating new opportunities in regions that are ripe for blockchain disruption.\n\n\n5. Sustainability and Inclusivity: Promote a sustainable concert model that can scale across Africa, using decentralized methods for funding and audience engagement. Every aspect of the event experience, from ticketing to content monetization, will be driven by blockchain, ensuring long-term sustainability for artists and event organizers alike.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nProposed Programming Framework for IRL Africa\n\n1. Free Online Workshops for Artists\n\nOnboarding to Blockchain (Base): We will conduct virtual workshops to teach African artists how to use Unlock Protocol for ticketing and monetization on Base. These workshops will focus on simple, step-by-step integration of blockchain technology into their music careers.\n\nKPIs: Number of artists onboarded, workshop completion rates, ability to use blockchain tools.\n\n\n\n2. Fan Engagement\n\nFollowing the workshops, artists will guide their fanbase through blockchain usage for concert ticketing, helping them get familiar with decentralized tools. This not only builds direct fan-to-artist relationships but also increases fan participation in event planning and engagement.\n\nKPIs: Fan engagement levels, tickets claimed via blockchain, artist-to-fan interactions.\n\n3. Main Event: Free Concert at Skug Barn\n\nLive Music Performance: The pilot event will take place at Skug Barn with 300 attendees (capacity up for review based on demand). Tickets will be distributed via blockchain (Unlock Protocol), and free entry will be granted to those claiming tickets online. To promote inclusivity, a limited number of tickets will be sold at the door for a higher price in fiat currency.\n\nContent Creation & Monetization: The concert will be professionally recorded, and fans will be able to mint pictures and videos as NFTs via Base. This creates new revenue streams for artists while continuing fan engagement after the event.\n\nKPIs: Number of tickets claimed via blockchain, NFTs minted, content sales revenue.\n\n\n\n4. Post-Concert Engagement\n\nFans will remain engaged with blockchain tools post-event by minting concert moments as NFTs. This keeps them actively involved in the ecosystem and helps artists monetize their performances even after the concert ends.\n\n\n\n5. Scaling & Future Event Planning\n\nBased on the success of the pilot, IRL Africa will expand to more cities such as Johannesburg, Cape Town, Vic Falls, and Nairobi, onboarding more artists and fans onto the blockchain. This scalable model will continue to use free concerts as a gateway to onboard African audiences into the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nKPIs: Number of cities expanded to, number of blockchain-enabled concerts, continued fan engagement.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nRoadmap\n\nPhase 1: Research & Development (3-6 months)\n\nConduct surveys and focus groups to gather insights from artists, fans, and potential partners.\n\nDevelop prototypes for blockchain ticketing, artist engagement, and sustainability initiatives.\n\nKPIs: Community insights gathered, artist onboarding, tool prototypes developed.\n\n\nPhase 2: Pilot Events (6-12 months)\n\nLaunch the first concert in Harare using Unlock Protocol for ticketing and fan engagement.\n\nEvaluate and test blockchain solutions in different African cities such as Johannesburg, Cape Town, Vic Falls, and Nairobi.\n\nKPIs: Concert attendance, blockchain usage metrics, fan engagement.\n\n\nPhase 3: Full-Scale Launch (12-24 months)\n\nScale the initiative across 10 cities, deepening blockchain integration.\n\nAllow fans to drive artist selection and further democratize event planning using decentralized platforms.\n\nKPIs: Number of cities onboarded, continued engagement metrics, revenue generated through NFTs and blockchain-driven events.\n\n\n\n---\n\nSustainability Model\n\nOur goal is to establish a self-sustaining ecosystem where:\n\n1. Artists generate revenue through fair payment structures and continuous engagement with their fanbase via blockchain.\n\n\n2. Fans are incentivized to attend free concerts through blockchain ticketing, with premium access available at the door for inclusion.\n\n\n3. NFTs and blockchain-based content minting create lasting financial opportunities for both artists and fans.\n\n\n4. As we scale, partnerships with local sponsors, brands, and blockchain platforms like Unlock Protocol will provide additional funding and logistical support to sustain these events.\n\nBudget \nBudget  ( Pilot event: Skug Barn Harare) \nArtist Fees & Production Costs: ~ $2500 \nAdministrative Costs ~$500",

      "title": "[Increased Submission Fee] Unlock East Africa - Ecosystem Growth Initiative",
      "content": "### Context:\n  The previous proposal could not be executed due to increase in the maxSubmissionCost fee required by Arbitrum Inbox\n  contract in order to accept retryable ticket requests. The current fee required for submission has surpassed the estimated amount\n  at the time the proposal was created causing the proposal execution to fail.\n  In this proposal steps have been taken to mitigate such occurences by adding a buffer to the estimated maxSubmissionCost, this allows\n  the proposal to accommodate a wider range of fee changes over the course of the proposal lifecycle.\n\n  ### Description:\n  Unlock East Africa focuses on increasing Unlock Protocol adoption across East Africa, starting with Rwanda.\n  Africa is buzzing with new Web3 communities and numerous emerging projects, and is a prime target for Unlock's\n  innovative ticketing, membership and subscription offerings. This initiative aims to educate developers, creators,\n  and entrepreneurs first about Ethereum, and takes a step further to illustrate Unlock Protocol as an prime\n  example of an application built on Ethereum, and demonstrate some of its use cases such as ticketing, memberships,\n  rewards, and loyalty programs in a practical manner. This approach will not only educate but also familiarize\n  participants with Unlock's distinctive features as they go through different experiences in real time.\n  The project involves 7 workshops designed to cater to both technical and non-technical audience, with sustained weekly\n  events over the span of 3 months in order to facilitate a sense of community. We round off with a hackathon to usher\n  new developers into the ecosystem and provide an opportunity for builders to create innovative solutions to local challenges\n  using power of Ethereum and Unlock Protocol. Through this grant, we aim to instigate Unlock's adoption at ground level in East Africa,\n  building toward a powerful ripple effect across the entire continent's blooming Web3 communities.\n\n  #### Month 1: Pre-Event Preparation\n  **Objectives:**\n  1. Secure venue and date for the non-technical workshop, technical workshop, and the hackathon\n  2. Design workshops curriculum and hackathon scope\n  3. Initiate promotions and engagement drive for workshops and hackathon attendees\n\n  **Main Tasks:**\n  - Book flights and accommodation\n  - Identify and secure venues\n  - Develop the programme for the workshops and hackathon\n  - Initiate marketing and promotional activities\n\n  **Deliverables:**\n  - Secured venue and dates for events\n  - Ready workshop curriculum and hackathon programme \n  - Create and schedule promotional activities\n\n  #### Month 2: Execution of the Non-Technical Workshop\n  **Objectives:**\n  - Conducting the non-technical workshop\n  - Encourage participation in subsequent events\n  - Collect feedback and initiate improvements for future events\n  - Airdrop phase 1 (Initial UDT distribution)\n\n  **Main Tasks:**\n  - Finalize event logistics for the non-technical workshop\n  - Execute promotional activities\n  - Execute the non-technical workshop\n\n  **Deliverables:**\n  - Successful organization and completion of the non-technical workshops\n  - Feedback from attendees evaluated and plans to adjust future workshops \n\n  #### Month 3: Execution of the Technical Workshop and Hackathon\n  **Objectives:**\n  - Execute the technical workshop\n  - Conduct the hackathon\n  - Airdrop phase 2 (Final UDT distribution)\n  - Gather feedback and debrief on event successes and areas of improvement\n\n  **Main Tasks:**\n  - Finalize event logistics for the technical workshop and hackathon \n  - Continue promotional activities\n  - Execute the technical workshop \n  - Execute the hackathon \n\n  **Deliverables:**\n  - Successful completion of the technical workshop and hackathon\n  - Analysis of feedback from all events for future improvements\n  \n\n  #### Anything Else You Should Know:\n  Total execution cost of the initiative is ~$10,000, I have secured a grant of $5000 from the Ethereum Foundation to cover the execution costs. \n  Support from the Unlock Protocol DAO would ensure the successful initiation and execution of the project. \n  Furthermore 100 UDT of the total requested UDT amount (600 UDT) will be airdropped to the community through various community activations to further decentralize Unlock DAO governance and increase participation in governance processes.\n\n  **Requested grant amount:**\n  **[Adjusted]** $2000 in ARB - Upfront (covers travel, and accommodation costs.)\n  600 UDT\n\n  \n  ### Goal of the proposal\n   This is a proposal initiates the first payout of Unlock East Africa grant.  \n   Our request is for the equivalent of $2000 in ARB ~ 3636 ARB value at the time of \n   creating this proposal to be paid upfront, and 200 UDT which is the\n   first part of 600 UDT to be streamed over 3 months.  \n  \n   **For Reference**  \n   [Snapshot temperature check for Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/unlock-protocol.eth/proposal/0xb71f9116e84cd64f27d3e5e23659933cc7f476869d0b8d12711c1c1712a06709)  \n  \n  Total:\n    $2000 in ARB ~ 3636 ARB @ $0.55  \n    200 UDT  \n\n  \n  #### About the proposal\n    The proposal contains one call to transfer 200 UDT to 0xCA7632327567796e51920F6b16373e92c7823854 as stated in the grant application.\n\n    The proposal contains a second call to the Arbitrum Delayed Inbox Contract's createRetryableTicket() function on mainnet to create a \"Retryable Ticket\" that will attempt to execute an L2 request to the ARB token contract to transfer 3636.0 of token from the Timelock L2 Alias address 0x28ffDfB0A6e6E06E95B3A1f928Dc4024240bD87c to the receiver's address 0xCA7632327567796e51920F6b16373e92c7823854 -  \n      transfer(0xCA7632327567796e51920F6b16373e92c7823854,3636.0).\n\n    Once approved and executed, the request will be sent to the Delayed Inbox contract and a ticket is created.\n    \n    Note that, this function forces the sender to provide a reasonable amount of funds (at least enough to submitting, and attempting to executing the ticket), but that doesn't guarantee a successful auto-redemption.

      "title": "Unlock East Africa - Ecosystem Growth Initiative",
      "content": "### Description:\n  Unlock East Africa focuses on increasing Unlock Protocol adoption across East Africa, starting with Rwanda.\n  Africa is buzzing with new Web3 communities and numerous emerging projects, and is a prime target for Unlock's\n  innovative ticketing, membership and subscription offerings. This initiative aims to educate developers, creators,\n  and entrepreneurs first about Ethereum, and takes a step further to illustrate Unlock Protocol as an prime\n  example of an application built on Ethereum, and demonstrate some of its use cases such as ticketing, memberships,\n  rewards, and loyalty programs in a practical manner. This approach will not only educate but also familiarize\n  participants with Unlock's distinctive features as they go through different experiences in real time.\n  The project involves 7 workshops designed to cater to both technical and non-technical audience, with sustained weekly\n  events over the span of 3 months in order to facilitate a sense of community. We round off with a hackathon to usher\n  new developers into the ecosystem and provide an opportunity for builders to create innovative solutions to local challenges\n  using power of Ethereum and Unlock Protocol. Through this grant, we aim to instigate Unlock's adoption at ground level in East Africa,\n  building toward a powerful ripple effect across the entire continent's blooming Web3 communities.\n\n  #### Month 1: Pre-Event Preparation\n  **Objectives:**\n  1. Secure venue and date for the non-technical workshop, technical workshop, and the hackathon\n  2. Design workshops curriculum and hackathon scope\n  3. Initiate promotions and engagement drive for workshops and hackathon attendees\n\n  **Main Tasks:**\n  - Book flights and accommodation\n  - Identify and secure venues\n  - Develop the programme for the workshops and hackathon\n  - Initiate marketing and promotional activities\n\n  **Deliverables:**\n  - Secured venue and dates for events\n  - Ready workshop curriculum and hackathon programme \n  - Create and schedule promotional activities\n\n  #### Month 2: Execution of the Non-Technical Workshop\n  **Objectives:**\n  - Conducting the non-technical workshop\n  - Encourage participation in subsequent events\n  - Collect feedback and initiate improvements for future events\n  - Airdrop phase 1 (Initial UDT distribution)\n\n  **Main Tasks:**\n  - Finalize event logistics for the non-technical workshop\n  - Execute promotional activities\n  - Execute the non-technical workshop\n\n  **Deliverables:**\n  - Successful organization and completion of the non-technical workshops\n  - Feedback from attendees evaluated and plans to adjust future workshops \n\n  #### Month 3: Execution of the Technical Workshop and Hackathon\n  **Objectives:**\n  - Execute the technical workshop\n  - Conduct the hackathon\n  - Airdrop phase 2 (Final UDT distribution)\n  - Gather feedback and debrief on event successes and areas of improvement\n\n  **Main Tasks:**\n  - Finalize event logistics for the technical workshop and hackathon \n  - Continue promotional activities\n  - Execute the technical workshop \n  - Execute the hackathon \n\n  **Deliverables:**\n  - Successful completion of the technical workshop and hackathon\n  - Analysis of feedback from all events for future improvements\n  \n\n  #### Anything Else You Should Know:\n  Total execution cost of the initiative is ~$10,000, I have secured a grant of $5000 from the Ethereum Foundation to cover the execution costs. \n  Support from the Unlock Protocol DAO would ensure the successful initiation and execution of the project. \n  Furthermore 100 UDT of the total requested UDT amount (600 UDT) will be airdropped to the community through various community activations to further decentralize Unlock DAO governance and increase participation in governance processes.\n\n  **Requested grant amount:**\n  **[Adjusted]** $2000 in ARB - Upfront (covers travel, and accommodation costs.)\n  600 UDT\n\n  \n  ### Goal of the proposal\n   This is a proposal initiates the first payout of Unlock East Africa grant.  \n   Our request is for the equivalent of $2000 in ARB ~ 3636 ARB value at the time of \n   creating this proposal to be paid upfront, and 200 UDT which is the\n   first part of 600 UDT to be streamed over 3 months.  \n  \n   **For Reference**  \n   [Snapshot temperature check for Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/unlock-protocol.eth/proposal/0xb71f9116e84cd64f27d3e5e23659933cc7f476869d0b8d12711c1c1712a06709)  \n  \n  Total:\n    $2000 in ARB ~ 3636 ARB @ $0.55  \n    200 UDT  \n\n  \n  #### About the proposal\n    The proposal contains one call to transfer 200 UDT to 0xCA7632327567796e51920F6b16373e92c7823854 as stated in the grant application.\n\n    The proposal contains a second call to the Arbitrum Delayed Inbox Contract's createRetryableTicket() function on mainnet to create a \"Retryable Ticket\" that will attempt to execute an L2 request to the ARB token contract to transfer 3636.0 of token from the Timelock L2 Alias address 0x28ffDfB0A6e6E06E95B3A1f928Dc4024240bD87c to the receiver's address 0xCA7632327567796e51920F6b16373e92c7823854 -  \n      transfer(0xCA7632327567796e51920F6b16373e92c7823854,3636.0).\n\n    Once approved and executed, the request will be sent to the Delayed Inbox contract and a ticket is created.\n    \n    Note that, this function forces the sender to provide a reasonable amount of funds (at least enough to submitting, and attempting to executing the ticket), but that doesn't guarantee a successful auto-redemption.

      "title": "Unlock East Africa - Ecosystem Growth Initiative",
      "content": "### Description:\n  Unlock East Africa focuses on increasing Unlock Protocol adoption across East Africa, starting with Rwanda.\n  Africa is buzzing with new Web3 communities and numerous emerging projects, and is a prime target for Unlock's\n  innovative ticketing, membership and subscription offerings. This initiative aims to educate developers, creators,\n  and entrepreneurs first about Ethereum, and takes a step further to illustrate Unlock Protocol as an prime\n  example of an application built on Ethereum, and demonstrate some of its use cases such as ticketing, memberships,\n  rewards, and loyalty programs in a practical manner. This approach will not only educate but also familiarize\n  participants with Unlock's distinctive features as they go through different experiences in real time.\n  The project involves 7 workshops designed to cater to both technical and non-technical audience, with sustained weekly\n  events over the span of 3 months in order to facilitate a sense of community. We round off with a hackathon to usher\n  new developers into the ecosystem and provide an opportunity for builders to create innovative solutions to local challenges\n  using power of Ethereum and Unlock Protocol. Through this grant, we aim to instigate Unlock's adoption at ground level in East Africa,\n  building toward a powerful ripple effect across the entire continent's blooming Web3 communities.\n\n  #### Month 1: Pre-Event Preparation\n  **Objectives:**\n  1. Secure venue and date for the non-technical workshop, technical workshop, and the hackathon\n  2. Design workshops curriculum and hackathon scope\n  3. Initiate promotions and engagement drive for workshops and hackathon attendees\n\n  **Main Tasks:**\n  - Book flights and accommodation\n  - Identify and secure venues\n  - Develop the programme for the workshops and hackathon\n  - Initiate marketing and promotional activities\n\n  **Deliverables:**\n  - Secured venue and dates for events\n  - Ready workshop curriculum and hackathon programme \n  - Create and schedule promotional activities\n\n  #### Month 2: Execution of the Non-Technical Workshop\n  **Objectives:**\n  - Conducting the non-technical workshop\n  - Encourage participation in subsequent events\n  - Collect feedback and initiate improvements for future events\n  - Airdrop phase 1 (Initial UDT distribution)\n\n  **Main Tasks:**\n  - Finalize event logistics for the non-technical workshop\n  - Execute promotional activities\n  - Execute the non-technical workshop\n\n  **Deliverables:**\n  - Successful organization and completion of the non-technical workshops\n  - Feedback from attendees evaluated and plans to adjust future workshops \n\n  #### Month 3: Execution of the Technical Workshop and Hackathon\n  **Objectives:**\n  - Execute the technical workshop\n  - Conduct the hackathon\n  - Airdrop phase 2 (Final UDT distribution)\n  - Gather feedback and debrief on event successes and areas of improvement\n\n  **Main Tasks:**\n  - Finalize event logistics for the technical workshop and hackathon \n  - Continue promotional activities\n  - Execute the technical workshop \n  - Execute the hackathon \n\n  **Deliverables:**\n  - Successful completion of the technical workshop and hackathon\n  - Analysis of feedback from all events for future improvements\n  \n\n  #### Anything Else You Should Know:\n  Total execution cost of the initiative is ~$10,000, I have secured a grant of $5000 from the Ethereum Foundation to cover the execution costs. \n  Support from the Unlock Protocol DAO would ensure the successful initiation and execution of the project. \n  Furthermore 100 UDT of the total requested UDT amount (600 UDT) will be airdropped to the community through various community activations to further decentralize Unlock DAO governance and increase participation in governance processes.\n\n  **Requested grant amount:**\n  **[Adjusted]** $2000 in ARB - Upfront (covers travel, and accommodation costs.)\n  600 UDT\n\n  \n  ### Goal of the proposal\n   This is a proposal initiates the first payout of Unlock East Africa grant.  \n   Our request is for the equivalent of $2000 in ARB ~ 3636 ARB value at the time of \n   creating this proposal to be paid upfront, and 200 UDT which is the\n   first part of 600 UDT to be streamed over 3 months.  \n  \n   **For Reference**  \n   [Snapshot temperature check for Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/unlock-protocol.eth/proposal/0xb71f9116e84cd64f27d3e5e23659933cc7f476869d0b8d12711c1c1712a06709)  \n  \n  Total:\n    $2000 in ARB ~ 3636 ARB @ $0.55  \n    200 UDT  \n\n  \n  #### About the proposal\n    The proposal contains one call to transfer 200 UDT to 0xCA7632327567796e51920F6b16373e92c7823854 as stated in the grant application.\n\n    The proposal contains a second call to the Arbitrum Delayed Inbox Contract's createRetryableTicket() function on mainnet to create a \"Retryable Ticket\" that will attempt to execute an L2 request to the ARB token contract to transfer 3636.0 of token from the Timelock L2 Alias address 0x28ffDfB0A6e6E06E95B3A1f928Dc4024240bD87c to the receiver's address 0xCA7632327567796e51920F6b16373e92c7823854 -  \n      transfer(0xCA7632327567796e51920F6b16373e92c7823854,3636.0).\n\n    Once approved and executed, the request will be sent to the Delayed Inbox contract and a ticket is created.\n    \n    Note that, this function forces the sender to provide a reasonable amount of funds (at least enough to submitting, and attempting to executing the ticket), but that doesn't guarantee a successful auto-redemption. [Checkout arbitrum docs for more info.](https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging).\n\n    Thank you!\n  ",

      "title": "Liason Engineer For Unlock DAO",
      "content": "Introduction:\nUnlock protocol DAO is evolving and growing at an unprecedented pace, several activities and initiatives emerge that require technical expertise for execution. Since Unlock Protocol Labs consists of a small team who have their hands full with shipping features and updates for the protocol on an almost weekly basis, they have limited bandwidth to focus on other technical needs of the DAO. This necessitates the role of the liaison engineer.\n\nRole Description: \nThe role of the Liaison Engineer focuses on driving innovation and working on technical development for DAO-related projects and in close collaboration with the Unlock Labs team.\n\nKey Responsibilities:\n1. Technical Research & Development:\n   - Conduct technical research on new initiatives, tools, and applications that could benefit the DAO.\n   - Develop proofs of concept (PoCs) and prototypes for proposed solutions.\n   - Evaluate the feasibility and potential impact of technical proposals from the community and the DAO.\n2. Coordination & Collaboration:\n   - Act as a technical bridge between the DAO and the Labs team, ensuring smooth communication and collaboration.\n   - Coordinate with the Labs team to understand their capabilities, timelines, and potential support for DAO-initiated projects.\n   - Facilitate knowledge transfer between the DAO and Labs team, ensuring both parties are aligned on technical matters.\n3. Community Engagement & Support:\n   - Engage with the community to gather requirements and feedback for approved initiatives where necessary.\n4. Implementation & Maintenance:\n   - Lead the implementation of specific technical initiatives as approved by the DAO.\n   - Perform ongoing maintenance and upgrades of DAO-initiated technical projects.\n\nWhy Me?: \nI’ve been a consistently active contributor to the Unlock Protocol since 2022 when I joined the DAO. During that time I have built different prototypes implementing the protocol, taken on several bounties, and submitted multiple PRs (pull requests) to demonstrate my understanding of the Protocol and technical competence.\nMy commitment and dedication to the long-term success of Unlock Protocol evident from my track record and contributions make me a suitable candidate for this role.\n\nMeasuring Impact: \nTo assess my performance and impact in this role, key performance indicators (KPIs) can be established, including:\n1. Project Delivery:\n   - Number of technical projects successfully delivered on time and within scope.\n2. Collaboration Effectiveness:\n   - Feedback from both the DAO and Labs team on the effectiveness of communication and collaboration.\n3. Impact:\n    - Measurable improvements in DAO operations or processes resulting from implemented technical solutions.\n4. Issue Resolution:\n   - Response time and effectiveness in addressing technical support requests from the DAO.\n\nCompensation:\n In recognition of the time and effort required to fulfill this role effectively, I propose a compensation of 200 UDT per month for 6 months after which the terms and performance may be reviewed and (or) renewed. Since the purpose of UDT is intended for governance rights and not necessarily as payment I would require an additional liquid form of compensation for the role and propose an additional $1000 USDC (or token equivalent) per DAO-initiative implemented. This compensation aligns with the value provided and ensures fair remuneration for the responsibilities undertaken.\nI will receive both (when applicable) at the end of the month to this wallet: 0xCA7632327567796e51920F6b16373e92c7823854",

      "title": "Multi-sig for the DAO",
      "content": "### Background\n\nAs discussed, the DAO is in need of a multi-signature wallet to become more agile with its payment and funding distribution.  has reached out to me because Gitcoin has updated allo (its grants protocol). The new features implemented clash with Tally's call function from Arbitrum to ETH Mainnet and back to Arbitrum.  was added to the conversation, and essentially, the Gitcoin team recommends establishing one wallet that receives the funds and then distributes them.\n\nThis occurrence is a good trigger to get this on the road and executed. But first, let me clarify a few things that will be important in making an informed decision.\n\n\n### What is a Multi-Signature Wallet \n\nA multi-signature wallet, commonly known as a multi-sig wallet, is a type of cryptocurrency wallet that requires multiple signatures to authorize a transaction. Unlike traditional wallets that rely on a single private key, multisig wallets distribute the signing authority among multiple parties, enhancing security by eliminating a single point of failure. This setup is particularly beneficial for organizations or groups managing shared assets, as it requires consensus among several key holders before any funds can be moved, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access or theft.\n\n\n### Reasons for Establishing a Multi-Signature Wallet \n\nAside from the most recent occurrence with the retroQF round there are more general reasons why the DAO should hold a multi-sig wallet:\n\n- **Increased Security:** Requires multiple signatures to authorize transactions, minimizing the risk of theft or loss due to a single compromised key.\n- **Shared Control:** Distributes control over funds among multiple members, preventing any single individual from having unilateral access. \n- **Transparency:** Enhances accountability as all transactions require consensus, which can be recorded and audited. \n- **Risk Mitigation:** Reduces the impact of lost or stolen keys, as multiple keys are necessary to access the wallet. \n- **Facilitates Collaboration:** Encourages teamwork and collective decision-making within the DAO by requiring agreement on transactions.\n\n\n### What Technology and How Does It Work?\n\nGnosis Safe (now Safe Global) is the most used and well-known option. Safe Global is a popular multi-signature wallet allowing users to securely manage their digital assets. The setup process is straightforward: \n\n- **Wallet Creation:** Stella, as Lead Steward, could create a Gnosis Safe wallet by defining the number of owners and the number of required signatures (3). \n- **Address Generation:** A unique multi-signature address is generated to receive funds in a few clicks on the platform page.\n- **Transaction Process:** To initiate a transaction, one owner creates a transaction proposal that must be signed by the required number of owners (here 5). \n- **Signature Collection:** Each involved party uses their private key to sign the transaction. Once the required number of signatures is collected, the transaction can be executed. \n- **Broadcasting:** The signed transaction is then broadcast to the blockchain for processing\n\n\n### Rules for the Multi-Signature Wallet\n\nTo clarify, this multi-sig wallet is not meant to replace the timelock contract. It is meant as a supporting measurement. Therefore, the monthly DAO Payroll and everything that can be paid for using the timelock should continue to be paid through the timelock only.\n\nHere are my suggested rules for how the DAO could/ should only use the multi-sig wallet when necessary:\n\n- **Access Control:** A minimum of five elected DAO members should be in charge of the wallet. I suggest those people are either working group stewards or well-known DAO Delegates. After discussions in the DAO the aim would be to have rather more than less people being signers; up to 7. Since we currently have not enough eligible folks we would start with the lower number and eventually put up another election proposal.\n- **Disqualification Criteria:** If an elected signee neglects their duty more than 3 times, the ability to sign will be taken away from them by the DAO.\n- **Minimum Signature Requirements:**  Ideally, we will have a minimum of five authorized signees. Three of those five will always be required to sign. By withdrawing from their role as a Delegate or Steward, this role will be retrieved and given to another eligible member of the DAO.\n- **Emergency Protocols:** Let's ensure that we can handle a possible recovery if the managing account gets ever compromised or keys are lost for any reason. I can use help here 😆 \n\n\n### Suggested Deployment Chains\n\nCurrently, SafeGlobal only allows for deployment on one chain per created wallet. If we indeed wish to be more flexible, we might want to set up more than one wallet. Taking into consideration our recent activities and what is to come, I would like to suggest that we have a wallet with the same signers on:\n\n- Ethereum Mainnet\n- Arbitrum\n- Base\n\nAs a reference, these are all currently available networks with SafeGlobal: \nhttps://help.safe.global/en/articles/40795-supported-networks\n\n\n### Suggested Implementation Time\n\nThe implementation of a DAO multi-signature wallet should be swift and take no longer than 1-2 weeks. Our first transaction should be a test transaction to ensure everything works properly. \nHowever, in parallel, we should run an election vote for the first three holders, which requires a separate proposal.",

Africa is buzzing with new Web3 communities and numerous emerging projects, and is a prime target for Unlock's innovative ticketing, membership and subscription offerings. This initiative aims to educate developers, creators, and entrepreneurs first about Ethereum, and takes a step further to illustrate Unlock Protocol as an prime example of an application built on Ethereum, and demonstrate some of its use cases such as ticketing, memberships, rewards, and loyalty programs in a practical manner.\nThis approach will not only educate but also familiarize participants with Unlock's distinctive features as they go through different experiences in real time.\nThe project involves 7 workshops designed to cater to both technical and non-technical audience, with sustained weekly events over the span of 3 months in order to facilitate a sense of community. We round off with a hackathon to usher new developers into the ecosystem and provide an opportunity for builders to create innovative solutions to local challenges using power of Ethereum and Unlock Protocol.\nThrough this grant, we aim to instigate Unlock's adoption at ground level in East Africa, building toward a powerful ripple effect across the entire continent's blooming Web3 communities.\n\n**Completion Time:** 3 Months\n\n**Team:** Danny Thomx (myself), an experienced blockchain developer and educator.

      "title": "Liason Engineer For Unlock DAO",
      "content": "## Introduction:\nUnlock protocol DAO is evolving and growing at an unprecedented pace, several activities and initiatives emerge that require technical expertise for execution. Since the Unlock Protocol Labs consists of a small team who have their hands full with shipping features and updates for the protocol on an almost weekly basis, they have limited bandwidth to focus on other technical needs of the DAO. This necessitates the role of the liaison engineer.\n\n### Role Description: \nThe role of the Liason Engineer focuses on driving innovation and working on technical development for DAO-related projects and in close collaboration with the Unlock Labs team.\n\n#### Key Responsibilities:\n1. **Technical Research & Development**:\n   - Conduct technical research on new initiatives, tools, and applications that could benefit the DAO.\n   - Develop proofs of concept (PoCs) and prototypes for proposed solutions.\n   - Evaluate the feasibility and potential impact of technical proposals from the community and the DAO.\n2. **Coordination & Collaboration**:\n   - Act as a technical bridge between the DAO and the Labs team, ensuring smooth communication and collaboration.\n   - Coordinate with the Labs team to understand their capabilities, timelines, and potential support for DAO-initiated projects.\n   - Facilitate knowledge transfer between the DAO and Labs team, ensuring both parties are aligned on technical matters.\n3. **Community Engagement & Support**:\n   - Engage with the community to gather requirements and feedback for approved initiatives where necessary.\n4. **Implementation & Maintenance**:\n   - Lead the implementation of specific technical initiatives as approved by the DAO.\n   - Perform ongoing maintenance and upgrades of DAO-initiated technical projects.\n\n#### Why Me?: \nI’ve been a consistently active contributor to the Unlock Protocol since 2022 when I joined the DAO. During that time I have built different prototypes implementing the protocol, taken on several bounties, and submitted multiple PRs (pull requests) to demonstrate my understanding of the Protocol and technical competence.\nMy commitment and dedication to the long-term success of Unlock Protocol evident from my track record and contributions make me a suitable candidate for this role.\n\n#### Measuring Impact: \nTo assess my performance and impact in this role, key performance indicators (KPIs) can be established, including:\n1. **Project Delivery**:\n   - Number of technical projects successfully delivered on time and within scope.\n2. **Collaboration Effectiveness**:\n   - Feedback from both the DAO and Labs team on the effectiveness of communication and collaboration.\n3. **Impact**:\n    - Measurable improvements in DAO operations or processes resulting from implemented technical solutions.\n4. **Issue Resolution**:\n   - Response time and effectiveness in addressing technical support requests from the DAO.\n\n#### Compensation:\n In recognition of the time and effort required to fulfill this role effectively, I propose a compensation of 200 UDT per month for 6 months after which the terms and performance may be reviewed and (or) renewed. Since the purpose of UDT is intended for governance rights and not necessarily as payment I would require an additional liquid form of compensation for the role and propose an additional $1000 USDC (or token equivalent) per DAO-initiative implemented. This compensation aligns with the value provided and ensures fair remuneration for the responsibilities undertaken.\nI will receive both (when applicable) at the end of the month to this wallet: 0xCA7632327567796e51920F6b16373e92c7823854",

      "title": "Token Listing Officer Proposal",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nThis proposal grants the title of Token Listing Officer for a term of 12 months to legal name, Angela Marie Thomas, aka Angela Steffens (wonderwomancode.eth) of Olympia, Washington, USA, the authority to execute applications for the listing of the Unlock DAO Tokens (UDT) on centralized exchanges and various private and DAO run informational listing services, to follow up with associated staff on behalf of the DAO and to put up proposals if any additional funding is needed.\n\n# Why it matters\n\nHaving UDT listed on centralized exchanges, especially in countries where they have to deal with regulatory bodies, would provide the following benefits to the DAO. \n\n\n\n* It gives a public perception of legitimacy to Unlock Protocol.\n* It will provide much-needed visibility to the protocol it currently does not have.\n* It will allow those who wish to have a future say in the protocol more options for purchasing UDT if they do not have the time to spend to earn their tokens.\n* It will allow those who are doing the business of running the Unlock DAO the ability to exchange their awarded UDT for other tokens or fiat as they need, thus attracting more talent to the DAO membership.\n* Over time, it should stabilize the price and reduce the wild swings we sometimes see from even low-volume activity.\n\n\n\nChecking for listings on token informational sites to ensure they exist and are up to date provides the following benefits.\n\n* It ensures that when applications are made to centralized exchanges, the Unlock DAO is seen as active and on top of things, giving the public a perception of legitimacy to Unlock Protocol.\n* It ensures that the new governor contract at 0x440d9D4E66d39bb28FB58729Cb4D3ead2A595591 is appropriately referenced and not the old contract at 0x7757f7f21f5fa9b1fd168642b79416051cd0bb94.\n\n\n\n\nIt provides the additional benefit of having a single point of contact for the Unlock, Inc. team and the DAO membership to whom incoming requests can be directed.\n\n# Why Angela\n\nIn short, trust! \n\n\n\nAs a former member of the Unlock, Inc. staff and an active member of the DAO, she is in a unique position that few others inside the DAO are. The benefits of that position are as follows. \n\n* Most community members know Angela and have spoken with her online and/or in person at events. \n* Many people at some of these exchanges or listing sites have had previous interactions with Angela as the public face of Unlock Protocol during her time as Community Lead or in her activities with other DAOs and NFT projects. \n* She understands the inner workings of Unlock, Inc. and Unlock DAO. \n\n\n\nSome additional facts about Angela that are beneficial for this position.\n\n* She is fully doxxed.\n* She has been in a position of trust with other US corporations and international corporations. \n* She has managed legal trust accounts with millions of dollars.\n* She has had full administrative access to databases with large amounts of highly regulated data (HIPAA, PCI, GDPR).\n* She has passed an FBI background check as a related party to a highly regulated business in the legal marijuana space in Washington state. \n\n\n\nRecommendations and work history can be found <https://www.linkedin.com/in/wonderwomancode/>\n\n# Why trust matters\n\nWe are used to dealing with trustless systems in this space. In all other instances, Angela favors trustless systems. However, this particular position requires a high level of trust from the person undertaking it for the following reasons.\n\n* Some exchanges will require that non-disclosure agreements are signed.\n* Some exchanges have rules that publicly mentioning the potential listing on their exchange could disqualify UDT from being listed.\n* Some exchanges will want to see a trusted person as the one making the application and consider that when approving the listing.\n* Listing sites are more likely to take it seriously when hearing information from a trusted source, and this may influence the speed or even whether we get listed in some instances.\n\n\n\n# Compensation\n\nWallet address 0xFf4eC2057A4180A4Cd18FDEA144e53245e39869D shall receive 10 UDT per month while acting in this capacity. The monthly funds serve the following purpose. \n\n* A stipend for incidental expenses related to this position. Example, if a small fee needs to be paid to get something listed, it’s going to be faster to just get it done rather than put a proposal for $50.\n* To continue to ratify Angela in this position until she is otherwise voted out by the DAO, or her term has ended, allowing her to work confidently in the DAO's interest on these matters and provide ongoing proof to any exchanges that demand it.\n\n\n\nIn the future upon receipt of confirmation that work has been completed, grants in the following amounts will be made to the same wallet address.\n\n\n\n* 100 UDT per new UDT listing on a centralized exchange in the top 25 by volume\\*\n* 50 UDT per new UDT listing on a centralized exchange in the top 26-50 by volume\n* 25 UDT per new UDT listing on a centralized exchange 51 or lower by volume\n* 25 UDT per new UDT listing on a crypto/blockchain informational listing site or service with traffic better than 10,000 unique visitors\\*\\* per month\n* 10 UDT per update of UDT listing on a centralized exchange\n* 10 UDT per update of UDT listing on a crypto/blockchain informational listing site or service with traffic better than 10,000 unique visitors per month\n\n\n\nAngela will be responsible for providing proof and submitting requests for confirmed work grants on a batched quarterly basis to reduce voting costs. \n\n\n\n\n\\*All volume-based rankings will be taken from the exchange's ranking at the time of the funds request on the rankings from Coinmarketcap found here [<u>https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/</u>](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/). \n\n\n\n\\*\\*Traffic rankings for informational listings sites or services will be taken from Semrush.",

      "title": "Log Keeper of Unlock DAO",
      "content": "## Proposal Background \n\nAs we all know, regularly maintained and constantly updated documentation is not only important but mandatory, especially for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. Over the past few months, we have conversed quite a bit about this. I have written some bits and pieces, but the uploading process is daunting to me, even though Txbi explained it to me. I have a feeling this might be the case for many people. Therefore, I suggest we have one person to go to get the documentation updated, uploaded, and maintained: The Log Keeper!\n\nWith this role in place, we will definitely enhance Unlock DAO's governance and operational transparency as well as contribute to a smoother onboarding process.\n\n\n## Role Definition\n\nThe Log Keeper will act as the custodian of all official records and documents related to Unlock DAO. \nI envision this individual to be responsible for:\n\n- Uploading and updating documentation on the Unlock DAO site and other relevant platforms.\n- Ensuring all records are accurate, up-to-date, and comply with our governance standards. \n- Report to the Lead Steward if records seem out of order or need updating.\n- Archiving old records and maintaining an accessible and organized digital repository.\n- Enhancing the DAO’s transparency by making information readily available to members and the public.\n- Propose improvements in the creation of new documents or necessary processes.\n\n\n## Importance and Immediate Benefits\n\n- **Enhanced Transparency:** \nBy keeping thorough records, the Log Keeper will ensure that all DAO members have access to the information needed to make informed decisions, thereby enhancing trust and accountability within the community.\n- **Improved Governance:**\nAccurate and accessible records are fundamental to effective governance. They help track decisions, understand historical context, and provide a basis for future actions.\n- **Operational Efficiency:** \nStreamlined documentation processes will improve operational efficiency, making onboarding new members easier, referencing past decisions, and managing the DAO’s activities.\n\n\n## Proposed Rewards\n\nThe Log Keeper will be compensated per action as follows:\n- Upload & Markup Editing - 8 UDT per finalized Upload\n- Updating of existing records - 4 UDT per updated article\n\nThe payout will be on the monthly Role Payout schedule for all official DAO Members who hold a role in the Unlock DAO Ecosystem.\n\n## Candidate Criteria & Suggestion\n\nI want to suggest @Txbi from our community for this position. He is well-versed in how the protocol works, is constantly up to date on what happens in the DAO (even when not able to attend calls), and feels passionate about where everything is headed. Since he was the one who explained the process to me, I know firsthand that he will have no problem technically speaking on keeping our documentation well-maintained and organized.\n\nCriteria for Selection:\n\n- Strong organizational skills and attention to detail.\n- Proven experience in data management or archival work.\n- Understanding of DAO operations.\n- Proven experience in handling GitHub-powered documentation\n\n## Evaluation of Performance:\n\n- Accuracy and timeliness of documentation uploaded.\n- Ease of access and organization of the digital repository.\n- Positive feedback from the DAO community regarding the availability and usefulness of documentation.",

This is 1 of 2 requests that will include actions for the transfer of funds for this project. The 2nd will be to transfer the ARB tokens, but that is not addressed here since I didn't want to mix the L1 and L2 actions to make it easier to understand for those reviewing.",

      "title": "7.7k ARB to help Fund Unlock Protocol’s Ecosystem via QF (round 2)",
      "content": "This proposal requests to use 7.7k in Arb tokens given to Unlock Protocol Labs by ArbitrumDAO to run a retroQF round on Grants Stack, to help incentivize AND reward builders using Unlock Protocol in an open, transparent, and democratic way. Our goal is to help fund at least 25+ projects with this funding. 7k Arb for the matching pool and 700 Arb for round operator fess (industry standard). Putting this up now so we have time to promote it like last time. The QF round will be run post-EthCC (mid-end of July). \n\nThis will be our second round and looks to build on our momentum from the one we ran just after EthDenver. **The goal with this round is to target EthCC and encourage more communities/events to use Unlock for ticketing, while also encouraging more builders to integrate Unlock into their projects.** \n\nFrom the previous proposal (https://snapshot.org/#/unlock-protocol.eth/proposal/0xaa142e599d981f0b58c3ac1a51af9f9a52fb5307f27d791ecc18c4da69eeacc3) \"If successful we will look to run more rounds (every 1-2 quarters) to help encourage builders, creators, and communities to use Unlock Protocol.\" \n\nWe believe this retroQF was a success as we saw an increase in usage of Unlock on Arbirtum, were able to get the attention of Arbitrum for cross-promotion and generated more brand awareness and integration of Unlock. \n\nJust like last time, we will leverage QF funding mechanisms to help retroactively fund projects that the community deems valuable to the Unlock Ecosystem.\n\nOnly projects and teams who have integrated and used Unlock Protocol in a meaningful and impactful way will be eligible.\n\nSome eligibility criteria to be eligible for the round:\n\n- Must have integrated Unlock Protocol into their project or used Unlock for ticketing\n- Must be deployed on Arbtrium (can vote on this separately if we need)\n- Must disclose amount of NFTs/Certifications/memberships/tickets minted (and point to proof) 50 mints (total) min as an example\n- Needs to write a brief description/how the project positively impacted the Unlock Community and therefore is eligible for the round\n- This is retro funding, meaning the project needs to have already been launched/the event has already happened\n-link in social profiles\n- link github repo (if they have it)\n- share info on their team (are they solo or a group)\n- tweet about the round/unlock protocol\n- We will verify to criteria before approving projects to participate in the round + there is gitcoin passport enabled to help ensure the round isn’t sybil attacked.\n\nAlso proposing a 20% matching cap - what this means is that any 1 project can only acquire a max of 20% of the total matching pool (Example - if the matching pool is 7000 in ARB, a project can only receive a max of 1400 ARB in matching funds) this ensures that more projects can be rewarded vs 1-2 larger projects capturing all the matching pool (this also helps with social collusion)\n\nWe want to find a way to meaningfully reward projects that have used Unlock for ticketing/ memberships and events, and projects that have integrated Unlock Protocol within their tech stack, in a fair way, at scale, and in public.\n\nTLDR; We reward projects using Unlock Protocol and Unlock Protocol is rewarded through increased usage, transactions and ecosystem growth.\n\nROI and benefits for the DAO/Unlock Ecosystem based on the last round:\n\n**We saw an increase in Unlock keys created on Arbitrum** \n \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibxlhfxudr3hmi3jxi6jeijvri2ql2csh6vwsxfsdvjq7coxnumvi)\n    \n  \n**Was able to cross-promote and collab with Arbitrum** \n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeifenxzrawx3djbnvbtfnwrjqoyctbpklgdyrmc7qsdm5ti3sghq3i)\n    \n**We were able to bring in first time users of Unlock, and also create more brand awareness** \n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreicc6bter4gdkxxk77xf5jlkvz4fj6p56nteezzx7ghpjflsxxdl44)\n    \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigtogrr3ava63mckm4qgxdxwamj7yjmb76fcehicmqjfoo36vuc4e)\n\nWe aim to continue our ecosystem flywheel that creates value for the Unlock Protocol ecosystem in a way that rewards projects, creators, and teams helping drive Unlock Protocol usage forward.",

      "title": "Set UDT and SwapBurner in Unlock contract on Arbitrum, Base and Optimism",
      "content": "## Goal of the proposal\n\nThis proposal sets 1) the UDT address and 2) the Swap Burner contract address in the main Unlock factory contract on the following chains: Arbitrum,Base,Optimism. \n  \n## About this proposal\n\nNow that UDT has been bridged to Arbitrum, Base and Optimism, the new address has to be set in the main Unlock contract for the tokens to be distributed or swap/burned. For that, we call the `configUnlock` function with the bridge UDT address as parameter (keeping other parameters untouched).\n\nA `SwapBurner` helper contract has been deployed on all three chains and will be added as setting to the main Unlock contract. This will enable the “swap and burn” feature of fees collected by the protocol on these chains, following the deployment of bridged versions of UDT there.\n\n## How it works\n\nThe proposal uses a cross-chain proposal pattern that, once passed, will send the calls to multiple chains at once. This pattern has been introduced and tested in a [previous proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/unlock/proposal/1926572528290918174819693611122933562560576845671089759587616947457423587439). \n\n## The calls\n\nThis DAO proposal contains 3 calls:\n\n### Arbitrum (42161) 1 call\n\n  Changes sent to the Unlock contract at 0x1FF7e338d5E582138C46044dc238543Ce555C963\n\n1. call `configUnlock` with the following parameters \n\n  - _udt: 0xd5d3aA404D7562d09a848F96a8a8d5D65977bF90\n  - _weth: 0x82aF49447D8a07e3bd95BD0d56f35241523fBab1\n  - _estimatedGasForPurchase: 200000\n  - _symbol: KEY\n  - _URI: https://locksmith.unlock-protocol.com/api/key/42161/\n  - _chainId: 42161\n\n2. call `setSwapBurner(0x316A4650e70594FA3D947a43A237bEF427Bd80d6)` and set the [SwapBurner](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x316A4650e70594FA3D947a43A237bEF427Bd80d6) contract\n  \n  \n\n### Base (8453) 1 call\n\n  Changes sent to the Unlock contract at 0xd0b14797b9D08493392865647384974470202A78\n\n1. call `configUnlock` with the following parameters \n\n  - _udt: 0xD7eA82D19f1f59FF1aE95F1945Ee6E6d86A25B96\n  - _weth: 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006\n  - _estimatedGasForPurchase: 200000\n  - _symbol: KEY\n  - _URI: https://locksmith.unlock-protocol.com/api/key/8453/\n  - _chainId: 8453\n\n2. call `setSwapBurner(0x440d9D4E66d39bb28FB58729Cb4D3ead2A595591)` and set the [SwapBurner](https://basescan.org/address/0x440d9D4E66d39bb28FB58729Cb4D3ead2A595591) contract\n  \n  \n\n### Optimism (10) 1 call\n\n  Changes sent to the Unlock contract at 0x99b1348a9129ac49c6de7F11245773dE2f51fB0c\n\n1. call `configUnlock` with the following parameters \n\n  - _udt: 0xc709c9116dBf29Da9c25041b13a07A0e68aC5d2D\n  - _weth: 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006\n  - _estimatedGasForPurchase: 200000\n  - _symbol: KEY\n  - _URI: https://locksmith.unlock-protocol.com/api/key/10/\n  - _chainId: 10\n\n2. call `setSwapBurner(0xd8250925527e769d90C6F2Fc55384B9110f26b62)` and set the [SwapBurner](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xd8250925527e769d90C6F2Fc55384B9110f26b62) contract\n  \n  \n\n  \nThe Unlock Protocol Team\n",

      "title": "Lead Steward for Unlock DAO (adapted proposal from Jan 2024)",
      "content": "### Proposal Background \n**This is an adaptation to the previous proposal, which can be found in the same discussion thread.*\n\nA Lead Steward acts as a key coordinator and facilitator within a DAO, bridging various internal and external elements of the organization. Internally, they oversee the coordination of projects and initiatives, ensuring that they align with the DAO's overall strategy and goals. They facilitate communication and collaboration across different teams and community members, helping streamline decision-making processes and enhance operational efficiency.\n\nExternally, the Lead Steward represents the DAO in public forums, industry conferences, and in negotiations with potential partners. This visibility helps in building relationships and expanding the DAO's network, which is crucial for its growth and success. They also play a significant role in public relations, shaping the DAO’s external image and managing its brand perception.\n\nAs an active member of the Unlock DAO community for over eight months now, several observations have led me to conclude that having a DAO representative would benefit the DAO in more than one way. In a nutshell, the role of a Lead Steward in Unlock Protocol is vital for ensuring that the organization remains focused, effective, and dynamic in its pursuit of providing decentralized access control solutions. This leadership role not only helps in managing day-to-day operations but also in shaping the future direction of the DAO.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, I created a much more focused scope for the Lead Steward Role and hope to see some discussion around it: \n\n\n### Role Description\nThe role of Lead Steward should have two perspectives and two types of fulfillment: one for the outside world and one for the inside world of Unlock Protocol DAO. The following clarifies further:\n\n**Outside Focus - The Role of an Official Representative**\n\n- Representation and Visibility:\nBenefit: The DAO Lead Steward acts as the face of Unlock Protocol DAO, representing it in public forums, industry conferences, and negotiations. This visibility ensures that the DAO has a consistent and professional presence, which can attract partners, investors, and new community members. Currently, the only people associated with the protocol are the team from Unlock Labs, which doesn’t create any awareness around the DAO who is supposed to run the protocol eventually.\n- Liaison for Partnerships and Collaborations:\nBenefit: By having an official representative, the DAO can facilitate smoother communications and negotiations with other organizations and projects. The Lead Steward can work on supporting the Unlock Protocol team with further establishing partnerships that align with the DAO's objectives, enhancing growth and opportunities.\n- Public Relations and Media Engagement:\nBenefit: The Lead Steward can manage interactions with the media, presenting a unified and strategic message. This role can help shape public perception and effectively manage the DAO's brand image, which, as mentioned before, not many people are currently aware of.\n\n\n**Inside Focus - Enhancing Internal Operations and Governance**\n\n- Coordination and Strategy Alignment:\nBenefit: Internally, the Lead Steward ensures that various initiatives within the DAO are well-coordinated and align with the overarching strategy. This role facilitates communication between different teams and workstreams, helping maintain focus and efficiency.\n- Governance and Decision-Making Support:\nBenefit: The Lead Steward plays a critical role in governance, helping to streamline decision-making processes and ensuring that these processes are transparent and inclusive. They can guide discussions, moderate debates, and ensure that all voices within the DAO are heard, leading to more democratic and effective outcomes.\n- Mentoring and Community Development:\nBenefit: Internally, the Lead Steward can also mentor newer members and teams, providing guidance and support. This role enhances community engagement and fosters a supportive, inclusive culture within the DAO. At the same time, DAO documentation helps facilitate a more seamless onboarding experience.\n\n\n### Qualification\n\nAs the Lead Steward, some qualification criteria that are important to fulfill this role should be in place. I bring the following skills, and these should be mandatory. That is not to say I can’t or won’t improve. Life is a continuous learning journey, and this role is no exception.\n\n- Leadership experience, ideally from working/ leading in a DAO or similar decentralized or blockchain-based organization. Experience in leading teams, coordinating projects, and guiding strategic initiatives is crucial.\n- Strong communication and interpersonal skills will act as the bridge between internal teams and external parties. The ability to articulate ideas clearly, negotiate with stakeholders, and mediate discussions will be vital. Interpersonal skills will also help build relationships and foster a collaborative environment.\n- A decent understanding of blockchain and decentralized governance will ensure that informed decisions are being made. It will also allow for discussions with a wider scope.\n- Strategic thinking and problem-solving ability to align various initiatives with the DAO's long-term goals. Problem-solving skills are also crucial, as the Lead Steward will need to address challenges that arise within the DAO and in interactions with external entities.\n- Commitment to the DAO’s Values and Vision: It’s important that the Lead Steward deeply shares the Unlock Protocol DAO's values and vision. This alignment ensures that the steward will act in the community's best interest and uphold the principles that guide the DAO’s development.\n\n\n### Responsibilities\n\nWhile the scope could always be bigger, I suggest the following key tasks for now to move forward in our collective goal to make Unlock Protocol more known:\n\n- I will continue hosting or co-hosting our weekly DAO calls and Town Halls to keep the community informed and involved in DAO activities.\n- I will keep contributing to the DAO docs with the implementation support of another member of the DAO. The docs are extremely important to ensure a more seamless onboarding experience and ensure more DAO members will join us.\n- Whenever an opportunity arises, I will facilitate communication channels between the Unlock Protocol team, the DAO, and external stakeholders, such as partners, investors, and community leaders.\n- I will regularly meet and chat with various DAO members to ensure alignment and discuss ongoing projects, proposals, issues and other concerns related to Unlock DAO.\n- I will engage with the community through our various channels (Twitter, Discord, Farcaster, and other social platforms) to gather feedback, answer questions, and foster a collaborative environment.\n- I will keep developing further proposals and execute them (if voted through successfully) to initiate long-term marketing initiatives to elevate Unlock Protocol.\n- I will keep developing further proposals and executing them (if they are voted through successfully) to provide a cleaner structure for the DAO as a respectable organization.\n\n\n### KPIs to Measure Success\nThe main KPIs I would like to suggest would also be part of my quarterly report:\n\n- DAO Call Documentation: The DAO Call documentation will help to witness that the weekly calls have been hosted and made accessible for all DAO members.\n- Partnership Development: I will track the number of new strategic partnerships and collaborations established with my support as the Lead Steward, and their impact/ quality.\n- Visibility and Representation: I will deliver evidence concerning industry conferences, public forums, and negotiations where I have been representing Unlock DAO in my capacity and track the number and reach of media interactions that effectively communicate the DAO’s message.\n- Social Media Engagement: With the support of Unlock Inc. we can use the DUNE Dashboard and Social Media channel metrics to verify the new following and rise in engagement with Unlock Protocol and its platforms.\n- Proposal Success Rate: Track the number of proposals the Lead Steward initiates, and the percentage successfully passed and implemented within a quarter.\n- Impact of Implemented Proposals: Assess the tangible outcomes and benefits derived from these proposals in terms of DAO objectives.\n- Operational Improvements: Document instances where internal processes have been improved, leading to more efficient operations or wider participation.\n- Resource Utilization: Evaluate how effectively resources (both human and financial) are allocated and used under the stewardship guidance.\n- Outreach Initiatives: Number of strategic outreach initiatives taken to enhance DAO’s presence and influence in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\n\n### Rewards & Recognition\n\n**Payment:**\nAs per the discussion I am adjusting this part of the proposal as follows:\nI am receiving 100 UDT/ month by the DAO after every month that I am staying in this position.\nAt the same time, I will receive 4.000 USDC/ month from Unlock Labs, which will subsidize this position for the moment.\nI will receive both at the end of a month to this wallet: 0xD2BC5cb641aE6f7A880c3dD5Aee0450b5210BE23\n\n**Recognition:**\nAs the Lead Steward represents the DAO, it should come with an official role recognition. The following ideas came to mind, and I would love to see them through for other roles in the future as well. These little things should also help to bring more awareness to the fact that we are a DAO:\n\n- An official post from the official Unlock Protocol social media accounts to welcome the new Lead Steward for the DAO\n- A membership NFT that will expire after I get voted out of this role or we collapse the Lead Steward role into a dedicated council role.\n- An interview via the Livestream series for Unlock Protocol.",

      "title": "Surfing on Entropy | Unlocking AI Story Based Education",
      "content": "**Our Journey**\n\nOur journey began when we were looking for a different way for storytelling to connect the fragmented online experience. There were whispers of access to sovereign communities deep into the Web3 space. Composable and modular elements that allotted the interoperability necessary to form a new phase of stories, transmission content. Configuring itself for discoverability within the ecosystem, transmission content shares the information required to achieve a fundamental perspective within the story content. Fusing lore, stories, games, and education we developed and improved our framework. A space where AI agents and achievements are unlocked and authenticated through the on-chain process of the Web3 ecosystem.&#x20;\n\nContinuing to look forward, it only makes sense for us to apply for a Unlock DAO grant, as we are currently using the Protocol for our Web3 storytelling experience called Surfing On Entropy. This project is focused on story and using AI agents and NFTs utility to move people through the experience within the Web3 modularity protocols. It involves a similar modular approach by building the audience as the story unfolds in real-time; creating within the transmission content a biosphere colony of avid supporters, creators, and developers that believe the power of story can shift perspectives and produce better opportunities through education.&#x20;\n\n**The Future** &#x20;\n\nOur current grant request is for building out the first story pod for Unlock Protocol. If the engagement criteria eclipses the our metrics then we would like to continue discussions for further grants for Phase 1 and possibly our Surfing on Entropy project. We believe this provides a clear and sustainable path towards establishing a long term partnership with Unlock Protocol and developing it's education initiatives with our platform.&#x20;\n\nLooking at the current roadmap we’ve identified 3 specific phases for development of the Web3 education story experience to determine these Unlock educational milestones:  &#x20;\n\nMonth 1 - Writing: Rubrics, story design, and instructions\n\n&#x9;⁃\tDefine Unlock Protocol topics to cover\n\n&#x9;⁃\tDesign story elements to fit within the topics\n\n&#x9;⁃\tWrite story elements and content with instructions&#x20;\n\nMonth 2 - Development: Assets\n\n&#x9;⁃\tDevelop environments and content\n\n&#x20;       ⁃\tDesign and develop AI assistants and agents\n\n&#x9;⁃\tUse AI and 3D software to immerse players into the story world\n\n&#x9;⁃\tShoot, edit and sound design for any visual content &#x20;\n\n&#x9;⁃\tDesign UI and build out story webpages&#x20;\n\nMonth 3 - Creation: NFTs and Unlocks&#x20;\n\n&#x9;⁃\tCreate NFT art\n\n&#x9;⁃\tIntegrate Unlock Protocol into website&#x20;\n\n&#x9;⁃\tBeta Test Product&#x20;\n\n&#x9;⁃\tLaunch!&#x20;\n\n**Grant Request: Unlocking Your Journey in Web3**&#x20;\n\nWe are currently super excited as the project had our first [Beta Tests](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gaVETnK5kI87nZZxwwYvEe39XjLytpbx/view?usp=sharing \"Video\") on 4/26 so we are in the final stages before launching. We look forward to gathering more feedback as we approach that time to share with everyone.&#x20;\n\nThis current grant proposal we are currently requesting 1,000 UDT and 1,000 ARB tokens to help support this project in it's current form. This will help cover the development, AI API start costs for this pod, and the costs associated with building this project and get the it over the finish line.&#x20;\n\n\n\nThanks for your consideration!&#x20;",

      "title": "Supporting Latina Blockchain Hackathon",
      "content": "### Proposal Background\n\nAs an expat, I have lived in Peru for about seven years and witnessed many shifts in the country's political ecosystem. While Peru is financially pretty stable compared to other South American countries, it has long lost its trust in the traditional governance system due to political instability. In recent years, cryptocurrencies have been adopted (probably due to political instability), but most citizens have not yet discovered Web3. \n\nHiWomenBiz is a project that supports the active discovery of Web3 and all its ingredients by setting up regular events centered around females to provide a safe space to ask questions and learn from each other. The founder, Briguit Reinaldo, is an active participant in the Web3 space and has launched the next initiative to propel specifically females in Peru forward: Latina Blockchain Hackathon.\n\nI would like Unlock DAO to support this initiative with a small retroactive price pool for those Hackathon participants who find creative solutions to incorporate Unlock Protocol into their ideas via a retroactive Quadratic Funding of 100 UDT.\n\nBefore clarifying why, I would love for you to look at Briguit’s profiles and the work she has been doing here in Peru.\n\n\n### 1 | Briguit Reinaldo\n\nBriguit is the founder of HiWomenBiz and the lead in the Latina Blockchain Hackathon initiative. In Web3, she is also well known as criptomommy.\n\nHer Profiles:\nLinkedin | https://www.linkedin.com/in/briguitreinaldo/\nX | https://twitter.com/criptomommy\nWebsite | https://briguitreinaldo.com/\n\nWebsites:\nHiWomenBiz | https://hiwomenbiz.com/\nLatina Blockchain Hackathon | https://womenbizweb3.notion.site/Latina-Blockchain-Hackathon-357c28d19b6f42529d8fe712e493a282\n\n### 2 | Why Unlock Protocol\n\nUnlock Protocol is an open-source protocol that thrives on being utilized by as many developers as possible. The more it is adopted, the higher the awareness around it.\nSouth America has been on the rise in the past few years regarding Web3, and we have a great opportunity here to take advantage of that. According to Bakkt, crypto holdings grew from 2023 to 24 by 40.23%; therefore, there is also more interest in everything related to it. Entering a market at the right moment will be good for Unlock.\nAt the same time, I personally think it would be good for us as a DAO to take a stance and promote especially initiatives that highlight minorities (in this case, women) in the fintech and Web3 space.\nThe three main projects that will receive part of the pool will become part of the DAO and can take their first steps with us in practicing DAO governance.\n\n\n### 3 | How we can implement the funding\n\nI suggest a 100 UDT prize pool for the three main projects that embed Unlock Protocol into their innovative ideas. The DAO would vote on the distribution between these three projects (previously selected by the hackathon's official jury) via Snapshot and execute via Tally as usual. \n\nBriguit will guide the winners to communicate with me directly after the hackathon is over so we can set them up for the voting proposal.",

Yet LinkedIn, the most popular channel these days to gain the attention of more Web2-anchored businesses and communities, is not being utilized. With this proposal, I want us to put out an application form for trusted individuals who see themselves running exclusively the Unlock Protocol LinkedIn account to grow our audience in this dedicated space filled with professionals from various fields to gain attraction in a space we might have neglected so far.\n\nIn the following section, I describe how I see this working, from applications and reviews to final execution. Let’s go!\n\n**Introduction:**\nUnlock Protocol stands at the forefront of decentralized access control, offering innovative solutions for memberships, subscriptions, and events through blockchain technology. Despite its significant achievements and potential, our presence on professional networks like LinkedIn is currently untapped. This proposal outlines a structured plan to rejuvenate Unlock Protocol's LinkedIn account, aiming to enhance visibility, engage the community, and showcase our accomplishments and developments.\n\n## 1 | Management Selection Process\n\n**Objective:**\nIdentify and select a trustworthy individual (ideally from the community) with a strong understanding of Unlock Protocol, excellent communication skills, a passion for blockchain technology, and a track record in handling social media accounts to manage the Unlock Protocol LinkedIn account.\n\n**Selection Process:**\nA process needs to be defined to select such a capable individual. I propose the following:\n\n* Call for Applications: Open a submission period of three weeks where interested individuals/ community members can apply for the role. The announcement should be published on all available platforms including a paragraph post.\n* Applicants should submit a brief overview of their experience with social media management, particularly on LinkedIn, along with a sample post they would want to create for Unlock on LinkedIn.\n* Evaluation Criteria:\n  // Understanding of Unlock Protocol: Demonstrates a deep understanding of our technology, mission, and community.\n  // Social Media Expertise: Proven experience in managing LinkedIn accounts, especially for technology or blockchain-oriented organizations.\n  Creativity and Engagement: The ability to identify compelling content from our existing sources that aligns with the LinkedIn audience and can be explained in a fresh way that is more suitable for the platform.\n  // Strategic Vision: Clear, innovative ideas for leveraging LinkedIn to enhance Unlock Protocol's visibility and community engagement.\n* Selection Committee: To finally select the person who will handle the Unlock Protocol Social Media, we should form a small committee comprising DAO members to review applications and select the most suitable candidate based on the outlined criteria above.\n\n## 2 | Responsibilities and Content Strategy\n\n**Objective:**\nEnsure consistent, engaging, and informative content on Unlock Protocol's LinkedIn account, reflecting our achievements, updates, and community endeavors by linking to product information and highlighting individual members.\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n* Curate and post regular updates about Unlock Protocol, provided by Unlock Labs and Unlock DAO, including technical developments, partnerships, event participation, and major milestones.\n* Highlight stories from the community, showcasing how users and partners leverage Unlock Protocol in novel ways by sourcing from existing pages such as Paragraph.xyz and Unlock’s blog as well as showcases.\n* Engage with our audience by responding to comments, facilitating discussions, and expanding our network on LinkedIn. All relevant connections should be brought to the partnership team at Unlock Labs.\n* Collaborate with the Unlock team and DAO to gather insights and content worth sharing.\n* Monthly update on the performance of the LinkedIn account and manual addition of the statistic overview to the DAO Actions Protocol.\n\nTo state this clearly, I don’t expect the responsible individual to create new content from scratch; rather, I would suggest they distribute and share already existing content with their own words and on-brand that are suitable for a platform like LinkedIn and its native audience.\n\n## 3 | Compensation and Performance Evaluation\n\n**Compensation:**\nI suggest rewarding the selected individual with 50UDT/ month. If and when growth can be traced, I suggest we use the following milestones to provide bonuses to the individual who is responsible for the accounts growth:\n\n**Bonuses for threshold reached (one time):**\n\n* 500 - 1000 followers: 100UDT\n* 1000 - 2500 followers: 150UDT\n* 2500 - 5000 followers: 200UDT\n* 5000 followers: 250UDT\n\nWith this scheme, I want to gamify the goals of this work into achievements and hope the responsible individual will see this as a desirable challenge.\n\n**Performance Evaluation:**\nTo ensure the work is being done, we should have two parameters in play:\nA monthly growth report submitted by the responsible individual that indicates growth for the following parameters:\n// Followers\n// Engagement rates (likes, comments, shares)\n// Content posting frequency.\n// Qualitative measures such as audience feedback if it stands out\n\n**Note**\nIf we don’t see any growth after regular postings in three months, we should reconsider whether this role is required.\n\n\n\nMore details: <https://discord.com/channels/462280183425138719/1227316800690327593>\n\nSnapshot: <https://snapshot.org/#/unlock-protocol.eth/proposal/0x6c8baa5fbe61f52822c6c978ae162fa6db17bdd440b75a5d0f7efa32332651c5>",

      "title": "Set Uniswap oracles for UDT and most used ERC20 tokens",
      "content": "## Goal of the proposal\n\nThis proposal sets Uniswap oracle in Unlock factory contracts across the following chains: Optimism,Polygon,Base,Arbitrum. \n  \nThe goal is twofold: 1) enable the distribution of UDT for referrers when buying keys and 2) better calculation of the Gross Network Product (GNP) by taking into accounts the most commonly used tokens.\n\n## About this proposal\n\nOn each chain, wrappers for Uniswap oracle contracts have been deployed. An oracle is used to guess the current exchange rate of a specific token pair (for instance ETH/USDC).\n\nThe same oracle contract can be used for any pairs, with the limitation that there needs to be an existing / active Uniswap pool for that pair. Three different contracts are used to query the rate for the three tiers of [Uniswap pool fees](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/protocol/fees). Fee amounts are hundredths of the basis point so 100 fee unit is 0.01%, 500 is 0.05%, and 3000 is 0.3%.\n\nFor each token, the working oracle is selected and added to the Unlock contract \nusing the `setOracle` function.\n\n## How it works\n\nThe proposal uses a cross-chain proposal pattern that, once passed, will send the calls to multiple chains at once. This pattern has been introduced and tested in a [previous proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/unlock/proposal/1926572528290918174819693611122933562560576845671089759587616947457423587439). \n\nHere, the calls for each chain have been packed with Gnosis Multicall contract to be executed at once on the destination chain.\n\n## The calls\n\nThis DAO proposal contains 11 calls:\n\n### Ethereum

      "title": "Unlock Protocol LinkedIn Takeover",
      "content": "## Proposal Background\n\nUnlock Protocol is already active on many channels to distribute awareness of the Protocol and its functionalities. Yet LinkedIn, the most popular channel these days to gain the attention of more Web2-anchored businesses and communities, is not being utilized. With this proposal, I want us to put out an application form for trusted individuals who see themselves running exclusively the Unlock Protocol LinkedIn account to grow our audience in this dedicated space filled with professionals from various fields to gain attraction in a space we might have neglected so far.\n\nIn the following section, I describe how I see this working, from applications and reviews to final execution. Let’s go!\n\n**Introduction:**\nUnlock Protocol stands at the forefront of decentralized access control, offering innovative solutions for memberships, subscriptions, and events through blockchain technology. Despite its significant achievements and potential, our presence on professional networks like LinkedIn is currently untapped. This proposal outlines a structured plan to rejuvenate Unlock Protocol's LinkedIn account, aiming to enhance visibility, engage the community, and showcase our accomplishments and developments.\n\n\n## 1 | Management Selection Process\n\n**Objective:** \nIdentify and select a trustworthy individual (ideally from the community) with a strong understanding of Unlock Protocol, excellent communication skills, a passion for blockchain technology, and a track record in handling social media accounts to manage the Unlock Protocol LinkedIn account.\n\n**Selection Process:**\nA process needs to be defined to select such a capable individual. I propose the following:\n\n- Call for Applications: Open a submission period of three weeks where interested individuals/ community members can apply for the role. The announcement should be published on all available platforms including a paragraph post. \n- Applicants should submit a brief overview of their experience with social media management, particularly on LinkedIn, along with a sample post they would want to create for Unlock on LinkedIn.\n- Evaluation Criteria: \n// Understanding of Unlock Protocol: Demonstrates a deep understanding of our technology, mission, and community.\n// Social Media Expertise: Proven experience in managing LinkedIn accounts, especially for technology or blockchain-oriented organizations.\nCreativity and Engagement: The ability to identify compelling content from our existing sources that aligns with the LinkedIn audience and can be explained in a fresh way that is more suitable for the platform.\n// Strategic Vision: Clear, innovative ideas for leveraging LinkedIn to enhance Unlock Protocol's visibility and community engagement.\n- Selection Committee: To finally select the person who will handle the Unlock Protocol Social Media, we should form a small committee comprising DAO members to review applications and select the most suitable candidate based on the outlined criteria above.\n\n\n## 2 | Responsibilities and Content Strategy\n\n**Objective:**\nEnsure consistent, engaging, and informative content on Unlock Protocol's LinkedIn account, reflecting our achievements, updates, and community endeavors by linking to product information and highlighting individual members.\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n- Curate and post regular updates about Unlock Protocol, provided by Unlock Labs and Unlock DAO, including technical developments, partnerships, event participation, and major milestones.\n- Highlight stories from the community, showcasing how users and partners leverage Unlock Protocol in novel ways by sourcing from existing pages such as Paragraph.xyz and Unlock’s blog as well as showcases. \n- Engage with our audience by responding to comments, facilitating discussions, and expanding our network on LinkedIn. All relevant connections should be brought to the partnership team at Unlock Labs.\n- Collaborate with the Unlock team and DAO to gather insights and content worth sharing.\n- Monthly update on the performance of the LinkedIn account and manual addition of the statistic overview to the DAO Actions Protocol.\n\nTo state this clearly, I don’t expect the responsible individual to create new content from scratch; rather, I would suggest they distribute and share already existing content with their own words and on-brand that are suitable for a platform like LinkedIn and its native audience.\n\n\n## 3 | Compensation and Performance Evaluation\n\n**Compensation:**\nI suggest rewarding the selected individual with 50UDT/ month. If and when growth can be traced, I suggest we use the following milestones to provide bonuses to the individual who is responsible for the accounts growth:\n\n**Bonuses for threshold reached (one time):**\n- 500 - 1000 followers: 100UDT\n- 1000 - 2500 followers: 150UDT\n- 2500 - 5000 followers: 200UDT\n- 5000 followers: 250UDT\n\nWith this scheme, I want to gamify the goals of this work into achievements and hope the responsible individual will see this as a desirable challenge.\n\n**Performance Evaluation:**\nTo ensure the work is being done, we should have two parameters in play:\nA monthly growth report submitted by the responsible individual that indicates growth for the following parameters: \n// Followers\n// Engagement rates (likes, comments, shares)\n// Content posting frequency. \n// Qualitative measures such as audience feedback if it stands out\n\n\n**Note**\nIf we don’t see any growth after regular postings in three months, we should reconsider whether this role is required.",

      "title": "Livestream Series to Elevate Unlock",
      "content": "### Proposal Background: \nUnlock Protocol offers a robust foundation for building diverse membership, subscription, and event solutions on-chain. Recognizing the need to amplify awareness and understanding of its potential, I propose launching an educational livestream series. \nThis series, aimed at shedding light on Unlock Protocol's versatility and fostering community engagement, will feature concise, engaging episodes highlighting innovation, user stories, and blockchain education. \nHosted by community members, the series seeks to inform and inspire current and future users and partners.\n\n\n### Importance & Benefits:\n\n- **Increased Awareness and Adoption:** By demystifying blockchain and showcasing practical uses of Unlock Protocol, the series can attract a wider audience, increasing protocol adoption and token utility.\n- **Community Engagement and Growth:** Regularly featuring community members and partners strengthens the ecosystem and encourages more active participation and collaboration within the Unlock community. \n- **Educational Value:** Providing valuable insights and knowledge about blockchain and Unlock Protocol empowers individuals and businesses to innovate and contributes to the growth of the broader Web3 ecosystem, moving different parts closer together.\n\n\n### Content & Title Suggestion\nAs for the content of this series, I suggest we tackle three slightly different content pillars that connect directly to our current user groups. One of them is about sharing how people innovate with the help of Unlock Protocol. Another one is about making our community the show's stars by spotlighting them, and the last one is about all the people who use Unlock for educational purposes. The pillars themselves could look like this and rotate for every episode:\n\n- **Unlocking Innovation:** Focus on the technical and creative aspects of using Unlock Protocol. Episodes can cover how users innovate on top of the protocol or how they apply the current setup in novel ways.\n- **Community Spotlights:** Highlight stories from users and partners who have successfully leveraged Unlock Protocol for memberships, subscriptions, and events. This pillar aims to showcase real-world applications and testimonials.\n- **Educational Inspiration:** Collaborate with educational projects that have integrated Unlock Protocol into their stack to offer memberships, certificates, and events to their users. This pillar can also explore expanding the topic and combining it with small nuggets of web3-related education.\n\nWhen it comes to title suggestions, I think we could use something catchy and recognizable that will have people check twice on their socials. Here are a few ideas to think about:\n- Unlock the Next Generation\n- Unlocking Tomorrow - Innovation, Community & Inspiration\n- Next Gen Unlocks: Where Protocol Meets Creativity\n- Unlocking on-chain Superpowers with Unlock Protocol\n- Chain Changers: The Unlock Protocol Story (maybe this could be a documentary at some point ;))\n- Decentralized Diary: Tales from Unlock Users\n- Unchain & Unleash: Unlock’s Innovation Guide to Freedom\n\nI hope we can use some of these ideas to iterate on with the hosts who will be interested in running this initiative.\n\n\n### KPIs to Measure Success\nHere are my four main suggestions on how to monitor success:\n\n- **Viewer Engagement Metrics:** Track live viewership numbers, replay views, likes, comments, and shares to gauge audience engagement and content resonance. \n- **Growth in Protocol Use:** Monitor increases in the number of memberships, subscriptions, and events created using Unlock Protocol following every episode via our DUNE Dashboard.\n- **Community Growth:** To measure growing interest and community engagement, measure growth in social media followers (specifically additional platforms we will directly co-stream to), Discord members, and newsletter subscribers.\n- **Focus Indicator:** Depending on the main audience we want to reach, we should decide on one primary streaming platform (e.g., YouTube) to monitor and focus growth. Currently, the Unlock Protocol YouTube channel has 711 subscribers and 79 publicly listed videos. I am sure with more regular live content and small snippets from this content, we can grow the channel by double that amount in less than five months.\n\nAll of these measures should be documented after each session and be collected in a dedicated spreadsheet to observe the impact over time.\n\n\n### Suggested Qualification Criteria/ Audition\nTo elevate Unlock Protocol and UDT appropriately with this initiative, I suggest we run a small yet efficient audition among the wider community of Unlock Protocol. For the audition task (and after checking back with ccarfi as he has experience with this) I suggest the following:\n\n**Audition Task: \"Your Unlock Moment\"**\nTask Overview:\nApplicants are invited to submit a short video, 1-3 minutes in length, where they share a simplified explanation or a personal story related to one of the three content pillars of Unlock Protocol (Unlocking Innovation, Community Spotlights, Educational Inspiration). The aim is for applicants to demonstrate their ability to engage an audience while conveying the essence and potential of Unlock Protocol in an accessible and captivating way.\n\n**Submission Requirements:**\nlong as applicants feel comfortable their short submission video would be uploaded to publicly accessible and currently utilized social media platforms (YouTube, X, Farcaster, etc.) for the wider community to see and participate in the final selection process.  An mp4 video file should also be saved so that this video can be uploaded to applicable Unlock Protocol channels if the community selects you to be a LiveStream Co-Host.\n\n**Task Components:**\n\n- **Select Your Pillar:** Choose one of the three pillars that resonates most with you or where you feel you can make the most substantial connection with the audience.\n- **Craft Your Story or Explanation:** \n// Unlocking Innovation: Explain a complex aspect of Unlock Protocol using a simple analogy or personal insight that showcases its innovative potential.\n// Community Spotlights: Share a brief story about a community member or partner who has creatively used Unlock Protocol, emphasizing the impact it had.\n// Educational Inspiration: Describe a compelling use case of Unlock Protocol in an educational setting, simplifying its benefits and potential to revolutionize learning and access.\n- **Presentation Style:** Ensure your video captures your enthusiasm, clarity of explanation, and ability to connect with viewers. Use props, visual aids, or creative storytelling to make your point more vivid and memorable.\n\n**Evaluation Criteria:**\n\n- **Creativity and Engagement:** How effectively you use storytelling, analogies, or visual aids to make your content engaging and relatable.\n- **Clarity of Communication:** Your ability to break down complex concepts into understandable segments without losing the viewer’s interest.\n- **Authenticity and Enthusiasm:** The genuine passion and energy you bring to the topic, which is crucial for keeping the audience engaged and interested in learning more.\n- **Alignment with Unlock Protocol's Vision:** How well your content aligns with the goals and values of Unlock Protocol, showcasing its potential to revolutionize access, innovation, and community building.\n\nIdeally, our candidate(s) fulfill also the following criteria:\n\n- has livestream experience \n- owns decent equipment and checks \n- has social/ communication and people skills\n- knows Unlock Protocol/ is already part of the wider Unlock Protocol community\n\nThis series should be held weekly, so people will want to add it to their calendars. Having at least two different regular hosts would be required. It might also add a diversity factor, as we could consider running it in two languages. With blockchain and crypto’s most recent endeavors in the Latam market, I think it is time to spread information about Unlock Protocol in Spanish and discover an entirely new audience!\n\n\n### Suggested UDT Reward/ Session:\nTo make it fair yet worthwhile for hosts to apply and commit to this, I think they should be rewarded with 50 UDT/ per session held. \nThe reason is that the Unlock YouTube channel currently falls under the small streaming tier. As the hosts help grow the channel, I suggest we raise their pay accordingly over time. This article by Streamyard was a helpful reference.",

[Checkout arbitrum docs for more info.](https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging).\n    \n    Thank you!\n    ",

      "content": "We have successfully concluded the 7k ARB Unlock X Arbitrum Grants round on Grants Stack. We saw 21 projects, some being first-time users of Unlock get rewarded for building with us. Overall it was a well-received experiment in retro grant funding and even caught the attention of Arbitrum.  We saw a direct correlation between this round, and increased usage of Unlock on Arbitrum. \n\nWhile it was discussed in the original proposal, we wanted to bring it to snapshot, while adding in a retro payment for blahkheart for all his hard work in helping us access the Arb tokens. Collectively we've been working on this grants program since Dec, and are very happy with the results.\n\nSome of our stats:\n![Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 1.02.35 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreicc6bter4gdkxxk77xf5jlkvz4fj6p56nteezzx7ghpjflsxxdl44)\n \n![Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 1.01.31 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreigtogrr3ava63mckm4qgxdxwamj7yjmb76fcehicmqjfoo36vuc4e)\n    \n\nAs stated in the proposal you can find here -https://unlock.community/t/funding-unlock-protocol-s-ecosystem-using-retroqf-grants-gitcoins-grants-stack/494\nthe industry standard Grants Stack Round Manager fee is 10% of the total matching pool. We did extra work, but because we are also DAO contributors we will keep the amount at 10%. This would equal 700 ARB. This is a retroactive payment as the round has already concluded.\n\nWe also wish to to retroactively pay blahkheart 500 ARB for his work on helping us access the ARB tokens - Arbitrum L1 to L2 Messaging (aka Retryable tickets). Unlock DAO collectively holds 75,000 ARB tokens. \n\nWe are looking to add this proposal into the 7k Grants Round Payout (which goes directly to funding the smart contract which will then directly pay grantees), to make it easier for delegates to vote, and not spend double the gas fees. This would bring the final proposal on Tally to 8200 ARB tokens.\n\n*please note no UDT will be used or transferred.",

      "content": "As many active contributors in Unlock DAO I felt that the current process for receiving a snippet of the monthly retroactive funding was not based on fair rules/ guidelines/ conditions.\n\nI observed and collected suggestions from everyone how to improve that process. Instead of changing the entire process the idea is to modify it and therefore improve the level of fairness.\n\nFollowing I present the new guidelines and process. The idea is to vote on this as a proposal to make it official and turn it into a part of the Unlock DAO Docs, which in return should also add to an overall easier onboarding process for new DAO members.\n\n---------------------------\n\n## Unlock DAO RetroQF Guidelines\n\nUnlock DAO values contributions made by DAO and community members of Unlock Protocol.\nTo acknowledge these contributions we would like to continue distributing 100UDT/ month to active contributors along the following guidelines:\n\n- Please avoid nominating yourself if possible.\n- If you nominate yourself please submit evidence of your contribution: via a URL, on-chain evidence or an image/ screenshot\n- Please nominate one or more people from the community to acknowledge their contributions and provide reason as to why you are nominating them.\n- If you were nominated please make sure to add your evidence to the thread\n- The DAO's Timelock address should always be added in case people think that not the total amount should be spent in a month.\n\n\n## Monthly Retro QF Process\nThe following 7 steps are required to complete the monthly retroactive funding process. It can be initiated by any member of the DAO!\n\n1️⃣  Open a conversation on Discourse\n2️⃣  Nominate and/ or be nominated (already including the evidence)\n3️⃣  Submit evidence of your contribution\n4️⃣  Open an official proposal on Snapshot in which additionally the Unlock DAO Timelock is being added in case people don't feel all the tokens should be given out and rather return to the DAO\n5️⃣  Make sure to cast your votes in a fair manner and distribute among different members who have submitted evidence\n6️⃣  Open the execution of the vote on Tally\n7️⃣  Agree or disagree on the distribution\n\n---------------------------\nIf quorum is reached I will commit to do the following:\n\n- Turn this into a part of the documentation listed here: https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock/tree/master/docs/docs/governance/grants-bounties\n- Mint our second Community Artifact to celebrate another little milestone :)!\n\nPS:\nI was happy to see that some people already adopted the new guidelines in our latest discourse opened by Rwalls here: https://unlock.community/t/retroactive-funding-march-2024/509",

      "content": "### Description\n\nOur idea is to build a no-code frame generator tooling which can allow any non-tech person to create the frames on the go for functionality of airdropping.\nWe are adding the layer of engagement/participation to it, which means one people who attended the certain meeting can claim the NFT which we airdrop them using Unlock Protocol\nExample PoC: https://warpcast.com/ramitphi/0xa4dab4ed\n(around 50+ people claimed)\n\n### Website URL\n\nhttps://huddle01.com/\n\n### Twitter\n\n@phi_ramit\n\n### Github\n\nhttps://github.com/Huddle01\n\n### LinkedIn\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ramit-agarwal-46547316b/\n\n### Discord handle\n\nramitphi\n\n### Completion time\n\n3 weeks\n\n### Team\n\nTeam Details\n\nAyush Ranjan (CEO) :  https://www.linkedin.com/in/ranjan18/\nSusmit Lavania(CTO) : https://www.linkedin.com/in/susmit-lavania-4b9558107/\nDaria Saji (Product Manager): https://www.linkedin.com/in/dariasaji/\nRamit Agarwal( Tech PM):https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramit-agarwal-46547316b/\n\n### Milestones\n\nMilestone 1 (200 UDT)\n- User able to login\n- Able to upload image of their choice which will be minted as NFT\n- Able to deploy the lock\n\nMilestone 2 (300UDT)\n- Frame creator button\n- People can create the frame in one click\n- They get an unique link which they can embed it in their casts\n\n\n### Requested grant amount\n\nOther amount, or not requesting UDT\n\n### Anything else you think we should know, including why you've requested a particular grant amount\n\nWe are requesting for 500 UDT as we believe working with frames would require certain expertise and added dev hours with their learning curve. On the other side, we believe it will be viral product as it solves out the problem of most of the community manager to handle NFT drops.\nWe will be also sponsoring gas fees for claim process,  to provide the gas-less experience to the end user\n\nUser Flow: https://huddle01.notion.site/No-Code-Frame-Builder-4225a8a1fcc64de8b3c01b888a9d7bca?pvs=4\n\n### Is your work Open Source\n\nNo, my project does not use an Open Source license",

      "title": "Application for Lead Steward of Unlock DAO",
      "content": "Dear Unlock DAO Community,\n\nI am expressing my keen interest in the Lead Steward role at Unlock DAO, as discussed on our Discord server. With a background in guiding a continuously decentralizing community at The ALANA Project and expertise in complex system design, I am eager to contribute to the innovation within a community-driven environment like Unlock DAO.\n\nMy professional journey spans over 10 years in the creative industries, including fashion, 3D asset creation, and game development. Design as a discipline stands apart from art as it continuously tries to solve problems instead of prioritizing personal expression. The global ambition to unravel the mysteries of governance has, in my opinion, remained unsolved until today. This is where Web3 truly captured my interest, and I joined the Token Engineering Academy to study complex system design. Throughout my studies, I started to innovate on some of the lessons I learned and, after proposing them, successfully integrated them into The ALANA Project.\n\nMy journey has been characterized by leading small teams, project management, fostering community engagement, and garnering official recognition for my design work. Nevertheless, I am convinced that good design has a long-lasting impact and requires collective input. As I aspire to take on the role of Lead Steward at Unlock DAO, my goal is to prove that theory and make it become a reality for the ongoing growth and prosperity of Unlock DAO and the Protocol.\n\nMy leadership philosophy in decentralized settings is grounded in inclusivity, transparency, and collective decision-making. I firmly believe that the strength of a DAO resides in the diversity of its members and the collaborative spirit that propels it forward. As Lead Steward, I am committed to fostering an environment where every member not only feels valued but also empowered to contribute meaningfully.\n\nAttached to this letter, I drafted a plan stating my commitments and expectations if you elect me as your Lead Steward of Unlock DAO.\n\nSincerely,\nStella\n\nAttachments:\n- Curriculum Vitae Stella Achenbach\n- Analysis, Commitments & Expectations\nLink: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DZB_pPycCrOMkXc7bIZGK4aWV1Rm1gkB9rWHmCnkPY8/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThe choices given are:\nYes - I want Stella as our Lead Steward to propel Unlock DAO forward\nNo - I don't want Stella as our Lead Steward",

      "title": "Upgrade protocol: switch to Unlock v13 and PublicLock v14",
      "content": "## Goal of the proposal\n\nThis is a proposal for an upgrade of the core Unlock Protocol smart contracts - with the new Unlock Version (v13) and PublicLock version (v14). \n\n## About the upgrade\n\nThis upgrade includes improved mechanics for UDT token governance, several improvements in existing features, gas optimisations and bug fixes. The main novelty is the new “swap and burn” feature that will allow fees collected by the protocol to directly decrease the supply of UDT in circulation. A `SwapBurner` helper contract has been deployed on mainnet and polygon and will added as setting to the main Unlock contract on both chains.\n\n## A cross-chain proposal\n\nThe proposal uses a cross-chain proposal pattern that, once passed, will deploy the upgrade on multiple chains at once.

All calls are sent to the Connext bridge at 0x8898B472C54c31894e3B9bb83cEA802a5d0e63C6 on mainnet, except the 3 mainnet ones that are directly targeted at the Unlock factory contract.

This transfer is a necessary step towards the end goal: migrate the current V2 liquidty position to the UDT/WETH Uniswap v3 pool (without risking a sandwich attack during the migration).\n\n\n### Current situation of the UDT/WETH V2 pool \n\nAddress: 0x9cA8AEf2372c705d6848fddA3C1267a7F51267C1\n\n#### DAO's liquidity tokens in V2 pool\n\n- total : 85116245781832601704\n- **to transfer:85116245781832601704**\n\nFor reference, the total DAO's liquidity in V2 pool is 2117.913872974150943852 UDT and 18.76683586595037034 WETH.\n\n\n### About the proposal\n\nThe proposal contains a single call to the v2 pool `transfer` function that will transfer half of that liquidity tokens to the multisig - `transfer(0xc3F2bcBE6fB42faC83dd8a42893C6c0B3809e070,85116245781832601704)`.\n\nOnce approved and executed, the tokens will be transferred. The 5 signers of the multisig will take care of migrating the v2 position to the v3 pool.\n\nThank you!\nThe Unlock Team",

      "title": "Asking for 7k in ARB to help Fund Unlock Protocol’s Ecosystem via Grants Stack",
      "content": "This proposal requests to use 7k in Arb tokens given to Unlock Protocol Labs by ArbitrumDAO to run a retroQF round on Grants Stack, to help incentivize AND reward builders using Unlock Protocol in an open, transparent, and democratic way. Our goal is to help fund at least 20 projects with this funding. If successful we will look to run more rounds (every 1-2 quarters) to help encourage builders, creators, and communities to use Unlock Protocol. \n\nThis proposal was inspired by conversations during the open DAO community calls over the last few months, and further discussions were had in the #Unlock-DAO discord channel as well as on the community forum to help craft this proposal. Those discussions included: blahkheart - stellaachenbach - lanzdingz - Julien | Ʉnlock - ccarfi | Ʉnlock - ramitphi - Victorius - Zet | Cyberfallout  - Wonderwomancode\n\nWe will leverage QF funding mechanisms to help retroactively fund projects that the community deems valuable to the Unlock Ecosystem. If you have seen or been a part of a Gitcoin round, this is the same process, just with a focus on the Unlock Protocol Ecosystem.\n\nOnly projects and teams who have integrated and used Unlock Protocol in a meaningful and impactful way will be eligible. \n\nThis is a temperature check and if this proposal passes, we will move to DAO vote. If rejected we will take into account community feedback and update the proposal. You can find more on this topic/ current discussions in the forum - https://unlock.community/t/funding-unlock-protocol-s-ecosystem-using-retroqf-grants-gitcoins-grants-stack/494\n\nSome eligibility criteria to be eligible for the round:\n\n- Must have integrated Unlock Protocol into their project or used Unlock for ticketing\n- Must be deployed on Arbtrium (can vote on this separately if we need) \n- Must disclose amount of NFTs/Certifications/memberships/tickets minted (and point to proof) 50 mints (total) min as an example\n- Needs to write a brief description/how the project positively impacted the Unlock Community and therefore is eligible for the round\n- This is retro funding, meaning the project needs to have already been launched/the event has already happened \n-link in social profiles\n- link github repo (if they have it)\n- share info on their team (are they solo or a group)\n- tweet about the round/unlock protocol \n\nWe will verify to criteria before approving projects to participate in the round + there is gitcoin passport enabled to help ensure the round isn’t sybil attacked. \n\nAlso proposing a 20% matching cap - what this means is that any 1 project can only acquire a max of 20% of the total matching pool (Example - if the matching pool is 8000 in ARB, a project can only receive a max of 1600 ARB in matching funds) this ensures that more projects can be rewarded vs 1-2 larger projects capturing all the matching pool (this also helps with social collusion)\n\nWe want to find a way to meaningfully reward projects that have used Unlock for ticketing/ memberships and events, and projects that have integrated Unlock Protocol within their tech stack, in a fair way, at scale, and in public.\n\nTLDR; We reward projects using Unlock Protocol and Unlock Protocol is rewarded through increased usage, transactions and ecosystem growth.\n\nROI and benefits for the DAO/Unlock Ecosystem: Our goal is to help reward at least 20 projects that have meaningfully used Unlock Protocol.\n\n- Allows us to encourage more builders, creators, teams, and projects to integrate Unlock’s tech stack into their projects, without needing to individually fund every grant ourselves\n- Unlock Protocol makes money from % fees generated through cc ticket sales, this helps encourage more teams to use Unlock for ticketing, subscriptions etc creating a positive feedback loop\n- This is a democratic way to give out retro grant funds to projects supporting the protocol and our ecosystem/DAO by extension\n- This opens up another grant-giving module that doesn’t require as much upfront energy and time from the DAO, but that still ensures the community helps determine which projects are the most deserving of retro grant funds\n- Only projects already using Unlock with be able to apply - a way to incentivize projects to integrate Unlock before the next QF round (a reason we will announce multiple rounds)\n- Allows all community members who wish to participate a chance vote through their donation (even $1 goes a long way with matching funds) * this also allows projects to raise more funds without the DAO needing to provide all of those funds\n- If successful we can continue with this grant-giving process and look for other ways to raise matching funds\n- This is a tested and proven funding model/system\n\nGitcoin has proven through various cycles that funding your ecosystem has win-win outcomes. It is what Vitalik used to build the ETH ecosystem in the last bear market, funding $50m worth of projects in the ETH ecosystem.\n\nNow it’s available to use for any DAO. This proposal is to use the same tools to build Unlock Protocol’s ecosystem in this current market, without needing to use a high amount of treasury funds.\n\nHow it works:\nThe idea behind this is to run a  smaller, but still meaningful round to help grow awareness, promote Unlock Proctocols tech stack and reward past projects. \n\nOur goal is to then use this to help incentivize more projects to build with Unlock, with a focus on having more projects use Unlock Protocol for ticketing during ETHDevner. This will then continue with future web3 events. We will build a narrative that helps promote the awareness that Unlock Protocol DAO will be rewarding projects using our tech stack.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicvdiqclnme5devfrz5lsezefwgthrn77kyn4dbyamvq2oh5cnsza)\n   \n\nNext steps:\n\nOnce passed we will create the round criteria and get feedback from Unlock DAO  and the community to ensure it aligns with the goals of the DAO and Unlock Protocol as a whole. We already have the green light that Unlock’s Marketing Team aka Chris with help us promote this and we’ll work together to make it a success.\n\nWe will apply to see if we can receive further funding from the Arbitrum Matching fund. [*Arbitrum is also incentivizing communities who run rounds on Arbitrum with increased matching funds. If this proposal is approved we will apply with the hopes of increasing our matching pool funds = more $ for Unlock community builders/creators\n\nFrom there we will begin marketing and creating the resources needed to get the round started. The goal is to launch the round and have grantees be applying just as EthDenver is ending, with the round concluding mid March. This will give us enough time to not only promote the round for projects already building with us, but with an emphasis on rewarding projects that use Unlock for ticketing during EthDenver. \n\nWe will verify to criteria before approving projects to participate in the round + there is gitcoin passport enabled to help ensure the round isn’t sybil attacked. \n\nThere will be a 20% matching cap - what this means is that any 1 projects can only acquire a max of 20% of the total matching pool (For example - if the matching pool is 7000 in ARB, a project can only receive a max of 1400 ARB in matching funds) this ensures that more projects can be rewarded vs 1-2 larger projects capturing all the matching pool (this also helps with social sybil collusion)\n\nWe will begin to track and measure the success/impact of this initiative (see forum post for more info)\n\nUpside: Jumpstart our ecosystem flywheel that creates value for the Unlock Protocol ecosystem in a way that rewards projects, creators, and teams that are helping drive Unlock Protocol usage forward.\n\nRisks: The round doesn’t yield our desired results of gaining enough traction and rewarding enough builders/creators. *which is also why we’re asking for a small amount of 7k ARB to test it out (Unlock Labs was given 75k ARB). Our goal would be to have 20+ projects in this round receiving funding.",

      "content": "### Goal of the proposal\n\nThis proposal aims at moving 50% of the liquidity tokens owned by the DAO in [Uniswap V2 UDT/WETH pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9ca8aef2372c705d6848fdda3c1267a7f51267c1) to a [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc3F2bcBE6fB42faC83dd8a42893C6c0B3809e070) owned by trustees . This transfer is a necessary step towards the end goal: migrate the current V2 liquidty position to the UDT/WETH Uniswap v3 pool (without risking a sandwich attack during the migration).\n\n\n### Current situation of the UDT/WETH V2 pool \n\nAddress: 0x9ca8aef2372c705d6848fdda3c1267a7f51267c1\n\n#### DAO's liquidity tokens in V2 pool\n\n- total : 170232491563665203407\n- **to transfer:85116245781832601703**\n\nFor reference, the total DAO's liquidity in V2 pool is 5469.923439376863397507 UDT and 28.71409951822553882 WETH.\n\n\n### About the proposal\n\nThe proposal contains a single call to the v2 pool `transfer` function that will transfer half of that liquidity tokens to the multisig - `transfer(0xc3F2bcBE6fB42faC83dd8a42893C6c0B3809e070,85116245781832601703)`.\n\nOnce approved and executed, the tokens will be transferred. The 5 signers of the multisig will take care of migrating the v2 position to the v3 pool.\n\nThank you!\nThe Unlock Team",

      "content": "This DAO proposal aims at testing the new cross-chain governance process of Unlock Protocol's DAO. This new governance \nprotocol allow proposals to propagate directly from the main DAO contract to protocol contracts on other chains.\n\n# How it works\n\nTo reach another chain, all calls go though the [Connext bridge](https://www.connext.network/) and are \nexecuted on the other side of the bridge, after a period of cooldown.\n\nThe workflow is as follows\n\n1. A DAO proposal is created, containing 1 call per chain.\n2. If the vote succeeds, the DAO proposal is executed. All calls are sent to the bridge.\n3. Each call crosses the bridge seperately towards its destination on a specific chain.\n4. The call is received on the destination chain by the Unlock multisig.\n5. Once received, the call is held in the multisig for a period of X days, during which it can be cancelled.\n6. Once the cooldown period ends, the call is executed.\n\nNB: The cooldown period is useful to prevent malicious or errored calls from being executed. \n\n\n# This proposal\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to test this new cross-chain workflow. Here, we are sending instructions\nfrom this DAO to the Unlock core contract on other chains. This is a common case used in protocol upgrades\nor protocol settings changes.\n\nHere we don't do anything out of the ordinary, just a simple transfer of native tokens on each chain to the zero \naddress. By burning a small amount of tokens, we just aim at proving that the process is sound \nand actually works in practice.\n\n# The calls\n\nAll calls are sent to the Connext bridge at 0x8898B472C54c31894e3B9bb83cEA802a5d0e63C6 on chain 1:\n\n- `transferTokens(1000000000135)` to 0x99b1348a9129ac49c6de7F11245773dE2f51fB0c on chain Optimism (10)\n- `transferTokens(1000000000135)` to 0xeC83410DbC48C7797D2f2AFe624881674c65c856 on chain BNB Chain (56)\n- `transferTokens(1000000000135)` to 0x1bc53f4303c711cc693F6Ec3477B83703DcB317f on chain Gnosis Chain (100)\n- `transferTokens(1000000000135)` to 0xE8E5cd156f89F7bdB267EabD5C43Af3d5AF2A78f on chain Polygon (137)\n- `transferTokens(1000000000135)` to 0x1FF7e338d5E582138C46044dc238543Ce555C963 on chain Arbitrum (42161)\n\n\nOnwards !\n\nThe Unlock Protocol Team\n",

      "content": "Good day, members of the unlock community.\nAs part of our grant proposal, I kindly ask you for feedback on our application.\n\nWe are requesting 300UDT to support the localization of Unlock membership and ticketing flow for the Japanese market.\n\nBeyondClub is already leveraging Unlock Protocol to support Japanese clients and partners with our no-code web3 loyalty platform. \nhttps://beyondclub.xyz\n\nWe were also selected for the Unlock retroactive funding in April 2023. (as Yuki / yuki_xyz)\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/unlock-protocol.eth/proposal/0xf0e392d073c803c78128b55a09a43d0c0952e2dc764f6a5f5541e321d4f6b1d1\n However, we’d like to further localize these efforts for a more seamless membership NFT and ticketing system for Japanese users.\n\nAs the Japanese government recently launched a new grant program for big events to use NFT tickets, we believe this can be a great opportunity to expand the Unlock ecosystem to the Japanese market. (We had the press release with Unlock, to support events that want to apply for this government grant.) https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000018.000080182.html\n\nThis grant will enable us to:\n* Translate the Unlock membership system into Japanese inside beyondClub product, ensuring that the user experience is seamless and user-friendly.\n* Localize the NFT ticketing system for event organizers and participants launching as ticket.beyondclub.xyz\n* Making the localized event ticketing system as open source\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include focusing on community-building and fan empowerment through gamification. Unlike traditional membership programs, we aim to foster genuine relationships between brands and their audiences, creating a sense of belonging and identity within the community.\n\nMore details: https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock/issues/12717",

      "title": "Extend Unlock DAO to EIP-4824",
      "content": "## TL;DR\nThis proposal, if passed, will execute the transaction specified below, making Unlock DAO EIP-4824 compliant. No changes to the Unlock protocol's governance/smart contracts and no transfer of funds are involved with this proposal. \n\nThe EIP-4824 standard has already been embraced by the likes of Snapshot, Aragon, Optimism, etc. DAOstar, with the help of a recent grant from Optimism, has built a daoURI for Unlock DAO. \n\nA Snapshot proposal on Unlock DAO adopting EIP-4824 [passed unanimously](https://snapshot.org/#/unlock-protocol.eth/proposal/0x017a44e56f8cd7018aa336da084c429e36eb11f95ffb101562a44126598551ab)\n\n## ABSTRACT\n\nThe EIP-4824 standard defines common interfaces for DAOs via daoURI, akin to tokenURI for NFTs. This proposal will extend Unlock DAO to EIP-4824 by deploying a new registration contract through a contract interaction with the EIP-4824 factory maintained by DAOstar.\n\n## MOTIVATION\n\nThe absence of a global DAO interface has been holding back the ecosystem for a long time. New DAOs, and DAO frameworks have zero visibility on aggregators, most tooling providers have a hard time integrating with different DAO architectures, there is no comprehensive, self-maintaining registry for DAO data, etc. EIP-4824 aims to solve the above issues by providing a method for DAOs to self-publish information irrespective of their architecture or the chain they exist on.\n\nAdopting the EIP-4824 standard will enrich the on-chain information availability of Unlock’s governance contracts, making it easier for existing and future DAO tools to seamlessly interact with the contracts. A specific example is enabling members to interact with the Unlock DAO governance contracts through different front-end interfaces, potentially across multiple chains. Some of the tools that are digesting or committed to digesting this enriched information include Snapshot, Tally, Etherscan, DeepDAO, and other members of DAOstar One.\n\n- EIP-4824 has gained traction with industry leaders such as Snapshot (in Snapshot X), Aragon V3, Moloch V3, DAODAO, and Aave.\n- We are proud to announce that we recently secured a $100k grant from Optimism to promote EIP-4824 adoption among DAOs.\n- ShapeShift DAO recently [passed a proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/shapeshiftdao.eth/proposal/0xa0961a1710084fa076d2f774dade6fcede92941d0f12d5c3eac0aaeaa6e6a059) to adopt EIP-4824\n- Importantly, adopting this standard does not necessitate any fund transfers from Unlock or alterations to its current smart contracts. It simply involves deploying a registration contract to store Unlock’s daoURI. With the support from the Optimism grant, DAOstar will assist in crafting the required daoURI for Unlock DAO.\n\nDAOstar (https://daostar.org/) is a non-profit that builds standards and public infrastructure for DAOs. We are supported by the Ethereum Foundation, Gnosis, Optimism Collective, The Graph, Aragon, and other members of DAOstar One (https://daostar.one/). Both Snapshot and Tally, which Unlock DAO uses in its governance, along with 80+ key organizations in the DAO ecosystem, are active members of the DAOstar One Roundtable.\n\n## SPECIFICATION\n\nIf passed, Unlock DAO will upgrade to EIP-4824 by calling the EIP-4824 registration contract located at 0x2Dac5DBbF1D024c1E0D9c92D3AeDa7618e15aDd7 on Ethereum Mainnet, setting the timelock contract as its admin. No funds will be transferred.\n\nThe registration contract exposes a daoURI view function which returns the URI containing the EIP-4824 compliant registration JSON document. \n\nThis proposal will execute the following call to 0x2Dac5DBbF1D024c1E0D9c92D3AeDa7618e15aDd7 on Ethereum Mainnet to complete the registration:\n\n`Call EIP4824RegistrationSummoner.summonRegistration(salt, daoURI,manager, contracts, data)`\n\nNew clones are deployed to predictable addresses using the message sender and a bytes32 value combined as a salt.\n\n**Note**: In the Snapshot proposal that was passed, the address used for the EIP-4824 Registration Summoner was 0x37df3fc47c1c3a2acafd2dad9c1c00090a8655bc. In this proposal, we have updated it to 0x2Dac5DBbF1D024c1E0D9c92D3AeDa7618e15aDd7 due to improvements made to the Registration Summoner, including the addition of an EIP4824 Index contract. Although these are essentially very similar contracts, we recommend that the Unlock core team verifies their validity before executing this transaction, should the proposal pass. You can view the full list of contract deployments at https://github.com/metagov/daostar.\n\n### Metadata\n\n- `salt =  0x42`\n- `daoURI =   https://api.daostar.org/immutable/QmPNuPryf8axzDj1kqAQ7wU5VaBUjhM88AyDZpqaTTN2fL`\n- `manager = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`\n- `contracts = [ ]`\n- `data = [ ]`\n\nThe daoURI suggested above is stored on IPFS. Its subURIs- membersURI & proposalsURI, are dynamic. We currently use the Snapshot API to query proposals and the Boardroom API to query voters. This data is not being stored anywhere. \n\nTo create a new daoURI, visit the DAOstar Register Page. You can, for example, change the daoURI to point it to a new governance document or edit the membersURI. The register service outputs daoURIs in this format: https://api.daostar.org/immutable/<CID>, in which <CID> is the IPFS CID of the daoURI. \n\nThe DAO has the option to assign a manager during registration, potentially delegating to a relevant multisig within the DAO/Unlock Labs to streamline the management of the daoURI. This assignment can also be deferred, with the option to appoint a manager/admin later. For the purposes of this proposal, it is assumed that neither a manager nor additional admins will be designated initially; the DAO will make these decisions as needed in the future. Since the manager field cannot be left blank, it will be set to 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 during registration.\n\n\n## ROLES AND ACCESS CONTROL\nOnly two actions are possible in the registration contract: (1) changing daoURI and (2) changing the role structure.\n\nA manager can modify the daoURI but not the roles while an admin can modify both the daoURI & the role structure.\n\nDuring registration, the admin role is granted to the DAO.\n\n## DEPLOYMENT DETAILS\nThe registration factory contract is deployed to nearly all EVM chains. The mainnet address is 0x2Dac5DBbF1D024c1E0D9c92D3AeDa7618e15aDd7.\n\nNew clones are deployed to predictable addresses using the message sender and a bytes32 value combined as a salt.\n\n## RISKS\nThe proposal is extremely low risk. It involves calling a factory that will deploy a new, standalone registration contract on behalf of Unlock DAO. The sole purpose of that contract is to publish a daoURI field on behalf of the main Unlock contract(s).",

      "title": "Extend Unlock DAO to EIP-4824",
      "content": "##TL;DR\nThis proposal, if passed, will set Unlock DAO up for adopting EIP-4824, a metadata standard for DAOs. Adopting EIP-4824 involves deploying a registration contract to hold Unlock DAO's daoURI. No changes to Unlock protocol's governance/smart contracts, no trasfer of funds are involved with this proposal.\n\nThe EIP-4824 standard has already been embraced by the likes of Snapshot, Aragon, Optimism, etc. DAOstar, with the help of a recent grant from Optimism, will help build a daoURI for Unlock DAO.\n\n\n##ABSTRACT\n\nThe EIP-4824 standard defines common interfaces for DAOs via daoURI, akin to tokenURI for NFTs. This proposal will extend Unlock DAO to EIP-4824 by deploying a new registration contract through a contract interaction with the EIP-4824 factory maintained by DAOstar.\n\n\n##MOTIVATION\n\nThe absence of a global DAO interface has been holding back the ecosystem for a long time. New DAOs, DAO frameworks have zero visibility on aggregators, most tooling providers have a hard time integrating with different DAO architectures, there is no comprehensive, self-maintaining registry for DAO data, etc. EIP-4824 aims to solve the above issues by providing a method for DAOs to self-publish information irrespective of their architecture or the chain they exist on.\n\nAdopting the EIP-4824 standard will enrich the on-chain information availability of Unlock’s governance contracts, making it easier for existing and future DAO tools to seamlessly interact with the contracts. A specific example is enabling members to interact with the Unlock DAO governance contracts through different front-end interfaces, potentially across multiple chains. Some of the tools that are digesting or committed to digesting this enriched information include Snapshot, Tally, Etherscan, DeepDAO, and other members of DAOstar One.\n\n1. EIP-4824 has gained traction with industry leaders such as Snapshot (in Snapshot X), Aragon V3, Moloch V3, DAODAO, and Aave.\n2. We are proud to announce that we recently secured a $100k grant from Optimism to promote EIP-4824 adoption among DAOs.\n3. Importantly, adopting this standard does not necessitate any fund transfers from Unlock or alterations to its current smart contracts. It simply involves deploying a registration contract to store Unlock’s daoURI. With the support from the Optimism grant, DAOstar will assist in crafting the required daoURI for Unlock DAO.\n\nDAOstar (https://daostar.org/) is a non-profit that builds standards and public infrastructure for DAOs. We are supported by the Ethereum Foundation, Gnosis, Optimism Collective, The Graph, Aragon and other members of DAOstar One (https://daostar.one/). Both Snapshot and Tally, that Unlock DAO uses in its governance, along with 80+ key organizations in the DAO ecosystem, are active members of the DAOstar One Roundtable. \n\n\n##SPECIFICATION\n\nIf passed, Unlock DAO will upgrade to EIP-4824 by calling the EIP-4824 registration contract located at 0x37df3fc47c1c3a2acafd2dad9c1c00090a8655bc, setting a DAO owned contract as its admin. No funds will be transferred.\n\nThe registration contract exposes a daoURI view function which returns the URI containing the EIP-4824 compliant registration JSON document. During registration, the DAO may set a relevant multi-sig/working group as a manager, to more conveniently manage the daoURI. \n\nThis proposal will execute the following call to complete the registration:\n\nCall EIP4824RegistrationSummoner.summonRegistration(salt, daoURI,manager, contracts, data)\n\nNew clones are deployed to predictable addresses using the message sender and a bytes32 value combined as a salt.\n\n##ROLES AND ACCESS CONTROL\nThere are only two actions possible in the registration contract: (1) changing daoURI and (2) changing the role structure.\n\nA manager can modify the daoURI but not the roles while an admin can modify both the daoURI & the role structure.\n\nDuring registration, admin role is granted to the DAO. \n\n##DEPLOYMENT DETAILS\nThe registration factory contract is deployed to nearly all EVM chains. The mainnet address is 0x37dF3fC47C1c3A2acaFd2Dad9c1C00090a8655Bc.\n\nNew clones are deployed to predictable addresses using the message sender and a bytes32 value combined as a salt.\n\n##SIMULATION RESULTS\nGiven a salt of 0x42 and a msg.sender of the Unlock Timelock, the registration contract is successfully deployed to 0xec9d904e7ff0a70f0dd95e7e95c01e32544a0043. \n![Screenshot 2023-09-07 at 11.03.56 AM.png](ipfs://bafybeifilf7lfzwzxlwvcegdoasovqg7bh6ldb2u3nzu7x57n3pcgfqml4)\n    \n##RISKS\nThe proposal is extremely low risk. It involves calling a factory that will deploy a new, standalone registration contract on behalf of Unlock DAO. The sole purpose of that contract is to publish a daoURI field on behalf of the main Unlock contract(s).",

The proposal aims to introduce a new development or integration that will bring value to our ecosystem. Your participation is crucial as we rely on your votes to determine the fate of this proposal.\n\nIf the majority vote is in favor of the proposal, the owner will carry out the task, and the Unlock DAO will pay the UDT through the tokens that Unlock Inc has provided. However, if the majority vote is against the proposal, we will respect the community's decision and understand that the integration or development is not a priority for us.\nWe hope that you will engage actively in this forum and cast your votes to help shape the future of our protocol. Thank you for your participation and contributions.\n\nProposal:\n\nWhite Hat DAO is a valuable resource for individuals looking to conduct their own research on blockchain projects more effectively and efficiently. The platform compiles various data points and metrics for onboarded projects, helping users make more informed decisions. We provide a safety score for each project based on various factors, such as code security and potential risks and vulnerabilities.

      "title": "Dripps Universe",
      "content": "Project Name: Dripps\nDescription: Dripps is a social community hub that aims to foster more inclusive and secure in-person engagements.\nVision: My vision for Dripps is to create a global platform that enables anyone, regardless of their location, to organize and participate in gatherings. Utilizing blockchain technology, we aim to continuously enhance event security, privacy, and transparency for all participants.\nProblem: The driving force behind Dripps is to create a safer and more inclusive ecosystem for in-person engagements, particularly for women.\nSolution/Product: Phase 1: We believe that integrating NFTs with our platform will offer even greater value to our users by providing a seamless and secure event management experience in Web3. The NFT membership will grant access to the platform, events, and communication channels. \nPhase 2: Building on the success of Phase 1, our next focus is on expanding the onboarding strategy to smoothly transition Web2 users to Web3. We aim to create a user-friendly experience that allows Web2 users to easily opt-in and become part of the Web3 community on Dripps.\n\nThe UX flow will be designed to be seamless and intuitive, guiding users through the process step-by-step. We will provide clear instructions and resources to educate users about the benefits of Web3 and the advantages of being part of the Dripps community in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nWeb2 users will have the option to connect their existing accounts to a Web3 wallet within the Dripps platform. This will enable them to take advantage of the enhanced features and benefits of Web3, such as NFT ownership, secure transactions, and decentralized governance.\n\nWe will also provide comprehensive support, including FAQs, tutorials, and customer service, to ensure that the onboarding process is as smooth as possible for all users. Our goal is to make the transition from Web2 to Web3 seamless, user-friendly, and accessible to all, while empowering users to fully participate in the Dripps community and the broader blockchain ecosystem.\n\nPhase 3: Community Accounts\n\nBuilding on the success of Phase 1 and Phase 2, our next focus is on introducing Community Accounts as a key feature of Dripps. Community Accounts will allow communities to have their own dedicated accounts within the platform, with enhanced features and functionalities that cater specifically to their needs.\n\nCommunity Accounts will provide communities with a streamlined and customizable experience, allowing them to create their own unique profiles, manage their events and gatherings, and interact with their members in a more personalized and engaging way. Community leaders will have access to powerful tools and analytics to better understand and serve their members, enabling them to create a thriving and vibrant community on Dripps.\n\nOne of the key benefits of Community Accounts is the ability to create and manage NFT-based memberships for their communities. Community leaders can create exclusive NFTs that represent membership to their community, providing additional perks, benefits, and privileges to members. These NFT-based memberships can be bought, sold, and traded within the Dripps marketplace, creating a dynamic and vibrant economy within the platform.\n\nAdditionally, Community Accounts will have access to decentralized governance features, allowing community leaders and members to actively participate in the decision-making process of the Dripps platform. This will empower communities to have a direct say in the direction and development of the platform, fostering a sense of ownership and engagement among the community members.\n\n![LOG IN-SIGN UP.png](ipfs://bafkreifu2fdhvl7qo3hbvdrege4s3twx7t6ga36qbqlp5qvx4u3qwtj7mm)\n    ",

An NFT-based Loyalty Platform that enables small and medium-sized brands in LATAM to develop a digital Loyalty Program for their customers without the need of developing their own app or platform and spending a lot of money. End users can view all their Loyalty Programs in their Loty app and engage in a closer and more fun way with their favorite brands...\n\nMore details: https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock/issues/11528\n",

      "content": "Problem statement:\n\nThe core team premined a total of 1,000,000 tokens and is expecting to have distributed 300,000 tokens by May 1st 2022, through grants, bounties, and matching. This implies, the tokens will be sold on the market against the price set by UDT token holders (investors and speculators). Meaning, the amount of $$$ the core team can spend on grants, bounties, and matching, depends on the market price of the tokens.\n\nHowever; No incentive has been created for creators and users to use the token, and in turn for investors and speculators to buy the token, to set and drive up the price which in turn would give the core team more $$$ to spend.\n\nThe Unlock protocol currently gives back newly minted UDT (effectively a discount) through its inflation model to each user for every new membership purchased, regardless of which ERC20 token is used to process the purchase.\n\nConclusion: \n\nWhile the core team benefits from investors and speculators buying UDT in order to be able to provide grants, bounties, and matching, to increase adoption of the protocol and grow the network, no benefits have been created for investors and speculators to buy UDT in the first place.\n\n\nProposed solution:\n\nIn order to create synergy between the core team, investors and speculators, all parties involved need to be able to benefit from increasing adoption and growing the network. This can be achieved by creating a use case for UDT which would give it intrinsic value. \n\nTo give UDT intrinsic value, I propose to create a clear incentive for creators using the Unlock protocol, to use UDT over other ERC20 tokens. This can be achieved by giving back newly minted ‘Unlock DISCOUNT tokens’ (effectively a discount) to each user for every new membership purchased ONLY when it is purchased using UDT. In turn, when a membership is purchased using ERC20 tokens other than UDT, no newly minted UDT will be given back (effectively no discount).\n\nConclusion:\n\nBy making a distinction between who is eligible to receive a discount (newly minted UDT), a real use case is in place and intrinsic value is established.\n\nCreators will be incentivized to accept UDT because it will give their end-uses who purchase their memberships a discount paid for by the UDT inflation model without impacting their revenue stream.\n\nEnd-users will be incentivized to buy UDT on the market to purchase memberships, in order to receive discounts.\n\nDemand for UDT will grow, which will be reflected in its price.\n\nThe core team will have more $$$ to spend on grants, bounties, and matching to increase adoption and grow the network.\n\nInvestors and speculators will be equally rewarded for facilitating and enabling the core team to spend more $$$ to increase adoption and grow the network.",
