This could provide more certainty to both EPOCH and FLASH ecosystems. \n\nThis proposal uses Ranked Choice Voting. Please choose the option you prefer the most as your 1st selection, then choose your 2nd most preferred result, and so on, until all choices have been selected.\n\nThe question you are answering is: \"What should the end date be for the XIO Burn Contract\"?\n\nThe choices have been designed for:\n • Feb 15th 2024 = Close to the same date as the Epoch Airdrop end date, or approximately 3 months from now.\n • May 15th 2024 = Approximately 6 months from now.\n • Aug 15th 2024 = Approximately 9 months from now.\n • Dec 31st 2024 = Unchanged.

      "content": "EPOCH / FLASH \n •  Blockzero Treasury’s EPOCH and FLASH tokens will be sent to a new “XIO Burn contract” developed by Moai Labs that will allow the burning of XIO to withdraw ~16mil EPOCH and ~22mil FLASH at a proportional rate.\n\nUSDC\n •  Blockzero Treasury’s ~$19k USDC will be sent to Moai Labs for development and ongoing expenses.\n\nXIO\n •  Blockzero Treasury’s unallocated ~17mil XIO will be burned. ~10mil is allocated towards pending Core vesting and Avalanche XIO. Avalanche XIO not used for reimbursements will also be burned.\n\nCRYPTONAUTS\n •  Blockzero Treasury’s owned Cryptonaut NFTs will be burned and their vault’s XIO will be burned.\n •  All other Cryptonaut NFT holders can optionally choose to burn their NFTs to redeem all underlying XIO in their vault, to use that XIO to participate in the XIO Burn contract. \n •  To burn NFTs, go here: https://zero-gravity.blockzerolabs.io/ or use the withdrawAll function here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x6d9d87fd57fb8ae3bf005e564a950124fc83dd1a#writeContract#F3 \n\nXIO Burn Contract details:\n •  This contract will be developed by Moai Labs. \n •  This contract will have a cut off date of Dec 31st 2024, after which date XIO will no longer be burnable. After the cut off date: all remaining EPOCH will be burned and FLASH will be sent to the Flashstake Treasury.\n •  The XIO circulating supply will be manually calculated and applied to the contract, hard setting the ratio. The circulating supply is anticipated to be calculated as follows:  100mil - [XIO at burn address] - [XIO associated with burned Cryptonauts vaults] - [Dropzero unclaimable XIO]\n •  The ratio set for total EPOCH and FLASH received when burning XIO will be based on the above XIO circulating supply calculation relative to the amount of EPOCH and FLASH deposited into the contract. This ratio will remain constant.\n\nIn doing all of the above, Moai Labs will acquire all accounts and assets from Blockzero Labs.\n\nAll numbers provided in this proposal are ballpark estimates that could be more or less than final calculations. Final exact calculations will be completed by Moai Labs prior to executing the outcomes of this proposal. This proposal gives full ownership, control, and decision making power to Moai Labs to handle distributions and allocations of all tokens transferred to Moai Labs from the Blockzero Treasury.",

To give Blockzero more tokens to work with in the future, to concentrate more liquidity in times of higher activity, and more ability to create more experimental projects in the future, this proposal’s purpose is to put to a vote: Should we pause the XLP program? One day we can vote to restart this program or a program like it, when it would be more beneficial to do so.\n\nChoices given for the vote:\n •  March 1st: Stopping as of March 1st means all February LP activity would be rewarded on March 20th as the final distribution date\n •  April 1st: Stopping as of April 1st means all February and March LP activity would be rewarded, with April 20th as the final distribution date\n •  May 1st: Stopping as of May 1st means all February, March, and April LP activity would be rewarded, with May 20th as the final distribution date\n •  No: means the XLP program will continue on as it has been with no changes or end date.\n\nAs a reminder, the existing XLP rules are that if you remove any liquidity before the end of any month, you will forfeit all rewards earned so far for that month.\n\nAny liquidity for XIO/ETH on UniswapV2 will continue to earn LP fees, with or without the XLP program.

      "title": "Flashback budget distribution proposal",
      "content": "**Overview**\n\nThe recently approved tokenomics proposal amendment (https://snapshot.org/#/blockzerolabs.eth/proposal/0x79fdf6b5712d38c9fef5adb79ab9f3c25688e238085c97e1f0f2d3aaa719adaa) caused a change in absolute and percentage allocations of the token distribution. Consequently, the token budget for Flashback staking is smaller than the community airdrop allocation. For this reason, the originally proposed maximum Flashback staking APY of 100% can not be guaranteed for 100% of the community airdrop. Instead, an alternative allocation of the fixed Flashback budget of 18,504,723 FLASH tokens is required.\n\n**Problem**\n\nThe original proposal allocated 23,244,575 FLASH to both the community airdrop and Flashback staking which would have allowed a maximum APY of 100% and gave every community member the option to participate in Flashback staking. The primary purpose of Flashback staking is to reward community members for ongoing support of the project.\nThe amendment has resulted in the community airdrop increasing to 27,984,427 FLASH and the Flashback staking allocation to reduce to 18,504,723 FLASH. This means we can no longer offer both 1) an APY of 100% for the Flashback staking and 2) guarantee 100% of the community airdrop to be able to participate in the Flashback staking.\n\n**Solution**\n\nTo adjust for the new supply distribution, the Flashback budget must be changed accordingly. \n\nThere are two solutions that cover one of the two features of the original proposal (full community airdrop coverage or 100% APY). A third solution is presented as a possible middle ground if the community desires a more balanced approach to the Flashback staking distribution.\n\n**Solution 1**: Reduce the maximum Flashback APY to 66.13% but keep 100% community airdrop coverage. This means that theoretically every community member can stake their airdrop for a maximum reward of 66.13% additional FLASH tokens.\n\n**Solution 2**: Keep the maximum Flashback APY at 100% but reduce community airdrop coverage to 66.13%. This means that 100% APY staking rewards for Flashbacks are still available but on a first come, first served basis until the budget is depleted.\n\n**Solution 3**: Reduce the maximum Flashback APY to 80% and reduce community airdrop coverage to 82.66%. This is a middle ground of the two extreme options to balance the availability and attractivity of Flashback staking.",

      "content": "The previous passed proposal can be found here:\nhttps://vote.blockzerolabs.io/#/proposal/0xf543385b00dae02775e16e5a9069d14a73620f3c643549f152d77775cec169b3\n\nThis proposal is an amendment to the previous proposal. Note that nothing proportional wise is changing to what was previously proposed.\n\nUnfortunately, after triple checking the numbers, we found an error in the community airdrop eligibility calculation, which will require a new proposal to correct. The real number of tokens for the community is 27,984,426 instead of 23,244,575. The reason for this confusion was a mismatch in snapshot time from different data sources and previous lack of consideration of V1 holders.\n\nThe original proposal has passed without noteworthy counter votes and with overwhelming support which is a signal that the community agrees with the essence of the original proposal. Therefore, this updated proposal contains largely the same percentage allocations to the different budgeting purposes. However, that means that the total supply needs to increase to 180m tokens instead of 150m tokens to account for the larger airdrop.\nNothing will change substantially and everyone will receive the number of tokens that they expect. However, because the absolute number of tokens need to be adjusted, this formal agreement through another vote is required.\n\nThe differences in amounts and percentages between the previous proposal (150m) and this proposal (180m) can be found here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nUt_giWFlWRkhuT-zFWO_nX03AM7Iw7F7uQtX6xpxlQ/edit?usp=sharing\n\nWe apologize for the confusion and thank everyone for the continued support!",

While this is not currently a massive issue, it is something that could spiral inflation quite quickly if we do not implement a contingency plan.\n\nFor example: at $0.10 and $100k/monthly, this is 1M tokens hitting the market on a monthly basis. Assuming a 40M circulating supply, that is roughly 30% inflation per year. Here are some more examples to show how quickly this can get out of hand.\n\n- Token Price: $0.05 = 2M XIO tokens per month = 60% inflation\n- Token Price: $0.025 = 4M XIO tokens per month = 120% inflation\n\nIn the bottom example, we would run out of XIO tokens from the treasury in less than 1 year.\n\nWhile we are fortunate to have stable coins to backstop a super bad spiral, it is something we need to get ahead of in preparation for any market conditions.\n\nSolution\nIf we remain below 750,000 XIO in bi-weekly compensation, everything stays the same.\n\nHowever, if we go above this, this is what would be expected to happen.\n\n- Person A Compensation / Total Core Compensation = %\n- Take this % and multiply it by 750,000\n- This number is what Person A would be expected to receive\n- If Person A would like more XIO to make up for this difference, they would need to make a request for capital from the Blockzero DAO\n\nEssentially, this ensures we are not paying more than 1.5M XIO per month.",

      "title": "Should Cryptonauts get a multiplier on their associated locked XIO towards earning future tokens and governance voting weights?",
      "content": "Proposed multipliers:\n- Tier3: 1.05x multiplier\n- Tier2: 1.1x multiplier\n- Tier1: 1.2x multiplier\n\nThe benefits this brings is:\n- More incentives to own a Cryptonaut, and higher tiers have better incentives, encouraging ownership of higher tiers over lower tiers\n- This could increase overall Cryptonaut sales, which will increase the stablecoins and XIO token buy backs, a net positive for all XIO token holders.\n- A way to earn a multiplier on XIO tokens without being an LP\n- Locking up more XIO tokens means less tokens readily available to be sold, potentially less downward price pressure\n\nThe downside this can have:\n- Dilution towards other XIO holders that do not have a Cryptonaut or have not chosen to add more XIO tokens to their Cryptonaut’s vault.\n\nMultipliers bonuses will apply to:\n- Governance voting on Snapshot\n- Earning future tokens from all Blockzero snapshots\n\nHow this multiplier will work:\n- This multiplier would only apply to the XIO tokens that have been deposited into the Cryptonaut vault. The only way to withdraw those XIO tokens is to permanently burn the Cryptonaut. In theory, most people will not want to burn their Tier1 or Tier2 Cryptonaut due to exclusivity, which is another reason these Tiers have a higher multiplier, incentivizing lock ups of tokens that are more likely to never be unlocked.\n\nIf this proposal passes, this multiplier would retroactively apply to the date any Cryptonaut has been purchased (Tier 1 and 2) or minted (Tier 3) prior to this proposal passing. This means Tier 1 and 2 Cryptonauts would only start earning once purchased. This also means Tier 3 Cryptonauts will start earning as soon as they are minted.\n\n\nHow this would impact the existing XIO that comes preloaded in the vaults of all Cryptonauts\n- 1000x Tier3s each have 2,500 XIO, @ 1.05x multiplier, would give each 2,625 weight\n- 100x Tier2s each have 25,000 XIO, @ 1.10x multiplier, would give each 27,500 weight\n- 10x Tier1s each have 250,000 XIO, @ 1.20x multiplier, would give each 300,000 weight\n\nDilution of XIO holders vs Cryptonaut Vault XIO holders multipliers:\n- Because all Cryptonauts come preloaded with XIO in their vaults, if all 10x Tier1, 100x Tier2, and 1000x Tier3 Cryptonauts were purchased and minted as of today (they won’t be, this is an extreme example), and using today’s XIO supply and total XIO in the XLP, the dilution impact this would have is approximately 1.2% towards all FlashV3 tokens earned in November, and 1.3% dilution towards all KIND tokens earned over the next year.  \n- For every additional 1million XIO tokens that are deposited into Tier1s vaults with a x1.2 multiplier, as a worst case scenario of possible dilution, this would cause an increase of dilution by approximately another 0.5%, so 10m XIO deposited would be another 5% dilution.\n- For more details about dilution math, please see this publicly available sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mxSwY6duEKWykUZI_olSdBe_XCRmhSylpMwtsSmqsbA/edit#gid=0\n\n\nTo discuss further with community, or if you have any questions, please visit the Blockzero discord channel #proposals https://discord.gg/6YWcxpbVUU\n",

Users can still vote to mint $KIND, but it won’t be native to the token.\n- Post-approval, an in-depth tokenomics analysis will be performed and any changes which improve the token dynamics will be implemented.\n- The platform will initially allow only staking of DAI/Stablecoins but eventually ETH and others.\n\nDistribution:\n- 80% to Citizens to be earned over 1 year (XLP to be increased to 3x multiplier)\n- 10% to Blockzero Vortex (1 Year Vest)\n- 10% for $KIND Options to reward individuals who work on getting $KIND to mainnet\n- $XIO holders can vote to reduce or stop the distribution of $KIND holders at anytime\n\nBlockzero Bonus:\n- For as long as Blockzero Labs continues to support the HumankindDAO, Blockzero is to receive a 10% $KIND Box Match. This means, anytime $KIND tokens are minted, up to a 10% match will be sent to the Vortex.\n- Blockzero Labs can utilize the HumankindDAO to stake and support highly engaged Blockzero Citizens who step up within the ecosystem.\n\nTeam Expectations:\n- Project Lead: Dash\n- Front-end Web Developer\n- Back-end Developer\n- Smart-Contract Developer\n- Product Marketing Manager\n- Community Support Coordinator\n- Human Outreach Coordinator\n- Part-Time Protocol Engineer Advisory\n",

      "content": "During the Aqua token deployment, we arbitrarily chose the 1st of Jan 2023 as the expiry date since:\n1. We have the functionality to either decrease or increase the expiry date for these tokens\n2. We as a community did not decide on the expiry date (hence the arbitrary date of Jan 2023 being chosen)\n\nThis proposal if passed would set the deadline for all AQUA distribution claims on Dropzero to be three months (or exactly 84 days) from when this vote ends.\n\nSome reasons to vote \"Yes\" for this proposal are:\n1. Create a sense of urgency to claim AQUA tokens\n2. Ensure the AQUA tokens are kept in hands that are contributing or using the token or protocol.\n3. Ensure the community and new stakeholders are aware of the total/circulating supply - i.e 100 million tokens are not randomly claimed at some point\n4. Increase the reward for the KPI Option campaign (via deflation) and thus make them more of a lucrative option for high net worth individuals.\n5. The fewer tokens in existence the better for potential future stakeholders as well as current stakeholders\n\nFor context, the Flash token had an expiry date of three months post-launch. There are currently around 400 million AQUA tokens (or ~50%) that are unclaimed.\n\nThe tokens that are unclaimed would be burned. This means if 400 million tokens were left after the deadline, these tokens would be burned forever.\n",

Certik - as mentioned above (audited over 500 projects)\n2. Solidified - This is a company we have worked with in the past to audit Flashstake but this was also exploited. Solidified have audited over 140 projects.\n3. Bug Bounty - This option would involve allocating $30,000 towards a public bug bounty programme. This is something that we would start immediately and would run perpetually until these funds are depleted. There are many options available - for example running this bug bounty ourselves as we have done in the past, using community based bug bounty programs such as ImmuneFi, etc.\n4. I abstain\n\nPlease note the timelines mentioned in the last vote may no longer be valid. We are currently in talks with both auditing companies for updated timelines if we go ahead with them.\n\nDiscussion at:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/845757891897589800/872492424889507902",

These individuals and groups are eligible to claim 1 XIO Option token.\n* There are only 100 XIO Option tokens in existence. These tokens will be redeemed on a first-come-first-serve basis.\n* The XIO Option tokens are convertible up to 10M XIO tokens based on our primary KPI. Our primary KPI is the Total Liquid Value (TLV) inside the Blockzero Vortex — a decentralized venture fund.\n* These Options will be 100% convertible once the Vortex reaches a Total Liquid Value (TLV) of 100,000 ETH. At this time, one Option is worth 0.069168 ETH ($172.92).\n* If the market cap of XIO becomes equal to the TLV of the Vortex at the time we hit our primary KPI, one Option would currently be worth 250 ETH ($625,000).\n\nLink to full proposal:\nhttps://medium.com/bombx/the-100k-eth-experiment-f8cbf23b4838\n\nDiscuss at:\nhttps://discord.gg/JzugCwWqS2",

      "title": "Should we allow minter addresses for the Aqua token to be editable? (see additional info below)",
      "content": "Additional Information:\n\nYou can discuss here: https://discord.gg/vECzp2kc \n\nAfter speaking with our senior blockchain engineer I have determined that the best course of action for the AquaFi protocol in regards to layer 2 support is as follows. \n\nIn order to support sidechains/L2, we need a L1-L2 token bridge. Due to the nature of the Aqua token (has mining ability), the token bridge must be able to mint and burn tokens at will. \n\nFor example, if you transfer 1000 Aqua to the L1 side of the bridge from L2, 1000 Aqua must be minted on L1/mainnet. This means tokens can be exchanged 1:1 between the Ethereum mainnet and the sidechain/L2 thus keeping the price of the Aqua token consistent over all chains where AquaFi is deployed. Unfortunately due to the permissionless nature of AquaFi (as it currently stands) it would be impossible to update the minters for the Aqua token. \n\nI propose:\n1) we allow the Blockzero council to update (add or remove) the minters for the Aqua token via the council controlled multi-sig wallet.\n2) we implement a time-lock (duration to be determined) which means anytime the council wants to update the minter addresses, the council will need to submit a transaction to the ethereum network which will be publicly viewable. The council must then wait a period of time (duration to be determined) before the change is live and the minter addresses are then updated. \n3) we implement functionality that allows the council to permanently revoke this permission when executed\n\nIf we decide not to add this functionality, there is a very high chance that we will require a token migration each time we want to add or remove a new sidechain/L2 network. The alternatives are:\n1) Do not launch with sidechain/L2 support and require a rather large migration down the line if we want to support in the future\n2) Launch with support for predetermined sidechains/L2 networks - eg Arbitrum - this can never be updated (permissionless)\n3) Launch AquaFi independently onto sidechains/L2 - this effectively means Aqua on the other networks are completely independent from Aqua on the ethereum mainnet - so different prices, different tokens\n",

Determine a rough estimate of Aqua based on current projections and mint this number of Aqua tokens. The risk here is that we may not have enough tokens in the future - eg if someone purchases millions of XIO in September, the actual eligibility will be higher than the number of tokens we initially minted.\n\nOption 2. Give the foundation minting capability so we can update the claims app with the exact number of Aqua holders are eligible for. The minting capability would be controlled via a multi-sig wallet (currently controlled by the council).\n\nOption 3. Determine a rough estimate of Aqua based on current projects and mint this number of Aqua tokens. Place these tokens into the Vortex where citizens can earn them by staking XIO. This effectively stops all future eligibility and allows earning of Aqua based on staked XIO in the Vortex.\n\nOption 4. Stop earning Aqua tokens once AquaFi is live and the initial distribution has happened.\n\nOption 5. Mint additional tokens based on the current projections (eg current estimate plus 50-100%). Upload these to Dropzero for claiming by citizens as per the current schedule then perform a vote on what to do with all the tokens leftover around the end of the year/Jan 2022. This is similar to option 3 however there would be no Vortex involved here.\n\n\nCopy of proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/14aDQhNdOoGf6Ub7FwPy0O0ZGPcEDrthLun1SZWfF0os/edit?usp=sharing\n",

      "content": "If this proposal passes, the council will do what we can to get FLASH listed on GATE.IO, but this proposal passing does not guarantee that we will be able to.\n\n\nWhy is there a need for more exchange listings? \n\nCurrently FLASH is available on Uniswap and at the Flash Dapp. However, the gas fees have been very high lately, which is making both places a very expensive way to acquire FLASH tokens. If FLASH were listed on a centralized exchange, it would give a chance to users with less capital to acquire FLASH tokens without the issue of high gas fees.\n\nIt would also help increase the trading volume of FLASH, which would indicate that the project is in good health to new users looking to invest or projects looking for partners. Being able to trade FLASH in multiple exchanges would also reduce the price volatility as the impact of buys and sells would be spread out throughout the different markets. Being able to utilize custom features of centralized exchanges such as limit orders, which is not offered via Uniswap or the Flash Dapp, might also help.\n\n\nWhy is Gate.io being proposed as the exchange? \n\nThe main advantage of Gate.io is that it does not charge a listing fee as it gives an opportunity to new projects and tokens with smaller market caps. Another reason is that it has a high trust score on coingecko and a high exchange score on coinmarketcap. This indicates that the volume reported by the exchange is accurate and that it has high user traffic. This also means that it will appear as an exchange on the market section of coingecko / coinmarketcap for people looking to buy FLASH. It is the #12th biggest exchange, with a trustscore of 9 and almost $4 billion daily volume, per https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges\n\n\nWho would be responsible?\n\nJohn and Steve can work together to complete the listing application, if this gets approved.\n\nDiscussion at: https://home.blockzerolabs.io/post/proposal-a-member-of-the-project-team-to-apply-for-the-listing-of-flash-on---609c359d46f7b3fe66df90b7\n\nCopy of proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/15ZxMc69NjlsYb6GqLuG6z4MnuumMDlk47Se5EzpYDrk\n",
