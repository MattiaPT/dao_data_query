      "title": "BFBP-C-13: Fund Codehawks Audit for Beanstalk 3",
      "content": "## Proposer\n\nGuy\n\n## Summary\n\nFund a [Codehawks](https://www.codehawks.com/) competitive audit for Beanstalk 3 with 275,000 Beans, which includes implementations of (at least):\n* [RFC: Generalized Convert](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/issues/716);\n* [RFC: Generalized Flood](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/issues/740);\n* [RFC: Tractor](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/issues/734);\n* [RFC: Secure Beanstalk](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/issues/729), which includes:\n    * Upgrading the test suite to support Foundry;\n    * Upgrading the Solidity version of Beanstalk from 0.7.6 to 0.8.20;\n    * Upgrading Beanstalk to Storage V2;\n    * Migrating constants to state that are likely to be adjusted by the DAO in the future;\n* Whitelist v1.1 (discussed later);\n* Field V2 (discussed later); and\n* A series of contracts that can be used to migrate Beanstalk's state to an Ethereum L2.\n\n## Proposal\n\n[Codehawks](https://www.codehawks.com/) is a competitive audit platform facilitated by [Cyfrin](https://cyfrin.io/). The past few Codehawks audits (See [1](https://www.codehawks.com/report/clsxlpte900074r5et7x6kh96), [2](https://www.codehawks.com/report/clu7665bs0001fmt5yahc8tyh), [3](https://www.codehawks.com/report/clv1eptuo0003bcnzce1ap7om), [4](https://www.codehawks.com/contests/clvo5kwin00078k6jhhjobn22)) have shown that having judges with context on the protocol (as Cyfrin does) is a significant value add for determining the validity and severity of reports.\n\nThe prize pool for the Beanstalk 3 audit will be $250,000, with a 10% platform fee of $25,000 for a total cost of $275,000. Given the Beanstalk 3 upgrade (particularly Secure Beanstalk) touches many parts of the Beanstalk codebase, it is prudent to include the entire codebase as in scope of the audit.\n\nThe Beanstalk 3 audit competition is scheduled start on Thursday, May 30, 2024 and end ~5.5 weeks later on Monday, July 8, 2024.\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n### Foundry\n\nBeanstalk currently uses Hardhat as its main testing suite, which lacks many great features for testing such as:\n* Fuzz testing;\n* Differential testing;\n* `ffi` scripts; and\n* Stack traces.\n\nA significant number of whitehats and auditors prefer Foundry over Hardhat due to the tools available to them. \n\nHardhat testing is slow to compile (~1 minute to compile, ~5 minutes to run the test suite, ~5-10 minutes to run a stack trace, etc.) compared to Foundry testing. This leads to inefficient use of developer time.\n\nThus, we propose to migrate all tests from Hardhat to Foundry.\n\n### Solidity 0.8.20\n\nBeanstalk uses Solidity version 0.7.6. As a result, many QoL tools are not available to the Beanstalk development community, such as:\n* Using additional methods provided in EIP-1559;\n* Naming variables from mappings; and\n* Using SafeMath by default (leading to overflow).\n\nMost DeFi protocols use Solidity v0.8 or higher. Upgrading Solidity versions allows the Beanstalk development community to take advantage of tooling that is developed with v0.8.0^ in mind. For example, using Foundry with v0.7.6 requires a number of workarounds in order to properly use it.\n\nFurthermore, whitehats and auditors are generally more familiar with Solidity v0.8.0 and higher.\n\nThus, we propose to upgrade all contracts to v0.8.20. While there are more recent versions, Beanstalk should strike a balance between using a battle tested compiler and the latest version. For reference, Basin is developed in v0.8.20.\n\n### Storage V2\n\nBeanstalk uses diamond storage to read and write variables. With the introduction of Tractor, there are storage slots for the diamond implementation, Tractor, and a general storage slot. The slots for these are currently:\n\n```solidity\nds.slot = DIAMOND_STORAGE_POSITION // keccak256(\"diamond.standard.diamond.storage\");\ns.slot = 0;\nt.slot = TRACTOR_STORAGE_POSITION // keccak256(\"diamond.storage.tractor\"); \n```\n\nThis makes it incredibly difficult to implement changes in Beanstalk storage, compromising security, and generally increasing development timelines.\n\nThus, we propose to organize Beanstalk data into categories and store them separately, and unpack a majority of variables to reduce security risk.\n\n### Whitelist v1.1\n\nWhitelisting a Well requires code changes to the Beanstalk contracts. While the changes can potentially be minimal, they ultimately increase the friction associated with whitelisting a Well. Ideally, the DAO can whitelist a Well with the `init` function of a diamond cut. \n\nThus, we propose to implement a generalized oracle, liquidity weight function and Gauge Point function.\n\n### Field V2\n\nBeanstalk cannot easily add, modify or remove Yield Distributors, i.e., places where new Bean mints are allocated (currently the Silo, Field and Barn). It also cannot easily change the distribution of new Bean mints between various Yield Distributors.\n\nBeanstalk cannot support multiple Pod Lines, it cannot easily add, modify or remove Pod Lines and it cannot control the issuance of debt to particular Pod Lines.\n\nThus, we propose a generalized yield distribution system and Pod Line system. For reference, see [Temp-Check-4](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0xc716cb01aeecc01ea4127ace7219e7efe644e8173d228c6b6ff9331c4d373222).\n\n### L2 Migration\n\nBeanstalk is a fairly gaseous protocol. While the costs of interacting with Beanstalk at the time of writing in May 2024 are reasonable, activity on Ethereum L1 is currently low. In the past when Gwei has reached mid to high double digit values, interacting with Beanstalk (such as Mowing, Planting, or Converting) have cost upwards of several hundred US dollars. This prices out smaller Farmers and reduces the efficacy of Beanstalk's peg maintenance mechanisms. \n\nThus, we propose a series of initialization scripts that migrate Beanstalk state to an L2 and a facet to allow smart contract addresses to choose an address on the L2 to claim their assets with. For reference, see [Temp-Check-5](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0x93dfc538a66c1c199f5c9f0fd9c0233ce3625c7ada9743bafc8b5fbc0fc38fc7).",

      "content": "## Proposer\n\nGuy\n\n## Summary\n\nFund a [Codehawks](https://www.codehawks.com/) competitive audit of the final version of the Seed Gauge System. Use 94,500 Beans from the Audit Fund to pay for the audit.\n\n## Context\n\nIt's no secret that the Seed Gauge System has taken longer to develop and secure than initially expected. For reference, the Cyfrin audit of the Seed Gauge System started in mid-October 2023, which was notably before (1) the 2 critical vulnerabilities reported by whitehats that were fixed in [EBIP-10](https://arweave.net/im3PLE28EkO_eMo4fPmtcTYBJFRErxZ_44I_LWPDIB8) and [EBIP-13](https://arweave.net/zKpHhC4c8NhJecrEGHQ8F_vhrLVVEqdGKrQODSoIKbg) and by definition, before (2) findings from the audit were reported by Cyfrin. Beanstalk Farms paid 60,000 Beans this audit per [BFCP-C-10](https://arweave.net/atWg701gYbp6PoJSK5OlgidojmyPIcPJkXqNwN7rJkg).\n\nAs a result of (1), it seems clear that decentralized security programs with aligned incentives for security researchers (like the Immunefi bug bounty program) are essential to securing Beanstalk. However, bug bounty programs typically only secure code after it is deployed on-chain when there are assets at risk. Given the nature of competitive audits, where there are many more auditors and a prize pool that is only rewarded to valid reports, they seem like a preferable pre-deployment alternative to private company audits for securing large, complex codebases like Beanstalk. This was also illustrated by the vulnerabilities found in the [Basin Code4rena audit](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-07-basin) despite having been audited by 2 private companies beforehand.\n\nAs a result of (2), significant design changes to the Seed Gauge System were necessary. In particular, how Beanstalk was measuring Deposited BDV (i.e., what it measures to determine how to allocate Seed rewards to different whitelisted assets) in the initial version of the code was not sufficiently manipulation resistant. Thus, a 2 Season lag in Earned Bean distribution to new Deposits was implemented alongside the removal of the Vesting Period (added in [BIP-36](https://ragdi2zxddzujoy25uj67bzdqglsuvb6y6rxqbvp26rd263oh2sa.arweave.net/iAw0azcY80S7Gu0T74cjgZcqVD7Ho3gGr9eiPXtuPqQ)) altogether. Since then, there have also been additional changes such as infrastructure improvements to the Deposit Whitelist. In total these changes have resulted in >30% of the code in the final version being new or changed since the initial audit. For these reasons, another audit of some form is necessary.\n\nFinally, the Seed Gauge System is complex and is likely to be the most significant change to the Beanstalk codebase in 2024 (amongst [all of the other RFCs](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/issues)). A more proactive approach to security spending (i.e., pre-deployment, rather than post-deployment in the form of bug bounties) is the best path forward.\n\n## Proposal\n\n[Codehawks](https://www.codehawks.com/) is a competitive audit platform facilitated by [Cyfrin](https://cyfrin.io/). \n\nThe audit competition is scheduled to start next week and last 3-4 weeks. The prize pool for the audit will be $90,000. Cyfrin typically charges a 25% platform fee on the prize pool to facilitate Codehawks competitions, but has decreased the fee to 5% for this audit.\n\nAfter spending the 94,500 Beans proposed in the BFBP, there will be   52,037 Beans remaining in the Audit Fund.",

Use 26,000 USDC and ~28,600 Beans from the Audit Fund to pay for the audit.\n\n## Auditor\n\nCode4rena facilitates community driven contests for smart contract audits. Code4rena has a high quality reputation and no Code4rena audited code has lost any user funds in 2 years of audit contests.\n\nDecentralized security programs with aligned incentives for auditors have proven to have high efficacy in protecting code in the Beanstalk ecosystem (see [Immunefi](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkbugbounty.eth)). Although Basin has already been audited by Halborn and Cyfrin, the protocol will be non-upgradable, therefore it is prudent to frontload security work before deployment.\n\n## Payment\n\nThe audit contest is planned to start at the end of June / beginning of July 2023 and last 5 days. The award pool for the audit will be 40,000 USDC. \n\nPayment from Beanstalk Farms will be as follows:\n* 26,000 USDC (which contributes to the award pool);\n* $28,600 worth of Beans based on the Bean price at the time of payment (which contributes to the award pool and covers the Code4rena operating fee); and\n* 10,000 USDC (which is a refundable deposit).",

      "content": "## Proposer\n\nSilo Chad\n\n## Summary\n\nIncrease Al Bean's pay as full-time Senior Full-Stack Engineer from 18,750 to 25,000 Beans/mo.\n\n## Role\n\nAs Senior Full-Stack Engineer for Beanstalk Farms, Al Bean has led technical development of the [Beanstalk SDK](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-SDK) from inception to beta release. In addition to pure development, this required significant cross functional work in order for the SDK to faciliate the launch of the Root UI.\n\nOver the coming months, the expectation is that Al Bean continue development on the Beanstalk SDK in order to support the full suite of functionality supported in the protocol (first by migrating all existing Beanstalk UI functionality into the SDK, and then extending the SDK's capabilities related to composing transactions).\n\nThis is high leverage work that is critical to improving the developer experience of building on top of Beanstalk.\n\n## Payment\n\n25,000 Beans/month, paid twice per month, starting from December 16th, 2022 (conditional on Beanstalk Farms being funded by the DAO via future BIPs). This agreement is in place of the payment terms outlined in [BFBP-A-10](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarmsbudget.eth/proposal/0x2ed70de75a9192324a9f28abf7d0202fe670162d9c302f8aae039c57fa733c8f).\n\nIn order to match the high standard of the Beanstalk protocol itself, Beanstalk Farms is motivated to attract and retain the best talent with industry premium wages. Beanstalk Farms is more inclined to hire a few key extremely proficient contributors at a premium price than several contributors at a standard price. Al Bean has already proven this proficiency over the last few months.\n\nBeanstalk Farms believes this hiring philosophy will lead to lean development teams that are highly efficient, fast-paced and much more productive than a standard larger team. This type of wage distribution should allow Beanstalk Farms to maintain a lean budget while properly compensating its premium contributors for their work.\n\n## Commitment\n\nFull-time (40+ hr/wk).\n",

As a formal bug bounty program is not yet live, we have offered sync an unofficial bug bounty of 15,000 Beans for their efforts.\n\n## Vulnerability\n\nAfter the Ethereum Merge occurs, multi-block MEV will be possible, allowing validators to manipulate TWAP oracles by moving the price orders of magnitude higher for at least 1 block in a risk free fashion by either adding 1-sided liquidity and/or buying all the Beans in the pool. For more information see here: https://chainsecurity.com/oracle-manipulation-after-merge/.\n\nBeanstalk currently uses a time weighted average oracle over the course of an hour to calculate deltaB, which determines the amount of Beans or Soil to mint each Season. Thus, node operators will have the potential to manipulate the number of Beans/Soil minted during a Season as soon as the merge happens.\n\nFor more information on the problem and proposed solution, see the following links on GitHub:\n\n- GitHub issue: https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/issues/91\n- GitHub Pull Request: https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/pull/92\n\n## Payment\n\n15,000 Beans\n",

Contributions since then include:\n* [Pre-exploit Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/tbiq/Beanstalk) \n    * Created all queries and visualizations available on the official Beanstalk Dune dashboard, which provides a comprehensive data-driven view of the pre-exploit Beanstalk ecosystem. \n    * Adjusted the dashboard to only show pre-exploit data in order to serve as a historical reference.\n* [Pod Market yield curve modeling](https://github.com/TBIQ/pod-market-yc)\n    * Modeled historical Pod Market data, exploring the evolution of the Pod Market yield curve (Place in Line vs. price per Pod) over time. This work served as the basis for an early stage proposal to [FIAT DAO](https://fiatdao.com/) to enable Pods as a collateral type for lending and borrowing within their protocol. This work was halted due to the exploit, but may make sense to pick back up once there is a more efficient Pod Market post-Replant. \n* [Silo APY calculator ](https://dune.com/tbiq/Beanstalk-Silo-APY-Calculator)\n    * Designed and built a Silo APY calculator that provides Farmers with historical context and allows them to make their own assumptions about future variable trends. \n* Ad-hoc data requests\n    * Served as the point of contact for surfacing on-chain metrics for one-off analyses, for both community members and Beanstalk Farms contributors (eligible addresses for Barn Raise BeaNFTs, internal analysis of variables driving demand for Soil, etc.).\n* [Barn Raise Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/tbiq/beanstalk-barn-raise)\n    * Created a dashboard for the Barn Raise that was widely used among the community to monitor and understand progress. \n* State computation and cross validation for the Replant \n    * Leveraged Token Flow, a database product which can be used to query the storage level data of smart contracts over time, to write SQL queries to compute the state of Beanstalk at the pre-exploit block.  \n    * Wrote a series of data pre-processing, standardization, and cross validation scripts that were used in order to compare state variables computed from a combination of event processing logic, on-chain function calls, and Token Flow  queries. This provided us with a high degree of confidence that the state at the time of Replant provided all users with the correct assets. \n\n## Role \n\nTBIQ will continue to build out Beanstalk Farms’ data engineering systems, analytics and visualization capabilities. TBIQ will focus on building on top of the subgraph infrastructure. Expected work includes:\n* Setting up a hosted application that will serve as the Beanstalk data playground (this will serve a similar purpose to Dune, but will instead pull data from the subgraph and have custom visualizations);\n* Building a variety of new visualizations for the data playground;\n* Supporting the maintenance and building of the subgraph;\n* Prototyping visualization ideas that could potentially be integrated into the Beanstalk UI; and\n* Continuing to service high priority ad hoc data analysis and modeling requests from the rest of the Beanstalk Farms team as they surface.\n\n## Payment \n\n9,000 Beans/month, paid twice per month, starting from Monday August 15, 2022 (conditional on Beanstalk Farms being funded by the DAO via future BIPs).\n\n## Commitment\n\nPart-time (average of 25 hr/wk).\n",

Contributions to Beanstalk UI V1 include:\n* Led the development of the [Silo rebuild](https://pre-exploit-beanstalk-ui.netlify.app/silo);\n* Refactored and standardized components in preparation for open-sourcing the UI codebase;\n* Helped implement a new WalletConnect library; \n* Fixed various bugs and style tweaks; and\n* Built support for Twitter and YouTube embed links on [bean.money](https://bean.money/).\n\nCool Bean continued to contribute (more than) full-time after the exploit. Contributions include:\n* Contributed to the build of multiple versions of the Barn Raise UI while the Path Forward was going through multiple iterations.\n* Contributed to the build of [Beanstalk UI V2](https://app.bean.money/) from scratch—\n    * Built page structure and components for most of the major pages;\n    * Built complex form functionality and implemented contract calls for functions like Sow, Transfer and Harvest;\n    * Designed and built reusable components to minimize code redundancy across the codebase;\n    * Implemented a standardized styling system; and\n    * Helped onboard a new contributor into the codebase.\n\n## Role\n\nPost-Unpause, Cool Bean has continued to build the V2 UI and onboard new contributors. Notable upcoming projects include:\n* Embedding Snapshot governance into the UI;\n* Preparing the site for open-sourcing;\n* Building an improved Pod Marketplace;\n* Integrating new liquidity pools into the site as they are added; and\n* Generally building whatever needs to get built from a UI perspective.\n\n## Payment\n\n25,000 Beans/month, paid twice per month, starting from the Unpause (conditional on Beanstalk Farms being funded by the DAO via future BIPs).\n\n\nAs BIPs continue to be audited, proposed and committed, Beanstalk Farms has a dire need for high quality frontend code to reach feature parity with the Beanstalk contract.\n\nIn order to match the high standard of the protocol, Beanstalk Farms is motivated to attract the best talent with industry premium wages. Beanstalk Farms is more inclined to hire a few key extremely proficient contributors at a premium price than 7 or 8 contributors at a standard price. Cool Bean has already proven this proficiency over the last few months.\n\nBeanstalk Farms believes this hiring philosophy will lead to lean development teams that are highly efficient, fast-paced and much more productive than a standard larger team. This type of wage distribution should allow Beanstalk Farms to maintain a lean budget while properly compensating its premium contributors for their work.\n\n## Commitment\n\nFull-time (40+ hr/wk).\n",
