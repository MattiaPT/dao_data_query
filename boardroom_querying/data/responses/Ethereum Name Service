      "content": "## Abstract\nThis proposal suggests introducing and implementing an [Investment Policy Statement (IPS)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NtaKb-9HJf9wJmVOq4sQbhsYQ4yZtTF2) for the ENS Endowment. \n\nThe Investment Policy Statement (“IPS”) outlines the principles and guidelines for the effective management of the ENS Endowment Fund (the “Endowment”). And provides additional clarity to the Endowment Manager in their duties of achieving the mandate of the ENS Endowment established in [EP 2.2.4](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep2-2-4-social-rfp-ens-endowment/14069).\n\n## Specification\nThe creation and implementation of the [IPS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NtaKb-9HJf9wJmVOq4sQbhsYQ4yZtTF2), will serve the following purposes:\n\n1. Define and assign the responsibilities of all parties involved in the Endowment.\n2. Establish clear investment goals and objectives for the Endowment assets.\n3. Offer guidance and limitations to the Endowment Manager regarding the investment of the Endowment assets.\n4. Establish a basis for evaluating the performance of the Endowment Manager.\n5. Express the prudent standards that are expected in the management of the Endowment assets.\n\nThe proposed ENS Investment Policy Statement to be ratified can be read: [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NtaKb-9HJf9wJmVOq4sQbhsYQ4yZtTF2).\n\nAs specified in the IPS, this document will be continually reviewed annually.\n\n### Updates from Feedback\nFollowing discussions, the community provided feedback on the draft IPS posted in the [September temp check post](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-proposal-for-introduction-of-ens-investment-policy-statement/19568) and the weekly MetaGov calls. \n\nBased on those discussions, the following changes have been incorporated into the final version of the IPS:\n- **More conservative asset allocation:** Increase stablecoin allocation in the Endowment to 40% (up from 20%). \n- **Regular transfers:** Introduce regular monthly transfers of income from the Controller to the Endowment to support continuous growth and reduce future funding requests. \n\n\n## Proposal Success Criteria\nFor this social proposal to pass, the following quorum and voting requirements must be met:\n\n- **Quorum:** The proposal must receive a minimum of 1% of the total supply of $ENS (1 million votes) in the form of \"For\" and \"Abstain\" votes combined. \"Against\" votes do not count towards quorum.\n\n- **Approval:** Once the quorum is reached, the proposal requires a simple majority (>50%) of \"For\" votes among the \"For\" and \"Against\" votes to pass. \"Abstain\" votes do not count towards the approval calculation.\n\nIf approved, the ENS DAO should adopt the final Investment Policy Statement prepared by karpatkey for the ENS Endowment established under [EP 2.2.4](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep2-2-4-social-rfp-ens-endowment/14069). If not approved, karpatkey will reassess and propose an alternative structure based on the feedback received.",

      "title": "[EP 5.21] [Social] Governance Security Bounty",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to compensate the blockful team for their work in identifying, analyzing, reporting and mitigating a severe vulnerability in ENS DAO's governance structure.\n\n## Background\n\nIn March 2024, blockful uncovered a critical vulnerability that could have led to a [~$150M](https://dune.com/steakhouse/ens-steakhouse) theft and protocol capture. Their subsequent work led to the implementation of the Security Council, significantly enhancing ENS DAO's resilience against attacks.\n\n## Contribution Details\n\nThe team involved is a [different](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/blockful-service-provider-reports/19553#p-54163-other-contributions-not-related-to-service-provider-scope-14) squad than the one working on the scope of the [ENS service provider](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/blockful-service-provider-reports/19553). It was developed by 2 researchers, 1 smart contract engineer and 4 different auditors the team has worked with previously. Summing up to ~600 hours, the scope includes:\n* Comprehensive vulnerability assessment and risk analysis: **[Here](https://mirror.xyz/research.blockful.eth/-PfMduhpxdypPrutofr6099T4ROpsAmX0fPNbvDgR_k)** is our detailed security report.\n* Data analysis of ENS governance metrics and study of past DAO attacker's behaviors.\n* Design, development and deployment of the Security Council contract and multisig.\n* The Security Council was thought with several key features to balance security and decentralization.\n* Smart contract implementation and testing ([GitHub](https://github.com/blockful-io/security-council-ens))\n* Governance proposal drafting and support [[1](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xf3a4673fe04a3ecfed4a2f066f6ced1539a5466d61630428333360b843653c54), [2](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xa0b1bfadf6853b5b0d59d3c4d73c434fc6389339887d05de805361372eb17c3a), [3](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/42329103797433777309488042029679811802172320979541414683300183273376839219133)]\n\nMore details can be found on the links above for past proposals and the [report](https://mirror.xyz/research.blockful.eth/-PfMduhpxdypPrutofr6099T4ROpsAmX0fPNbvDgR_k).\n\n## Compensation Rationale\n\n As a team that is totally bootstrapped and never received any investment, this support us to keep it sustainable with the resources invested towards this initiative. The requested amount represents fair compensation for:\n\n* The potential loss prevention of ~$150M, capture of the DAO and protocol. The attack is anything but theoretical and there are actually many groups of investors who specialize in \"risk free value raiders\". They have exerted the attack on other DAOs before. Currently there are [unknown whales](https://etherscan.io/address/0x245445940b317e509002eb682e03f4429184059d#tokentxns) buying ENS for +450 days and have ~2M ENS, showing how feasible the scenario is, more than the average quorum, in one wallet.\n* A critical code bug bounty in [ENS is $250k USDC](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/ens/scope/#assets). Our work was much beyond identifying and disclosing.\n* Significantly lower cost compared to standard rates charged by other security service providers in the DAO space, which typically demand liquid compensation. An example is that Open Zeppelin (one of the most reputable players in security) [charges $4M/year at Compound](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/76), which recently [suffered](https://mirror.xyz/research.blockful.eth/v0GEP49oXP1gzMDlyP91-S4XIa8PIOd0vKq-6R8f54I) this type of attack.\n* Months of dedicated work by the team involved (researchers, devs and auditors).\n* The long-term value added to ENS through enhanced security.\n* Our commitment to ENS's long-term success and continued contribution, as evidenced by the 2-year vesting schedule.\n\n\n## Compensation Structure\n\n* Total amount: 100k USDC + 15k vested ENS tokens\n* Vesting period: 2 years\n* Vesting start date: April 8, 2024 (date of initial research disclosure)\n* Vesting schedule: Linear vesting\n\n## Benefits to ENS DAO\n\n* Sets a positive precedent that **responsible vulnerability disclosure and correction are rewarded**, encouraging future security contributions\n* Preserves DAO treasury liquidity by using part of the bounty in ENS tokens instead of USDC or ETH\n* Enhances governance security by increasing the number of engaged, security-focused token holders\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy approving this compensation, ENS DAO acknowledges the critical importance of security research and proactive governance improvements. The vesting structure ensures ongoing commitment and aligns incentives for continued contribution to ENS's security and stability.\n\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nFor this social proposal to pass, the following quorum and voting requirements must be met:\n\nQuorum: The proposal must receive a minimum of 1% of the total supply of $ENS (1 million votes) in the form of \"For\" and \"Abstain\" votes combined. \"Against\" votes do not count towards quorum.\n\nApproval: Once the quorum is reached, the proposal requires a simple majority (>50%) of \"For\" votes among the \"For\" and \"Against\" votes to pass. \"Abstain\" votes do not count towards the approval calculation.",

      "title": "[EP 5.19] [Social] Governance Distribution Pilot Program",
      "content": "## Objective:\nThis proposal establishes a pilot program to distribute ENS governance to eligible DAO contributors who have been selected by the DAO to receive a grant, bounty, or other payment for services. The program would also serve as a pilot, and if successful, could become a long-term initiative, aiming to cover all DAO USDC and ETH recipients, while setting a policy for future governance distribution.\n\nThe intent is to engage contributors in governance. We believe governance distribution increases access to DAO governance, enhances the utility of the token, decreases the amount of tokens purely used in markets, increases delegation and the safety of the DAO, and helps align developers and other contributors who bring value to the DAO.\n\n## Context:\n- **Previous Distributions**:\n  - [90k ENS tokens to stewards](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/5-8-social-ens-steward-vesting-proposal/19059)\n  - [80k ENS tokens to service providers and security council members](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/distribution-of-80k-ens-tokens-to-service-providers-and-security-council-members/19541)\n\n- **Proposed Distribution**:\n  - This vote is to determine if the program is approved and to select its budget within a range between 0 and 90k ENS.\n\n## Matching Program:\n\nThe distributions are calculated using a progressive ratio, meaning that the more you receive in dollar value from the DAO, the more you will receive in absolute values in ENS, but less relatively to the amount, following a quadratic formula. The process is as follows:\n\n1) **Calculate all eligible transfers**: First, we list all transfers from the various DAO wallets into external wallets from January to September 2024. Data is collected from the [ENS Ledger app](https://ens-ledger.app).\n2) **Exclude ineligible transactions**: Transactions to Stewards, ENS Labs, Service Providers, and other transactions that are considered refunds or payments for goods are not counted. \n3) **Calculate the square root of the total value received**: The total weights are calculated to determine the percentage of the budget each recipient will receive. That calculation and further details can be seen in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hnrBSPy5efi2W0b4hd4y2BnAmRIfI0M5y4NgYGjEPms/edit?usp=sharing).\n4) **Decide the program's total budget**: The total budget will be determined by this vote.\n\n## Voting Method:\n\nThe vote will use a ranked choice voting system with options of 0, 30k, 60k, and 90k ENS.\n\nAn Instant Run-Off will be calculated, and if the budget option of 0 wins, or if the total votes are less than 1 million, then the proposal will be considered rejected.\n\n## Distribution Table:\n\nThe table below is from the [ENS ledger](https://ens-ledger.app), excluding Stewards, Service Providers, ENS Labs, refunds, and internal wallets. ETHGlobal Hackers are bounties given by ETHGlobal to hackathon winners. The final number of hackers is still being calculated, but here it is presented as a maximum of 100. If the final number is less than this, then more ENS will be distributed to other recipients, and if it is greater, it will be capped at 100. This proposal covers transactions from January 2024 to September 2024, and the final table may be subject to change upon legal or technical review.\n\n\n\n|| $ Received jan-sep 2024 |30k ENS|%|60k ENS|%|90k ENS|%|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|ETHGlobal| $ 190,000.00 |1,441|13%|2,883|26%|4,324|39%|\n|Karpatkey| $ 187,149.13 |1,430|13%|2,861|26%|4,291|39%|\n|@UGWST_COM| $ 75,000.00 |906|21%|1,811|41%|2,717|62%|\n|Rotki| $ 53,973.38 |768|24%|1,536|48%|2,305|73%|\n|wslyvh.eth| $ 50,004.00 |739|25%|1,479|50%|2,218|75%|\n|gashawk.eth| $ 40,000.00 |661|28%|1,323|56%|1,984|84%|\n|buidlguidl.eth| $ 35,000.00 |619|30%|1,237|60%|1,856|90%|\n|borderlessafrica.eth| $ 30,000.00 |573|32%|1,145|65%|1,718|97%|\n|daemon.eth| $ 27,000.00 |543|34%|1,087|68%|1,630|103%|\n|Revoke.Cash| $ 25,000.00 |523|36%|1,046|71%|1,568|107%|\n|Onthis| $ 25,000.00 |523|36%|1,046|71%|1,568|107%|\n|ipns.eth| $ 25,000.00 |523|36%|1,046|71%|1,568|107%|\n|Fluidkey| $ 25,000.00 |523|36%|1,046|71%|1,568|107%|\n|Blockscout| $ 25,000.00 |523|36%|1,046|71%|1,568|107%|\n|beaconchain.eth| $ 25,000.00 |523|36%|1,046|71%|1,568|107%|\n|1w3.eth| $ 25,000.00 |523|36%|1,046|71%|1,568|107%|\n|Firefly| $ 20,000.00 |468|40%|935|79%|1,403|119%|\n|EIP-7212| $ 20,000.00 |468|40%|935|79%|1,403|119%|\n|Urbe Campus| $ 19,680.00 |464|40%|928|80%|1,392|120%|\n|ethdaily.eth| $ 14,797.60 |402|46%|804|92%|1,207|139%|\n|Discord Support| $ 13,000.00 |377|49%|754|99%|1,131|148%|\n|Dappnode| $ 12,500.00 |370|50%|739|101%|1,109|151%|\n|generalmagic.eth| $ 11,563.43 |356|52%|711|105%|1,067|157%|\n|Immunefi | $ 10,200.00 |334|56%|668|111%|1,002|167%|\n|Pugson| $ 10,000.00 |331|56%|661|112%|992|169%|\n|Juicebox| $ 10,000.00 |331|56%|661|112%|992|169%|\n|frolic.eth| $ 10,000.00 |331|56%|661|112%|992|169%|\n|ETHDenver| $ 10,000.00 |331|56%|661|112%|992|169%|\n|Drips| $ 10,000.00 |331|56%|661|112%|992|169%|\n|Lemma| $ 9,998.67 |331|56%|661|112%|992|169%|\n|Tally| $ 8,999.54 |314|59%|627|119%|941|178%|\n|pairwise.eth| $ 8,402.18 |303|61%|606|123%|909|184%|\n|@navad| $ 7,500.00 |286|65%|573|130%|859|195%|\n|apoorv.eth| $ 7,021.88 |277|67%|554|134%|831|201%|\n|leticiaferraz.eth| $ 6,949.32 |276|67%|551|135%|827|202%|\n|@Sagamore| $ 6,000.00 |256|73%|512|145%|768|218%|\n|Socket| $ 5,000.00 |234|79%|468|159%|701|238%|\n|Latin Hackathon| $ 5,000.00 |234|79%|468|159%|701|238%|\n|eth-mexico.eth| $ 5,000.00 |234|79%|468|159%|701|238%|\n|aynieducativo.eth| $ 5,000.00 |234|79%|468|159%|701|238%|\n|@adhd| $ 5,000.00 |234|79%|468|159%|701|238%|\n|ENS Fairy| $ 4,781.34 |229|81%|457|163%|686|244%|\n|glodollar.eth| $ 3,762.22 |203|92%|406|183%|608|275%|\n|weird3.eth| $ 3,000.00 |181|103%|362|205%|543|308%|\n|Event Support| $ 3,000.00 |181|103%|362|205%|543|308%|\n|daveytea.eth| $ 2,818.29 |176|106%|351|212%|527|318%|\n|@solidityhaxor| $ 2,500.00 |165|112%|331|225%|496|337%|\n|@haoce505| $ 2,500.00 |165|112%|331|225%|496|337%|\n|@h4nt3rx| $ 2,500.00 |165|112%|331|225%|496|337%|\n|stephancill.eth| $ 2,367.89 |161|116%|322|231%|483|347%|\n|Scope.sh| $ 2,367.89 |161|116%|322|231%|483|347%|\n|Kiwi News| $ 2,367.89 |161|116%|322|231%|483|347%|\n|bloomnetwork.eth| $ 1,881.11 |143|130%|287|259%|430|389%|\n|modularcrypto.eth| $ 1,818.29 |141|132%|282|264%|423|395%|\n|aexek.eth| $ 1,750.00 |138|134%|277|269%|415|403%|\n|@austinoa012| $ 1,000.00 |105|178%|209|356%|314|533%|\n|illuminated.eth| $ 940.56 |101|183%|203|367%|304|550%|\n|dhive.eth| $ 940.56 |101|183%|203|367%|304|550%|\n|pabl0cks.eth| $ 877.74 |98|190%|196|379%|294|569%|\n|iviangita.eth| $ 877.74 |98|190%|196|379%|294|569%|\n|easlabs.eth| $ 877.74 |98|190%|196|379%|294|569%|\n|2118.eth| $ 877.74 |98|190%|196|379%|294|569%|\n|andrewpage.eth| $ 780.00 |92|201%|185|403%|277|604%|\n|ETHGlobal Hackers (max 100 participants)| $ 500.00 |72|245%|144|491%|216|736%|",

      "content": "| Status     | Posted on Snapshot                                      |\n| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| **Author** | [5pence.eth](https://twitter.com/5pence_eth) |\n\n\n## Background\n\nThe ENS DAO Working Group Rules place the responsibility for steward compensation on the Metagov working group.\n\n**Working Group Rules:**\n[[EP0.4] [Social] Proposal: Creation of Foundational Working Groups and Working Group Rules](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-0/ep4-social-proposal-creation-of-foundational-working-groups-and-working-group-rules)\n[[EP12][Social] Working Group Rules ](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep12-social-working-group-rules/12953)\n\nWith the passing of [this social proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0x26a5c8dec547837495707e70446d1e7cd874a91f75753c602998f6e70083a266) in Term 4, these two rules were added:\n> **10.4.** The Meta-Governance working group are responsible for defining standards for fair compensation ('Compensation Guidelines').\n> **10.5.** The Compensation Guidelines shall be defined prior to the Nomination Window for each term and can only take effect for the following term.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn accordance with rule 10.5, This post outlines the proposed compensation structure for ENS DAO stewards during Term 6. The structure builds upon previous compensation models but includes several important changes. Notably, this compensation proposal will be put to a DAO vote for approval.\n\n## Proposed Compensation Structure\n\n### USDC Compensation\n\nThe total USDC compensation is the same as Term 5.  The base compensation structure remains similar to previous terms, with some adjustments:\n\n| Role           | Quantity | Per Steward Per Month | Per Steward Per Term | Total per Term |\n|----------------|----------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|\n| Steward        | 6        | $4,000               | $24,000              | $288,000       |\n| Lead Steward   | 3        | $5,500               | $33,000              | $198,000        |\n| Secretary      | 1        | $5,500               | $33,000              | $66,000        |\n| Scribe         | 1        | $3,000               | $18,000              | $36,000        |\n| **Total**      |          |                      |                      | **$588,000**   |\n\n([previous structure linked here for reference](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-dao-steward-compensation/18063))\n\nKey changes:\n- The discretionary amount has been removed.\n- The $3,000 previously allocated to each WG for discretionary compensation has been split evenly among the stewards of that working group.\n- Regular stewards will now receive $4,000 USDC per month (up from $3,000).\n- Lead stewards will now receive $5,500 USDC per month (up from $4,500).\n\n\n### $ENS Token Distribution\n\nWe are introducing a new structure for $ENS governance distribution to stewards:\n\n1. Each steward will receive $ENS tokens equal in value to their total USDC compensation for the year.\n3.  The $ENS tokens will be distributed on July 1st, via 2-year linear vesting contracts.\n3. The $ENS token price used to calculate the number of tokens each steward receives will be derived from the average daily price of the token between January 1st and July 1st of the term.\n5. The vesting period will start from the beginning of the term (January 1st), meaning 6 months of vesting will have already occurred at the time of distribution.\n\nExample calculation:\n- A regular steward receiving $48,000 USDC for the year would also receive $48,000 worth of $ENS tokens.\n- If the average $ENS price is $12 when calculated on July 1st, the steward would receive 4,000 $ENS tokens in a 2-year linear vesting contract.\n- At the time of distribution (July 1st), 25% of the tokens (1,000 $ENS) would have already vested.\n\nThis structure ensures that stewards' token compensation aligns with their USDC compensation and incentivizes long-term commitment to the DAO.\n\n### Success Criteria\n\nFor this social proposal to pass, the following quorum and voting requirements must be met:\n\n1. **Quorum**: The proposal must receive a minimum of 1% of the total supply of $ENS (1 million votes) in the form of \"Yes\" and \"Abstain\" votes combined. \"No\" votes do not count towards quorum.\n\n2. **Approval**: Once the quorum is reached, the proposal requires a simple majority (>50%) of \"Yes\" votes among the \"Yes\" and \"No\" votes to pass. \"Abstain\" votes do not count towards the approval calculation.\n\nIf approved, this structure will be implemented for Term 6. If not approved, the Metagovernance Working Group will reassess and propose an alternative structure based on feedback received.",

This funding stream is authorized in Article III of the ENS DAO Constitution. The funding supports initiatives related to open-source software, tooling, research and any practical implementations that broadly benefit a wide range of users of Ethereum and Web3.\n\nThe funds requested extends current need through to next term to ensure that next season’s stewards have some available funding before the next funding window available.\n\nThe total request in this proposal is 226k USDC to be transferred from the DAO wallet to the Public Goods Working Group.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis specification is the amount requested from the DAO treasury to the Public Goods Multisig to fulfill anticipated budgetary needs through the next formal funding window in April 2025.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-10-09 at 17.42.09.png](ipfs://bafkreigs2h6fb5zpnsep76k3qejqlcwz757bgsl3vjsn7muvvgigta5q7a)![Screenshot 2024-10-09 at 17.43.51.png](ipfs://bafkreictfvsa3fq2xv3rnnlnqdulphsq5d7s5eybiyvbjnqz5umqstsewu)\n\nOf these funds, 256k is allocated to large grants builders and initiaves through to the end of 2024. This leaves approximately 89k USD and 29.5 Ether unallocated and available to be rolled into the next term.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-10-09 at 17.44.46.png](ipfs://bafkreigv5qvxcs7u7hhoj3lrwzp2hsikjasugtuwe7bepobjz6bhvg5nby)\n\n**Note #1:** To ensure grantees have consistency, the funds requested for this category carry the program to Q3 which is an exception from the other spending categories which plan only through April 2025.\n\n**Note #2:**  The PG Working group budget request is in USDC only; our balance of ETH will rollover to next term, but it will be left to future stewards discretion to swap it, keep it or return it to the treasury.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-10-09 at 17.46.53.png](ipfs://bafkreihplgibqq5zdwvy7eqksvue753a76tmtpkvicitirfazle3wpbyy4)\n\nSubtracting the 89k available to rollover from 2024, the unmet need is 226k USDC which is the sum total to be included as the specification of this funding request.\n\n# Spending Categories Explained\n\n# **Builder Grants**\n\nThis new category consolidates the exisiting Large and Small grants under one category and program title. The Public Good working group has been working with a provider to create a unified platform which will be announced during frENSday in Bangkok on 11/11/2024. To ensure grantees have consistency, the funds requested for this category carry the program through to Q3 which is an exception from the other spending categories which plan through to April 2025.\n\n**a) Small Grants**\nMultiple micro-grants will be distributed to builders via the Builder Grants platform to be launched. We have added the amount expected to spend in the next 5 months with the same amounts distributed in the last rounds.\n\n**b) Large Grants**\nGrants up to 50k USDC with applications accepted on a rolling basis throughout the term. Large Grants will continue in Q4. The working group will continue to focus on strengthening impact measurements accomplished by grantees during the previous Large Grants cycle.\n\n# **PG Perpetual Bounty**\nLaunched during ETHLondon in March 2024, this is a perpetual pool of funds that is available to builders who are developing projects which align with the principles of public goods in the web3 space.\n\nThis funding pool is available at any time, but also marketed specifically towards builders who are not eligible for ENS-related bounties during hackthons, but deserve support for their public goods mission.\n\n# **Events and Hackathons**\nThe working group provides support to Public Goods events and hackathons. These funds cover expenses related to event sponsorship, bounties, judging and other participatory support roles during events.\n\n**The current earmarked events are:**\n\nETHGlobal Bangkok\nDevcon\nETHDenver 2025\n\n*This list is not set as several events are still in planning stages for Q1 of 2025. The PG stewards continuously assess opportunities for expanding the public goods conversation and collaborations.\n\n**Discretionary**\n\nThe funds in this category are reserved for additional grant opportunities and expenses that arise during the term. Spending in this category is at the discretion of the working group stewards.",

      "content": "## Abstract \n\nThe Meta-Governance Working Group is responsible for providing governance oversight and supporting the management and operation of working groups through DAO tooling and governance initiatives as well as treasury management for the DAO. \n\nThis social proposal is submitted to satisfy the requirements set out in Rule 10.1.1 of the Working Group Rules ([EP 1.8](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-1/ep12-working-group-rules)) and further required by [this snapshot proposal in Nov. 2023 modifying steward rules.](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0x26a5c8dec547837495707e70446d1e7cd874a91f75753c602998f6e70083a266) If this proposal is passed, the funding request will be included in a collective executable proposal put forward by all three Working Groups.\n\n## Specification\nThis specification is the amount requested from the DAO treasury to the Metagov Multisig to fulfill anticipated budgetary needs through the next formal funding window in April 2025.\n\n|     | USDC | ETH | $ENS |\n| --- |:----:|:---:|:----:|\nENS Meta-Gov Main Multisig | 254k|0 | 0 |\n\nThis amount will cover all expected expenses outlined below while leaving a 100k prudent reserve to ensure continuity if future funding is delayed.\n\n## Description\n\n### Current Metagov Wallet Balances\n\n|     | USDC | ETH | $ENS |\n| --- |:----:|:---:|:----:|\nENS Meta-Gov Main Multisig | 286k\t | 83.7 | 51 |\n*Up to date balance information can be found at https://enswallets.xyz\n\n\n## Expenditures\nMeta-Gov sets aside funds to ensure coverage for mission-critical initiatives. While we strive to estimate term expenditures accurately, the final spending depends on pending initiatives. \n\n### Expected Expenses through April 2025\n\n|                                  | USDC        | ETH   | $ENS  |\n| -------------------------------- | ----------- | ----- | ----- |\n| Steward + Secretary Compensation ¹ | 294k    | -     |       |\n| Governance                       | -           | -     | -     |\n| Contract Audits                                 |     155k        |       |       |\n| DAO Tooling                      | 150k    | -     | -     |\n| Discretionary                    | 40k           | -     | -     |\n| **Total Balance**                | **639k** | **-** | **-** |\n\n### Governance Distributions\nThe governance distribution strategy for Term 6 will be announced and posted as a temp check in the forum. This strategy will then be codified by a DAO vote.\n\n### Description of Initiatives/Pods\n\n**Steward + Secretary Compensation**: Working Group Steward and Secretary compensation as required by [revised steward working group rules](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0x26a5c8dec547837495707e70446d1e7cd874a91f75753c602998f6e70083a266) and [totaling $294,000 USDC to cover the costs for all 9 stewards and supporting roles for a 6 month period](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-dao-steward-compensation/18063).\n ¹This is the expected compensation amount based on existing compensation.  The Meta-governance working group is required by [EP 4.8](https://docs.ens.domains/dao/proposals/4.8) to announce compensation ahead of the next term's steward nominations.  **The current Term 5 stewards will also be proposing Term 6 compensation numbers to the DAO to ensure consensus.  This proposal will take place before the Term 6 nominations to comply with [[EP 4.8](https://docs.ens.domains/dao/proposals/4.8)]**\n\n**Governance**: Fee reimbursements and initiatives related to reducing friction in the governance process. This can also include $ENS distributed in order to lower barriers to the governance proposal process.  The $ENS distributions to stewards and service providers falls into this category.\n\n**Contract Audits**: Meta-governance maintains a balance to be used for contract audits.  These audits are performed independently on contracts that are to be included in executable proposals if those contracts impact or affect any ENS protocol or ENS DAO contracts or processes.  Examples would be any proposed changes to the ENS DAO governor contract or protocol related contracts such as the registrar.\nThis line item is larger than normal because Meta-governance is anticipating potential audits for both governor upgrades and contracts from Service Providers that are contributing to the ENS v2 work.\n \n\n**DAO Tooling**: Developing interfaces and dashboards to improve the governance process and increase transparency across the DAO. An example of DAO tooling spend is our current engagement with Agora as they help build out an enhanced DAO proposal flow to streamline the proposal process.\n\n**Discretionary**: Funds distributed at the discretion of stewards towards new initiatives + governance experiments. In this cycle, we've consolidated the former DAO Sponsorship category into this discretionary category.\n\n \n## Conclusion\n\nThis funding request will allow the ENS Meta-Governance Working Group to continue its essential work in providing governance oversight, supporting the management and operation of working groups, and ensuring effective treasury management for the DAO. The requested funds will enable us to maintain our ongoing initiatives and develop new tools to enhance the governance process. We are grateful for the community's ongoing support and engagement, which is crucial to the success of the ENS DAO. The Meta-Governance Working Group remains committed to serving the ENS community and driving the long-term growth and sustainability of the ecosystem.",

The reimbursement was approved in the previously passed social proposal [EP 5.3](https://docs.ens.domains/dao/proposals/5.3).\n\n## Background\nThe lawsuit that ENS filed in federal district court in Arizona to maintain ownership and control over eth.link has been resolved, and on 26 August 2024, the Court officially closed this case.  \nENS Labs has maintained full ownership and control over the eth.link domain and, therefore, ENS Labs has achieved the initial objective they had when first filing the complaint and obtaining injunctive relief.  To reach this outcome, ENS Labs has spent in total 1,218,669.76 USD. \nThis legal action was necessary to defend the ENS ecosystem and maintain control of the eth.link domain, a critical infrastructure component since 2017.\n\n### Links\n- [EP 5.3 Snapshot Vote](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0x456ccb438eed5d189cbe51e5e36a88d2bb4dc0c61f12f6d9e310a7ba4798d5fc)\n- [Forum Discussion on EP 5.3](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep5-2-social-determine-ens-labs-next-steps-in-eth-link-litigation/18756)\n\n## Specification\nThis executable proposal will initiate a transfer of 1,218,669.76 USDC from the ENS DAO treasury to ENS Labs. This amount represents the final total of all legal expenses related to the eth.link litigation.\n\n### Transaction Details\n- **From:** ENS DAO Treasury (0xFe89cc7aBB2C4183683ab71653C4cdc9B02D44b7)\n- **To:** USDC Token Contract (0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48)\n- **Recipient:** ENS Labs (0x690F0581eCecCf8389c223170778cD9D029606F2)\n- **Amount:** 1,218,669.76 USDC (1218669760000 considering USDC's 6 decimal places)\n- **Purpose:** Reimbursement for legal fees in eth.link litigation\n\n\n\nThis transaction calls the `transfer` function of the USDC contract, transferring 1,218,669.76 USDC to ENS Labs' address.\n\n## Rationale\nThe ENS community, through the passage of EP 5.3, has demonstrated its support for reimbursing ENS Labs for the legal expenses incurred in protecting the eth.link domain. This reimbursement acknowledges the efforts made by ENS Labs to safeguard a critical asset of the ENS ecosystem. It ensures that the financial burden of this legal action does not fall solely on ENS Labs, particularly given that their actions were taken to benefit the entire ENS community.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n*Note - When the orignal snapshot for the social vote was posted it was numbered as 5.2, but it should have been 5.3.  It has been renumbered in the official ENS documentation.  Some links point to forum discussions and Snapshots that show the original duplicitive label of 5.2*",

      "title": "[EP 5.15][Social] ENS Governor Improvement Proposal: ProposalBond",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThe proposal threshold for a new executable ENS proposals is high, and rightly so. ENS is one of the most popular DAOs and community in the Web3 community and keeping the quality bar of proposals to the highest standard is very important. However, ENS also has the treasury and the desire to expand the community and make proposing easier and more accessible to enable more builders to come and build in the ENS ecosystem\n\nAgora proposes adding the functionality of the ProposalBond to the ENS DAO Governor that would allow a proposer to propose with a lower threshold, and then the community could vote [For, Against, Against with penalty, Abstain]. If the weight of Against with penalty + Against > For, then the proposer does not get their bond back and the proposal does not pass.\n\nTo clarify further: a bond is withheld only if a proposal is rejected (the sum of rejections are bigger than the approvals) AND if the “Against with penalty” is bigger than “Against”.\n\nThis way we align incentives to create good proposals.\n\n## Specification\n\nA discussion in the DAO Meta-Gov working group titled: Seeking Feedback: ENS Governor Upgrade to make proposing more accessible, Agora proposed the following PR on the ENS Governor: Proposal Bond Pull Request which outlines the code needed to make this change happen.\n\nSince the time of that PR and during the follow up discussions, the community has asked for the following additions:\n\n- Ensure that the ProposalBond work proposed by Agora works with the new Veto rules and security council. This covers the case of a proposal being vetod from within the timelock therefore making sure we have the code to handle that case. The default case here being that the bond would not be returned.\n- Work with OpenZeppelin to see if we can bring this functionality into OZ Governance Core\n- Collaborate with ScopeLift to bring in a few sensible defaults to the voting delay period which is currently set to only one block. This leaves the DAO open to attack and the MetaGov working group is agreed on a 24 hour delay to ensure the DAO time to protect itself if needed. These changes aren't related to the ProposalBond work but very important if we are going to preform a governor upgrade.\n\nAgora is committed to building public goods and is already working closely with OpenZeppelin to bring innovations of Agora's Governor into OZ Governance Core and are excited to propose this to new OZ Governor Working Group.\n\nGiven that the proposal threshold of this new functionality will be the most important value, there is a general consensus in the discussion that 1,000 ENS is the right initial value. This parameter can later be set by governance and moved up and down as we see fit.\n\n## Voting\n\nWe are putting this to a simple, for/again/abstain vote\n\n## Next Steps\n\nShould the vote pass, Agora will be responsible for:\n\n- finalizing the implementation\n- working with ScopeLift to review the code and add in the Voting Delay logic\n- securing and organizing the audits\n- making any changes raised by the auditors\n- getting the code ready for a governor upgrade\n\n## Auditing\n\nGiven the potential impact of the change, we are going to work with the ENS MetaGov stewards to do 2 audits on this code: one chosen by Agora, and the other chosen by the stewards.\n\nAgora recommends will be using OpenZeppelin, a reputable and top tier auditor in the governance space.\n\nAgora recommends that the MetaGov stewards pick from: CodeArena, Trail of Bits, Spearbit or Trust Security. Each of these are quality auditing firms with a proven track record of working with governance contracts.\n\nBoth of these audits will be funded by ENS, and code changes will be implemented by Agora as part of their service contract with ENS, at no additional charge.\n\nResults and changes will be posted for everyone to see and discuss.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nFor this social proposal to pass, the following quorum and voting requirements must be met:\n\n**Quorum**: The proposal must receive a minimum of 1% of the total supply of $ENS (1 million votes) in the form of \"Yes\" and \"Abstain\" votes combined. \"No\" votes do not count towards quorum.\n\n**Approval**: Once the quorum is reached, the proposal requires a simple majority (>50%) of \"Yes\" votes among the \"Yes\" and \"No\" votes to pass. \"Abstain\" votes do not count towards the approval calculation.",

      "content": "# Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to introduce new permissions for deploying Endowment funds, focusing on improved diversification and alignment with the evolving market landscape and liquidity. We are also introducing an independent audit report together with the Permissions Update; this will be the standard practice for Permissions Updates going forward.\n\n# Motivation\n\nEffective treasury management strategies must be adapted to market conditions and protocol updates; for existing Permissions, there might be migrations and introductions of new pools; for new Permissions, protocols and pools that were previously considered immature and unsuitable for the Endowment’s risk appetite may become viable options as they become more time- and battle-tested. This proposal seeks to request new permissions from the ENS DAO for karpatkey, enabling the introduction of new yield-generation strategies for the Endowment.\n\nThe new permissions have also been audited by [ThirdGuard](https://thirdguard.com/), an independent 3rd-party, to ensure the suggested changes have been thoroughly reviewed by a technically-competent, independent party.\n\n# Specification\n\n## New permissions implemented in this payload\n\n1. Deposit osETH on Aave v3;\n2. Stake (and unstake) ETH on Stakewise v3. Through the [Genesis Vault](https://app.stakewise.io/vault/mainnet/0xac0f906e433d58fa868f936e8a43230473652885).\n3. Mint (and burn) osETH on Stakewise v3. Through the Genesis Vault.\n4. WETH/osETH pool on Balancer;\n5. WETH/osETH pool on Aura Finance;\n6. Swaps:\n\n* WETH \\<> osETH on Balancer\n* USDC \\<> osETH on Uniswap v3\n* USDC \\<> WETH \\<> osETH on CoW Swap\n* RPL \\<> WETH on Uniswap v3\n* RPL \\<> WETH on CoW Swap\n\n1. Unsign order on Cow Protocol so that a pending order that has been submitted but not executed can be cancelled.\n\n## Additional implementation details\n\n1. The enableModule(address module) function is called to enable the modules, pointing it to the [Avatar address](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x4F2083f5fBede34C2714aFfb3105539775f7FE64) (the Endowment).\n2. The payload to be executed upon the successful approval of this proposal can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/JeronimoHoulin/55f50e86d1dc874e4e685d5e9b496a67). The proposed permissions policy can be visualised in the aforementioned [link](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0x703806E61847984346d2D7DDd853049627e50A40/roles/MANAGER/diff/C5Twf3khKv2Ny8PvzoARgHFKFFK8vIiNR7nDkrIM?annotations=false) for ease of review.\n3. We have tested the payload to make sure all interactions mentioned on this proposal work as expected through our [Test Safe](https://app.safe.global/transactions/history?safe=eth:0xC01318baB7ee1f5ba734172bF7718b5DC6Ec90E1).\n4. With the introduction of the [new Roles App Permissions Visualisation tool](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0x703806E61847984346d2D7DDd853049627e50A40/roles/MANAGER?annotations=false), manually updating the “Preset Permissions - ENS Endowment” [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KU4a7s-AxAAAPJxd8vexn7kCl8hsr3-c7VIDfEPHbKc/edit?usp=sharing) is no longer necessary. The new tool provides an up-to-date and accurate method for exploring the current permissions granted to karpatkey by the ENS DAO.\n\n# Auditing process\n\n## Introduction of an independent audit report\n\nWe have received feedback in the previous proposal that independent, 3rd party code review would be helpful for the ENS community and delegates to make a more informed decision and to reduce delegate fatigue.\n\nIn our commitment to transparency and effort towards DAO efficiency, karpatkey decided to engage with independent, third-party firms / individuals for every contract upgrade starting with this proposal. [ThirdGuard](https://thirdguard.com/) has been engaged for this proposal’s code review; ThirdGuard is a provider of on-chain risk monitoring solutions, and has been working with the Zodiac Roles Modifier since its inception (and its precursor, Scope Guard). Given their past experiences across Zodiac Roles Modifier, Solidity, and DeFi risk management, ThirdGuard was deemed to be a suitable candidate to fulfil the role of policy reviewer. Their approach to auditing the permissions can be found [here](https://www.loom.com/share/0b3cbcd6907a4455ab45ead4887c7f9a?sid=9bd0a2c7-d932-45c0-acad-8516201c56ea).\n\n**The ThirdGuard audit for the permissions in this payload can be found** [**here**](https://github.com/ThirdGuard/roles-policy-audits/blob/main/ENS/ens-policy-audit-v2-21st-Aug-2024.pdf)**.**\n\nAudit report summary is as follows:\n\n* No material findings were found.\n* Policy changes requested were considered bona fide actions needed by the Manager to carry out their DeFi operations.\n* 1 Informational Finding and 1 Warning were logged, and acknowledged by karpatkey. These findings do not post an immediate risk but are relevant to security best practices.",

      "content": "\\## Abstract\n\nThe primary mission of ENS DAO is to govern the protocol and allocate resources from the treasury in line with the DAO's constitution and broader objectives. However, due to changing economic dynamics, the DAO is increasingly vulnerable to attacks aimed at draining its treasury.\n\n\n\nTo safeguard the DAO's integrity and longevity, a Security Council with the authority to cancel malicious proposals is needed. To avoid perpetuating centralized power, the Security Council's authority will have a built-in expiration date. After two years, anyone will be able to call a \\[function]\\(https://github.com/blockful-io/security-council-ens/blob/main/src/SecurityCouncil.sol#L59) that revokes the council's power to veto proposals, ensuring a time-limited mechanism to counter malicious attacks while promoting more delegation and governance distribution.\n\n\n\n!\\[security-council-diagram]\\(https://hackmd.io/\\_uploads/BJb0bHP\\_A.png)\n\n\n\n\\## Motivation\n\nAs ENS continues to grow, its treasury in ETH is always growing. Simultaneously, the percentage of tokens actively delegated is on the decline.\n\n\n\nThis imbalance creates a risk where an attacker could acquire enough $ENS to gain control of the DAO at a cost lower than the treasury's total value. This has been a growing concern since March 2023.\n\n\n\nPast attacks on DAOs have exploited similar vulnerabilities, with some \\[being thwarted]\\(https://x.com/AragonProject/status/1656028382939815937) by components with veto power. Currently, the ENS governance process involves a proposal passing through the governor, relying on delegated voting power for approval. If approved, the governor queues the proposal in a timelock contract, delaying execution by two days. While the governor can cancel proposals, it follows the same pathway as a malicious proposal, introducing potential risks.\n\n\n\nThe short-term solution was delegating 3.8M $ENS to a contract that can only vote \"Against\"; more details about this can be found in \\[Nick's forum post]\\(https://discuss.ens.domains/t/introducing-veto-ensdao-eth/19088). The attack is still profitable and, depending on market conditions can be up to a 3x ROI, like in Dec 2023. We need a \\*\\*mid-term solution\\*\\* to cancel the attack, which is this proposal. An article about this research done by the Blockful team will be published \\[here]\\(https://blockful.io/blog/ens-security-council) after the proposal is executed and there is no attack risk.\n\n\n\n\\## Specification\n\nTo enhance security, the \\[SecurityCouncil contract]\\(https://github.com/blockful-io/security-council-ens/blob/main/src/SecurityCouncil.sol) will be deployed, receiving the PROPOSER\\_ROLE in the timelock, granting it the ability to cancel proposals (callable only by the \\[Security Council multisig]\\(https://etherscan.io/address/0xaa5cd05f6b62c3af58ae9c4f3f7a2acc2cdc2cc7)) without the power to initiate or modify other DAO actions. \\*\\*The scope of this proposal is to assign the PROPOSER\\_ROLE to the SecurityCouncil contract (\\[Etherscan]\\(https://etherscan.io/address/0xb8fa0ce3f91f41c5292d07475b445c35ddf63ee0#code))\\*\\*.\n\n\n\nTo ensure decentralization, the contract will also feature a time-based expiration mechanism that allows anyone to revoke the PROPOSER\\_ROLE after two years. This window provides time to strengthen delegation and address current vulnerabilities, facilitating the DAO's transition to a more secure governance scenario.\n\n\n\n\\## Security considerations\n\nAssigning the PROPOSER\\_ROLE to a multisig within the timelock contract is overly broad for our requirements as it allows the address to create operations in the timelock. If the multisig signers are compromised, they could potentially propose and execute malicious changes. Therefore our approach is deploying a new contract similar to the current veto.ensdao.eth contract, which can only do one action: to CANCEL a transaction in the timelock, triggered only by the security council multisig.\n\n\n\nThe risk is mitigated but one scenario remains: if the whole multisig is compromised then a malicious entity could kick other signers and effectively stop the DAO from executing proposals by canceling all transactions, including any that would remove this contract from the PROPOSER\\_ROLE. Anyways, after 2 years, \\[anyone can remove the PROPOSER\\_ROLE from the contract]\\(https://github.com/blockful-io/security-council-ens/blob/main/src/SecurityCouncil.sol#L59).\n\n\n\n\\## Council Operations\n\nIt is in the best interest of everyone to make clear the expectations and responsibilities ENS DAO put on those members, backed by the reputation, other roles and gains those might have in the organization.\n\n\n\nThe security council is expected to act only in emergency, in the given following situations or similar cases:\n\n\n\n\\* If a proposal goes against the ENS constitution\n\n\\* If a proposal is approved with malicious intent against the DAO longevity/sustainability\n\n\\* If such proposal is approved by any group of voters, but directly financially incentivised to vote against the DAOs interests to preserve their own financial stake.\n\n\\* If any approved proposal goes directly against the DAO for the sole benefit of an attacker.\n\n\n\n\\## Relevant links\n\n\n\n\\- SecurityCouncil contract (\\[GitHub]\\(https://github.com/blockful-io/security-council-ens/blob/main/src/SecurityCouncil.sol), \\[Etherscan]\\(https://etherscan.io/address/0xb8fa0ce3f91f41c5292d07475b445c35ddf63ee0#code))\n\n\\- Security Council multisig (\\[Safe]\\(https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0xaA5cD05f6B62C3af58AE9c4F3F7A2aCC2Cdc2Cc7), \\[Etherscan]\\(https://etherscan.io/address/0xaA5cD05f6B62C3af58AE9c4F3F7A2aCC2Cdc2Cc7))\n\n\\- Snapshot proposals:\n\n&#x20;   \\- \\[\\[EP5.7]\\[Social] Security Council]\\(https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xf3a4673fe04a3ecfed4a2f066f6ced1539a5466d61630428333360b843653c54)\n\n&#x20;   \\- \\[\\[EP5.10]\\[Social] Confirming the ENS DAO Security Council Members]\\(https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xa0b1bfadf6853b5b0d59d3c4d73c434fc6389339887d05de805361372eb17c3a)\n\n\\- \\[Forum discussion]\\(https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-enable-cancel-role-on-the-dao/19090/19)",

      "title": "[EP 5.12] Roles Modifier V2 Migration & Updates to Endowment Permissions",
      "content": "# Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to roll out an updated version of the Zodiac Roles Modifier module. The new version improves usability and transparency of treasury management operations. Upon approval, the Roles Modifier v2 module will be activated.\n\nFurthermore, this proposal requests authorization from the DAO to revise the permissions policy. A notable change includes enabling swapping actions on CoW Swap while the other permissions primarily focus on eliminating obsolete actions and protocols, and refining parameters within the existing permissions.\n\n# Roles v2 Migration\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs [previously stated](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-initiation/15952#a-list-of-zodiac-roles-modifier-permissions-for-the-manager-role-9), the Zodiac Roles Modifier facilitates karpatkey’s proxy management of the Endowment by ensuring that only pre-approved transactions, defined by the permissions policy voted on by the DAO, can be executed. In collaboration with karpatkey, the Gnosis Guild team has significantly upgraded the Zodiac Roles Modifier module and the Zodiac Roles app. These enhancements have resulted in a more powerful and robust on-chain permissions infrastructure with the following improvements:\n\n* **Introduction of Allowances**: Implementation of spending limits within permissions.\n* **Enhanced Call Data Scoping Toolset**: This toolset considerably broadens the range of functions that can have permissions set, increasing flexibility.\n* **Advanced Logical Conditions**: Allows for the creation of complex permissions structures to accommodate sophisticated operational needs.\n* **Compatibility with** [**DeFi Kit**](https://kit.karpatkey.com/): This feature integrates with karpatkey’s permissions policy building module, facilitating the straightforward crafting of protocol actions.\n* **Improved Visualisation and User Interface**: the new [Zodiac Roles app UI 1](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/) not only displays permissions clearly but also provides a user-friendly interface to compare changes in each policy update, enhancing transparency and simplifying audits.\n\nFor more detailed information, please refer to the following resources:\n\n* **Documentation**: [The Zodiac Roles Modifier](https://docs.roles.gnosisguild.org/)\n* **Articles**: [Evolving Smart Accounts with Onchain Permissions](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/oQcy_c62huwNkFS0cMIxXwQzrfG0ESQax8EBc_tWwwk), [Permissions as code 1](https://engineering.gnosisguild.org/posts/permissions-as-code)\n\n## Contract Audits\n\nThe Zodiac Roles Modifier v2 contract has been rigorously audited by G0 Group, the internal auditing team of Gnosis DAO, and by [Omniscia](https://omniscia.io/). The detailed audit reports are available for review [here 1](https://github.com/gnosisguild/zodiac-modifier-roles/tree/main/packages/evm/docs).\n\n# Changes to the Permissions Policy\n\nThis proposal outlines the following modifications to the permissions policy:\n\n1. **Token Arrays for Swapping**:\n   1. Considering the tokens involved in the existing permissions, we have updated the token arrays to ensure they can be seamlessly swapped across the various whitelisted protocols and aggregators.\n   2. **Token IN Allowlist**: \\[CRV, DAI, USDT, BAL, AURA, CVX, ETHx, COMP, rETH, SWISE, wstETH, LDO, WETH, ankrETH, USDC, stETH].\n   3. **Token OUT Allowlist**: \\[DAI, USDT, USDC, rETH, wstETH, WETH, stETH].\n   4. The above arrays are to be utilised for swapping on CoW Swap, with equivalent lists replicated for Uniswap v3 and Balancer.\n2. **Introduction of CoW Swap** ([diff 4](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1/diff/C0zUV4NtNErufEpbpNc2S55F2oiAGw8aKE2jYwWjLg?annotations=false#right-0x23da9ade38e4477b23770ded512fd37b12381fab)): 5. Addition of a **CoW Swap Order signer** to enable gas-minimised and MEV-protected swaps. This includes an extensive set of aggregated exchange routes, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of required swaps. 6. Tokens will be swapped on CoW Swap according to the token IN/OUT allowlists mentioned above.\n3. **Deprecations and Removals**: 7. **Uniswap v2 Swaps** ([diff 1](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1/diff/C0zUV4NtNErufEpbpNc2S55F2oiAGw8aKE2jYwWjLg?annotations=false#left-0x68b3465833fb72a70ecdf485e0e4c7bd8665fc45-0x472b43f3)): Removed due to insufficient liquidity in V2 pools. 8. **Stakewise v2**: Deprecated functions related to deposit ([diff 1](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1/diff/C0zUV4NtNErufEpbpNc2S55F2oiAGw8aKE2jYwWjLg?annotations=false#left-0xc874b064f465bdd6411d45734b56fac750cda29a)) and claim ([diff 1](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1/diff/C0zUV4NtNErufEpbpNc2S55F2oiAGw8aKE2jYwWjLg?annotations=false#left-0xa3f21010e8b9a3930996c8849df38f9ca3647c20)) functions in light of the recent launch of Stakewise v3. Consequently, permitted actions related to Stakewise v2’s sETH2-ETH Uniswap pool are also removed ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1/diff/C0zUV4NtNErufEpbpNc2S55F2oiAGw8aKE2jYwWjLg?annotations=false#left-0xc36442b4a4522e871399cd717abdd847ab11fe88)). 9. **Compound v2** ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1/diff/C0zUV4NtNErufEpbpNc2S55F2oiAGw8aKE2jYwWjLg?annotations=false#left-0x39aa39c021dfbae8fac545936693ac917d5e7563)): Discontinued all actions targeting v2 contracts and v2 cTokens (cUSDC and cDAI) due to the ongoing transition of the protocol to its v3. 10. **Revocation of Existing/Obsolete Allowances:** All existing and outdated allowances previously set by the Endowment are revoked (set to zero). The ability to call the corresponding approve functions is included in the newly proposed policy. Accordingly, the payload contains a bundle of transactions to revoke these allowances.\n4. **Updates**: 11. **Uniswap v3** ([diff 1](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1/diff/C0zUV4NtNErufEpbpNc2S55F2oiAGw8aKE2jYwWjLg?annotations=false#right-0x68b3465833fb72a70ecdf485e0e4c7bd8665fc45-0x04e45aaf)) **and Balancer** ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1/diff/C0zUV4NtNErufEpbpNc2S55F2oiAGw8aKE2jYwWjLg?annotations=false#right-0xba12222222228d8ba445958a75a0704d566bf2c8)): Adjusted to allow the mentioned token IN/OUT allowlists. 12. **Curve Pools**: Addition of stETH-ng (factory) pool ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1/diff/rMNui3Yp9LlBScVLFjY9cWkk4QGYoIVkkYxURs16ys?annotations=false#right-0x21e27a5e5513d6e65c4f830167390997aa84843a)) and removal of cUSDC + cDAI pool ([diff 1](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1/diff/rMNui3Yp9LlBScVLFjY9cWkk4QGYoIVkkYxURs16ys?annotations=false#left-0xa2b47e3d5c44877cca798226b7b8118f9bfb7a56); Compound v2 tokens). 13. **Curve ZAP Deposit Contract** ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1/diff/rMNui3Yp9LlBScVLFjY9cWkk4QGYoIVkkYxURs16ys?annotations=false#right-0x56c526b0159a258887e0d79ec3a80dfb940d0cd7)): Introduced to allow depositing and staking of LP tokens in a single step. 14. **Convex Staking** ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1/diff/C0zUV4NtNErufEpbpNc2S55F2oiAGw8aKE2jYwWjLg?annotations=false#right-0x6b27d7bc63f1999d14ff9ba900069ee516669ee8)): Added the CVX/stETH Rewards contract. 15. **Lido Withdrawals** ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1/diff/C0zUV4NtNErufEpbpNc2S55F2oiAGw8aKE2jYwWjLg?annotations=false#right-0x889edc2edab5f40e902b864ad4d7ade8e412f9b1)): Enhanced to include new withdrawal methods using permits for both wstETH and stETH; methods include `requestWithdrawalsWstETHWithPermit` and `requestWithdrawalsWithPermit`. 16. **Spark Rewards Claim** ([diff 1](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1/diff/C0zUV4NtNErufEpbpNc2S55F2oiAGw8aKE2jYwWjLg?annotations=false#right-0x4370d3b6c9588e02ce9d22e684387859c7ff5b34)): Added functionality to claim wstETH rewards in Spark.\n\n# Audit Considerations\n\nWe highly value the community’s involvement in reviewing and providing feedback on this proposal. We encourage members with the necessary technical expertise to examine the content carefully (including this [payload 1](https://gist.github.com/santinomics/773117b729152f31a121045f4ba26b5b)) and share their insights with us.\n\nFor effective testing of the permissions policy configuration, we have utilised a [Testing Avatar Safe 1](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0xC01318baB7ee1f5ba734172bF7718b5DC6Ec90E1). This safe mirrors the current state of the [permissions policy v4 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ker_TkBJV0xmQ9Li9HB-vtdlpx1vEeVEQwpIH6WoK0o) granted by the Endowment to the Manager SAFE operated by karpatkey. The enhancements in the Zodiac Roles app interface now allow for a clear visualisation of all existing permissions, accessible [here 2](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xbd1099dfd3c11b65fb4bb19a350da2f5b61efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1).\n\nThe updated interface also simplifies the process of identifying [changes](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1/diff/C0zUV4NtNErufEpbpNc2S55F2oiAGw8aKE2jYwWjLg?annotations=false) by displaying the current permissions policy on the left side and the newly proposed policy on the right side. To further aid in the adoption and understanding of these tools for audit purposes, we have detailed the proposed changes in [version 5 documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KU4a7s-AxAAAPJxd8vexn7kCl8hsr3-c7VIDfEPHbKc/edit), following our standard Policy Update Request (PUR) format.\n\n# Additional considerations\n\n## Roles Modifier v1 and Enabling of v2\n\nThe existing Roles Modifier v1 module will remain active to ensure a smooth transition and prevent any unexpected disruptions in operational execution. Ownership of the deployed [Roles Modifier v2 module 1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x703806E61847984346d2D7DDd853049627e50A40), equipped with the new proposed permissions policy, has been [transferred 1](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x78c69c7ad0c5f430d97ec5c3bac5cb649d831a756b3d4c5b09b45152427ae8f4) to the Endowment’s Avatar Safe. These permissions are displayed [here 4](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0x703806e61847984346d2d7ddd853049627e50a40/roles/MANAGER) and match those shown on the comparison interface [here 1](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1/diff/rMNui3Yp9LlBScVLFjY9cWkk4QGYoIVkkYxURs16ys?annotations=false). The payload will only activate this module, marking the first phase of the migration process. A subsequent policy update proposal will seek to disable the v1 module.\n\n## Policy Visualisation in Terms of DeFi Kit Actions\n\nThe “show annotations” button, located at the top-right [here 1](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/ENS-MANAGER-V1/diff/rMNui3Yp9LlBScVLFjY9cWkk4QGYoIVkkYxURs16ys?annotations=false), provides a visualisation of the proposed permissions policy expressed through the DeFi Kit Protocol Actions. This feature offers a more abstract and simplified description of the policy, enhancing understanding and accessibility.",

      "title": "[EP5.10][Social] Confirming the ENS DAO Security Council Members",
      "content": "## Abstract\nFollowing the successful passing of the [EP5.7](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xf3a4673fe04a3ecfed4a2f066f6ced1539a5466d61630428333360b843653c54), this proposal aims to confirm the 8 individuals who will form the Security Council with the permissions defined in [EP5.7](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xf3a4673fe04a3ecfed4a2f066f6ced1539a5466d61630428333360b843653c54). The Security Council will be responsible for protecting the organization from potential governance attacks by having the ability to cancel malicious proposals using the [SecurityCouncil](https://github.com/blockful-io/security-council-ens/blob/main/README.md) smart contract.\n\n## Specification\nA discussion was held in the ENS forum titled **[[Temp Check] Enable CANCEL role on the DAO](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-enable-cancel-role-on-the-dao/19090)**. \nFollowing that discussion, The [EP5.7](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xf3a4673fe04a3ecfed4a2f066f6ced1539a5466d61630428333360b843653c54) proposal, which can be [found here](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xf3a4673fe04a3ecfed4a2f066f6ced1539a5466d61630428333360b843653c54), detailed the need for a Security Council to mitigate the risk of governance attacks on the ENS DAO. The proposal passed with overwhelming support from the community, receiving 1.4 million votes and 100% approval.\n\nAs outlined in the [EP5.7](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xf3a4673fe04a3ecfed4a2f066f6ced1539a5466d61630428333360b843653c54) proposal, the [SecurityCouncil](https://github.com/blockful-io/security-council-ens/blob/main/README.md) smart contract will be deployed, and the Security Council multisig will be granted the PROPOSER_ROLE in the timelock. This will allow the Security Council to cancel malicious proposals, without granting the ability to initiate proposals, vote on proposals, or perform any other actions. The contract also features an expiration mechanism that automatically revokes the council's veto power after 2 years, promoting decentralization.\n\n### Proposed Security Council Members\nThe proposed Security Council will consist of the following 8 individuals in a 4/8 multisig configuration:\n\n1. [nick.eth](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/delegate/nick.eth)\n2. [griff.eth](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/delegate/0x839395e20bbb182fa440d08f850e6c7a8f6f0780)\n3. [avsa.eth](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/delegate/avsa.eth)\n4. [lefteris.eth](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/delegate/lefteris.eth)\n5. [katherineykwu.eth](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/delegate/katherineykwu.eth)\n6. [fireeyes.eth](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/delegate/fireeyesdao.eth)\n7. [brantly.eth](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/delegate/brantly.eth)\n8. [alextnetto.eth](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/delegate/alextnetto.eth)\n\nThe text of [EP5.7](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xf3a4673fe04a3ecfed4a2f066f6ced1539a5466d61630428333360b843653c54) specified that the 5 delegates included on the veto contract would be included in the security council. To fill the remaining 3 places on the council, consideration was given to, delegation power, past activity in governance, economic skin on the game, and jurisdictional diversity (for legal reasons). \n\n### Voting\nThis social proposal seeks to confirm the complete list of 8 individuals as the Security Council members. **The vote will be a simple For/Against/Abstain vote on the entire list.** If the proposal is successful, a separate executable proposal will be put forward to deploy the SecurityCouncil smart contract and grant the necessary roles.\n\nFor this vote, the 8 proposed members of the Security Council will vote \"**Abstain**\" to help meet quorum requirements while preserving their impartiality.\n\n### Next Steps\nUpon confirmation of the Security Council members through this social proposal, the following steps will be taken:\n\n1. The SecurityCouncil contract will be manually deployed to Mainnet.\n2. A multsig will be manually created with the 8 members as signers.\n3. The multisig will accept ownership of the SecurityCouncil contract.\n4. The executable proposal will grant the PROPOSER_ROLE to the SecurityCouncil contract address using the grantRole function in the timelock.\n\nOnce the executable proposal is passed and the contract is deployed with the necessary roles granted, the Security Council will be able to cancel malicious proposals to protect the ENS DAO. \n\nAfter the specified expiration period (2 years), anyone can revoke the PROPOSER_ROLE from the Security Council, ensuring this is a time-limited mechanism that defaults back to a more decentralized posture.\n\n\n\n## Success Criteria \n\nFor this social proposal to pass, the following quorum and voting requirements must be met:\n\n1. **Quorum**: The proposal must receive a minimum of 1% of the total supply of $ENS (1 million votes) in the form of \"Yes\" and \"Abstain\" votes combined. \"No\" votes do not count towards quorum.\n\n2. **Approval**: Once the quorum is reached, the proposal requires a simple majority (>50%) of \"Yes\" votes among the \"Yes\" and \"No\" votes to pass. \"Abstain\" votes do not count towards the approval calculation.",

This can also include $ENS distributed in order to lower barriers to the governance proposal process.  The $ENS distributions to stewards and service providers falls into this catagory.\n\n\n\n**DAO Tooling**: Developing interfaces and dashboards to improve the governance process and increase transparency across the DAO. An example of DAO tooling spend is our current engagement with Agora as they help build out an enhanced DAO proposal flow to streamline the proposal process.\n\n**Discretionary**: Funds distributed at the discretion of stewards towards new initiatives + governance experiments. In this cycle, we've consolidated the former DAO Sponsorship category into this discretionary category.\n\n \n## Conclusion\n\nThis funding request will allow the ENS Meta-Governance Working Group to continue its essential work in providing governance oversight, supporting the management and operation of working groups, and ensuring effective treasury management for the DAO. The requested funds will enable us to maintain our ongoing initiatives and develop new tools to enhance the governance process. We are grateful for the community's ongoing support and engagement, which is crucial to the success of the ENS DAO. The Meta-Governance Working Group remains committed to serving the ENS community and driving the long-term growth and sustainability of the ecosystem.",

      "title": "[5.8][Social] ENS Steward Vesting Proposal",
      "content": "## Abstract\nFollowing discussion in the Metagov funding request thread and feedback on the Temp Check Proposal, we have put together this amendment proposal which looks to add the requirement of vesting to ENS distributions to stewards for the current term.\n\nUnder the current proposal, the MetaGov Working Group will be distributed liquid ENS tokens which will then be distributed individually to stewards. As discussed on the forum and on Meta-Gov calls, these tokens should be vested in order to ensure long-term alignment of stewards with the DAO, whilst ensuring that they are able to use the tokens to particiapte in governance.\n\nThis proposal is only in reference to adding vesting to current term steward allocations. With more discussion and input needed for any other changes to steward compensation going forward.\n\n## Specification\nAll ENS disbursements to stewards will be vested on a linear 24 month schedule from the time of their appointment. In line with the 12 month term that each steward serves plus an additional 12 months of vesting to encourage longterm DAO alignment.\n\nThis vesting will be implemented by using Hedgey which allows stewards to access the full voting power of their allocated tokens up front, whilst ensuring that the monetary value of these tokens can only be accessed based on the vesting schedule.\n\nAll ENS marked for steward compensation will be transferred via executable proposal to the metagov WG multisig. Term 5 stewards were appointed at the beginning of Q1 2024, and as such are already 4 and a half months into their term.\n\nFor the current term’s stewards, ENS vesting will be scaled retroactively based on the time since their appointment. ~37.5% of ENS will be distributed to stewards directly from the multisig, whilst the remaining ENS will then be deposited into each steward’s vesting contract. These contracts will be set up by Hedgey.\n\n## Vote\n* For - Apply vesting to the current term\n* Against - Do not apply vesting to the current term in line with the 2023/2024 guidance\n* Abstain\n\nThis vote adjusts the structure of ENS token distributions to stewards, and if passed, the Meta-gov working group will implement this vesting schedule (and associated tooling) for all ENS token distributions to stewards.",

      "title": "[EP5.7][Social] Security Council",
      "content": "# Abstract\nThe primary mission of ENS DAO is to govern the protocol and allocate resources from the treasury in line with the DAO's constitution and broader objectives. However, due to changing economic dynamics, the DAO is increasingly vulnerable to attacks aimed at draining its treasury.\n\nTo safeguard the DAO's integrity and longevity, a Security Council with the authority to cancel malicious proposals is needed. To avoid perpetuating centralized power, the Security Council's authority will have a built-in expiration date. After two years, anyone will be able to call a function that revokes the council's power to veto proposals, ensuring a time-limited mechanism to counter malicious attacks while promoting more delegation and governance distribution.\n\n# Motivation\nAs ENS continues to grow, its treasury in ETH is always growing. Simultaneously, the percentage of tokens actively delegated is on the decline.  \n\n![Dune.png](ipfs://bafkreifqrdrm5t3qzlbbsssdlebild2azbfovyjixwa5cedlg5f3ijsxuu)\n\nThis imbalance creates a risk where an attacker could acquire enough $ENS to gain control of the DAO at a cost lower than the treasury's total value. This has been a growing concern since March 2023. \n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreicuwrazcaaxvn6ywavjzc2ozutbmnbt5q2pd2lfakb6d7iszfq4q4)\n\nPast attacks on DAOs have exploited similar vulnerabilities, with some [being thwarted](https://twitter.com/AragonProject/status/1656028382939815937) by components with veto power. Currently, the ENS governance process involves a proposal passing through the governor, relying on delegated voting power for approval. If approved, the governor queues the proposal in a timelock contract, delaying execution by two days. While the governor can cancel proposals, it follows the same pathway as a malicious proposal, introducing potential risks.\n\nThe short-term solution was delegating 3.8M $ENS to a contract that can only vote \"Against\"; more details about this can be found in [Nick's forum post](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/introducing-veto-ensdao-eth/19088). The attack is still profitable and, depending on market conditions can be up to a 3x ROI, like in Dec 2023. We need a mid-term solution to cancel the attack, which is this proposal. An article about this research done by the Blockful team will be published [here](https://blockful.io/blog/ens-security-council-snapshot) after the proposal is executed and there is no attack risk.\n\n# Specification\nTo enhance security, a veto contract will be deployed. Controlled by a Security Council multisig and will have the PROPOSER_ROLE in the timelock, granting it the ability to cancel proposals without the power to initiate or modify other DAO actions. The scope of this proposal is to assign the PROPOSER_ROLE to the veto contract,\n\nTo ensure decentralization, the contract will also feature a time-based expiration mechanism that allows anyone to revoke the PROPOSER_ROLE after two years. This window provides time to strengthen delegation and address current vulnerabilities, facilitating the DAO's transition to a more secure governance model.\n\n# Security considerations\nAssigning the PROPOSER_ROLE to a multisig within the timelock contract is overly broad for our requirements as it allows the address to add proposals directly to the queue. If the multisig signers are compromised, they could potentially propose and execute malicious changes. Therefore our approach would be to deploy a new contract similar to the current veto.ensdao.eth contract, which can only do one action: to CANCEL a transaction in the timelock. That would be a trivially simple contract and it would be hard locked to only accept calls from a newly created SAFE multisig.\n\nThe risk is mitigated but one scenario remains: if the whole multisig is compromised then a malicious entity could kick other signers and effectively stop the DAO from executing proposals by canceling all transactions, including any that would remove this contract from the proposal role. Anyways, after 2 years, anyone can remove the proposal role.\n\nWith that in light. the following considerations are essential for ensuring the Security Council's multisig operates securely:\n\n- Availability of Signers: It is critical to avoid scenarios where signers are unavailable during emergencies. Events like the Shanghai attack, where real-life occurrences prevent signers from accessing their wallets, must be avoided. Council members should ensure wallets and necessary equipment are accessible at all times.\n- Secure Wallet Practices: Security Council addresses should be exclusive to ENS-related operations. Private keys must be stored using best practices to minimize exposure to risks.\n\nFinding the right balance for the multisig threshold is crucial. A higher threshold can complicate coordination but reduces the risk of malicious activity. A lower threshold, while more agile, could make the DAO more susceptible to attacks or unintended consequences if a few signers are compromised. The suggested composition is a 4/8 multisig.\n\n# Council Operations\nIt is in the best interest of everyone to make clear the expectations and responsibilities ENS DAO put on those members, backed by the reputation, other roles and gains those might have in the organization. \n\nThe security council is expected to act only in emergency, in the given following situations or similar cases:\n- If a proposal goes against the ENS constitution\n- If a proposal is approved with malicious intent against the DAO longevity/sustainability\n- If such proposal is approved by any group of voters, but directly financially incentivised to vote against the DAOs interests to preserve their own financial stake.\n- If any approved proposal goes directly against the DAO for the sole benefit of an attacker.\n\nThose definitions are not exhaustive, and the trust deposited in the elected members for the council also encompasses the trust in their capacity to: \n- understand ENS DAO thoroughly\n- listening to the community feedback on extreme situations\n- take quick action on behalf of the DAO\n- comprehend the proposals being approved and their repercussions\n\nThe Security Council members will be the same signers for the veto.ensdao.eth, their identities are known, have signed a pledged to uphold the ENS constitution and live in countries with a solid legal system.",

Large Grants will resume in Q2. With five grantees completing milestones from last term, the budget includes remaining payouts yet to be disbursed. We plan to add at least two more grantees during Q2 while piloting new grants management software. In the second half of the year, we will run another full-size round supporting up to 10 grantees at a time with a 200k USD total prize pool.\n\n## Small Grants\n\nMultiple micro-grantsvoted on by the community. Small Grants will resume during the first half of the year shortly after ETHDenver. We have added the amount expected to spend through the end of the year with no increase from last term. This is approximately 12.5 ETH per quarter. With market fluctuations, stewards may right-size and lower the amounts distributed during round\n\n## Events and Hackathons\n\nThe working group will support Public Goods events and hackathons. Funds have included expenses related to the funding of hackathons, events, and related participation in events (judging, panels, speaking) where necessary.\n\nThe current earmarked events are:\n\n* [ETHGuatemala](https://ethereum.gt/)\n* [EthLatam](https://ethlatam.org/)\n* [ETHGlobal London](https://ethglobal.com/events/london2024)\n* [ETHCanal](https://www.ethcanal.xyz/)\n* [ETHCC](https://ethcc.io/)\n* [ETHGlobal Brussels](https://ethglobal.com/events/brussels)\n* [DAO Tokyo](https://dao-tokyo.xyz/)\n* [ETHGlobal San Francisco](https://ethglobal.com/events/sanfrancisco2024)\n* [ETHGlobal Bangkok](https://ethglobal.com/events/bangkok)\n* [Devcon](https://devcon.org/en/)\n\nThis list is not guaranteed as several events are still in the planning stages. The PG stewards will continuously assess opportunities to expand the public goods conversation and collaborations.\n\n## Discretionary\n\nThe funds in this initiative are reserved for additional grant opportunities and expenses that arise during the term. Spending on this initiative is at the discretion of the working group stewards.",

      "content": "Authorises metagov to withdraw 30 ETH from the endowment each month for fees, and reimburses metagov for 43.54 ETH in fees already incurred.\n\n\n ## Abstract \nThis proposal outlines a strategic shift allowing the Endowment to autonomously finance its operations. Specifically, it grants the Metagov stewards the authority to withdraw up to 30 ETH monthly from the Endowment, designated for payments to karpatkey and [@steakhouse](https://discuss.ens.domains/u/steakhouse) for their services in managing the Endowment. This initiative provides the stewards with a direct allowance for these expenses, eliminating the need for these costs to be continually factored into their requests for DAO budget allocations.\n\nAdditionally, this proposal seeks to reimburse the [Metagov Safe](https://etherscan.io/address/0x91c32893216dE3eA0a55ABb9851f581d4503d39b) for the payments made to karpatkey and Steakhouse Financial during 2024, covering the service fees for [January](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4ef4b34d397e6ce1fbe1fbe3e94340dcf02d590fc9d93c7107a76282beb201c6) and [February](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xdd631a42ccc3762e285276043926c52b86dedbc70fa34dddd611585a38534a89), which total 43.54 ETH.\n\n# Motivation\n\nSince the initiation of the Endowment through the execution of the [first tranche](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep3-4-executable-fund-the-endowment-first-tranche/16277#specification-3), payments to karpatkey and Steakhouse Financial for their services have been categorised as operational expenditures. These costs were funded through the Metagov Safe, necessitating routine funding requests from the Meta-Governance Working Group to the DAO.\n\nTo simplify and enhance the financial autonomy of the Endowment, we propose granting a monthly allowance of up to 30 ETH to the  Metagov Safe by leveraging the Spending Limits feature available on Safe.\n\nThis measure allows Metagov stewards to settle Endowment fees directly from funds within the Endowment itself, thus eliminating the regular necessity to refill the Metagov Safe. Should the allowance cap be reached, further withdrawals will be paused until the commencement of the next 30-day cycle. This adjustment eradicates the need for frequent funding operations, paving the way for the Endowment's sustained self-sufficiency.\n\nThe monthly cap of 30 ETH has been carefully chosen to align with the Endowment's scale and historical fee structure, ensuring it suffices to cover monthly expenses. Should there be a need to revise this limit to better suit future requirements, adjustments can be facilitated through the submission of a new proposal.\n\nFinally, to ensure the strategic shift is applied retroactively from the outset of 2024, this proposal requests that the Endowment reimburse the Metagov Safe for expenses incurred through payments to karpatkey and Steakhouse Financial. This reimbursement, aimed at covering the service fees for January and February 2024, amounts to a total of 43.54 ETH.\n\n\n ## Specification \nThe following payload will be executed by the DAO Wallet to create the mentioned allowance and refund:\n\n\n```\nCalldata:\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\n\nTarget:\n0x4f2083f5fbede34c2714affb3105539775f7fe64\n\nValue:\n0\n```\n\n\n\n```\nCalldata:\n0x6a76120200000000000000000000000091c32893216de3ea0a55abb9851f581d4503d39b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000025c3d2750b08200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000140000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000016000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000041000000000000000000000000fe89cc7abb2c4183683ab71653c4cdc9b02d44b700000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n\nTarget:\n0x4f2083f5fbede34c2714affb3105539775f7fe64\n\nValue:\n0\n```",

      "content": "# Abstract\nThe ENS Public Goods Working Group requests funding of the below to **support operations until the September 2024 funding window**.\n\nThe Public Goods working group funds projects and builders improving the Web3 ecosystems. This funding stream is authorized in [Article III](https://docs.ens.domains/dao/constitution#iii-income-funds-ens-and-other-public-goods) of the ENS DAO Constitution. This funding supports initiatives related to open-source software, tooling, research and any practical implementations that broadly benefit a wide range of users of Ethereum and Web3.  \n\nThis social proposal is submitted to satisfy the requirements set out in Rule 10.1.1 of the Working Group Rules ([EP 1.8](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-1/ep12-working-group-rules)) and further required by [this snapshot proposal in Nov. 2023 modifying steward rules.](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0x26a5c8dec547837495707e70446d1e7cd874a91f75753c602998f6e70083a266) If this proposal is passed, the funding request will be included in a collective executable proposal put forward by all three Working Groups.\n\n# Specification\nThe current balance of the Public Goods multisig contains 147.2k USDC and 33.5 ETH. The working group requests an additional 450.3k USDC and 21.5 ETH from the DAO to accommodate this proposed budget.\n\n## Current Balances (March 2024)\n\n| USDC   | ETH  | ENS |\n| ------ | ---- | ---- |\n| 147.2k | 33.5 | 200 |\n\n*Balance information can be found at [https://enswallets.xyz  \n    ](https://enswallets.xyz/)\n\n## Expected Spend (Through September 2024)\n\n| Initiative          | USDC   | ETH |\n| ------------------- | ------ | --- | \n| Large Grants        | 387.5k | 0   | \n| Small Grants        | 0      | 50  | \n| Bounties            | 45k   | 0   | \n| Events + Hackathons | 115k   | 0   | \n| Discretionary       | 50k    | 5   | \n| Total               | 597.5k | 55  | \n\n*Mult-sig contains 200 ENS that has no planned use. This may be transferred back to the DAO wallet during the term.\n    \n\n---\n\n# Description of Initiatives\n\n## [](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/public-goods-group-budget-h1-2024/18725#large-grants-3)Large Grants\n\nGrants up to 50k USDC with applications accepted on a rolling basis throughout the year-long term. Large Grants will resume in Q2. With five grantees completing milestones from last term, the budget includes remaining payouts yet to be disbursed. We plan to add at least two more grantees during Q2 while piloting new grants management software. In the second half of the year, we will run another full-size round supporting up to 10 grantees at a time with a 200k USD total prize pool. \n\n## [](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/public-goods-group-budget-h1-2024/18725#small-grants-4)Small Grants\n\nMultiple micro-grantsvoted on by the community. Small Grants will resume during the first half of the year shortly after ETHDenver. We have added the amount expected to spend through the end of the year with no increase from last term. This is approximately 12.5 ETH per quarter. With market fluctuations, stewards may right-size and lower the amounts distributed during round\n\n## [](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/public-goods-group-budget-h1-2024/18725#events-and-hackathons-5)Events and Hackathons\n\nThe working group will support Public Goods events and hackathons. Funds have included expenses related to the funding of hackathons, events, and related participation in events (judging, panels, speaking) where necessary.\n\nThe current earmarked events are:\n\n- [ETHGuatemala](https://ethereum.gt/)\n- [EthLatam](https://ethlatam.org/)\n- [ETHGlobal London](https://ethglobal.com/events/london2024)\n- [ETHCanal](https://www.ethcanal.xyz/)\n- [ETHCC](https://ethcc.io/)\n- [ETHGlobal Brussels](https://ethglobal.com/events/brussels)\n- [DAO Tokyo](https://dao-tokyo.xyz/)\n- [ETHGlobal San Francisco](https://ethglobal.com/events/sanfrancisco2024)\n- [ETHGlobal Bangkok](https://ethglobal.com/events/bangkok)\n- [Devcon](https://devcon.org/en/)\n\nThis list is not guaranteed as several events are still in the planning stages.  The PG stewards will continuously assess opportunities to expand the public goods conversation and collaborations.\n\n## [](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/public-goods-group-budget-h1-2024/18725#discretionary-6)Discretionary\n\nThe funds in this initiative are reserved for additional grant opportunities and expenses that arise during the term. Spending on this initiative is at the discretion of the working group stewards.",

This can also include $ENS distributed in order to lower barriers to the governance proposal process.\n\n\n\n**DAO Tooling**: Developing interfaces and dashboards to improve the governance process and increase transparency across the DAO. An example of DAO tooling spend is our current engagement with Agora as they help build out an enhanced DAO proposal flow to streamline the proposal process.\n\n**Discretionary**: Funds distributed at the discretion of stewards towards new initiatives + governance experiments. In this cycle, we've consolidated the former DAO Sponsorship category into this discretionary category.\n\n \n## Conclusion\n\nThis funding request will allow the ENS Meta-Governance Working Group to continue its essential work in providing governance oversight, supporting the management and operation of working groups, and ensuring effective treasury management for the DAO. The requested funds will enable us to maintain our ongoing initiatives and develop new tools to enhance the governance process. We are grateful for the community's ongoing support and engagement, which is crucial to the success of the ENS DAO. The Meta-Governance Working Group remains committed to serving the ENS community and driving the long-term growth and sustainability of the ecosystem.",

      "title": "[EP5.2] [Social] Determine ENS Labs’ next steps in eth.link litigation",
      "content": "# Abstract\n\nSince 2017, ENS Labs has been operating eth.link as a public gateway for the Ethereum community, providing access to ENS+IPFS sites. Eth.link has been used by some of the largest projects in the space, including Uniswap.\n\nEth.link was kindly delegated to ENS Labs for this purpose by its owner, Virgil Griffith. In August 2022, a dispute arose between ENS Labs, Dynadot, GoDaddy, and Manifold Finance about ownership of eth.link after the transfer and auction of the domain without ENS’ consent. The highest bidder for eth.link at the auction was Manifold Finance, who expressed their intention to [operate the service themselves](https://twitter.com/foldfinance/status/1566200320375476225). A full recitation of the facts surrounding the dispute can be found within [the complaint that ENS Labs filed](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1951CeiKQZ4jQvcpjKU53BnugVedIf8go/view?usp=sharing) in September 2022.\n\nBefore the domain could be transferred, ENS Labs and Virgil successfully obtained a preliminary injunction from a federal district court judge in Phoenix, Arizona. The Court ordered that Dynadot had to immediately return eth.link to ENS Labs. Since then, this litigation has been proceeding slowly through the courts. ENS Labs had to enforce the preliminary injunction as to Dynadot and Manifold Finance exited the lawsuit on jurisdictional grounds. Settlement discussions between the parties indicated that Manifold Finance should be included in any global settlement because of its potential claims to eth.link and against Dynadot.\n\nRecently, Manifold Finance has extended a settlement offer. They are demanding $300,000, along with confidentiality and non-disparagement clauses. In return, they are offering an allparties settlement, which would result in the dismissal of the case and ENS Labs retaining the eth.link domain name.\n\nENS Labs believes that this is the appropriate juncture to solicit the DAO’s input on how to proceed with the litigation. We are thus asking the DAO to instruct ENS Labs on the next steps to take in this case, whether that be agreeing to the settlement, offering a compromise amount, continuing the lawsuit, or dismissing the matter altogether, which would relinquish ENS Labs’ possession of eth.link. Thus far, ENS Labs has been funding this litigation from its own finances. Our expenses so far amount to approximately $750,000. Continuing the case is likely to incur substantial additional costs.\n\nFurther, given the criticality of eth.link to the ENS ecosystem, we would like to request reimbursement from the DAO for the legal fees incurred in protecting possession of eth.link.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis will be an approval vote, with four independent items:\n\n1. Do you approve the proposed settlement?\n2. Do you approve of offering a compromise amount?\n3. Do you approve of continuing the litigation?\n4. Do you approve reimbursing ENS labs for its legal expenses involved in pursuing this case?\n\nYou should vote on each outcome you would be happy with. For example, if you would be happy with either continuation or a compromise settlement, but not the full amount, you would vote for options 2, 3 and 4. If you prefer that the case be dismissed, vote only for option 4, or for no options.\n\nIf the reimbursement is not approved, or none of the options receive a majority (50%) of approving votes, ENS Labs will:\n\n* Promptly post an interstitial on eth.link, warning users of the potential change in ownership and functionality of the domain, and offering alternatives including eth.limo.\n* Dismiss the litigation without delay and without unnecessary further expenditure of funds.\n\nBased on the outcome of the vote, ENS Labs will proceed with the case based on whichever of the courses of action (settlement or continuation) receives the higher proportion of approving votes. Subsequently, ENS Labs will post an executable proposal seeking reimbursement from the DAO for its legal expenses pursuing the case.",

      "content": "This EP will initiate the Streams for Service Providers as selected on EP4.9\n[Draft Discourse link](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep5-2-executable-commence-streams-for-service-providers-first-draft/18615?u=avsa)\n\n\n ## Abstract \nEP 4.7 proposed the concept of Streams for service providers and set its budget at $3.6M per annum. EP4.9 selected the following Service providers and their annual budget:\n\n|Service Provider Name| Annual Stream |\n|---|---|\n|ETH.LIMO|$500,000.00|\n|NameHash Labs|$600,000.00|\n|Resolverworks.eth|$700,000.00|\n|Blockful|$300,000.00|\n|Unruggable|$400,000.00|\n|Wildcard Labs|$200,000.00|\n|Ethereum Follow Protocol|$500,000.00|\n|Namespace|$200,000.00|\n|UNICORN.ETH|$200,000.00|\n\nThe Metagov Working Group has decided this will be implemented in the following manner:\n\n1. Superfluid has been selected as the stream platform (details of which can be found on [this RFP](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/rfp-stream-platform-for-ens-service-providers/18448))\n2. A new wallet, the \"[Stream Management Pod](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=eth:0xB162Bf7A7fD64eF32b787719335d06B2780e31D1)\" has been created as a Global.Safe (Gnosis Safe) wallet. It requires 3 out of 5 signatures to execute any transaction. Its members are the 3 Metagov Stewards, the secretary and the DAO Governor contract.\n3. **This EP includes 5 Executable Transactions**, as follow😘*\n   1. **APPROVE** Superfluid contracts to wrap one month worth of USDC streaming (300,000 USDC);\n   2. **WRAP** one month worth of USDC streaming (300,000 USDC to USDCx);\n   3. **START A STREAM** to the Stream Management Pod of 0.114155251141552512 USDC per second [1];\n   1. **APPROVE** AutoWrap [2] contract to wrap an additional 5.1M USDC (this, added to the already wrapped 300k, should be enough to cover 18 months of the stream, after that a new EP will be required to keep the stream running);\n   1. **ENABLE AUTO-WRAP** to keep wrapping USDC to USDCx on a monthly basis (lower limit 200,000, upper limit 500,000).\n4. Meanwhile the Stewards are reaching out to all representatives of the stream providers. Alex Urbelis, the general Counsel for ENS Labs, has drafted a service provider agreement and is acquiring the services of Urbelis to run a basic KYC and Sanctions protection. All Service Providers will be required to go through this process before receiving their first stream.\n5. On February 1st Stream Management Pod will start  creating individual streams to the Organizations who have completed the steps outlined in bullet #4. Because of Superfluid unique no-upfront-capital-lockup streams, it means that when all of 9 Service Providers Streams start, the Stream Management Pod will be forwarding 100% of the money it  receives directly into the Service Providers. [3]\n\n### Notes\n\n[1]: USDC has a precision of 6 decimal places, but SuperUSDC has a precision of 18 decimals. The value of 0.114155251141552512 per second corresponds to approximately 9863.01 USDC per day and in 3,600,000.000000000018432 USDC per year in a non-leap year. In leap years (such as the current one) it will mean an extra $9.8K is paid in the 29th of February. \n\n[2]: [Autowrapper](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1D65c6d3AD39d454Ea8F682c49aE7744706eA96d#code) is a [series](https://etherscan.io/address/0x30aE282CF477E2eF28B14d0125aCEAd57Fe1d7a1#code) of [contracts](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1D65c6d3AD39d454Ea8F682c49aE7744706eA96d#code) developed by superfluid. When pinged (and anyone would be able to ping it), if the amount of tokens that the DAO has wrapped is below the lower limit, it will automatically wrap new tokens in order to keep the stream running. The goal is to reduce smart contract risk. If Superfluid is somehow hacked, ENS will not lose more than the upper limit set here (about 50 days worth of funds). If both Superfluid AND the autowrapper are hacked at the same time, ENS cannot lose more than the maximun USDC allowance (18 months worth of funds).\n\n[3]: Any capital that remains in the pod (due to the difference between the day this EP is executed and the day the last Service Provider stream is active) will be still considered under the DAO's ownership and will be used only as a buffer (if autowrapper fails, we will have some weeks to resolve it without interrupting payments) and to solve any logistical issues with service providers. It will NOT count towards Metagov's budget nor it will it be used to any other purpose than the service provider management.\n\n\n\n\n ## Specification \nWe will now details the transactions to be executed on this EP:\n\n\n| Operation | Target | Decoded Calldata | Raw Calldata |\n|---|---|---|--|\n| approve USDCx SuperToken contract to transfer 300k USDC | 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 (USDC)  |``function approve(address 0x1BA8603DA702602A8657980e825A6DAa03Dee93a, uint256 300000000000)`` | 0x095ea7b30000000000000000000000001ba8603da702602a8657980e825a6daa03dee93a00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000045d964b800 |\n| wrap 300k USDC to USDCX |  0x1BA8603DA702602A8657980e825A6DAa03Dee93a (Super-USDC) | `function upgrade(uint256 300000000000000000000000)` | 0x45977d03000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003f870857a3e0e3800000 |\n| start flow to Safe with the flowrate of 0.1141... per second | 0xcfA132E353cB4E398080B9700609bb008eceB125 (Superfluid)  |``function setFlowrate(address 0x1BA8603DA702602A8657980e825A6DAa03Dee93a, address 0xB162Bf7A7fD64eF32b787719335d06B2780e31D1, int96 114155251141552512) `` | 0x57e6aa360000000000000000000000001ba8603da702602a8657980e825a6daa03dee93a000000000000000000000000b162bf7a7fd64ef32b787719335d06b2780e31d100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001958f989989a980 |\n| approve auto-wrap for 5.1M |  0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 (USDC) |  ``function approve(address 0x1D65c6d3AD39d454Ea8F682c49aE7744706eA96d, uint256 5100000000000`` |``0x095ea7b30000000000000000000000001d65c6d3ad39d454ea8f682c49ae7744706ea96d000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004a36fb03800`` |\n| create auto-wrap schedule | 0x30aE282CF477E2eF28B14d0125aCEAd57Fe1d7a1 (Autowrapper) |  `function createWrapSchedule (address 0x1BA8603DA702602A8657980e825A6DAa03Dee93a, address 0x1D65c6d3AD39d454Ea8F682c49aE7744706eA96d, address 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48, uint64 3000000000, uint64 1814400, uint64 4320000` | `0x5626f9e60000000000000000000000001ba8603da702602a8657980e825a6daa03dee93a0000000000000000000000001d65c6d3ad39d454ea8f682c49ae7744706ea96d000000000000000000000000a0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb4800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000b2d05e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001baf80000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000041eb00` |\n\nAll contracts have verifiable code.

You can also *simulate the transactions yourself* using [this repo](https://github.com/d10r/ens-streams).\n\nThe terms for the createWrapSchedule are the address of the superToken (super-usdc), the address of the Strategy contract, the address of the base token (USDC), the expiry (set to the far future), lowerLimit and upperLimit. These last two are set in seconds and mean that if, when the autowrapper is pinged, the stream has less than 21 days in it's runway, then it will automatically wrap 50 days worth of funds.\n",

      "content": "Deploy a new version of the DNSSEC oracle and DNS registrar that enables ‘gasless DNSSEC’ functionality.\n[Draft Discourse link](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep5-1-executable-upgrade-dnssec-support/18535)\n\n\n ## Abstract \nThe ENS labs team has been working on a new version of the DNSSEC oracle and the DNS registrar that, combined with wildcard resolution (ENSIP 10) and CCIP-Read, allow for ‘gasless DNSSEC’ - enabling the use of DNS names inside ENS with no onchain transactions required. This proposal replaces the existing DNSSEC registrar with the new one.\n\nExisting DNS names will continue to function as before, and names can still be imported using the ‘legacy’ method. The new registrar also allows configuring a name by setting a TXT record on _ens.name.tld, containing the address of a special resolver contract to use, followed by any resolver-specific data. Resolvers designed for the purpose can be configured to parse this extra data, making configuration entirely offchain a possibility.\n\nAlongside the new registrar and oracle contracts, a simple resolver is provided that reads the Ethereum address to resolve a name to from the extra data.\n\nPost-execution, ENS Labs will run a process to upgrade all current DNS TLDs to use the new registrar. TLDs will only function with the new registrar once this (permissionless) transaction is sent for the TLD.\n\n\n\n ## Specification \nCall `setController` on the Root contract at `root.ens.eth`, passing in the address of the new DNS registrar (`0xb32cb5677a7c971689228ec835800432b339ba2b`).",

      "title": "[EP4.10] [Social] Proposal: Transfer ENS Root Key Ownership to the ENS DAO",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThe ENS DAO has established itself as the key governance entity for the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and has demonstrated capability and responsibility in ownership of several aspects of the protocol. We now propose the further decentralization of the ENS governance structure by transferring ownership of the ENS root key from the current multisig system (multisig.ens.eth) to the ENS DAO (wallet.ensdao.eth).\n\n## Background\n\n### ENS Root Key\n\nThe ENS root node is currently owned by a multisig contract. The root key can control the allocation and replacement of all TLDs except for .eth. Keyholders are well-respected individuals in the Ethereum community and, with the exception of Nick Johnson, founder of ENS, are unaffiliated with ENS. While the .eth registrar contract control has been locked and cannot be affected by the root keyholders, they still hold significant powers over the structure and functioning of the ENS Protocol.\n\n### ENS DAO Current Powers\n\nThe ENS DAO holds ownership of the .eth registrar and has control over functionalities like the NameWrapper. The DAO does not have control over the core ENS root name, which retains the capability to create new TLDs, adjust controls for existing ones, and upgrade the contracts responsible for reverse resolution.\n\n## Proposal\n\n1. **Transfer of Root Key Ownership**: We propose the transfer of ownership of the ENS root key from the current multisig holders to the ENS DAO. This will consolidate governance powers and further the vision of decentralized control over the ENS Protocol.\n3. **TLD Management**: While .eth is permanently set and unchangeable, the DAO will inherit the power to create and manage other top-level domains (TLD). The DAO will also have the ability to lock any TLD permanently if deemed necessary.\n4. **Reverse Resolutions and L2s**: The DAO will have the capacity to update reverse resolutions. Additionally, with the Labs team's support, the DAO will explore and potentially implement primary domain names on Layer 2 solutions (L2s).\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Current ENS root keyholders are requested to execute a transaction transferring root key ownership to the ENS DAO's designated contract.\n2. The ENS DAO commits to managing the new powers and funds in line with the [ENS DAO Constitution](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/ens-dao-constitution#), ensuring transparent governance and decision-making.\n3. The DAO will develop policies to govern TLD management, (oracle) pricing updates, and other key decisions.\n\n\n\n## Coda (Conclusion)\n\nWith this proposal, we aim to further decentralize the control and governance of the ENS Protocol, placing more trust and power in the hands of the ENS community via the DAO. Community discussion will ensue on the [Governance Forum](https://discuss.ens.domains). The ballot will begin on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth) and, should it be passed, the current ENS root keyholders will initiate a transfer of the ENS root key to the ENS DAO where it will be managed according to the precepts outlined herein.",

      "title": "[EP4.9][Social] Select providers for EP4.7 streams",
      "content": "## Abstract \nFollowing the approval of [EP4.7](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-4/ep4.7-create-service-provider-streams) by the DAO, prospective service providers have submitted applications to be considered by the DAO for funding. This proposal collects successful applications for a vote by the DAO.\n\n ## Specification \nEP4.7 provides for a budget of $3,600,000 USDC to be provided annually to qualifying service providers. All successful applications are summarized below in [random order](https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson/status/1731660224031793376).\n\nThe purpose of this vote is to select service providers to receive streaming funding from the DAO. Per the [draft rules](https://github.com/alexvansande/governance-docs/blob/Streams-rules/service-provider-rules.md), selection of winning proposals uses the following process:\n\n1. **Order Proposals**\n   - Arrange all proposals in descending order based on the number of votes received.\n\n2. **Evaluate Proposals Sequentially**\n   - **Vote Threshold Check**\n     - If a proposal has received fewer than 1 million votes, stop the evaluation process immediately.\n   - **Comparison with 'None of the Above'**\n     - If a proposal has fewer votes than the 'None of the Above' option, stop the evaluation process.\n   - **Budget Check**\n     - If a proposal’s requested budget exceeds the remaining budget, skip it and move to the next proposal.\n   - **Selection**\n     - If a proposal passes the above checks, add it to the set of selected proposals. Deduct its requested budget from the remaining budget.\n\n## Post-Selection Procedure\n- If at least one service provider is chosen, the Meta-Governance working group will post an executable vote to implement the funding streams by January 10 at the latest.\n\n# Instructions\n\n**Vote FOR** on any service providers whom you believe that are capable of continuous evolution and enhancement of the ENS system and for which you believe offer a good cost benefit. **Do NOT vote** to any provider you do not believe to be capable of such, for which you believe the proposed projects are out of scope or for which you believe the ask is too high for the proposals. *Only vote \"None of the Above\" if you want to express your disapproval with the whole system and would rather **not have ANY** of the projects be selected.* \n\n# Candidates:\n\n##

      "title": "[EP4.9][Social] Select providers for EP4.7 streams",
      "content": "## Abstract \nFollowing the approval of [EP4.7](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-4/ep4.7-create-service-provider-streams) by the DAO, prospective service providers have submitted applications to be considered by the DAO for funding. This proposal collects successful applications for a vote by the DAO.\n\n ## Specification \nEP4.7 provides for a budget of $3,600,000 USDC to be provided annually to qualifying service providers. All successful applications are summarized below in [random order](https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson/status/1731660224031793376).\n\nThe purpose of this vote is to select service providers to receive streaming funding from the DAO. Per the [draft rules](https://github.com/alexvansande/governance-docs/blob/Streams-rules/service-provider-rules.md), selection of winning proposals uses the following process:\n\n1. **Order Proposals**\n   - Arrange all proposals in descending order based on the number of votes received.\n\n2. **Evaluate Proposals Sequentially**\n   - **Vote Threshold Check**\n     - If a proposal has received fewer than 1 million votes, stop the evaluation process immediately.\n   - **Comparison with 'None of the Above'**\n     - If a proposal has fewer votes than the 'None of the Above' option, stop the evaluation process.\n   - **Budget Check**\n     - If a proposal’s requested budget exceeds the remaining budget, skip it and move to the next proposal.\n   - **Selection**\n     - If a proposal passes the above checks, add it to the set of selected proposals. Deduct its requested budget from the remaining budget.\n\n## Post-Selection Procedure\n- If at least one service provider is chosen, the Meta-Governance working group will post an executable vote to implement the funding streams by January 10 at the latest.\n\n# Instructions\n\n**Vote FOR** on any service providers whom you believe that are capable of continuous evolution and enhancement of the ENS system and for which you believe offer a good cost benefit. **Do NOT vote** to any provider you do not believe to be capable of such, for which you believe the proposed projects are out of scope or for which you believe the ask is too high for the proposals. *Only vote \"None of the Above\" if you want to express your disapproval with the whole system and would rather **not have ANY** of the projects be selected.* \n\n# Candidates:\n\n##

      "content": "# [EP4.9][Social] Select providers for EP4.7 streams\n\nThe vote to select stream providers.\n[Draft Discourse link](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep4-9-social-select-providers-for-ep4-7-streams/18309)\n\n\n ## Abstract \nFollowing the approval of [EP4.7](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-4/ep4.7-create-service-provider-streams) by the DAO, prospective service providers have submitted applications to be considered by the DAO for funding. This proposal collects successful applications for a vote by the DAO.\n\n\n\n ## Specification \nEP4.7 provides for a budget of $3,600,000 USDC to be provided annually to qualifying service providers. All successful applications are summarized below in [random order](https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson/status/1731660224031793376).\n\nThe purpose of this vote is to select service providers to receive streaming funding from the DAO. Per the [draft rules](https://github.com/alexvansande/governance-docs/blob/Streams-rules/service-provider-rules.md), selection of winning proposals uses the following process:\n\n1. **Order Proposals**\n   - Arrange all proposals in descending order based on the number of votes received.\n\n2. **Evaluate Proposals Sequentially**\n   - **Vote Threshold Check**\n     - If a proposal has received fewer than 1 million votes, stop the evaluation process immediately.\n   - **Comparison with 'None of the Above'**\n     - If a proposal has fewer votes than the 'None of the Above' option, stop the evaluation process.\n   - **Budget Check**\n     - If a proposal’s requested budget exceeds the remaining budget, skip it and move to the next proposal.\n   - **Selection**\n     - If a proposal passes the above checks, add it to the set of selected proposals. Deduct its requested budget from the remaining budget.\n\n## Post-Selection Procedure\n- If at least one service provider is chosen, the Meta-Governance working group will post an executable vote to implement the funding streams by January 10 at the latest.\n\n# Instructions\n\n**Vote FOR** on any service providers whom you believe that are capable of continuous evolution and enhancement of the ENS system and for which you believe offer a good cost benefit. **Do NOT vote** to any provider you do not believe to be capable of such, for which you believe the proposed projects are out of scope or for which you believe the ask is too high for the proposals. *Only vote \"None of the Above\" if you want to express your disapproval with the whole system and would rather **not have ANY** of the projects be selected.* \n\nThe full governance rules for stream are listed in the [governance Docs](https://github.com/ensdomains/governance-docs/blob/fbb8eedd3eb27749d7a9dc3c81a0ea134f86d47b/service-provider-rules.md). *(*note, update link when PR is merged)*\n\n# Candidates:\n\n##

      "content": "This proposal introduces new actions and strategies to the Endowment with the aim of enhancing diversification and adapting to current market conditions. Notable additions include ETH-neutral strategies involving Liquid Staking Protocols and established Money Markets.\n[Draft Discourse link](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep-4-5-executable-endowment-permissions-to-karpatkey-update-3/18036)\n\n\n ## Abstract \nFollowing the successful approval of [E.P. 4.2](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/10686228418271748393758532071249002330319730525037728746406757788787068261444),  the second tranche of the Endowment was funded with 16,000 ETH. Community feedback during the E.P. 4.2 voting window indicated a desire to reduce exposure to Lido due to concerns about centralization risks in the network. While diversifying ETH-neutral holdings was already underway, the need for further diversification and divestment from Lido became clear during [community discussions](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/4-2-executable-fund-the-endowment-second-tranche/17743) and the last [Meta-gov call](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/metagov-working-group-weekly-meeting-11am-et-tuesday/15981/43#h-2-endowment-discussion-karpatkey-steakhouse-10) before the vote's closure. Consequently, karpatkey and @steakhouse proposed a 20% cap on Lido's maximum allocation within the ETH-neutral portfolio, set to be achieved by month-end. This proposal's goal is to introduce new strategies for deploying the remaining 80% of the funds as well as other minor maintenance actions.\n\n ## Specification \nPermissions to be added in this proposal:\n\n\n\n1. Deposit ETH on Compound v3;\n2. Deposit ETH or WETH on AAVE v3;\n3. Deposit ETH or WETH on Spark Protocol;\n4. Stake (and unstake) ETH on Stader;\n5. Stake (and unstake) ETH on Ankr;\n6. Removal of CowSwap permissions;\n7. Removal of SushiSwap permissions*;\n8. Addition of an alternative getReward() for Aura pools;\n9. Swaps:\n    1. rETH &lt;> WETH on Balancer;\n    2. rETH &lt;> WETH on Uniswap v3;\n    3. ankrETH &lt;> wstETH on Balancer;\n    4. ETHx &lt;> WETH on Balancer;\n    5. ankrETH &lt;> ETH on Curve;\n    6. ETHx &lt;> WETH on Pancake Swap\n\n**edited on 2023-11-03*\n\n## Auditing Process\n\nWe are releasing an updated version of the [\"Preset Permissions - ENS Endowment''](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ker_TkBJV0xmQ9Li9HB-vtdlpx1vEeVEQwpIH6WoK0o/edit?usp=sharing) document, highlighting all permissions granted to karpatkey, with proposed additions marked in green and revocations in red. We encourage community members with technical expertise to review and provide feedback on the preset update [payload](https://gist.github.com/santinomics/5b43dee4839d74e2c593ac9e7c7d1d3d).\n\nIn the auditing realm, significant progress has been made, with a [new version](https://zodiac-roles-1h9v0miw9-gnosis-guild.vercel.app/gor%3A0x74F819Fa1D95B57a15ECDEf9ce5c779C1bD6cc8A/roles/test-role/diff/4Iq1jdNbLbCBKmLAKciGaDQANiHStkCqFvJJ5KWQc) of the Zodiac Roles Modifier app developed by Gnosis Guild. When fully operational, this app will allow users to input a payload and check the before-and-after status of permissions presets, enhancing the auditing process. \n\nFurthermore, we're actively engaged in collaborative efforts with potential partners to create a user-friendly audit report, enhancing openess for all stakeholders involved in the process. In our commitment to transparency, we're taking an additional step by offering a [self-audit report](https://hackmd.io/@karpatkey/Hy2TyPdfp). This report sheds light on our internal procedures for assessing proposed permissions and changes, providing further insight into our practices.",

These are proposed amendments to section 11 (compensation for stewards)\n\n#### Proposed Addition:\n    10.4. The Meta-Governance working group are responsible for defining standards for fair compensation ('Compensation Guidelines').\n    10.5. The Compensation Guidelines shall be defined prior to the Nomination Window for each term and can only take effect for the following term.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nThe proposed changes intend to make Steward compensation more predictable and transparent, which serves the dual purpose of attracting more talent to the space as well as being fully transparent towards the electors.\n\nThe vote is an **approval voting** meaning you need to vote  to approve or reject each individual change. Changes will only take effect if the vote for approval on each section is higher than the rejection",

In order to address the impact on owners of these invalidated names, refund amounts have been determined based on the following factors:\n\n1. Remaining registration fee or renewal fee\n2. Gas fees paid to register the name\n3. Any premium protocol fee paid to acquire the names\n\nThese factors together have been used to calculate the refund amounts. A total of 2,973 unique addresses will be refunded a total of approximately 115 ETH.\n\nNote: The data is from June 18, 2023 when ENSIP-15 passed. The [distributions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JoLq8obUwFu_xGaXRMslAyX6nwR3njXqIc7I9sizTLU/edit?usp=sharing) and [code](https://github.com/ensdomains/normalise-refund) are both open source.\n\nTo facilitate the transfer of refunds to the affected addresses, this proposal suggests transferring the necessary ETH amount, including gas fees, to the Meta-Governance multisig. The multisig will then execute the refunds on behalf of the ENS DAO and return any leftover gas funds, if applicable.\n",

      "title": "[EP4.2][Executable] Fund the Endowment (second tranche)",
      "content": "# Abstract\n\nThis proposal outlines the allocation of the second tranche, comprising 16,000 ETH, from the [ENS DAO](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfe89cc7abb2c4183683ab71653c4cdc9b02d44b7) to the [ENS Endowment](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4F2083f5fBede34C2714aFfb3105539775f7FE64). Additionally, it introduces minor adjustments to the existing permissions preset for maintenance purposes.\n\n# Motivation\n\nIn March 2023, the ENS Endowment was formally established following the [joint proposal](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/updated-endaoment-proposal-karpatkey-steakhouse-financial/14799) by karpatkey and @steakhouse, after the successful execution of [E.P 3.4 - Fund the Endowment (first tranche)](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/90786656233306599444783442367171420493182391933134906270328139870999449830964). The community had expressed a preference for a phased funding approach, leading to the decision to allocate the funds in two equal tranches over a six-month interval. As we reach this pivotal milestone, this proposal seeks community approval for the second tranche.\n\n## Endowment Update\n\nBased on the most recent monthly report detailing the Endowment’s performance for August 2023, the Endowment has achieved:\n\n* $28.03 M of ncAUM (non-custodial assets under management)\n* 100% of capital utilisation\n* An APY (annual percentage yield) of 4.1%\n* Monthly farming results of $93,841\n\nA comprehensive review [post](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/karpatkey-h1-2023-review-for-the-ens-endowment/17682) detailing our collaborative efforts with the ENS DAO has been recently shared on the forum. We encourage community members to consult this post for insights into our achievements and ongoing initiatives.\n\n### Cumulative Revenues\n\nIn the 182 days since the Endowment was established, 173 ETH have been accrued through ETH-neutral strategies and $136,764 in stablecoin revenues via USD-neutral strategies. Operational reports were initially shared on a [weekly basis](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-weekly-reports/16665) and later transitioned to [monthly updates](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-monthly-reports/17614), all of which were made available on the forum for community review.\n\nThe Endowment's phased initiation should also be taken into account when interpreting these results. Full capital utilisation was only achieved 49 days after the Endowment's inception, following the completion of the earned ETH-to-stablecoin tranche swaps. This staggered approach had a discernible impact on the reported financial metrics.\n\nTaking into consideration the revenue generated during the most recent four months—after reaching 100% capital utilisation—the projected annual revenues at the current Endowment’s size stand at 367 ETH from ETH-neutral strategies and an equivalent of $351,654 in stablecoins from USD-neutral strategies. This results in a projected Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of approximately 3.4%.\n  \n# Specification\n\n## Fund Transfer\n\nTransfer 16,000 ETH to the Endowment (0x4F2083f5fBede34C2714aFfb3105539775f7FE64).\n\n## Permissions preset adjustments\n\nIn line with our commitment to streamline governance and reduce the frequency of voting events for the community, we propose targeted adjustments to the existing permissions preset within this proposal. Specifically, we are requesting three key changes:\n\n* **Whitelisting the updated wstETH-WETH Pool and Gauge**: As part of our ongoing optimization, we propose to whitelist the updated wstETH-WETH pool on [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x93d199263632a4ef4bb438f1feb99e57b4b5f0bd0000000000000000000005c2) and its corresponding gauge on [Aura](https://app.aura.finance/#/1/pool/153).\n* **Revoking Permissions for Aura's bb-a-usd Pool**: In light of the recent [vulnerability](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/vulnerability-found-in-some-pools/5102) disclosed by Balancer on August 24, 2023, we recommend revoking all permissions associated with potentially compromised pools. It's important to note that the Endowment had no exposure to these compromised pools at the time the vulnerability was made public.\n* **Whitelisting the _delegatecall_ function on Cow Swap**: A minor bug was found in the existing preset configuration. Specifically, the _signOrder_ function within Cow Swap's order signer contract is designed to be executed solely via a delegate call, a capability not currently supported by the preset. This oversight not only hindered functionality but also revealed a flaw in the SDK preset testing framework. The issue has been swiftly addressed and rectified in a recent [commit](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-modifier-roles-v1/commit/c22b1fa8c10b1e3cfb2c1fceef24498c25f3ea2d) to the codebase.\n\nAs is customary, we are presenting an updated version of the [\"Preset permissions - ENS Endowment'' document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vhws_fnbIws8EUItK14V2TVIecHdJLxKzN8Za4d5L0M/edit). This document comprehensively lists all permissions granted to karpatkey, with newly requested permissions highlighted in green and any revocations marked in red.\n\nWe are also sharing the [payload](https://gist.github.com/santinomics/bb6b345ff977e7451ff0506e253ebc4c/044f46247ab57f8c65bf608b83eacefa128671f7) to apply the proposed changes for your review. We strongly encourage community members with the required technical expertise to scrutinise the content and share their invaluable feedback.\n\n# Transactions\n\nAll transactions can be found in the following [payload](https://gist.github.com/santinomics/bb6b345ff977e7451ff0506e253ebc4c/044f46247ab57f8c65bf608b83eacefa128671f7).",

      "content": "* [Discussion Thread](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep-4-1-executable-approve-further-actions-and-strategies-for-the-endowment/17406)\n * **Authors**: [Karpatkey](https://twitter.com/karpatkey)\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal introduces additional actions and strategies to the [ENS Endowment](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep3-4-executable-fund-the-endowment-first-tranche/16277?u=alisha.eth), which enhance the Endowment’s performance, adaptability, and diversification.\n\n## Motivation\n\nPermissions granted to Karpatkey to manage the Endowment are not static, and require regular updates to effectively respond to evolving market conditions and to capitalize on emerging opportunities.\n\nAny changes to the permissions related to Endowment funds ([endowment.ensdao.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4F2083f5fBede34C2714aFfb3105539775f7FE64)) must be executed by the DAO. To streamline the process for delegates, Karpatkey has bundled all non-urgent changes in this proposal.\n\n#### Endowment Update\n\nThe latest weekly report shows that the Endowment’s ncAUM (non-custodial Assets Under Management) amount is $30.1M, with a capital utilisation of 99.95% and an APR (Annual Percentage Rate) of 2.78%.\n\nWeekly updates on the Endowment can be found in the ENS governance forum [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-weekly-reports/16665?u=alisha.eth). Monthly updates can be found in the ENS governance forum [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-financial-reporting-by-steakhouse/16601?u=alisha.eth).\n\n## Specification\n\nPermissions that will be added in this proposal are:\n\n1. Deposit USDC on Compound v3;\n2. Deposit DAI on AAVE v3;\n3. Deposit USDC on AAVE v3;\n4. Deposit DAI on Maker's DSR module;\n5. Deposit wstETH - ETH on Balancer;\n6. Stake ETH - stETH on Convex;\n7. Deposit and stake rETH - WETH on Balancer;\n8. Stake rETH - WETH on Aura;\n9. Deposit and stake Compound USDC DAI on Curve;\n10. Stake Compound USDC DAI on Convex;\n11. Deposit and stake Balancer Boosted Aave V3 USD on Balancer;\n12. Stake Balancer Boosted Aave V3 USD on Aura;\n13. Add swap route CVX - WETH on Curve;\n14. Migrate wstETH-WETH position to a new gauge on Aura,\n15. Add swap route processor for SushiSwap's concentrated liquidity (v3) pools, and\n16. Add swapping options on Cow Swap\n\nThe majority of the actions mentioned above were initially presented in the proposal that resulted in the selection of Karpatkey as the Endowment Manager. However, it is important to note that there is one exception, namely action #4 - Deposit DAI on Maker's DSR module. This particular opportunity has emerged as an appealing addition subsequent to the original proposal, presenting a new avenue that was not available at the time of its submission. More details about the new actions are posted below as a comment to this post.\n\nMoving forward, this initial list of actions will be subject to updates based on future market conditions, ensuring the Endowment remains responsive and adaptable.\n\n#### Additional information\n\nWe propose an updated version of the \"Preset permissions - ENS Endowment\" [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ccSDe25I9ojvlbPGT5acqD71LOY9U8xkjBYWJgjJtgI/edit?usp=sharing) that shows all the permissions granted to Karpatkey, including the ones that are being requested now.\n\nThe payload to update the preset that needs to be executed by the ENS DAO upon a successful on-chain vote is posted in the discussion thread along with some additional considerations.\n",

      "content": "## Abstract\nThis is a vote to approve [ENSIP-15: Normalization Standard.](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-15-normalization-standard)\n\n## Motivation\n\n### EP3.7 Motivation\n\n* Normalization isn't enforced on-chain. \n* There is no code for the DAO to execute. \n* Approval for ENSIP-15 should be confirmed through a social vote.\n\n### ENSIP-15 Motivation\n\n* Since [ENSIP-1](./ensip-1-ens.md) (originally [EIP-137](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-137)) was finalized in 2016, Unicode has [evolved](https://unicode.org/history/publicationdates.html) from version 8.0.0 to 15.0.0 and incorporated many new characters, including complex emoji sequences. \n* ENSIP-1 does not state the version of Unicode.\n* ENSIP-1 implies but does not state an explicit flavor of IDNA processing. \n* [UTS-46](https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/) is insufficient to normalize emoji sequences. Correct emoji processing is only possible with [UTS-51](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/).\n* Validation tests are needed to ensure implementation compliance.\n* The success of ENS has encouraged spoofing via the following techniques:\n\t1. Insertion of zero-width characters.\n\t1. Using names which normalize differently between algorithms. \n\t1. Using names which appear differently between applications and devices.\n\t1. Substitution of confusable (look-alike) characters.\n\t1. Mixing incompatible scripts.\n\n## Specification\n \n* Replace [ENSIP-1 § Name Syntax](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-1-ens#name-syntax) \"UTS-46 algorithm\" with link to [ENSIP-15](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-15-normalization-standard).\n* Agree to normalize names according to ENSIP-15 for a safer end-user experience.\n    * Examples:\n       1. ![image](ipfs://bafkreigdy4k2ixby3kr7wbzyvgeautxgxvv5cs7rt7ikmwy6oh6ljdp2dq)\n       1. ![image](ipfs://bafkreic25ukiq5xfymbbkrxlnfwgj4ub47wylqlpmf2ctpxqlzjpvlmv6i)\n       1. ![image](ipfs://bafkreif6qjw6z7liwrcl25fqbyvqtpvr4v2xshpkuk4sxlt5a4cd2x53aq)\n\n\t* Libraries implementing ENSIP-15:\n\t\t1. Javascript — [adraffy/ens-normalize](https://github.com/adraffy/ens-normalize.js)\n\t\t1. Javascript — [ensdomains/eth-ens-namehash](https://github.com/ensdomains/eth-ens-namehash)\n\t\t1. Python — [namehash/ens-normalize-python](https://github.com/namehash/ens-normalize-python)\n\t* Web Frameworks using ENSIP-15:\n\t\t1. Javascript — [ethers/ethers.io](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/)\n\t\t1. Javascript — [web3/web3.js](https://github.com/web3/web3.js)\n\t\t1. Javascript — [wagmi-dev/viem](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/viem)\n* Names visible to the end-user should be [**beautified**](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-15-normalization-standard#annex-beautification) for a more consistent appearance.\n   * For example, these labels are the same:\n![image](ipfs://bafkreihhjtpjmf2oozgwntvfagu7tq6nuhotjwtxupdh6kz5nrfe4kroga)\n\n### Voting \n\nThis vote is a single choice vote. You may vote for one of the following options:\n* **For**\n* **Against**\n* **Abstain**\n\nBy voting **For** this proposal, you are voting in favor of approving [ENSIP-15](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-15-normalization-standard).",

      "title": "[EP3.6] [Social] Election of new ENS Foundation director",
      "content": "## Abstract\nThis is a vote to elect a new director of the ENS Foundation. \n\n## Motivation\nBrantly Millegan has [communicated](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/resignation-from-the-ens-foundation-effective-upon-the-election-of-a-replacement/16676) that he would like to resign as a director of the ENS Foundation. Brantly’s resignation will take effect following the appointment of a new director by the DAO.\n\nThe DAO may appoint a new director of the ENS Foundation pursuant to Article 15 of the Articles of Association of the ENS Foundation.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe DAO will vote to appoint one new director of the ENS Foundation. \n\nTwo candidates are seeking election after successfully completing the requirements outlined in the ['Call for Nominees' post](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/call-for-nominees-ens-foundation-director/16858) on the ENS Governance forum. \n\nThe candidates seeking election are: \n1. Sean Murray\n2. Alex Van de Sande \n\nThe candidate with the highest number of votes above quorum will be appointed as a director of the ENS Foundation following the completion of mandatory KYC checks.\n\n### Voting\nThis vote is a single choice vote. You may vote for one of the following options:\n1. Sean Murray\n2. Alex Van de Sande\n3. None of the above\n4. Abstain\n\nBy voting for a named candidate, you are voting in favor of appointing that candidate as a director of the ENS Foundation. \n\n\n\n## Candidates\n\n### Sean Murray\n**Twitter**: [@financeguy74](https://twitter.com/financeguy74)\n**Are you 18 years of age or older?** Yes\n**Are you a U.S citizen or permanent resident?** Yes\n**Do you live in the U.S or one of its territories?** Yes\n\n**Why should you be appointed as a director of the ENS Foundation?**\nI am capable of fulfilling the required duties but also beyond that I would use it as a platform to increase mainstream ENS adoption.\n\n**How would you handle a request from the SEC for information about the ENS Foundation and/or the $ENS token?**\nThis is an incomplete question because it does not specify who \"you\" is. If an SEC inquiry is addressed only to the Foundation itself, the correct answer is that the Foundation retain counsel and that counsel manage the inquiry. Should the definition of \"you\" be more broad, then any rational person should find my conditions stated below rational, reasonable, and necessary. They should be put in place regardless of who is chosen.\n\n**Is there any other information you would like delegates to know about you or your nomination?**\nYes, if by chance I am selected, my acceptance of the role is conditional on:\n- The DAO authorizing the Foundation to set up D&O insurance;\n- The DAO authorizing the Foundation to compensate directors.\n\n### Alex Van de Sande\n\n**Twitter**: [@avsa](https://twitter.com/avsa)\n**Are you 18 years of age or older?** Yes\n**Are you a U.S citizen or permanent resident?** No\n**Do you live in the U.S or one of its territories?** No\n\n**Why should you be appointed as a director of the ENS Foundation?**\nI won’t lie: I believe this role is purely ceremonial and believe that as long as everything is working as intended, Directors should do nothing but rubberstamp what the DAO approves. But as a symbol, I do think it’s important for the Directors not to be all from ENS Labs, nor for them to be in any jurisdiction that is not welcome to Crypto – and at this moment, the US is such jurisdiction.\n\nSo that’s it, that’s the whole of my pitch: I do not work for ENS labs, I do not respond to them, nor do I am subject to US jurisdiction. I also have been in this space for the last 10 years and you can expect me to be around in the next 10 years.\n\n**How would you handle a request from the SEC for information about the ENS Foundation and/or the $ENS token?**\nI am not not subject to american laws, but that doesn’t mean I intend to break any of them, as I still intend to keep the privilege of landing in US soil. I still believe the US to be a reasonable thriving democracy that is just right now a bit on the wrong side of the pendulum. I also believe that the ENS airdrop was a great precedent on how to do token distribution to the community: no “investor” ever received it in the airdrop, because there were no investors in ENS before the airdrop. All that received them were either involved in the community or the development.\n\nIf I ever received a request from the SEC of any other legal institutions from anywhere I would take the reasonable route: talk to my lawyer, open it with as much as possible with the community and, in an extreme case in which I believed I the requests would hurt ENS and I couldn’t be open to talk about it, I would resign from the foundation.\n\n**Is there any other information you would like delegates to know about you or your nomination?**\nI am not Dutch either, despite a lot of people seemingly believing it so.",

This will reduce the transactions required from 4 to 2 (for adding records + reverse). This will be added as a controller to the NameWrapper, and the NameWrapper will be added as the new controller of the existing .eth Base Registrar.\n\nWe will also replace the current reverse registrar with a new reverse registrar which allows the new controller to set the reverse on registration, as well as adds support for the owner of contract to retrospectively claim their reverse node.\n\n## Specification\n\nNew instances of the Name Wrapper, Reverse Registrar, and .eth registrar controller have been deployed to mainnet at these addresses:\n\n* NameWrapper: `0xD4416b13d2b3a9aBae7AcD5D6C2BbDBE25686401`\n* ReverseRegistrar: `0xa58E81fe9b61B5c3fE2AFD33CF304c454AbFc7Cb`\n* ETHRegistrarController: `0x253553366Da8546fC250F225fe3d25d0C782303b`\n* PublicResolver: `0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63`\n\nThey have been configured, and ownership has been transferred to the DAO.The new Public Resolver is set as the default resolver on the reverse registrar.\n\nThis executable proposal will execute the following calls to complete the contract upgrades:\n\n1. Call `registrar.addController(newNameWrapperAddress)`\n2. Call `ens.setSubnodeOwner(namehash('reverse'), labelhash('addr'), newReverseRegistrarAddress)`\n3. Call `setInterface` on the resolver for .eth with the interface IDs and contract addresses of the new .eth registrar controller and namewrapper. This is used as part of the discovery mechanism by the ENS manager app and others in order to locate the new contracts.",

The [RFP process](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep2-2-4-social-rfp-ens-endowment/14069) (EP2.2.4), on which [karpatkey, together with Steakhouse, made a proposal](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/updated-endaoment-proposal-karpatkey-steakhouse-financial/14799), resulted in the [selection of  karpatkey](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/social-ep2-2-5-selection-of-an-ens-endowment-fund-manager/15188) (EP2.2.5).\n\nFor reference, the proposal submitted by karpatkey was for an initial size of \\$52,000,000 USD (converted to 32,000 ETH for operational purposes as the Endowment will be founded in ETH and to account for the reduction of the pool according to [EP3.3](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep3-3-executable-sell-eth-into-usdc/15906)). The proposal included performance fees of 10% above the investment's reference currency, with $ for $-related investments and ETH for ETH-related investments, as well as an annual fee of 0.5% based on the size of the endowment, payable entirely in ETH on a monthly basis.\n\nKarpatkey engaged in discussions with the ENS community to seek feedback on strategies and the ramp-up process, both [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/social-endowment-initial-conditions-required-steps/15684) and [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-initiation/15952). Feedback was received regarding concerns about the required time to establish trust and the need to limit executive votes for funding. Karpatkey believes that a balanced approach, such as funding 50% on day one and the remaining 50% after six months, would be a suitable tradeoff for all parties. To address questions and concerns raised, a [FAQ](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-frequently-asked-questions-faq/16228) was provided.\n\nIn the meantime, karpatkey made progress on the setup of [the Endowment safe](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4F2083f5fBede34C2714aFfb3105539775f7FE64), which has been seeded to display target positions. The necessary [managing permissions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11xrliJIveXO6C6twYOrnGJ5QUW0Apr1LCcDY8hOfpuo/edit) have been defined and audits from [Ackee](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-modifier-roles/blob/main/packages/evm/docs/ZodiacModifierRolesJanuary2023abch.pdf) and [Sub 7](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-modifier-roles/blob/main/packages/evm/docs/ZodiacModifierRolesJanuary2023sub7.pdf) have been completed. On its part, Steakhouse has started work on providing open source [accounting and financial services](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xS4nXx1G0QCjFS-VdG5yVmVoMa5t1q9_dFZ9N4wGSJ8/edit?usp=sharing), as well as a [monitoring Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/steakhouse/ens-steakhouse), both of which are work in progress.\n\nIf the Endowment is funded through this first tranche, karpatkey will allocate the funds as follows:\n\n|#|Protocol|Assets|Strategy|Share per Strat|Allocated Funds|Share of Portfolio|Proj.

      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis proposal executes a swap of 10,000 ETH into USDC, to ensure ENS DAO has enough to cover operating expenses for 18 - 24 months.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DAO currently keeps almost 100% of its spendable treasury in ETH. While ENS generates protocol revenue in ETH, having so much exposure to a single volatile asset places the DAO in a vulnerable position.\n\nThis is a proposal to convert 10,000 ETH into USDC through a Cowswap swap.\n\n10,000 ETH is approximately 25% of the total amount of ETH held by the ENS DAO (wallet.ensdao.eth) and register controller (controller.ens.eth) as of January 18, 2023.\n\nIt is hoped that this sale will generate in excess of $13m in USDC. The goal is to ensure that the DAO has enough USDC to cover operations for the next 18 - 24 months.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Call `withdraw()` on controller.ens.eth (0x283af0b28c62c092c9727f1ee09c02ca627eb7f5)\n2. Call `deposit()` on WETH9 (0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2), sending 10,000 ETH\n3. Call `approve(<milkman>, 10000 ETH)` on WETH9 (0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2)\n4. Call `requestSwapExactTokensForTokens(10000 ETH, <WETH9>, <USDC>, wallet.ensdao.eth, <uniswap v3 price checker>, <price checker data>)` on milkman (0x11C76AD590ABDFFCD980afEC9ad951B160F02797)\n\n\n\nPrice checker data is configured to check the swap against the Uniswap v3 pool and limit to 2% slippage. It is generated using the below code:\n\n```\nimport { ethers } from \"https://cdn.ethers.io/lib/ethers-5.2.esm.min.js\";\n\nfunction getCheckerData(slippage, path, fees) {\n  return ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(\n    [\"uint256\", \"bytes\"],\n    [\n      slippage,\n      ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(\n        [\"address[]\", \"uint24[]\"],\n        [path, fees],\n      ),\n    ],\n  );\n}\n\nconst checkerData = getCheckerData(\n  200,\n  [\n    \"0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2\",\n    \"0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48\",\n  ],\n  [5],\n);\nconsole.log(\"checkerData:\", checkerData);\n```\n\n**Addresses:**\n\n* 0xfe89cc7abb2c4183683ab71653c4cdc9b02d44b7 - wallet.ensdao.eth\n* 0x283af0b28c62c092c9727f1ee09c02ca627eb7f5 - controller.ens.eth\n* 0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2 - WETH9\n* 0x11C76AD590ABDFFCD980afEC9ad951B160F02797 - milkman\n* 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 - USDC\n* 0x2F965935f93718bB66d53a37a97080785657f0AC - Uniswap v3 slippage checker",

      "content": "# Abstract\nFollowing the RFP process approved in [EP2.2.4](ep2.2.4-social-ens-endaoment-rfp), the Meta-Governance Working Group stewards have selected a short list of potential fund managers for the DAO to elect to manage the ENS Endowment.\n\n# Specification\n[EP2.2.4](ep2.2.4-social-ens-endaoment-rfp) set out a process for fund managers to submit proposals to the Meta-Governance Working Group for consideration as fund managers over an ENS Endowment. The Endowment's goal is to ensure the long-term viability of ENS by ensuring it can meet its ongoing financial obligations even in the face of reduced ETH price and registration/renewal revenue.\n\nEight submissions were made as a result of the RFP process, and the stewards have narrowed this down to three finalists. All three finalists are established actors with track records of fund management, and their proposals reflect an understanding of the low-risk, long-term sustainability approach that an endowment should take.\n\nRather than select a winner themselves, the Meta-Governance Working Group Stewards believe that the selection of a fund manager should be put to the DAO. This EP implements a Snapshot vote using Ranked Choice voting with the following options:\n\n1. Avantgarde\n2. Karpatkey\n3. Llama\n4. None of the above\n\nSubmissions for the vote are listed in alphabetical order.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the vote, the Meta-Governance Stewards will work with the winning team to develop an initial treasury allocation strategy, resulting in a separate executable proposal to enact the initial setup of the endowment.\n\n## Submission Summary\n\nThe table below summarizes the final submissions made by each candidate.\n\n| Submission | Initial Size | Target Size | Performance Fee | Admin Fee | Breakeven Return |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [Avantgarde](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endaoment-proposal-avantgarde/14800?u=nick.eth) | 25,000 ETH | $100,000,000 USD | 12.5% | 0.5% | 0.57% |\n| [Karpatkey](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endaoment-proposal-karpatkey-steakhouse-financial/14799) | $52,000,000 USD | $69,000,000 USD | 10% | 0.5% | 0.56% |\n| [Llama](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/updated-endaoment-proposal-llama-x-alastor/15183) | 30,000 ETH | $80,000,000 USD | 0% | 1% min. $500k USD | 1% - 1.28% |\n\nBreakeven return is calculated as `admin_fee / (1 - performance_fee)`.",

      "content": "This is a vote on EP2.2.4, the ENS Endaoment RFP. This is the first time an RFP has been put to a DAO-wide vote, so a brief explainer is warranted.\n\n---\n\n# What is an RFP?\nRFP stands for Request For Proposals. It's a request by the DAO for interested parties to propose a solution to a problem the DAO has. Anyone can submit a proposal during the submission period, and the RFP manager named in the RFP then decides on the winner during the approval period.\n\n# What is the ENS Endaoment RFP?\nThis is an RFP to find a fund manager who can manage the bulk of ENS's treasury going forward, with a goal of creating a sustainable fund that can pay for ongoing development needs without depending on revenue from registrations and renewals. It's a crucial part of securing the long-term future of the DAO and of ENS, whatever the broader economic conditions.\n\n# What am I being asked to vote on?\nYou're voting to approve the issuance of the RFP. If you vote yes, the RFP will be active, and the RFP manager - in this case the Meta-Governance Working Group stewards - will be empowered to choose a winner from any submissions that were made without a further DAO vote. Their choice will be considered a decision by the DAO as a whole.\n\nFor this specific RFP, there are likely to be subsequent DAO votes required to execute the winning fund manager's strategy onchain, but these will come after the Meta-Governance Working Group stewards have decided on a fund manager.\n\n---\n\n# Overview\n\nThe DAO is seeking a fund manager to manage an endowment fund. This fund will be established from some combination of current treasury and ongoing revenue, and will exist to insulate the DAO from economic fluctuations, ensuring it can continue its core operations regardless of the wider economic outlook.\n\nFunds will be drawn from the DAO's general funds, currently held in ETH and USDC, as well as from ongoing DAO revenue until the fund reaches its target size. Proposals should outline how much of the DAO's current funds the intend to appropriate, as well as what proportion of ongoing revenue will be required, and for how long.\n\nThe DAO's accounting basis divides assets into earned and unearned income. Unearned income corresponds to funds paid for registrations and renewals that are future-dated; for example, if a user spends $100 to register a name for 20 years, after a year $5 of that will be counted as earned income and the remainder as unearned income.\n\nUnearned income may be incorporated into the fund, but must be risk-neutral with regard to ETH. Earned income should be risk-netural with regard to USDC.\n\nThe DAO's current balances can be viewed [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/8785928a-71d5-4b17-9fea-fe1c937b064f); as of this writing they are:\n\n* 13,069 ETH (\\~$20M) in earned income\n* $3,817,067 USDC\n* 18,184 ETH (\\~$20M) in unearned income\n\n# Scope of Work\n\n1. Expand the endowment structure specified in the accepted proposal into an executable form.\n2. Work with the ENS Meta-Governance stewards to refine the proposal.\n3. Implement the proposal onchain.\n4. Administer and adjust the endowment as necessary on an ongoing basis.\n\n# Selection Criteria\n\nThe endowment will need to be able to sustain annual withdrawals of at least $4M USDC without a long-term reduction in principal.\n\nProposals should include, at a minimum:\n\n1. Intended high-level fund allocation of the endowment.\n2. Initial and target size for the endowment fund, including the proportion of funds sourced from earned and unearned income.\n3. How incoming revenues and income will be assigned to the fund.\n4. Specific information on how the fund will be managed, and what steps will be taken to minimise custodial risk.\n5. A fee schedule for the fund manager.\n6. A detailed description of the reporting structures that will be put in place.\n\nPriority will be given to proposals that:\n\n* Minimise custodial risk by using onchain mechanisms that allow administration of the funds without the fund administrator having custody of the funds.\n* Lay out a coherent strategy for how investment returns can be maintained in the short/medium/long term.\n* Minimise capital risks relative to the expected returns.\n* Define clear mechanisms for assessment and adjustment to changing external and internal conditions in order to continue to meet the endowment's objectives.\n* Offer a high rate of return proportional to risk.\n* Define a clear reporting structure for frequent and comprehensive reporting of the fund's status to the DAO.\n\n# Timeline\n\n|                       |                                |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| **Submission Period** | September 15 - October 10 2022 |\n| **Approval Period**   | October 10 - November 7 2022   |\n\n\n\n# RFP Manager\n\nThe Meta-Governance WG stewards are the RFP managers for this RFP.\n\nProposals can be submitted via forum DM to the stewards.

Incubated at the Ethereum Foundation in 2017, TNL spun out in 2018 with the charge of designing and deploying THE next generation naming service. TNL is now a growing team of web3 enthusiasts from across the globe working together to support the ENS Ecosystem that now has a passionate community that has registered over 1 million ENS names and uses more than 500 integrations. \n\nIn 2021, TNL initiated the creation of the ENS DAO with the goal of 1) furthering the development of the ENS Protocol and 2) funding public goods projects.\n\n \nIn consideration of the work completed thus far this calendar year and the work in the months and years to come, per Article III of the ENS Constitution, True Names Ltd respectfully requests an evergreen grant stream that will allow the organization to continue the development and improvement of the ENS Protocol. For Calendar Year 2022, this request will amount to $4,197,500 USDC which is equivalent to a daily stream of $11,500 USDC. In Q1 of each year, TNL or the ENS Dao may make requests to alter and/or terminate this evergreen grant stream.\n\n# Specification\nWe request that the ENS DAO approve a daily grant of $11,500 USDC to True Names Ltd, backdated to January 1st, 2022.\n\nThis will be accomplished by approving a dedicated token streaming contract at `0xB1377e4f32e6746444970823D5506F98f5A04201` to spend USDC on behalf of the DAO.\n",

      "content": "# Abstract\nWe propose that 200k ENS (~3.7% of the [unclaimed airdrop](https://twitter.com/ensdomains/status/1522066354387718144)) be allocated in recognition of past and ongoing work of these core contributors.\n\nENS is one of the most successful projects built on Ethereum, and yet core protocol contributors do not benefit in any way from the success of projects being built on Ethereum. The Protocol Guild provides a vehicle for the ENS community to distribute governance tokens to those individuals who build and maintain the foundational infrastructure that ENS relies on.\n\nENS sponsorship of the Guild allows members to engage with ENS in a way that is values- and incentive-aligned. Simultaneously, it will allow them to continue the important work of scaling our shared infrastructure and making it as resilient as possible for the applications on top of it.\n\n# Specification\n## Useful links\n\n* [Protocol Guild Docs](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)\n* [1 Year Vesting Contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/)\n* [Split Contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0x84af3D5824F0390b9510440B6ABB5CC02BB68ea1/)\n* [Initial Announcement - Dec 2021](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/mEDvFXGCKdDhR-N320KRtsq60Y2OPk8rHcHBCFVryXY)\n* [List of Members](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html)\n* [Protocol Guild twitter](https://twitter.com/ProtocolGuild)\n\n## Context\n\n1. As a credibly neutral, maximally uncapturable infrastructure with no block reward, the Ethereum base protocol doesn’t offer the same token incentives to contributors as applications or L2s can. However, the protocol still needs to attract and retain talent to continue to evolve. As the broader ecosystem continues to grow, competition for talented individuals will only increase. This isn’t to fault individuals for rationally weighting financial incentives, or protocols for leveraging the power of tokens - this is just the reality of the current context. We also acknowledge that financial motivations aren’t the only or best motivator for people, it’s just one tool in our toolset that is currently underleveraged.\n2. Existing public goods funding solutions tend to be either too narrow or broad in scope, fail to exclusively target core protocol contributors, or depend on an intermediating institution, which often leads to organizations, and not individuals, being recipients of funds.\n3. The Protocol benefits from contributor continuity. Transferring institutional knowledge between cohorts is more likely to happen successfully the more overlap there is.\n\nHere’s a longer exploration of the [project rationale](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1-proposal-rationale.html).\n\nIf we believe what we are building is important, then we should structure the incentives to attract more smart people to work on it. After all, “Ethereum is an unprecedented arena for playing cooperative games”; we should try to manifest the novel possibilities made possible by this arena. ([Griffith, 2019](https://medium.com/@virgilgr/ethereum-is-game-changing-technology-literally-d67e01a01cf8))\n\n## What is the Protocol Guild?\n\nThe Protocol Guild aims to address the challenges mentioned above with a simple tool: a weighted split contract that includes vesting. Members will solicit sponsorships in the form of tokens from applications & protocols that build on Ethereum, which gives core contributors exposure to success at the application layer:\n\n* current contributors are rewarded for past work through time-based weighting\n* current contributors contribute for longer periods, resulting in less contributor churn\n* new contributors are incentivized to join core protocol work, protocol evolution and maintenance is more robust\n\nTo date, the membership includes over 110 Ethereum protocol contributors, including researchers, client maintainers, upgrade coordinators, and more, all self-curated (member list [here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html)). This is a broad-based ecosystem effort: members come from 22 different teams and 9 organizations. Only 30% of members are directly employed by the EF. The membership is continuously curated through quarterly updates to the split contract - we expect the membership to grow to 150 over the course of the Pilot.\n\nThe Guild contracts will act as an autonomous value routing mechanism, operated independently from any existing institution, purpose-built for incentivizing long-term core protocol work. At no point does PG take custody of funds on behalf of members, it is all handled trustlessly. The diagram below and the [docs](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3-smart-contract.html) have more information.\n\n![|602x387](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80278162/165815437-11646882-bac0-41bf-9709-e64880c96d82.png)\n\n## 2022 Pilot\n\nSince starting the project in Nov 2021, we’ve built norms around member onboarding , refined the splitting and vesting mechanisms, and created extensive documentation on how PG operates.\n\nAt this point, we’re ready to test the mechanism’s efficacy with a 1 year / $10-20mm Pilot. We want to make sure the mechanism operates smoothly before graduating to a full-scale fundraising round for longer vesting periods. The funds for the Pilot would be vested directly to Guild members over one year: see the [Pilot vesting contract here](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/).\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe are proposing that 200k ENS (~3.7% of the [unclaimed airdrop](https://twitter.com/ensdomains/status/1522066354387718144)) be sent to the [Pilot vesting contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/) deployed at 0xF29…f1a9 in recognition of the past and ongoing work of these core contributors.\n\nThe tokens would not be liquidated, but would vest for one year to each beneficiary listed on the underlying split. Each recipient would be making an independent decision about how to use their tokens once vested.\n\nThe USD value of the 200k ENS is $2.49mm as of the time of this post on May 25 2022. This is roughly in line with what we have already proposed to similarly prominent Ethereum-based protocols. [Lido’s 2mm LDO contribution](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-protocol-guild-pilot-via-a-lido-grant/2016) was worth $2.6mm; the [active Uniswap proposal](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-should-the-uniswap-community-participate-in-the-protocol-guild-pilot/16824) requesting 500k UNI would be worth $2.75mm.\n\nThere are a few reasons why supporting the Protocol Guild benefits the ENS community:\n\n* ENS’s long-term success is tightly coupled with the continued evolution and maintenance of the Ethereum protocol. These are projects that often have multi-year timelines. Contributing to the Pilot meaningfully increases the incentive to contribute to the core protocol, including:\n  * [The Merge](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Merge/mainnet-readiness.md): moving from PoW to PoS, increasing security and sustainability\n  * EVM improvements: new functionality for developers like [EOF](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ipsilon/evm-object-format-overview)\n  * [Statelessness](https://notes.ethereum.org/@gballet/Sy-a6T5St): sustainable management for state growth\n  * Supporting L2 scaling: [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844), [EIP-4488](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488)\n  * [Proposer Builder Separation](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/pbs_censorship_resistance): reducing centralizing incentives for consensus participants\n  * Continuous client maintenance: improving sync, exploring new database types, researching modular clients\n  * Coordinating network upgrades: making sure the community helps to shape and is aware of network upgrades\n* Having exposure to ENS allows protocol contributors to engage more with ENS governance. Members will be encouraged (but not obligated) to delegate them within the ENS governance framework.\n* ENS should be among the protocols maximally aligned with the Public Goods of the largest ecosystem it operates in. Pilot participation maintains and expands the ENS community’s existing reputation for funding Public Goods.\n* Diverse funding sources from the community further decentralizes protocol governance and prevents influence from pooling with any single entity.\n\nWe hope that a successful Pilot will pave the way for future funding collaborations between the ENS community and the Protocol Guild as we scale up the project after the Pilot. To that end, we think it’s important to demonstrate impact: learn more about how we intend to evaluate [Pilot outcomes here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/5-initial-pilot.html). We have also adopted an active stance of continuous adjustments to improve PG while we operate the Pilot: improving documentation, resources for members, better transparency, etc.",

      "title": "[EP14] [Social] Dissolve Community Working Group",
      "content": "This vote proposes to dissolve the Community Working Group at the conclusion of the First Term of 2022.\n\n## Description\n\nThis is a proposal to dissolve the Community Working Group at the conclusion of the First Term of 2022 in accordance with rule 3.1 of the working group rules passed under [EP 4](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/ep4-social-proposal-creation-of-foundational-working-groups-and-working-group-rules). \n\nIf this proposal is passed, the Community Working Group will be dissolved at the conclusion of the First Term of 2022, leaving three remaining working groups within the ENS DAO:\n\n1. Meta-Governance Working Group;\n2. ENS Ecosystem Working Group; and\n3. Public Goods Working Group.\n\nOn the basis that new working groups cannot be formed within the DAO unless it can shown that “… the work cannot be undertaken within an existing working group” (rule 2.2), the same standard should apply for the dissolution of working groups.\n\nAfter consulting with Stewards and Community Working Group participants, regarding their work and experiences during the First Term of 2022, it is clear that:\n\n1. each subgroup within the Community Working Group could comfortably fall within the Ecosystem Working Group; and \n2. the DAO does not have enough active participants to justify having \"community\" as a standalone working group. \n\nTherefore, using the same standard set out in rule 2.2, we should dissolve the Community Working Group and migrate all existing subgroups from that working group to the Ecosystem Working Group or another working group as appropriate. \n\nBy dissolving the Community Working Group, the remaining working groups will have distinct mandates that provide clarity for contributors, without overlap. This will allow stewards to more efficiently facilitate work within the remaining working groups.\n\n#### Please note\nThere is currently an election taking place on Snapshot to elect Community Working Group Stewards for the Second Term. \n\nThis proposal, to dissolve the Community Working Group, has been moved to a vote at this time at the request of current Meta-Governance Working Group Stewards to minimize disruption and ensure that results are available soon after steward elections conclude. \n\nIf this vote passes, incoming Community Working Group Stewards will not be required to serve as Stewards of the Community Working Group in the Second Term, which starts on July 1, 2022. If the vote does not pass, incoming community stewards will take up their positions within the Community Working Group on July 1, 2022. \n\n## Specification\n\nThis is a proposal to:\n\n1. Dissolve the Community Working Group;\n2. Return any unspent funds remaining in the Community Working Group multi-sig, at end of the First Term of 2022, to the ENS DAO treasury; and\n3. Migrate all existing subgroups within the Community Working Group to other working groups within the ENS DAO before the end of the First Term of 2022.\n\nThe ENS DAO will have three working groups for the Second Term of 2022 and all Terms thereafter. These working groups will be:\n\n- Meta-Governance Working Group: provides governance oversight and support of the management and operation of the ENS DAO;\n- ENS Ecosystem Working Group: continues development and improvement of the ENS protocol and ecosystem; and\n- Public Goods Working Group: funds public goods within web3 in accordance with the ENS DAO constitution.\n\n## Voting\n\nThis vote will be a single-choice vote. You may vote \"For\" or \"Against\" this proposal, or chose to abstain from the vote.\n\nBy voting \"For\" this proposal, you are voting in favor of dissolving the Community Working Group at the conclusion of the First Term of 2022, in accordance with the specification set out in this proposal.",

The Protocol Guild provides a vehicle for the ENS community to distribute governance tokens to those individuals who build and maintain the foundational infrastructure that ENS relies on.\n\nENS sponsorship of the Guild allows members to engage with ENS in a way that is values- and incentive-aligned. Simultaneously, it will allow them to continue the important work of scaling our shared infrastructure and making it as resilient as possible for the applications on top of it.\n\n# Specification\n## Useful links\n\n* [Protocol Guild Docs](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)\n* [1 Year Vesting Contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/)\n* [Split Contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0x84af3D5824F0390b9510440B6ABB5CC02BB68ea1/)\n* [Initial Announcement - Dec 2021](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/mEDvFXGCKdDhR-N320KRtsq60Y2OPk8rHcHBCFVryXY)\n* [List of Members](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html)\n* [Protocol Guild twitter](https://twitter.com/ProtocolGuild)\n\n## Context\n\n1. As a credibly neutral, maximally uncapturable infrastructure with no block reward, the Ethereum base protocol doesn’t offer the same token incentives to contributors as applications or L2s can. However, the protocol still needs to attract and retain talent to continue to evolve. As the broader ecosystem continues to grow, competition for talented individuals will only increase. This isn’t to fault individuals for rationally weighting financial incentives, or protocols for leveraging the power of tokens - this is just the reality of the current context. We also acknowledge that financial motivations aren’t the only or best motivator for people, it’s just one tool in our toolset that is currently underleveraged.\n2. Existing public goods funding solutions tend to be either too narrow or broad in scope, fail to exclusively target core protocol contributors, or depend on an intermediating institution, which often leads to organizations, and not individuals, being recipients of funds.\n3. The Protocol benefits from contributor continuity. Transferring institutional knowledge between cohorts is more likely to happen successfully the more overlap there is.\n\nHere’s a longer exploration of the [project rationale](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1-proposal-rationale.html).\n\nIf we believe what we are building is important, then we should structure the incentives to attract more smart people to work on it. After all, “Ethereum is an unprecedented arena for playing cooperative games”; we should try to manifest the novel possibilities made possible by this arena. ([Griffith, 2019](https://medium.com/@virgilgr/ethereum-is-game-changing-technology-literally-d67e01a01cf8))\n\n## What is the Protocol Guild?\n\nThe Protocol Guild aims to address the challenges mentioned above with a simple tool: a weighted split contract that includes vesting. Members will solicit sponsorships in the form of tokens from applications & protocols that build on Ethereum, which gives core contributors exposure to success at the application layer:\n\n* current contributors are rewarded for past work through time-based weighting\n* current contributors contribute for longer periods, resulting in less contributor churn\n* new contributors are incentivized to join core protocol work, protocol evolution and maintenance is more robust\n\nTo date, the membership includes over 110 Ethereum protocol contributors, including researchers, client maintainers, upgrade coordinators, and more, all self-curated (member list [here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html)). This is a broad-based ecosystem effort: members come from 22 different teams and 9 organizations. Only 30% of members are directly employed by the EF. The membership is continuously curated through quarterly updates to the split contract - we expect the membership to grow to 150 over the course of the Pilot.\n\nThe Guild contracts will act as an autonomous value routing mechanism, operated independently from any existing institution, purpose-built for incentivizing long-term core protocol work. At no point does PG take custody of funds on behalf of members, it is all handled trustlessly. The diagram below and the [docs](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3-smart-contract.html) have more information.\n\n![|602x387](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80278162/165815437-11646882-bac0-41bf-9709-e64880c96d82.png)\n\n## 2022 Pilot\n\nSince starting the project in Nov 2021, we’ve built norms around member onboarding , refined the splitting and vesting mechanisms, and created extensive documentation on how PG operates.\n\nAt this point, we’re ready to test the mechanism’s efficacy with a 1 year / $10-20mm Pilot. We want to make sure the mechanism operates smoothly before graduating to a full-scale fundraising round for longer vesting periods. The funds for the Pilot would be vested directly to Guild members over one year: see the [Pilot vesting contract here](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/).\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe are proposing that 200k ENS (~3.7% of the [unclaimed airdrop](https://twitter.com/ensdomains/status/1522066354387718144)) be sent to the [Pilot vesting contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/) deployed at 0xF29…f1a9 in recognition of the past and ongoing work of these core contributors.\n\nThe tokens would not be liquidated, but would vest for one year to each beneficiary listed on the underlying split. Each recipient would be making an independent decision about how to use their tokens once vested.\n\nThe USD value of the 200k ENS is $2.49mm as of the time of this post on May 25 2022. This is roughly in line with what we have already proposed to similarly prominent Ethereum-based protocols. [Lido’s 2mm LDO contribution](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-protocol-guild-pilot-via-a-lido-grant/2016) was worth $2.6mm; the [active Uniswap proposal](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-should-the-uniswap-community-participate-in-the-protocol-guild-pilot/16824) requesting 500k UNI would be worth $2.75mm.\n\nThere are a few reasons why supporting the Protocol Guild benefits the ENS community:\n\n* ENS’s long-term success is tightly coupled with the continued evolution and maintenance of the Ethereum protocol. These are projects that often have multi-year timelines. Contributing to the Pilot meaningfully increases the incentive to contribute to the core protocol, including:\n  * [The Merge](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Merge/mainnet-readiness.md): moving from PoW to PoS, increasing security and sustainability\n  * EVM improvements: new functionality for developers like [EOF](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ipsilon/evm-object-format-overview)\n  * [Statelessness](https://notes.ethereum.org/@gballet/Sy-a6T5St): sustainable management for state growth\n  * Supporting L2 scaling: [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844), [EIP-4488](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488)\n  * [Proposer Builder Separation](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/pbs_censorship_resistance): reducing centralizing incentives for consensus participants\n  * Continuous client maintenance: improving sync, exploring new database types, researching modular clients\n  * Coordinating network upgrades: making sure the community helps to shape and is aware of network upgrades\n* Having exposure to ENS allows protocol contributors to engage more with ENS governance. Members will be encouraged (but not obligated) to delegate them within the ENS governance framework.\n* ENS should be among the protocols maximally aligned with the Public Goods of the largest ecosystem it operates in. Pilot participation maintains and expands the ENS community’s existing reputation for funding Public Goods.\n* Diverse funding sources from the community further decentralizes protocol governance and prevents influence from pooling with any single entity.\n\nWe hope that a successful Pilot will pave the way for future funding collaborations between the ENS community and the Protocol Guild as we scale up the project after the Pilot. To that end, we think it’s important to demonstrate impact: learn more about how we intend to evaluate [Pilot outcomes here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/5-initial-pilot.html). We have also adopted an active stance of continuous adjustments to improve PG while we operate the Pilot: improving documentation, resources for members, better transparency, etc.\n\n# Transactions\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Address</th>\n        <th>Value</th>\n        <th>Function</th>\n        <th>Argument</th>\n        <th>Value</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td rowspan=2>token.ensdao.eth</td>\n        <td rowspan=2>0</td>\n        <td rowspan=2>transfer</td>\n        <td>recipient</td>\n        <td>theprotocolguild.eth</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>amount</td>\n        <td>200000000000000000000000</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>",

      "title": "[EP12][Social] Working Group Rules",
      "content": "## Description\n\nProposes to repeal the working group rules passed in [EP4](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/ep4-social-proposal-creation-of-foundational-working-groups-and-working-group-rules) and replace those rules with the working group rules specified in this proposal.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis is a proposal to repeal the working group rules passed in EP4 and replace  those rules with working group rules specified in this proposal for the Second Term of 2022 and all Terms thereafter. \n\nThe working group rules specified in this proposal add more details about Steward responsibilities and the management of working group funds, as well as introducing the requirement of each working group to appoint a lead steward. \n\nThe specification below also introduces a rule to appoint a new DAO Secretary, responsible for managing working relationships and communications across working groups as well as performing administrative duties for the DAO.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Working Groups Rules\n\n1. Formation of Working Groups\n    1. To create a new working group, a social proposal, as defined by the ENS governance documentation (‘Social Proposal’), must be put forward and passed by the DAO.\n    2. A Social Proposal to create a new working group must demonstrate that the new working group is needed and the work cannot be undertaken within an existing working group.\n\n2. Dissolution of Working Groups\n    1. A working group can be dissolved by passing a Social Proposal requesting the dissolution of a working group or working groups.\n    2. If an active proposal is put forward to dissolve a working group, all working group funds, including outgoing payments, within that working group, are to be frozen with immediate effect, pending the outcome of that vote.\n    3. Upon the dissolution of a working group, any and all unspent working group funds from that working group, at the time of dissolution, must be immediately returned to the DAO treasury, without delay.\n\n3. Working Group Stewards\n    1. Each working group shall be managed by three stewards (hereafter a ‘Steward’ or ‘Stewards’).\n    2. Stewards will be elected to serve within working groups for a set period of time (hereafter known as a ‘Term’ or ‘Terms’).\n    3. There are two Terms each calendar year:\n        1. The first Term commences at 9am UTC on January 1 each year and ends immediately prior to the commencement of the second Term (‘First Term’); and\n        2. The second Term commences at 9am UTC on July 1 each year and ends immediately prior to the commencement of the First Term of the following year (‘Second Term’).\n    4. Stewards are responsible for overseeing the operation of working groups in accordance with these rules and the ENS DAO constitution.\n    5. The responsibilities of Stewards include, but are not limited to:\n        1. Requesting working group funds from the DAO in accordance with these rules;\n        2. Approving the creation of sub-groups or workstreams within a working group to undertake work and/or carry out specific projects or tasks; \n        3. Dissolving sub-groups or workstreams within a working group;\n        4. Using discretion to make working group funds available to sub-groups, workstreams, or contributors within a working group; \n        5. Using discretion to disburse working group funds to people and/or projects in accordance with the ENS DAO constitution; and\n        6. Acting as keyholders of working group multi-sigs. \n\n4. Steward Eligibility and Nominations\n    1. Any individual is eligible to nominate themselves to be a Steward of a working group within the DAO (‘Eligible Person’ or ‘Eligible Persons’).\n    2. To be eligible to be included in the ballot for First Term elections of a given year, Eligible Persons must nominate themselves between 9am UTC on December 6 and 9am UTC on December 9 (‘First Term Nomination Window’).\n    3. To be eligible to be included in the ballot for Second Term elections of a given year, Eligible Persons must nominate themselves between 9am UTC on June 6 and 9am UTC on June 9 (‘Second Term Nomination Window’).\n    4. An Eligible Person may nominate themselves to become a Steward of a working group or working groups during the First Term Nomination Window or the Second Term Nomination Window (each a ‘Nomination Window’), by meeting the requirements set out in a call for nominations posted in the relevant working group category of the ENS governance forum.\n    5. An Eligible Person who completes the steps outlined in rule 4.4 above during a Nomination Window and receives 10,000 signed votes to support their nomination will be included in the ballot as a nominee in the election for Stewards that takes place following that Nomination Window (‘Nominee’).\n\n5. Steward Elections\n    1. Elections for working group Stewards for the First Term of a given year will take place by a vote of governance token holders using signed messages and will be open for 120 hours, commencing at 9am UTC on December 10 each year (‘First Term Election Window’).\n    2. Elections for working group Stewards for the Second Term of a given year will take place by a vote of governance token holders using signed messages and will be open for 120 hours, commencing at 9am UTC on June 10 each year (‘Second Term Election Window’).\n    3. The top-ranked Nominees from each working group vote held during a First Term Election Window or a Second Term Election Window (each an 'Election Window'), will fill any available positions for the role of Steward for those working groups for the Term immediately following an Election Window, based on the order in which they are ranked in each working group vote.\n    4. A Nominee elected to serve as a Steward may not take up the role of Steward for more than two working groups during a single Term.\n\n6. Delay of Nominations or Elections\n    1. In the event that nominations or elections for Stewards take place after a Nomination Window or after an Election Window, the nomination process and/or elections shall take place, as otherwise prescribed in rules 4 and 5 above, as soon as is practicable after the missed Nomination Window or missed Election Window.\n    2. In the event that an election takes place outside of an Election Window and after the commencement date of a new Term, outgoing Stewards from the previous Term shall stay in their positions as working group Stewards until immediately prior to 9am UTC the day following the end of the election, which, for the avoidance of doubt, is 120 hours after voting in those elections commenced.\n    3. In the event that an election takes place outside of an Election Window and after the commencement date of a new Term, newly elected Stewards will assume the responsibilities of stewardship within working groups at 9am UTC the day following the end of the election, as defined in rule 6.2 above, for the remainder of that Term.\n\n7. Removal and Replacement of Stewards\n    1. Stewards may be removed at any time by:\n        1. a Social Proposal passed by the DAO; or\n        2. a simple indicative majority vote among Stewards of all working groups, with the outcome of that vote communicated in the relevant working group category of the ENS governance forum.\n    2. Stewards may step down from their position at any time by communicating their intention to step down in the ENS governance forum.\n    3. In the event that a Steward is removed, steps down, or is unable to continue as a Steward, for whatever reason, prior to the end of a Term, a new election must be held to fill any vacant Steward positions, in accordance with rule 6 above.\n\n8. Lead Stewards \n    1. Each working group must appoint a lead Steward within the first five days of a Term (hereafter a 'Lead Steward' or 'Lead Stewards\").\n    2. Only current elected Stewards of a working group are eligible to serve as Lead Stewards within a given working group.\n    3. Lead Stewards may be appointed or removed from that role at any time by a simple indicative majority vote among the Stewards of a working group, with the outcome of that vote communicated in the relevant working group category of the ENS governance forum.\n    4. In the event that a Lead Steward steps down from the position or is removed as a Lead Steward before the end of a Term in accordance with rule 8.3 above, a new Lead Steward must be appointed within five calendar days.  \n    5. A Steward who is appointed to serve as a Lead Steward of a working group will remain in that position, as Lead Steward, from the date of appointment until the end of their elected Term as a Steward or until they are removed as a Lead Steward in accordance with rule 8.3 above or until they are removed as a Steward in accordance with rule 7 above.\n    6. Lead Stewards are responsible for the operational management and administration of working groups and are expected to provide regular updates to the DAO in the ENS governance forum related to working group progress, achievements, and challenges.\n    7. The responsibilities of Lead Stewards include, but are not limited to:\n        1. Acting as a representative of a working group;\n        2. Managing resource requests from sub-groups, workstreams, and contributors within a working group;\n        3. Initiating the disbursement of working group funds on an as-needed basis;\n        4. Providing reports of working group spending in the ENS governance forum; and \n        5. Maintaining open communications with DAO participants in the ENS governance forum.\n\n9. DAO Secretary  \n    1. At the start of each Term, the current Stewards of each working group shall collaborate to appoint an individual who will serve as the secretary of the DAO (hereafter 'Secretary' or 'Secretaries').\n    2. The Secretary may be appointed or removed from that role at any time by a majority vote of all elected Stewards in a given Term with the outcome of that vote communicated in the ENS governance forum.\n    3. The Secretary will remain in that position, as Secretary of the DAO, from the date of appointment until the end of a given Term or until the date at which they are removed from that position in accordance with rule 9.2 above. \n    4. Secretaries are eligible to receive fair compensation for their work as Secretary of the DAO.\n    5. Compensation for the Secretary of the DAO is to be paid by the Meta-Governance Working Group using funds requested in accordance with rule 10 below. \n    6. Any individual is eligible to be appointed as the Secretary of the DAO, including past and present working group Stewards.\n    7. The Secretary is responsible for managing working relationships and communications across working groups as well as performing administrative duties for the DAO.\n    8. The responsibilities of the Secretary include, but are not limited to:\n        1. Managing a DAO-wide calendar; \n        2. Coordinating and attending working group meetings where possible and ensuring meeting summaries are posted in the ENS governance forum; \n        3. Assisting Stewards with coordination challenges within working groups; and\n        4. Acting as a multi-sig keyholder for each working group.\n\n10. Working Group Funds  \n    1. To request working group funds, Stewards of all working groups will collaborate to submit an active executable proposal, as defined by the ENS governance documentation ('Collective Proposal'), to the DAO during the months of January, April, July, and October each calendar year (each a ‘Funding Window’).\n        1. In order for a working group to have a funding request included in a Collective Proposal submitted to the DAO during a Funding Window, the funding request must have passed as a Social Proposal in the same Funding Window.\n        2. In the case of an emergency, where working group funds are needed by a working group outside of a Funding Window, an executable proposal, as defined by the ENS governance documentation, may be submitted at any time by a Steward of a working group to request funds from the DAO.\n    2. Working group funds requested and approved in accordance with rule 10.1 above are to be paid out into separate working group multi-sigs controlled by the DAO. \n    3. Each working group multi-sig must have four keyholders, made up of three current elected Stewards for that working group and the Secretary of the DAO for that Term, with no other keyholders permitted. \n    4. Working group funds may be disbursed from working group multi-sigs with three-of-four keyholder signing. \n    5. Stewards of a given working group shall have the discretion to reallocate funds approved in a Collective Proposal where appropriate and where it is not in conflict with any rules of the DAO, DAO bylaws, or the ENS DAO constitution.\n    \n11. Compensation for Stewards and Lead Stewards \n    1. Stewards are eligible to receive fair compensation for their work as a Steward or Lead Steward in the DAO. \n    2. All requests for Steward or Lead Steward compensation must be detailed in a Collective Proposal for working group funds submitted to the DAO in accordance with rule 10.1 above.\n    3. Stewards may not receive compensation for their role as a Steward or Lead Steward outside of that compensation expressly provided for in a Collective Proposal submitted to the DAO in accordance with rule 10.1 above.\n\n12. Amendments\n    1. These rules may be amended at any time by passing a Social Proposal.\n\n## Voting\n\nThis vote will be a single choice vote. You may vote 'for' or 'against' the proposal, or choose to abstain from the vote.\n\nBy voting 'for' this proposal, you are voting in favor of repealing the working group rules passed in EP4 and replacing them with the working group rules provided in the specification of this proposal.\n",

      "title": "[EP9] [Executable] Change to Exponential Premium Price Oracle",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nProposes to deploy Exponential Price Oracle Contract to replace the current Linear Price Oracle Contract.\n\n# Abstract\n\nIn the past we deployed the Linear Premium Oracle as a way to create a distribution mechanism that did not involve gas auctions and bots. This was largely successful and those who wanted a recently expired name could participate in the dutch auction and not have to compete on gas or with bots. Recently with the popularity of ENS increasing, the demand and the price people are willing to pay for these premium names has increased. In response to this TNL quickly drafted a [short-term solution](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep5-executable-set-the-temporary-premium-start-price-to-100-000/9336) to raise the premium to 100k, which we felt was the upper limit for what a linear price decay curve could handle.\n\nThere are a couple reasons for this:\n\n1. On a linear curve, if the price is too high the price decreases too fast and the UX is bad for a user who wants an exact price (especially at the lower end of the curve)\n2. If you extend the time period out, the premium lasts for too long. E.g. If we made it 1 million USD and we wanted a similar price decay speed as 100k, we would need to run it for 10 months, which seems unreasonable.\n\nWe can see from the data below, even with the new 100k premium, we have already had a 5-7 domains go for maximum, or close to maximum premium. If a domain sells for the actual premium, it means the dutch auction is not doing its job and so we need to deploy a long-term solution for dealing with premium pricing.\n\n```\nRow\tlabel\tevent_timestamp\tpremium\t\n1\tbbc 2022-01-30 17:46:03 UTC 100230.75321837279\n2\tmets 2022-02-04 17:16:22 UTC 100082.49847319399\n3\tfbi 2022-02-05 06:02:31 UTC 99894.00632472485\n4\tfly 2022-02-04 18:49:00 UTC 99747.22640247621\n5\tups 2022-02-05 07:46:24 UTC 98822.14747808539\n6\tdog 2022-02-06 16:19:05 UTC 92950.09208752771\n7\tubs 2022-02-01 15:31:35 UTC 89633.15081063367\n8\tubi 2022-02-19 17:06:17 UTC 72161.56328771653\n9\tpunks 2022-02-16 00:15:44 UTC 59153.166146336\n10\tomg 2022-02-24 16:05:57 UTC 33214.42499419019\n```\n\nThe long-term solution would be to change the actual curve to something that could start at a very high price, would decrease rapidly at the beginning and slow down at the end so you have better UX for users. And therefore this proposal is to deploy an exponential price curve, that does exactly this. This would allow fairer bidding on both high and low priced names.\n\n# Contract Code\n\nhttps://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/master/contracts/ethregistrar/ExponentialPremiumPriceOracle.sol\n\n# Specification\nCall `setPriceOracle` on `controller.ens.eth`, passing in the address of the deployed `ExponentialPremiumPriceOracle` (TBD).\n```",

      "title": "[EP10] [Executable] Fund a DAO-Governed Identity Server",
      "content": "Authors: [Gregory Rocco](https://github.com/obstropolos), [Wayne Chang](https://github.com/wyc)\n\n# Description\nThis proposal is for the funding and establishment of a community-run OIDC Identity Provider Server for Sign-In with Ethereum, maintained by Spruce.\n\nTemperature check originally from [this post](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/a-credibly-neutral-sign-in-with-ethereum-identity-provider-server/11001)\n\n# Abstract\nIn our research, we found that many services wanted to integrate the Sign-In with Ethereum workflow but did not have the ability to add new passwordless authentication methods to their installations.\n\nWe also learned that most services already support OpenID Connect, and were open to adding a new Identity Provider that supported the SIWE workflow. By meeting those services where they are today, we can provide a pragmatic stepping stone towards true decentralization, with an upgrade path to direct authentication. \n\nTo ensure adherence to the vision, it's critical that we collaborate with the ENS DAO on hosting and maintenance of this identity server, ensuring the identity server's governance ultimately resides with the community, whom we believe will always put users first. This would be the world’s first DAO-hosted, transparent identity server.\n\n# Rationale\nThe ENS service and community would benefit from increased adoption of Sign-In with Ethereum due to the enablement of organizations to use ENS as a core touchpoint for a user’s basic identity and information (via ENS profiles).\n\nAdditionally, we believe that a community server could be governed by a credibly neutral party that Ethereum users accept as an intermediary. We think a non-profit or DAO are the right structures to help govern such a server, which is why we would like to collaborate with the ENS DAO on hosting and maintenance.\n\n# Specification and Proposal Request\n\n- **Establish a Subgroup in the Ecosystem Working Group: Community Managed Identity Server**\n    - **$250,000** allocated from the DAO to the Ecosystem WG to fund this Subgroup. \n        - **$75,000** from the allocated budget will be in place for community contributions related to the Subgroup, including grants for development, evangelism, and retroactive rewards for SIWE-related efforts.\n        -  **$175,000** from the allocated budget will go towards Spruce's maintenance contract (see below). Paid 25% upon execution, and then an additional 25% every 3 months. \n    - This Subgroup will support the administration and maintenance of a DAO-run Identity Server for Sign-In with Ethereum. This subgroup will also serve as a support system to help onboard organizations, and evangelize Sign-In with Ethereum to allow users to control their identifiers and use ENS profiles as a base identity.\n    - An important part of duties this group will include creating training, onboarding, and maintenance materials for managing the server on a specified cloud account.\n    - Additionally, the group will be responsible for providing updates to the broader community on the health of the server. \n    - Initial lead: Rocco from Spruce, while continuing to add interested parties to the group for good governance. \n    \n- **A 12-month maintenance contract awarded to Spruce for the continuous monitoring, maintaining, and improving of the deployed Identity Server.**\n    - Spruce will help host a [`siwe-oidc`](https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-oidc) implementation in a lightweight fashion, using a well-known infrastructure provider ultimately administered by the Subgroup.\n        - Spruce will also be responsible for the deployment, and continuous monitoring, maintenance, and improvements on the server throughout the duration of the contract. \n    - If the DAO votes to end the contract funding will be returned against the remaining days of the year and we will provide sufficient training for administrators to transfer those duties to a new organization.\n    - The server is expected to be live within 60 days of this proposal being accepted, assuming that access to the necessary systems and people is provided on a timely basis. \n    - The 1-year contract begins when this proposal is accepted, and there will not be additional setup fees even if there are increased coordination costs to get the service running.",

      "content": "# Summary\nProposes to reimburse True Names Limited for expenses incurred on behalf of ENS and the DAO.\n\n# Abstract\nSince ENS started allowing registrations using the annual-fee model, revenue from this has accrued to the ENS root multisig, which is controlled by seven individuals drawn from the Ethereum community. In order to shield them from individual tax liability, True Names Limited, the development company responsible for ENS development, historically identified itself as the beneficial owner of these funds, which obliged True Names to pay tax on any income to the multisig.\n\nIn past years True Names has covered this tax bill from its own reserves - primarily out of funds that were collected during the Short Name auction - but in 2021 revenue rose to a level that meant that was no longer sustainable. Accordingly, True Names requested funds from the multisig to cover the anticipated tax, and the multisig agreed.\n\nThe calculation used to determine the tax owing used the actual income to October 20th, plus a 1/12th buffer to cover the anticipated income between the launch of the DAO and its potential request for control of the funds from the keyholders. This total came to $2,163,921 USDC.\n\nHowever, this failed to take into account the enormous uptick in interest that the announcement of the DAO produced, and so falls significantly short of True Names' actual tax obligations for FY 2021. This proposal requests that the DAO sends True Names the remainder of the funds required to cover the multisig's income during the period that True Names was the beneficial owner.\n\nFurther, True Names has incurred the following expenses on behalf of the DAO in January 2022:\n\n![Screenshot from 2022-01-28 09-27-45|617x500](upload://1jcGsmCKdHJpl5D0a7CAKr6Bmmd.png)\n\nWe additionally request the DAO reimburse True Names for these expenses in the total of $48,637.\n\n## Revenue\nRevenue to the multisig came exclusively from ENS name registrations and renewals, and can be calculated from onchain data using [this BigQuery query](https://gist.github.com/Arachnid/dfd374886a3e6b0a0eb17b26703d776a), producing the following results:\n\n|Month|ETH|USD|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Jan 2021|411.6875|498484.22|\n|Feb 2021|383.5613|643985.05|\n|Mar 2021|453.5619|776834.28|\n|Apr 2021|429.0654|955345.36|\n|May 2021|243.0624|740165.91|\n|Jun 2021|422.2419|993899.95|\n|Jul 2021|384.6863|811202.23|\n|Aug 2021|849.9890|2563121.38|\n|Sep 2021|728.7825|2490699.18|\n|Oct 2021|500.3753|1863125.83|\n|Nov 2021|1699.4660|7643673.03|\n|**Total**|**6506.4793**|**19980536.41**|\n\n## Tax\nSingapore's company tax rate is 17%, meaning that the tax owing on $19,980,536 comes to $3,396,691.

Elected steward compensation: $12,000 in cDAI\n2. Bounties for ENS Public Goods Request for Proposals program: $50,000 in cDAI\n3. Operational Budget $38,000 in cDAI\n\n**Total for Q1 & Q2: $150,000.00 in cDAI**\n\nThe group will be using the price of cDAI in uniswap to calculate the exact amounts requested. We are using cDAI as a accounting unit as a manner to provide a stable value that will still accrue value while not in utilization and resist dollar depreciation. The group can convert them in DAI when sending out payments and grants. The current price of cDAI orbits around 0.021-0.022 per dai and the total budget would be, in today’s value, about 6.85M cDAI.\n\n**Elected steward compensation**\n\nThe group has 5 elected stewards: Alex (avsa.eth), makoto.eth, sumedha.eth, Scott and Richard Moore (Ricmoo.eth). Two of these steward are appointed by True Names and will not be receiving compensation, and one of the other stewards has elected to forego compensation and therefore we will asking only for a total of 12k USD for the total Steward Compensation. Pay for past months will be sent immediately and the remaining will be streamed until june 30th.\n\n**Bounties for ENS Public Goods Request for Proposals program:**\n\nThe bounties will be distributed in prizes of $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000 for projects that execute on basic implementation of goals elected by the stewards. These are set to be given directly to projects and not spent on operations. Any funds remaining at the end of the term will be either given back to the DAO or rolled in the Public Goods stewards budget for the next term.\n\n**Operational Budget**\n\nThese will encompass tasks like reimbursements for expenses executed by stewards, payment for projects like a website, social media, or compensation for work done in partner integrations. All payments must be approved by at least 3 other stewards and will be executed in the most transparent manner the stewards can find.\n",

      "content": "# Summary\n\nThe Ecosystem WG is requesting funding to start the Q1/Q2 2022 term. The initial request is made up of three components:\n\n1. Elected steward compensation: $27,500 in USDC/DAI\n2. Bounties for the Bug Bounty program: $50,000 in USDC/DAI\n3. Ecosystem WG operational budget: $50,000 in USDC/DAI, 6 ETH, and 6,500 $ENS\n\n### Bug Bounty\n\nThe ENS Bounty Program provides bounties for bugs. This program has been running since 2017 and historically has been funded by True Names Limited (TNL). With the creation of the DAO, the DAO is now able to manage and fund the bug bounty. Details of the program can be found [here](https://docs.ens.domains/bug-bounty-program). The $50,000 will be awarded to developers outside of TNL who find vulnerabilities in the ENS protocol. As well as funding for white hat coding in response to system vulnerabilities which arise.\n\n### Operational Budget\n\nThe operational budget supports ecosystem subgroups with the following allocations:\n\n|Subgroup Name|Description|USDC/DAI|ETH|$ENS|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Hackathons|Bounties, judging, and facilitating and managing ENS’s hackathon participation.|$10,000|||\n|Integrations|Bounties for ecosystem integration support|$10,000||500|\n|3rd Party Projects|Support projects that improve the ENS ecosystem, through proactive and retroactive grants.|$10,000|6|1,000|\n|Bug Bounty|Administer the bug bounty program|$5,000|||\n|WG Unallocated Funds|Funds to be allocated to the above subgroups or facilitate the funding of new subgroups as the council of stewards deem necessary|$15,000||5,000|\n|Total||$50,000 USDC/DAI|6 ETH|6,500 $ENS|\n\n### Elected Steward Compensation\n\nProvide compensation for the stewarding and the coordination efforts of active elected stewards.\n\n|Description|Compensation|Months #|Stewards #|Total|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Base Compensation|$1,000/month|5.5|3|$16,500|\n|Supplement compensation*|$2,000/month|5.5|N/A|$11,000|\n|Total||||$27,500 USDC/DAI|\n\n*Supplement compensation is allocated to the steward who supports coordination or who has greater involvement in DAO activities above what is expected of a steward. The steward council determines how the supplemental compensation is split between the stewards based on contributions of each steward.\n\nIt should be noted that the ecosystem working group has three elected stewards (@slobo.eth, @Ginge.eth, @bobjiang) and two appointed stewards (@nick.eth, @jefflau.eth). The appointed stewards are not compensated via this request.",

This budget does not guarantee disbursement, specifically if services rendered to the DAO are incomplete or deemed unsatisfactory. If these situations arise, the working group will review them publicly at the weekly Community Steward Call. \n\nAny funding not used will be re-allocated back to the treasury.\n",

      "title": "[EP5] [Executable] Set the temporary premium start price to $100,000",
      "content": "[Discussion Thread](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep5-executable-set-the-temporary-premium-start-price-to-100-000/9336)\n\n# Summary\nIncreases the start price for the temporary premium added when names expire from $2,000 to $100,000.\n\n# Abstract\nWhen a name expires, it goes through a 90 day grace period, after which it becomes available for general registration. To prevent it becoming a race to register, a ‘temporary premium’ is attached, starting at $2000 and diminishing to 0 over 28 days. Done properly this results in a dutch auction for the name.\n\nWhen the premium was set, $2000 was roughly the 98th percentile of all auction prices for the short name auction, and seemed like a reasonable starting price. Today, we’re seeing multiple reports of names, particularly 3 character names, being snapped up by bots the moment they become available at the maximum premium.\n\nLong-term we can improve the mechanism by setting the initial premium based on the base price of the name (so 3 letter names start off more expensive than 5+ letter names), and by introducing a nonlinear pricing curve (for example, having the price diminish by 1% per hour for 28 days). In the short term, however, I’d like to propose setting the initial premium to a much higher value, which we can do with a simple transaction from the DAO account.\n\nResearch of current trends shows:\n - 2,798 names have been bought during the temporary premium period so far.\n - Of these, 340 (12%) were purchased the moment they became available.\n - Registrations of names during the temporary premium period have been on the increase since the DAO launched in November.\n - 12 names have been purchased at a premium and flipped on OpenSea; the most valuable of these, punk.eth, went for $85,636.\n\nAccordingly, I propose increasing the temporary premium from its current value of $2,000 to a new value of $100,000. This will ensure that the start price exceeds the secondary market resale value of almost all released domains, and corresponds to a rate of decrease of just under $150/hr, meaning that less valuable domains will still have a multi-hour period during which people can purchase them before the premium expires.\n\nIn parallel, work should be initiated on a new nonlinear premium model, so that high initial premiums can be combined with a slow decrease towards 0, allowing both high and low value names to be bid on fairly.\n\n# Specification\n 1. Deploy a new instance of the `LinearPremiumPriceOracle` with the initial premium set to 100,000 USD and the period set to 28 days, with other pricing variables identical to the current oracle.\n 2. Call `setPriceOracle` on `controller.ens.eth`, passing in the address of the new price oracle contract.\n\n# Code\nTBD",

      "title": "[EP4] [Social] Proposal: Create foundational working groups and working group rules",
      "content": "## Summary\nCreate four foundational working groups and establish rules related to the creation, management, and dissolution of working groups within the ENS DAO.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe work-related activities of the ENS DAO will take place within working groups. Each working group will have a specific focus area and mission, aligned with the constitution and needs of the DAO.\n\nThis proposal establishes four foundational working groups:\n\n1. Meta-Governance: providing governance oversight and support of the management and operation of the ENS DAO and working groups;\n2. ENS Ecosystem: continuing development and improvement of the ENS protocol and ecosystem, with a focus on all technical matters related to ENS;\n3. Community: supporting the people and organizations that are users of ENS, with a focus on non-technical matters; and\n4. Public Goods: amplifying ENS as a public good and funding public goods within the ENS ecosystem, and more broadly within web3.\n\nThis proposal also sets out rules related to the creation and dissolution of working groups and outlines how working groups will be managed within the DAO.\n\n## Motivation\n\nEstablishing working groups to manage DAO-related work will allow decisions to be made, and action to be taken, without the need for every initiative or decision of the DAO to be passed as a proposal.\n\nThe creation of working groups will streamline the management of the DAO into core areas that will persist, irrespective of changes in activities or contributors. A working group system will promote stability and encourage long-term thinking and planning.\n\nThe working group structure will provide new and existing community members clear onboarding pathways for meaningful participation and engagement in the DAO.\n\n## Specification\n\nCreate four foundational working groups and establish rules related to the creation, management, and dissolution of working groups within the ENS DAO (‘**DAO**’).\n\n1. **Working Groups**\n   1. Four foundational working groups will be established within the DAO:\n      1. Meta-Governance Working Group;\n      2. ENS Ecosystem Working Group;\n      3. Community Working Group; and\n      4. Public Goods Working Group.\n2. **Formation of Working Groups**\n   1. To create a new working group, a social proposal, as defined by the [ENS governance documentation](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/process#types-of-proposal) (‘**Social Proposal**’), must be put forward and passed by the DAO.\n   2. A Social Proposal to create a new working group must demonstrate that the new working group is needed and the work cannot be undertaken within an existing working group.\n3. **Dissolution of Working Groups**\n   1. A working group can be dissolved by passing a Social Proposal requesting the dissolution of a working group or working groups.\n   2. If an active proposal is put forward to dissolve a working group, all working group funds, including outgoing payments, within that working group, are to be frozen with immediate effect, pending the outcome of the vote.\n   3. Upon the dissolution of a working group, any and all unspent working group funds from that working group, at the time of dissolution, must be immediately returned to the DAO treasury, without delay.\n4. **Working Group Stewards**\n   1. Each working group shall be managed by five stewards (hereafter a ‘**Steward**’ or ‘**Stewards**’).\n   2. Stewards will be elected, unless otherwise stated in these rules, to serve within working groups for a set period of time (hereafter known as a ‘**Term**’ or ‘**Terms**’).\n   3. There are two Terms each calendar year:\n      1. The first Term commences at 9am UTC on January 1 each year and ends immediately prior to the commencement of the second Term (‘**First Term**’); and\n      2. The second Term commences at 9am UTC on July 1 each year and ends immediately prior to the commencement of the First Term of the following year (‘**Second Term**’).\n   4. Stewards are responsible for managing the operations of each working group.\n   5. The responsibilities of Stewards include, but are not limited to:\n      1. Managing operational tasks related to the administration of a working group;\n      2. Maintaining a description that sets forth the focus and intent of the working group;\n      3. Developing working group goals for the Term and providing a clear road map for achieving those goals, to be published in the ENS governance forum within the first 30 days of a Term;\n      4. Approving the creation and dissolution of sub-groups or workstreams within a working group to undertake work and/or carry out specific projects or tasks;\n      5. Requesting working group funds from the DAO; and\n      6. Approving and making funding available to sub-groups, workstreams, or contributors within a working group.\n   6. To request working group funds, Stewards of all working groups will collaborate to submit an active executable proposal, as defined by the [ENS governance documentation](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/process#types-of-proposal) ('**Collective Proposal**'), to the DAO within the final 15 days (inclusive) of the months of January, March, July, and October each calendar year (each a ‘**Funding Window**’).\n      1. In order for a working group to have a funding request included in a Collective Proposal submitted to the DAO during a Funding Window, the funding request must have passed as a Social Proposal in the same Funding Window.\n      2. In the case of an emergency, where working group funds are needed by a working group outside of a Funding Window, an Executable Proposal may be submitted at any time by a Steward of a working group to request funds from the DAO.\n5. **Steward Eligibility and Nominations**\n   1. Any individual is eligible to nominate themselves to be a Steward of a working group within the DAO (‘**Eligible Person**’ or ‘**Eligible Persons**’).\n   2. To be eligible to be included in the ballot for First Term elections of a given year, Eligible Persons must nominate themselves between 9am UTC on December 6 and 9am UTC on December 9 (‘**First Term Nomination Window**’).\n   3. To be eligible to be included in the ballot for Second Term elections of a given year, Eligible Persons must nominate themselves between 9am UTC on June 6 and 9am UTC on June 9 (‘**Second Term Nomination Window**’).\n   4. An Eligible Person may nominate themselves to become a Steward of a working group or working groups during the First Term Nomination Window or the Second Term Nomination Window (each a ‘**Nomination Window**’), by meeting the requirements set out in a call for nominations posted in the relevant working group category of the ENS governance forum.\n   5. An Eligible Person who completes the steps outlined in rule 5.4 above during a Nomination Window and receives 10,000 signed votes to support their nomination will be included in the ballot as a nominee in the election for Stewards that takes place following that Nomination Window (‘**Nominee**’).\n6. **Steward Elections**\n   1. Elections for working group Stewards for the First Term of a given year will take place by a ranked-choice vote of governance token holders using signed messages and will be open for 120 hours, commencing at 9am UTC on December 10 each year (‘**First Term Election Window**’).\n   2. Elections for working group Stewards for the Second Term of a given year will take place by a ranked-choice vote of governance token holders using signed messages and will be open for 120 hours, commencing at 9am UTC on June 10 each year (**‘Second Term Election Window**’).\n   3. The top-ranked Nominees from each working group vote held during a First Term Election Window or a Second Term Election Window (each an '**Election Window**'), will fill any available positions for the role of Steward for those working groups for the Term immediately following an Election Window, based on the order in which they are ranked in each working group vote.\n   4. A Nominee elected to serve as a Steward may not take up the role of Steward for more than two working groups during a single Term.\n7. **Delay of Nominations or Elections**\n   1. In the event that nominations or elections for Stewards take place after a Nomination Window or after an Election Window, the nomination process or elections shall take place, as otherwise prescribed in rules 5 and 6 above, as soon as is practicable after the missed Nomination Window or missed Election Window.\n   2. In the event that an election takes place outside of an Election Window and after the commencement date of a new Term, outgoing Stewards from the previous Term shall stay in their positions as working group Stewards until immediately prior to 9am UTC the day following the end of the election, which, for the avoidance of doubt, is 120 hours after voting in those elections commenced.\n   3. In the event that an election takes place outside of an Election Window and after the commencement date of a new Term, newly elected Stewards will assume the responsibilities of stewardship within working groups at 9am UTC the day following the end of the election, as defined in rule 7.2 above, for the remainder of that Term.\n8. **Core Team Stewards**\n   1. For the First Term, commencing January 1 2022 at 9am UTC, each working group will include two Stewards who are core team members of True Names Limited (Singapore) (‘**TNL**’), as selected by TNL and not subject to the Steward nomination and election process outlined in rules 5 and 6 above.\n   2. For the Second Term, commencing July 1 2022 at 9am UTC, each working group will include one Steward who is a core team member of TNL, as selected by TNL and not subject to the Steward nomination and election process outlined in rules 5 and 6 above.\n   3. For the First Term of the following year, commencing January 1 2023, and for all Terms thereafter, all Stewards must be elected and appointed in accordance with the rules set out in rules 5 and 6 above.\n9. **Removal and Replacement of Stewards**\n   1. Stewards may be removed at any time by:\n      1. a Social Proposal passed by the DAO; or\n      2. a simple indicative majority vote among the Stewards of a given working group, with the outcome of the vote communicated in the relevant working group category of the ENS governance forum.\n   2. Stewards may step down from their position at any time by communicating their intention to step down in the ENS governance forum.\n   3. In the event that a Steward is removed, steps down, or is unable to continue as a Steward, for whatever reason, prior to the end of a Term, any vacant positions will be filled for the remainder of a Term by the next highest ranked Nominee(s) in a given working group from the most recent working group vote in the most recent election for Stewards.\n   4. In the event that a Steward steps down or is removed prior to the end of a Term and is a member of the core team of TNL in accordance with rule 8.1 or 8.2 above, the vacant position(s) will be filled by a core team member or team members of TNL, as selected by TNL.\n   5. Any Steward selected by TNL in accordance with rule 8.1 or 8.2 above, can be removed by TNL at any time prior to the end of a Term, for any reason, and replaced by another core team member for the remainder of that Term.\n10. **Compensation for Stewards**\n    1. Elected Stewards are eligible to receive fair compensation for their work as a Steward.\n    2. All requests for Steward compensation must be detailed in a Collective Proposal for working group funds submitted to the DAO in accordance with rule 4.6.\n    3. Stewards may not receive compensation for their role as a Steward outside of that compensation expressly provided for in a Collective Proposal submitted to the DAO in accordance with rule 10.2.\n    4. Stewards selected by TNL are not eligible to receive compensation from the DAO or working groups for their work as a Steward.\n11. **Amendments**\n    1. These rules may be amended at any time by passing a Social Proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nThis proposal will be open for voting on Snapshot for five days. This vote will be a single choice vote. You may vote 'for' or 'against' the proposal, or choose to abstain from the vote.\n\nBy voting 'for' this proposal, you are voting in favor of creating four foundational working groups and establishing rules related to the creation, management, and dissolution of working groups within the ENS DAO, as provided in this proposal.\n\nGiven the time of year, Steward nominations and elections for the First Term of 2022 will be delayed until the beginning of 2022.\n\nThe Nomination Window for the First Term of 2022 will be open between 9am UTC on January 5, 2022 and 9am UTC on January 8, 2022. Any individual is eligible to nominate themselves to be a Steward of a working group or working groups during this Nomination Window. All Eligible Persons who satisfy the requirements set out in rule 5.4 and 5.5 will be included on the ballot for the First Term elections. More details about the nomination process will be available in the call for nominations released prior to the Nomination Window opening.\n\nThe Election Window for the First Term of 2022 will be open for 120 hours, commencing at 9am UTC on January 10 2022. Following the election, in accordance with rule 7.3, newly elected Stewards will assume the responsibilities of stewardship within working groups at 9am UTC on January 16, 2022, for the remainder of the First Term.\n\nTo stay up to date on developments regarding working groups, please follow the DAO-Bulletin channel in the [ENS Discord Server](https://chat.ens.domains) and follow [@ens\\_dao](https://twitter.com/ens\\_dao) on Twitter.\n\n[Forum thread](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep4-social-proposal-creation-of-foundational-working-groups-and-working-group-rules/8156)",

As of December 6, this  amounted to some 6,246 tokens in 49 separate transactions.\n\nThese funds are held in the same account as is used for new airdrop claims, and on May 4, 2022 when the airdrop expires, the DAO will be able to claim them back to its own account.\n\n[EP2](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/executable-retrospective-airdrop-for-accounts-that-owned-another-accounts-primary-ens-name/6755) sends approximately 200k tokens to users who owned ENS names that were used as primary names but did not already benefit from the 2x multiplier.\n\nThis proposal suggests that [EP2](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/executable-retrospective-airdrop-for-accounts-that-owned-another-accounts-primary-ens-name/6755) be amended to include returning the mistakenly sent funds as part of the same airdrop.

      "title": "[EP2] [Executable] Retrospective airdrop for accounts that owned another account's primary ENS name",
      "content": "# Summary\nSend 213,049 ENS tokens to a new airdrop contract for users who did not receive the 2x multiplier despite owning a name that was used as a primary ENS name.\n\n# Abstract\nOne of the criteria used for the ENS airdrop was whether the account had a primary ENS name set. Those accounts that did got a 2x multiplier on their airdrop amount. The intention was to use this as a measure of involvement in the ENS ecosystem; those accounts that set primary ENS names are typically using their names in supported applications, while those that don't are less likely to be doing so.\n\nThe way this was implemented was to award the multiplier to all accounts that had interacted with the reverse registrar. This had the unintended side effect that if a user owned an ENS name on account A, and configured it to resolve to account B, which used it as its primary name, account A would get tokens, and account B would get the multiplier. As B doesn't own any names, the multiplier has no effect and the end result is that some users got fewer tokens than they would have if they had used the same account for everything.\n\nThis proposal aims to correct this, by introducing a new criteria for determining who to award the multiplier to, and creating a new airdrop contract for all accounts that qualify for the new criteria but not the old one.\n\nIn plain english terms, the new criteria is that the account must have at some point in time owned a name that was used as the primary ENS name for an account.\n\nMore formally, for each account `a`, the account is assigned the multiplier if there exists a name `n` and a time before 2021-11-01 00:00:00 UTC, where all of the following are true:\n 1. `a` is the registrant of `n`.\n 2. `n` has a resolver, `r`, set on the ENS registry.\n 3. `r` has an `addr` record, `a'`, set for `n`, and has emitted an `AddrChanged` event to record this fact.\n 4. The reverse record for `a'` has a resolver, `r'`, set on the ENS registry.\n 5. `r'` has a `name` record, `n'`, set for the reverse record of `a`. `r'` is either the default reverse resolver, or has emitted a `NameChanged` event for `n'` and `a'`.\n 6. `n == n'`.\n\nThis logic is implemented by [this series of BigQuery queries](https://gist.github.com/Arachnid/667178e854945abaecb6dfd3b6c0c279), and shows that 1,969 accounts meet these criteria but did not qualify for the multiplier under the original criteria. The sum of the tokens these accounts would be entitled to comes to ~213,049 ENS tokens.\n\nA list of affected accounts and balances is [here](https://gist.github.com/Arachnid/d6495f57ac6a5b17cf28e01b646e99a8).\n\nThis proposal, if executed, will transfer 213,049 ENS tokens to [a new merkle airdrop contract](https://github.com/ensdomains/governance/pull/9) allowing affected users to claim them.\n\n# Specification\n1. Request that True Names Limited write and deploy a contract that allows claiming of tokens via Merkle Proofs using the same methodology as was used for the airdrop.\n 2. Request that True Names Limited make changes to the claim.ens.domains site to support claiming this additional airdrop for qualifying accounts.\n3. Authorise the contract deployed in (1) to spend 213049736662531485206636 base ENS tokens from the ENS DAO account.\n\n# Code\n```\nconst ethers = require('ethers');\nconst abi = [\n  'function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)'\n];\nconst token = new ethers.Contract('0xC18360217D8F7Ab5e7c516566761Ea12Ce7F9D72', abi);\nconst airdropAddress = 'TBD';\nconst tx = await token.populateTransaction.approve(airdropAddress, '213049736662531485206636');\nconsole.log([token.address]);\nconsole.log([0]);\nconsole.log([tx.data]);\n```\n\n[Forum thread](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/executable-retrospective-airdrop-for-accounts-that-owned-another-accounts-primary-ens-name/6755)",

We propose that ownership of the ENS Registrar Controller and the pricing oracle is transferred to the DAO.\n   Ownership of the price oracle gives the DAO the ability to:\n\n   1. Set the contract used to get the USD-ETH price.*\n   2. Change the price per year of each length of domain name.\n\n   Ownership of the registrar controller gives the DAO the ability to:\n   1. Replace the price oracle contract.\n   2. Withdraw accumulated funds to the DAO treasury.\n   3. Set the minimum and maximum period between the first and second transactions of the registration process.\n\n3. We propose that ownership of the ENS Registrar is transferred to the DAO. Ownership of the .eth registrar gives the DAO the ability to:\n\n   1. Add and remove controller contracts.\n   2. Set the resolver contract for .eth\n\n4. We propose that ownership of the ‘.reverse’ namespace, which governs assignment of primary ENS records, be transferred to the DAO. Ownership of the .reverse TLD gives the DAO the ability to:\n\n   1. Replace the reverse registrar for Ethereum addresses.\n   2. Create new types of reverse resolution (For example, bitcoin addresses) and update them.\n\nImportantly, control over the ENS root will remain with the ENS root multisig for now. Control over the root allows for the creation and replacement of ENS top-level domains (TLDs) other than .eth (.eth is locked and cannot be changed by the root). This proposal also does not transfer ownership of the DNSSEC registrar contract, necessary for administering the DNSSEC integration used to allow owners of DNS domains to claim them on ENS.\n\nPowers over the ENS root are not being requested immediately, as they are both powers that can be abused to revoke or reassign non-.eth ENS names, and as such the risk to name owners is significantly higher than the other powers the DAO will exercise. Once the DAO has demonstrated its ability to sucsessfully govern ENS, a future proposal will transfer these powers to the DAO.\n\nSnapshot voting on the above proposals will be conducted individually via approval voting; any proposal above that gets at least 50% approval and a quorum of 1% becomes the official policy of the DAO.\n\n# Specification\nThe ENS DAO formally petitions the ENS root keyholders (being the owners of the multisig located at multisig.ens.eth) to execute a transaction or transactions taking the following actions:\n\n1. If proposal 1 passes, transfer all ETH and USDC held by multisig.ens.eth to the DAO’s timelock contract at wallet.ensdao.eth.\n2. If proposal 2 passes, call `transferOwnership` on the contracts at controller.ens.eth and 0xb9d374d0fe3d8341155663fae31b7beae0ae233a (the price oracle), passing in the address of wallet.ensdao.eth.\n3. If proposal 3 passes, call `transferOwnership` on the contract at registrar.ens.eth, passing in the address of wallet.ensdao.eth.\n4. If proposal 4 passes, call `setSubnodeOwner` on the root, passing in `keccak256(‘reverse’)` and the address of wallet.ensdao.eth.\n\nThe ENS DAO agrees to use these funds and powers in accordance with the ENS Constitution.\n\n# Conclusion & Next Steps\n\nThis proposal looks to set precedent as the first action taken by ENS delegates & token holders. Upon successful execution, the ENS DAO will hold control over two significant aspects of the protocol, and will be able to dispense funds effectively towards community initiatives.\n\n* Discuss this proposal on the ENS forum and discord.\n* Implement a vote on this proposal on Snapshot.\n* If passed:\n  * Transfer existing assets from the ENS Community multisig to the ENS DAO.\n  * Transfer control over the Registrar Controller to the ENS DAO.\n\nThis vote is being conducted via approval voting; select each option you wish to see pass. Those options that have at least 50% support and 1% quorum when voting ends will pass",

      "content": "This vote proposes to ratify the ENS DAO Constitution with SHA1 hash [e8be5fdbe1b0267c283a397f2a7128206689398c](https://github.com/ensdomains/governance-docs/blob/6bd1b2f4e29e9cdc48f5553325fb704de2fdc2b3/ens-dao-constitution.md), reproduced below for convenience.\n\nIf, at the end of the voting period, all articles have at least two-thirds approval, the Constitution as a whole will be considered passed, effective immediately.\n\nIf at least one article has less than two-thirds approval at the end of the voting period, only the articles with at least two-thirds approval will be considered passed, and amendment and ratification of the remaining articles, and any new articles, becomes the responsibility of ENS DAO delegates. In such a situation, the modified Constitution may be ratified by an article-by-article approval vote by delegates with a period of at least one week.\n\n---\n\n# ENS DAO Constitution\n\nThe ENS constitution is a set of binding rules that determine what governance actions are legitimate for the DAO to take.\n\nEach article has examples of permissible and non permissible actions. These examples are illustrative and should not be considered a binding part of the text of the constitution itself.\n\n## I. Name ownership shall not be infringed\n\nENS governance will not enact any change that infringes on the rights of ENS users to retain names they own, or unfairly discriminate against name owners’ ability to extend, transfer, or otherwise use their names.\n\n### **Examples**\n\n**Permissible**: ENS governance may enact a change affecting the registration or extension costs of all names based on transparent criteria such as length, as long as it pursues a goal outlined in this constitution.\n\n**Not Permissible**: ENS governance must not enact a change increasing or reducing the extension costs of a list of existing ENS names, as this would unfairly benefit or penalise a handpicked group.\n\n## II. Fees are primarily an incentive mechanism\n\nThe primary purpose of registration fees is as an incentive mechanism to prevent the namespace becoming overwhelmed with speculatively registered names. A secondary purpose is to provide enough revenue to the DAO to fund ongoing development and improvement of ENS. ENS governance will not enact any fee other than for these purposes.\n\n### **Examples**\n\n**Permissible**: ENS governance may increase the price of name registrations in order to address excessive speculative registrations induced by a price that is set too low, or because the current price is insufficient to fund ongoing ENS operations at a reasonable level.\n\n**Not Permissible**: ENS governance must not enact a change imposing a fee for claiming DNS domains inside ENS, because such a fee would be purely an income generating measure and not an incentive mechanism.\n\n## III. Income funds ENS and other public goods\n\nAny income generated to the ENS treasury is to be used first of all to ensure the long-term viability of ENS, and to fund continuing development and improvement of the ENS system. Funds that are not reasonably required to achieve this goal may be used to fund other public goods within web3 as ENS governance sees fit.\n\nENS governance will not allocate funds to a team or individual who does not commit to uphold the same principles outlined in this constitution in their use of the allocated funds.\n\n### **Examples**\n\n**Permissible**: ENS governance may offer grant funding for a public good unrelated to ENS or Ethereum, so long as doing so does not affect the long-term viability of ENS.\n\n**Not Permissible**: ENS governance must not use the funds to support projects that conflict with the goals of ENS.\n\n## IV. ENS Integrates with the global namespace\n\nIn order to facilitate making the most widely usable naming system, ENS aims to integrate with the legacy DNS naming system to the greatest extent possible without sacrificing decentralization of ENS. ENS governance will not enact changes that compromise ENS’s ability to do this.\n\n### **Examples**\n\n**Permissible**: ENS governance should grant control of a top-level domain to its owner in the DNS system on request.\n\n**Not permissible**: ENS governance must not create new top-level domains unless those domains have been granted to ENS by a DNS authority.\n\n## V. Amendments to this constitution by majority vote\n\nAny change may be made to this constitution only by two-thirds majority and at least 1% of all tokens participating.",
