      "title": "Borehole Water System with Solar Pump",
      "content": "**STORY BEHIND THE PROP** For years now people of Orudu (rural community) in Ogun state Nigeria lack clean water, the water used for domestic duties is Ogun state river water, and this dirty water allows serious diseases to occur.\n\n**Objective:** To establish a cost-effective and sustainable water supply by installing a borehole with a solar-powered pump. This prop aims to provide reliable access to clean water in areas facing water scarcity or inconsistent supply, while utilizing renewable solar energy to minimize operating costs and environmental impact.\n\n**Prop Overview:** This proposal involves drilling a borehole, installing a solar pump, and setting up basic infrastructure for water storage and distribution. Solar-powered pumps are ideal for remote or off-grid areas because they rely on renewable energy, reducing the need for electricity or fuel. Water will be stored in an elevated tank for easy distribution to the community.\n\nPICTURES OF THE LOCATION\n\n![InShot_20240912_2057289\n35](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HynKiREyyx.jpg)\n\nMore pictures about the community \n\n![InShot_20240912_170344500](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1ghaAEkJe.jpg)\n\nLOCATION ON GOOGLE MAP\n\n[https://maps.app.goo.gl/fF1s7CwwHAoq1TPf9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fF1s7CwwHAoq1TPf9)\n\n**To provide clean water for the Orudu community, this proposal will provide:**\n\n1. Bore hole :For extraction and supply and purification of the water through Chlorination. Chlorination is a chemical treatment method that introduces chlorine into borehole water to disinfect it. Chlorine effectively kills bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms, making the water safe for consumption. This method is especially important for borehole water intended for drinking or human use. It also helps control algae growth and addresses some taste and odor issues. \n2. Iron pole or concrete decking : for holding the weight of the water filled in the tank . \n3. Solar pump installation  : used to bring energy to power the pumping machine \n4. Tank : used for storing water. \n5. Tiles : For beautification \n6. Pipes : For conveyance of water \n\n*+ other materials like sand, cement, block and more.*\n\n**Training and Maintenance:**\n\n- Train community members on operating and maintaining the system. \n- Develop a maintenance plan for regular upkeep( handling over to the community leader after completion  for proper upkeep) \n\n**Impact of the Prop:**\n\n- Reliable Water Supply: The prop will provide a dependable source of clean water \n- Sustainability: Using solar energy lowers operating costs and promotes environmental sustainability. \n- Health Improvements: Access to clean water will help prevent waterborne illnesses.\n  ️Increased Productivity: By reducing time spent collecting water, community members can engage in education and economic activities. \n\n**Solar pump and solar panels**\n\n![pump](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByKrfER11e.jpg)\n![&lt;3](https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExYW5udjI0dnI3djBucjlybDRsc2Q0b2x5a2hvNzA0NTk1eTRsNzByciZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/VY0IsktdRC2uJ1WvU5/giphy.webp)\n\n**Budget** A total of $5500 will be needed to fund this prop .\n\n**Proliferation** Videos and photos will be provided.\n\n**Duration** 1-3 months \n\n**Team** @houseofdrey001\nLead Prop Writer\nOn the ground Lead Coordinator\nBSC Degree in Business Administration\nPart of the internatioNouns team\nHolder of Lil Nouns, gnars, nunouns, foodnouns.\n\n**Previous prop executed:**\n\n30 solar street light sponsored by lil nouns  [https://warpcast.com/houseofdrey/0x763d9950](https://warpcast.com/houseofdrey/0x763d9950)\n\n[https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/240](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/240)\n\n1 solar street light sponsored by /noc\n\n![InShot_20240809_232350479](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Syxjvldk1g.jpg)\n\n30 solar street light \n\n![InShot_20240911_092348498](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hkhvxl_JJx.jpg)\n\nJollé (2022-2024)\n\n![InShot_20240811_193618532](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H18mfl_1Jl.jpg)\n\nNouns Exercise book\n\n![InShot_20240811_201501094](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ry0Omxu1ke.jpg)",

      "content": "Proposing we delegate our Nouns to Lint Council to vote at Nouns. We have a higher average turnout than the Snapshot and we are open to having any Lil Nouns join the Council should they wish to do so.\n\nWe also vote at Lil Nouns so are a multi-DAO governance body (unsure if there are others in the Nouns eco doing the same?). This would reduce the burden of casting multiple multi-sig votes at Nouns if we vote as a singular body, as the same people are casting these votes on behalf of Lils already.\n\nIn conclusion, thought I would put this up to see what the DAO thinks as the last two snapshot votes were only joined by two individuals (holding a total of 10 Lil Nouns) with one of these individuals already being in the Council anyway and the other is more than welcome to join. I believe this change could lead to better representation of Lil Nouns at Nouns DAO and allow all voting for Nouns proposals to happen within our Discord which will likely lead to a higher turnout.\n\nThis change is obviously not permanent and can be switched up again in the future if we decide that Snapshot was the better solution.\n\nCheers\n\nLil P",

      "title": "Reduce Pool Size to Address Seeder Contract Limitations",
      "content": "The current Seeder contract relies on the \\`blockhash\\` function, which **only returns valid block hashes for the last 256 blocks**. When the block number exceeds this range, the function returns zero, making any randomness generated beyond 256 blocks ineffective. Despite the pool size being set to **1,000,000**, this limitation restricts the contract to effectively use only the most recent **256 blocks**, potentially leading to issues during minting if older blocks are used.\n\nTo address this, the proposal suggests **reducing the pool size from 1,000,000 to 256**, the maximum supported by the \\`blockhash\\` function. This ensures only valid block numbers are used for randomness, preventing minting errors caused by unsupported blocks. Aligning with the Seeder contract's current technical constraints will improve the reliability of the system.

      "content": "*Note: This is the exact same proposal as [Prop 250](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/250) which cannot be executed due to the treasury only having a balance of ~1.5 ETH. This proposal transfers stETH instead.*\n\n---\n## Objective \nThis proposal seeks funding for Lils to have an exciting, playful, and interactive presence at Nouns Town 2024 in Los Angeles. The initiatives outlined below will embody the vibrant, quirky, and fun nature of Lil Nouns, ensuring that attendees experience the essence of Lils and create fun nounish memories.\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/MHqt2BBN/nouns-world-globe.gif)\n\n## Why This Matters for Lil Nouns \nNouns Town 2024 is the perfect platform for Lil Nouns to make a splash and showcase its playful, inclusive vibe. By bringing interactive elements such as a take-home CC0 art gallery, live nounish caricatures, yard games, and engaging kendama activities, this event will give Lil Nouns a chance to stand out. This playful experience will reinforce Lil Nouns' unique character within the broader Nouniverse.\nInitiatives\n\n**1. Curate a CC0 Art Gallery**\nA gallery of curated CC0 art, which attendees will be able to claim and take home.  A variety of CC0 and nounish art will be curated and printed on high-quality paper, then displayed in the Nouns Town venue. When the event is over, the pieces will be made available for attendees to take home with them.\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/029XhTdj/artprogrambanner.png)\n\n**2. Nounish Caricatures and Vinyl Decals by Yonfrula**\nYonfrula, a talented nounish artist, will be brought in to create custom vinyl decals for attendees to use with heat presses in the maker space, allowing them to take home a piece of Lil Nouns with them. He will also do personalized nounish sketches during the event.\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/mkjjbrND/yonfrula.png)\n\n**3. Maker Space Kendamas**\nIn the spirit of hands-on fun, we will supply kendamas with unfinished tamas (the wooden ball) and let attendees unleash their creativity by customizing their own. \n![](https://i.postimg.cc/vZNPgcRx/blankdama.png)\n\n**4. Novelty Kendamas**\nWhat’s more playful than a kendama? How about a whole collection of novelty kendamas, including fun variations like the 5 spike, 6 cup, 10 cup, kaiju, sumo, and fuzzy kendamas!\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/gJ94k8vN/noveltydamas2.png)\n\n**5. Yard Games**\nWe will rent a few yard games for the day to place throughout the venue. These will include giant jenga, giant connect four, and giant pong.\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/5NcMVJM5/yardgames.png)\n\n**6. Lil Nouns Prizes**\nTo ramp up the fun even more, we will give away Lil Nouns as prizes for various mini games. We'll purchase Lil Nouns at auction so all of this ETH is returned to the DAO, then give away these Lil Nouns as prizes for various games during the event.\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/FHRWH06Q/lils.png)\n\n**7. Happy Hour with Builder DAO**\nBuilder DAO will be hosting a Happy Hour at Hotel Erwin on Tuesday 10/8, and then Builders and Bagels at Menotti's on Friday 10/12. The venues and food, as well as drinks during Bagel's and Builders, have been covered by Builder DAO Proposal 17, and we think it would be awesome for Lils to sponsor the happy hour and cover drinks so attendees can simply show up and have a good time.\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/DwXLXxkr/Hyt-Iqt-D30.png)\n\n---\n## Budget \n- CC0 Art Gallery: 0.75 ETH\n- Yonfrula Travel and Accommodation: 2 ETH\n- Novelty Kendamas and Maker Space Kendamas: 0.5 ETH\n-  Yard Games: 0.25 ETH\n- Lils for Giveaways: 1 ETH\n- Happy Hour with Builder DAO: 0.5 ETH\n- Project Management: 1 ETH\n- **Total: 6 ETH (5 ETH net after 1 ETH is returned to the treasury buying Lils)**\n\n## Why Fund This? \nLil Nouns thrives on creativity, community, and a sense of fun — all of which this proposal will bring to life at Nouns Town 2024. From the playful kendama activities to the take-home CC0 art gallery and live art, this event will encapsulate everything that makes Lil Nouns special. By funding this proposal, Lil Nouns will be supporting a unique opportunity to engage with the wider Nouniverse, making a memorable impression that draws more people into Lil Nouns.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/G3xqPMwC/getfunded.gif)\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "An experiment in Nounish retail with two, eight-unit sunglasses displays, each placed in an owner-managed independent coffee shop in lower Manhattan.\n\nCustom wooden displays will be purchased with the unicode glasses logo engraved top center and “Independent eyewear for the public good” top left. “Powered by Nouns & Lil Nouns!” will be engraved top right, and the “nouns.wtf” and “lilnouns.wtf” websites will be engraved bottom left and right.\n\nThe displays will feature high quality sunglasses purchased at wholesale from popular emerging brands like Quay (California), Le Specs (Australia), Izipizi (France), Komono (Belgium), Randolph (Massachusetts), and Chimi (Sweden) -- brands that are independent of the Sunglass Hut/Luxottica monopoly, a conglomerate that crafts the illusion of variety while raising prices and lowering quality.\n\nAs an experiment in small-scale, NYC-based Nounish retail, I will establish relationships with two independent coffee shop owners to host consignment-based sunglasses displays for the public good. Any sales will be transparently shared in a public airtable. Revenues will be collected by the shop owners and can be split with the DAO to cover the cost of goods.\n\nThe coffee shop owner may decide to maintain or abandon operation depending on sales, but no matter the results, the two Nounish displays will serve as marketing installations for the DAO at two highly foot-trafficked NYC coffee shops. If sales are meaningful, the inventory can be replenished and expansion to more coffee shops becomes possible.\n\n.33 ETH will purchase two custom displays (~$200) and 16 units of eyewear (~$600).\n\nMy Background:\n- Four years of retail planning with the Macy’s Buying & Planning executive team. Worked above the NYC Herald Square flagship store on a small team of buyers to assort a $250 million/year men’s fashion business across all 500+ stores.\n- Eight years operating my own e-commerce store to promote and cross-sell small and emerging independent eyewear brands alongside leading designers. Shipped and delivered with free returns more than 100k units of eyewear to tens of thousands of customers around the world.\n- Managed my own brick & mortar store in the World Trade Center Oculus to promote emerging brands with leading designers.\n- Two years of @lilnouners visual media curation funded by [Proposal 190](https://www.instagram.com/lilnouners)\n\nThank you ⌐◨-◨\n\n![https://zora.co/collect/zora:0xfce8aefbb8d4f222e8eefdf7f94521a92a93f026/3?referrer=0x887d3169f448347431a913abf816feea2bcb0bdf](https://media.decentralized-content.com/-/rs:fit:1920:1920/aHR0cHM6Ly9tYWdpYy5kZWNlbnRyYWxpemVkLWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2lwZnMvYmFmeWJlaWFrZG93NWs0dGM1ZTY2NGViYWFtZHBrbWdoNnFncWozaG0yNzI2YXFnZTQ3Nzdhd3A0MmU)",

      "title": "Lils Booth and Kendama Activation at NFT Brasil 2024",
      "content": "**TLDR:**  We propose an immersive, hands-on activation at NFT Brasil, held in São Paulo at the Bienal Pavilion. This event will introduce over 5,000 students and more than 20,000 attendees to Web3 and Lil Nouns through kendama, a traditional Japanese wooden toy, alongside various Nounish Web3 onboarding experiences. Kendama’s simplicity makes it an ideal way to introduce those with no Web3 knowledge to how an on-chain collective can create lasting, real-world impact and inspire a new approach to community building.\n\n- **[Check out this highlight reel from our last activation in Toronto!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEkgh7KJv0o)**\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/j20JHyL3/1.gif)\n\n---\n\n# **Overview:**\n\nNFT Brasil is one of the most impactful NFT and Web3 event in Latin America and we want Lil Nouns to be a standout part of the event! Set in the iconic Bienal Pavilion and scheduled for September 12 and 13, 2024, our activation will engage attendees across five key areas: the NFT Exhibition, Speaker Sessions, Lounge, Metaverse, and Street Gallery.\n\nThis event provides the perfect platform to connect the digital and physical worlds. By introducing kendama, we’ll offer a unique, hands-on experience that bridges these two realms.\n\nParticipants will learn how to play kendama, guided by principles from the **Mindfulness Through Play** programs,  which teach the benefits of a growth mindset, mindfulness, and emotional regulation. This playful interaction will be seamlessly integrated with onchain education, using platforms like Token8.life (launching imminently) and Nounspace.com to showcase how creativity and community can thrive onchain.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/sg6QnkMh/2.jpg)\n\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/MKYjBMxt/3.png)\n\n---\n\n# **Objectives:**\n\n## 1. Lil Nouns Presence: A ⌐◨-◨ Showcase \nAlthough the Nouniverse has grown, many people at crypto conferences are still unfamiliar with Nouns, and even fewer know about Lil Nouns. These events present a prime opportunity for spreading awareness, as most attendees already have a basic understanding of blockchain and wallets. Our custom booth will capture the fun and creativity of Lil Nouns, demonstrating how decentralized communities can make a real-world impact through play and innovation. Throughout the event, teams from Nounish projects will be present (Kendama DAO, PlayDNA, etc), onboarding attendees and discussing proposals, governance, and the unique process of proposing to a community treasury.\n\n- **Live Auctions:** We’ll guide attendees through the Lil Nouns auction process, helping them select and mint their favorite Lil Nouns right on the spot.\n- **Panels and Discussions:** Lil Nouns representatives will lead discussions on decentralized governance, the use of NFTs to fund public goods, and how playful activations like kendama can build new connections and raise awareness of Web3’s potential for positive change. Teams behind current Brazil-based projects will also be present to help spread the word.\n- **Nounspace Launch:** We’ll celebrate the launch of Nounspace's $SPACE launch on September 12th at our booth. Attendees will explore the platform, learning about its features and future roadmap. We’ll also share insights into the project’s origins and its connection to Nouns, ensuring a smooth onboarding experience.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/50vX2jnB/4.png)\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/qvM6xJvr/5.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Kendama Activation: Education Through Play**\n\nIn a space dominated by digital media and screens, the quirky wooden kendama toy stands out, offering a unique way to capture attention and engage attendees. It serves as an ideal icebreaker, inviting genuine play before transitioning into more complex topics.\n\nKendama, with its deep cultural roots, is more than just a game—it’s a tool for teaching essential life skills. At our booth and throughout the venue, attendees will have the chance to learn how to land their first spike, experiencing the same lessons taught in schools through the Mindfulness Through Play programs. These lessons, which focus on areas like concentration, growth mindset, and emotional regulation, create an engaging entry point for discussions on Web3 and decentralized communities.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/mZyrXvqg/6.gif)\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/8cNzk4FG/7.gif)\n\n---\n\n## 3. **Web3 Onboarding: Connecting Physical Play to the Digital World**  \n\nToken8.life, a new Web3 platform rooted in the Nouns ecosystem, will be a key component of the kendama activation. Attendees will engage with the platform, which is a fork of [Vrbs](https://vrbs.build/), where they'll upload any media to the interactive contests and learn about NFTs, wallets, and governance in a fun, pressure-free environment. We’ll also introduce Lil Nouns as an accessible entry point into the Nouns ecosystem for those with ambitious ideas. We’ll guide attendees on how to get involved, how auctions work, and even onboard new members right at the booth!\n\n- Lil Playground Contest: Kids will create Lil Nouns in the [Playground](https://lilnouns.wtf/playground) and enter them into a \"Content for Governance\" game contest. This demonstrates that Web3 isn’t just for experts - it’s for everyone.\n- Kendama Contest: Attendees can submit videos of their best kendama tricks via Token8.life, with contest winners receiving rewards in ETH, effectively linking physical play with the digital world.\n\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/52Ry58r5/8.png)\n\n---\n\n# Team\n\n- [Kendama DAO](https://nouns.build/dao/base/0xd7D40E5AFceAbC923B70dD299206155Fb330f5Ff)\n    - [Satori](https://warpcast.com/0xsatori)\n    - [Joshua flow Grove](https://warpcast.com/joshuaflowgrove)\n    - [Gabriel Klemm](https://warpcast.com/gksweets)\n    - [poox](https://warpcast.com/poox)\n- [NFT Brasil](https://nftbrasil.live/) and Token8.life\n    - [Bob Burnquist](https://warpcast.com/bobburnquist)\n\n\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/xT9X9fHm/9.jpg)\n\n\n---\n\n# **Budget Breakdown:**\n- **Booth Setup and Design:** 4 ETH\n  Includes the cost of a custom-built booth space equipped with a screen displaying Nounish art, live Lil Nouns auctions, and area for playing kendama and engaging with the community. This also covers Noggles branding in event communication channels, including social media, the event's metaverse, street art posters, and various Nounish coordinated efforts, such as graffiti art.\n- **Team and Operations:** 2 ETH  \n  Covers a dedicated team to lead kendama lessons, manage contests, discuss Lil Nouns, and handle event logistics. The [PlayDNA](https://x.com/playdna_) team will also be present to represent Nouns, providing information and onboarding assistance.\n- **Kendamas:** 1 ETH  \n  Covers the purchase and transport of 100 kendamas to Brazil.\n- **Content Creation and Documentation:** 0.5 ETH  \n  Professional photography and videography to capture the activation for post-event marketing and content distribution.\n- **Travel:** 2.75 ETH  \n  Travel and accommodation expenses for 2 team members.\n- **Contingency:** 0.75 ETH  \n  A reserve fund to cover any unexpected costs or additional expenses.\n- **Total:** **11 ETH**\n\n\n---\n\n# **Conclusion:**\n\nThis proposal combines the playful spirit of kendama with the innovative potential of Web3, creating an engaging experience that connects thousands of attendees with Lil Nouns. Through play, we’ll educate and onboard hundreds of attendees, expanding awareness of Lil Nouns' mission and inviting more people to join our community. Let’s create an unforgettable experience at NFT Brasil!\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/xdNC6crw/10.gif)\n",

We seek to increase participation in the governance of Lil Nouns with the delegation campaign through educational content about Lil Nouns DAO.\n\nThis year, we have seen new builders from LatAm participating in the auctions, which is a positive sign of the work we have done.\n\n![lilamigos](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H15tUB6s0.jpg)\n\n\nIntroducing our delegates for the second season (in addition to co-founders leobunster and lil amigos), they are active builders with public profiles on X and Farcaster.:\n\n- @0xtixter\n- @NFTMami\n- @fattybuthappy\n- @0xyehz\n- @DnznJuan\n- @feru0x\n\nThis third phase aims to increase participation in governance through group voting, via the Discord channel (#lil-amigos-votes), and a public channel for discussing proposals and ideas (lil-amigos-chat). Our goal is to reach 40 Lil Nouns delegates to advance to the next phase and keep the community updated on what’s happening in the lil nouniverse.\n\n\nWe will create a delegate token to automatically claim the role.\n\n## Bringing the next 100 builders to Lil Nouns DAO\nLil Amigos will bring the next 100 creative builders to Lil Nouns DAO\n\nThrough discussions with communities such as Pulso Media-NounsAmigos, we have explored the best way to measure the impact of an onboarding proposal. In this case, we have made a table that we will explain.\n\n![onchain_impact_metrics](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1szbLpiC.jpg)\n\nGiven the broad scope of Lil Nouns, there are several areas of focus (delegations, voting, chat discussions, make props, original artworks, among others). In the table, we have outlined an \"onchain\" traceability to evaluate the effectiveness of our campaign, sharing our strategy and the metrics we aim to achieve. If the table shows an increase after the campaign, it will indicate that we are on the right track.\n\n## Content\n\nAs outlined in our prop 185, once we complete the educational content of \"Lil Nouns from 0,\" we aim to continuously discuss the proposals made with Lil Nouns. Our focus will be on the current state of Lil Nouns, with the goal of evolve projects.\n\n\n![lilkimmy](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bkeg-IaoA.jpg)\n\n\nAs mentioned before in \"Nounticias del Nouniverso\" Show:\n\n- Lil Nouns expansion on Farcaster\n- Lil Nouns joins $NOGS party\n- Lil Nouns updating the auction mechanism to VRGDA\n\n\nWith this proposal, Lil Nouns will be announced as the official sponsor of Plaza Nouns, with four months of content:\n\n- Mentions in all Xpaces news, with a call to action to join the Lil Nouns Discord\n- Creation of a series of comics with 8 episodes, created by Kimmydeuk on Base\n- Monthly video livestreams with recaps of the Lil Nouns ecosystem\n- Showcase of the Lil Nouns brand at over 8 meetups - \"LatAm on Farcaster\"\n- Testing art contests\n\n## Past Deliverables\n\nHere we add examples of deliverables and previous content:\n\n![lilvolcanofotos](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1yiZLTo0.jpg)\n[Video Party in EL Salvador](https://x.com/Pizza_DAO/status/1770908205805171175)\n[Photo album Lil Volcano and ETHLATAM](https://www.flickr.com/photos/leobunster/albums/72177720319708015/)\n[Lil Nouns thread in Spanish](https://x.com/lilnounsamigos/status/1822406564935790675)\n[Informative thread in Spanish](https://x.com/PlazaNouns/status/1823109822168043653)\n[Lil Amigos POAPs collection](https://collections.poap.xyz/lil-nouns/879)\n[Lil Comic on Base](https://zora.co/collect/base:0xc4f7bf73011cc9dbf4f4227faacdc4b7d955316e/1)\n[Lil presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RKnSMXInNi-mkV64VpSt6NRcf5XkZ3i_/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114771547370525481904&rtpof=true&sd=true)\n\n## Budget\nThe following table shows the estimated budget in USDc and ETH (1 ETH = 2500 USD).

      "content": "### Overview of the Proposal\n\nI am seeking **4 ETH** to develop and expand community tools for Lil Nouns through **Lil Nouns Lab** over a **3-month** period, with a **primary focus** on integrating and enhancing our presence on **Farcaster**. Farcaster has emerged as a key platform for our community, showing significant potential for engagement and growth. By concentrating our efforts here, we can leverage its unique capabilities to **build tools** that strengthen our community and support ongoing Lil Nouns initiatives.\n\n*The initial proposal requested ****6.9 ETH**** to cover the development and expansion efforts. However, due to current budgetary constraints and market conditions, the request has been reduced to ****4 ETH****. This reduction reflects both a decrease in scope to accommodate the whales enforcement and ensure stability in funding.*\n\n### Why Focus on Farcaster?\n\n**Farcaster** has become a **crucial hub** for Lil Nouners, with over **700 verified wallets** connected to the platform, representing a third of all [Lil Noun holders](https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0x4b10701Bfd7BFEdc47d50562b76b436fbB5BdB3B). The **engagement levels** on Farcaster are high, making it the **ideal platform** to focus our community-building efforts. By prioritizing Farcaster, we can effectively **nurture our existing community**, **re-engage inactive members**, and create tools that **enhance interactions and participation**.\n\n![Lil Nouners on Farcaster](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWBoxUSko1JDfb6Ks282hYYigGNQcoV7WRqqDqe6qoYio/)\n\n### Achievements and Progress Made\n\nThis initiative has been **self-funded** and **retroactive since year-to-date**. Despite the lack of prior funding, significant progress has been made, including:\n\n- **Development of bots, channel automations, and tools**, with some already open-sourced and more to come. \n- **Thousands of views** driven to our frontend, verified by Google Analytics and UTM link results. \n- Launch of **DC-based tools**, which have already shown a significant impact. \n\nThese efforts have led to nearly **doubling monthly voter turnout** compared to late 2023, demonstrating the **effectiveness** of our approach on Farcaster.\n\n![Lil Nouns Notification on Farcaster](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWGfBAkMihd8QR2HWFZ5jsCqDaK2CMhwktpnoMqBGdLDE/)\n\n### Planned Deliverables and Next Steps\n\nWith **Farcaster** as our **primary focus**, the planned deliverables over the next **3 months** include:\n\n- A fully operational version of DC-based tools, plus **a dashboard token gated for Lil Nouners**, and for Lil Nouns events, tailored to Farcaster's platform. \n- Development of **Farcaster frames**, **token-gated features**, and **automated tools** using Farcaster's infrastructure to **enhance user access, engagement, and interactions**. \n- **Providing technical support** to other Lil Nouns initiatives on Farcaster during this period to ensure seamless integration and success of ongoing and new projects. \n\n*Due to the budget reduction, the development of the ****VRGDA auction frame**** and the ****open-source automation framework**** for Lil Nouns channels on Farcaster has been postponed for future phases.*\n\n### Expected Outcomes and Impact\n\n- **Increased engagement and activity** within the Lil Nouns community on Farcaster, measured by growth in active users and interaction frequency. \n- **Boosted voter turnout** with sustained improvements in participation rates. \n- Enhanced **tool adoption and usage** among community members, leading to more efficient interactions and positive feedback for new tools. \n- Expanded reach, with growth in the number of active Lil Nouners and **re-engagement of inactive members**, measured by an increase in verified Lil Nouners and retention of members. \n\n### Conclusion and Final Thoughts\n\nFocusing our community-building efforts on **Farcaster** is a **strategic choice** driven by the platform's significant potential and current high engagement levels. This funding will enable the Lil Nouns Lab to **sustain and expand these efforts** over the next **3 months**, ensuring our community remains **vibrant and engaged**. I appreciate the community's continued support and am confident that, with this funding, we can achieve even greater success together.",

We aim to create collabs with communities like we have done with PurpleDAO, Base, and other nounish subcommunities. (ex. the ‘Latam en Farcaster’ poster by messhup )\n\nIn total, we will produce 16 POAPs for this season:\n- 2 for the ETHMX events\n- 1 general POAP for Lil Bricks\n- 9 for Farcaster events in LatAm\n- 4 for livestreams\n\n## Lil Amigos: Delegation campaign III\n\nLil Nouns Amigos is the Spanish and Latin American Lil Nouns community. We seek to increase participation in the governance of Lil Nouns with the delegation campaign through educational content about Lil Nouns DAO.\n\nThis year, we have seen new builders from LatAm participating in the auctions, which is a positive sign of the work we have done.\n\n![lilamigos](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkHfBUHoA.jpg)\n\nIntroducing our delegates for the second season (in addition to co-founders leobunster and lil amigos),  they are active builders with public profiles on X and Farcaster.:\n\n- @0xtixter\n- @NFTMami\n- @fattybuthappy\n- @0xyehz\n- @DnznJuan\n\nThis third phase aims to increase participation in governance through group voting, via the Discord channel (#lil-amigos-votes), and a public channel for discussing proposals and ideas (lil-amigos-chat). Our goal is to reach 40 Lil Nouns delegates to advance to the next phase and keep the community updated on what’s happening in the lil nouniverse.\n\n- Our profile in Lil Camp: [https://lilnouns.camp/voters/lilnounsamigos.eth](https://lilnouns.camp/voters/lilnounsamigos.eth)\n\nWe will create a delegate token to automatically claim the role.\n\n## Bringing the next 100 builders to Lil Nouns DAO\n\nLil Amigos will bring the next 100 creative builders to Lil Nouns DAO \n\nThrough discussions with communities such as Pulso Media-NounsAmigos, we have explored the best way to measure the impact of an onboarding proposal. In this case, we have made a table that we will explain.\n\n![table_onchain_metrics](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJ9uPDIsA.jpg)\n\nGiven the broad scope of Lil Nouns, there are several areas of focus (delegations, voting, chat discussions, make props, original artworks, among others). In the table, we have outlined an \"onchain\" traceability to evaluate the effectiveness of our campaign, sharing our strategy and the metrics we aim to achieve. If the table shows an increase after the campaign, it will indicate that we are on the right track.\n\n## Content\n\nAs outlined in our prop 185, once we complete the educational content of \"Lil Nouns from 0,\" we aim to continuously discuss the proposals made with Lil Nouns. Our focus will be on the current state of Lil Nouns, with the goal of evolve projects.\n\n![lilartworks](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H10O988j0.jpg)\nAs mentioned before in \"Nounticias del Nouniverso\" show:\n\n- Lil Nouns expansion on Farcaster\n- Lil Nouns joins $NOGS party\n- Lil Nouns updating the auction mechanism to VRGDA\n\nWith this proposal, Lil Nouns will be announced as the official sponsor of Plaza Nouns, with four months of content:\n\n- Mentions in all Xpaces news, with a call to action to join the Lil Nouns Discord \n- Creation of a series of comics with 8 episodes, created by Kimmydeuk on Base\n- Monthly video livestreams with recaps of the Lil Nouns ecosystem\n- Showcase of the Lil Nouns brand at over 8 meetups \"LatAm on Farcaster\"\n- Testing art contests \n\n## Past Deliverables\n\n![lilvolcanopics](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJh8cMHiC.jpg)\nHere we add examples of deliverables and previous content:\n[Video Party in EL Salvador](https://x.com/Pizza_DAO/status/1770908205805171175)\n[Photo album Lil Volcano and ETHLATAM](https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjBEkFe)\n[Lil Nouns thread in Spanish](https://x.com/lilnounsamigos/status/1822406564935790675)\n[Informative thread in Spanish](https://x.com/PlazaNouns/status/1823109822168043653)\n[Lil Amigos POAPs collection](https://collections.poap.xyz/lil-nouns/879)\n[Lil Comic on Base](https://zora.co/collect/base:0xc4f7bf73011cc9dbf4f4227faacdc4b7d955316e/1)\n[Lil presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RKnSMXInNi-mkV64VpSt6NRcf5XkZ3i_/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114771547370525481904&rtpof=true&sd=true)\n\n## Budget\n\nThe following table shows the estimated budget in USDc and ETH (1 ETH = 2500 USD).

      "title": "Enhancing Lil Nouns Through Community Tools",
      "content": "### Overview of the Proposal\n\nI am seeking **6.9 ETH** to develop and expand community tools for Lil Nouns, with a **primary focus** on integrating and enhancing our presence on **Farcaster**. Farcaster has emerged as a key platform for our community, showing significant potential for engagement and growth. By concentrating our efforts here, we can leverage its unique capabilities to **build tools** that strengthen our community and support ongoing Lil Nouns initiatives.\n\nThis request is **modest** and reflects **substantial retroactive work** and a **proven track record** of delivering impactful tools. Despite a **30% drop in the fiat value** since the initial proposal, I have not adjusted the funding request, demonstrating my commitment to delivering value. Approximately **10-20%** of the budget is allocated to necessary infrastructure and services, which is based on fiat value and **could increase considering current market conditions**.\n\n### Why Focus on Farcaster?\n\n**Farcaster** has become a **crucial hub** for Lil Nouners, with over **700 verified wallets** connected to the platform, representing a third of all [Lil Noun holders](https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0x4b10701Bfd7BFEdc47d50562b76b436fbB5BdB3B). The **engagement levels** on Farcaster are high, making it the **ideal platform** to focus our community-building efforts. By prioritizing Farcaster, we can effectively **nurture our existing community**, **re-engage inactive members**, and create tools that **enhance interactions and participation**.\n\n![](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWBoxUSko1JDfb6Ks282hYYigGNQcoV7WRqqDqe6qoYio/ \"Lil Nouners on Farcaster\")\n\n### Achievements and Progress Made\n\nThis initiative has been **self-funded** and **retroactive since year-to-date**. Despite the lack of prior funding, significant progress has been made, including:\n\n- **Development of bots, channel automations, and tools**, with some already open-sourced and more to come. \n- **Thousands of views** driven to our frontend, verified by Google Analytics and UTM link results. \n- Launch of **DC-based tools**, which have already shown a significant impact. \n\nThese efforts have led to nearly **doubling monthly voter turnout** compared to late 2023, demonstrating the **effectiveness** of our approach on Farcaster.\n\n![](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWGfBAkMihd8QR2HWFZ5jsCqDaK2CMhwktpnoMqBGdLDE/ \"Lil Nouns Notification on Farcaster\")\n\n### Planned Deliverables and Next Steps\n\nWith **Farcaster** as our **primary focus**, the planned deliverables include:\n\n- A fully operational version of **DC-based tools** for Lil Nouns events, tailored to Farcaster's platform. \n- A **VRGDA auction frame** for accessing auctions directly through Farcaster. \n- An **open-source automation framework** for Lil Nouns channels on Farcaster, customizable based on each channel's needs. \n- Development of **token-gated features** and **automated tools** using Farcaster's infrastructure to **enhance user access, engagement, and interactions**. \n\n### Expected Outcomes and Impact\n\n- **Increased engagement and activity** within the Lil Nouns community on Farcaster, measured by growth in active users and interaction frequency. \n- **Boosted voter turnout** with sustained improvements in participation rates. \n- Enhanced **tool adoption and usage** among community members, leading to more efficient interactions and positive feedback for new tools. \n- Expanded reach, with growth in the number of active Lil Nouners and **re-engagement of inactive members**, measured by an increase in verified Lil Nouners and retention of members. \n- **Ongoing development and maturation of open-source tools**, fostering innovation and collaboration, evidenced by the release and adoption of new open-source projects and community collaboration. \n\n### Conclusion and Final Thoughts\n\nFocusing our community-building efforts on **Farcaster** is a **strategic choice** driven by the platform's significant potential and current high engagement levels. This funding will enable the Lil Nouns Lab to **sustain and expand these efforts**, ensuring our community remains **vibrant and engaged**. I appreciate the community's continued support and am confident that, with this funding, we can achieve even greater success together.",

      "content": "I made an error in the previous proposal tx, this prop aims to change the pool size from 4 to 1,000,000.\n\nThis means that people coming to mint a lil could have a much wider variety to choose from, it doesn't necessarily need to be changed in lilnouns.wtf UI. I checked with Rocketman about changing the pool size and he said no technical reason that would make it not work as far as he knows.\n\nI think this change in pool size will = more mints, essentially allows us to run our own opensea-style marketplace selling 1000s of Lils but all funds go direct to treasury. Will actually be way better than Opensea or any other secondary market due to dynamic price + massive variety changing every 12 seconds.\n\nThe higher the pool size, the more aesthetic lils we can mint, so I've gone high. Cheers and I hope people agree this change could be cool and will ultimately help people mint their dream lil noun.\n\n![](https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZXQweHR3a3VpNmVlb3MwYTF4cnM5c2hwNTNsejdwNTYxYXRvcDlucSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/LZ6GnZ1wlsgfjSNABL/giphy.webp)",

      "content": "# Lil Poker: a fun way to proliferate Lils\n\ntl:dr - new approach to proliferating Lil Nouns via a streamed poker game utilizing Poker Now and GM Farcaster Network to reach a wider audience for Lil Nouns and support builders by creating a new platform for amplification. This approach seeks to:\n* promote Lil Nouns with visual branding and showing the auction during the show hopefully leading to increased auction participation\n* provide new benefits to holding a Lil Noun such as an opportunity to promote Lil Nouners' projects/props \n* a community touch point for announcements as well as a fun interaction\n\n![custom poker table](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1ShUX9vC.png)\n\nAs the Lil Nouns Show reaches the end of their current run, Nounish Prof had an idea to increase reach with a fresh approach: have the hosts play poker while covering the market report and interviewing builders. \n\nLil Poker will be a weekly streamed poker game using PokerNow.com and GM Farcaster Network's Streamyard and socials to expand Lil Nouns amplification. 4 regular cohosts will play each week alongside up to 6 other selected players, all of which MUST hold a Lil Noun to play. The game/interview show will be streamed live on The Lil Nouns Show Twitter, GM Farcaster YouTube, and GM Farcaster's Unlonley channel (as well as guest socials if they want) and will be dropped after as an NFT podcast on Zora, as well as GM Farcaster's podcast streams/RSS.\n\nEach player will have a buy in of 1000 $nogs with the winning player taking the full 10000 $nogs as the prize. For this initial run, Prof will cover the buy in. We are also budgeting for one Lil Noun as part of the prize pool, selecting the Lil Noun from the new vrgda buy now at the beginning of the show. Additional prizes may be built into game play. (working on other sponsorship/additional prize pool). The real prize of course is bragging rights.\n\n## Run of Show\n\nThe show will take the place of The Lil Nouns Show and will run weekly on Wednesdays at 5:30 pm ET tentatively starting August 21 for initial 6 week run. \n* 5:30pm: Intro video roll on Streamyard with Lil Nouns branding/sponsor info (Prof)\n* 5:31: Intro by English; welcome players (English)\n* 5:35: Kick off Lil Nouns auction (Prof)\n* 5:40: Market Report & discussion (Hudah et al)\n* 6:00: Whatcha Building? Highlight Lil Nouner projects (Prof et al)\n* 6:15: Lil Nouns props and announcements (Cardno)\n* 6:25: Final hand, winner declared\n* 6:27: Wrap-up and POAP (Cardno/Prof)\n* 6:30: Closing Credits video roll (Prof)\n\n## Players/Team\n\n4 regular cohosts will play each week and will manage the show flow and provide the content:\n\n* Prof Werder\n* English\n* Cardno\n* Hudah\n\n6 additional players will be selected to play each week by applying via a [token-gated Deform ](https://app.deform.cc/form/2bcaae3e-a3df-47e8-95ac-7c272ae0bdd1)with preference given to holders who are building in web3. Players must hold a Lil Noun to apply. These seats will rotate and the team will be doing guest outreach and booking to ensure an entertaining and interesting group of players. This will be streamed so preference may be given to players who are willing to go on camera but anon/pfp audio only will be an option.\n\n## Mechanics\n\nUsing PokerNow.club plus account (Prof) we'll be able to customize the table with Lil Nouns branding as seen in the image above. The show will be streamed using Streamyard (GM Farcaster/Prof) which allows for streaming to multiple destinations at the same time so we'll be on Twitter, YouTube and could also stream into the Lil Nouns Discord at the same time allowing for a wider audience. A pre-roll video with Lil Nouns sponsor info and a closing credits video will start and end the show.\n\nThe show will be recorded automatically via Streamyard and dropped as an NFT on Zora as well as web2 distribution in the GM Farcaster podcast stream as bonus episodes, with the recording appearing on Spotify, Apple etc. The live stream will also automatically remain on Twitter and YouTube for future viewing.\n\nLil Nouners who want to play will apply here (open now): https://app.deform.cc/form/2bcaae3e-a3df-47e8-95ac-7c272ae0bdd1\n\nThe core team of cohosts will select the players and try to create a mix of builders in the Lil Nouns ecosystem.\n\nThis will start as an 6 week experiment to work out the details and iterate where necessary. Prize Pool will be held at LilPoker.eth. The final week will be a championship game of the winners from the other 5 weeks.\n\n## GM Farcaster production and promotion of show\n\nGM Farcaster Network will produce and distribute the show utilizing our tools and distribution network. GM Farcaster (founded and hosted by @nounishprof and @adrienne) is a morning news show highlighting news from the Farcaster ecosystem, streaming three times a week, as well as producing other shows including the recent CastOut Survivor inspired competition show. GM Farcaster began in September 2023 and has been steadily growing its audience and has launched a media network to highlight other creators in the Farcaster ecosystem. Sponsors have included Pinata, Matcha.xyz, Dynamic and Bolide. GM Farcaster also streamed episode 100 from FarCon with Farcaster cofounders @dwr and @v. \n\nSee GM Farcaster's Warpcast channel for more info: https://warpcast.com/~/channel/gmfarcaster \n\nIn addition to producing the Lil Poker show, GM Farcaster will promote the show on Wednesday mornings by integrating Lil Nouns as a 6 week Wednesday sponsor so that Lil Nouns branding will be prominent on GM Farcaster throughout the Lil Poker Show run. This sponsorship will be complimentary for this 6 week run only as part of the production fee.\n\n\n\n## Additional possible integrations/sponsorships\n\nProf is in discussions with the Bracket.Game team to create a bracket for Lil Poker for the final game that would allow for free packs to Lil Nouns holders and opportunity to back your favorite player. (tentative -- more info if secured) \n\nIn addition, other sponsorships will be sought to add to the prize pool or audience giveaways each week or to purchase additional Lil Nouns on auction as audience giveaways. (e.g. if a channel like /tabletop wants to promote on the show, they donate a hypersub subscription in exchange; or if Gloom or Pluto Cats wanted to sponsor, an nft could be donated). \n\nWe'll also run an art contest using rounds.wtf in the new /lilpoker channel to help promote the show with the team selecting one of the top 3 as the show cover art. \n\n## What do we hope to accomplish?\n\nDuring this initial 6 week run, we'll measure success on multiple fronts:\n* Grow /lilpoker and /lilnounsdao Warpcast channels and @lilnouns account with a goal of 10% increase in channel and profile followers during the 6 week run.\n* Auctions: we hope to see a 10% increase in auction activity during this time period. (10% more than 2024 average)\n\nThese targets are manageable but stretch goals will be 20% increase in auctions/secondary sales.\n\nIn addition, we believe the biggest benefit will come to builders in the Lil Nouns ecosystem, providing them another proliferation opportunity and hopefully activitating inactive Lil Nouns builders who may see this opportunity as a benefit to getting more active in the DAO. Plus the art contest at kick off should provide additional proliferation as well as an opportunity for artists to get involved.\n\n\n## Budget\n\n**Show Hosts and Management - total 3 ETH:** \nThe 4 weekly hosts (Prof, English, Cardno, Hudah) will distribute .5 eth weekly via coordinape or similar mechanic amongst the team members participating that week to produce the content for the show. Funds will be held in a multi-sig.\n\n**Show Production and promotion by GM Farcaster Network: 3 ETH (2 ETH per month for 1.5 months)** Production includes streaming of the show; creation of video pre-roll and credits; securing lilpoker.eth; securing and management of [/lilpoker Warpcast channel](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/lilpoker); management of prize pool; promotion of show; post show production of recordings and NFT distribution; podcast distribution.\n\n**Lil Nouns auction - 1 ETH** to acquire a Lil Noun on auction during each show which will be given to the winner of the game and provide a demo of the new VRDGA auction. If the winner of the game if one of the 4 team members, the Lil Noun will be given to an audience member (via POAP raffle). This budget is set at 6 Lil Nouns @ .15 ETH plus gas but should these auctions go for less, any remaining funds will be returned to the treasury. \n\n**Lil Poker art round - 1 ETH:** to kick off the show, an art contest will kick off in /lilpoker using rounds.wtf with a .4 rounds pool and additional .1 eth to 6 winners selected by the team from the top 10 for the show's cover art and POAPs.\n\n## Total Funding Request: 8 ETH\n\nSummary of Transactions:\n3 ETH to multi-sig safe for weekly host distributions:\neth:0xe3D25d0E901C033342BCf93d759186F72797Be18\n\n3 ETH to GMFarcasterNetwork.eth at: \n0x96BE08fd17922C525CB6C66F872D1e44f0D07f16\n\n2 ETH to LilPoker.eth for Lil Nouns auction and rounds.wtf art round:\n0xf050FdAc435B08a0798c583C4c949b89FC256A02\n\n\n![lilpoker green](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Byvn_Nqw0.png)\n\n\n",

      "content": "This prop aims to change the pool size (hopefully) from 4 to 100,000.\n\nThis means that people coming to mint a lil could have a much wider variety to choose from, it doesn't necessarily need to be changed in lilnouns.wtf UI. I checked with Rocketman about changing the pool size and he said no technical reason afaik.\n\nI think this change in pool size will = more mints, essentially allows us to run our own opensea-style marketplace selling 1000s of Lils but all funds go direct to treasury. Will actually be way better than Opensea or any other secondary market due to dynamic price + massive variety changing every 12 seconds.\n\nCheers and I hope people agree this change could be cool.\n\n![](https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExenVxaWhkNW13ZmNldXozam5iOG9rOWl2N2poMmxyMzI3N3BnNHE3eSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/WIqSM6xmTcq7tiGznZ/giphy.gif)\n\n",

      "title": "Lil Nouns Speedcubing Tournament & Team",
      "content": "![Summary](https://i.ibb.co/Tmj985c/Slide1.png \"Summary\")\n\nSpeedcubing is the practice of solving Rubik's cubes as quickly as possible across various categories. This competitive activity has gained worldwide popularity, taking root even in Central American youths who find in it a way to better themselves and share with others.\n\nSince the purpose is to gather as many young people as possible and to include them into the community, all the competitions are non-profit. This means that the budget for each event is collected through competitor entry fees and the sale of cubes and equipment through BeKubes, the official speedcubing body in Costa Rica.\n\nThe whole community took a major hit during the 2020 pandemic. Finding fitting and secure venues was increasingly difficult, practically all events had to be cancelled, there was not as much money for people to buy cubes or equipment, and manufacturers had to face more and more setbacks to deliver products to the community. \n\nThis proposal seeks **10 ETH** from the Lil Nouns treasury to organize a large scale event that revitalizes the existing speed cubing community and sparks the interest of new kids to join. The equipment acquired will simultaneously increase the quality of all future competitions while also dramatically decreasing the cost of execution. *You can skip to the bottom of the prop to look at the timeline and budget breakdown.*\n\nMoving forward, we will employ Lil Nouns as a branding cornerstone for speedcubing activities, products, and merchandise in the country, and we will form a team of high performing competitors called Lil Kubes, who will represent Lil  Nouns in local and international competitions. This will serve as a friendly and wholesome introduction to the web3 in the country that focuses on core Lil Nounish values: culture, art, creativity, and community. \n\n![Uplifting Everyone](https://i.ibb.co/wd7kk4J/Slide10.png \"Uplifting Everyone\")\n\n**“Our spirit is that people from all over the world have fun together in a friendly atmosphere, help each other and behave sportsmanlike.” - Spirit of the WCA**\n\nFor almost 10 years, BeKubes has been the community hub that supports and sponsors all official speedcubing events in Costa Rica. The community aims to steer youths away from unhealthy habits by providing a space for socializing and self-improvement. Since the beginning, a pedagogy professional was brought in to support neurodivergent participants (ADHD, ADD, ASD) and their families, with many of them making it to the highest ranks.\n\nThe welcoming spirit of the events attracted children from less well-off areas of the country who couldn't afford to attend. To include them, the community began covering their expenses, ensuring they could compete alongside everyone else. This traditional supportiveness has continued to draw participants from across Costa Rica and even from Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Peru, and the USA.\n\n![Lil Kuber](https://i.ibb.co/MG7bNw8/Slide4.png \"Lil Kuber\")\n\n**Proof-of-Work: Official Tournaments Executed in Costa Rica and Central America**\n\n![Tournaments](https://i.ibb.co/QvcTNRP/work.png \"Tournaments\")\n![Lil Winners](https://i.ibb.co/nwbXs8q/Slide6.png \"Lil Winners\")\n![Lil Winners 2](https://i.ibb.co/0M1cr19/Slide8.png \"Lil Winners 2\")\n\n![Lil Team](https://i.ibb.co/Z252XzL/Slide9.png \"Lil Team\")\n\nLil Kubes will be the first local speedcubing team that aims to bring together the most talented and passionate cubers, providing them with a platform to showcase their skills and embody the values of our community. Their goal won’t be only to excel in competitions but also to spread the lighthearted and fun spirit of Lil Nouns.\n\nTo make a strong impression, the Lil Kubes team will be provided with customized uniforms, featuring unique Lil Nouns branding to foster a sense of unity and pride in their accomplishments. Additionally, BeKubes will commission custom-designed cubes and merchandise so that families and attendants can rep Lil Nouns all around the country.\nThrough official events, social media, and collaborations, we want to build a loyal following and inspire a new generation of cubers. By supporting and celebrating the achievements of the Lil Kubes team, we can further extend the reach and influence of Lil Nouns.\n\nFormally, BeKubes will be the sponsor for the team, which means it will take care of managing and supporting the participants throughout the competitions, whereas Lil Nouns will be the brand that represents the spirit of the team in media and attire. The ultimate goal is to be completely self-sustained through sales and fees while still proliferating Lil Nouns.\n\n![Sustainability](https://i.ibb.co/4YkczxF/Slide2.png \"Sustainability\")\n\nOur initial plan is to secure funding for the first major event, providing all the necessary resources to launch the Lil Kubes speed cubing team in a big way. This funding will cover expenses such as customized uniforms, travel costs, competition fees, and the creation of branded cubes and merchandise. By starting strong, we set up ourselves for success.\n\nHowever, our long-term vision is to achieve self-sustainability. As the Lil Kubes team gains recognition and popularity, we plan to rely solely on entry fees, cube sales, and merchandise sales to keep the events running independently. By creating high-quality products and experiences that appeal to a loyal and constantly renewed customer base, we can generate a steady stream of revenue that will support the team's ongoing activities as well as competitions for the general public, without the need for continuous external funding.\n\nAfter achieving this goal, we would not drop the Lil Nouns branding but rather double down on it, since it would have become a core part of the community’s identity and it would have proven to be an attractive brand for speedcubing consumer products and merchandise.\n\nThis approach not only would ensure the longevity of the Lil Kubes team but it would also serve as an example of long-term self-sustainability for a Lil Nouns project.\n\n![Plan](https://i.ibb.co/BLvTCnw/Slide7.png \"Plan\")\n\n**Objectives:**\n1.\tSecuring the essential professional equipmet to carry out large scale events.\n2.\tBooking an attractive and easily-accessible venue for the first event.\n3.\tKeeping funds to cover the expenses of participants who cannot afford fees or travel.\n4.\tCommissioning cubes, trophies, and medals with bespoke Lil Nouns branding.\n5.\tDistributing Lil Nouns merchandise before, during, and after the event.\n6.\tExecuting the biggest speecubing event in Costa Rica in November 2024.\n7.\tRecruiting the first Lil Kubers based on the event’s final results.\n\n**Expected Impact**\n•\tA substantial increase in the number of participants in speedcubing events.\n•\tMore professionalism and full compliance with regulations in all competitions.\n•\tCommunity enabling the most talented competitors to compete internationally.\n•\tSolidifying and expanding Lil Kubes as a recognizable team for top-tier talent.\n•\tTurning Lil Nouns into a recognizable brand in and out the speedcubing community.\n\n**Success Metrics:**\n•\tAmount of competitors/attendees compared to previous local events.\n•\tEngagement with event and team content in local news and off/onchain social media.\n•\tFeasibility of executing a second event significantly less funding from Lil Nouns.\n\n**Timeline:**\n•\t**August:** Venue selection, furniture distribution, designing materials\n•\t**September:** Registrations, media campaign, customized cubes and merch\n•\t**October:** Verifying equipment, furniture, graphical materials, staff\n•\t**November:** Event execution, photographic and video documentation\n•\t**December:** Final success metrics report and feedback from the community\n\nSupport from Lil Nouns will be essential to professionalize speedcubing in Costa Rica. We will be able to organize high-quality competitions and ensure that competitors have access to the best equipment and technology. Prizes and medals will incentivize participants, and sponsorships will allow local talents to represent Lil Nouns.\n\n![Lil Competitors](https://i.ibb.co/9y31qLm/Slide11.png \"Lil Competitors\")\n\n**Budget Breakdown (Total: 10 ETH):**\n\n1.\t**Competition Organization:**\no\tVenue rental and logistics: 0.48 ETH\no\tCompetition furniture (8 folding tables, 30 chairs, 10 tablecloths): 0.4 ETH\no\t(2) Wireless microphones, (1) sound equipment with mixer, (1) badge printer, among others: 1.2 ETH\n2.\t**Equipment and Technology:**\no\tAcquisition of additional competition equipment such as stackmats, official speedstacks displays for competition, including shipping to Costa Rica (approximately 15 sets): 1.5 ETH\no\t(2) laptops, (1) projector, (1) screen, (1) camera, (1) printer: 1.5 ETH\n3.\t**Prizes and Medals:**\no\tManufacturing of medals and trophies with Nouns logos: 0.6 ETH\no\tPrizes for winners: 0.6 ETH\n4.\t**Sponsorships:**\no\tSupport for low-income competitors: 0.24 ETH\n5.\t**Lil Nouns Brand Promotion:**\no\tCreation of t-shirts, hoodies, hats for the competition: 0.8 ETH\no\tCustomized Rubik's cubes with Lil Nouns designs: 0.6 ETH\no\tEvent branding and community social media: 0.6 ETH\no\tMedia strategy and event documentation: 0.6 ETH\n6.\t**Staff and Operational Personnel:**\no\tPayment for 10 to 12 people during more than 12 hours of work before, during, and after the competition: 0.88 ETH\n7.\t**Total: 10 ETH**\n\n![Cube](https://i.ibb.co/PNPsSKn/nouns-cube.png \"Cube\")\n\n**Team**\n**Lil Noun 3199 (BeKubes Hub):** Event execution\n**Lil Noun 4093 (Discord: fabian.bz):** English Point of Contact\n**Lil Noun 4035 (Discord: ferrandino95):** Spanish Point of Contact\n**Lil Noun 5769 (Farcaster: valesol01):** Social Media & Reporting\n*These Lil Nouns along with 5 others were recently bought off the secondary market and they have low historical participation in governance, we are changing that by assigning them to active builders and voters.",

      "title": "Lil Nouns Lab: Boosting Engagement on Farcaster",
      "content": "### Proposal Overview\n\nI'm seeking funding to expand the Lil Nouns brand on Farcaster through the [Lil Nouns Lab](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/lilnouns). My goal is to build tools within the Farcaster ecosystem to boost engagement and support other Lil Nouns initiatives on the platform. The total ask is **6.9 ETH**, respecting the meme, but significantly less considering the efforts already made and those planned, mindful of our minimal treasury. Unlike those who continually ask for money before showing results, this proposal is like the overachieving sibling who already has trophies to show off, backed by substantial retroactive work and proven impact. **Despite the recent decline in ETH prices, I have not adjusted the funding request, underscoring my commitment to delivering value**. Approximately **10-20% of the cost is allocated to infrastructure and services** that will be used. This funding aims to sustain the Lil Nouns Lab until the end of 2024.\n\n### Engaging Our Community\n\nAnyone who’s been part of a community knows that staying connected with existing members is more rewarding and important than constantly seeking new ones. Over the past year, we've realized that our current members, our \"Lil Nouners,\" are our greatest asset. Those who have already contributed their time and money to our community are far more likely to contribute again to the DAO compared to attracting new contributors. By engaging our existing members more deeply, we also create ambassadors who can attract new members through their enthusiasm and commitment. **My mission is to rekindle those connections and bring back the excitement and engagement among Lil Nouners who might have drifted away**. It's about nurturing and strengthening the bonds we've already built and ensuring the proliferation of our community's values and initiatives.\n\n### Current Reach and Potential\n\nFarcaster data reveals that over **700 Lil Nouners have verified their wallets** on the platform, representing a third of all [Lil Noun holders](https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0x4b10701Bfd7BFEdc47d50562b76b436fbB5BdB3B). The Lil Nouns Lab aims to enhance engagement within this social network by connecting with these members.\n\n![](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmWBoxUSko1JDfb6Ks282hYYigGNQcoV7WRqqDqe6qoYio \"Lil Nouners on Farcaster\")\n\n### Progress and Achievements\n\nThis initiative has not been funded so far and has been **retroactive since year-to-date**. All progress and achievements have been made without prior funding, demonstrating our commitment and the initiative's potential impact. Over the past year, I’ve engaged with many less active Lil Nouners on Farcaster, experimenting with various tools to revive community engagement. Here’s what I’ve accomplished:\n\n- **Developed numerous bots, channel automations, frames, and tools**, open-sourcing some and planning to do more as they mature. \n- **Driven thousands of views** to our frontend, as confirmed by Google Analytics and UTM link results. \n- Launched **DC-based notifications**, our most recent initiative, which has already shown a reasonable impact. \n\nThese efforts have significantly boosted monthly voter turnout, which is now almost double compared to the last months of 2023. By reaching out to less active members, I've brought back votes and solved issues through suggestions and feedback from the community.\n\n![](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmWGfBAkMihd8QR2HWFZ5jsCqDaK2CMhwktpnoMqBGdLDE \"Lil Nouns Notification on Farcaster\")\n\n### Deliverables and My Next Steps Include:\n\n- A full operational version of **DC-based notifications for Lil Nouns events** (governance, calls, etc.) tailored to user preferences. \n- A **VRGDA auction frame** for accessing auctions through Farcaster. \n- An **open-source configurable base automation framework** for each of our several Lil Nouns channels on Farcaster, customizable based on each channel's needs. \n- Development of **token-gated features** based on Farcaster infrastructure (currently under development by Farcaster) to enhance user access and engagement. \n\nThere are additional deliverables planned, but I am cautious about overpromising. **My history of delivery, however, shows a pattern of overdelivering**.\n\n### Expected Outcomes and Impact Metrics\n\n- **Increased engagement and activity** within the Lil Nouns community on Farcaster, measured by growth in active users and interaction frequency. \n- **Boosted voter turnout**, with sustained improvements in participation rates. \n- Enhanced **tool adoption and usage** among community members, leading to more efficient interactions and positive feedback for new tools. \n- Expanded reach, with growth in the number of active Lil Nouners and re-engagement of inactive members, measured by an increase in verified Lil Nouners and retention of members. \n- Ongoing development and maturation of open-source tools, fostering innovation and collaboration, evidenced by the release and adoption of new open-source projects and community collaboration. \n\n### Sky-High Potential and Supporting Innovation\n\nThe potential for growing the Lil Nouns user base on Farcaster is enormous. Farcaster continuously introduces new initiatives and tools (Frames, Actions, Composable Actions, Programmable DCs, Frame Transactions, etc.), and I plan to leverage these to drive engagement with Lil Nouns. This initiative is not just about our growth but also about **supporting other Lil Nouns initiatives by expanding their reach and building new tools to assist them**. Through the development period, we will provide technical support to enhance the effectiveness and engagement of various Lil Nouns projects, creating synergies that benefit the entire community.\n\n### Conclusion and Final Remarks\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to continue working with Lil Nouns and am excited to present more tools in the upcoming months. This funding will enable me to sustain and expand our efforts through the end of 2024. The Lil Nouns Lab is poised to make significant contributions to the Farcaster ecosystem, ensuring that our community remains vibrant and engaged. By securing this funding, we can guarantee that the Lil Nouns Lab will continue to be a hub of innovation and support for our members. I am committed to delivering on these promises and am confident that, with your support, we can achieve even greater success. Thank you for considering this proposal and for your ongoing support of the Lil Nouns community.",

      "title": "Lil Nouns Time Lock Vault Contract",
      "content": "Following requests from a few community members, I've put together this spec for a time-based pausing mechanism to **secure our stacked tokens and Nouns**. This aims to give DAO members peace of mind by **preventing potential attacks or issues after lowering the reserve price**.\n\nIf this spec gets a thumbs up in the vote, I'll start building the smart contract as part of my free contributions to the DAO. However, **the DAO should approve and pay the cost of the audit and deployment**. Once approved, I'll provide a **detailed deployment timeline and the codes** in a follow-up proposal if you want to go further.\n\nSince the proposal cannot be created without transactions, this proposal includes a transaction that **sends 0.00069 ETH to the auto bidder contract**.\n\n---\n\n### Specification for Lil Nouns Time Lock Vault Contract\n\n**Abstract**: This proposal outlines the implementation of an upgradeable smart contract with a time-based pausing mechanism, using pre-audited libraries. The contract will handle stacked tokens and Nouns NFTs and ensure that withdrawals and upgrades can only occur outside the specified pause period. All functions, including the delegation of Nouns NFTs, can only be called through Lil Nouns proposals.\n\n### Objectives\n\n1. Implement a pausable contract that can be paused and unpaused based on a specific time period. \n2. Ensure the contract can receive and handle stacked tokens and Nouns NFTs. \n3. Restrict withdrawals of stacked tokens and Nouns NFTs to times outside the pause period. \n4. Prevent changing the pause period while the contract is paused. \n5. Ensure the contract is upgradeable for future enhancements. \n6. Prevent upgrades during the pause period. \n7. Allow delegation for Nouns NFTs to be changed at any time. \n8. Ensure all functions can only be called through Lil Nouns proposals. \n\n### Implementation\n\n#### Key Variables\n\n- **Start Time of Pause Period**: The time when the pause period begins. \n- **End Time of Pause Period**: The time when the pause period ends. \n\n#### Set Pause Period\n\nImplement a function to define the start and end times of the pause period. This function will initially pause the contract and can only be called when the contract is not paused.\n\n#### Time-Based Condition\n\nCreate a custom condition to restrict function execution to times outside the pause period.\n\n#### Pausing Functions\n\nEnsure that the pausing and unpausing functions include checks to allow their execution only outside the pause period.\n\n#### Handling Tokens and Nouns NFTs\n\nImplement functions to handle the receipt, withdrawal, and delegation of stacked tokens and Nouns NFTs. These functions will only allow withdrawals when the contract is not paused based on the time period.\n\n#### Preventing Upgrades During Pause\n\nApply a custom condition to the upgrade function to prevent contract upgrades during the pause period.\n\n#### Proposal-Based Access Control\n\nEnsure that all functions can only be called through Lil Nouns proposals.\n\n### Digital Asset Handling\n\nImplement a function to handle the receipt of Nouns NFTs.\n\n### Withdrawal Functions\n\nImplement functions to withdraw stacked tokens and Nouns NFTs, ensuring they can only be executed when the contract is not paused based on the time period.\n\n### Delegation Functions\n\nImplement functions to delegate voting power for Nouns NFTs to a specified address. Delegation can be changed at any time, regardless of the contract's pause state.\n\n### Upgrade Functions\n\nImplement functions to upgrade the contract, ensuring they can only be executed when the contract is not paused based on the time period.\n\n### Proposal-Based Access Control\n\nImplement a mechanism to ensure that all functions, including pausing, unpausing, setting the pause period, handling tokens, withdrawing assets, delegating Nouns NFTs, and upgrading the contract, can only be called through Lil Nouns proposals.\n\n### Rationale\n\nUsing pre-audited libraries ensures a high level of security and reduces the need for extensive audits. This approach ensures that contract operations are controlled and secure, particularly in terms of pausing, unpausing, upgrading, and delegating, which are all time-based. The ability to receive and manage stacked tokens and Nouns NFTs enhances its utility, and restricting withdrawals and upgrades to non-pause periods adds an additional layer of security. Allowing delegation changes at any time provides flexibility for managing voting power. Ensuring that all functions can only be called through Lil Nouns proposals adds a layer of governance and security, ensuring that actions are only taken through a collective decision-making process.",

In this context, \"customers\" are our community members. My mission is to rekindle lost connections and engagement among Lil Nouners.\n\n### Current Reach and Potential\n\nFarcaster data reveals that over 700 Lil Nouners have verified their wallets on the platform, representing a third of all [Lil Noun holders](https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0x4b10701Bfd7BFEdc47d50562b76b436fbB5BdB3B).

      "content": "Hi Lil Nouns DAO, retying this proposal - have added additional deliverables.\n\nAs per [Prop 196](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/196) deliverables, over the past 3 months I have uploaded 30+ GIFs to [Tenor](https://tenor.com/users/humungous), 50+ GIFs to [Giphy](https://giphy.com/channel/60r90) and minted 16 NFTs to [The Lil Notes](https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x5fe691ebc65aa77c9e62025461912af749008591) (part of hosting Lil Uncut Gems Tuesday Calls). I'm making good progress with the design handbook and now at [lils.wtf](https://lils.wtf) you can follow along live + find Lil brand assets, research and a Lil Nouns animation I made last month for /nouns-clips on Farcaster. In addition to this, I began hosting [Tuesday Trivia at Noun O'Clock](https://warpcast.com/indexcard.eth/0x20de9861), below you can see an example of Lil Nouns brand placement on a promotional graphic.\n\n![noc](https://media.decentralized-content.com/-/rs:fit:800:800/f:webp/aHR0cHM6Ly9tYWdpYy5kZWNlbnRyYWxpemVkLWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2lwZnMvYmFmeWJlaWJnNGtlNWlpeXh4d2EyZGVxNGtwM2ZhM2RmaDI2eXp6c2Q1aHd6dnJpbXU0NGcyZ3o2bWk)\n\nHopefully this helps give a clear example of how I can seamlessly integrate Lil Nouns into this initiative (Lil Nouns already very much a part of this wrt questions, prizes, artwork etc). I am proposing a 6 month sponsorship at 1e per month, giving exposure to the Lil Nouns brand via fun games on Farcaster and daily posts celebrating Noun O'Clock. I will also rename Tuesday Trivia to \"Lil Tuesday Trivia\" and make it as obvious as possible that this is a Lil Nouns supported event. The current prize pool includes 3 Lil Nouns in addition to NFTs from other collections such as Cryptoadz and Optimists (~$2500 total).\n\nThe basic premise of Lil Tuesday Trivia is to present a fun way for people to engage with Nouns art (via [probe.wtf](https://probe.wtf)) and try to answer seriously hard questions in 30mins/1hr around Noun O'Clock - you can follow the channel on Warpcast at  [/noc](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/noc). Today (Fri Jul 19 2024) daily rounds payouts are also active giving away 20000 $nouns each day (hopefully forever). I am seeing steady growth on Farcaster, and was one of the fastest growing accounts in June, now at 3.7k followers. With a consistent posting schedule I should be able to continue this growth and provide a constant stream of engaging, fun and interactive content for Lil Nouns.\n\n**Deliverables**\n- Weekly Animation promoting \"Lil Tuesday Trivia\" (x24 posts/weeks minimum)\n- Lil Questions (at least 1 Q per month will involve Lil Noun related trivia)\n- Weekly Lil design posts to [/lil](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/lil) channel on Farcaster\n- Inclusion into the daily [/noc](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/noc) posts (Farcaster + Twitter):\n![noc](https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExaGNmNnlldTBreDRoaXN0bnptaWx3dGR3eXh0N3o4b2dlOWVjNDlyeCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/VsLH2WbKjT7iAfTRvJ/giphy.gif) ![noc](https://media2.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExOXBjMW9tZnhsOXN5dTJmdG0ydnZwdWFkODN4bWphY2hvOGc3MTI3MyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/dlWxBiIrP59z9cS4QK/giphy.gif)\n\nIn addition to Lils being the lead sponsor of /noc, I am requesting that Lil Nouns DAO sponsor my candidate proposal at Nouns which graduates Lil Design Research Project to [Design Research Project](https://www.nouns.camp/candidates/design-research-project-ae4705dc0816ee6d8a13f1c72780ec5021915fed), allowing me to have a development budget to ship new smart contracts and explore features that build on the game of Nouns.\n\nI appreciate this opportunity to stay working alongside Lils for the rest of 2024 and am excited to present the design book and distribution plan at the end of the year.\n\nThanks for the consideration!\n\nLil Pipe",

This work was funded and agreed upon as part of Prop 195, and this proposal starts the process of transitioning to a VRGDA. \n\nPer the Discord community call, we are going to deploy a VRGDA in place of the daily auction. You can read more about VRGDAs [here](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/08/vrgda). To do this, we must:\n\n- Pause the daily auction (this proposal)\n- Deploy the new Seeder and VRGDA contracts\n- Set the seeder and minter on the Token contract to the VRGDA/SeederV2 (subsequent proposal).\n\n## VRGDA Details\nWork and audit funded as part of Prop [195](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/195).\n\nFrontend PR can be found [here](https://github.com/lilnounsDAO/lilnouns-monorepo/pull/266). Associated contracts can be found [here](https://github.com/rocketman-21/lil-vrgda). Audit results [here](https://github.com/rocketman-21/lil-vrgda/blob/main/audit.md).\n\n## Params\nWe decided on a community call that we'd start with a reserve price of 0.03 ETH (which can be changed in the future via proposal), and target selling 1 Lil Noun per day.\n\nOther parameters include:\n\n- Target Price (0.15 ETH)\n- Price Decay Percent (20%) - pretty standard\n- Pool size (4) - choose from 4 NFTs to mint\n\nThis proposal will serve as agreement from the DAO to deploy the VRGDA with the above parameters.\n\n",

      "content": "Hi Lil Nouns DAO,\n\nAs per [Prop 196](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/196) deliverables, over the past 3 months I have uploaded 30+ GIFs to [Tenor](https://tenor.com/users/humungous), 50+ GIFs to [Giphy](https://giphy.com/channel/60r90) and minted 16 NFTs to [The Lil Notes](https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x5fe691ebc65aa77c9e62025461912af749008591) (part of hosting Lil Uncut Gems Tuesday Calls). I'm making good progress with the design handbook and now at [lils.wtf](https://lils.wtf) you can follow along live + find Lil brand assets, research and a Lil Nouns animation I made last month for /nouns-clips on Farcaster. In addition to this, I began hosting [Tuesday Trivia at Noun O'Clock](https://warpcast.com/indexcard.eth/0x20de9861), below you can see an example of Lil Nouns brand placement on a promotional graphic.\n\n![noc](https://media.decentralized-content.com/-/rs:fit:800:800/f:webp/aHR0cHM6Ly9tYWdpYy5kZWNlbnRyYWxpemVkLWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2lwZnMvYmFmeWJlaWJnNGtlNWlpeXh4d2EyZGVxNGtwM2ZhM2RmaDI2eXp6c2Q1aHd6dnJpbXU0NGcyZ3o2bWk)\n\nHopefully this helps give a clear example of how I can seamlessly integrate Lil Nouns into this initiative. I am proposing a 6 month sponsorship at 1e per month, giving exposure to the Lil Nouns brand via fun games on Farcaster and daily posts celebrating Noun O'Clock. I will also rename Tuesday Trivia to \"Lil Tuesday Trivia\" and make it as obvious as possible that this is a Lil Nouns supported event. The current prize pool includes 3 Lil Nouns in addition to NFTs from other collections such as Cryptoadz and Optimists (~$2500 total).\n\nThe basic premise of Lil Tuesday Trivia is to present a fun way for people to engage with Nouns art (via [probe.wtf](https://probe.wtf)) and try to answer seriously hard questions in 30mins/1hr around Noun O'Clock - you can follow the channel on Warpcast at  [/noc](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/noc). In addition to the trivia, I am trialing daily rounds which are active now, share a post to win some prizes. I am seeing steady growth on Farcaster, and was one of the fastest growing accounts in June, now at 3.7k followers. With a consistent posting schedule I should be able to continue this growth and provide a constant stream of engaging, fun and interactive content for Lil Nouns.\n\n**Deliverables**\n- Weekly Animation promoting \"Lil Tuesday Trivia\" (x24 posts/weeks minimum)\n- Lil Questions (at least 1 Q per month will involve Lil Noun related trivia)\n- Weekly Lil design posts to [/lil](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/lil) channel on Farcaster\n\nIn addition to this sponsorship I am requesting that Lil Nouns DAO sponsor my candidate proposal at Nouns which graduates Lil Design Research Project to [Design Research Project](https://www.nouns.camp/candidates/design-research-project-ae4705dc0816ee6d8a13f1c72780ec5021915fed), allowing me to have a development budget to ship new smart contracts and explore features that build on the game of Nouns.\n\nI appreciate this opportunity to stay working alongside Lils for the rest of 2024 and am excited to present the design book and distribution plan at the end of the year.\n\nThanks for the consideration!\n\nLil Pipe",

      "title": "Enhancing Participation with Extended Voting Period",
      "content": "Our current approval process spans 7 days: **2 days of waiting, 3 days of voting, and 2 days in the final queue**. While intended for efficiency, this timeline can hinder genuine voter participation, even with a lowered quorum. To enhance inclusivity and democracy, we need to boost engagement. Recent trends show we’re nearing quorum without power voters, suggesting healthier voting habits.\n\n**Proposal:**\n\n- **Maintain the two-day waiting period.** \n- **Extend the voting period to four days.** \n- **Retain the final two-day queue.** \n\nThis extends the process to 8 days, allowing more time for voting, which will increase engagement and lead to more informed decisions. Additionally, I have added **1.05 LIL and bitNoun #181 as compensation** for myself for putting this proposal up.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Every Lil voice matters.** Feedback from less active Lil Nouners shows that extending the voting period and sending timely reminders will boost participation. This respects everyone’s busy schedules and ensures wider input. \n- **More voting time means greater participation and a more inclusive decision-making process.** This change ensures every genuine voter can contribute, making the process more democratic and fair. We must ensure no one feels left out or unheard. \n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy implementing this change, we can create a more engaging, fair, and effective proposal approval process. **Your voice matters**, and with this tweak, we can ensure it’s heard. Let’s make our voting system more inclusive, democratic, and decentralized, valuing everyone’s input.",

They just know we're spending **tons of ETH on something that seems like it's never going to see the light of day**, and no one even takes responsibility for it.\n\nIt's been **more than 40 days since the last delivery time** promised from [proposal #195](https://lilnouns.camp/proposals/195). Since at this point no one is going to take responsibility for that, even those who sponsored these proposals, I've decided to **repropose **[proposal #192](https://lilnouns.camp/proposals/192)** and see what the incentives are**.\n\nThis proposal seeks to introduce a **feature within the current Auction House smart contract for adjusting auction duration**, alongside necessary subgraph and frontend updates. It's aimed at enhancing the auction mechanism so we can change auction duration through proposals.\n\nThe **ask has been reduced from 2.69 to 2 ETH**, and the smart contract will be available within a week after the proposal passes, allowing auctions to be changed from **15 minutes to every 12 hours** on a following proposal. The rest of the proposal deliverables, including subgraphs and frontend updates, will be delivered during 4 weeks after that as a pull request to the Lil Nouns monorepo.",

      "content": "Thanks for all the participation and feedback on Proposal [#217](https://lilnouns.camp/proposals/217) about withdrawing the remaining Auto Bidder funds. The proposal didn't pass, which shows there's still strong interest in using the Auto Bidder for acquiring Nouns.\n\nGiven this outcome, I'm putting forward a new proposal to **allocate an additional 10 ETH to the Auto Bidder**. We've seen how effective the Auto Bidder has been in snagging Nouns and boosting our DAO’s treasury and strategy. With only **1 ETH left in the Auto Bidder contract**, we need more funds to keep this momentum going. By allocating **10 ETH from the treasury**, we can ensure we have the resources to continue acquiring Nouns and growing our collection.\n\nIn addition to the 10 ETH for the Auto Bidder, I'm also requesting **1.05 LIL from the treasury** for myself to cover the upkeep associated with managing these proposals.\n\nThe community feedback clearly supports continuing the Auto Bidder's use. This proposal aims to meet that interest by providing the necessary funds to keep it running smoothly. **Getting more Nouns strengthens our position** and broadens our influence in the Nouns ecosystem. This move aligns with our collective priorities and ensures the Auto Bidder can keep doing its job without interruption.\n\nYour votes and input are crucial for shaping our DAO’s future. Let’s make sure our decisions reflect the collective voice and goals of our community. I encourage everyone to **vote in favor of this proposal to allocate 10 ETH to the Auto Bidder and 1.05 LIL for upkeep**, so we can keep up our strategic acquisitions and strengthen our DAO.",

      "title": "Improving Our Voting System with More Days and More Voices",
      "content": "In the last attempts, we barely missed the threshold despite solid participation from our community. This shows that a few key tweaks could make our system way more effective and decentralized. So, I'm bringing this proposal back.\n\nCurrently, our approval process includes 2 days of waiting, 3 days of voting, and 2 days in the final queue, all within a 7-day period. This setup has challenges. **With limited active voters, even though we tried to reduce reliance on power voters by lowering quorum, many genuine voters are busy during the week.** We need to boost engagement from genuine voters to make the process more inclusive and democratic. Recent proposals show that we can almost reach quorum without relying on power voters, which hints at healthier voting habits.\n\n**Here’s my proposal. Keep the waiting period at two days, extend the voting period to four days, and keep the final queue at two days.** This stretches the process to 8 days but gives us more time for voting. The extra day will allow for better engagement from genuine voters, leading to more informed decisions and less idle time.\n\n**Every Lil voice matters.** My communication with less active Lil Nouners shows that extending the voting period and broadly reminding people will increase participation. This way, we show compassion for everyone’s busy schedules and ensure more voices can contribute to our decisions.\n\n**More time for voting means greater participation and a more inclusive decision-making process.** This change ensures every genuine voter has the opportunity to contribute, making the process more democratic and fair. We need to make sure no one feels left out or unheard, and this adjustment can help us do just that.\n\nLet’s rally together to make this change and create a more engaging, fair, and effective proposal approval process. **Your voice matters, and with this tweak, we can ensure it’s heard.** Let’s make our voting system more inclusive, democratic, and decentralized, valuing the input of everyone.",

This Noun has been successfully moved to the treasury, strengthening our position. Currently, we have approximately **1 ETH left in the Auto Bidder contract**.\n\nIn light of a few dissenting voices regarding proposal [#211](https://lilnouns.camp/proposals/211), I am putting forward a new proposal to **withdraw the remaining funds in the contract back to the treasury**. If you vote for this proposal and it passes, it will reflect our collective decision to adhere to our original plan of increasing our Nouns to three. Consequently, the remaining funds will be returned to the treasury.\n\nOn the other hand, if this proposal does not pass, I will interpret it as an indication that **there is still interest within the DAO to continue using the Auto Bidder**. In that case, I will submit a new proposal to allocate more funds to the Auto Bidder, ensuring we have sufficient resources to continue acquiring Nouns.\n\nYour participation and votes are crucial in shaping the future direction of our DAO.

Since it was just a hobby, I haven't spent much time gathering and updating data.\n\nThere's a lot of data scattered across different Notion pages and outdated technical information throughout the community. This makes it difficult for members to find what they need quickly and efficiently.\n\nTo fix the lack of a central place for Lil Nouns-related documents, I propose maintaining and updating the Lil Nouns Center with new information. **The ask is 1.69 ETH** 🗓💰, and the process of updating the site's technology, cleaning up outdated information, and adding missing information would take about a month 🗓️. **The codes and data will remain open-source** 💻, as they have been so far.\n\n**The cost will also cover the domain and infrastructure expenses for the next five years** 📚🌐. By doing this, we can ensure that everyone in the community has easy access to up-to-date information, making the Lil Nouns Center a reliable and valuable resource once again 📚.",

      "title": "Leveraging $LIL Token: Wrapping and Bridging for Future Use Cases",
      "content": "$LIL token can be earned by staking Lil Nouns tokens in the [NFTx pool](https://yield.nftx.io/pools/0x18222a762bf67024193de25e1cdc7aa6e614c695/). This process involves depositing your Lil Nouns NFTs into the pool, where they are used to generate $LIL tokens as rewards. This token is issued by the NFTx pool, and we don't have a lot of control over it. Utilizing it can be a bit challenging. However, it provides its own value and can be easily exchanged through [SushiSwap](https://app.sushi.com/swap?outputCurrency=0x18222a762bf67024193de25e1cdc7aa6e614c695&inputCurrency=ETH) for any other token.\n\nUsing $LIL token as a reward on the mainnet is not cost-effective, and its own functionalities are limited. Therefore, I propose creating a wrapper token that can wrap $LIL tokens. This will allow us to use its current benefits and add extra functionality. The $LIL token can be wrapped on-chain using a smart contract, enabling us to add governance capabilities and the ability to bridge the token to L2 networks.\n\nThe use cases for wrapped tokens include using them as reward tokens with lower gas fees in Farcaster rounds. We can also create a bridge contract for wrapped tokens on any L2s that the DAO decides on in the future. Additionally, we can create voting pools over L2s using wrapped tokens. Finally, we can bridge wrapped tokens back to the mainnet and unwrap them to be used for claiming a Lil Noun from the token pool. These are sample use cases, and we can leverage the token for many other purposes in the future.\n\n**Deliverables** 📦 **include a wrapped token contract, bridging contracts, and a frontend for bridging tokens to L2s.** Related contracts will be audited, and the source code for both the frontend and contracts will be open-source.\n\n**The timeline** ⏳ **for the project is 3 months for implementation, deployment, and audit, along with building the frontend. The funding request for the whole process is 6.9 ETH.**\n\n**Deployment will initially be on Base, but it could be deployed on other networks as well.** 🌐",

Associated contracts can be found [here](https://github.com/rocketman-21/lil-vrgda). Audit results [here](https://github.com/rocketman-21/lil-vrgda/blob/main/audit.md). \n\n## Params\nWe decided on a community call last week that we'd start with a reserve price of 0.03 ETH (which can be changed in the future via proposal), and target selling 1 Lil Noun per day. \n\nOther parameters include:\n- Target Price (0.15 ETH) \n- Price Decay Percent (20%) - pretty standard\n- Pool size (4) - choose from 4 NFTs to mint\n\nThis proposal will serve as agreement from the DAO to deploy the VRGDA with the above parameters.

      "content": "In proposal number 207, we almost reached the threshold, falling just short despite significant participation from our community. This near miss highlights the potential for a more effective system if we make a few key adjustments. Given this, I'm going to put it up again.\n\nOur current proposal approval process spans 7 days, split into 2 days of waiting, 3 days of voting, and 2 days in the final queue.\n\nHowever, we face challenges with this structure. With limited active voters, many of whom are busy during the week, it's crucial to boost engagement from genuine voters to ensure a more inclusive and democratic process. Our recent proposals show we can almost reach quorum without relying on power voters, highlighting the potential for healthier and more engaged voting.\n\nFrom my personal involvement and discussions with genuine voters, it's clear that many people are busy and miss the voting process due to the limited time frame. **Extending the voting period will give everyone more time to participate, ensuring their voices are heard.**\n\nTo address this, I propose the following adjustments:\n\n- **Shorten the waiting period to one day.** \n- **Extend the voting period to four days.** \n\nThis keeps our overall process within the 7-day timeframe while providing an extra day for voting. **This additional time allows for more engagement from genuine voters, leading to more informed decision-making and less idle time.**\n\nWe all know how important it is for every voice to be heard. Many of our community members have shared that they miss out on voting simply because life gets in the way. By extending the voting period by 25% as an experiment, we show compassion for everyone's busy schedules and ensure that more voices can contribute to our collective decisions. 🗳️\n\nBy providing more time for voting, we encourage greater participation and foster a more inclusive and thoughtful decision-making process. **This ensures that every genuine voter has the opportunity to contribute, making the process more democratic and fair.** We need to make sure that no one feels left out or unheard, and this change can help us achieve that goal. 🌟\n\nLet’s rally together to make this change and create a more engaging, fair, and effective proposal approval process. **Your voice matters, and with this adjustment, we can ensure it’s heard.** Let’s make our voting system more inclusive and democratic, valuing the contributions of all, not just a selected few who think they know better and can make decisions for us all. Let’s do it together and show that we value every single member of our community. 🤝💪🤝",

      "content": "We currently have **1 Noun**, but we need **3 to be able to propose**. How can we achieve this? By restarting our bidding strategy in the Nouns auctions using the remaining **\\~4.9 ETH** in the AutoBidder.\n\nThe AutoBidder simplifies the process by automatically placing bids for us. If we win an auction, the Noun can be withdrawn to our treasury. 🏦\n\nHere's the plan to update the AutoBidder settings and get back in the game: Set the **minimum bid** to **0.69 ETH**, the **maximum bid** to **4.20 ETH**, and the **bidding window** will allow the AutoBidder to place bids in the last hour of the auction. ⏰ All other settings remain the same.\n\nThese adjustments will allow the AutoBidder to use the remaining **\\~4.9 ETH** effectively, ensuring we stay active in the Nouns auctions and move closer to our goal of **3 Nouns**. 🎯 If we see that the DAO's incentives align with this goal, we can consider adding more funds to the AutoBidder later.\n\n**If this proposal doesn't pass**, I'll consider that there are no incentives regarding acquiring new Nouns, and I'll add a new proposal to **withdraw the funds back to the treasury**.",

      "content": "[Propdates](http://propdates.wtf) is a system designed to enhance transparency and accountability within the Nouns DAO ecosystem by tracking and reporting the progress of proposals after they pass. It tackles the unmet need for a consistent on-chain method to monitor contributors' work and recommend updates. Propdates has already become integral to the proposal process, with proposers expected to regularly update the DAO on their work. 🚀\n\nI propose creating a **clone of Propdates for Lil Nouns**, just like the Nouns version but tailored specifically for Lil Nouns and deployed on the **mainnet**. This will ensure Lil Nouns benefit from the same level of transparency and accountability, maintaining a consistent and reliable method for monitoring proposal progress. 📈\n\nThis clone will include the **deployment of contracts**, setup and configuration, and hosting of the subgraph and frontend. It will integrate seamlessly into the Lil Nouns ecosystem, providing all the necessary tools to track and report proposal progress effectively. I can deliver this for **1.69 ETH**, covering all aspects of the project from start to finish. 🌐\n\nBy implementing this system, we can ensure that the Lil Nouns community remains informed and engaged, with a clear view of how proposals are progressing and contributors are performing. This is a crucial step towards enhancing our governance and ensuring that all initiatives are transparent and accountable. 🗣️",

      "content": "Our current proposal approval process spans **7 days**: **2 days of waiting**, **3 days of voting**, and **2 days in the final queue**.\n\nTo be honest, we don't have many active voters, and people are busy with their work during the week. **Extending the voting period gives us more time to foster genuine interaction in the voting process, rather than relying on whale votes**. Recent proposals show that we don't need whale votes to pass proposals. **Without whale votes, the process will be healthier and more democratic**. Imagine that, democracy actually working the way it's supposed to. 🗳️\n\nA healthier voting process means more thoughtful decisions and less influence from a few large players, especially those who got tons of free votes and can single-handedly reach quorum for their own benefit. Because nothing says \"fair process\" like one person calling all the shots, right? By giving everyone more time to vote, we encourage more participation and genuine discussion. **It's about making sure every voice is heard, not just the loudest ones**. 🗣️\n\nNow, for the techy bit (because we need some numbers to back this up). With Ethereum's block time now at **12 seconds**, our waiting period of **13,140 blocks** equates to about **44 hours**. Our voting period of **19,710 blocks** translates to roughly **66 hours**.\n\nSo, to better align with Ethereum's speedy new pace, I propose we adjust our process. **Let's shorten the waiting period to one day (7,200 blocks)** and **extend the voting period to four days (28,800 blocks)**. This way, the overall process still takes **7 days**, but we actually get an extra day for voting. More time to think, less time to twiddle our thumbs. ⏳\n\nThis adjustment streamlines our proposal process, keeps it efficient, and in sync with Ethereum's current block times, **while providing more time for informed and inclusive voting**. Because hey, we all know we could use a bit more thinking and a bit less rushing in our decision-making. 🗳🤔🗳️",

However, we know that irl events can sometimes lead to food waste. To tackle this, I've reached out to several homeless shelters in Austin to coordinate pizza donations at the start of the event and to arrange for any leftover pizzas to be donated afterward.\n\nBy establishing & sharing this donation process framework, we can help future events minimize food waste and amplify our community values.\n\n![Lil Bean](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByRBQU2QR.png)\n\n**Confirmed Shelters:** I am coordinating with Chef Earnest at the Austin Shelter For Women & Children to accept our food donation for his location along with The Salvation Army Rathgeber Center. Since each shelter has different capacities for food donations, like Chef Earnest’s limit of 13 large pizzas at the Women & Childrens shelter, I’m connecting with multiple shelters to maximize our reach & support. (Currently waiting on a reply from Katherine with the Esperanza Community - toofound.org and a call back from Front Step - frontsteps.org)\n\nI believe this proposal allows us to not only have a presence at Concensus 2024, but also have a meaningful proliferation impact during the Pizza DAO Pizza Party. \n\n**Budget 2ETH - This budget will cover the following:**\n\n- Lil Nouns sponsorship of Pizza DAO's Pizza Party\n- Pizza donation to homeless shelters on behalf of Lil Nouns\n- Admin coordination of food donations & delivery of donations at the end of the event\n- (1) Lil Noun to raffle off as a prize at the pizza party.",

It is a followup proposal to the previously passed [OETH test prop](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/165), which confirmed that Lil Nouns can safely earn high risk-adjusted yields for the treasury by utilizing OETH. 30, 60, 90, and 180-day subsequent OETH yield reports were shared with the DAO via Discord to keep DAO members in the loop on OETH performance and new utilities.\n\n**Motivation**:\n\nFrom earlier props and weekly discussions, it is confirmed that the Lil Nouns community is interested in earning yield on the treasury to help fund technical upkeep, administrative needs, and for the long-term growth and prosperity of the Lil Nouns project. On its own, ETH does not earn yield sitting in the treasury, and Lil Nouns holds a lot of ETH.\n\nLido’s stETH is the largest staking protocol in the world, by billions of dollars. StETH holds more than 70% of the mainnet LST market share and contains a massive Lindy effect. Yield on holding stETH earns 2.9% APY. OETH is an LST aggregator that generates blue chip yield while sitting in your wallet. OETH is backed 1:1 by stETH, rETH, frxETH, ETH, and WETH at all times. Yield on holding OETH earns 3.93% APY. Both stETH and OETH yield is paid out daily and automatically through a positive rebase in the form of additional stETH and OETH. \n\nSplitting the treasury assets between stETH and OETH allows for both greater yield generation to the DAO and increased diversification between treasury assets. At the recommended amount of 350 ETH into stETH and 50 ETH into OETH, the expected total interest earned is $35,007.66 (12.105 ETH), or $2,917.305 per month (1.0071167435935497 ETH at current prices). The 70 ETH remaining in the treasury is more than enough to fund additional proposals over the coming months.\n\n**Transactions**\n\nThis prop will execute with two transactions: the first to deposit 350 ETH into stETH using the stETH submit function, which will return 350 stETH, and the second to deposit 50 ETH into OETH using the OETH zapper deposit function, which will return 50 OETH. The OETH yield opt-in function will not need to be called for this prop, because the Lil Nouns wallet is still opted-in from the previous OETH prop. This is confirmed by using the public getter function on the OETH contract, function number 13.\n\n**Usage of Funds Generated** \n\nTo reiterate from the OETH test prop, with the additional ETH that will be generated for the treasury from the stETH and OETH yield, here are several avenues for using the funds:\nSubsidizing public goods spend\nSubsidizing Lil Nouns marketing to offset the cost for future movies, paid promotions, conference expenses, swag, and Noggles\nSubsidizing Lil Nouns infrastructure and auction expenses\nSubsidizing cost for collaboration with other projects\nFunding large team efforts for less\nExtended DAO runway\n\n**Potential Risks and Mitigation**\nThere are seven possible risks when using stETH, and Lido is making sure to reduce each risk as much as possible:\n*Smart contract risk*: Lido conducts regular security audits of its smart contracts by reputable third-party auditing firms. Lido's contracts are also open-source, allowing the community to review and contribute to their security.\n*Liquidity/market risk*: Lido provides liquidity for stETH through decentralized exchanges and liquidity pools, helping to ensure that users can buy and sell stETH even during periods of high volatility or when needed. Lido also incentivizes liquidity providers through additional rewards and fees.\n*Slashing risk*: Lido's staking infrastructure is designed to minimize slashing risk by using a distributed and decentralized network of validators. Lido's liquid staking model also ensures that users receive stETH tokens that are not directly exposed to slashing events.\n\n*Counterparty risk*: Lido enacts robust security measures to protect user funds and operates with transparency to build trust with its users. Lido's governance model also allows stakeholders to participate in DAO voting and hold the protocol accountable.   \n*Protocol risk*: Lido aims to minimize protocol-related risks by closely monitoring the upgrades and developments in Ethereum 2.0 and actively contributes to the protocol's growth and improvement, all while adhering to web3 best practices.\nThe risks for when using OETH and how Origin is mitigating those risks can be found in the previous OETH proposal. An important update to mention is the passing of the OETH simplification proposal. With a simplified OETH, the possible attack surface will be shrunk, as less smart smart contracts will be used behind OETH. Other LSTs will no longer be used for minting new OETH, as yield strategies, or as collateral. OETH strategists have already begun divesting collateral LSTs back to ETH where it will be deployed to the AMO and/or Morpho, and the redeem fee will be heavily reduced or removed completely. Origin’s new product, ARM, can assist with near 1:1 exits back to ETH with zero slippage for both stETH and OETH.\n\nSponsored on behalf of lintcouncil.eth - please do your own due diligence here.",

      "content": "# Lil Nouns Proposal Candidates on Base\n\nNouns have introduced a fresh approach with their v3, allowing anyone to put forward candidate proposals without needing to hold Nouns tokens\\. While I've previously spoken about shifting to v3, the current sentiment among Lil Nouns leaders does not seem to favor this move\\. Therefore, I propose a new strategy that takes advantage of **optimistic layer two blockchains**, like Base and Optimism\\.\n\nThis proposal leverages the **affordability of managing proposals on layer two** and adopts a **permissionless system** that requires no immediate changes to the existing Lil Nouns contracts\\. However, should this model catch on and see positive uptake, there’s potential to **integrate it directly into the Lil Nouns smart contracts later on**\\.\n\nHere’s how it works: Anyone can craft a proposal candidate, attach a **minimal fee to keep spam at bay**, refine it as needed, and finally propose it to Lil Nouns on layer one\\. This can all be done **without owning any Lil Nouns tokens**, as long as the proposal secures enough backing from token holders to meet the required threshold\\. Additionally, others can contribute their suggestions directly on\\-chain\\.\n\nThe plan also includes leveraging **on\\-chain social networks like Farcaster**, where power users can discuss proposal candidates through a user interface, all without needing to own Lil Nouns tokens\\.\n\nWe’re looking at a **budget of 6\\.9 ETH** to develop the necessary smart contracts, a frontend interface, an integrated Farcaster client, and for deployment and ongoing maintenance\\. The **timeline for this project is around four months**\\.\n\n## Detailed Timeline and Costs Breakdown\n\n### Development Phases:\n\n1. **Initial Setup and Planning \\(1 month\\):**\n   - Establishing the foundational project infrastructure\\. \n   - Drafting the initial smart contract specs\\. \n   - Designing the user interface and planning the integration with the Farcaster client\\.  \n2. **Smart Contract Development \\(1 month\\):**\n   - Crafting, testing, and reviewing the smart contracts needed for proposal submissions and updates on Layer Two\\. \n   - Setting up anti\\-spam fee structures\\.  \n3. **Frontend Interface and Farcaster Integration \\(1 month\\):**\n   - Developing a user\\-friendly frontend interface\\. \n   - Integrating the Farcaster client for on\\-chain social interaction related to the proposals\\.  \n4. **Deployment and Testing \\(1 month\\):**\n   - Launching the smart contracts and frontend interface\\. \n   - Extensive testing to ensure seamless operation across both Layer Two and Layer One environments\\. \n   - Resolving any issues discovered during testing\\.  \n\n### Cost Breakdown:\n\n- **Smart Contract Development: 2\\.9 ETH**\n  - This covers the creation, testing, and review of the smart contracts\\.  \n- **Frontend Development and Integration: 2\\.0 ETH**\n  - This involves building and integrating the user interface with the Farcaster client\\.  \n- **Deployment and Maintenance: 2\\.0 ETH**\n  - These are the costs for deploying the interfaces and contracts across networks, plus their maintenance to ensure they run smoothly\\.  \n\nThis detailed plan is designed to set up a **robust proposal management system for Lil Nouns**, using cutting\\-edge layer two technology to boost community participation without the need for token ownership\\. If this initiative proves successful, it sets the stage for potential direct integration with the Lil Nouns smart contracts, further aligning with community input and activity levels\\.",

Notably, our recent initiatives and Prop House rounds, which were once vital for attracting new participants, have diminished in effectiveness and are no longer actively pursued.\n\nGiven these circumstances, I suggest we consider **lowering the proposal threshold from 8 tokens to just 2**. This adjustment would potentially expand the pool of eligible proposers from the current 67 to approximately **467**. While this reduction significantly lowers the barrier to participation, it maintains a necessary level of spam protection. Additionally, it could incentivize holders of a single Lil Nouns token to acquire one more, thus fostering a deeper commitment to our community.\n\nImplementing this change could reinvigorate engagement by enabling more members to **contribute their ideas directly on-chain**, ensuring that fresh perspectives and innovations are brought forth.",

      "title": "Lil Design Research Project III",
      "content": "Hi Lil Nouns, I am back for part 3/(tbc) of the project.\n\nI was meant to make this proposal 6 weeks ago but, due to health issues (had my appendix out), I had to take it easy in Feb, still continued working on the project nonetheless and I've done the overtime 'out of pocket' so-to-speak.\n\nIn Feb I delivered v1 of the community design system that you can [see here.](\"https://www.figma.com/proto/sf3PY81eRW99KYfgiXMNsb/Lil-Brand?page-id=41%3A22914&type=design&node-id=47-26032&t=ZeDEqcSOAKz0rSaf-0&scaling=contain\") These logo assets are Figma components and can be remixed by community however they see fit. I believe I have developed an aesthetic that lends itself well to Lil Nouns and provides a refreshing, kid friendly and comical take on the Lil brand. These designs have been used IRL (Lil Basel, Denver Pizza Party), online (Farcaster Frames, Probe) and hopefully will be used by more community led projects in the future beyond my own. Obviously this is a headless brand, I am not trying to enforce a particular aesthetic, merely provide new open source resources, assets and artwork.\n\nTo-date, ~100+ GIFs have been created and can be [seen here.](https://giphy.com/channel/60r90) I have been producing 1-5 GIFs a week sporadically and I will continue to produce these GIFs with more of a focus on the cartoon illustrative style inline with the brand aesthetic I have now established. **This will be a deliverable for this next 3 month period** and I will commit to producing at least 2 hand drawn animated GIFs a week to give a total of 24 GIFs that I will upload to GIPHY and Tenor in addition to repurposing the art as transparent stickers for keyboards. I will also repurpose Lil Beans content (if kimmy wants me to) for gif keyboards & stickers etc. My current Tenor GIF keyboard can be [seen here.](https://tenor.com/en-GB/users/humungous) In reality I will likely produce more GIFs than this but 2 originals a week seems a decent commitment and will help me improve and develop the style further, I've just got a new apple pencil but am still a trackpad maxi.\n\nI've kept Lils as a key subject matter in everything I am working on around Nouns, from serious illustrations like this [basic explainer](https://zora.co/collect/base:0xb16d28e5ce5c95738407797524d9986f44fd4681/8) for $nogs, to having Lils / Nouns sit side-by-side in recent [probe work](https://probe-wtf-git-staging-mshrm.vercel.app/lils?page=1&per_page=300&sort_property=token_id&sort_method=desc) for Nouns. I am currently adding in Lil Traits images to the dropdowns for easier exploration and this staging version will hopefully be in production at [probe.wtf](https://probe.wtf) before the voting period of this prop is over.\n\nAll my research is being documented here in the [reference doc](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1twd9xXi2Gp9HA7UZ6BgPFSSlt25KN-AVlbVhQ4mE04A/edit#slide=id.g1ec235d922a_0_23) (aka biggest deck at Nouns).\n\nDue to other commitments I have going on, I am reducing the ETH ask by 50% from LDRP II and can commit to spending around a day a week on all of the Lil design related stuff. I can also host the Tuesday/Thursday calls if nobody else is able to. This would basically entail showing up to kick off the call, taking notes on a Tuesday and minting them, which I was helping Dr Dune with for the past 3 months as you can [see here.](https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x5fe691ebc65aa77c9e62025461912af749008591) I am actually writing this prop live on the Tuesday call right now. So to conclude:\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n- 24x illustrated GIFs (2x a week)\n- Updating Brand Book (currently ~90 pages) with community requests\n- Kicking off Weekly Calls (taking notes/sketches + minting)\n- Design Handbook (EOY around Xmas)\n\nI've made good progress on the design handbook, I am exploring traditional distribution and hope to self publish the book in the new year with a novel fundraising effort to do so at the end of 2024. Below I have pasted an introduction to the book for anyone interested:\n\n**Public Domain Enjoyer**\nIn 2013 I was a 20 year old industrial design student at Brunel University London, UK. I was on a Placement Year doing odd freelance jobs and trying to win work on sites like 99designs.com and eventually landed a gig with a co-worker/friend of my Uncle in Sydney, Australia. He was bootstrapping a new money lending platform and needed a designer, so after a couple of emails and a Skype call I flew out to Sydney to get some design 'work experience'. I was there for around 6 months working essentially illegally, cash in hand, from this guys apartment twice a week and the rest from the beach where I was sharing a place with ~20 foreigners also working illegally and studying English in order to stay in Australia. Highlights/lowlights that come to mind are sneaking swimming pools at night time at Coogee Beach, late nights working with my boss in tears due to being ~$250k deep with zero traction, being the slowest person to ever climb Mt. Rinjani in Lombok and being stranded on an Indonesian island for a month high on mushrooms every day. I flew back to London at the end of the stint to finish the final year of my degree feeling pretty confident that digital is the path I wanted to pursue, handy as my course had nothing to do with digital design. I had pretty regular digital design freelance work now so started buying bitcoin and heading down the rabbit hole. \n\nI managed to persuade the Head of Design to let me build a digital product as my final project (course was 99% DFM) and built a crypto crowdfunding platform - somehow scraped through despite only visiting the campus twice in the final year as I was too preoccupied working for a couple of startups, smoking weed and taking mushrooms in my KFC-adjacent apartment; I also ate way too much KFC. To be honest, I paid a developer to build my final project and paid other students to build the physical products I needed to pass. I skipped graduation, back to Sydney to help with a new venture building AML software for banks, this time they were a bit more established, with desks, in a coworking space - although I'm still working cash in hand, worked every single weekend in the office for 3 months, learned a lot about reality of shipping products, landed big 4 banks as clients, got seed funding (I eventually get screwed on equity years later, again valuable lessons to learn imo). Bounced around different accommodations this time including 2 bed apartment with 8 others, a mates sofa in Surry Hills and my Uncle’s sofa on Oxford Street. \n\nSaved some money over the next couple of years, returned to UK, slept on some sofas, floors, spent a bit of time working from Kenya and eventually back to Sydney where I wound up in the Central Backpackers (where I would meet my wife-to-be) still working for the same startup, making a little more money (we had moved to bank transfers by now) and found a few clients in Sydney and London, which I still maintain to this day. I used to work until the wee hours of the morning in Cafe Hernandez in Kings Cross, great place if you are in the area after midnight. Worked on some fun brand design around this time like [the world's smallest phone charger](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nipper/the-nipper-the-worlds-smallest-phone-charger?lang=de) and an [open source all-terrain wheelchair in Kenya.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/safariseat/safariseat-open-source-wheelchair-for-developing-c/) \n\nFrom Sydney I headed to Cambodia due to living costs and to live life in the slow lane, launched a cryptocurrency co-operative in the UK around this time and went down deep rabbit holes like searching for E.Ts to ‘mine’ Gridcoin, launching NFT protocols on testnet (instead of minting Punks), and obsessing over indie animation. Every day I was reading about design, open source, practicing my craft, designing digital wallets, browser extensions, tokenomic/co-op structures, AML platforms, bicycles, rooftop bars, restaurant menus, clothes, cartoons, you name it I was trying it, and enjoying it. For the sake of this proposal I will speed-run through a few more countries to right now winding up here writing this proposal from Costa Rica. I'm going to use the book to extrapolate any important things I've learned and how that applies to working within the world of public domain design & open source technology using Nouns / Lil Nouns as a case study.\n\nThanks for the consideration and I hope I can continue to work with Lil Nouns in this capacity. \n\n![drdune](https://remote-image.decentralized-content.com/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fipfs.decentralized-content.com%2Fipfs%2Fbafybeidin5rvllese64t2doujuztq5pjzarjzqoq2ilekhq5vmv42bvkt4&w=1920&q=75)\n\n![logos](https://i.ibb.co/6046LGG/Screenshot-2023-11-14-at-17-11-48.png)\n\nPipe/60r9",

(\\~2.5 ETH)\n*   Implement any fixes stemming from the audit\n\n## Details\n\nBarebones scaffolding for the VRGDA experiment was built and tested alongside the community in [Prop 64](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/64). Our plan is to build on this MVP in a way that improves the UX, and makes it easier to get the Lil Noun you want within the block time constraints. Currently, the Lil Sandbox contracts change the Lil Noun every block, which makes it nearly impossible to get the Lil you want.\n\nSimilar to Robo Nouns, we will improve the UX of sniping Lil Nouns by introducing a pool of past Lil Nouns you can snipe from.\n\nWe will upgrade the Lil Sandbox contracts to add this additional pool functionality, and ensure the changes fit together in a safe way.\n\nWe also plan to upgrade the UI to show this pool in a clean and intuitive way.\n\n## Audit\n\n![](https://revolution.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmT9xmhpocdoZWHwCYmfGsT8jsMhBdBi8EJtaDrRbnMuNz)\n\n0x52 charges $8k for a 3 day audit. (\\~2.5 ETH). The proposed changes would fit within the `750 nsloc` limit.\n\n## Timeline\n\n**April**\n\n- Build upgrades and comprehensive tests for the VRGDA contracts.\n\n- Design and build new UI to handle the Lil Nouns pool.\n\n- Collaborate with the community to get feedback on the design direction and UX.\n\n**May**\n\n- Deploy on Sepolia Testnet with new UI.\n\n- Audit with 0x52.\n\n- Implement any required changes from the audit\n\n- Ship upgrades to mainnet.\n\n## Team\n\nMy partner [Wojciech](https://kocjan.net/) and I have built many things in the Nouns space, including [Vrbs DAO](https://vrbs.build/), [House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.wtf/), and [That's Gnarly](https://thatsgnar.ly/) to name a few. Most recently, we shipped the [Revolution protocol](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution-protocol), a new version of Nouns DAO that makes earning a vote more accessible. We're happy to answer questions in the Discord or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rocketman_w).\n\nThanks for reading, stay nounish.\n\n\\-- rocketman\n",

I think we would get more value from considered participation and thoughtful feedback, both of which I am more than willing to give. This could be in addition to contextualising general feedback given on Lil Nouns calls, linking resources/call notes etc (where applicable).\n\nIn terms of my voting history at Nouns, I have [voted on 48 proposals ~94% with reason](https://www.nouns.camp/campers/sewerpipe.eth) out of my own pocket, so this Noun could save me some ETH whilst also giving Lils a rational voice onchain at Nouns rather than spam vote with reasons coupled with near 0 voter turnout - both of which is just a bad look imo and counter productive to what we are trying to do.\n\nMy focus at Lil Nouns is onboarding new community members ([and helping existing community members](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/190)) get onchain via Lil Nouncil. I am researching and developing the tools, memetics and documentation to grow this initiative (will talk more about this in a future prop). Removing our Noun voting for the time being will help Lil Nouncil to focus on a purely Lil based body and be a more attractive opportunity for potential new members (the # of Lil Nouns props is much more manageable to vote on than the # of Nouns props at the moment). If people want to vote on Nouns props, they can join [Nouncil](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/nouncil) or [Zeroweight](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/zeroweight)).\n\nThanks for the consideration, please direct all FUD to [@pip](https://warpcast.com/pip) on Farcaster.\n\n![think about it](https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExdW92djAydDJ4bndjenA1Zmp3eHFxcDVsMjNxdTdoN3VnYnQzNDhueCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/SqAca14rwKCMkZx3XH/giphy.gif)",

      "content": "**Proposal:** Dev Onboarding Through ETHGlobal London + Prop House\n**Location:** ETH Global London & Prop House\n**Audience:** Developers \n**Team:** Bixbite \n\n**Overview:** This initiative aims to elevate Lil Nouns' brand presence by participating in Nouns Fair which is an irl activation + bounty program initiative run by Mono & Lex of Nouns Amigos. I will be joining them at ETHGlobal London March 15-17th, and think this is a great opportunity to onboard developers into the Lil Nouns ecosystem.\n\n![Screen Shot 2024-02-12 at 12.57.56 AM-min](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJAttkwap.png)\n\n**Nouns Fair Impact:** Nouns Fair takes place at ETH Global events across the world. Collectively 241 Nounish projects have been submitted across 8 ETHGlobal events with 27 projects being rewarded bounties. \n\n**Bixbite Impact:** While at ETH Denver I personally connected with 43 developers, meaning exchanged contact information. I told them about both Nouns and Lil Nouns and the opportunity for funding that's available including Prop House rounds. Since we did not have an active round I was unable to convert them to submissions, but told them I would send them information when our next one goes live. I would expect to connect with the same, if not more developers at ETHGlobal London.\n\n**Lil Dev Onboarding:** \n* Educate Hackers about Lil Nouns as a SubDAO of Nouns\n* Discuss various ways to become part of the community: join discord, follow social accounts, join weekly meetings\n* Pass out marketing materials discussing alternative funding sources: onchain + Prop House \n    * Marketing materials will have a QR code they scan that takes them to a landing page with info about the Prop House round & links to the round, info & links on how to mint their Lil Dev pass, Lils Warpcast account, Lils Discord server, Lils twitter account, TLNS twitter account, Lil Nouners Twitter account, etc\n* I will be interviewing Developers & have a minimum of 3 recorded sessions to deliver (delivery will be 1 week after Prop House round ends so I have time for editing)\n* Dot will be making me a co-host on the Lil Nouns Farcaster channel & I will be posting daily & moderating the channel. \n\n\n![Screen Shot 2024-03-04 at 11.01.58 PM-min](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJiqYyDap.png)\n\n\n**Lil Dev Prop House Round:** Token Gated Farcaster Frames Prop House Round. Prizes: There will be (10) 0.5 ETH winners, voted on by the Lil Nouns community. Requirements will be to create a frame as a public good that the Lil Nouns community can utilize (such as a frame to bid in our auction) or include Lil Nouns assets within your frame (such as clicking on the frame & showing all of your Lil Assets in your wallet). \n\n**Why Farcaster Frames?** Farcaster is increasing users and engagement at an exponential rate. Currently Lil Nouns engagement rate is falling flat. As you can see our engagement over the last 7 days is 78 vs the Nouns Denver channel that was recently created which has an engagement of 2,200 and the main Nouns DAO channel has an engagement of 14,000. Hosting this Frames bounty / Prop House round will increase engagement, followers and convert community members. \n\n![Screen Shot 2024-03-04 at 10.17.11 PM-min](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1SiFkvaT.png)\n\n\n\n\n**Conclusion:** This proposal will test the viability of a token gated Prop House round, along with testing the engagement, followers and community conversions of increasing our Farcaster presence. \n\n**The Ask:** 7eth to recruit developers into the Lil Nouns ecosystem and a mandated Farcaster Frames Prop House round. The budget will be used for the following:\n* Prop House Prizes (10) 0.5 eth prizes.\n* Lil Dev shirts to give out at ETHGlobal London (100)\n* Marketing materials with quick information on Lils & QR code to scan for more info\n* Daily posting on Lil Nouns Farcaster channel from start of ETHGlobal London until voting ends for the Prop House round. \n* Creation of Lil Devs landing page\n* Art for Lil Dev mint pass\n* 30 day report with analytics from Lil Devs landing page\n* Report after completion of the Prop House round\n* Admin cost for running the Prop House round\n* Admin cost for running the onboarding program at ETHGlobal London\n\n**Team:**\nBixbite: Passionate about onboarding Developers into the Lil Nouns ecosystem. Currently involved in weekly Coding Club sessions with Mulf & SQX and working on Nouns Fair 2024 proposal with Mono & Lex. I love onboarding people at irl events and for my last proposal Lil Nouns x NFT Melbourne I was able to onboard 12 people which 4 of them went on to create Lil Nouns content for the Nouns x Everyone video contest.\n\n**ROI To The DAO:**\nI love stats & data and believe it is important that I can show the DAO a direct ROI from this proposal. I will be collecting data for the report from the following sources:\n* Lil Devs landing page traffic and engagement \n* Lil Dev Pass mints\n* ETH returned to the DAO from Zora Protocol Rewards\n* New Discord onboards to Lils server\n* Proposal submissions to the token gated Prop House round. \n* Increased engagement and followers to Lil Nouns Farcaster channel\n\nI will provide a report to the DAO one week after the Prop House round ends, along with a report with analytics from the Lil Devs landing page 30 days after ETHGlobal London.\n",

      "content": "The purpose of this proposal is to create awareness of the Lil Nouns brand among Spanish speakers, and build a community with a view to onboarding Latin American builders-artists to Lil Nouns DAO OnChain governance via Lil Amigos.\n \nOne part will be IRL at two of the most important Ethereum events in the Central American region, followed by two months of educational and informative content surrounding the Lil Nouns ecosystem in order to push the delegation campaign.\n\n\n---\n\n## Objectives:\n- Proliferate Lil Nouns during two Central American web3 events.\n- Onboard creators-artists in a Lil Nounish Gallery\n- Continue with the delegation campaign through educational content\n- Strengthen the relationship of Lil Nouns with Latam communities; e.g.: Nouns Amigos, ETHVolcano, PizzaDAOLatam, PlazaNouns, ETHkipu, ETHonduras, etc…\n  \n---\n\n \n## WTF ETHSalvador?\n\nThe Ethereum community's will be in the nation that adopted Bitcoin as legal currency, offering a unique chance to learn, hack, and envision a decentralized future in a country championing digital innovation.\n\n\n![IMAGE-1](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1PFJyiha.png)\nWeb: https://ethsalvador.org\n📍El Salvador 🇸🇻\n🗓️: 09/March/2024\n\nAt the heart of the digital revolution, El Salvador emerges as a pioneer, with Ethereum representing the forefront of this new internet. ETH Salvador 2024 is more than an event; it's a strategic celebration of the web3 era, blending Ethereum's innovation with Salvadoran vitality and exploring the magic of Open Source, DAOs, DeFi & NFTs.\n\n\n\n**Activities I**\n\nList of the activities contemplated for ETHSalvador:\n \n- Lil Workshop regarding Lil Nouns and Prop House during the event led by @leobunster\n- Stand with Lil merch throughout the duration of the event + POAPs\n- ETHSalvador Official sponsor closing party produced by PizzaDAO\n \n![IMAGE-2](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJAG-1j2p.jpg)\n\n\n\n**Lil Gallery by PizzaDAOLatam**\n \nActivities surrounding the Lil Gallery will be run by Malbec (Head of LATAM Pizza Party 2021-2022-2023 and holder NounsAmigos) and MentaJengibre (Holder NounsAmigos and PizzaDAO Chile) and will be directly linked to the production of the ETHSalvador closing party. As deliverables, we propose:  \n \n- Presence on the official party poster\n- Conceptualization of the setting of the event based on nounish aesthetics\n- Triptychs explaining Lil Nouns\n- Naming of art expo by local artists as \"Lil Nouns Gallery\".\n- Place at the event for photos with Lil Nouns\n- Audiovisual record of event\n- Mention in X event video post-production PizzaDAO networks\n \n \nWe have prior experience running this type of event, as in the cases of Bitcoin Pizza Day in Chile and recently in Lima, Peru. Here is a video of our most recent event: https://x.com/Pizza_DAO/status/1757427978550616078\n\n\n## WTF ETHLatam?\n\nETHLatam is the largest annual Ethereum conference in the Latin American region. Co-created by community leaders in the region. It is the meeting where users,educators, students, entrepreneurs, developers and all those interested in technology gather to share knowledge, news and experiences.\n\n\n![ETHLATAM2023](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyAyyGjha.png)\nWeb: https://ethlatam.org\n📍SanPedroSula, Honduras 🇭🇳\n🗓️: 13-14/March/2024\n\n\n\n**ACTIVITIES II**\n\n\nActivation at the event by inviting those in the stands or those hacking to wear the noggles, just as we did at ETHBarcelona 2023, with communities like Giveth, Retro PGF, Bankless, Aragon, and more. Those who have their picture taken will have a chance to win a T-shirt.\n \n ![IMAGE-3](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyV2bkjhT.jpg)\nETHBarcelona 2023 photo album: https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjBfwux\n\nPictures taken of builders and uploaded to X may enter raffle to win noggles or \"nounish friends\" toys.

They will exhibit their artwork at the event and will then explore Lil Nouns, creating original art through POAPS.\n \nTotal: 16 POAPs + 2 Designs\n\n## Lil Amigos: Delegation Campaign II\n\n \nLil Nouns Amigos is the Spanish and Latin American Lil Nouns DAO community. We seek to increase participation in the governance of Lil Nouns with the delegation campaign through educational content about Lil Nouns DAO.\n \nWe have made four \"Lil Nouns from 0\" educational Xpaces, reaching 8 delegated Lil Nouns. With this prop we seek to talk about all the projects built with Lil Nouns DAO and its relationship with the Nouns DAO ecosystem.\n\nThis table shows the topics that we will cover in the xpaces (subject to updates). We will mention outstanding Lil Nouns proposals. Once this Xpaces series is over, we will be able to talk endlessly about Lil Nouns props...\n\n![IMAGE-5](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByJgE1s2a.png)\n\nIn our \"Nounish News\" thread with @PlazaNouns, we have also included Lil Nouns news such as the Lil Basel; the last rounds of the Lil Prop House; the update of their traits and more...\n \nWe plan to invite the builders we will meet during the ETHSalvador & ETHLATAM events along with delegates, members of the Nouns community, Lil Nouns and web3 in general to participate in this content.\n \nTwo months of content:\n \n- 8 Xpaces of educational content.\n- Mentions in the \"Nounish News\" threads\n- Add Lil Nouns as an official @PlazaNouns program\n- Instagram posts about Lil Nouns and activations\n- Video tutorials\n \n\nHere are a couple of examples of Lil content:\n\n\n- Video tutorial on how to delegate:https://x.com/leobunster/status/1759284632787234909\n- Mention in nounish news: https://x.com/PlazaNouns/status/1762196800742535269\n\n## Budget\n\nThe following table shows the estimated budget in USDc and ETH (1 ETH = 1250 USD). The table is divided into four sections: 1) Lil Nouns Gallery by PizzaDAOLatam considering everything from the execution of the gallery, 2) Merchandise - contemplating shipping costs of nounworks products, 3) Original artwork we created with POAPs, 4) Related to the per diem two people 5) Lil Nouns content from 0 with @PlazaNouns.

      "title": "Onboard Developers To Lil Nouns Through ETH Denver & Prop House ⌐◨-◨",
      "content": "**Proposal:** Dev Onboarding Through ETH Denver\n**Location:** ETH Denver & Prop House\n**Audience:** Developers \n**Team:** Bixbite & English \n\n**Overview:** Send Bixbite & English to ETHDenver, the premier Web3 #BUIDLathon, to actively engage with blockchain enthusiasts and developers. This initiative aims to elevate Lil Nouns' brand presence by participating in open-source events, talks, workshops, and collaborative BUIDLathon spaces. Our objective extends beyond brand recognition; **we plan to conduct on-the-ground recruiting, tracking onboards through a free mint, and encouraging submissions to a token-gated Prop House Round.** This strategic approach aligns with our goal of fostering developer participation and expanding the Lil Nouns Ecosystem within the dynamic ETHDenver community.\n\n[![Lil Devs](https://imgtr.ee/images/2024/02/14/849ff998f3c9d96134aa8331d2c989bd.png)](https://imgtr.ee/image/Ip7ibX)\n\n**Onboarding Funnel Steps for ETH Denver:**\n\n**Step 1: Introduction at ETH Denver**\nActivity: English & Bixbite attend ETH Denver, engage with builders, and distribute Lil Nouns merchandise.\nObjective: Encourage builders to join the Lil Nouns Discord community, in particular the Lil Coding Class channel.\n\n**Step 2: Lil Dev Pass Minting**\nActivity: While engaging with builders at ETH Denver we will pass out a mini brochure (similar to what Nouns Fair does at ETH Global events) which describes our ‘bounties’ via Prop House.  Participants interested in the Prop House round must mint a Lil Dev Pass as the round will be token gated. It will be a free mint, featuring cute art & Zora protocol rewards will go to Lil Nouns Treasury. \nObjective: Facilitate entry into the Prop House Mandated Dev Round, track mints to Prop House submission rate\n\n**Step 3: Discord Engagement and Education**\nActivity: Engage with builders on Discord, answering queries and providing information about the upcoming Prop House round & also encourage participation in Coding Club sessions.\nObjective: Educate builders about the upcoming Prop House round, emphasizing the 5 ETH prize split between two rounds.\n\n**Step 4: Prop House Round Launch**\nActivity: Initiate the Prop House Mandated Dev Round one week post-ETH Denver, allowing participants to settle in, join Discord, and refine their proposals. I believe the rounds should mirror Nouns Fair initiatives at ETH Global - one bounty for utilizing Lil Nouns in their projects UI/UX and one bounty for a Public Good. \nObjective: Create a token-gated entry system, ensuring participants hold a Lil Dev Pass to submit proposals.\n\n**Step 5: Proposal Submission and Voting**\nActivity: Builders submit proposals for the Prop House Round, and Lil Nouns holders vote on the submissions.\nObjective: Determine the winners of the rounds who will receive the prizes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis onboarding funnel is designed to seamlessly guide builders from initial engagement at ETH Denver to active participation in the Lil Nouns ecosystem, testing the effectiveness of a token gated 5 ETH prize incentive for proposal submission within the Prop House framework. Lil Nouns also has not run a Prop House round in over 4 months, with our last round being a success onboarding Cyber Shakti & the Lens community along with discovering Lil Bean. Lets see who we discover in this round! \n\n![2d3a45585c6eccf5ad5a599606300f83.png](https://imgtr.ee/images/2024/02/14/2d3a45585c6eccf5ad5a599606300f83.png)\n\n**The Ask:** 7eth to recruit developers into the Lil Nouns ecosystem and fund two mandated Novel Tech Prop House rounds. This proposal will have the following deliverables:\n* Token gated Prop House round - 5eth in prizes for the (3eth for Public Good 2eth for UI/UX integration similar to what Nouns Fair does at ETH Global)\n* Merchandise to pass out (t-shirts with Lil Dev design, Noggles & pins from Klim and Prop House Brochure) \n* Bixbite will be a panel speaker at the Ordinals Denver night to proliferate Lil Nouns and onboard & inform builders about our Prop House Round.This is great for cross chain proliferation and educates the Ordinals community on the benefits of a DAO. \n* Travel & Accommodation for Bixbite & English (Flights & AirBNB)\n* In talks with Peter from Nouns eSports to see how we can integrate Lil Nouns into the Nouns side events, but I will be there proliferating & onboarding. \n\n**Team:**\n* Bixbite: I'm passionate about onboarding Developers into the Lil Nouns ecosystem. Currently involved in weekly Coding Club sessions with Mulf & SQX and working on Nouns Fair 2024 proposal with Mono & Lex. I love onboarding people at irl events and for my last proposal Lil Nouns x NFT Melbourne I was able to onboard 12 people which 4 of them went on to create Lil Nouns content for the Nouns x Everyone video contest.\n* English: Co-Host of TLNS and active Web3 community member. English has the connections to get us in front of people of influence in the Ethereum & Ordinals community, which is great for cross chain proliferation. Cardno will also be at ETH Denver which will allow us to do another irl show of TLNS. \n\n**ROI To The DAO:** \nI love stats & data and believe it is important that I can show the DAO a direct ROI from this proposal. I will be collecting data via Lil Dev Pass mints, ETH returned to the DAO from Zora Protocol Rewards, new Discord onboards, and proposal submissions to the token gated Prop House round. I will provide a report to the DAO one week after the Prop House round ends. \n",

We'll also have a raffle prize with physical swag plus let's give away a pizza Lil Noun!\n\nIn addition, I've been working with MemeBrains from CityDAO to secure a spot on a moving truck billboard that will be timed to go from the main Eth Denver event area to the PizzaDAO event with a \"follow Lil Nouns to PizzaDAO\" with  art created by Borg.\n\nTotal budget: 3 eth\n\nPizzaDAO: 2 eth\nBorg: .25 eth (art creation for truck display and poap)\nMoving Billboard: .25 \nLil Pizza Noun: .15\nSwag: .1 for lil pizza stickers and swag\nProf: .25 for coordination and to drive across the state to get the banner from Mike Good (and buy him a beer) \n\n\n\n## **Transactions**\n\nPizzaDAO 2 eth to: dreadpizzaroberts.eth\n0xF41a98D4F2E52aa1ccB48F0b6539e955707b8F7a\n\nBorg .25 to: nickrockefeller.eth\n0xFE52a5D0A116efCE195bABa279758964172E83ed \n\nMoving Billboard .25 eth to:\n0xF3ffAb0B34C184d9654d313d793415bBdc0D1333\n\nProf .5 for Lil Pizza noun snipe, swag, coordination etc to: \n0xCEEd9585854F12F81A0103861b83b995A64AD915\n\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJW997A1a.png)\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "The 2x weekly calls at Lils (Tuesday & Thursday) imo are a key aspect of onboarding new people into the DAO, there is something about the VC/\"IRLness\" that cannot be replicated purely in text chat. To make sure these calls consistently happen, I think we should commit to putting at least a small amount of ETH towards setting a 'loose' agenda, populating the VC with familiar faces, and having an open mic for anyone who may want it, there is power in this happening at the same time, same place, twice a week.\n\nIn the past ~month these calls have somewhat fallen off, the friendly discord chats have turned to a toxic wasteland, and we are turning people off from joining our community rather than welcoming them in and giving them a space to share their ideas of things to bring to Lil Nouns.\n\nWith all that being said, I propose that drdune.eth (fka sqx10) be compensated to run these, initially proposing a 3 month trial to see how it goes, and we can decide from there if we wish to carry on compensating him. He is great at steering the conversation without dominating it and gives everyone a voice. Dr. Dune is non-judgemental, wise, caring, diplomatic and has been running these calls for pretty much a year up until recently, as he felt his efforts were going to waste. I believe/hope that this small token of appreciation would entice him to run the show again.\n\nDeliverables from SQX:\n\n- Show up at least for the start of the weekly calls\n- Conduct a loose agenda\n\nCheers  \n\nP.S. hopefully he is ok with this",

      "content": "## Who am I and what is my goal ?\nHi there, I'm Andrew, aka @drewfromweb3 on twitter! I'm the brains behind Shortcut, a content creation business I started in mid 2023. I specialize in turning lengthy Web3 shows and Space's content into short entertaining clips.\n\nMy aim is to assist TheLilNounsShow in maximizing the value of the content they’ve dedicated significant time to producing. I also want to generate audio clips that appeal not only to existing listeners within the Lil Nouns ecosystem but also to individuals outside of this community who may develop interest in the show and the Lil Nouns ecosystem.\n.\n.\n.\n## 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗽𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝘆 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘄𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗼 :\n\n• 𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 \nRepurposing existing content into short clips is a time-efficient strategy. It allows us to maximize material already produced by the hosts of the show. Reducing the time and resources needed for creating this content is the way to go to save time. That way it would make sure we have fresh brand new content every week while being efficient and maximizing the ROI.\n\n• 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀\nIf we release short clips weekly, we can maintain a consistent online presence while staying engaging to the viewers. The frequency in which we would post would engage current users and people that are out of the nouns or web3 ecosystem. \nHaving more content = more impressions = more attention or the lil nouns.\n\n• 𝗔𝘂𝗱𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁\nShort clips are proven to be one of the most popular ways people enjoy consuming their content. Here are some quick stats to back my claiming :\n“73% of consumers prefer to watch a short-form video to learn about a product or service.”*\n“Short-form videos receive 𝟮.𝟱 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲𝘀 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 than long-form videos.”\n*https://www.theleap.co/blog/short-form-video/\n\n• 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘃𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲\nSpace can be long or too long for many people. That's why short content is easily consumable, and is more accessible to a wider audience. People with busy schedules or short attention spans can easily fit short episodes into their routines.\n.\n.\n.\n## 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗮𝗹 𝗯𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗱𝗼𝘄𝗻\n• You’ll get three clips weekly, all extracted from the weekly episode which is hosted every Monday 6pm (making it a total of 12 clips monthly)\n\n• I’ll design a **unique template** of your show, incorporating it’s colors and overall branding with a **distinctive intro and outro.** The customized template will be consistently applied each week for new clip creation\n\n• I’ll curate interesting timestamps weekly from the clipping process (would love to collaborate with the hosts to maximize efficiency and the quality of the clips)\n\n• Expect each batch of clips to be delivered within a maximum of 24-48 hours after the episode airs so that we can make sure they are as relevant in time as possible.\n.\n.\n.\n## Payment structure\n\n**Stage 1 :** Initial payment of 2.2 ETH which encompasses the time invested in creating the template, intro, outro and producing clips for the next 6 months, maintaining a pace of three clips per week with a quick turnaround.\n\n  **Stage 2 :** Upon the conclusion of the 6 months, the final payment will consist of 8 lil nouns awarded to me.\n.\n.\n.\n## Conclusion\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this prop. Looking forward to getting some feedback and help mix my talent with the goal of growing TLNS and the lil noun’s reach on social media !\n.\n.\n.\n## Useful links\n-   My business (Shortcut) : [https://www.shortcut.works/](https://www.shortcut.works/)\n    \n-   My twitter :  [https://twitter.com/Drewfromweb3](https://twitter.com/Drewfromweb3)\n    \n-   Business twitter : [https://twitter.com/real_shortcut](https://twitter.com/real_shortcut)\n    \n-   TheLilNounsShow twitter : [https://twitter.com/TheLilNounsShow](https://twitter.com/TheLilNounsShow)\n    \n-   *Examples of my work (google drive link) : [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KLSuCUtVtw1JoQXfKk0wefH_7eLo2IK6?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KLSuCUtVtw1JoQXfKk0wefH_7eLo2IK6?usp=sharing)",

I support all of their work\"* - **Luca Netz - CEO, Pudgy Penguins**\n## *“The Lil Nouns Show is one of the best run shows in our space. The hosts are friendly, well informed, and ask great questions. I can tell they not only help propagate the Nouns vision and brand, but also push the whole space forward.”* **Zeneca, Founder of ZenAcademy**\n## *\"I think the show is very engaging and very professionally organized. I think that having this type of content brings a significant value to the DAO\"* - **Arseneii Dain, Cointelegraph**\n\n \n## TL;DR\n\n- ## **The most listened to weekly X spaces show in the Nouns ecosystem**\n- ## **[21,157 listeners across 61 shows](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z_A1EE5aY-HclKbMHmsc5RRJzvDKIzDpfyHQlokqINY/edit?usp=sharing)**\n- ## **346 listeners average per show**\n- ## **The most listened to Soapbox on The Noun Square**\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- Download all audio content from X (and any other platforms used to stream) and make it available for DAO use, via a Lil Nouns Show frontend hosted on [TheLilNouns.Show](TheLilNouns.Show);\n- Pushing forward with an integration with one of the worlds largest cross-chain data platforms; allowing our show to be platformed to a larger and broader audience;\n- Mint each weekly episode using [bound.wtf](Bound.wtf) when the ability to do so is implemented;\n- Provide quarterly updates to the DAO on what we have achieved in audio/video/written format via minting using [bound.wtf](Bound.wtf);\n- Directing listeners/viewers on each show to the Lil Nouns Discord and [lilnouns.wtf](lilnouns.wtf)\n- Ensuring a slot is always available for a Lil Nouns builder to come on to talk about their proposal;\n- All links on pages & shows will have UTM parameters to allow for tracking traffic and engagement to [lilnouns.wtf](lilnouns.wtf);\n- Provide monthly reports on traffic and engagement; and\n- 30 Shows / 30 weeks\n\n\n## What is The Lil Nouns Show?\n\n- [The Lil Nouns Show](https://twitter.com/TheLilNounsShow) is a weekly Lil Nouns funded X spaces show. The show has been hosted on [The Noun Square](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare) since its inception (10 Oct 2022 - 18 Nov 2023) which has enabled us to reach a wider variety of communities.\n- The show consists of a team of five co-hosts, who also take on the roles of researchers, operations and guest bookings.\n- The show looks to position itself as the customer facing ‘front of house’ for Lil Nouns DAO and has done so for the last 12 months.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/YN2XRcx/Jesse-tweet-Base-House.jpg)\n\n\n## Prior Funding\n\n- [Lil Funding](https://www.addressform.io/board/details/689ad3b5-7a88-4ad0-8ba0-4d57703d7636/the-lil-nouns-show-retro-funding-pilot-month/2927) - We have completed a one month, four episode pilot in which we received retro funding at a cost to the DAO of 0.125 ETH per host, per episode. Totalling 2 ETH.\n- [On Chain Proposal](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/68) - Proposal 68 was an on chain proposal to Lil Nouns DAO that passed **1185 votes** to 334. A total of 47 unique addresses voted ‘for’ with just 4 addresses voting ‘against’ making it one of the most successful proposals in Lil Nouns DAO history. There were no abstain votes recorded.\n- [On Chain Proposal](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/94) - Proposal 94 was an on chain second term funding proposal to Lil Nouns DAO that passed **1506 votes** to 337.\n- [On Chain Proposal](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/120) - Proposal 120 was an on chain third funding proposal to Lil Nouns DAO that passed **1226 votes** to 477.\n- [On Chain Proposal](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/138) - Proposal 138 was an on chain funding proposal to Lil Nouns DAO that passed **1150** to 487.\n\n## What have we been doing?\nThe Lil Nouns Show has aimed to be the consistent mouthpiece of the DAO outside of internal communications (discord). We have produced 61 weekly episodes of the show all with the aim of highlighting the DAO to other communities and guests. In doing so, we believe that we have enabled Lil Nouns DAO to be recognised as a legitimate, flourishing and active project that has stood the test of time throughout the downturn in the crypto market.\n\n\nIn doing so, we have become the 'go-to' weekly show in the Nouns ecosystem to host project founders, artists, proposers and everyone in-between. This is something we are proud of, and we now believe that we are in an excellent position to capitalize on this popularity, going into what we all expect to be more favourable market conditions in 2024.\n\nDuring this term we also had the opportunity to bring The Lil Nouns Show on the road when we conducted a special with [Jesse Pollak](https://twitter.com/jessepollak) live from the Base House during Art Basel 2023. During the show, Jesse and the Base accounts tweeted (to their combined **516,900** followers) that they were live on TLNS with Jesse minting a Lil Nouns LIVE during the show. Over the next 6 months we will actively look to engage in more of these opportunities as they present themselves. \n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/0cLfrs2/Base-House-Pic.jpg)\n\n\n## What are we going to do next?\nWe have worked hard throughout the last three months to not only iterate and change the show for the better, but also to take on feedback from our DAO members of what we could do better and what they think would be of value to the DAO. Therefore, the following changes will be implemented to The Lil Nouns Show going forward:\n\n- **A six month term, to enable us to build and scale without uncertainty**;\n- **Utilizing analytics to assess, amongst other things, impact on shows CTA’s, via Click-through Rate to the DAO’s Discord and Auction page**;\n- **Hosting The Lil Nouns Show fully from TLNS X account**;\n- **On-boarding a full time market analyst to cover a wider breadth of topics of interest, during the show**; and\n- **Potential integration with one of the world's largest cross chain data platforms**. \n\nA change from our usual spot hosted on The Noun Square is expected to see a decrease in listeners, initially due to the current promotion of the show being conducted by two separate X accounts, however; if TLNS is to grow outside of it’s current bubble then it is a necessary step to take to enable us to push on and become an even bigger voice across the X spaces scene. This has been discussed on numerous community calls within Lil Nouns DAO discord, and is generally agreed upon that it is the right path to take.\n\nA 6 month term will enable us as a team to not have to go back to the DAO again in three months with what will likely be reduced metrics from previous terms. It is our intent that come the end of this 6 month term, we will be pulling in better figures than we have in the previous 3 months of funding (Oct - Dec 2023).\n\nAs always, we will remain at our current cadence of one show, every Monday at 6pm EST, throughout the next period of funding. We have had great success in this slot and less for a few changes to accommodate what we regard as great guests, we have remained fairly consistent in this approach.\nAs always, we have a set of principles and pillars in which we stick too and they are as follows:\n\n- We will remain on our usual Monday 6pm EST slot;\n- We will continue to expose Lil Nouns to other web3 communities;\n- We will engage with those in our community without a voice and give them a stage to speak; and\n- We will to be a focal point on X for those seeking more information about our DAO\n\n\n## The Lil Nouns Show format\nThe Lil Nouns Show format has remained relatively unchanged since inception. For more detail on show cadence and guests, you can view our previous proposals:\n- [Proposal 68](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/68)\n- [Proposal 94](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/94)\n- [Proposal 120](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/120)\n- [Proposal 138](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/138)\n\n\n## The Lil Nouns Show team\nTeam Bios\n- **April** - I’m April, a web3 enthusiast who has been exploring the NFT space since August 2021, yet to my detriment I only properly dove into the Nouns ecosystem well into 2022. Since then I have become obsessed with how this dream of an open-source brand can succeed. Outside of this world my background is in PR & communications (in-house & agency side) having worked for many years in Amsterdam and London, before following my other passion (skiing) and moving to the other side of the world. \n- **Cardno** - I entered the space in late 2021. I initially became aware of NFTs through the visibility on twitter of BAYC (of course) and after falling into the ‘Fast Food Punks’ discord, (strange, I know) I found myself on a call with the founder within 10 minutes, and being given an NFT 101 chat from him. I was onboarded. Since then, I have been a moderator of various projects such as 3Landers, Chimpers, Lorem and Sugartown. I have also been the host of the official 3Landers twitter spaces show. I am currently a signer for the Lil Funding Gnosis wallet in Lil Nouns and have also seen out a term as a Lil Representative. I also am entrusted with the role of ‘League of Lils’ which means I am on the multi sig for the wallet our DAO uses to place its votes with Nouns DAO. \n- **Crxsher** - I entered the space in February 2021, first in crypto, then in NFTs on Harmony, and finally in Ethereum in April. My first purchase was a piece of Sandbox land, which I then traded for two BAYC Apes, and the rest is history. I’ve had a few successes, made many mistakes, but what has never wavered is my belief that Web3 constitutes a major shift in how the world will interact in the future. I’m a frequent guest on many Twitter spaces in addition to co-hosting the 3Landers spaces, hoping to share, engage, learn and grow as we move forward in NFTs. I’m most active these days in BAYC, Ghxsts, Chimpers, Zen Academy and Lil Nouns, although you’ll find me engaging in several others as well.\n- **English** - I entered this space as a research consultant for a friend who was looking to leverage their musical IP assets in web 3. Upon my research I engaged with multiple communities and ended up moderating for 3landers and Lorem. I am currently working with a web2 gaming company looking to launch their first nft project.\n- **Hudah** - Hudah has been working in the NFT industry since early 2021 as an NFT Strategist at CryptoSlam, Forkast News, and Forkast Labs. He is also the Community Manager at Ozzy Osbourne’s CryptoBatz, and co-founder of the Non Fungible idiots (a private alpha group co-created with Henry the Grape). As a father of three and a tech enthusiast who lived in IRC, ICQ, and early internet platforms since the late 90s, Hudah says that he didn’t join Web3 in 2020, instead he was always here.\n## Social media handles:\n- **X**: [@april_xyz_](https://twitter.com/april_xyz_) **Discord**: april || pinklobster.eth#5026\n- **X**: [@CardnoNFT](https://twitter.com/CardnoNFT) **Discord**: Cardno#0446\n- **X**: [@CryptoCrusher6](https://twitter.com/CryptoCrusher6) **Discord**: Crxsher#3174\n- **X**: [@EnglishNFTea](https://twitter.com/EnglishNFTea) **Discord**: English#0943\n- **X**: [@Hudah_Idiot](https://twitter.com/Hudah_Idiot) **Discord**: Hudah.eth\n## Compensation Model\nTeam reward:\nApril - Co-Host / Guest Booking / Operations - 3 ETH\nCardno - Co-Host / Operations / Guest Booking - 10 ETH\nCrxsher - Co-Host / Guest Booking 3 ETH\nEnglish - Main Host / Guest Booking 10 ETH\nHudah - Co-Host / Market Analytics 10 ETH\n- 30 shows (one TLNS show each week)\n## Total\n## **36 ETH**\n\nIf anyone has any questions regarding this proposal, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with one of us via the discord or X handles above, and we will be happy to answer any questions prior to you voting.",

      "content": "**copy pasta of Milad Prop 142, *minor edits***\n\n**tl;dr**\nAdjusting dynamic quorum parameters would increase DAO health and should increase the percentage of successful proposals that are \"hell yes\" initiatives.\n\n### **Summary**\nI am SQX, pursuing the DQ that Milad started. After discussing and gathering feedback from the community, I am presenting this proposal for the enhancement governance workflow of the Lil Nouns DAO:\n\nDynamic quorum enhances governance by requiring varying levels of support for proposals based on their content. Controversial proposals typically lead to higher voter turnout. Adjusting dynamic quorum parameters can incentivize greater participation and delegation, thereby improving the health of the DAO.\n\nIn version 1 of the DAO contract, quorum was a fixed percentage of the total supply. In version 2, the quorum is dynamic, increasing against votes up to a defined cap. Despite upgrading to version 2, these changes remain unimplemented.\n\nIn this proposal, we advocate for setting the Maximum Quorum at 15% and reducing the Minimum Quorum to 5%.\n\n### **Dynamic Quorum Parameters**\n\nAs articulated in [this detailed post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE), three parameters determine dynamic quorum:\n\n- Minimum quorum %: We propose reducing it to 5%, making it easier for uncontroversial proposals to pass.\n- Maximum quorum %: We recommend setting it to 15% to ensure a majority can decide the outcome of contentious proposals.\n- Coefficient: This should be set to 1, causing each against vote to raise the quorum requirement by one vote until the maximum quorum is reached.\n\nThese parameters can be edited anytime via a proposal; treat these values as the first experiment. (*1 lever at a time*)\n\n### **Proposal Transactions for Humans**\n\n**setDynamicQuorumParams** will adjust dynamic quorum parameters as follows:\n\n- **Minimum quorum BPs**: 5% (500 basis points).\n- **Maximum quorum BPs**: 15% (1500 basis points).\n- **Coefficient**: 1 (1,000,000 in unsigned integer with six decimal places).\n\n**there is a .10 bounty to be paid to SQX & Milad for initiative should it pass. governing is expensive**",

This involved the use of technology and strategic online engagement, with expense reimbursement being a resultant part of the exploratory process.\n\nBody:\n\nThe project entailed an exploratory process: A major accomplishment was the automation of the group's event scheduling and meeting management, achieved through integrating Google Calendar with Chronicle Event creator, significantly improving organizational efficiency. In the digital domain, increased visibility of the @lilnouners account was the goal, notably by obtaining a blue checkmark and establishing connections with multiple online platforms, which helped in building an active online community.\n\nAs a result of which expenses amounting to **0.55 ETH** were incurred. These covered various needs such as Subscriptions for services, Noggles for the ETH Chicago Proposal and testing for Gnosis Lil Nouncil. Additionally, **.035 ETH** *to be repurposed into LBP and 2 LilNouns* are requested for this initiative. \n\nConclusion:\n\nIn summary, SQX role in the Lil Nouners project primarily revolved around pioneering technological integration and digital strategy. These efforts have been instrumental in streamlining operations and elevating the project’s online profile, thus fostering continuous growth and community engagement.\n\n----\n\n## BULLET BREAKDOWN\n### .55 ETH for reimbursible expenses\n- Typefully .2Ξ (stopped)\n- Notion .1Ξ (stopped)\n- X Subscription .1Ξ (ongoing covers ~ 1+ yr)\n    - @lilnouners\n    - @Lilprophouse (sunset)\n- Misc Expense .15Ξ\n    - Noggles for ETH Chi Prop \n    - Various Gas Executions for testing Gnosis Lil Nouncil / Prop House Consolidation\n\n### .35 for 2 Lil Nouns FROM AUCTION for exploratory contributions\n- **Automation of Weekly Meetings and Events Calendar**\n    - Set up a [gcal](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=a1107bf8925d5b8feb9e7c98df836917a898375e77cd52fd1bd16a5545c4f787%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FChicago) that relays with Chronicle Event creator\n        - Currently VERY LOW MAINTENANCE\n    - **SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS**\n        - Create a Dencentralized App (DAPP) to have Lil Nouners add and maintain events. \n        - Recording of Events?\n        - Developer Event?\n        - Meeting Agendas and Minutes?\n- **Automation of Social Accounts**\n    - Connected @lilnouners to a blue check.\n    - Connected @lilnouners to botfrens\n    - Connected @lilnouners to typefully teams (sunset)\n    - **SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS**\n        - Hybrid management\n            - *Scheduled by bot and premade*\n            - *Off the cuff additions*\n            - *likes and reply guy*\n        - Weekly updates to bots\n            - *timing and stale info*\n ",

Digital Brand Library: **Launch v1 15/01/24** (Figma) will include Lil Nouns logo alternatives (inc animated versions), vector illustrations and UI components + guidelines for use in Lil community sites and projects (all cc0)\n4. Design Handbook: Early concepts presented end of February (within a continuation Prop that I will post to complete the book) - **Launch December 2024**\n\nAs mentioned in Take 1 of Phase 2 [Prop 173](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/173), I have spent the first 3 months mainly on research (+ a bit of early concepting/doodling) and getting to know the dynamics of Lil Nouns DAO, seeing where I could have the most positive impact, and offering help to community members to elevate the materials we have. **My ultimate goal for this project is to produce a high quality handbook for designing in the Public Domain** and I think there is great tie in to Lil Nouns/Nouns in general. Whilst I create the book I also want to help where I can e.g. with onboarding new creatives to Lil Nouns, providing entertaining and engaging content, and helping community members with design work, as I have been doing.\n\nThanks for the consideration, hopefully the objectives/deliverables/timelines are clearer here - please vote with reason.",

      "content": "## Tldr: Jet-Set to Lil' Basel: Win an Unforgettable Getaway in Our Auction Adventure!\n\n**Proposal:** Bid for a chance to win a trip to Lil Basel with our exciting adventure raffle, starting at Lil Noun 7909+\n**Location:** Lil Basel, Miami FL \n**Proposer**: Bixbite\n**Purpose:** Increase auction revenue and generate excitement & participation for Lil Basel.\n\n\n![Lil Basel](https://i.ibb.co/p3K7CfV/Screen-Shot-2023-11-22-at-4-02-05-AM.png)\n**Artwork By Messhup - Commissioned By [Prop 143](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/143)**\n\n**Overview:** Get ready for Lil Basel, and let's amplify our auction sales while building anticipation for our upcoming Lil Noun event! Here's the plan: Starting with Lil Noun 7909, every Lil Noun acquired through auction until December 7th at 5:00 pm EST automatically qualifies for a raffle. The enticing prize? 2 ETH! This generous reward will cover their flight, accommodation, and transportation, ensuring they have a fantastic weekend at Art Basel, marking the commencement of the event with the charm of Lil Nouns!\n\n**The Ask:** 2.25eth - this will be enough funds to cover the following:\n- Flight\n- Accommodation (Wynwood / Surrounding Area)\n- Transportation \n- Meals + Entertainment \n- .25 For ChainLink Contract Development & Deployment \n\nMark your calendars because the winner will be revealed on December 7th at the Lil Basel x PizzaDAO Pizza Party. How do we pick the lucky winner? It's all thanks to a nifty random number generator contract powered by Chainlink, making it verifiable and on-chain for that extra dash of transparency. Join in, and let the good times roll! \n\n![Lil Basel](https://i.ibb.co/jHG9XGr/Screen-Shot-2023-11-22-at-4-04-24-AM.png)\n**Artwork By [Prop 143](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/143)**\n\n**Benefits To The DAO:**\n- Direct ROI through increased auction sales for the next 12 days\n- Increased engagement surrounding Lil Basel\n- Increased brand awareness \n\n**Timeline:**\n- November 24: Adventure starts with Lil Nouns 7909\n- December 1: Proposal executes if prop is passed by Lil Nouns onchain vote, funds are transferred to multi-sig.\n- December 7: Contest Ends at 5:00pm EST & Winner is selected live at the Lil Basel x PizzaDAO Pizza Party\n- December 7: Transaction to transfer the winner their prize will be queued & executed within 24hrs.\n\n**Multi-Sig:** If this proposal passes the funds will be transferred to a 2/4 multi-sig with the following trusted community members as signers:\n- Bixbite\n- Pipe\n- Baba\n- Milad\n\n**Terms of Service:** Participation is restricted to qualified mints, beginning with Lil Noun ID 7909. Selling your eligible Lil Noun before the winner is determined will invalidate your entry. In the event of a selection, a new winner will be chosen.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nThe idea is to have this first adventure be the test case to build this program out in phases. \n\n**Phase 1:** Test Case - using multi-sig wallet & deploy a random number generator contract to choose the winner. \n\n**Phase 2:** Create a redirect page that guides individuals after they mint their Lil. This page will provide clear information about their recent purchase, outline the commitment to voting in governance, and present the option to delegate if they choose.\n\n**Phase 3:** Create and implement a reusable Chain Link contract featuring a user-friendly interface. Users can explore past auction adventure contests and winners on this platform. Additionally, prizes will be directly sent to and instantly deployed for the winner through this contract, eliminating the need for a multi-signature process.\n\nThe goal of this program is to provide Lils with enjoyable & exciting features, enhance auction participation, and generate buzz for our upcoming irl events.\n",

      "content": "Hola hermanos y hermanas, سلام برادران و خواهران, 兄弟姉妹の皆さん、こんにちは, Hello brothers and sisters, I've made a short intro video for this prop that [you can see here](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM618hgEN/) on TikTok.\n\nThis is a continuation from [Prop 139](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/139) to cover the next 3 months of Design R&D for Lils. I honestly almost posted at the same cost of 0.5e per month for ~1 day a week but as the treasury has done at least a 2x, I feel compelled to ask for 1e a month to increase my \"official time\" by 2x, continue to offer my help to community members, and work on the handbook more often. I hope/think that this ask is still well within the comfort zone of the DAO at this present time.\n\n ![GIF 3](https://media3.giphy.com/media/WisHuZL538B5FIBoWw/200.webp)\n\n**Some things I have done in the past 90 days (roughly ordered by most recent):**\n\n- Attended and gathered insights on every community meeting without fail (+60hrs)\n- Given honest feedback to everyone\n- [Created a TikTok](https://tiktok.com/@pipedasnowman) to onboard creatives, have begun posting content \n- Minted a lot of Lil Nouns (my entire 2e budget thus far has been spent on Lils)\n- Minted a lot of BitNouns\n- Completed Week 9/26 of weekly Lil Noun Heads, still some way to go\n- Art Basel Banner, T-shirts, Sticker Graphics, etc.\n- Lil Nouncil Artwork and NFT; which you can bid on [here](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xd6c5669be29454c5bcde58fbccdae96803a084d4/3)\n- Uploaded a lot of GIFs to Giphy [here](https://giphy.com/channel/60r90)\n- Animated Emojis and Soundboard for Discord (sorry)\n- Secret Sauce ideas\n- Whoneedsajob artwork for community member Salman\n- Launched a multi-trait explorer [probe.wtf](https://probe.wtf) - funded 0.5e via PH\n- Sponsored Prop to Nouns for Lil Nounders\n- Passed Prop for Withdraw Nouns (to ensure they couldn’t get “stuck” in escrow)\n- Passed Prop for IRL Proliferation in Miami (for Mikegood.eth)\n- Passed Prop for Lil Beans (for Kimmydeuk.eth)\n- Ran a Meme Protest in the Discord\n- Weekly Lil Content (~12 pieces planned, 60+ created - some highlights below)\n- 300+ pages in the [Ref Doc](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1twd9xXi2Gp9HA7UZ6BgPFSSlt25KN-AVlbVhQ4mE04A/edit#slide=id.g1eb7d7a13d3_1_100)\n- [Created a Calendar](https://app.manifold.xyz/c/lilnouns) to mark the rebirth of Lil Prop House (got 0 votes in PH)\n- Made a signal for discussion wrt forking our Nouns back on 4th August, [see here](https://lilnouns.proplot.wtf/idea/558)\n- Have been putting together the design handbook in the background (+72hrs)\n- Started the Figma Library of community brand assets\n- Started helping with a project for a musician I am onboarding to Lils\n\n**Here are some things I plan on doing in the next 3 months (in no particular order):**\n\n- Spend a bit less time on calls (maybe just attend Thursday Happy Hour)\n- Finalize v1 of the community Figma Library\n- Launch some cool stuff via [Lils.wtf](https://lilnouns.wtf) website\n- Help grow Lil Beans TikTok and Lils TikTok, potentially trial Ads\n- Continue writing the design handbook and adding to the reference document\n- Create and share music-related content\n- Enjoy myself\n\n**Summary of the first 3 months:**\n\nWhen I started getting more involved and researching the DAO earlier this year, I had my own thoughts and views about what Lils should do and was honestly leaning towards breaking away from the 1:1 Noun aesthetic; putting down the square glasses and re-evaluating so to speak. I have since taken a dive Noggles-first into the abyss and participated daily in the culture for the past 4 months; my thoughts have definitely been reshaped somewhat after meeting and getting to know the active community members.\n\nIt is too early to draw any major conclusions as the research project is still ongoing, but below I have picked out a few highlights. You can also always check the reference document I am collating if you want to read about some of my thoughts, see early design concepts or seek inspiration for your own endeavours / steal my stuff - the power of cc0.\n\n**Notes**\n\n- Lil's design touchpoints remain essentially unchanged since the project was founded; only notable changes are the new heads (per Nouns 1:1).\n- Community feedback on design decisions is sparse to none; there is, however, a strong desire from some community members to amend front-end UI / UX issues they don’t like.\n- There definitely exist UX issues, and the site is not optimized for noob engagement.\n- The [lilnouns.wtf](https://lilnouns.wtf) front end is basically run and controlled by the Lil Nounders, which is not a bad thing in my opinion, but means it feels impossible for community members to have real impact or change there. I believe there is a need for an alternative front-end that implements community suggestions (e.g., potentially breaking changes and screwing things up, giving things a go, etc. which is something best kept away from [lilnouns.wtf](https://lilnouns.wtf)).\n- A possible midway conclusion here is that there exists an opportunity to create a new front end at [lils.wtf](https://lils.wtf) to add certain functionality and community features.\n- No regular content created until Lil Bean introduction. Bean is literally just starting now and really should be getting pushed by community accounts on TikTok, Instagram, etc. but doesn't seem to be much engagement from within unfortunately.\n- Social dynamics are negatively impacted by whale votes.\n- There could likely be another veto scenario if a v3 fork implementation is proposed.\n\n**Below I have grabbed a few things from my [Reference Doc](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1twd9xXi2Gp9HA7UZ6BgPFSSlt25KN-AVlbVhQ4mE04A/edit#slide=id.g1eb7d7a13d3_1_100) that I am working on:**\n\n\n![Lilnouns Mole GIF](https://media.tenor.com/Uaqc_lS_me4AAAAC/lilnouns-mole.gif)\n\n![Image 3](https://i.ibb.co/4M4rq6L/Screenshot-2023-11-24-at-00-29-32.png)\n![Additional GIF](https://i.giphy.com/media/y2MTwDUqxG0mtdbTVz/giphy.webp)\n![Image 1](https://i.ibb.co/m8B2zbW/Screenshot-2023-11-24-at-00-15-29.png)\n![Image 5](https://i.ibb.co/KKyP6Tv/Screenshot-2023-11-24-at-00-30-01.png)\n![Image 4](https://i.ibb.co/p05zJrj/Screenshot-2023-11-24-at-00-29-45.png)\n![Image 2](https://i.ibb.co/gJt4Jv1/Screenshot-2023-11-24-at-00-29-15.png)\n![Image 6](https://i.ibb.co/b28R1gW/Screenshot-2023-11-24-at-00-30-13.png)\n![Image 7](https://i.ibb.co/ry2BcHd/Screenshot-2023-11-24-at-00-30-34.png)\n![Image 8](https://i.ibb.co/YpJw51D/Screenshot-2023-11-24-at-00-30-48.png)\n\n\n\n![GIF 15](https://i.giphy.com/media/dzQgkJomUwGnIZVxaC/giphy.gif)\n\n\n![GIF 1](https://media3.giphy.com/media/mlLBq8GfHLkkCNzmHU/200w.webp) | ![GIF 2](https://media1.giphy.com/media/xW1lq5mbENVd1Z1TDT/200.webp) | \n\n![GIF 5](https://i.giphy.com/media/eZwHQSDNCn8aNrf4Cw/giphy.webp)\n\n![GIF 6](https://media0.giphy.com/media/0cApllIP1WOwfa7lAT/200.webp) ![GIF 7](https://media0.giphy.com/media/xU5MDMnCOMxD9PgQ8P/200.webp) ![GIF 8](https://media0.giphy.com/media/t34aQaV4ihcD2uyHFE/200w.webp)\n\n![GIF 9](https://media0.giphy.com/media/0T7oUyUrqxsfj7e0B2/200.webp) ![GIF 10](https://media2.giphy.com/media/DEjLoaid0RzbNf1j00/200w.webp)\n\n![GIF 11](https://media0.giphy.com/media/rqkGjsQQn4tb0umAxr/200.webp)\n\n![GIF 4](https://media2.giphy.com/media/iAD3UujWrtOXJJGyND/200w.webp) \n\n![GIF 16](https://i.giphy.com/media/794hoOHqE0H7NIM0KF/giphy.webp)\n\n\n![GIF 13](https://media1.giphy.com/media/qwwNYbYE0LXLorxB7Q/200w.webp) | ![GIF 14](https://media3.giphy.com/media/dCP2rYb0sW40wrL7hA/200.webp)\n\n![Image](https://i.ibb.co/P6PCJNN/Screenshot-2023-11-24-at-00-37-07.png)\n\n![GIF](https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExMHBnY2N5a2g1eDlieHR0aDZqNHkzOGxjeHNxNmZ0ZTV2MW01Nnd6cSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/XszsvNbzuozmwZGjSI/giphy.gif)\n\n\nThanks for your time, I hope you enjoyed the proposal, please vote with reason!",

      "content": "![Lil Nouns](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmUR8NDzcTMNziXC2v11kwqb16M67pSxbfdHxX89ozzR3X)\n\n## Executive Summary\n[Lil Nouns Pics](https://lilnouns.pics) has established itself as a reliable tool within the Lil Nouns DAO community, enabling users to create personalized Lil Nouns images based on their Lil Nouns. Building on our previous success, we are seeking a fund of 1.69 ETH to enhance and expand the platform's capabilities. This initiative includes long-term hosting, the development of a user-friendly API, and consistent platform maintenance, all of which uphold the mission of Lil Nouns DAO to support builders and foster decentralized and innovative content creation.\n\n## Development Milestones\nLast year, Lil Nouns Pics was honored to be a winning project in the Prop House round, which attests to our commitment and the community's faith in our vision. Until a few months ago, the platform was operational, but it went down to requiring maintenance; however, it has undergone a significant rebuild to align with the latest technological standards. Our dedication to continuous improvement reflects our alignment with the DAO's forward-thinking ethos.\n\n## Request for Funding\nThe detailed allocation of the requested 1.69 ETH is as follows:\n\n- Hosting Services (Five-Year Plan): 0.69 ETH\n- API Development (Two-Month Timeline): 0.50 ETH\n- Maintenance and Support (Annual Commitment): 0.50 ETH\n\nThis structured budget ensures the longevity and innovation of the Lil Nouns Pics service.\n\n## Funding Justification\nIntroducing a comprehensive API will vastly extend the functionality of Lil Nouns Pics, allowing for seamless integration into third-party applications and a broader ecosystem presence. The requested funds will enable us to build upon our recognized platform, meet the community's evolving needs, and continue to offer a high-quality service that encourages engagement and creativity.\n\n## Execution Plan for Expansion\nOur strategy is to provide:\n\n- Reliable long-term hosting to ensure continuous platform availability\n- Development of an accessible API within a focused two-month period\n- Ongoing platform maintenance over the next year to address updates and community feedback\n- Sustained support for both users and developers interfacing with Lil Nouns Pics\n\n## Detailed Objectives and Timeline\nThe proposal sets forth the following objectives and timeline:\n\n- Secure platform hosting for five years to provide stability and reliability\n- Complete the API development in a two-month sprint, allowing third-party apps to start integration swiftly\n- Implement monthly and quarterly cycles for reviewing platform and API performance\n- Maintain the platform for one year, during which we will actively engage with the community for feedback and improvements",

      "content": "TLDR: 1 ETH per month for weekly sponsorship of newsletter & weekly X post. Lil Nouns DAO will get routine exposure to a growing and prominent web3 readership of thought leaders across media, art and culture. **For 6 months.**\n\n1. Looking back: Sponsorship Evaluation\n2. Looking forward: Newsletter Sponsorship\n3. Looking forward: Weekly X Post\n4. How To Improve\n5. About me\n6. Conclusion\n\nThis is a follow on proposal from BCheque Newsletter Partnership which was initiated for 6 months at 1 ETH per month.\n\n## **1 - Looking back: Sponsorship Evaluation** \n\nSince the BCheque Newsletter partnership started six months ago this is how my various numbers have changed.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/r7b6t6C/bcheque-table-szn-2.png)\n\nAcross 6 months the newsletter has generated almost 100 clicks on Lils Nouns & Nouns content in the newsletter. \n\nWe have also generated 1000s of views on X by repurposing the newsletter content (see best examples to double down on in Looking forward: Weekly X Post section.)\n\nAfter receiving multiple DMs after sponsored posts, I provided an evaluation in Discord of how I thought the Lil Nouns onboarding process could be improved, identifying common problems and proposing potential solutions:\n\nFeedback: Buying process of Lil Nouns unclear\nSolution: Make a clear explanation explaining how to pick your own Lil/settle auction in the space immediately beneath the auction button so people don't have a frustrating experience\n\nFeedback: Why Lil Nouns and not just regular Nouns?\nSolution: Whilst we have been putting forward our argument that Lils are like a gateway to nouns - the site itself does not have that emphasis. We could create a tagline like \"gateway to nouns\" - or something like that - and make that more prominent across the media e.g. in newsletter, in TLNS show, at IRL events\n\nFeedback: People want to know details of successful props and how to draft\nSolution: We could publish a 1 pager recommended route to funding including examples of the types of things we fund.\n\n## **2- Looking forward: Newsletter Sponsorship**\n\nVia this partnership Lil Nouns has the largest newsletter reach compared with every Nouns sub-DAO, and even Nouns DAO itself. \n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/BKjdTFh/bcheque-chart-szn-2.png)\n\nBased on a review of what content works best, I propose we continue to write about the most exciting proposals we pass; the proposals we help to pass at Nouns DAO; and share more video content where possible.\n\n## **3 - Looking forward: Weekly X Post**\n\nThe X posts often generate more than 1k views each with good engagement. \n\nWhat works best? \n\n(i) Explaining the props we pass:\n![](https://i.ibb.co/m0VB7Pb/bcheque-mucho.png)\n[Example 1](https://twitter.com/BCheque1/status/1683952780069990400?s=20)\n\n(ii) explaining how we are relevant in the broader Nouns game:\n![](https://i.ibb.co/Zz4mzsR/bcheque-69-nouns.png)\n[Example 2](https://twitter.com/BCheque1/status/1715440969372340431?s=20)\n\nI propose to continue with this strategy.\n## **4 - How To Improve**\n\nTo further improve the newsletter for Lil Nouns I will experiment with better prominence at the very start of the newsletter.\n\nAfter taking feedback from the DAO, I think it would be cool to incorporate Lil Beans art into the newsletter and the X post. This will be an experiment to start, so I will test and learn.\n\n## **5 - About me**\n\n- Qualified teacher & lawyer in the UK\n- Founder of The Snapshot (1x per day on X, 1x per week newsletter with 2.1k subs)\n- Co-Founder of The Modern Market Show on X Spaces (approx. 60-100 audience members each day)\n- Multi-month partnerships with Chimpers (1 year) & Metropolis World (3 months)\nAdvisor at Mintify\n- My growth on X in the last 3 months (+22%); 6 months (+43%); 1 year (+88%)\n- Current following: 7k followers\n\n## **6 - Conclusion**\n\nWhilst this has been a difficult time for the DAO across the board to convert interest into new Lil Nouns purchases, I believe continuing to produce quality media for a quality audience at a cost-effective price point is important to position ourselves as an active, creative, and fun community.\n\n",

      "content": "![OETH Graphic](https://imageupload.io/ib/SocWYYoU3Z8lIMJ_1698764705.png)\n\n**For transparency I am sponsoring this proposal for Peter - This is not my proposal, but I support the protocol.**\n\n**TL;DR**: \n\nI am Peter from the Origin Protocol core team. This is a proposal for a (very) low-risk test to earn yield for the Nouns treasury by utilizing Origin Ether ([OETH](https://oeth.com/)). Converting 1 ETH into 1 OETH (they are 1:1) for 30 days would act as a case study to test that Nouns can safely earn high risk-adjusted yields for the treasury by utilizing OETH. \n\nOrigin Protocol is an OG team that launched in 2017. We launched OETH about 4 months ago, with the goal of making it possible for retail users to earn the same kind of yields that institutional traders earn, without needing millions of dollars and a full-fledged trading team. OETH deploys collateral to blue-chip protocols, distributing the yield back to holders daily via positive rebase. Current OETH yield is 8.01% APY on ETH, or about 2x that of the largest LSTs. \n\nWe have seen much larger test case props to Nouns ([Prop 320 for example](https://nouns.wtf/vote/320)); in our opinion this is much too large of an amount to test a new technology with, which is why we are proposing to begin with a 1 OETH test, and can submit an additional proposal in the future for an increased amount as the Nouns community becomes more familiar with OETH. \n\nThis proposal will include two transactions: the first to convert 1 ETH into 1 OETH, and the second to opt-in the Nouns wallet for yield generation.\n\nA more detailed overview on the proposal and on how OETH works can be found below. \n\n![OETH Graphic](https://imageupload.io/ib/ZlGVqg5s9QcVtHX_1698764679.png)\n\n## Stacking Treasury Yield With OETH\n\nPrevious Relevant Proposals:\n18 - [Stake 1 eth in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/18)\n22 - [Stake 10% of treasury in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/22)\n30 - [Stake additional 10% of treasury in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/30)\n52 - [Increase Treasury stETH Position to ~20%](https://nouns.wtf/vote/52)\n217 - [Stake additional 5000 ETH in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/217)\n227 - [Stake additional 5000 ETH in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/227)\n313 - [stETH peg protection](https://nouns.wtf/vote/313)\n320 - [Treasury Diversification](https://nouns.wtf/vote/320)\n\n**Summary**: \n\nThis is a proposal to convert 1 ETH into 1 Origin Ether ([OETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/origin-ether)) to test OETH yield generation for the Nouns treasury.\n\n**Abstract**:\n\nThis is a low-risk test to increase the yield of the Nouns treasury ETH/stETH from 0-4% to 5-7% utilizing Origin Ether (OETH). Converting 1 ETH into 1 OETH for 30 days would form a similar hypothesis as proposal 18 - in this case, that Nouns can safely stack yields utilizing OETH. \n\n**Motivation**:\n\nFrom proposals 18, 22, 30, 52, 217, and 227, it is clear that the Nouns DAO was interested in earning yield on the treasury and extending the project runway. Proposal 313 signals that the community would prefer to continue earning yield with stETH, instead of eliminating risk completely and converting entirely back to ETH. Proposal 320 signals that other mainnet LSTs can be useful for treasury diversification. \n\nThe OETH TVL has been trending upwards at a rate of about $1m per day since launch and has been crushing it in comparison to direct competitors with the yield we are generating. OETH yield is currently at 5.29% APY, whereas icETH APY is down to 2.94% and Cian stETH strategy is down to 4.02% despite taking leverage.\n\nWe are proposing to begin with 1 OETH, and can submit an additional proposal in the future to increase the amount as the community becomes more familiar with OETH. OETH provides significantly increased yields while also protecting against centralization and slashing events. \n\n## OETH Overview\n\nOrigin Ether was launched in May 2023 and is an ERC20 LST aggregator that generates blue chip yield while sitting in your wallet. OETH is backed 1:1 by stETH, rETH, frxETH, ETH, and WETH at all times; holders can go in and out of OETH as they please. Similar to stETH, OETH yield is paid out daily and automatically (sometimes multiple times per day) through a positive rebase in the form of additional OETH, proportional to the amount of OETH held.\n\n\nOETH yield, currently 5.29% APY, comes from a combination of:\n\n\n1. Deploying ETH/WETH on Curve, Convex, Balancer, Aura, and Morpho\n2. LST validator rewards\n3. A 50bp exit fee is charged to those who choose to exit OETH via the [dapp](https://app.oeth.com/) (completely avoidable if using a DEX), this fee goes back to OETH holders\n4. OETH sitting in non-upgradable smart contracts does not rebase, instead the interest generated from those tokens is provided to those that can rebase\n\n\nThese 4 yield generating functions combined enable OETH to generate higher yields than holding or farming any single LST manually. The current collateral allocation and yield strategies can be seen on-chain at all times via the [OETH analytics page](https://www.oeth.com/analytics). Future OETH collateral and yield strategies are governed by [OGV stakers](https://governance.ousd.com/stake).\n\n\nObtaining OETH is seamless, anyone can convert from ETH, stETH, rETH, or frxETH into OETH via any of the following methods:\n\n\n- Minting on [OETH.com](https://app.oeth.com/)\n- Swapping on [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-298/deposit)\n- Swapping on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x856c4efb76c1d1ae02e20ceb03a2a6a08b0b8dc3&outputCurrency=ETH)\n- Swapping on [Maverick](https://app.mav.xyz/pool?chain=1&tokenA=0x856c4efb76c1d1ae02e20ceb03a2a6a08b0b8dc3&tokenB=0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2&fee=0.0004&width=0.001) \n\n\nFor this proposal, Nouns will be using [The Zapper](https://docs.oeth.com/core-concepts/the-zapper) to convert the 1 ETH into 1 OETH. A second transaction will also be included to ensure the Nouns wallet is [opted-in for yield generation](https://docs.oeth.com/core-concepts/elastic-supply/rebasing-and-smart-contracts). \n\n\n**Benefits of Using OETH**\n\n\nThere are a few reasons for why Nouns would choose to use OETH over of attempting to use the same yield strategies: \n\n\n- The yield will always be higher with OETH than if you were to use any of the same yield strategies, since not all OETH is opted-in for yield, and because of the exit fee. At the moment 31,835 OETH is collecting yield and 10,817 is not, so Nouns would receive this boost in yield from the OETH opted-out. With the exit fee Nouns would get paid each time there's an exit - occasionally this puts the combined yield into the 100s!\n\n\n- The Curve/Convex strategy would be very difficult (if not impossible) to replicate without having a Curve pool with a gauge + millions in TVL - Nouns would essentially need its own token and voting power and would be competing for yield with the other large flywheel token holders. \n\n\n- If Nouns were to do the same strategies, someone would need to manage the position. The OETH protocol would be that manager, with collateral reallocated among the whitelisted yield strategies each week. \n\n\n- The OETH protocol chases not just the highest yields but also the safest. During the weekend of March 10 when USDC and DAI depegged, it took the OUSD strategists/Origin engineers about 4 minutes to notice the depeg, and 16 minutes to start the process of moving the funds to a safer strategy. $0 were lost! \n\n\n- The OETH protocol covers all gas costs for moving funds between yield strategies, which is happening weekly but eventually will happen daily. With the price of gas on Ethereum, this could get costly for Nouns if Nouns were to follow the same reallocation schedule. \n\n\n- The cost for security - Origin has OpenZeppelin on retainer! Every new OETH contract is audited before going live. OETH security is prioritized over new feature development. The same level of security would cost Nouns millions of dollars in audit and development costs. \n\n\n- Top-notch development team - OETH shares 95% of the same code as OUSD, which has been live on mainnet for more than 3 years - longer than the Nouns DAO! The battle-tested code that has seen almost $400m combined has been and continues to be developed by a team of 10 full-time engineers. This level of talent required to maintain the smart contracts would be extremely expensive for Nouns, if Nouns were to try and replicate the OETH strategies. \n\n\n\n\n## Usage of Funds Generated\n\n\nSince launch, OETH has earned a yield of about 2x that of stETH yield. With the extra yield generated for the Nouns treasury, there are several avenues for using the additional funds:\n\n\n- Subsidizing public goods spend - Nouns traditionally spends ~800 ETH per month on public goods\n- Subsidizing Nouns marketing - this would offset the cost for future Nouns movies, paid promotions, conference expenses, swag, and Noggles \n- Subsidizing Nouns infrastructure and auction expenses \n- Subsidizing cost for collaboration with other projects - Pudgy Penguins is just the beginning! \n- Funding large team efforts for less - it would take 50% of the stETH yield to fund another Nounish or Agora sized team effort\n- Extended DAO runway - Nouns would extend the project runway twice as long\n\n\n\n\n**Community Cases for Increased Yield**\n\n\nI also don't think getting to our eth position to 100% staked eth limits our spending in any way… the ~500 ETH additional yield we'll get from staking the 10k ETH is not nothing. It's being able to fund another ~$1M / year sized team. That's like being able to fund another nounish or agora sized team effort, which is meaningful! - *Noun40*\n\n\nI think the DAO should maintain around ~6mo of operating spend as ETH… diversify into other staking providers to reduce concentration risk. Overall in agreement with staking more ETH to increase runway. - *cfeng.eth*\n\n\nThe income generated from holding stETH also amounts to ~500 ETH / yr, which is more than 2 weeks of auctions. - *noun12.eth*\n\n\nstETH is a better way of holding eth - *fugazi.eth*\n\n\nI believe there is already too much of the treasury being staked in Lido. I am not interested in staking more, and if I were, I would want to use some other protocol that isn't Lido since we already have a lot in Lido. - *onnnnnnnion.eth*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Potential Risks and Mitigation\n\n\nThere are six possible risks when using OETH, and Origin is making sure to reduce each risk as much as possible:\n\n\n*New token risk* - Given OETH is a relatively new token, some may be worried that OETH is prone to new attack surfaces. While this may be true for other new tokens, OETH was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. Not that long ago, [OUSD reached a market cap of $300m](https://defillama.com/protocol/origin-dollar) without breaking, and without diminishing the APY it was capable of generating. Origin continues to work on OUSD, despite the lower market cap.\n\n\n*Counterparty risk* - OETH is governed by OGV stakeholders around the world. Everything from yield generation to fee collection and distribution is managed by a set of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These contracts are upgradeable with a timelock and are controlled by hundreds of governance token holders. While the initial contracts and yield-earning strategies were developed by the Origin team, anyone can shape the future of OETH by creating or voting on proposals, submitting new strategies, or contributing code improvements. We intend for all important decisions to be made through community governance and limited powers to be delegated to trusted contributors who are more actively involved in the day-to-day management of the protocol.\n\n\n*Smart contract risk of the yield strategies* - Origin is only using platforms for yield generation that have a proven track record, have been audited, have billions in TVL, maintain a bug bounty program, and provide over-collateralized loans. Over-collateralization in itself, combined with liquidations, provides a reasonable level of security for lenders.\n\n\n*Collateral risk* - Origin has chosen 3 of the largest LSTs to ever exist to back OETH, and they have maintained their peg quite well since launch. They have also demonstrated significant growth in circulating supply, so the Origin team is confident that the 3 LSTs will maintain their peg and that OETH will remain stable to ETH. To ensure accurate pricing at all times, OETH is using Chainlink oracles for pricing data for rETH and stETH, and a dual oracle for frxETH that combines two sources: the Curve frxETH/ETH EMA oracle and the Uniswap frxETH/FRAX TWAP oracle. In situations where any OETH collateral falls below peg, [OIP-4 disables minting](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-dollar/issues/1000) of additional OETH tokens using the de-pegged asset.\n\n\n*Slashing risk* - Since OETH is collateralized by multiple LSTs at the same time, OETH is protected from slashing from any individual collateral LST. If there is a small slash, the OETH yield will simply decrease, as income will likely exceed the size of the slash. During a major slashing event, both the slashed LST and OETH will experience a drop in value relative to ETH, but OETH should not fall as low and for as long as the slashed LST, as the remaining un-slashed OETH LSTs will soften the blow. There will never be a negative OETH rebase.\n\n\n*Smart contract risk of OETH* - Origin is taking every step possible to be proactive and lessen the chance of losing funds. Security reviews are prioritized over new feature development, with regular audits being done, and multiple engineers are required to review each code change with a detailed checklist. There are timelocks before protocol upgrades are launched, and deep dives into the exploits of other protocols are constantly being done to make sure the same exploits don’t exist on Origin contracts. Security is extremely important to the Origin team. OETH was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. All audits can be seen on [Audits - OETH](https://docs.oeth.com/security-and-risks/audits) , and OpenZeppelin is now on retainer. On-chain insurance protocol InsurAce awarded OETH and OUSD the [highest possible security rating of AAA](https://app.insurace.io/coverage/buycovers), of which only 3 other projects on the InsurAce platform have received. Optional OETH cover is currently available for both OETH and OUSD on InsurAce. Origin Defi also maintains a $1m bug bounty through [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/explore/), with a resolution time of 7 hours. \n\n\n\n\nExternal OETH analysis:\n\n\n[Llama Risk](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/asset-risk-assessment-origin-ether) - Asset Risk Assessment: Origin Ether (OETH)\n[Auxo](https://mirror.xyz/auxo.eth/1NXxHhJmj44EfHmvA5pEH7mpSLtg-CbYRqmuEkaTRRk) - OETH - Protocol Analysis\n\n\n\n\nOETH in the news:\n\n\n[Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/16/origin-protocol-enters-competitive-ether-yield-market-with-oeth-offering/) - Origin Protocol Enters Competitive Ether Yield Market With OETH Offering \n[TokenInsight](https://tokeninsight.com/en/news/origin-protocol-launches-yield-aggregating-eth-derivative-called-oeth) - Origin Protocol Launches Yield Aggregating $ETH Derivative Called $OETH \n\n[Blockster](https://blockster.com/maximize-eth-staking-yields-with-oeth-a-yield-bearing-ether-pegged-token-by-origin-protocol) - Maximize ETH Staking Yields with OETH: A Yield-Bearing, Ether-Pegged Token by Origin Protocol \n\n**Closing Thoughts**\n\nPeter is a core member of [Origin Protocol](https://originprotocol.com/) and is joined by the fully doxxed Origin team and community, which includes hundreds of thousands of members and open-source contributors. Many members of the Origin team, including both founders, are holding a significant portion of their personal wealth in OETH. Origin Protocol’s corporate treasury is also holding millions of dollars in OETH. We have skin in the game and are willing to put our own money at risk with the code we have written.\n\nThere are no lockups with this proposal, Nouns can move in and out of OETH as the Nouncil, core team, DAO, and community desires. OETH remains completely liquid at all times, and can be spent in the same way as its backing collateral, if unexpected expenses were to arise.",

      "content": "![OETH Graphic](https://imageupload.io/ib/HMr5mhAH6hDTaVe_1697143329.png)\n\n**For transparency I am sponsoring this proposal for Peter - This is not my proposal, but I support the protocol.**\n\n**TL;DR**: \n\n\nI am Peter from the Origin Protocol core team. This is a proposal for a (very) low-risk test to earn yield for the Nouns treasury by utilizing Origin Ether ([OETH](https://oeth.com/)). Converting 1 ETH into 1 OETH (they are 1:1) for 30 days would act as a case study to test that Nouns can safely earn high risk-adjusted yields for the treasury by utilizing OETH. Although Prop 388 did not pass through Nouns DAO, this proposal did receive the support of [Lil Nouns](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/nounsdao/388/votes), we hope we can receive the same support for this proposal. \n\n\nOrigin Protocol is an OG team that launched in 2017. We launched OETH about 4 months ago, with the goal of making it possible for retail users to earn the same kind of yields that institutional traders earn, without needing millions of dollars and a full-fledged trading team. OETH deploys collateral to blue-chip protocols, distributing the yield back to holders daily via positive rebase. Current OETH yield is 8.01% APY on ETH, or about 2x that of the largest LSTs. \n\n\nWe have seen much larger test case props to Nouns ([Prop 320 for example](https://nouns.wtf/vote/320)); in our opinion this is much too large of an amount to test a new technology with, which is why we are proposing to begin with a 1 OETH test, and can submit an additional proposal in the future for an increased amount as the Nouns community becomes more familiar with OETH. \n\n\nThis proposal will include two transactions: the first to convert 1 ETH into 1 OETH, and the second to opt the Nouns wallet in for yield generation.\n\n\nA more detailed overview on the proposal and on how OETH works can be found below. \n\n\n![OETH Graphic](https://imageupload.io/ib/6mPSuLTHGr0YIZx_1697143558.png)\n\n\n## Stacking Treasury Yield With OETH\n\n\nPrevious Relevant Proposals:\n18 - [Stake 1 eth in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/18)\n22 - [Stake 10% of treasury in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/22)\n30 - [Stake additional 10% of treasury in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/30)\n52 - [Increase Treasury stETH Position to ~20%](https://nouns.wtf/vote/52)\n217 - [Stake additional 5000 ETH in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/217)\n227 - [Stake additional 5000 ETH in Lido](https://nouns.wtf/vote/227)\n313 - [stETH peg protection](https://nouns.wtf/vote/313)\n320 - [Treasury Diversification](https://nouns.wtf/vote/320)\n\n\n**Summary**: \n\nThis is a proposal to convert 1 ETH into 1 Origin Ether ([OETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/origin-ether)) to test OETH yield generation for the Nouns treasury.\n\n\n**Abstract**:\n\nThis is a low-risk test to increase the yield of the Nouns treasury ETH/stETH from 0-4% to 8-10% utilizing Origin Ether (OETH). Converting 1 ETH into 1 OETH for 30 days would form a similar hypothesis as proposal 18 - in this case, that Nouns can safely stack yields utilizing OETH. \n\n\n**Motivation**:\n\nFrom proposals 18, 22, 30, 52, 217, and 227, it is clear that the Nouns DAO was interested in earning yield on the treasury and extending the project runway. Proposal 313 signals that the community would prefer to continue earning yield with stETH, instead of eliminating risk completely and converting entirely back to ETH. Proposal 320 signals that other mainnet LSTs can be useful for treasury diversification. \n\nThe OETH TVL has been trending upwards at a rate of about $1m per day since launch and has been crushing it in comparison to direct competitors with the yield we are generating. OETH yield is currently at 8.01% APY, whereas icETH APY is down to 2.94% and Cian stETH strategy is down to 4.02% despite taking leverage.\n\nWe are proposing to begin with 1 OETH, and can submit an additional proposal in the future to increase the amount as the community becomes more familiar with OETH. OETH provides significantly increased yields while also protecting against centralization and slashing events. \n\n\n\n## OETH Overview\n\n\nOrigin Ether was launched in May 2023 and is an ERC20 LST aggregator that generates blue chip yield while sitting in your wallet. OETH is backed 1:1 by stETH, rETH, frxETH, ETH, and WETH at all times; holders can go in and out of OETH as they please. Similar to stETH, OETH yield is paid out daily and automatically (sometimes multiple times per day) through a positive rebase in the form of additional OETH, proportional to the amount of OETH held.\n\n\nOETH yield, currently ~8.00% APY, comes from a combination of:\n\n\n1. Deploying ETH/WETH on Curve, Convex, and Morpho\n2. LST validator rewards\n3. A 50bip exit fee is charged to those who choose to exit OETH via the [dapp](https://app.oeth.com/) (completely avoidable if using a DEX), this fee goes back to OETH holders\n4. OETH sitting in non-upgradable smart contracts does not rebase, instead the interest generated from those tokens is provided to those that can rebase\n\n\nThese 4 yield generating functions combined enable OETH to generate higher yields than holding or farming any single LST manually. The current collateral allocation and yield strategies can be seen on-chain at all times via the [OETH analytics page](https://www.oeth.com/analytics). Future OETH collateral and yield strategies are governed by [OGV stakers](https://governance.ousd.com/stake).\n\n\nObtaining OETH is seamless, anyone can convert from ETH, stETH, rETH, or frxETH into OETH via any of the following methods:\n\n\n- Minting on [OETH.com](https://app.oeth.com/)\n- Swapping on [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-298/deposit)\n- Swapping on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x856c4efb76c1d1ae02e20ceb03a2a6a08b0b8dc3&outputCurrency=ETH)\n- Swapping on [Maverick](https://app.mav.xyz/pool?chain=1&tokenA=0x856c4efb76c1d1ae02e20ceb03a2a6a08b0b8dc3&tokenB=0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2&fee=0.0004&width=0.001) \n- Swapping on [Sushiswap](https://app.sushi.com/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0x856c4Efb76C1D1AE02e20CEB03A2A6a08b0b8dC3&chainId=1)\n\n\nFor this proposal, Nouns will be using [The Zapper](https://docs.oeth.com/core-concepts/the-zapper) to convert the 1 ETH into 1 OETH. A second transaction will also be included to ensure the Nouns wallet is [opted-in for yield generation](https://docs.oeth.com/core-concepts/elastic-supply/rebasing-and-smart-contracts). \n\n\n**Benefits of Using OETH**\n\n\nThere are a few reasons for why Nouns would choose to use OETH over of attempting to use the same yield strategies: \n\n\n- The yield will always be higher with OETH than if you were to use any of the same yield strategies, since not all OETH is opted-in for yield, and because of the exit fee. At the moment 23,731 OETH is collecting yield and 21,280 is not, so Nouns would receive this boost in yield from the OETH opted-out. With the exit fee Nouns would get paid each time there's an exit - occasionally this puts the combined yield into the 100s!\n\n\n- The Curve/Convex strategy would be very difficult (if not impossible) to replicate without having a Curve pool with a gauge + millions in TVL - Nouns would essentially need its own token and voting power and would be competing for yield with the other large flywheel token holders. \n\n\n- If Nouns were to do the same strategies, someone would need to manage the position. The OETH protocol would be that manager, with collateral reallocated among the whitelisted yield strategies each week. \n\n\n- The OETH protocol chases not just the highest yields but also the safest. During the weekend of March 10 when USDC and DAI depegged, it took the OUSD strategists/Origin engineers about 4 minutes to notice the depeg, and 16 minutes to start the process of moving the funds to a safer strategy. $0 were lost! \n\n\n- The OETH protocol covers all gas costs for moving funds between yield strategies, which is happening weekly but eventually will happen daily. With the price of gas on Ethereum, this could get costly for Nouns if Nouns were to follow the same reallocation schedule. \n\n\n- The cost for security - Origin has OpenZeppelin on retainer! Every new OETH contract is audited before going live. OETH security is prioritized over new feature development. The same level of security would cost Nouns millions of dollars in audit and development costs. \n\n\n- Top-notch development team - OETH shares 95% of the same code as OUSD, which has been live on mainnet for more than 3 years - longer than the Nouns DAO! The battle-tested code that has seen almost $400m combined has been and continues to be developed by a team of 10 full-time engineers. This level of talent required to maintain the smart contracts would be extremely expensive for Nouns, if Nouns were to try and replicate the OETH strategies. \n\n\n\n\n## Usage of Funds Generated\n\n\nSince launch, OETH has earned a yield of about 2x that of stETH yield. With the extra yield generated for the Nouns treasury, there are several avenues for using the additional funds:\n\n\n- Subsidizing public goods spend - Nouns traditionally spends ~800 ETH per month on public goods\n- Subsidizing Nouns marketing - this would offset the cost for future Nouns movies, paid promotions, conference expenses, swag, and Noggles \n- Subsidizing Nouns infrastructure and auction expenses \n- Subsidizing cost for collaboration with other projects - Pudgy Penguins is just the beginning! \n- Funding large team efforts for less - it would take 50% of the stETH yield to fund another Nounish or Agora sized team effort\n- Extended DAO runway - Nouns would extend the project runway twice as long\n\n\n\n\n**Community Cases for Increased Yield**\n\n\nI also don't think getting to our eth position to 100% staked eth limits our spending in any way… the ~500 ETH additional yield we'll get from staking the 10k ETH is not nothing. It's being able to fund another ~$1M / year sized team. That's like being able to fund another nounish or agora sized team effort, which is meaningful! - *Noun40*\n\n\nI think the DAO should maintain around ~6mo of operating spend as ETH… diversify into other staking providers to reduce concentration risk. Overall in agreement with staking more ETH to increase runway. - *cfeng.eth*\n\n\nThe income generated from holding stETH also amounts to ~500 ETH / yr, which is more than 2 weeks of auctions. - *noun12.eth*\n\n\nstETH is a better way of holding eth - *fugazi.eth*\n\n\nI believe there is already too much of the treasury being staked in Lido. I am not interested in staking more, and if I were, I would want to use some other protocol that isn't Lido since we already have a lot in Lido. - *onnnnnnnion.eth*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Potential Risks and Mitigation\n\n\nThere are six possible risks when using OETH, and Origin is making sure to reduce each risk as much as possible:\n\n\n*New token risk* - Given OETH is a relatively new token, some may be worried that OETH is prone to new attack surfaces. While this may be true for other new tokens, OETH was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. Not that long ago, [OUSD reached a market cap of $300m](https://defillama.com/protocol/origin-dollar) without breaking, and without diminishing the APY it was capable of generating. Origin continues to work on OUSD, despite the lower market cap.\n\n\n*Counterparty risk* - OETH is governed by OGV stakeholders around the world. Everything from yield generation to fee collection and distribution is managed by a set of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These contracts are upgradeable with a timelock and are controlled by hundreds of governance token holders. While the initial contracts and yield-earning strategies were developed by the Origin team, anyone can shape the future of OETH by creating or voting on proposals, submitting new strategies, or contributing code improvements. We intend for all important decisions to be made through community governance and limited powers to be delegated to trusted contributors who are more actively involved in the day-to-day management of the protocol.\n\n\n*Smart contract risk of the yield strategies* - Origin is only using platforms for yield generation that have a proven track record, have been audited, have billions in TVL, maintain a bug bounty program, and provide over-collateralized loans. Over-collateralization in itself, combined with liquidations, provides a reasonable level of security for lenders.\n\n\n*Collateral risk* - Origin has chosen 3 of the largest LSTs to ever exist to back OETH, and they have maintained their peg quite well since launch. They have also demonstrated significant growth in circulating supply, so the Origin team is confident that the 3 LSTs will maintain their peg and that OETH will remain stable to ETH. To ensure accurate pricing at all times, OETH is using Chainlink oracles for pricing data for rETH and stETH, and a dual oracle for frxETH that combines two sources: the Curve frxETH/ETH EMA oracle and the Uniswap frxETH/FRAX TWAP oracle. In situations where any OETH collateral falls below peg, [OIP-4 disables minting](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-dollar/issues/1000) of additional OETH tokens using the de-pegged asset.\n\n\n*Slashing risk* - Since OETH is collateralized by multiple LSTs at the same time, OETH is protected from slashing from any individual collateral LST. If there is a small slash, the OETH yield will simply decrease, as income will likely exceed the size of the slash. During a major slashing event, both the slashed LST and OETH will experience a drop in value relative to ETH, but OETH should not fall as low and for as long as the slashed LST, as the remaining un-slashed OETH LSTs will soften the blow. There will never be a negative OETH rebase.\n\n\n*Smart contract risk of OETH* - Origin is taking every step possible to be proactive and lessen the chance of losing funds. Security reviews are prioritized over new feature development, with regular audits being done, and multiple engineers are required to review each code change with a detailed checklist. There are timelocks before protocol upgrades are launched, and deep dives into the exploits of other protocols are constantly being done to make sure the same exploits don’t exist on Origin contracts. Security is extremely important to the Origin team. OETH was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. All audits can be seen on [Audits - OETH](https://docs.oeth.com/security-and-risks/audits) , and OpenZeppelin is now on retainer. On-chain insurance protocol InsurAce awarded OETH and OUSD the [highest possible security rating of AAA](https://app.insurace.io/coverage/buycovers), of which only 3 other projects on the InsurAce platform have received. Optional OETH cover is currently available for both OETH and OUSD on InsurAce. Origin Defi also maintains a $1m bug bounty through [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/explore/), with a resolution time of 7 hours. \n\n\n\n\nExternal OETH analysis:\n\n\n[Llama Risk](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/asset-risk-assessment-origin-ether) - Asset Risk Assessment: Origin Ether (OETH)\n[Auxo](https://mirror.xyz/auxo.eth/1NXxHhJmj44EfHmvA5pEH7mpSLtg-CbYRqmuEkaTRRk) - OETH - Protocol Analysis\n\n\n\n\nOETH in the news:\n\n\n[Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/16/origin-protocol-enters-competitive-ether-yield-market-with-oeth-offering/) - Origin Protocol Enters Competitive Ether Yield Market With OETH Offering \n[TokenInsight](https://tokeninsight.com/en/news/origin-protocol-launches-yield-aggregating-eth-derivative-called-oeth) - Origin Protocol Launches Yield Aggregating $ETH Derivative Called $OETH \n[Blockster](https://blockster.com/maximize-eth-staking-yields-with-oeth-a-yield-bearing-ether-pegged-token-by-origin-protocol) - Maximize ETH Staking Yields with OETH: A Yield-Bearing, Ether-Pegged Token by Origin Protocol \n\n\n**Closing Thoughts**\n\n\nPeter is a core member of [Origin Protocol](https://originprotocol.com/) and is joined by the fully doxxed Origin team and community, which includes hundreds of thousands of members and open-source contributors. Many members of the Origin team, including both founders, are holding a significant portion of their personal wealth in OETH. Origin Protocol’s corporate treasury is also holding millions of dollars in OETH. We have skin in the game and are willing to put our own money at risk with the code we have written.\n\n\nThere are no lockups with this proposal, Nouns can move in and out of OETH as the Nouncil, core team, DAO, and community desires. OETH remains completely liquid at all times, and can be spent in the same way as its backing collateral, if unexpected expenses were to arise. \n",

      "title": "Lowering Threshold for Enhanced Governance",
      "content": "Dynamic Quorum is like a smart governance system that adapts to what's on the table. Imagine it as a sliding scale for decision-making, where different proposals require different levels of support based on their content and how much they might stir up discussions. \n\nSo, what's the deal with this proposal? Well, we're suggesting that we make it easier for proposals to pass by lowering the default requirement from 714 tokens to around 357 tokens. Let's dig into why this change could be a game-changer for our DAO.\n\nIn simple terms, by dropping the threshold to 357 tokens, it becomes smoother for proposals with widespread approval to get the green light. Especially those ideas that aren't too controversial and are in line with what most of our community wants. But that's not all. This also gives more reasons for folks to get involved in proposing things to our DAO.\n\nRight now, it's kind of like only the big players with lots of tokens have the final say. Our aim is to make every single vote count and encourage new members to join in. Think of it as boosting the influence of individual votes and making it more tempting for newcomers to participate.\n\nNow, about setting that upper limit at around 357 tokens and adjusting it based on how many people are voting against it. This does two important things. First, it ensures that for super controversial proposals, a significant chunk of our community must be part of the decision-making process. This makes the results more reflective of what most of us want. And the good news is, we've got more than 1600 active votes, so it's entirely doable. Second, by capping it at 1070, we stop any single super-powerful entity (those big 'whales') from dominating the show or blocking decisions all on their own. It keeps things fair and decentralized.\n\nNow, these numbers aren't set in stone. We can change them through a proposal if needed. Consider it an experiment to see how well they work.\n\nBy making these adjustments, we're aiming to create a governance system that's agile and responsive. It'll encourage more folks to join the conversation and prevent any one big player from calling all the shots. This makes our DAO healthier and our decision-making more effective, catering to the diverse needs of our community.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this proposal. Together, we can shape the future of our DAO for the better. So, let's chat and make it happen!\n",

Our events have had over 50 different NFT & Crypto communities in attendance ranging from Opensea to Pudgy Penguins & more.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/Hx65cpR/picture11-2.jpg)\n\n## W3FC003 - HONG KONG Fintech Week (Apefest):\n\n**Where:** KaiTak\n**When:** Friday 3rd November 2023 \n\nDuring Hong Kong Fintech week / Apefest W3FC, will be hosting a smooth blend of competitive and casual entertainment. For W3FC003 there will be the following activities available to all: \n\n● Competitive 4v4 tournament\n● Fun pickup football games through the day\n● Casual entertainment/music for all to enjoy\n● Refreshments available on-site\n● A relaxing exclusive lounge area for networking\n\nThe sponsorship packages available will be: main sponsor, event sponsor, team sponsors & general sponsors for supporting the event in a smaller manner.\n\n\nFor relevance on our event plan for Hong Kong it will be a tokenproof ticketed event for a limited number of 250 people. There will be multiple teams, all inclusive 4v4 tournament alongside opportunities for all to enjoy playing soccer. If that's not your thing, the surrounding environment will be full of music, joy and networking opportunities as we bring guests from both Apefest and Fintech week together.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/8NDDNzF/newnewnew.jpg)\n\n## What Lil Nouns get as main sponsors:\nThe Lil Nouns branding & famous ‘noggles’ will be on everything across the event. \n- Step & Repeat / Main advertisement Signage Branding \n- All signage\n- Pre & Post event content\n\nAlongside this, Lil Nouns will have the name and branding of our lounge area where guests from major tech companies, projects, blockchains & more will be gathering to relax and drink! \n\nThe Lil Nouns branding will be the exclusive centre point of the entire custom made W3FC Jersey which will be given to all of our sponsors, players and attendees who are of high importance. There will only be 75 jerseys initially printed, 20 of which will be reserved & raffled to Lil nouns holders.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/d6g38L8/Screenshot-2023-09-26-215919.png)\n*It’s important to also note that the jersey will only feature additional ‘side arm’ patches for the event sponsor and that the ‘Lil nouns’ main chest sponsor will be exclusive to all jerseys.*\n\nFinally, the Lil Nouns will be given an allocated area for their own activation booth/table where community members can hand out resources on Lil Nouns, tell attendees about the DAO & vision.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/Wxkt0dh/picture66.jpg)\n\n## Videographer, Editing & Docu-Series\n\nIn the past, W3FC have consistently produced top tier content & will be continuing to level up at our future events. We will be capturing a BTS docu-series we call ‘Ballin’ in Public’ showing off how much work & the craziness behind putting on our W3FC events. The Lil Nouns will be a full feature of our event content & short format clips we will be creating from W3FC003. We will be ensuring the marketing value is hit hard for Lil Nouns & our sponsors during the upcoming events.\n[Example 1](https://twitter.com/webthreefc/status/1653098113907695618)\n[Example 2](https://t.co/VpHA1TXktB)\n\n## How Much:\n$10,000 USD - Main Sponsor for Hong Kong, W3FC003 event.\n$500 USD - Purchase of x2 Lil Nouns via W3FC.ETH in order to participate in further Lil nouns projects.\n\n**Total cost - $10,500 USDC // (6.62ETH at this current time)**\n\n*This proposal has been submitted on behalf of W3FC and [@JordyMaui](https://x.com/jordymaui?s=20)*\n",

      "content": "# ⌐◨-◨ Lil Nouns take over Art Basel! \n\n## tl:dr: Host an all day event during Art Basel Miami, bringing together nounsfolk throughout the ecosystem and providing a space to learn about Lil Nouns/Nouns.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Skc4q7Rk6.png)\n\n\nIRL activations are one of the best ways to bring together a community and to introduce those outside the community to our ecosystem. We propose to host an all day nounish event during Art Basel Miami on Thursday, December 7 at Hodler Gallery with Lil Nouns as the primary sponsor.\n\nHodler Gallery is an NFT/digital art space with 9 screens and open event/lounge space. This same space was used for the Nouniversary event as seen in the tweets below.\n\nhttps://x.com/ProfWerder/status/1689290118320824321?s=20\n\nhttps://x.com/ProfWerder/status/1689106293628313601?s=20\n\nFor this event, Lil Nouns art and branding will be will be prominently displayed on the doors & windows of the venue as well as 1/2 of the screens, with 4 reserved for co-sponsors. This  prop would sponsor the venue rental as well as provide funds for creating signage and swag for the event.\n\nThe event will be free to attendees with an RSVP via Lu.ma and early access to the invitation for Lil Nouns holders. Additionally, Lil Nouns holders who RSVP for the event will have a swag bag waiting for them. \n\nIdeally, this event will appeal to those already involved in the Nouns ecosystem as well as providing an opportunity for those who want to build with Lil Nouns/Nouns to ask questions and learn more.\n\n### Tentative Event Plan:\n\n10 am to Noon: Bagels & Builders meetup for Lil Nouns and other nounish DAOs, as well as Farcaster builders.\n\n12:30 pm: \"Building with Nouns\" Lunch & Learn about Lil Nouns, Nouns and Nounish DAOs (panel - more info to come) \n\n3 pm: possible prop house live -- in discussion -- or other panel discussion\n\n6 - 9 pm: PizzaDAO happy hour \n\nThe space will be open as a co-working/meet-up space throughout the day, with streams and spaces of the panels and interviews with guests.  (tenative: Aubtoshi/OTG may stream from the location and depending on timing of Noun O' Clock, we will also go live on spaces at that time.)\n\nWe will be seeking 2-4 other sponsors to round out the funding needed for food & beverage. We'll be updating about this event as we finalize plans but we wanted to get this prop up asap to secure the venue and get this event on calendars.\n\nThis event provides a great opportunity to bring together Lil Nouners/Nouners as well as to proliferate outward to other communities as the NFT/DAO space takes over Miami!\n\n\n\n## **Team**\n\nA core team of Lil Nouners who will be in Miami that week are stepping up to coordinate the event. We will provide updates as plans evolve: \n\n[Cardno](https://twitter.com/CardnoNFT)\n[Index/Modrovsky](https://twitter.com/modrovsky)\n[Lil Mike Good](https://twitter.com/GoodBeats)\n[Snax (PizzaDAO)](https://twitter.com/snack_man)\n[Prof Werder](https://twitter.com/ProfWerder)\n\n## **Transactions**\n\nVenue - Hodler Gallery 4 eth to: 0x9d2daCbd15f1D2F14ed36C4B6e374b2d496d93ff\n\n\nSignage/Swag/other event expenses - 2 eth to multisig:\n0x0178c56c5fB41C8Ea44DB5942Ae70f93E3754bf2\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJW997A1a.png)\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Implement Dynamic Quorum for Enhanced Governance",
      "content": "## tl;dr\n\nAdjusting dynamic quorum parameters would increase DAO health and should increase the percentage of successful proposals that are \"hell yes\" initiatives.\n\n## Summary\n\nI am [Milad](https://discord.com/users/284122483219759105/), and after discussing and gathering feedback from the community, I am presenting this proposal for the enhancement governance workflow of the Lil Nouns DAO:\n\nDynamic quorum enhances governance by requiring varying levels of support for proposals based on their content. Controversial proposals typically lead to higher voter turnout. Adjusting dynamic quorum parameters can incentivize greater participation and delegation, thereby improving the health of the DAO.\n\nIn version 1 of the DAO contract, quorum was a fixed percentage of the total supply. In version 2, the quorum is dynamic, increasing against votes up to a defined cap. Despite upgrading to version 2, these changes remain unimplemented.\n\nIn this proposal, we advocate for setting the Maximum Quorum at 15% and reducing the Minimum Quorum to 5%.\n\n\n## Dynamic Quorum Parameters\n\nAs articulated in this [detailed post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE), three parameters determine dynamic quorum:\n\n* **Minimum quorum %:** We propose reducing it to 5%, making it easier for uncontroversial proposals to pass.\n* **Maximum quorum %:** We recommend setting it to 15% to ensure a majority can decide the outcome of contentious proposals.\n* **Coefficient:** This should be set to 1, causing each against vote to raise the quorum requirement by one vote until the maximum quorum is reached.\n\nThese parameters can be edited anytime via a proposal; treat these values as the first experiment.\n\n## Proposal Transactions for Humans\n\n**setDynamicQuorumParams** will adjust dynamic quorum parameters as follows:\n\n* **Minimum quorum BPs**: 5% (500 basis points).\n* **Maximum quorum BPs**: 15% (1500 basis points).\n* **Coefficient**: 1 (1,000,000 in unsigned integer with six decimal places).\n",

      "title": "Implement Automation for Tracking Governance Activities",
      "content": "al409 is sponsoring this proposal on behalf of Milad\n\n## tl;dr\n\nThis proposal suggests the creation of additional bots to keep members informed about governance activities related to DAO.\n\n## Summary\n\nI am [Milad](https://discord.com/users/284122483219759105/), and I am presenting this proposal for the development and upkeep of more bots tailored for the Lil Nouns DAO:\n\n* **Prop Lot Bot:** This bot will gather new ideas from Lil Nouns' [official prop lot](https://lilnouns.proplot.wtf/) and share relevant posts within the designated channel.\n* **Prop House Bot:** Tasked with collating new proposals from upcoming Lil Nouns' [official house](https://prop.house/lil-nouns) rounds, this bot will promptly relay them to a specified channel.\n\n## Why do we need them?\n\nThe necessity for these bots arises from the fact that most active members are already active on **Discord**. Experience has shown that broadcasting on-chain proposal announcements positively impacts voter participation. Regrettably, we currently lack any automated means to inform our Discord members about other avenues of involvement and the latest developments in our **Prop Lot** and **Prop House**.\n\n## What am I going to do next?\n\nMy plan entails implementing these bots within a six-week timeframe after the approval of this proposal. Subsequently, I commit to maintaining them and addressing any bugs related to the implementation for one year. Depending on further feature requests, I will decide whether to integrate them within the current proposal or seek additional funding for their performance.\n\n## What else would be considered?\n\nExpanding to other platforms, like Farcaster, will be considered, and future development efforts will be reduced to implementing those platforms.\n\nCompliance with relevant data protection regulations in the implementations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to protect user privacy would be ensured.\n\nThe previously built frameworks and solutions that are accessible will be assessed during first week. They will be integrated if they align with the project's timeline and budget.\n\nTwo major bot frameworks, [Nerman](https://nouns.wtf/vote/77) and [BotFrens](https://nouns.wtf/vote/144), already implemented for Nouns, do not possess the features proposed in this proposal.\n\nThe software code will be made available to the public under a permissive license. The code will be open source, thereby encouraging collaboration and transparency.\n\nThis proposal may involve budget allocation for future maintenance after the initial year, establishing a dedicated maintenance team, or exploring community-driven contributions to maintain the bots' functionality and security.\n\n\n\n## What is the budget and costing structure?\n\nThe minimum cost for reliable hosting services is approximately $150 annually. Including taxes, hosting these bots for the next five years under this proposal's financial framework totals roughly $1,000.\n\nAdditional expenses encompass bot development, maintenance, essential updates for the next year, and minor features and improvements, all encompassed within the scope of this proposal.\n\n**2.69 ETH** to **0x9e0e9D25a5ED9bc773f91691f0b45599255257B1**",

This is my first prop so please don't be too harsh (jk the more critical the better, please vote with reason!). \n\nI want to help build out the design resources we have and elevate our current materials (UI, logos, template graphics, short animations etc.) by working alongside community members to create materials the DAO actually wants/needs. \n\nFor e.g. this month, in addition to grabbing references from all over the place and hacking stuff together, I have been helping with some new Prop House graphics/GIFs, ETH Chicago Prop designs for stickers and keychains, Lil Minions GIFs, and new Lil Traits Gifs amongst other things. Have also given away a Lil Noun via BitNouns Prop 1: https://www.bitnouns.wtf/vote/0x3982fcb51c911d4cb5d3fed81209f8380d5c066a49f4566292308c662c0de2bf\n\nDeliverables\n- Large Brand Reference Book (ongoing document)\n- Brand Design System built on Figma \n- Guidebook for designing in the Public Domain - using Lils as the focus (long term goal 2024/2025) \n\nThese deliverables are in addition to producing the graphics, GIFs, UI, UX improvements requested by the community. Will upload and tag Lil stuff on Giphy https://giphy.com/channel/60r90\n\nAsking for 0.5 ETH per month to pursue this design research and development project for Lil Nouns. I am proposing this as a quarterly prop but this first one includes additional retroactive funding for the month of August. I have documented my past month's work in the beginnings of the Reference Book here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1twd9xXi2Gp9HA7UZ6BgPFSSlt25KN-AVlbVhQ4mE04A/edit#slide=id.g1e60c803d3f_0_59\n\nSome highlights from the above link for those too busy to click:\n\n![LIL](https://media0.giphy.com/media/M4S59Yty0JX6s4XaM5/giphy.gif \"LIL\")\n\n\n![LIL](https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExMGN6M3Yxd2lpaHMxZzc5em12MjY1N3JjbWllcHJ3dXU2Mjlvbnc5ayZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/kLgNyjSCeg1ub0NU18/giphy.gif \"LIL\")\n\n\n![LIL](https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExbW11Y2t5b2VuYWhsMW91cWVmb3l4aWJzeDZibGl2NDdrbmJ1MXhtaSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/rM1mPKyR1MxJAG7vny/giphy.gif \"LIL\")\n\n\n![LIL](https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExemgwanc3MTNhYnYwNmhlZmhkZGh5cmx3eG0wdmt1M2xlaWtlcDU3MyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/L0TmaelnMhvIUTPoUh/giphy.gif \"LIL\")\n\n\n![LIL](https://media4.giphy.com/media/x1HACvUrMq2IBT7kGF/giphy.gif \"LIL\") \n\n\n![LIL](https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExa3d4YnU4Z3dqMW0zdnk1eXNyYWxha3N2bjFsdXQ2eDQ1bXpoMjJ0bSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/ZsPI1yKguUdDNcF8oa/giphy.gif \"LIL\") \n \n\n![LIL](https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExM2xjbmtoMjBxcGN1ZW9yaHJkdng4M3NkazJlaHZ2ank0eWFvYWc1YiZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/duWva744mjhB4Opuma/giphy.gif \"LIL\")\n\n\n![LIL](https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZmI3dmQybjdrb2YxYTlsMnJlNGNhN2kwOHF2NmE0Y2tqN3doa3RiZyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/5u33dzr3vov3eR6Sk2/giphy.gif \"LIL\")\n\n\n![LIL](https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExN25vZ2pwdWFtM21jN2xzcXR0YW4zaXAxeXc1OHQ1OHEwcnl1ZWNqeCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/UXyVM5HkQn1fSzUlBz/giphy.gif \"LIL\")\n\n![LIL](https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExaWloNHczajdhbG8wa2ZsZzFyOWI5c2Z3aDc0azF5YmV4NmVwM2hucSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/k3zoHBZDQ1fYUIeVs0/giphy.gif \"LIL\")\n\n![LIL](https://media0.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNm05aXl6M2JwOXI3dzhzbXU3MHpwbjB2ejQ5cnA1ZG1zdHVqbXZ6ZiZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/MnBqfRErPrmf9azhLr/giphy.gif \"LIL\")\n\nI plan to focus the month of September on creating and collating design requirements (talking with individuals in/out of the DAO who may need help for e.g.) and planning all upcoming design projects and timelines. \n\nFrom September 4th I will also commence the first few weeks of the Alphabet Superset where I will be producing Lil related content on a weekly basis. Read more about it here: https://www.alphabetsuperset.com/\n\nI think/hope this is a comfortable ask within the DAO’s current “budget” as I would rather grow with the DAO than deplete it. I will be able to spend a minimum of a day a week on this (will stream some via Twitch, my first video is putting up this prop: https://www.twitch.tv/borg00000 ) and if the opportunity arises to scale up the design role then I have ample time and am very motivated to do so. \n\nI would also like to own up to onboarding mikegood.eth to Nouns so I want to apologise or say you're welcome, depending on who is reading this.\n\n![LIL](https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNjA4ajUyY3VlNWp2b2NwcWs4YTNtZ2VoaGptdWdyZ2ZveHM2OGtmZSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/Ci0HCtv8AZjlhDymjl/giphy.gif \"LIL\")",

      "content": "## Resubmitted after discussions with key voters in the DAO.\n\n- Extended duration by 25%\n- Retro for 3 weeks included\n- Ask changed\n\n## TL;DR\n\n- # **The most listened to weekly twitter spaces show in the Nouns ecosystem**\n- # **13,101 listeners across 36 shows**\n- # **The #1 most listened to #Soapbox on The Noun Square**\n\n**The outwardly facing mouthpiece of the DAO; providing a platform, via twitter spaces, for our own and external communities to learn from each other, with a view of growing the Lil Nouns brand**\n\n\n## What is The Lil Nouns Show?\n\n- [The Lil Nouns Show](https://twitter.com/TheLilNounsShow) is a weekly Lil Nouns centered twitter spaces show, hosted on [The Noun Square](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare) to enable us to reach a wider variety of communities.\n- The show consists of a team of four co-hosts who also take on the roles of researchers, operations and guest bookings.\n- The show looks to position itself as the customer facing ‘front of house’ for Lil Nouns DAO and has done so for the last 9 months.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/HF1PCsy/87-BONES-DISCORD.png)\n\n\n## Prior Funding\n\n- [Lil Funding](https://www.addressform.io/board/details/689ad3b5-7a88-4ad0-8ba0-4d57703d7636/the-lil-nouns-show-retro-funding-pilot-month/2927) - We have completed a one month, four episode pilot in which we received retro funding at a cost to the DAO of 0.125 ETH per host, per episode. Totalling 2 ETH.\n- [On Chain Proposal](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/68) - Proposal 68 was an on chain proposal to Lil Nouns DAO that passed **1185 votes** to 334. A total of 47 unique addresses voted ‘for’ with just 4 addresses voting ‘against’ making it one of the most successful proposals in Lil Nouns DAO history. There were no abstain votes recorded.\n- [On Chain Proposal](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/94) - Proposal 94 was an on chain second term funding proposal to Lil Nouns DAO that passed **1506 votes** to 337. This proposal gained more votes than the previous one and as a percentage performed better than our first proposal. A good sign that we are doing things of value!\n- [On Chain Proposal](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/120) - Proposal 120 was an on chain third funding proposal to Lil Nouns DAO that passed **1226 votes** to 477. \n\n## What have we been doing?\nWe have consistently and collectively worked as hard as possible to position Lil Nouns squarely in the thoughts of other like-minded communities, in an effort to keep our DAO visible.\n\nIn doing so, we have become the 'go-to' weekly show in the Nouns ecosystem to host project founders, artists, proposers and everyone in-between. This is something we are proud of, and we believe this visibility will across web3 will serve us well when the markets pick up.\n\n## What are we going to do next?\nAll the feedback we have received over Term 3 has been overwhelmingly positive. In fact, we have received no negative feedback on our performance from the DAO over this period. That is not to say we can’t do better.\n\nWe will remain at our current cadence of one show, every Monday at 6pm EST, throughout the next period of funding. We have had great success in this slot and less for a few changes to accommodate what we regard as great guests, we have remained fairly consistent in this approach.\n\nSince our last funding refill, Lil Nouns has bought a Noun (taking our holdings up to 16) and the treasury has remained fairly stable since our last prop. It was forecast then, that at this point we would have little to no ETH and that Lil Nouns DAO would cease to exist, let alone function. This has turned out to be an incorrect assumption and through projects like The Lil Nouns Show, Lil Nouns has remained relevant at a time when most other NFT projects are disappearing from the space. \n\nLil Nouns is currently at a juncture. The bear market has stalled the progress of many projects and this can be seen in the treasury amount. That being said, Lil Nouns as a DAO have decided upon a path to boost Nouns holdings up to 15 (soon to be 16). Taking into account the ETH spent on the procurement of those Nouns, Lil Nouns is in a healthy position.\n\nIn our last prop we said - “The DAO will not continue to function as an entity if nobody is part of it or indeed, knows about it. We will continue to encourage voter participation on all of our shows and explain in detail how important it is to the survival of the project we all love.” and we still believe this to be true today. \n\n- We will remain on our usual Monday 6pm EST slot;\n- We will continue to expose Lil Nouns to other web3 communities;\n- We will engage with those in our community without a voice and give them a stage to speak; and\n- We will to be a focal point on twitter for those seeking more information about our DAO\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/8DNgSPh/PROF-DISCORD.png)\n\n## The Lil Nouns Show format\nWe currently run a 50/50 structure on our shows.

Since then I have become obsessed with how this dream of an open-source brand can succeed. Outside of this world my background is in PR & communications (in-house & agency side) having worked for many years in Amsterdam and London, before following my other passion (skiing) and moving to the other side of the world. \n- **Cardno** - I entered the space in late 2021. I initially became aware of NFTs through the visibility on twitter of BAYC (of course) and after falling into the ‘Fast Food Punks’ discord, (strange, I know) I found myself on a call with the founder within 10 minutes, and being given an NFT 101 chat from him. I was onboarded. Since then, I have been a moderator of various projects such as 3Landers, Chimpers, Lorem and Sugartown. I have also been the host of the official 3Landers twitter spaces show. I am currently a signer for the Lil Funding Gnosis wallet in Lil Nouns and have also seen out a term as a Lil Representative.I also am entrusted with the role of ‘League of Lils’ which means I am on the multi sig for the wallet our DAO uses to place its votes with Nouns DAO. \n- **Crxsher** - I entered the space in February 2021, first in crypto, then in NFTs on Harmony, and finally in Ethereum in April. My first purchase was a piece of Sandbox land, which I then traded for two BAYC Apes, and the rest is history. I’ve had a few successes, made many mistakes, but what has never wavered is my belief that Web3 constitutes a major shift in how the world will interact in the future. I’m a frequent guest on many Twitter spaces in addition to co-hosting the 3Landers spaces, hoping to share, engage, learn and grow as we move forward in NFTs. I’m most active these days in BAYC, Ghxsts, Chimpers, Zen Academy and Lil Nouns, although you’ll find me engaging in several others as well.\n- **English** - I entered this space as a research consultant for a friend who was looking to leverage their musical IP assets in web 3. Upon my research I engaged with multiple communities and ended up moderating for 3landers and Lorem. I am currently working with a web2 gaming company looking to launch their first nft project.\n## Social media handles:\n- **Twitter**: [@april_xyz_](https://twitter.com/april_xyz_) **Discord**: april || pinklobster.eth#5026\n- **Twitter**: [@CardnoNFT](https://twitter.com/CardnoNFT) **Discord**: Cardno#0446\n- **Twitter**: [@CryptoCrusher6](https://twitter.com/CryptoCrusher6) **Discord**: Crxsher#3174\n- **Twitter**: [@EnglishNFTea](https://twitter.com/EnglishNFTea) **Discord**: English#0943\n## Compensation Model\nTeam reward:\nApril - Co-Host / Guest Booking / Operations - 5.5 ETH\nCardno - Co-Host / Operations / Guest Booking - 5.5 ETH\nCrxsher - Co-Host / Guest Booking 3.5 ETH\nEnglish - Main Host / Guest Booking 5.5 ETH\n- 16 Episodes (one TLNS show each week)\n## Total\n## 20 ETH\n\nIf anyone has any questions regarding this proposal, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with one of us via the discord or twitter handles above, and we will be happy to answer any questions prior to you voting. \n",

The vote still takes place in the case of insufficient ETH to refund.\n3. **Voting Delay Editing Bug Fix**: In V1, editing voting delay was unsafe. V2 makes it safe to edit anytime. More info on the bug [here](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-diligence/blob/main/reports/proposal-58.md#major).\n4. **Cancel Proposal Bug Fix**: The DAO has a spam mitigation feature, allowing anyone to cancel a proposal if the proposer has an amount of votes less than or equal to proposal threshold. In V1, this feature didn't work when proposer had exactly proposal threshold votes; in V2 it works as expected.\nVetoer Change Is Now 2-step: Nouns received audit feedback that V1's vetoer change process was risky as a single-step process. In V2, the risk of setting a wrong vetoer is mitigated using a 2-step process where the current vetoer sets a pending new vetoer. Once set, the pending vetoer must accept for the change to take place.\n\n## Audit (Nouns DAO)\n1. The code has gone through internal reviews and a [code4rena audit](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-08-nounsdao/).\n2. **No high-risk issues were found in V2.**\n3.**Unrelated to this proposal**, one high-risk issue was found. See [this audit summary on discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-dao-v2-audit-summary/2525) for more information.\n\n## Dynamic Quorum Parameters\nAs articulated in this detailed post, three parameters need to be set for dynamic quorum.\nThis proposal sets all parameters to match the current 10% base quorum and therefore does not activate dynamic quorum. All three parameters can be edited at any time via proposal.\n\n1. **Minimum quorum %**: set to 10%.\n2. **Maximum quorum %**: set to 10%.\n3. **Coefficient**: set to 0.\n\n## Vote with Gas Refund\nA bit more on how this feature works:\n\n1.  Governance clients (like lilnouns.wtf/vote) need to update their code to support it.\n2.  Refunds are subject to certain constraints:\n    1.  Gas base fee is capped at 200 gwei.\n    2.  Gas priority fee is capped at 2 gwei.\n    3.  Total gas is capped at 200K, supporting voting reason text up to roughly 9,190 characters.\n    4.  If the contract’s balance is insufficient, voter will receive a partial refund.\n3.  This feature requires the DAO to maintain the DAO contract’s (nounsDAOProxy) ETH balance, which should be done via periodic ETH transfer proposals from the treasury to the DAO contract (this proposal performs the first funding).\n4.  The DAO can choose to withdraw refund ETH back into the treasury at any time via a proposal.\n\n## Proposal Transactions for Humans\n1.  `_setImplementation`: upgrades DAO logic to V2.\n2.  `_setDynamicQuorumParams`: sets dynamic quorum params to:\n    1.  Minimum quorum BPs: 10% (1000 basis points).\n    2. Maximum quorum BPs: 10% (1000 basis points).\n    3. Coefficient: 0.\n3. `transfer`: funding vote refunds with 5 ETH.",

      "content": "## TL;DR\n\n- # **The most listened to weekly twitter spaces show in the Nouns ecosystem**\n- # **13,101 listeners across 36 shows**\n- # **The #1 most listened to #Soapbox on The Noun Square**\n\n**The outwardly facing mouthpiece of the DAO; providing a platform, via twitter spaces, for our own and external communities to learn from each other, with a view of growing the Lil Nouns brand**\n\n\n## What is The Lil Nouns Show?\n\n- [The Lil Nouns Show](https://twitter.com/TheLilNounsShow) is a weekly Lil Nouns centered twitter spaces show, hosted on [The Noun Square](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare) to enable us to reach a wider variety of communities.\n- The show consists of a team of four co-hosts who also take on the roles of researchers, operations and guest bookings.\n- The show looks to position itself as the customer facing ‘front of house’ for Lil Nouns DAO and has done so for the last 9 months.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/HF1PCsy/87-BONES-DISCORD.png)\n\n\n## Prior Funding\n\n- [Lil Funding](https://www.addressform.io/board/details/689ad3b5-7a88-4ad0-8ba0-4d57703d7636/the-lil-nouns-show-retro-funding-pilot-month/2927) - We have completed a one month, four episode pilot in which we received retro funding at a cost to the DAO of 0.125 ETH per host, per episode. Totalling 2 ETH.\n- [On Chain Proposal](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/68) - Proposal 68 was an on chain proposal to Lil Nouns DAO that passed **1185 votes** to 334. A total of 47 unique addresses voted ‘for’ with just 4 addresses voting ‘against’ making it one of the most successful proposals in Lil Nouns DAO history. There were no abstain votes recorded.\n- [On Chain Proposal](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/94) - Proposal 94 was an on chain second term funding proposal to Lil Nouns DAO that passed **1506 votes** to 337. This proposal gained more votes than the previous one and as a percentage performed better than our first proposal. A good sign that we are doing things of value!\n- [On Chain Proposal](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/120) - Proposal 120 was an on chain third funding proposal to Lil Nouns DAO that passed **1226 votes** to 477. \n\n## What have we been doing?\nWe have consistently and collectively worked as hard as possible to position Lil Nouns squarely in the thoughts of other like-minded communities, in an effort to keep our DAO visible.\n\nIn doing so, we have become the 'go-to' weekly show in the Nouns ecosystem to host project founders, artists, proposers and everyone in-between. This is something we are proud of, and we believe this visibility will across web3 will serve us well when the markets pick up.\n\n## What are we going to do next?\nAll the feedback we have received over Term 3 has been overwhelmingly positive. In fact, we have received no negative feedback on our performance from the DAO over this period. That is not to say we can’t do better.\n\nWe will remain at our current cadence of one show, every Monday at 6pm EST, throughout the next period of funding. We have had great success in this slot and less for a few changes to accommodate what we regard as great guests, we have remained fairly consistent in this approach.\n\nSince our last funding refill, Lil Nouns has bought a Noun (taking our holdings up to 16) and the treasury has remained fairly stable since our last prop. It was forecast then, that at this point we would have little to no ETH and that Lil Nouns DAO would cease to exist, let alone function. This has turned out to be an incorrect assumption and through projects like The Lil Nouns Show, Lil Nouns has remained relevant at a time when most other NFT projects are disappearing from the space. \n\nLil Nouns is currently at a juncture. The bear market has stalled the progress of many projects and this can be seen in the treasury amount. That being said, Lil Nouns as a DAO have decided upon a path to boost Nouns holdings up to 15 (soon to be 16). Taking into account the ETH spent on the procurement of those Nouns, Lil Nouns is in a healthy position.\n\nIn our last prop we said - “The DAO will not continue to function as an entity if nobody is part of it or indeed, knows about it. We will continue to encourage voter participation on all of our shows and explain in detail how important it is to the survival of the project we all love.” and we still believe this to be true today. \n\n- We will remain on our usual Monday 6pm EST slot;\n- We will continue to expose Lil Nouns to other web3 communities;\n- We will engage with those in our community without a voice and give them a stage to speak; and\n- We will to be a focal point on twitter for those seeking more information about our DAO\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/8DNgSPh/PROF-DISCORD.png)\n\n## The Lil Nouns Show format\nWe currently run a 50/50 structure on our shows.

Since then I have become obsessed with how this dream of an open-source brand can succeed. Outside of this world my background is in PR & communications (in-house & agency side) having worked for many years in Amsterdam and London, before following my other passion (skiing) and moving to the other side of the world. \n- **Cardno** - I entered the space in late 2021. I initially became aware of NFTs through the visibility on twitter of BAYC (of course) and after falling into the ‘Fast Food Punks’ discord, (strange, I know) I found myself on a call with the founder within 10 minutes, and being given an NFT 101 chat from him. I was onboarded. Since then, I have been a moderator of various projects such as 3Landers, Chimpers, Lorem and Sugartown. I have also been the host of the official 3Landers twitter spaces show. I am currently a signer for the Lil Funding Gnosis wallet in Lil Nouns and have also seen out a term as a Lil Representative.I also am entrusted with the role of ‘League of Lils’ which means I am on the multi sig for the wallet our DAO uses to place its votes with Nouns DAO. \n- **Crxsher** - I entered the space in February 2021, first in crypto, then in NFTs on Harmony, and finally in Ethereum in April. My first purchase was a piece of Sandbox land, which I then traded for two BAYC Apes, and the rest is history. I’ve had a few successes, made many mistakes, but what has never wavered is my belief that Web3 constitutes a major shift in how the world will interact in the future. I’m a frequent guest on many Twitter spaces in addition to co-hosting the 3Landers spaces, hoping to share, engage, learn and grow as we move forward in NFTs. I’m most active these days in BAYC, Ghxsts, Chimpers, Zen Academy and Lil Nouns, although you’ll find me engaging in several others as well.\n- **English** - I entered this space as a research consultant for a friend who was looking to leverage their musical IP assets in web 3. Upon my research I engaged with multiple communities and ended up moderating for 3landers and Lorem. I am currently working with a web2 gaming company looking to launch their first nft project.\n## Social media handles:\n- **Twitter**: [@april_xyz_](https://twitter.com/april_xyz_) **Discord**: april || pinklobster.eth#5026\n- **Twitter**: [@CardnoNFT](https://twitter.com/CardnoNFT) **Discord**: Cardno\n- **Twitter**: [@CryptoCrusher6](https://twitter.com/CryptoCrusher6) **Discord**: Crxsher#3174\n- **Twitter**: [@EnglishNFTea](https://twitter.com/EnglishNFTea) **Discord**: English#0943\n## Compensation Model\nContest rewards, art & miscellaneous expenses:\n- **0.0420 ETH** x 12 for the weekly giveaway\nTeam reward:\nApril - Co-Host / Guest Booking / Operations - 4.5 ETH\nCardno - Co-Host / Operations / Guest Booking - 4.5 ETH\nCrxsher - Co-Host / Guest Booking 2.5 ETH\nEnglish - Main Host / Guest Booking 4.5 ETH\n- 12 Episodes (one TLNS show each week)\n## Total\n# **16.504 ETH** **(a reduced ask from the previous proposal)**\n\n**If anyone has any questions regarding this proposal, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with one of us via the discord or twitter handles above, and we will be happy to answer any questions prior to you voting.** \n",

      "content": "**tl;dr:**\nThis upgrade gives bidders the option to leave a comment alongside their bid - preferably reasons for why they'd like to become lil nouner, what they'd add to the community, or why and how a particular lil noun caught their eye.\n\n**How it works**\nCurrently, the AuctionHouse contract takes note of key information: bid amount, bidder, time of bid, whether the bid increased auction time (a last-minute bid), and for every bid, emits them as an `AuctionBid` contract event. This gives off-chain services (like frontends or analytic tools) the ability to provide relevant auction information to their users. This upgrade adds an additional string field to the `AuctionBid` contract event so that comments associated with a given bid can be surfaced alongside other key auction information.\n\n**example of lilnouns.wtf running BidWithComment upgrade**\n![auction starts](https://i.postimg.cc/4djFgMkf/lil22.png)\n\n![post auction](https://i.postimg.cc/wTD6Kjky/Screenshot-2023-06-16-at-03-00-20.png)\n\n![post auction bids](https://i.postimg.cc/pVw21FKM/Screenshot-2023-06-16-at-03-01-11.png)\n\nh/t to Zora for their `MintWithComment` update.

      "title": "Lil Nouns Barcelona ⌐◨-◨ ",
      "content": "# General Description \n\nETHBarcelona takes place in Spain from July 5th to 9th. I was selected as a speaker for Nouns during the  event, presenting an opportunity to introduce lil nouns to Spanish speakers and build the nounish  community in Spain. We propose the first side-event sponsored by lilnouns, talking about lil nouns during  the speak, and a full Lil nouns proliferation during this summer week. \n\n# GOALS \nBuild the Nouns and Lil Nouns community in Barcelona, Spain \nHold a speak/workshop about Nouns at ETHBarcelona \nFirst side-event sponsored by lil nouns in Spain \nProliferate Lil Nouns with merchandise and entertaining content in the streets of Spain \n\n# WTF ETHBarcelona? \n\nETHBarcelona is a community-led passion project about the Ethereum blockchain, cryptocurrency, and  decentralization that celebrates the community and its values. It focuses on education, innovation, art, and  creating positive social impact. The goal is to give people the tools they need to further their knowledge in  blockchain technology and learn how to build projects that can make an impact on society. \n\n- Website: <https://www.ethbarcelona.com/>\n- Date: July 5-9, 2023 \n\n![lil-barcelona-header](https://i.postimg.cc/mDPBS3fW/image3.png)\n\n# Speak \n\nThe talk aims to onboard new builders to NounsDAO. This time, the theme of the ETHBarcelona event is  \"solarpunk and lunarpunk\", meaning Blockchain technology, crypto, and web3 are seen as a means to  achieve maximum human potential sustainably. We will adjust the talk or workshop to the theme of the  event, explaining from my experience how being accepted as a speaker led me to make my first on-chain  proposal and build a new community around lil nouns on another continent.\n\nVIDEO HERE: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPpPZeQXHkg>\n\nDuring the talk, we will also project an introductory video from @nounish, discuss the ideas that have been  created in Nouns, the subdaos emphasizing lil nouns, and finally leave a nounish impression on the  audience to encourage them to start creating with Nouns. \n\n# Problem: \n\nWe have identified a problem that we seek to solve with this proposal. Few people in Spain know about  Nouns (consequently about lil nouns) even though there's a great creative and technical potential to start  building. \n\n# Solution: \n\nAwaken a lil nounish spirit in the communities of Spain, through the speak and activities described in the  next sections \n\n# Lil Side-Event \n\nPrior to ETHBarcelona, crypto communities in Spain like @CryptonikasDAO, @DoinGud, @ShapeShift,  and more will host a beach party called \"NOT YOUR BIKINI, NOT YOUR ETH\". Nouns have been  invited to participate as a sponsor. If lil nouns are a sponsor, the lil noggles will be on the event flyer,  featured in the visuals, providing free access to the Nouns community and doing a lil activation giving  away merchandise. \n\n![lil-barcelona-side-event](https://i.postimg.cc/zB452L8b/image4.jpg)\n\n# Merchandise \nThroughout the 7 days, we aim to distribute lil merch, both at ETHBarcelona, at the side-event, and during  street activities. A total of 100 T-Shirts +  2000 stickers will be distributed The sticker and T-Shirts  designs will feature 4 lil nouns with a summer theme. We will wear these T-shirts throughout the week. \n\n![lil-barcelona-merch](https://i.postimg.cc/brbP7zw6/image5.jpg)\n\nWe will also give away 3 POAPs created by the nounish artist who won the comic contest in the lil prop  house, @kimmydeuk. These will be given away during events and in activities. The POAP designs will be  shared in the lil nouns Discord. \n\n# On-Street Dynamic \n\nWe will carry out a fun dynamic in the street, approaching non-crypto-web3 people with random questions  such as \"do you know what web3 is?\" \"do you know what lil nouns are?\" conducting interviews, taking  pictures of the entire process. We'll bring along the classic noggles from nounworks.wtf to ask them \"would  you take a photo with these glasses?\"\n\nThe content will be published on social media like TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter, with the goal of  proliferating lil nouns beyond the event. We will also be giving away merch and sticking stickers on street  walls. The content can be found on our personal accounts and on The Noun Square in Spanish social media  accounts, where the lilnouns accounts will be tagged. \n\n- Instagram: <https://www.instagram.com/thenounsquaresp/>\n- TikTok: <https://www.tiktok.com/@thenounsquaresp>\n- Twitter: <https://twitter.com/TheNounSquareSp>\n \nThe video format will be vertical. We'll combine IRL photography with Lil Nouns GIFs. We will have the  support of @graphicography_ in the video editing. We will send the IRL activation content to be combined  with funny animated lil nouns (wait for it), featuring iconic traits of active lil noun members and the  community representative. \n\nAttached you will find a couple of videos made previously by us, the first being   a compilation of photographs taken in the course of a month. These may also be found on @nounworks's Instagram. The second is an activation at Hackaton Universitario de México. Via this proposal, we seek to innovate by including gifs and activations on the street.\n\nVideo I: <https://www.tiktok.com/@thenounsquaresp/video/7222349018926435589>\nVideo II: <https://www.tiktok.com/@thenounsquaresp/video/7199801903927020806>\n\n# Budget \n\nTo make this a reality, we have considered in the budget: 1) sponsor costs, 2) merchandise, 3) travel costs  and expenses, 4) designs and video edition. The budget was calculated in  EUROS, converted to Dollars, and then equivalent to ETH at the rate of 1850 USD when preparing the  budget.\n\n![lil-barcelona-budget](https://i.postimg.cc/WpJsF7wM/image2.png)\n\n*Costs are approximate\n\n# Impact \n\nThe execution of the proposal will have an impact on Nouns as well as Lil Nouns, as it's the first time that  a Nouns proliferation is proposed in Spain and participation in one of Spain's most important Web3 events.  The results will reflect in the birth of a new lil nouns community, with creative ideas proposed to the DAO,  participation in auctions, and an IRL nounish feeling experienced by the future generations of builders who  will be onboarded. \n\nThe outcomes expected from this proposal are as follows:\n\n- Onboarding +500 builders during ETHBarcelona\n- An active community of nouns and lil nouns in Spain\n- Content with the potential to go viral on social networks that proliferate lil nouns\n- New lil nouns proposals on-chain and in the prop house (local meetups, art, technology and more)\n\nAdditionally, we plan to connect with 𝘿𝙤𝙞𝙣𝙂𝙪𝙙 communities, blockravers, cryptonikas and nifty club as they are key in the blockchain ecosystem in Spain and worldwide. A dream team will be organizing the side event, whereby lil nouns, as the main sponsor, will induce everyone to talk about the nouns party during ETH Barcelona.\n\n![lil-barcelona-timeline](https://i.postimg.cc/8CKTWKYb/image1.png)\n\n# Who is proposing this? \n\n@leobunster - Active member of Nouns Amigos, experienced in hosting IRL events in Latin America such  as Colombia, Mexico and local activations, currently building the permissionless version of The Noun  Square in Spanish (TNS in Spanish) \n\n@blakneit - Active member of Nouncil and Nouns Amigos, has written over 120 articles on Nouns in  Spanish and English, creator of newsletters like Lil Nouns in Spanish (Noticiero Lil Nouns) and The Noun  Square Summaries (@squaresummaries), currently resides in Barcelona \n\n@tomketal - Community Builder Doingud, Artist Relationship Manager Bueno Art, Community Champion  Algorand Spain, ETHBarcelona Comms Lead.

      "content": "## TL;DR:\nDelivery of 50 LilNouns GIFs & MP4s for 3ETH from LiamDraws (Liam from Nounish) specifically catered to the LilNouns community.\n\n## WHY?\nOver the past 8 months, I have had the pleasure and opportunity to work for Nounish, creating numerous videos, content, and hundreds of Nounish GIFs. All of these creations were made using the NounsDAO Noggles and were specifically tailored for Nouners.\n\nThrough my active participation in the Nouns and LilNouns communities on Twitter, I have firsthand experience with the extensive sharing and utilisation of these GIFs to spread the meme across the internet. However, I noticed a lack of the same high-quality treatment for LilNouns GIFs. With permission from Nounish, I have decided to invest my personal time to rectify this and provide the LilNouns Noggle GIFs with the attention and effort they deserve (with a LilNounish flair).\n\n![The Hobbit](https://media.giphy.com/media/vtkS5ujworABGblPwG/giphy.gif)\n\nNounish GIFs have proven to be an effective means of proliferation, as demonstrated by the Nounish Giphy page amassing over 126 million views alone.\n\n## WHO?\nMy name is Liam, and I have over a decade of experience in the video and digital media landscape, specialising in motion graphics and VFX. Over the last 8 months, I have utilised these skills at Nounish to breathe life into Nounish GIFs and videos. Here are a few of my personal favourites as examples of my work. \n\n![Dwight](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExcHIxMXA0bnc3eTF1ZnpwbzZuOHQ0cmJ6eWpmbnoycTI2YWZpc3dpbCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/2ckn6cdadLvOAKPz67/giphy.gif)\n\n![Kramer](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExbXhhN3d6cWRsaXRsaGhscmNuMTFpMHZ3dzEwc3k5YW4waGgwbWtyeCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/DR1WJs5BlozM20aKzr/giphy.gif)\n\n## CONTENT\nCommitting to deliver all 50 GIFs in small batches over a 3 month period. My primary focus will be on creating LilNouns content that aligns with the daily needs and preferences of the LilNouns community.\n\nThe forefront of my approach will be community requests. I will actively engage with the LilNouns community via Twitter and Discord to ensure that the GIFs I create cater to the desires of LilNouners.\n\nI firmly believe that 3ETH for creating 50 bespoke LilNouns GIFs is a fair reflection of the time, expertise, and experience I will invest in this project. \n\n![TheKids](https://media.giphy.com/media/aVJF6EauTdbh0SjAdV/giphy.gif)\n\n## BONUS\nTo provide transparency and inclusiveness, I will stream my GIF creation process on **[TWITCH](https://twitch.tv/liamdraws_)** and Discord. This will not only grant the LilNouns community behind-the-scenes access to the process but also expand the proliferation of the meme to a new platform simultaneously.\n\n## DISTRIBUTION\nI will make all the GIFs I create publicly accessible on **[GIPHY](https://giphy.com/channel/LilNounsGifs)** and **[TENOR](https://tenor.com/en-GB/users/lilnounsgifs)** under @LilNounsGifs and Lilnouns hashtags to maintain consistency. Additionally, I will provide a Google Drive link on the LilNouns Discord, allowing anyone interested to directly access high-quality versions of the files.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I am eagerly looking forward to commencing this project and delivering the LilNouns GIFs with the quality they deserve!\n-LiamDraws\n**[Twitter](https://twitter.com/liamgordes)**\n",

Additionally, Australia has witnessed the successful execution of numerous Nounish initiatives, including Gnars DAO, Nounish Studios, NFT Fest Aus, NFT Melbourne, and Nouns Deli.\n\n![enter image description here](http://week-days.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/LIL-NOUNS-3CANMOCKUP-1.jpg)\n\n## **The Ask ⌐◨-◨ Phase 1**\n\n8 Eth To Launch The Initial Proof Of Concept For Lil Bevs, This Will Include The Following:\n\n-   Brand Development\n-   Recipe Creation (Launch with 2 flavours)\n-   Product Mockups\n-   Custom Canning Equipment For 255ml Cans\n-   Manufacturing of 2 Lil Bevs Recipes\n-   Logistics & Distribution\n-   Lil Bevs Marketing Materials For 5 Local Events: Oshi Gallery, Nouns Deli, Upside Down DAO, NFT Melb, NFT Fest Aus (shirts, stickers, posters, koozis)\n-   Marketing Campaign leading Up To The Launch of Lil Bevs\n-   Nouns Tap Technology NFC Stickers.

      "content": "*TLDR: Since the Lil Nouns no longer have a functioning newsletter, I want to represent Lil Nouns news via a partnership with my newsletter, The BCheque Papers.*\n\n**For 3 sponsored editions out of 4 each month (the 1st edition of each month is sponsored by Chimpers) and for an agreement which would last 6 months, it would cost 1 ETH per month: 18 sponsored newsletters; 6 ETH total streamed across the 6 months (cancellable at any point after one month via a new prop) This work would start 8th May 2023 with the payment stream beginning 14th May 2023**\n\n**This would secure Lil Nouns:\n(i) position as a headline partner; and \n(ii) a sponsored post in each sponsored newsletter.**\n## **The Newsletter Details:** \n\n- written for 67 weeks in a row \n- 1,800+ subscribers \n- 1,100 - 1,300 views per week \n- +40% open rate \n- first major partner is Chimpers \n\n## **Who Am I:** \n\nI am a qualified teacher and commercial lawyer in the UK. I have been a successful NFT trader in the space since early 2021. Now I manage my assets, write my newsletter every Friday, and produce my daily news segment 'The Snapshot' every day on Twitter for my 5,000+ followers.\n\nSome of the most prominent leaders & creators in the space have recognised my work:\n\n**NFTStats from PROOF:**\n![](https://i.ibb.co/RbJ1dsq/nftstatsfromproof.png)\n**Signal from The Nifty:**\n![](https://i.ibb.co/QN12XLS/nifty.png)\n**Tyler from Lucky Trader:** ![](https://i.ibb.co/SwC8gQm/tyler.png)\n\nFinally, I am a regular contributor in the Lil Nouns community as I share my daily Snapshot of news in the chat each day, and I have also supported the wider ecosystem by appearing on both TNS and TLNS where I was asked to share my journey as a solopreneur building out my writing business.\n\n## **How would the partnership work?**\n\n(i) At the very top of each sponsored newsletter there will be a banner with the Lil Nouns logo ![](https://i.ibb.co/6Xjyjz1/lilnounsheader.png)\n\n(ii) Each sponsored newsletter will contain a [sponsored post](https://bcheque.substack.com/p/the-memes-smash-75000000-marketcap) about something interesting happening in the Lil Nouns ecosystem that week ![](https://i.ibb.co/qyLTXmM/lilnounscontent.png)\n\n(iii) 3 sponsored editions out of 4 each month (the 1st edition of each month is sponsored by Chimpers)\n\n(iv) Each sponsored newsletter would be shared more widely on Twitter via a thread. This is how I turned a [sponsored post for Chimpers](https://twitter.com/BCheque1/status/1646219145795743745?s=20 ) into a successful thread (97 likes; 25 retweets; 2 bookmarks)\n\n## **How will we measure success?** \n\nSubstack provides excellent data. \n\nThis graph shows since the turn of the year I have grown by more than 600 subscribers. ![](https://i.ibb.co/RpZrD0h/graph.png)\n\nI will continue to monitor this and do my best to push growth - as I have been for the last 67 weeks. \n\nIn addition, I will work with the DAO to optimise for the best content and CTAs as we learn more from reader reactions to the content. \n\n## **Why is this so important?**\n\n - Lil Nouns needs more media outside of its bubble. I can provide an audience - and keep growing an audience - that will be looking at Lil Nouns with fresh eyes. \n- Lil Nouns is complicated. I am uniquely positioned to clarify some of this DAO's complexities. \n- Lil Nouns needs more written content for us to rally around. We no longer have a newsletter. We don't have routine written content which is easily shareable. This has to be rectified to proliferate the meme. \n\n## **Helpful links**\n \n[Newsletter with example of sponsorship](https://bcheque.substack.com/p/the-memes-smash-75000000-marketcap) \n[Archive of 67 newsletters](https://bcheque.substack.com/archive) \n[Example of The Snapshot](https://twitter.com/BCheque1/status/1636671047972925440?s=20) \n[Chimpers Partnership details](https://twitter.com/BCheque1/status/1628854737448869889?s=20)\n",

      "title": "Lil Nouns DAO V2 Upgrade",
      "content": "tl;dr: This is a proposal to bring Nouns DAO's V2 upgrades to Lil Nouns.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal updates the Lil Nouns' Nouns DAO logic contract to a new version, with the following improvements and additions:\n\n1.  **Dynamic Quorum**: In V1, quorum is a fixed percentage of total supply. In V2, quorum has a dynamic range, rising as a function of against votes up to a defined cap. Read [this post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE) for more info.\n2.  **Vote with Gas Refund**: Allow Lil Nouners/delegates to vote and receive a gas refund. The vote still takes place in the case of insufficient ETH to refund.\n3.  **Voting Delay Editing Bug Fix**: In V1, editing voting delay was unsafe. V2 makes it safe to edit anytime. More info on the bug [here](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-diligence/blob/main/reports/proposal-58.md#major).\n4.  **Cancel Proposal Bug Fix**: The DAO has a spam mitigation feature, allowing anyone to cancel a proposal if the proposer has an amount of votes less than or equal to proposal threshold. In V1, this feature didn't work when proposer had exactly proposal threshold votes; in V2 it works as expected.\n5.  **Vetoer Change Is Now 2-step**: Nouns received audit feedback that V1's vetoer change process was risky as a single-step process. In V2, the risk of setting a wrong vetoer is mitigated using a 2-step process where the current vetoer sets a pending new vetoer. Once set, the pending vetoer must accept for the change to take place.\n\n\n## Audit (Nouns DAO)\n\n1.  The code has gone through internal reviews and a [code4rena audit](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-08-nounsdao/).\n2.  **No high-risk issues were found in V2**.\n3.  **Unrelated to this proposal**, one high-risk issue was found. See [this audit summary on discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-dao-v2-audit-summary/2525) for more information.\n\n\n## Dynamic Quorum Parameters\n\nAs articulated in this [detailed post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE), three parameters need to be set for dynamic quorum. \nThis proposal sets all parameters to match the current 10% base quorum and therefore does not activate dynamic quorum. All three parameters can be edited at any time via proposal.\n\n1.  **Minimum quorum %**: set to 10%.\n2.  **Maximum quorum %**: set to 10%. \n3.  **Coefficient**: set to 0.\n\n\n## Vote with Gas Refund\n\nA bit more on how this feature works:\n\n1.  Governance clients (like lilnouns.wtf/vote) need to update their code to support it.\n2.  Refunds are subject to certain constraints:\n    1.  Gas base fee is capped at 200 gwei.\n    2.  Gas priority fee is capped at 2 gwei.\n    3.  Total gas is capped at 200K, supporting voting reason text up to roughly 9,190 characters.\n    4.  If the contract’s balance is insufficient, voter will receive a partial refund.\n3.  This feature requires the DAO to maintain the DAO contract’s ETH balance, which should be done via periodic ETH transfer proposals from the treasury to the DAO contract (this proposal performs the first funding). 12 ETH should be enough for just over 100 proposals at a 30% participation rate.\n4.  The DAO can choose to withdraw and refund ETH back into the treasury at any time via proposal.\n\n\n## Proposal Transactions for Humans\n\n1.  `transfer`: 12 ETH to Lil Nouns' nounsDAOProxy contract for vote refunds\n2. `_setImplementation`: upgrades DAO logic to V2.\n3.  `_setDynamicQuorumParams`: sets dynamic quorum params to:\n    1.  Minimum quorum BPs: 10% (1000 basis points).\n    2.  Maximum quorum BPs: 10% (1000 basis points).\n    3.  Coefficient: 0.",

      "title": "AR Filter Challenge feat. Jon Vlogs (resubmitting due to an error)",
      "content": "**tl;dr**\n\nWe would like to request 3.2 ETH + 7 Lils to collaborate with Jon Vlogs - one of the largest content creators in Brazil - to introduce Nouns to millions of people by creating a viral online challenge using Noggles AR filter.\n\n**Description**\n\nAs we understand how important it is to spread the meme, it’s easy to understand that the **Creators Economy** is an essential part of this mission for Nouns. This industry plays a big role when it comes to gathering attention, community engagement, and awareness for whoever is building there. \n\nThat being said, with this proposal we will:\n\n**Onboard the perfect fit partner to the Nouns ecosystem, connect his huge audience to our community, and bring a lot of results and awareness for Lil Nouns.** \n\nThe name is **Jon Vlogs** and he can't wait to start collaborating!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kLSRkqF.gif)\n\nYou may recognize the name from a collab he did with the Nouns e-sports team where he streamed for more than 3k concurrent viewers on Twitch!\n\nHe is one of the pioneers as a content creator in Brazil for the past years and his history is a source of inspiration for fans and creators who are always looking to reinvent themselves.\n\n**Jon Vlogs** creates content in a lot of different verticals like lifestyle, gaming, reacts, IRL, etc and he’s literally growing on all networks, at a time when many influencers are losing followers.\n\nHe achieved **28 million views only in the last 8 days** on his TikTok “Clips Channels”. All of this content is edited and \"recycled\" from the live streams and delivered to the audience in a shorter format.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xyUmzZm.jpg)\n\n**Numbers**\n\nFollowers\n- [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@jonvlogs): 3.3M followers + 20M likes\n- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jonvlogs): 6.2M followers\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/jonvlogs): 6.8M subscribers\n- [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/jonvlogs): 1.3M followers\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jonvlogs): 497K followers\n\nViews - only in 2023\n\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jonvlogs) - stories\n\n- ~1.4M views (average)\n\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/jonvlogs) - videos\n- +13M views\n\n[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/jonvlogs) - live streams\n- 6.7k CCUs (Average Concurrent Audience)\n- ~2M hours watched\n- +280 hours transmitted\n\nCurious to see how we are going to leverage Nouns content using this HUGE audience reach? Check it out 👇\n\n**The idea:** create a weekly TikTok challenge where the audience will need to post a creative video - inspired by Jon's lifestyle content - using the noggles AR filter, and post it using our campaign hashtags: #NounishClip and #NounsJV.\n\n**Our goal is to show his audience what it means to be nounish. They can teach and learn, do good and help others, and be funded to proliferate while having fun throughout the process.**\n\nEvery Wednesday for two weeks, Jon Vlogs will then react in live stream on Twitch for thousands of people, reacting to the best of the Weekly Nounish Clips and then choosing the top 3 winners.\n\nHe has 1.3 million followers on Twitch. We're talking about ~2-8 hours of Lil Nouns brand being exposed to an audience of 6.7k CCUs (Average Concurrent Audience). Twice.\n\n**The game changer:** using the live streams as an educational tool to onboard people to the Lil Nouns ecosystem and help them understand more about how to engage with Nouns.\n\nNo doubt Lil Nouns is the best entry point for Nouns and that's why each winner (total of 6) will receive a Lil Nouns NFT alongside a nounish merch box with classic items made by Bigshot Klim. They'll learn how to create a wallet and join our community, and they will learn about governance and the amazing things we're doing.\n\n**Measuring success:** we'll create a landing page for the campaign, with educational information about Lil Nouns. We'll use either the live streams and the social media posts to drive traffic to it and UTM variables to track it. Custom POAPs will be distributed during the live streams as well due to collect data for the future.\n\n**We are talking about educating millions of people and showing them the amazing things we're doing. Teaching them about Nouns and how they can join us. Powered by Lil Nouns.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R4aAbhT.png)\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jBudLlR.jpg)\n\n**Budget**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Axwozw2.jpg)\n\nWe see it as a huge opportunity and just the beginning of an amazing story between one of the most successful creators in Brazil and the whole Nouns ecosystem. He is very excited about this and can't wait to start!\n\n**Team**\n\n[@jonvlogs](https://twitter.com/Jonvlogs)\nLuan \"Jon Vlogs\" Kovarik, is a gaming/lifestyle content creator that lives in São Paulo, Brazil.

The ultimate aim being to onboard and increase awareness of the DAO.\n![](https://i.ibb.co/hd85Sn4/Screenshot-2023-04-14-204243-NEW.png)\n\n\n## Prior Funding\n\n- [Lil Funding](https://www.addressform.io/board/details/689ad3b5-7a88-4ad0-8ba0-4d57703d7636/the-lil-nouns-show-retro-funding-pilot-month/2927) - We have completed a one month, four episode pilot in which we received retro funding at a cost to the DAO of 0.125 ETH per host, per episode. Totalling 2 ETH.\n- [On Chain Proposal](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/68) - Proposal 68 was an on chain proposal to Lil Nouns DAO that passed **1185 votes** to 334. A total of 47 unique addresses voted ‘for’ with just 4 addresses voting ‘against’ making it one of the most successful proposals in Lil Nouns DAO history. There were no abstain votes recorded.\n- [On Chain Proposal](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/94) - Proposal 94 was an on chain second term funding proposal to Lil Nouns DAO that passed **1506 votes** to 337. This proposal gained more votes than the previous one and as a percentage performed better than our first proposal. A good sign that we are doing things of value!\n![](https://i.ibb.co/k9Pkv6j/Screenshot-2023-04-12-145537.png)\n![](https://i.ibb.co/0htRr5v/Screenshot-2023-01-04-133143.png)\n\n## What have we been doing?\nWe feel like we have achieved a lot in our first 6 months of running spaces for the Lil Nouns community. When we started this show, we envisaged it being a focal point for the community to engage with not only other Lil Nouns holders, but also with the wider space in general. We have introduced many other communities to Lil Nouns holders and this has been seen by those communities either engaging with Lil Nouns via twitter and discord, or by buying a token and getting involved in governance. \n\n## What are we going to do next?\nLil Nouns is currently at a juncture. The bear market has stalled the progress of many projects and this can be seen in the treasury amount. That being said, Lil Nouns as a DAO have decided upon a path to boost Nouns holdings up to 15 (soon to be 16). Taking into account the ETH spent on the procurement of those Nouns, Lil Nouns is in a healthy position. Our role as the outward face of the DAO will not change, we will try to leverage our positions to keep *our* brand in the face of some of the most active communities in the space. It is a responsibility we as TLNS hosts are very passionate about and hopefully this has been continually demonstrated to the DAO members. The DAO will not continue to function as an entity if nobody is a part of it or indeed, knows about it. We will continue to encourage voter participation on all of our shows and explain in detail, how important it is to the survival of the project we all love. \n\n## The Lil Nouns Show format\nWe currently run a 2/3 to 1/3 structure on our shows. We like to invite a guest from outside of the community (another community/individual) who we think would provide value to the Lil Nouns audience but also allow us to profile Lil Nouns to them. This section of the show usually takes up 2/3 of our show time.\nTo date, we have hosted the following external guests:\n\n- [Kevin Rose](https://twitter.com/kevinrose) - PROOF and Moonbirds Founder\n- [Zeneca](https://twitter.com/Zeneca_33) - Founder and CEO of Zen Academy and The 333 Club (booked as a guest for Ep. 4 on Halloween)\n- [Nonfungiblenoah](https://twitter.com/NonFungibleNoah?s=20&t=dLiediTkCfVVivdkPlslpQ) - Brand Lead for CryptoPunkz and HowlerzNFT Founder\n- [Henry the Grape](https://twitter.com/HenryTheGrape) - CyberKongz Community Manager\n- [MotivateMe](https://twitter.com/MotivateMeV2?s=20&t=dLiediTkCfVVivdkPlslpQ) - Community Manager for Cryptoadz\n- [mfers](https://twitter.com/unofficialmfers) - Community Managers and community\n- [Stoopid Buddy](https://twitter.com/StoopidBuddy?s=20) - Burbank based animation studio\n- [SquiggleDAO](https://twitter.com/squiggleDAO) - Chromie Squiggle DAO\n- [Gian the Rios](https://twitter.com/GianTheRios) - Web3 Biz Dev & Marketing Director for SwapBox\n- [Ryan Carson](https://twitter.com/ryancarson?s=20&t=dLiediTkCfVVivdkPlslpQ) - Host of Daily Dose twitter spaces show.\n- [Toby Lasso](https://twitter.com/tobylasso) - Founder of Nocturnal and manager of Vinnie Hager and various artists\n- [Josie Bellini](https://twitter.com/josiebellini) - Founder & Artist of CyberBrokers\n- [OnChainMonkey](https://twitter.com/OnChainMonkey?s=20&t=dLiediTkCfVVivdkPlslpQ) - Founding Team\n- [n00uns](https://twitter.com/snounsdao?s=20&t=L95tzYhOICJB61UTiijnNg) - Founders of Solana Nouns\n- [OtakuJake](https://twitter.com/otakujake_pro?s=20&t=L95tzYhOICJB61UTiijnNg) - Founder of Uniqly\n- [Jose Vasconez](https://twitter.com/Xenophan_?s=20&t=dLiediTkCfVVivdkPlslpQ) - Senior Manager of NFTs at Paramount Pictures\n- [DarrenSRS](https://twitter.com/DarrenSRS?s=20&t=L95tzYhOICJB61UTiijnNg) - Building Open Metaverse with Punk6529\n- [Sekure D](https://twitter.com/SekureD?s=20&t=dLiediTkCfVVivdkPlslpQ) - Artist/Founder of RoboGhosts and brand advisor to Jordan, Nike and Adidas\n- [Andrei](https://twitter.com/andreitr?s=20&t=L95tzYhOICJB61UTiijnNg) - Founder of BotFrens\n\n\nThe last 1/3 of the show is reserved for us, our community and allows us to platform those Lil Nouners who are building in the community that want to come up and tell people all about it. \n\nAside from guests hosted, here are some other things we are proud of:\n\n- # **3337 listeners over 11 shows**\n- # **The #1 listened to #SoapBox show on The Noun Square.**\n![](https://i.ibb.co/NTfVRzG/9-E0-BB778-9-D3-A-4407-9691-F66-F717-DCF56.jpg)\n## The Lil Nouns Show team\nTeam Bios\n- **April** - I’m April, a web3 enthusiast who has been exploring the NFT space since August 2021, yet to my detriment I only properly dove into the Nouns ecosystem well into 2022. Since then I have become obsessed with how this dream of an open-source brand can succeed. Outside of this world my background is in PR & communications (in-house & agency side) having worked for many years in Amsterdam and London, before following my other passion (skiing) and moving to the other side of the world. When I’m not chatting about Nouns, you’ll find me hanging with Moonbirds & Creatures.\n- **Cardno** - I entered the space at the back end of 2021, around Christmas time. I initially became aware of NFTs through the visibility on twitter of BAYC (of course) and after falling into the ‘Fast Food Punks’ discord, (strange, I know) I found myself on a call with the founder within 10 minutes and being given an NFT 101 chat from him. I was onboarded. Since then, I have been a moderator of various projects such as 3Landers, Chimpers and Lorem. I have also been the host of the official 3Landers twitter spaces show. I am currently a signer for Lil Funding Gnosis wallet in Lil Nouns and have just seen out a term as a Lil Representative. \n- **Crxsher** - I entered the space in February 2021, first in crypto, then in NFTs on Harmony, and finally in Ethereum in April. My first purchase was a piece of Sandbox land, which I then traded for two BAYC Apes, and the rest is history. I’ve had a few successes, made many mistakes, but what has never wavered is my belief that Web3 constitutes a major shift in how the world will interact in the future. I’m a frequent guest on many Twitter spaces in addition to co-hosting the 3Landers spaces, hoping to share, engage, learn and grow as we move forward in NFTs. I’m most active these days in BAYC, Ghxsts, Chimpers, Zen Academy and Lil Nouns, although you’ll find me engaging in several others as well.\n- **English** - I entered this space as a research consultant for a friend who was looking to leverage their musical IP assets in web 3. Upon my research I engaged with multiple communities and ended up moderating for 3landers and Lorem. I am currently working with a web2 gaming company looking to launch their first nft project.\n## Social media handles:\n- **Twitter**: [@april_xyz_](https://twitter.com/april_xyz_) **Discord**: april || pinklobster.eth#5026\n- **Twitter**: [@CardnoNFT](https://twitter.com/CardnoNFT) **Discord**: Cardno#0446\n- **Twitter**: [@CryptoCrusher6](https://twitter.com/CryptoCrusher6) **Discord**: Crxsher#3174\n- **Twitter**: [@EnglishNFTea](https://twitter.com/EnglishNFTea) **Discord**: English#0943\n## Compensation Model\n**Contest rewards, art & miscellaneous expenses:**\n- **0.0420 ETH** x 14 for the weekly giveaway\n\n**Team reward:**\n- **April** - Co-Host / Guest Booking / Operations - 5 ETH\n- **Cardno** - Co-Host / Operations / Guest Booking - 5 ETH\n- **Crxsher** - Co-Host / Guest Booking 1.5 ETH\n- **English** - Main Host / Guest Booking 5 ETH\n- 14 Episodes running from **1 May - 31 Jul 2023** (one TLNS show each week).\n## Total\n# **17.088 ETH** **(Less than previous proposal)**\n\nIf anyone has any questions regarding this proposal, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with one of us via the discord or twitter handles above, and we will be happy to answer any questions prior to you voting.\n",

      "content": "**tl;dr**\n\nWe would like to request 3.2 ETH + 7 Lils to collaborate with Jon Vlogs - one of the largest content creators in Brazil - to introduce Nouns to millions of people by creating a viral online challenge using Noggles AR filter.\n\n**Description**\n\nAs we understand how important it is to spread the meme, it’s easy to understand that the **Creators Economy** is an essential part of this mission for Nouns. This industry plays a big role when it comes to gathering attention, community engagement and awareness for whoever is building there. \n\nThat being said, with this proposal we will:\n\n**Onboard the perfect fit partner to the Nouns ecosystem, connect his huge audience to our community and bring a lot of results and awereness for Lil Nouns.** \n\nThe name is **Jon Vlogs** and he can't wait to start collaborating!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kLSRkqF.gif)\n\nYou may recognize the name from a collab he did with the Nouns e-sports team where he streamed for more than 3k concurrent viewers on Twitch!\n\nHe is one of the pioneers as a content creator in Brazil for the past years and his history is a source of inspiration for fans and creators who are always looking to reinvent themselves.\n\n**Jon Vlogs** creates content in a lot of different verticals like: lifestyle, gaming, reacts, IRL etc and he’s literally growing on all networks, at a time when many influencers are losing followers.\n\nHe achieved **28 million views only in the last 8 days** on his TikTok “Clips Channels”. All of this content is edited and \"recycled\" from the live streams and delivered to the audience in a shorter format.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xyUmzZm.jpg)\n\n**Numbers**\n\nFollowers\n- [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@jonvlogs): 3.3M followers + 20M likes\n- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jonvlogs): 6.2M followers\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/jonvlogs): 6.8M subscribers\n- [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/jonvlogs): 1.3M followers\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jonvlogs): 497K followers\n\nViews - only in 2023\n\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jonvlogs) - stories\n\n- ~1.4M views (average)\n\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/jonvlogs) - videos\n- +13M views\n\n[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/jonvlogs) - live streams\n- 6.7k CCUs (Average Concurrent Audience)\n- ~2M hours watched\n- +280 hours transmitted\n\nCurious to see how we are going to leverage Nouns content using this HUGE audience reach? Check it out 👇\n\n**The idea:** create a weekly TikTok challenge where the audience will need to post a creative video - inspired by Jon's lifestyle content - using the noggles AR filter, and post it using our campaign hashtags: #NounishClip and #NounsJV.\n\n**Our goal is to show his audience what it means to be nounish. They can teach and learn, do good and help others, and be funded to proliferate while having fun throughout the process.**\n\nEvery Wednesday for two weeks, Jon Vlogs will then react in live stream on Twitch for thousands of people, reacting to the best of the Weekly Nounish Clips and then choosing the top 3 winners.\n\nHe has 1.3 million followers on Twitch. We're talking about ~2-8 hours of Lil Nouns brand being exposed to an audience of 6.7k CCUs (Average Concurrent Audience). Twice.\n\n**The game changer:** using the live streams as an educational tool to onboard people to the Lil Nouns ecosystem and help them understand more about how to engage with Nouns.\n\nNo doubt Lil Nouns is the best entry point for Nouns and that's why each winner (total of 6) will receive a Lil Nouns NFT alongside a nounish merch box with classic items made by Bigshot Klim. They'll learn how to create a wallet and join our community, and they will learn about governance and the amazing things we're doing.\n\n**Measuring success:** we'll create a landing page for the campaign, with educational information about Lil Nouns. We'll use either the live streams and the social media posts to drive traffic to it and UTM variables to track it. Custom POAPs will be distributed during the live streams as well due to collect data for the future.\n\n**We are talking about educating millions of people and showing them the amazing things we're doing. Teaching them about Nouns and how they can join us. Powered by Lil Nouns.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R4aAbhT.png)\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jBudLlR.jpg)\n\n**Budget**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Axwozw2.jpg)\n\nWe see it as a huge opportunity and just the beginning of an amazing story between one of the most successful creators in Brazil and the whole Nouns ecosystem. He is very excited about this and can't wait to start!\n\n**Team**\n\n[@jonvlogs](https://twitter.com/Jonvlogs)\nLuan \"Jon Vlogs\" Kovarik, is a gaming/lifestyle content creator that lives in São Paulo, Brazil.

The events have not scaled while the artist queue has:\n[![Screenshot-2023-04-05-205405.png](https://i.postimg.cc/xjwjC6YF/Screenshot-2023-04-05-205405.png)](https://postimg.cc/MXYJ3bny)\nDue to this and in the spirit of reaching more we have lowered the amount produced per turn to 2 POAPs and are looking at branching out into other media engagements. (Banners, Flyers, Flags, T- Shirts, etc etc...) : *THIS IS THE PURPOSE TO THIS MVP : mass sustainability*\n\n**Proposed Expansion**\nAs stated above, *EVENTS HAVE NOT SCALED*... **why**? \n- lack of advertising among the Lil Nouns DAO community of availability?\n- Not needed due to no new events?\n- Not needed due to DIY is enough?\n\nThis proposal suggests a little of everything in totality, however if we can set up a system that makes cross DAO usage of this as a media on demand marketing arm for the ecosystem, there will be a lot of spaces and events and ideas globally to drive demand for the artists to align with event managers in need of fresh catchy graphics. \n\n**THIS** is specifically to see if we can get the current program with some small tweaks of increased usage to also become a smoother gather and distribution. while it has not been an issue, there are many areas where automation makes sense and can streamline.\n\n- Should this MVP go well the goal would be to bring this to Larger Nouns DAO on chain to get funding for a finished ecosystem wide project.\n\n---\n\n**Experimentation** \n\nThe best way I can show the metrics that were created is the data collected during the inaugural [@airdropoooor](https://twitter.com/airdropoooor) program. (run out of same wallet as PPP by sqx.pcc.eth)\n-  63 wallets had collected 3 or more POAPs and were airdropped [Noggles, All The Way Down](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x3d4211a4d86f6832feb04e7385ca4b6dbf2356cb/1)\n-  2155 Total POAPs collected\n-  1660 Unique wallets\n-  1515 Single POAP collectors\n-  Multi-POAP collectors\n[![Screenshot-2023-04-05-215007.png](https://i.postimg.cc/SQCGzmJh/Screenshot-2023-04-05-215007.png)](https://postimg.cc/8skv2QRK)\n\n**WHY IS THIS NEEDED** \n\nMany DAOS are running on a shoe string budget... which is *GOOD*! \n\nSmall, fun, exciting things like this are many times just out of reach. The proliferation is not only nounish in the support it provides to the artist community, but also creates POAPS / Media as a public good. WE COULD ALMOST seek the next step at builder DAO as well.  \n\nAre there pitfalls in this program if it were to go live and the potential to manipulate the usage and payout... yes! This Proposal and MVP are looking into this to provide solutions. \n\n---\n\n**FUNDING wallets**\n\n**2.5 ETH** : airdropoooor.lilnouns.eth : 0x40A84cF8c8862615529bA730ca8b8d7BFE75BCae\n- This is the wallet which the program has been operating out of.\n\n**1.25 ETH** : content pod : 0x04107AEb2A87E830ea90Bd15cC8A6e4014863F41",

      "title": "Lil Nouns x W3BSTOCK in NOUN YORK CITY",
      "content": "## Intro\nW3BSTOCK is an NYC-based, global live entertainment consortium powering the decentralized music industry. They integrate best-in-class web3 tools and communities to produce concerts, music festivals and other meaningful, memorable experiences in real life, all doubled in the metaverse. Following the successful Nouns activations at W3BSTOCK Miami on December 1st, 2022 and the W3BSTOCK x Lil Nouns Denver party on March 4th, 2023, we now have the opportunity for Lil Nouns to make a lasting impression within the W3BSTOCK live music and arts ecosystem, which will reverberate across the thriving New York City web3 community, in the artistic and musical epicenter of NFT.NYC. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Y0Cyr22.jpg)\n\n## Event \nW3BSTOCK will kick off NFT.NYC this year on Tuesday, April 11th, the eve of the conference, with a massive event bringing together over 30 leading musicians from the web3 music ecosystem like Dyl, Violetta Zironi, Nifty Sax, The CART3L, and Taylor Alexander, and over 30 art tastemakers like Dave Krugman / ALLSHIPS, The Alien Boy, Metasill, Tokenprooof, and many more. W3BSTOCK was hand-down the most popular music and art event on the day before NFT NYC last year, and I expect this year will be no different. With an expected attendance of over 30,000 attendees at NFT.NYC this year, W3BSTOCK realistically projects an attendance of over 1,500 diverse attendees for their event, including in-person attendees and metaverse attendees, with organic social media impressions exceeding 20,000. \n\nThis is an unprecedented opportunity to showcase Lil Nouns and the Nouns community in the top tier New York City web3 music and arts ecosystem. We will onboard new community members from the W3BSTOCK music and art community into the Lil Nouns and/or Nouns DAO. W3BSTOOCK is a different type of NFT event that we are used to, solely focused on live music, beautiful performances, and interactive art activations, rather than a dry panel of speakers or a bunch of speculative crypto bros. For this reason, I would like Lil Nouns to have a leading presence at this event.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/X2BBCPB.jpg)\n\n\n## Description\n\nI am requesting 6.5 ETH (at 1700 USD) for Lil Nouns to become a Title Sponsor of W3BSTOCK NYC with a premium vendor booth in their NFT Tastemaker Bazaar, and to make a large splash with a full week of proliferation at NFT NYC.\n\nThe funding breakdown will be as follows:\n\n6.5 ETH For Title Sponsorship that will get us:\n• Premiere, exclusive sponsorship of W3BSTOCK - “The W3BSTOCK Music and Art Fair NYC powered by Lil Nouns” - Category exclusivity\n• 10’x10’ Official Tastemaker IRL Vendor Booth, places prominently at the main entrance to the W3BSTOCK event, with a 33” Metasill Screen and projector to display Lil Nouns and Nouns NFTs\n• 100 comps for Lil Nouns holders\n• Lil Nouns featured with top, premiere placement on invite and promo materials \n• Lil Nouns featured prominently in signage at the event\n• Lil Nouns inspired specialty cocktail on bar menu\n• Branding and link to LilNouns.wtf AND nouns.wtf in the Metaverse livestream component of the event\n• Branding across social assets\n• Branding on emails linked to the event\n\n50 custom Lil Nouns x W3BSTOCK t-shirts, to be given away to holders (first come, first served) - $745\n8’ x 8’ Lil Nouns x W3BSTOCK Step-and-Repeat - $250\n47” x 81” Lil Nouns Retractable Banner (Which we will carry around and display at multiple events throughout NFT NYC) - $260\nNoggles for swag page, and for handing out across NFT NYC - $350\nW3BSTOCK-included VIP table for Lil Nouns community at Nolcha Shows x Crypto Punks event with 3,000 attendees on Weds, April 12th - $0 plus tax & shipping costs \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RDfdQaR.jpg)\n## ROI To The DAO:\n\nI will show the DAO a several returns on investment from this activation, from financial to brand awareness to growth marketing. I will be collecting data via POAP mints, distributed merch to holders, and social media impressions. We will keep a thorough list of tags on every social platform, LilNouns.wtf and nouns.wft link visits during the week, and will provide a full write-up on all of the nounish interactions with artists and creators and the W3BSTOCK event and across NFT NYC. \n\nI will provide a total of **3 reports to the DAO**. The reports will provide **follow up analytics after 7 days, 30 days and 90 days**. The stats I will be tracking are:\n\n•**Branding and proliferation** of Noggles all across NFT.NYC with an estimated 20,000 organic social impressions\n• **Hundreds of photos** of W3BSTOCK and Nouns and other noonish people at the step-and-repeat\n• **Website Traffic** to LilNouns.wtf AND nouns.wtc\n• **Purchases** - We will have a number of POAP kiosks throughout the event where attendees will mint our W3BSTOCK x Lil Nouns NFT NYC POAP. Through this, we will have a list of wallet addresses, I will then check those addresses at the 7 day, 30 day and 90 day checkpoints to see if any of those wallet addresses now own a Lil Noun or Noun (purchased after the event date)\n• **Photos** either tagging Lil Nouns or Nouns and/or containing Noggles, pulled from every social media platform at 30, 90 and 180s out from the event.\n• **Aggregated brand impressions** from all social media, web visits and NFT purchases post event at each checkpoint\n\nBy proliferating Lil Nouns and Nouns at W3BSTOCK Miami and also our collab Denver event, and also knowing all about W3BSTOCK last NYC event at the same venue, I have been able to see first hand how to best proliferate the nounish brands among the W3BSTOCK arts and music ecosystem. The biggest impacts include:\n\n• **Interactive art**, screens and live minting POAP experiences, and step-and-repeat activations\n• **A strong presence** at the event with a premium booth & Noun maxis to chat with & answer questions\n• **Live music** - This has been oft overlooked in building the Lil Nouns and Nouns communities and I believe we have massively untapped awareness within the thriving web3 NYC music and arts web3 scene - This proposal will instantly fix that\n• **Branded tote gift bags** handed out to holders - Several folks bought Lil Nous on-site specifically so they could redeem a gift bag!\n• **Stickers** - people love collecting stickers and we saw tons of them up around various places in Miami and Denver\n• **T-shirts** - Branded W3BSTOCK x Lil Nouns / Nouns t-shirts turn attendees into marketing evangelists, and people who come to events and have a great time (like, all of them) are happy to wear merch around to other events at conferences and also post on social media  \nIf this proposal is funded we will officially be partnering with the first-to-market and leading web3 music and arts ecosystem which is thriving in New York City. This will allow allow for nounish proliferation over an entire week, not only in W3BSTOCK’s live music and arts ecosystem, but in and around the largest NFT conference in the entire world, in the greatest city in the world, NOUN YORK CITY!!!!\n\n## Team \n\n* **Brian Strolley** - CEO of Webstock,  Past organizations that I've done high end production work for - Brooklyn Bowl, Capitol Theatre, DKNY, Jack Daniel's, Central Park SummerStage, Sony Music, W3BX Investor Summit, Elements Music and Arts Festival and many more!   https://www.linkedin.com/in/briancity/\n\n* **Bloomz** - My name is Bloomz and I am a nounish builder and Artist.

      "title": "Lil Nouns x NFT Melbourne",
      "content": "Following the success of NFT Fest Aus for NounsDAO, we now have the opportunity for Lil Nouns to make a lasting impression at NFT Melbourne. With an expected attendance of over 1,000 this could be an amazing opportunity to onboard new community members. NFT Melbourne is going to be a different type of NFT event, more focused on interactions and live activations vs just a lineup of speakers. For this reason, I would like Lil Nouns to have a larger presence at this event. \n\n--------------------------\n\nI would like to request 5 ETH for Lil Nouns to become an official Core Sponsor of NFT Melbourne with a booth presence. The funding breakdown will be as follows:\n\n$6500 For Core Sponsorship + Booth that will get us:\n+ 6.5' x 6.5' booth with display monitor on stand\n+ Featured on social advertising (https://twitter.com/NFT_MELBOURNE)\n+ Featured on website (https://www.nftmelbourne.xyz/)\n+ Featured in signage at the event\n+ 2X tickets to all events\n+ Branding across social assets\n+ Branding on emails linked to the event\n\nDisplay Banner For Booth - $813\nCustom Tablecloth - $125 \nAdditional Retractable Banner (33”x81”) $250\nplus tax & shipping costs\n\nI am also in discussion with NounsAU to purchase remaining Noggles t-shirts from NFT Fest Aus, any remaining funds will go towards purchasing these shirts. \n\n----------------------------------------\nROI To The DAO:\n\nI love stats & data and believe it is important that I can show the DAO a direct ROI from this proposal. I will be collecting data via POAP mints and NFC tags placed within the Banners, Coasters & Stickers. The Banners, Coasters & Stickers will each have designated url's with UTM variables. This way we can pull reports from Lil Nouns Google Analytics and show exact traffic and interactions that were brought in from each item. \n\nI will provide a total of 3 reports to the DAO. The reports will provide follow up analytics after 30 days, 90 days and 180 days. The stats I will be tracking are:\n+ Website Traffic to LilNouns.wtf \n+ Purchases - by having people mint our special Lil Nouns POAP we will have a list of wallet addresses, I will then check those addresses at the 30 day, 90 day and 180 day check points to see if any of those wallet addresses now own a Lil Noun (purchased after the event date)\n+ Interactions with NFC tags on stickers & coasters (total inventory count vs how many NFC tags were tapped) - this will be an interesting stat to collect data from because they can interact with the item forever so to speak, no max limit or timeframe of when the link expires. \n\n-----------------------------\n\nBy helping the NounsAU crew during NFT Fest Aus I was able to see first hand the things that created the most engagement, and help push brand awareness. These things include:\n\n+ Having a presence at the event with a booth & team members available to chat with & answer questions\n+ Interactive Banner to claim POAP - was a great conversation starter & created engagement\n+ Creating branded coasters to pass out at the event and after party events (1 side Noggles, 1 side QR code)\n+ Stickers - people love collecting stickers and we saw tons of them up around various places in Melbourne after the event\n+ T-shirts - Noggles branded shirts were given out which lead to people wearing them the next days of the event and posting on social media\n\nIf this proposal is funded we would be having all of these same elements at NFT Melbourne for Lil Nouns. The funds from Prop House Round 12 (0.63eth) are going towards an interactive banner to claim a special Lil Nouns POAP, stickers & branded coasters. The Prop House round will still be executed regardless of the outcome of this proposal. ",

      "title": "Lil Nouns DAO V2 Upgrade",
      "content": "tl;dr: This is a proposal to bring Nouns DAO's V2 upgrades to Lil Nouns. Contract changes are the same as seen [here](https://nouns.wtf/vote/152); bar slight alterations to contract parameters (see Dynamic Quorum Parameters) to reflect Lil Nouns participation rates.\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal updates the Nouns DAO logic contract to a new version, with the following improvements and additions:\n\n1.  **Dynamic Quorum**: In V1, quorum is a fixed percentage of total supply. In V2, quorum has a dynamic range, rising as a function of against votes up to a defined cap. Read [this post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE) for more info.\n2.  **Vote with Gas Refund**: Allow Lil Nouners/delegates to vote and receive a gas refund. The vote still takes place in the case of insufficient ETH to refund.\n3.  **Voting Delay Editing Bug Fix**: In V1, editing voting delay was unsafe. V2 makes it safe to edit anytime. More info on the bug [here](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-diligence/blob/main/reports/proposal-58.md#major).\n4.  **Cancel Proposal Bug Fix**: The DAO has a spam mitigation feature, allowing anyone to cancel a proposal if the proposer has an amount of votes less than or equal to proposal threshold. In V1, this feature didn't work when proposer had exactly proposal threshold votes; in V2 it works as expected.\n5.  **Vetoer Change Is Now 2-step**: Nouns received audit feedback that V1's vetoer change process was risky as a single-step process. In V2, the risk of setting a wrong vetoer is mitigated using a 2-step process where the current vetoer sets a pending new vetoer. Once set, the pending vetoer must accept for the change to take place.\n\n\n## Audit\n1.  The code has gone through internal reviews and a [code4rena audit](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-08-nounsdao/).\n2.  **No high-risk issues were found in V2**.\n3.  **Unrelated to this proposal**, one high-risk issue was found. See [this audit summary on discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-dao-v2-audit-summary/2525) for more information.\n\n\n## Dynamic Quorum Parameters\nAs articulated in this [detailed post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE), three parameters need to be set for dynamic quorum. This proposal sets their values, and we’re offering the thinking behind them here:\n\n1.  **Minimum quorum %**: reducing it to 8% to account for current voter apathy.\n2.  **Maximum quorum %**: setting it to 12%, taking into account recent participation levels around 25%, allowing proposals with more than 12% For votes to be decided by simple majority; the intent is for this value to provide extra protection from voter apathy, while allowing most all proposals to be decided by simple majority rather than quorum.\n3.  **Coefficient**: setting it to 0.3, such that ~every third against vote raises the quorum requirement by one vote, until the maximum quorum is reached.\n\nThese parameters can be edited at any time via a proposal; treat these values as the first experiment.\n\n\n## Vote with Gas Refund\nA bit more on how this feature works:\n\n1.  Governance clients (like lilnouns.wtf/vote) need to update their code to support it.\n2.  Refunds are subject to certain constraints:\n    1.  Gas base fee is capped at 200 gwei.\n    2.  Gas priority fee is capped at 2 gwei.\n    3.  Total gas is capped at 200K, supporting voting reason text up to roughly 9,190 characters.\n    4.  If the contract’s balance is insufficient, voter will receive a partial refund.\n3.  This feature requires the DAO to maintain the DAO contract’s ETH balance, which should be done via periodic ETH transfer proposals from the treasury to the DAO contract (this proposal performs the first funding).\n4.  The DAO can choose to withdraw refund ETH back into the treasury at any time via a proposal.\n\n## Proposal Transactions for Humans\n1.  `_setImplementation`: upgrades DAO logic to V2.\n2.  `_setDynamicQuorumParams`: sets dynamic quorum params to:\n    1.  Minimum quorum BPs: 8% (800 basis points).\n    2.  Maximum quorum BPs: 12% (1200 basis points).\n    3.  Coefficient: 0.3 (300,000 in unsigned integer with 5 decimal places).\n\n***Voter Refunds have not been included in this proposal. For whoever that wants to enable voter refunds, propose to transfer ETH to our nounsDAOProxy as demonstrated below:***\n- `transfer`: funding vote refunds with an amount of your choosing. 12 ETH should be enough for just over 100 proposals at a 30% participation rate.\n- `txn`: [0x5d2C31ce16924C2a71D317e5BbFd5ce387854039](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5d2C31ce16924C2a71D317e5BbFd5ce387854039).transfer(amount of ETH)",

We will build (2) sheds to begin, in Tuguegarao City Philippines, with a population of 166,334 people, making it the most populous famous city in Cagayan Valley and Northeastern Asia Luzon.\n\n**Main Goal of this Proposal:**\nThis will provide highly visible Public Good and on the ground marketing of lilnouns.wtf & the Nouns ecosystem in an adorable way. This will will also provide a community service to shelter people from the sun, rain and weather conditions. \n\nAdditionally, we hope that this can serve as a Pilot Prop for a larger world-wide proliferation effort to add similar installations across the world — spreading awareness of Nouns to thousands of passers-by each day. \n\n**Project Details:**\nWe are coordinating with our local government to choose the first location, and to work through other details as we go. Each month, we will change the ads to reflect local holidays, and to give different information such as:\n1. LilNouns.wtf\n2. Nouns explainers (This Is Nouns video).\n3. Onboarding to Lil Nouns and Nouns\n4. Lil Nouns Projects\n    - Nouns101.wtf\n    - Onboarding.wtf\n    - Lil Nouns Podcasts & Twitter Spaces\n    - PropHouse Rounds\n5. LilNouns’ official links of different social media and subDAOs\n6. Promoting social media content\n\n**Day & Night Sensitive Design**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QphzKhT.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5pR1J7J.png)\n\n\n\nWe are working with an engineer and a local contractor to oversee the build. Structural aspects of the waiting sheds will be made from steel tubes and the roof using longspan. Solar lamps will be installed in the shed. The flooring will be concrete, of course.\n\nWe will post photos of the construction on our social media channels to build excitement and encourage others in the Nouniverse to take similar action. Then, each month, we will post updates when we change the ads.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lpt38HP.png)\n\n\n**Timeframe:**\n\n1-3 weeks - Engineer Planning Consulation and Application for building permit (It takes couple of weeks to get the building permit.)\n\n4-6 weeks - laying of foundation, fabrication of waiting shed, installation of solar lamps, flooring finishing.\n\n7-8 weeks - painting, art design and different Ads installation.\n\n**Budget Asking & Breakdown Allocation: 4ETH (2 Eth Per Shed)+ 1 Lil Noun DAO Token**\n\n0.25eth - building permit and engineer fees\n0.3eth - concrete flooring and foundation(materials)\n1eth - waiting shed fabrication (materials and labor days of workers)\n0.15eth - paint (primer to finishing paint and labor of painters workers)\n0.05eth - (2)solar lamps installed\n0.25eth - monthly art and design, and maintenance for 6 months\n\n\n**Floor Plan Sketch Design**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RZH5GSj.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hU1jsZt.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yNEwzNe.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/M2R1o7V.png)\n\n\n**Our Team**\n\n**Bossjcrypto.eth**\n*Pinoy Nouns Founder \nIRL Proliferator\nWriter Proposer\nGnars Athelete\nVideographer\nMeme Creator\nCharity Community Manager*\n\n**Past Nounish Work: **\n\n[NSFW Winning Retro Proposal Nouns Dao Giveback to Aeta Agta People (FIP) ⌐◨-◨](https://prop.house/nsfw/what-did-we-miss/2672)\n\n[TNS #NounsGiveBack Winning Entry](https://prop.house/nsfw/what-did-we-miss/2672)\n\n[IRL Open Category Art Contest & DIY  Community Art in our College School](https://twitter.com/bossj_eth/status/1622012993004511232?s=20&t=Crv2io4lBcAlAuoDU8BzLg)\n\n\nTwitter handle: [bossj_eth](https://twitter.com/bossj_eth)\nDiscord: bossj.eth#0939\nPinoy Nouns : [PinoyNouns](https://twitter.com/PinoyNouns)\n\n**Jangli**\n\n*Graphic designer\nPOAP artist at TNS\nCo-Founder-PinoyNouns*\n\nTwitter handle: [Jangli](https://twitter.com/0xCryptoBulls)\nDiscord handle: jangli#4558\n\n**Project Idea Consultants**\n\n**Mama Xargs**\nTwitter handle: !xargs: @mamaxargs 1\nDiscord: !𝚡𝚊𝚛𝚐𝚜#0333\n\n*Core member at The Noun Square \nNouncilor\nInternatioNouns founder\nDev for thenounsquare.info and internationouns.org*\n\n\n**Mike Good**\nTwitter: @goodbeats \nDiscord: mikegood#9887\n\n*Lil Representative\nNouncil Member\nLil Nouns Builder\n*\n\n**Lil Pizza**\nTwitter: @lilpizza_eth\nDiscord: lilpizza.eth#0001\n\n*Lil Nouns Moderator\nSoftware Dev\nMarketing @botfrens*\n\n\nThankyou for reading our proposal, looking forward to make this happen.

      "content": "tl:dr: Fund Builders, Proliferate the Meme and Grow the Treasury (160 Eth)\n\nFeedback heard and budget adjusted for a 4 month allocation instead of 10 months. \n\nI love Lil Nouns and want to see it thrive. We are at a critical juncture where there is debate over funding builders vs. only spending funds to buy Nouns. Buying Nouns will not drive more engagement or more Lil Nouns auction sales. But others disagree. \n\nSo I present to you a two options currently on the table:\nOPTION 1 Revised: Fund Builders and make strategic choices to grow the Lil Nouns DAO\nOPTION 2 Revised: Spend half the treasury on Nouns (see the Prop that follows this one)\n\nOPTION 1: Fund Builders, Proliferate the Meme and Grow Lil Nouns DAO\n\nThis option is a lower budget but still leans into proliferation and creating benefits for holding Lil Nouns. Currently there are very little rewards to holding Lils – this aims to change that via existing pods in Lil Nouns to create excitement and incentives for those outside the Nouns ecosystem to jump in via Lil Nouns.\n\n50 Eth: Prop House  0x3CF9179127590E16348454886CDd7e7d4AaD3693\n50 Eth: Lil Funding  0x9B1d89015F353707241a0f375770ecBdC05c2Ca9\n60 Eth: Content Pod, Lil Reps and Droposals  0x04107AEb2A87E830ea90Bd15cC8A6e4014863F41\n\nFunds to be used as follows:\n50 Eth: Prop House\n2 monthly mandated rounds open only to Lil Nouns holders (benefit to holders):\n\n4 Eth: Lil Nouners Mandated Prop House round open monthly only to Lil Nouns holders to propose ideas for fun weekly activities in the Lil Nouns discord. Fund 4 x .25 each month 4 months with one activity event each week to drive engagement in the discord. And to literally just have fun.\n\n4 Eth: Lil Nouners Mandated Prop House round open monthly only to Lil Nouns holders to propose ideas for Lil Nouns proliferation. Fund 4 x .25 each month for 4 months\n32 Eth: for open Prop House rounds TBD by Lil Nouns Prop House team\n10 Eth: Admin budget for spaces promotion and team activities \n\n50 Eth: Lil Funding\n40 Eth funding pool managed by Lil Funding team, Community Manager, Mods and Lil Nounders\n\nRolling funding using Address Form and Address Board with a focus on retro funding as well as proactive proliferation of Lil Nouns with a goal of minimum 10 Eth spend each month.\n\n10 Eth admin budget for team and tools such as Address Form/Board \n\n60 Eth: Content Pod, Lil Reps AND Droposals (to be managed by Content Pod and Lil Reps)\n10 Eth: 1 NFT or Edition Drop by Lil Nouns launched as proposals. 10 Eth budget for each drop including 5 eth artist/team payment, marketing funds and deployment.  Each drop should allow for Lil Nouns holders to have first access and lower mint price as presale as a benefit to holders (or airdrop ideally if budget allows). Funds for the drop go to the DAO treasury in a 50/50 split with the artist.  Drops could be art, video, music, etc. Specifics to be determined by Content Pod and Lil Reps.\n\n30 Eth: Content Pod additional budget for marketing, DAO tools, other governance maintenance, buying Lil Nouns for giveaways etc. I recommend that some of these funds be allocated to the Lil Reps wallet once more clear mandates are established.\n\n10 Eth: Admin for Content Pod and Lil Reps to serve as curators for this project and engage artists from both inside and outside the Lil Nouns ecosystem. This will be more time consuming than current responsibilities but also more fun.\n\n10 Eth: The Daily Lil experiment – Daily 30 minute Twitter Spaces where hosts settle and start the Lil Nouns auction using Lil Block Party and the winner of that specific Lil Noun gets a special edition only available for the Daily Lil auction winners. \nBudget the Daily Lil: \n4 Eth: Artist Payments for Limited Edition Creation (1 Eth x 4)\n1 Eth: Artist Payment for daily POAPs\n1 Eth: settling costs for one month \n4 Eth: Spaces Hosts via coordinape round each week\n\nA treasury will only drive auctions if there is activity and excitement. This prop seeks to do just that: put the treasury to work in order to grow it.\n\nIt’s up to you: Vote Option 1 and see if we can really take off OR Option 2 buy more nouns and see where that goes. OR vote against both and keep the status quo which frankly just isn’t fun. \n\nAnd I encourage others to put their own props in, including the Lil Nounders. But it’s time to have this discussion and decide what we want this DAO to be. I would even welcome vetos on both these props by Lil Nounders with some communication around the direction they’d like to see.\n\nOPTION 1: 160 Eth to fund builders and proliferate Lil Nouns\nOPTION 2: 160 Eth to buy Nouns.\nOPTION 3: Carry on, business as usual. \n\nIn your hands Lil Nouners!\n",

      "content": "tl:dr: Fund Builders, Proliferate the Meme and Grow the Treasury (300 Eth)\n\nI love Lil Nouns and want to see it thrive. We are at a critical juncture where there is debate over funding builders vs. only spending funds to buy Nouns. Buying Nouns will not drive more engagement or more Lil Nouns auction sales. But others disagree. \nSo I present to you the two options currently on the table. It’s time to choose:\n\nOPTION 1: Fund Builders and make strategic choices to grow the Lil Nouns DAO\nOPTION 2: Spend the rest of the treasury on Nouns (see the Prop that follows this one)\n\nOPTION 1: Fund Builders and Grow Lil Nouns DAO\nThis option leans into proliferation and creating benefits for holding Lil Nouns. Currently there are very little rewards to holding Lils – this aims to change that via existing pods in Lil Nouns to create excitement and incentives for those outside the Nouns ecosystem to jump in via Lil Nouns.\n\n100 Eth: Prop House  0x3CF9179127590E16348454886CDd7e7d4AaD3693\n100 Eth: Lil Funding  0x9B1d89015F353707241a0f375770ecBdC05c2Ca9\n100 Eth: Content Pod, Lil Reps and Droposals  0x04107AEb2A87E830ea90Bd15cC8A6e4014863F41\n\nRemaining funds in treasury for any technical upkeep and administrative needs.\nFunds to be used as follows:\n\n100 Eth: Prop House\n2 monthly mandated rounds open only to Lil Nouns holders (benefit to holders):\n\n10 Eth: Lil Nouners Mandated Prop House round open monthly only to Lil Nouns holders to propose ideas for fun weekly activities in the Lil Nouns discord. Fund 4 x .25 each month for the rest of 2023 with one activity event each week to drive engagement in the discord. And to literally just have fun.\n\n10 Eth: Lil Nouners Mandated Prop House round open monthly only to Lil Nouns holders to propose ideas for Lil Nouns proliferation. Fund 4 x .25 each month for the rest of 2023\n\n50 Eth: for open Prop House rounds TBD by Lil Nouns Prop House team\n30 Eth: Admin budget for spaces promotion and team activities \n\nNOTE: Vessel Verse was able to token gate submissions so I believe Lil Nouns will be able to as well.  If not, I recommend round voting be limited to ensure mandate is met.\n\n100 Eth: Lil Funding\n\n75 Eth funding pool managed by Lil Funding team, Community Manager, Mods and Lil Nounders -- Rolling funding using Address Form and Address Board with a focus on retro funding as well as proactive proliferation of Lil Nouns.\n\n25 Eth admin budget for team and tools such as Address Form/Board \n\n100 Eth: Content Pod, Lil Reps AND Droposals (to be managed by Content Pod and Lil Reps)\n\n30 Eth: 3 different NFT Collections or Edition Drops by Lil Nouns launched as proposals. \n\n10 Eth budget for each drop including 5 eth artist/team payment, marketing funds and deployment.  Each drop should allow for Lil Nouns holders to have first access and lower mint price as presale as a benefit to holders (or airdrop ideally if budget allows). Funds for the drop go to the DAO treasury in a 50/50 split with the artist.  Drops could be art, video, music, etc.\n\n30 Eth: Admin for Content Pod and Lil Reps to serve as curators for this project and engage artists from both inside and outside the Lil Nouns ecosystem. This will be more time consuming than current responsibilities but also more fun.\n\n40 Eth: Content Pod additional budget for marketing, DAO tools, other governance maintenance, buying Lil Nouns for giveaways etc. I recommend that some of these funds be allocated to the Lil Reps wallet once more clear mandates are established.\n\nA treasury will only drive auctions if there is activity and excitement. This prop seeks to do just that. \n\nIt’s up to you: Vote Option 1 and see if we can really take off OR Option 2 buy more nouns and see where that goes. OR vote against both and keep the status quo which frankly just isn’t fun. \n\nAnd I encourage others to put their own props in, including the Lil Nounders. But it’s time to have this discussion and decide what we want this DAO to be. I would even welcome vetos on both these props by Lil Nounders with some communication around the direction they’d like to see.\n\nOPTION 1: 300 Eth to fund builders and proliferate Lil Nouns\nOPTION 2: 300 Eth to buy Nouns.\nOPTION 3: Carry on, business as usual. \nhttps://tenor.com/view/nouns-dao-nounish-glasses-noggles-this-is-fine-gif-27084685 \n\nIn your hands Lil Nouners!\n",

      "title": "Lil Sisters Fund 2023",
      "content": "## tl;dr\n\nThe Lil Sisters proliferate Lil Nouns by supporting the DAO's wider vision while allocating small grants to women and non-binary builders. Below we outline accomplishments and funding request for five more months.\n\n## Lil Sisters Fund\n**click below to watch our 30 sec video**\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/P6O5QCA.jpg)\n](https://youtu.be/dSkv7fPwv4g)\n\nAs part of our mission of creating an accessible onramp to Nouns, we propose reinstating our pool of funds to encourage women and non-binary creators, devs, and artists to build within Lil Nouns. This pool of capital will be sent to a Gnosis Safe controlled by a small group of Lil Nouners known as the Lil Sisters. \n\nThe signers on the Lil Sisters’ Fund Safe will be:\n\n- **B** | thebeautyandthepunk\n- **Kome** | @komesciart\n- **Mimix** | @miagiulianag\n- **Pxlmnml** | @pxlmnml\n- **Prof Werder** | @profwerder\n- **Al409** | @7x7x7eth\n\n### Why continue funding Lil Sisters? \n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pU7JMhh.png)\nLil Sisters began as an easily found and supportive place for female and non-binary builders to access funding in the Lil Nouns. It quickly became an integral part of the Nounish ecosystem and a meaningful extension of Lil Nouns DAO. In the last five months, Lil Sisters Fund has successfully funded 18 proposals that directly helped teams of builders. Our proliferation efforts have resulted in 143,700 impressions for our Tweets, with the Lil Sisters community growing through weekly Twitter spaces, public coordination meetings, social connections on and offline, and ongoing creation of CC0 nounish illustrations for promotions and POAPs. Lil sisters are not only a group that funds proposals; they are individually engaged members of the Lil Nouns community. The team is dedicated to proliferating nounish projects and ideas through conversations, opportunities, onboarding, and multimedia content. Lil Sisters has been included in other artists' work, been written about in blog posts, and interviewed by Nounish and Stoopid Buddy. The Lil Sisters fund has allowed the production of CC0 nounish musical pieces, podcasts, coloring books, women’s soccer team, surfing school and more. We continue to onboard fresh talent into the Nounish ecosystem.\n\n\n### Current Progress \n\nWe have funded eighteen proposals;  3 funding rounds of 1 ETH x 5 winners, with 3 additional proposals funded in the last round:\n\n\n\n\n**First Round of Proposals**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WHHxU4m.png)\n\n\n\n**Second Round of Proposals**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/veszEXX.png)\n\n\n**Third Round of Proposals**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VfrsgAQ.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/labc9fg.png)\n\n\n\nFor further information on the progress of the proposals: https://www.notion.so/Lil-Sisters-Proposals-Winners-Tracker-bc93a35190fc409db635a596f31782da\n\n\nFor the Lil Sisters Art made by Ilustradora: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z6q0H-AsOqCV3JNOU5gE5pch7HssGKeg?usp=sharing\n\n\n### Metrics \n\nLil Sisters has generated through twitter spaces, challenges, giveaways, and interactions with the community the following:\n- Over 143,700 of Tweet Impressions \n- Over 1,224 of Twitter Mentions\n- Over 78,784 of Profile Visits\n- Over 600 of Followers\n- Over 853 of Twitter Space Listeners\n\n\n### Twitter Spaces\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KLvEMvv.jpg)\nWhile a TNS show is not our primary mission, to promote the Lil Sisters funding rounds, the team began hosting a SoapBox on The Noun Square. This has grown to be a vital marketing arm for Lil Nouns. With weekly Twitter Spaces that include interviews with project founders both inside and outside of the Nouniverse, we reach new communities while providing guests reach to our audience. The weekly POAP art by Ilustradora has made the collectible aspects extra special with the art becoming well known as representative of both Lil Sisters and Lil Nouns. Between Lil Sisters Spaces and art by Ilustradora, Lil Sisters has become key for the brand expansion of Lil Nouns.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/La5ehh3.jpg)\n  \n\n### Fund Management\n\nSisters budget:  **50 ETH**\n\nThe committee’s gnosis safe will require `3 of 5` Lil Nouners to sign, with Lil Nouns DAO acting as a largely symbolic owner and backup. We recommend keeping the signer group small with a team of experienced signers and adding more as we scale up operations and the pool size.\n\n**Team rotation**\nIn order to spread knowledge, boost decentralization and to ensure the pod is not overly reliant on any single member, member rotation is encouraged. A single pod member will be substituted at a time, not to create disruption in the work flow and maintain stability. There will be an open aplication process for the new team member, advertised on Twitter and discord. Applications will be reviewed and 3 candidates will be selected for interviews with the entire team. The first team member to open its seat for replacement will be B ([@beautyandpunk](https://twitter.com/beautyandpunk)).\n\n**Budget breakdown**\n\n\n- 25 ETH for proposal rounds (5 rounds of 5 ETH each)\n- 25 ETH for marketing and operations, which includes but is not limited to:\n    - Lil Sisters’ monthly compensation (Around 0.5 ETH for taking part in weekly meetings, planning and hosting weekly Twitter Spaces, reading and giving feedback on proposals from all funding rounds, answering questions in discord, etc.)\n    - Admin (Currently Mimix) monthly compensation (up to 2 ETH) for Twitter management, artist coordination, funding round coordination, etc.\n    - Ilustradora’s monthly compensation (0.5 ETH - primary creator for all of our Twitter account illustrations, announcements, and weekly POAPs given away in our Spaces)\n    - Discretionary funds for sponsorships of other podcasts/spaces such as BS Radio's Spaces with Betty from DeadFellaz\n    - Lil Nouns aquisition for giveaways during Twitter Spaces\n\n**Compensation is flexible at Lil Sisters. Those with lower work load, less compensation is agreed on, team members that take on more work, compensation are adjusted accordingly. We sometimes agree to give away our compensation to fund more builders or allocate to fast-moving sponsorship opportunities. All admin funds are accounted for on [our notion page](https://www.notion.so/Lil-Sisters-Admin-Fund-Txns-46e2c8be1bf7480b86cfbb7498177bd0).**\n\n**Timeframe**\n\n- If the Lils decide to fund this proposal, we'll choose a date a few weeks into the future for the next round and start marketing for builders to prepare their projects and proposals.\n- The duration of this project is for 5 rounds that are run for 5-6 months from date of approval, approximately early Feb 2023 - early/late July 2023.\n- Any funds not used by the end of this period will either be carried forward (in the case of another extension of Lil Sisters being approved) or returned to the DAO.\n- The team is aiming for monthly rounds, at the discretion of the Lil Sisters team, taking dao feedback into account.\n\nThank you for your consideration of the renewal of the Lil Sisters Fund.⌐◨-◨",

As an active member of the Ethereum community and a passionate advocate for decentralized technologies and communities, I believe that Lil Nouns' innovative approach to onboarding into the Nouns ecosystem aligns perfectly with the goals of this event.

I will ALSO attend the **official ETH Denver Mountain Retreat activation** on March 6th-9th, totaling a whopping **13 days of proliferation!**\n\n\n# Event Details\n\n## Venue\n\n**TETRA LOUNGE\nART ~ MUSIC ~ WEED \nDENVER’S PREMIER CANNABIS SOCIAL CLUB**\n**Voted Westwords \"Best Cannabis Lounge/Hospitality Space 2020 & 2022\"**\n\nTetra Private Lounge and Garden is Denver's premier private consumption lounge.

Such a dope venue and the owner is in the mix having fun with everyone there. Definitely recommend this for any event!!” \n   \n “Very chill, laid back environment with good vibes! So glad we found this spot before leaving Denver. The staff was very welcoming and friendly. We will definitely be back here!” \n \n“One of the most amazing experiences here in Colorado.” \n\n### Merch Booth\n* Pins \n* Shirts\n* Hats\n* Lighters \n* Fun Noggles\n* Secret swag\n\n(Some may not be applied)\n\n## Member Swag Bag\n\nI will work alongside Pxl to develop a **thoughtful gift bag** for all **Lil Nouns Holders** at Eth Denver and **all newly onboarded members**! (While supplies last)\n\n\n\n# Day Time Activities\n\n### Live Lil Nouns Auction display!\nWe will be encouraging live auction action by displaying the Lilnouns.wtf website on one of the many screens avaiable! We will also be showing amazing Lil Nouns art sourced from the community!\n\n### Lil Nouns Mini Basketball Tournament\nWearing my Meet The Nouns track suit, I, Bloomz will host mini basketball games for the Lil Nouns Lil Party! 1 off games for smaller prizes (**Basketballs, Stickers, LoFi Noggles**) and a tournament for a pool of **Grand Prizes**! What is the grand prize? ( **Fun Noggles, Lil Nouns, a Nintendo Switch!**). Giveaway of Lil Nouns for the top 2 winners of the tournament!\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Gi3gCbAm.jpg)\n\n### Lil Nouns Panel Talks/Discussions\n\nEducational talks on Lil Nouns and the community. \nDAO Discussions\nTLNS guest special live broadcast during the event possibly?\n\n### Mocktail bar \n\n# Night Time Entertainment\n\nTo enhance the overall experience of the event, we have arranged for a live DJ or music act to perform in the evening. We have one musician on standby and have spoken with a few other potential artists to provide a dynamic and entertaining atmosphere. This will be a great opportunity for attendees to enjoy live music while also engaging with the unique cannabis art collections and the free dab booth. Having a live DJ or music act will also provide a memorable and enjoyable experience for the attendees, making it an enjoyable evening for all. This will be a great way to provide an immersive experience for attendees, making the event more engaging and fun-filled.\n\n### Mocktail bar\n\n\n# Why \n[ETH Denver 2023 Hype video](https://www.ethdenver.com/overview)\n\nLil Nouns will be targeting a **key demographic** at this years **ETH Denver 2023**. Eth Denver is an annual event that focuses on the Ethereum blockchain and its community. The event typically includes hackathons, workshops, and presentations on various topics related to the Ethereum ecosystem, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and scaling solutions. \n\nWith community members on six continents, **ETHDenver #BUIDLathon + Workshop + Community Gathering + Innovation Festival** has proven itself as one of the most important events on the annual calendar for those interested in a decentralized / Web3 future. ETHDenver is the **world’s largest and longest-running Ethereum #BUIDLathon event**.\n\nOne reason why Eth Denver is considered to be a perfect event to proliferate at is due to the strong community focus. The event brings together a diverse group of developers, researchers, and enthusiasts from around the world, fostering collaboration and networking opportunities. Additionally, the hackathon format of the event encourages experimentation and innovation, which can lead to the development of new and exciting projects in the Ethereum ecosystem. Furthermore, it is a perfect platform for blockchain startups and projects to showcase their work and attract new users and investors.\n\n### Mountain Retreat activation March 6th-9th \n\nThe Mountain Retreat is your opportunity to host open source events and add them to the Official ETHDenver Mountain Retreat Calendar, just like #BUIDL Week. **Many projects, DAOs and friend groups will be hosting get-togethers at bars, restaurants, homes, etc, throughout the retreat**.‍ A mountain retreat after a conference can provide numerous benefits for attendees. The natural beauty and peaceful atmosphere of a mountain setting can help to clear the mind and provide a refreshing change of pace after the stimulation and activity of a conference.\n\nAdditionally, the secluded and remote location of a mountain retreat can foster a sense of camaraderie and community among attendees, as they bond over shared experiences and activities. The mountain retreat can also provide opportunities for team-building exercises, networking, and relaxation. The retreat can also offer a chance for attendees to disconnect from technology, and instead, focus on nature and mindfulness. This can be a great way to help attendees recharge and return home feeling refreshed and reinvigorated. \n\n**I will put together a Lil Nounish meet up at a bar up in breckenridge one of the nights! An ole fashion bar takeover I will buy everyone with a Lil Noun a beer so come on down!**\n\n**More Mountain Retreat detail can be found here!** [ETH Denver Mountain Retreat](https://www.ethdenver.com/festival/mountain-retreat)\n\n\n# High Level\n\n**I will handle production of Content creation throughout duration of ETH Denver and Mountain Retreat.** \n\n### Event Details (Continued) \nI have already reserved the venue for 1 of the main 10 days of ETH Denver for an outstanding event. This will include the **full day of the venue**, 10 hours, starting at 12pm- running until 10pm, potentially later!! I have been in communication with the CEO of Webstock and have secured DJ talent for the the evening part of the event. I have spoken with the cannabis sponsor and everything is set on reserve for that as well. I have a few more exciting secret things in the works as well, but cant cite any info here quite yet! \n\n### Mini Bball Tournament\n\n**Branding** \nThe whole Mini Basketball game will be **branded Lil Nouns**! Multiple flags being hung on the front and sides of the game itself (Pictured above). I will also be redesigning the backboard with a custom designed vinyl decal, designed by a fellow nounish artist in the community!\n\n**POAPs** to enter the tournament (gain access to the the POAP with just an email address). Using an IYK device to distribute, participants entering will be rewarded with a POAP that will help directly onboard to Lil Nouns. I will develop a strategy to include in the body of the POAP, that will drive traffic to Lil Nouns multiple avenues of engagment (Website, Twitter accounts, Discord, Etc.) This will also help to track success metrics of activation itself.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JVksSjbm.jpg)\n\n**Lil Nouns Basketballs** I would like to request 50 basketballs be sent to Denver for the event! I have already been in contact with VSVSVS and he confirmed he has plenty on hand ready to be shipped when needed.\n\n**Breakdown of Lil Basketballs**: \n* 20- Giftbags \n* 10- Basketball tournament game balls\n* 20- Giveaways at conference and mountain retreat \n\n\n## Budget \n\n**7.4 ETH** sent to 0xf9d71b5fB8345F2508C1302a74d4362DEAb7D104 (Bloomz)\n\n\n\n\n**Breakdown of budget included in link below** :arrow_down:  \n\n[Budget Breakdown](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SbVi119xAK5VGWfKnBsGZLNQDvNhqFgY6w6TMsBFmaQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n## Timeframe\n\n\n30th Jan - Submit proposal On chain\n\n5th - 24th Feb - Make arrangements for Lil Basketball game activation (secure giveaway balls and stickers, purchase hoop, any any other supplys for activation and send to Denver).

      "content": "My name is [Jonathan Little](https://twitter.com/JonathanLittle). I am a professional poker player, owner of multiple poker-related businesses, avid nft collector (I have 27 Lil Nouns), and I own and run the utility-based nft project [Deck of Degeneracy](\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/deckofdegeneracy) where almost all initial and secondary funds brought in (over $1,000,000 so far) have been given back to holders in various forms of utility (pieces of my poker tournament action, irl events, 1eth poker freeroll tournaments, and [nft art](https://opensea.io/collection/dodart)).\n\nI am launching my second project **Court of Degeneracy** soon where many of the pieces will have utility. I plan to include Noun glasses on 27 of the 10,000 pieces. I would love to be able to airdrop Lil Nouns to all holders of any piece with Noun glasses shortly after the launch of the project. \n\n![](https://imgur.com/PIqPFG2.jpg)\n\nThis will benefit Lil Nouns by having Noun glasses in the project as a prominent rare trait that will be promoted as one of the traits that include utility. I will also share Lil Nouns multiple times on my twitter and discord, driving attention to Lil Nouns. I have done this in the past for Lil Nouns because I like the project and a few holders of my first project Deck of Degeneracy are already Lil Noun holders. \n\nI will also include any Lil Noun holders on the Allow List, which will let them mint early for .0888eth instead of .1eth in the public sale. The Allow List sign up is here: https://forms.bueno.art/lilnouns\n\n**Budget**\n\nI will give away 27 Lil Nouns to Court of Degeneracy holders who have Noun glasses, so I need 27 x .15eth = 4.05eth. All of these funds will be used to mint Lil Nouns at the .15eth price as soon as possible. \n\nDeck of Degeneracy wallet: 0xEed4242F735Fa70eD1cf30DEAE41efb793Ea01f0\n\n**Prop Sponsor note:** I currently delegate my tokens to al409 who is submitting this proposal on chain on my behalf.

We have one musician on standby and have spoken with a few other potential artists to provide a dynamic and entertaining atmosphere. This will be a great opportunity for attendees to enjoy live music while also engaging with the unique cannabis art collections and the free dab booth. Having a live DJ or music act will also provide a memorable and enjoyable experience for the attendees, making it an enjoyable evening for all. This will be a great way to provide an immersive experience for attendees, making the event more engaging and fun-filled.\n\n### Dab Booth\n\n# Why \n[ETH Denver 2023 Hype video](https://www.ethdenver.com/overview)\n\nLil Nouns will be targeting a **key demographic** at this years **ETH Denver 2023**. Eth Denver is an annual event that focuses on the Ethereum blockchain and its community. The event typically includes hackathons, workshops, and presentations on various topics related to the Ethereum ecosystem, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and scaling solutions. \n\nWith community members on six continents, **ETHDenver #BUIDLathon + Workshop + Community Gathering + Innovation Festival** has proven itself as one of the most important events on the annual calendar for those interested in a decentralized / Web3 future. ETHDenver is the **world’s largest and longest-running Ethereum #BUIDLathon event**.\n\nOne reason why Eth Denver is considered to be a perfect event to proliferate at is due to the strong community focus. The event brings together a diverse group of developers, researchers, and enthusiasts from around the world, fostering collaboration and networking opportunities. Additionally, the hackathon format of the event encourages experimentation and innovation, which can lead to the development of new and exciting projects in the Ethereum ecosystem. Furthermore, it is a perfect platform for blockchain startups and projects to showcase their work and attract new users and investors.\n\n### Mountain Retreat activation March 6th-9th \n\nThe Mountain Retreat is your opportunity to host open source events and add them to the Official ETHDenver Mountain Retreat Calendar, just like #BUIDL Week. **Many projects, DAOs and friend groups will be hosting get-togethers at bars, restaurants, homes, etc, throughout the retreat**.‍ A mountain retreat after a conference can provide numerous benefits for attendees. The natural beauty and peaceful atmosphere of a mountain setting can help to clear the mind and provide a refreshing change of pace after the stimulation and activity of a conference.\n\nAdditionally, the secluded and remote location of a mountain retreat can foster a sense of camaraderie and community among attendees, as they bond over shared experiences and activities. The mountain retreat can also provide opportunities for team-building exercises, networking, and relaxation. The retreat can also offer a chance for attendees to disconnect from technology, and instead, focus on nature and mindfulness. This can be a great way to help attendees recharge and return home feeling refreshed and reinvigorated. \n\n**I will put together a Lil Nounish meet up at a bar up in breckenridge one of the nights! An ole fashion bar takeover I will buy everyone with a Lil Noun a beer so come on down!**\n\n**More Mountain Retreat detail can be found here!** [ETH Denver Mountain Retreat](https://www.ethdenver.com/festival/mountain-retreat)\n\n\n# High Level\n\n**I will handle production of Content creation throughout duration of ETH Denver and Mountain Retreat.** \n\n### Event Details (Continued) \nI have already reserved the venue for 1 of the main 10 days of ETH Denver for an outstanding event. This will include the **full day of the venue**, 10 hours, starting at 12pm- running until 10pm, potentially later!! I have been in communication with the CEO of Webstock and have secured DJ talent for the the evening part of the event. I have spoken with the cannabis sponsor and everything is set on reserve for that as well. I have a few more exciting secret things in the works as well, but cant cite any info here quite yet! \n\n### Mini Bball Tournament\n\n**Branding** \nThe whole Mini Basketball game will be **branded Lil Nouns**! Multiple flags being hung on the front and sides of the game itself (Pictured above). I will also be redesigning the backboard with a custom designed vinyl decal, designed by a fellow nounish artist in the community!\n\n**POAPs** to enter the tournament (gain access to the the POAP with just an email address). Using an IYK device to distribute, participants entering will be rewarded with a POAP that will help directly onboard to Lil Nouns. I will develop a strategy to include in the body of the POAP, that will drive traffic to Lil Nouns multiple avenues of engagment (Website, Twitter accounts, Discord, Etc.) This will also help to track success metrics of activation itself.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JVksSjbm.jpg)\n\n**Lil Nouns Basketballs** I would like to request 50 basketballs be sent to Denver for the event! I have already been in contact with VSVSVS and he confirmed he has plenty on hand ready to be shipped when needed.\n\n**Breakdown of Lil Basketballs**: \n* 20- Giftbags \n* 10- Basketball tournament game balls\n* 20- Giveaways at conference and mountain retreat \n\n\n## Budget \n\n**9.38 ETH** sent to 0xf9d71b5fB8345F2508C1302a74d4362DEAb7D104 (Bloomz)\n\n\n\n\n**Breakdown of budget included in link below** :arrow_down:  \n\n[Budget Breakdown](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SbVi119xAK5VGWfKnBsGZLNQDvNhqFgY6w6TMsBFmaQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n## Timeframe\n\n\n26th Jan - Submit proposal to Lil Funding\n\n30th Jan - 24th Feb - Make arrangements for Lil Basketball game activation (secure giveaway balls and stickers, purchase hoop, any any other supplys for activation and send to Denver).

      "title": "The Lil Nouns Show - Second Term",
      "content": "# TL;DR\n**A proven team, committed to providing value and reach for Lil Nouns DAO, via a weekly twitter spaces show and podcast. This proposal follows on from a successfully funded on chain proposal [Proposal 68](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/68) and looks to continue funding for a further three months.**\n\n# What is The Lil Nouns Show?\n\n- [The Lil Nouns Show](https://twitter.com/TheLilNounsShow) is a weekly Lil Nouns centered twitter spaces show, hosted on [The Noun Square](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare) #SoapBox.\n- The show consists of a team of four co-hosts who also take on the roles of researchers, operations and guest bookings.\n- The show looks to position itself as the customer facing ‘front of house’ for Lil Nouns DAO.\n- Operating mainly on Twitter, we look to provide a platform for other like-minded communities to come speak with our community and also teach those communities about Lil Nouns. The ultimate aim being the onboarding of minded people into the DAO. \n\n# Prior Funding\n\n- [Lil Funding](https://www.addressform.io/board/details/689ad3b5-7a88-4ad0-8ba0-4d57703d7636/the-lil-nouns-show-retro-funding-pilot-month/2927) - We have completed a one month, four episode pilot in which we received retro funding at a cost to the DAO of 0.125 ETH per host, per episode. Totalling 2 ETH.\n- [On Chain Proposal](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/68) - Proposal 68 was an on chain proposal to Lil Nouns DAO that passed **1185 votes** to 334. A total of 47 unique addresses voted ‘for’ with just 4 addresses voting ‘against’ making it one of the most successful proposals in Lil Nouns DAO history. There were no abstain votes recorded. \n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/1ZKrq5m/Screenshot-2023-01-04-133247.png)\n![](https://i.ibb.co/0htRr5v/Screenshot-2023-01-04-133143.png)\n\n# What we promised Vs What we have delivered\n\nIn Proposal 68 we set a number of short term goals for the period of months 1-3 of the show. These can be found below and in the interest of openness, have not been modified in any way and have been taken directly from our last proposal. Our response to the goals we set can be found under each point in italics.\n\n- **Connect with other communities within the web3 space to raise awareness of Lil Nouns and learn from the experiences and experimentation of other projects.** *We have hosted a variety of shows with other communities such as mfers, Cryptoadz, Moonbirds, sn00uns, Howlerz and many others. During these shows we have spoken about governance structures, use of prop house and voting amongst other topics in the interest of Lil Nouns DAO community members.*\n- **Continue to onboard valuable members into the Lil Nouns ecosystem.** *This is extremely difficult to measure and as of yet, there is no definitive way to measure how someone was on boarded into the DAO less for asking each individual. As a result of hosting shows with other communities we have seen those communities come into the Lil Nouns discord numerous times and buy tokens either live on air or immediately after.*\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/RBmCgPm/Screenshot-2022-12-21-at-22-22-42.png) \n- **Engage with current Lil Nouns holders to try to increase the voting turnout on https://lilnouns.wtf/ via education on the show.** *We commit at least 50% of our shows running time to promoting, and discussing with, Lil Nouns DAO holders and those building within our ecosystem. We devote a period of the show to highlight and signpost people to **ALL** live on chain proposals and prop house rounds.* \n- **Utilise other forms of media to increase engagement on twitter such as clipped soundbites from previous episodes (we will look to push out up to 3 clips in the week post the show airing).** *We have been releasing soundbites to run alongside our weekly promotion of the next show sporadically or when there is valuable information spoken about on a show we want to give further reach too. We have not hit the number of 3 clips a week as was a goal in our original proposal but have instead pivoted to creating a podcast of each show to be released across all major podcast hosting sites.* \n- **Increase Twitter impressions to 100k + over a 28 day period.** *Our rolling 28 day twitter impressions stand at 111k which is 11,000 over our goal.*\n- **Increase Twitter profile visits to 15k + over a 28 day period.** *Our twitter profile visits currently stand at 24.1k visits which is 9,100 over our goal.*\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/jDqbBsC/Screenshot-2023-01-04-133922.png)\n\nWe also set a number of ‘Longer term goals 3 months +’ in our original proposal. These goals still stand for this funding refill proposal and are as follows:\n\n- **Become the ‘not to be missed’ show within the Lil Nouns ecosystem.\nUpload each episode to various podcast hosting websites in order to maximise the reach of the show.** *This has been brought forward into our short term goals. We received 1 ETH funding from a [TNS prop house](https://prop.house/the-noun-square/round-2/2433) round to enable us to carry this out with all episodes currently in production before delivery to podcast hosting sites soon.*\n- **Re-evaluate our Twitter metrics from months 1-3 and set new goals to achieve in terms of driving engagement and visibility.** *Whilst we won't set a number, we will look to improve on all metrics during this second 3 month term.*\n- **Look to be re-funded via Lil Nouns or Nouns via an on-chain proposal.** *This proposal to Lil Nouns DAO looks to address this. It is our aim to continue to explore funding via Nouns DAO on completion of this funding round.*\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/nn9rPxP/Screenshot-2023-01-20-134247.png)\n# But, what else?\nAside from what we promised in our short term goals, here are some other things we are proud of:\n\n- # **6793 listeners over 13 shows**\n- # **1719 POAPs claimed**\n- # **The #1 listened to #SoapBox show on The Noun Square.**\n# What will we do next?\nWe’re proud of everything we have achieved in the first ‘season’ of TLNS, but that doesn’t mean we don’t want bigger and better things as we head into season two. In the first half of 2023 will aim to:\n\n- **Showcase and leverage** Lil’s position as the fourth largest voter in Nouns governance; become the go-to show for those with Nouns proposals to come and pitch to Lil Nouns.\n- Explore how TLNS can become a **sustainable and self-funding** Twitter space show, through sponsorship, partnerships, mints etc.\n- Establish a strong **brand identity** for TLNS and take this cross-platform to **increase the reach** of TLNS outside of Twitter.\n- Invest in professional podcasting equipment to **level-up the quality** of the TLNS audio-experience.\n- Maintain our position as the **number one** #SoapBox show on TNS and bring new listeners to the platform itself, NOC and other #SoapBox shows.\n# A Lil Pilot\nAs we consider how we can maximise the reach of Lil Nouns through the Twitter spaces format, one clear observation is the impact hosting a daily space can have on growing an organic and engaged community. With this in mind, as part of this funding the TLNS team will trial running a daily Twitter space show with a one week pilot.\n\nThe format, style and timing of this show will all be open for discussion and debate within the Lil community, however our initial thoughts are:\n\n- A one hour daily show, Monday-Friday.\n- Discussing news from across the NFT and web3 space, not just the nouniverse.\n- Putting a nounish POV on a range of topics and debates.\n- Continue on our mission to connect with other communities and bring in a range of speakers and commentators each show.\n# The Lil Nouns Show format\nWe currently run a 2/3 to 1/3 structure on our shows. We like to invite a guest from outside of the community (another community/individual) who we think would provide value to the Lil Nouns audience but also allow us to profile Lil Nouns to them. This section of the show usually takes up 2/3 of our show time.\nTo date, we have hosted the following external guests:\n- [Henry the Grape](https://twitter.com/HenryTheGrape) - CyberKongz Community Manager\n- [mfers](https://twitter.com/unofficialmfers) - Community Managers and community\n- [Gian the Rios](https://twitter.com/GianTheRios) - Web3 Biz Dev & Marketing Director for SwapBox\n- [Zeneca](https://twitter.com/Zeneca_33) - Founder and CEO of Zen Academy and The 333 Club (booked as a guest for Ep. 4 on Halloween)\n- [MotivateMe](https://twitter.com/MotivateMeV2?s=20&t=dLiediTkCfVVivdkPlslpQ) - Community Manager for Cryptoadz\n- [Nonfungiblenoah](https://twitter.com/NonFungibleNoah?s=20&t=dLiediTkCfVVivdkPlslpQ) - Brand Lead for CryptoPunkz and HowlerzNFT Founder\n- [Ryan Carson](https://twitter.com/ryancarson?s=20&t=dLiediTkCfVVivdkPlslpQ) - Host of Daily Dose twitter spaces show.\n- [Toby Lasso](https://twitter.com/tobylasso) - Founder of Nocturnal and manager to Vinnie Hager\n- [Josie Bellini](https://twitter.com/josiebellini) - Founder & Artist of CyberBrokers\n- [OnChainMonkey](https://twitter.com/OnChainMonkey?s=20&t=dLiediTkCfVVivdkPlslpQ) - Founding Team\n- [n00uns](https://twitter.com/snounsdao?s=20&t=L95tzYhOICJB61UTiijnNg) - Founders of Solana Nouns\n- [OtakuJake](https://twitter.com/otakujake_pro?s=20&t=L95tzYhOICJB61UTiijnNg) - Founder of Uniqly\n- [Jose Vasconez](https://twitter.com/Xenophan_?s=20&t=dLiediTkCfVVivdkPlslpQ) - Senior Manager of NFTs at Paramount Pictures\n- [DarrenSRS](https://twitter.com/DarrenSRS?s=20&t=L95tzYhOICJB61UTiijnNg) - Building Open Metaverse with Punk6529\n- [Sekure D](https://twitter.com/SekureD?s=20&t=dLiediTkCfVVivdkPlslpQ) - Artist/Founder of RoboGhosts and brand advisor to Jordan, Nike and Adidas\n- [Andrei](https://twitter.com/andreitr?s=20&t=L95tzYhOICJB61UTiijnNg) - Founder of BotFrens\nThe last 1/3 of the show is reserved for us, our community and allows us to platform those Lil Nouners who are building in the community that want to come up and tell people all about it. \n![](https://i.ibb.co/NTfVRzG/9-E0-BB778-9-D3-A-4407-9691-F66-F717-DCF56.jpg)\n# The Lil Nouns Show team\nTeam Bios\n- **April** - I’m April, a web3 enthusiast who has been exploring the NFT space for over a year now, yet to my detriment I only properly dove into the Nouns eco-system a couple of months ago. Since then I have become obsessed with how this dream of an open-source brand can succeed. Outside of this world my background is in PR & communications (in-house & agency side) having worked for many years in Amsterdam and London, before following my other passion (skiing) and moving to the other side of the world. When I’m not chatting about Nouns, you’ll find me hanging with Moonbirds & Creatures.\n- **Cardno** - I entered the space at the back end of 2021, around Christmas time. I initially became aware of NFTs through the visibility on twitter of BAYC (of course) and after falling into the ‘Fast Food Punks’ discord, (strange, I know) I found myself on a call with the founder within 10 minutes and being given an NFT 101 chat from him. I was onboarded. Since then, I have been a moderator of various projects such as 3Landers, Chimpers and Lorem. I have also been the host of the official 3Landers twitter spaces show. I am currently a signer for Lil Funding Gnosis wallet in Lil Nouns and have just been voted in as a Lil Representative. \n- **Crxsher** - I entered the space in February 2021, first in crypto, then in NFTs on Harmony, and finally in Ethereum in April. My first purchase was a piece of Sandbox land, which I then traded for two BAYC Apes, and the rest is history. I’ve had a few successes, made many mistakes, but what has never wavered is my belief that Web3 constitutes a major shift in how the world will interact in the future. I’m a frequent guest on many Twitter spaces in addition to co-hosting the 3Landers spaces, hoping to share, engage, learn and grow as we move forward in NFTs. I’m most active these days in BAYC, Ghxsts, Chimpers, Zen Academy and Lil Nouns, although you’ll find me engaging in several others as well.\n- **English** - I entered this space as a research consultant for a friend who was looking to leverage their musical IP assets in web 3. Upon my research I engaged with multiple communities and ended up moderating for 3landers and Lorem.

Continuation of writing the Weekly Newsletter**\n**2. Adding Weekly Twitter threads**\n**3. 30% pay decrease from last proposal that passed**\n\nPrevious Proposals:\n- [Proposal 66](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/66) → Passed (For: 1,030; Against: 0; Abstained: 9)\n- [Proposal 83](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/83) and [Proposal 48](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/48) were also put on chain but did not hit quorum\n---\n\n## Description\nThe purpose of the newsletter is to curate, synthesize, summarize, and educate people—both internal and external to the Lil Nouns DAO—on all things (Lil) Nounish happening in our community each week. We share stories of builders, props, and conversations across the Lil Nouniverse, so that readers don’t miss each week’s biggest events.\n\n**The Lil Nouns Weekly Newsletter has shipped every week for the past 31 weeks, without fail** 🫡\n\nLet's dive into some numbers:\n\n- 257 subscribers\n- 12% average month-over-month growth\n- 59% average open rate\n- 5,100+ page views to the Newsletter\n- 368 Twitter followers: [Lil Nouns News](https://twitter.com/lilnounsnews)\n- 8,200+ Impressions on Twitter since starting threads last month\n\n[![Substack-Dashboard-Lil-Nouns-Weekly-Newsletter-2023-01-12-at-1-25-11-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Z0tYxkJX/Substack-Dashboard-Lil-Nouns-Weekly-Newsletter-2023-01-12-at-1-25-11-PM.png)](https://postimg.cc/64cNBm2h)\n\n**The Twitter threads seem to be resonating as a way to onboard new folks into our Lil Nouniverse!**\n\nBelow are the analytics from the first Twitter thread (Dec 11th) and the most recent Twitter thread (Jan 8th):\n[![Lil-Nouns-Playground-Figma-2023-01-12-at-1-36-18-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/kgwczqLN/Lil-Nouns-Playground-Figma-2023-01-12-at-1-36-18-PM.png)](https://postimg.cc/BjLH19St)\n\n## Scope\n_\"One Newsletter, Every Sunday, Forever\"_\n\nWhat goes into a great weekly newsletter?\n- Curate information happening in Lil Nouns DAO (succinct but cohesive)\n- Ensure high engagement on Proposals and other votes\n- Synthesize important information across the ecosystem\n- Recap past events, and make community members aware of upcoming events\n- Proliferate the Noun meme to members outside of the DAO (this is where Twitter threads come in)\n\n## Past Discussion\n\n- [Discord Thread](https://discord.com/channels/954142017556979752/1053419662068695060) in #Proposal-Ideas\n\n## Funds Requested\nSince we are in a bear market—and thanks to the example of Lil Al and others who have roles that require recurring pay—I am choosing to decrease my ask. \n\nPreviously, the DAO paid 1 ETH per week (see: [Prop 66](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/66) for the period of Sept, Oct, Nov). I am decreasing my ask by 30%, down to .7 ETH per week.\n\n- **Total: 11.9 ETH** (.7 ETH/episode x 17 Weeks)\n- **Period: December-March** (retro for 4 Sundays in Dec + 5 Sundays in Jan + 4 Sundays in Feb + 4 Sundays in Mar)",

      "content": "## A Lil Nouns Sponsorship Proposal\n\n\n## TLDR: 6.9 ETH to sponsor and brand 420 Tasty Trivia Events as Lil Nounish\n(That’s just .016 ETH per event! This would be roughly a 6-month activation)\n\n*Robust version:*\n\nThere are so many ways to proliferate the meme and brand of Lil Nouns, so this proposal drives that attention toward already established IRL events in the Central Florida area. Tasty Trivia has been operating live trivia and bingo events throughout the greater Orlando area since 2012 and currently has consistent weekly events, special monthly theme events, and a flow of events running constantly. \n\nMarketing is all about visibility and consistency, ultimately going after the attention of the end user. In this proliferation activation, Lil Nouns, the Noggles, and a variety of memes will be used in the following ways:\n\n- Noggles and Lil Nouns web URL on trivia sheets used by teams\n- Noggles and Lil Nouns web URL on Facebook events promoting the nights\n- Noggles and Lil Nouns web URL on website events (see website traffic graphic below)\n- Images of winners and hosts with Noggles\n\n### Summary/Backstory of Tasty Trivia:\n\nTasty Trivia is Entertainment Marketing. From connecting amazing talent to the venues that want live events to online engagement, Tasty Trivia specializes in utilizing fun, interactive games as marketing tools to promote products, increase sales, and generate visibility across internet platforms and physical locations.\n\nWe strive to produce some of the most appealing, transaction-driven entertainment available anywhere, specializing in small business growth and development.\n\n### One Month of Tasty Trivia Website Traffic:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uUleLQm.png)\n\n\n### 2022 Website Traffic for Tasty Trivia:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6FbUSqN.png)\n\n### Facebook:\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/Eq6hBDL.jpg)\n](https://)\n\nCheck out this 5-minute run down of me showing you exactly what I mean and where:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/RUrhI04P7go\n\n\n## Scope\n\nProliferation of the brand across 420 events in Central Florida. We estimate this to be just about 6 months of events, some months have closer to 80 while others are closer to 65. The Noggles and Lil Nouns visibility will be prominent across:\n\n- trivia sheets\n- online promotion\n- images of nounish activities\n\nThe goal of this proposal is anchoring the nounish vibes with irl events that are consistently occurring each week at venues throughout the Orlando area. \n\nConsistency and repetition. Consistency and repetition. This is how we can impact new individuals to build curiosity and engagement toward onboarding new and interesting people.\n\nDiscussion in #Proposal-Ideas: [(Let's Chat!)](https://discord.com/channels/954142017556979752/1041907327084810280/1041907327084810280)\n\n## Funds Requested\n\nTotal: 6.9 ETH to sponsor 420 events\n\n\n",

      "content": "## TL;DR\nMy name is [Arash](https://twitter.com/arashslacker?s=21&t=Pyl1UEvScSEsJs4S0w-2bQ), I am a video game and animation creator. I would like to create a one-minute introductory animation video, and I am proposing a unique process for doing so.\n\n- Initiate a Mandated Prop House round so builders submit a video script and community votes on the most interesting one;\n- From there, I will choose one that best fits the budget and scope of the project and proceed to create the animation video;\n- 1-2 week(s) before video is complete, a Marketing Prop House round will be initiated get more eyes on the video. Inspired by [$200k Video Marketing Contest](https://prop.house/nouns/$200k-video-marketing-contest).\n\nMy total ask is 8 ETH; 1.5 ETH allocated to two Mandated Prop House rounds, and 7 ETH for creating the animation video.\n\n## Introduction\nGM everyone, I'm [Arash](https://twitter.com/arashslacker?s=21&t=Pyl1UEvScSEsJs4S0w-2bQ), a video game and animation director. Here's some of the work I have done:\n- [Lil Nouns Music Video](https://twitter.com/ArashSlacker/status/1603321209613127680?s=20&t=7reei4hWvrg9tCth14J7MA) funded by Lil Nouns' [Content Pod](https://discord.com/channels/954142017556979752/1016388331602460773);\n- this [Shrimpy Noun in a Burger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e-3rIzsQWw) animation video;\n- this [I'm The Bomb animation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQjWXc2EHQk);\n- or this [Nounish GIPHY channel](https://giphy.com/channel/ArashNegahban/nounish) hosting a growing set of Nounish GIFs;\n- additionally, if you take a look at [my Twitter media](https://twitter.com/ArashSlacker/media), you will find even more Nounish animation content I have made in the past six months.\n\nWhat [Ordinary Folk did for Nouns]( https://twitter.com/ordinaryfolkco/status/1603200528162656257/video/1) inspired me to create a community-written, Lil Nouns-specific video.\n\n## Here's the plan...\nI want to create a community-driven, fun, informative, 1-minute Lil Nouns DAO introductory video by leveraging Prop House so that builders submit a script for a 1-minute video, Lil Nouners vote for the most interesting one, and I create the video using the top voted script. Here is a breakdown of the process:\n- 1.5 ETH will be transferred directly to Lil Nouns' Prop House wallet address to launch 2 mandated Prop House rounds;\n    - 2 x 0.4 ETH Prop House round for a video script. Lil Nouners vote for a script they'd like me to use for creating an animation video.\n    - 2 x 0.35 ETH Prop House round for marketing the video. I.\n- I will pick one that best suits the scope of the project and work with the proposer to finalize the script.\n- Using the finalized script, I create the 1-minute animation video.\n- 1-2 week(s) before finalizing the animation video, the second mandated Prop House round will be launched to market the animation video. Inspired by [$200k Video Marketing Contest](https://prop.house/nouns/$200k-video-marketing-contest).\n\n\n## Video Animation Topics\nAlthough topics are open, I have observed there is a lack of content around these topics:\n\n1. What a Nounish content actually means.\n2. DAO mechanism explanation.\n3. DAO's passion for attracting developers, artists, and ideologists in all fields.\n4. Investment in a fully decentralized ecosystem.\n5. Explaining other parts of the DAO like prop house and such.\n\n## Budget\n- 1.5 ETH - 2 mandated Prop House rounds; \n    - 0.4 ETH x 2 Winners = 0.8 ETH\n    - 0.35 ETH x 2 Winners = 0.7 ETH\n- 7 ETH - Create animation video\n\n**TOTAL - 8.5 ETH**\n\n## Timeline\n- Finalizing the script: 2-3 weeks\n- Working on Animation: 6-8 weeks\n- Prop House Round for Marketing the video: 1-2 weeks\n\nI am excited to work with the community to create and market a fun and informative video about Lil Nouns DAO.\n\narash wallet address: 0x4756e5a5D0668195Feb1EC0e7F96832ffc51c4A8\nprop house wallet address: 0x3cf9179127590e16348454886cdd7e7d4aad3693",

This will not only give contributors a chance to make their contributions more visible; it will also allow the community to recognize the value of these contributions.\n\nAs part of the Retro Prop House round, 2.5 ETH will be paid out to 3 top voted winners. 0.2 ETH will be paid to the Prop House team for their help in setting this up.\n\nUpon successful execution, a monthly cadence of Retro Prop House will be considered.\n\n## Cost\nRetro Prop House: 2.5 ETH to 3 Contributors = 7.5 ETH\nProp House team: 0.2 ETH\n\n**TOTAL: 7.7 ETH**",

Whatsoever do you mean?\n\nIn EJGSTW, each new scenario is based on a current event, hence the tag of “interactive political cartoon.” After we do 5 proof of concept levels to get the community used to the game, the community will decide the scenario for level 6, 7, 8, and so on!\n\nFor instance, if the community wants to make Edward a playable character in the SBF trial, that’s the scenario we cook up, so you can save the world!\n\nWe also hope to work with @SuperTightWoody to supply our soundtrack as stems for nounsounds.wtf.\n\nWho Are We?\n\nA team of 10 that has built dApps in partnership with Microsoft and Dapper Labs.\n\nTeam:\n\nhttps://tmtlabs.xyz — Smart contracts, blockchain integration\nhttps://staqo.com — Full stack devs\nhttps://twitter.com/mantisunbranded — AV\nhttps://twitter.com/tanujdamani — PM\n\nTimeline:\n\n60 days — completion of 5 introductory levels; beta testing\n90 days — web3 integration, nounsounds.wtf integration, website rollout\n120, 150, 180, 210… — at least one new level per month, perpetual marketing campaign, seek outside funding to grow into a new Nouns metaverse\n\nI personally have 10+ years of pro experience as a creative; the team as a whole has more than a century of XP and count Riot Games, Activision, Verizon, Discover, Twitch, Amazon and Nike as clients!\n\nSo what makes this game special?\n\n1. I guarantee a wholly unique, very Nounish, 100% degen play experience you’ve never seen anywhere else!\n2. I have a passion for hand drawn art. I will never go pixel or AAA for this studio; everything will be hand drawn.\n3. The interactivity in choosing the scenarios is a new feature that will provide ongoing entertainment for the community. Nouns will be a part of the most important news in crypto, in real time!\n4. The ability to earn Nouns related NFTs through play provides a perpetual onboarding bridge into the Nouns ecosystem without causing the DAO an ongoing expense.\n5. I have access to a different audience from anyone else in web3 — underserved colleges in the US — and will begin connecting this audience to the Nouns ecosystem starting with this game.\n\nMarketing\nThere are several ways to effectively market EJGSTW without undue cost to the DAO. Within the ask, we will perform:\n\nThere’s a few ways we plan to market the game including:\n\n— Social Media Optimization: Although EJGSTW will be steeped in Nouns lore and easter eggs, it is a game that all web3 audiences can enjoy. We plan to optimize social media posts, engage the podcast circuit, and lead Twitter Spaces to consistently bring in new players.\n\n— App Store Optimization (ASO): We will localize content and perform app store optimizations to bring in players from around the world, even those who don’t know anything about web3.\n\n— Web page: The website will not only teach people about EJGSTW, but also about the web3 culture surrounding it. The website will include links to download from the app stores as well as links to other Nouns projects like nounsounds that we are building on top of.\n\n— Our web2 infrastructure: We have unique placement with colleges and industry leading sponsors like Amazon, Twitch, Nike, Verizon, Riot Games, Discover, Microsoft and Comcast through our investment in Cxmmunity, a web2 gaming company. We will use these resources and our connections to 300,000 students at 50+ US colleges to help bridge the gap between web2 and web3 using EJGSTW. This is also a sponsor network we can tap for future funding rounds to grow the game and help NounsDAO manage its risk.\n\nThe Ask\n\n9 ETH\n\nFunds Breakdown:\n\n1.5 ETH — smart contract integration\n1.5 ETH — subscription dependencies (game engine, plugins)\n2 ETH — App Store Optimization and Social Media Optimization\n5 ETH — Create yield farm to perpetually buy GnarsDAO and LilNouns NFTs for item drops in-game\n0 ETH — All voice acting, music, art design, game design and game logic is a labor of love — free for Nouns!\n\nFunding will last perpetually, because the yield farm will also cover odds and ends as we produce new levels for the game every month.\n\nProof of concept is complete (see “Click the triangle for Proof of Concept Vids & Screenshots!” above and click the arrow if you haven’t already). We’re hoping to start integration with Nouns by January 2023.",

      "title": "Get-By X Lil Nouns - Second Chances Are Nounish!",
      "content": "## 1. Create co-branded merchandise to proliferate the Lil Nouns and Nounish DAOs while also raising awareness around Get-By and fair-chance hiring. \n\n## 2. Support Get-By by funding launch expenses and initial marketing efforts to include Job Fairs.\n---\n\n### Summary \nGet-By connects formerly incarcerated and underemployed people with small business owners looking to fill on-demand shifts. Get-By operates a mobile on-demand marketplace with pre-screened and pre-vetted applicants, allowing managers to make quick and data-driven hiring decisions while alleviating the stress of finding workers urgently. Get-By serves as an opportunity for the underemployed to establish professional relationships, credibility and begin on a path towards long-term employment. Get-By is an Anchorage Alaska based Business to Business Software and Staffing as a Service business. This proposal will support Get-By by raising awareness around fair-chance hiring while proliferating the NounsDAO and associating it with a social impact business.\n\nFunds proposed will be used to launch Get-By and to integrate Nounish branding into the display of the Initial Get-By Job Fair booth. The intention for this proposal is to lay the groundwork for future collaborations between Get-By and NounsDAO/subDAOs to market and connect Web3 employment opportunities to formerly incarcerated and underemployed job seekers. This initial proposal will allow Lilskrtskrt to inform potential job seekers that the funding to launch Get-By was sourced from this community! How can this community be a vehicle for them to achieve their dreams?!\n\n### Goal of Proposal\nThis is a nounish proposal that seeks to build collaboration between the NounsDAO and subDAOs and a social impact business Get-By, proliferating the Nounish brand while making the ecosystem and community more accessible to more of our formerly incarcerated community members. \n\n### Detailed Explanation\nThrough a CCO co-branding relationship Lilskrtskrt.eth seeks to:\n\na. Proliferate the Lil Nouns and Nounish DAOs brand and culture:\n(*Print T-shirts & Other Merch, Banners, Noggles, Contest at Booth, IRL Giveaways*)\nb. Associate the Lil Nouns and Nounish DAOs with goodwill and building social capital in marginalized communities:\n(*Use Successful Prop Funding from Lil Nouns DAO to launch a business to create jobs for people who need them, \"every time a prop builder gets funded, that's a part time job\", let's educateworkers on how they can find Nouns funding to pursue their own dreams!*)\n\n### Previous Press\n**Photos:** Here are photos of Lilskrtskrt.eth in Get-By merch (initial run printed locally)\n\na. Lilskrtskrt.eth speaking to Representative Calvin Schrage (I-Anchorage) with some Get-By Merch and Info at an Anchorage Reentry Simulation (June 2022)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PsGasMu.jpg)\n\nb. Lilskrtskrt.eth wearing Get-By Crewneck after working the first ever shift on the Get-By platform at South Restaurant (Anchorage, AK)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0S5AIQe.jpg)\n\nc. Lilskrtskrt.eth wearing a Get-By hoodie.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GZGvsMf.png)\n\n**Videos:** Here are some videos of Lilskrtskrt.eths previous presentations on Get-By over the course of the past year:\n\na. One Millions Cups April 2022: https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=502612314984812\n\nb. gBETA Accelerator Showcase pitch April 2022 (People's Choice Winner): \nhttps://www.facebook.com/dimitri.alexiadis/videos/569200024566773\n\nc.

Accelerate Alaska: Alaska Pitchfest November 2022 (People's Choice & Most Innovative Business Winner):\nhttps://www.facebook.com/reel/635222938287066\n\n**Podcast:** Here is a podcast where Lilskrtskrt.eth tells his personal reentry story and how it led to Get-By:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dimitrios-alexiadis/id477943915?i=1000585407681\n\n**Twitter Space:** Here is a recent Foodnouns Friday Twitter Space where Lilskrtskrt.eth discusses Get-By in depth: \nhttps://twitter.com/i/spaces/1ZkKzXQLvXwJv\n\n### Proliferation / Utility\na. This proposal will proliferate the NounsDAO meme and culture by proliferating the Lil Nouns DAO and Nounish subDAOs through its aesthetic use of the noggles and Lil Nouns characters. The Get-By logo is aesthetically similar to the NounsDAO logo, the two logos will be displayed together. The nounish merchandise that will be designed/funded through this proposal will aid Lilskrtskrt in successfully launching the business while raising awareness about the Nouns and Web3 ecosystems. \n\nAny interested parties who approach the Job Fair Booth will have the opportunity to (win/receive) merchandise by playing a game or scanning a QR code at the Booth.\n\n***This merchandise will be available at the Job Fair Booth and for the initial cohort of workers, later online for purchase, we want to be sure that our first cohort of workers have their swag.***\n\nb. The culture of nounishness is synonymous with the values of Get-By:\n\n*Get-By was founded as an attempt to solve a problem that lilskrtskrt.eth faces himself, he saw a void in available opportunities and decided to create a solution that matches his lived experience. He has bootstrapped the business to this point and has found difficulty accessing funding, while being unemployed. This proposal and collaboration, if successful, would provide adequate funding to launch the business and recruit a first cohort of shift workers. This proposal could be a pilot for setting standards/expectations for the NounsDAO/subDAOs for working with marginalized entrepreneurs.*\n\nc. In addition to further proliferating the meme and culture, this proposal would add goodwill and social capital to the ecosystem. It would draw the attention of organizations already involved in fair-chance work to the Lil Nouns DAO & Nounish subDAOs (include list of businesses from Second Chance Business Coalition that have made the second chance pledge: [LINK HERE](https://https://secondchancebusinesscoalition.org/press-releases/major-u-s-employers-commit-to-advancing-second-chance-employment)  and the opportunity that this protocol could provide to all sorts of different social justice issues.\n\n***This could be a new pathway to gain recognition from large stakeholders via building goodwill and being in the same room as people who care about change.***\n\n### Team / Qualifications\nLilskrtskrt.eth has spent the last 7 years living in Anchorage as a reintegrated citizen. Post release he decided to formalize his technical abilities, learning to use data to inform decision making while performing database management and modeling analyses in life sciences and blockchain applications. He did so to be more competitive in the workplace. Ultimately Lilskrtskrt was not able to transition into professional roles due to a lack of credibility. Instead he has hopped from one small business to another working as a busser, dishwasher, delivery driver, food production assistant, server, cold caller, accounting technician, and data entry specialist. Get-By is the answer to this inefficient and ineffective pattern of employment, and his passion for technology and social justice. If you would like to hear more about Lilskrtskrts personal reentry story, please listen to the Podcast.\n\n**Lilskrtskrt.eth** is active in reentry advocacy in Alaska;\n\na. serving as a Steering Team member for the [Anchorage Reentry Coalition](https://https://www.anchoragereentry.org).\nGet-By listed here: https://www.anchoragereentry.org/who-we-are.\n\nb. volunteering as a L.I.O.N member with the [Learning Inside Out Network](https://https://lion.open.uaf.edu), engaging with incarcerated and formerly incarcerated Alaskans to collect stories and spread empathy and understanding through literacy and increasing educational opportunities.\n\nc. volunteering as a member of the ACLU of [Alaska Prison Reform Action Network](https://https://www.acluak.org/en/take-action/aclu-alaska-action-network) advocating for criminal justice and corrections reform, pursuing just equitable and humane treatment of offenders before, during, and after their experiences with the system.\n\n**Lilskrtskrt#5446** will be involved in every phase of the proposal.\n\nSponsors & Milestone Checkers:\n* CHEFFO ⌐◧-◧ #2859\n* Andrewladdusaw#8362\n* Al409#8596\n\n### Socials\nTwitter: @dimitriosak\nDiscord: Lilskrtskrt#5446\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimitrios-alexiadis-92a01944\nGet-By LinkedIn: http://www.linkedin.com/company/81303788/\nGet-By Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100082942581817\nGet-By Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/getby.work/\n\n### Budget\n\nFunding Channel: Lil Nouns Onchain Proposal\n\n**a. Job Fair & Merch Expenses:**\n\n3.5 ETH ($4,000) + ($1,200)tax30% = \n**($5,200) or 4.33ETH for Job Fair & Merch**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ektq7WJ.png)\n\nExample of Cobranded T-shirts:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vsvDON5.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HajEXIf.png)\n\n**b. Launch Expenses:**\n\nAvg. Annual Non-Tax Business Expenses with 10 Employees: \n3ETH (Workers Comp)\n2ETH (Liability Insurance) \n3ETH (Background Check Costs) \n\n8 ETH ($10,136) + ($2,880)tax30% =\n**($13,016) or 10.27 ETH for Launch Expenses**\n\n**Total Prop Ask:**\n\n**13.9 ETH or $17,611 to Lilskrtskrt.eth**\n\n### Timeline\n\n**Prop 1: Launch Get-By, 2+ IRL Activation Events at AK Job Fairs**\n\nPhase 1: Prop Approved, ETH sent to wallet\n\nPhase 2: Merch and Job Fair Prep, (Offer POAP at the Job Fair?) + 30 days. \n\nPhase 3: Job Fair Participation and OTG IRL Nouns Activation (Scope out best Job Fair) + 30 days\n\nPhase 4: Incentivize job seekers (& general job fair attendants) to post using a (hashtag), have a prize drawing\n* give out merch at job fair booth\n* run a contest or game at booth for noggles (photo booth area)\n\nPhase 5: Onboard cohort of (10) Get-By workers before Jan 30.\n\nPhase 6: Lilskrtskrt.eth will compile social media engagement over the course of a 3 month period and curate a video that shows nouners, lil nouners, and Get-By workers wearing the new merch and spreading awareness around both nounsDAO and Get-By. This may also include Get-By workers working shifts with Client Businesses while wearing this nifty new merch.\n\n***While Lilskrtskrt continues his work in advocacy and launching Get-By he will meet many people involved in the small business ecosystem, the reentry services ecosystem, and the venture capital ecosystem. There are opportunities to discuss the Nouns ecosystem and the democratization of community funded projects along the way, this has already begun.***\n\nPhase 7: Video and content will be sharable no longer than 1 month after the end of the Internship Program.\n* This video and all engagement will be CCO. \n\nPhase 8: Apply for follow on funding. \n\n### Next Steps\n* **Lilskrtskrt.eth uses raised capital to raise awareness and launch Get-By.**\nQ1 2023 Get-By intends to recruit it’s first cohort of shift workers, no less than 10. These workers will have the option to commit to different shifts listed on the platform.\n\n* **If opportunities arise for Web3 “shift” or contract work, those opportunities can be listed on the Get-By platform with payout denominated primarily in USD.**\nThis could present a marketing opportunity for projects looking for work who are willing to source through the Web3/NounsDAO ecosystem, in doing so we could prove that they are employing marginalized folks which improves “DEI” efforts.\n \n* **In future rounds Get-By may return to the DAO for further support and assistance.**\nThis may vary from grant funding for Web3 shifts, to proposals requesting funding for training for workers, to additional merchandise, to developing piloting and implementing a Nouns based Web3 workforce development internship program.\n \n* **The scope for future funding requirements has not yet been determined.**\nThe total cost to operate the business for a year while employing 10 workers (including payroll taxes) is no less than $30,000 (~23.8ETH)\n \n* **Potential future revenue streams** for the project may include integrating Lil Nouns or other Nounish subDAO tokens as incentives for shift workers, boosting proliferation, onboarding, and participation and involving a marginalized group of Americans who are often unheard from. There will be opportunities to receive certifications based on skill development such as the Nounishdojo, if integrated, these certifications could drive revenue back to the DAO and provide a training mechanism for underskilled potential workers to upskill to provide more value to the DAO, and Web3 as a whole. \n\n* **For future proposals:** there may be future potential to create a subDAO around community driven proposals and participation that boost the stories of the formerly incarcerated and work to direct proposals in ways that are mutually beneficial for this group of potential community members.

      "title": "Lil Nouns Weekly Newsletter | Winter Proposal (Dec-Feb)",
      "content": "## Description\n\nTLDR: I have been writing the [Lil Nouns Weekly Newsletter](https://lilnouns.substack.com/) as a public good for the community for 25 weeks. \n\nI am requesting to continue writing the Weekly Newsletter at a 20% lower rate, for the next 3 months (Dec, Jan, Feb) — for a total of 10.4 ETH.\n\nPrevious Prop ([Proposal 66](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/66)) passed with 1030 For, 0 Against, 9 Abstained.\n\n•••\n\nThe purpose of the newsletter is to curate, synthesize, summarize, and educate people—both internal and external to the Lil Nouns DAO—on all things (Lil) Nounish happening in our community each week. We share stories of builders, props, and conversations across the Lil Nouniverse, so that readers don’t miss each week’s biggest events.\n\nThe Newsletter has shipped every Sunday for the past 25 weeks.\n\nHere is what we’ve achieved since launch:\n\n- 233 subscribers (screenshot below)\n- 54% average open rate (average)\n- 4,000+ page views to the Newsletter\n- 342 Twitter followers (https://twitter.com/lilnounsnews)\n\n![Substack Subscribers Count screenshot](https://share.getcloudapp.com/bLuOjjgm)\n(https://share.getcloudapp.com/bLuOjjgm)\n\nI believe the public good will increase in value, as more members are on-boarded into the community (curation and synthesis will become critical as we scale, as well as ensuring the highest number of Lils are showing up to vote on Props on chain and on Prop.House).\n\nI also plan to leverage the Weekly Newsletter within Content Pod. There can be a lot of noise in Discord, and relying on Twitter means we’re relying on an algorithm we can’t control — having direct access to inboxes once/week is super important to make sure we are staying top-of-mind within the Lil Nouns community.\n\n## Scope\n\n\"One Newsletter, Every Sunday, Forever\"\n\nIt is basically the same scope as last time ([Prop 66](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/66)). The only minor changes are: 1) I plan to put more emphasis on Twitter threads and 2) I plan to work more closely with content pod. But otherwise, the scope remains the same as it's always been:\n\n- Curate information happening in Nouns DAO\n- Keep our community up to date with Lil Nouns DAO activities/initiatives\n- Ensure high engagement on Proposals and other votes\n- Synthesize important information across the ecosystem\n- Recap past events, and make community members aware of upcoming events\n- Proliferate the Noun meme to members outside of the DAO\n\n## Past Discussion in #Proposal-Ideas\n\n- https://discord.com/channels/954142017556979752/1017498216167637053\n\n## Funds Requested\nSince we are in a bear market, and thanks to the example of Lil Al and others who have roles that require recurring pay, I am choosing to decrease my ask. Previously, the DAO paid 1 ETH per episode. I am decreasing my ask by 20%, down to .8 ETH per episode.\n\n- Total: 10.4 ETH (.8 ETH/episode x 13 weeks)\n- Period: December 2022 (4 Sundays) + January 2023 (5 Sundays) + February 2023 (4 Sundays)\n\n## Proposed Transaction\n1. 0x35c3885d43e0c98cffc99257d200272b9505b73a.transfer(\n        10.4 ETH\n    )",

      "content": "## TL;DR \n[Brook](https://twitter.com/0x1092) is seeking 13.75 ETH — 4 ETH of funding for a period of 3 months to cover the costs of conducting brainstorming/office hour sessions, producing podcast episodes, and Content Pod's operations, and an additional 1.75 ETH as retroactive funding for podcast episodes 5-10.\n\n## Introduction\n\nI’m Brook, a [podcast host](https://pod.link/1638702547), active [Lil Nouns contributor](https://prop.house/lil-golden-globes-awards/most-active-in-governance-(prize:-0.1-eth)), founding member of [Lil Representatives](https://twitter.com/LilReps_), and active [DAO-to-DAO governance participant](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/25).\n\nParticipatory media – brainstorming, podcasts, and content – can help to engage and involve the community in the decision-making process and its overall direction. I have been fortunate enough to contribute as much as I can in that regard, and would like to continue to do so.\n\n## Scope\n### Brainstorm Tuesdays\n\nI have been hosting weekly brainstorming calls, which have been used to gather ideas, set requirements, and drive action that will help improve the DAO. These sessions, which have been called \"Brainstorm Tuesdays,\" may be changed in the future to \"Office Hours\" to discuss ideas to propose at Nouns. \n\n### Meet the Lil Nouners Podcast\n\nThe podcast features a new episode each week, in which I invite guests to join me in a conversation about a variety of topics related to Web3.\n\nThe process of creating each episode involves several steps. First, I invite guests to participate in the podcast and schedule a time for recording. Next, I record the episode using appropriate audio equipment and software. After the recording is complete, I edit the episode to remove any filler words or repetitive phrases, and to adjust the audio quality for maximum clarity and ease of listening.\n\nOnce the episode is edited, I create video snippets of the most interesting or informative moments, and add sound engineering to enhance the overall audio quality. I then assemble the various tracks and add music, and include show transcripts for those who prefer to read rather than listen. Finally, I distribute the podcast to various players via Simplecast, so that it can be easily accessed by the everyone.\n\nI am committed to creating high-quality content for the *Meet the Lil Nouners* podcast, and to providing a platform for experts and thought leaders to share their insights and experiences with the community. I believe that this podcast has the potential to be a valuable resource for those interested in Lil Nouns, the Nouniverse, and Web3, and to contribute to the ongoing development and growth of the community.\n\n### Content Pod Operations\n\nI collaborated with @motiondesign.eth to pilot Content Pod. Some of my work entailed reaching out to creatives to call for their participation, building and maintaining Content Pod's website, leading operations, and communicating and coordinating with builders to scope work.\n\nSince then, Content Pod has been restructured, and my work in leading its operations will continue.\n\n## Positive Externalities\n\nBy hosting regular brainstorming sessions, a DAO can tap into the collective knowledge and creativity of the community, and generate a wide range of ideas and concepts that can be evaluated and refined. This can help to ensure that the DAO is responsive to the needs and interests of the community, and can help to drive innovation and progress within the organization.\n\nPodcasts can also be a valuable tool for engaging and involving the community. By hosting regular podcast episodes, a DAO can provide a platform for experts and thought leaders to share their perspectives and experiences, and offer valuable insights and information to the community. This can help to foster a sense of connection and collaboration within the community.\n\n## The Ask\n\n- **Total - 13.75 ETH**\n    - 1.75 ETH to be sent as retroactive funding of podcast episodes 5-10. \n        - Please note that with due consideration of current market conditions, this funding request has been reduced from 3 ETH (initial funding by Lil Funding).\n    - 12.00 ETH paid over 3 months (Dec 18, 2022 through March 15, 2023) which equates to 4 ETH/month.\n    - The logic behind this strange date range is because it comes out to exactly 7500000 seconds which makes the payment amount in wei divided by the duration of the stream in seconds a whole number. This is a technical requirement of a Sablier stream to work.",

From site improvements to Lil Nouns' very own [metagovernance frontend](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/nounsdao), that the community uses to cast its 8 votes into Nouns DAO.\n\nAs before, the scope of the work entails maintenance and further development of products existing and prospective lil nouners interface with; lilnouns.wtf, lil nouns discord (custom bots), public sdks and libraries, and anything else deemed appropriate by the community. Deliverables and timelines are to be defined on an on-going basis and communicated publicly every month.\n\n### Ask\n- 36 eth paid over 6 months (Dec 19, 2022 through June 10, 2023) which equates to 6E/month. \nThe logic behind this strange date range is because it comes out to exactly 15000000 seconds which makes the payment amount in wei divided by the duration of the stream in seconds a whole number. This is a technical requirement of a sablier stream to work.\n- 7 eth retro for engineering work during the months of October and November.()\n\nThis retro was initially marked to be 6 eth per month through lil funding's contributor stipend programme but was deferred by dot to make sure it doesn't reduce lil funding's ability to fund other builders and proliferators.() ",

With due consideration to current market conditions, I have decided to request 45 ETH over the same exact stream time (December 22 2022 through June 13 2023) The logic behind this strange date range is because it comes out to exactly 15000000 seconds which makes the payment amount in wei divided by the duration of the stream in seconds a whole number. This is a technical requirement of a sablier stream to work. \n\nI have decided to cancel my previous prop and ask for a lower amount because I think we have some really talented/committed members of the DAO who are not getting enough recognition/compensation for their work. I couldn't be here without the support and hard work of the community around me, and I think this gives more room to compensate some of our dedicated resources who deserve it the most. Thank you for all the support in my time here.",

This will be a process of finding 1-2 illustrators to help with the “chalkboard” content.\n- Potential music collaboration with Lil Nouns musicians for the background music.\n\n**What is Content Pod**\n- Content Pod is a working working group in the LilNounsDAO community that surfaces needs from the DAO. \n\n**How Content Pod relates to this proposal?**\n- We plan to reserve work tasks from this proposal for bounties to be filled through content-Pod.\n\nWe believe that including content pod in our proposal fosters community collaboration while providing a tangible concept for building better proposals.

      "content": "**Description**\n\nThe Twitter Impact Program is a proposal to customize a tool for the Lil Nouns ecosystem that has already been created + battle tested by a number of communities including DeadHeads, Moonrunners, Okay Bears, and more.\n\n[Click Here To See Example Campaign/Leaderboard](https://nftimpact.ai/s/moonrunnersnft) - this will be custom built for Lil Nouns\n\nThe Twitter Impact Program amplifies community involvement on crypto-twitter and ranks users making the biggest impact. Distribute fun rewards to top performers while maximizing brand awareness.\n\n![Supercharge Your Twitter](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1034968491977097236/1039397132999852093/NFT_Impact.PNG)\n\n**TLDR**\n\nThis proposal is to run a trial, month long Twitter Impact Program from December 1st, 2022 to December 31st, 2022. The Twitter Impact Program rewards Twitter users for creating content that increases Lil Noun Brand Awareness in an organic way.\n\n**Benefits**\n\n- Increase Engagement On Twitter\n- Grow Brand Awareness Organically\n- Gamify Crypto-Twitter\n- Reward the Lil Nouns Community\n- Encourage Your Biggest Supporters To Be Loud About Lil Nouns\n\n**What does the tool measure?**\n\nTwitter engagement! Our proposal is to create, and manage, a month long campaign for the Lil Nouns community - **this campaign will start December 1st, 2022 and run through December 31st, 2022**. This campaign will rank twitter account activity relative to filters set by our team (usually done via tracking mentions and/or hashtags).\n\nWe have an internal algorithm aimed at rewarding authentic content (not spam).\n\nThis pushes the community to create thoughtful content to spread the word about Lil Nouns. \n\n**The Goal is to influence High Value content creation - and reward it!**\n\nAs the Lil Nouns community creates content they will also learn that thoughtful tweets naturally create more engagement compared to spam (ex. Threads, High Quality Videos, Etc.)\n\n**Leaderboard**\n\n![Twitter Impact Leaderboard Example](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1034968491977097236/1034968494955049020/DeadHeads_Impact.png)\n\nThe leaderboard is where participants can see their current ranking during the current campaign. \n\nThe leaderboard also outlines all relevant campaign information:\n- Description\n- Start/End Dates\n- Rewards!\n- Filters we look for on Twitter\n\nYou do not have to own a Lil Nouns NFT to participate - this encourages new members to become some of the biggest supporters.\n\n**How do we know if it's working**\n\nSince posts will be made from individual Twitter accounts there is not a single way to keep track of engagement and brand awareness. The Leaderboard is an excellent way to track account activity of multiple users, but it has limitations - as any marketing method does.\n\nA metric trackable from the main [@lilnounsdao](https://twitter.com/lilnounsdao) that is most telling will be **mentions**\n\nFor example, the DeadHeads Team ran a campaign with the following results -\n\n**5,669 mentions during the Twitter Impact Program**\n![June 2022 Summary](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1034968491977097236/1035329656955605092/unknown.png)\n\n**4,549 mentions after the Twitter Impact Program**\n![July 2022 Summary](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1034968491977097236/1035329849864224890/unknown.png)\n\nActual numbers from the Lil Nouns campaign will be different, and data will be presented after the initial campaign to support future Twitter Impact campaigns.\n\n**Rewards**\n\nReward the Lil Nouns community and create friendly competition. Use rewards from within our own ecosystem, or add in rewards from other communities to cross pollinate awareness. \n\nTo begin, this proposal will reward the community with Lil Noun NFTS. In the future there will be opportunities to include a number of other rewards!\n\n**Funding Model**\n\n**Participant Rewards: 1 ETH**\n\n1st Place: 3 Lil Nouns\n2nd Place: 2 Lil Nouns\n3rd Place: 1 Lil Noun\n4th Place: 1 Lil Noun\n5th Place: 1 Lil Noun\n\n**Team Compensation: 3 ETH**\n\n- Onboarding + Setup\n- Initial One Month Campaign Management\n- Upkeep, Awareness, Content Ideas, and Best Practices\n- Community Engagement\n- White Glove Support\n\n**Total**\n- **4 ETH**\n\n**Conclusion and Future Outlook**\n\nThink of this as an initial trial run to determine engagement and brand awareness increases. Future campaigns will have separate proposals based upon lessons learned during the first rollout.",

Exercising these voting rights require a centralized party to act on behalf of the community through sentiment gathered off-chain on Snapshot.\n\nAlthough this served as a great short term solution for handling cross-DAO governance, it has become evident that this is core ecosystem behavior that should be permissionless, decentralized, and freely available.\n\n\n**About:**\n\nFederation is a protocol that enables communities in the Nouns ecosystem to vote on each other's proposals.\n\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n- Deployment of Federation delegate contract with configurable quorum\n- On-boarding the community to Federation\n- Priority customer and technical support / handling feature requests from the community and further development of the roadmap\n- Highlighting Lil Nouns as a supporter of Federation on the web app and code repo\n\n\n**Screenshots:**\n\n![explore](https://cldup.com/rCg5oQVFft.png)\n\n![feed](https://cldup.com/EMTrrKtgu8.png)\n\n\n**On-boarding details:**\n\nTo get started using Federation our communities’ voting rights in NounsDAO must be delegated to a new Federation contract, which will be deployed after this prop is approved. In addition, ENS addresses used in cross-DAO voting should be updated to point to this delegate.\n\n\n**Note:**\n\nUsing Federation does not come with any risk of asset loss. The contract behaves as an on-chain delegated voter and cannot execute any arbitrary transactions. Federation can only cast votes against other DAO proposals.\n\n\n**Transaction details:**\n\n12 ETH to be transferred to **wiznav.eth**\n\n\n[wiz](https://twitter.com/0xWiz_) 🪄\n",

Having met in March 2022, we bonded over a shared love of community building and communication, which led to us forming a regular Twitter spaces show for @3LandersNFT.\n\nInitially starting as a community spaces before gaining traction, we were asked to run the official 3Landers show by the founders. From the months of March - July '22, we have grown a twitter account with no promotion, other than from our own personal twitter accounts. In this short period we have grown a loyal listening base and have regularly attracted over 1000 listeners (live and recorded) with guests such as\n\n1. @Zeneca_33;\n2. Jxnet, the founder of Ghxsts;\n3. @ChimpersNFT;\n4. @Alienfrens; and\n5. @Cyberkongz, to name just a few.\n\nWhilst carrying out our spaces for 3Landers, a mutual friend of ours, Lil Pizza, suggested we get involved with Lil Nouns due to our values aligning and him finding a community of like minded thinkers, builders and educators. We did, and what we found was exactly that!\n\n## Our vision\n\nEveryone within the NFT space is curious about the Nouns ecosystem, but there is a barrier to entry…price. Or so they think. They just don’t know about Lil Nouns…\n\nWe not only want to create a space that keeps our existing community informed, we also want to bring in new voices (and ears) from all corners of the NFT world. The scope of opportunity with Lil Nouns is vast and the more ideas and diversity of opinion that we’re able to attract into the community, the faster and more effectively we will be able to proliferate Lil Nouns. There is one Lil Noun minted every 15 minutes and we believe it should be our ambition for that minter to be a first-time Lil Nouner each time. That isn’t going to happen unless we start shouting about what we’re building here.\n\nThe recent attention on IP rights and specifically CC0 needs to be capitalised on by this community. We are the pioneers of this approach to brand building, not only in web3, but in the world. Let’s shout about that.\n\n## ‘The Lil Nouns Show’ format\n\nWe currently run a 2/3 / 1/3 structure on our shows. We like to invite a guest from outside of the community (another community/individual) who we think would provide value to the Lil Nouns audience but also allow us to profile Lil Nouns to them. This section of the show usually takes up 2/3 of our show time. \n\nTo date, we have hosted the following external guests:\n\n- [**Henry the Grape**](https://twitter.com/HenryTheGrape) - CyberKongz Community Manager\n- [**mfers**](https://twitter.com/unofficialmfers) - Community Managers and community\n- [**Gian the Rios**](https://twitter.com/GianTheRios) - Web3 Biz Dev & Marketing Director for SwapBox\n- [**Zeneca**](https://twitter.com/Zeneca_33) - Founder and CEO of Zen Academy and The 333 Club (booked as a guest for Ep. 4 on Halloween)\n\nThe last 1/3 is reserved for us, our community. It allows us to platform those Lil Nouners who are building in the community and want to come up and tell people all about it. \n\nTo date, we have hosted the following community guests:\n\n- [**Lil Al**](https://twitter.com/7x7x7eth)\n- [**Little Block Party**](https://twitter.com/lilblockparty)\n- [**Lil Pizza**](https://twitter.com/lilpizza_eth)\n- [**Motion design**](https://twitter.com/motiondesigneth) from Content Pod\n- [**SQ**](https://twitter.com/ijustasquirrel) from [**Lil Prophouse**](https://twitter.com/LilPropHouse)\n\nFinally, we also have a slot at the tail end of the show for Lil PropHouse spaces host, SQ. This allows him to give our audience a round up of the current state of Round X of Prop House and provides both spaces shows with excellent value.\n\n## ‘The Lil Nouns Show’ team\n\n**Team Bios**\n\n- **April -** I’m April, a web3 enthusiast who has been exploring the NFT space for over a year now, yet to my detriment I only properly dove into the Nouns eco-system a couple of months ago. Since then I have become obsessed with how this dream of an open-source brand can succeed. Outside of this world my background is in PR & communications (in-house & agency side) having worked for many years in Amsterdam and London, before following my other passion (skiing) and moving to the other side of the world. When I’m not chatting about Nouns, you’ll find me hanging with Moonbirds & Creatures.\n- **Cardno** - I entered the space at the back end of 2021, around Christmas time. I initially became aware of NFTs through the visibility on twitter of BAYC (of course) and after falling into the ‘Fast Food Punks’ discord, (strange, I know) I found myself on a call with the founder within 10 minutes and being given an NFT 101 chat from him. **I was onboarded**. Since then, I have been a moderator of various projects such as 3Landers, Chimpers and Lorem. I have also been the host of the official 3Landers twitter spaces show. I am currently a moderator for Chimpers and an active community member in Lil Nouns.\n- **Crxsher -** I entered the space in February 2021, first in crypto, then in NFTs on Harmony, and finally in Ethereum in April.  My first purchase was a piece of Sandbox land, which I then traded for two BAYC Apes, and the rest is history.  I’ve had a few successes, made many mistakes, but what has never wavered is my belief that Web3 constitutes a major shift in how the world will interact in the future.  I’m a frequent guest on many Twitter spaces in addition to co-hosting the 3Landers spaces, hoping to share, engage, learn and grow as we move forward in NFTs.  I’m most active these days in BAYC, Ghxsts, Chimpers, Zen Academy and Lil Nouns, although you’ll find me engaging in several others as well.\n- **English -** I entered this space as a research consultant for a friend whom was looking to leverage their musical IP assets in web 3. Upon my research I engaged with multiple communities and ended up moderating for 3landers and Lorem. I am currently working with a web2 gaming company looking to launch their first nft project.\n\n**Social media handles:**\n\n- **Twitter: [@april_xyz_](https://twitter.com/april_xyz_) Discord:** april || pinklobster.eth#5026\n- **Twitter: [@CardnoNFT](https://twitter.com/CardnoNFT) Discord:** Cardno#0446\n- **Twitter: [@CryptoCrusher6](https://twitter.com/CryptoCrusher6) Discord:** Crxsher#3174\n- **Twitter: [@EnglishNFTea](https://twitter.com/EnglishNFTea) Discord:** English#0943\n\n## Compensation Model\n\n- **Contest rewards, art & miscellaneous expenses:**\n    - **0.5 ETH** per month\n- **Team reward + operations (see budget below):**\n    - **0.25 ETH** per host, per episode.\n    - 12 episodes running until 30 January 2023 (the episode due on 26 December 2022 won’t take place due to Christmas commitments).\n\n## Total\n\n- **13.5 ETH**\n\n## Summary\n\nWe believe that over the last month, we have shown that we can provide real value to the Lil Nouns ecosystem by way of exposure. An issue that comes up almost daily in the Lil Nouns discord is how to onboard newcomers to the project and in-turn boost the treasury, and this show, we believe, is the top of that funnel. We believe that we have proven that one of the ways this can be achieved is by holding regular Twitter shows aimed at onboarding and attracting newcomers to the project whilst at the same time, balancing this with providing a show that those already part of the Lil Nouns project can enjoy.\n\nIf anyone has any questions regarding this proposal, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with one of us via the discord handles above.",

      "content": "# Description\n\n\n**TLDR**: Lil Saturn and Corgie have been writing the Lil Nouns Weekly Newsletter as a public good for the community for the last 14 weeks. Corgie has decided to transition out of writing the Newsletter, but Lil Saturn (hello, that’s me! 👋) will continue to ship it every Sunday.\n\nThird-time’s a charm!\n\nFirst, we attempted to go on chain with a Proposal ([Prop 48](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/48)) last week, and had a unanimous “For” (except for one voter), but we did not hit Quorum.\n\nThen, I went back on chain for attempt #2 and the Prop passed ([Prop 58](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/58))! BUT (big lesson learned) the Sablier Stream that was part of the contract, had a payment in the past, so the Prop could not be Executed :( (Sablier Stream has updated their docs and v.2 will not break contracts in this way).\n\nSo, I’m back for a third time, the only thing different: because it’s now been three more weeks, there are three more weeks of retro-funding included here, and then 6 weeks after that.\n\n\n**I am requesting retro-funding for the weeks I have shipped and not been paid (7 weeks), plus 6 weeks into the future — 13 weeks/“episodes” total.**\n\n# Summary\n\nThe purpose of the newsletter is to curate, synthesize, summarize, and educate people—both internal and external to the Lil Nouns DAO—on all things (Lil) Nounish happening in our community each week. We share stories of builders, props, and conversations across the Lil Nouniverse, so that readers don’t miss each week’s biggest events.\n\nWe have shipped the weekly newsletter every Sunday for the past 14 weeks (feels like it’s been 3 years, not 3 months! ha! Time in web3 is wild!).\n\n**Here is what we’ve achieved since launch:**\n\n- 209 subscribers (screenshot below)\n- 68% open rate (average over time)\n- 3,741 page views to the Newsletter (views are increasing week over week)\n- 282 Twitter followers ([https://twitter.com/lilnounsnews](https://twitter.com/lilnounsnews))\n\n![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ud9n2ur4d6zzs5m/lilNounsNewletterUpdated.png?dl=1)\n\nI believe the public good will increase in value, as more members are on-boarded into the community (curation and synthesis will become critical as we scale, as well as ensuring the highest number of Lils are showing up to vote on Props on chain and on Prop.House).\n\nI also believe that the Content Pod can benefit from leveraging the Weekly Newsletter. There can be a lot of noise in Discord, and relying on Twitter means we’re relying on an algorithm we can’t control — having direct access to inboxes once/week is super important to make sure we are staying top-of-mind within the Lil Nouns community.\n\n# Scope (same as the last 16 weeks)\n-   Curate information happening in Nouns DAO\n- Keep our community up to date with Lil Nouns DAO activities/initiatives\n- Ensure high engagement on Proposals and other votes\n- Synthesize important information across the ecosystem\n- Recap past events, and make community members aware of upcoming events\n- Proliferate the Noun meme to members outside of the DAO\n\n# Past Discussion in #Proposal-Ideas\n- https://discord.com/channels/954142017556979752/1017498216167637053\n\n# Funds Requested\n-   Total: 13 ETH (7 ETH for retro, 6 ETH streamed continuously going forward)\n-   Retro: 4 ETH for September (1 ETH per post - 4 Sundays in Sept.) + 3 ETH for October (1 ETH per post - first 3 Sundays in Oct.)\n-   Looking forward: 2 ETH for October (the last two Sundays of October, which are in the future) + 4 ETH for November (1 ETH per post - 4 Sundays in Nov.)",

      "content": "# [lilsandbox.wtf](http://lilsandbox.wtf)\n---\n# Why Build a Lil VRGDA Sandbox?\n\n1. To test out an innovative VRGDA minting mechanism for lil nouns\n2. So buyers can purchase lils in one step\n3. To fix the burn issue which threatens quorum\n4. To develop a more engaging [lilblockparty.wtf](http://lilblockparty.wtf) style sniping process into the primary minting mechanic\n5. We want to do this on testnet so people can demo and give feedback, and to separate voting for the development from comitting to it on mainnet\n\n\n*this proposal is inspired by [lilnouns idea 82](https://lilnouns.wtf/ideas/82)*\n\n# **WTF is VRGDA?**\n\n**V**ariable **R**ate **G**radual **D**utch **A**uction. This mechanism let Lil Nouns sell tokens close to a custom schedule over time by raising prices when sales are ahead of schedule and lowering prices when sales are behind schedule. [[Paradigm explainer](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/08/vrgda)]\n\n# Spec & Design goals\n\n- One step flow - Purchase, mint, and settle in a single transaction\n- Dynamic pricing based on linear VRGDA rules to allow for more revenue capture and eliminate burned lils\n- Gamification: Lil Block Party style trait generation - The traits of the noun for sale change each block, so users must act quickly to purchase the noun, or it will expire and the transaction will revert\n\n# Deliverables\n\n1. Deploy Solidity architecture on goerli or polygon (*TBD based on community feedback*)\n    1.1 **Develop a VRGDA auction contract** based on the Paradigm implementation, but tailored to the Lil Nouns ecosystem\n    1.2 Deploy a clone of the Lil Noun smart contracts that use the new VRGDA contract instead of the current English auction mechanic\n2. **Fork the lilnouns.wtf front-end** to upgrade UI to support new VRGDA mechanism for this goerli deploy.\n    2.1. Will be deployed at [www.lilsandbox.wtf](https://lilsandbox.wtf)\n    2.2 All code will be open-source and forkable on our github\n3. A dune dashboard to visualize data about the VRGDA mechanism\n\n### VRGDA contract\n\nThe core VRGDA logic will use Paradigm's [code](https://github.com/transmissions11/VRGDAs), but we will implement purchase/mint logic as well as some auxiliary read only functions useful to the frontend for fetching price and trait information.\n\n### High Level Flow\n\n1. New block is finalized\n2. Frontend fetches auction price and svg of the noun for sale from VRGDA contract\n3. User calls mint on the VRGDA auction contract specifying the blockhash corresponding to their desired noun\n4. VRGDA auction contract checks the blockhash is not expired and immediately reverts and refunds the user if so\n5. The auction contract validates the purchase request against the VRGDA rules\n6. Auction contract calls mint on the token contract\n7. Auction contract sends token to user\n8. Auction contract sends the funds to the DAO\n\n*The contract design may evolve based on community feedback if we encounter unexplored edge cases and other considerations.*\n\n---\n\n---\n\n# Team\n\n**TEAM**\n\n1.

      "title": "Lil Funding Refill",
      "content": "TLDR: Replicate Nouns DAOs process in allocating fast capital to DAO contributors via small/retroactive grants. - Refunding same wallet with 50 ETH, and compensating [brianj](https://twitter.com/pbrianandj) 3 ETH for the custom instance of [AddressBoard](https://www.addressform.io/board/689ad3b5-7a88-4ad0-8ba0-4d57703d7636)\n\n## Intro\nThe on-chain proposal process is not ideal for encouraging small, one-off, or alpha versions of projects/tooling. Eager creators shouldn’t have to wait days for an on-chain proposal to be passed to receive a small amount of ETH. The DAO should not have to submit a formal proposal each time it wants to quickly reward valuable contributors.\n\n## Lil Funding Pool\nWe propose establishing a pool of funds and Lil Nouns NFTs to encourage creators, devs, artists, and contributors to build with Lil Nouns. This pool of capital and NFTs, will be sent to a Gnosis Safe controlled by a small group of Lil Nouners and Lil Nouns DAO.\n\nProposed budget: 53 ETH\n- 50 ETH to the Lil Funding Multisig\n- 3 ETH to brianj for custom implementation/support of addressboard.\n\n\n## The aim of the pool will be to:\n\nAcknowledge past contributions to Lil Nouns through retroactive funding\nGrant funds for the development of small, one-off, or alpha version projects\nReward ongoing contributors to Lil Nouns\nSignal that retroactive funding is a viable path to build on Lil Nouns\nReturn Lil Nounder ownership back to to the community.\nAs part of this proposal design, the Lil Nounders expressed a desire to return a substantive portion of their ownership back to the community. To action this desire, they’ve recommended that every 90th Lil Noun will be sent to the Lil Grants safe to be given to community members. \n\n## Funding Committee\nThe Lil Funding Committee will monitor the builder community, retroactively fund previous work as it comes up, and receive informal requests/applications for small project grants. The projects and amounts will be at the committee's discretion.\n\nThe committee’s gnosis safe will require 2 of 5 Lil Nouners to sign, with Lil Nouns DAO acting as a largely symbolic owner and backup. We recommend keeping the signer group small with a team of experienced signers and then add more as we scale up operations and size of the pool.\n\nThe signers on the Safe are:\n\nLil Noun 482 [lil world](https://twitter.com/blequitydao?s=21&t=4kcOclyQ3vWWyCfsl39odg)\nLil Noun 129 [lil john](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer)\nLil Noun 317 [bflynn](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm)\nLil Nounder Dot [Dot](https://twitter.com/0xSVG)\nLil Noun 449 [lil al409](https://twitter.com/7x7x7eth)\nLil Noun 1579 [Baba ⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/_babaBlake)\nLil Noun 292 [Lil BK](https://twitter.com/bkraaus)\nmrtn#7388\n\nThe committee is open for any Lil Nouners to submit suggestions for grants and contributors that they see as deserving of a reward.\n\n## Submitting Requests\nWe have officially transitioned from using discourse posts to submit applications, to now using addressboard. Brianj and al409 submitted a [Prop House proposal](https://prop.house/lil-nouns/round-6/1211) to gauge interest and request partial funding to build out addressboard to support our lil funding program and we will be using it for all applications going forward. \n\nTLDR on Addressboard Functionality\n\n- Apply for funding through a simple form with your on-chain identity\n- Easily browse all recent funding requests\n- Up / downvotes requests with your lil nouns vote weight\n- Discuss proposals with your on-chain identity\n- Transparently track which props get funded (and for how much), and which ones didn't\n- Easily see how much money is left in the lil funding treasury\n\nDetails\n- After each application, a prop has 4 days to get votes after which it's marked as ended (this value is adjustable based on community feedback)\n- These votes are a signal to the lil funding committee about what the community finds valuable\n- Funded proposals are then moved to the funded category by the lil funding team",

      "title": "LilNouns as a Presenting Sponsor a SweepTank Episode",
      "content": "Proposed Idea: \n\nThe idea is to have Lil Nouns be a presenting sponsor of a SweepTank Episode which is hosted on Twitter Spaces once a week by the Sweeper’s project.\n\nHaving LilNouns be the presenting sponsor of a SweepTank Episode would bring massive opportunity to tell the Lil Nouns story, why Lil Nouns is doing something special and bring new potential investors into the LilNouns community.\n\nEach presenting sponsor is given a ten minute spotlight presentation. This is where the LilNouns community would select one representative to speak on behalf of the Lil Nouns project and tell the story, concept and vision of Lil Nouns.\n\nSweepTank is a part of the Sweepers NFT project. Every week a new episode of SweepTank takes place on Thursday’s. This is a space where all community members of Sweepers culminate along with other project developers (up to ten projects) and their community members (could be hundreds of listeners). In the SweepTank there are four industry experts and advisors. These are usually influential members of the NFT space. These advisors will start the show by featuring the presenting sponsor which does not participate in the Tank part of the show but is given a Spotlight on their project to be able tell the world why what they are doing is unique, special and important. \n\nAfter the Spotlight presentation then the show moves to the Tank rounds where each project that has been selected to participate is given five minutes to pitch their project to the advisors.\n\nAfter each project pitches their project to the advisors the advisors will now have the chance to ask questions of the project developers. After all projects have pitched and completed the Tank rounds then the advisors will announce which projects have made it to the next round where they are included after the episode in a proposal to the Sweepers community for consideration to be swept. Once the community vote is complete on the proposal one project will have been voted to be swept.\n\nAs a presenting sponsor Lil Nouns will get the following Benefits:\n\n- Ten Minute Sponsor Spotlight\n\n- Opportunity to include a member of Lil Nouns to be added as a guest advisor for the space (optional)\n\n- Opportunity to also be included as a project accepted into the tank (optional). Participate in the Tank Round with the other projects as well and considered to be swept. Again this is optional and Lil Nouns can simply opt to only do the Sponsor Spotlight.\n\n- Co-Branding on all social channels with Lil Nouns and the Sweepers Project with announcements, teasers, etc regarding the upcoming space.\n\n- Massive Brand Awareness to multiple communities around the NFT Space who may never know about the Lil Nouns project.\n\n- Indirect benefit from the marketing dollars spent on marketing the space on Twitter prior to the scheduled date.\n\nCost = 1 ETH\n\nBelow is information on the Sweepers Project and how it works:\nWhat are Sweepers?\n\nStake a Sweeper in the GARAGE and Earn $DUST token. Bid in THE VAULT (an auction based marketplace) to purchase Blue Chip NFT projects for $DUST. The goal is to stake and earn as many $DUST tokens as possible to have buying power in THE VAULT. Each NFT auction will start at a bid of one $DUST token.\n \nSweepers are a generative 32x32 non-fungible token project on the Ethereum (ERC-721) blockchain. A Sweeper is generated on chain every 10-minutes and is auctioned off to the highest bidder.\n\nSweepers Auctions \n\nOne Sweepers is auctioned every 10 minutes, forever. One interface for participating in Sweepers auctions is SweepersClub.com, which is a website built and maintained by the project founders. \n\nEach Sweeper is an irrevocable member of Sweepers and entitled to one vote in all governance proposals to sweep. Sweepers can use their voting abilities (remember, 1 Sweeper = 1 vote) to direct the treasury sweeps of any proposed NFT project. They can create and vote on governance proposals, executing transactions on the Ethereum blockchain when approved.\n\nThe $DUST Token\n\n$DUST Token is the reward token earned daily by all Sweepers Members who stake their Sweeper NFT in the GARAGE. The GARAGE will be a platform on the Sweepers website, allowing members to stake their Sweeper NFT to earn Dust Token. Dust Token will have two utilities.\n\nThe first utility will allow members to collect a balance of Dust Tokens and use their earned Dust Tokens to bid on auctions in THE VAULT platform, an auction marketplace where all swept NFT assets will be listed for auction. \n\nDust Token's second utility will be to sell any balance of Dust Token in the Peer to Peer exchange called The Dust Exchange. Here Sweepers Members can offer any amount of Dust Token for Sale and accept offers made on their Dust Token. \n\nThe Dust Token will never have a liquidity pool added to it or be tradeable on an exchange. Dust Token is to be used inside of the Sweepers Project only. \n\nTHE VAULT\n\nTHE VAULT is an online auction marketplace where swept NFT assets are sent to be offered off at auction starting at one Dust Token each. All swept assets from Sweepers Member Proposals, Sweep Tank Events, and Reserve Fund sweeps get sent to THE VAULT. \n\nThe VAULT will host many different auction lengths based on the type of sweep, type of project, etc. The idea is for everyone to participate in THE VAULT Auctions regardless of the number of Sweeper NFTs each holder owns or stakes. \n\nWith $DUST Tokens, the buying power of the Sweepers Members will rotate, and the idea is that everyone will have a chance to participate in the long run. \n\nThe strategy will be everything, some will buy as soon as possible, and others will wait for the grail NFT they have wanted for a long time. \n\nThe Dust Exchange\n\nThe Dust Exchange is a place that allows Sweepers Members the ability to buy or sell their Dust Token amongst members of Sweepers. Some members will be waiting for the grail NFT they always wanted, and some will be just short of being able to win a bid and in need of a top off of more Dust Tokens.\n\nThe Dust Exchange will allow Sweepers Members to list their Dust Token for a buy-it-now price and accept offers on their chosen balance. \n\nMembers of Sweepers can choose to either Buy $DUST Tokens at the list price or make an offer to buy at a price offered on a secondary market, which allows for a healthy exchange environment for Dust Tokens.\n\nLearn More:\n\nhttps://www.sweepersclub.com/ \nhttps://Twitter.com/SweepersClub \nhttps://app.gitbook.com/o/5g7JoONG1PdvvI4LsYP9/s/92t6iUSx2j7FSYQVWU2h/sweepers/intro-to-sweepers \n",

      "title": "Lil Nouns Weekly Newsletter",
      "content": "# Description\n\n**TLDR**: Lil Saturn and Corgie have been writing the Lil Nouns Weekly Newsletter as a public good for the community for the last 14 weeks. Corgie has decided to transition out of writing the Newsletter, but Lil Saturn (hello, that’s me! 👋) will continue to ship it every Sunday. \n\nWe attempted to go on chain with a Proposal (Prop 48) last week, and had a unanimous “For” (except for one voter), but we did not hit Quorum. So, I am going back on chain for attempt #2. The Prop is the same, except that Corgie is not part of it (and that we have added 10 more subscribers since the last prop). \n\n**I am requesting funding for September (not paid yet) and October — 9 weeks/“episodes” total.**\n\n# Summary\nThe purpose of the newsletter is to curate, synthesize, summarize, and educate people—both internal and external to the Lil Nouns DAO—on all things (Lil) Nounish happening in our community each week. We share stories of builders, props, and conversations across the Lil Nouniverse, so that readers don’t miss each week’s biggest events. \n\nWe have shipped the weekly newsletter every Sunday for the past 14 weeks (feels like it’s been 3 years, not 3 months! ha! Time in web3 is wild!).\n\nHere is what we’ve achieved since launch: \n- 199 subscribers (screenshot below)\n- 68% open rate (average over time)\n- 3,741 page views to the Newsletter (views are increasing week over week) \n- 282 Twitter followers (https://twitter.com/lilnounsnews)\n\n![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q4lsq0eq30wzwg3/Newsletter.png?dl=1)\n\nI believe the public good will increase in value, as more members are on-boarded into the community (curation and synthesis will become critical as we scale, as well as ensuring the highest number of Lils are showing up to vote on Props on chain and on Prop.House).\n\nI also believe that the Content Pod can benefit from leveraging the Weekly Newsletter. There can be a lot of noise in Discord, and relying on Twitter means we’re relying on an algorithm we can’t control — having direct access to inboxes once/week is super important to make sure we are staying top-of-mind within the Lil Nouns community.  \n\n# Scope (same as the last 14 weeks)\n\n- Curate information happening in Nouns DAO\n- Keep our community up to date with Lil Nouns DAO activities/initiatives\n- Ensure high engagement on Proposals and other votes\nSynthesize important information across the ecosystem \n- Recap past events, and make community members aware of upcoming events\n- Proliferate the Noun meme to members outside of the DAO\n\n# Past Discussion in #Proposal-Ideas\n- https://discord.com/channels/954142017556979752/1017498216167637053\n\n# Funds Requested\n- Total: 9 ETH \n- 4 ETH for September (1 ETH per post - 4 Sundays in Sept.)\n- 5 ETH for October (1 ETH per post - 5 Sundays in Oct.)",

      "content": "## Summary\nWe want to create an interactive onboarding experience for newcomers to web3. Topics range from understanding web3, walking them through the basics, creating their first wallet, and leading them to their first free NFT. Then, further pushing them towards an understanding of DAOs, Lil Nouns and the broader Nouns ecosystem. **The first step towards mass-proliferation starts with onboarding into web3!** Let's make their first experience a *lil Nounish!*\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/original/1X/6583eaa77df37879cd324a5d972ab7e94c2afb1a.gif)\n\n## Who?\nHi all, Mike Good, here!.. This project started as an idea I wrote and was brought forward through the Ideas Board to find like-minded contributors — I wanted this to be a community driven project. Quickly, a few Lil’s came forward to help collaborate on the idea and we formed a lil team…\n\nSome info on each of us:\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/optimized/1X/9bda1ed6157038cba5ad8e79a8283d0879408ee7_2_568x504.png)\n\nMikeGood - Creative Strategy, Project Manager, Design: [Recently funded via Round 4](https://prop.house/proposal/827) of Lil Nouns Prop.house for a CC0 Music Library ([cc0music.wtf](https://www.cc0music.wtf/)).\n\nBlowned.eth - Writer: Blowned is a web3 writer and creator of [Nouns.blog](https://nouns.blog/), funded in [Round 4 of Prop.house for Nouns LaunchPad](https://prop.house/proposal/154)!\n\nVolky - Developer: Volky will be taking on all development work! He was recently funded to in [Round 8 of Nouns Launch Pad through Prop.house](https://prop.house/proposal/1070). Check it out! [https://studio.noundry.wtf](https://studio.noundry.wtf).\n\nLil 1112 - Designer: 1112 is an incredible designer and early Lil Nouner. [Winner of Lil Nouns Prop.House Round 1](https://prop.house/proposal/384) for his [Lil Nouns asset library](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1117824291358512052)!\n\nTogether, we own 12 Lil Nouns!\n\n***\n\nAfter forming the team, brainstorming ideas, mocking up flows, debating mechanics, starting to write copy for pages, and gaining buy-in from the community in Discourse, we feel like it’s time to bring our idea forward, on-chain~ Thank you again to everyone who has provided feedback on this idea!\n\n## The Idea\n**Mass proliferation of Lil Nouns starts with on-boarding builders, collectors and normal web2 users into web3.**\n\nMost of the time on-boarding information is disjointed and a lot of people rely on friends to help them get started in this space. Has a friend or family member ever asked you to “help them get their first NFT?, ''What is Web3, or the ‘Blockchain’?” — This idea is for them.\n\nOur idea is to create **Nouns101.wtf**, an interactive on-boarding experience for anyone new to web3.\n\n**Here, users would find 5 Sections of content (4 chapters of educational).**\n\nIn under an hour users would be walked through the basics of web3, led to understanding NFTs, and be given a chance to mint their first NFT, for free~ Then, users would learn about DAOs, and be led to information on Nouns and Lil Nouns, driving new users to Lil Nouns onboarding materials.\n\nBelow you’ll find our outline for the workflow with a rough estimate of word-count and read time.\n\n### Chapter 1: New to Web3\n\nThis path is fit for complete beginners to crypto and web3. We go through:\n\n- Web3 Basic terms (300 words)\n- The Blockchain (300 words)\n- Cryptocurrency (300 words)\n- Creating your first crypto wallet (300 words)\n\n### Chapter 2: Understanding NFTs\n\nThis path is fit for those with basic knowledge of crypto and the blockchain, but have not yet explored the world of NFTs. We cover:\n\n- Sending & Receiving NFTs (300 words)\n- How to buy an NFT (300 words)\n- Safety in Web3 (300 words)\n\n### Free Mint: Mint Your First NFT \n\nAfter passing through Section 2, users will be prompted to mint their first free NFT, if they’d like.\n\nHere, users will be able to claim a random “bitNoun,” in a similar style to lilnouns and nouns (but super smol).\n\n**Functionality the mint will work as follows:**\n\nUsers will find themselves watching random “101 noun” generated every 101 seconds. The user will be able to pay a gas fee to mint the “101 noun” on the screen. Be quick!\n\nUnlike typical mint pages, we’ll incorporate tooltips for users to learn more information on the mint experience. Hover over the (?) icon and tips will be exposed for first time users.\n\nNoun…... Lil Noun…...... bitNoun!\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/original/1X/ef1f13a3eaeb085d854ddce018161a347f29af2c.png)\n\nThe mint is intended for educational purposes, but users will have the option to bypass the Chapter’s 1 & 2 to go straight to the mint, if they’d like.\n\nbitNouns will be fully CC0 and have a 0% creator fee.\n\nWe’ll be setting up bitNouns.wtf for the mint page and a Twitter page that will post each time a bitNoun is minted.\n\n**Special shout-out to Mr. Boney, an “un-official” team member, who gifted us 80 bitNoun heads, and the name, “bitNouns!” — Thank you for the support, Boney!\n\n### Chapter 3: NFTs and DAOs / The Community Beyond the JPEG\n\nThis path is perfect for rookie NFT collectors and DAO members, already participating in the web3 space but are keen to explore further. We cover:\n\n- Types of NFTs (Emphasis on CC0) (400 words)\n- Web3 Communities (200 words)\n- What is a DAO? (400 words)\n\n### Chapter 4: Joining a Lil Nouns Dao!\n\nThis path is suited for those in the web3 space, struggling to find a community where they can build to the best of their ability. We cover:\n\n- Nouns DAO (800 words)\n- Lil Nouns DAO (A Sub-DAO) (800 words)\n- Basic onboarding to Lil Nouns (800 words)\n\nHave questions about the content we plan on including, or our outline? Feel free to reach out!\n\n## The User Experience\nNouns101.wtf will be an interactive website, allowing users to pick a section they’d like to start at, and flow through to the next. Progress bars will allow users to understand where they are in the flow, and how much time is left. An interactive “Clippy” might help you find more information, when a user feels like it’s necessary…\n\nHere are screenshots of our working mock-ups of the Home Page and one Chapter Page. Disregard the current text, this is just placeholders while we work on the design! —\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/original/1X/62a0e0943819ef9a7f1f17ab8ecc4424a11719b1.jpeg)\n\nAs a user chooses a chapter they’d be driven through each section, navigating through sub-content for each section of the chapters.\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/original/1X/9576acec578fa159812a82e452753dae449adbd4.jpeg)\n\n## The End Goal\nA resource for not only the Nounish communities to share to help onboard friends, family and acquaintances… But for the masses! Something to help bridge the gap between “Crypto Twitter” and “regular Twitter.” A way for builders to more quickly be able to engage in web3. And ultimately, helping newcomers cut through the noise of Web3, and straight to Nouns and Lil Nouns ⌐◨-◨\n\n## Deliverables\n- Nouns101.wtf website, copy, design, UX with 3-years of hosting.\n- bitNouns.wtf website with 3-years of hosting.\n- bitNouns contract.\n- Nouns101 Twitter page + Tweet Deck Scheduled Posts.\n- bitNouns Twitter page + Tweet Deck Scheduled Posts + Mint Announcement Bot.\n- Marketing materials for Nouns101.wtf (IRL Stickers, GIFs, Images, Promotion through articles, Twitter Spaces, etc…).\n\n## Workload & Timelines\nBelow you’ll find info from each of us on efforts, compensation, and where we’ll each fit in. The goal is to have this project completed in 3 months from the time the prop goes live so we can begin onboarding!\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/lilnouns/optimized/1X/19233057d15093740ab1d11fb8db518be7d0c62c_2_1032x398.png)\n\n***\n\n**Mike Good: Project Management, Creative Strategy, Design -** Keep the project on track and help drive the idea to the finish line.

I’ll also deliver status updates for the community and promote our efforts through Twitter.\n\nI’ll also contribute to the design and overall aesthetic of the project. Creating the initial art that got everyone intrigued in the, I plan on helping lil 1112 bring these bitNoun assets to life!\n\n**Compensation: 4 ETH**\n***\n**Blowned: Writer -** Write content for onboarding flow + copy for website homepage. Basically handle all content writing needs. So far the estimated no. of words to be written is 5K words, but I can see this easily shooting past to 7K+.\n\nAdded on, there’s homepage copy (so far around 700 words, can reach 1K) which I have written and may refine, + a few sections which I have not accounted for (Section 3 for example). Proofreading and further edits is part of my responsibility too.\n\nI’m working with Mike and 1112 for website layout ideation. Alongside that I am planning to work with Volky, to see if additional copy is needed to fit the UX.\n\nTL;DR: 10K Words of Copy & Content + Layout Concepts + Further Copy to fit website UX\n\n**Compensation: 4 ETH**\n***\n**Lil 1112: Designer -** UI design and contributing to UX decisions for the site, trait artworks together with MikeGood, and any visuals the project might require along the way.\n\n**Compensation: 4 ETH**\n***\n**Volky: Developer -** I’ll handle all development and ops needs:\n\nWrite and deploy contracts. Encode and deploy the art to the contract. Develop and deploy educational page + mint page.

Targeting 1 month of promotions, but hope to set up a bot that will schedule Tweets.\n\n**bitNouns:** ‘Sales bot’ (mint) for bitNouns. Similar Tweet Deck for posting scheduled posts related to the free mint + Nouns101.\n\n**Estimated time:** ~ 1 month\n\n**Cost: 0.5 ETH**\n***\n**Contract Deployment costs bitNouns contract deployment costs.**\n\n**Cost: 1 ETH at 10 gwei**\n***\n**Unforeseen costs**\nWe’re padding in one additional eth for any unforeseen costs with development. If we don’t spend this eth, we’ll buy lil nouns and use them to raffle off to help promote Nouns101 on Twitter via retweet contests, etc!\n\n**Cost: 1 ETH**\n***\n**Total Cost for the project: 21 ETH** \nThe ETH will go to the Nouns101.eth multisig we set up. \n***\n### Thank you for the support!\nThank you all for your consideration!

      "content": "## PROP.HOUSE\n![Lil Nouns Prop.House](https://i.postimg.cc/4dhWWBTX/Prop-house.png)\n\nProp house has been a staple of Nouns ecosystem and Lil Nouns in particular. This current Lil Nouns Round (Rd 8) is the last Rd of funded [Prop.House](https://prop.house/lil-nouns) . \n\n - 252 total submitted Props\n- 49 Total payouts\n- 80 ETH funded\n\nThe purpose of this prop is to continue this funding in a manner that is flexible enough for the DAO.  The excitement and engagement created by the diversity of what is Prop.House is unmatched in the Lil Nouns ecosystem IMO. Funding this Proposal will keep Prop.House running **uninterrupted** for another 2-3 rounds. \n\n**TO DO ITEMS**\n1. A new multisig has been created as Seneca and the Prop.House team have signaled they want to move away from active participation in creation and distribution of the infra. They simply want to maintain and build the infrastructure. \n*This is the ONLY reason for a new multi-sig creation and port away from Prop.House involvement in the escrow & distribution*\n[Discord message confirming above](https://discord.com/channels/937017642223538307/937017642743660647/1019719871958884452)\n\n\n- [0x3CF9179127590E16348454886CDd7e7d4AaD3693](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x3CF9179127590E16348454886CDd7e7d4AaD3693/home)\n- current signers: *sqx.pcc.eth, bkraaus, al409, Milad*\n\n2. Fund Mult-sig (above) with 25 ETH\n- Goal is 2+ rounds with the 25 ETH 10x1,10x1.5?, 20x.5? *Mix and Match, but goal is MOAR funding*\n\n3. **Prop.House Party Down** (in all seriousness, just continue uninterrupted)\n\n## FUTURE PLANS\n- *Mandate Rounds* : I think this is the main Prop.House ideation source as of current. this proposal gives a runway of roughly 3-4 weeks to get this figured out before more Prop.House funding will be needed. IMO running concurrently will serve the DAO's best needs. \n\n## Extra Info\n[@LilPropHouse](https://twitter.com/LilPropHouse) : Twitter dedicated to Lil Nouns Prop.House in specific and Prop.House alignment in general.

Agora enables Nouners to signal their funding preference or delegate their votes to others based on alignment of views, leading to more clarity and lower friction for builders to get funded to do valuable things.\n\nAgora successfully launched on Nouns (see more [here](https://twitter.com/nounsagora)) and is looking to expand to Lil Nouns following clear community interest in increasing delegation and voter participation. Bringing Agora to Lil Nouns requires software work, as well as community & operations work.\n\n## What value does this bring to the Lil Nouns Community?\nThe number of votes used in each Lil Nouns prop hovers around 10-15% whereas Nouns is closer to 25-30%. This leaves us at risk of not meeting quorum on important proposals, as well as being more vulnerable to bad actors. A healthy delegation ecosystem is critical to a healthy DAO (see atareh’s [report](https://daoresearch.wtf/Understanding-voter-fatigue-and-DAO-voting-patterns-a-review-b7cbf34d6a50445082aa748b9d9e3a53)) and will also lead to important conversations around the DAO’s objectives and values.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/omMaQls_a9vxDGYCOVowCuVmTq7sLINQoaLTkYRtQMNWcLIpI6yWwRhYigDocROPiAIlvzhSjE4OHA6e2EXN7X8fSwoI1VyPDfjxpev-FYYbzmfanI4De3GGICQSo0gkD5_EnksMAUeNiSUc4sgvkhLo6b-pY8zqf7T01snKet0h-1plg9hBe4eUEg)\n\n\n### Long-Term Value\nThis will significantly improve the delegate and voting experience in the Lil Nouns community, and signal to Nouns builders that Lil Nouns is excited to help support their work and migrations to our DAO, bringing us even more great contributors.",

      "content": "TLDR: Replicate Nouns DAOs process in allocating fast capital to DAO contributors via small/retroactive grants. - Refunding same wallet with 25 ETH, send 15 ETH to Data Pod multisig, and 10 ETH to Content Pod Multisig.\n\n## Intro\nThe on-chain proposal process is not ideal for encouraging small, one-off, or alpha versions of projects/tooling. Eager creators shouldn’t have to wait days for an on-chain proposal to be passed to receive a small amount of ETH. The DAO should not have to submit a formal proposal each time it wants to quickly reward valuable contributors.\n\n## Lil Funding Pool\nWe propose establishing a pool of funds and Lil Nouns NFTs to encourage creators, devs, artists, and contributors to build with Lil Nouns. This pool of capital and NFTs, will be sent to a Gnosis Safe controlled by a small group of Lil Nouners and Lil Nouns DAO.\n\nProposed budget: 50 ETH\n- 25 ETH for lil funding directly\n- 15 ETH for Data Pod (see below lil funding prop)\n- 10 ETH for Content Pod (see below data pod prop)\n\n\n## The aim of the pool will be to:\n\nAcknowledge past contributions to Lil Nouns through retroactive funding\nGrant funds for the development of small, one-off, or alpha version projects\nReward ongoing contributors to Lil Nouns\nSignal that retroactive funding is a viable path to build on Lil Nouns\nReturn Lil Nounder ownership back to to the community.\nAs part of this proposal design, the Lil Nounders expressed a desire to return a substantive portion of their ownership back to the community. To action this desire, they’ve recommended that every 90th Lil Noun will be sent to the Lil Grants safe to be given to community members. \n\n## Funding Committee\nThe Lil Funding Committee will monitor the builder community, retroactively fund previous work as it comes up, and receive informal requests/applications for small project grants. The projects and amounts will be at the committee's discretion.\n\nThe committee’s gnosis safe will require 2 of 5 Lil Nouners to sign, with Lil Nouns DAO acting as a largely symbolic owner and backup. We recommend keeping the signer group small with a team of experienced signers and then add more as we scale up operations and size of the pool.\n\nThe signers on the Safe are:\n\nLil Noun 482 [lil world](https://twitter.com/blequitydao?s=21&t=4kcOclyQ3vWWyCfsl39odg)\nLil Noun 129 [lil john](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer)\nLil Noun 317 [bflynn](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm)\nLil Nounder Dot [Dot](https://twitter.com/0xSVG)\nLil Nouns DAO\nLil Noun 449 [lil al409](https://twitter.com/7x7x7eth)\nLil Noun 1579 [Baba ⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/_babaBlake)\n\nThe committee is open for any Lil Nouners to submit suggestions for grants and contributors that they see as deserving of a reward.\n\n## Submitting Requests\n\nCurrent State:\n[Submissions can be posted here](https://discourse.lilnouns.wtf/c/lil-grants/6)\n[Template for a funding request here](https://discourse.lilnouns.wtf/t/lil-funding-application-template/302) \n\nFuture State:\nWe are excited to begin our pilot of [AddressBoard](https://prop.house/proposal/1211) to begin taking wallet gated funding requests, allow for community to delegation weighted vote on ideas to reflect sentiment, and also comment and reply directly under a proposal. This tool will also incorporate a budget that is a reflection of the amount of ETH allocated for lil funding that has not yet been spent to help make budget informed decisions.\n# Data Pod\n\nData pod mission is to organize Nounish information, to make it accessible, insightful, and useful. For the past months, Data Pod has been providing on-chain data reporting and insights to the community and building data infrastructure for Lil Nouns DAO.\n\nPast work of Data Pod includes Governance and Treasury reports, several Dune dashboards, lilnounsmetrics.com, a Treasury forecast tool, deep dive analysis and recurrent on-chain data support to the community.\n\nRecently, Data Pod was one of the winners of Nouns Mandate Prop House with the Nouns Metrics project (https://prop.house/proposal/1178](https://prop.house/proposal/1178), which, due to the interoperability between Lil Nouns DAO and Nouns DAO, will allow to bring some of the tools built under the scope of Nouns Mandate also to Lil Nouns.\n\nData Pod funding will be used to reward ongoing contributors and to fund building an infrastructure data tool that will make on and off-chain available from a single point of contact for Lil Nouns DAO.\n\n[Data Pod Roadmap (google doc)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_demPpzlSQxVnNZnk0sT_clBlVq5ND3j5x2XpjMQZjk/edit#slide=id.g15397d895e9_0_0)\n# Content  Pod\n\nContent Pod is here to gather and present Lil nouns’ information in exciting, Nounish, and informative manner. \n\nCurrently, content pod is running a [pilot](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/42) where it is funding the DAOs top content needs; from onboarding, to creating memes, to creating social media content. \n\nThe pod is an experimental structure whereby it allows for a combination of Open Scope and Closed Scope work. This request is a continuation of the scope from Prop 42 to continue funding content and operations",

This Multi sig will fund events for community members and also act as a mini funding wallet to fund 1 off and small Lil Noun projects as well.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vZEO3dV.gif)\n\n## WHAT’S NEXT? ⌐◧-◧\nMore events, more proliferation and more recognition! Lil Nouns Event Pod wants to replicate and scale the success of previous events done by community members by pulling everyone that enjoys events together and making the most of these meaningful events! \nThe Event pod will manage the Proposal amount to cover the costs of these events. ETH funding will need to be converted to USD to cover travel costs, merch/swag orders and other event related fees. We will work with different community members on their projects to ensure the best outcomes. \n\nAn additional part of the overall success of Events Pod will come through collaboration with Aubtoshi with Nouns OTG! We will work with other Lil Nounish artists and builders to come up with the most impactful and fun events focusing on on boarding a lot of the time. We are always looking to push the boundaries of our work and take things to the next level when possible. Please reach out via Twitter or Discord (Bloomz#4038) to talk about all things events.\n\n## LONG-TERM “NOUNISH” GOALS ⌐◪-◪\nThis Events Pod is the first clear step for Lil Nouns On The Ground as an appropriate scaling measure. Being able to work with Aubtoshi and Nouns On The Ground will be huge publicity for Lil Nouns. I'm working to scale this Event pod into a solid branch of Lil nouns that will always be working towards a more nounish future in the Web3 space! \n\nTOTAL PROPOSAL ASK: 50 ETH over 3 months ⌐Ξ-Ξ\n\nEvents pod/ Mini fund needs a larger amount of Eth for a few reasons. Funding events is not cheap and a lot of the time prop house amounts arnt even enough to cover costs of the space and everything else included in just throwing the events. Instead of having multiple proposals for each event as they come, this one proposal will cover the costs of  all of the events planned within a 3 month period. The amount will be held in a multi-sig wallet to be distributed to members planning events, 1 off projects, and team running the Events Pod.\n\n\nThere will be 3 individuals for the 2/3 signers verification to ensure proper distribution of funds.\nSigner 1: Bloomz\nSigner 2: Aubtoshi with  Nouns OTG\nSigner 3: Sqx10",

      "title": "Lil Funding + Data Pod + Content Pod Refills",
      "content": "TLDR: Replicate Nouns DAOs process in allocating fast capital to DAO contributors via small/retroactive grants. - Refunding same wallet with 25 ETH, send 15 ETH to Data Pod multisig, and 10 ETH to Content Pod Multisig.\n\n## Intro\nThe on-chain proposal process is not ideal for encouraging small, one-off, or alpha versions of projects/tooling. Eager creators shouldn’t have to wait days for an on-chain proposal to be passed to receive a small amount of ETH. The DAO should not have to submit a formal proposal each time it wants to quickly reward valuable contributors.\n\n## Lil Funding Pool\nWe propose establishing a pool of funds and Lil Nouns NFTs to encourage creators, devs, artists, and contributors to build with Lil Nouns. This pool of capital and NFTs, will be sent to a Gnosis Safe controlled by a small group of Lil Nouners and Lil Nouns DAO.\n\nProposed budget: 50 ETH\n- 25 ETH for lil funding directly\n- 15 ETH for Data Pod (see below lil funding prop)\n- 10 ETH for Content Pod (see below data pod prop)\n\n\n## The aim of the pool will be to:\n\nAcknowledge past contributions to Lil Nouns through retroactive funding\nGrant funds for the development of small, one-off, or alpha version projects\nReward ongoing contributors to Lil Nouns\nSignal that retroactive funding is a viable path to build on Lil Nouns\nReturn Lil Nounder ownership back to to the community.\nAs part of this proposal design, the Lil Nounders expressed a desire to return a substantive portion of their ownership back to the community. To action this desire, they’ve recommended that every 90th Lil Noun will be sent to the Lil Grants safe to be given to community members. \n\n## Funding Committee\nThe Lil Funding Committee will monitor the builder community, retroactively fund previous work as it comes up, and receive informal requests/applications for small project grants. The projects and amounts will be at the committee's discretion.\n\nThe committee’s gnosis safe will require 2 of 5 Lil Nouners to sign, with Lil Nouns DAO acting as a largely symbolic owner and backup. We recommend keeping the signer group small with a team of experienced signers and then add more as we scale up operations and size of the pool.\n\nThe signers on the Safe are:\n\nLil Noun 482 [lil world](https://twitter.com/blequitydao?s=21&t=4kcOclyQ3vWWyCfsl39odg)\nLil Noun 129 [lil john](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer)\nLil Noun 317 [bflynn](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm)\nLil Nounder Dot [Dot](https://twitter.com/0xSVG)\nLil Nouns DAO\nLil Noun 449 [lil al409](https://twitter.com/7x7x7eth)\nLil Noun 1579 [Baba ⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/_babaBlake)\n\nThe committee is open for any Lil Nouners to submit suggestions for grants and contributors that they see as deserving of a reward.\n\n## Submitting Requests\n\nCurrent State:\n[Submissions can be posted here](https://discourse.lilnouns.wtf/c/lil-grants/6)\n[Template for a funding request here](https://discourse.lilnouns.wtf/t/lil-funding-application-template/302) \n\nFuture State:\nWe are excited to begin our pilot of [AddressBoard](https://prop.house/proposal/1211) to begin taking wallet gated funding requests, allow for community to delegation weighted vote on ideas to reflect sentiment, and also comment and reply directly under a proposal. This tool will also incorporate a budget that is a reflection of the amount of ETH allocated for lil funding that has not yet been spent to help make budget informed decisions.\n# Data Pod\n\nData pod mission is to organize Nounish information, to make it accessible, insightful, and useful. For the past months, Data Pod has been providing on-chain data reporting and insights to the community and building data infrastructure for Lil Nouns DAO.\n\nPast work of Data Pod includes Governance and Treasury reports, several Dune dashboards, lilnounsmetrics.com, a Treasury forecast tool, deep dive analysis and recurrent on-chain data support to the community.\n\nRecently, Data Pod was one of the winners of Nouns Mandate Prop House with the Nouns Metrics project (https://prop.house/proposal/1178](https://prop.house/proposal/1178), which, due to the interoperability between Lil Nouns DAO and Nouns DAO, will allow to bring some of the tools built under the scope of Nouns Mandate also to Lil Nouns.\n\nData Pod funding will be used to reward ongoing contributors and to fund building an infrastructure data tool that will make on and off-chain available from a single point of contact for Lil Nouns DAO.\n\nThe signers on the Safe are:\n\nLil Nounder Dot [Dot](https://twitter.com/0xSVG)\nLil Noun 449 [lil al409](https://twitter.com/7x7x7eth)\nLil Noun 1579 [Baba ⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/_babaBlake)\n[Mfrs](https://twitter.com/mfrs_manuel)\n[Brnunes](https://twitter.com/brnunes_eth) \n\nDetails around the [Data Pod Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_demPpzlSQxVnNZnk0sT_clBlVq5ND3j5x2XpjMQZjk/edit#slide=id.g15397d895e9_0_0) can be read here.\n# Content  Pod\n\nContent Pod is here to gather and present Lil nouns’ information in exciting, Nounish, and informative manner. \n\nCurrently, content pod is running a [pilot](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/42) (see scope here) where it is funding the DAOs top content needs; from onboarding, to creating memes, to creating social media content. \n\nThe pod is an experimental structure whereby it allows for a combination of Open Scope and Closed Scope work. This request is a continuation of the scope from Prop 42 to continue funding content and operations \n\n",

      "title": "Lil Nouns Weekly Newsletter",
      "content": "**TLDR:** Lil Saturn and Corgie have been writing the Lil Nouns Weekly Newsletter as a public good for the community for the last 14 weeks. We are requesting funding to continue being paid for another 2 months.\n\nThe purpose of the newsletter is to curate, synthesize, summarize and educate people, both internal and external to the Lil Nouns DAO, on all things (Lil) Nounish happening in our community each week. We share stories of builders, props, and conversations across the Lil Nouniverse, so that readers don’t miss each week’s biggest events.\n\n## Summary\n\nCorgie and I (Lil Saturn 👋) have shipped the weekly newsletter every Sunday for the past 14 weeks (feels like it’s been 3 years, not 3 months! ha! Time in web3 is wild!).\n\nHere is what we’ve achieved since launch:\n-   189 subscribers (screenshot below)\n-   68% open rate (average over time)\n-   3,741 page views to the Newsletter (views are increasing week over week)\n-   282 Twitter followers ([https://twitter.com/lilnounsnews](https://twitter.com/lilnounsnews))\n    \n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/iNEbd2ZNLw40qEBkss7ruo4HDyH2Zt9wqb2Ik7PLk1EqPSclBlkg3zl4mztGhdOJoWT-69fmW18hEFXXTHkBPJt-ONZdivV2BlV5aKmR6-b72KTOtJwxaE-b1t9cx6uJM0x-rJzQQKWEyG5RIzgtB_lNBxdBdEEw6hTg1STZpltsFZfgTkkZDOAFvw)\n\nWe believe the public good will increase in value, as more members are on-boarded into the community (curation and synthesis will become critical as we scale, as well as ensuring the highest number of Lils are showing up to vote on Props on chain and on Prop.House).\n\nWe also believe that the Content Pod can benefit from leveraging the Weekly Newsletter. There can be a lot of noise in Discord, and relying on Twitter means we’re relying on an algorithm we can’t control — having direct access to inboxes once/week is super important to make sure we are staying top-of-mind within the Lil Nouns community.\n\n### Scope (same as what we’ve done the last 14 weeks)\n-   Curate information happening in Nouns DAO\n-   Keep our community up to date with Lil Nouns DAO activities/initiatives\n-   Ensure high engagement on Proposals and other votes\n-   Synthesize important information across the ecosystem\n-   Recap past events, and make community members aware of upcoming events\n- Proliferate the Noun meme to members outside of the DAO\n\n### Past Discussion in #Proposal-Ideas\n-   [https://discord.com/channels/954142017556979752/1017498216167637053](https://discord.com/channels/954142017556979752/1017498216167637053)\n\n### Lil Nouns Weekly Newsletter Terms\n-   Total: 9 ETH (this covers the 9 Sundays of September+October)\n-   1 ETH per post, split evenly between Corgie and Lil Saturn",

      "title": "Sweep Lil Nouns. Join Metatopia and Play to Earn.",
      "content": "Proposed Idea 🗒: \n\n100 ETH grant for Sweepers to Sweep 50 Lil nouns to bring awareness to the project and add to the Legacy Vault for bidding on by Sweepers Members. Secure a spot in Season 3 (Lil Nouns characters) to be stake and played in the play to earn game Metatopia. LilNouns will get their own dedicated location (maybe the PropHouse) on the map and participate alongside all the other characters in the game. 🔥\n\n(Inspired by Lil Nouns)\n\nWhat are Sweepers 🧹?\n\nStake a Sweeper in the GARAGE and Earn $DUST token. Bid in THE VAULT (an auction based marketplace) to purchase Blue Chip NFT projects for $DUST. The goal is to stake and earn as many $DUST tokens as possible to have buying power in THE VAULT. Each NFT auction will start at a bid of one $DUST token.\n \nSweepers are a generative 32x32 non-fungible token project on the Ethereum (ERC-721) blockchain. A Sweeper is generated on chain every 10-minutes and is auctioned off to the highest bidder.\n\nSweepers Auctions 👈:\n\nOne Sweepers is auctioned every 10 minutes, forever. One interface for participating in Sweepers auctions is SweepersClub.com, which is a website built and maintained by the project founders. \n\nEach Sweeper is an irrevocable member of Sweepers and entitled to one vote in all governance proposals to sweep. Sweepers can use their voting abilities (remember, 1 Sweeper = 1 vote) to direct the treasury sweeps of any proposed NFT project. They can create and vote on governance proposals, executing transactions on the Ethereum blockchain when approved.\n\nThe $DUST Token 💰:\n\n$DUST Token is the reward token earned daily by all Sweepers Members who stake their Sweeper NFT in the GARAGE. The GARAGE will be a platform on the Sweepers website, allowing members to stake their Sweeper NFT to earn Dust Token. Dust Token will have two utilities.\n\nThe first utility will allow members to collect a balance of Dust Tokens and use their earned Dust Tokens to bid on auctions in THE VAULT platform, an auction marketplace where all swept NFT assets will be listed for auction. \n\nDust Token's second utility will be to sell any balance of Dust Token in the Peer to Peer exchange called The Dust Exchange. Here Sweepers Members can offer any amount of Dust Token for Sale and accept offers made on their Dust Token. \n\nThe Dust Token will never have a liquidity pool added to it or be tradable on an exchange. Dust Token is to be used inside of the Sweepers Project only. \n\nTHE VAULT 🏦:\n\nTHE VAULT is an online auction marketplace where swept NFT assets are sent to be offered off at auction starting at one Dust Token each. All swept assets from Sweepers Member Proposals, Sweep Tank Events, and Reserve Fund sweeps get sent to THE VAULT. \n\nThe VAULT will host many different auction lengths based on the type of sweep, type of project, etc. The idea is for everyone to participate in THE VAULT Auctions regardless of the number of Sweeper NFTs each holder owns or stakes. \n\nWith $DUST Tokens, the buying power of the Sweepers Members will rotate, and the idea is that everyone will have a chance to participate in the long run. \n\nThe strategy will be everything, some will buy as soon as possible, and others will wait for the grail NFT they have wanted for a long time. \n\nThe Dust Exchange 🔁:\n\nThe Dust Exchange is a place that allows Sweepers Members the ability to buy or sell their Dust Token amongst members of Sweepers. Some members will be waiting for the grail NFT they always wanted, and some will be just short of being able to win a bid and in need of a top off of more Dust Tokens.\n\nThe Dust Exchange will allow Sweepers Members to list their Dust Token for a buy-it-now price and accept offers on their chosen balance. \n\nMembers of Sweepers can choose to either Buy $DUST Tokens at the list price or make an offer to buy at a price offered on a secondary market, which allows for a healthy exchange environment for Dust Tokens.\n\nLearn More:\n\nhttps://www.sweepersclub.com/ \nhttps://Twitter.com/SweepersClub \nhttps://app.gitbook.com/o/5g7JoONG1PdvvI4LsYP9/s/92t6iUSx2j7FSYQVWU2h/sweepers/intro-to-sweepers \n\nWhat is Metatopia 💻?\n\nIntroducing Metatopia, the first blockchain staking game built with Swap 2.0 technology! \n\nEver since the Topia Stone entered MetaTopias’ atmosphere, the four regions of Bull Street, MoonForce HQ, PYE Market, and DOGE World have worked together utilizing the $TOPIA Tokens' limitless potential.\n\nThe Aliens are on a mission to retrieve the Stone and will stop at no means to reclaim it. The four regions of Metatopia need help protecting the Topia Stone and are acquiring backup through their Legacy Program.\n\nHolders can use LegacyFriends Genesis and Alpha NFT characters to enter MetaTopia and earn $TOPIA tokens.\n\n$TOPIA will be the world’s first ever Swap 2.0 P2E token on the blockchain, built with algorithmic contract logic to ensure longer-term token sustainability.\n\nNow it's your turn to harness the power of $TOPIA by participating in the first blockchain staking game built with Swap 2.0 technology! This is a one of a kind and never before seen in NFT Space swap router built for sustainability and tokenomics.\n\nMany P2E staking games have experienced a downfall due to broken tokenomics that power their reward tokens. $TOPIA uses algorithmic contract logic to ensure its long-term value by continuously maintaining and sustaining its liquidity on decentralized exchanges.\n\nThis progressive technology mitigates artificial sell pressure caused by fees associated with swapping tokens and selling them on the secondary market. Instead, $TOPIA will take the fees directly from its paired asset (ETH) to eliminate the need to dump the reward token itself. Thus, sustaining $TOPIA for years to come.\n\nhttps://MetatopiaWorld.com   \nhttps://Twitter.com/MetatopiaWorld  \n",

      "content": "![Header](https://imgur.com/06maWgl.jpg)\n_Tokens used to submit proposal 43 were sold and proposal was canceled. This is a resubmission of the same proposal._\n\n###### **What is Prop Lot?**\n\nProp Lot is a token weighted bulletin board for ideas. It launched a few weeks ago as an experimental approach to activating members, by giving them a place to post ideas and receive feedback in the form of up/down votes from other members.\n\n###### **Why we built it**\n\nLil Nouns onboards new members fast. For them to start contributing and engaging with the DAOs activities is not always easy. Coordination tools like Discord can get hectic, with Ideas getting lost in threads, discussions losing momentum and cognitive overload discouraging new members from becoming active ones. To solve this, we built Prop Lot. Instead of starting a thread in Discord to share your idea, you can simply submit it to Prop Lot using your Lil Noun. Members can then upvote or downvote your idea based on the number of Lil Nouns they hold. The ideas most favoured by the DAO will rise to the top.\n\n###### **Reflections from our MVP**\n\nWith 50 submissions, 120 comments and 100s of votes placed on Prop Lot already, it’s clear to see how eager Lil Nouners are to contribute. Having the infrastructure to capture those contributions meant that no contribution was lost, allowing them all to receive a more accurate consensus of how the community felt. Some submissions progressed from a suggestion to an on-chain proposal. Key takeaways from our MVP:\n\n-   **Ideas progress faster.**  Because support is highly visible (vote count), ideas that have potential move forward much faster.\n-   **Activation energy to contribute is lower.**  Because of the simple workflow (token -> form -> list), ideas are effortlessly thrown onto Prop Lot by any member. As opposed to having to figure out how a community uses Discord, catching up on discussions, starting a thread, etc.\n\n###### **Prop Lot 2.0**\n\nWith this proposal, we will focus on developing Prop Lot into the main node of contribution and coordination in Lil Nouns. This involves updating the UX to enable the progression from idea to active contribution with features like:\n\n-   Profile pages to track contributions, showcase skills and Karma style points\n-   Notifications of activity around ideas\n-   New ways of sorting, archiving, tagging and tracking ideas\n\n![design_0](https://imgur.com/5tEQmvW.jpg)  \n![design_1](https://imgur.com/rxguive.jpg)  \n![design_2](https://imgur.com/0kirQA4.jpg)\n\n###### **Prop Lot 2.0 will help Lil Nouners unlock opportunities**\n\nThe Noun ecosystem champions builders. We want to encourage participation by not only making it trustless, but by helping make the sum of those contributions mean something tangible. Prop Lot does this by tracking a Lil Nouner’s contributions and awarding them Karma style points for those contributions. This will act like an on-chain resume which they can then use as a show of credibility for bigger opportunities.\n\n###### **Help Lil Nouns DAO achieve its mission**\n\nLil Nouns aims to expose the world to all things Nounish. Doing that successfully requires us to recreate the magic of Nouns for our ‘layer’ in the ecosystem. As a governance layer, Nouns’ magic is predicated on permissionless coordination around a mission. As a participation layer, I believe Lil Nouns’ magic will be underpinned by the ability to trustlessly participate in the activities of a mission. Conceptually, that is exactly what Prop Lot allows: trustless participation for anyone with a Lil Noun, by reducing their dependency on tools like Discord and Discourse.\n\n###### **And unlock the DAO’s social capital**\n\nIf successful, Prop Lot will go beyond enabling contributions and give us a better way of coordinating. In doing so, the DAO will be able to unleash the power of its social capital: all the eager Lil Nouners who are full of ideas and skills, but lack the platform to showcase them. By simply pushing new members to Prop Lot instead of Discord, we will be able to engage them in Nounish activities as soon as they join, making Prop Lot the first step to becoming Nounish.\n\n###### **Funds Requested**\n\nThis proposal requests 49 ETH working capital for 3 months of operations.\n\n###### **Deliverables**\n\nWe’ll release the features in phases during the 3 months. Ideally, by the end Prop Lot would cater to all of our needs to coordinate around our mission, which may include the ability to find collaborators and form teams.\n\n###### **Who is behind this proposal?**\n\nLil Nounder adelidusiam, I’m building Prop Lot alongside Lil Nouners frog and 0xtob with help from lil dot and bflynn.\n\n###### **Multisig**\n\nThe multisig (0x5cA40836E6473a495148972a13Dd9014797C0e92) will require 2 of 3 signers (adelidusiam, frog and 0xtob)\n\n###### **Wall of love (Twitter, Discord and Bankless)**\n\n![Opinions](https://imgur.com/wNOlZAZ.jpg)",

This approach allows the DAO to acquire Nouns via auction to support Nouns DAO treasury and increase our Noun token holding. We plan on leveraging a new multisig to conduct bidding until we have a trustless/bot solution ready for launch. In this proposal, we will request 75 ETH to be used to bid. We have also already sent a lil noun to the new multisig and registered the subdomain acquisitions.lilnouns.eth to the multisig to be visible in the Nouns auction bidding feed. \n\n## Past approach and issues\n\nWe will no longer be buying from secondary and making OTC deals like our prior sales because they incur a net loss of ETH to Nouns DAO treasury and the practice is easily gamed by secondary market participants. We established our initial holding via OTC deals to assure successful acquisitions, and now that we are established, we will only support Nouns DAO treasury going forward. \n\n## Workstream mandates\n\n- Attempt to acquire 1 Nouns from the daily public auction. \n- For any given auction, do not exceed 20% of average settle price of the last three (3) auctions. \n- If a nouns is successfully acquired, we will send it directly to the treasury upon settlement of the token. \n\n## Workstream members\n\nal409 - al409.eth\n\nVictor Solomon - vsvsvs.eth\n\nBrook - broook.eth\n\nAmes - ames.eth\n\nNoun Acquisiton Committee Multisig: 0x0D596A63E02b76169A94285d6E82E81282c6eb8c",

      "content": "Written by [Brook](https://twitter.com/MrBrookG).\n\n### Purpose\n\nGather public facing information about Lil Nouns and present it in a nounish, informative, and exciting manner using a variety of media; writing, visual, audio, or a combination.\n\n### **Description**\n\nIn light of current DAO needs to produce content in all its forms (video, audio, written or any combination), it is time to setup Content Pod. Content Pod will be responsible for creating public facing content by taking requests and information from various Lil Nouns’ touchpoints: discord, website, social media. \n\nThe pod focuses on retaining talent through open scope work, while making sure the DAO’s content needs are being met by requesting a list of deliverables and using bounties to supplement ongoing efforts by active contributors.\n\n# Pod Structure\n\n## Multisig\n\n- A multisig for Content Pod has been setup. These are the signers:\n    - Lil Dot\n    - Lil Al409\n    - Brook\n    - motiondesign\n    - vsvsvs\n    - baba\n\n## Components, Processes, and Tools\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe structure allows for open scope collaboration to give active contributors creative freedom while supplementing Lil Nouns' content needs by using requests and bounties.\n\n- Operations will primarily take place in Lil Nouns Discord and led by Brook. In addition, a simple website, and a social media account will be its public-facing touchpoint.\n- Core work vs one-off\n    - Active contributors will be elected into the pod and they outline their deliverables\n    - One-off contributors will collaborate on scope or work on bounties\n- Funds will be properly documented and communicated with Lil Nouns community.\n\n## Components\n\nPresentations, brainstorming sessions, and requirement setting events help generate and present ideas at different touch points: Discord, Social Media, and Website. \n\n![Content Pod Components.png](https://i.postimg.cc/7YvRNb5M/Content-Pod-Components.png)\n\n## Processes\n\nA conceptual breakdown of the processes taking place inside the Pod structure.\n\n![Content-Pod-Processes.png](https://i.postimg.cc/sx8snzZG/Content-Pod-Processes.png)\n\n## Tools\n\nThese are the tools used by Content Pod.\n\n![Content-Pod-Tools.png](https://i.postimg.cc/sgLHvXCh/Content-Pod-Tools.png)\n\nSee sample of Discord configuration for Content Pod below:\n![Untitled-design.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/N0w0WZg2/Untitled-design.gif)\n\n## Leads\n\n### Content Pod Core Contributor\n\n[motiondesign](https://twitter.com/motiondesigneth), who is one of our active community members will be one of Content Pod’s core contributors. He has always been interested in coordination; from coordinating undergraduates and graduate students, building out an online resource that is used to date for helping undergraduates find opportunities to learn in the medical field, to running a program within a 501c3 for years while completing two undergraduate degrees and working two jobs. Here is an overview of his scope:\n\n- Gather requirements\n- Define scope based on requirements\n- Build a team of content creators to work on defined scope\n\n### Pod Operations Lead\n\n[Brook](https://twitter.com/mrbrookg) will be leading the operations for Content Pod. \n\nBrook is an active contributing member in Lil Nouns whose vested interest in coordination of work has led him to his recent work conceptualizing Data Pod. In [this presentation deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12tikyb_3T9awBfLJAqLH9laEEXSddYk5/view?usp=sharing), he was able to deconstruct Data Pod, and reconstruct it in a way that facilitates builders to do the thing they are good at – building. He takes insights from the deck to facilitate operations in Content Pod. Here is an overview of operations scope:\n\n- Coordinating the selection of active contributors who will receive Open Scope for more creative freedom\n- Coordinating requirement setting meetings, and brainstorming sessions\n- Surfacing and communicating DAO needs to Content Pod and vice-versa\n- Establish and maintain communication inside the DAO and out as written above\n\n# Budget: 5 ETH\n\n- Here is a spending breakdown for this pilot.\n    - Open Scope contributors will outline their own set of deliverables\n    - Funding will also be spent on bounties to supplement Open Scope work and further meet DAO needs",

      "content": "This proposal activates a new version of the Nouns Descriptor contract, which contains many improvements upon the previous version. The Descriptor is the contract that stores and renders Lil Noun artwork and token metadata.\n\n**Descriptor Improvements:**\n- Significantly cheaper on-chain art deployment, which largely benefits builders that fork the Nouns protocol. The gas required to deploy the Nouns artwork has been reduced nearly 5x.\n- Improved external API, which boosts composability by allowing external contracts to more easily hook into the Noun artwork and rendering engine.\n- Improved descriptor upgradability. The new descriptor separates the artwork, renderer, and facilitator contracts, which enable much cheaper upgrades (e.g. trait retirement).\n\nThis upgrade is forked from Nouns DAO. Code has been reviewed by multiple technical community members, has unit/integration test coverage, and has been tested on both Rinkeby and Mainnet.\n\n- [Nouns DAO Prop - Descriptor V2 Upgrade](https://nouns.wtf/vote/114)\n- [Nouns DAO Prop - Integrate 8/8 Anniversary Art](https://nouns.wtf/vote/125)\n- [Specification](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-tech/blob/main/descriptor-v2/README.md)\n- [Pull Request](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/pull/499)\n\n**Artwork Upgrades and Patches**\nThis proposal introduces lil versions of all 8/8 Nouns DAO anniversary art additions (8 heads, 3 accessories, and 2 glasses).\n\nIn addition, we’ve retroactively fixed eight art errors and oversights, including one token metadata patch. These fixes will not only apply to art moving forward, but will reach back in time to correct Lil Nouns that contain the offending traits. All fixes are either recoloring of existing pixels or removing of extra pixels or reassigning hidden pixels. Most errors are likely a result of iteration and palette color reduction prior to the launch of Nouns and Lil Nouns - some that melded two colors into one, or put two formerly-different colors closer to one another.\n\n##### Heads\n![Heads](https://imgur.com/zzcegLr.jpg)\n##### Accessories\n![Accessories](https://imgur.com/5B9IIAX.jpg)\n##### Glasses\n![Glasses](https://imgur.com/i7E7Jko.jpg)\n##### Art Patches\n![Art Patches](https://imgur.com/uKmSecT.jpg)",

Our HQ is a 1,300 street-front retail space with high foot-traffic in downtown Austin, TX. \n\nCrypto Learn Lab is a short walk from the convention center, South Congress st., and the ever-boisterous 'dirty' 6th st. We believe in the long-term vision of the Nouns ecosystem and continue to leverage our IRL location to bring exposure to the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, SXSW is a hybrid convention with innovative sessions, film & tv screenings, music show cases, and activations which engulf Austin, TX for ten straight days in the middle of Spring Festival. Check out the link below. As a local who has attended multiple times, I can promise it is a one-of-a-kind experience. NFT projects had a huge presence last year with Doodles & Fluff World both hosting epic events. \n\nPart of the draw of SXSW is having a home-base to relax, refuel, and recap during your endless adventures. By funding such a space at Crypto Learn Lab during SXSW 2023, Lil Nouns DAO will provide the opportunity to deepen bonds within our Nounish community while gaining immense exposure IRL. We want to be a steward for Lil Nouns DAO during SXSW and set our attending community members up for a successful conference. \n\n25 ETH Total Budget @ $1,525 / ETH\n$33,250_ 21.8 ETH.. Unlimited SXSW scheduling\n$4,900_ 3.15 ETH..  Daily Events Budget (9 days)\n\nThe $33,250 is Crypto Learn Lab’s firm opportunity cost on the space during SXSW 2023. The daily event budget of 0.35 ETH is based on current ETH price and initial planning. If funded, we will work diligently with the community to determine what to do with any extra funds in the case of an ETH 2.0-fueled price run over the next few months. Crypto Learn Lab can either spend the excess on the activation, provide giveaways to attendees, or return ETH to the treasury.\n\nTeam Description\n\nThe founder of Crypto Learn Lab, tlogs.eth, has been deeply-involved in decentralized finance since its inception. Before starting his career as a CPA, Ty discovered his love of teaching leading weekly lectures as a TA for the Accounting Department while at UCSB. He discovered the Ethereum network in late 2015 and has participated in the ecosystem since its public launch. Logsdon served as the EVP of Finance for a leading bitcoin ATM firm before launching Crypto Learn Lab to accelerate DeFi’s mass adoption amongst the general public.\n\nRelevant Links\n\nhttps://www.sxsw.com/\t\nwww.cryptolearnlab.com\nwww.learntokencommunity.com\t",

      "title": "Lil Funding Season 4",
      "content": "TLDR: Replicate Nouns DAOs process in allocating fast capital to DAO contributors via small/retroactive grants. - Refunding same wallet with 100 eth\n\n## Intro\nThe on-chain proposal process is not ideal for encouraging small, one-off, or alpha versions of projects/tooling. Eager creators shouldn’t have to wait days for an on-chain proposal to be passed to receive a small amount of ETH. The DAO should not have to submit a formal proposal each time it wants to quickly reward valuable contributors.\n\n## Lil Funding Pool\nWe propose establishing a pool of funds and Lil Nouns NFTs to encourage creators, devs, artists, and contributors to build with Lil Nouns. This pool of capital and NFTs, will be sent to a Gnosis Safe controlled by a small group of Lil Nouners and Lil Nouns DAO.\n\n**Proposed budget: 100 ETH**\n\n## The aim of the pool will be to\n- Acknowledge past contributions to Lil Nouns through retroactive funding\n- Grant funds for the development of small, one-off, or alpha version projects\n- Reward ongoing contributors to Lil Nouns\n- Signal that retroactive funding is a viable path to build on Lil Nouns\n- Return Lil Nounder ownership back to to the community.\n- As part of this proposal design, the Lil Nounders expressed a desire to return a substantive portion of their ownership back to the community. To action this desire, they’ve recommended that every 90th Lil Noun will be sent to the Lil Grants safe to be given to community members. \n\n## Funding Committee\nThe Lil Funding Committee will monitor the builder community, retroactively fund previous work as it comes up, and receive informal requests/applications for small project grants. The projects and amounts will be at the committee's discretion.\n\nThe committee’s gnosis safe will require 2 of 5 Lil Nouners to sign, with Lil Nouns DAO acting as a largely symbolic owner and backup. We recommend keeping the signer group small with a team of experienced signers and then add more as we scale up operations and size of the pool.\n\nThe signers on the Safe are:\n\n- Lil Noun 482 [lil world](https://twitter.com/blequitydao?s=21&t=4kcOclyQ3vWWyCfsl39odg)\n- Lil Noun 129 [lil john](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer)\n- Lil Noun 317 [bflynn](https://twitter.com/Flynnjamm)\n- Lil Nounder Dot [Dot](https://twitter.com/0xSVG)\nLil Nouns DAO\n- Lil Noun 449 [lil al409](https://twitter.com/7x7x7eth)\n- Victor Solomon [vsvsvs](https://twitter.com/victorsolomon)\n\n**The committee is open for any Lil Nouners to submit suggestions for grants and contributors that they see as deserving of a reward.**\n\n[Submissions can be posted here](https://discourse.lilnouns.wtf/c/lil-grants/6)\n[Template for a funding request here](https://discourse.lilnouns.wtf/t/lil-funding-application-template/302)",

Heavily involved with Lil Nouns - League of Lils, Lil Grant signee and recently elected to Nouncil. And designed / produced the [Nouns on Chain fine jewelry pendants](https://nounsonchain.wtf/) I think Prop House provides us with the most democratic way to vet and select projects as a community and should be our primary source of funding and support at a project's onset -- so, bringing this project through a low-tier Prop House round to get the proverbial ball rolling.\n\n**What:** The basketball is a ubiquitous cultural touchstone and class-agnostic collectible object -- an instrument of mass appeal and vehicle for creative contribution. I've boot-strapped through having my basketball production factory make a signature Lil Noun basketball, referencing the branding and aesthetic of the project -- would like to fine tune the design with the community and go into a large production to use these pieces to proliferate IRL.\n\n![Unknown-5.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/40OFLCF.jpeg)\n\n![Unknown-8.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/klXXkRI.jpeg)\n\n![Unknown.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/kluHF6V.jpeg)\n\n![MiniBallPackaging_rev-01.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/dHSTNoD.png)\n\n**How:** Brought the genesis of this idea through Prop House for initial screening through the community and garnered much support (thanks guys!) Shared development process with community to fine tune design [(see thread here)](https://discord.com/channels/954142017556979752/1009122281299120218) and ready to embark on mass production of 500 pieces. These 500 units will be for community gifting, cross-platform giveaways (Social, NOC, newsletter, etc.) and for sale on some yet-to-be-determined e-commerce platform — with revenue to be directed back to Lil Nouns treasury.\n\n**How much:** Shared production costs across several tiers and in conversation with community, 500 units looks to be production preference — with the ability to re-order more pieces if needed.\n\n500 pieces will cost: $18/per piece + $1,200 for shipping = total of $10,200, or 6.13E (as of 8/24, rounding up to 6.5 to protect against volatility) \n\nWould like to add additional 1E to cover assembly and domestic shipping of pieces to Lil Noun family: \n\n**Timeline:** Once approved and received, factory production requires ~30 days, and shipping another ~30 - timing out perfect to deploy Lil Nouns mini-basketballs aligned with NBA season tipoff.\n\n![LilNounMiniBasketballPricing.png](https://i.imgur.com/QiuB7l8.png)\n\n**Total ask: 7.5E**",

      "title": "3D Lil Nouns Generator MVP",
      "content": "**3D Lil NOUNS GENERATOR MVP**\n**TL;DR**\nBuild a 3D Lil Nouns generator MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and create a 15 second promotional video that Lil Nouns can share on Twitter. \n\nIf you’re not familiar with our recent proposal, please check [proposal 34](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/34) and [3D Nouns](https://3DNouns.com).\n\n![3D Lil nouns](https://jiji-studio.com/assets/LilNounsWalking.jpg)\n\n**ORIGIN OF THE PROJECT**\nCommunity feedback suggested the size and scope of prop 34 was too large as a percentage of the Lil Nouns Treasury, so we are now putting forward a minimal version, with the possibility of a full version in the future. We really want to build for Lil Nouns DAO and show that we are willing to listen and work with the community to provide value. Based on many public and private discussions, we believe we can turn this proposal into something the community fully supports.\nBeing invested in Lil Nouns, we also want to understand the DAO’s position when it comes to fund builders and we are running this experiment to further the discussion about the DAO's mission.\n\n**WHAT IS IT**\nBy creating a stripped down version and offering promotional video content, we hope to show that a 3D Lil Nouns web application will generate value for the community. Being CC0, we believe one of the leading goals for Lil Nouns should be to proliferate their brand and influence out into the world. Based on the response to 3D Nouns, a 3D Lil Nouns generator would be a fantastic tool for that, while also encouraging other developers and creators to come and build for the community.  \nIt would extend the Lil Nouns ecosystem into the 3D world and allows for animations, games, renders and more to be built using the exported model files. It opens up a world of possibilities for the Lil Nouns ecosystem, which will result in more derivatives and more memes over time. \nOne example using 3D Nouns is [Xanadu's recent video on twitter](https://twitter.com/pwnelon/status/1560280539105353728?s=20&t=rN_TUCxvmLoRo3y0QicgkA) where he animates the 3D nouns models using motion capture. Pretty cool! See Blu [@pwnelon](https://twitter.com/pwnelon) on Twitter. \n\n\n**VALUE PROPOSITION**\nNouns success is largely based on the proliferation of Nouns out into the community via proposals, small or large. We believe that props being deployed for Lil Nouns elevates the status and legitimacy of the brand, and encourages other developers to build on top of it.\nWeb applications that further spread and proliferate the brand are one of the best ways to grow Lil nouns, as people can access them from anywhere at any time. \nOn top of that, we are convinced 3D Lil Nouns can unlock the “Hello Kitty” potential of the brand since seeing them animated in 3D is appealing to a wider audience. \nOur team is supported by the NounsDAO and larger NFT twitter accounts, and has demonstrated our ability to execute well. One year after being funded, 3D Nouns continues to be used by the community (both the application and the 3D assets) to drive value to NounsDAO. \n3D Nouns has had numerous large accounts express interest and receive a 3D Noun model to display in different 3D environments (Deeze, Farokh, Benito from RTFKT, Bharat, and more), and we see the same thing happening with 3D Lil Noun models. 3D Nouns also provides long term value to NounsDAO, even a year after being funded (see Xanadu). Builders building on top of builders. We believe 3D Lil Nouns would have a similar ripple effect. \nAdditionally, the next logical step is to have 3D Lil Nouns running around in the metaverse. 3D interoperable metaverses will happen sooner than we think, and with the models available, Lil Nouns can be easily ported across numerous platforms. The Otherside from BAYC plans to offer a SDK that will be compatible with outside 3D models, and 3D Lil Nouns will be ready to go. It is important to position ourselves to be future proof. \n\n**SCOPE OF THE PROJECT**\nIn order to build a 3D Lil Nouns web application, we need:\n**1) Sample size of 20 Lil Nouns traits (20 heads, 20 accessories, etc) recreated in 3D**. The scale of Lil Nouns is different from Nouns, so unfortunately we’re unable to use the models from 3D Nouns and will need to remodel them.\n**2) 3D web application similar to https://3dnouns.com/.** This will be a minimal, stripped down version that allows the user to completely customize their 3D Lil Noun from the available traits and download the model as a GLTF file and can be imported into Blender and converted to other popular formats like .obj and .fbx depending on the user’s needs and modeling softwares. The site will be hosted on 3DLilnouns.com which has already been acquired. \n**3) 15 seconds promotional video** advertising the 3D Lil Nouns project and application for Lil Nouns to promote on social media. Lil Nouns prop house previously funded us to make a promotional 3D Lil Nouns video https://prop.house/proposal/541 that was well received and viewed over 6000 times.\n\n **PROJECT TIMELINE**\nBased on the work completed for 3D Nouns, **we estimate development will take around 3 to 4 weeks**. \nAfter completion of this proposal, another discussion will be started with the Lil Nouns community to gauge the impact and success of the project, and see if the community is interested in funding the full version of the project. If the community does decide to fund a full version of the project in the future, the cost of this proposal will be subtracted from the cost of the full scale, fully featured version of the application. \n\n**WHO IS BUILDING THIS**\n**- Coral Orca https://twitter.com/coralorca**\nCoral Orca is the creator behind 3D Nouns and is responsible for all assets, animations, level design, and general look and feel of the application as well as  marketing and business development. He has been active in the nouns community since june 2021 as its first builder, and has contributed to the project via collaborations with SharkDAO, published AR filters that were used by VaynerNFT and Budlight, and is also a founding member of the Nouncil. 3D Nouns Figurines collectors include Deeze, Benito from RTFKT, and Bharat Krymo to cite a few.\n**- 0xFloyd https://twitter.com/0xFloyd**\n0xFloyd will be responsible for development of the web application. 0xFloyd is currently employed as a full time software engineer working at a startup in Web3. Floyd has been a part of the Nouns community since Day 1, and has worked on numerous different projects in the Nouns ecosystem. Along with building 3D Nouns (3Dnouns.com) with Coral Orca for NounsDAO Proposal 2, 0xFloyd was the frontend engineer for NounsDAO Proposal 3, Nouns Party (available at nouns.party), and helped make significant contributions to the Nounify app (available at nounify.wtf) with @12bnoun and @lastpunk9999.  \n\n**COMPENSATION**\nWe are asking for a total of 10 ETH to be transferred in one full payment upon successful proposal vote. \n10 ETH for asset modeling and V1 of the web application as detailed in the scope of the project section, and an accompanying 15 second promotional video advertising 3D Lil Nouns and the 3D Lil Nouns generator for Lil Nouns to post and advertise on social media. \n\nTRANSACTIONS\n10 ETH to 0x8833Db8110D54c5632B67b83441AccbdA5B23bF4",

      "title": "3D Lil Nouns Generator",
      "content": "![3D Lil nouns are so cute](https://jiji-studio.com/assets/faroko.jpg)\n\n[https://twitter.com/farokh/status/1537542624952950785](https://twitter.com/farokh/status/1537542624952950785)\n\n## TL;DR\n*A 3D Lil Nouns generator web app that allows you to compose and download your own Lil 3D Noun rigged character as a 3D file.*\n\n## ORIGIN OF THE PROJECT\n\nWhat’s up Lil Nouns?! We are [Coral Orca](https://twitter.com/CoralOrca) and [0xFloyd](https://twitter.com/0xFloyd), early builders in the Nouns community. \nWe love Nouns and Lil Nouns, and we are looking to extend the Lil Nouns ecosystem with a proposal to build a 3D web application that allows users to generate their own 3D Lil Nouns!\n\n## WHAT IS IT\n\nIt will be similar to what we built for [3dnouns.com](https://3dnouns.com) and will allow users to create and download custom 3D Lil Nouns. Users can sort through each trait to create the perfect Lil Noun, or randomly generate Lil Nouns to explore possibilities.\n\nThese 3D Lil Nouns will also be capable of performing animations, including a \"walk\", \"run\", \"dance\" and more. This lets users imagine what their Lil Noun would look like exploring a 3D metaverse! Once the perfect Lil Noun is designed, the corresponding 3D model is available for download as a GLTF file and can be imported into [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and converted to other popular formats like .obj and .fbx depending on the user’s needs.\n\n**A 3D Lil Nouns generator extends the Lil Nouns ecosystem into the 3D world and allows for animations, games, renders and more to be built by the community using the exported model files. It opens up a world of possibilities for the Lil Nouns ecosystem, which will result in more derivatives and more memes over time!** ![3D Lil nouns](https://jiji-studio.com/assets/LilNounThumbUp.png)\n\nHave a look at this [https://twitter.com/coralorca/status/1552261876176027648](https://twitter.com/coralorca/status/1552261876176027648?s=20&t=UCgUyEFyYSdtA7bo1tcQmg) to see some possibilities. \n\n![3D Lil nouns](https://jiji-studio.com/assets/LilNounsWalking.jpg)\n\n\n## PROJECT ETHOS\n\n3D Lil Nouns will be freely available to download as .GLTF models and use openly under CC0. The community can use their 3D Lil Noun files for anything their heart desires!\nWe also want to build in the open as much as possible and will be happy to incorporate any community inputs. \n\n## VALUE PROPOSITION\n\nAs we are all big fans of Nouns, we know that their success is largely based on the proliferation factor. Nouns has had many large proposals that have built out important side projects and we were the first project funded by the NounsDAO.\n\nCurrently, Lil Nouns doesn’t have any large extension project on the proposal docket. 3D Lil Nouns would be the first and act as a portal into gaming and animation.\n\nLastly, 3D Nouns has had numerous large accounts express interest and ultimately receive a 3D Noun model to display in their personal galleries ([Deeze](https://twitter.com/DeezeFi), [Farokh](https://twitter.com/Farokh), [Benito](https://twitter.com/benitopagotto) from RTFKT, [Bharat Krymo](https://twitter.com/krybharat), and more. See collection [opensea.io/collection/3d-nouns-figurines](https://opensea.io/collection/3d-nouns-figurines) ). Some 3D Nouns are looking comfy in [oncyber.io/deezepod2](https://oncyber.io/deezepod2) and Deeze mentionned in a recent podcast how excited he is about 3D NFTs like 3D Nouns. \n\n![Deeze](https://jiji-studio.com/assets/deeze.jpg)\n\n[https://twitter.com/DeezeFi/status/1537568913059356672](https://twitter.com/DeezeFi/status/1537568913059356672?s=20&t=6IiKFnkU63XH9w_rA2V5bw)\n\nWe think the same thing could happen with 3D Lil Noun models, leading to a stronger brand!\nOnce this proposal is complete, we want to look at the best ways to issue lil 3D nouns NFTs out to the community to create more value and interoperability. We will be having this conversation together.\n\n## SCOPE OF THE PROJECT\n\nIn order to build a 3D Lil Nouns web application, we need:\n\n**1.** All Lil Nouns assets recreated in 3D. The scale of Lil Nouns is different from Nouns, so unfortunately we are unable to use the models from 3D Nouns and will need to remodel them:\n\n-  236 heads\n-  136 accessories\n-  24 glasses\n-  Additional new asset traits for the lower body (following existing color palettes)\n-  Approx. 60 pants\n-  Approx. 60 shoes\n\n**2.** The body will be scaled down to fit the new proportions and we will need to rig and bind each head to the animation individually.\n\n**3.** Different 3D background environments for the 3D Lil Nouns generator. We will let the community steer this with us. \n\n**4.** All 3D assets will need to be rigged and animated to supply the “walk”, “run”, “jump”, and “dance” animation. These animations then need to be loaded into the GLTF models and exported individually into GLTF models for the web application to consume. \n\n**5.** We will include a feature to auto-select traits based on your lil noun by lil noun ID which will help everyone onboard the app.  \n\n**6.** And finally it will all be wrapped up in a 3D web application that consumes and loads over 1GB of model files dynamically. The application will efficiently render complex 3D scenes across multiple devices and screen sizes all while maintaining high frame rate (60fps+ on desktop and 30fps+ on mobile with minimal lagging. \nThe frontend will be built using a combination of two popular javascript libraries: React and three.js. The interface will look similar to [3dnouns.com](https://3Dnouns.com) (although we want to improve on it), and will consist of a home screen, 3D world environments, asset selection menus, model download capabilities, and a profile picture studio for taking screenshots of the scene. The application will be hosted on vercel and will be available at [https://3Dlilnouns.com](https://3Dlilnouns.com), which has already been purchased.\nDevelopment will also include cross-browser compatibility testing, mobile/desktop responsiveness, library maintenance, and website metric tools for checking website performance page load speed, responsiveness, stability, etc. If necessary, scaling for increased site traffic.\n\n\n## PROJECT TIMELINE\n\nBased on the work completed for 3D Nouns, we estimate development will take around 12 weeks. Asset development will take place in tandem with the web application creation. Progress will be updated and demonstrated to the community over the course of the project, in approximately 3 week intervals, and open to anyone interested. \n\n## WHO IS BUILDING THIS\n\nThis application will be built by the same team that built 3D Nouns - **Coral Orca** and **0xFloyd**. Feel free to reach out to us on Twitter, DMs always open. \n\n- **Coral Orca** [https://twitter.com/coralorca](https://twitter.com/coralorca) \nCoral Orca is the creator behind 3D Nouns and is responsible for all assets, animations, level design, and general look and feel of the application as well as  marketing and business development. He has been active in the nouns community since june 2021 as its first builder, and has contributed to the project via collaborations with SharkDAO, published AR filters that were used by VaynerNFT and Budlight, and is also a founding member of the Nouncil. 3D Nouns Figurines collectors include Deeze, Benito from RTFKT, and Bharat Krymo to cite a few.\n\n- **0xFloyd** [https://twitter.com/0xFloyd](https://twitter.com/0xFloyd)\n0xFloyd will be responsible for development of the web application. 0xFloyd is a full time software engineer working in Web3. Floyd has been a part of the Nouns community since Day 1, and has worked on numerous projects in the Nouns ecosystem. Along with building [3Dnouns.com](https://3Dnouns.com) with Coral Orca for NounsDAO Proposal 2, 0xFloyd was the frontend engineer for NounsDAO Proposal 3, [Nouns Party](https://nouns.party), and helped make significant contributions to the [Nounify app](https://nounify.wtf) with [12bnoun](https://twitter.com/12bnoun) and nounder [lastpunk9999](https://twitter.com/lastpunk9999).\n\n\n## COMPENSATION\n\nWe are asking for a total of 42 ETH to be transferred in one full payment upon successful proposal vote. Compensation was determined based on the level of effort required for 3D Nouns, and the lessons learned / reuse of previous work that we can apply to 3D Lil Nouns.\n\nAs a comparison, compensation for 3D Nouns was 32 eth (~$125,709 USD on 9/6/21). As we believe we can reuse and improve some of the existing codebase, but will need to remodel all the assets and add a few new features, there is still significant time that is required in order to make this a solid product.  \nWe want to create value for the community,  with a unique site in line with the brand and a step up from previous work. We arrived at a fair value of somewhere between 50- 60% of the original 3D nouns proposal compensation (priced in US Dollars). Additionally, the price of ethereum has been extremely volatile over the last 45 days, fluctuating between $900 and $1800, so it is difficult to predict if this volatility will continue and to put a “fair value” on the price of ETH by the end of this proposal.\n\n- 41 ETH for asset modeling and V1 of the web application as detailed in the scope of the project section\n\n- 1 ETH for 2 years of application maintenance. Subsequent years of maintenance and future improvements/features to come in separate proposals.\n\nThank you for reading this proposal! ![We love this community](https://jiji-studio.com/assets/nounsHeart.gif)\n",

      "content": "Merchandise Proposal - Inception\n\nGoal\nThe Nounish Agency proposes to create merchandise for the lil nouns to be presented to the community during Art Basel in Miami 2022. The merchandise consists of hats, t-shirts, hoodies, sweatpants and stickers.\n\nAbout Us\nThe Nounish Agency is a  team of marketing executives and event planners. Our team consists of senior software engineers, executive leaders and multifaceted administrators who have experience creating multicultural relations, sincere engagement and lasting connections. \n\nPurpose\nMerchandise has long since been something that holders look forward to collecting. At events, merchandise can be something fun and interactive that holders can do together. Merchandise will proliferate the Noun and lil noun ways because it brings visibility to the art of Nouns and starts conversations about Nouns and lil nouns Dao’s. It will also merge Web2  with web 3, bridging that gap. In doing so, Nouns would be the reason for many new people onboarding into the space. \n\nConsiderations\n“Art Basel is North America's most comprehensive international contemporary art fair with over 250 galleries from 35 countries showcasing works by more than 4,000 artists. Held annually, Art Basel Miami Beach draws thousands of art dealers, artists, collectors and aficionados to Miami.” Miamibeaches.com\nThe Merchandise will be featured at a boutique in Miami close to the Miami Beach convention center. \nThe merchandise boutique will be marketed broadly across multiple platforms for optimal visibility\nThe merchandise will be available for purchase to all \nA wide variety of merchandise from several well-known web 3 projects will also be available for purchase.\n\nExpectations/ Success Metrics:\nWe expect to sell between 300-500 units of merchandise.\nWe expect holders to be happy and satisfied with their quality merchandise.\nWe expect the Nouns and lil Nouns communities to experience an increase in visibility due to merchandise being shown off throughout the week in Miami.\n\n\nBudget Breakdown\n15 ETH \n5 Eth to team\n10 Eth to Merchandise Expenditures\n\nTeam\nBrittney @brittzbits lil noun #3418, #4065, #4049, #4013, #3695\nZack @ZackRadio lil noun #3173, #3727,#4243,#4244, #4399\nAndre @dredamonsta1 lil noun #3876, #3396\n\nProposed Transactions\n0xdf8507227323d4EeF9D9223BDF9625978aFf59d6 (15 ETH)\nTwo of the Three signers are needed to authorize Mulitsig wallet \n",

      "title": "A proposal to distribute different wearables across platforms at specific milestones in the minting cycle of Lil Nouns. By FashionVerse",
      "content": "**TL/DR:** *To get Lil Nouns a wardrobe across all metaverse and social platforms.* \n\nTo be able to Lil Nounify yourself in every medium should be our number one goal. While the below plan does involve some rarity in its distribution mechanics, the main goal is to have as many Lil Noun “wearables”; whether in Metaverse, Office meeting settings?, Tik-Tok, Snap Chat, Instagram, etc, etc. I believe this aspect DIRECTLY falls under **PROLIFERATION** tenant. \n\nHaving [FashionVerse](http://Fashionverse.io) Fashion House push out a major Collection like this will essentially blitz all socials over the next 2 Months. It will also allow us to tweak our future plans as we see how this unfolds and who steps up to participate because of this. \n\nI think the value proposition can be summed up in the article below by Zeneca_33 \n\n[Impossible Expectations](https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-29-impossible-expectations)\n\nIf you haven’t read this latest piece from Zeneca_33, it discusses a lot about how to manage, or not manage, impossible expectations. This wearable schedule is an attempt to bridge some of this expectations gap held among different participants in the NFT space. AND have some FUN while we are doing it! \n\n- A little bit of rarity for lower numbers.\n- A little bit of a thank you for support from long term HODLER / Early Minter\n\n**Deliverables:** \nThe deliverable schedule for past items is: *as finished*. 2 months seemed reasonable in conversations; however NO specific deadline was has been put in place, no rush for something that is static in time. \n(see [notion](https://www.notion.so/Wearables-b750e3cc9a11447082b7dcafea04c1ec) for full details)\n\nFuture Deliverables will be available as specific milestones are achieved. (4000/5000/6000)\n\n**Total Deliverable:** \n3D Items: 14 (Files / Insta / Snap ; w/ corresponding styles)\n6 Tik Tok Noggle Variations\n10 Sandbox Items\n2 DCL Items\n\n## What’s Good For Builders\n\nThe Files the Dao will be receiving for:\n\n**3D Design are:**\n\n1. .glb 3D file\n2. .zprj/.fbx (source file) that you can import in 3d design software like clo3d/marvelous designer\n3. PNGs of all angles\n\n**Filter files will include:**\n\n1. A link to the published filter on the social media platforms\n2. All source files: Completed filter file, all animations and 3d objects that went into creating the filter\n\n---\n\nFor the beginner, novice, and experienced designer alike; a set of building blocks will be at your disposal to continue upon.\n\nThis is not Exhaustive in any sense as far as scope or breath. Builders should not feel discouraged by products they may have been looking to build but challenged to build better. The only limiting factor to any of a wearable collection is your imagination. \n\n**These predefined buckets “MAY” help builders define collections for the DAO in the future. (or give others ideas on ways to define smaller collections)** \n\n---\n\n**Some Further Scope… WHAT’S NEXT:**\n\n- Pixel Verse Characters.  [https://webb.game/](https://webb.game/) (TBH I’m not up on all the current)\n- Full AR Heads across Instagram / SNAP / Tik Tok\n- Different AR Traits across Instagram / SNAP / Tik Tok\n- Other Noggle iterations (styles and color)\n- MORE DCL and Sandbox Wearables\n- Crypto Voxel and other Voxel work. Ex Meebits, 3D Nouns, SideNouns\n- ANY OTHER METAVERSE OR VIRTUAL WEARABLE\n\n---\n\n### Liaison and accountability\n\nI, *SQX | sqx.pcc.eth*, will take the lead on liaison and accountability. **2 ETH** will be set aside upon approval *to distribute to any Lil Nouners in this group*, with an eye toward helping design this Meta Wearable collection over the next 2 months with Fashionverse\n\n**Duties:**\n\n- Contact with the Fashionverse team in relation to decision making on items as well as continued QC control.\n- Brainstorm / fashion critique team to help flesh out best use cases for the multitude of items to flow\n\nThrough Discussions with @**Ish#5663** from [FashionVerse](https://www.thefashionverse.io/) we have set a milestone timetable and deliverable schedule upon each milestone. \n\n*Milestones in this Proposal:*\n@250 , @500, @1000, @2000, @2500, @3000, *@4000, @5000, @6000*\n\n*Bucket Tier per Lil Noun #*\n250 / 500 / 1000 / 2500 / 5000 / 10000 / 15000 / 25000 / 50000\n\n**How holders @ milestones are defined:**\n\n- At each Milestone, a snapshot will be taken of wallets holding at least 1 Lil Noun. These unique wallets will have access to the Mint function and/or receive airdrop.\n- At each new Milestone, your tier is determined by your lowest Noun held at snapshot.

      "title": "Animated Lil Nouns Introductory Educational Video",
      "content": "Summary:\nWe want to create an animated video that takes lil nouns in a three-dimensional world. Our goal build out a story to lil nouns and make them relatable while staying true to the pixelated imagery created in the original artwork. Our primary aim to educate others about lilnounsdao and illustrate how to get involved in the dao.\n\nProject Goals:\n•\tTo provide an overview of lilnounsdao (auction, discourse, grants, prop-house, on chain proposals, noun ethos, Coordinape, while also highlighting and celebrating projects that are in the lilnouns ecosystem).\n•\tTo create an engaging experience.\n•\tImprove marketing outreach by providing high-value content that furthers lil nouns mission of educating people on lil nouns. \n•\tRemove confusion of selecting which funding method is best for someone to choose given their project goals.\n•\tMake audience smile.\n\nPast Discussion:\nhttps://discord.gg/xjARUcB3tJ  channel #lilnouns-video\nhttps://discourse.lilnouns.wtf/t/proposal-for-animated-lil-noun-introductory-video/190\n\nConclusion:\nLil nouns branding has been an ongoing discussion and this proposal is a step toward delivering a brand marketing strategy built collaboratively by nounish community members in a decentralized way. This project further hones in answering the question “what is lil nouns ethos?” \n\nMethodology\n\nFirst stage: pre-production\nScript and storyboard – initial stages of the production process. Provides a better visualization and helps team members understand flow of the video as well as to improve coordination between team members.\nThere are two scripts in this project. For example, atareh.eth has scripted his narration which he will record describing the educational points we want to convey to the audience. There is also scripting of the animation sequence which is later created into a storyboard sequence of shots to assist in visualizing the final results.\nModeling Scene and Characters – Modeling complex characters where the topology assists in creating good movements for the characters. This stage will also include creation of pixel art which is later converted into to a model and then topology optimized for animation. (2-4 weeks)\nTextures and materials – Creating 2D images that are baked into the material. The largest amount of time will be in regard to materials for visual effects. (3 days to 1 week maximum for all material creation)\nRigging and Pre-animation prep: Rigging characters to optimize for performance and designed for natural movements. This can take 2 months however, it will be significantly less because most will be completed prior to going on chain with the proposal (as pre-animation steps are completed at this point and general movements defined).\n\nSecond Stage: production\nAnimation: The model has gone through the pre-animation stages. Once we have staged the scene we will be able to animate out the scene. Once we reached this point, I estimate “staging the animation of the scene” should take 1-2 weeks.\nLighting: Each scene is slightly different in regard to lighting. The scene that will take the longest to light will be scene 5. (Estimating 3 days - 1 week)\nVisual Effects (VFX) and composite: Visual effects for this project include dematerialization of lil noun and getting sucked into the computer screen, (lava) volcano erupting and fireworks. I’ve already begun completing the more complex aspects of creating these visual effects so once we bring them into the scene, it shouldn’t take longer than 1-2 weeks.\n\nThird stage: post-production\nSound effects: 1 week (or longer if we are including the suggestion to include the dao on decision for which theme song we use. If there are revisions requested by the dao then the time will extend.\nRendering: The longest portion of this task is the rendering of the visual effects which include the lil noun being sucked into the computer, and fireworks. I estimate 1 week maximum for all rendering.\nPost- render edits: This is where we collect all of the rendered shots and compile them into scenes. From here, we will edit the shots within a scene, then we will edit the scenes together. (1-2 weeks).\nReview and final adjustments: At this point there will be very little left to do. Smaller changes to audio and editing can be made. 1 week\nWe also want to reserve some flexibility with the timeline to allow for interacting with the dao. We want to provide the dao with as much creative input/interaction with the builders as we can.\n\nWe’ve begun compiling a list of assets that lilnoun1112 will be pixelating:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SbS8O0oTyYaCdO2lG6ttCk3rD6_ROyRAehqDRKG8k0M/edit#gid=0\n\nOn screen recordings needed:\nprophouse>lilnounsdao>connect\nlilnouns(dot)wtf> DAO >Submit proposal\ndiscord>lil grants> one or two sentences typed in the field saying “we started working on…etc”\ndiscourse> we can use the discourse we made for this project and record that\nlilnouns(dot)wtf> Playground\n\nCurrent Progress:\nYou can follow progress on this live by looking in the #lilnouns-video channel under projects in the lilnouns discord. We’ve blocked out scene 1 in order to show a pre video video as requested once we brought this proposal to discourse. We are currently in the animating stages for scene 1.\n\nWe’ve also typed up a script that the lil nouns will perform:\n\nList of Scenes\n\nScene 1 [introduction/LoL delegates and illustrating auction process]\nThe video begins with a lilnoun car pulling up to a lilnoun house. The lilnoun car has a bunch of nouns in it and one lil noun (lil noun pencil). The nouns are dropping off lil pencil and we follow him into the nounisouri where we meet a bunch of lil nouns who are hanging out and doing things in the nounisouri. The pencil lil noun walks into the nounisouri and starts writing about what he’s been discussing with nouns on a chalkboard while other lil nouns watch… one lil noun raises his hand to ask a question.\nMeanwhile, a panda lil noun sits at a table where he sips a coffee, we follow the panda as he hops off his chair (which is oversized for him because he is lil) and he carries his coffee over to the computer where he works. He boots up the computer and opens the browser to [lilnouns(dot)wtf]. He checks the auction and see’s a lilnoun that he loves and reacts by throwing his hands up and then touching his lilnoun face/adjusting his glasses. Shots will flip between closeup of lil noun as he puts in a bid and the computer screen showing a new counter-bid[gradually speed up the shots as the time of the auction runs out]. As the auction nears it’s end the Panda is growing more excited and nervous hoping he will win the auction. At the end of the auction where he wins and a new lil noun appears in the room magically from a bunch of small particles. The lil noun quickly glances over to look at his new lilnoun and they hug.\n\nTalking points (Narration):\n•\tEvery 15 minutes, a new lil noun is born. The auction is open and anyone can bid. Submit your bid on-chain\n•\tIf someone bids more than you before the auction ends, your ETH is refunded back to your wallet. You have the option to bid higher.\n•\tIf someone bids in the last minute, 1 minute is added to the auction time to give everyone an opportunity to send new bids\n•\tAt the end of the auction, if you have the highest bid, the lil noun is yours! Settling the auction mints a lil noun to your wallet, and begins a new auction\n\nScene 1 Summary: This demonstrates the lilnoun auction process and briefly highlights the role of a delegate.\n\nScene 2 [finding the right sort of funding for the project]\nThe Panda then stretches his legs and walks around the room [while doing a subtle dance] as he makes his way over to his work area in the nounisouri where he has three projects. [these three projects are later used to highlight the most appropriate method for submitting each respective prop] Each project is slightly different, there is a small project [science fair volcano], a medium project [tbd] and a large project [robot arm]. Panda begins tinkering with the science fair volcano [small project]. It erupts and creates a giant mess! He works some more and fixes it. He pulls out a camera and takes some photos of the volcano and then loads the photos into his computer. He enters a chat window and begins typing. While he is typing he is de-materialized into a bunch of small particles which are then sucked into the computer screen. A fellow lil noun standing nearby reacts to him being sucked in the computer screen and looks over with a quick head jerk[setting changes]. The panda then appears in a gymnasium where we that the room is full of other lil nouns who have their projects on display and are talking with other lil nouns about them/getting feedback. He carries his project over to an open booth and sets it up while he is getting prepared lil nouns come and speak to him to ask him about his project and provide feedback. The scene ends with a shot of the panda shaking hands with another lilnoun. [everything in the scene de-materializes and the panda materializes back to his seat in the nounisouri.\n\nScene 2 summary: brings up the topic that there are many ways to be funded/the art of choosing the best funding method for your project is an art.\n\nTalking points (Narration):\n•\tProjects in lilnouns DAO are bucketed into three categories depending on how much funding is needed: small, medium and large\n•\tFor small projects, you have the option to apply for prophouse funding, which runs new auctions every 2 weeks. This is usually for projects under 1-2 ETH\n•\tFor medium-sized projects, applying for small grants is the best route. Small grants can get you up to 10 ETH in funding\n•\tFor large projects that require more than 10 ETH in funding, the best route is to go on-chain.\n\nScene 3 [illustrating prop house/submitting his project for funding using pro]\nNow that the Panda has gotten feedback from other lil nouns, he is ready to submit for funding. The lil noun paces back and forth for a moment and sips his coffee. Then walks over to the computer again. He pulls up the browser window and loads up prophouse. He again is de-materialized into the computer and reappears in a new location - a room full of doorways. Each door representing a different house (lil nouns, nouns, mfers, sharks, nounjapan, nounpunks, etc.) He walks into the lil nouns prop house and as he walks through the doorway he finds himself in a room that resembles a museum. He then finds a place after being guided there by another lil noun and sets his project up for display. [sets his project down and then presses a remote control that puts a HUD around his project highlighting different features of it. Once he sets up his project, he begins looking around the museum and voting on other projects he likes. Each time he votes, a green check mark appears over his shoulder and follows him around as he looks at each project. He finally comes to the end of the museum where he approaches a ballot box. Once he reaches it, he does a lil hop and grabs the check-marks that have been floating above him while he walked through the museum and then places the check-marks into the ballot box. [fade out/in] The scene is of a stage where the ones who have one the round of prop house are being celebrated for winning. But unfortunately Panda didn’t get selected. He walks toward the exit of the museum which is a revolving door and while he pushes himself through the exit, the scene de-materializes and the panda re-materializes back in the nounisouri.\nScene 3 Summary: Shows a small project getting funding using prophouse. discusses how small projects would be best directed toward this funding method.\n\nTalking points (Narration):\n•\tIf you have a small project that doesn’t need a lot of funding, or you’re running a short pilot, you can decide to apply for prophouse funding\n•\tIn prophouse, ideas are submitted and apply for a fixed amount of ETH. Community members can vote for their favourite ideas. The number of projects that gets funded depends on the amount of ETH available for that round\n•\tFor example, if there is 10 eth total, and each successful project gets funded with 2 eth, then the top 5 vote getting proposals will automatically be funded.\nScene 4 [illustrating discourse and prepares audience for scene 5]\nThe lil noun materializes back into the nounisouri from the browser. At this point, a bunch of lil noun friends come to visit him and encourage him to keep trying after not receiving funding from the prop house round. He is relieved that they’ve been so helpful and nice and feels welcome amongst friends. They all do fancy handshakes as they huddle around. Then Island lil noun notices from the corner of his ⌐◨-◨ and see’s the medium sized project that Panda was working on. He gestures to everyone “we can try and help to fix it!” [text box pops up over his head then disappears again]. They decide they want to try and fix it but they don’t know how! “where do we start?” they ask one another [textbox over the head of one of lil nouns]. They begin to try a few ideas but no luck. Wondering what to do next, they walk over to another lil noun who is sitting reading a book {void lilnoun} and ask him to look at the project. He joins the group in collaborating on the project and after a few questions and suggestions [lil nouns interacting using body language to describe things about the project]. Then all of a sudden a light bulb appears over Panda and he knows how to fix it. He shares his idea with his lil noun friends and they all begin collaborating together to make it work. Once they’ve fixed it, they take a bunch of photos of the project and head over to the computer again where they open discourse in hope to discuss their project and get feedback once again. [Panda gets de-materialized again] and he finds himself at a round table full of other lil nouns. He explains his project to everyone who then begin clapping and standing up from the round table. [Panda de-materializes again and reappears back in the nounisouri where he excitedly shares the positive feedback with his friends].\nTalking points (Narration):\n•\tIf you don’t get funding, it’s okay! take feedback and incorporate it and continue forward\n•\tOften, other lilnouners are a great resource and can be very helpful to get you over hurdles.\n•\tDon’t be shy to seek feedback and assistance from other lilnoun members. They might give you feedback, could help unblock you on a specific task, or join your team! Team work is dreamwork\n•\tA great place to get feedback is discourse - post your idea there.\n\nScene 4 Summary: distinguishes between two options that lil nouns have to engage in discussion the dao (discord and discourse). Highlights inclusivity when working and seeking out feedback from others.\n\nScene 5 [grant scene]\nHe runs over to the table where he has paper and a pencil. He starts writing and in big letters writes proposal. He begins writing, and out the window you can see the sun starting to go down. [fadein/out with moving lil nouns all around the table where he works indicating time is moving]. Aerial shot of all lil nouns huddled over a table with blueprints and plans sprawled out on a centrally lit table/in a dimly lit room indicating they are working in the late hours of the night [fade in/out of shots with lil nouns moving in the shot between each fade and the blueprints being added to more and more over time [the scene gradually lights up brighter as the sun rises again]. They finish, and set the blueprint on an easel and all the lil nouns take a group photo next to it. They then head over to the computer where they review the checklist for a grant request and clicks request grant. Some time goes by again using fadein/out effect we’ve used throughout this scene and a popup window showing they were not approved appears on the computer screen. They were unsuccessful and have to try again.\n\nTalking points (Narration):\n•\tFor lil noun grants, you can submit a proposal in discord + discourse.\n•\tWhile prophouse is great for small projects and pilots and for individuals, small grants can help fund a pilot or small project with a team\n•\tThe small grants committee decides whether your grant will either be approved or needs a bit of restructuring to get feedback\n•\tIf you don’t get grant funding, that’s alright. Get some feedback and try again!\nScene 5 Summary: Provides an introduction into a funding option where you might apply for a grant. Highlights the grant proposal process as well as collaboration. Distinguishes between how prop house may better fund an individual working on a proposal and how grants is better equipped to fund a small team. Also will touches on the point that lil nouns can be funded in the request for a grant[the grant in the scene will have a request including lil noun].\n\nScene 6 [Transition scene: introduction into Large project]\nAt this point all the lil nouns in the nounisouri are exhausted and lying around on the couch. The lil nouns pause from the work and go outside to play on the playground. On the playground, there are lil nouns building new lil nouns to be included in auctions in the future.\nAfter the lil nouns come back into the nounisouri, the scene shows a lil noun who is sitting on the couch throws a paper airplane, another is playing paper football with another lil noun. The paper airplane flys through the air and hits panda in the head and all of a sudden, panda has an idea! He begins digging through spare parts lying around the nounisouri. He plugs the parts into the large project and it works [ the project begins lighting up ] [Over the shoulder shot of the project looking down at the lil nouns and the reflection from the lights illuminating the faces of lil nouns as they stare up at the project]. [fade out]\nTalking points (Narration):\n________________________________________\nScene 6 Summary: Demonstrates lil nouns trying again after narration just hinted at the topic. Discusses creating new lil nouns.\n•\tOn the lilnouns website, try playing around and generating new lilnouns.\n•\tThe playground gives you a chance to generate your own lilnoun (for fun) - see which traits are available, and find your favourite lilnoun head\n•\tYou can also upload your own art as a trait to see what it would look like as a lilnoun. Some time in the future, the lilnounsdao will be accepting new traits for lilnouns (just like nounsdao just did). Your art could be featured in lilnouns!\n\nScene 7 [illustrating DAO on chain]\nAll the lilnouns are huddled around the computer screen, each squishing themselves closer to the computer so that they can see. The lil noun moves his mouse to click on the DAO link in [lilnouns(dot)wtf] while his lil noun friend has hands pushing up and down on his shoulders [excitedly/gently pushing]. He clicks the link and this time all the lil nouns de-materialize into the computer and appear in a courtroom setting where a gavel lil noun is leading a discussion with a ton of lil nouns in a stadium like seating (looks maybe like a Colosseum) around a center stage. The lil nouns walk out onto the stage pulling their large project out on a wagon and wheeling it over to the gavel lil noun. They reach gavel lil noun and each shakes his hand gracefully. [A shot of the audience cheering]. The gavel lil noun raises his hands [ and the jumbo-tron behind him has the word VOTE! pop up] indicating to all the lil nouns in the stadium that it is time to vote. We start to see lil red and green signs with an X or a check mark indicating their vote appear throughout the audience. More green than red lights appear and the vote is passed and fireworks go off. The gavel smacks the podium and the vote is over. They won and they all de-materialize again into the nounisouri. One lil noun walks up to the chalkboard and writes Day 1 and underlines it. The end.\nTalking points (Narration):\n•\tFor large projects, you get to submit a prop onchain.\n•\tCurrently, you need 3 lilnouns to submit a prop onchain. This limit increases with each 1000 new lilnouns minted (i.e. when lilnouns # reaches #3000, 4 lil nouns will be required to submit a prop on chain).\n•\tThe proposal should have sufficient detail on what it is you’re trying to do, how this benefits the lilnouns DAO, how much funding you’re requesting, and the wallet address where the requested ETH should be transferred\n•\tIf this is your first time creating transactions and you need help with creating transactions for the proposal, feel free to ask someone more experienced in the DAO for help. There are many willing hands available.\n•\tWhen you’re ready to put your proposal on chain, head over to lilnouns(dot)wtf/dao and submit it\n•\t(can show the full process of going on chain)\nScene 7 Summary: Highlights how to submit proposals on chain",

      "content": "## tl;dr\n\nThis is a proposal to create a Lil Sisters Fund (just like Lil Grants) to allocate fast capital to women and non-binary builders.\n\n## Lil Sisters Fund\n\nAs part of our mission of creating an accessible on-ramp to Nouns, we propose establishing a pool of funds to encourage women and non-binary creators, devs, and artists to build with Lil Nouns. This pool of capital will be sent to a Gnosis Safe controlled by a small group of Lil Nouners and Lil Nouns DAO.\n\n***Proposed budget: 38 ETH***\n\nThe committee’s gnosis safe will require `3 of 6` Lil Nouners to sign, with Lil Nouns DAO acting as a largely symbolic owner and backup. We recommend keeping the signer group small with a team of experienced signers and then adding more as we scale up operations and the size of the pool.\n\nThe initial signers on the Safe will be:\n\n- **B** | thebeautyandthepunk has been around since 2017.

Twitter [@al409.eth ⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/7x7x7eth)\n\n### Why?\n\nWomxn can find it intimidating to join tech communities for the lack of peers, and this fund would provide a welcoming entry to many that might find it difficult to integrate themselves into web3 communities, be them artists, or builders. Womxn have also been historically “late” to tech events (building web1 and web2), so usually have not been able to amount wealth to independently launch their projects. This fund seeks to include more womxn in the building of web3, changing to a more diverse cohort of people.\n\n### Current Progress\n\nWith the support of [@al409.eth ⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/7x7x7eth) a discord channel for the Lil Sisters has been created, where we were able to find each other, connect and start planning on building. He has also created the multisig for the abovementioned community members. We are now creating a Twitter account to share our mission and updates on the project, so people can know about it and apply, and a Discourse to work on ideas and projects, just as Nouns and Lil Nouns already do.\n\n**Budget breakdown**\n\n- 20 eth to fund proposals of women and non-binary creators.\n- 12 eth for social media management and regular meeting organization. The budget is for 6 months of work.\n- 6 eth for administration services.\n\n- 20 eth is being deployed to the Lil Sisters multisig which will be used for funding proposals.\n- 18 eth will be sent to the Lil Sisters admin multisig which will be used to retroactively fund the lil sisters committee for marketing/operational costs associated with running the program.\n\n*Timeframe*\n\n- 1st week: Lil sisters’ grant proposal writing and submission on-chain.\n- 2nd week: if approved, open dialogue with women and non-binary web3 communities.\n- 3rd week: 1 eth x 5 first-round submissions with 7 days to propose.\n- 4th week:  voting and funding proposals\n\nRounds will run at the discretion of the Lil Sisters group ⌐◨-◨",

Eager creators shouldn’t have to wait days for an on-chain proposal to be passed to receive a small amount of ETH. The DAO should not have to submit a formal proposal each time it wants to quickly reward valuable contributors.\n\nLil Grants has proven effective in quickly disbursing eth to builders. 100 eth is to be held, not burnt through. but provide leeway to not have to start and stop programs.  \n\nLil Grants Pool Wallet\n0x9B1d89015F353707241a0f375770ecBdC05c2Ca9 : Gnosis Safe controlled by a small group of Lil Nouners and Lil Nouns DAO.\n\nProposed budget: 100 ETH \n\nThe aim of the pool will be to:\n\nAcknowledge past contributions to Lil Nouns through retroactive funding\nGrant funds for the development of small, one-off, or alpha version projects\nReward ongoing contributors to Lil Nouns\nSignal that retroactive funding is a viable path to build on Lil Nouns\n\nFunding Committee\nThe Lil Grants Committee will monitor the builder community, retroactively fund previous work as it comes up, and receive informal requests/applications for small project grants. The projects and amounts will be at the committee's discretion.\n\nThe committee’s gnosis safe will requires 2 of 5 Lil Nouners to sign, \n\nCurrent signers on the Safe are:\n\nLil Noun 482 (lil world)\nLil Noun 129 (lil john)\nLil Noun 317 (bflynn)\nLil Nounder Dot\nLil Nouns DAO\nLil Noun 449 (lil al409)\n\nThe committee is open for any Lil Nouners to submit suggestions for grants and contributors that they see as deserving of a reward.\n\nTemplate : https://discourse.lilnouns.wtf/t/example-lil-grants-request/137",

      "title": "Lil Grants Season 2",
      "content": "TLDR: Replicate Nouns DAOs process in allocating fast capital to DAO contributors via small/retroactive grants. - Refunding same wallet from Season 1 with 50 eth\n\n### **Intro**\n\nThe on-chain proposal process is not ideal for encouraging small, one-off, or alpha versions of projects/tooling. Eager creators shouldn’t have to wait days for an on-chain proposal to be passed to receive a small amount of ETH. The DAO should not have to submit a formal proposal each time it wants to quickly reward valuable contributors.\n\n### **Lil Grants Pool**\n\nWe propose establishing a pool of funds and Lil Nouns NFTs to encourage creators, devs, and artists to build with Lil Nouns. This pool of capital and NFTs, will be sent to a Gnosis Safe controlled by a small group of Lil Nouners and Lil Nouns DAO.\n\nProposed budget: 50 ETH and 14 Lil Nouns NFTs*\n\nThe aim of the pool will be to:\n\n1. Acknowledge past contributions to Lil Nouns through retroactive funding\n2. Grant funds for the development of small, one-off, or alpha version projects\n3. Reward ongoing contributors to Lil Nouns\n4. Signal that retroactive funding is a viable path to build on Lil Nouns\n5. Return Lil Nounder ownership back to to the community.\n- As part of this proposal design, the Lil Nounders expressed a desire to return a substantive portion of their ownership back to the community. To action this desire, they’ve recommended that every 90th Lil Noun will be sent to the Lil Grants safe to be given to community members. At the time of the proposal, this amounts to 28 Lil Nouns. Since we sent 14 Lil Nouns in season 1, this round will add an additional 14 Lil Nounders to the Lil Grants safe.\n\n### **Funding Committee**\n\nThe Lil Grants Committee will monitor the builder community, retroactively fund previous work as it comes up, and receive informal requests/applications for small project grants. The projects and amounts will be at the committee's discretion.\n\nThe committee’s gnosis safe will require `2 of 5` Lil Nouners to sign, with Lil Nouns DAO acting as a largely symbolic owner and backup. We recommend keeping the signer group small with a team of experienced signers and then add more as we scale up operations and size of the pool.\n\nThe initial signers on the Safe will be:\n\n- Lil Noun 482 (lil world)\n- Lil Noun 129 (lil john)\n- Lil Noun 317 (bflynn)\n- Lil Nounder Dot\n- Lil Nouns DAO\n- Lil Noun 449 (lil al409)\n\nThe committee is open for any Lil Nouners to submit suggestions for grants and contributors that they see as deserving of a reward.",

      "title": "atareh.eth as Chief content creator",
      "content": "## **Summary**\n\nHey all, my name is atareh. I’m a partially doxxed (face only) content creator and writer in web3. Through this proposal, my goal is lead content efforts at lilnouns as the chief content creator. This role combines content creation, strategy, planning, and execution; combining my background as a former aspiring professor, web2 technical product manager and my current role as a writer/content creator in web3.\n\nI am focusing on a 3-month chief content creator role, with the possibility to extend should the DAO find my contributions and execution worthwhile afterwards. So, who am I, what is my experience, and why is content valuable for lilnouns? \n\nLet me explain 🧵👇🏽\n\n\n## **Why does lilnouns need a chief content creator?**\n\nAt its core, any successful movement, (be it cryptocurrency, NFT project, or DAO) has a content strategy in place. Sometimes this strategy is created organically in the community (BAYC as pfps or .eth names on Twitter, both help with marketing), other times an organization has a hand in creating it. But without content, your message can’t spread and get out there. If your message can’t get out there, then people won’t hear about you, and if people don’t hear about you, you won’t grow. \n\nTo drive home my point, here’s an example: I’ve created a “cc0 Sunday” series, which goes over the news in the cc0 universe from the previous week - funded with the NounsDAO [prop.house](https://prop.house/proposal/140).\n\nIn just the second week, I had people reach out after winning a lilnouns auction, telling me they learned about the DAO through my cc0 Sunday series on YT. Content works. It’s one of the best ways to attract creatives, builders, and founders to the DAO. \n\n![Screen Shot 2022-06-13 at 12.11.58 PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/rsPk86Sw/Screen-Shot-2022-06-13-at-12-11-58-PM.png)\n\nSo, lilnouns needs someone thinking about content full-time. Right now, there is no content strategy, or one person thinking about media for the DAO. While there are small experiments being talked about, without someone thinking about the lilnouns narrative at large, the energy in the DAO might wane and slowly trickle away (especially in a bear market). In this time, we need to go on the offensive and define what lilnouns are and push a message and be a reminder that we are still here, we are still building. Having someone lead the content strategy, planning and execution for lilnouns is a great way to do it - and I think I’m your guy, here’s why. \n\n## **Proof of work: who I am + what is my experience**\n\nIn my past life, I was a molecular scientist, publishing 3 papers. Since then, I’ve founded an ed-tech startup that was used by thousands of university students, transitioned to web2 as a PM and Head of product, and after 6 years made the switch full-time to web3. I have 7+ years working in tech, mostly thinking about product. In web3, I focus on writing on [twitter](http://twitter.com/atareh), [substack](http://degenuniversity.substack.com) and content creation on [YT](https://www.youtube.com/c/DegenUniversity/videos) and podcasts.\n\nIn a content creator role, leaning on product management principles to understand what content is necessary, how to manage and delegate the execution of this across teams, and maintaining a backlog is absolutely crucial. This is where my PM background will drive value for the DAO.\n\n## **Examples of my work**\n\n- Written multiple longform threads on Twitter, like ([ex 1](https://twitter.com/atareh/status/1528126971846066176), [ex 2](https://twitter.com/atareh/status/1458858405146284033), [ex 3](https://twitter.com/atareh/status/1526636736759181313)).\n- Created [educational guides](https://degenuniversity.co/collections/frontpage) on Degen university\n- Create educational [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/DegenUniversity/videos) + podcast called “Daily Degen”\n- Create weekly videos on the happenings in the cc0 universe called “ [cc0 Sundays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZtdVCPVJq0)”\n- Write a newsletter for [Degen University](http://degenuniversity.substack.com)\n- Interviewed prominent builders like [lilnouner Bflynn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSDjk6M-RK8) (Rabbithole), and [Zeneca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMxQpMcL7cw) for the podcast\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-06-16 at 7.04.19 PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/MZCXWDxy/21.png)\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-06-16 at 7.02.39 PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/P5hxD5CJ/22.png)\n\n![Untitled](https://i.postimg.cc/PqXjXLPb/Screen-Shot-2022-06-16-at-7-31-16-PM.png)\n\n![Untitled](https://i.postimg.cc/7LtYj1mJ/24.png)\n\n## **Proof of stake: why you should trust me to run content at lilnouns**\n\nI’m a full-time degen, bull or bear market, I’m here to build learn and grow. Second, I’ve been focused on education in web3 (and more broadly, in my career. Originally, I wanted to be a university professor). Right now,  I’m building my name, career and reputation in web3. So, I have a lot at stake, I want to execute well and I think my skill set and focus are right for this role in lilnouns.\n\n## **What I will do during my tenure as Chief content creator**\n\nThere are two types of initiatives I want to tackle over the first 3 months in this role. The first are 1/1’s the other are ongoing content. My priorities will be to execute and deliver the 1/1 content based on the timeline proposed. Beyond that, I will start to tackle the content requests backlog.\n\n### **1/1 content**\n\n1/1 content is meant to be evergreen content. Once these are made (and made well), they will serve thousands of people for weeks, months and years going forward. The goal for this content is to front-load the effort and cost so that there is a long-term return. Think of it the same as you would a website update: invest in design, content, and web development and the website will serve you for years to come.\n\n1. **Educational onboarding series -** To help grow lilnouns and attract more people to the DAO and the movement, I will create a series of educational videos that gets people onboarded onto DAOs. This series will be for people that understand web3 and crypto at a beginner level but haven’t gone down the rabbithole. We’ll explain the absolute basics to be thorough (metamask, safety, interacting with web3 websites), to interacting with lilnouns, placing bids, and understanding to read proposals, and submitting their own proposals). These videos will be the first entry point to the lilnouns universe, so it’s important to leave a great impression.\n    \n    #### **Chapter breakdown**\n    \n    1. Chapter 1 - What is web3 and where do DAOs fit into it\n    2. Chapter 2 - The different kinds of DAO structures\n    3. Chapter 3 - The nouns/lilnouns DAO structure and the benefits\n    4. Chapter 4 - Getting started with web3 101: an overview of metamask, crypto exchanges, uniswap, NFTs)\n    5. Chapter 5 - Getting started with web3 102: web3 security best practices, avoiding scams\n    6. Chapter 6 - Getting started with lilnouns: how to bid (and win) an auction, how to read proposals, how to submit your own proposal\n    7. Chapter 7 - Getting involved with the DAO - how to understand and navigate lilnouns discord channels \n\n1. **cc0 culture onboarding Series -** There are two parts to being onboarded to a DAO (and broadly, web3) properly. The first is education in the technicals, which is what the first series will cover. The second (and arguably just as important) is explaining the culture and ethos of web3, DAOs, cc0, and nouns. cc0 can be unintuitive to understand and the thesis of lilnouns rests on this concept. This and other concepts, as well as historical examples of what DAOs can achieve, will be part of a second series I will produce, focused on educating everyone on the culture of the nouns ecosystem.\n    \n    #### **Chapter breakdown**\n    \n    1. Chapter 1 - The history of cc0 and why this matters\n    2. Chapter 2 - Seizing the memes of production with cc0\n    3. Chapter 3 - The power of memes + how they impact markets\n    4. Chapter 4 - The singular goal of nouns ecosystem: proliferating the meme\n    5. Chapter 5 - Who can get involved in the mission and how to do so\n    6. Chapter 6 - Nouns + DAOs: the vehicle to full-time work in web3\n\n1. **Lil Nouners initiation package -** A short one-pager notion page of everything someone new needs to know when they first win a lilnoun. From where to go to find certain information, how to get involved in proposals, and how to submit your own. This will be linked to when lilnouners win an auction and join.\n\n### **Ongoing engagements**\n\n1. Lilnouns **cc0 hour season 1 -** a weekly 1 hour podcast / video series with cc0 builders, thinkers, leaders in the space. The focus for season 1 will be to highlight builders and creatives in the lilnouns DAO. People with interesting backgrounds, rich history of creative work, and a good story to tell will have their chance to be highlighted to the lilnouns and cc0 community at large. The expected timeline to start this initiative is end of July, and so the scope includes 10 episodes total (with the possibility for follow on funding to continue the series into season 2).\n\n1. **Maintain and prioritize a content backlog -** In product management, you keep a pulse on what your customer's needs are and father feature requests in a backlog. In the same way, if the content is a product, then there will be a backlog of ideas based on the community’s needs. I will actively gather this, and prioritize this for execution. This will also serve as a database for currency content needs by the community, should anyone want to submit a proposal on-chain for content. \n\n## **Proposed compensation**\n\nI’m proposing that I am compensated $50K* paid over 3 months in USDC (via stream). This covers the work period between end of June to end of September. The first payment of the stream starts if the proposal is passed, and subsequent payments are issued 30 days after. \n\n- The equivalent of $60k `(to absorb potential volatility in ETH from time period between submission and execution)` will be sent to the lilgrants multisig wallet (operated by lilal409 and lil world), convert $50k worth of ETH to USDC, set up the stream on sablier and the remaining ETH will be sent back to the DAO.\n\n## **Contributor compensation**\n\nWith the vast talent available in lilnounsDAO (graphic, video, motion graphics, editing), efforts on helping with content should be rewarded. To encourage and compensate lilnouns that contribute towards content created in this proposal, the lil nouns small grants will be able to cover the compensation the same day the pieces are delivered. \n\nI think this is a fair rate for the following:\n\n- I have an established immediate history of executing well-made content (twitter, writing, YT videos)\n- This rate is in line (a bit lower) on an annualized basis with what I was offered for content leadership role which I turned down in February - valuation was based on my experience in PM and success with content thus far\n- I am bringing 7+ years of product management experience, part of which includes running a content-focused ed-tech startup\n- This is a full-time 3-month effort.\n\n## **Timeline**\n\nThe main outcomes can be seen per month. What’s not explicit in this calendar view is the time spent booking guests + editing the podcast in months 2 and 3. What’s shown is the release schedule. \n\n![Screen Shot 2022-06-14 at 1.20.00 PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/rpwwhZCL/t1.png)\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-06-14 at 1.20.41 PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/rmdFTdPn/t2.png)\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-06-14 at 1.20.27 PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/L8Ts3FPT/t3.png)\n\nThank you for reading and your consideration.

      "content": "# Summary \nLil Nouns have an opportunity to tackle world water issues while providing STEM education to low income youth. The MakeWater.org nonprofit developed an open source educational water purification kit that costs $10 and fits in a simple envelope. Let’s tackle this together by providing 3,000 students with kits and workshops for just 20 ETH and proliferate the Lil Noun meme by being their first connection to Web3!\n\n\n# Background\n\nMy name is Ryan Beltrán aka TriggityTron founder of MakeWater.org and for the past 6 years I've worked with thousands of students all over the world to collaboratively innovate DIY water purification. During Covid we pivoted from arduino kits to simple purification kits that could be sent in an envelope to individual students. This allowed us to grow exponentially even during tough times. MakeWater.org. is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with a mission “to empower students who want to make a difference in the world by giving them the tools and education to tackle real-world water issues collaboratively.” Using a unique blend of STEM education principles, experiential learning modules, and teamwork, Make Water prepares K-12 students to contribute knowledge and solutions that make real-world differences, and enter STEM fields as citizen scientists, innovative thinkers, and inspired change agents. \n\nLil Nouns and MakeWater.org both have an ethos for open source and innovating. A new learning module will be added to the program covering the basics of web3 and blockchain. Individual students will receive a unique MakeWater / LilNouns Collaborative POAP for participation in the Make Water program. Make Water will seek to include Nouns to the marketing materials, instructions, and packaging of its kits for Program participants. Also an educational video as well as photos will be made available to share and proliferate the Lil Noun meme! Should the community love the outcome we would be open to expanding the program collaboration in the future. \n\n# Outcomes\n- Engage 3,000 students in Make Water programming and introduction to Web3 via Lil Nouns POAP\n- Serve at least 60% students identifying in an underserved population including students of color, LMI, or female\n- Increase interest in STEM-based career/degree programs and web3 pathways\n- An educational video created for students and Lil Nouns to share in meme proliferation\n\n# Transaction Details\n- 20 ETH sent to Elequa / MakeWater.org Nonprofit via Endaoment.org (0x9D5025B327E6B863E5050141C987d988c07fd8B2) \n\n\n",

      "content": "Hey all, my name is Albert or lilal409. Through this proposal I will be able to dedicate myself to LilNouns and assume responsibility as a project manager/core contributor to the DAO. I currently contribute multiple hours a day and I spend multiple hours every evening contributing in the discord and looking for where I can contribute my efforts.\n\n# Experience:\n\nMy background out of college is in consulting and software development. My title is “Business Analyst” where I work with different insurance companies to implement a software suite called guidewire. I've been tasked with traveling to our client’s office and conducting meetings where I learned how their legacy systems operated, I demo’d the guidewire suites' out of the box functionality, and then held a variety of requirement gathering sessions for us to come up with a custom solution to tailor their business needs and build out OOTB Guidewire. I have worked on each aspect of this role from requirement gathering, translating requirements to our offshore development team, and demoing newly built functionality to the client and end users of the software, and lastly was responsible for QA testing and bug triage. \n\n- Started working as a content creator/contributor to the NounPunks community. \n- Requested to become a mod for lilnouns and have been getting involved since inception to help build value and structure for the community.\n\n# What I will do going forward:\n\n1. Discord revamp and scope redefining. - I believe we have some overlap in scope between channels and there can be confusion as to where folks should be communicating where. I’d like to help overhaul the process and build out onboarding documentation for newcomers assuming they are new to the space and new to being involved in a DAO. My goals when this is complete are to have a clearly defined scope of each channel and clearly defined processes for all aspects of communicating/collaborating/and building within the DAO. I will also continue moderating the discord on a daily basis and being available in the #ask-a-mod channel to help new users. \n\n2. Contributing to any proposals that will build value for the community. - I would like to contribute to organizing and facilitating our lilnouns townhalls alongside my fellow mods. I’d like to help enable and build our community alongside contributors who have ideas to better the DAO as a whole. The first contribution I was involved in was the creation of the first 1000 lilnouns POAP and I am continuing to work along side @souravinsights.eth @mfrs @fabioseva and any other contributors on the next phase of our lilnounspoap.com website. I would like to be involved in the Educational Video Series proposal by helping write scripts for content to help onboard new users and give them a one stop shop for everything they need to know about the DAO and how we operate/how they can get involved.\n\n3. Prop House - I would like to volunteer to lead our prophouse committee and help answer questions/guide people/teams who are looking to get their ideas up for prophouse rounds. I have been involved in prophouse since inception as NounPunks were the first nounish community that had governance abilities in the prophouse rounds. I really enjoy working with people and helping guide them to build their ideas and bring them to life.\n\n4. General QA/Requirement gathering to build/test/bug triage future functionality. This experience directly relates to my current job and it’s something I’ve always enjoyed. As we conceptualize new ideas to create value adding functionality on our website, I’d like to help in any way I can. \n\n# Funds requested:\n\n- 8 eth paid for the month of June 2022\n- 42 eth paid over ~5.7 months (July 1, 2022 through December 22, 2022) which equates to 7.36E/month\n\nRecipient:\nal409.eth address: 0x8BecD7EbF3F910090f9264DFD0Bb221Ea04af8c3\n",

      "title": "Retroactive Funding and Lil Grants Pool",
      "content": "TLDR: Replicate Nouns DAOs process in allocating fast capital to DAO contributors via small/retroactive grants. \n\n### **Intro**\n\nThe on-chain proposal process is not ideal for encouraging small, one-off, or alpha versions of projects/tooling. Eager creators shouldn’t have to wait days for an on-chain proposal to be passed to receive a small amount of ETH. The DAO should not have to submit a formal proposal each time it wants to quickly reward valuable contributors. \n\n### **Lil Grants Pool**\n\nWe propose establishing a pool of funds and Lil Nouns NFTs to encourage creators, devs, and artists to build with Lil Nouns. This pool of capital and NFTs, will be sent to a Gnosis Safe controlled by a small group of Lil Nouners and Lil Nouns DAO. \n\nProposed budget: 20 ETH and 14 Lil Nouns NFTs*\n\nThe aim of the pool will be to:\n\n1. Acknowledge past contributions to Lil Nouns through retroactive funding\n2. Grant funds for the development of small, one-off, or alpha version projects\n3. Reward ongoing contributors to Lil Nouns\n4. Signal that retroactive funding is a viable path to build on Lil Nouns\n5. Return Lil Nounder ownership back to to the community. \n\n*As part of this proposal design, the Lil Nounders expressed a desire to return a substantive portion of their ownership back to the community. To action this desire, they’ve recommended that every 90th Lil Noun will be sent to the Lil Grants safe to be given to community members. At the time of the proposal, this amounts to 14 Lil Nouns. Lill Nounders will manually send to the Lil Grants to the safe.\n\n### **Funding Committee**\n\nThe Lil Grants Committee will monitor the builder community, retroactively fund previous work as it comes up, and receive informal requests/applications for small project grants. The projects and amounts will be at the committee's discretion.\n\nThe committee’s gnosis safe will require `2 of 5` Lil Nouners to sign, with Lil Nouns DAO acting as a largely symbolic owner and backup. We recommend keeping the signer group small with a team of experienced signers and then add more as we scale up operations and size of the pool. \n\nThe initial signers on the Safe will be:\n\n- Lil Noun 482 (lil world)\n- Lil Noun 129 (lil john)\n- Lil Noun 317 (bflynn)\n- Lil Nounder Dot\n- Lil Nouns DAO\n\nThe committee is open for any Lil Nouners to submit suggestions for grants and contributors that they see as deserving of a reward.\n\n### **Who to Retro Fund Right Now**\n\nIn addition to the 20 ETH Safe, we propose the immediate funding of these contributors:\n\n- `2 ETH`  to [@SeaLaunch](https://twitter.com/SeaLaunch_) and [@andrewhong5297](https://twitter.com/andrewhong5297?lang=en) each for setting up Dune Analytics Dashboards [One](https://dune.com/sealaunch/Lil-Nouns-DAO) and [Two](https://dune.com/ilemi) respectfully.\n- `0.5 ETH` to [@biologistbrian](https://twitter.com/biologistbrian) for their work on [Lil Nouns Tracker](https://twitter.com/LilNounsTracker)\n- `0.5 ETH` to [@7x7x7eth](https://twitter.com/7x7x7eth?s=21&t=KxMqbRudizFpnDKEiYGGJA), [@subversieve](https://www.twitter.com/subversieve) and [@msg](https://twitter.com/msg) each for their work as moderators\n\nEach above contributor will also receive a Lil Noun.\n\n### **Transaction Details**\n\nThis proposal will execute the following transactions:\n\n- `20 ETH` sent to the `Retro Funding/Lil Grants Gnosis Safe` (0x9B1d89015F353707241a0f375770ecBdC05c2Ca9)\n- `2.00 ETH` sent to `sealaunch` (0x635Bed3F8b7d8C25305CEa707FF7149D6f2A61f9)\n- `2.00 ETH` sent to `andrewhong5297` (0x2Ae8c972fB2E6c00ddED8986E2dc672ED190DA06)\n- `0.5 ETH` sent to `biologistbrian` (0xcB1048aE44Bcd8533BdE98CC81187c332c737D4e)\n- `0.5 ETH` sent to `7x7x7xeth` (0x8BecD7EbF3F910090f9264DFD0Bb221Ea04af8c3)\n- `0.5 ETH` sent to `subversieve` (0x8143AaD694567424162A949c1580c91D03437858)\n- `0.5 ETH` sent to `msg` (0x174d123cE1EF00EEBF1026fbF061a7a58A928Def)\n\n### **Further Info**\n* [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/954142017556979752/977907501087469668)\n* [Temp Check](https://discord.com/channels/954142017556979752/975580862286553129/977923033660538880)",

Because of that I am proposing a purchase price of 1.8 ETH, making the bid a clear winner for that auction.\n\n\n**Why price the lil noun at 1.8 ETH?**\n1. 1.8 ETH is 3x the average winning bid under `lil noun #246`\n2. 1.8 ETH is ~2x the average winning bid 2 hours past `lil noun #246`.\n\n---\n### Additional considerations:\nSince the fat finger, lil nounders have implemented the ‘Fat Finger Warning’ which shows up anytime someone increases the bit by over 10% the previous value.\n\n\n———\n→ [Bidding](https://lilnouns.wtf/lilnoun/246)\n→ [Discussion thread](https://discord.com/channels/954142017556979752/975950353809965066)",
