Inverse Guard is a risk product. Therefore, potential users of Inverse Guard will take risk factors such as DOLA liquidity and peg stability in consideration to make the decision to trust our cover product for long coverage durations. Since INV may act as a backstop for DOLA in an unlikely scenario of extreme DOLA insolvency, INV liquidity should also be considered vital to DOLA's health.\n\nACTIONS\n1.

However, stETH is far less productive across DeFi than ETH and its holders have nowhere to borrow on their stETHs. Adding stETH to Anchor will allow holders to use it as collateral to borrow DOLA, making stETH a more productive asset and boosting Anchor TVL, DOLA borrowing demand and DAO revenue. Maintaining high DOLA-3CRV liquidity is essential to accommodate a potential increase in DOLA borrowing demand by stETH holders.",

As incentives for supplying ETH on Anchor are about to go into effect, a new DOLA staking incentive would incentivize Anchor ETH suppliers to borrow DOLA and stake on Curve, generating borrowing interest revenue to the treasury and boosting DOLA liquidity.\n\nThanks to Curve's low IL risk, Anchor DOLA borrowers face significantly lower risk when LP-ing and therefore the reward rate is reduced from the previous staking event's 625 INV to 50 INV per week.\n\nThese incentives buy us time (1 month) to finish development and execution of LP token auctions.",

      "content": "Proposal\nWith the INV-DAI Ruler pair expiring at the end of this month (12 days), I propose we allocate INV as rewards to bootstrap liquidity, which will:\n- Allow borrowing of larger amounts against their INV\n- Lower interest rates for borrowers\n\nDescription\nThe Inverse community is extremely loyal and most users have yet to sell their airdrop, but may want to borrow against their INV positions. Ruler separates itself from other lending/borrowing platforms by offering non-liquidatable loans while also not requiring a Chainlink oracle.\n\nI propose we incentivize the liquidity pools with 30 INV (~$40,000) from April 1st to April 30th. Ruler will match the 30 INV with 200 RULER (~$40,000), for a total of $80,000 in rewards over the month (4/1-4/30). The current March expiry INV pair has 200 RULER as incentives and has gathered ~$425k in liquidity. Doubling the rewards by adding INV should increase liquidity to close to $850k, enough to support large borrows.\n\nRationale\nThe value of the 80 airdropped INV is currently valued at ~$104,000. Even with a conservative mint ratio, large amounts of borrowing would drastically shift the interest rates if there is a lack of liquidity. \n\nAction\nIncentivize the Ruler INV pair from April 1st to April 30th by transferring 30 INV from the Inverse treasury to Ruler multisig (0x49B8a0893B83A171D7d461198b69A0b1bb4dd0Ed).\n\nOutcome\n30 INV + 200 RULER will be rewarded from April 1st to 30th ($80,000 in total rewards over a month).\n\nBy offering INV rewards to LPs, compounded with the use of crv.finance pools, the liquidity will be sufficiently deep enough to support large borrows/lends. This in turn means, the interest rate for borrowing will be much lower.",
