      "title": "Q1 2024 Budget Proposal",
      "content": "### **Summary**\n\nThis proposal covers Seed Club’s focus areas and expenditures for Q1 of 2024. We outline our Q1 budget, and provide a proposed plan and budget for Seed Club through July of 2024.\n\nOur goal is to provide insight for the $CLUB community into Seed Club’s operations. Once approved, Seed Club’s contributors will be responsible for executing these objectives, and returning to the community with a budget update for Q2 of 2024.\n\n### **Our 2024 Objectives**\n\nWhat started as some friends exploring social tokens together has grown into a network that has incubated and funded over 200 leading crypto projects.\n\nWe’ve tapped into a general dissatisfaction with the current state of our digital lives, and the growing belief that the participatory, permissionless, and open worlds that crypto enables may be an antidote.\n\nAt our core, we’re a place for visionary founders that are insane enough to be building in the nascent and uncertain world of “consumer crypto” and for the early adopters and investors crazy enough to support them.\n\nWe back founders building onchain products with onchain memetic distribution and an onchain business model. The ones building something people really want to be a part of and driving onchain transactions that reflect that.\n\nWe believe that building onchain today will be as impactful as building online was 20 years ago and that creating ways for builders and early adopters to participate in value creation alongside investors will help make that belief reality.\n\nOur H1 2024 Objectives are designed to help us take bold steps to further this vision.\n\n### **Q1 2024 Objectives**\n\n1. Launch and support SC07 consumer crypto companies.\n2. Grow our distribution by scaling our media and building new product experiences that drive valuable interactions.\n3. Increase the depth and connection between our existing founders and attract new founders to our network.\n\n### **#1 Objective: Launch and support SC07 consumer crypto companies.**\n\nTo continue elevating Seed Club to be the unquestionable best place to build consumer crypto companies.\n\n### **KPIs**\n\n1. Announce Seed Club’s 7th cohort and receive over 300 applications.\n2. Launch SC07 with up to 10 consumer crypto companies defining new categories.\n\n### **#2 Objective: Grow our distribution by scaling our media and driving transactions.**\n\nThe Seed Club brand is well known and recognizable in the crypto space. We want to continue compounding the credibility and value that comes with it, and that it creates for our network. We believe one critical path to this is by driving the number of onchain transactions through our own media and by amplifying curated mints from within our network.\n\n### **KPIs**\n\n1. Hire supporting media roles to\n    1. Increase our presence on decentralized social networks and Youtube.\n    2. Experiment with growth strategies to double our newsletter subscribers and twitter following.\n    3. Capture and amplify the essence of the Seed Club brand at events.\n    4. Resource a media team to tell the stories from within our network\n2. Continue amplifying Internet Explorers through new iterations on design, minting experiments and high-profile guests.\n3. Host IRL experiences at least once a quarter.\n4. Launch SpecPort, Seed Club’s first network product.\n    1. Receive over 25k sign ups.\n    2. Drive 10k transactions.\n5. Build and launch Ethereum Toy Factory (an idea minting platform) that attracts a large top of funnel of builders.\n\n### **#3 Objective: Increase the depth and connection between our existing founders and attract new founders to our network.**\n\nTo date, the only way for founders to join the Seed Club Network was through participating in an accelerator program or through receiving investment from Seed Club Ventures. Our network grows stronger through our ability to attract and serve exceptional on chain builders and aim to create new pathways for such individuals to join, contribute and get value.\n\nOur accelerator is effectively serving top founders, but there are a number of other personas that are interested in being a part of Seed Club. By directly serving these personas, we can expand our network of incredible people, leading to higher credibility, reach and deal flow.\n\n### **KPIs**\n\n1. Run up to 5 founder Circles (small groups of founders that meet monthly to share learnings).\n2. Host quarterly IRL events\n3. Execute 2x high leverage event sponsorships (Brand New / Farcon)\n\n### **Q4 2023 Actuals**\n\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w_8_L29HmfcqoGes1vJFOxJBVbS-5YBEAFvrevKi0vo/edit?usp=sharing) is a link to our Q4 actual operational spend.\n\nQ4 2023 actual spend was: $297,138\n\n### **Q1 2024 Budget**\n\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VwcTpRfcYqNZb5KiNFV_nSqK-NCAgenrEqisLkdnosA/edit?usp=sharing) is a link to our Q1 budget.\n\n### **Key Takeaways**\n\nTotal amount in treasury: $10.02M\n\nBurn: $74,850/mo, growing to $132,309 in H2 2024\n\nRunway at current burn: 6.6 years\n\n### **Implementation**\n\nA vote for this proposal will approve the outlined budget and objectives for Seed Club’s Q1, allowing the Seed Club team to drive forward the outlined objectives and to oversee the appropriate deployment of these resources.\n\n### **Vote**\n\nYes - approve and implement this budget\n\nNo - do not approve or implement this budget",

      "content": "### **Summary**\n\nSince its inaugural cohort in 2021, Seed Club has incubated 6 cohorts and >100 teams building the next generation of the internet. Last year, we launched our first Consumer Crypto focused cohort (SC06), with the deep belief that imaginative consumer crypto experiences are core to the development of our ecosystem, and the internet broadly.\n\nLast year we outlined our plans and motivations in [this proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/club.eth/proposal/0x45eb01846021c486570adad38a0bfa3075b7f4b8cc176e89b87c3f304fb8f159) for funding our first Consumer Crypto cohort. Here is a summary of how we’ve executed on our plans:\n\n- 10 canonical [consumer crypto companies](https://www.seedclub.xyz/posts/its-time-for-sc06) were supported\n- Seed Club allocated a $1,520,250 USDC of the budgeted $2.5M USDC towards SC06 teams\n- Seed Club allocated $32,958.6 USDC towards associated legal fees\n- A balance of $946,791.4 USDC remains to be distributed towards funding the Consumer Crypto Accelerator\n\nIn this proposal we outline our plans for funding the next cohort (SC07) of Seed Club’s Consumer Crypto accelerator.\n\n### **Objective: Funding SC07 projects ($1.5M)**\n\nSeed Club’s seventh batch is focused on working with the best founders and most exciting projects in consumer crypto. Specifically, projects that have onchain distribution, an onchain business model, and are strongly memetic.\n\nSeed Club DAO will be allocating $1.5M to the remaining $946,791.4 USDC ($2,446,791.4 USDC total) to distribute to SC07 teams working on audacious, novel, socially-motivated projects that are trying to make our internet dramatically more interesting. Though our target is 10 teams for this next batch, we’re requesting flexibility to accept up to 15 projects into SC07 who will receive up to $200k each.\n\n### **Implementation**\n\nIf implemented, this proposal aims to allocate $1.5M USDC from the Seed Club Treasury to the Seed Club Foundation.\n\n### **Vote**\n\nYes - Approve and implement this proposal\nNo - Do not approve this proposal",

This year, Seed Club will be taking its learnings and bringing it to the next version of our potent Accelerator; the Consumer Crypto Accelerator.\n\nThe Consumer Crypto Accelerator will be focused on finding the best founders who are building at the intersection of culture, community and crypto. Our goal as an organization is to create and incubate the canonical examples of crypto consumer products that prove the inevitability of web3.\n\nThis proposal outlines our motivations, and if passed, our plans for funding the next cohort of Accelerator participants.\n\n## **Motivations**\n\n### **Funding Accelerator DAOs & Companies**\n\nSeed Club is ready to extend the model to an ambitious broad spectrum of projects. To do this we’re now going to accept companies *in addition to* DAOs for the first time.\n\nIn addition to our expanded aperture, we’re also going to invest capital into these projects or companies. Early stage consumer crypto startups are finding it difficult to raise money amidst the current market uncertainty. We believe providing capital to these projects is necessary for us to attract the best talent, and allow teams to focus on building rather than fundraising.\n\n## **Implementation**\n\nIf implemented, this proposal aims to allocate $2.5M USDC from the Seed Club Treasury to the Seed Club Foundation, which will distribute USD or USDC to accepted projects or companies.\n\nThe distribution of the allocated 2.5M will take place in two phases:\n\n- **Phase 1 [Q2 2023]:** Aimed at working with a broad subset of teams that demonstrate the types of ideas and founders that are a great fit for the Consumer Crypto Accelerator.\n    - Up to $200k will be allocated to teams accepted into the accelerator.\n    - Valuations will be determined on an ad-hoc basis.\n- **Phase 2 [Q3 & Q4 2023]:** Aimed at exploring additional, sustainable funding structures and vehicles in consultation with legal counsel.\n    - Funds will be allocated to a minimum of 5 teams with additional funding options from:\n        - A Seed Club Fund\n        - A Seed Club Syndicate\n        - Partnerships with other Funds from the Seed Club Network\n\n## **Management**\n\n### **How does value flow back to the Seed Club Treasury and to $CLUB holders?**\n\nIn case of a liquidity event, any capital returns will be allocated back to the Seed Club Treasury, which is governed by $CLUB holders.\n\nAll proceeds are ultimately used for the progression of the Seed Club DAO. It's important to note that $CLUB holders will *not* be beneficiaries of the holdings, i.e. $CLUB holders have no rights or claims against the portfolio, nor will receive any distributions of equity or proceeds from any disposals.\n\n### **Who will be overseeing and managing the portfolio?**\n\nThe core day-to-day management will be led by Jess Sloss & Josh Cornelius, supported by\n\n3-5 other members of the community with notable experience in growing and backing consumer projects or companies.\n\nEach deal will be negotiated with accepted teams on a case-to-case basis.\n\n### **How can $CLUB holders impact, approve or veto investment decisions?**\n\nWhile we’ve previously experimented with how the community can select projects, we’ve ultimately realized that there is a high correlation between the experience and time spent working directly with founders, and the ability to select them.\n\nFor the Consumer Crypto Accelerator, we’ll be delegating selection to the small team working closely with the project/company founders, and managing the portfolio. We are committed to evolving our selection process along the way to continue backing the best consumer crypto projects and companies on the internet.\n\n### **How does this impact the existing Seed Club portfolio?**\n\nSeed Club will honor the existing agreements (token swaps) it entered with the current portfolio (SC01-SC05).\n\n## **Vote**\n\nYes - Approve and implement this proposal\n\nNo - Do not approve this proposal",

      "title": "H1 Budget Proposal",
      "content": "## **Summary**\n\nThis proposal covers Seed Club’s focus areas and expenditures for H1of 2023. We outline our Q1 spend, and provide a proposed plan and budget for Seed Club through Q2.\n\nOur goal is to provide insight for the $CLUB community into Seed Club’s operations. Once approved, Seed Club’s contributors will be responsible for executing these objectives and returning to the community with a proposal for H2 of 2023.\n\n## **Our 2023 Objective**\n\nSince our inaugural cohort in 2021, we’ve accelerated close to 100 teams building incredible internet native organizations – or DAOs. Starting Q2, Seed Club will be taking its learnings and bringing it to the next version of our potent Accelerator; the Consumer Crypto Accelerator.\n\nThe Consumer Crypto Accelerator will be focused on finding the best founders who are building at the intersection of culture, community and crypto.\n\nOur goal as an organization is to create and incubate the canonical examples of crypto consumer products that prove the inevitability of web3.\n\n## **Q1 & Q2 Objectives**\n\n1. Launch the Consumer Crypto Accelerator by Seed Club.\n2. Relentlessly support our builders\n3. Champion our category and it’s builders through media.\n\n### **#1 Objective: Launch the Consumer Crypto Accelerator**\n\nWe realize that incredible consumer products and experiences are key to web3 adoption, and are a critical component for the establishment of sustainable web3 business models. We are looking for the best founders building examples of this, and know that offering capital is an important part of attracting and supporting the best talent.\n\nWe also understand that some of the best builders won’t always be building with a DAO-first approach. Seed Club is ready to extend the Accelerator to a more ambitious and broad spectrum of projects. To do this we’re now going to accept companies *in addition to* DAOs for the first time.\n\nWe still deeply believe that community-owned networks are the future of the internet, but we’ve realized that it’s often counterproductive to be one from Day 0.\n\n### **KPIs**\n\n1. Complete the restructuring and launch of the Seed Club Accelerator offering.\n2. Run a cycle of our new accelerator offering focused on attracting the absolute top-tier builders in web3 consumers.\n\n### **#2 Objective: Relentlessly support our builders**\n\nThe highest leverage thing we can do in pursuit of creating the canonical examples of consumer crypto projects is relentlessly supporting our top portfolio founders.\n\n### **KPIs**\n\n1. Continue monthly/ad hoc check-ins and async support with top founders\n2. Grow our investor network in support of project fundraising needs\n3. Expand our circles program to a group of external founders\n\n### **#3 Objective: Champion the category**\n\nBe a champion for web3 and crypto, and the incredible builders in our network.\n\n### **KPIs**\n\n1. Publish content (on and off chain)\n2. Launch our first collectible collection\n3. Partnerships\n\n## **Q1 2023 Actuals**\n\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Na0PLJLo61q8VFGT0M48s9IfVFtPoPWjW-DHJDsijok/edit?usp=sharing) is a link to our Q1 actuals.\n\nQ1 2023 actual spend: **$396,938**\n\n- **Media: Operational Spend (January)**\n    - $30,000 spent includes strategic media consultancy.\n\n## **Q2 2023 Budget**\n\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DeFzYCxoGk4-Ru5Gtjy6evBQBs4TMQLfhJ0egpAhZT0/edit?usp=sharing) is a link to our Q2 budget.\n\nQ2 2023 projected spend: **$409,142**\n\n- **Community: Travel & Events (April)**\n    - $77,000 spend includes FWB Fest sponsorship. We’re presenting a side stage and will host the SC06 Demo day live at FWB Fest.\n- **Community: Overhead (April & May)**\n    - $30,000 spend includes the marketing and promotions associated with a series of NFT drops and marketing initiatives in support of Seed Club's brand building and the Consumer Crypto Accelerator launch.\n\n## **Key takeaways**\n\n2022 H1 actual spend: **$1,105,203**\n\n2023 H1 [Q1 (actual) & Q2 (projected) spend]: **$806,080**\n\nDecrease in spend between H1 2022 → H1 2023: **27%**\n\nRunway at current monthly burn: **8.6 years**\n\n## **Implementation**\n\nA vote for this proposal will approve the outlined budget and objectives for Seed Club’s Q2 allowing the SC core team to drive forward the outlined objectives and to oversee the appropriate deployment of these resources.\n\n## **Vote**\n\nYes - Approve and implement this budget\n\nNo - Do not approve this budget",

      "title": "Q4 Focuses & Budget",
      "content": "### Summary\n\nSince our genesis cohort in October 2020, Seed Club has emerged as the category defining internet native accelerator. This proposal outlines Objectives and proposed budget for Q4 2022 to continue strengthening our position as the leading network for DAO builders and operators\n\nThis inaugural quarterly community proposal summarizes our Q4 2022 projected budgets and focus areas for Seed Club’s four working groups: Accelerator, Community, Media, and Product. This proposal offers insight to the $CLUB community into Seed Club’s operations and an opportunity to provide feedback on the proposed direction.\n\nThe themes below were developed collaboratively by our steward team and working groups. Once approved, the working groups will be responsible for executing these quarterly objectives, providing updates on progress, and returning to the community with a proposal for Q1 2023.\n\nThank you for collectively progressing Seed Club’s mission: to build a future where internet native orgs are the most powerful communities on the planet. Where people, not platforms, capture the value created online.\n\n### Global Focus & 2022 Goal\n\nOur global focus is to make joining the Seed Club Network irresistible to builders and operators of internet native organizations.\n\nOur 2022 goal is to equip 20 communities to successfully launch a Community Token that Seed Club shares in the ownership of.\n\nIt’s important to note that market conditions have changed since initially setting this goal and it’s unlikely we’ll hit this target. Inline with our core value of “Building for the long term” we are committed to supporting our alumni communities to launch tokens with launch dates that best reflect the values and priorities of their individual communities.\n\n### Strategic Pillars\n\nThe strategic pillars guiding the growth of the Seed Club Network are:\n\n- Membership: High-impact builders view participation in the network as exceptionally valuable.\n- Resources: The network retains, grows, and effectively deploys the value it creates.\n- Distribution: We proliferate an authoritative brand and build growing distribution channels leveraged by the network.\n- Ownership: Value creators are rewarded with ownership and the network shares ownership in member organizations.\n\n### Q4 Themes\n\nWe propose the following Q4 themes aligned with our strategic pillars:\n\n- Expand Membership\n- Scale Distribution\n- Improve Builder Support\n\nThese themes are operationalized through specific objectives and metrics that live within each working group. The Seed Club working groups are the following:\n\n- Product\n- Media\n- Community, which includes Accelerator and Cultivation\n\nEach working group is made up of contributors, and supported by a Steward. Key objectives and the responsible working group are outlined below.\n\n### Theme #1: Expand Membership\n\n**What is it?**\n\nImprove and expand the specific pathways and containers for high impact members to join, create value and realize value from the Seed Club network\n\n**Why is it important?**\n\nHaving an expansive network of high-impact members is critical to propagating the Seed Club meme and sustaining a high-value network.\n\n**What will success look like?**\n\nWe have evergreen pathways for individual builders and project teams to apply to Seed Club, level up web3 mindset and accelerate the pace and success of their project development.\n\n**Key Objectives**\n\n- Prepare systems, timeline and process for SC06 intake and selection to launch in 2022 Q1. (Accelerator)\n- 300+ projects submit SC06 interest and V2 of the selection portal is ready to deploy. (Product)\n- Launch first 6-week Greenhouse cohort with 30 members curated from alumni communities. Greenhouse is a pre-accelerator program designed for early stage individual builders and operators to expand DAO-focused skills and experience. (Community)\n\n### Theme #2: Scale Distribution\n\nWhat is it?\n\nMeaningfully increase the number of people our brand reaches by leveraging existing channels and launching new ones.\n\n**Why is it important?**\n\nEnabling members to leverage our distribution to increase their visibility, impact and authority is a core value proposition of our network.\n\n**What will success look like?**\n\nOur existing media channels will continue to grow through publishing authoritative and engaging content and through increased exposure through earned media. Our member onboarding will be updated moving away from discord and towards a more purposeful, higher touch process. A development and GTM strategy for a new stand alone publication will be ready to execute.\n\n**Key Objectives**\n\n- Instigate a stand alone media brand and publication with a robust go-to-market strategy ready to execute for Q1 2023 (Media)\n- Deepen Media’s impact through publishing and distributing high quality content at a consistent cadence across all 4 of Media’s workstreams (Media)\n- The media team is empowered to publish and distribute high quality content through Club Press. (Product)\n- Transform the Seed Club Discord structure to include synchronous onboarding and focused, thoughtful discussion forums. (Community)\n\n### Theme #3: Improve Builder Support\n\n**What is it?**\n\nImprove the access our builders have to critical information, services, collaborators, and each other.\n\n**Why is it important?**\n\nThe ultimate success of Seed Club is entirely dependent on the success of our member projects.\n\n**What will success look like?**\n\nFounders are consistently showing up and leveraging the network to unblock challenges and celebrate and broadcast success\n\n**Key Objectives**\n\n- Deliver Accelerator programming that empowers teams to advocate and build independently. (Accelerator)\n- 40% of alumni are using the alumni network weekly and have growing satisfaction with support from the network. (Product)\n- Increase frequency and depth of engagements with 30 alumni teams. (Community)\n- Expand alumni engagement and contribution opportunities (Community).\n- 5+ projects are minting on Club Launch at demo day. (Product)\n\n### Q4 Budget\n\nTo accomplish the above, we’re requesting the linked budget from the Seed Club Treasury, [detailed here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JWFobU0F9inQroay33sS37BjDHBNrjHKCKrd-6O54Os/edit#gid=633553291).\n\n### Implementation\n\nA vote for this proposal will approve the outlined budget and objectives for Seed Club’s Q4, and will approve the working groups, under the guidance of the stewards, to drive forward these objectives and to oversee the appropriate deployment of these resources.",

      "content": "**Authors**: benjacobs.eth\n\n**Implementation Lead**: benjacobs.eth\n\n**Summary**:\n\nThe Seed Club Foundation was established as a legal entity to support the Seed Club ecosystem, including making grants, holding off-chain assets, and entering into legal agreements. The creation of the Foundation required ~$75,000 USD to set up and there are ongoing financial obligations and expenses to maintain its legal standing. This proposal would grant 250,000 USDC from Seed Club DAO to the Seed Club Foundation in order to pay these existing liabilities while also providing USDC to pay future expenses.\n\n**Motivation**:\n\n- Seed Club Foundation has outstanding liabilities to its legal counsel and other service providers.\n- Ongoing and future expenses (payment to Directors, compliance, etc) should be paid directly by the Foundation.\n- The 250,000 USDC grant is going towards Seed Club Foundation which was created to support Seed Club DAO. This capital will be used to further support the DAO’s mission.\n\n**Implementation**:\n\nIf the vote were to pass, the Seed Club DAO multi-sig would send 250,000 USDC to the Seed Club Foundation’s multi-sig. All payments pertaining to the Seed Club Foundation would come from the Foundation’s wallet.\n",

A CoC clearly communicates to members (new, existing, prospective) the behaviors that are, and are not acceptable as a community member at Seed Club. It communicates the level of responsibility community members have when showing – both individually and to each other. A CoC also serves an important function for community safety - should someone violate the code, there is a pathway to report that violation and clear next steps to enforce the code.\n\nAt Seed Club, we take the safety and well being of our community members seriously. Our expectation is that while we are here, together, we have a responsibility to act with the highest level of integrity, awareness, and in true collaboration.\n\nA code of conduct will allow for Seed Club’s health, continued collaboration, and safety for all members.\n\n**Approach/Specification**\n**Implementation**: June 10th, 2022\n\n**Objectives**:\n\n1. Community members know where to go to find our Code of Conduct.\n2. Community members know how to report a violation of our Code of Conduct.\n\n**Steps We’ll Take**:\n\n1. Publish the Code of Conduct on our Gitbook.\n2. Communicate the Code implementation and Committee members to the Community.\n3. Open up submissions for the Violation Report Form.\n4. Set up Discord channels and regular meetings with the Community Committee to review reports.\n\n**Additional Detail/Data**:\n\n[Link to the final draft of Seed Club’s Community Code of Conduct for review](https://seedclub.notion.site/Seed-Club-Code-of-Conduct-DRAFT-221d93de50974a5ca2ed69c11d423e31).\n\nCommunity Committee members and processes to be shifted and adjusted on an as needed basis with consensus of the existing Committee.\n\n**Resources needed**: N/A\n\n**Implementation Team**:\n\n- Pandy - Community Steward @ Seed Club\n- Nicole - Co-Creator @ Seed Club\n- Danny - Studio Producer @ Seed Club\n- Merna - Accelerator @ Seed Club",

It is also clear that these needs are best met by the person(s) who identified them and are in best service to the community if acted upon swiftly.\n\nThis proposal seeks to further empower $CLUB holders to help build and define the Seed Club community and provide these members with support and tools to create community-facing events as they feel called, through funding and a framework.\n\nAdditionally, through greater community participation in event generation, this proposal would:\n\n- Enable the Seed Club community to host a broader, more diverse palate of events\n- Enable more geographic range in Seed Club’s IRL event offering\n- Enable broader access to Seed Club community events\n\nThis proposal defines a ‘community-led, community-facing event’ as an event produced by a Seed Club $CLUB holder that is intended to serve the broader Seed Club community. This proposal applies to IRL events only. Envisioned events are small in nature and can be produced nimbly on a limited budget with meaningful impact to the community – intimate gatherings, happenings, satellite events, mixers, meet-ups, etc.\n\nA broader definition of ‘event’ was considered, as was who could apply for funding. After further consideration, however, it feels prudent in the first use case, for the scope of application to be limited. The impact $CLUB holders make on the community through intentional, pointed engagement is already evident. We believe the model this proposal puts forth will only further amplify and streamline this impact.\n\nWe propose that a community-led event (CLE) allowance is issued quarterly.\n\n- This budget would remain separate from the Seed Club quarterly events budget.\n- The CLE budget will be managed by the implementation team of this proposal + 1-2 Seed Club stewards from the community team.\n- The budget team will be reassessed quarterly.\n\nApplications will be reviewed by members of the implementation team, 1-2 stewards, and 1-2 $CLUB holders not applying for funding in the current quarter. The applications team will be reassessed quarterly.\n\nApplications will be accepted on a rolling basis and funds will be granted until the quarterly budget has been drawn down. Up to 1000 USDC will be granted per event for event use in addition to 100 $CLUB to the event applicant(s) for their keeping or to be disseminated to promote the attendance of ‘special guest(s)’ as desired and as indicated in the event application. Priority will be given to early and first-time applicants vs repeats. Repeat applicants/projects will not be granted funding in consecutive quarters unless there are no other projects competing for funding at the time of application.\n\nOnce funding is granted to an applicant/community member, the community member will use their sole discretion to manage funds and organize the event. It will be assumed that funding will be used as it was proposed. Documentation of process and spending will be expected from the event and from the applicant/community member. Documentation of process and spending will aid in record keeping but also in helping to determine budgetary need in future quarters.\n\nWhile we believe in the possibility of this proposal, we also appreciate how it could fail. Lack of success would be an inability to allocate funds in a diverse or equitable manner. Alternatively, we could find that the Seed Club community is not benefited from IRL events as we have projected or that the events primarily serve the same population. Additionally, there is concern that funding will be mishandled.\n\nEvent Examples/Wishlist\n\n- Beach Party in Miami\n- BBQ in Austin\n- Gallery Event in Brooklyn\n- Dinner Party in Vancouver\n- Etc.\n\n**Approach/Specification**\n\nTarget Implementation Date: July 1, 2022\n\n**Objectives/Steps We’ll Take**:\n\n- Allocate $5,000 to Q3 community-led events budget\n- Confirm Q3 CLE budget/applications team\n- Put application in place for community members to draw down on funds\n- Open application to community\n- Develop use case\n- Document use case\n- Repeat\n- Use use case documentation to begin to build Q4 budget proposal\n- Consider whether any updates need to be made to process, application and/or definition of event/applicant in anticipation of Q4\n\n**Resources needed**:\n\n- Confirmation of $5,000 allocation\n- Admin access to Utopia or alternative for implementation team\n\n**Implementation Team**:\n\nImplementation + Budget Management Team\n- Sarah B\n- Support from community team\n\n**Application Development Team**\n- Sarah B\n- Lawson\n- Nicole\n\n**Q3 CLE Application Review Team**\n- Sarah B\n- TBD",

In return, the strategic partners will receive 1 million $CLUB tokens to participate in Seed Club.\n\nMotivation:\n\nSeed Club is on a mission to aggregate the highest quality talent network in web3, in order to launch and accelerate world-changing web3 communities. This proposal enables us to strengthen commitments with existing collaborators and onboard a new group of world-class investors and builders into the Seed Club community. These strategic partners will propel Seed Club and its projects forward by providing mentorship, connections, and hands-on implementation.\n\nThe onboarding of these partners to our community will involve a financial contribution as an on-chain commitment to Seed Club’s future. The 15 million USDC contributed by the new partners will be used by Seed Club Foundation to thoughtfully grow the ecosystem. This may include compensation for existing and new contributors, strategic grants and new initiatives which further drive growth. Most importantly, the USDC commitment will diversify the overall treasury, ensuring long-term sustainability of Seed Club.\n\nSpecification:\n\nStewards and contributors of Seed Club have identified these strategic partners as important contributors to Seed Club. The strategic partners have agreed to terms drafted by Seed Club’s legal counsel. The terms require both a capital and participation commitment.\n \nStrategic partners receiving $CLUB have agreed to a 3-year vesting period with a 12 month cliff in order to ensure that Seed Club and the strategic partners are long-term aligned.\n\nOnce USDC is contributed by the strategic partners to that same Seed Club Foundation wallet, $CLUB will be placed in vesting contracts for the strategic partners, in accordance with the vesting schedule\n\nThe Strategic Partners invited to formally join Seed Club are as follows:\nUnion Square Ventures\nThe Chernin Group\nPlaceholder Ventures\nCollab + Currency\nBlockchain Capital\nFramework Ventures\nIDEO CoLab Ventures\nDistributed Global\nKindred Ventures\nNascent\nMulticoin Capital\nThe LAO\nRoad Capital\nHutt Capital\nAngelDAO\n10 individual participants\n\nVote:\n\nYes - Approve the distribution of 1 million $CLUB as per this proposal\nNo - Do not approve\n\n",

      "content": "Authors: Nicole @enicole#6926, Steph @crpytohun3y, Austin @Austin Robey#1021, Jeff @Jeff | JUMP#1838\n\nImplementation Lead: Nicole @enicole#6926\n\nImplementation Team: Nicole @enicole#6926, Austin @Austin Robey#1021, Ben @Ben Jacobs#5525\n\n## Summary\n\nFormation of a Continuity Working Group to:\n\n-Deepen network-wide and project-specific support, resource sharing, and programming to accelerator alumni projects.\n-Provide continued support for alumni projects toward successful token launch and DAO sustainability.\n-Sustain and deepen connections and contributions to the other populations within Seed Club’s ecosystem, specifically current cohort and studio projects, as well as other alumni projects and the Seed Club DAO itself.\n\nIntended Outcomes:\n\nWith this proposal, the Continuity Working Group will:\n\n-Ensure that the majority of Accelerator and Studio projects launch tokens successfully and sustainably in accordance with project roadmaps.\n-Support continued project success and development, especially as alumni projects enter advanced stages with advanced needs (legal/HR, treasury diversification, governance models, community sustainability, etc.).\n-Deepen and sustain engagement between alumni projects and Seed Club community, and between alumni projects across Studio and cohorts.\n-Provide opportunities for leaders and contributors from alumni projects to support ongoing cohorts and Seed Club success through deeper Collaborator roles.\n-Build and deploy models for inter-DAO collaborations and streamline governance participation between Seed Club and alumni communities.\n-Provide regular points of contact with all alumni projects, through multiple modes of communication.\n\n## Justification\n\nAs Seed Club continues to run and graduate cohorts, it is also in the process of creating great value through the growing alumni network of past cohort participants. In fact, it is this rapidly expanding network where the core strength of Seed Club lies. A robust alumni network with shared ownership in Seed Club will result in a vibrant ecosystem for DAO members and accelerator participants to tap into to solve problems and unlock value\n\nThese projects have advanced through early stages of DAO and token development, and are now digging into the real work of building, growing and sustaining tokenized communities. These alumni projects, and the network they create as a whole, are one of, if not the, most valuable resource of Seed Club’s work.\n\nAdditionally, this network of projects are fast establishing themselves as the shapers and cultivators of web3 DAOs. The ability to sustain an open learning cycle, where their experience can be documented and shared with other nascent communities, will be beneficial to the entire Seed Club community, alumni, current projects and future participants.\n\nWithin Seed Club’s current structure, alumni projects are not supported sufficiently, and this valuable network is not sustained at a level to ensure long-term success. The Continuity Working Group (CWG), and the creation of a dedicated Continuity Cultivator role, will provide the advanced stage support and connections that sustain Alumni projects, while also connecting them to opportunities to provide value to the next generation of the Seed Club community.\n\nThe CWG will provide multiple points of engagement and opportunities for contribution, in order to connect with Alumni projects at their various stages of development and focus. Through these points of contact, Alumni projects will have multiple opportunities for contributing value back to the Seed Club ecosystem, and to receive support tailored to their unique stage. As token holders in each other’s DAOs and aligned incentives, alumni projects with active, launched tokens and Seed Club will also have a clear, coordinated process to participate in key decisions. Ultimately this will result in a network of strong bonds between Seed Club and a growing number of successful alumni projects, as well as between the growing circle of Collaborators.\n\nThe creation of this Continuity Working Group will establish the final crucial piece of the Seed Club interdependent community, where projects continue past their time in the Accelerator toward sustainable discovery and success, navigating the big questions of web3 within a supportive community of learners and builders.\n\nFor - what are the reasons to vote for this?\n\nYou believe that this model will result in both successful and streamlined token launches by Seed Club alumni projects, as well as building out a codetermined network that supports alumni projects, sustains their connections with Seed Club and engages them as collaborators in this network.\n\nAgainst - what are the reasons to vote against this?\n\nYou don’t believe this model is the correct approach to support alumni success and connections.\nYou don’t believe that the balance of priorities is correct between project support, collaborator engagement and dao to dao connections.\nYou don’t agree with the budget or resource structure.",

      "title": "SP06 - Reverse Escrow Voting",
      "content": "Authors: Coopatroopah, Joshcrnls \nImplementation Lead: Josh\n\nSummary: \nAllow vesting tokens to be used for voting in governance at reduced power to ensure core team members are able to meaningfully participate.\n\nAbstract:\nAs it stands today, the only $CLUB tokens eligible for Seed Club governance (i.e. unvested) are those distributed through the CLUBdrop, DAO 20 Awards and to past projects. This amounts to roughly ~5% of the total supply. $CLUB tokens allocated to the core team and early contributors are currently ineligible for governance as they are currently subject to a six month cliff with a three year vest. \n\nTraditional voting solutions, for example via Snapshot and Mirror, do not recognize vested tokens as eligible to cast votes. This proposal looks to implement governance mechanics that allows core contributors and early contributors with vesting tokens to participate in votes, albeit with their weight limited to ensure DAO governance is community-controlled from the outset. \n\nMotivations: \nWhile the Seed Club community should always drive governance votes, the inability for many key collaborators and core team contributors to participate in voting at all prevents some of the most engaged and informed community members from having any formal voice in the governance process in these pivotal early days. Some DAOs have chosen to go the opposite direction, where early contributors and core team members can vote with their vesting tokens and thus effectively have complete control over governance from Day 1.\n\nWe aim to strike a balance between these two models.\n\nThe Gearbox team recently introduced a novel approach that offers a middle ground. Reverse Voting Escrow is a process whereby holders of vesting tokens are allowed to participate in governance, but with their voting weight reduced using a multiplier applied to their token balances.\n\nIf implemented, this new governance model will increase voter participation by allowing for more members of the Seed Club community, including those who have been members from the DAOs early development, to have a direct say in future proposals and developments from the DAO.\n\nThis proposal marks a first attempt at ensuring all parties in the Seed Club community have a meaningful and balanced voice in governance.\nThere is a likelihood the exact weighting may change, and this proposal should be seen as a first attempt to incorporate vested tokens with escrowed voting weight in Seed Club governance.\n\nMore details here: https://forum.seedclub.xyz/t/scip-01-reverse-escrow-voting/48\n\nVote\nYes - Adjust $CLUB governance \nNo - Do not adjust.\n",

      "title": "SCP03 -- Seed Club Ventures Proposal",
      "content": "Seed Club Ventures\n\nSeed Club is launching Seed Club Ventures (SCV), a $20M+ early-stage fund structured as an investment club investing in companies & DAOs building the infrastructure and technology for DAOs and social token creators. SCV will pledge 10% of its returns (50% of GP Carry) to Seed Club’s treasury.\n\nSCV will leverage Seed Club’s leading position in the ecosystem to support and add value to projects in its portfolio, thereby accelerating the growth of this emerging space, and delivering on Seed Club’s strategy and objectives. SCV has already made investments in projects including Agora Space/Guild.xyz, Metalink, DiamondDAO, Coordinape, CabinDAO, Monument, MetaStreet, and Myco.\n\nSCV is oversubscribed and currently has capital commitments of over $25M. Institutional investors include Multicoin Capital, Delphi Digital, Distributed Global, Collab Currency, Dragonfly Capital, IDEO CoLab Ventures, ID Theory, Lemniscap, Numeus.xyz, Hypersphere Digital, and Mechanism Capital. Individual investors include Bored Elon, Gordon Gould, Tyler Reynolds, Robert Zawiasa (Guild.xyz Space), Ben Lakoff, Darren Lau, Daryl Lau, Jaynti Kanani, and Dan Elitzer. \n\nSCV will operate as a Venture DAO. Membership will be limited and curated to ensure the highest quality deal flow, deal due diligence, and support of portfolio projects.\n\nOrganization\nSCV is a Cayman Islands investment club/fund. SCV will operate a 2/20% fee structure. The 2% operational fee will be allocated towards compensation for Core Contributors, structuring and legal fees, and maintenance.\n\nIncentive Alignment\n- SCV and Seed Club DAO will align incentives through the following mechanism:\n- SCV will pledge 10% of its returns (50% of GP Carry) to Seed Club DAO’s treasury\n- Full-time SCV Core Contributors will be compensated with USDC and a % of GP Carry\n- Full-time SCV Core Contributors will receive a $CLUB token bonus based on SCV returns \n\nThis mechanism will ensure that Seed Club DAO’s existing Investors, SCV’s full-time Core Contributors, and SCV Members will all participate in the upside of both Seed Club and SCV and therefore be incentivised to promote the growth of both organisations.\n\nSCV Contributors\nSCV will be led by a Core Contributor Team:\nInstigator — responsible for fundraising, investor relations, managing strategy, community, and portfolio\nNiMA Asgari previously set up the first Community Fund of Funds at NEAR ($30M AUM, $100K-2M ticket size) and is an angel investor in over 10 Web3 community and infrastructure projects\nFacilitator — responsible for deal sourcing, investing, and community operations\nAnthony Avedissian has over 5 years’ investment banking and consulting experience at firms including Amber Capital ($2B AUM), Oxford Science Innovation ($1B AUM), Outsized Ventures ($100M AUM), Neo Kuma Ventures ($20M AUM)\n\nSCV Core Contributor Bonus\nRetroactive Token Distribution\n- Instigator: 15K $CLUB\n- Facilitator: 7.5K $CLUB\n\n$CLUB Bonus\n- Instigator: 150K $CLUB \n- Facilitator: 75K of $CLUB \n\n20% of Core Contributor $CLUB bonus will be distributed to Core Contributors on a monthly basis and vested over 4 years with no cliff. 50% of the remainder will be unlocked if SCV returns profits to Seed Club DAO above a 2x hurdle rate on its funds under management and the other 50% if the ROI is above 4x. \n\nLiquidity & Distribution\nSCV’s assets and profits will be distributed either: \n- In 10 years, at fund closure\n- Sooner than 10 years, based on a unanimous vote to liquidate all assets and wind SCV down \n- Ad-hoc, based on a supermajority vote supported by SCV’s preferred shareholders (Jess Sloss and NiMA Ashgari)\n\nA few notes on logistics, fees, admin, token comp, etc: \n\n- All USDC/stablecoin salaries, fees, etc are covered by the management/operational fees of the fund and no further funding beyond the $CLUB bonus is needed from the DAO\n- $CLUB bonus requested in this proposal will be only distributed to the full time core team of the fund\n\nThe expenses will entirely be paid from SCV’s operational fees.\n\nVote\nYes — Agree to accept SCV Fund launch\nNo — Refusal to accept SCV Fund launch\n",

      "title": "SCP02 -- Compensation Framework For Contributors",
      "content": "Summary\n\nThe Core Contributor team has been evaluating how to recognize work and, in turn, compensation for various stakeholders within the Seed Club DAO. SCP02 aims to outline a path to onboard new Core Contributors and to compensate community + collaborator commitment to the DAO via Working Groups & part-time work.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe proposal is designed to create additional leverage for the Core Contributor team by onboarding a Producer whose role is primarily dedicated to the DAO’s Studio offering. The compensation package for the Producer is reflective of what other Core Contributors would receive if they were offered a position on the DAO Core team.\n\nAdditionally, the DAO has identified several opportunities for part-time work within the DAO. Compensating Working Group participants and part-time community members empowers the DAO to lean on domain expertise of its Collaborator network while also engaging talented members of the community. Including members of Seed Club outside of the Core Contributor team will afford the DAO to accomplish its ambitious goals at an accelerated rate.\n\nSpecification\n\nProducer\nCompensation:\n- USDC: 8,000 per month\n- CLUB: 2,000 per month\n- $CLUB compensation will not be subject to a cliff. USDC and $CLUB compensation is subject to change at the voting discretion of the DAO\nCompensation will commence upon approval of the proposal thereafter following a monthly cadence\n\n\nContributors & Collaborators\n\nContributor and Collaborator participation should be considered part-time, ad-hoc, and on an as needed basis. Work from these two stakeholders is immensely additive to the DAO and should be recognized through compensation.\n\nThere are two structures by which Contributors and Collaborators can be compensated for their efforts: part-time effort and working group participation.\n\nPart-time Contributors\n\nThese are community members who have been identified as highly skilled and capable members of the DAO. \nThese Contributors often have other jobs/obligations but are committed to providing 10-20 hours a week to Seed Club.\nOn a monthly basis, part-time contributors will be budgeted the following\n- 2,500 USDC\n\nAt the end of each month part-time contributors can choose from two options for compensation. The amount of CLUB disbursed would be determined at noon PST on the last day of the month in advance of treasury distributions.\n- 100% USDC & 0% CLUB\n- 50% USDC & 50% CLUB\n- For example, CLUB price on Oct 31st = $25 USD then the following would be sent to part-time contributor: 1,250 USDC & 50 CLUB\n\nAfter three months of working at the current compensation structure, part-time contributors are eligible to receive a budgeted contribution of 4,000 USDC/mo. The same distribution terms apply. Various contributors have been identified to commence part-time work for the DAO and their work will commence when the Core team identifies a need.\n\nCollaborators\n\nCollaborator recognition through compensation will be reviewed on a monthly basis. Token allocation in the form of CLUB or USDC for working group participation or project advisory is subject to the review of the Core team. Distributions will be made monthly.\n\n\nImportant Notes\n\n- Compensation will be revisited for all stakeholders once CLUB token is launched. A future proposal will detail terms of compensation, vesting schedule, cliffs, etc once CLUB is publicly available.\n- A forecasted monthly budget and actuals is under development as more stakeholders are earning compensation.\n- The compensation framework above is enacted going forward for all new core contributors and part-time contributors until a future proposal is enacted. This grants the Core team flexibility to hire and compensate DAO contributors at the above compensation package until a new proposal is passed.\n\nVote\n\nYes - Accept compensation framework for DAO Contributors\nNo - Reject compensation framework for DAO Contributors\n\n",
