      "title": "AIP-466: Proposal To Close Non-Essential Working Groups",
      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\nThis proposal suggests the following:\n1. Dissolve the Governance Working Group: AIP-239: Working Group Guidelines & The Governance Working Group Charter.\n2. Dissolve the Marketing & Communications Working Group: AIP-246: Working Group Charter - Marketing & Communications.\n3. Dissolve the Metaverse Working Group: AIP-245: Working Group Charter - Metaverse.\n4. Dissolve the Web3 Development Working Group: AIP-376: Working Group Charter - Web3 Development.\n\nThe DAO created these working groups, and the DAO is well within its actions, activities, and purview to close them as per [AIP-239: Working Group Guidelines & The Governance Working Group Charter](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-239-working-group-guidelines-the-governance-working-group-charter/11462).\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeiczfdgqe2epgllwz66b2gntu6ncaa5vzikpfnqcaici47fxewuf5m)\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nCollectively, all four working groups are costing or will cost the DAO almost **$3M per year**.\n\nTo date, the new Working Groups have been largely ineffective in their mandate.\n\nAs per the Q1/24 financial reports which we all knew would be bad (and we have yet to see Q2 & Q3), it is clear that the treasury is fast running out of **disposable funds**. [Ape Foundation Transparency Report - 2024 - Q1](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/ape-foundation-transparency-report-2024-q1/25720). We the DAO need to stop the financial bleeding and to take necessary steps to preserve the treasury and reposition it for prosperity.\n\nThis proposal has the following vital benefits:\n\n1. The DAO immediately saves money.\n2. The DAO can re-purpose LESS funds to hire/contract experienced third-parties who have a lot more experience in the specific areas previously outlined in this WG charter.\n3. The DAO no longer has to deal with the distractions, funding, and down time associated with elections as well as the budget proposals and voting for these working groups.\n4. The Ape Foundation can focus on specific mandates which are beneficial to the smooth operation of the DAO.\n5. The Ape Foundation can hire and contract third-party teams//providers on an as-needed basis. This also provides the flexibility of being able to switch teams/providers if they fail to perform as expected or if they don’t perform as per their mandated KPIs, OKRs or if they don’t adhere to strict transparency and accountability guidelines.\n\n### OVERALL COST\n*Total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $0*\n\nRequests of the APE Foundation:\n\n- Dissolve the aforementioned working groups.\n- Pay in full, to affected stewards, any/all amounts that are in arrears.\n- Wind-down of the operations of any/all activities and entities.\n- Prevent the DAO from creating any new DAO funded working groups [under the existing charters].\n- Additionally, at its discretion, the Ape Foundation would put up RFPs for activities and work which were previously required to be performed by the aforementioned working group. As per the RFP, hire third-party teams which would be directed to handle all activities previously performed by this WG.\n- Manage and co-ordinate the consulting and hiring of any third-parties selected by the RFP to perform the required roles with specific KPIs and OKRs which are to be shared with the DAO community.\n- As needed, display a new Discourse category called “Job Description” related to either a work for hire request or an RFP so that the DAO community can have the opportunity to participate in such hiring opportunities.\n\n### PROPOSAL\nLink to the full proposal: (https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-466-proposal-to-close-non-essential-working-groups/24526)\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",

      "title": " AIP-524: ApeLance on ApeChain : WEB 3.0 Bridge (Resubmission)",
      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\nApeLance is set to transform the freelance landscape by offering a secure, transparent, and efficient platform powered by ApeChain. By ensuring instant payments, confidentiality, and a robust verification system, ApeLance provides a reliable and innovative solution for freelancers and clients worldwide.\n\n> **Problem:** All platforms use third-party payment systems. Traditional freelance platforms charge high fees (up to 40%) and delay payments, which can be a big problem for freelancers.\nIf these payment systems are not available in a particular country, freelancers can face difficulties, including the risk of not receiving their payments. Even when these systems do work, they often charge very high fees. In Asian regions, many freelancers do gig work on the side, and their earnings are typically low. For example, if I complete a $50 job and have to pay a $10 fee, it feels unfair to me.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiflqk6e6glaepaiknhcd5o2u6rmhk3vq2bp63tucfzbrjtrer7cmu)\n\n> **The Solution: ApeLance**\nPayments in ApeCoin are instant and transparent, significantly reducing the risk of non-payment or delayed payment. Smart contracts hold funds in escrow and release them upon the completion of predefined milestones, ensuring that both parties fulfill their obligations.Payment delays can disrupt the cash flow for freelancers.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiegny2ckkixlaagjhmrfb2l4bduoaky6ovvwozg3cknqo4ojbl5pu)\n\n \n![b964c4877c398cd2d1d12ebf3c391097c47a37ff.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeih7a5yvzqbppm5b57snmrtep3q5jdxbmjojfo4hyi4qc3al27eu5y)\n    \n\n**Bidding System**\n\nSometimes, employers may not know how to manage their projects or who to hire. In such cases, they can simply post their project on Apelance. People who have the skills and knowledge to complete the job can then submit their own bids, including the price and the time needed to finish the work. This is a unique feature not found on any other freelance platform. Additionally, by setting a budget, clients can quickly find the right person for the job from a wide range of options. \n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeihsxlzruv26g7reilsvh4nw4oypk2665l6tgufv4uixvqxeleuu3u)\n    \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidl3gxs4a7sjq3ycfyuj6kyxdb3u3iznffu7ks7yfstsjze2d757y)\n\n**Most lowes fee platform of this industry! and more…**\n\n_0.5% marketplace fee will be charged if paying and receiving payments using ApeCoin. 1% fee will be charged if payment is made in other coins._\n\n- New User Acquisition: By targeting freelancers and clients globally, ApeLance will attract new users to the ApeCoin ecosystem, including those who have not previously engaged with crypto. ApeLance will encourage active participation from the ApeCoin community, including developers, designers, marketers, and other freelancers, fostering a vibrant and collaborative environment. The platform will help businesses find skilled freelancers quickly and efficiently, driving economic activity within the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n- NFT Verification: The NFT verification feature will incentivize NFT holders to use and hold ApeCoin, increasing engagement within the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n- Long-Term Viability: The decentralized and transparent nature of ApeLance ensures its sustainability without reliance on a central authority, aligning with the principles of decentralization and self-sovereignty central to the ApeCoin community.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiceyeeraotegcdaahceh375w4m5xlmaiqxswxpkv4lchmdnirjbly)\n\n> The 0.1% of the market we are targeting amounts to $500 million, representing the total sales between employers and employees. We will generate revenue by taking a commission from these transactions.\n\n**Challenges in Asia**\nThe reason for focusing on Asian countries is that they are often ranked low in the freelance market because of payment issues. As I mentioned earlier, the payment systems either don’t work, or banks don’t support them. The few systems that do work charge high fees. Even though we all live on the same planet, the opportunities are different. Just think about it—there isn’t even a single McDonald’s or Starbucks in our country. That’s why I want to solve at least one problem that Asians face.\n\n![9b80b7ed170f8c2e365da298bea27e2c9da12fac.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeibkksz54cbzgyrrswnkdyepwaaqkg267sxchfmww2erwy5e3saezu)\n    \n_Our goal is to create a blockchain-based P2P freelance platform to capture 0.1% of this rapidly growing market. Unpredictable events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent isolation have demonstrated that people’s lives are not fixed. The next generation dreams of working on diverse projects from anywhere in the world rather than settling in one place._\n\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n![image](ipfs://bafkreifoxajjcursujursqi27tu5joitvj3p3difjtngyixrqi3d7hzvum)\n    \n![image](ipfs://bafybeidfzngath63vvlyeukvmb6weauzyn4gubxpk425lclboki7eagaa4)\n\nWe plan to spend 20% of commissions rewarding our most active users and 10% to support initiatives of ApeCoin DAO. Our goal for the next five years is to attract 0.1% of the market, which is estimated $2.5 million. The 20% of commissions allocated for rewarding our most active users will be distributed based on a point system. Points will be awarded for activities such as completing projects, receiving high ratings, and contributing to community discussions. These points can be redeemed for ApeCoin or used to access premium features. The 10% allocated to support ApeCoin DAO initiatives will be used to fund projects and events that align with the DAO’s goals, such as educational programs, community meetups, and development grants. Detailed criteria and application processes for these funds will be developed in collaboration with the DAO.\nAdditionally, users will receive a Job NFT Badge, and job ads and information for NFT-certified users within the Yuga Labs ecosystem will appear at the top of listings. Similarly, Mocaverse NFTs will also rank high. \n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeidhe2tkcovand6x6ssr4f2lxtqc3n577ljh2amjcwmve64k5l2ire)\n    \nRegarding the use of ApeCoin trademarks, we do not expect to maintain full ownership rights to the content or IP created as a result of the approval of our proposal. We anticipate that any content produced will be owned by the ApeCoin DAO, aligning with the principles of decentralization and community ownership.\n\n### OVERALL COST\n> Total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = **$147,000**\n\nTwo tranches of funding have been requested: Upon approval, the initial phase would require $67,000 to cover platform development and launch expenses. The second tranche, at the start of Milestone 3, would require $80,000 for marketing, monitoring, maintenance, and other miscellaneous costs.\n\n**Technical Development:**\n1. **Smart Contract Development:** $3,000\nDeveloping the smart contracts that will power the decentralized freelance marketplace, ensuring security and functionality.\n2. **Integration with ApeChain**: $4,000\nIntegrating the platform with the ApeChain blockchain, including wallet integration and transaction processing.\n3. **Security Audits:** $20,000\nConducting comprehensive security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities in the smart contracts and platform.\n4. **Blockchain Node Setup and Maintenance:** $10,000\nSetting up and maintaining the necessary blockchain nodes to support the platform’s operations.\n\n**User Interface Design:**\n5. **UX/UI Design:** $5,000\nDesigning the user interface for the platform, focusing on user experience and ease of use.\n6. **Front-End Development:** $10,000\nDeveloping the front-end of the platform, including responsive design for different devices.\n7. **Testing and Iteration:** $5,000\nConducting user testing and iterating on the design based on feedback to ensure a seamless user experience.\n\n**Deployment and Launch:**\n8. **Deployment Costs:** $10,000\nDeploying the platform on the ApeChain mainnet, including final testing and optimization.\n9. **Launch Marketing:** $50,000\nMarketing activities to promote the platform launch, including social media campaigns, influencer partnerships, and press releases.\n\n**Monitoring and Maintenance (1 year):**\n10. **Ongoing Maintenance:** $10,000\nContinuous monitoring and maintenance of the platform to ensure stability, performance, and security. This includes server costs, bug fixes, and updates.\nMiscellaneous Expenses:\n11. **Contingency Fund:** $20,000\nAllocated for unforeseen expenses and to cover any additional costs that may arise during the project. \n\n![84a2f86f874d3644329349e257d964c105565f08.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeiaxweoae6ugdtsmtamthe3zff5upobxabqtnqg6frai32zprjnqwe)\n\n\n### PROPOSAL\nLink to the full proposal: (https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-524-apelance-on-apechain-web-3-0-bridge-resubmission/26042)\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

The BAYC/YUGA-themed arcade will be exclusively native to ApeChain and powered by $APE coin. Our mission? To craft addictively fun games that are straightforward yet compelling—like the beloved “Dookie Dash.” We get it: The everyday non gamer as well as Web3 aficionados crave games that are both easy to grasp and a blast to play, and most importantly you can win a ton of dope stuff!\n\nAt launch, players will dive into mini-games designed for everyone from casual dabblers to enthusiasts. You’ll use $APE coin to snag $INSERT tokens, which are your ticket to gameplay. Like those old-school arcades, you’ll collect raffle tickets to score insane prizes. Our simple-to-play, yet addictive games are sure to draw a diverse crowd of gamers, memecoin degens, and even everyday apes.\n\nBored Arcade isn’t just fun and games; it showcases cutting-edge blockchain gaming tech, spotlighting ApeChain’s potential. This could spark further developer interest and investment in the platform. And with community engagement at its core, our chase-based prize draws, and engaging gaming will foster a dynamic community within the Ape Chain ecosystem.\n\nWith raffles and prizes, players will be rewarded daily and weekly. Prize pools will consist of $APE coin contributions and other assets, with 70% going to the winner and 30% allocated back to the platform for buy-backs, airdrops, and a portion of the proceeds going back to the APE Coin DAO.\n\nWe’re ramping up perks for BAYC holders too. They can bring their PFP avatars into the games, scoring 1.5x more $INSERT tokens and boosting their chances at raffle winnings.\n\nBored Arcade’s in-app wallet simplifies account creation and user management. This feature integrates an EVM wallet function for depositing $APE coin, exchanging it for $INSERT token, managing raffle tickets & prizes, and authorizing micropayments for in-game items while playing the games anywhere you want with your mobile. We understand the best tool is the one in your pocket so expect Bored Arcade on Apple App Store and Google Play Store.\n\nLast but not least our Mini-game Generation Engine, Bored Arcade will establish an innovative game generation engine, equipped with a set of versatile templates designed to streamline the creation of minigames targeted but not exclusively to meme coin projects\n\nThese templates enable the rapid development and deployment of new games, significantly enhancing our ability to deliver products regularly, to expand the Bored Arcade platform, and the ApeChain ecosystem.\n\nWelcome to Bored Arcade, where we play hard and degen harder!\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nBored Arcade is giving back 10% of gross revenue to the ApeCoin DAO treasury, expected to begin about three months after the initial launch.\n\n1.

INTEROPERABLE FILES**:\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of digital creation, different metaverse platforms, games, tools, and software support 3D files in various formats, each with its own specifications. This diversity often creates a barrier for creators who want to ensure their content is compatible across multiple platforms.\nDashBO addresses this challenge by handling all necessary conversions, rigging, and texturing, making avatars and other 3D content seamlessly usable across different metaverse platforms, games, tools, and software. By automating these technical processes, DashBO removes the complexity and ensures that users can focus on their creativity without worrying about technical compatibility issues.\nAs new platforms and technologies emerge, DashBO will continually update and expand its capabilities to support an even wider range of formats and specifications, ensuring that our users’ creations are future-proof.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreieum3kq77cbkbhodd5foa6fev2btik3tllvvohgt2tg6fm2nhdihi)\n\nInceptive Studio is in several different stages of talks with providers of Metaverse and 3D tools providers:\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreict57mfzx46znx6xqvwkrmwwnmbqzheom5lv2tywpfufu36cpvz5e)\n\nMost recently, Yuga Labs: Otherside [announced](https://x.com/OthersideMeta/status/1818725889875886507) that Rida and the Inceptive, along with other community builders [@bailey](https://x.com/bailey_tattoo) and [@Tropical](https://x.com/tropicalvirtual), are pre-alpha testers of the ODK powered by ApeChain.\n\n[Official Tweet](URL_PLACEHOLDER) no link in the original copy.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeieid6wyhy7ijj6xij4iyfdztq2jqddk27af6pq43jlmu2mfo7wdci)\n    \n**APECHAIN INTEGRATION**:\nIntegrating DashBO with ApeChain is crucial for enhancing user experience. Users will have the ability to use ApeCoin to purchase DashBO credits, our off-chain currency. This integration aims to facilitate a seamless experience within DashBO, enabling users to unlock new content for their avatars more efficiently.\n\n**TOKEN AUTHENTICATION**:\nToken Gating in DashBO plays a crucial role in restricting access to certain parts of the platform exclusively to NFT holders, thereby safeguarding intellectual property from unauthorized use.\nDashBO accommodates delegate wallets such as Warm and Delegate Cash, ensuring a smooth and secure user experience. Moreover, DashBO seamlessly integrates with ParaSpace and BendDAO, both leveraging Delegate Cash, ensuring compatibility and operational efficiency.\n\n**BUSINESS MODEL**:\nDashBO’s business model is designed to give Yuga 3D avatar holders (starting with BAYC, MAYC and Meebits) value at both free and premium levels, providing free content creation tools as well as additional premium tools through the purchase of DashBO credit bundles. By using ApeCoin for transactions, DashBO integrates seamlessly with the broader Ape ecosystem, adding utility and value for ApeCoin holders.\nUntil the full collections become available, DashBO will also provides access to demo avatars from popular Yuga collections such as Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC), Kodas, MoonBirds, and 10KTF Gucci Grail. Holders of these projects can utilize these demo avatars to create unique content, enhancing their creative possibilities.\nTo unlock premium content and advanced tools, users can purchase DashBO credits, which are exclusively available for purchase using ApeCoin.\n\nThe credits come in three bundles, each with specific expiry durations:\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreidgrmz6lr3egpuq4q7wihy2gxy4zfzsyz5ko22q736fw7l5rswsgi)\n    \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicpe3f4jl6tevs5fi4dlqgx46fhbp35izok3qt7pmap2cqa6usj54)\n\nDashBO will implement a revenue share model with the ApeCoin DAO. Ten percent (10%) of the gross revenue from sales will go to the ApeCoin DAO treasury , supporting the broader ApeCoin ecosystem and contributing to its growth and sustainability. Revenue distribution is planned to be done quarterly. This schedule allows for consistent financial reporting and ensures that the DAO regularly benefits from the platform’s success.\n\nAdditionally, we plan to introduce regular updates and new features, keeping the platform dynamic and continually improving the user experience. Whether you’re using free features or exploring premium content. We intend to keep the cost of premium content between 4-6 credits. This pricing strategy ensures affordability while maintaining the quality and accessibility of premium features on the platform.\n\nWe do NOT retain any ownership rights over content created using IP that is owned by the holders. Our platform is designed to respect and protect the intellectual property of all users.\n\n**PARTNERSHIPS**:\n\n- **Yuga Labs**:\n  - MAYC Models: Inceptive has been contracted by Yuga Labs to create a complete collection of “unofficial” models for MAYC (DashBO-ready).\n  - BAYC .com: Inceptive has partnered with Yuga Labs to create BAYC holders pre-release beta access to DashBo UGC platform .](BAYC. com)\n\n    \n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nIntegrating DashBO with ApeCoin will significantly promote the usage of ApeCoin, encouraging users to engage more actively with the ApeCoin ecosystem. This integration will facilitate various transactions, including the purchase of premium content, creation tools and unique assets. By increasing the utility and circulation of ApeCoin, DashBO will contribute to generating additional revenue for the ApeCoin DAO, thereby strengthening the overall ecosystem and enhancing its sustainability. DashBO will implement a Ten percent (10%) revenue share model with the DAO thus supporting the broader ApeCoin ecosystem and contributing to its growth and sustainability.\n\nMoreover, DashBO’s support of other Non Yuga projects like Mocaverse, Azuki, Pudgy Penguins, Degods, and many others will introduce more users to the ApeCoin and ApeChain ecosystems once those projects are onboarded. This expansion of users and projects within the ecosystem will further enhance the value and utility of ApeCoin, fostering a vibrant and thriving community of creators and users. Additionally, DashBO will be built on ApeChain, which means more communities will be onboarded to the ApeCoin and ApeChain ecosystems. This integration will add more demand for ApeCoin as these communities utilize the token for various transactions and interactions within the ecosystem. Additionally, the integration with ApeChain will enable seamless interoperability with other projects and tokens within the ApeCoin ecosystem, further enhancing its utility and value proposition.\n\n### OVERALL COST\n\nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $418,000 USD.\n\nThis grant will cover the development and integration costs, marketing expenses, and operational expenses associated with Launching DashBO with the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\nThe detailed budget breakdown is as follows:\n\n- **Development and Integration: $150,000 USD**\n  - Frontend Development: $30,000 USD\n  - Backend Development: $30,000 USD\n  - Unity Development: $40,000 USD\n  - Blockchain Development and Audit: $50,000 USD\n\n- **Infrastructure & Maintenance Costs: $80,000 USD**\n  - Hosting Costs: $50,000 USD\n  - Data Storage: $10,000 USD\n  - Maintenance: $20,000 USD\n\n- **Operational Expenses: $188,000 USD**\n  - Marketing and Promotion: $50,000 USD\n  - Content Creation: $90,000 USD\n  - Licenses and Subscriptions: $8,000 USD\n  - 3D Work: $40,000 USD\n\nOur main request is to receive social media support from the APE Foundation, particularly in the form of tweets at launch and periodic retweets. This will help us engage with the community effectively and drive awareness for the platform. We also request additional support from the APE Foundation for community engagement initiatives and platform enhancements, as deemed necessary by the Foundation.\n\n*Disclaimer: Due to the recent approval of AIP-436, all AIPs requesting an allocation denominated over US$250,000 will require a super majority approval of 69% of the total number of votes cast. The Foundation has already begun coordinating to develop our new Snapshot strategy to automate these new decision making guidelines, however, we will ensure compliance with this guideline manually in the interim.*\n\n*This AIP falls above that threshold and will require 69% of votes to be approved.*\n\n### PROPOSAL\nLink to the full proposal: (https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-498-dashbo-ugc-platform-democratizing-content-creation/25163/1)\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": " AIP-502: The Apemobile - Guerrilla marketing meets a KOL partnership (Resubmission)",
      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION:\n**ApeCoin needs more marketing. Period.**\nIt’s not easy to stand out and get the attention of people nowadays… so, we need guerrilla marketing.\n\n**Guerrilla marketing** is a highly effective strategy due to its ability to deliver high impact at a low cost. By leveraging the psychological impact and viral nature of unconventional tactics, it has the ability to generate significant buzz and engagement.\n\n**KOL partnerships and brand ambassadorships** are a proven model in web3 and are widely adopted by top-tier projects in this space. To date, ApeCoin does not have a single partnership of this kind.\n\nThis AIP offers a bold mix of the above mentioned :muscle:\n\nEducational content and marketing by kodama.eth - amplified by the Apemobile!\n\nAn ApeCoin branded BMW (an M3, 4, or 8 Competition).\nCustom license plate.\nApeCoin branding such as but not limited to the ApeCoin logo on the tank cap and “Powered by ApeCoin” writing.\n\nThe car will be called Apemobile and will be established as status symbol of success within the whole web3 space. Leveraged by a multi-year partnership with web3 KOL kodama.eth and the targeted use of guerilla marketing tactics in order to amplify **educational content around the DAO, ApeCoin & ApeChain.**\n\n**The car will be a tool to polarize and get attention.**\n\n**In an endless X feed you need to stand out.** You need to grab the attention and once you have it, you use it to educate and make them one of us :wink:\n\nNOTE: The Apemobile can be leveraged by the whole community. Not just kodama.\nThe pictures can be used by everyone.\n\nThe AIP author will work closely with the Marketing and Communications working group, who have the option to opt-in to particpate, to maximize the benefits of this initiative.\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM:\n\n**A multi-year partnership with kodama.eth, web3 KOL**\n\nKodama has a large, engaged following within the web3 community. Partnering with him will significantly increase the brand’s exposure and reach the crypto-native audience on an ongoing basis. He will commit to creating content, joining spaces, and attending events with the sole purpose of spreading the message of the DAO, ApeCoin & ApeChain. **EDUCATION!**\n\nBelow you will find a list of **several benefits**:\n\n**Targeted Marketing**:\n- Marketing within the web3 space is crucial for a project's success. With Kodama, ApeCoin will reach a relevant and interested audience over the course of several years.\n\n**Increased Reach and Visibility**\n- The Apemobile will polarize and guarantee people’s attention. Kodama will post at least one content piece per week, mainly from Twitter/X account [@kodama_eth](https://twitter.com/kodama_eth), and will generate millions of impressions.\n- He will drive the car daily and visit relevant crypto events/meetups all over Europe, creating additional opportunities for content creation with engaged community members.\n\n**Credibility and Trust**:\n- Kodama has established trust with his followers and has become a relevant KOL within the broader YugaLabs and ApeCoin ecosystem. Having him as a permanent partner endorsing ApeCoin can enhance the brand’s credibility and trustworthiness.\n\n**Content Creation**:\n- Kodama will post at least one content piece per week. Educational, lifestyle, or joining spaces – a broad mix that appeals to different audiences. The goal remains the same: to spread awareness and educate about ApeCoin.\n\n**Cost-Effective Marketing**:\n- Compared to traditional advertising and regular web3 KOL partnerships, this comes at a very low cost. It perfectly complements the recent F1 partnership of the DAO (which opens up many possibilities for further content creation).\n\n**Engagement and Interaction**:\n- The Apemobile will polarize! Kodama will leverage this and foster active engagement with his followers and the broader web3 community. This will lead to higher interaction rates for the campaign and increased brand visibility.\n\n**Authenticity**:\n- Kodama will share personal stories and experiences, making his endorsements feel more genuine and relatable compared to traditional ads.\n\n**Rapid Awareness and Virality**:\n- The Apemobile has the potential to go viral quickly, creating buzz around ApeCoin and ApeChain.\n\n**Diversified Marketing Strategy**:\n- Working with Kodama adds another layer to ApeCoin's marketing strategy, diversifying the current approach and helping Ape reach potential new users/buyers.\n\n**Long-Term Partnership**:\nBuilding a long-term relationship with Kodama will result in continuous exposure for the ApeCoin brand.\n\n**Why Guerilla Marketing for ApeCoin**?\n\n- Proven Concept\n- Cost Efficiency\n- Brand Differentiation\n- Psychological Impact\n- High Engagement\n- Viral Potential\n\nGuerrilla marketing is a must-do for every business aiming to maximize their marketing impact while minimizing costs. Its ability to create memorable experiences, foster strong customer connections, and differentiate your brand in a crowded market makes it an essential component of a modern marketing strategy. By leveraging the psychological impact and viral nature of unconventional tactics, it has the ability to generate significant buzz and engagement.\n\nThe Apemobile will make **ApeCoin a status symbol of success**.\n  \nSports cars have always had a special status in society and especially in crypto.\nThey are associated with success.\n\nThis is precisely why it is the perfect fit for this marketing initiative.\nOn top of that it fits perfectly into the DAO’s current marketing efforts with the F1.\n\nThe AIP author will work closely with the Marketing and Communications working group to maximize the benefits of this initiative.\n\n### OVERALL COST\n> “Total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund =USD 210,000.”\n\n170,000 USD for the car, custom license plate, and foiling\n0 USD for 3 year KOL partnership & content creation\n20,000 USD for insurance for 3 years\n20,000 USD for maintenance\n\nNOTE: Unused funds are immediately returned to the DAO.\n\n**The car will be resold after 3 years and all proceeds will go back to the DAO.**\n\n*If this is not legally feasible, then alternatives such as a charitable donation will be considered.\n\n### PROPOSAL\nLink to the full proposal: (https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-502-the-apemobile-guerrilla-marketing-meets-a-kol-partnership-resubmission/25409)\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "*Disclaimer: Due to the recent approval of AIP-436, all AIPs requesting an allocation denominated over US$250,000 will require a super majority approval of 69% of the total number of votes cast. The Foundation has already begun coordinating to develop our new Snapshot strategy to automate these new decision making guidelines, however, we will ensure compliance with this guideline manually in the interim.*\n\n*This AIP falls above that threshold and will require 69% of votes to be approved.*\n\n### Proposal Description\n\nAlright folks, this is our rebooted AIP-410 ApeCoin Goes to Hollywood —now called:\n\n**ApeCoin Gets a LOUDER Voice: The podcastization of the ApeCoin Ecosystem.**\n\nIt’s a multi-layered AIP to give the ApeCoin ecosystem a voice that reaches the world in multiple languages, improve internal DAO communication, involve ApeCoin holders, help AIP Authors, MBAs, MOCA and artists, use the DAO as a talent marketplace and bring normies and Web3 enthusiasts to ApeChain.\n\nWe want to leverage our 19 years in podcasting and 6 years in Web3.\n\n- **Why podcasts?** Because podcasts are the most direct, natural, and cost-effective way to communicate. That’s why listeners are growing worldwide nonstop.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreigadod6f23ccgmhmiw6y5lvkytnksiti4s4cnsaqgmjkvbabpyrgi)\n*Sources: Statista, Edison Research*\n    \n- **Why Web3?** Because we are true believers since 2018, when we even tried to shake up how presidential elections are held in Mexico (and the world) using Blockchain with great results and media coverage (you can read more in Dany Saadia’s bio); and we’ve come a long way since then. We even snatched up ApeCoin as soon as it was released and minted 2 BAYC (1382 and 1383).\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreib6wno6oxorhsa2ai6bfl5lftnl6wp4nagkcnhqedb7r4ypr6v7ee)\n    \nSo this is why we are resubmitting this AIP with the firm belief we are uniquely qualified to navigate this project to success. Let’s dive:\n\nFirst off, we’re talking about real podcasts, like the ones we've been producing since 2005. You can listen to an example [here](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5SGGCaBLKF82Cu8dzpLqoe?si=42bb42a465bf4b83). This means: it’s not about just giving mics to a couple of folks or recording Zoom calls. Real podcasts have a story, a script, a production, and they truly harness the power of voice. Since the dawn of time, humans have been wired to respond to voice when it comes with the right words, the right tone, and even the right musicality. Also, podcasts are notably less expensive to produce than video. We’re going to leverage all this to benefit the ApeCoin DAO—the entire ApeCoin ecosystem and all its members.\n\nDown to business: we’ll tackle the internal and external communication issues in the DAO with podcasts to be distributed on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, YouTube, et.al. Out of our own experience, the learning we got from the different Spaces and Discourse comments about the DAO and how you can really make a difference is nothing short of incredible, and massively expands what Ape_U does. However, this experience has really driven home the need to make these discussions accessible to everyone, on-demand, in their own time and time-zone. This is why we are pushing this AIP as follows:\n\n1. **Podcastizing:** edit and post-produce all ApeCoin related Spaces like Apecomms, BOTB, Bodega, Sandbox, Meet at the Clubhouse, Mocaverse and all other relevant Spaces so no one has to hang around, banana to the ear, at crazy hours. (Example: [July 6th BOTB Space](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XqHCi4yg5JZgbdNZ6LYYa?si=0a79f7020a9c4baf&nd=1&dlsi=b7eaae0fece742f1)).\n\n2. We will also produce and post-produce a **weekly chat-show podcast about ApeCoin and ApeChain news** (live AIPs, ApeChain and DAO updates, testnests, controversies, F1, etc) with key players as guests, all hosted by two DAO members (to be chosen).\n\n3. For **all willing ApeCoin DAO AIP Authors, we’re gonna podcastize your AIP drafts, just like we are doing with this AIP** (listen to it [here](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2hGon9FYaSAjk12gUTCeqy?si=3e4f875fa2c54213&nd=1&dlsi=7ff67936b3e147be)), and we recently did with all Special Council candidates (Listen [here](https://open.spotify.com/show/2TXDNfaWDURb5f4hqPulWI?si=c3ec9fd0e8694ac6&nd=1&dlsi=0b5e58d172a34e84)). This will be done in English, our common language.\n\n4. For all willing MBAs and BAYC & MOCA artists we will produce a 20- to 30-minute podcast about their project, because we know there is an entrepreneurial and enlightening story behind every MBA and artist that deserves to be told and heard.\n\n    - Also, we will produce a 30-second audio ad for all willing MBAs and MOCA artists to promote their product or services that will be baked-in on all podcasts published by this AIP for free. (As long as they follow DAOs guidelines).\n\n5. Then, to increase and amplify **ApeCoin’s visibility** in the normie world, we will write, produce, post-produce and distribute to all major platforms, **TWO “ApeCoin Originals” in three key languages for global distribution: English, Spanish, and French.**\n\n    - **Why in English?** For obvious reasons: it’s the current global lingua franca and where the real monetization market for podcasts lies (the US).\n\n    - **Why in Spanish?** Because there are over 500 million native speakers across 21 countries on 3 continents, and it’s largely an untapped market for ApeCoin.\n\n    - **And in French?** Well, add another 27 countries with about 75 million natives and 200 million more who speak it as an official language, nearly as neglected.\n\nWe’re talking about 700 million potential listeners, plus English worldwide speakers, who would be hearing “This is an ApeCoin Original” and “Powered by ApeCoin” for the first time and many many more times.\n\n**What are the two “ApeCoin Originals”?**\n\n1. **A flagship podcast:** a **documentary** on the saga of Yuga and BAYC, Cryptopunks, ApeCoin, and Animoca Brands. Why? To follow the trend of those podcasts that jumped to VOD platforms (like WeCrashed, Gaslit, The Dropout, etc.) These narratives not only captured the attention of mainstream audiences but also turned complex business sagas into cultural phenomena that captivates millions.\n\n    - This flagship podcast aims to do something similar with the story and synergies between Yuga, Animoca Brands, The Sandbox, ApeCoin, all the way to ApeChain. We want to introduce the general public to the universe of Web3 and our DAOs, demystifying it with an accessible and attractive narrative about how these technologies work and their impact on various aspects of culture and the economy.\n\n    - And above all, we want to **control the narrative**. Controlling the narrative is essential to educate and capture the attention of a skeptical or simply unknowledgeable audiences about what blockchain and the NFT market really involves. We are not just looking to tell a story, but also to establish a clear frame of reference so that the audience understands and appreciates the complexity and beauty of what we are doing. It’s about captivating both who are already believers in Web3 and the normies who still do not know or remain reluctantly on the sidelines. [FOR A SHORT SYNOPSIS CLICK [HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/xdblonu1a1jzr7emvdnne/AIP_From_Punks_to_Apes_Yuga_Labs_Digital_Empire_and_the_Animoca_Alliance.pdf?rlkey=luqqw0fdm7f78bsxlb9u4v98k&e=1&dl=0).]\n\n\n2. Speaking of making a strong entry into the normie world, “**The Frightorama Experiment**” is the **second ApeCoin Original**, a horror/psychological thriller aiming to tap the existing creative talent market within the ApeCoin, MOCA, and Sandbox DAOs — from screenwriters to directors, musicians, voice actors, recording studios, equipment rental companies, etc., through a contest. We’re not just looking to produce high-quality and easily gamifiable content that embeds “This is an ApeCoin Original” and “Powered by ApeCoin” into millions of downloads, but also to create the first DAOs collaborative production, involve all content creator members of the DAOs and gain revenue.\n\n    - To do so, we will pick scripts via a contest run in the DAO, which will be then produced with as much talent from the DAOs as possible. This contest is not just a platform to showcase the best and most original works, but a demonstration of how transparent, fair and participative all this can be. [FOR FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT “The Frightorama Experiment”, CLICK [HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/hrkyfan8w07yzyn80nkus/AIP_The_Frightorama_Experiment_Contest.pdf?rlkey=rxcbg7gbks78b3wvdvq60z24k&e=1&dl=0).]\n\nWe’re sure these 2 ApeCoin Originals can make a huge hit and reach at least a million downloads. Why?\n\n1. Because we are confident that a well-produced and researched Web3 documentary, let alone “The Frightorama Experiment”, are attractive to the wider English, Spanish and French audiences in the most popular genres:\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeidfoyilqrhevqhr4lawn6k7fn6hyn443ocydnd6th5o7r3gyewmjy)\n\n2. Because we have a lot of experience in the podcasting industry, IPs, data and platforms, which translates into massive know-how to reach audiences, and\n\n3. Because we will allocate a substantial budget for marketing and distribution to effectively promote all the necessary podcasts under this AIP.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreif6vfjv35vri6hokpjizosylcuvmsouihn3y4tciqiqbpt2hrkbty)\n\nLet’s talk about the exciting potential of the ApeCoin Originals. These projects can easily expand into TV series, films, video games, and merchandising, and also tap into the massive $4 billion dollars worldwide podcast ad-revenue market ($2 billion in the US alone!).\n\nAnd we propose a revenue structure that prioritizes the ApeCoin’s Treasury recoupment as follows:\n\n1. Treasury Recoupment Phase: 100% of gross revenue from ad-monetization of podcasts and related content will be directed back to the Treasury until the full overall cost of this AIP is recouped.\n\n2. Operational Sustainability Phase: After complete recoupment, we’ll retain 100% of subsequent revenue to ensure long-term AIP sustainability.\n\nOur strategy is designed to accelerate Treasury recoupment, secure funding for ongoing operations in subsequent years, and establish a strong position for ApeCoin in the evolving media and entertainment landscape.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreibd65ejagpmkkfoakmk37tquysng2dtvar3pgjz46sfvjmfpkun24)\n    \nIn any case, there will always be complete transparency. Downloads and revenue will be visible to all members of the DAO, as well as anything else the community considers necessary to ensure accountability.\n\nAdditionally, to sweeten this AIP even more (remember: multilayered), we also plan to tokenize these IPs and host all our podcasts on the ApeChain in order to coordinate and collaborate with **Horizen Labs** and/or coders (and Banana Bill) to develop a system that automatically generates RSS feeds from blockchain-hosted podcast content for distribution to major platforms (Spotify or Apple Podcasts) because, to our knowledge, this hasn’t been implemented in Web3.\n\nThis AIP is budgeted for **759 episodes (or one year’s podcasts as described in the budget section)**, and includes —this is key again — marketing and promotion. We’re not just creating killer podcasts; we’re making sure they get the spotlight they need. Creating standout content is only half the game. The other half is putting it in front of the right people. We’re all about maxing out our reach and visibility to draw in a wide and varied audiences in the English, Spanish and French speaking world. At the end of the day, it’s about making each episode not just entertaining or informative, but a real powerhouse that drives ApeCoin adoption, helping to carve out a unique and well-recognized spot for it in the global scene.\n\nWe expect income from all these projects to maintain and expand the operation in the future.\n\nOh, by the way: thanks to DIXO’s 19 years of experience in podcasting and 6 years in Web3, we’re a household name across Latin America and Spain. As soon as this AIP kicks off, we’ll instantly add all podcasts under this AIP to the DIXO Network, which just signed a distribution deal with Pitaya—one of the top distribution and monetization podcast networks in the US. Plus, this will give DIXO and ApeCoin access to free PR in both specialized and mainstream media.\n\nTL;DR:\na) 313 Spaces podcastized;\nb) 260 AIP Drafts podcastized;\nc) 52 MBAs + MOCA + Sandbox artists podcasts;\nd) 52 $APE Ecosystem podcasts;\ne) 52 × 30”-audio ads for MBA + MOCA artists;\nf) 1 Yuga and Animoca Brands DOCUMENTARY podcast (6 episodes) in English, Spanish and French;\ng) 1 DAO community-driven gamifiable horror/psychological thriller podcast in English, Spanish and French;\nh) Grand total: 759 “Powered by ApeCoin” podcasts available on all audio platforms (Spotify, Apple Podcast, YouTube…)\ni) …thus entering a largely untapped market of 700 million Spanish and French speakers;\nj) 100% of initial revenue from ALL ad-monetization, royalties, derivatives, ancillary income, and IP licenses under this AIP goes back to the DAO’s treasury UNTIL the overall costs of this AIP are recouped.\nk) Once the DAO’s Treasury has fully recouped its initial investment, all subsequent revenue will be reinvested to ensure the long-term self-sustainability of this AIP. This will allow us to continue promoting ApeCoin globally without requiring additional funding from the DAO…\nl) … while biting our nails to start the next decentralized content platform with Horizen Labs in ApeChain.\n\n**Please** let’s do ourselves a favor: let’s NOT miss this opportunity. It’s good for the DAOs, $ApeCoin, BAYC, MAYC, MBAs, MOCA, Sandbox, and, above all, ApeChain.\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\n**1. Marketing and Communications**\n\n- 2 different podcasts:\n\n  1. Daily (MON-SAT) ***Podcastization*** of all relevant Spaces (ENG)\n    - ***Space Podcastization*** means downloading the Space, editing internet glitches, pauses, eliminating “mmm, ahhh, errrrs”, editing content (if necessary), improving sound of each speaker, breaking the 2-3-4 hours Space into different episodes depending on the host's outline, and final mixing.\n\n  2. Weekly ApeCoin + ApeChain news podcast hosted by DAO members (ENG)  \n    - Live AIPs, follow-up on approved AIPs and bills (Banana), F1, ApeChain updates…\n\n**2. AIP Draft Authors**\n\n- 1 podcast\n    - *Podcastization* of their AIPs drafts (ENG)\n         - ***AIP Draft Podcastization*** means either a post-produced reading of AIP Abstract by AIP Author(s) or a one-on-one interview with AIP Author(s).\n\n**3. To Attract Worldwide Normies to the ApeCoin Worldwide Ecosystem**\n\n- 2 different podcasts: “An ApeCoin Original” in English, Spanish, and French\n  1. Flagship podcast documentary (BAYC + Cryptopunks + ApeCoin + Moca)\n  2. Horror/psychological thriller chosen through a contest in the DAO.  \n- Untapped and abandoned 700M Spanish and French speaking world  \n- Millions of downloads.\n\n**4. MBAs, MOCAs and Artists**\n- 1 podcast\n    - Success (and failure) stories.\n- Free 30-second audio ads baked-in ALL podcasts approved by this AIP.\n\n**5. Members of ApeCoin DAO**\n- Monetization paid in $ApeCoin to screenwriters, directors, producers, hosts, voice-overs, studio rentals, graphic designers, etc. for “The Frightorama Experiment” podcast production under this AIP.\n- Access to DIXO’s 19-year expertise in podcasting (podcast pre-production, production, post-production, distribution) either for free or at reduced prices (depending on tasks).\n\n**6. Benefits for ApeChain**\n- Hosting and distribution of audio content.\n\n**7. Benefits for the DAO Treasury**\n- 100% of initial revenue from ALL ad-monetization, royalties, derivatives, ancillary income, and IP licenses under this AIP goes back to the DAO’s treasury UNTIL the overall costs of this AIP are recouped.\n\n### OVERALL COST:\n\n**Total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $999,999.18 USD**\n\nAs you will see, the total budget is slightly over 1 million USD ($1,009,100), but we didn’t want to break the psychological barrier of one million, so we decided to ask for less than one million and absorb that small difference. Broken down as follows:\n\na) 313 Spaces podcasts × $400/ea. = $125,200 (including sound edition, postproduction and audiograms);\n\nb) 260 AIP Drafts podcasts × $1,400/ea. = $364,000 (including sound edition, sound design, dialogue edition, postproduction and audiograms);\n\nc) 52 MBAs + MOCA + Sandbox artists podcasts × $2,050/ea. = $106,600 (including sound edition, sound design, dialogue edition, postproduction, audiograms and marketing outreach);\n\nd) 52 $APE Ecosystem podcasts × $2,400/ea. = $124,800 (including sound edition, cast/host, sound design, dialogue edition, postproduction, audiograms and marketing outreach);\n\ne) 52 × 30”-audio ads for MBA + MOCA artists × $600/ea. = $31,200 (including sound edition and postproduction);\n\nf) Yuga & Animoca Brands Documentary podcast (6 episodes × 3 languages): $153,800 (including scriptwriting, trilingual production and translations, production coordination, fact-checking, cast/talent drawn from the DAO if possible, recording studio & operators, sound design and edition, dialogue edition, audiograms, and marketing outreach);\n\ng) “The Frightorama Experiment” (4 episodes × 3 languages): $103,500 (including scriptwriting, scripts contest, production coordination, cast/talent drawn from the DAO where possible, recording studio & operators, sound design and edition, dialogue edition, audiograms, and marketing outreach); \n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreif2mmgz5ylv3em5yfprjwiq5uodyifxfkp5oksvfkjmhc7jyezhym)\n\nIn fact, throughout this entire project, all of DIXO’s quotes are at cost price because we believe in ApeCoin, because we believe in this AIP and because we are going to show that we apes are much more than a crypto or an NFT: we are a real community that can be sustained by the best ethos behind Web3 and will flow over ApeChain to incorporate the whole world.\n\nFor an itemized budget for each podcast above, please see following PDFs:\n\na) 313 Spaces podcasts:\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreia2ee6i2zrjc47fwkkax2tcfbyeekejzxx3gmwklx5ndklhsfu3qy)\n\nb) 260 AIP Drafts podcasts: \n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreihpse64yc7buy3xtnecrnpjnldiic3qvqp2nktopzupn44pa4jq3q)\n\nc) 52 MBAs + MOCA + Sandbox artists podcasts:\n\n     \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidp3dsfqhe4lug2u62tmw2e7enbgzzz3so27bh6h6utanqvcep7qi)\n\nd) 52 $APE and ApeChain Ecosystem podcasts:\n     \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifcqljbnnjbt6u3gy4abzbcvxg6aqhoabrmn6hiotkiybr4b3hso4)\n     \ne) 52 × 30”-audio ads for MBA + MOCA artists:\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiazxy56bmkyahgcnkou227et3ctoymfblrlo3vqohc666lip3cm6a)\n     \nf) Yuga & Animoca Brands Documentary podcast:\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreib2tmmbjonvyppgkl3wroxkzkgkesodlmshmlaebg6wsdvb4opmey)\n\ng) “The Frightorama Experiment”:\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreib6pn34nj3ffuitdhey32i3qxsstcoeuextgokpypa426vvbpagvm)\n\n*Disclaimer: Due to the recent approval of AIP-436, all AIPs requesting an allocation denominated over US$250,000 will require a super majority approval of 69% of the total number of votes cast.

The Foundation has already begun coordinating to develop our new Snapshot strategy to automate these new decision making guidelines, however, we will ensure compliance with this guideline manually in the interim.*\n\n*This AIP falls above that threshold and will require 69% of votes to be approved.*\n\n### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\n\nThis AIP is designed to showcase the complete scope of the project, including the current build stage of https://www.ip3.cc/\n\nWith a functioning MVP landing page, we require support to accelerate the completion of the product.\n\nThe remaining outstanding items include:\n\n- Build out of the front end UI ensuring complete seamless workflow from user onboarding, through to IP sales and revenue funnels.\n- Backend contracts, although written, require implementation.\n- Backend infrastructure scaling to support system growth.\n- Team scaling for accelerated development to include an additional UI/UX designer and developers continuing through to post deployment support.\n- Contract auditing and security systems require implementation.\n\nIP3.cc allows holders to determine their own IP use for their asset, providing these licenses on an open marketplace for all consumers to be able to purchase, utilizing the IP within the agreed legal parameters. It is a much wider IP use case, providing for greater opportunity; overall increase in brand awareness through increased decentralized IP usage.\n\nFor example: I own a BAYC - I can apply multiple licenses to it allowing for people to lease the right to use the IP for advertising, physical merchandise, comic books, animations etc. Now my asset is accessible to 4 different addressable markets.\n\nThis AIP is focused on increasing the capacity of IP utility, whilst providing the legal framework and monetization structure to support it. As we support all NFT collections, this will positively affect the utility of ApeCoin also.\n\nExternal to product development, it is crucial that this AIP supports the peripheral strategic components that will ensure success:\n\n- Strategic marketing plan and execution\n- Education schedule and material to be delivered to NFT holders\n- Legal Consultation and preparation of agreements, smart contract integration\n- Maintenance and technical infrastructure support\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nIP3.cc provides a robust, scalable IP platform which is dedicated to enhancing the rights and commercialization for NFT holders.\n\nIts legal framework, backed by immutable provenance on the blockchain, will ensure that it is the first and best in class for delivering value back to holders.\n\nAs the payment currency will only be in $ApeCoin, it guarantees that the final payment settlement will always be in $ApeCoin, providing a consistent and balanced tokenomic model which contributes to the whole ecosystem.\n\nWe aim to position IP3.cc as the preferred NFT IP solution and are able to provide the following long term and consistent benefits back to the ApeCoin Ecosystem:\n\n- ApeCoin will be applied in merchandise Market for consistent and available brand awareness.\n- The platform charges 2.5% trading fees for licensing and merchandise Market.\n- All NFT IP listed on Licensing market should pay 1 ApeCoin for each listing.\n\n**Core Benefits to ApeCoin DAO:**\n\n1. 50% of fees generated will be given to ApeCoin DAO in perpetuity.\n2. Licensing fees will be paid in ApeCoin only.\n3. All trading fees within the marketplace will be paid in ApeCoin only.\n4. With IP3 Layer being accessible to all NFT collections on the Ethereum network at first, this enables for a broader adoption and utility of ApeCoin as it will be the only settlement form of payment.\n5. Fiat processing mechanism will be utilized to allow for easy onboarding of new capital with a frictionless payment system.\n\n### OVERALL COST\n\n\nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund is 781,000 ApeCoin / $469,000 USD.\n\nBudget:\n\nProduct Development - 240,000 APECOIN\n- UI/UX Design\n- Smart Contract Development\n- Front-end Developer hire\n- Back-end Developer hire\n- Product Design and Management\n- Internal security monitoring and integrity alert system\n\nMarketing - 210,000 APECOIN\n- PR and Media coverage\n- Social media campaigns\n- Joint brand collaborations and campaigns\n\nEducational Packages - 96,000 APECOIN\n- NFT IP Protection\n- IP Licensing Education\n\nLegal & Consultant - 85,000 APECOIN\n\nSecurity - 50,000 APECOIN\n- Smart Contract Audits\n- Platform Security Audits (external)\n\nMaintenance and Support - 100,000 APECOIN\n### PROPOSAL\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-481-building-the-modular-ip-layer-with-apecoin/24668\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP.

We aim to create a more balanced and representative governance. We aim to create two distinct wallets; one for the monkees and one for the Kodas and the Deeds they keep watch over.\n\nThe Ape Wallet will have 6.9 million ApeCoin delegated to it by The Ape Foundation. The vote will be controlled by BAYC (2 votes) and MAYC (1 vote) via snapshot.\n\nThe Otherside Wallet will have 6.9 million ApeCoin delegated to it and will be controlled by Koda (2 votes) and Otherdeed Expanded holders (1 vote)\n\n- _This delegation will have a one-year term starting from the date that the wallets are used to vote in any AIP. The term can be renewed if a member puts up an AIP to extend it before the term ends. However, these delegations will not be used to vote in any subsequent decisions related to them, such as renewing, extending, or ending it early._\n\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThe proposed voting adjustment aims to empower those who were intended to lead The Otherside. This change is designed to foster a fairer voting environment, promoting decisions that benefit the broader community and support the long-term health of the ecosystem. The timing is critical as we approach the launch of major initiatives like Otherside and ApeChain.\n\n### OVERALL COST\nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = No Cost\n\nThis ApeCoin would remain in the custody of the APE Foundation.\n\n\n### PROPOSAL\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-489-restoring-balance/24746\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-474: Delegated ApeCoin Community Voting Wallet",
      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\n\nThis proposal is for the creation of a 15M $APE multi-sig “Community Voting Wallet” controlled by members of the DAO community.\n\nThe purpose is for the CVW to be the voting voice of the community without the influence of whale wallets which tend to override the wishes of the community whereby whale wallets vote against the community pulse.\n\nThis mechanic will require a temp check voting period during which the “pulse” of the voting community is based on a “1 wallet = 1 vote” linear voting Snapshot recipe. The results of this voting temp check then determines how the community CVW votes on proposals.\n\nThe period of the delegated wallet will last for a period of ONE YEAR (term) from the date that the wallet is used to vote in any AIP. The term can be renewed if a member puts up an AIP to extend it before the term ends. The newly created delegation cannot be used to vote in any subsequent vote concerning its own delegation (e.g., a vote to renew, a vote to end the delegation early, etc.).\n\n**Background Overview**\n\n- Despite the size of the ApeCoin community, a few whale (1M+ $APE) wallets control the outcome of most proposals up for vote.\n\n- In fact, the majority of token holders don’t actually participate in the DAO voting system.\n\n- The voting turnout continues to decline because, as in real-life, the general consensus among voters is that they can’t be bothered because they know that their vote isn’t likely to count.\n\n- In the June 2024 period alone, the average voting turnout for all AIPs was **189** (!)\n\n- The introduction of the Horizen wallet in the voting system last October has thus far created a polarizing effect whereby, at **4.3M $APE**, it is now the 2nd largest voting wallet next to the Mocaverse (delegated by Animoca) at **6.3M $APE**. And due to the turnout of the voters, these two wallets control the outcome for **every vote** in the DAO.\n\n- The effects of whale voting wallets controlling the outcome of the DAO voting is a centralized paradigm that is outside the realms of decentralization, trust, and fairness.\n\n- Putting caps on a voting wallet isn’t the answer as that will just lead to Sybil solutions whereby that same wallet can be split into amounts below the cap, then all vote anyway.\n\n- The Ape Foundation, acting at the behest of the DAO, has an obligation to ensure that each member of the DAO has a voice, and that the voting system is fair and equitable to all.\n\nSee also: [Special Council To Propose Voting System Reform](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-471-special-council-to-propose-voting-system-reform/24543)\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThis initiative ensures that the DAO community voting, via this proposal, is fairly representative of the wishes of the community.\n\nIt can also dramatically reduce - even eliminate - the influence of whale wallets in the DAO voting system.\n\nThis community temp check Snapshot voting system is similar to the [For|Against ApeChain](https://snapshot.org/#/apecoin.eth/proposal/0xe26b5ec8c8d1d03c9ba5b4c53e8d9aa1dc38d2f4b6c44dd9c41643b11fb2b645) vote which came ahead of the final AIP vote for the selected team to build ApeChain.\n\n### OVERALL COST\nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = 0 ApeCoin\n\n### PROPOSAL\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-474-delegated-apecoin-community-voting-wallet/24629\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP.

      "content": "*Disclaimer: Due to the recent approval of AIP-436, all AIPs requesting an allocation denominated over US$250,000 will require a super majority approval of 69% of the total number of votes cast. The Foundation has already begun coordinating to develop our new Snapshot strategy to automate these new decision making guidelines, however, we will ensure compliance with this guideline manually in the interim.*\n\n*This AIP falls above that threshold and will require 69% of votes to be approved.*\n\n### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION:\n\nBored Trading Co (BTC) concept evolved as a clear need to build collaboratively with over 400+ MBAs (Made By Apes) and numerous IP brands and projects. Coordinating with multiple IP brands, especially around major conferences, is arduous. Sending products, particularly internationally, is costly and time-consuming. High-profile events are often too expensive for a single IP brand to justify.\n\nRecognizing the collective strength of the community with the launch of the MBA program, Jason co-founded BoredIn, a subcommunity supporting 200 MBAs founders building together. BoredIn focuses on spotlighting and aggregating IP brands and product media and research. Feedback from numerous IP brands & BoredIn highlighted the following major challenges:\n\n1. **Poor Visibility:** Limited visibility and awareness outside Web3. While Web3 thrives on platforms like X, web2 consumers are on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok where there has yet to be an incentivisation of customers, buyers, influencers to drive content.\n2. **Limited Resources:** Small IP brands struggle with time and money, even for essential functions like shipping, where commercial rates are 35-60% below published rates.\n3. **Distribution Challenges:** Scaling distribution for large order volumes or international shipments is challenging.\n4. **Payments Barriers:** Accepting crypto for E-commerce is challenging to set up and expensive with gas fees. Although there are some solutions for Shopify for an online store, there are no known solutions for in real life point of sale (POS) solutions which include ApeCoin and ApeChain. We plan to work with NiftyKit and other tech partners to help develop. \n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeidrp2pdyub6o7xzmuhsromxgvjbpf4uxf44knnor6ciypo4h4fwoq)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeifttz7pucdgyg7sho7q6l6bos6vnwb5tvcko5zt26v74zmpm4byqm)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeifpbxnsgssr7dt3wdj7eh5bghqikzokmwj4vguufgunsisqr3ahca)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeifhkrbcythfqhbnv32bfayw2fa7lfjn2e53qh7mjkvwx6brdktckm)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeiclhsrneaqchhtx5kzt3s3zb2774bquwfpxzog2hjusn5qwjrvh3q)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeif62sn32ldha7mwsnwk2jga2pahknwmp2u2v7bcezjq4xwsf3wiha)\n  \n![image](ipfs://bafybeihqskbaok242uvld7yrxkpwunxub2bb3nmxywg37o5a73jr4npegi)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeibjvjiff2ib3fk2bi7zieyjfp5suymrolg5qy5225fpi3fvmw23lu)\n    \n![image](ipfs://bafybeigsyvdxs3t5f3u2wvrsmetsd5vb7jwurooyunqeutgsaw4mnnl2sa)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeiffrozgxj6nmzzj4wgry6rptfqa53djj5ymxlz3awc4aofd4xjkxe)\n  \n![image](ipfs://bafybeigce2cpi2xn5omb362hjnxiybm6kkabjlpfehkkbunhtkrjn2mnsq)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeihi2e3v5tct7ocm7oezg272afu7ckakaleewy2g2bdy4trax7kvqa)\n                                   \n**Bored Trading Co’s Strategy**\n\nBored Trading Co is dedicated to addressing key challenges in scaling IP products to the masses by creating a consumer flywheel. We believe in a collective approach to help the entire ecosystem overcome challenges. Our mission is to deliver value back to the ApeCoin and ApeChain ecosystems, fostering innovation and growth within the community. We aim to create IP products with ApeCoin holders, expanding the IP ecosystem. With Web3 IP products still in their infancy, many brands need support to scale, particularly in garnering visibility and driving smaller brands. Leveraging our logistics expertise, including @NFThoarder888’s experience as the Head of America’s Logistics at Bloomberg where he was responsible for thousands of events and conferences. In web3, we’ve supported numerous IP brands at major events (e.g. HK Apefest and Dubai Token) and collaborated on curated IP boxes (e.g. F*ck It Saturday and @WelcomeApes MBA box). Our journey includes expanding to communities like Pudgies, Mocaverse, 10KT, Azuki, and many more to empower and grow the entire ecosystem.\n\nE-commerce presents a clear opportunity for ApeCoin to drive utility to the masses given current spending and growth projections. Bored Trading Co aims to harness the collective IP ecosystem to drive awareness, interest, and consideration from D2C consumers and B2B buyers. Bored Trading Co’s strategy includes a multi-pronged approach:\n\n- **Event Targeting**: Participating in events with a booth to create direct engagement. Attend conventions and tradeshows to dive brand awareness for ApeCoin, ApeChain, and IP brands.\n\n- **Curated Box/Bag Solutions**: Offering flexible, ApeCoin Powered curated products to customers and influencers to increase brand visibility. Incentivize collaboration between brands and ApeCoin to enhance the ApeCoin ecosystem development and culture. The bundling of several IP products together and centralization of fulfillment allows for higher conversion since the shipping cost does not create an imbalance to the customer value proposition. In web2 the higher dollar per transaction allows for promotions with free shopping or % off when you spend over a certain amount. The lower cost structure will provide custoers with more value at a lower price. We can curate multiple boxes like snack , gifting, or seasonal boxes.\n\n- **Community and Influencer Engagement**: Driving content creation and engagement rewards to maintain sustained contact and recurrent touchpoints, adhering to the marketing “rule of seven.” Encourage users to hold 1 Ape, which gives them the opportunity to participate in events, receive corresponding tickets, ApeCoin Powered curated IP box, and discounts for online purchases.\n\n- **IP Engagement**: Encourage brands to collaborate with ApeCoin, thereby fostering the growth and development of the ApeCoin ecosystem. Through collaboration with MBAs, incentivize MBAs and IP brands to join the Powered by ApeCoin ecosystem. Reduce the barrier entry for MBAs. \n\nAs we curate Powered by ApeCoin IP products, we will consider all previously approved AIPs and ApeCoin holders to include ApeCoin community IP in purchasing ApeCoin Powered curated boxes and bags. Additionally, the ApeCoin community will be rewarded through an ApeCain loyalty program for creating engaging content, such as unboxing videos, GIFs, and memes, to amplify product and “ApeCoin Powered” presence on Instagram and TikTok. ThankApe recently launched their BBAC Accelerator program which was celebrated by the community and we are looking to build off of this momentum and address the broader ecommerce flywheel out to web2 meeting consumers where they are outside of crypto Twitter. We will build our infrastructure to help the 30 winners of the BBAC while scaling to support the long tail of other businesses not rewarded. As ThankApe is a partner, we will work with them closely to further the impact and benefit to the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\n**NFT NYC Case Study**\n\nWe piloted the booth solution at NFT NYC during three events: NotNFTNYC, Clubhouse, and Bored Brunch, showcasing 13 IP products. The Bored Trading Co.’s booth drove conversation, inspiration, and even a couple of transactions. Rising tides lift all boats, and the AIP will allow us to scale this program with technology to accept $APE for onsite payments during events and support ApeChain in the future.\n\nIn addition, ApeCoin Powered curated boxes and bags with IP products will be deployed for smaller events and promotion to VIPs and influencers. Individuals and communities will be able to purchase curated boxes and bags directly from our e-commerce site. We will have a limited presales drop of the curated box(es) to drive revenue and accessibility. Ultimately, the goal is to drive leads from events back to the IP brands. Bored Trading Co. will help facilitate B2B leads with a 5% fee to support the financial sustainability of the project.\n\nBored Trading Co.’s holistic application of this strategy aims to garner attention and drive leads, ensuring a successful expansion from Web3 into the broader web2 e-commerce space. Together, Bored Trading Co. and its partners are set to break the glass ceiling and build a thriving IP ecosystem with ApeCoin & ApeChain, sparking an e-commerce consumer flywheel. The socialfi campaign and Powered by ApeCoin curated boxes will capture attention to expand the top of funnel, and the Bored Trading Co. booth at events will amplify brand awareness and leads.\n\n**Platforms and Technology**\n\nThe team currently has many Shopify e-commerce sites including [BoredIP.com](https://BoredIP.com) and [BoredBagels.com](https://BoredBagels.com), which tokengate and accept crypto. We are partnered with NiftyKit and other technology partners to elevate the current solutions and develop new capabilities for onsite transactions and socialfi with ApeCoin & ApeChain. We will work to reduce the additional gas fees incurred when transacting with ApeCoin in B2C scenarios. In addition, we want to work with ThankApe on distributing the rewards back to the community. As we develop the technology, we believe we can white-label and help other businesses onboard using ApeChain in the future.\n\n**IP Brand Selection**\n\nIP Brands will submit via a form for consideration. The Team and Advisors will work to curate a diverse IP representation from the different communities represented in the ApeCoin Community including Pudgies, Moca, BAYC, 10KTF, and many more. We will leverage a rubric to review submissions with a focus on commercialization, track record, previous AIP and ApeCoin Holder, and diversity. For example, **Powered by ApeCoin** products, **ThankApe BBAC**, and past AIPs will be provided priority for consideration.\n\n**DEFINITIONS**\n**IP** - Intellectual property represented throughout the ecosystem with PFP NFTs from various communities.  \n**MBA** - Made By Ape program with onchain licenses from Bored Ape Yacht Club.\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nBored Trading Co (BTC) will bring exposure to IP brands and ApeCoin in showcasing ApeCoin Powered products through proven e-commerce channels and social media marketing. We will drive value to the ApeCoin & ApeChain ecosystems in several ways:\n\n- **Promote the usage of ApeCoin & ApeChain**: Bored Trading Co will help consumers discover and transact with various IP brands and products, thus generating additional transactions and utility for ApeCoin. ApeCoin holders will receive a discount on the marketplace. The vision is to encourage and onboard users to use ApeChain. When making e-commerce purchases, users can save on gas fees and benefit from the lower costs, truly cultivating spending habits and user loyalty. In addition, we will work on putting our agreements on ApeChain to allow transparency and for us to move with speed while encouraging other projects to do the same.\n\n- **Visibility and Discovery**: By featuring IP products powered by ApeCoin at events and on major social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok, Bored Trading Co will enhance visibility and discovery. We will produce content through lifestyle shots and a community rewards program, breaking into web2 and other major social media networks. We will work on making the items discoverable on Instagram and TikTok shops to allow conversion as we drive our socialfi campaign.\n\n- **Rewarding the ApeCoin Community & DAO**: We will pilot ApeChain loyalty program to reward the community for content creation as a potential model for social finance (socialfi). Community members will be incentivized to create engaging content such as unboxing videos, GIFs, and memes. Bored Trading Co will provide 18% of gross revenue back to the ApeCoin community through direct sales or broker fee. There will be multipliers to incentivize ApeCoin holders at different tiers. In addition, Bored Trading Co will have a 18% revenue share back to the DAO.\n\n- **Amplify IP and Engagement**: Bored Trading Co will inspire and drive synergy in the marketing of ApeCoin powered brands and products. This will encourage and reward other ApeCoin holders across many communities like Pudgies, Mocaverse, 10KT, Azuki, and many more to join, creating a thriving ecosystem of engaged participants. Engage and unify the diverse communities of ApeCoin DAO with IP.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeiamr423zuzh4e2g7kbuikwl6kpnwhc4mev6pgzk74gcbbvcefi24q)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeiczbhxalz4hnwtfv7duulykq2u2uotlxthygk7bt7mn7s3cc7ktpq)\n\n**DEFINITIONS:**\n**ThankApe’s BBAC - Built By ApeCoin program developed as micro grants**\n\n### OVERALL COST \n\n> Total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $853,700 USD.\n\nThe funds would cover Bored Trading Co needs for the next twelve months. The goal is to secure significant lead conversions (targeting six and seven figure purchase orders) to allow a self-sustaining project with 51% of the revenue allocated to funding additional events, product, and team past the 12 months. The Bored Trading Co will strive to be sustainable while returning 36% (18% rewards to community and 18% gross revenue to the DAO) over the next 15 months from funding to account for lagging revenue until reevaluating the sustainability. Founders and Advisors incentives are based largely on successful leads and revenue. Any unused funds after 12 months will be returned to the DAO.\n\nThere are no upfront costs for MBA-approved entities to use this service. The cost to MBA-approved entities would come at providing necessary wholesale pricing. Shipping costs could be subsidized with the ability to utilize BTC’s commercial discounts but responsibility falls on the entities to ship product to The BTC warehouse.\n\nRevenue will be generated through a 5% revenue share for Bored Trading Co B2B leads. The program will allow more data to understand future iterations where fee structures might make sense to allow for sustainability. \n\n![Screenshot 2024-08-15 at 12.19.22 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreibh77tkwayawv2a5iksnx2xncqnemvy5jbaer7zry3ar2igee3mo4)\n\n![Screenshot 2024-08-15 at 12.15.53 PM.png](ipfs://bafybeia2fchpd75asqzk5b4djvukjmijh44mcicqgvgr7o2lwykhh3foci)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihx3ilxvyf4typ655pfhy55qb2j52tnwgpuozoalonqbjdwhxf2t4)\n\n### PROPOSAL\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-468-bored-trading-co-powered-by-apecoin/24512\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

Inspired by Times Square and now successfully tested at two major conferences, we plan to expand our innovative and scalable patent-pending model to cities worldwide, in the name of Ape. This proposal includes a 20% equity stake in the venture for the DAO, continues the revenue-sharing royalty from AIP-383, provides free display space to the Ape ecosystem reaching millions of people, and also enables us to activate at four more major Web3 events over the next two years similar to what we recently did at ETH Denver and NFC Lisbon. Additionally, we aim to launch a Public Bored token on ApeChain, providing direct benefits to $APE hodlers. The worst-case scenario of this AIP is we end up owning a reliable, revenue-producing asset that brings continuous value to the DAO.\n\nIn addition to succeeding at ETH Denver and NFC Lisbon this year, The Public Bored ranked 1st out of thousands of applicants in the Founder Program run by prolific angel investor, [Jason Calacanis](https://twitter.com/Jason). This provides us with critical support as we scale into a Series A funding round next year. This AIP provides ApeCoin DAO with early inclusion on all aspects of the venture in order to be positioned longer term for max benefits as the venture scales.\n\nOur model reimagines the global digital billboard industry in the name of Ape. Just as AirBnB and Uber revolutionized the hospitality and taxi industries, The Public Bored aims to transform the digital billboard sector, and to include the ApeCoin DAO on the rewards.\n\nOver the past several months, we’ve tested The Public Bored model with thousands of participants across two major conferences, generated revenue, registered a provisional patent, researched prospective billboard locations, built relationships within the billboard industry, and navigated complex permitting processes through correspondence with various City Halls in major city centers. Additionally, our transparency and accountability reporting have significantly exceeded most other AIPs.\n\nWe envision a future where anyone can display messages or art on any digital billboard worldwide as easily as sending a Tweet. Short term we’ll acquire our first permanently located billboard as a home base of operations, then open our model as a network for other billboard owners to plug into. This AIP enables us to establish that home base of operations to then scale from.\n\nFor perspective; if even 10% of our average daily revenue from the past two events continued throughout a full month as recurring revenue, we would already have exceeded the outdoor billboard industry averages, making us highly attractive to venture funding and providing a viable path to broader scaling. This AIP enables us to acquire that first permanently located digital billboard from which we can launch our network model for other billboard owners, enabling us to reach millions of people worldwide through a profitable model, directly benefiting the DAO Treasury and $APE hodlers alike.\n\nThank you ApeCoin fam, for your unwavering support throughout our activations at ETH Denver and NFC Lisbon.\n\nWe launched this initiative with our own capital, made significant strides with support from AIP-383, and now it’s time for The Public Bored to fly with this Phase 2 proposal.\n\n**Timeline of Historic Events & Accountability Reporting:**\n\n- **Original Forum Posting:**  \n    - [AIP-383: The Public Bored - MVP Launch of a Digital Billboard Network](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-383-the-public-bored-mvp-launch-of-a-digital-billboard-network/21187)\n  \n- **Snapshot Vote:**  \n    - [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/apecoin.eth/proposal/0xae1c6774b6973d098855e08566da47b1dbc38e25f346201aefe54c9f0563354b)\n  \n- **First Progress update:**  \n    - [Implementation Update | AIP-383: The Public Bored - MVP Launch of a Digital Billboard Network](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/implementation-update-aip-383-the-public-bored-mvp-launch-of-a-digital-billboard-network/21526)\n  \n- **Second Progress update:**  \n    - [The Public Bored AIP-383 Transparency & Accountability Update 2](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/the-public-bored-aip-383-transparency-accountability-update/23346)\n  \n- **Third Progress update:**  \n    - [The Public Bored AIP-383 Transparency & Accountability Update #3](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/implementation-update-aip-383-the-public-bored-mvp-launch-of-a-digital-billboard-network/21526/2)\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\n**Equity and Investment Terms:**\n\n- The ApeCoin ecosystem will receive a 20% equity stake in the venture.\n\n**Ongoing Royalties**\n\n- The ongoing royalty of 1% revenue sharing promised within AIP-383 will continue forward through this Phase 2 AIP as well.\n\n**ApeChain**\n\n- The Public Bored token will launch on ApeChain with direct benefit to $APE hodlers.\n\n**Free Display Space:**\n\n- A portion of display space will be reserved exclusively for the ApeCoin DAO and our network of partners, including $APE hodlers, BAYC/MAYC, Mocaverse, JRNY Club, Otherside, Surreal Guild, Made by Apes brands, Elite Apes, Bored Canada, French Apes, UK Apes, Bulls on the Block, and all ApeCoin Delegates.\n\n**Referral Rewards:**\n\n- A 10% reward will be given to each $APE holder for all referrals who purchase display time on our digital billboards.\n\n**Pay with $APE incentives:**\n\n- Bonus display time will be provided to anyone paying in $APE.\n\n**Ecosystem Recruitment:**\n\n- The Build with $APE page on our website with its corresponding Guide for new AIP authors will be expanded upon, encouraging and helping new builders to join the ApeCoin community.\n\n\n### OVERALL COST\n\n**Total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $2.7M paid in $APE**\n\n**Two-Year Budget Allocations as follows:**\n\n**Acquisition of Digital Billboards: $1.7M**\n- Secure up to four permanently located digital billboards through acquisition or new construction.\n\n**Core Team Staffing and Related Expenses: $350k**\n- Build a lean yet effective core team, adhering to LEAN and AGILE principles.\n\n**Marketing & Sales: $200k**\n- Drive engagement and user growth to meet our customer adaption and monthly recurring revenue targets.\n\n**Four Event Activations: $200k**\n- Host four more major events similar to the ETH Denver and NFC Lisbon activations we successfully completed earlier this year.\n\n**Technology Development: $150k**\n- Enhance and innovate the platform’s technology including the launch of our mobile app.\n\n**Legal, Accounting & Professional Fees: $100k**\n- Ensure legal and financial compliance.\n\n**NOTE:**  \nThe Associated costs of each step are variable in nature of negotiations and billboard locations and staffing details.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThis budget ensures the strategic allocation of resources to maximize impact and efficiency. By focusing on key areas such as our first acquisition(s), staffing, marketing, events, technology development, and professional fees, we aim to build a robust and scalable platform that drives engagement and growth within the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\n### PROPOSAL\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-457-the-public-bored-phase-2/24358\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "*Disclaimer: Due to the recent approval of AIP-436, all AIPs requesting an allocation denominated over US$250,000 will require a super majority approval of 69% of the total number of votes cast. The Foundation has already begun coordinating to develop our new Snapshot strategy to automate these new decision making guidelines, however, we will ensure compliance with this guideline manually in the interim.*\n\n*This AIP falls above that threshold and will require 69% of votes to be approved.*\n\n## PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\n\n> ApeLance is set to transform the freelance landscape by offering a secure, transparent, and efficient platform powered by blockchain technology. By ensuring instant payments, confidentiality, and a robust verification system, ApeLance provides a reliable and innovative solution for freelancers and clients worldwide.\n\n\n**The Problem**: Traditional freelance platforms often charge high service fees (up to 40%) and can delay payments for several days or even weeks. Freelancers and clients alike face issues with trust and transparency, as the terms of service and payment processes are controlled by centralized entities. In some regions, payments cannot be received, and transfers do not go through. With Web 3.0, we aim to ensure equal rights and opportunities for everyone across the globe.\n\n\n> ApeLance Competitive Advantages\n ![image](ipfs://bafkreih5t2xvvoekcrxfmziwwhsswionlwgroidkwdccvmxmf6bkqogxt4)    \n\n\n⭐  ApeLance: The Solution\nApeLance leverages smart contracts on ApeChain to automate and secure payment processes. Payments in ApeCoin are instant and transparent, significantly reducing the risk of non-payment or delayed payment. Smart contracts hold funds in escrow and release them upon the completion of predefined milestones, ensuring that both parties fulfill their obligations. Payment delays can disrupt the cash flow for freelancers. By utilizing ApeCoin and smart contracts, ApeLance ensures immediate and secure payments upon task completion, providing financial stability for freelancers.\n\n⭐ Easy Account Creation\nCreating an account on our platform is simple and does not require any personal information. Users can register using their wallet address created on ApeChain or their MOCA ID. This approach ensures that the personal information of both contractors and clients remains confidential, while also enhancing the platform’s usability regardless of the user’s location or background. ApeLance aims to eliminate these biases and create an equal opportunity environment for all users.\n\n⭐ Bid\nBidding allows freelancers to offer their services at competitive rates, ensuring clients receive the best value for their projects. By creating a competitive environment, clients can choose from a range of bids that suit their budget and quality expectations.\n\n⭐ NFT Verification and Badge System\nThe NFT Verification and Badge System is a key feature of ApeLance that allows users to verify their NFTs and receive a badge on their profile. This badge serves as a mark of authenticity and credibility within the ApeLance marketplace. Verified NFT badges provide clients and freelancers with an added layer of trust, knowing they are dealing with genuine members of the NFT community. NFT users can easily find and connect with others who share similar NFTs, fostering a sense of community within the marketplace.\n\n⭐ Conclusion\nApeLance is set to transform the freelance landscape by offering a secure, transparent, and efficient platform powered by blockchain technology. By ensuring instant payments, confidentiality, and a robust verification system, ApeLance provides a reliable and innovative solution for freelancers and clients worldwide.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiarv5ijbvoikmsyfu6nzgbvhkxozqthek4cahgbrukvko766riryy)\n\nFreelancer: An individual who offers their services on a project-by-project basis, often working independently and remotely.  \nClient: An individual or entity that hires freelancers to complete specific projects or tasks.\n\n🌍 Facts about Freelancing Worldwide\n\n▶ Statistics\n\n> Growth: The freelance workforce is growing rapidly, with an estimated 59 million freelancers in the United States alone, contributing $1.2 trillion to the economy. Freelancing is a global phenomenon, with freelancers from around the world offering their services to clients across borders.\n\n\n> Flexibility: One of the main reasons people choose freelancing is the flexibility it offers in terms of work hours, location, and choice of projects. Freelancing allows individuals to have more control over their work-life balance, leading to higher job satisfaction and overall well-being.\n\n\n> Cost-Effectiveness: For companies, hiring freelancers can be more cost-effective than hiring full-time employees, as they only pay for the work done\n\n\n> Speed and Efficiency: Freelancers can often complete projects more quickly and efficiently than traditional employees, as they are highly motivated to deliver quality work. Freelancers bring fresh perspectives and ideas to projects, contributing to innovation within companies.\n\n🪙 Freelance Industry Financial Statistics:\n\n▶ Statistics\n> Revenue Growth: The global freelance market was valued at $1.5 trillion in 2020 and is projected to reach $2.7 trillion by 2028, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.2% from 2021 to 2028.\n\n> Regional Revenue Distribution: North America accounted for the largest share of the freelance market revenue in 2020, followed by Europe and Asia-Pacific.\n\n> Sector Contribution: The technology sector is the largest contributor to freelance revenue, followed by design and creative services, and administrative support.\n\n> Freelance Platform Revenue: Online freelance platforms generated $5 billion in revenue in 2020, a significant increase from previous years, driven by the shift to remote work and the gig economy.\n\n_Our goal is to create a blockchain-based P2P freelance platform to capture 0.1% of this rapidly growing market. Unpredictable events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent isolation have demonstrated that people’s lives are not fixed. The next generation dreams of working on diverse projects from anywhere in the world rather than settling in one place._\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeidfzngath63vvlyeukvmb6weauzyn4gubxpk425lclboki7eagaa4)\n\n>Increased Utility for ApeCoin\n\nPayment Medium: Using ApeCoin as the primary currency on ApeLance will increase its demand. Freelancers will receive payments in ApeCoin, encouraging them to hold, use, or trade it within the ecosystem. ApeLance will facilitate numerous transactions daily, boosting the transaction volume and liquidity for ApeCoin._\n\nNew User Acquisition: By targeting freelancers and clients globally, ApeLance will attract new users to the ApeCoin ecosystem, including those who have not previously engaged with crypto. ApeLance will encourage active participation from the ApeCoin community, including developers, designers, marketers, and other freelancers, fostering a vibrant and collaborative environment. The platform will help businesses find skilled freelancers quickly and efficiently, driving economic activity within the ApeCoin ecosystem._\n\nNFT Verification: The NFT verification feature will incentivize NFT holders to use and hold ApeCoin, increasing engagement within the ApeCoin ecosystem._\n\nLong-Term Viability: The decentralized and transparent nature of ApeLance ensures its sustainability without reliance on a central authority, aligning with the principles of decentralization and self-sovereignty central to the ApeCoin community._\n\nThe 0.1% of the market we are targeting amounts to $500 million, representing the total sales between employers and employees. We will generate revenue by taking a commission from these transactions.\n\nAccording to our estimates, payments for jobs can be made using all types of coins available on ApeChain, with the commission structure as follows:\n\n- 0.5% marketplace fee will be charged if paying and receiving payments using ApeCoin.\n\n- 1% fee will be charged if payment is made in other coins. \n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreibihvcav4qu5iv3vnlh3rsfh6hxp2mmq44nip4xagenucpaap5ada)\n\nThe 0.5% (ApeCoin) and 1% (other coins) fees would only be collected from the client, ensuring that freelancers receive the full payment for their work. This approach aligns with our goal to attract and retain top talent by maximizing their earnings.\n\nAside from the marketplace fee, the core features of Apelance will be free to use. However, we plan to introduce premium features in the future, such as enhanced profile visibility, advanced project management tools, and access to exclusive job postings. The costs for these premium features are still being finalized and will be competitive with market standards.\n\nTipping will also be a feature offered by Apelance. We recognize the importance of allowing clients to show appreciation for exceptional work beyond the agreed-upon payment. Apelance will take a small percentage of the tips provided, set at 1%. This rate is designed to cover the administrative costs while ensuring the majority of the tip goes to the freelancer.\n\nWe plan to spend 20% of commissions rewarding our most active users and 10% to support initiatives of ApeCoin DAO. Our goal for the next five years is to attract 0.1% of the market, which is estimated $2.5 million. The 20% of commissions allocated for rewarding our most active users will be distributed based on a point system. Points will be awarded for activities such as completing projects, receiving high ratings, and contributing to community discussions. These points can be redeemed for ApeCoin or used to access premium features. The 10% allocated to support ApeCoin DAO initiatives will be used to fund projects and events that align with the DAO’s goals, such as educational programs, community meetups, and development grants. Detailed criteria and application processes for these funds will be developed in collaboration with the DAO.\n\nWe understand the importance of security, especially when dealing with token holders’ wallets. We have plans to conduct comprehensive security audits with reputable firms before the platform goes live. Although the auditing process has not yet begun, we will provide proof of these audits once they are completed.\n\nAdditionally, users will receive a Job NFT Badge, and job ads and information for NFT-certified users within the Yuga Labs ecosystem will appear at the top of listings. Similarly, Mocaverse NFTs will also rank high.\n\nThe appearance order for listings will be:\n\n1. BAYC\n2. MOCA\n3. MAYC\n4. Other ecosystem NFTs\n\nThis ranking system will provide advantages to these NFT users, ensuring they reach potential clients faster. Organizations interested in multitasking can also include NFT sales to leverage these benefits. \n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeidhe2tkcovand6x6ssr4f2lxtqc3n577ljh2amjcwmve64k5l2ire)\n\nRegarding the use of ApeCoin trademarks, we do not expect to maintain full ownership rights to the content or IP created as a result of the approval of our proposal. We anticipate that any content produced will be owned by the ApeCoin DAO, aligning with the principles of decentralization and community ownership.\n\n## OVERALL COST\n\n> **Total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $277,000**\n\n**Technical Development:**\n\n- **Smart Contract Development:** $10,000  \n   - Developing the smart contracts that will power the decentralized freelance marketplace, ensuring security and functionality.\n\n- **Integration with ApeChain:** $20,000  \n   - Integrating the platform with the ApeChain blockchain, including wallet integration and transaction processing.\n\n- **Security Audits:** $20,000  \n   - Conducting comprehensive security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities in the smart contracts and platform.\n\n- **Blockchain Node Setup and Maintenance:** $25,000  \n   - Setting up and maintaining the necessary blockchain nodes to support the platform’s operations.\n\n**User Interface Design**\n\n- **UX/UI Design:** $5,000  \n   - Designing the user interface for the platform, focusing on user experience and ease of use.\n\n- **Front-End Development:** $25,000  \n   - Developing the front-end of the platform, including responsive design for different devices.\n\n- **Testing and Iteration:** $15,000  \n   - Conducting user testing and iterating on the design based on feedback to ensure a seamless user experience.\n\n**Deployment and Launch**\n\n- **Deployment Costs:** $10,000  \n   - Deploying the platform on the ApeChain mainnet, including final testing and optimization.\n\n- **Launch Marketing:** $30,000  \n   - Marketing activities to promote the platform launch, including social media campaigns, influencer partnerships, and press releases.\n\n**Monitoring and Maintenance (1 year)**\n\n- **Ongoing Maintenance:** $60,000 ($5,000 per month)  \n   - Continuous monitoring and maintenance of the platform to ensure stability, performance, and security.

Our goal is to update Otherside-Wiki to align with contemporary web standards and to **significantly enhance the user experience**.\n\nSince its inception on May 15th, 2022, following the mint of Otherside, we have been working to **improve and evolve** the platform. Our coverage and support extend to **all developments** within Otherside and ApeChain, with our priority being to provide **timely updates** and serve as a pivotal resource for the community.\n\nOtherside Wiki was developed by our lead developer Frostyz. With additional **funding from current investors and ApeCoin DAO**, we plan to further expand the platform by bringing on board **more developers** who have specialized expertise. This expansion will **improve our capacity for growth** and ensure that the platform can thrive with a more diverse team of developers.\n\nWe have developed and enriched the experience for Otherside Users **significantly**, and also improved the **filter experience on marketplaces**. Within this we drove **additional revenue** to Yuga Labs and its partners, provided **deep knowledge** and **data** connected to Otherside, and enriched our platform with **extensive deep data**.\n\nCurrently **we are the go to platform for Otherside data**, marketplace browsing and information. To back this up with figures, last month we reached about **57k unique monthly visitors**, which have an average engagement time of **20 minutes each**, all completely through **organic marketing** and **natural demand**.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreihzdguhzgpm5e5tm3nudgcunyf2nucmcto6p5zb6bkx6jdmizzg24)\nFor two years, we have developed Otherside-Wiki at our own expense, without focusing on monetization. Our priority is to provide the **best possible information** to Otherside participants. In order to realize this and **remain independent**, financial support came from us, the founders, as well as **contributions** from Sky is the Limit Ventures and nix.eth.\n\nWe **integrate and enhance** the following topics with our funding request:\n\n1. **General Overhaul of our UI AND UX Design:** As we grew our UI and UX has become outdated. We’re planning to modernize it significantly to meet current web standards.\n\n2. **Modern Web Technologies:** As we’re expecting a bright future for ApeChain & Otherside, we want to be able to **scale for millions of users**. We want to have a solid system using current standards such as Laravel & VueJS using serverless scaling technologies so we can **focus on building the tech and not maintaining the servers**. Using standards also makes sure the website **is no longer dependent on a single person**.\n\n3. **Tailored Data Streams:** Dealing with the **large number** of projects and news in the Otherside/Apecoin ecosystem can indeed be **overwhelming**. To address this, our platform is developing a **major feature**—an entirely personalized Apecoin/Gaming feed. We want to aggregate data and information from various platforms and community initiatives into **one coherent stream**.  \n   Users will have the flexibility to **customize** this feed to align with their specific interests and preferences.\n\n4. **Deep Insights:** We will continue to **provide and expand** our deep data insights into ApeChain and Otherside. Our goal is to support a **growing number of games** on ApeChain and provide valuable **in-depth insights**.\n\n5. **Multilingual Support:** To better serve the **global community**, we plan to add support in two of the world’s **most widely spoken languages**, **Chinese** and **Spanish**, in addition to English.\n\nWe carefully considered the timing of our AIP application with Apecoin and chose to proceed only when it became truly **necessary**. Given the unforeseen delays in the launch of Otherside, and the postponement of release dates, we believe now is the critical moment for this **support**. This funding will ensure the **continued development** and success of Otherside-Wiki, maintaining our commitment to keeping the platform **predominantly free** while preparing for a more comprehensive business model post-launch of Otherside.\n\n**Note from Agora-Marketplace.eth (SITL Ventures):** In the last 2 years we’ve invested around **1,000 ETH** in Otherside related assets and also funded together with nix.eth the first 2 years of operation for Otherside-Wiki. Hereby we’re committing another investment of **$300,000 USD** to cover a part of the development costs. For us it’s a risk to do a follow-up round while seeing Otherside delays. Therefore we would like to see a **positive response** on this proposal from the community to ensure all together another **2 years of operation + improvements** for Otherside-Wiki.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeia24522ioa6ab2ricupdjwoaz5rr7qeh7kye7hklzka5iqnh2ob6u)\n\n### Partnerships & Integrations\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeidkcasoyv6lzxu2xatfujh3sx7l34x7hjms7vypyiim6br6wdv37a)\n    \n**Faraway**  \nAfter the acquisition of the assets of Kodamara, Mara and HV-MTL as part of Faraway, we have built a strong partnership with them. Together we have developed a tool that enables users to visualize future points within the Faraway ecosystem.\n\n**Otherpage**  \nWe have established a crosslinking partnership with Otherpage, enhancing visibility and exposure for both parties across our platforms.\n\n**Zharta**  \nAs early supporters of Zharta, we have integrated their digital asset rental protocol into our platform. In return, Zharta provides crosslinks from their website to our asset pages.\n\n**Inceptive Studio (in progress)**  \nWe are partnering with Inceptive Studio to seamlessly integrate our data and feeds into Otherside/Improbable.\n\n**Integrations**\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeifqiuwuth5zmwbv3dvjhwqcu7lm4qfhja4nha5imxc5kckromushi)\n\n- **ApeCoin:**  \n  We provide insights into the DAO and gaming activities related to ApeCoin, particularly within Faraway and Yuga Labs games.\n\n- **Marketplaces:**  \n  Our platform integrates listings from all major marketplaces, including Magic Eden, OpenSea, LooksRare, X2Y2, and the ApeCoin Marketplace.\n\n- **Legends of the Mara / HV-MTL by Yuga Labs:**  \n  We actively support every game developed and published by Yuga Labs. Our platform was the first to offer detailed insights and link on-chain data with in-game data.\n\n**Partners**\n\n- **Rocketcode:**  \n  Our trusted development partner, providing additional developer resources as needed for various features.\n\n- **Pixelrebel:**  \n  Our go-to partner for graphical implementations and visual enhancements.\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n**Otherside and Apecoin Integration**\n\n**Otherside** will be the cornerstone use case for the Apecoin ecosystem. Our commitment to Apecoin integration not only expands its visibility but also solidifies its utility on our platform. As we roll out premium tools and features, we will exclusively use Apecoin as our accepted currency.\n\nBy supporting us, the Apecoin DAO & Community will benefit in several ways:\n\n1. **Apecoin as Currency:**  \n  With the introduction of advanced features and tools, all microtransactions within our platform will utilize Apecoin, particularly for transactions related to our data feed.\n\n2. **ApeChain as Platform:**  \n  Within the rollout of ApeChain, we will be one of the first DAPPs to actively support ApeChain.\n\n3. **Game Integration:**  \n  We will actively support and integrate games that have achieved significant popularity, further enhancing our platform’s ecosystem.\n\n4. **Merge of Data:**  \n  Our personalized Apecoin/Gaming Feed will consolidate data from various platforms and community initiatives into a single, streamlined personalized user experience.\n\nBy increasing the adoption and utility of Apecoin, our platform will not only serve as a dynamic showcase for the potential of Apecoin but will also motivate other developers and platforms to adopt Apecoin.\n\nThis could lead to an expanded user base with increased visibility to people outside of the current Apecoin ecosystem. This symbiotic relationship not only enables further growth of our platform but also drives the Apecoin ecosystem to broader adoption.\n\n### OVERALL COST\nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $715,000 - to be paid in $APE\n\nSky is the Limit Ventures has committed additional $300k for development upon approval of the AIP.

      "title": "AIP-451: Improving Voting Cycle Efficiency and Shortening the AIP Process ",
      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\n\nThis proposal suggests shortening and standardizing the voting cycle for Ape Improvement Proposals (AIPs) in the ApeCoin ecosystem. The proposed changes include reducing the voting period from 13 days back to 6 days and establishing a voting schedule that starts every Thursday at 1pm UTC (6am PST/9am EST/9pm HKT) and ends every Wednesday at 1pm UTC (6am PST/9am EST/9pm HKT). The assignment of AIP ID numbers would take place after proposals have been approved to move on to the Live voting stage, aiming to increase the value of each AIP ID # for accepted authors. Additionally, this proposal suggests making the mandatory 7-day AIP Idea phase optional for all authors, removing any period of time where proposals may be closed for community discussion, clarifying that critical community discussion and material updates to proposals are still expected to occur during all phases of the AIP process.\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nThe aim is to reduce friction in the AIP process and better accommodate the global nature of the DAO.\n\nStreamlining the AIP Process would help to expedite community decision-making processes, enabling the community to react more quickly to changes in the ecosystem and decide on accepting new proposals.\nEstablishing a fixed voting schedule rooted in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) would enhance predictability and consistency, making it easier for community members to engage in the governance process.\nPreventing AIP Ideas from closing after the initial 7-day feedback window would allow the community to engage openly with the AIP author throughout the entire AIP process.\nMaking the AIP Idea phase optional would provide flexibility for the ApeCoin DAO, while ensuring that critical community discussion can still take place during the Draft stage.\nImproving efficiency in the assignment of AIP ID numbers would help to preserve community resources, reduce risks to the ApeCoin brand, and increase the perceived value of AIP ID numbers.\n\n\n### OVERALL COST \n\nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = 0\n\nInstead, the proposal requests that the Ape Foundation would implement the proposed updates to the voting cycle as soon as possible.\n\n\n### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-451-improving-voting-cycle-efficiency-and-shortening-the-aip-process/23632\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

Scheduled for the 14th and 15th of September 2024, this prestigious event will be held at the esteemed KL Base Jalan Sungai Besi (“KL Base”), situated in the heart of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Notably, KL Base has been designated as a key tourism destination, promoted jointly by the Ministry of Tourism, Arts & Culture (“Ministry of Tourism” or “Government”) and the Ministry of Finance of the Malaysian Government. In addition to KL Base, we have received invitations from several other prominent event venues and are currently in the process of negotiating terms with these parties to secure the optimal location for the MY Token event.\n\nMY Token is the first Web3 event in Malaysia endorsed by the Ministry of Tourism. Working together with the government, the team aims to collaborate with various Asian NFTs & Blockchain communities to create an iconic Web3 event in Malaysia.\n\nThis proposal seeks to collaborate with ApeCoin DAO by providing sponsorship for speaking engagements, a dedicated booth presence, mascot integration, and support for engaging side events during the conference.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeia5yekdlmuxmggva3rtk6ora5quqnang37eivufflvg2ksvzzzq7q)\n![image](ipfs://bafybeig6vm2vza4vdhxko624xgtkpxjch262shpslbaj2pbhokvlxro2m4)\nEVENT DETAILS\n\nMY Token is the main event introducing the first large-scale WEB3 event in Malaysia.

      "title": "AIP-446: MineApes: ApeCoin in Minecraft, engage new people and learn about Apes",
      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\nThe initiative aims to support the ApeCoin Ecosystem by the creation of a unique Minecraft Server that will expose ApeCoin to different Web2/Web3 users. The Minecraft Roleplay experience we will realize, combines learning about blockchain and cryptocurrency concepts with the fun and interactivity typical of Minecraft. This server is a multiplayer experience where different players undertake specific roles and interact with one another within a virtual world in a story or narrative context. It’s an interactive environment where players could be creative, develop unique characters, and engage in gripping stories with others in the community.\n\nPlayers will embark on their journey from ground zero, starting with neither money nor personal property. They will need to seek their first job or opt for education to acquire skills, subsequently advancing towards employment.\n\nNumerous job opportunities await players, ranging from mining and entrepreneurship to political roles or positions within the government sector. Essential roles such as doctors, nurses, firefighters, and policemen are also available.\n\nThere are many objectives in such a comprehensive mode, but we have summarized the main ones. We aim for a serene environment, free of disparities and conflicts among users.\n\n- Explore: an unique world\n- Learn: about Apes & Web3\n- Build: your in-game future\n- Socialize: meet new e-friends\n\nOur team-created virtual city is the hub of adventure for all players. From here, they are taken into a world full of opportunities starting with Town Hall as a common starting point. From schools to hospitals and museums, recreational parks, and much more, we promise varied gaming experiences with a wide variety of core buildings.\n\nBut it doesn’t stop there: the extremities of the town provide limitless plots for buying, selling, and renting—a never-ending expansion. Underneath the surface, there would be subway stations and markets, bringing another dimension to the game: discovery. Then comes the aspect where players can make their mark in the game by creating their own home or business.\n\nThe academy system is dedicated to both enlightening people on Web3 as well as exploring the intriguing origins of Bored Ape, discovering the history of the foundation and about who the founders are.\n\nWe are building our custom launcher with our “Pentagon Games” Gamemodes too. The ApeCoin’s Server will be also integrated under our launcher. Being included under our ecosystem guarantee different benefits:\n\n- The Pentagon Game launcher provides APE members with the opportunity to install the game and gain early access, along with exclusive special skins\n\n- Access other Minecraft gamemodes we’ve created in a multiverse experience\n\n- Players can earn the opportunity to have their specific APEs erected as statues. This recognition comes with on-chain airdrops and other perks for users, such as the ability to fly around for 5 minutes\n\n- Users can earn sponsored gas tokens from multiple blockchain networks, including both EVM-compatible and non-EVM chains, as they explore the platform and develop their profiles\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\n- Themed Digital World: We will create an Ape-themed digital space where anyone can come in, have fun and spend their time in an engaging environment\n\n- Educational Opportunities: We will provide learning opportunities for people and awareness about Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Web3, Metaverse and more\n\n- Media Success: Thanks to Minecraft, the best-selling game in recent years, we will gain significant media attention that will give even more visibility to ApeCoin\n\n- Knowledge: We will make the ApeCoin story known to all possible users, increasing brand recognition and understanding\n\n- Increased Usership and Adoption: Integrating ApeCoin as a game currency will incentivize players to use and own ApeCoin, increasing adoption and demand for the cryptocurrency (this Benefit will happen in the future when the gamemode is released on Hytopia)\n\n- Active and Involved Community: Creating an active and involved community around ApeCoin, with events, competitions, and activities that promote interaction and a sense of belonging\n\n- Monetization and Revenue: Generating new revenue streams through in-game purchases, special events, and other activities using ApeCoin, supporting the economic sustainability of the project\n\n### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $111,250.00\n\nThis proposal requests an allocation of $APE tokens equivalent to $111,250 USD to cover the entire cost of the development and Pentagon Games (and Versadia) operational fees for the first six months.\n\nJava Development - $31.500,00\nMinecraft Builders - $22.000,00\nModelling - $8.250,00\nMarketing - $13.500,00\nOperation Cost - $36.000,00 for the first six months ($6.000 per month)\n\nTeam members:\n\n2 Project Managers\n3 Artists / Video Makers\n3 Modellers\n8 Builders\n5 Developers\n\n### PROPOSAL\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-446-mineapes-apecoin-in-minecraft-engage-new-people-and-learn-about-apes/24041\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\n\nThis AIP proposes a modification to the ApeCoin DAO’s decision-making process by requiring a super majority vote for any proposal that involves spending or allocating more than USD two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) of DAO resources. A super majority, for the purposes of this AIP, is defined as at least 69% of the total number of tokens cast during voting in favor of the proposal without consideration of any abstained votes. In the case of proposals with funding requests designated in $APE (or any other non-USD denomination), a USD-value determination must be made during the review period prior to the voting phase, and to be clarified for the community under the Overall Cost section of the relevant proposals.\n\nThis passing of this proposal would constitute a material change to [AIP-1](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-1-proposing-the-dao-process/39) (notably Phase 7 of the AIP Process) and [AIP-2](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-2-voting-process/41).\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\n1. Enhanced Financial Stewardship: Ensures that large financial decisions have broader community support, reflecting a higher consensus and reducing risks.\n2. Increased Community Engagement: Encourages a more active participation from the community, knowing their input is crucial for major financial decisions.\n3. Risk Mitigation: Mitigates financial risk by ensuring substantial financial allocations are thoroughly vetted and widely supported within the community.\n4. Transparency and Trust: Builds greater trust and transparency within the community, as significant financial decisions require clear and convincing support.\n\n### OVERALL COST\n\nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $0.\n\nThe APE Foundation will be responsible for determining which AIPs qualify for the supermajority vote and communicating that to the ApeCoin DAO community, as well as properly setting this up for Snapshot.\n\n### PROPOSAL\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-436-enhancing-financial-decision-making-with-super-majority-voting-of-69-for-allocations-over-us-250-000/23705\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-442: Grant Ships: Accelerating ApeCoin’s Ecosystem Evolution",
      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\n\nGrant Ships: Accelerating ApeCoin Ecosystem Evolution aka “Ape Ships” is a proposed grants funding game specifically for ApeCoin DAO in support of ApeChain ecosystem development. The Grant Ships game is an “evolutionary grants meta-framework” that lets a DAO choose multiple teams of grant allocators (aka ‘Grant Ship Operators’) who compete to best allocate funds within a given domain.\n\nThis proposal is to fund 1 round of the Grant Ships game with the option to fund future rounds if the DAO likes the program. The Grant Ships platform provides a dynamic, transparent, onchain and community-driven funding initiative customized for the ApeCoin ecosystem to strategically fund sectors critical for the growth of ApeChain. This process will help ApeCoin DAO discover and empower the best allocators and the best projects aligned with their mission.\n\nThe Grant Ships game is at its heart a smart-contract-enforced governance system for grants programs. This means that the Grant Ships game has a clear ruleset and governance pathway where every in-game interaction is backed by an onchain transaction.\n\nApeCoin holders are involved at key junctures to ensure appropriate voter influence on outcomes without creating voter overwhelm or fatigue. DAO Voters influence funding direction primarily through Ship Operator and Game Facilitator elections and periodic TCR-gated Ship Operator portfolio reviews — the results of which determine relative Ship funding levels going forward.\n\nUnder the hood, Grant Ships uses Allo Protocol and Hats Protocol to provide reliable and flexible funding with revokable permissions — ensuring the DAO maintains control of the funds earmarked for grant allocation. All transactions and governance actions are recorded on-chain and presented publicly, fostering an environment of transparency, accountability and trust.\n\nAdditionally, the game can be played without the competitive aspect, serving as an open, transparent grant distribution protocol. Funding can be given to any group to distribute as grants using the app, ensuring all steps are open and available to DAO members.\n\nGrant Ships: Accelerating ApeCoin’s Ecosystem Evolution aims to create a sustainable and scalable funding model that grows with ApeChain, supporting its development into a premier blockchain ecosystem.\n\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\n* Enhanced Community Governance:\n    * Voter Engagement: One of the goals of Grant Ships is to identify skilled allocators and empower them with the necessary tools to make effective funding decisions. The DAO has the opportunity to elect individuals or teams they believe will excel in these roles. A DAO vote also determines relative Ship funding levels for subsequent rounds.\n        * Candidates are encouraged to self-nominate and actively campaign for their preferred roles. The election process will be facilitated through on-chain multi-choice voting, leveraging ApeCoin. To accommodate this, the creation of an additional module may be required to enable ApeCoin’s integration into the voting mechanism. The positions available for election are Facilitators and Ship Operators. Additionally, these roles may be appointed directly by the DAO’s councils if deemed more suitable for the DAO’s needs.\n    * Feedback: Every in-game action is recorded onchain and can be verified by any member of the DAO. This data provides the DAO with all the information needed to make informed decisions about how to run the game (e.g. ship funding and administrator elections).\n\n* Targeted Ecosystem Growth:\n    * Focused Funding Rounds: This proposal describes a funding round description that instructs Ship Operators and Grant Applicants to support the growth of ApeChain by funding and creating projects that fall the following categories:\n        * Infrastructure - ApeChain tools, protocols, frameworks, etc.\n        * DeFi - Financial platforms and initiatives\n        * Gaming - onchain game loops, NFT collections, etc.\n        * Other - the unexpected and creative\n    * Adaptive Domain Allocation: The DAO retains the flexibility to adjust the focus of future funding rounds based on emerging strategic needs.\n    * Community Driven: The Grant Ships framework allows every DAO member to influence funding decisions without frequent votes or the need to gain massive context before every voting.\n\n* Competitive Excellence:\n    * Performance-Based Funding: Our model incentivizes high performance among grant allocators by directly linking their funding to demonstrated impact of their grants. This meritocratic approach encourages each Ship to strive for excellence. The better the results they deliver relative to the other Ships, the more funding they receive. This encourages a continuous drive for improvement and innovation.\n        * Grant allocators verify the completion of funding-related milestones through a multi-step process. Initially, projects outline their intended milestones as part of the application procedure. Game Facilitators then have the responsibility to assess and approve these milestones.\n        * Once a grant is sanctioned and the project has successfully undergone KYC and consented to our compliance policy, they are required to submit detailed reports of their milestones through the App. The Ship Operator meticulously reviews these submissions to ascertain whether the reported milestones align with the approved plan.\n        * Subsequent to the Ship Operator’s validation, the Game Facilitator will also validate and is authorized to release the allocated funds to the project. This systematic approach ensures that only those projects that fulfill their proposed objectives receive the funding.\n        * The following screenshots are what a milestone report looks like in the app:\n\n![img](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/a/a1af5a24139793746c01a7d8d48820563e743cb0.png)\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/b/b40dd9cf8899822bcd02b49a9331bef9998bffa8.png)\n\n* Impact Measurement: Grant Ships does not evaluate impact directly, instead providing numerous onchain events detailing all activity within the grants program, which can be fed into external impact evaluation systems. \n* Accountability Mechanisms: While encouraging excellence and freedom to run a Ship how operators choose, our system also has strong accountability mechanisms in place. * Underperformance: In cases where a Ship repeatedly underperforms or fails to meet the community’s standards of integrity and impact, the DAO has the authority to defund them completely or revoke their ability to allocate funds. There is also a “flag” system in place which allows the game facilitator to take immediate action if a Ship’s actions are outside of compliance. * Graduated Consequences: A yellow flag can be issued by Game Facilitators which acts as additional context to voters during TCR votes. A red flag is issued for obvious, repeated or intentional violations by a Grant Ship. A red flag suspends a Ship’s ability to distribute funding, until and only if, the DAO reinstates the Ship’s permissions through a TCR vote.\n>* Cultural Reinforcement: By tying funding to performance and making the outcomes publicly available, we foster a culture of accountability and excellence within the DAO ecosystem. Operators are motivated not only by potential funding but also by the prestige and recognition that come from being a top-performing Ship.\n>* Competitive and Collaborative: The competitive environment provided by the Grant Ships game will attract high-quality projects and allocators who are committed to the success of ApeChain. We also anticipate patterns of cooperation, skill-sharing and seeking of win/wins among ships and builders in the interest of creating something awesome as a community.\n\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/6/6f16d0c137e7cd4ff182850884fa6a32100ebbd5.png)\nSample portion of feed from the Grant Ships App from a live grant round\n\n* Documentation and Reporting: Feeds generated from smart contract data are accessible through the Grant Ships app. These feeds detail funding activities providing key metrics and insights for voters to use during decision making.\n    * Compliance Policy and Attestation: Fund allocations must be approved by a Game Faciltator before they can be distributed by a Grant Ship. This provides the DAO with the option to implement policies and prerequisites for grant recipients (e.g. KYC compliance, AML procedures, etc.). This takes the responsibility and potential conflict of interest from the Grant Ship operators and lets them focus on making wise allocation decisions.\n        * The duty of performing due diligence, including KYC/KYB checks, is assigned to the elected Game Facilitators. They are tasked with ensuring compliance with all ApeCoin DAO regulations. Our contracts stipulate that Ship Operators are not involved in handling grant funds; instead, a Game Facilitator is required to authorize fund transfers to grant recipients. This occurs only after verifying that all requirements have been fulfilled.\n\n\n### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = 550,000 $APE.\n![Screenshot 2024-07-31 at 1.50.29 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreigw5kiihvvpd3weejmcgogy52tlvxkmnwftea4dtrahygfwixztsi)\n    \n\n### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-442-grant-ships-accelerating-apecoins-ecosystem-evolution/23455\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

Period.**\nIt’s not easy to stand out and get the attention of people nowadays… so, we need guerrilla marketing.\n\n**Guerrilla marketing** is a highly effective strategy due to its ability to deliver high impact at a low cost. By leveraging the psychological impact and viral nature of unconventional tactics, it has the ability to generate significant buzz and engagement.\n\n**KOL partnerships and brand ambassadorships** are a proven model in web3 and are widely adopted by top-tier projects in this space. To date, ApeCoin does not have a single partnership of this kind.\n\nThis AIP offers a bold mix of the above mentioned :muscle:\n\nEducational content and marketing by kodama.eth - amplified by the Apemobile!\n\nAn ApeCoin branded all-black Porsche 911 Carrera 4s.\nCustom license plate - APE 911.\nApeCoin logo on the tank cap.\n“Powered by ApeCoin” branding on the side, in the classic Porsche style.\n\nThe car will be called Apemobile and will be established as status symbol of success within the whole web3 space. Leveraged by a multi-year partnership with web3 KOL kodama.eth and the targeted use of guerilla marketing tactics in order to amplify **educational content around the DAO, ApeCoin & ApeChain.**\n\n**The car will be a tool to polarize and get attention.**\n\nThink about how many ppl will join a spaces called “How I got a Porsche 911 from the ApeCoin DAO”.\n\n**In an endless X feed you need to stand out.** You need to grab the attention and once you have it, you use it to educate and make them one of us :wink:\n\nNOTE: The Apemobile can be leveraged by the whole community. Not just kodama.\n\nThe pictures can be used by everyone.\n\nThe AIP author will work closely with the Marketing and Communications working group, who have the option to opt-in to particpate, to maximize the benefits of this initiative.\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n**A multi-year partnership with kodama.eth, web3 KOL**\n\nKodama has a large, engaged following within the web3 community. Partnering with him will significantly increase the brand’s exposure and reach the crypto native audience on an ongoing base. He will commit to creating content, joining spaces, visiting events with the sole purpose of spreading the message of the DAO, ApeCoin & ApeChain. EDUCATION!\n\nBelow you will find a list of **several benefits**:\n\n**Targeted Marketing:**\n\n- Marketing within the web3 space is crucial for a projects success. With Kodama, Apecoin will reach a relevant and interested audience over the course of several years.\n\n**Increased Reach and Visibility:**\n\n- The Apemobile will polarize and guarantee people’s attention. Kodama will post at least one content piece per week, mainly from Twitter/X account @kodama_eth, and will generate millions of impressions.\nHe will drive the car daily and will visit relevant crypto events/meetups all over Europe.\nThis will create additional opportunities for content creation with engaged community members.\n\n**Credibility and Trust:**\n\n- Kodama has established trust with his followers and has become a relevant KOL within the broader YugaLabs and ApeCoin ecosystem. Having him as a permanent partner endorsing ApeCoin can enhance the brand’s credibility and trustworthiness.\n\n**Content Creation:**\n\n- Kodama will post at least one content piece per week. Educational, lifestyle or joining spaces - a broad mix that appeals to different audiences. The goal remains the same - to spread awareness and to educate about ApeCoin.\n\n**Cost-Effective Marketing:**\n\n- Compared to traditional advertising and regular web3 KOL partnerships this comes at a very low cost. It perfectly complements the recent F1 partnership of the DAO (which btw opens up many possibilities for further content creation).\n\n**Engagement and Interaction:**\n\n- The Apemobile will polarize! Kodama will leverage this and foster active engagement with his followers and the broader web3 community. This will lead to higher interaction rates for the campaign and increased brand visibility.\n\n**Authenticity:**\n\n- Kodama will share personal stories and experiences, which will make his endorsements feel more genuine and relatable compared to traditional ads.\n\n**Rapid Awareness and Virality:**\n\n- The Apemobile has the potential to go viral quickly. It can create a buzz around ApeCoin and ApeChain. Imagine a post starting with “WTF I really got a Porsche 911 from the ApeCoin DAO”\n\n**Diversified Marketing Strategy:**\n\n- Working with kodama adds another layer to ApeCoins marketing strategy, diversifying the current approach and helping Ape reach potential new users/buyers.\n\n**Long-Term Partnership:**\n\n- Building a long-term relationships with kodama will result in continuous exposure for the ApeCoin brand.\n\n**Why Guerilla Marketing for ApeCoin?**\n\n- Proven Concept\n- Cost Efficiency\n- Brand Differentiation\n- Psychological Impact\n- High Engagement\n- Viral Potential\n\nGuerrilla marketing is a must-do for every businesses aiming to maximize their marketing impact while minimizing costs. Its ability to create memorable experiences, foster strong customer connections, and differentiate your brand in a crowded market makes it an essential component of a modern marketing strategy. By leveraging the psychological impact and viral nature of unconventional tactics, it has the ability to generate significant buzz and engagement.\n\nThe Apemobile will make **ApeCoin a status symbol of success.**\n\nSports cars have always had a special status in society and especially in crypto.\nThey are associated with success.\n\nThis is precisely why it is the perfect fit for this marketing initiative.\nOn top of that it fits perfectly into the DAO’s current marketing efforts with the F1.\n\nThe AIP author will work closely with the Marketing and Communications working group to maximize the benefits of this initiative.\n\n### OVERALL COST \n> “Total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = EUR 185,000.”\n\n155,000 EUR for the Porsche\n0 EUR for 3 year KOL partnership & content creation\n15,000 EUR for insurance for 3 years\n15,000 EUR for maintenance*\n\n*If not used it will be returned to the DAO at the end of the 3 year period as well.\nIf spent it will all be documented and invoices will be shared publicly.\n\nThe special license plates (APE 911), the foiling of the car and gasoline costs will be covered by the AIP author.\n\n**The car will be resold after 3 years and all proceeds will go back to the DAO.***\n\nMaking the effective costs within 3 years around 75,000 EUR aka 25,000 EUR per year.\n(Assuming a resale value of 110,000 EUR for the Porsche)\n\n*If this is not legally feasible, then alternatives such as a charitable donation can be considered.\n\n### PROPOSAL\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-459-the-apemobile-guerrilla-marketing-meets-a-kol-partnership/24397\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": " AIP-449: Translation System and Community Reward Program ",
      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION \n\nThe DAO is international in nature and should not be limited by language. Our goal is to comprehensively increase the participation rate of DAO members. In addition to translating articles into various languages, we will also proactively send each AIP to different communities, collect opinions from each community, and publicly disclose them to all members on our website.\n\nWe will arrange for employees to communicate with leaders of various communities and integrate into those communities. They will use the translation system to translate primarily English articles and opinions into different languages, thereby increasing DAO member participation. Our employees play a crucial role in disseminating information and gathering community opinions. This not only enhances the transparency of the DAO but, more importantly, fosters cohesion among members from different regions, thus increasing their sense of value and commitment.\n\nWhen two or more different language communities need to hold an online meeting, our system will provide real-time AI oral translation, allowing communities to understand each other’s opinions immediately and respond promptly, thus overcoming language barriers.\n\nWe encourage DAO members to make proposals. In addition to translating the AIPs for voting into various languages, we will assist community members in translating their opinions. The system can also provide oral translation for DAO members’ AIPs. For example, Tony, a Japanese member, speaks his AIP in Japanese to the system, the real-time AI translation feature will convert the Japanese into an English document. This facilitates DAO members in writing their AIPs and sharing AIPs or opinions with other communities.\n\nIn order to comprehensively increase the participation of DAO members, we will not only provide comprehensive language and community assistance, but also develop a reward mechanism to encourage everyone to participate and reward Apecoin.\n\nThe reward funds are designed to incentivize and recognize the active participation and contributions of APE coin holders in the DAO. These funds will be distributed through a transparent and fair system, ensuring that all participants have an equal opportunity to benefit. Below are the main aspects of the reward distribution process:\n\nReward Criteria and Mechanism\n1. Contribution-Based Rewards: The majority of the funds will be allocated based on the contribution levels of APE coin holders. Contributions can include proposing and developing AIPs, participating in discussions, voting, and other forms of engagement that add value to the DAO. We will use a points-based system to quantify contributions, with more significant and impactful activities earning more points.\n2. Participation Rewards: To encourage broad participation, a portion of the rewards will be randomly distributed to APE coin holders who participate in voting and other community activities. This ensures that even smaller holders feel valued and are motivated to engage.\n\nDistribution Process\n1. Points Accumulation: We will calculate points on a monthly basis. The system will accumulate points based on the activities and contributions of APE holders. At the end of each month, these points will be converted into corresponding reward tokens.\n2. Transparency and Verification: All contributions and points will be recorded in the system to ensure verifiability. This prevents any fraudulent activity and ensures fair distribution.\n3. Reward Payment: Once verified, the rewards will be directly distributed to the wallets of eligible APE coin holders. Distribution will occur regularly to ensure that contributors are consistently recognized and rewarded.\n\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\n1. Bringing the APECOIN DAO to the global stage The APECOIN DAO should not be limited to a single language. In the past, the participation rate of Asian members has been relatively low, with fewer proposals initiated. We want to ensure that friends from every country have a share.\n2. Providing sustainable returns for APE members By opening up a reward system, we will create a reward mechanism to encourage participation and reward APE. The first quarter will be 100,000 APE. In the following quarters, we will provide over 95% of the proposal funds as rewards for APE holders.\n3. Maximizing the transparency and participation of AIPs In the past, information has not been circulated well. We will translate the proposals and spread them to each community, allowing everyone to monitor the AIP authors.\n4. Strengthening communication between APE communities We will collect and summarize the opinions of each community weekly, translate them into different versions and feed back to each community. We will provide real-time AI oral translation, allowing communities to understand each other’s opinions immediately and timely communication.\n\n\n### OVERALL COST \n\nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = 460,000 APE.\n\nTranslation software system: 190,000 APE Reward system: 40,000 APE\n\n##### Translation Software & Reward System breakdown\n- Project Setup Phases\n    - Requirements Analysis and Planning Cost: 11,000 $APE\n    - Design Phase Cost: 22,000 $APE Platform Architect (1) Platform Requirements: Design tools (e.g., Figma, Adobe XD)\n    - Technology Selection and Prototype Development Cost: 16,700 $APE Personnel: Frontend Developer (1) Backend Developer (1) Tester (1) Platform Requirements: Development tools, prototype tools (e.g., InVision)\n\n- Project Initiation Phase\n    - Development and Implementation Cost: 100,000 $APE Personnel: Frontend Developers (2) Backend Developers (3) Testers (2) DevOps Engineer (1) Platform Requirements: SPA website development framework (e.g., Vue.js, React), backend services (e.g., Node.js, Express)\n    - Testing and Quality Assurance Cost: 30,000 $APE Personnel: Testers (2) Automation Test Engineer (1) Platform Requirements: Testing tools (e.g., Selenium, JUnit), continuous integration tools (e.g., Jenkins)\n    - Deployment and Go-Live Cost: 25,000 $APE Personnel: DevOps Engineer (1) System Administrator (1) Platform Requirements: Cloud platform services (e.g., Azure), monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)\n\tTotal Cost: 230,000 $APE\n\nMaintenance costs: 80,000 APE\nEmployee costs: 50,000 APE\n\n##### Employee Costs breakdown\n\nEmployee A.

      "title": " AIP-470: MBA Powered ApeFest Lisbon x ApeCoin Merch ",
      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION \n\nBuilding on Normie’s AIP-299 idea for an ApeFest/ApeCoin merch activation, I’ve been wanting to get this idea up for a while. I reached out to Normie to find out if they were planning on creating a 2024 ApeFest merch AIP and the answer was no. So, here we are.\n\nGenerating increased exposure to ApeCoin DAO via unique, high quality, collaborative merch made by the community…\n\nThe idea here is to build on that initial AIP concept. We will be creating merch, along with the help of other MBA businesses, that can be distributed to ApeCoin holders for ApeFest.\n\nThis will not be a typical generic hoodie merch kit. It will be custom ApeFest Lisbon X ApeCoin merch!\n\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nWe will have high quality merch that holders can be proud of wearing and posting about on social media before, during, and after ApeFest.\n\nWorking with other MBA license holders, we will include some of their products (to be determined based on custom options), to help with awareness and word of mouth.\n\nWe’ll require that you have a specific role in the ApeCoin Discord or Discourse forum plus have an ApeFest ticket in order to claim your free merch package (1 per person). We will be asking claimers to submit a screenshot of their Tokenproof ticket/dashboard, tied to their wallet containing the ApeCoin. This will show the ticket and the wallet address.\n\nWe will also have some surplus items that we can potentially giveaway at ApeCoin/ApeFest side events and other ApeCoin centric events throughout the year.\n\n\n### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $96,500.\n\nThe plan is budgeting $225 per merch kit for 250 total with about $50 per kit for packaging and logistics ($69,000); we would only receive $69k upon AIP approval. The additional $27,500 to make 100 extra kits would be received only if we sell out of the 250 kits, else the unused funds would remain with the DAO treasury.\n\nMerch Kit Budget Details: Merch Kit - $225 (this includes all MBA products sourced during the Discovery Phase)\n\nLogistics per kit claim - $50 (this includes the overall kit packaging and shipping to claimers)\n\nTotal Overall Per - $275\n\n$69,000/$275 = 250 Merch Kits\n\nSpecifics will be ironed out on product costs once I have the MBAs selected and their product offerings.\n\nAnything surplus would go to other events as previously stated.\n\nThis will cover all products, packaging, and logistics.\n\nUpon approval, the DAO would release the initial $69,000 to cover the 250 kits.\n\nClaim Out Phase 1: If the initial claim for the merch kits is successful and sells out (250 kits), I intend to request a reorder with a pre-order period to meet excess demand for those not able to claim during the first claim phase.\n\nAfter that, I will open it up to have the other 100 claimable for the other $27,500 to be released to cover the extra 100 merch kits. Else, the remaining $27,500 would remain with the DAO treasury.\n\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/9/9d8a5617a9497b8ba6bbd1484d9694bba8a639b5.png)\n\n\n### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-470-mba-powered-apefest-lisbon-x-apecoin-merch/24518\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION \n![img0](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/9/90e4dc97e71e0c2da98714eb8ca89b512e75f2aa.jpeg)\nIntroducing Home Harvest…\n\nHome Harvest is a consumer tech company focused on Growing Wellness™ around the world. We’ve developed an entire wellness ecosystem, based around revolutionary growing units for the home that unite design, horticulture and technology. We are enabling a revolution in wellness through the way food is produced and consumed.\n\nOur first product, accompanied by our IoT grow platform, app and wellness co-pilot, is an indoor ‘smart-farm’ unit that is miles ahead of anything else currently on the market, has a patented lighting system to make it more efficient than the competitors and a ‘mass market’ price point that is currently not covered by existing products in the market.\n\nOur mission is: ‘Zero food miles, Zero packaging. Zero waste. Healthy living. Healthy planet.’\n\nFollowing a 3 year long pilot programme in homes, schools and restaurants, Home Harvest is already a hit with consumers, having developed a range of growing units that revolutionise healthy living by enabling consumers to grow everyday foods in their own home. Our indoor ‘smart farms’ unlock professional growing results for the mass market, allowing consumers to grow and harvest hundreds of varieties of superfoods, leafy greens and herbs within just 8 days of planting.\n\nHealthy living and healthy planet…\n\nOur value proposition massively reduces consumer cost, food waste, food miles and transportation carbon emissions while delivering the very healthiest of produce directly into the homes of consumers around the world.\n\nEvery farmer is also supported by our nutritional co-pilot; a personal ally in a consumer’s journey to a vibrant world of healthy eating, turning the road to wellness into a rewarding and enjoyable voyage. With our app-based co-pilot, growing food and following your own healthy diet at home becomes less of a chore and more of an uplifting, self-driven mission.\n\n“Home Harvest brings the heart and soul of healthy living directly into your home. It is a game changer.” Professor Seth Davis - Chair of Plant Biology : University of York\n\nToken driven reward programme and web3 backbone…\n\n![img](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/8/81650bfd9767a918aca2c2d216fd00e6c2e0a737.jpeg)\n\nChanging consumer behaviour requires encouragement and our tokenised rewards programme will encourage consumers to ‘Grow to Earn’, ‘Live Healthily to Earn’ and ‘Cook to Earn’ whilst also rewarding the reduction in carbon footprint that’s achieved by using a Home Harvest smart farm.\n\nVery simply, we forecast that additional web3 infrastructure and token incentives could help deliver an additional 40% uplift in sales over the first 5 years - $500m in revenue / 500k additional customers. This revenue uplift from web3 integration translates into an additional $1.25 Billion in EV at a x15 multiple of EBITDA.\n\nWe want to be a leading example of how a web3 funded / powered product can make real societal change, be hugely profitable and scale much faster than traditional product and retail tech. As an aside to the financial potential, we feel the potential for PR and mainstream media spotlight on how ‘the jpeg monkeys’ assembled and created a global wellness unicorn is also of real benefit to the relevant communities and web3 in general.\n\nThe $GROW token will launch with an initial raise supported by an extensive community points campaign to bring awareness and build community in the lead up to the product launch. Weighted token emissions will benefit early adopters and communities of the new home-growing health revolution (BAYC, MAYC, MOCA communities and $APE holders), an airdrop schedule of $GROW will be scheduled to coincide with the launch of the physical product and we have a token roadmap that plans to make full use of ApeChain capabilities. We aim to be one of the first ‘big’ products on the chain.\n\nThe rewards scheme is curated to reward early participation as well as community membership from BAYC, MAYC, MOCA and $APE holders. Early participants in the points program also have the opportunity to earn the cost of a pre-sale smart farm prior to launch. Once the unit is in place and in-use, the user or farmer also starts to earn monthly reward points for grow time / usage, grow variety, grow-based tasks, community involvement in the app and more, which will be converted into $GROW tokens as part of the monthly emission schedule. A perpetual rewards mechanism, funded by profits from the sales of the Home Harvest units, surrounding product and peripherals range and the subscription model.\n\nAdditional rewards will include ‘money can’t buy’ products and events such as limited edition MBA and Apecoin DAO styled smart farms, limited seat access to chef recipes and live video one on ones, limited edition merchandise, farmers equipment, Ape-only early access to each new experiential store opening and more.\n\nThere are 3 token phases:\n1. Pre-launch / Raise:\n\nA rewards framework which distributes points to active community members and partners during the 12 months lead up to production. Initial points airdrop and multiplier for BAYC, MAYC, MOCA communities and $APE holders.\n\nObjectives: An opportunity to raise additional funds and gain pre-sale orders of the unit, during the lead up to production.\n* Building a strong community pre-launch\n* Gaining insight into eating and dieting behaviors\n* Giving early adopters the opportunity to earn back the cost of a pre-sale unit, prior to delivery\n* Allowing point staking and other beneficial token / defi practices, subject to jurisdiction\n\n2. Launch:\nCoinciding with the physical product launch, $GROW built on Apechain, airdropped to early adopters, points accruers and BAYC, MAYC, MOCA communities and $APE holders. Sell $GROW after a lock period, or exchange for free physical units.\n\nObjectives: A rewards system that moves from primarily community-based to based on unit usage, app usage and token holding / potential staking\n* Powering the Grow2Earn concept and enabling us to reward users for living healthier lifestyles\n* Enabling us to reward users with carbon offset credits, converted into $GROW\n* Enabling web3 enhanced token-gating, gamification and custom supplies / merchandise\n* Allowing governance over certain aspects of the company growth\n\n3. Post-Launch:\n* A method to continually reward and involve the community in the success of Home Harvest with monthly emissions.\n* A case study for the benefits of web3 infrastructure in a web2 product\n* An ability to create tailored growing experiences and rewards, based on individual users / wallet connection\n\nFurther consideration: Our protocol roadmap is a work in progress but we’re also currently exploring the possibilities of creating the $GROW token as an OFT, enabling it to be native to ApeChain, Arb and other orbit chains like the upcoming AnimeChain from Azuki. We’ve sought advice from consulted with some of the biggest builders in web3 and feel we have access to THE best-in-class web3 team to help facilitate the token and ecosystem development, working alongside our established and experienced founders and product engineering team.\n\nAdditional Home Harvesters IP…\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/3/3f6c605117e84b6dbf17b7a76ba7b46ca820c87c.png)\n\nWe’ve also developed an immersive world of inspiring digital characters that reward and gamify growing, healthy eating and sustainability using Home Harvest products. These will be upgraded as part of the points system and earned rewards; much like the Netflix app, a junior user will also have the ability to participate in a specific range of growing games, upgrades and quests, aimed at teaching them about healthy living and wellness. Pudgy are pioneers in crossing over to web2 and also a leading example of a web3 brand beginning to stake a claim on some of the $28 billion global toy market. We will follow suit with the Home Harvesters.\n\nThese characters will be airdropped to early adopters, pre-sale unit purchasers and BAYC, MAYC, MOCA communities and $APE holders and will provide another licensing and revenue opportunity to the ecosystem.\n\nA huge global market that’s growing…\n\nThe global addressable market for the main unit is conservatively well over 200 million families driven by the consumer desire for cost conscious, healthy and sustainable living. Our commercial proposition is underpinned by a high margin, monthly subscription powered by an app that delivers dietary advice, recipe ideas, monthly supplies, growing support, ultimately building the world’s largest community of connected growers.\n\nA unicorn in the making…\n\nIn business timing is everything. The customer demand for this wellness revolution is now. The global market is wide open for the first serious mass market product to establish its brand and claim significant market share around the world.\n\nThere is no incumbent competition and consumers don’t already own one. It’s simply a great concept that makes sense to everyone we speak to. It offers an enormous prize and a rare commercial opportunity.\n\nOur forecasts show that sales of only 750k units will deliver over $125m EBITDA (in an addressable market of well over 200+ million customers). Using a conservative enterprise valuation multiple on profit of at least 15x, we confidently believe Home Harvest will become a unicorn business given our subscription and technology ‘moat’ that drives high margin and long customer life-time value.\n\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/a/a81d957b71298eea5e3caf9fde9bc5826681fb25.jpeg)\n\nHome Harvest has the potential to sit alongside the kettle, Nespresso machine, NutriBullet and air-fryer in kitchens and homes around the world.\n\nFollowing a successful trial, we are now looking for an initial investment of $2m to bring this product to a global mass market. The highly experienced founders have a proven track record of growing, scaling and exiting businesses that are relevant – both agri-food production and online retailing.\n\nConsumer value proposition in brief:\n* Grow hundreds of varieties of superfoods, herbs, salads and leafy greens - ready to eat from just 8 days\n* BIG financial savings for customers vs retail price\n* Sustainable production - no food miles, waste or packaging\n* No skills required - just add water\n* Priced for mass market adoption - units from $350 - $495\n* Easy monthly subscription from all supplies and technology from $9 p/m\n* Free-standing or built-in appliance option, with a range of colours\n* Supported wellness journey - App and digital ecosystem to optimise growing, engage, support, inspire and connect customers to the global community\n* The Home Harvesters IP – family friendly digital characters and educational platform to inspire and reward kids for growing and eating new foods\n* Generous Web 3 token-powered rewards programme to incentivise customer behaviour\n\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nHow does Home Harvest embody the Ape core values?\n\nBoldness: Our mission requires commitment, belief and determination to change the way global consumers rethink their approach to food production and health. Growing Wellness™ is a journey worth winning, for ourselves and for the planet.\n\nEquality: We believe in food equality - the expansive concept that all people have the ability and opportunity to grow and to consume healthful, affordable, and culturally significant foods.\n\nTransparency: Our personal, individual contribution to our mission should be visible and motivational to all. That’s why we will embrace web 3 and open blockchain technology as the foundation of our wellness ecosystem.\n\nCollective Responsibility: We’re determined to leave everything better than we found it. Together we will build a movement that will change the way we eat and live…forever.\n\nPersistence: We’re building this movement not just for us, but for the generations to come, for the world. Ape don’t stop.\n\n![img4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/2/2f1e43725eddb3d0502f8224b72a52c6fb7432fd.jpeg)\n\nSpecific benefits to the Apecoin community, brand & ecosystem:\n\nCommunity / members:\n* Airdrop of $GROW token to BAYC, MAYC, MOCA communities and $APE holders\n* To give members of the DAO preference on all future collabs, custom Home Harvest units, merchandise and token-gated, money-can’t-buy experiences\n* To give members access to ‘Ape only’ pre-sale units and $GROW token IDO before the public\n* A game changing, valuable cause for members of the DAO to support, advise and assist in building the next evolution in wellness and sustainable growing systems\n* Apes will have preference on supplier contracts, job applications and available positions within Home Harvest\n\nBrand / Apecoin brand as a whole:\n* The association of the DAO with our cause for global good and to aid in our mission of Growing Wellness™ and sustainability for the planet\n* MSM PR and exposure for the DAO as the catalyst for this healthy living revolution, Growing Wellness™ together.\n* To unlock custom Apecoin and MBA versions of the initial Home Harvest smart farm\n* To give added utility to Apecoin in the form of pre-ordering and purchasing Home Harvest smart farm and subscriptions using Apecoin\n* Use of snapshots to reward wallets that retain both $GROW and $APE, giving further utility and purpose to $APE\n* Hugely positive use of the Apecoin DAO and Treasury for a globally recognised project\n* Positive branding opportunity to have the MBA logo stamped on the interior PCB board and exterior casing of the Home Harvest unit, spreading the word of the Ape community globally and re-enforcing that fact that the units have ‘Ape inside’\n* Apecoin / Apechain branding to be prominent in all experiential retail stores, located in key cities across the world\n* The Ape ecosystem to be woven into the core narrative of Home Harvest and its future mission of ‘Growing Wellness™ ’\n\nFinancially:\n* To generate a significant ROI on investment and release token airdrop\n* To create recurring revenue for Ape unit owners in the form of monthly emissions payments. With a token buyback and burn scheme that comes from company profits, meaning you can share in the commercial success of the company without owning shares (equity)\n* To ensure preferential Home Harvest token allocation for BAYC, MAYC, MOCA communities and $APE holders: Apes will be the first to access the Home Harvest token emission schedule and receive unique Ape multipliers\n* The use of Apecoin as a payment form in the Home Harvest ecosystem\n* Airdrop of $GROW token to BAYC, MAYC, MOCA communities and $APE holders\n\nCalling all Apes around the world!\n\n55% of the world’s population (4.5 billion) lives in a city or urban environment, growing to 66% by 2050. From Sydney to Singapore to Stockholm, urban communities offer the greatest opportunity and demand for our products. Urban communities have the least access to gardens and conversely the greatest desire of our consumer groups to grow their own food and improve their health.\n\nThat’s why we plan to enter our global target markets through the largest cities in each region (based on affluence and population) by setting up experiential stores for consumers to physically engage with our products and the Growing Wellness™ movement:\n* Tokyo - 37m\n* Osaka - 19.5m\n* Shanghai - 26m\n* Hong Kong - 7.5m\n* Berlin - 3.6m\n* Paris - 11m\n* Stockholm - 1m\n* New York - 19m\n* LA - 12.5m\n* Singapore - 5.7m\n* Seoul - 10m\nThe support of the Ape community in each region will be invaluable in establishing the Home Harvest brand and launch of our ‘movement’. Apes will get exclusive pre-access to our global stores at ‘Ape only’ launch events prior to store opening.\n\n\n### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $2,000,000\n\nAll activities and costs to take the product from design to commercial launch and first 6 months of trading are broken down into 4 distinct phases outlined in the previous section. The cost for each phase is as follows:\n1. Web3 infrastructure and token protocols (Months 1-9): $550,000\n2. Tech Design and Development (Months 1-6): $700,000\n3. Design to Manufacture (Months 7-12): $872,500\n4. Pre-production and Tooling (Months 13-18): $1,750,000\n5.

      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION \n\nApeFacingApes delivers value to all Ape holders by better utilizing their IP. It not only gives holders a fresh perspective, but also tools to better monetize it. This will benefit the whole Ape- and Apecoin- Ecosystem.\n\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/1aa22b36014986aeb6872fa5bffe4da13b376b2b.png)\nApeFacingApe / BAYC\n\n> IMPORTANT\nFor easy accessibility and best user experience, we are immensely happy that YUGA LABS committed to implement our frontal Ape versions and the link to our editor into their official BAYC profile page. With this, every holder has a one-stop resource to fully utilize the BAYC IP.`\n\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/f/f90859d9a3798a0924d166fe56af0d9661dd05a3.png)\nSource : Official BAYC profile page, YugaLabs\n\nApeFacingApes already is an established project, approved by many renowned community members. It is operating under the MBA license #118. Now it is time to make it available to all 10k Apes. OG holders will of course be fully refunded.\n\nWe roughly estimate 3 new assets per month and in total 108 for 3 years. There will be slots allocated, which we will fill with own creations, creations for MBA projects and creations for Ape communities. MBA projects and communities can apply for a slot through our ticketing system in Discord.\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/5/58f7bd8c5545cf3699c94d57d9088365e14cc461.png)\nSource: X, community posts\n\n![img4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/2/2eae5d92aba9f66ac83619cb39943ddb7e2a8697.jpeg)\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nNOT JUST A DERIVATIVE:\nWe are bringing value to the original BAYC community.\nIP usage of BAYC is the critical element that provides long-term value to holders. The higher the brand recognition, the more valuable the brand and associated businesses.\nWith an increased IP usage and higher brand recognition, the whole Ape and Apecoin ecosystem will benefit.\n\n![img4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/7/75738dc1a11d36655dadc6df19e12d7fc6ee53f3.jpeg)\nSource: X, @0xClawd, example for increased marketability\n\nBRAND RECOGNITION:\n\"The extent to which a target audience can identify or recall a brand based on its visual identity. Strong brand recognition is a crucial goal for companies and leads to increased consumer trust and loyalty.”\n![img5](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/a/a6c4bb4a897fe7401d238d3f32492061d7d2861a.png)\nApeFacingApe / BAYC\n\nVISUAL IDENTITY: The visual identity of BAYC is more than just the PFP. It is in the core of the brands. ApeFacingApes, is not adding, it is extending.\n\nMEMEABILITY: „With user-generated content the emotional connection and brand personality gets elevated. Memes are a fun and engaging way for brands to connect with their audience, increase brand recognition, and stay relevant in today’s digital landscape.” With ApeFacingApes there will be many new and innovative ways to play the meme game and to stay relevant.\n\n![img6](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/7/71b3fbd9893705895a746abbb0880dd08dce48e9.jpeg)\n\nOur editor is the place for individually outfitting all Apes. We have hand-drawn all 168 Ape trait layers which allows us to create unique and high-quality meme assets in our editor.\nWe built in a feature to allow certain items only for specific BAYC ID’s, for example regional communities, like Dubai Apes.\n\n![img7](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/8/85f470e11a6219f90740846cfd2eb550bce4d982.png)\nSource: ApeFacingApes.com, Editor\n \n### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = 259,000$USD in ApeCoin.\n![img8](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/8/8cbd66aff2295e7359e4256793d9db0e1e5384f4.png)\n![img9](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/d/df4eb0b275f81835e6e17b2846593c07f9699785.png)\n\nBy supporting this AIP you will deliver instant utility to all Ape holders and with it to the whole Ape ecosystem.\nYou will unlock the power of memes to all Apes and increase overall brand recognition. Multiplicators, such as MBA projects or local Ape communities will be supported with individual assets. The goal is to grow together, always staying relevant.\n![img10](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/2/2897bfcc76aa42dfbe9890b55c5cd1ad1adb4869.png)\n\n\n### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal:https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-482-resubmission-aip430-apefacingapes-amplifying-the-ip-usage-of-bayc-and-generating-value-for-the-entire-ape-ecosystem/24819\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

Clip will be captured and Audiograms can be repurposed as shorts ApeCoin Youtube.\n\n4.  ApeChain will become the home of Coffee with Captain\nThrough a multi-phased approach we will migrate all of our future published content to be hosted on ApeChain. Beginning with our [weekly show summary](https://dgen.network/coffee-with-captain-recap-week-24-6-10-6-14/)\nPotentially a fork of [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz) or [Paragraph](https://paragraph.xyz)\nTo be clear, this proposal does not take into consideration the development of, or funding of an on-chain publishing platform, rather a commitment to making ApeChain our home for published content and we’d love to work with others in the community who build the platform.\n\n5. With a partnership in place Cap & Steve will actively seek news and events from the ApeChain community to discuss organically on CwC throughout the week, in addition to the Made By ApeCoin Monday segment.\n\n6.

Hopefully this idea inspires other content creators to work closely with the ApeCoin DAO and make ApeChain their home also.\n\nIn addition to live Spaces, podcast recordings and summaries - this title sponsorship will carry over to any events in real life, and will include sponsorship at a minimum of 3 live events over the remainder of 2024, live shows are planned at VeeCon, ApeFest and Art Basel.\n\nIn total over a 6 month sponsorship, there will 52 professional audiograms provided featuring $ape and community build brand and businesses. 26 business or brands built by ApeCoin will receive a sponsored interview at no cost to them, as well as 26 ApeCoin DAO Ecosystem updates presented to a diverse crypto and web3 audience. And ApeChain will hopefully become the first ecosystem that the Coffee with Captain community and listener base thinks about when looking for a home to build.\n\n\n### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $85,000 USD paid in ApeCoin.\n\nWebsite - $500 Production - $8,500 Show Operations - $8,500 Talent - $67,500 Total: $85,000\n\n\n### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-479-coffee-with-captain-powered-by-ape-on-apechain/24548\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-438: ApeCoin Ventures ",
      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION \n\n##### Team Formation\nAnimoca Ventures, an early stage venture capital arm of Animoca Brands, proposes the establishment of ApeCoin Ventures – combining Animoca Ventures historical expertise with the community’s strong reach to amplify awareness and scale adoption and utilities of ApeCoin.\n\nIn a 1:1 matching structure, we propose the deployment of USD$5 million worth of $APE from the ApeCoin DAO, to be matched by Animoca Ventures’ funding of USD$5 million in fiat to create a combined US$10 million fund. Funding from Animoca Ventures ensures that interests of both parties are fully aligned for joint success.\n\nThe fund management is currently provided by ASCENT Fund Services. ASCENT’s role is to be a custodian and disburse funds, they don’t make fund decisions. They are licensed for these types of operations and we would set up the legal entity for this, which would happen very quickly should the AIP be approved. The suggestion is to liquidate the $APE received into cash as soon as practical so that we can match the amount in dollars.\n\nNo multi-sig wallet would be utilized because ASCENT would basically be managing fiat, so we would manage an orderly sale process. Animoca Ventures would be receiving the ApeCoin and sell the $APE to then deposit it as fiat to ASCENT, which would be matched with $5m of Animoca Ventures funds.\n\n##### Investment Ventures\nBy investing together into early web3 ventures, we will drive and encourage integrated utilities and adoption for ApeCoin – leveraging our venture expertise to the community’s energy, reach, as well as opportunities, to generate long-term value for ApeCoin DAO and its relevant ecosystem.\n\nOur investment strategy targets seed and Series A stage start-ups, prioritizing those that can integrate ApeCoin into their ecosystem with the goal of increasing the value, utilities, use cases, synergies, network effect and influences of ApeCoin.\n\n##### Scope of Operations\nAnimoca Ventures team will be responsible for the daily operations of ApeCoin Ventures, including but not limited to the following areas:\n* Investment & Acceleration: Besides investments, ApeCoin Ventures will play a critical role in supporting Web3 ventures like the role of an accelerator such as providing funding, research, and operational support to help founders scale their projects from the early stages.\n* Research and Due Diligence: ApeCoin Ventures has a deep understanding of blockchain technology, cryptography, security and protocols. It provides research and due diligence support to help founders navigate the complexities of various Web3 business models, programs and technologies.\n* Tokenomics & Governance: Tokenomics advisory is one of the core pillars of Animoca Brands. It involves a great amount of industry expertise and trade secrets to excel to design token models that incentivize desired behavior, align with the goals of the project and ensure project sustainability. Governance models will also be examined for business performance uplift, risk mitigation and long-term success.\n* Partnerships & Collaborations: ApeCoin Ventures will be able to leverage Animoca Brands network to help ventures connect to and collaborate with other projects, investors, and ecosystem partners to achieve their goals. These partnerships can provide access to new technologies, markets, communities, and expertise, helping them to scale and innovate more quickly.\n\n##### Exit Strategies\nUpon successful exits, 50% of the token proceeds will be sent back to ApeCoin DAO, with the plan (or an option) to convert profits back into ApeCoin. This approach aims to boost ApeCoin’s utility and adoption, leveraging our expertise in venture capital alongside the vibrant energy of the community.\n\nAnimoca Brands has had a history of successful web3 investments in the space some of them can be seen at https://www.animocabrands.com/investment-portfolio and https://animoca.ventures. Notable investments include [The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/), [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com) (Sky Mavis), [Pixels](https://www.pixels.xyz), [Heroes of Mavia](https://www.mavia.com), [xAI](https://x.ai), [TON](https://ton.org), [Immutable](https://www.immutable.com), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology), [Berachain](https://www.berachain.com), [YGG](https://www.yieldguild.io)and many others including of course [Yuga Labs](https://yuga.com).\n\nThe investment exit strategies are diverse and evolving. Besides traditional exit methods like M&A and IPOs (e.g. Coinbase went public in 2021), there are Web3 specific means like token launches and community-driven liquidity events.\n\nIn the event of a “web3 exit” (i.e. token launch) we would liquidate the proceeds/profits and use it to repurchase ApeCoin on market and return it as $APE to the DAO. It is 50% of all token proceeds because 50% is funded by the DAO.\n\nThe fund will receive returns in Tokens which it then proposed to swap into ApeCoin and return to the Foundation as per the proposal. It doesn’t receive gross revenues as it’s not your classical operating business.\n\nIn other words if the project were to receive 100 tokens worth $1 where it to sell them it would propose to use the $100 dollars to buy $APE and return the $APE.\n\nIf the Foundation desires to have us monetize the 100 tokens and then return it in fiat as $100 it could be possible but was not what was proposed.\n\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nHere is a summary of the proposed investment details:\n* Animoca Ventures matches the funding on a 1:1 basis with US$5 million in fiat, together with ApeCoin DAO funding of another US$5 million in the form of $APE.\n* ApeCoin DAO will receive 50% of all token proceeds upon successful venture exits in the form of $APE for future ecosystem grants\n* Two-year timeline of fund deployment. Any remaining or unused $APE will be returned to the ApeCoin DAO treaury should the fund not be deployed within the stipulated timeline.\n* The targeting check sizes are between US$100,000 to $250,000 per startup which would facilitate backing potentially up to 80 ventures at seed/Series A stages – curated to the highest standards\n* A low management fee of one percent (1%) will be charged for project vetting, due diligence, ecosystem support, partnership outreach, and other services rendered by Animoca Ventures to carry out the required operations. It is 1% of the total and would be charged out of the total amount i.e. $10m (half of which is contributed by us). This is an annual management fee and as the fund intends to operate for 2 years it would amount to 100k per year and effectively 50k a year for the funds from the DAO. There are no performance fees charged for the $5 million contribution for the DAO, normally funds operate on a 2/20 structure i.e. 2% management fee and 20% share of profits but for the purposes of this proposal we will not be charging this.\n* Exposure of APECOIN to a variety of promising startup and companies\n* Growth of the APECOIN ecosystem as startups and companies who receive funding may choose to engage or support APECOIN initiatives such as adding utility and/or integrate APECHAIN for example\n* The matching investment structure means we guide promising ventures closely through sizable joint ownership influence and incentive alignment. We focus this strategic guidance to:\n* Align platform visions to grow $APE utilities and ApeCoin ecosystem benefits.\n* Integrate token models driving measurable adoption.\n* Forge partnerships that bring mutual value across investor-ventures.\n\nWith our investment matching, operating expertise and focus on early stage deals, we aim to increase $APE utility awareness and accelerate expansion of the ApeCoin ecosystem through promising, synergistic projects.\n\nThe following benefits are expected as a result of this proposed partnership from the perspective of ApeCoin DAO:\n* More ApeCoin utilities will be attained with a wider adoption of ApeCoins within ApeCoin ecosystem and beyond.\n* An expanded, more diverse and amplified ApeCoin ecosystem, in which more projects, partners, entities and use cases are expected.\n* As a natural consequence of the scaled-up ApeCoin ecosystem, network expansion with strong impact will be further amplified as the investments and partnerships offer access to a broader network of potential users, customers, and collaborators.\n* More credibility and trust will be built among potential users, investors, and the broader Web3 community.\n* The investments and partnerships often involve resource sharing, whether it’s funding, technology or infrastructure. This can significantly reduce costs and accelerate growth for both ApeCoin DAO and the startups.\n* Ventures and partnerships can increase global visibility for ApeCoin ecosystem, leading to an elevated global presence.\n* The collaborations and ventures can contribute to innovation, ApeCoin adoption, as well as the uptake of Web3, in various regions and sectors by utilizing the assets and networks of partner companies.\n* Web3 Enterprise Service Capabilities: Partnerships can help build Web3 enterprise service capabilities with global commercial applicability, which can be deployed to support technology advancements in various regions.\n* ApeCoin Ventures can help build Web3 enterprise service capabilities with global commercial applicability, which can be deployed to support technology advancements in various areas.\n* ApeCoin will become the hub for innovation to nurture the Web3 ecosystem and bring in extensive capabilities from partners, fostering a broad portfolio of investments.\n* ApeCoin DAO will have the access to expertise in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space to navigate the complex and ever-evolving Web3 ecosystem. This will ultimately bring forth a more mature and healthier ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\n### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $5,000,000 USD.\n\n* Total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund will be US$5 million dollars paid in $APE at the time of transfer (assuming the date was 5/20/2024 that would be 4,130,466 ApeCoin)\n* US$5 million worth of $APE will be matched with US$5 million in fiat by Animoca Ventures, with a report of Animoca’s financial postion (indicating its ability to contribute matching funding) found here.\n* We do not anticipate raising any third-party capital.\n* The suggestion is to liquidate the $APE received into cash as soon as practical so that Animoca Ventures can match the amount in dollars.\n* We could be open to receiving funding in tranches, but it would then mean we would only match our funding amounts in a similar fashion (i.e. if we receive 1M$ worth of APE we would match it with 1M$ of FIAT/USD/USDC at that time).\n* No funds gained as a result of ApeCoin Ventures investment strategies would be used for voting, as they would be sold for the purposes of investment.\n\n### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-438-apecoin-ventures/23550\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",

      "title": "AIP-425: Ape Hospitality Group: ApeCoin Summit ",
      "content": "### ABSTRACT\nThis proposal provides accommodation at the AAA 4 Diamond Hotel ‘Wyndham Grand Clearwater Beach’.\n\nProviding an extravaganza stay (for up to 300 $APE holders on a first-come first-served basis) by the scenic gulf shore. With crystal clear blue water and white sand beaches, this could be an annual gathering space for ApeCoin DAO members to party. This proposal gives up to 300 community members a place to stay in the AAA 4 Diamond hotel “Wyndham Grand Clearwater Beach” for hosting Apecoin and Bored Apes parties, just in case someone is seasick of the Yacht Club parties.\n\nOwnership of ApeCoin will be verified through a digital wallet check at registration, minimum ApeCoin requirements are as follows:\n* 1 $APE = entry to conference and party.\n* 1000 $APE staked = 1 hotel room based on a first come first basis.\n* 2 Presidential suites will be giveaways for two lucky ApeCoin holders during the event.\n\nLocation: 100 Coronado drive Clearwater Florida USA\n\nhttps://www.wyndhamgrandclearwater.com/\n\n![Screenshot 2024-07-04 at 5.07.04 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreigqddl724kua3jqcvfqftv6fw5q6wm3pnlvlxe6noo6urqtfmcumu)\n    \n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/1700d7d003c7b3e0a0ba5e3de9c3932b6d1308f2.jpeg)\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/d/d6c85bcfeb5e1579b4a8a05e8c4b44736af7ec02.jpeg)\n\n\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nApe Hospitality Group aims to host a DAO only conference with $ape holders and partner communities under one roof focused on the DAO brand apart from Yuga Labs. There’s a huge misconception that still exist, many people hesitate to get involve with the DAO because they still think its just for BAYC holders. Such conferences without a high barrier of entry will create a more welcoming and IRL impact for all $ape holders.\n\nThrough this, people can interact with each other directly as well as various working groups, create bonds and get a wider idea of what we as Apecoin DAO are doing. Everyone (pending capacity) who holds $APE gets to experience the club parties at the hotel. We’ve seen a major fomo among every community outside Bored Apes during Apefest, even with the recent announcement. With this proposal, Ape Hospitality Group aims to make a place for all $ape holders to meet, party and hang out with fellow DAO members. This will help the DAO grow the unique number of holders, and give a sense of belongingness.\n\nThe main attraction will be Apecoin DAO panels with different Working Groups (who may opt in to participate), pop-up stalls for MBA licensees and booths.This will be an exclusive DAO conference for community members and builders to get together and interact with each other. Share alphas, create memories and build.\n\nKey Benefits Summary\n* Conference and get together for $Ape holders\n* Panel discussion\n* Networking with a wider $ape ecosystem\n* Pop up stalls and booth for MBA products\n* Party!\n\n\n### OVERALL COST \nThe total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $300,000 USD to be paid in $APE.\n\nBreakdown:\n* Booking: $184,000 (Rooms: $109,000 & Conference Hall: $75,000)\n* Media and Entertainment: $50,000\n    * Photography/Videography\n    * Music/DJ\n    * Lights\n    * Merchandise\n    * Catering\n* Operations: $66,000\n    * Administration\n    * Marketing\n    * Contingency\n    * Insurance\n* Additional costs are included in each implementation step as detailed above.\n\nThe AIP covers a 1-night stay for 300 $APE holders, first come first served. The author will check proof of holding $APE for interested people within the DAO.\n\n\n### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-425-ape-hospitality-group-apecoin-summit/23276\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP.

      "title": "AIP-450: NFT Event Check-in Solution based on ApeChain ",
      "content": "### ABSTRACT\nThis proposal aims to introduce an NFT event check-in solution based on ApeChain, combining hardware products (NFC chips and scanners) and software products (an app based on ApeChain) to provide NFT holders with an immersive experience at all NFT offline events.\n\n*Specific Implementation Plan:*\n\nIn terms of hardware products, we will use NFC technology combined with RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) to embed NFC chips into peripheral products, including clothing, hats, toys, and skateboards. We will also design and manufacture NFC scanners to detect products with NFC chips and read selected NFT image data in an app based on ApeChain, then display on a large screen to realize the conceptual scenario of NFT as our web3 identity and participate in real offline events. Simultaneously, scanners will also be used to support the “Unmanned check-in” model in Merch stores.\n\nIn terms of software products, we will develop an app based on ApeChain, offering features such as wallet connecting, NFT selection, and animated scene corresponding to the ticket you purchased. The app will provide a user-friendly interface for NFT holders to easily use the check-in system. All check-in animations can be individually created and saved by users, forming a unique user-generated content (UGC) culture, which also makes it easier to spread within communities and out of the web3. For event organizers, animating event tickets to become a unique background for attendees can help expand the brand’s influence and generate much higher traffic than traditional marketing methods.\n\nThis solution will fully leverage the image of all NFTs, providing NFT holders with a more immersive experience and enriching existing methods of peripheral product distribution. It will create unique and native web3 gameplay during the offline events and provide all NFTs with more practical value beyond avatars.\n\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThe proposed NFT event check-in solution will bring several benefits to the APECHAIN ecosystem:\n\n* Enhanced Adoption and Engagement: By providing NFT holders with an immersive experience at web3 offline events, the solution will increase adoption and engagement within the $APE ecosystem. NFT holders will feel more connected to the ecosystem and be incentivized to participate in events and activities.\n* Increased Visibility and Recognition: The innovative nature of the check-in solution, coupled with its use of ApeChain, will enhance the visibility and recognition of $APE in the broader market. This will attract more users, projects, and potential collaborators to the ecosystem, driving its growth and fostering a vibrant community.\n* Diversification of Use Cases: The check-in solution will demonstrate the versatility of $APE beyond where we are right now, showcasing its potential in the realm of NFT event management and engagement. This diversification of use cases will attract new projects and investors to $APE, expanding its reach and utility.\n\nOverall, the NFT event check-in solution will contribute to the growth and development of the APE CHAIN ecosystem, defining APE CHAIN as the primary chain for all NFTs and continuously providing value for all $APE holders.\n\n\n\n### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = 480,000 $APE The specific allocation is as follows:\n\n1. Hardware Design and Production (50% of the budget, 240,000 $APE):\n* NFC Chip Design and Production: 100,000 $APE\n    * Design and Customization: 80,000 $APE\n    * Production and Assembly: 20,000 $APE\n* NFC Scanner Development and Production: 120,000 $APE\n    * Design and Development: 80,000 $APE\n    * Production and Assembly: 40,000 $APE\n* Display Equipment: 20,000 $APE\n\n2. Software Development and Testing (40% of the budget, 192,000 $APE):\n* APP Development: 115,200 $APE\n    * Front-end Development: 38,400 $APE\n    * Back-end Development: 38,400 $APE\n    * Blockchain Integration and Smart Contract Development: 38,400 $APE\n* Application Testing and Optimization: 48,000 $APE\n    * Functional Testing: 19,200 $APE\n    * Security Testing: 19,200 $APE\n    * User Experience Optimization: 9,600 $APE\n* Entrance Animation Creation and Display Function: 28,800 $APE\n    * Animation Design and Development: 19,200 $APE\n    * Animation Display Technology Integration: 9,600 $APE\n\n3. User Testing, Promotion, and Launch (10% of the budget, 48,000 $APE):\n* User Testing and Feedback Collection: 19,200$APE\n    * User Testing Planning and Execution: 9,600 $APE\n    * User Feedback Collection and Analysis: 9,600 $APE\n* Product Promotion and Marketing: 19,200 $APE\n    * Social Media Marketing: 9,600 $APE\n    * Online and Offline Event Promotion: 9,600 $APE\n* Launch Preparation and Support: 9,600 $APE\n    * Platform Launch Preparation: 4,800 $APE\n    * Technical Support and Maintenance: 4,800 $APE\n\nThis detailed description of fund allocation will ensure the smooth development, testing, and promotion of both hardware and software products, guarantee the high quality and user satisfaction of the final product.\nWe do not have an estimate of costs for users to use the app’s features at the moment; we will know the cost range once the app development is complete and we begin the user testing phase.\n\n##### APECOIN REVENUE MODEL:\nSingle Instance Revenue Forecast\n\n![Screenshot 2024-07-04 at 4.58.59 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreifltrbdt2idzmxfeipb6il7veqa5nzfw3lagkxvj2hh6snljhq2a4)\n    \n##### Total Revenue:* 120,000 $APE + Total Revenue * 1%\n\nThis table clearly outlines the revenue forecast for a single instance, providing a comprehensive view of the potential earnings from our proposed solution.\n\n*50% of gross revenues will be returned to APECOIN DAO, in perpetuity.\n\nNOTE:\n* Fees will be charged for the services provided by the check-in solution and “Unmanned check-in” model, and only $APE will be used for payment.\n* Offline merch stores adopting the “Unmanned check-in” model can only be paid with $APE.\n* NFC customization will be charged separately and paid for using $APE.\n* $APE will be consumed in the APP as Gas fee\n\nBy implementing this proposal, APECOIN will establish a robust check-in solution that benefits NFT holders, drives revenue growth, and expands its influence in the web3 space.\n\n\n\n### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-450-nft-event-check-in-solution-based-on-apechain/24230\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\n\nLaughing Ape won’t just talk about “Mass Adoption” of $APE and $APE Chain as theoretical possibilities, WE WILL ACTUALLY BRING ABOUT MASS ADOPTION TO THE NORMIES who will use $APE for their everyday Laughing Ape purchases and perks.\n\nWhat’s the point?\n\nComedy Clubs, events, and content distribution are stuck in the past using the same tired old methods they used decades ago and yet it’s still a multibillion dollar a year industry.\n\nLaughing Ape will bring live stand-up performance kicking and screaming into the present and the future utilizing live-streaming, Metaverse simulcasting and NFTs/Blockchain to enhance the performances, merch offerings and distribution models.\n\nWe’ve already shown you how much fun a Laughing Ape event can be, now we’re asking for the funding to take our concepts and build a global comedy performance and distribution empire!\n\nWe’re proud of our accomplishments and footprint in Web3 and now we want to scale our operations to a much larger audience: Comedy lovers who pay to watch comedy, whether they’re in Web2, Web3 or living off the grid, only coming into town for supplies and entertainment,\n\nLaughing Ape will be their number one choice for comedy performance IRL, Live-Streaming, Simulcast in the Metaverse or appearing on their favorite streaming service or movie screen.\n\nIn supporting our AIP, $APE Coin DAO will go down in history as the reason Laughing Ape became the global powerhouse in comedy for many decades to come.\n\nHow will this benefit $APE DAO?\n\nIn addition to getting 6.9% of gross revenue in perpetuity (in other words “4Eva!”), Laughing Ape will make $APE DAO and $APE Coin and even $APE Chain a household name.\n\nSeeing “Powered By $APE Coin” alongside A-list comedians and global, infinitely scaling live events is, dare I say, even more valuable to the DAO than the rev share.\n\nFunding Laughing Ape’s proposal will also show the DAO voters have the appetite to swing big and make things happen.\n\nSure, sitting on a pile of $APE like Scrooge McDuck is fun, but spreading that $APE out into various enterprises that touch, not just Web3, but also communities outside of our great, little community will spread awareness, emotional attachment to our $APE brand and bring new members into our DAO.\n\nIn other words: LFG out and make people fall in love with $APE and making them laugh day in and day out is a valuable way to do it!\n\nTL;DR Again!\n* Massive comedy events streamed live to movie theaters across the globe!\n* Hundreds of Laughing Ape Membership Chapters across the globe with regular comedy events!\n* All events streamed live to a global online audience!\n* The biggest, bestest $APE-themed Comedy Club Metaverse in the world!\n* An international comedy school with online and IRL classes!\n* Check this out: We’re giving $APE Coin DAO 6.9% of Laughing Ape’s revenues for-freaking ever!\n* All shows branded as “Powered by $APE Coin”!\n* We’ll look to collaborate and partner with the best and brightest of Web3 companies/organizations like Mocaverse (Aaron’s a holder), Wicked Craniums/TruSTUB (Aaron’s a holder), BAYC MBA’s (Aaron’s a holder and an MBA License holder), Mocaverse and Sandbox (Aaron’s a Holder of both), JRNY Club (You guessed it, Aaron’s a holder).\n\nNow let’s dive a little deeper, shall we?\n\nLaughing Ape Builds A Global, Freaking Comedy Empire!\n\nFrom exclusive local comedy club shows in cities around the world to massive A-List special events live-streamed to movie theaters, the Metaverse and personal devices globally, Aaron Haber and Laughing Ape, with the help of $APE Coin DAO will revolutionize how comedy is produced, distributed and consumed all while bringing about the mass adoption of $APE/Ape Chain to the normies.\n\nYeah, I said “mass adoption” and I mean “mass adoption” read on!\n\nMassive comedy events streamed live to movie theaters across the globe!\n\nLaughing Ape will produce live-streaming comedy events featuring both household names and up and coming comedians from around the world. We’ll look to partner with major movie theater chains as special events partners.\n\nDue to many challenges the Movie theater exhibitor industry (Aaron Haber is a Movie Theater Exhibition Nepo Baby) is desperately looking for new streams of content.\n\nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour grossed $262 million worldwide without going through the traditional distribution network and instead partnering directly with AMC the world’s largest movie theater chain.\n\nThis was a shocking and shockingly successful deal in the world of movie theater exhibition.\n\nLaughing Ape ain’t Taylor Swift (though we’re total Swifties) but we’re pretty darn sure our comedy events will gross tens of millions of dollars during the lifetime of a similar deal with a chain such as AMC.\n\nHundreds of Laughing Ape Membership Chapters across the globe with regular comedy events!\n\nLaughing Ape will open Membership Chapters in cities across the globe.\n\nEach Chapter can have an unlimited number of members who will pay an annual membership fee.\n\nIn addition to exclusive comedy events. Members will always have first access to shows, events and merch/album drops.\n\nAll current holders of $APE (there will be a snapshot) will get their first year of Laughing Ape Membership for free and become their city’s very first Laughing Ape Fellows (A fancy way of saying “members”).\n\nLaughing Ape Membership allows early access to comedy events, as well as special access to exclusive Laughing Ape events, both IRL, streaming and in the Metaverse. However there is still a ticket charge (discounted) for Members to attend Laughing Ape events and shows.\n\nA certain number of seats will be set aside for current $APE Holders to attend these events for free for at least 1 year.\n\nCheck out these fire designs for Laughing Ape Fellow Club Jackets by Clubhouse Archives!\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/9/97f04a36c2cdd1b06b212d40f83058cc16feba85.png)\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/e/e144311b056eebeecb6796773b69ea0036196b14.png)\n\nAll events streamed live to a global online audience!\n\nMost every Laughing Ape show and event will be streamed live behind a paywall and/or token gated solution.\n\nAnyone with a connected device will be able to purchase tickets to these performances.\n\nThere are billions of connected devices around the world.\n\nLaughing Ape Chapter Members can purchase individual streaming tickets or monthly/annual viewing passes.\n\nCurrent $APE Holders (which includes Mocaverse, JRNY Club, Surreal Guild Holders - more to be announced) will gain access to our streaming shows for free for the 1st year.\n\nThe biggest, bestest $APE-themed Comedy Club Metaverse in the world!\n\nThe Club below THE Club, Below Bored is the first and greatest Comedy Club Metaverse launched!\n\nBelow Bored will live stream most, if not all, of Laughing Ape’s comedy events and shows.\n\nCurrent Below Bored NFT Pass Holders will get access to premium spaces within the club.\n\nCurrent $APE Holders (which includes Mocaverse, JRNY Club, Surreal Guild Holders - more to be announced) will be granted free access to Below Bored for at least 1 year.\n\nAn international comedy school with online and IRL classes!\n\nAaron Haber has taught comedy to hundreds of students all around the world including Comedy Masterclasses at Princeton University.\n\nLaughing Ape’s Comedy School will use Aaron’s syllabi to establish its online comedy school.\n\nLaughing Ape Members will get a discount on all classes.\n\n$APE Holders (which includes Mocaverse, JRNY Club, Surreal Guild Holders - more to be announced) will have access to audit the classes and discounts should they want to participate fully in the class.\n\nWe’re giving $APE Coin DAO 6.9% of Laughing Ape’s revenues for-freaking ever!\n\nLaughing Ape will give $APE Coin DAO 6.9% of revenue in perpetuity (like, 4eva, Brah!)\n\nOriginally we were going to give 5% but rounded up to the next sexiest percentage available.\n\nAll shows branded with “Powered by $APE Coin!”\n\nAll shows and events will be branded with “Powered By $APE Coin!”.\n\nThis included streaming events at movie theaters, festivals, concert halls, arenas, everything.\n\nWhile we’re Web3 denizens (and degens) at heart, we’ll be getting the $APE brand in front of a tremendous amount of Normies coming to our shows and events and consuming our content.\n\nWe have various levels of conversations being conducted with potential board members, major movie theater content distributors and a major player in the streaming industry.\n\nWe’ll look to collaborate and partner with the best and brightest of Web3 companies/organizations.\n\n[A link to the Medium article outlining the full budget can be found here.](https://medium.com/@aaron_15091/laughing-apes-aip-424-full-budget-breakdown-16902935a58d)\n\nPlease find the revised budget and projections below:\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/13744196ee14e8c2f3cbbaf3136ff084110cf39b.png)\n\nWe have created a sizzle reel specifically for the DAO. This highlight reel captures the essence of our shows and events, offering a condensed and engaging overview. We believe this sizzle reel effectively conveys the atmosphere and success of our events, allowing DAO members to fully appreciate the impact and potential of our proposal.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lRtWoz2I-6px87B9gZZ3czuGxP913CD6\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\n4 main things\n1. Money back to the DAO\n* 6.9% Rev share in perpetuity (After Funding. Meaning we’re not giving 6.9% of our initial funding back. That would be some inception type stuff right there.)\n* Yo, Dude who never actually reads the AIPs and says “Unless AIPs give money back to the DAO blah blah” WE ARE GIVING 6.9% REV SHARE BACK TO THE DAO 4-EVA!\n\n2. Seamless $APE integration for our global customers. (Mass Adoption, anyone?)\n* Every ticket, piece of merch, comedy class, etc will be available for purchase using $APE.\n* We will look to have all Blockchain interactions/NFTs be on $APE Chain.\n* Seamless $APE integration for Normies = Buy $APE via Credit Card.\n* When $APE is used for purchases a discount will be applied making $APE our preferred method of payment and the preferred method of payment for customers who want a discount.\n\n3. Perks for current $APE, Mocaverse and other delegations holders.\n* When the AIP passes we will announce a Snapshot date.\n* All holders of $APE, Mocaverse NFTs, JRNY Club Assets, Surreal Guild NFTs (with room to include many more communities that are integral to $APE DAO) will receive a Perk Pass which will include 1 year of free Laughing Ape Club Membership, Free tickets to IRL and streaming/Metaverse Laughing Ape Events. Discounts on merch and all the other stuff we’ll be releasing for 1 year (We’ll probably extend past 1 year, but right now we’re only promising 1 year, ok?)\n\n4. Laughing Ape will create a sense of fun and awesomeness (probably a word) for the $APE Coin DAO.\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \n\nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $3,167,000 USD\n\nWe aim to raise $3,167,000 USD in $APE to fund our operations including team, tech, talent and marketing. Yes, it’s a big swing but this gives us the opportunity to launch strong and conquer the industry and return major value back to the DAO.\n\n[You can find a full budget breakdown here]\n(https://medium.com/@aaron_15091/laughing-apes-aip-424-full-budget-breakdown-16902935a58d)\n\nSources and Uses of Funds:\n![img4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/a/a1b563926fe766a9dfeef915307853c45d54297c.png)\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-424-laughing-ape-builds-a-global-freaking-comedy-empire/23330\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-440: Enhancing Exposure of Brands that accept ApeCoin as payment: Unboxing Web3 Partnership Proposal ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\n\nApeCoin is a promising concept with significant potential, but for ApeCoin to truly flourish, its utility needs to expand. Increasing ApeCoin adoption as a payment option for brands is essential for enhancing its utility. Brands that integrate ApeCoin as a payment option should be rewarded, and those that haven’t yet should be encouraged to do so. This proposal not only rewards current brands accepting ApeCoin but also motivates other brands to follow suit. Currently, over 400 Made By Apes (MBA) brands exist, but not many accept ApeCoin—this needs to change.\n\nWith a proven track record of crafting high-quality content and showcasing the work of builders within the space, our objective is to leverage our skills to elevate all brands operating within Web3.\n\n![img](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/5/521b37426fa20c919d3d739c3e6d7cf713978f62.jpeg)\n\nTo achieve this, we will categorize our approach into several key areas:\n* Editing & Production\n* Time Compensation\n* Product Acquisition\n\nOur mission begins with establishing a content calendar that spotlights individual brands that accept ApeCoin, with a priority for Made By Apes brands. This involves setting transparent guidelines, managing brand expectations, fostering meaningful partnerships, and generating content for the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\nThe Unboxing Web3 team has already featured numerous brands within the ApeCoin ecosystem. This is achieved by collaborating with brands that accept ApeCoin as currency, showcasing the physical products they offer as digital-native brands.\n\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/b/bffe23076241385d96493603843aff0a9944d603.jpeg)\n\nThe desired outcomes include:\n\n* Creating content for brands that may lack resources.\n* Producing high-quality content for increased exposure.\n* Developing a transparent content calendar with deadlines for deliverables.\n* Producing a series of videos that spotlight builders that are utilizing ApeCoin as an option to purchase.\n* Apecoin logo in all videos produced for this series, to represent sponsorship “powered by Apecoin”\n* Supporting builders within the Apecoin ecosystem by purchasing and showcasing their products.\n* Giveaways of selected brands to increase exposure.\n\nWe propose to continue creating Unboxing videos for as many brands that accept ApeCoin as possible, without cost to the brands themselves. Each Unboxing episode will educate viewers on the project and its products, providing guidance on how to follow and purchase these products, with an emphasis on using ApeCoin as the chosen currency.\n\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nThe ApeCoin focused Unboxing Web3 series aligns with the ApeCoin DAO’s mission to foster community-led projects that inject culture into the metaverse. This series will bring exposure to brands that accept ApeCoin and ApeCoin-funded projects by narrating the stories of these brands, and showcasing their products or services.\n\nBy highlighting successful Apecoin accepting projects, this initiative will:\n* Amplify the marketing efforts of these brands, raising awareness within the community and beyond about products and services that accept ApeCoin as payment.\n* Drive adoption of all brands utilizing IP from brands accepting of apecoin by presenting real-world examples of its successful integration into business. i.e. Animoca Brands, Yuga Labs, etc.\n* Generate revenue for brands through increased sales resulting from video content showcasing purchasing instructions and in-depth product/service reviews.\n* Offer valuable exposure for featured projects and the individuals behind them, promoting their ventures and attracting new customers or potential investors.\n* Attract new members to projects using their IP by showcasing diverse creative opportunities for IP use cases.\n* Enhance internal and external communication with these brands and increase community engagement with them.\n\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/1f002ea07eb0f89048157e039ceaba050b9de6ab.jpeg)\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \n\nThe total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $97,400 USD.\n\nThis budget proposal requests an allocation of $Ape Tokens equivalent to $97,400 USD to cover Unboxing Web3’s operational needs, specifically for the production and marketing of the 78 videos over 12 months as detailed in this proposal.\n\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/c/c338012f24c9266c66d59e0c657fc24a1fcd01c3.png)\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-440-enhancing-exposure-of-brands-that-accept-apecoin-as-payment-unboxing-web3-partnership-proposal/23816\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\n\n[LINK TO VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha7j6GOIDR8)\n\nThe Open Metaverse unlocks the ability for gamers to move from one experience to another and take their data with them. This enables much deserved freedom for gamers but creates new challenges for platforms to engage and retain them.\n\nIn this decentralized world, Other Page is a Player Network and Rewards Platform centered around the one place gamers always return: Their Avatars.\n\nOther Page consists of 3 primary components:\n\n1. Avatar system - Create your avatar profile page. Avatar profiles enable one-click connect to any integrated experience or application and enable you to own and flex your legacy across the Open Metaverse. Other Page currently supports 16 different PFP collections as avatars and an additional 40 different NFT collections with more on the way.\n\n![img](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/17ecef79ec3e66b3666be1b8493a0027b28f37d1.png)\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/18dac90fa5bf98ac35d81fc1d5a348968b285306.jpeg)\n\n2. Community system - Community relationship management (CRM) dashboard that enables projects/games and their sub-communities to manage their members & increase engagement.\n\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/f/fc32910aa454b9f603148546062044000ca11dc4.png)\n\n3. Rewards system - A decentralized and permissionless system enabling projects, games, and communities to reward their members with tokens and NFTs (enabled by [AIP-326](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-326-platform-to-enable-apecoin-powered-payments-rewards-for-apps-games/17725) )\n\n![img4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/9/9f8de141d957a22561ac27d6beec8d9cb1b463ee.png)\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nOther Page will drive value to the ApeCoin & ApeChain ecosystems in several ways:\n\n1. Promote the usage of ApeCoin - help players discover and transact with the various games built on ApeChain, thus generating additional transaction fees for ApeChain.\n2. Facilitate ApeChain user onboarding - currently we have around half of the active gaming ecosystem within the Yugaverse using our platform. Other Page Connect, our SSO solution, makes wallet creation and connection to any game/project painless. New accounts are airdropped ApeChain $APE to prevent the need to bridge their first ApeCoin.\n3.

      "title": "AIP-454: The BANANA Bill: Apes Gotta Eat ",
      "content": "### ABSTRACT\n\nThis proposal requests funding to support the long-term sustainability and growth of ApeChain through the creation of the “Banana Program”, with two complementary initiatives:\n* a Commercial Agreements Initiative; and\n* a User Incentives Initiative\n\nThe Commercial Agreements Initiative is tasked with negotiating commercial agreements with projects, companies and protocols committed to building on ApeChain. These commercial agreements will cover a wide array of structures and incentive models, including the possibility of revenue shares, collaborations, and other ownership arrangements. However, a key commonality will be that the terms of the commercial agreements will provide value to the ApeCoin DAO.\n\nThe commercial agreements may also incentivize builders to use community and stakeholder intellectual property in games, activations and/or protocols utilizing ApeChain, and to integrate ApeCoin into game and protocol economics on ApeChain.\n\nAny proceeds generated from the commercial agreements will be redirected back into the overall budget for the programs so that this will become a reusable source of funding for supporting and growing ApeChain. Proceeds may come in various forms, such as tokens, revenue share (fiat or crypto), stock, or assets. Given that each of these will need to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis (e.g. what wallet would crypto revenue share be transferred to), the Special Council will determine for each Commercial Agreement how the proceeds will be returned to the Banana Program for continued use during the two year term, or returned to the ApeCoin DAO.\n\nSimilarly, the User Incentives Initiative (as detailed further below) will distribute user incentives with the goal of proportionally growing the network, and may be used as a part of the overall package when negotiating the core economic terms of the commercial agreements.\n\nThe Advisory Committee will oversee both programs, including providing endorsements for commercial agreements that will be subject to Special Council veto-authority. The Advisory Committee will be initially composed of the \nmembers noted above, and will be supported in day-to-day operations by a Program Facilitator and Strategic Accounts Manager.\n\nThis proposal will create a vibrant and attractive environment for game publishers and developers, DeFi protocols, and others seeking to build on ApeChain. The commercial agreements will aim to create a steady stream of future revenue and value, empowering the ApeCoin DAO to continue funding growth many years into the future.\n\nThis proposal will Bolster ApeChain Network Activity through New Allocations (BANANA). This is the BANANA Bill: Apes Gotta Eat.\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nWe anticipate that the ApeCoin DAO will receive ongoing revenue from capturing around 77.5% of the fees generated from user activity on ApeChain. As such, ensuring the chain’s success should be a top priority of the DAO.\n\nAdditionally, the chain’s growth will offer other valuable opportunities for the DAO, including but not limited to airdrop negotiations, bridge liquidity with associated fee capture, and increased utility for $APE.\n\n##### (1) User Incentives Initiative for ApeChain\n\nThe User Incentives Initiative will provide a pool of rewards for users of ApeChain. This initiative will focus on growing the ApeChain ecosystem by educating and encouraging users to try out different dApps, with the goal of a larger proportion of rewards being allocated to dApps that most strongly contribute to the sustainable growth of ApeChain. This initiative will also focus on indirectly growing the ApeChain ecosystem by incentivizing the creation of dApps, community intellectual property, and other content on ApeChain.\n\nThe initiative will be overseen by the Advisory Committee with support from the Program Facilitator and Strategic Accounts Manager. The responsibilities of the Advisory Committee include:\n* Negotiating the size and methods of distribution of incentives through dApps.\n* Creating and managing user incentive analytics, such as growth and adoption metrics, to measure the benefits of the incentives\n* Identifying industry leading incentive distribution methods and implementing them on ApeChain.\n\n##### (2) The Commercial Agreements Initiative for ApeChain\n\nThe Commercial Agreements Initiative will facilitate the seamless creation of bespoke commercial agreements with companies and individuals that want to utilize ApeChain. The Advisory Committee may also leverage the User Incentives Initiative to optimize the terms of the commercial agreements. This initiative will be overseen by the Advisory Committee, with day-to-day support from the Program Facilitator and Strategic Accounts Manager. The responsibilities of the Advisory Committee in overseeing the Commercial Agreements Program include:\n* Reviewing Proposals: reviewing proposals for commercial agreements submitted by applicants, including the potential for value accrual for the ApeCoin DAO.\n* Assessing Alignment with Ecosystem Growth Strategy: Beyond purely economic analysis, evaluating whether the proposed commercial agreements align with the mission, strategy, and values of ApeChain and the ApeCoin DAO. They may only endorse partnerships or collaborations that benefit the ApeCoin DAO and advance its objectives.\n* Financial Analysis: analyzing the financial aspects of proposed commercial agreements, including:\n    * Potential for value accrual\n    * Costs\n    * Profitability\n    * Sustainability\n* Risk Assessment: Conducting risk assessments of each proposed commercial agreement. This involves evaluating potential risks and benefits, assessing financial implications, legal considerations, reputational risks, and any other factors that may impact ApeChain.\n* Due Diligence: Performing due diligence on potential partners or collaborators to ensure their credibility, reliability, and suitability for the proposed commercial agreement. This may include background checks, financial analysis, and assessment of past performance.\n* Legal Review: In collaboration with legal counsel, reviewing proposed commercial agreements under applicable laws, regulations, and policies.\n* Decision Making: Based on their evaluations and assessments, recommending which commercial agreements to enter, which are subject to veto by the Special Council of the APE Foundation.\n* Monitoring and Oversight: Once commercial agreements are approved and implemented, providing ongoing monitoring and oversight to monitor compliance with agreed-upon terms and objectives. The Advisory Committee may periodically review performance metrics, financial reports, and other relevant information to assess the effectiveness and impact of the agreements.\n* Reporting: The Advisory Committee charter will be made public, and each quarter there will be a transparency report disclosing the total amount allocated that quarter, and outlining which commercial agreements have been made (but not the specific terms of each agreement), subject to any duties of confidentiality negotiated with the counterparty in the commercial contract.\n\n### OVERALL COST \n\n>> ##### Total: 100 Million ApeCoin with target allocations to the following initiatives:\n\nUser Incentives Initiative: 23 Million APE in total Commercial Agreements Initiative: 73 Million APE in total Administrative Budget: 2 Million APE per year, to be paid Quarterly\n* Advisory Committee: up to 1,250,000 APE\n* Program Facilitator (including all team members): up to 300,000 APE\n* Strategic Accounts Manager (including all team members): up to 450,000 APE\n\nThe Program Facilitator and Strategic Accounts Manager will rely on additional team members and resources at their respective companies to perform all of their responsibilities as needed, staying within the Administrative Budget allocated above, with any changes subject to Special Council approval.\n\nThe administrative budget is also meant to cover any incidental costs related to the management of the program, including compensation for the Regional Community Advisors. The administrative budget is currently estimated at 2% of the total budget annually and should not exceed 3%. Note that this administrative budget is an estimate, and may be higher or lower depending on the number of Advisory Committee members.\n\nThe compensation paid to each eligible Advisory Committee member will be based on their experience and skillset. However, in all cases, the total amount paid to any individual Advisory Committee member will not exceed 250,000 APE per-year, and all compensation will be subject to a 50% one-year lockup.\n\n>> ##### Specifically Approved Limitations:\n\n* Yuga Labs may not receive any funds from the Banana Program, whether under the Commercial Agreements Initiative or the User Incentives Initiative\n* Any person that is a Yuga Labs or Animoca employee, or any project or business owned by such person, may not receive compensation as a member of the Advisory Committee, as a Program Facilitator, or as a Strategic Accounts Manager.\n* Any person, or any project or business owned by such person, who is a member of the Special Council, Advisory Committee, a Program Facilitator, or a Strategic Accounts Manager may not receive any funding under the Commercial Agreements Initiative or the User Incentives Initiative, unless such potential conflict is disclosed to the Advisory Committee and such person recuses him or herself from any decision making. Any Advisory Committee member already receiving compensation from the APE Foundation may not receive the compensation listed here. For example, any Special Council member on the Advisory Committee will not receive the compensation otherwise intended for an Advisory Committee member.\n\n>> ##### Specifically Approved Terms:\n\n* 100,000,000 APE to be used for the Banana Program, provided:\n    * Up to 65,000,000 APE may be allocated under the Commercial Agreements Initiative in Year 1\n    * Up to 23,000,000 APE may be allocated under the User Incentives Initiative in total, and no more than 73,000,000 APE may be allocated under the Commercial Agreements Initiative in total, unless the Special Council approves such adjustment\n* Two year term for the Banana Program, such that any APE not allocated under the Commercial Agreements Initiative or the Users Incentives Initiative by the end of the term will be returned to the ApeCoin DAO treasury\n* Approval to spend no more than 3,000,000 APE per year on administrative expenses, including but not limited to, payments to Advisory Committee members, any Program Facilitator, any Strategic Accounts Manager, or any other consultant or advisor providing services to support the Banana Program, legal and business costs and expenses, and other similar costs or expenses.\n* The Advisory Committee to oversee the Banana Program based on its Charter (see below) and for the Special Council to oversee the Banana Program and Advisory Committee based on the Banana Program Rules (see below)\n* The people identified above (acting in their individual capacity) will initially make up the Advisory Committee, the Program Facilitator, and the Strategic Accounts Managers, as identified above.\n* The Special Council may appoint up to two more Advisory Committee members in accordance with the Banana Program Rules (see below) so that the total number of Advisory Committee members will not exceed 7.\n* All funds allocated under the Banana Program must be affirmatively endorsed by a majority of the Advisory Committee (e.g. 3 of 5, 4 of 6 or 4 of 7) and must not be vetoed by the Special Council.\n\n>> ##### Specific Requirements of Approval:\n\n* Within 30 days of the Banana Bill passing:\n    * The Advisory Committee will submit for the Special Council’s approval its “Charter”, which outlines its decision-making process and standards, which will at a minimum require that a majority of the Advisory Committee approve making an endorsement under the User Incentive Initiative or Commercial Agreement Initiative\n    * The Special Council will publish the Banana Program Rules for (i) adding or replacing members of the Advisory Committee, (ii) vetoing an Advisory Committee recommendation, with the intent to veto only in limited, objective circumstances, and (iii) replacing the Strategic Accounts Manager or Program Facilitator, which will only be initiated upon the recommendation of the Advisory Committee.\n* Each quarter during the two year term, subject to confidentiality obligations, a transparency report will be published identifying at a minimum (i) the amount of APE allocated under the Commercial Agreements Initiative and User Incentives Initiative during the prior six months, and (ii) the number of commercial agreements entered into in the prior six months, along with the names of the counterparties.\n* The APE Foundation, upon advice of legal counsel, may structure the execution of the Banana Program as advisable or necessary under applicable law.\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-454-the-banana-bill-apes-gotta-eat/24367\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-429: Apechain for Good: Happy Ape Phygital Children’s Book/Plush ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThis proposal aims to promote Apes, Mutants, and ApeCoin to a Web2 audience of millions of Millennials and Gen Z  The Happy Ape, an official MBA #00349, is a premium brand that aims to foster a culture of kindness, compassion and positive mental health in our future generations. This AIP would directly fund the creation of The Happy Ape children’s book and plush, nfc tags, and dapp development on ApeChain creating a unique digi-physical web3 experience for both kids and adults. I believe in the future of ApeCoin and am proudly offering a 20% gross revenue back to the dao based on the initial products sold. With the development of AIP-378 I will use ApeChain and $Ape to create innovative solutions, and integrate them into the products. Bored Labs, LLC. will take on the majority of work that is required, reducing costs needed from the dao and includes but is not limited to, e-commerce site creation [thehappyape.io](thehappyape.io), add $Ape as an accepted payment for our products, develop the majority of ApeChain dapp work, and nfc configuration. All development will be open source and will be fully audited, ideally by boring security dao or in cooperation with Horizen Labs. (edited)\n\nWhat makes any of this special? Our children’s book will be one of the very first web3 books that can not only teach children and parents about the power of the blockchain, but also onboard them as well using ApeChain. The book is fully written and authored by myself. Here is a quick summary of the book below, or skip it for the juicy tech.\n\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/4/4fa2a982de08cd201b68bfb210630005b085a7f8_2_500x500.jpeg)\n\n“The Happy Ape and his friend journey on a daily adventure, gathering bananas amidst the vibrant jungle. Their routine centers around a central tree housing a precious book where their banana counts are meticulously tallied and stored. When theft of the only book shatters their dreams, The Happy Ape crafts a magical book, uniting the jungle’s apes in trust. With every ape receiving a copy of the newfound magical book, no one could lie, steal or cheat because all books have to agree. All of the ape’s lives changed for the better, The Happy Ape and his friend finally could purchase the coveted bouncy ball, playing happily ever after together.”\n\nSuch an amazing story isn’t it, how can it get any better? I plan on integrating an nfc tag into every book. Thus delivering a digi-physical experience allowing the user to scan the tag with a compatible mobile device and instantly mint a digital version of their book. This will be a seamless cost free user interaction all powered by our ApeChain (kudos Horizen Labs). In order to do all of this I plan on partnering with IYK, a premier supplier of nfc tags in the web3 space. Their mobile app will allow easy access to our digi-physical experience. This requires the development of smart contracts and a dapp on ApeChain. The development will be achieved through Bored Labs, LLC., and will be open source. I believe that open source development leads to better community adoption, security, and transparency. I have many plans for the evolution of our digi-physical experience as well. IYK allows for OTA updates, easy updates to modules introducing the user to new features like unique stories, animations and more. In addition to this experience I will also have an e-commerce site with the ability to purchase the products with $Ape.\n\nTo ensure an unforgettable and joyful experience, I have designed with meticulous attention to detail, a special Happy Ape plush, ensuring they become cherished friends for all. This plush will be approximately 15’’ in length and 6’’ wide. Many plushies are small and not even comfy. Our design ensures a warm, soft, and comfy embrace. The Happy Ape is sure to be a loving companion for so many around the world.\n\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/0/04f1f686c4ab2b5611831c4589006f0963fce7cc_2_462x1000.png)\n\nDigitizing Items\n* Permanently link a 1:1 NFT to a physical Item (shown above irl test)\n* Independently deploy Chips without any knowledge of code\n* Schedule campaigns according to specific groups of Items\n* Configure your digital experience using IYK Modules\n\nSo…“Who are you entrusting valuable DAO funds to, you may wonder, and what qualifies me for it?”\n\nLet me start off by introducing myself. My name is Kevin, I’m 37 and I’m married with 3 kids. 8 yo girl, 6 yo boy, 2 yo girl. I’m a software architect and I’ve been in the web3 space for a few years. I have run a successful software company, Bored Labs, LLC., for 3 years now. I have bookshelves full of children’s books and bags full of plushies. The amount of time I’ve spent reading to my kids and playing with plushies is measured in years! I believe in the power of community and helping others which is why I am here. My passion to share kindness and love back into the world while helping others is what motivates me to do this. I want to provide value back to the various communities connected to apecoin and help them grow as well. I hope that through future collaborations I can work with other communities like bulls on the block and mocaverse to continue creating positive and inspirational children’s books along with animated videos. I believe this is a small stepping stone that will lead to a much larger goal of combining web3 ip use to bring people together.\n\nI added a budget for marketing that will help ensure reach and the success of my brand. Half of the marketing budget will be given back to the buyers of my products. A simple marketing strategy i’ll rely on will be asking product buyers to post images of themselves with my products and reward them with $APE. The other half will be reserved for various marketing efforts as needed.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n Most importantly ApeCoin DAO will be supporting and empowering our future generations through a unique onboarding digi-physical experience that will help amplify innovative solutions on ApeChain. This AIP will help promote the use and growth of ApeChain and $APE by building one of the first dapps that will help onboard many new users and introduce them to ApeCoin. The Happy Ape products aim to give more visibility to the ApeCoin community in a positive light. We will also be reaching a new audience that we haven’t explored much of. Our products support kindness, compassion, and positive mental health which is something we could all use more of.\n\nWe’re offering 20% gross revenue back to the DAO to show gratitude and continued support back to the community. (Detailed under our Overall Cost)\n\nAs a result of this proposal, IYK has promised that they would add ApeChain as a supported chain to their application.\n\nThis would allow anyone using IYK to use ApeChain as their selected chain to mint nfts on. It would help guide the development and use of digi-physical experiences on ApeChain, and directly fund code that is open source leading to better security and adoption starting within our community. We need a better way for fast adoption of ApeCoin.\n\nI will ensure resources like artists/animators are from the ApeCoin community. With many more future books and animated videos I plan to collaborate with more ApeCoin communities. I promise to innovate new ways of incorporating ApeChain and $Ape into our future products as this is just a stepping stone for us. It’s important that we continue development around ApeChain and $APE. I would be honored to have ApeCoin DAO help us cultivate positivity into many lives of our next generation around the world.\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $135,460\n\nPlush 5,000 count - $40,756 Children’s Book 5,000 - $43,704 Illustrations - $6,000 NFC Tags 10000 - $10,000 DApp - $15,000 Marketing - $20,000 \nTotal Funding: $135,460\n\nEstimated Gross Rev Return\nMin  Book: 5,000 * 15 = 75,000 * 20% = $15,000 usd  Plush: 5,000 * 20 = 100,000 * 20% = $20,000 usd  Total Rev Share Return: $35,000 usd\n \nMax  Book: 5,000 * 20 = 100,000 * 20% = $20,000 usd  Plush: 5,000 * 30 = 150,000 * 20% = $30,000 usd  Total Rev Share Return: $50,000 usd\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-429-apechain-for-good-happy-ape-phygital-childrens-book-plush/23462\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-413: Hire a Head of Network Development at the APE Foundation ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThis proposal aims to hire a Head of Network Development to help oversee matters within theAPE Foundation, supporting our community in achieving its strategic goals and ensuring operational excellence. The Head of Network Development will be responsible for supporting daily operations, facilitating strategic planning, coordinating community engagement, and\nrepresenting the DAO in external affairs. Additionally, this role will be well-positioned to make recommendations for further improvements as needed. For clarity’s sake, this position does not equate to a chief executive officer or “leader”, but rather a critical support function for the APE Foundation and the DAO.\n\nTo optimize efficiency and create cost savings, this proposal also includes a proposed reduction in future Special Council members’ payments to offset the cost of this hire. The APE Foundation will be empowered to oversee the hiring process for this position, ensuring that all legal, tax, and other relevant considerations are thoroughly addressed and optimized. The Head of Network Development will serve at the pleasure of the Special Council, the DAO’s Advisory Board.\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nAs ApeCoin DAO continues to expand, the need for ongoing, dedicated, and professional support at the APE Foundation has become increasingly evident. A Head of Network Development will offer essential oversight, strategic facilitation, and operational management, ensuring the ApeCoin DAO fulfills its mission efficiently and effectively. This role is vital for maintaining momentum, building community trust, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the DAO. Additionally, this position will allow our Special Council to focus on their responsibilities as the Advisory Board they are intended to be.\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nUSD $120,000 per annum paid in $APE. However, we will reduce Special Council member payments to offset this cost. Effectively makes this proposal zero additional cost to the DAO up to USD $125,000 once the reduction of the Special Council members payments kicks in (January 1, 2025).\n\nAPE Foundation could use its discretionary authority to go over USD $125,000 per annum if a competitive salary for this role is deemed necessary.\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-413-hire-a-head-of-network-development-at-the-ape-foundation/21580\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-433: APE EXPRESS - Next Gen degen tools for building instantly on ApeChain ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nApe Express aims to launch the ultimate toolkit for a thriving memecoin ecosystem on ApeChain, empowering users with the tools they need to create, customize and deploy tokens on ApeChain.\n\nWith Ape Express no technical skills are needed for safe, unruggable launches. Configure and deploy your token with multiple features in seconds.\n\nStreamlined liquidity management: borrow, deploy, and lock liquidity effortlessly. Developers can deploy an LP using borrowed capital, and launch a coin with a starting market cap of $15K while spending only $300 out of pocket. \nLiquidity loans can be automatically repaid from token taxes, liquidity, or manual payment.\n\nIn one place users can create their brand identity, deploy tokens, manage liquidity, build and engage their community. (Think Pump.fun on ApeChain, but way better and less trash. For instance, on Pump.fun tokens start with 1K MC, and never have a chance to reach a DEX. With our system, every launch makes it to the DEX of choice and encourages a free open market on ApeChain.)\n\nToken creators will have an option and be encouraged to airdrop portion of their supply to the holders of the blue chip collections of Yuga ecosystem. BAYC/MAYC/BAKC, CryptoPunks, Kodas, Moonbirds and Mocaverse holders.\n\nThis will bring benefit to the holders of these collections and, at the same time, give the upcoming projects an opportunity to reach the high quality user bases that are the lifeblood of these collections.\n\nAll of these processes are streamlined in the dapp so that anyone can do it with a few clicks of a button.\n\nThis project aims to expand the ApeCoin ecosystem, increase token velocity, TVL and offer new opportunities for the builders in the ApeChain ecosystem.\n\nNone of the funds requested in this proposal will be spent on development or team salary. This proposal aims to bootstrap platform liquidity and the Ape Express marketing budget.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n1. Ape Express will give 10% of all gross revenue from platform fees back to the Apecoin DAO’s treasury.\n2. Onboarding memecoin degens from other chains and converting this liquidity into $APE.\n3. Boosting APE liquidity pairs: Ape Express encourages users to pair their tokens with $APE by automatically converting ETH, USDT, and other assets used on the platform into $APE. By locking APE in LPs we contribute to the overall TVL of the ApeChain.\n4. Amplifying on-chain activity: by facilitating fast and easy token creation and trading of memecoins, we drive overall transactions volume. Memecoin trading volume on Solana accounts for $1.2B daily, and over $120M in volume on Base chain. We drive transaction volume to the ApeChain native DEX.\n5. Enhancing APE token velocity: gas fees, liquidity loans, and buybacks will all utilize $APE.\n6. Backed by The Crypto is a Fun marketing engine. The apes you see above are some of the most prolific memecoin degens in web3. We have our fingers on the pulse of the space and can push our audience over to ApeChain. We run the #1 daily memecoin spaces on CT best believe we will promote ApeChain and Ape Express to the masses.\n7. With our novel liquidity loan system we will attract aspiring devs because of the low barrier to entry. They don’t need initial liquidity - they just need a dream and that dog in em\n\nLIST of FEATURES:\n1. Token creation\n2. Liquidity loans (initial LP)\n3. Option to airdrop portion of supply to BAYC/MAYC or other Yuga NFTs.\n4. Telegram trading bot - web-facing interface\n5. Liquidity lockers\n6. Airdrop multi sender\n7. Stake APE to earn platform-generated revenue\n8. Competitive leaderboard for hot pairs and contest\n9. Degen Analytic bots\n10. AI Website & brand builder\n\nPLATFORMS & TECHNOLOGIES:\n* Smart contracts for deploying tokens\n* Smart contracts for lending liquidity & liquidity locker built-in\n* Smart contracts and mechanisms for clawing back lent out liquidity\n\nWe have created our own set of contracts which interact with each other, giving as much fluidity and flexibility to the system as possible. Users simply pay for token minting, which is dependent on how many features they are including in the token. This acts as initial revenue for the product to safeguard minor expenses with regard to the deploying costs(the user’s token and other related contracts per product deployed), and liquidity rounding errors from the lending activities.\n\nThere are several ways for users to repay the loans:\n* Direct payment: borrow 10,000 APE in liquidity, repay a direct 12,500 APE to receive ownership of LP tokens (albeit locked until the lock period is over)\n* Tax Tokens: borrow 10,000 APE in liquidity, and passively repay 12,500 APE as taxes are generated from the trading activity of the token. All taxes are diverted to repaying the loan until completed. The creator will then receive ownership of the LP, and release it to their creator’s address when the lock period is over.\n* Liquidity Threshold: borrow 10,000 APE in liquidity, and as the liquidity pool grows from net buying activity, a loan with interest is repaid via clawback. This means the user can select a 2x with a 25% interest to repay 12,500 APE when the liquidity pool contains at least 20,000 APE. This approach is generally regarded to be safest when a higher threshold is selected (as high as 5x is available). This process is an automated repayment method.\n\nAnother product is the liquidity locker. All created tokens are automatically opted into this feature with a minimum of 30 days, which begins when the loan is repaid in full. Tokens created outside the platform can also use this feature given they make a small payment in APE tokens. The lock period ranges from 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.\n\nFinally, Ape Express will be equipped with a mass sender contract and UI. This is for any creator wanting to do an airdrop or presale distribution manually.\n\nApe Express’ GTM strategy will include a referral/discount coupon program, initially to be issued by team members. In addition, APE stakers (10k tokens staked and up) will be able to generate their own referral and discount codes customizable up to 20% referral/discount mix.\n\nAn incentive program will also be put into action if approved for a grant. The tokens with the most activity, measured by volume and holders, will be awarded APE tokens every week for the token’s creator/treasury. These metrics are reset every week to further incentivize only currently active projects or new projects to receive such rewards.\n\nAlthough we cant stop people from creating NSFW tickers on a permissionless blockchain we will have measures on our backend to hide any racist, hateful or pornographic material from our leaderboards. We can control what is represented on our platform and we will carefully monitor this to make sure we are in line with Apecoin guidelines\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = 750,000 APE.\n\nUse of funds Breakdown:\n* 400K - Reserve for liquidity loans\n* 350K - Marketing and onboarding activity incentives for Ape Express and ApeChain\n    * Contests\n    * Giveaways (SAF spaces, raffles)\n    * Quests\n    * Create educational tutorials\n    * Video content creation\n    * IRL marketing\n    * Ads online (explorers, scanners, tg bots etc)\n    * KOL activations\n    * Gorilla marketing\n    * PR\n\n1.

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\n![img](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/b/b764c011145746e696d09666fcdadf8488e72f0d_2_1380x460.jpeg)\n\nAs a team of very passionate ApeCoin DAO & Yuga community members, we want to play our part in the success of ApeChain. And we will not only support it, but even amplify it.\n\nIntroducing Blever, a cutting-edge web3 platform combining NFTs with social farming & incentivized content creation. The platform empowers teams to effortlessly bring their creations to life while enjoying unparalleled hype & attention. By leveraging social login and seamless FIAT payments, Blever provides easy access to ApeChain not only for experienced users but also for casual players and retail.\n\nIn addition to gaming, you also need fun, culture, memes, and PFPs to make ApeChain appealing and popular. Blever is designed to do just that. We see ourselves as an extended community-driven business development arm. We search for projects, support their launch, and bring them tremendous reach and engagement through social farming. Everyone wins!\n\nWith $APE being the native gas token of ApeChain we believe that bringing users/traffic/projects to the chain is probably the single most important thing the DAO can focus on in the near future.\n\n**Driving demand for ApeChain = Driving demand for $APE**\n\nEasy access to ApeChain → more users on ApeChain → more demand for $APE Incentives on ApeChain → more users on ApeChain → more demand for $APE More use cases on ApeChain → more use cases for $APE ApeChain hype → $APE hype\n\nThis is our biggest opportunity and we want to do everything we can with Blever to make the most of it.\n\nHaving already invested more than 2 months of our time and resources, we are now looking for funding from the DAO to help us achieve our goal. Let’s make ApeChain a success together\n\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/e/e5869dd3a668ec3756ddfac50ab4cb6e77c6ff3c_2_1380x776.jpeg)\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/b/be2c22a5e6c93bc7acda27e6b51d3ac7068b2f0d_2_1380x776.jpeg)\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nApeChain needs builders, users, fun & culture.\n\nWe aim to become an *ApeChain launch partner.*\n\nConsider us to be an *external business development arm for ApeChain.* Via our platform, we will onboard creators, users, culture & fun to ApeChain. We have already started with outreach to various brands and projects + we have existing/confirmed partnerships as well.\n\n*Maximizing reach & engagement* for projects that launch on ApeChain: easy access to social farming & incentivized content creation will ensure that they get the hype and attention they deserve.\n\n*Easy ApeChain onboarding* with Social Login & FIAT payments\n* Social Login will allow casual gamers & retail to sign up by using their traditional login methods (such as Google, X, Meta, etc.) - no wallet needed.\n* FIAT payments will allow them to pay by Credit Card or other common payment methods.\n* No gas fees - we will cover them on their behalf.\n\nThis combination will enable the simplest, fastest, and smoothest onboarding process for new users! No wallet, no crypto needed - a seamless web2.5 experience for everyone ; )\n\n*Powered by Ape(Chain) branding* - permanently placed in our footer for 1 year.\n\n*Joint marketing efforts* via our points system: we already had initial conversations with ApeCoin DAO members. Imagine $APE & ApeChain all over your timeline ; )\n\n*Stackable multiplier for Apes* and other partner collections like (Kodas, Mocaverse, and more) in all social farming campaigns. Making sure that our fam & frens have a headstart.\n*$APE payments* - all mints on ApeChain will have ApeCoin as their default currency, creating additional demand and utility.\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \n“Total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = 185,000 $APE”\n\nCost Breakdown:\nPlatform Design & Development: $115,000\n* UX/UI Design: $15,000\n* Front-end: $30,000\n* Back-end: $35,000\n* Smart Contract: $10,000\n* Social Farming Dashboard: $25,000\n\nMarketing & Business Development & Operations: $85,000\n* Marketing & Community: $40,000\n* Biz Dev & Partnerships: $25,000\n* Operations & Miscellaneous: $20,000\n\nLegal: $27,500\n* Legal policies: $20,000\n* Consultation Compliance & AML: $7,500\n\nNote: Our team has borne all costs incurred to date - amounting to a total of approx. $40,000. This includes expenses for the company setup, hundreds of hours of work, third-party subscriptions, prototype designs, domain, logo, legal matters, and more.\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-437-a-powerup-for-apechain-blever-where-nfts-social-farming-meet/23733\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-432: ApeCoin Presents First Friday: Bridging Communities, Creativity, and Governance ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\n“ApeCoin Presents First Friday: Bridging Communities, Creativity, and Governance” encapsulates an unprecedented partnership that signifies more than ApeCoin becoming the presenting sponsor for First Friday events in Las Vegas. We have the opportunity to place ApeCoin at the heart of a cultural gathering that attracts 15,000-20,000 visitors on average, offering unparalleled exposure and the access to creative collaborations within a community rich in art and innovation. This is a six month deal that will run from July-December of 2024, the prime time for this event. We also will be given the opportunity to renew on a longer term basis after this initial six months is completed.\n\nIt heralds a holistic collaboration aimed at enhancing ApeCoin’s visibility and embedding it deeply within the local cultural and artistic milieu. This partnership is a strategic alliance, underscoring a commitment to support communities that resonate with creativity, innovation, and progressive governance. By integrating ApeCoin into these seminal community events, we’re not only expanding our reach but also aligning seamlessly with our core mission to foster an ecosystem where technology and creativity intersect harmoniously. “ApeCoin Presents First Friday” is set to celebrate the fusion of digital innovation with the arts, setting a precedent for the role of Web3 in cultural and community engagement.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThis partnership extends beyond mere sponsorship, bringing multifaceted benefits to the ApeCoin ecosystem, the city of Las Vegas, and its governance framework:\n\nAmplified Brand Exposure and Community Engagement: As the presenting sponsor, ApeCoin secures prime visibility across all First Friday communications, including official banners prominently displayed throughout the event, mentions in press releases, and a dedicated section on the First Friday website with a hyperlink to ApeCoin’s platform. This comprehensive exposure ensures ApeCoin’s presence is palpable, reaching an expansive audience of artists, enthusiasts, and city dwellers.\n\nDedicated Space for ApeCoin and Web3 Exploration: Perhaps the most significant advantage of this partnership is the allocation of a large, dedicated area at each First Friday event. This space will serve as the epicenter for presenting ApeCoin and its array of AIP-approved projects.

These events will not only maintain the momentum and engagement generated during First Friday but also strengthen ApeCoin’s ongoing relationship with the local community, artists, and city officials.

      "title": "AIP-416: MAGA - Make Apes Great Again ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThis proposal aims to promote Apes, Mutants, and ApeCoin to a Web2 audience of millions of Millennials and Gen Z consumers via extremely popular and influential social media personalities on Instagram, Tik Tok, and Youtuber. The goal is to create awareness within the normies and introduce them to the Bored Ape Yacht Club as the best club in the world despite not having a club or any yachts, and that ApeCoin is the future of finance that will lead to financial freedom despite not having any utility or real world use cases.\n\nBy Achieving this goal we hope to increase demand for Apes and get hundreds or maybe even thousands of normies to come buy our bags. If we can convince them into truly believing that Apes, Mutants, and ApeCoin are cool, we hope they will buy them to be a part of this great community with no interest of ever selling for a profit, resulting in an increased holder count. This can potentially get Apes out of the hands of Blur farmers and traders who only buy Apes to flip them for a 0.01 eth profit (or loss).\nMAGA - Make Apes Great Again\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nIncreased holder count… This may or may not bring in a few thousand new ApeCoin bag holders.\nNew community members and DAO participants… We may or may not get a few thousand new plebs to complain about how down bad they are.\n\nMore hate and ridicule… We may get a bunch of people to make fun of and talk bad about Apes. But there’s no such thing as bad publicity right? Whether the things they say are good or bad they will be talking about us.\n\nThe idea is to convince the normies that Apes are cool and they need to be like us. To make them realize that the Bored Ape Yacht Club is the best club in the world and they need to join this club asap before they can no longer afford to join.\n\nThe only way to find out if it works is to FAFO. The more we FA, the more we FO. If we don’t FA, we’ll never FO.\n\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/f/f1323247eea99118febfcb3e55c68dd99d4abfd6.jpeg)\n\nThe one benefit I can guarantee for sure is that 1000 community members will get to claim a free Twisted Ape Treasure Chest. I have 1000 of these Treasure Chests in stock and ready to ship. They are currently priced at 69 $APE, but if this AIP is approved, I will make them a free claim to the first 1000 wallets that vote on this AIP, regardless whether they vote yes or no.\n\nWe will also include delegated voters. If you delegate your votes to another wallet or are part of a sub community that votes separately such as Surreal or Mocaverse, our dev team will get all your wallet addresses from the snapshot and include you in the free claim.\n\nI will post the winners of these Chests here on the forum as well as on X and Discord. I will ensure everyone finds out about it by making public announcements on as many Twitter spaces as I can get on. We will not request any personal information directly, however the claim will be made on our Shopify website with the standard checkout process similar to every other ecommerce store on Shopify. So mailing addresses will be as safe as they usually are as with any other order users place online.\n\nIf there are less than 1000 voters and delegates and we have some leftover Treasure Chests, then we will make them available for free to all ApeCoin holders via a random raffle system.\n\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/16049e5abe0937b53ab03433ee92e887dac91839.jpeg)\n\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/4/478f4f231c015f731cb85b3a9be6ff1b156eac6b.jpeg)\n\n![img4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/6/6ec1d9d4d140b4fb3d9631ddeb681b1f458e4d43_2_1380x920.jpeg)\n\n![img5](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/6/6229a2d0442c60f2555e3933010c4853d9b29343_2_1380x776.jpeg)\n\nLearn more about Twisted Ape at [TwistedApe.xyz](TwistedApe.xyz)\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \n69,420 $APE\n\nThe entire 69,420 $APE will be used to create content and hire influencers to make Apes and ApeCoin go viral on social media.\n\nWe will allocate an average of 10,000-12,000 $APE per month, for approximately 6 consecutive months, until all the funds have been depleted.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-416-maga-make-apes-great-again/22804\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-428: MBA Documentary Series: Showcasing the Entrepreneurs, Creatives & Networking within BAYC ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThe Made By Apes program is fantastic, but there isn’t enough exposure for the builders pushing our ecosystem forward. I’m seeking funds to produce a series of short documentaries highlighting MBA businesses and the networking that ties apes, ApeCoin, the DAO and MBAs together.\n\nFor the core of the series, I will travel to 3 major hubs for MBAs: LA, NYC and Miami, filming 3-5 businesses and a networking event in each city. Each featured business & meetup will have its own approximately 5-10 minute long episode and a short teaser. The first episode will debut about 1 month after shooting begins, with a new episode released every 3-4 weeks.\n\nI will feature MBAs from many industries and show a variety of use cases and business strategies. Small boutiques like Frens Chocolate and international brands like Bored & Hungry have compelling stories, as do projects with existing links to ApeCoin such as the Bored Brewing Company, Aaron Haber’s Laughing Ape, and the Bored Ape Gazette, a potential distribution partner for this series. The Bored Trading Co’s unique model helps smaller MBAs distribute products at events across the world, an example of the synergy being created every day by apes, MBAs & the ApeCoin DAO, something that deserves far more attention. An episode featuring Horizen’s launch of ApeChain would be a unique opportunity to take control of the narrative and show tangible community and business utility within the ApeCoin DAO & BAYC.\n\nAs a gesture of my commitment, I’m proposing that full ownership of the completed pieces along with any streaming and distribution revenue belong to the DAO itself. Also, I will only work on this project for the entire term, collaborating with apes every step of the way, from selecting featured MBAs to hiring apes for music and organizing MBA meetups.\nI’ve believed in BAYC’s potential as a modern social club since the day I minted. This series will celebrate the businesses and social capital being created by MBAs with the help of apes and the ApeCoin DAO.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThis series aligns with the ApeCoin DAO’s mission to foster community led projects that drive culture forward into the metaverse. Entrepreneurship and IP have been a part of BAYC’s culture since the beginning, and Made By Apes is the next evolution. This series will bring much needed exposure to ApeCoin funded projects, highlighting the DAO’s impact in the real world and showing various ways apes have integrated BAYC into their own expressions of culture, from food & beverage to arts & entertainment.\n\nBy showcasing successful MBA & ApeCoin projects, it will:\n* Add to the sense of professionalism & community in the ApeCoin DAO by showcasing skilled creatives & entrepreneurs, including those who have already received ApeCoin funding.\n* Potentially increase demand for ApeCoin & ApeChain by demonstrating their ties to the BAYC community and showcasing real-world use cases for the tokens.\n* Show outsiders that BAYC is more than just a jpg one can right click ‘n save, but rather a passionate community of skilled entrepreneurs building in the real world across industries.\n* Educate apes on how they can leverage the MBA program for their own pursuits, providing concrete examples and inspiration for those looking to commercialize their IP or use ApeCoin in their projects.\n* Provide valuable exposure for the featured projects and the apes behind them, promoting their ventures and attracting new customers or even potential investors.\n* Show the power of networking & diversity of skills in BAYC to foster more collaboration within the community, and facilitate IRL networking via the meetups in each city.\n* Attract new members to the BAYC & ApeCoin communities by highlighting the unique opportunities for IP commercialization and the supportive nature of the ape community & DAO, both online and in real life.\n\nBy providing a behind-the-scenes look at the innovative ways apes are utilizing their IP, the Made By Apes series has the potential to drive growth and engagement for the entire BAYC ecosystem.\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin DAO = $141,600 USD, to be paid in ApeCoin.\n* LA - 2 weeks; flight, hotel & car = ~$3,000\n* NYC - 2 weeks; flight, hotel & car = ~7,000\n* Miami - 2 weeks; flight, hotel & car = ~$3,000\n* ApeFest - 1 week; flight, hotel & car = ~$3,000\n* Music Licensing & Scoring - $20,000\n\nI will bill my time at $60 / hour, less than industry standard, equivalent to $9600 per month. It’s hard to estimate exactly how long a project like this will take to complete, but on the high end, rounding up to 11 months, my salary would be $105,600. Combined with the travel budget of $16,000 and music budget of $20,000 we reach a total of $141,600 for 11 months of production covering at least 4 major cities (NYC, Miami, LA, Lisbon).\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-428-mba-documentary-series-showcasing-the-entrepreneurs-creatives-networking-within-bayc/23445\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThe following is a proposed guidelines and clarity for the how ApeCoin DAO is to conduct a Request for Proposals (henceforth known as RFP).\n\nThe recent [ApeChain RFP](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/apechain-request-for-proposals/21139) has brought forth a need to adequately explain the conditions and rules governing how an RFP is to be conducted, under what circumstances, and what the voting structure is.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nAs best understood, there have been three executed RFPs in ApeCoin DAO History:\n* [An RFP in response to AIP-21 and AIP-22](https://twitter.com/apecoin/status/1550616722809536512), in which Horizen Labs was selected.\n* An [RFP for selecting a Cayman Islands Administrator](https://snapshot.org/#/apecoin.eth/proposal/0x5222214e742168df0297589a78b3bd346159fe88f89f536d4f273fe315f23c8c) as a result of [AIP-196](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-196-bored-aip-bringing-order-and-reliability-via-ecosystem-decentralization/10160) that was approved and explicitly stated that it would perform said RFP.\n* The [ApeChain RFP](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/apechain-request-for-proposals/21139). While the RFP retroactively had the [ApeChain Poll/Vote](https://snapshot.org/#/apecoin.eth/proposal/0xe26b5ec8c8d1d03c9ba5b4c53e8d9aa1dc38d2f4b6c44dd9c41643b11fb2b645) to decide if the [ApeChain RFP vote](https://snapshot.org/#/apecoin.eth/proposal/0xff1829f8e2fb778946ef83050858a54582da50da3de3acb67c74f5e38c1da0aa) would proceed, it still carried the same weight of whether the ApeChain RFP vote would proceed.\n\nIt was during the ApeChain RFP that the community realized that we do not have a proper framework and a understanding of the RFP process and that needed to change. As such this AIP is designed to inform the community and those who wish to pursue an RFP the steps necessary to conduct one.\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nThe overall cost for this proposal is expected to be zero.\n\nAs noted in the Steps to Implement, in the event of an accepted RFP Recommendation, the Foundation would be required to set aside the requested maximum budget (as specified in the “Budget Range” of the RFP Recommendation). Any excess funds not ultimately awarded to the accepted vendor are to be returned to the Treasury.\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-401-guidelines-for-request-for-proposals-rfp/21510\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP.

Making it effortless for games to launch, attract players, and scale on ApeChain is fundamental to the ecosystem’s success. Empowering developers (and therefore gamers and usage) requires the right technology and solutions, and Sequence is excited to propose APE Builder as a platform to supercharge the development of games on ApeChain and spur the utility of $APE.\n\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/e/ee1829da87fe2cc0fd05cf1cc87b42501817f441.png)\n![img4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/8/80098f27195e6427e21998b9841d26346b27bdc5.png)\n\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThe ApeCoin community put its trust in ApeChain to further the goals of adoption and usage of $APE and reward the ApeCoin DAO and community. Scalable content and utility are widely recognized as the best practices for driving the use of $APE and similar tokens. However, every new chain, including ApeChain, requires comprehensive technology and solutions for developers and creators to build and launch successful, accessible content. APE Builder uniquely solves these needs and allows developers to build rewarding experiences leveraging ApeChain and $APE.\n\n![img5](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/18f2f1d423701e48862903e4b0b3adf4926575b3.jpeg)\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \n0 ApeCoin\n\nSequence will not seek any form of compensation from the ApeCoin DAO for the scope of work outlined herein or ongoing support of APE Builder developers in accordance with its access tiers. As mentioned above, APE Builder is free to begin using and creating, with scalable access options for growing projects that align with the incentives of the developer, ApeChain, and the ApeCoin community.\n\nRegarding expectations of the APE Foundation, in helping to realize ApeChain’s goals, we are requesting that the \nFoundation provide:\n\nBranding Authorization\n* The permission to use the phrases “APE Builder,” “powering ApeChain Gaming,” as well as all relevant APE marks, for the branding of APE Builder.\n* Sequence will work with the stewards of the ApeChain website, once they’re chosen, to allocate and maintain a URL for APE Builder. APE Builder will also be accessible via apechain.sequence.build. Finally, we will also work with the maintainers of the ApeChain website to establish an ecosystem page that will contain complementary solutions, including the many already-created tools for the Ape Community.\n* The permission to use the term “ApeKin” as well as all relevant ApeKin marks for use in APE Builder tutorials, UI, and/or marketing materials.\n* ApeKin, ApeChain, and ApeCoin’s marks will only be used for the white labeling of the platform, marketing, and tutorials for APE Builder and not commercialized. The Foundation will retain full ownership of these marks.\n\nFor select partners, Sequence can extend a unique commercial structure which removes all out of pocket costs for developers and instead further aligns the partnership around the success of the game based on primary and secondary sales.\n\nWe are excited to accelerate the adoption of ApeChain and the usage of $APE, and reduce barriers for developers and players to create and enjoy the best games on ApeChain.\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-418-ape-builder-developed-by-sequence/23164\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP.

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/5/569a48ca40c938de4078221fd25b1eff496e46e0.jpeg)\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/c/ce27b98fa57ad845ff3c26ec6433391cc0fc43b9.png)\n\nThe proposal aims to support the Community-Led IP ecosystem (CLIP), powered by ApeCoin, dedicated to empowering web3 creators, brands, and enthusiasts in the digital ownership landscape. CLIPStarter, our flagship platform, will serve as the innovation, fostering collaboration, and driving the commercialisation of NFT IP assets. Through crowdfunding for community projects, virtual exhibitions, collectibles, loyalty programs, and strategic partnerships, CLIP will pave the way for NFT IP to transcend mere collectibles and become powerful engines of commerce.\n\nCLIP will be implemented based on ApeChain. While ApeChain is the infrastructure that scales $APE and support the growth of ApeCoin ecosystem, CLIP will become the IP licensing engineer on top of ApeChain and be among the first few dAPP on ApeChain with real business operations.\n\nWe will setup a dedicated APE Team to serve ApeCoin DAO and ApeChain:\n1. Identify opportunities with new brands and partners to collaborate with ApeCoin DAO and ApeChain\n2. Promote ApeCoin to all existing ecosystem partners to raise brand awareness and integrate ApeCoin into entertainment & lifestyle sectors such as movies, video games as skin, traits, characters, F&B, etc.\n3. Proactively develop high-end collectables with existing brand partners, exclusively for ApeCoin DAO members\n4. Develop pinnacle experience with brand partners, exclusively available to ApeCoin DAO members.\n5. Connect Made-By-Ape (MBA) products with sales channels and promote brand awareness for MBA builders.\n6. To encourage ApeCoin holders to migrate their $APE to ApeChain, our loyalty system shall provide a multiplier to our participants who holds $APE on ApeChain.\n7. A CLIP ecosystem grant will be setup to provide initial funds for qualified creators if they are willing to\n    * Adopt ApeChain as the core blockchain infrastructure technology to their projects, and/or\n    * include and promote ApeCoin in their projects (subject to ApeCoin DAO final approval);\n\nAny projects receiving the CLIP ecosystem grant will have to contribute a certain percentage of their Net Revenue to the Ape Foundation \nThis will be able to attract high quality projects, as well as strong Web3 communities such as Mocaverse, Pudgy Penguin, etc., to the CLIP and APE ecosystem.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nCLIP will provide a platform for any builders to showcase and promote their IP and projects, fostering collaboration and driving innovation within the ApeCoin DAO ecosystem. By empowering creators and brands to leverage the power of NFTs, CLIP will attract new users and drive adoption of ApeCoin as a valuable digital asset. Additionally, by facilitating partnerships and collaborations, CLIP will enhance the visibility and credibility of ApeCoin DAO, positioning it as a hub for digital creativity and innovation. Since ApeCoin aims to be the leader of Web3, this platform powered by ApeCoin will help build IPs around it and make ApeCoin achieve its goals. This will also be a very powerful business applications running on ApeChain and help driving the growth of the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\nApeCoin Foundation shall receive:\n* 50% of the Net Revenue generated by the APE Team\n* Branding Integration opportunities into all the CLIP’s featured projects that potentially will create millions of impressions, as a means to promote ApeCoin and ApeChain.\n* Revenue contributions from projects supported by the CLIP ecosystem grant.\n* 500 limited-edition branded collectables, licensed with Mocaverse NFT, will be distributed to ApeCoin DAO’s community members as exclusive rewards.\n* 500 limited-edition branded collectables licensed with BAYC NFT, will be distributed to ApeCoin DAO’s community members as exclusive rewards.\n* 50 conference tickets hosted by CLIP, providing ApeCoin DAO with opportunities to engage with industry leaders and stakeholders.\n* All these collectables and tickets will be distributed to the top 1,000 active ApeCoin DAO’s participants based on the CLIP’s loyalty system. Anyone holding $APE on ApeChain will receive a multiplier.\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund: 2,750,000 ApeCoin\n\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/2/23d33a0a4439488267d01638f7249f8a709bfd65.jpeg)\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-417-ip-ecosystem-with-clip-powered-by-apecoin/22886\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-412: Streamlining Working Group Elections: Improved Second-Round Voting Strategy ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThis no-cost proposal provides a solution for an element of second-round voting during ApeCoin DAO Working Group elections that currently restricts voters to selecting only one candidate when multiple seats for the same positions are being filled.\n\nTo fix this, we propose changing the Snapshot Strategy to weighted voting, which enables the option to distribute voting power among each of the candidates you wish to see elected.\n\nIt is important to note that we are already using this method of voting in the first-round of Working Group elections. Furthermore, under this format should you favour our existing second-round standard of single-choice voting, you can still concentrate all of your voting power on one candidate. We’re simply offering an alternative for those who wish to have a broader influence across all positions being filled.\n\nExamples of other DAOs that utilize options to help voters to select more than one candidate when multiple seats are being filled include Arbitrum, ENS, and Optimism.\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n1. Improved Voter Representation and Accuracy: Under our current second-round voting format, election results do not accurately represent the community’s preferences when filling multiple seats for the same role. Instead, they reflect the community’s favourite, accounting for only one seat.\n\n2. Stronger leadership teams: By obtaining more accurate election results, our Working Groups will be formed more deliberately, empowering the community to have a greater say in selecting the best candidates for the job.\n\n3. Enhanced governance integrity: Elections and voting mechanics are polarizing, intricate components of any governance-operated entity. Yet, by pursuing changes in logical, fair, and meaningful ways, the sentiment within the ApeCoin DAO community toward these processes will be strengthened.\n\n4. Preserving choice while maintaining traditional voting preferences: By shifting to a flexible voting strategy, we can provide options to voters while still maintaining the ability to select only one candidate, ensuring that members who prefer that method can still participate according to their preferences.\n\n5. Promoting inclusivity and increasing opportunities for candidates: Weighted voting in the final round of elections will enable voters to more easily endorse multiple candidates with diverse perspectives simultaneously. This system may also amplify opportunities for qualified candidates who typically need expansive networks to obtain meaningful positions within the ApeCoin DAO Working Group structure.\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nThere is no cost to implement this proposal.\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-412-streamlining-working-group-elections-improved-second-round-voting-strategy/21502\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThe Special Council of the APE Foundation, at the behest of the ApeCoin DAO members, acts as a liaison between the ApeCoin DAO members and the directors and officers of the APE Foundation. The Special Council exists to serve the vision of ApeCoin DAO.\n\nTo further shape the success of the role long-term, the following changes are proposed to be made:\n1. Clarify that the Special Council is an “Advisory Board’’ that serves an advisory function with no corporate decision-making power.\n    * Rationale: Oftentimes there is quoted confusion in the community about what the Special Council is or is not. In practice, the Special Council is in fact an Advisory Board neither corporate officers nor management executives, and they should not be viewed as such. The Advisory Board should also not be misconstrued as the board of directors of the APE Foundation.\n    * An effective advisory board member brings unique qualities to the table. Key qualities and characteristics that make an individual effective in this role: diverse knowledge base, proven familiarity and understanding of the ApeCoin DAO ecosystem, good judgment, thoughtfulness, communication skills, commitment, integrity, and team player abilities.\n2. Special Council nominees must have been discourse members for at least 6-months prior to the commencement of the term for which they are running and must have achieved a minimum of Trust Level 2 on discourse. For example, a nominee for the Special Council must have been a discourse member by June 30, 2024 if they are running for the January 1, 2025 term.\n    * Rationale: The primary responsibility of Special Council members is to conduct administrative review of AIPs. Accordingly, it is important for the DAO that the individuals elected to the Special Council have a strong history of participation in the discourse and with AIPs.\n3. Removal of the weekly reports established by AIP-305.\n    * Rationale: It was a good experiment, but the minimal engagement metrics of the reports has shown that they have not been an effective use of anyone’s time and efforts. Furthermore, such reports are not appropriate for advisory boards.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nImplementing the proposed changes could yield several benefits for the ApeCoin DAO and its governance structure:\n\nClarity: Renaming the Special Council to the “Advisory Board” clarifies its role and that it is distinct from corporate management and decision-making. This clarity can help ApeCoin DAO members and better understand the purpose and function of the board, leading to more focused discussions and decision-making processes.\n\nFit and Focus: Requiring nominees to have a history of discourse participation and familiarity with AIPs ensures that Advisory Board members are properly suited to their roles. This can result in more informed discussions, better decision-making, and increased trust from the community.\n\nOverall, these changes aim to optimize the Advisory Board’s role within the ApeCoin DAO, promoting long-term sustainability, and efficiency.\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nNo ApeCoin requested from the treasury.\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-426-special-council-future-election-requirement-and-role-clarification/23463\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nHow would you like to own a piece of the rights to the Joe Rogan’s podcast or the kids show Bluey? That’s what we’re aiming to create with ApeCoin.\n\nWe’re seeking funding to produce audiovisual content in both English AND Spanish, telling stories across various successful genres that resonate with a wide audience. In doing so, we’re not just looking to generate financial benefits for ApeCoin holders by tokenizing these rights; but it’ll also crack open a whole new market: the massive and untapped Spanish-speaking world.\n\nAnd this project not only grants current worldwide ApeCoin holders (and thus ApeCoin DAO members) the right to a proportional share of the IPs and their future earnings, but it also opens up new possibilities for:\n\na)⁠ ⁠Creative professionals and spanish speaking audiences who hadn’t previously considered ApeCoin among their crypto options, who will now be exposed to it through the development and publishing of the IPs.\n\nb)⁠ ⁠Current ApeCoin holders, who are encouraged to increase their holdings to boost their returns through this dual opportunity.\n\nc)⁠ ⁠Furthermore, as all podcasts funded by this AIP will carry the ApeCoin brand, it naturally draws in new potential buyers, spotlighting mass-consumption content to push ApeCoin into the mainstream.\n\nWe expect that this move will expand the APE ecosystem to larger audiences interested in investing and Web3, thereby increasing its recognition and value for all.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n* The APE Community will own 50% of the IPs (including all derivatives, ancillary, royalties and direct income) funded through this AIP; the remaining 50% will be owned by DIXO (25%) and Medios Modernos (25%). By “APE Community,” we specifically refer to the ApeCoin DAO and its members. This community is at the core of our proposal and its intended benefits.\n* With respect to the aforementioned “direct income,” our priority is to first return value back to the Treasury (full $380,050 from gross revenue). We’ll then proceed with the distribution based on the 50-25-25 split among the ApeCoin DAO, Dixo, and Medios Modernos. This is intended to ensure that all parties benefit fairly and equitably in the evolving landscape of decentralization (a philosophy we fully support).\n* While it’s tough to pin down exact timelines before the project kicks off, drawing from our prior experience, we are confident that revenue generation will begin within a year after the release of any podcast under this AIP and possibly less. As an additional note, we are already in talks for a first-look contract with an L.A.-based audiovisual production companies regarding these IPs.\n* Exclusive content to help evangelize and promote APE, Blockchain and Web3 principles and uses.\n* Every podcast episode, will include a mention of the APE Foundation/ApeCoin DAO.\n* Products or Brands accepting ApeCoin and/or Accepted AIP Authors will have a free 20-second spot (as long as the product and/or brand is compliant with the APE Foundation guidelines).\n* Products that aren’t accepting ApeCoin but have a direct relation with the ApeCoin DAO will have a 70% discount of market price (as long as the product and/or brand is compliant with the APE Foundation guidelines). What we’re proposing here is to offer any member of the ApeCoin DAO the opportunity to promote, sell, market, or sponsor their products or services—with a 70% discount of the current ad CPM [cost-per-mille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_per_mille) market price.\n* After reviewing AIP-274, we’d certainly like to include the “Powered by ApeCoin” logo on the cover art of every IP funded by this AIP, as well as an audio “Powered by ApeCoin” voiceover at the end of each podcast episode, as a part of the credits. This ensures a consistent and visible partnership branding across all media.\n* A real opportunity to create a highly successful and highly profitable worldwide franchise, both in the entertainment industry and in Web3.\n* Future tokenization of IPs that can spinoff to other media, products and entertainment categories that help ApeCoin have a wider use and grow in value.\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nTOTAL: $380,050 USD\nBudget of 4 IPs:\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/b/b9986a4aae9907f3509210d31a47e865486c3aff.png)\n\nBudget of stand-alone APE and W3 weekly talk show:\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/1bee2b7c8c8ae13b6d168ce7427d5de64ed06758.png)\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-410-apecoin-dao-goes-to-hollywood/22480\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\n\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/7/719f868e21ab8302c1200db41a9d770426d0c99c.png)\n\nThe ApeCoin Rewards App offers an exclusive platform for ApeCoin and BAYC holders to access unique discounts and offers both online and offline, enhancing the utility and value of ApeCoin.\n\nFully funded by the DAO, the app enables token holders to enjoy special offers such as:\n* 2-for-1 tickets at concerts and festivals\n* Substantial discounts from over 700 retailers both IRL and online.\n\nBecause this is funded by the DAO, 100% of revenues are directly passed back to token holders, increasing the attractiveness and loyalty within the ApeCoin ecosystem. The app also provides advantages to MADE BY APES licensees, offering them exposure within the platform at no cost, and assisting them in reaching their target audience and building their brands more effectively.\n\nAvailable on iOS, Android, and as a web application, the ApeCoin Rewards App is designed to ensure easy accessibility and maximum utility for holders of one or more ApeCoin, BAYC and MAYC, Mocaverse, JRNY Club, Bulls On The Block and Surreal Guild assets, making it a pivotal tool in the promotion and growth of the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThe ApeCoin Rewards App delivers substantial benefits:\n1. Exclusive Access: Provides token-gated offers and discounts unavailable to the general public, enhancing the value of holding ApeCoin, BAYC, Mocaverse, JRNY Club and Surreal Guild holders.\n2. Enhanced Engagement: Increases engagement and loyalty within the ApeCoin community by offering tangible rewards.\n3. Economic Advantage: As the DAO funds the app, there are no commissions deducted by FanCircles, ensuring all savings and earnings are 100% passed back to the community.\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nThe total budget for the ApeCoin Rewards App is £480,000 (approximately $590,000) for two years (£288,000 for platform operation, and £192,000 for account management).\n\nThe funding term is 24 months; we may submit a follow-up AIP in the unlikely event that this project require further \nfunding. The new 24 month period for funding, extended from 12 months, in the initial proposal, allows more extensive deals to be secured, especially concerts and festivals who have year long cycles, more time to be invested in growing the awareness amongst partners and holders alike, and a strong confidence level that retail and event partners to become comfortable that the ApeCoin Rewards App is not only protecting their brand values and publicly listed prices, but also brings incremental sales. This in turn allows us to recoup any future ongoing costs after the two year term, from advertising fees we can then charge partners to continue to reach the ApeCoin and BAYC community.\n\nFunding will be due upon project passing.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-422-apecoin-rewards-app-resubmission/23396\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",

AIP processing times were reduced to an average of 16.5 days in the final draft stage, and we came in significantly under budget which allowed us to extend what was initially planned as a 6-month budget to 7 months or more. In addition, we were able to allocate legal startup costs for both new Working Groups.\n\nThe primary objective of that cycle was to increase output and develop programs that would provide significantly more value to the ApeCoin community than what was written into our original charter — a goal accomplished. Now, we’re looking to strengthen the DAO from the ground up.\n\nStarting in Q2 2024, the Governance Working Group will roll out three new pillars of what we’re referring to as GWGV3: Education and training resources for AIP authors and leadership teams, cross-community on-chain grants programs, and a delegate accelerator initiative being developed to increase voting participation.\n\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/e/e4edd7518ea6af3f5840fedc525a26663a075f23.png)\n\nFollowing extensive preparation and careful consideration, the Governance Working Group is excited to introduce a comprehensive, long-term strategy to empower the ApeCoin ecosystem by providing training and development solutions aimed at strengthening candidates going through our AIP process and, in turn, our proposal implementation success rate. This framework involves the launch of 14 education-based initiatives over the next 12 months, tailored specifically for the ApeCoin DAO. These initiatives will be developed and overseen by OpenCampus in collaboration with core members of NewCampus — a cutting-edge growth and leadership school serving some of the world’s fastest-growing organizations, boasting a client base of over 500 entities. Additionally, ForbesWeb3 will be joining us as a media and community growth partner to help put this program on the map and make ApeCoin DAO a premium destination for builders in Web3.\n\nYou can view the full APE_U program specifications [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LiSzoR3QcJ7_CSf8i7LFxHGH5kZWzEU2/view?usp=sharing)\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-18 at 5.15.47 PM.png](ipfs://bafybeie4kyjaifdwhdg6cvsp4x2mexdun4t2kl2tvwvne4brjpe2raoehq)\n    \n![img4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/9/996e029e890cf9d36b3d226c8ce55edc75d689d7.png)\n\nThe Governance Working Group has also partnered with UMA to integrate their oSnap protocol for an initiative looking to explore cross-community small grant programs with the objective of extending our ecosystem into non-traditional communities. Additionally, the program will provide support for our current market, covering in-person events, NFT intellectual property propagation, professional service provider costs for ApeCoin-funded ventures, developers looking to build on ApeChain, and seed funding for early ideas.\n\n![img5](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/6/6d3975d64d8ab9754b194e7100ff4b80294b3f77.png)\n\nThis initiative aims to broaden ApeCoin DAO governance participation by incentivizing the formation of smaller voting delegations, matching funds of up to 50,000 APE through GWG-delegated wallets. We will also pair the initiative with the GWG x UMA On-Chain Small Grants Program and, in some cases, provide access in smaller amounts without requiring communities to match funds, allowing them to sample how our governance processes work with the objective of them joining on their own after access to our program ends. An educational program will be established to cover ApeCoin and ApeCoin DAO fundamentals, and delegated voting rights will cycle every two months to different communities. It is important to reinforce that at no point will these funds leave the GWG’s possession.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-18 at 5.14.39 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreig5hbqyuzrprqsrg4vjm23hx7on7x5a2cavydfcggkpvfrf7wbiyi)\n    \n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n![img7](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/7/7bdfed686a98d90a6cd61fab15de871f6ffe0af7.png)\n* Leveraging cross-community on-chain grants and our delegate accelerator, we will target communities that are currently not part of our ecosystem. Partnering with entities such as ForbesWeb3 and Open Campus, we dramatically expand our reach, offering exposure to our opportunities and the 14 programs being offered within the APE_U curriculum, which will also include an ApeCoinDAO onboarding series of professionally produced, co-branded four-minute videos offered in multiple languages.\n\n![img8](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/c/c4023252d28544cc0a6cfba5f4d18da6db27d942.png)\n* By simplifying the process for grants under 8500 APE and establishing precise categories, we will empower the community by streamlining opportunities that the DAO has not been set up to do up to this point.\n\n![img9](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/6/6853701ed4781222be36b0e9b10aa1e7c13ed7ec.png)\n* We will better-prepare authors for post-grant success with access to mentorships and training resources which encompass managerial essentials, futures thinking and opportunities for fast-tracked access to an Open Campus 6-week accelerator program designed to provide support and growth opportunities for education-focused startups. We are also exploring the possibility of introducing a rewards program to maintain strong course completion rates.\n\n![img10](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/f/f53fdeecee61cea5256f06d703fc18dedd8d301b.png)\n* In collaboration with UMA, we are set to implement automated on-chain grant distribution for our small grants programs. This move is designed to reduce standardized administrative costs and enhance cost-effectiveness for the ApeCoin community. This methodology will also serve as an opportunity to present a proof-of-concept illustrating how allocating a portion of the DAOs treasury outside of Coinbase custody could bolster the long-term sustainability of our resources.\n\n![img11](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/9/97aa00c035bc877478b964d0af39162c5bcf381f.png)\n* The GWG Delegate Accelerator will match APE for APE in small tiers, up to a maximum of 50k, to encourage the onboarding and establishment of qualifying groups and new communities committed to ApeCoin governance (voting) participation. The initiative will also serve as an optional collaborative program with our cross-community on-chain grants programs.\n* Importantly, within the program, no APE will leave the possession of the Governance Working Group. Instead, it will be delegated from our Gnosis Safe as a governance token, with the goal of rotating access among various communities for limited durations. This approach aims to facilitate better assimilation, ensuring recognition as meaningful ApeCoin DAO contributors without favouring particular onboarded groups. Additionally, existing delegations meeting program requirements may also qualify as participants.\n\n![img12](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/1792be8ee1b86a3c54f3f43b1df241171e167fcb.png)\n* By strengthening our ecosystem through training and education resources and amplifying our visibility by aligning with premium brands like ForbesWeb3 and Open Campus, we will instill an re-energized sense of pride within ApeCoin DAO community members and raise our standards for success among AIP authors, developing new heights in brand equity and reasons to build with ApeCoin, and on ApeChain.\n\n![img13](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/c/cc8b696412b059fcba721d40507f139952b83ec6.png)\n* As exciting as all of our new initiatives are, it is crucial to emphasize that the Governance Working Group will also remain devoted to providing continued AIP processing, Discourse facilitation, Special Council and Working Group election facilitation, community rewards programs, stakeholder engagement, support for other Working Groups, proposal development, and various all of the other additional day-to-day ApeCoin DAO operational needs. In fact, as our scope expands through various initiatives, we’re currently aiming to scale by adding members to the team, enhancing efficiency, and once again, increasing output. Quarterly and budget-end reporting will also be maintained.\n\n![img14](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/e/e73c6c12f912152cc5a7115d165e3e4bce243ba5.png)\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \n![img15](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/8/8a079b44032e1ee1a062d7540d50cf3d9a34c520.png)\nThe total funding request for this budget is $1,271,900.00 denominated in APE. Of these funds, $668,000.00 will be either locked and delegated to the community as governance tokens or distributed back into the ecosystem via small grants and reward programs. Any surplus will be reported and rolled into the Q4/Q1 2024/25 Governance Working Group Operations Budget. Remaining funds from AIP-317, including repaid loans provided to the Metaverse and Marketing & Communications Working Groups for costs related to establishing their legal structures, will be reported and accounted for as discretionary funding to be used for, but not limited to, general contingency, new initiative development, community rewards, community grants, business and stakeholder development, and in-person ApeCoin DAO Working Group representation.\n\nIt should also be noted that 50% of the total funding allocated for our education and training initiatives will be withheld and only accessible to the service provider as delegated governance tokens from a GWG controlled wallet until the six-month mark of the projected twelve-month duration, pending a DAO-wide vote to determine the program’s continuation.\n\nOutside of releasing funds and certain steps of the AIP facilitation process, the APE Foundation will not be required to participate in any other areas of the proposal’s scope.\n\n \n![Screenshot 2024-04-18 at 5.11.29 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreicyaqdniakrtixocpavpehrvvxwjcrlwdqnlgx7pc3oaqgoladgu4)\n    \n![img17](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/0/0c8c8a9237f71f222b9ed8209398182d1bbee07c.png)\n![img18](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/7/78e6f4610ac17f547d94144a7db7c059ac96045a.png)\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-408-q2-q3-2024-governance-working-group-budget/21345\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-411: ArtJourney with ApeCoin: The JRNY Gallery Experience ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nWe proudly present “ArtJourney with ApeCoin: The JRNY Gallery Experience,” a groundbreaking proposal that synergizes the dynamic realms of digital art and cryptocurrency. In partnership with the JRNY Gallery, a leading force in the NFT art scene and an enthusiastic promoter of the Web3 community, this initiative is designed to enhance the visibility and utility of ApeCoin. Founded by JRNY Crypto, a distinguished crypto expert and dedicated Ape holder, JRNY Gallery is a physical NFT Gallery situated in the heart of Downtown Las Vegas’ Arts District. This proposal aims to harness JRNY Gallery’s unique position at the crossroads of digital and physical art worlds, creating a space where cutting-edge technology meets creative expression. This proposal is intended to span for one year, which will start after a month or two of setup.\n\nJRNY Gallery is not just a gallery; it’s a cultural hub, showcasing diverse digital art talents and hosting events that unite artists, enthusiasts, investors, and innovators. By integrating ApeCoin into this vibrant setting, we aspire to cultivate a deeper understanding and appreciation of ApeCoin’s potential, extending beyond the art community into the broader spectrum of digital innovation. Moreover, JRNY Gallery’s prime location within the Arts District becomes particularly significant during the monthly First Friday events, which consistently attract 15,000-20,000 visitors. These events present a unique opportunity for extensive exposure and onboarding of the general public to the world of ApeCoin and NFTs. This collaboration marks a distinctive chance to bridge communities, enhance engagement, and spotlight the transformative influence of ApeCoin in the ever-evolving narrative of digital art.\n\n[Learn more about JRNY Gallery](https://jrnygallery.com/)\n\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/c/cda6ff4e54eab3e7d04c0ea5103d1a00c91ec8f4.jpeg)\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThe “ArtJourney with ApeCoin: The JRNY Gallery Experience” proposal is designed to deliver direct and significant benefits to the ApeCoin community, leveraging strategic branding and community engagement to enhance value. Here’s how we plan to capitalize on these opportunities:\n\n- Maximizing Brand Exposure: Our collaboration centered around the JRNY Gallery, especially during high-traffic events like First Friday, ensures that ApeCoin branding and messaging are visible to a large and diverse audience. This exposure is not just about visibility; it’s about creating a connection between ApeCoin and the innovative world of digital art. By associating ApeCoin with the creativity and excitement of the NFT art space, we enhance the brand’s perception as a leader in digital innovation.\n- Educational Outreach for Deeper Engagement: Leveraging JRNY Crypto’s expertise and platform, our educational resources about ApeCoin are designed to transform curiosity into comprehensive knowledge and active engagement. These resources, including an educational video and printed materials, will be curated with insights from JRNY Crypto, ensuring they effectively demystify ApeCoin for newcomers while enriching the understanding of existing enthusiasts. This approach transcends the mere dissemination of information, focusing instead on cultivating a knowledgeable and committed community that recognizes and values the potential of ApeCoin.\n- Community Events to Foster Loyalty: Hosting monthly events specifically for ApeCoin and Yuga holders isn’t just a means to gather the community; it’s an opportunity to strengthen the bonds within it. These events will serve as a platform for community members to connect, share ideas, and deepen their commitment to ApeCoin, creating a more cohesive and passionate user base.\n- Utilizing ApeCoin in Transactions for Real-World Utility: Accepting ApeCoin as payment for gallery events, merchandise, and artworks translates the digital currency into tangible experiences and products. This practical utility not only demonstrates the real-world applicability of ApeCoin but also encourages its circulation and adoption, enhancing its value proposition.\n- Synergy Between Digital and Physical Presence: The combination of online promotion and physical gallery presence creates a synergy that amplifies the impact of each. The physical gallery attracts visitors and media attention, while the digital presence extends the reach globally. Together, they create a comprehensive platform for ApeCoin’s promotion, driving both immediate impressions and long-term brand recognition.\n\nIn summary, the “ArtJourney with ApeCoin” proposal is crafted to harness the power of art, education, community, and real-world utility to drive not just visibility but meaningful engagement and value for the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/9/9287b3b8190cc9aa43050a2c9565308cb5373890.jpeg)\n\nSponsorship Details\nThe “ArtJourney with ApeCoin: The JRNY Gallery Experience” proposal includes a multifaceted package designed to showcase ApeCoin in the JRNY Gallery:\n\nGallery Support:\n- Two full walls within the JRNY Gallery will be dedicated to ApeCoin, featuring dynamic digital art and information displays. This high-visibility placement and creative showcase ensures that every visitor experiences the essence of ApeCoin’s integration with art.\n\nProjects Accepting ApeCoin & AIP-Approved Projects Section: - Our intention is to celebrate and promote projects that utilize ApeCoin, with a particular focus on showcasing projects that have been approved through the ApeCoin DAO’s AIP process. Our commitment is to foster a collaborative and respectful environment that celebrates the creativity and innovation within the ApeCoin community. Should we decide to feature any projects or works that could be associated with the “Made by Apes” concept or any other Yuga Labs program, we will ensure clear and distinct branding and signage within the gallery. This will be done to prevent any conflation between the ApeCoin DAO’s initiatives and Yuga Labs’ programs, maintaining a clear distinction in how these projects are presented and branded.\n\nGallery Signage: - A striking, neon sign displaying “Powered by ApeCoin” within the gallery, creating a visually impactful reminder of ApeCoin’s presence and support.\n\nPromotional Material: - Informative and visually appealing printed materials distributed to gallery visitors, offering a free, tangible take-away that deepens understanding and interest in ApeCoin.\n\nApeCoin Gift Bags: -  Unique gift bags free of charge for visitors to create a memorable gallery experience and foster a sense of exclusivity and community among ApeCoin users.\n\nMonthly Events: - Regular events at the gallery celebrating ApeCoin and Yuga holders and providing a platform for networking and collaboration among enthusiasts and artists.\n\nAdvertising Inclusion: - Featuring “Powered by ApeCoin” prominently in external advertising efforts, such as billboards and magazine ads, to extend the reach and recognition of ApeCoin beyond the gallery’s walls.\n\nGallery Website Promotional Page: - A dedicated ApeCoin section on the JRNY Gallery website, serving as a promotional gateway into ApeCoin. This page aims to appeal to newcomers and experienced Web3 users alike.\n\nEducational Videos: - A professionally crafted video from JRNY Crypto explaining ApeCoin’s concept, utility, and vision. Positioned prominently in the gallery and online, this video will serve as a key educational tool for gallery visitors and online audiences.\n\nSocial Media Promotion: - Active promotion of ApeCoin through JRNY Gallery’s social media channels, ensuring consistent engagement with a wider online community.\n\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/d/d88b3f886e8a4295b0cc8072e073eb2c8713d0f5.jpeg)\n\nEvents and Community Engagement\nThe “ArtJourney with ApeCoin: The JRNY Gallery Experience” proposal places a significant emphasis on events and community engagement, recognizing these as crucial platforms for fostering a strong, interconnected ApeCoin community. This segment of the proposal outlines several key initiatives:\n\nMonthly Events for spotlighting ApeCoin and Yuga Holders: Central to our community engagement strategy is the hosting of monthly events at JRNY Gallery. These events will provide an opportunity to spotlight ApeCoin and Yuga holders, providing a regular opportunity for members of the community to meet, network, and share ideas. These gatherings could range from informal meetups to more structured events, such as speaker sessions, panel discussions, and interactive workshops. The goal is to create a vibrant, ongoing conversation within the community, strengthening the ties between members and deepening their connection to the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\nDiscounted Events for Verified Holders: To add an element of exclusivity and reward community loyalty, we plan to offer discounted access to certain gallery events for verified ApeCoin holders. This initiative not only incentivizes ApeCoin holding but also fosters a sense of belonging and appreciation among community members. Discounted events could include exclusive viewings, artist meet-and-greets, or special workshops.\n\nShowcasing Community Talent and Initiatives: Each event will also serve as a showcase for the diverse talents and projects within the ApeCoin community. By highlighting different Ape holder projects, art pieces, or initiatives at each event, we create an environment that celebrates and promotes the creativity and innovation thriving within our community.\n\nThrough these events and engagement strategies, we aim to cultivate a dynamic and supportive environment where the ApeCoin community can thrive, collaborate, and grow together, furthering the collective strength and vision of the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\nWe aim to ensure that the majority of premium gallery features, particularly those related to the JRNY Gallery website and most events hosted by JRNY, are either heavily discounted or entirely free of charge. Our objective is to leverage the funding from this proposal to enhance accessibility to the JRNY Gallery and its offerings, thereby broadening participation and engagement within the ApeCoin community.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that certain workshops and events may carry a ticketed price. This is particularly true for events that are hosted in partnership with external organizers who may require compensation or for exclusive, high-demand events where the capacity is limited. In such cases, ticket prices would be determined in collaboration with the event organizers, with proceeds going directly to them to cover their costs and efforts. Examples might include specialized workshops led by renowned artists or experts in the cryptocurrency and NFT space. The necessity for ticketing in these instances is to manage demand and ensure a high-quality experience for attendees, rather than to generate profit for the JRNY Gallery itself.\n\nOur funding strategy is designed with the community’s best interests at heart, focusing on providing great value at low or no cost wherever feasible. By doing so, we aim to make the JRNY Gallery and its various utilities more accessible to a wider audience, aligning with our goal of promoting ApeCoin and fostering a vibrant, engaged community around digital art and cryptocurrency.\n\n![img4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/6/62d22b46d38c87dcd404a144409908c29ddb5ea2.jpeg)\n\nPromotional Activities\nThe “ArtJourney with ApeCoin: The JRNY Gallery Experience” proposal includes a range of promotional activities designed to enhance the visibility and appeal of ApeCoin. These activities are aimed at both gallery visitors and the broader online community, creating multiple touchpoints for engagement:\n\nPrinted Promotional Materials: We will produce high-quality, visually appealing printed materials, such as brochures, flyers, and posters, to distribute to gallery visitors. These materials will provide concise information about ApeCoin, its utility, and its role in the digital art space. They serve as a tangible reminder of the ApeCoin experience at JRNY Gallery, helping to maintain engagement even after visitors leave the gallery.\n\nApeCoin-themed Gift Bags: To create a memorable experience for visitors, unique ApeCoin-themed gift bags will be offered. These bags could include branded merchandise, information booklets, and possibly limited edition art pieces or tokens. The aim is to provide a tangible connection to ApeCoin, enhancing brand recall and loyalty.\n\nRegarding the ApeCoin Gift Bags and the associated branded merchandise, including information booklets and potentially limited edition art pieces or tokens, we aim to utilize these items as free promotional materials. Our goal is to enhance the gallery experience and foster a deeper connection with the ApeCoin community, not to generate sales from these items.\n\nTo add value and exclusivity to these giveaways, we are considering implementing additional layers of engagement for recipients of the more limited edition products. For instance, eligibility could be based on holding ApeCoin or participating in ApeCoin-related activities or quests designed to promote interaction within the community and further engagement with the ApeCoin ecosystem. These initiatives are intended to celebrate and reward community participation and investment in the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\nAll promotional materials, including the gift bags and their contents, are designed to be distributed free of charge. This approach is in line with our overarching aim to provide tangible benefits to the ApeCoin community, enhancing the visibility and appeal of ApeCoin through thoughtful, engaging, and value-driven experiences at the JRNY Gallery.\n\nRegular Social Media Promotion: Leveraging JRNY Gallery’s social media platforms, we plan regular postings about ApeCoin. This will include updates on gallery events, highlights of ApeCoin-related art, and educational content. Engaging social media campaigns can significantly extend the reach of ApeCoin messaging, tapping into a wider, digitally savvy audience.\n\n\"Powered by ApeCoin’’ Branding: We will integrate \"Powered by ApeCoin’’ branding into various promotional channels, such as billboards, magazine ads, and digital ads. This consistent branding approach will reinforce ApeCoin’s association with creativity and innovation in the minds of a diverse audience.\n\nCollaborations and Partnerships: Exploring collaborations with artists, influencers, and other galleries can amplify the reach of our promotional activities. These partnerships can lead to co-branded events, joint social media campaigns, and cross-promotional opportunities, further elevating the visibility of ApeCoin. We will also be seeking out other approved AIPs to collaborate with.\n\nThese promotional activities are designed not just to advertise but to engage and educate, thereby fostering a deeper connection between the audience and ApeCoin. The multifaceted approach ensures that ApeCoin’s presence is felt strongly both within the JRNY Gallery and in the wider digital art and cryptocurrency communities.\n\nAdditional Exposure and Acceptance of ApeCoin\nThe “ArtJourney with ApeCoin: The JRNY Gallery Experience” initiative also aims to extend the influence and practical application of ApeCoin beyond the gallery, further integrating it into the broader art and crypto communities:\n\nMonthly Articles on [BlockNews.com](https://blocknews.com/): We plan to feature a monthly article on [BlockNews.com](https://blocknews.com/), a JRNY Club platform known for its comprehensive coverage of cryptocurrency and NFTs. These articles will focus on various aspects of ApeCoin, such as its use cases, community highlights, and developments within the ApeCoin ecosystem. This will not only educate a wider audience but also position ApeCoin as a leading token in the crypto-art space.\n\nAccepting ApeCoin for Gallery Transactions: A significant step towards mainstream adoption, JRNY Gallery will accept ApeCoin as a mode of payment for gallery events, merchandise, and artworks. This move serves a dual purpose: it demonstrates the practical utility of ApeCoin in real-world transactions and encourages its circulation within the art community. Accepting ApeCoin directly ties its value to tangible goods and experiences, enhancing its appeal to both crypto enthusiasts and art lovers.\n\nPartnerships for Wider Acceptance: Exploring partnerships with other galleries, art events, and online platforms to accept ApeCoin can broaden its acceptance and usability. These partnerships will not only promote ApeCoin’s utility in the art world but also encourage its integration into other creative and commercial endeavors.\n\nCommunity-driven Initiatives: Encouraging the ApeCoin community to propose and lead initiatives that can further the acceptance and exposure of ApeCoin. This could include community-led art projects, collaborations with artists, and online campaigns that highlight the use of ApeCoin in creative contexts. By focusing on these areas, the proposal aims to create a broader acceptance of ApeCoin, both as a currency and a key part of the evolving digital art narrative. These efforts will help to bridge the gap between cryptocurrency and the mainstream, showcasing the practical and innovative uses of ApeCoin in various domains.\n\n![img5](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/2/2b6e87929eaf6478a008956313c85b636ca798f7.jpeg)\n\nPLATFORMS & TECHNOLOGIES:\n\nDigital Displays: For showcasing dynamic digital art and information about ApeCoin on two full walls within JRNY Gallery.\n\nGallery Website: A dedicated ApeCoin section on the JRNY Gallery website, implying the use of web development technologies for creating an engaging online presence.\n\nSocial Media Channels: For the promotion of ApeCoin and the gallery’s events, indicating the use of platforms like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, etc.\n\nEducational Video Production: Involves video editing and production technologies, possibly animation and high-end graphics software, to create a video explaining ApeCoin’s concept, utility, and vision.\n\nPrinted Promotional Materials: While not a digital technology, the production of high-quality printed materials (brochures, flyers, posters) will likely involve graphic design software.\n\nNeon Signage: Custom-made, artistically designed light-up signage for in-gallery branding, involving design and manufacturing technologies specific to neon signage.\n[BlockNews.com](https://blocknews.com) : For publishing monthly articles about ApeCoin, suggesting the use of content management systems (CMS) and digital publishing platforms.\n\nDigital Content and Media Creation: Utilizing video and photography equipment and editing software for content creation to promote events and the ApeCoin integration.\n\nDigital Marketing and Social Media Promotion: This would include the use of digital marketing tools, social media advertising platforms, and possibly influencer marketing platforms.\n\nEvent Organization Tools: For managing and hosting events, possibly involving event management software or platforms like Eventbrite.\n\nApeCoin Transactions: Accepting ApeCoin as a payment method for gallery events, merchandise, and artworks suggests the use of cryptocurrency payment gateways or platforms that support ApeCoin transactions.\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nTotal Budget: 400,000 $APE\n\nThe budget for “ArtJourney with ApeCoin: The JRNY Gallery Experience” is meticulously designed to cover all aspects of the initiative, ensuring a high-quality execution for one full year following a month or two of setup.

As you may or may not know, ApeCoin is one of my top picks in the Crypto space and I’m huge supporter of the entire Yuga ecosystem. I personally put a lot of thought into this AIP and have held off to do an AIP until now because I wanted it to be something that would make a big impact by not only giving ApeCoin new utility, but also raising awareness and building community around it.\nI see massive potential for ApeCoin in the future and hope to see many other ecosystems adopt ApeCoin and build new products using it. The is the first step in adopting ApeCoin as the Aiur Labs ecosystem token.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-411-artjourney-with-apecoin-the-jrny-gallery-experience/22598\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-363: Unlocking $APE’ potential: Building a credit market with MYSO Finance ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nLiquidation Loans (ZLLs). ZLLs are a novel DeFi primitive that allow (i) borrowers to borrow without liquidation risk and (ii) lenders to lend in underdeveloped credit markets with higher yield potential.\n\nFor DAOs, ZLLs are a powerful new tool to increase the utility of their native token and to enable them to use their reserves in a more productive and strategic way.\n\nWe propose the creation of a lending market for $APE, utilizing MYSO’s v2 protocol. This initiative can offer community members access to non-liquidatable loans, thereby enhancing the utility of the $APE token. If there is confidence in the continuous growth of $APE and a desire to offer more incentives to $APE token holders, establishing a non-liquidatable lending market is an effective way to achieve this objective.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nBy using above described convertible Zero-Liquidation Loan product, it is possible to::\n* Create credit markets for the $APE token without lengthy governance processes, oracle integrations, etc.\n* Lend treasury reserves in a more strategic way that creates value for the overall community.\n* Provide a unique borrowing experience to the ApeCoin’s community, without liquidation risk.\n* Reduce selling pressure for the $APE token and incentivize long-term holding.\n* Fully customize and control the loans one underwrites.\n* Signal high conviction on the $APE token and participate in a possible synthetic buyback strategy.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\nUsing MYSO, it’s possible to offer fully customizable loan options to $APE token holders by simply setting up a lending vault and specifying the loan terms desired for lending.\n\nFor example, the grant recipient (i.e. Governance Working Group [GWG], see below) could set up a vault to lend out USDC (or any other token) and accept its native $APE token as collateral. The GWG can create multiple loan offers concurrently and define at which LTVs, tenors, and interest rates they’d feel comfortable lending. Updating/deleting these loan offers is also possible in a matter of minutes.\n\nFrom a financial risk-reward perspective, the lender bears default risk that a loan may become undercollateralized and not be repaid. This resembles a deep in-the-money covered call strategy with a low delta. It’s worthwhile to mention that the risk premium is set by the GwG and can be hedged outside and independently of MYSO, if needed.\n\nMYSO’s protocol fee starts at 0.1% and scales linearly to +0.4% for a loan with a duration of 1 year. To illustrate, the protocol fee for a loan with a 90 day tenor would therefore be at 0.2% of the collateral amount. Worthwhile to highlight that MYSO’s protocol fee is currently set at 0.00%.\n\nMYSO v1 was deployed on Ethereum in January 2023. MYSO v2 was deployed on Mantle end of August 2023, on Ethereum end of September 2023 and on Arbitrum mid of October 2023. As of today, MYSO has a $1.25m TVL.\n\nOther organizations that have successfully implemented MYSO’s lending protocol include:\n* Olympus DAO ($500k pilot project for a gOHM/DAI lending market)\n* Mantle (created a lending market for $MNT), Rocketpool (we launched the first RPL/rETH credit market for their community)\n* Pendle (seeded a lending market for PT-sDAI Token), IndexCoop (to seed a lending market dsETH)\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \n$750,000 USD\n\nIn order to enable meaningful borrowing capacity, MYSO would recommend seeding $750k. It’s important to note that the GWG retains full control over their lender vault, as well as the credit markets and loans they underwrite. The GWG also has the flexibility to withdraw their funds at any time, excluding the portion currently being lent out, or add more funds to their lender vault if they wish to do so.\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-363-unlocking-ape-potential-building-a-credit-market-with-myso-finance/19712\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-397: NFT Launchpad Powered by $Ape! ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThe initiative aims to support the Apecoin ecosystem by facilitating the creation and trading of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), thereby enhancing the utility and adoption of $Ape as a token. Puffles, the project introduces a user-friendly, no-code tool for NFT creators to launch their collections on various blockchain networks effortlessly. With an emphasis on customization and support for multiple blockchain networks, Puffles empowers creativity and accessibility in the NFT space. The primary objective is to establish an NFT Launchpad utilizing $Ape as currency to mint NFTs on the ERC-20 network, providing creators with a seamless platform for minting, showcasing, and trading their NFTs. This endeavor reflects a commitment to fostering blockchain innovation and supporting artists and creators in the crypto community.\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n$Ape stands as a trailblazer in the NFT ecosystem, representing the very essence of NFTs at the forefront. Its journey has been fueled by the passionate Ape and NFT community. Consequently, it holds immense significance for $Ape to lead the way in the NFT realm, ensuring a system that not only enriches $Ape holders but also forges meaningful connections among NFT communities through this unique token.\n\nThe NFT Launchpad emerges as a great opportunity for projects to put life into their creations, minting NFTs with the $Ape rather than conventional tokens (recall the otherside mint?). This initiative promises to draw in a surge of transactions, infusing vibrancy into the network’s overall transactional activity. The resultant upswing will not only elevate the value of $Ape but also nurture the flourishing Apecoin ecosystem. Such utilization of $Ape extends beyond mere benefits for projects; it symbolizes $Ape’s emotional commitment as a direct, passionate contributor to the thriving NFT ecosystem.\"\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $15,000 USD\n\nCost Breakdown:\n* Designing of the Whole Platform: 4k (Team of 2)\n* Development Cost for 3 Months: 6k (Team of 3)\n* Deployment and Testing Cost: 2k (Team of 2)\n* Audit: 3k\nThank you for considering our grant application.

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThe ApeCoin Rewards App will be available on iOS, Android, and as a web app and is designed to reward ApeCoin and BAYC holders with a range of rewards and benefits, while also providing visibility to MADE BY APES licensees. Holders who have at least one ApeCoin or a BAYC/MAYC are eligible for exclusive rewards. The app offers the ability to access POAP NFT drops, multimedia promotional content from partners, industry event promotional opportunities, as well as discounts and special offers in collaboration with Made By Apes licensees and at participating retailers across the US and Europe, both online and in real life (IRL). This emphasis on rewards and benefits aims to deliver continuous value and enhance engagement within the ApeCoin community and grow the awareness outside of Web3.\n\nThere’s no cost for users to use any feature of the app. The app is free to use and has the ability to gate content and rooms (Discord call them channels) via integration with WalletConnect.\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThe ApeCoin Rewards App directly supports the ApeCoin ecosystem by enhancing token utility and engagement among holders. By offering exclusive rewards, discounts, and promotional content, the app incentivizes the holding and use of ApeCoin, potentially increasing demand and value. It aligns with the APE Community’s core mission of fostering a vibrant community of creators and innovators in the web3 space by providing a platform that rewards creativity, participation, and loyalty. Furthermore, by integrating with MADE BY APES licensees, the app promotes visibility and collaboration within the ecosystem, embodying the values of boldness, equality, transparency, collective responsibility, and persistence. The next stage would be to talk more formally to each of these licensees regarding their potential participation in the program.\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nThe total budget for the ApeCoin Rewards App is £240,000 (approximately $288,000) for the first year (£144,000 for platform operation, and £96,000 for account management).\n\nThe funding term is 12 months; the author may submit a follow-up AIP should the project require further funding. This includes development, maintenance, partner onboarding, and marketing efforts. Costs will be paid quarterly, with the first payment due upon project initiation.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-398-apecoin-rewards-app/21565\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThis AIP seeks to create an extension of [Co:Create Ink](https://www.cocreate.ink/), enabling redeemable and digital-only tattoo designs to be powered by and purchased with $APE, with the primary objective of establishing a sustainable business model that:\n* Establishes a new use case for $APE\n* Creates real-world consumer transactions using $APE\n\nWHY TATTOOS?\nThe history of tattoos goes back thousands of years. Yet, in modern times, tattoos were taboo in much of the Western world. They were an art form associated with sailors, soldiers, and criminals, something you hid if you wanted a “white-collar job.” In fact, tattoos were made illegal in many US states and cities for decades, with tattoo bans not repealed in New York City until 1997.\n\nThings have changed drastically in the last two decades. 1 in 3 Americans now have a tattoo. When we look at younger demographics, that percentage increases dramatically - more than 50% of women aged 18-49 have tattoos. Perceptions have also changed, with 80% of Americans stating they believe society has become more accepting of tattoos in recent years.\n\nThe tattoo industry has grown alongside this shift in perception. By some estimates, the US tattoo industry alone exceeds $1.5B USD and is projected to reach $3.9B by 2030. For all the growth and cultural relevance of tattoos, the business of tattooing has yet to evolve.\n\nThe industry needs to be more cohesive, composed mostly of small, independently owned businesses. There are no dominant software platforms or point-of-sale systems. As a result, tattoo shops have remained primarily cash-only businesses.\n\nSecond, the price artists charge for their art is based on how long it takes them to apply a tattoo, not based on the art they create, contrary to how prices are set for most other art forms. Tattoo artists are still paid like hourly workers.\nWith the rise of social media and the creator economy, we have seen the emergence of tattoo artist celebrities. These top tattoo artists have massive social media followings, with some garnering millions of online followers. Not surprisingly, appointment wait times can extend multiple years for what are rightly considered masterpieces.\n\n![Img](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/0/0d030a94f279435a272e68c98df696c69ded854c.jpeg)\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nWe imagine a future where ApeCoin powers a sizable percentage of global consumer crypto payments. Co:Create Ink will introduce ApeCoin to new users, positioning $APE as THE method for onchain consumer transactions. ApeCoin DAO will leverage Co:Create Ink as a platform to accelerate adoption, inspiring more real-world applications and mainstream adoption of $APE as a payment gateway.\n\n2.5% of top-line revenue from all transactions paid for with $APE will be sent to the ApeCoin DAO treasury until the full allocation of this AIP is returned. Distribution of revenue back to the DAO treasury will occur on a bi-annual basis until $50k USD or the equivalent of ApeCoin is returned to the DAO.\n\n10% of revenue generated through $APE transactions will be held for three months in $APE by Co:Create Ink.\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $50,000 to be paid in $APE to create a payment gateway on Co:Create Ink to support purchases in $APE.\n\nBelow are areas in which we will use the $50k to enable a payment gateway to accept APE for purchases:\n* Legal review to ensure no issues are accepting APE to buy tattoos domestically and internationally\n* Identifying and integrating with a crypto payments provider/platform\n* Design and product management to create a product requirements doc and Figma designs\n* Engineering resources to build and test APE payment rails in the product\n* Operationalize accepting payments in APE and paying artists on a set cadence\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-400-enable-ape-as-a-payment-option-for-onchain-consumer-transactions-on-co-create-ink/21679\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-409: Voter Discovery and Coalitions in ApeCoin DAO ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThis proposal aims to leverage DAO aggregation data and analysis to identify and address barriers to voting in ApeCoin DAO, enabling the development of tailored onboarding incentives, and programs to strengthen quality participation. By gaining insights into the interests and activity patterns of $APE token holders, the DAO can optimize its governance processes and foster a more engaged and focused community.\n\nAn extended coverage of the DAO’s internal power groups is also offered as part of this report. With ApeCoin DAO’s over 9k lifetime voters, and delegates, it is important to look at the groups of voters that lead the DAO in terms of decision making. DeepDAO’s Power Coalitions report enables transparency of these groups and their voting power, and serves to protect the DAO from possible governance attacks.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nBy leveraging DeepDAO’s aggregated data, ApeCoin DAO can identify the most promising initiatives to focus on, and attract the right people to contribute their skills and expertise.\n\nBy using the Power Coalitions data, the DAO can identify its own power groups, and make them available to all stakeholders and the community. A coalition in our terminology is defined as a group of people who frequently vote together on the same proposals and in the same direction (e.g. Yes, or No). This could be groups of two, three, ten, or more people.\n\nRational\nYour DAO voters have diverse motivations and goals. Their involvement can be for short lived gains, or long term impact. Your voters are also in high demand, with dozens of DAOs competing for their attention.\n\nDeepDAO’s Voter Discovery generates a large set of insights about your delegates, voters, and token holders:\n* Voter interests across all DAO categories. Understand the full voting profile of your voters, delegates, and token holders.\n* Discover voting patterns: yearly voting, top voters, voters who stopped voting, and loyal voters, who should be awarded and celebrated. DeepDAO provides full CSV lists of all addresses identified here.\n* Competitors analysis: which DAOs compete with yours on the attention of your voters and token holders? We map your competitors based on your voters and token holders voting in other DAOs.\n* Missing voters: $APE token holders, who vote in other DAOs, but do not vote in ApeCoin DAO. We provide a comprehensive list of these voters and, by request, segment them across competing DAOs.\n* Voter coalitions: Identify your internal power groups, and protect your DAO against governance grabs. This information may also improve communication between the separate interest groups.\n* For each power coalition we provide several data points:\n    * The coalition’s combined voting power, measuring its strength in the DAO.\n    * The number of times the coalition voted together, measuring how frequently this power is used.\n    * The first time they voted together, and date of the most recent vote, indicating when the coalition started working together, and their recent involvement.\n\nThere are several distinct benefits to this granular understanding of the DAO participating stakeholders:\n\nMarketing optimization: Attract new voters, and token holders, and retain existing ones by aligning outreach with their specific interests.\n\nTailored onboarding steps and incentives, optimizing engagement and overall governance activity.\n\nIncreased quality participation: Drive higher turnout and more informed decision-making.\n\nGovernance resilience: Reward and cultivate the various groups of loyal, and prominent voters within the DAO, according to their interests, engagement and level of expertise. This will strengthen the DAO’s long-term health and resistance to governance attacks.\n\nAn example for the usage of this data: let’s consider a scenario where out of the 145k+ $APE holders, we identify over 20k individuals highly interested in DeFi, as well as gaming, and identity solutions. With this information, ApeCoin DAO can create a campaign to advance the ApeCoin community’s mission for this specific target market.\n\nAnother example: We identify that there are several meaningful voter and delegate coalitions within the DAO. With this information in hand, the DAO can facilitate discussion between the groups and navigate towards common, agreed on goals.\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nWe request total funding of $25,000 with the following breakdown: 33% once the proposal is accepted, and the remaining 67% upon the report finalization.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-409-voter-discovery-and-coalitions-in-apecoin-dao/21966\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",

      "title": "AIP-414: ApeCoin DAO at NFC Lisbon ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/f/f3247dda57bba19f253098e52d69c61a9ba9a762.png)\n\nThis proposal aims to establish a dominant presence for ApeCoin and ApeCoin DAO at the Non Fungible Conference (NFC) in Portugal, scheduled for May 28-29th, along with the wrap-up event on May 30th.\n\nPlanning involves securing a 20m² furnished networking lounge situated in a premium area of the conference. This lounge will include an interactive play-zone featuring stand-up arcade games designed to capture conference-attendee interest and generate opportunities to segue into ApeChain talks. The booth will also feature a large digital monitor playing ApeCoin-focused content, and a branded wall.\n\nThe conference’s primary WiFi network accessible for guests and other sponsors will be named ApeCoin. Attendee wristbands and staff t-shirts will display ApeCoin branding, and ApeCoin will be featured on various banners and screens during [Agoria’s](https://www.instagram.com/agoria/) final set of the opening night party, held at the event venue.\n\nTwo on-stage panels are being organized each with up to four speakers and a moderator. One discussion will focus on ApeChain, prioritizing members of the Special Council, Horizen Labs, and Layer Zero, while the other will cover ApeCoin DAO Working Groups.\n\nApeCoin will be announced as co-organizers alongside The Sandbox for the May 30th boat and beach wrap-up parties. The beach event will also serve as a pre-party for the [Moga Music Festival](https://www.instagram.com/mogafestival/) expected to draw between 10-12,000 jet-setters.\n\nWe will receive forty general access event tickets, access for forty general access allowlist spots, forty special-access boat tickets, and entry for up to forty people in the special-access area of the wrap-up event. Tickets will be distributed to community members in-person, and we will incentivize new Discourse signups with small amounts of APE.\n\nThe proposal also seeks approval to use the ApeCoin logo, and Powered by ApeCoin trademarks to be used for conference and wrap-up event marketing and physical conference-related branding. Provisions for promotional items include, but are not limited to, t-shirts, stickers, and educational materials have also been made. Any inventory produced under this allowance will be exclusive to conference attendees, on-stage panelists, and booth operators [not for sale].\n\nOther conference features include a gaming startup competition with panelists Sebastien Borget (CEO Sandbox) and Robby Young (CEO Animoca Brands) helping judge, an AI Film and Fashion Festival, and a first-of-its-kind “Memecon” presented by OSF Rekt.\n\nNFC speakers include Claire Silver, Punk6529, Deekay Motion, and John Knopf.\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nParticipating in the NFC Conference offers ApeCoin, ApeChain, and the DAOs Working Group a prime opportunity for increased brand awareness and media exposure with over 200 Web3 speakers expected to attend.\n\nAdditionally, the cost-effectiveness of this plan compared to other events allows us to establish ApeCoin and ApeCoin DAO as one of the two dominant brand’s at the conference, alongside The Sandbox. Furthermore, Lisbon is known for its affordability in Western Europe, which helps business operations and travel.\n\nSecuring a 20m² area in a premium location with games and seating will enhance ApeCoin’s credibility, providing real-world exposure as a leading brand in the space. The conference also offers valuable networking and onboarding opportunities for ApeChain, serving as a platform for education regarding opportunities provided by the DAO.\n\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/7/7eb5eacf4602d2df65ab2f2685f8dc52bc8b0a89.png)\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nThe proposal is requesting $155,000.00 USD denominated in APE with the full amount of funding required for conference and wrap-up sponsorship being provided in APE to the event.\n\nIf platinum-level sponsorships are unavailable when funding is provided, we will secure a gold-level booth in its place. Any difference in funding will either be not accepted or returned to the APE Foundation.\n\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/5/5791a33a1ebb2980c17cac7e297dd1a7ae444bbc.png)\n![img4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/7/7edb340a98eeca2dff0c3ec579bc442ba47269ab.png)\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-414-apecoin-dao-at-nfc-lisbon/22808\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-405: [Resubmission] ApeSwap on ApeChain ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThe ApeCoin DAO is built on the fundamental goal of enabling Yugaverse and ApeCoin holders with value. To date, the focus has been enabling marketplaces, a native blockchain, communications, IRL events/education, physical assets, and more.\n\nWith the launch of ApeChain fast approaching in June, a native swap/DEX product is needed in order to enable adoption and competitive functionality on ApeChain. ApeCoin DAO has the ability to establish a first-mover advantage by backing ApeSwap, a native ApeChain DEX powered by [Solidity.io](https://solidity.io/) and Sushi Labs (Sushi Swap).\n\nOur vision is to launch ApeSwap as a (DEX) to benefit ApeCoin holders. The ApeCoin DAO DEX will enable the decentralized exchange of tokens supported by multi-asset pools that earn liquidity providers fees from market making and swap fees. It should be noted that ApeSwap would not necessarily be the exclusive DEX of the ApeChain ecosystem.\n\nApeSwap will include a protocol fee for token swaps, with 50% of all protocol fees returning back to the ApeCoin DAO treasury. Immediately upon the launch and accrual of fees the DAO treasury would receive revenue distributions in accordance with the payout schedule established by Sushi Labs. In addition, ApeSwap will undergo a token generation event, and will provide an airdrop of ApeSwap DEX native tokens to ApeCoin token holders, as well as an airdrop directly to the ApeCoin treasury.\n\nSushi Labs, with development support from [Solidity.io](https://solidity.io/), will support strategic and technical efforts with the deployment, ownership, and maintenance of the DEX. In addition to this, ApeSwap will offer a token airdrop to active Sushi Swap ecosystem users to incentivize the growth and adoption of ApeChain by the broader DeFi community. xSushi (Staked sushi) holders will likely be the targets for the airdrop.\n\nSpecifications | [Solidity.io](https://solidity.io/)will operate as the core service provider for the ApeSwap DEX launch. This includes conducting design, development, and deployment of a native decentralized exchange on ApeChain for ApeSwap on behalf of Sushi Labs. All data points from the DEX will be aggregated to a decentralized datastore to enable real-time charting on the platform. The $APE grant will be paid to [Solidity.io](https://solidity.io/)upon passing of this proposal to fund ecosystem development and maintenance for one year. [Solidity.io](https://solidity.io/) will be the pre-selected core service provider, responsible for delivering on the product roadmap, supporting tokenomics design, go-live support, and maintenance of the product and platform for one year. With Sushi Labs being the operating entity and administrator of the franchised DEX, they would be responsible for hosting and maintenance coordination after one year if [Solidity.io](https://solidity.io/)and Sushi decide not to renew the initial 1-year agreement together. We expect maintenance costs after year one to fall under $100k per year for maintenance and hosting.\n\nApeSwap will launch a token on ApeChain to function as the core utility token for ApeSwap. $APE holders will receive an airdrop, ApeCoin DAO treasury will receive an airdrop, and ApeCoin DAO treasury will receive a portion of trading fees.\n\nSushi Labs will function as the legal and managing entity overseeing the DEX launch and TGE, and ApeSwap will fall under the Sushi Labs management company as part of their franchised DEX model. Sushi will provide marketing support around the DEX launch and will handle all non-technical infrastructure, including domain maintenance and ownership, and hosting and serving of the platform.\n\nUsers can swap in and out of tokens utilizing the platform’s liquidity to perform transactions. The swap will display relevant information including price impact, slippage, and deadline. In addition to swap, users will be able to add liquidity to pairs, this process will be a separate flow allowing users to customize their transaction. We plan to incentivize liquidity provision from the community and strategic partners.\n\nAt this time, final decisions have not yet been made regarding use of any existing ApeCoin DAO trademarks, or the creation of new trademarks related to ApeSwap, but the team does want to opt for an ‘Ape’ themed branding style.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nApeCoin DAO needs revenue!\n\nThe implementation of ApeSwap will be a key step in creating sustainable, on-chain infrastructure that is cash-flow generative and exists as a fundamentally ApeCoin-backed asset.\n\nBy receiving a portion of the protocol fees, as well as an airdrop to the treasury and ApeCoin holders. The ApeSwap DEX represents a potential long-term revenue stream to the DAO.\n\nWith the ApeCoin community containing many Web3 users and investors, the utility of a natively owned and backed DEX will generate massive value for existing holders, and incentivize new ApeCoin holders to acquire $APE.\nThe core of this proposal is centered around our motivation to build sustainable ApeCoin DAO treasury revenue and broader adoption of the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\nThe goal of the ApeSwap is to create a self-sustaining, cash-flow generative addition of infrastructure to the ApeCoin ecosystem, while capturing value that a competitor on ApeChain will otherwise take.\n\nIn addition, a token drop will reward $APE holders who have long deserved some value being returned to them through the DAO.\n\nAt this time, all that can be shared is that the plan is to have airdrop/token allocations to the following parties: ApeCoin holders, ApeCoin DAO treasury, Sushi Treasury, xSushi holders, team, Rewards for liquidity provision. This is a fluid process of course and will be more solidified over time. Users will need to connect to a site/platform to claim.\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nTotal Budget: 750,000 APE COIN\n\nDetailed Cost Breakdown and Allocations\n\nPlatform Design & Development: $340K\n* DEX UX/UI Design: $30,000\n* Tokenomics & Technical Architecture: $65,000\n* Smart Contract Development & Testing: $60,000\n* Front-end Development & Integration: $65,000\n* Back-End Development for Farming Rewards and Charting/Analytics: $45,000\n* Trading Alerts Features: $25,000\n* Smart Contract Audits (Internal & 3rd Party): $50,000\n\nMarketing, Business Development, and Operations: $120K\n* Business Development & Partnerships: $45,000\n* Marketing & Community Engagement: $50,000\n* Operations & Miscellaneous: $25,000\n\nLegal & Compliance: $100K\n* Comprehensive legal support and compliance assurance to navigate the regulatory landscape effectively.\n\nInfrastructure & Miscellaneous Costs: $190K\n* Hosting Costs: $35,000\n* Blockchain Indexing/Data Storage: $25,000\n* Contingency Fund: $50,000\n* 1-Year Maintenance: $80,000 (Included to ensure ongoing support and updates for the platform, covering server maintenance, product updates, and bug fixes.)\n\nWhile a plan to submit a follow-up AIP in collaboration with Sushiswap to continue as ApeSwap’s service provider after the conclusion of the initial 1-year term has not yet been decided, we hope revenue from the DEX will be sufficient to maintain all operations and maintenance expenses post the initial 1-year term.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-405-resubmission-apeswap-on-apechain/22330\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-402: $APE as a Fuel for Mobile Growth to Help Make Dookey Dash a #1 Hit Game ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nImagine $APE as fuel for growth to generate more demand for $APE. Presented by a team with a proven track record of launching dozens of chart-topping games like 2048 and Two Dots, this proposal seeks to help propel the Apecoin DAO as a marketing tool to not only encourage more games to implement $APE in their ecosystem, but to also market the games directly to the masses. For its first iteration, this proposal is set to help propel “Dookey Dash” to a #1 hit mobile game. By achieving this milestone, we aspire to amplify global awareness of $APE, and create a precedent for how $APE, through targeted ad spend across major ad networks, can fuel new demand for $APE in an ROI positive manner.\n\nWe are $APE holders and we want to see new demand for $APE. It is in the DAO’s benefit for there to be a #1 hit mobile game that is utilizing $APE to be exposed to a wider audience of gamers, and burst outside of our current bubble. The more new players exposed to games involving $APE, the more new demand there will be for $APE. This will hopefully serve as a great use case to not only provide DAO marketing support for games utilizing $APE in their ecosystem, but also act another way to encourage games to implement $APE into their game.\n\nSuperfine, a Made By Apes Company, is an AI growth tool for games to maximize their UA. It allows the capability to spend $APE across all ad networks simultaneously, focusing on maximizing your goals, be it maximum installs, lower CPA, or ROAS (return on ad spend). The game is able to determine which player qualifications it wants to target (by country, age, etc) and will only hit the bid if it fits into the desired goal. This AIP is also represented by Faraway, the studio behind Dookey Dash, which has also produced another game, Serum City, that implements $APE and supports the ecosystem.\n\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/5/5ed91d384c482a687719c45a6777aa98e6bd5ed0.png)\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThe proposal aligns with the $APE Community’s mission, specifically with its boldness and transparency. We want to reach traditional gamers, and with Dookey Dash: Unclogged being released, we feel like we can provide the DAO with a great opportunity for $APE to reach a more broad audience. With $APE at the center of the economy for the game, and the game being incredibly popular from the first time around, we feel like this could do wonders for the exposure of the DAO. The more people that download Dookey Dash, the more people that are exposed to $APE. Not only does this proposal serve an immediate impact, but it also sets the stage to serve as a marketing platform as additional mobile games come to the DAO seeking performance marketing support.\n\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/7/71c786f2569c606c784c3273672f852db2104181.png)\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nWe are seeking $150,000 in $APE from the DAO, essentially serving as a grant from the DAO to support the growth of Dookey Dash, the first potential mainstream mobile game that implements $APE. Every dollar will be used to market Dookey Dash and discover which creatives, bidding strategies, and targeting parameters work to scale most effectively, with full transparency provided to the DAO. These tests are incredibly important to the success of a mobile launch, and the DAO would be able to play a key role in supporting these efforts.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-402-ape-as-a-fuel-for-mobile-growth-to-help-make-dookey-dash-a-1-hit-game/22072\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/4/45a2cf6707ea59374f5f7eddbf6e7e453bfc5bcd.png)\n\nICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), the world’s authority on IP addresses and domain names, has permissioned the second-ever instance in the history of the Internet to apply for new top-level domains (TLDs). The imminent reopening for a limited duration and potential cap on applications adds a layer of scarcity and urgency to this opportunity.\n\nThis is a proposal to create the .APE top-level domain (TLD) as a real-world asset (RWA) during the upcoming ICANN application round, which we anticipate will open as soon as 2025. The application takes approximately one (1) year to prepare and is led by D3, a next-generation identity company focused on bridging the gap between traditional Internet infrastructure and Web3.\n\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/4/4bafa963b31766b184f9eaf42ca7653d9f5ab2fb.png)\n\nThe .APE TLD has the potential to create a lucrative, perpetual source of revenue for ApeCoin DAO, enabling growth of the community through new .APE domains, and cement ApeCoin (and $APE) as a major real-world asset with interoperability and utility at its core. D3 plans to offer a patent-pending tokenized *APE (e.g. SAM *APE) as an immediate Web3 identifier for users, while in parallel submitting the ICANN application for the real .APE TLD to enable future interoperability and native resolution seamlessly across Web2 and Web3. ApeCoin DAO will receive 50% of all gross revenues generated from the *APE name tokens and the .APE Top-Level Domain\n\nD3 has quickly become the official identity service platform for numerous top Web3 communities. The team is made up of experienced industry veterans that have received accreditation by ICANN as both TLD registry operators and domain name registrars, and has decades of experience acquiring, launching, and operating 40+ TLDs, including .XYZ, .INC, .TV, and .LINK.\n\nWith D3, the ApeCoin community has a unique opportunity to apply for and launch the .APE top-level domain (TLD) with the potential to generate multi-million dollars in annual revenue that can be utilized for the DAO. D3 commits to supporting the ApeCoin DAO to establish the .APE TLD as the next phenomenon on the Internet.\n\nIt is not possible for any entity or individual to “own” a TLD. ICANN contractually grants the rights to exclusively operate and monetize each TLD that automatically renews every 10 years. This is true of every ICANN-accredited gTLD, including .com and .xyz. In order for the ApeCoin DAO to take advantage of the benefits the D3 team offers as an existing ICANN-accredited registry operator (e.g. expedited application and minimal diligence on the DAO and the Foundation), D3 must be the TLD applicant and contracted registry operator with ICANN. This also means that D3 will take on the onerous ongoing registry obligations (e.g. annual audits, compliance, etc) to ensure .APE remains in good standing. D3 acts as essentially the white-glove and full-service operator for .APE. ApeCoin DAO and the Foundation will maintain a vested interest and voice in all TLD operations, including pricing strategy, launch timeline, whitelists and blacklists, and more. Should the Foundation desire to create its own entity and maintain the complex ongoing registry obligations, D3 will be happy to facilitate the transfer for the .APE TLD once approved.\n\nThere will be no exclusivity beyond the .APE TLD: the ApeCoin DAO has the freedom to work with other grant recipients for other TLDs, although this is practically unlikely as there are economies at scale associated with hosting multiple TLDs with D3.\n\nIt should be noted however that, in considering the best interests of the Apecoin DAO and its members, it is our firm belief that D3 should hold exclusive rights to the .APE domain name extension, just like the real .COM or .XYZ domain name extension. Given the upcoming opportunities and challenges with the ICANN round, ensuring that D3 maintains exclusivity over the .APE domain extension is not just a strategic move—it is a necessary step to protect and nurture the Apecoin DAO’s growth.\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nD3 and its affiliates will leverage its deep industry experience and accreditation to apply for and launch the .APE TLD, on behalf of the ApeCoin DAO, in the upcoming ICANN application round for new top-level domains. The .APE top-level domain will provide perpetual branding, utility, and revenue generating potential for the ApeCoin community while expanding ecosystem adoption through D3’s innovative registry and registrar, focused on top Web3 communities.\n\nName Tokens – Accelerating Launch and Go-To-Market\n\nName tokens are D3’s patent-pending methodology to distribute and scale the APE community well in advance of the establishment of .APE as a real TLD by ICANN. They offer a wide range of Web3 utility, including being used as memorable multi-chain wallet addresses, cross-platform Web3 usernames, decentralized infrastructure identifiers and more.\n\nD3 name tokens also act as expressions of interest for our domains, and token holders will have early access to the TLDs we launch in the future (such as .APE). *APE name tokens, or Ape Names, will be displayed on D3’s marketplace alongside other community name tokens partnered with D3 to pursue a TLD application. Just like purchasing a domain name, users will pay annual fees to own an Ape Name, creating an important evergreen revenue source for the DAO.\nImportantly, unlike other web3 name services, name tokens are designed to accommodate D3’s application for the .APE TLD in accelerating revenue generation for the ApeCoin community while creating future utility. D3 is committed to providing the ApeCoin DAO a real-world asset in the .APE TLD.\n\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/9/94fedcf066678ee3a4ca50cf54f0aa4dba5578e8.png)\n\nBringing Real-World Utility To ApeCoin\n\nThe Domain Name System (DNS) is critical Internet infrastructure that has been instrumental in the adoption, growth and accessibility of the Internet. The .APE TLD will unlock a multitude of real-world applications, combined with existing Web3 utility.\n\n![img4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/7/7c3f2d5a66ca8a64769d14da1cd6068b13c313f8.png)\n\nThese interoperable identities will leverage D3’s extensive DNS distribution network, while allowing a user’s .APE domain to serve as a website and email address, as well as multi-chain wallet address, cross-platform user name, serve verifiable credentials and more. The DNS is a secure, well established source of truth that will combat the growing number of unapproved, Web3-specific .APE names that have sprouted recently attempting to cash in on the ‘Ape’ brand in bad faith.\n\n![img5](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/c/c064f5b1cdf547c5e437093f3fbf5605675c8d2c.png)\n\nThis comprehensive approach leverages our domain expertise to not only advance ApeCoin’s recognition within the blockchain community, but also to position it as a versatile and widely adopted asset with relevance in both Web3 and real-world scenarios.\n\nApeCoin Community Growth & Brand Expansion\n\nThe Apes community is known for its strong bonds, and D3 has exciting plans to enhance this bond further. Upon approval of our proposal, D3 intends to provide each Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) NFT holder with a relevant *APE name token (eg. MACHI * APE, 7065 * APE) as an immediate Web3 identity solution for users until the real .APE TLD is launched. Currently, Apes use numbers to identify themselves, but with Ape Names, they will have dedicated digital identities that add even more value to their existing personas.\n\n![img6](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/5/540cbc7373b6a1df10755c459ca865705caae15d.png)\n\nIn addition, members of the ApeCoin community will have the exclusive opportunity to gain early access to other *APE name tokens before they are made available to the public. Following this Right of First Refusal period, *APE name tokens will be offered to the public. These *APE name tokens will serve as representations of the ApeCoin brand and community within D3’s marketplace and across the globe.\n\n![img7](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/176ecf106acb836d9cf7c998b1b491baec3e2a10.jpeg)\n\nOnce we have acquired and launched the .APE TLD, real .APE domains will not only work with Web3, but they will also natively resolve on the Domain Name System (DNS) for mainstream functionality like websites and email. .APE will establish a lasting brand presence on the internet and create unique, universally recognized native identities across Web2 and Web3, which can take advantage of the inherent benefits of each. D3’s approach opens the floodgates to a non-Web3 audience, expanding ApeCoin’s reach and fostering adoption among a broader demographic, thus contributing to the long-term value accrual for ApeCoin.\n\nLeveraging D3’s registrar network and Web2 distribution channels offers the opportunity for exponential market growth. D3 also specializes in enterprise adoption of domains by closely collaborating with the largest corporate agents in the world to educate brands on the unique benefits of our TLDs.\nLong-Term Recurring Revenue Generation\n\nSimilar to .COM and .XYZ, .APE has the potential to create a new source of fast-growing recurring revenue while providing a unique, liquid, and tradeable RWA.\n\nA few real-world examples highlighting the value of top-level domains and domains include:\n* .app acquired by Google for $25 million\n* .shop acquired by GMO for $42 million\n* .web acquired by Verisign for $135 million\n* [voice.com](https://www.voice.com/r/homepage) sold for $30 million\n* [NFTs.com](https://www.nfts.com) sold for $15 million\n\n![img8](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/b/b849a1eba8b54bcb133e335d557085e481fc953b.png)\n\nNamespaces are incredibly attractive and strategic opportunities, as seen from the proliferation of the Ethereum Name Service (Web3 .eth names) which has registered over 3M names in its lifetime. [Per Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/steakhouse/ens-steakhouse), ENS generated over $2M in revenue in Dec 2023 from registrations and renewals, implying an annualized run-rate revenue of $24M.\n\nWith the expertise from D3’s veteran team, the .APE TLD could become the next REAL, big domain extension, with the potential to drive thousands of monthly domain transactions that can generate millions in annual recurring revenue.\n\nIllustrative Revenue Projection\n\n![img9](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/e/e97b31238720d0730189a86cdd02d8f163936410.png)\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \n3 million ApeCoin\n\n![img10](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/a/afdc7d90139d410fae1983a5cdfbf8c6db6a8976.jpeg)\n\nAll proceeds will be used directly to apply for, market, and launch the .APE domain extension:\n* ApeCoin DAO will receive 50% of all gross revenues generated from the *APE name tokens and the .APE Top-Level Domain\n* Compared to .COM (160M domains) and .XYZ (13M), the .APE TLD could create a $M+ evergreen, profitable real-world asset for the ApeCoin DAO at a fraction of scale needed (proj. $5M+ annual recurring revenue within 36 months of launch)\n* D3 and ApeCoin DAO could represent .APE for a lifetime (10-year TLD rights, with auto-renewals)\n\nD3 will incur on-going technical and operational costs related to managing the .APE namespace, with contribution from ApeCoin DAO for co-marketing into the masses.The below includes the initial budget for the .APE acquisition process (APE):\n\n![img11](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/4/4f1b3599403368909e26b091e7cf6aaff1506894.png)\n\nAs illustrated above, the funding requested for this grant goes directly to supporting the acquisition and launch of the real .APE Top-Level Domain on the Internet. D3’s success and its compensation is tied directly to the revenue shared jointly with ApeCoin DAO from registrations and renewals.\n\nWe’re requesting an upfront commitment by ApeCoin DAO to enable us to plan large scale, wide global activation of the name token sale while concurrently initiating the ICANN application process with our staff and legal which requires more than 12 months of preparation (500+ page application), and initiate IRL activations which often require deposits.\n\nAny remaining excess funds will be directed towards revenue-generating activities including performance-based marketing and sales.\n\n![img12](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/4/4e93c32b0610be5ca43e6bb0fe62a6695b17a58d.png)\n\n\n##### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-395-ape-launching-the-real-ape-top-level-domain-on-the-internet/21474\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-393: Proposal to stake 2.5 Million $APE into the Cyan ApeCoin Vault ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThis proposal aims to have 2.5 million $APE staked directly into the Cyan ApeCoin Vault from the ApeCoin DAO.\n\nCyan is a DeFi protocol enabling users to Buy Now Pay Later, Borrow, Lend, Stake, and truly retain their ownership through the power of our wallet, allowing users to take advantage of Wallet Connect.\n\nThe $APE provided by this grant will be staked to the Cyan ApeCoin Staking vault until the emissions expire, upon which all funds will be retained by the DAO. This $APE can safely be used to increase membership, spread awareness, and expand the ecosystem by putting $APE directly into the hands of more BAYC and MAYC users who have little to no $APE and no exposure to the DAO. We’ve battle-tested and have proven the vault increases participation in the ApeCoin DAO.\n\nOur current users have created AIPs, voted on AIPs, and dived deeper into the ecosystem by developing stronger relationships and exploring deeper parts of the community. With Cyan, we can incentivize users to participate at no cost to them, while generating profits for the ApeCoin DAO. Cyan will pass through 100% of the yields from the 2.5 million $APE to the DAO. Cyan will also share 50% of the revenue generated by staking activities with the DAO. At the end of the ApeCoin staking emissions schedule, the 2.5 million $APE will be returned to the DAO.\n\nHow is Cyan able to do this through our protocol? Explainer here:\n\nThe Cyan ApeCoin Vault provides multiple ways to earn yield. Staked $APE is always earning yield as the following logic is applied:\n* $APE is paired to BAYC/MAYC/BAKC owners who want to stake but don’t have $APE. The generated yield is shared between both parties.\n* $APE which isn’t utilized for the above activity are directly staked into Horizen Labs staking contracts\n* Staking positions are continuously compounded on a bi-weekly basis. Gas is paid by Cyan\n\nThrough these activities, staked $APE is always earning yield to its maximum potential. For a deeper dive into the mechanics, please visit our documentation here: [https://docs.usecyan.com/docs/staking-apecoin](https://docs.usecyan.com/docs/staking-apecoin)\n\nThe original AIP idea thread can be found here: [https://forum.apecoin.com/t/proposal-to-stake-5-million-ape-into-the-cyan-apecoin-vault/20921](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/proposal-to-stake-5-million-ape-into-the-cyan-apecoin-vault/20921)\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n1. ApeCoin DAO generates more $APE for their treasury and other initiatives.\n2. Delegated people/groups can increase their voting power through users accessing $APE.\n3. BAYC/MAYC users can access $APE for free and get voting power equal to their max stake allotment such as 10,094 for BAYC and 2,042 for MAYC, effectively onboarding more users.\n4. The staked $APE CANNOT be liquidated by users, ensuring the full amount of 2.5 million is protected at all times.\n5. The 2.5 million $APE grant will be returned at the end of the staking period. This effectively costs the ApeCoin DAO 0 $APE.\n6. The ApeCoin DAO generates 50% of the revenue from $APE-related transactions processed through Cyan.\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nAmount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = 2,500,000 ApeCoin + $13,504\n\nThe cost comes from a 0.30% deposit fee, which is universal across all Cyan vaults. At current APEUSD prices of $1.80, this would be approximately $13,500. An estimated $4 gas fee is added.\n\nMoreover, an investment of 2.5 million $APE (valued at USD 4.5 million as of March 19, 2024) into the Cyan ApeCoin Vault is necessary, though not an expense. The DAO would maintain control of these funds. Any increase in value and interest earned throughout the investment period would be kept by the DAO.\n\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/0/0e950f44403b1d358845879cfb6e65b90e1a78c8.png)\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-393-proposal-to-stake-2-5-million-ape-into-the-cyan-apecoin-vault/20921\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

We will work with the DAO and legal to give 2.5% equity to the DAO. This first of its kind give back will usher in the next wave of AIP’s and set the stage for true value creation within the DAO amplified by the marketing impact through branding, education and culture driven social content and sharing. By taking this on, Bored Brewing will lay the difficult, but exciting groundwork for giving back to the DAO.\n2. We will be spreading knowledge about $APE to less crypto native people who enjoy drinking beer. We believe that $APE can become a currency for the digital revolution and we want to be a small part of spreading the name to a demographic thirsty for this type of knowledge outside of the crypto community.\n3. We will sponsor partnered events and share the ApeCoin brand across other relevant crypto/nft communities. The goal is to market the coin and share the background and goals of the DAO for the future.\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \n149,696 $APE\n\n- Approx 50K $APE - $75K USD in exchange for 2.5% equity utilizing the SAFE agreement mentioned above.\n\n- 40K $APE for 20,000 (approx $3/can including shipping) Cans of Beer.

The proposal team would collaborate with the community to organize a competition where the winner is awarded AIP ID #420 and an ApeCoin grant.\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThe community engagement resulting from the decision and the decision-making process may enhance cohesion, excitement, and involvement among ApeCoin holders. This proposal would preserve the cultural significance of AIP-420 within the ApeCoin DAO.\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nThis proposal requests 420,000 ApeCoin from the DAO’s Ecosystem Fund for the community contest. The winner of the contest will be awarded with AIP #420 and a reasonable grant not exceeding 420,000 ApeCoin.\n\nTLDR: We want to save AIP ID #420 to help give it a chance to create a meaningful impact for the DAO. The community would have a contest to award the AIP ID #420 along with a grant, this would be the first step to help ensure AIP ID #420 doesn’t end up in the Rejected AIPs folder.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-399-reserving-aip-id-420/21573/1\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-390: ApeCast - An app that supercharges your listening experience for all things ApeCoin (Resubmission) ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nApeCast, your app with and audio library full of curated X Spaces and ApeCoin-related recordings! Save time by searching for keywords and listening to specific segments. Read summaries of the audio in the language of your choice for quick overviews. This app will help you catch up on spaces, while not having to listen to the whole thing which can sometimes be 3+ hours!\n\nApeCast will be released for both iOS and Android.\n\nAPP FEATURES\n\nListening Library\nThis will be a part of the app that will contain spaces and recordings organized by source. This section will also contain searchable transcriptions for each episode and summaries. The summaries will be automatically translated into multiple languages as well. Other features include:\n* Background listening\n* Toggle marking an episode as listened\n* Ability to subscribe to specific sources only\nThe downloaded audio will be minimally processed and uploaded. The goal here is to serve two types of users. The first archetype is the user who normally listens live but missed it this time. This would provide an organized way to listen in after the fact. The second archetype is the user who doesn’t have time to listen to a 90m+ episode but wants to listen to specific parts where “…” is mentioned. So they use the search feature to scrub the transcript and listen to just that part. We believe this is a powerful use case for listeners of long spaces.\n\nInitially, we intend to support ApeComms spaces, MOCA town halls, and Ape Assembly Meetings. If the community wants us to support more, we are happy to add up to a total of five sources.\n\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/6/6a337e397ed65d27696501ff0137967c764c214b.png)\n\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/0/04046fe86fc63579aea803215191e5baefe54519.png)\n\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/2/2689dabbc7c0580184844e2e71b1f9a69f20bb8c.png)\n\nAll the translations will be done automatically using an AI translation tool. Since most times it’s quite accurate, this should suffice to get the meaning across. The initial set of supported languages will be French, Simplified Chinese, and Spanish.\n\nCreator Portal\nVerified creators will have access to a backend that will allow them to upload audio for processing. They can also edit the transcripts and summaries. This will provide them with more control over their product. Where possible we will auto upload the audio.\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThe ApeCoin DAO is a collection of small communities with lots of overlap. Many different spaces hold discussions on AIPs but it’s difficult to keep up. It’s also annoying to search for a specific space from a previous week and listen. This app will improve ease of access, and create an archive of spaces and their transcripts. Those who don’t have a lot of time to quickly skim through the transcript can read the summary. We believe this will increase the number of people who engage in the ApeCoin ecosystem more regularly.\n\nTranslations and audio summaries can help expand our community. We have members from all over the world. While English may not be their first language, they spend a lot of time trying to understand what’s going on and be a part of the community. We believe in helping them along their journey.\n\n##### OVERALL COST \n50000 APE\nPayments will be made upon the completion of each milestone, except for the initial payment.\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-390-apecast-an-app-that-supercharges-your-listening-experience-for-all-things-apecoin-resubmission/21398\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\n![img](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/2/27e46d4adf1b82c89bb448440a10f2be6ff2c9e2.jpeg)\nBrinc is a global venture accelerator having invested in over 250 startups over the last 8 years with founders from more than 35 countries. Brinc is also a portfolio company of Animoca Brands. Brinc has a track record of 64 Web3 startups with a total of 10.5M USD investment deployed. From our Web3 investments, average post program funding equals 2.4M USD within 12 months for teams that have successfully raised. Based on our deep Web3 experience we propose launching the “Ape Builder House” to promote the use of ApeCoin integration into new and existing businesses. Unlike other events which give teams a maximum of 2-3 days of support, we propose a prize pool including $APE grants paired with acceptance to Brinc’s world class Web3 Accelerator providing additional education, mentorship and funding opportunities for winners.\n\nBrinc Web-3 Portfolio Key Stats (Last updated in Q3 2023)\n- Total Companies in web3: 63\n- Alive: 94%\n- Dead: 6%\n- Raised Post Program: USD $12.3M\n- Year Invested - Relatively new portfolio for Brinc\n- 2023: 41%\n- 2022: 56%\n- <2021: 3%\n- Funding Stage\n- Series A: 3%\n- Pre-Series A: 14%\n- Seed: 49%\n- Pre-Seed: 34%\n- Product Stage\n- Pre-Launch: 13%\n- Pilot / POC: 41%\n- Product Launched: 46%\n- Generating Revenue?\n- Yes: 37%\n- No: 63%\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThe ApeCoin Builder House’s motivation is to provide the knowledge, resources, and mentorship for existing and new projects to integrate ApeCoin in a sustainable business. This combined with IRL events at two of the biggest Web3 conferences globally will build ecosystem awareness and utility for $APE. Our aim is for $APE to become a cornerstone fostering a growing entrepreneurial ecosystem unlocked through Brinc’s hands on support.\n\nThe Builder House will provide an opportunity for new and existing $APE holders, startups, and individual creators to launch a new idea or add to an existing business with the use of $APE. We understand that a startup journey extends far beyond a builder house which is why we will also offer winners an opportunity to join Brinc’s accelerator programs to drive long-term growth and value for the community. Over the past 9 years Brinc has hosted IRL events with thousands of attendees and helped hundreds of startups secure investment to scale.\n\nHow we support APE’s Mission and Guiding Values:\n* Help $APE members with the business tools, knowledge and mentorship to bring their idea to life\n* Support existing Web2 and Web3 businesses on how to integrate $APE\n* Build awareness for $APE with IRL events at the biggest Web3 conferences\n* Increase uses cases & utility for $APE\n* Ultimately drive the value and utility of $APE\n* Increase ApeCoin Holders\n* Access to education, mentorship and investment opportunities for top projects post-builder house to drive long-term value and growth\n* Follow-on co-investment opportunities for ApeCoin DAO to double down on Builder house winners\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nOur recommendation is to move forward with an 12 month engagement, during which we will support and launch two Builder House events with ongoing support for winners to join Brinc’s Web3 Accelerator Program.

In return, the ApeCoin DAO will receive a 5% stake in our company, along with a 20% share of the revenue. This will be accomplished by transforming Kungarna into a mass proliferation and onboarding vehicle for the ApeCoin DAO ecosystem. With a commitment to self sustainability we will be utilizing tried and true methods for revenue generation which have been successful for Kungarna over the last 7 years. We look forward to the opportunity of onboarding the next million ApeCoin fans.\n\n![img](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/15a4f7ef7a05cd0b6d7f65408caf45307bd3e8be.jpeg)\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nWe firmly believe that we can contribute to bringing unparalleled coverage, viewership, and attention to the ApeCoin ecosystem, with the goal of onboarding creators and gamers.\n\nIn 2023 our creators and gamers boasted a collective following of more than 32.2 million fans, garnering an impressive 2.7 billion views. As we venture into 2024, we have assembled a strong roster and are planning a huge expansion!\n\nThe rebranding of Kungarna into Swamp Gaming is set to propel our community to the forefront of the gaming industry, instantly establishing us as one of the largest gaming brands on a global scale. Our combined reach will encompass millions of followers and generate billions of views across our rebranded social media platforms, marking a significant milestone in ApeCoin DAO’s journey to metaverse and gaming.\n\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/a/a06e60652ae1072a44357df81ae0b7bc639d9fd0.jpeg)\n\nHere’s more in depth details on how our proposal benefits the ApeCoin DAO.\n\n1: ApeCoin Revenue Share & Equity\nAs a sustainable company, we are committed to ensuring that the ApeCoin DAO receives its fair share of the benefits from our collaboration. Throughout 2024, we will allocate 20% of our revenue under the Swamp Gaming banner to be returned to the DAO. The DAO can then use this revenue as it deems fit to support its various initiatives. We will also allocate 5% equity to the ApeCoin DAO as ownership in the Swamp Gaming company.\n\n2: Establish Swamp & ApeCoin Creator Identity\nOur gamers are committed to fully embodying the Swamp identity and representing the brand across all social media platforms. Our projections indicate that Swamp Gaming will achieve a remarkable 5 billion impressions in 2024. This achievement will position Swamp Gaming as one of the most prominent and widely recognized brands not only within the gaming industry but of all industries.\n\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/b/ba4def0e2d0285c4f15d72d9b75ce5ba9e8ac6c9_2_1380x776.jpeg)  3: Gamers Join Swamp Gaming\nWe have executed contracts for a 2024 roster comprising gamers and creators who collectively command an impressive following of over 26 million fans and generated 192 million views in January 2024. Upon approval of this proposal, these individuals will wholeheartedly embrace the Swamp and ApeCoin creator identity for the entire 2024 year. It’s crucial to note that this allocation represents just a portion of the budget. We have allocated ample amounts to accommodate substantial future growth, with plans to expand this roster to at least twice its current size.\n\n![img4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/d/db179a65e0b71ad399c4b659bd12f4bb0d4ce6b3_2_480x1000.jpeg)\n\n[A full breakdown of our rosters social media’s and viewership can be found here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GBLr82lQtNSHb1RnPcjoGOIErnwYybM0OAaozC93uls/edit#gid=0)\n\n4: Introducing ApeCoin Gaming Influencers\nAllow me to introduce the ApeCoin Swamp Influencer Program—a visionary initiative aimed at welcoming some of the world’s most prominent figures into the ApeCoin community. Leveraging Kungarna’s extensive reach and our established connections with influencers, both past and future collaborators, we will focus on onboarding these individuals as ApeCoin holders. They will serve as the vanguards of our efforts to introduce traditional web2 users to our community.\n\n5: [FaZe Sway](https://linktr.ee/Faze_Sway) Joins ApeCoin\nUpon approval of our proposal, FaZe Sway will join ApeCoin as a holder. Together with the Swamp Gaming team, our collaborative efforts will be dedicated to identifying opportunities for cross-promotion, thereby propagating the Swamp and ApeCoin throughout the gaming world. Our primary areas of focus will encompass gaming events, charity opportunities, and the potential for public goods contributions. With an astounding following of 10 million gamers, FaZe Sway is set to become not only one of the most renowned ApeCoin holders but also one of the famous advocates for Web3 globally.

We are prepared to execute a complete rebrand of the house, transitioning it from Kungarna and its sponsors to a fully immersive Swamp Gaming and ApeCoin house.

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\n\nThis proposal seeks to create Healthcare Utility for holders of $APE as well as relevant Yuga ecosystem NFTs (BAYC/MAYC/BAKC, Kodas, and Otherdeeds) and bootstrap a web 3 digital health platform that will accept payments in $Ape.\n\nUtility will be in the form of dedicated asynchronous medical advice for all relevant holders using a platform that will take the form of a reddit-meets-medium for healthcare, using a mix of medical Q&A and long-form content articles moderated by verified doctors and health sciences academics for individuals to optimize their personal wellness or enhance their health. The supply-side of this platform (verified doctors and health sciences academics) will be populated at the outset in partnership with a medical clinic registered in Singapore, one of the world’s top health systems. They will provide medical advice to relevant beneficiaries outlined in this proposal to pilot the initial front-end of the product with a gradual increase in their daily clinical hours (as a cost-saving measure proposed by the community during feedback, for the clinical hours to increase in tandem with projected adoption of healthcare utility).\n\n[Please see detailed ABSTRACT of AIP-374](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-374-healthcare-utility-for-holders-of-ape-and-bayc-otherside-nfts-with-ape-liquidity-sinks/19764)\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThis proposal will yield multiple benefits to the $APE coin ecosystem over the course of this 2-year project;\n1) Increased $APE coin buy pressure with options for discounted payments within the healthcare utility ecosystem in $APE, whereby any individual can access teleconsultation or other virtual services in the platform by making payment in $APE\n2) Reduced circulating $APE through implementation of liquidity sinks including;\n* benefits for $APE holders/stakers to encourage long-term holding, as well as\n* a commitment from our team to stake 50% of all our platform profit as apecoin $APE for a minimum of 5-years to keep our platform incentives aligned with that of apecoin DAO.\n3) Utility for $APE holders/stakers based on the 3-month average (3MA) amount of $APE held/staked from their wallets - in the form of;\n* Minimum 50 $APE: Free asynchronous medical Q&A in a publicly visible digital forum with verified medical doctors and health sciences academics to optimize their personal wellness or enhance their health, medical advice, patient navigation, illness support, second opinions, and the like.\n* Minimum 2,000 $APE: FOC synchronous appointment-based private teleconsultations once a year for medical advice, patient navigation, illness support, second opinions, and the like based on jurisdictional approvals\n* Minimum 5,000 $APE: FOC teleconsultation appointment once a quarter as above\n* Minimum 10,000 $APE: FOC teleconsultation appointment once a month as above\n* Minimum 40,000 $APE: FOC teleconsultation appointment once a week as above\n4) Utility token-gated for relevant Yuga NFT holders from the product launch in the form of;\n* Holder of any Yuga NFT: Free asynchronous medical Q&A in a publicly visible digital forum with verified medical doctors and health sciences academics to optimize their personal wellness or enhance their health, medical advice, patient navigation, illness support, second opinions, and the like.\n* Holder of Otherdeed NFT: FOC synchronous appointment-based private teleconsultations once a year for medical advice, patient navigation, illness support, second opinions, and the like based on jurisdictional approvals\n* Holder of Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC) NFT: FOC teleconsultation appointment once a quarter as above\n* Holder of Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) or Koda NFTs: FOC teleconsultation appointment once a month as above\n* Holder of Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT: FOC teleconsultation appointment once a week as above\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nUSD$1800000 (1.8M, denominated in ApeCoin) to fund the initial 24 Months of the project, broken down in terms of expenses as follows:\n\nExpenses (Total 1800000)\nSoftware engineering team: $820000\n* Inclusive CTO/Full stack developer, designer, and software engineer 2 using scrum methodology\nMarketing expenses: $175000\n* Digital Marketing lead/Community manager $80000/year\n* Social media marketing/content boosting: $15000\nProfessional services (Business incorporation, accounting and legal): $70,000\n* Legal in particular will be costly to draft the T&Cs to provide coverage of international users, regulatory guidelines for telehealth, as well as data privacy guidelines for health data transactions on chain.\nOutsourced clinical services (every day including PH/holiday or weekends): $735000\n* General practitioner coverage ($150/hr): $605250 Total hours by gradual increase: 3(180) + 5(185) + 7 (365) = 4035\n* Specialists/surgical healthcare provider coverage ($500/hr): $130000 Total hours for weekday coverage: 2 (130) = 260\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-374-healthcare-utility-for-holders-of-ape-and-bayc-otherside-nfts-with-ape-liquidity-sinks/19764\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

BNV aims to bring Web3 self-expression at its highest form to the Apecoin ecosystem.\n\nAll Apecoin holders will get access to a range of Apecoin gated digital wearables and accessories branded by IPs owned by Yuga Labs in ME:ID which they can use to create personal real time 3D avatars (see example: [001 | ME:ID – Style looks and create your 3D profile](https://id.bnv.me/001)) and enter the Fashion Battle Royale powered by Apecoin.\n\n![Sample Collection based on Apecoin Branding](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/a/acd72c5eddc5b888894db0d1b50f2caad52056b0_2_1380x776.jpeg)\n\n![Apecoin branded outfit in ME:ID](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/5/51fb74a66022bb84695c1fc0bcf16f6d6b44944a_2_1380x776.jpeg)\n\nPrize money in Apecoin will be available to attract audiences outside of the ecosystem to encourage them to Ape in. For those who already have strong connections with their digital avatars, this will be a huge opportunity for their digital alter-egos to be seen at a fashion week event in Paris in early 2024.\n\nBNV has previously executed fashion events, activations, catwalk shows and parties during multiple Paris, London and Copenhagen Fashion Weeks.\n\n![WEINSANTO PHOTOCALL5609](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/b/b6dd49e68ecb40d0fe8c2d4c6d6985fa12fbd06d_2_800x1000.jpeg)\n\n![Victor Weinsanto_Alek Katar_Ten Days In Paris0074](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/1/1d76c2edcbeb5fbe726c25ff2cf98c3a94b81aab_2_1380x920.jpeg)\n\nWe believe this will put the spotlight on the fashion relevance of the family of IPs of the Apecoin ecosystem like never before.\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nFashion and culture are 2 sides of the same coin, Apecoin’s mission is to promote all things culture in Web3 and ME:ID is all about visualising culture through the lens of fashion. ME:ID aggregates a wide range of culture in the form of fashion, art, music, dance, sports, memes and anything that helps one express his/her/their primal instincts and visual identities. BNV is confident a well executed competition in the form of battle royale with large bottom up exposure on social media platforms can definitely help further Apecoin DAO’s mission.\n\nThis collaboration can attract a wide range of fashion forward hypebeasts and digital-native creators from outside the Apecoin Community to interact and create ME:IDs with a wide range of NFT assets and visual creativity that they possess to inject new energy and new vibes into the Apecoin Ecosystem as well as massively promoting Apecoin ecosystem IPs by taking full advantage of algorithm based social platforms such as Tiktok and IG Reels.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n25,000 $APE to fund the prize pool for the top 3 winning ME:ID profiles\n\n$70,000 USD equivalent in $Ape for organising the IRL fashion event in Paris showing off the ME:IDs of the top 8 finalists of the Fashion Battle Royale as well as notable ME:ID avatars from the entire competition.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-353-fashion-battle-royale-powered-by-apecoin-web3-self-expression-redefined/19264\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",

      "title": "AIP-383: The Public Bored - MVP Launch of a Digital Billboard Network",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nThis AIP supports the MVP launch of an outdoor digital billboard network, with a primary objective of establishing a long-term sustainable business model that; helps fund the ApeCoin DAO treasury, establishes new use cases for $APE, expands the community of $APE builders, while providing the world with a progressively decentralized platform to showcase messaging and art.\n\nWe’ve bootstrapped this startup on our initiative, with our own money, and designed it to provide numerous direct benefits to the $APE ecosystem. We’re asking the $APE community to help us accelerate the concept and increase its chances of success. We hope that by leading with actions instead of promises, with our skin in the game first, and by placing a high priority on driving direct value to the DAO, the Ape community will choose to support this.\n\nIf this AIP passes, then; 20% of all top-line revenue will be sent into the ApeCoin DAO treasury until the full cost of this AIP is returned. Anyone can earn a 10% rewards payout from all referrals. Every wallet hodling at least 5k $APE as at January 1st, 2024, will receive free display space on a first come first serve basis. Furthermore, for however long the Ape community continues to support this initiative, a further 1% of all revenue will be sent into the ApeCoin Treasury on-going, plus a quantity of TBD display space will be reserved for use by the ApeCoin DAO, and our Network of frens and fam, such as those at Mocaverse, BAYC, MAYC, JRNY Club, Surreal Guild, and Ape Delegates, for life.\n\nThe outdoor digital advertising industry is ripe for disruption and we’re all positioned to spearhead and benefit from this for years to come. Our modernized approach to this old-school industry offers the potential to generate substantially increased operating margins than competitors and opens up the total addressable market (TAM) by an order of magnitude. The conservative financial request in this AIP covers six months of runway for my team and I to carry out up to two consecutive MVP engagements aimed at positioning this initiative for sustainable revenue generation and future scaling.\n\nI initiated this project in Q4 2019 with a personal investment of approximately $40,000. However, the onset of the Covid lockdown in Q1 2020 forced me to put the project on hold. I have now re-commenced the project with @thebossdragon as CTO, having injected a further $10,000 of my own capital in recent weeks.\n\nThe first MVP engagement takes place over a 10-day period during the Ethereum Denver Blockchain/Web3 Event scheduled for February/March 2024, with an anticipated attendance of approximately 15,000 Ethereum-related enthusiasts. We’ve leased a truck equipped on 3-sides with sizeable digital display screens to roam the streets of the event area. Its mission is to display messages and art, while recruiting more builders into the Ape ecosystem, and providing all hodlers of at least 1 $APE with an opportunity to help drive value into the DAO treasury while earning rewards for themselves too. If successful, the model will then scale beyond mobile advertising to encompass highway billboards, transit vehicles, bus stop displays, elevator displays, and more.\n\nAccessibility and speed are key features of this initiative. Anyone can purchase a display spot at any time for the minimum purchase price of 0.001 ETH, and have their messaging displayed within 60 seconds or less. Anyone holding 1 $APE can earn referral rewards, and anyone who pays with $APE receives bonus display time for free. Furthermore, a portion of all ad space will be reserved for free use by the ApeCoin DAO as it sees fit, and for our ecosystem frens. One such use could be the promotion of a ‘Build with $APE’ introductory guide and promotional video, which is included in the budget of this AIP, and which would be integrated into this project’s website: [publicbored.com](http://www.publicbored.com/).\n\nThe proposed budget encompasses technology development, website development, display rental expenses, marketing efforts, and a total of twelve months to transition into a self-sustaining model.\n\nSubsequent MVP engagements are TBD in 2024.\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\n1. 20% of all revenue will be sent into the ApeCoin DAO treasury until the full cost of this AIP is returned.\n2. Anyone can earn a 10% rewards/payout for all referrals who purchase display time on the digital billboard\n4. On-going royalties plus free ads: for as long as the Ape community continues to support this initiative, a further 1% of all revenue will be sent into the ApeCoin Treasury on-going, plus a quantity of TBD ad space on all billboards everywhere shall always be reserved for use by the ApeCoin DAO, and our Network of frens and fam, such as $APE hodlers, Mocaverse, BAYC, MAYC, JRNY Club, Surreal Guild, and Ape Delegates hodling 50k $APE or more, for life.\n5. Bonus, free display time is also given to everyone who pays in $APE.\n6. Free display space is reserved exclusively for ApeCoin DAO use, such as for recruiting more builders into the Ape ecosystem.\n7. We also aim to help recruit more $APE builders, via a guide for new AIP authors posted directly on the Public Bored website to help direct website traffic towards the DAO, or similar.\n8. 25% of all revenue generated will be converted into and held in $APE on-going, until the funds need to be used, in which case we will actively seek to pay expenses in $APE wherever practical. For example, part of the cost of the billboard truck has been paid for directly using $APE. This was their first time accepting $APE as payment, and only happened because I specifically asked them to. It was a fun discussion, and they are excited :slight_smile: \n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nTotal Budget: 75,000 $APE\n\nApproximate allocations:\n* Digital Display Truck: 15k $APE\n  * Acquisition of cutting-edge mobile canvas\n* Website & Technology Development: 20k $APE\n  * Advancing innovation through web and tech\n* Marketing: 10k $APE\n  * Strategic campaigns to amplify impact\n* Staffing and Related Expenses: 15k $APE\n  * Committed to nurturing a skilled team for twelve consecutive months\n* Transportation & Rentals: 5k $APE\n  * Facilitating logistics for seamless execution\n* Direct Sales: 5k $APE\n  * Hands-on engagement for strategic growth\n* Miscellaneous Expenses: 5k $APE\n  * Navigating unforeseen challenges with resilience\n* Possible Second & Third Event Budgets (TBD, based on revenues generated)\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-383-the-public-bored-mvp-launch-of-a-digital-billboard-network/21187\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to establish the ApeCoin DAO Development Working Group.\n\nThe ApeCoin DAO Development Working Group’s mandate is to:\n“Build income generating projects for the ApeCoin DAO, ApeCoin Initiatives like ThankApe, Boring Security DAO, MBA licensed projects and the ApeCoin community. ApeChain will be a strong focus point once we reach that point.”\n\nWorking Groups enable a sustainable community-led infrastructure that further decentralizes the DAO, creates operational efficiency, and is flexible enough to adapt to any opportunities that may arise.\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nIt was recently announced that the ApeCoin DAO can receive revenue from AIPs and projects within the Ape and ApeCoin communities. There has been much talk around bringing much needed value back to the DAO and believe there needs to be a more structured focus on doing this. The ApeCoin DAO Development Working Group will focus solely on this and aims to create various projects and initiatives that will serve this exact purpose.\n\nWorking together as a community I feel we can implement various simple solutions that will drive value and needed resources back into the DAO and other initiatives alleviating the sell pressure on our much loved $APE token. In addition we expect to see the ApeChain come to life sooner, rather than later and there needs to be a strong focus on building on this to ensure it’s long term success.\n\nIf you build it, they will come…\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n$0\n\nThis AIP serves as an initial framework to establish this Working Group. The three elected Stewards will propose a budget 1-3 weeks after being onboarded.\n\nList item\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-376-working-group-charter-web3-development/20197\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-381: ApeCoin Powered GameFi DAOs & Vaults - Resubmission",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nThis AIP aims to build an ecosystem of GameFi NFT-based DAOs and vault, powered by ApeCoin. Using smart contract wallets, the AIP will establish a lend/borrow NFT assets & rewards vault for the game community.\n\nThe ApeDAO wanted to implement active user engagement in a Game community by enabling GameFi Segment with the DAO and smart contract Wallets. As NFT-based P2E games grow in popularity, NFT asset management ecosystems - driven by the community - are becoming essential, as they allow asset rotation among active community members. This maximizes the potential of NFT DeFi.\n\nGamified DAOs are built in a way that only allows active wallets to keep the assets and continue participating in the game. For inactive assets, the DAO will run a vote to pull them from the member wallets and into the vault. The assets will later be reallocated to other members, as per the policy set by the DAO members.\n\nThis approach increases NFT scarcity and price in the market which will eventually attract more buyers and investment in the ApeCoin-driven DAO community. Furthermore, the DAO will offer incentives to participating voters, creating a constructive cycle of engagement.\n\nAll the DAO processes will run on a predefined set of rules to streamline community governance.\n\nEach game community will have its own DAO and members where rules of governance and different policies are defined by the community members. Once the governance is established, a dedicated vault is created/ deployed for each community to lend their assets either as an individual member or through a community proposal for pooled resources. The community can buy assets for the vault to be later lent to the players and earn rewards based on a distribution set by the DAO distribution policy.\n\n  ![image1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/e/ed8198ae9f5497dd3b2f0a781a195470bb958883.png)\n\n![image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/5/5855ab13bc32f1efe3b38ac0e0bcc7f01283f452.png)\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nOnly the APE Coinholder will have the opportunity to create and engage in game DAO and vaults. Thus, anyone who plays games using the vault assets must hold APE coins, the DAO member will receive a share of rewards, in some cases without engaging in the game directly (feature to be explored at a later stage).\n\n* Bring in new members to the Ape community and effectively grow the community\n* Enable a safe and fair lending system to “put to work” all NFTs, thus increasing their use cases, value, and market dynamics\n* Attract more players to the Ape-related games through the ApeDAOs and large investors and guilds\n* Make the ApeCoin ecosystem, in general, more guild-friendly; large investors and guilds would feel more motivated on investing in Ape-related NFTs and projects and bringing their network into the action\n\n![mockup2|337x500](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/6/6fa68b5924df3909ee1fed2fd79ebc3e752189e3.png)\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n**$520k denominated in APE coins**\n\n2m STZ tokens will be given to the ApeDAO as partnership value, equivalent to 2.02% of the token's total supply.\n(STZ tokens will have a 6 months lock up period, starting from the day the ApeDAO fund are received.)\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-381-apecoin-powered-gamefi-daos-vaults-resubmission/21125\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nApeCoin must create value now. To do that, we must attract, fund, and coordinate the best talent to address our DAO’s biggest needs. Speed and accuracy matter. Trust matters. Automation and decentralization matter. Utility is essential.\n\nThank APE - Phase II is a one-year initiative that proposes to:\n\n* Continuously sense into the biggest needs and opportunities for ApeCoin DAO\n* Attract, fund, and coordinate the best talent to quickly respond to those needs\n* Incentivize community members to engage and support value-creating projects\n\nInitially funded nearly a year ago, Thank APE has attracted, funded, and coordinated more talent to create value for ApeCoin DAO than the rest of our DAO AIP process - combined. And we’ve done it with less than 0.4% of the treasury.\n\n**![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/d/d2a9883d1dc095dc605e9dbbc726afbe84adb7e5.png)**\n\n\n**Thank APE's Motivation:** We are Apes. Our motivation is to create enormous value for ApeCoin DAO - by rewarding and recognizing valuable decentralized contributions to our DAO. We’ve been doing this since our first Thank APE Proposal [AIP-124 ](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-124-thank-ape-decentralized-automated-rewards-for-valuable-apecoin-contributions/8564)passed almost a year ago.\n\nOur motivation - combined with our tech and expertise, and your partnership - has helped support significant accomplishments since we launched in April of this year. We’ve done it all through a bear market, decreasing ApeCoin value, and wide-ranging coordination problems in the DAO:\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/6/69c4b3e42ca3d6fb9c3058b4c2fdc5103aa02300_2_1332x1000.jpeg)\n\nRecently, big proposals have passed that reflect a shared realization that we must create more value now. Examples include [AIP-297](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-297-an-nft-community-vault-operating-as-an-apecoin-sister-dao-with-a-goal-to-advance-the-mission-and-influence-of-apecoin/16167/1), [AIP-304 ](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-304-create-the-digital-art-movement-collection-to-acquire-yuga-assets-bayc-mayc-bakc-and-punks-and-other-notable-nfts-for-exhibition-and-donation-to-art-institutions/15737), and [AIP-317 ](https://snapshot.org/#/apecoin.eth/proposal/0x804e07256a1e5ad84ed97437001c71c418efd256257349cb56939faab6492372)- all of which are seeking to shake things up and help build value in new, big ways for our DAO.\n\nWhile the impact of these proposals isn’t yet known, the DAO recognized they we must invest to ignite an ecosystem whose future depends on us. Thank APE is proposing another big bet - one that, we believe, addresses the biggest need in the DAO:\n\n**We must create greater value, utility, and efficiency in our DAO now.**\n\nTo do that, our Thank APE - Phase II will support effective decision-making and allocation of resources - and attract, fund, and coordinate top talent that quickly addresses the biggest needs in the DAO.\n\n* Our DAO has passed some proposals - but few have created significant impact yet.\n* Our DAO has organized into various groups - but much is still left to be desired.\n* Our DAO has built some things - but not enough people use them and none generate revenue.\n\nThank APE has already been a consistent force in ApeCoin DAO fixated on solving this massive need. We’ve funded and coordinated the building of [hundreds of projects ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qFa6Ehkb_Z4hygWVydmXcqUAtzJJmi1_DPTHAlewCvU/edit?usp=sharing)creating value in alignment with the feedback of our community and the needs of our DAO.\n\n**Background:** Our ApeCoin community was founded with a simple mission of driving culture forward into the metaverse. This mission requires building a thriving ecosystem around our culture and community.\n\nA year ago, we had a treasury war chest valued in the billions. Today that same treasury is valued at a fraction of what it was. This is largely because the DAO has generally had a hard time consistently attracting top talent to contribute to our ecosystem. \n\nThere is a simple reason for this: Passing an AIP in our DAO environment is hard. It requires that a builder also be a diplomat and a salesperson, not get paid for months, and - at times - put themselves in the crosshairs of public misinformation campaigns from people with their own interests. \n\nTop builders don't need to put themselves through that kind of pain. They can fund their projects in easier ways than our AIP process provides. For example, ThriveCoin is funded by well-recognized web3 VCs, all of which provided an easiest, less stressful path than passing an ApeCoin AIP. \n\nThank APE has been changing this. \n\nThrough Thank APE, top builders have been able to quickly and easily contribute to ApeCoin DAO in ways that are aligned with the biggest needs of our DAO.  The impact is that we've attracted thousands of new contributors that has resulted in hundreds of new projects for ApeCoin DAO. \n\nThis is just the beginning. With Phase II, we are doubling down on everything that's worked, making our tech even more accessible and extensible, and focusing all of our energy on attracting greater builders from across our ecosystem to build with ApeCoin! \n\n**![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/0/0b0d90b806e02786db1620ccffacf3d0ac26ea33.png)**\n\nWith Phase II, we are proposing to take a bigger role in helping our ApeCoin community create greater value, efficiency, and utility *now*. Our shared future requires that we get this right.\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nApeCoin must expand the size of our talent pool and continue to create more and more value now. This requires being faster, better, and bolder.\n\nThank APE is proposing to expand our role as a trusted party in maximizing value creation for our DAO - and doing it in a way that ensures greater utility, value, and efficiency across our decentralized community. The benefit to the ApeCoin ecosystem will be:\n\n* Greater community-wide clarity about the biggest needs of our ecosystem\n* Quick, precise funding of decentralized talent to address our biggest needs\n* Incentives for members to use and engage projects addressing our biggest needs\n\nWe expect to predominately serve three areas of known ecosystem needs (the details of which will be further clarified in the continuous Sense process described below):\n\n* Tech builders: e.g. development teams, developers, etc.\n* Culture builders: e.g. influencers, artists, writers, events, local communities, etc.\n* Small businesses: e.g. online and offline merchants, service providers, etc.\n\n** If ApeChain is funded, we intend to be a strong support for onboarding and building on ApeChain.\n\n** We intend to give special consideration to projects that drive revenue for the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nWe request 4.2M APE for a 1-year deployment. Like with Phase I, the proposal is 100% Performance-based. \n\n* 80% of requested funds allocated back to the ApeCoin community for value-creating contributions. \n* 20% allocated to service provider fees.\n\nBelow is an overview of how we expect to allocate funds for Phase 2 over one year (final allocations clarified during ongoing Sense processes, which all community members can influence):\n\n3.36 million APE allocated back to the community in the form of rewards. Includes:\n\n* 1.68M to Tech Builders\n* 1.18M to Culture Builders\n* 500k to Small Businesses\n* 336k to Emerging Opportunities\n\n840k APE allocated to ThriveCoin, Thank APE Board, and other support services. Includes:\n\n*305k - Protocol and Platform Design & Development*\n\n* Product Architecture, Design, and Management - 70k\n* Backend Development Support - 90k\n* Dashboard / UI Development Support - 50k\n* UI/UX Design - 10k\n* QA - 20k\n* Admin Dashboard UI Development - 25k\n* Smart Contract Development - 20k\n* Smart Contract Audit - 20k (third party)\n\n*400k - Deployment Support, Partnerships, Community, Legal*\n\n* Community Project Manager - 60k\n* Integrations / Contributions Specialist - 60k\n* Community Relations / Support - 60k\n* Community Management / Moderation - 60k\n* Data Analyst - 40k\n* Funding Allocator - 60k\n* Event Management - 40k\n* Legal - 20k\n\n*75k - Hosting Costs*\n\n* AWS Infrastructure Costs - 60k\n* Blockchain Indexing / Data Storage - 15k\n\n*60k - Thank APE Board Members not part of the APE Foundation*\n\n**![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/5/52ad62e17c4f26139e2d33caea256547ba23fb01.png)**\n\n![](https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/xFPRfeHHx7ZZ.jpg?o=1)\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-379-thank-ape-phase-ii-amplifying-a-movement/20324\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-381: ApeCoin Powered GameFi DAOs & Vaults - Resubmission",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nThis AIP aims to build an ecosystem of GameFi NFT-based DAOs and vault, powered by ApeCoin. Using smart contract wallets, the AIP will establish a lend/borrow NFT assets & rewards vault for the game community.\n\nThe ApeDAO wanted to implement active user engagement in a Game community by enabling GameFi Segment with the DAO and smart contract Wallets. As NFT-based P2E games grow in popularity, NFT asset management ecosystems - driven by the community - are becoming essential, as they allow asset rotation among active community members. This maximizes the potential of NFT DeFi.\n\nGamified DAOs are built in a way that only allows active wallets to keep the assets and continue participating in the game. For inactive assets, the DAO will run a vote to pull them from the member wallets and into the vault. The assets will later be reallocated to other members, as per the policy set by the DAO members.\n\nThis approach increases NFT scarcity and price in the market which will eventually attract more buyers and investment in the ApeCoin-driven DAO community. Furthermore, the DAO will offer incentives to participating voters, creating a constructive cycle of engagement.\n\nAll the DAO processes will run on a predefined set of rules to streamline community governance.\n\nEach game community will have its own DAO and members where rules of governance and different policies are defined by the community members. Once the governance is established, a dedicated vault is created/ deployed for each community to lend their assets either as an individual member or through a community proposal for pooled resources. The community can buy assets for the vault to be later lent to the players and earn rewards based on a distribution set by the DAO distribution policy.\n\n  ![image1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/e/ed8198ae9f5497dd3b2f0a781a195470bb958883.png)\n\n![image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/5/5855ab13bc32f1efe3b38ac0e0bcc7f01283f452.png)\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nOnly the APE Coinholder will have the opportunity to create and engage in game DAO and vaults. Thus, anyone who plays games using the vault assets must hold APE coins, the DAO member will receive a share of rewards, in some cases without engaging in the game directly (feature to be explored at a later stage).\n\n* Bring in new members to the Ape community and effectively grow the community\n* Enable a safe and fair lending system to “put to work” all NFTs, thus increasing their use cases, value, and market dynamics\n* Attract more players to the Ape-related games through the ApeDAOs and large investors and guilds\n* Make the ApeCoin ecosystem, in general, more guild-friendly; large investors and guilds would feel more motivated on investing in Ape-related NFTs and projects and bringing their network into the action\n\n![mockup2|337x500](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/6/6fa68b5924df3909ee1fed2fd79ebc3e752189e3.png)\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n**$520k denominated in APE coins**\n\n2m STZ tokens will be given to the ApeDAO as partnership value, equivalent to 2.02% of the token's total supply.\n(STZ tokens will have a 6 months lock up period, starting from the day the ApeDAO fund are received.)\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-381-apecoin-powered-gamefi-daos-vaults-resubmission/21125\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",

We pay our contributors in ApeCoin, we hodl our ApeCoin, and we provide (some) liquidity to ApeCoin as well.\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/8/847792ae7a43702022d013a5d419be81d9cc2d2a.jpeg)\n*A mockup of the Powered by ApeCoin usage*\n\nBoring Security has been incredibly cost effective, being very judicious with every dollar spent.

So far, we’ve focused on expanding our live class offering and growing our community. Next we want to be a household name, helping turn ApeCoin DAO to be the friendliest, most accessible ecosystem in all of crypto.

      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nApeCast, your app with curated X Spaces and ApeCoin-related recordings! AI automatically transcribes audio, enabling you to search for keywords and listen to specific segments. Read AI-generated summaries in the language of your choice for quick overviews.\n\nBe informed with tailored notifications; choose what matters to you, be it updates on new recordings or community proposals. ApeCast ensures you’re always in the loop. Get ready to vote by reading AIPs in full, in your preferred language, thanks to automatic translations.\n\nApeCast will be released for both iOS and Android.\n\n![M_Listen_Inner|333x500](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/6/6a337e397ed65d27696501ff0137967c764c214b_2_666x1000.png)\n\n![M_Listen_Inner|333x500](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/0/04046fe86fc63579aea803215191e5baefe54519_2_666x1000.png)\n\n![M_Listen_Inner|333x500](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/b/bf271c4e68d3516b90e8ca3b83e977b543ee6736_2_666x1000.png)\n\n![M_Listen_Inner|333x500](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/e/eb63c39f9ffb51d398ebcb674e7a280b7b67d4de_2_666x1000.png)\n\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nThe ApeCoin DAO is a collection of small communities with lots of overlap. Many different spaces hold discussions on AIPs but it’s difficult to keep up. It’s also cumbersome to search for a specific space from a previous week and listen. This app will improve ease of access, and create an archive of spaces and their transcripts. Those who don’t have a lot of time to quickly skim through the transcript can read the summary. We believe this will increase the number of people who engage in the ApeCoin ecosystem more regularly.\n\nNotifications can help ensure that people get notified about things that they want to hear about. We believe this will help retain interested users. A lot of times people just tend to forget, with life getting in the way. We also strongly believe that the only way to keep people open to receiving notifications is to allow them to customize what they want to hear about. Since the ecosystem has many different arms, this way people can stay subscribed to the things they care about.\n\nViewing proposals within an app is mainly meant to empower users to be able to quickly read proposals if they have free time. We believe that having an easy-access way of reading proposals will get more casual voters on board. Maybe you read the proposal in an Uber and all that’s left to do is vote when you get home.\n\nTranslations of all these components, especially the proposals and audio summaries can help expand our community. We have members from all over the world. While English may not be their first language, they spend a lot of time trying to understand what’s going on and be a part of the community. We believe in helping them along their journey. Proposals being translated will reduce the burden and if they want, they can always double-check the English version.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n75000 APE\nPayments will be made upon the completion of each milestone, except for the initial payment.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-360-apecast-an-app-that-supercharges-your-listening-experience-for-all-things-apecoin-and-keeps-you-informed/19510\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-362: Establish bi-monthly AIP voting periods",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nThe current weekly voting system has significant disadvantages to both AIP authors and voters, particularly delegations. It is often quoted to be too short for AIP authors to adequately campaign for their AIPs, and for voters it has often been quoted to be too frequent.\n\nBored Club Canada being an active delegate, it is in our experience that the weekly voting is challenging to administer and we could be more efficient if we had more time for our delegates and authors. A bi-monthly (twice per month) voting period is also implemented by our DAO peers such as Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nWe propose moving to a bi-monthly (twice per month) voting period of 14 days each. Each voting period would commence for the First and Third Thursday of each month.\n\nAPE Foundation will still reserve the right to modify voting periods at its discretion (e.g. emergencies, risks to the DAO, etc.) with reasonable notice to the community and for non-AIPs (e.g. elections).\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nReduced Administrative Overhead: Weekly voting can lead to a significant administrative burden for managing the voting processes, tallying results, and coordinating activities. With fewer voting periods, there is less frequent overhead for both DAO administrators and delegations.\n\nTime for In-Depth Deliberation: Having a bi-monthly schedule allows members more time to thoroughly research and discuss proposals. This can result in more informed decision-making, as members have the opportunity to delve into the details of proposals and engage in meaningful debates.\n\nEncourages Long-Term Thinking: Bi-monthly voting encourages members to consider the long-term impact of decisions on the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\nReduced Voter Fatigue: Frequent voting can lead to voter fatigue, where members become disengaged or less likely to participate due to the constant decision-making process. Bi-monthly voting can help maintain higher levels of engagement.\n\nSupports More Comprehensive Proposals: In a bi-monthly system, members and proposers may have more time to develop comprehensive proposals, conduct audits, and gather feedback, resulting in more thought-out and refined proposals.\n\nMore Stable Decision-Making: Weekly voting might lead to frequent changes in the direction of the DAO, which can be disruptive. Bi-monthly voting can provide more stability, allowing decisions to be implemented before new ones are made.\n\nEasier for Time Zones: DAOs often consist of members from around the world, and having a bi-monthly schedule may make it easier for participants from different time zones to participate without always having to be available for voting.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n$0\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-362-establish-bi-monthly-aip-voting-periods/19622\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-368: ApeChain - A zk-Powered Polygon Layer-2 to Support ApeCoin Growth",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nPolygon Labs proposes that ApeCoin DAO launch and maintain its own zero-knowledge powered Layer-2 (“zk-L2”) with the Polygon Chain Development Kit (“CDK”) to accelerate the growth and development of the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal includes (1) the launch of a dedicated ApeCoin zk-L2 chain (“ApeChain”) built and maintained by Gateway.fm, a premier rollup as a service (“RaaS”) provider that builds Web3 infrastructure and tooling products with advisory support from Polygon Labs and oversight of such building and maintenance to be conducted by the ApeCoin DAO Foundation and (2) ecosystem collaboration with Polygon Labs to help stimulate the growth of ApeCoin-integrated projects (experiences, entertainment, games and consumer applications) and ApeChain-related public goods (middleware, marketplaces, and necessary infrastructure).\n\nAs contemplated under “Gateway.fm as RaaS Provider and Architecture Considerations” below, ApeChain will be fully owned, governed and run under the patronage of the ApeCoin DAO community with 100% of all revenue, including sequencer fees or any potential Native Yield (defined below), accruing to the ApeCoin DAO and ApeCoin Validators (defined below). No AIP Idea is inherently linked to this AIP and all AIP Ideas–design architecture or otherwise–not explicitly covered within this AIP (e.g., a separate “ApeChain token” launch/airdrop or a development fund from the ApeCoin DAO treasury to help stimulate the growth of ApeCoin-integrated projects and ApeChain-related public goods) is not precluded from this ApeChain implementation but instead is left to the community (e.g., through subsequent AIPs by ApeCoin community members) even in cases where Polygon Labs does not believe it would be in the best interests of APE holders.\n\n  ![image1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/2/2e6b946844041736a2fee1f03c4bd247f683c501_2_1248x786.png)\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nThe ApeCoin community has been aware that ApeCoin “will need to migrate to its own chain in order to properly scale” since these very words were [tweeted by Yuga Labs](https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1520612362986078208?s=20&t=-NhsBR93IH1LJp6ZYfcDdA) nearly 18 months ago. Indeed, Yuga Labs went on to “encourage the [ApeCoin] DAO to start thinking in this direction.” While ApeCoin DAO voted on [AIP-41](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-41-keep-apecoin-within-the-ethereum-ecosystem-process/5664/2) to keep ApeCoin within the Ethereum ecosystem, the question of an ApeCoin-specific chain is open and remains ripe for decision.\n\nHere’s where this AIP comes in: to propose a dedicated ApeChain, using Polygon [CDK](https://polygon.technology/polygon-cdk), an open source toolset developers can use to launch their own zk-powered L2 on Ethereum with little friction and an emphasis on modularity, built and maintained by Gateway.fm with advisory support from Polygon Labs and oversight by the ApeCoin DAO Foundation.\n\nAs detailed below under “Platforms and Technologies,” ApeChain will provide ApeCoin DAO and its members potential sequencer fees and staking rewards for network validators while solving the scaling issue mentioned above. In other words, this chain will provide dedicated, ultra-premium and inexpensive blockspace for ApeCoin DAO-affiliated and/or -incubated experiences, entertainment, games and consumer applications that will ultimately bring not only more users into the ApeCoin ecosystem, but also additional activity and creation of all types of value (content, assets, data and the like).\n\nPolygon CDK has seen great adoption already. Chains being developed using Polygon CDK and core contributors thereto include X1 (built by OKX), Immutable zkEVM, NEAR zkWASM, Gnosis Pay, Capx, Palm Network, Astar zkEVM, Canto and Celestia (for data availability), among others. This is because Polygon CDK offers the highest degree of flexibility in scaling Ethereum while also remaining maximally secure.\n\nApeCoin DAO's [stated mission](https://apecoin.com/about) is to “empower a decentralized community building at the forefront of web3.” Via $APE, ApeCoin DAO will build and support “a decentralized protocol layer for community-led initiatives that drive culture forward into the metaverse.\"\n\nApeChain will provide the ApeCoin DAO with an efficient and secure execution environment upon which ApeCoin DAO projects can be built to help realize this mission. As a result, by virtue of ApeCoin DAO gaining composability and interoperability with the entire modular suite of Polygon solutions (including Polygon PoS, which will [soon be upgraded to a zkEVM Validium](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pre-pip-discussion-upgrading-polygon-pos-to-a-zkevm-validium/12187?utm_campaign=Polygon+2.0&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=73083564&utm_content=73083564&utm_source=hs_email), Polygon zkEVM, Polygon Miden and various customizable L2 permutations using the CDK, together “**Polygon Architecture**”), the ApeCoin ecosystem will be primed for tremendous growth.\n\nWith thousands of dApps and millions of daily transactions, the Polygon Architecture is by far the most robust and stable Ethereum L2 scaling solution. With ApeCoin already bridged onto Polygon PoS, it is already available to be used by all dApps across Polygon Architecture – including for gas and staking in relation to dApps built on the proposed ApeChain (see “Platforms and Technologies” below).\n\nIt is [well-documented](https://decrypt.co/117671/decrypts-2022-crypto-project-of-the-year-polygon) that mainstream adoption of blockchain technology and Web3 is underway, and the Polygon Architecture is helping to bring blockchain to “Internet-scale.” This is across verticals and use cases, including gaming (Square Enix), loyalty rewards (Starbucks), phygital goods and co-creation (Nike), digital avatars (Reddit), self-expression and identity (L’Oreal) and the most adopted Web3-native use cases (from defi, like Uniswap and Aave, to the open metaverse, like Sandbox and Decentraland). As such, the Polygon Architecture is the most well-suited ecosystem for ApeCoin DAO to launch “community-led initiatives that drive culture forward into the metaverse” and Polygon Labs is the most well-suited entity to help ApeCoin DAO to stimulate the growth of ApeCoin-integrated projects and ApeChain-related public goods.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nAs laid out in the preceding sections of this AIP, we estimate that the costs for building, deploying and maintaining ApeChain for one year, will be a maximum of $200,000 USD. None of these expenses would be paid to Polygon Labs or any affiliate of Polygon Labs. Instead, they would be used to pay Gateway.fm and its infrastructure costs.\n\nOnce ApeChain is built, deployed and maintained, the DAO (as a self-governing entity) will decide for itself how it will fund and maintain ApeChain in subsequent years. Possibilities include negotiating with the Gateway.fm on a contract extension or fielding proposals from community members with sufficient expertise who are willing to contribute to ApeChain’s maintenance, for example.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-368-apechain-a-zk-powered-polygon-layer-2-to-support-apecoin-growth/19308\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

The ApeCoin DAO Founders Circle is an exclusive space and event hub designed to support early-stage blockchain and DeFi startups and promote ApeCoin DAO by educating the local tech communities about our vision and processes. This initiative includes access to online educational resources, 1:1 sessions, networking opportunities, exclusive invitations to IRL events, and access to ApeCoin DAO’s community and investor network. The benefits of funding this initiative include establishing ApeCoinDAO as a hub for early-stage startup founders and entrepreneurs, building a strong network of like-minded individuals, and increasing the visibility and reach of the organization in DAO’s selected markets.\n\n![image|624x312](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/0/09e48d918446865b046fdc980508b5ab83503d3c.jpeg)\n\nThese offices will serve as dynamic showcases for ApeCoin DAO, embodying a proactive approach to engage and educate local communities on pivotal topics such as $APE, the metaverse, and web3.\n\n![image|624x331](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/f/fe439debd56032c9b5e0553eba62917e305cc19b.jpeg)\n\n![image|624x327](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/7/7762741517011b67896da6560dabb2cea9175aef.jpeg)\n\nIn addition to the physical and digital activities hub we will offer at ApeCoin DAO Founders Circle, a platform to streamline our operations. This website will allow ApeCoin DAO members (via wallet) to access co-working spaces and participate in events through the use of tags, as well as the founders or guests. With this website, we aim to make it easier for individuals to make the most of our activities and services. The website will also have an education hub where users can access helpful materials, videos, and slides to continue their learning journey at their own pace.\n\n![image|446x500](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/d/d990bc04dbbfd9c5cddaae40e543493eb5f0fa61.jpeg)\n\n![image|624x445](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/8/8bcc48ff58a9e0193f466bd8000cc83a82fa5328.jpeg)\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nThe ApeCoin DAO Founders Circle holds transformative potential that directly aligns with the objectives of DAO vote AIP-259. This initiative strategically reinforces the proposed impact within selected markets by establishing offices and operational hubs in those markets. The initiative contributes to significant realization in selected markets, elevating brand visibility, onboarding Web2 to Web3, and fostering long-term growth for ApeCoin.\n\n**Selected Market Penetration**\n\nThe Founders Circle's approach of opening worldwide offices and operational hubs aligns perfectly with the intention to create significant impact in the selected markets identified by [AIP-259: Language and Market Focus for ApeCoin DAO in 2024-2025](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-259-language-and-market-focus-for-apecoin-dao-in-2024-2025/). This strategic alignment ensures that the ecosystem's presence is not only felt but also deeply integrated into these markets, effectively amplifying our reach and influence.\n\n\n**Promoting ApeCoin DAO**\n\nThe initiative's inclusion of showcasing the ApeCoin DAO logo on buildings in the selected markets further elevates our brand visibility and reputation. By creating localized touchpoints, it introduces the organization's values, technologies, and services to a broader audience, positioning ApeCoin DAO as a leading entity within the metaverse.\n\n**Onboarding Web2 to Web3**\n\nThe Founders Circle serves as a bridge for Web2 communities looking to enter the Web3 world. It provides a localized, supportive environment for tech companies and startups to learn about web3, NFTs, and blockchain technology, and our DAO facilitating a smooth transition into the crypto space.\n\n**Long-Term Growth and Expansion**\n\nThe multi-year timeline of the Founders Circle’s operations further enhances the lasting impact outlined in AIP-259. By establishing a continuous presence, we can cultivate enduring relationships with local investors, startups, and communities, contributing to the sustained growth and influence sought by the DAO.\n\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n9M $APE for 2024-2027, to be provided in tranches via a mechanism to be determined together with the APE Foundation at a later date.**\n\n![|624x339](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/1/144398c7e36667d2ea4451aec394bd43a3d93920_2_1248x678.png)\n\n![|624x407](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/7/775fd26492ab734e9c2c2d2484ee1d3c6ea4ff54_2_1248x814.png)\n\n\n![|624x407](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/9/9468e81ee4e6efb03a8fa297b61304ffaa2c6021_2_1088x1000.png)\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-321-founders-circle-powered-by-apecoin/12417\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\n*tl;dr - After overwhelming support and some feedback to improve, Bored Brewing wants to be the first AIP to give equity back to the DAO.*\n\nWe want to spread the word of ApeCoin by integrating $APE into the packaging of our beer and through explosive growth of our Made By Apes launch partner brand. This will include creating an $APE coin beer, QR codes on all cans and gamified educational content about the DAO and $APE, Web3 Gaming partnerships & sponsorships, and building out Distribution in Canada, USA, Europe and Asia, as well as a Bored Brewing Clubhouse/Taproom IRL and in The OTHERSIDE. You may even recognize us from Apefest as we were able to source production and manufacture beer that was provided to attendees at this year's Apefest in Hong Kong!\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\n1. We will work with the DAO and legal to give back 2% of equity to the DAO. This first of it’s kind give back will usher in the next wave of AIP’s and set the stage for true value creation within the DAO amplified by the marketing impact through branding, education and culture driven social content and sharing. By taking this on, Bored Brewing will lay the difficult, but exciting groundwork for giving back to the DAO.\n\n2. We will be spreading knowledge about $APE coin to less crypto native people who enjoy drinking beer. We believe that $APE can become a currency for the digital revolution and we want to be a small part of spreading the name to a demographic thirsty for this type of knowledge outside of the crypto community.\n\n3. We will sponsor partnered events and share the $APE coin brand across other relevant crypto/nft communities. The goal is to market the coin and share the background and goals of the DAO for the future.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n149,696 $APE Tokens\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-375-bored-brewing-ape-on-consumer-beverages-and-ape-taproom-aip-resubmission/20454/1\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

The ApeCoin DAO Founders Circle is an exclusive space and event hub designed to support early-stage blockchain and DeFi startups and promote ApeCoin DAO by educating the local tech communities about our vision and processes. This initiative includes access to online educational resources, 1:1 sessions, networking opportunities, exclusive invitations to IRL events, and access to ApeCoin DAO’s community and investor network. The benefits of funding this initiative include establishing ApeCoinDAO as a hub for early-stage startup founders and entrepreneurs, building a strong network of like-minded individuals, and increasing the visibility and reach of the organization in DAO’s selected markets.\n\n![image|624x312](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/0/09e48d918446865b046fdc980508b5ab83503d3c.jpeg)\n\nThese offices will serve as dynamic showcases for ApeCoin DAO, embodying a proactive approach to engage and educate local communities on pivotal topics such as $APE, the metaverse, and web3.\n\n![image|624x331](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/f/fe439debd56032c9b5e0553eba62917e305cc19b.jpeg)\n\n![image|624x327](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/7/7762741517011b67896da6560dabb2cea9175aef.jpeg)\n\nIn addition to the physical and digital activities hub we will offer at ApeCoin DAO Founders Circle, a platform to streamline our operations. This website will allow ApeCoin DAO members (via wallet) to access co-working spaces and participate in events through the use of tags, as well as the founders or guests. With this website, we aim to make it easier for individuals to make the most of our activities and services. The website will also have an education hub where users can access helpful materials, videos, and slides to continue their learning journey at their own pace.\n\n![image|446x500](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/d/d990bc04dbbfd9c5cddaae40e543493eb5f0fa61.jpeg)\n\n![image|624x445](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/8/8bcc48ff58a9e0193f466bd8000cc83a82fa5328.jpeg)\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nThe ApeCoin DAO Founders Circle holds transformative potential that directly aligns with the objectives of DAO vote AIP-259. This initiative strategically reinforces the proposed impact within selected markets by establishing offices and operational hubs in those markets. The initiative contributes to significant realization in selected markets, elevating brand visibility, onboarding Web2 to Web3, and fostering long-term growth for ApeCoin.\n\n**Selected Market Penetration**\n\nThe Founders Circle's approach of opening worldwide offices and operational hubs aligns perfectly with the intention to create significant impact in the selected markets identified by [AIP-259: Language and Market Focus for ApeCoin DAO in 2024-2025](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-259-language-and-market-focus-for-apecoin-dao-in-2024-2025/). This strategic alignment ensures that the ecosystem's presence is not only felt but also deeply integrated into these markets, effectively amplifying our reach and influence.\n\n\n**Promoting ApeCoin DAO**\n\nThe initiative's inclusion of showcasing the ApeCoin DAO logo on buildings in the selected markets further elevates our brand visibility and reputation. By creating localized touchpoints, it introduces the organization's values, technologies, and services to a broader audience, positioning ApeCoin DAO as a leading entity within the metaverse.\n\n**Onboarding Web2 to Web3**\n\nThe Founders Circle serves as a bridge for Web2 communities looking to enter the Web3 world. It provides a localized, supportive environment for tech companies and startups to learn about web3, NFTs, and blockchain technology, and our DAO facilitating a smooth transition into the crypto space.\n\n**Long-Term Growth and Expansion**\n\nThe multi-year timeline of the Founders Circle’s operations further enhances the lasting impact outlined in AIP-259. By establishing a continuous presence, we can cultivate enduring relationships with local investors, startups, and communities, contributing to the sustained growth and influence sought by the DAO.\n\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n9M $APE for 2024-2027, to be provided in tranches via a mechanism to be determined together with the APE Foundation at a later date.**\n\n![|624x339](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/1/144398c7e36667d2ea4451aec394bd43a3d93920_2_1248x678.png)\n\n![|624x407](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/7/775fd26492ab734e9c2c2d2484ee1d3c6ea4ff54_2_1248x814.png)\n\n\n![|624x407](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/9/9468e81ee4e6efb03a8fa297b61304ffaa2c6021_2_1088x1000.png)\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-321-founders-circle-powered-by-apecoin/12417\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

The substance of the proposals is ApeCoinDAO’s most compelling and accessible narratives.\n\n##### OVERALL COST \n90.000 ApeCoin, to be provide and cover administration, compensation and fees for the next 3 months of the data detailed in the proposal.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-336-pr-agency-for-apecoin-funded-projects-and-immersion-targeting/17596\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

Pixelynx, in partnership with renowned stars deadmau5 and Richie Hawtin have supported Pixelynx in building this platform which is now powered by a growing library of licensed content and AI models from iconic and emerging artists and record labels.  ![image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/8/86bbb2348ad791e75c43afc1f9ad9bf8cc45660a.jpeg)\n\nOur vision is to create a new economy for the music industry that helps artists, fans and collectors build real value together.\n\nWe believe music is a powerful medium to build community and unlock new forms of expression and growth. ApeCoin DAO is at the forefront of building a new economy that puts creators and collectors first! Music is evolving and new ways of creating, releasing and monetising music are here. The Korus platform has been designed to create a fairer way for artists, fans and collectors to grow the value of the music industry together by blurring the lines between music, gaming, AI and Web3. Korus AI companion owners can remix and even release AI generative songs in collaboration with their favourite artists, labels, brands and communities.\n\n![image2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/e/ec871a3b0e02459e0fb9e045a13d4764456aa330.jpeg)\n\nThis proposal presents ApeCoin holders the opportunity to benefit from exclusive ApeCoin tailored features that will deliver interactive music experiences across the metaverse and beyond. Korus was built to revolutionise the way music is collected, created, performed, monetised and shared. The Korus x ApeCoin DAO partnership aims to bring new music artists into the Yugaverse and support the ecosystem by enabling cutting edge music creation utility that is fueled by $APEcoin.\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n* A new $APEcoin utility is established\n* Opportunity to win $APEcoin prizes\n* Opportunity to win Music NFT’s\n* Exclusive KORUS features token gated for $APEcoin holders\n* Exclusive access to Artist DNA from renowned artists such as deadmau5 and Richie Hawtin\n* Exclusive artistic outputs for $APEcoin holders only\n\n##### OVERALL COST \n*$100.000 $APE for the competition reward pool. All $ape added to the reward pool will be used as rewards for those that participate in this campaign.\n\nMusic NFT prizes and All other costs (Ape.Kor NFT production and distribution, new functionalities in the system, marketing, community activations) will be handled by Pixelynx.\n\n*Please note, we are open to feedback and discussion around the competition reward pool amount, we see this as a great incentive to provoke creative participation but seek collaborative understanding here from Apecoin DAO’s perspective also.\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-339-apecoin-ai-remix-contest/18259\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThere is currently a gap between the NFT/creative/community crowd & and the developer, builder & investor crowd within the crypto community.\n\nA dedicated section for ApeCoin holders and lurkers within Cryptoevents.xyz will promote ApeCoin-related events and bring an understanding of the different ApeCoin initiatives.\n\nThis AIP provides for $20,000 in APE to build a custom ApeCoin events sheet within Cryptoevents.xyz, ApeCoin logo display based on RSVP’d ApeCoin holders. The custom designed ApeCoin section will help the ApeCoin community increase reach beyond “the NFT crowd” to other audiences within crypto. This initiative will further ApeCoin’s visibility and relevance within the broader web3 ecosystem.\n\n![image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/4/4d15298b71106cedef106e79dc28d7dbf97b3f22.png)\n![image2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/d/d5276c8712de413c7913d25175fbd435f537a8ac.png)\n\nSuccess will be measured by the volume of ApeCoin related events and traffic cryptoevents.xyz brings back to the ApeCoin community.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThe implementation of ApeCoin Events Hub on Cryptoevents.xyz offers a number of benefits to the ApeCoin Ecosystem:\n* Exposure to a brand new crypto audience: By integrating with an existing web3 platform with an existing audience, ApeCoin events will be more exposed to newcomers and more likely to gain meaningful adoption. After all, cryptoevents.xyz website visitors are crypto native, which makes them the perfect ApeCoin target audience\n* Increased engagement with existing members: ApeCoin holders will have a centralized hub to discover, participate in, or host ApeCoin events that advance web3 culture.\n* Easy discovery for non-holders, who will be able to access this page and learn more about ApeCoin and its initiatives. It is critical such a page is not token-gated and easy to access in order to increase ApeCoin’s reach.\n* The ApeCoin logo will be automatically be displayed on all major events where at least one ApeCoin holder is present, further providing an ongoing reminder that ApeCoin is an important participant not just in DAOs & NFTs, but also in the web3 builder ecosystem, attracting new collaborations and investors.\n* Encourage more collaboration between various segments of the web3 economy. By furthering the exposure of the ApeCoin community to a broader and more diverse crypto audience, this proposal will also indirectly help other ApeCoin initiatives, like the ETHGlobal sponsorships. For many crypto developers, cryptoevents.xyz is the best source of information on upcoming ETHGlobal hackathons. Through this partnership, ApeCoin’s participation will be further highlighted.\n* Accurate insights on who ApeCoin holders are and thus how to best serve them, because Cryptoevents.xyz allows attendees to RSVP to events with their Twitter socials\n\n![image3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/f/fb65313a61d27a4a7ed816198c4e059f8776a70b.png)\n![image4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/c/c0e0afde567ad124bdf495a9d2b2757b123843d7.png)\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nIn summary, the creation of a dedicated events page for ApeCoin holders on cryptoevents.xyz, as well as the prominent display of the ApeCoinDAO logo as a company attending main events will benefit the ApeCoin community by enhancing visibility, fostering engagement, and promoting cross-community collaboration within the web3 ecosystem. \n\nWe respectfully request a grant of $20,000 from the ApeCoin community to support this initiative, which aligns seamlessly with ApeCoin’s mission and values.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-349-apecoin-events-hub-on-cryptoevents-xyz/18858\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",

      "title": "AIP-364: The Battle for Goblin Town - A Bored Game ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nWe are near completion for an on-chain strategy game inspired by Settlers of Catan, titled\n“The Battle for Goblin Town.”  [See Twitter](https://twitter.com/GoblinTown_Game)\n ![image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/10e5bf8b8d49d45dd8ef3c8716c461af89745846.gif)\nActual gameplay footage. Image shows resource tiles, settlements, roads and in-progress battles\n\nBFGT combines the joy and nostalgia of a tabletop experience with the ownership and utility of web3, with a strategic decision-making system driven by economic game theory.\n\nOur initial plan was to independently launch the game in a more open manner but after discussions with key ApeCoin DAO members it became clear that our game could provide significant value to this community by making it exclusive to ApeCoin.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nOur intention with this AIP is to create an economically self-sustaining video game that lives on for a long time. We see this game providing real utility and enjoyment to the ApeCoin DAO and ApeCoin holders while introducing new users to the ApeCoin Ecosystem.\n* DAO REVENUE: -15% of the mint and ongoing game revenue will be returned directly to the ApeCoin DAO. -15% of ApeCoin generated during mint and ongoing game revenue will be burned (that is, transferred to a dead address, effectively removing it from circulation and reducing the supply). This creates what we believe is the first true ApeCoin Sink. -20% of ongoing game revenue will go towards supporting future prize pool (or burn).\n* VOTER AIRDROP: Voters who vote on this proposal will receive an airdrop of NFT Chests at a rate of 1 crate per 1,000 votes). Chests contain gameplay pieces: screelings, bosses, structures and cards. These pieces are NFTs that can either be used in-game or traded. Regarding the airdrop, the original holders will receive the crates, NOT the people they have delegated their ApeCoin to. To address this we will use the karma api to track delegates [https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/26295147/2s93RTPrfg](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/26295147/2s93RTPrfg)\n* $APE EXCLUSIVE: $APE will be used exclusively as the as the currency for minting and any non-resource purchases to buy into the game\n* For example: during gameplay, $APE can be used to buy card packs (card previews below)\n\nTHE MINT\nThe mint will be a 72 hour “open edition” to get crates for your initial game pieces. (Only one crate is required to play, but we expect most users will want to start with multiple crates).\n\nExpand the ApeCoin gaming ecosystem\n* Establish another strong Web3 game in the ApeCoin ecosystem\n* Provide diversity to the ecosystem by releasing a new genre of Web3 game\n* Growth in community through new players, cross-promotion with other ApeCoin games, and improved user retention\n\nMarketing\n* Improve brand visibility and attract a wider audience\n* Extend ApeCoin to a new demographic of players\n* Use of ApeCoin mark\nThe Battle for Goblin Town is directly aligned with the APE Community’s vision to be the foundation of Web3 culture through gaming, arts, and entertainment. We designed a game that embodies Web3 culture by focusing on the following goals:\n\nEngaging and Fun\n* The main motivation for developing The Battle for Goblin Town was to produce an entertaining, engaging, and social game. Never. Be. Bored.\n* We wanted to capture the same feeling that you get from playing any classic tabletop board game with your friends and family. A family that games together, stays together!\n* The core game loop is simple: Take over Goblin Town!\n* Players may accomplish this in many different ways, from forming alliances with their closest friends, negotiating trades with their neighbors, and taking calculated risks to expand your territory or destroy your enemies’ territories.\n Innovation\n* On-chain gaming\n    * NFT integration to provide true ownership of game assets\n* New gaming genre that combines strategy, social interaction, and “yield-farming”-style mechanisms\n\nPlay-to-Earn Mechanics\n* Collectors\n    * Unique and various rarity NFT collections between Goblin Bosses and Screelings (see photos below)\n* Competitors\n    * Establish prize pool to reward top players after each season\n* Opportunist\n    * Players may take advantage of economic opportunities on secondary markets by landing rare Bosses and Screelings, or farming booster packs\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nTOTAL: $2m (USD) in ApeCoin\n* 1.5m (USD) in ApeCoin\n* 500k (USD) in ApeCoin to be distributed as a prize pool across the first 3 seasons.\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-364-the-battle-for-goblin-town-a-bored-game/19537\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",

Through initiatives such as written proposal assessments, educational Twitter Spaces, and broadcasting interviews with community members, we would contribute to building a more vibrant, informed, bonded and engaged ApeCoin community.\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nThis proposal does not require funding from the ApeCoin DAO.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-348-apecomms-collaboration-for-education-and-community-building/19249\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",

      "title": "AIP-345: Ape Spirits Presents Twisted Ape Vodka For All Apes ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThis proposal presents the opportunity for all BAYC, MAYC, and $APE holders to claim a free bottle of Twisted Ape Ultra Premium Vodka produced by Ape Spirits, while simultaneously expanding the ApeCoin ecosystem with the launch of a new affordable luxury spirits brand that is Made By Apes, Powered By ApeCoin, and features Bored Apes on the packaging.\n\nApe Spirits will produce 50,000 bottles of Twisted Ape Ultra Premium Vodka, featuring several Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs on the labels, which will be licensed from the community, and offer these bottles for free, to be claimed by ApeCoin ecosystem members on our website. Other Twisted Ape products will also be available for purchase on our website in $APE only.\n\nWe intend to take this product mainstream, and approving this proposal will kickstart Ape Spirits on our mission of placing Twisted Ape affordable luxury products on the shelves of thousands of retail stores worldwide, exposing Apes and Apecoin to millions of shoppers on a global scale.\n\nThis AIP offers at least 7 direct benefits to the ApeCoin ecosystem:\n* Tangible IRL product in the hands of all Apes, Mutants, and $APE holders\n* Massive exposure and awareness of $APE to mainstream audiences\n* Onboarding normies to the ecosystem\n* IRL use case and spending of $APE\n* Renowned artists involvement and exposure\n* BAYC and MAYC licensing deals\n* Percentage of profits into a community controlled wallet\n\n![image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/a/a7eaeffbd05274febec645cf42fcc04e0d4e26cd.jpeg)\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nTwisted Ape has the potential to help proliferate the DAO in a manner that no other project has accomplished as of yet. We will not only reach 50,000 members who will receive the physical product, but also the entire network of people they share it with. This is in addition to the millions of people we intend to reach with our extensive marketing campaigns and distribution of Twisted Ape products at retail locations worldwide.\n\nWith Twisted Ape we present an abundance of benefits to the ApeCoin ecosystem with short, mid, long term, and perpetual benefits. To date there has yet to be a proposal that combines this many collective benefits to the ecosystem:\n\nShort/Mid Term: Upon approval of this proposal we will launch a targeted marketing campaign in which everyone will be made aware that the project was funded by the ApeCoin DAO. We will begin building in public, and the entire process from development, design, production, manufacturing and distribution of the products will be completely transparent and inclusive of the community. This will shine a positive light on the ecosystem and bring awareness to what we are capable of.\n\nWe will license several Bored Apes from the community allowing members to leverage their IP and earn revenue from the sales of a mainstream consumable product sold at thousands of retail outlets across the globe.\n\nAs a direct benefit to the members of the ecosystem, eligible members will be able to claim their share of the 50,000 bottles of Twisted Ape Ultra Premium Vodka for free. We will also offer a generous discount on any additional Twisted Ape products that are purchased on our website in $APE.\n\nWhile we are aware that a percentage of these bottles may become collectible items on a shelf, we believe most will be consumed as intended. Either way both will serve as great conversation starters. Members will have the opportunity to share this product with their family and friends, as well as their entire network across their social media platforms. This has the potential to reach an endless number of people who will be exposed to and learn about Apes and ApeCoin.\n\nLong Term/Perpetual: Twisted Ape is an officially licensed Made By Apes and Powered by ApeCoin product. All orders placed on our website will be in $APE only and every bottle of Twisted Ape will feature an Ape on the label. The Made By Apes and Powered by ApeCoin logos will be prominently displayed on the packaging (if allowed). This will be clearly visible to everyone who encounters any Twisted Ape product, regardless whether purchased online or in retail stores.\n\nThere will also be a qr code on the packaging directing customers to our website where we will have a dedicated page with a plethora of educational information about Apes and the ApeCoin ecosystem, including a live ticker showing the current price of $APE along with links to buy on exchanges.\n\nAlthough the DAO is not set up to receive revenue, we will allocate 5% of our profits from sales of Twisted Ape to a multisig community wallet. Members of the ecosystem can propose and vote on what to do with these funds as well as who the signers on this multisig will be.\n\nSince all of our bottles will feature a Bored Ape on the label, all our marketing efforts will always reference back to the ApeCoin ecosystem in one way or another. Our online and social media marketing campaigns will always default to our website as well. Visitors will be exposed to Apes and ApeCoin, and overall our website will serve as an onboarding platform for ApeCoin.\n\nThe cost to implement this AIP is miniscule considering the perpetual benefits our products will have on the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\nThis AIP offers at least 7 direct benefits to the ApeCoin ecosystem:\n* Tangible luxury product in the hands of all Apes and ApeCoin holders\n* Massive exposure to mainstream audiences with ads, retail space, and user generated content being shared across social media\n* Onboarding platform for normies and newbies\n* IRL use case and sink for spending $APE\n* Renowned artist involvement and exposure\n* BAYC and MAYC licensing deals\n* Percentage of profits into a community controlled wallet\n\n-The first benefit is directly for ecosystem members. All BAYC and MAYC holders will be automatically eligible to claim a bottle of Twisted Ape for each NFT they hold. Additionally, at least 20,000 wallets holding $APE will also be eligible to claim a bottle as well. Twisted Ape is a tangible IRL luxury product that members will receive at no cost to them.\n\n-The second benefit is the fact that this item will be distributed, sold, marketed, and advertised on a global scale to mainstream audiences. The fact that it is Made By Apes and Powered By ApeCoin is a major feature of the product that will be represented and highlighted prominently on the product packaging. This will bring an insurmountable amount of attention and direct impressions to the ecosystem.\n\n-The third benefit works in concert with the second. All our product packaging will include blatant displays of our products’ origins. This includes:\n* A Bored Ape front and center on the label and packing boxes.\n* QR codes that lead to our website which will provide education on BAYC, MAYC, Yuga Labs, and most importantly ApeCoin, along with a live price ticker and direct links to buy.\n* The Made By Apes and if allowed the Powered By ApeCoin logos.\n* If granted permission, the ApeCoin logo will be etched onto our bottle.\n\nThis will give exposure to ApeCoin and will provide a topic of conversation for those indulging among friends and family.\n\n-The fourth benefit is creating a solid utility for $APE. Twisted Ape will be available for purchase on our website, and the only payment method will be ApeCoin. This means that anyone wanting to buy a bottle will need to either be holding ApeCoin or need to purchase some. In both scenarios our site creates a center of commerce where premium tangible IRL goods are exchanged for ApeCoin. Very few coins have actual purchasing power outside of the crypto ecosystem, this feature alone will set ApeCoin apart from the herd of cryptocurrency tokens that exist with no valid use case.\n\n-The fifth benefit is our artistic packaging design inclusion program. Our outer packaging box will include the creative artistic expressions from numerous digital artists from all around the ecosystem. This box will serve as a canvas for them and the finished product will become a platform for them to share their work with audiences all over the world that may otherwise never be exposed to their creative work. We have already had the privilege of working with some amazing artists from within the space, and have seen the awe inspiring creativity from countless other artists we would be honored to have work with us on future releases of Twisted Ape branded products.\n\n-The sixth benefit is directly for BAYC and MAYC asset holders. We plan to work cohesively with ape owners to create licensing agreements and utilize their apes on limited edition, small batches, and themed products. Licensees will earn revenue from sales of Twisted Ape products not only from our website, but also from mainstream sales made at retail stores worldwide! To accomplish this we will be creating a partnership program specifically aimed at apes that want to have their assets featured on a bottle of Twisted Ape.\n\n-The seventh and last benefit works in tandem with the sixth, and benefits all members. We will be allocating 5% of profits made from all sales of Twisted Ape products to a community wallet. Funds will be deposited directly into this multisig wallet, and ecosystem members will get to decide not only who the signers of the wallet will be, but more importantly will also decide what the proceeds are used for.\nWe worked really hard putting this together and making sure we could provide the most possible tangible value to ApeCoin, the community, and the ecosystem as a whole. The result is a beautifully designed and great tasting luxury product.\n\nTwisted Ape will be enjoyed at countless social gatherings with friends and family. These live interactions will lead to IRL conversations that create awareness, exposure and recognition of the benefits of being a member of the ApeCoin DAO and the overall Ape ecosystem. The social connections and bonds made between adults sharing cocktails will spark word of mouth about our ecosystem that could potentially result in onboarding, aka a trojan horse.\n\nOne of our goals with Twisted Ape is not to just create a quality product, but also to provide the market with a complete work of art. A true expression of what happens when you merge two highly prolific creative industries in a perfect artistic marriage, and make it available for anyone to have and enjoy.\n\n![image2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/8/831825264ebd10dcb21f051e47d0b41d939ecc11.jpeg)\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nThe total cost to implement this proposal is 1,100,000 $APE. This amount covers the cost to manufacture 50,000 bottles of Twisted Ape Ultra Premium Vodka which we propose to deliver for free to ecosystem members.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-345-ape-spirits-presents-twisted-ape-vodka-for-all-apes/19080\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

Reach $400 000.00 transaction volume @ 1% = $4 000.00 per month. Months 9 to 12\n800 Made by Ape stores with $500.00 transactions per month will give us $400 000.00 total per month.\nProposal Notes:\n1. I have opted to leave out certain extras we could include like Jumpseller and Primer plugins for online stores. These are not currently available as part of the white label solution and development cost is an additional $3500.00 each\n2. We can include additional tokens at $750.00 each for wallet installation/integration.\n3. The application will not integrate with any banking solutions or credit card providers initially and will utilise crypto wallets to store funds. We would like to launch an ApeCoin credit card facility in future.\n4. Additional features and plugin integrations will be funded via earnings received to continue adding features and functionality to the platform.\n5. Monthly reporting will be provided for transparency.\n6. We aim to give back to the ApeCoin community via ThankApe and the ApeCoin Innovation Fund initiatives.\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-340-apecoin-payment-gateway/18974\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-346: Monthly Laughing Ape Stand-Up Comedy Show Utility for all $APE Holders ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nExclusive IRL + Live-Streamed Comedy shows for $APE Holders!\n\nIf you have $APE in your wallet, you can access the shows, if not, you better get some, sucka.\nThis AIP offers a fun, additional utility to $APE holders. This is a monthly event that every $APE holder from all over the world can participate in.\n\nAny of our normie friends who want to get in will have to buy and hold $APE to see the show. And with our tech partners NiftyKit (AIP-88) we can make that easy for them.\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nLaughing Ape, INC will bring needed laughter and fun to the DAO. It’s also an opportunity for $APE holders from around the world to gather for a series of exclusive events fostering camaraderie between DAO members. But look, In between shows y’all can go back to yelling at each other over governance, ok?\n\nHere’s how our Bored Silly AIP fits in with the guiding values of APE Foundation: Boldness: Ape Foundation doesn’t shy away from the weird, the hard, or the new. The Weird: Laughing Ape makes comedians perform live in front of a global, online audience while live-streaming in front of Anon MFers who wear Ape PFPs. You’re gonna tell me that’s not weird?! The New: Laughing Ape is pioneering new ways to integrate live comedy performance and blockchain technology. The Hard: Comedy is hard and so are we. We’re hard AF! Equality: One APE equals one APE. You’ve got 1 $APE, you get into the show. You’ve got 0 ape? GTFO and go buy one. Transparency: Processes and decisions are shared openly with the community. We’ll share our decision making process in how and why we book our shows the way we do. You’re probably not interested but we’re going to tell you anyway! Collective Responsibility: We leave everything better than we found it. Laughing Ape will make the DAO fun for its members. Yes, there is a lot of seriousness needed in the DAO but how about some unseriousness as well?

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThis AIP aims to build Apecoin DAO smart contract Wallets for GameFi NFts and establish a Lend assets & rewarding vault for the Game community.\n\nApecoin DAO Wallets wanted to implement active user engagement in a Game community by enabling GameFi Segment with the DAO and smart contract Wallets. With the rise of NFT-based P2E games, it’s crucial to build a community-driven ecosystem for NFT assets management in order to effectively rotate the assets among the active community members to Maximize the NFT DEFI potential.\n\nDAO wallets are structured to exclusively enable active wallets to retain assets for continued participation in the game. On inactivity, The DAO will conduct votes on idle assets to withdraw them from the member wallet into the assets vault, reallocating them to other members. This approach increases NFT scarcity and price in the market which will eventually attract more buyers and investment in the DAO-driven community. Furthermore, the DAO will offer incentives to participating voters, creating a constructive cycle of engagement.\n\nAll the DAO processes will run on a predefined set of rules to streamline community governance. Seamless management of NFT assets through the DAO platform sustains the blockchain-based games ecosystem.\n\n![image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/6/6cc01a786d0c0335451ada4bc221f6d44f9076fe.jpeg)\n\n![image2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/d/ded745e40339c0abadac738cfd2fb1947f08d921.jpeg)\n\n![image 3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/9/9a8132df963fe7a22a52f29a6f374ecb5ce9494d.jpeg)\n\nBackground\n\nThis AIP is entirely designed and will be developed by 99Starz Development team\nhttps://99starz.io/ \nhttps://gamefied.io/ \n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n* Add more value to the ApeDAO (and subDAOs) by adding the lending and gaming structure features\n* Bring in the ApeDAO a new fair business model\n* Increase the organic participation in the ApeDAO and subDAOs\n* Bring in new members to the ape community and effectively grow the community\n* Enable a safe and fair lending system to “put at work” all NFTs, thus increasing their use cases, value and market dynamics\n* Attract more players to the Ape-related games through the ApeDAOs and large investors and guilds\n* Make the ApeCoin ecosystem in general more guild friendly; large investors and guilds would feel more motivated on investing in Ape-related NFTs and projects and bringing their network into the action\n\n![image4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/1818c230ecdc86e112ae8bfc840b97366a5262fd.png)\n\n##### OVERALL COST \n$520k USD, denominated in ApeCoin.\n\n5-7 x games integration : 180k ApeDAO Custom features : 150k Enhanced security : 100k Maintenance, support, HW, SW, servers: 40k 50: various\n\nNB: the above are average estimated costs, pretty hard to predict exact development working hours and difficulty on integrating the games.

However, with as few as twenty active voters in recent weeks, there are growing concerns about the legitimacy that those elections would carry. Furthermore, we need Stewards who have experience in conducting significant outreach within the ApeCoin DAO community, which only DAO-wide campaigns can provide.\n\nCurrently, there will be four new Stewards elected in the upcoming Metaverse and Marketing and Communications Working Group elections scheduled to commence Nov 1, 2023, with approval to execute critical functions for the DAO moving forward.\n\nTo address these issues and enhance overall voting participation, this proposal recommends shifting future Working Group Steward elections from the Ape Assembly to a tried and true DAO-wide voting structure.\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThis AIP benefits the ApeCoin ecosystem by ensuring that Working Groups meet their mandates of providing critical functions and services to the DAO, and continuing to provide a voice for the broader ApeCoin DAO community through their ability to vote, while maintaining consistency with all other elections.\n\nThis AIP adheres to the DAO’s values of Collective Responsibility and Boldness by taking decisive action to address this issue of representation in Working Group Steward elections, and working towards progress over perfection.\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nNo Cost\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-347-enable-dao-wide-voting-for-working-group-stewards/19259\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThe purpose of this proposal is to give voting rights back to the broader ApeCoinDAO community and its delegations for Working Group Steward positions.\n\nThe Ape Assembly was established as a Governance Working Group Initiative outlined in AIP-239, aiming to facilitate Working Group Steward elections. However, with as few as twenty active voters in recent weeks, there are growing concerns about the legitimacy that those elections would carry. Furthermore, we need Stewards who have experience in conducting significant outreach within the ApeCoin DAO community, which only DAO-wide campaigns can provide.\n\nCurrently, there will be four new Stewards elected in the upcoming Metaverse and Marketing and Communications Working Group elections scheduled to commence Nov 1, 2023, with approval to execute critical functions for the DAO moving forward.\n\nTo address these issues and enhance overall voting participation, this proposal recommends shifting future Working Group Steward elections from the Ape Assembly to a tried and true DAO-wide voting structure.\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThis AIP benefits the ApeCoin ecosystem by ensuring that Working Groups meet their mandates of providing critical functions and services to the DAO, and continuing to provide a voice for the broader ApeCoin DAO community through their ability to vote, while maintaining consistency with all other elections.\n\nThis AIP adheres to the DAO’s values of Collective Responsibility and Boldness by taking decisive action to address this issue of representation in Working Group Steward elections, and working towards progress over perfection.\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nNo Cost\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-347-enable-dao-wide-voting-for-working-group-stewards/19259\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

We will be sponsoring partnered events and sharing the $APE coin brand across other relevant crypto/nft communities. The goal is to market the coin and share the background and goals of the DAO for the future.\n2. We will be spreading knowledge about $APE coin to less crypto native people who enjoy drinking beer. We believe that $APE can become a currency for the digital revolution and we want to be a small part of spreading the name to people outside of the crypto community.\n\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n$175,000 USD in $APE towards ApeCoin educational landings through trackable QR Codes, 10,000 Beer for Frens, ApeCoin DAO Dark Lager (name tbd) in the hands of normies, and 1 Lucky winner of their own Web3 IP Branded Beer!\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-341-bored-brewing-marketing-ape-to-beer-drinkers/19024\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-320: The Sweep: For Accelerating Web3 Gaming Adoption",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nIt costs $9 million to sweep 100 Bored Apes and 200 Mutants. I propose we buy them, hold them in the treasury, and allow game companies to submit proposals requesting them in addition to or in lieu of Apecoin for game prizes and rewards.\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nI’d love it if we were in an environment in which there were multiple play-to-earn games with significant prize pools creating Apecoin demand for their mints (assuming powered by Apecoin / Apecoin only mints). I find it hard to think of a better use for $9 million dollars in DAO funds than incentivising new entrants to buy Apecoin to compete for valuable prizes (Ape NFTs).\n\n$9 million dollars was arrived upon after calculating the rough cost to purchase 100 Bored Apes and 200 Mutants. The cost of these NFTs is highly volatile so this AIP specifies a dollar amount to spend rather than a number of NFTs to purchase. The number of Bored Apes and Mutants is proportional to their maximum supply, and large enough to create attractive prize pools in the Apecoin ecosystem.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n$9 million USD\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-320-the-sweep-for-accelerating-web3-gaming-adoption/17422\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-338: The First ApeCoin Sponsored Competitive E-Sports Tournament with Wreck League",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to raise awareness of $APE among traditional gamers by showcasing $APE as the official currency in a professional competitive esports tournament–the Wreck League ApeCoin Tournament–featuring grand prizes designated in $APE. This will demonstrate $APE’s utility as a gaming currency, while also rewarding thousands of ApeCoin community members who already use their NFT mechs to fight in Wreck League battles.\n\nAs many of you know, starting on August 31st, Yuga holders claimed their fight-ready Wreck League mechs as part of the [Wreck League Founders Mechs](https://opensea.io/collection/wreck-league-founders-mechs) collection. Additionally, [Wreck League Season 1 powered by ApeCoin](https://www.wreckleague.xyz) is already onboarding new ApeCoin users, showcasing bold new ways to use $APE by powering the Wreck League Web3 fighting game. The Wreck League Genesis Mint, as an example, brought in over 7,500 new $APE holders and generated over 1.5 million $APE in daily transaction volume.\n\nWe are asking the ApeCoin community to approve the organization of the Wreck League ApeCoin Tournament and to allocate grand prizes in the total amount of 50,000 $APE to be distributed among the winners of this first, and certainly not last, competitive esports tournament using $APE as the official tournament awards token.\n\n![ApeCoin_Tournament_Lobby_Mockup_50k](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/4/4f8325e5ab28e103fd49d59110013a550663ae7a.jpeg)\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nA Wreck League ApeCoin Tournament will strengthen ties among the ApeCoin community while generating awareness among traditional gamers during this holiday season and ultimately promoting the adoption and demand for $APE by showcasing ApeCoin utility in a competitive gaming tournament.\n\nDeveloped through the collaboration of nWay and Animoca Brands with the participation of Yuga Labs, **Wreck League Season1 is powered by ApeCoin**. As members of the ApeCoin community, Yat Siu of Animoca Brands and Taehoon Kim of nWay proactively decided to integrate $APE as the primary currency for the Wreck League Season 1 mints and tournaments utilities. The team introduced **pricing in ApeCoin**: 150$APE for Wreck League Majestic boxes and 50$APE for Wreck League Booster boxes. The Wreck League Genesis Mint contributed to a **daily transaction volume of over 1.5 million $APEs**. Moreover, it is worth noting that leading to Wreck League Genesis Mint, an **increase of about 7,500 new $APE holders** was observed, arguably driven by Wreck League Mint buyers buying $APE for the first time in preparation to mint their Wreck League boxes on the morning of August 17.\n.\n\n![2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/9/92b3a9ba098b4fdad5c4e28cf3f90309d30c3506.png)\n\nnWay, the developer behind Wreck League, is a reputable game developer founded in 2011 with over 50MM downloads of their traditional fighting games. As recently covered in a sponsored [Tiger report](https://reports.tiger-research.com/p/web3-fighting-games-in-korea), Wreck League is poised to bridge nWay’s existing reach among traditional fighting-game players to Web3 gaming by introducing a set of optional yet powerful Web3 gaming utilities, including but not limited to: 1) Customizing and building unique mech NFTs; 2) Entering PvP Wreck League fighting tournaments and competitions to win on-chain rewards; and 3) Delivering a patented, first-of-its-kind NFT to in-app-store publishing and revenue sharing model for mech NFT owners.\n\nIn conclusion, by leveraging Wreck League’s reach to traditional gamers, ApeCoin’s active Wreck League fighters, and the native integration with $APE, the Wreck League ApeCoin Tournament is a unique and timely opportunity to effectively raise awareness to ApeCoin among mainstream gamers audiences, reward existing ApeCoin community members, and ultimately onboard new members to the community this holiday season.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n**ApeDAO Costs:**\nThe total cost for the ApeDAO is 50,000 $APE, fully allocated towards Tournament Rewards.\n\n**Wreck League, nWay Costs:**\nFor clarification, the following costs are not accrued by the ApeDAO and are not requested for ApeDAO approval. These estimate costs will be covered by nWay to produce and promote the Wreck League ApeCoin Tournament.\n\n* nWay Tournament Production and Marketing Cost Breakdown. For clarification, this Production and Marketing Cost breakdown shall be covered by nWay and is not requested for approval by the ApeDAO.\n\n![nWay_ApeCoin_Tournament_Prod_CostBreakdown](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/9/92b3a9ba098b4fdad5c4e28cf3f90309d30c3506.png)\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-338-the-first-apecoin-sponsored-competitive-e-sports-tournament-with-wreck-league/18874\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-335: Bored Ape Gazette Powered By ApeCoin",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nThe Bored Ape Gazette is asking the ApeCoin DAO to fund the Bored Ape Gazette for another year to further amplify the DAO and Yugaverse, and enable the Gazette to add weekly Twitter spaces and daily short form animated video content to its output!\n\n  ![image1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/2/2e53834df1adf8ccac5c8dbe82f06db0c35d659b_2_1380x784.jpeg)\n\nSince June 1, 2021, the Bored Ape Gazette has been a part of the Yugaverse, providing daily coverage from the swamp and giving the community a go-to news source across the growing Yuga ecosystem. Over the last year, we have seen the community grow larger with several projects contributing to the Yugaverse such as Applied Primate, Mutant Cartel, and Mocaverse, among others. The Gazette is committed to continuing to build a trusted source of information for this ecosystem for years to come and would love for the paper to be powered by ApeCoin for another year!\n\n  ![image2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/7/79a856ec594bb227ca43ac66d74cbdb5e33638b6.webp)\n\nThanks to the ApeCoin DAO’s support of AIP-70 last year, The Bored Ape Gazette was able to expand daily news coverage from 1.5 stories published per day to an average of 4 stories published per day and grow its Twitter audience from 10,000 Followers to nearly 30,000 followers. Today the Gazette averages over 500,000 monthly impressions on Twitter! Along with increased exposure on Twitter, the Gazette has also seen its website viewership go from a few thousand views a month to an average monthly viewership of 13,000! To date, the Gazette has published over 2,200 news articles, 52 weekly newsletter recaps, covered IRL events, live tweeted from important DAO meetings, and reported on important Twitter Space every week! In addition, with funds from last year’s approved AIP-70, the Gazette hired a website designer who has made the website more user-friendly, added a cryptocurrency ticker, an ApeCoin price chart page, and a new community calendar to reflect current and future events and Twitter Spaces!\n\n  ![image3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/f/f1ec136ec566e2b21efc017f486367e0ca75cab6_2_1380x956.jpeg)\n\nWith the funds requested in this proposal, the Gazette will continue to produce 3-5 Yugaverse/ ApeCoin stories per day, continue its two bi-weekly newsletters (Keeping Tabs On The Lab And The ApeCoin DAO-N Low), add daily animated news segments that will be shared across Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, start a Twitter Space series where the paper will interview builders, and add more amazing features to its website such as a language plug in, Yugaverse timeline, an “on this day in Bored history” section, additional ApeCoin metrics and numbers such as staking analytics, a new email blast campaign that will send subscribers a quick rundown on the swamp, the addition of dark mode, among other things!\n\nWith your continued support, the future of the Bored Ape Gazette will be very $Ape-ish and everyone inside and outside the Yugaverse will see a lot more $Ape content!\n\nHere’s how much Ape and Yuga Labs content the Gazette will be putting out with this expansion every month!\n\n  ![image3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/7/747310e454dc904f1c24d5b2e6bc72c7fd487eb3_2_984x1000.png)\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nThe Bored Ape Gazette currently produces an average of four written articles per day, providing both those within and outside the Yugaverse with a go-to news source for information on all things $Ape! This AIP will empower the Gazette to maintain this level of written output while also enabling the addition of daily short-form video news content that will be shared on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. This new video content will reach new audiences who may not have the time to read the Gazette or be familiar with the ecosystem, giving them a chance to learn about all things $Ape and Yuga. This, in turn, will lead to increased exposure for the DAO, expand $Ape’s reach, and make the community better informed!\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n**Total: $150,000 USD worth of $Ape:**\n\n* Cost Breakdown\n\n**Content Creation For The Year: $120,000 USD. The Gazette will produce at least 1460 articles, 365 animated videos, 48 Twitter Spaces, 26 Keeping Tabs on The Lab Newsletters, and 26 ApeCoin DAO-N Low Newsletters, in the next year. That breaks down to $63.93 per article/video/ newsletter cost basis.\n\nCost to create news video animations: $18,000 USD\n\nLanguage plug in: $1200 USD\n\nAdditional website building and new Ape analytics $10,000 USD\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-335-bored-ape-gazette-powered-by-apecoin/18124\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP.

      "title": "AIP-320: The Sweep: For Accelerating Web3 Gaming Adoption",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nIt costs $9 million to sweep 100 Bored Apes and 200 Mutants. I propose we buy them, hold them in the treasury, and allow game companies to submit proposals requesting them in addition to or in lieu of Apecoin for game prizes and rewards.\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nI’d love it if we were in an environment in which there were multiple play-to-earn games with significant prize pools creating Apecoin demand for their mints (assuming powered by Apecoin / Apecoin only mints). I find it hard to think of a better use for $9 million dollars in DAO funds than incentivising new entrants to buy Apecoin to compete for valuable prizes (Ape NFTs).\n\n$9 million dollars was arrived upon after calculating the rough cost to purchase 100 Bored Apes and 200 Mutants. The cost of these NFTs is highly volatile so this AIP specifies a dollar amount to spend rather than a number of NFTs to purchase. The number of Bored Apes and Mutants is proportional to their maximum supply, and large enough to create attractive prize pools in the Apecoin ecosystem.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nThe total cost of the 12 month “Powered by” sponsorship is $60,000 USD. This will allow Krafter to put full-time focus on growing our Podcast Network in the Metaverse, including content production, marketing, and community engagement. Thank you for the support and I hope to have you on the show someday soon if you’d like to be a guest!\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-320-the-sweep-for-accelerating-web3-gaming-adoption/17422\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

This adjustment will be applicable to all future terms as detailed in [AIP-137 ](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-137-the-special-council-nomination-process/8849) and [AIP-138](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-138-the-special-council-election-process/8850), exclusively affecting Special Council members elected after the implementation of this proposal.\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nFinancially, the DAO stands to accrue savings of up to $104,165 ApeCoin monthly. It will also elevate community engagement by granting ApeCoin holders the opportunity to vote on this delicate matter, enhancing the overall governance.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n$0.

      "title": "AIP-335: Bored Ape Gazette Powered By ApeCoin",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nThe Bored Ape Gazette is asking the ApeCoin DAO to fund the Bored Ape Gazette for another year to further amplify the DAO and Yugaverse, and enable the Gazette to add weekly Twitter spaces and daily short form animated video content to its output!\n\n  ![image1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/2/2e53834df1adf8ccac5c8dbe82f06db0c35d659b_2_1380x784.jpeg)\n\nSince June 1, 2021, the Bored Ape Gazette has been a part of the Yugaverse, providing daily coverage from the swamp and giving the community a go-to news source across the growing Yuga ecosystem. Over the last year, we have seen the community grow larger with several projects contributing to the Yugaverse such as Applied Primate, Mutant Cartel, and Mocaverse, among others. The Gazette is committed to continuing to build a trusted source of information for this ecosystem for years to come and would love for the paper to be powered by ApeCoin for another year!\n\n  ![image2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/7/79a856ec594bb227ca43ac66d74cbdb5e33638b6.webp)\n\nThanks to the ApeCoin DAO’s support of AIP-70 last year, The Bored Ape Gazette was able to expand daily news coverage from 1.5 stories published per day to an average of 4 stories published per day and grow its Twitter audience from 10,000 Followers to nearly 30,000 followers. Today the Gazette averages over 500,000 monthly impressions on Twitter! Along with increased exposure on Twitter, the Gazette has also seen its website viewership go from a few thousand views a month to an average monthly viewership of 13,000! To date, the Gazette has published over 2,200 news articles, 52 weekly newsletter recaps, covered IRL events, live tweeted from important DAO meetings, and reported on important Twitter Space every week! In addition, with funds from last year’s approved AIP-70, the Gazette hired a website designer who has made the website more user-friendly, added a cryptocurrency ticker, an ApeCoin price chart page, and a new community calendar to reflect current and future events and Twitter Spaces!\n\n  ![image3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/f/f1ec136ec566e2b21efc017f486367e0ca75cab6_2_1380x956.jpeg)\n\nWith the funds requested in this proposal, the Gazette will continue to produce 3-5 Yugaverse/ ApeCoin stories per day, continue its two bi-weekly newsletters (Keeping Tabs On The Lab And The ApeCoin DAO-N Low), add daily animated news segments that will be shared across Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, start a Twitter Space series where the paper will interview builders, and add more amazing features to its website such as a language plug in, Yugaverse timeline, an “on this day in Bored history” section, additional ApeCoin metrics and numbers such as staking analytics, a new email blast campaign that will send subscribers a quick rundown on the swamp, the addition of dark mode, among other things!\n\nWith your continued support, the future of the Bored Ape Gazette will be very $Ape-ish and everyone inside and outside the Yugaverse will see a lot more $Ape content!\n\nHere’s how much Ape and Yuga Labs content the Gazette will be putting out with this expansion every month!\n\n  ![image3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/7/747310e454dc904f1c24d5b2e6bc72c7fd487eb3_2_984x1000.png)\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nThe Bored Ape Gazette currently produces an average of four written articles per day, providing both those within and outside the Yugaverse with a go-to news source for information on all things $Ape! This AIP will empower the Gazette to maintain this level of written output while also enabling the addition of daily short-form video news content that will be shared on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. This new video content will reach new audiences who may not have the time to read the Gazette or be familiar with the ecosystem, giving them a chance to learn about all things $Ape and Yuga. This, in turn, will lead to increased exposure for the DAO, expand $Ape’s reach, and make the community better informed!\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n**Total: $150,000 USD worth of $Ape:**\n\n* Cost Breakdown\n\n**Content Creation For The Year: $120,000 USD. The Gazette will produce at least 1460 articles, 365 animated videos, 48 Twitter Spaces, 26 Keeping Tabs on The Lab Newsletters, and 26 ApeCoin DAO-N Low Newsletters, in the next year. That breaks down to $63.93 per article/video/ newsletter cost basis.\n\nCost to create news video animations: $18,000 USD\n\nLanguage plug in: $1200 USD\n\nAdditional website building and new Ape analytics $10,000 USD\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-335-bored-ape-gazette-powered-by-apecoin/18124\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",

      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nThe project involves creating a papercraft model of the Apecoin logo, digital (unlimited edition) and physical (101 units limit edition). The papercraft model will be designed to be easily printable and assembled by anyone, and will be made available for free to the Apecoin community.\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nNovelty: The physical papercraft model is a unique and novel way to engage with the Apecoin community. It provides a tangible representation of the Apecoin brand that people can display and share with others.\n\nPromotional Opportunities: Physical papercraft models can be used as promotional items at events or conferences. They can also be given away as prizes in social media contests or other promotions, which can help increase the visibility of the project.\n\nCollectible: Physical papercraft models can be seen as collectible items, which may encourage people to hold onto them for longer periods of time. This could help increase the longevity of the project and the exposure of the Apecoin brand.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nBreakdown of Costs\n\n|Proposal Item|Apecoins|\n| --- | --- |\n|Design Papercraft/Model Development/Instructions|2,125|\n|Physical Papercraft Model Production|2,125|\n|Reporting/Delivery/Materials|1,493|\n|Educational Materials Creation|500|\n|Total|6,243* ($8,798.15 USD)|\n\n\n\n*This includes taxes that we have to treat as capital gains in Spain (21%) and the following material:\n\n|Material for 101 papercrafts|Quantity|Weight/Size|Cost (Apecoins)|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|A4 cardstock sheets white|600|180g|included|\n|Kraft/white bright/matte finish paper packages printed|110|300g|included|\n|A5 notebooks 170g matte finish printed|110|160g|included|\n|Cameo 4|1||included|\n|Software (Adobe/Pepakura/Blender)|1||included|\n\n\nWe are requesting **$8,798.15 USD worth of ApeCoin** to cover the costs associated with the creation of the Apecoin papercraft project, including the development of the digital and a limited edition of 101 physical papercraft models and the creation of educational materials.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-322-apecoin-papercraft/17229\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nCreating a home for the ApeCoin community within the tokenproof mobile app will help increase community participation, enable member onboarding, highlight community projects, and further incentivize ownership of ApeCoin by securing dedicated mobile real estate to distribute news, content, and experiences offered to community members.\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nThe integration of a dedicated ApeCoin Community Hub within the tokenproof app promises a number of benefits to the ApeCoin Ecosystem:\n\n- **Enhanced Community Engagement**: By aggregating information, news, and opportunities, the hub will act as a catalyst for more active participation among ApeCoin holders. This can lead to higher voting rates for proposals and a more vibrant, engaged community.\n- **Increased Awareness and Onboarding**: The hub will serve as a centralized platform for ApeCoin holders to learn about the various benefits, projects, and initiatives. This can lead to greater involvement from holders who may have been previously unaware or passive.\n- **Boost in ApeCoin Projects**: A dedicated section for ApeCoin projects will provide them with the visibility they need, enabling them to gain traction and support from the community. This not only helps these projects flourish but also strengthens the overall ApeCoin ecosystem.\n- **Consolidated Communication Channel**: The hub will act as a one-stop-shop for all things ApeCoin, reducing the need for holders to juggle between various platforms like Twitter, Discord, and Snapshot. This streamlining can lead to better information dissemination and more coherent community discussions.\n- **Incentivized Ecosystem Growth**: The hub can also act as a platform for collaborations, partnerships, and joint ventures between different ApeCoin projects. This fosters an environment of mutual growth and collaboration within the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nIf the AIP is approved and funding secured, $80,000 USD (in its $APE equivalent) would be reserved and awarded incrementally upon delivery of the aforementioned capabilities, and according to funding schedule above. The funds obtained in this AIP will provide the ability to finance the development of the initial scope, support, bug fixes, minor updates, and maintenance costs for the duration of the AIP.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-332-a-dedicated-apecoin-community-hub-within-tokenproof-app/17605\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nADSHARES is asking the APECOIN DAO to provide funding to create an **APE AD MARKETPLACE**, which will enable Otherdeed owners and creators to monetize their creations and lands with ads – and take in ad revenue in ApeCoin.\n\nWhile we see this ecosystem as open to external advertisers – it’s primarily designed as an **internal ad network** - one that would enable the DAO, the Creators (Yuga, Animoca, Improbable), the Otherdeed owners, and Experience creators or Celebrities to promote their work across all Metaverses.\n\nWe have already proven successful in creating such infrastructure for Decentraland. 90K+ lands have direct access to an advertising network, and over 100 parcel owners have joined, creating the largest ad network there. And everyone - from the DCL DAO, through Land owners and experience designers, to regular brands can place their ads automatically, in a couple of clicks, using the [web3ads.net](http://web3ads.net/) ad server. A whole APECOIN AD marketplace could be created - where advertisers buy placements directly from creators. Now, we want to take this to the Otherside.\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\n* It opens **a new, sustainable revenue stream for the ApeCoin community** → Monetizing user traffic with ads\n* It can **integrate ALL of the ApeCoin elements: The Otherside, the Website, Game sites** (DookieDash, Legends of the Mara) and many others\n* It **increases demand for APE** → All ad revenue is paid in APE.\n* Payments for ads are done on chain, in crypto.\n* **Any APE holder can place their ad on the ad server** - promote their project inside the ApeCoin Ecosystem\n* It brings **new utility for NFT lands** → Otherdeed owners can earn APE by placing ads on their property. They can also advertise their products and services.\n* Advertising allows us to **build deeper relationships with world-leading brands, thus accelerating the Metaverse adoption**.\n* ApeCoin DAO has **complete ownership over all crucial aspects of the ad system**.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nAdServer setup and customization|$25K|\n| --- | --- |\n|AdScoring system|$10K|\n|Management|$15K|\n|OpenRTB connector|$5K|\n|ApeCoin integration|$5K|\n|**Total**|**$60K**|\n\n**Preamble:** the below break down represents the actual COST on our side: man-hours, resources etc.\nHowever - in order to prove our motivations and our vision - we want to offer the APECOIN DAO a 30% discount.\nThe total cost of implementation listed below would be **USD $40K**.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-302-create-an-advertising-marketplace-for-apecoin-ecosystem/15980\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-328: AIP Idea: Apecoin Listing on COINHERO Crypto ATMs (ApeFest Hong Kong 2023) & ATM Installation at ApeFest HQ",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\n1. To list Apecoin ($APE) on COINHERO’s Crypto ATM Network for preparation of ApeFest 2023 in Hong Kong.\n2. To host an ATM machine at ApeFest HQ located at PMQ, Central, Hong Kong, during ApeFest 2023.\n\n#### BENEFIT TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nThis proposal aims to benefit the APECOIN Ecosystem by spreading its community and values to the wider community public through physical access to the token via ATM machines. Where most people are used to interacting with regular bank ATM machines, our crypto ATM machines provide a familiar experience, lowering entry barriers. Additionally, providing an ATM machine at ApeFest, allows event goers to buy $APE at a convenient physical location.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nToken Listing: US$10,500 or Apecoin equivalent for 1 year. This listing fee will go towards technical integration and marketing for a period of 12 months.\n\nToken Supply: 10,000 Apecoin. These tokens will be used for customer settlement on the exchange back-end during ATM transactions. These tokens shall be returned upon the end of token listing.\n\nATM Hosting (3 days during ApeFest Nov 3-5): US$500 or Apecoin equivalent per day. This will go towards installing the ATM machine and its daily management.\n[/quote]\n\nTotal (assuming $APE @ $1.22): US$24,200\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-328-aip-idea-apecoin-listing-on-coinhero-crypto-atms-apefest-hong-kong-2023-atm-installation-at-apefest-hq/18036\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",

      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\n“It is in giving that we receive.” - Francis of Assisi\n\nThe core of this proposal centers around promoting collaboration for the greater good of humanity and making a positive impact on individuals’ health and happiness.\n\nW3 Labs, recognized for their development of dot ape domains on the Ethereum chain, actively supports the decentralized Apecoin token to facilitate transactions, showcasing their dedication to enhancing the utility of the ape coin community. They provide these domains as a means for individuals to establish their digital identity within the Web3 realm and seamlessly engage with popular decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nAs an expression of gratitude, this proposal suggests providing the DAO with relevant domains at no expense, along with a monetary contribution to an organization chosen by the DAO/community.\n\nThis proposal is simply about extending a helping hand to the DAO’s compassionate virtue, contributing a little from Labs for societal good, and securing digital identity for DAO as well. W3 Labs proposes to donate $50K from their side and would love the ApeCoin DAO to also match that contribution to a charity of DAO’s and community choice.\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\n* Community Goodwill: A donation from W3 Labs, matched by ApeCoin DAO, demonstrates our commitment to charity efforts and philanthropy goals.\n\n* Helping Others: Empowering individuals in their time of need, providing hope for a better future, supported by the leading Web3 community.\n\n* Increased Visibility: Collaborating with renowned organizations boosts global presence.\n\n* Positive PR and Mainstream Attention: Engaging content promotes ApeCoin's values. Enhanced by custom creatives to highlight our actions across social and digital media.\n\n* Transparency and Accountability: Financial Reports ensure trust in the $100,000 deployment in donation(s).\n\n* Enhanced Digital Security and Identity: Free Dot ape domains on Ethereum improve user identity, security, and trust within Web3.\n\n* Existing Use Case for ApeCoin: Dot ape domains powered by the decentralized $apecoin token adds extra utility to the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nIn terms of cost implications, we assure the DAO of our commitment to bear the entirety of the expenses associated with the creation, implementation and operation of this proposal. The DAO's contribution is solely towards matching the $50,000 donation, which will be triggered only after Dot Ape has transferred the equivalent amount to the DAO.\n\nWe genuinely believe in the confluence of professionalism, trust, and altruism as we venture into this journey. Looking forward to advancing our shared values in the realm of Web3, and strengthening the spirit of community and compassionate action.\n\n> \"Thank you for your time and support. We, at W3 Labs, remain dedicated to making a positive impact and welcome your input.\"\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-298-transforming-lives-with-a-100k-donation-apecoin-dao-and-w3-labs-take-action-for-positive-change/16164\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP.

To better engage learners and bridge the gap between web2 and web3, we are introducing the Otherside initiative, A way for creators to use Yugalabs Otherside to create interactive courses alongside our traditional PowerPoint curricula. All successful participants who complete a course will be issued an SBT (Soul Bound Token) certificate of competency, and those without a digital wallet have the option of a digital PDF.\n\nThe platform merges web2 with web3 blockchain technology to create a more efficient learning environment. Through our Governance token, we incentivize high-quality content creation, reward educators, and make educational resources accessible to students. SBT metadata will also be refreshed as students complete other courses on the platform, providing a digital CV/resume.\n\n  ![image1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/a/a008fe86b2a6f3101444a9ad80e9a4ebe4b38f80.png)\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nPhase 1 $50,000 USD\nPhase 2 **Unknown** *Will get a better understanding once Otherside integrations are released.*\n\nWe propose a kickstart of $50,000 in ApeCoin for Phase 1, and also enable our platform to use APE coin as a payment gateway.

      "title": "AIP-301: [Eesee-ApeCoin] A Collaboration for Community Engagement and NFT Accessibility",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nThis proposal introduces a strategic alliance between Eesee, a gamified NFT platform, and ApeCoin DAO. The partnership is designed to democratize access to high-value NFTs, stimulate community interaction, and inspire active involvement in ApeCoin governance, and enhance the visibility of ApeCoin’s sub-communities.\n\n#### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nThe proposed partnership will provide ApeCoin DAO and its sub-communities with the opportunity to tap into Eesee’s growing user base, a demographic that is deeply interested in NFT trading. Additionally, the proposal aims to build a deeper connection between our two communities through exclusive NFT drops, special events, and educational quests.\n\nThese quests, inspired by “Coinbase Earn”, will provide engaging and educational content about ApeCoin and its sub-communities. The introduction of educational quests will encourage ApeCoin holders to learn more about the ApeCoin ecosystem, participate in governance, and contribute to the community. Upon completion, users will be rewarded with dynamic NFT badges that not only serve as a token of achievement but also provide access to exclusive content or events.\n\nFor instance, these badges could be used for token-gating, where only holders of certain level badges (e.g., Level 3 ApeCoin badge holders) can participate in specific raffles. This mechanism encourages active involvement and learning within the ApeCoin ecosystem, while also bringing attention to the sub-communities.\n\nAlso, the quests will include updates from the sub-communities, inspiring participants to interact more actively with these platforms and join their Twitter spaces. This approach will help to democratize access to high-value NFTs, cultivate a more vibrant, engaged community, and increase governance participation.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nAs this proposal does not involve a funding request, there is no associated cost to the ApeCoin DAO. The implementation will be carried out by the Eesee team.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-301-eesee-apecoin-a-collaboration-for-community-engagement-and-nft-accessibility/16706\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

It initiates a more decentralized ApeCoin DAO through the GWG adopting a new non-profit DAO LLC structure, distinctly separate from the Foundation as a grouping of grant recipients and service providers.\n\nThe budget also includes provisions for conducting inclusive third-party sustainability and compliance studies tailored to the ApeCoin DAO and outlines plans to create a global community committee, bringing representatives together from delegations worldwide in a think-tank environment. Additionally, there are plans for a governance-centric community rewards program to incentivize actionable suggestions for operations process improvements.\n\nAn ApeCoin DAO voting and AIP analytics dashboard will be developed and a collaboration with Alex McCurry and Solidity.io will elevate the Apecoin.com website by providing language selection choices and enhancing the overall user experience to motivate visitors to delve deeper into the ApeCoin ecosystem. The GWG will closely coordinate with the recently approved Marketing & Communications Working Group to ensure that alignment with the ApeCoin brand identity is adhered to. \n\nThe proposal presents a comprehensive framework of Objectives and Key Result (OKR) measurements designed to ensure accountability, inform the community about initiative progress, and hold Governance Working Group personnel accountable for their roles.\n\nThe Governance Working Group is a seven-person team comprised by Amplify, ALL CITY, Tiger, Lost, 12Guage, CryptoLogically and Vulkan.\n\n\n![Untitled design-8|690x314](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/f/f2a9bd9818228d75b9303320a670aed99186777a_2_1380x628.jpeg)\n\n\n\n![091423timeline|690x425](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/e/e6217a7389f2770108f5f4727b4bec1b4795fca3_2_1380x850.jpeg)\n\n#### BENEFIT TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nThis proposal is aimed at enhancing the ApeCoin ecosystem in multiple ways. First, it seeks to uphold our commitment to providing seamless day-to-day DAO operations and an efficient AIP process. It introduces critical research and development ventures focused on broader economic sustainability and compliance for the ApeCoin DAO. Moreover, it places significant emphasis on community empowerment through various committee programs, thereby giving community members a more impactful role in the ApeCoin DAOs decision-making processes.\n\nTo recap, the proposal's core benefits encompass continued operational efficiency, sustainable legal frameworks, fiscal responsibility towards DAO spending, innovative R&D initiatives, and enhanced community involvement.\n\n1. **Ongoing Operations of the ApeCoin DAO:** Continue to effectively manage the day-to-day operations of the ApeCoin DAO including AIP processing, facilitating Discourse and Discord, overseeing elections, drafting and implementing budgets, coordinating community committees, and implementing process improvements.\n\n2. **Sustainability and Compliance Strategies:** Contract research firms to gain actionable insights and assess on-chain structures to better understand economically sustainable options for the broader ApeCoin DAO, prioritizing a non-custodial environment.\n\n3. **Increased Adoption of APE:** We anticipate that our sustainability study and enhanced governance will stimulate both adoption and value within the ecosystem. This will offer an essential strategy for the APE token, enabling its widespread utilization across DeFi and web3 platforms. \n\n4. **Enhanced Transparency:** Provide detailed quarterly reports on expenditures, offering comprehensive insights into the DAO's spending patterns for the community, while identifying potential areas for optimization.\n\n5. **Building the Working Group Blueprint:** As the first Working Group to be established and newly assembled, we will take no chances in building a safe, compliant organizational structure with the right professional service providers and advisors mentoring our every step. Our goal is simple: to become the gold standard of all Working Groups and build out the framework for others to follow.\n\n6. **Website and Dashboard Development:** Elevate the user experience on Apecoin.com by creating a captivating interface that welcomes users, enables language selection and motivates visitors to explore and discover more about ApeCoin and the ApeCoin DAO. Our governance dashboard will display real-time analytics on key voting and AIP metrics as well as the ApeCoin DAO treasury.\n\n7. **Community Empowerment:** Increase decentralized decision-making within the ApeCoin DAO and empower members to drive impactful change through committees and other initiatives aimed at providing a larger voice to constituents.\n\n![2|690x160](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/4/494c0e970e84480d1bedfd3cd966be5f1a40763c_2_1380x320.png)\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nThis budget proposal requests the allocation of APE tokens totaling $488,600 USD to cover the ApeCoin DAO’s six-month governance and operational needs.\n\nBudget spreadsheet [download.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_4vvH1WIxFcGIjxNgLMw5f7d4zxon0SO/view?usp=sharing)\n\n\n\n\n![GWGHeader|690x228](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/0/0cf8fedf72ddd4e53adcc0307ce6d6f8ee44b54d_2_1318x1000.jpeg)\n\n\n*The Governance Working Group shall invoice the Foundation against this budget as needed but still reserves the right to take custody in full, as approved through this AIP.*\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-317-apecoin-dao-governance-and-operations-budget/17165\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-263: Merch Apes // Free Luxury ApeCoin Varsity Jackets",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\n&nbsp; This proposal aims to fuel the increasing demand for merchandise and tangible goods as a means of spreading cultural and brand recognition globally. We believe it is an opportune moment to introduce ApeCoin-branded luxury merchandise. Apparel and memorabilia are key avenues for personal expression, and it seems only fitting that ApeCoin should have its own merchandise to mirror our community's sentiments, ideas, and individual tastes! We envision these ApeCoin Cloud Varsity Jackets to be available to community members. This limited-edition line will not only boost ApeCoin’s visibility but also reinforce our commitment to culture and community engagement.\n\n\n![ApeCoin Dao Back Varsity Jacket Collar|690x462](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/5/5b834ff1117f7d969f3741a552ad485353911dbc_2_1380x924.jpeg)\n\nPlease note that the product design is a mockup and may be subject to change.\n\nHere are some sample images showcasing the work that the manufacturer has done in the past:\n\n**Exhibit 1**\n![Kith Photo Varsity Jacket - 1|453x500](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/0/020a483582f698ae591a44e41be497456cead8c0_2_906x1000.jpeg)\n\n**Exhibit 2**\n![Kith Photo Varsity Jacket - 2|357x500](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/8/8d4a41ecb56be9cd5523f4c3b71232084ab38255_2_714x1000.jpeg)\nPlease be advised that all the images in question are the property of Kith NYC\n\nhttps://twitter.com/theZoopie/status/1600949562235125761\n![image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/0/05d292e4e8e54401091a25bb5592c4d4e58457ff_2_375x500.jpeg)\nPictured: Garment that I designed and featured during Art Basel Miami 2022.\n\n&nbsp;  Our aim is to assess the community’s interest in this preorder, with the potential to scale up production based on the response. These jackets will be offered to holders possessing a minimum of 250 ApeCoin, with ApeCoin being the sole accepted form of payment. ApeCoin community members will have the opportunity to collect this limited-edition piece for the equivalent of around $669 USD in $APE coin. Additionally, to commemorate this first-edition release, we will raffle off 5 varsity jackets to the community free of charge, to community members who hold at least 250 ApeCoin.\n\n&nbsp; This initiative marks the beginning of our efforts to expand the range of accessories and products available under ApeCoin DAO. We believe that the incorporation of our brand into everyday streetwear plays a vital role in fostering a sense of shared identity and pride within our community, thereby helping us grow and develop together.\n\n#### BENEFIT TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nWe’re incredibly excited about the impact that stylish merchandise can have on the ApeCoin DAO community! Envision it as more than just merchandise; think of it as a community builder, an icebreaker, and a conversation starter all rolled into one. Our goal is to achieve widespread adoption, and fashionable merch serves as a fantastic way for people to connect, learn, and feel part of an exclusive club.\n\nI experienced this firsthand when I wore my first sample of a trench coach jacket. People stopped me to ask where I got it, and many of them had never even heard of crypto or NFTs before. That’s the power of great design—it transcends boundaries and introduces our unique community to a broader audience.\n\nSo, to truly go mainstream, we need merchandise that turns heads, starts conversations, and gets everyone excited about ApeCoin!\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n0 Cost\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-263-merch-apes-free-luxury-apecoin-varsity-jackets/13020\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",

[Alganon Comic](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-52tTH4h-K7gl_mF8qOZuFb6vsvSpUq-/view?usp=sharing) (partnership with DC Comics)\n\nAlganon is a completed game and so, it will retain all its pre-existing gameplay elements. It will however have specific Web3 elements integrated such as an Ethereum based blockchain backend, integrated Web3 wallet, tokenomics, and an NFT marketplace.\n\n![Zanyana-Wallpaper|690x431](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/f/f1f82b9a3f54dc25b3d110ce3f72ec1ff2974639_2_1380x862.jpeg)\n\n#### BENEFIT TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nThere are many benefits to the ApeCoin DAO.\n\n1. **$APE TOKEN USE:** For a period of 12 MONTHS from the date of initial implementation (Alpha, Beta, Release Candidate, Final) in the game, we will EXCLUSIVELY use the $APE token as the game's official cryptocurrency. \n\n2. **GAMING:** ApeCoin immediately gets its own full blown MMORPG game in a massively popular game genre, and which can be rebranded and reskinned as-needed. This will attract thousands of gamers beyond the current 130K count of the pre-existing token holders.\n \n   Web2 gamers who are already familiar with the game, will no doubt return to it, and we have taken steps to ensure that on-boarding them to Web3 is a seamless experience which goes from in-game wallet creation to buying $APE. We’ve got it all covered.\n\n   We can of course also allow fiat, but there’s no point in doing that with the ApeCoin licensed version of the game.\n\n3. **COMMUNITY:** The ApeCoin community, though relatively small in comparison to other gaming communities, has the potential to greatly expand its user base via this game.\n\n   No more trolling the Discord server or endless scrolling on Discourse. You can fire up the game and go trade, explore, and adventure with your friends. Or just hang around at sunset and chat using text or voice comms. The game server runs 24-7 (except when it resets); so even if you get bored harassing the thousands of game NPCs or doing quests, you can always be assured that there’s a live person to chat or play with at any time of day.\n\n4. **CLOUT:** Compared to pre-existing and upcoming Web3 games - nothing - compares to Alganon. The ApeCoin DAO being the first to co-fund the release of a core Web2 game bridged over to Web3 creates the kind of marketing, clout and credibility that marketing can never buy. The game is here. It works. It’s been tried and tested for many years. And it’s a fun gaming experience as per the many online reviews of the legacy game. I believe that this will set the bar - even the impetus - for others with similar Web2 properties to consider a similar collaboration with ApeCoin DAO. This isn’t some empty Metaverse “game” experience nor a promise of what is to come. The game is here. It’s playable. It’s extensible. And it’s coming to the ApeCoin DAO.\n\n5. **MARKETING:** Where applicable in our marketing and PR efforts for the game, we will mention that the game uses the $APE token, and that the Web3 release was co-funded through a grant from the ApeCoin DAO. We will also use the official ApeCoin logo as-needed in various marketing efforts as well as in the game.\n\n![image|690x388](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/6/6a971740c5d521d79c05dd534a3d16f028cb1488.jpeg)\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nTotal Ecosystem Grant: $500K - to be paid in $APE\n\nBreakdown:\n\n* $300K (1 year, renewable*) \n* $200K (one-time)\n\n*Renewable *upon request* at the sole discretion of the Ape Foundation or the Metaverse Working Group; and at the same $300K cost, *within 90 days* of current term expiration.

      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\n![image1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/5/52cdea4b4cca49c6d5a5fe1e6d3129f5008f5070.png)\n\nFrench: [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jj4qTvpFpbbJvI1kIVrNYuSZmq90ohuu/view?usp=sharing)\nSpanish: [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G0WGClWTWlidjr9YecaoAicJbcHtuq-K/view?usp=sharing)\nJapanese: [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m3s03gsdwAP3zMGmA-WpOeSi-PTcYHzl/view?usp=sharing)\nSimplified Chinese: [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D8e_35VWfasKjWmAnX3fNZMPGzv8nokx/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThe primary objective of this budget proposal is to outline a strategic plan for the Governance Working Group (GWG) that ensures continued smooth operations of ApeCoin DAO and effective management of the AIP process. It initiates a more decentralized ApeCoin DAO through the GWG adopting a new non-profit DAO LLC structure, distinctly separate from the Foundation as a grouping of grant recipients and service providers.\n\nThe budget also includes provisions for conducting inclusive third-party sustainability and compliance studies tailored to the ApeCoin DAO and outlines plans to create a global community committee, bringing representatives together from delegations worldwide in a think-tank environment. Additionally, there are plans for a governance-centric community rewards program to incentivize actionable suggestions for operations process improvements.\n\nAn ApeCoin DAO voting and AIP analytics dashboard will be developed and a collaboration with Alex McCurry and Solidity.io will elevate the Apecoin.com website by providing language selection choices and enhancing the overall user experience to motivate visitors to delve deeper into the ApeCoin ecosystem. The GWG will closely coordinate with the recently approved Marketing & Communications Working Group to ensure that alignment with the ApeCoin brand identity is adhered to. \n\nThe proposal presents a comprehensive framework of Objectives and Key Result (OKR) measurements designed to ensure accountability, inform the community about initiative progress, and hold Governance Working Group personnel accountable for their roles.\n\nThe Governance Working Group is a seven-person team comprised by Amplify, ALL CITY, Tiger, Lost, 12GAUGE, CryptoLogically and Vulkan.\n\n\n![Untitled design-8|690x314](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/f/f2a9bd9818228d75b9303320a670aed99186777a_2_1380x628.jpeg)\n\n\n\n![091423timeline|690x425](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/e/e6217a7389f2770108f5f4727b4bec1b4795fca3_2_1380x850.jpeg)\n\n#### BENEFIT TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nThis proposal is aimed at enhancing the ApeCoin ecosystem in multiple ways. First, it seeks to uphold our commitment to providing seamless day-to-day DAO operations and an efficient AIP process. It introduces critical research and development ventures focused on broader economic sustainability and compliance for the ApeCoin DAO. Moreover, it places significant emphasis on community empowerment through various committee programs, thereby giving community members a more impactful role in the ApeCoin DAOs decision-making processes.\n\nTo recap, the proposal's core benefits encompass continued operational efficiency, sustainable legal frameworks, fiscal responsibility towards DAO spending, innovative R&D initiatives, and enhanced community involvement.\n\n1. **Ongoing Operations of the ApeCoin DAO:** Continue to effectively manage the day-to-day operations of the ApeCoin DAO including AIP processing, facilitating Discourse and Discord, overseeing elections, drafting and implementing budgets, coordinating community committees, and implementing process improvements.\n\n2. **Sustainability and Compliance Strategies:** Contract research firms to gain actionable insights and assess on-chain structures to better understand economically sustainable options for the broader ApeCoin DAO, prioritizing a non-custodial environment.\n\n3. **Increased Adoption of APE:** We anticipate that our sustainability study and enhanced governance will stimulate both adoption and value within the ecosystem. This will offer an essential strategy for the APE token, enabling its widespread utilization across DeFi and web3 platforms. \n\n4. **Enhanced Transparency:** Provide detailed quarterly reports on expenditures, offering comprehensive insights into the DAO's spending patterns for the community, while identifying potential areas for optimization.\n\n5. **Building the Working Group Blueprint:** As the first Working Group to be established and newly assembled, we will take no chances in building a safe, compliant organizational structure with the right professional service providers and advisors mentoring our every step. Our goal is simple: to become the gold standard of all Working Groups and build out the framework for others to follow.\n\n6. **Website and Dashboard Development:** Elevate the user experience on Apecoin.com by creating a captivating interface that welcomes users, enables language selection and motivates visitors to explore and discover more about ApeCoin and the ApeCoin DAO. Our governance dashboard will display real-time analytics on key voting and AIP metrics as well as the ApeCoin DAO treasury.\n\n7. **Community Empowerment:** Increase decentralized decision-making within the ApeCoin DAO and empower members to drive impactful change through committees and other initiatives aimed at providing a larger voice to constituents.\n\n![2|690x160](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/4/494c0e970e84480d1bedfd3cd966be5f1a40763c_2_1380x320.png)\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nThis budget proposal requests the allocation of APE tokens totaling $488,600 USD to cover the ApeCoin DAO’s six-month governance and operational needs.\n\nBudget spreadsheet [download.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_4vvH1WIxFcGIjxNgLMw5f7d4zxon0SO/view?usp=sharing)\n\n\n\n\n![GWGHeader|690x228](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/0/0cf8fedf72ddd4e53adcc0307ce6d6f8ee44b54d_2_1318x1000.jpeg)\n\n\n*The Governance Working Group shall invoice the Foundation against this budget as needed but still reserves the right to take custody in full, as approved through this AIP.*\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-317-apecoin-dao-governance-and-operations-budget/17165\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

It initiates a more decentralized ApeCoin DAO through the GWG adopting a new non-profit DAO LLC structure, distinctly separate from the Foundation as a grouping of grant recipients and service providers.\n\nThe budget also includes provisions for conducting inclusive third-party sustainability and compliance studies tailored to the ApeCoin DAO and outlines plans to create a global community committee, bringing representatives together from delegations worldwide in a think-tank environment. Additionally, there are plans for a governance-centric community rewards program to incentivize actionable suggestions for operations process improvements.\n\nAn ApeCoin DAO voting and AIP analytics dashboard will be developed and a collaboration with Alex McCurry and Solidity.io will elevate the Apecoin.com website by providing language selection choices and enhancing the overall user experience to motivate visitors to delve deeper into the ApeCoin ecosystem. The GWG will closely coordinate with the recently approved Marketing & Communications Working Group to ensure that alignment with the ApeCoin brand identity is adhered to. \n\nThe proposal presents a comprehensive framework of Objectives and Key Result (OKR) measurements designed to ensure accountability, inform the community about initiative progress, and hold Governance Working Group personnel accountable for their roles.\n\nThe Governance Working Group is a seven-person team comprised by Amplify, ALL CITY, Tiger, Lost, 12Guage, CryptoLogically and Vulkan.\n\n\n![Untitled design-8|690x314](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/f/f2a9bd9818228d75b9303320a670aed99186777a_2_1380x628.jpeg)\n\n\n\n![091423timeline|690x425](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/e/e6217a7389f2770108f5f4727b4bec1b4795fca3_2_1380x850.jpeg)\n\n#### BENEFIT TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nThis proposal is aimed at enhancing the ApeCoin ecosystem in multiple ways. First, it seeks to uphold our commitment to providing seamless day-to-day DAO operations and an efficient AIP process. It introduces critical research and development ventures focused on broader economic sustainability and compliance for the ApeCoin DAO. Moreover, it places significant emphasis on community empowerment through various committee programs, thereby giving community members a more impactful role in the ApeCoin DAOs decision-making processes.\n\nTo recap, the proposal's core benefits encompass continued operational efficiency, sustainable legal frameworks, fiscal responsibility towards DAO spending, innovative R&D initiatives, and enhanced community involvement.\n\n1. **Ongoing Operations of the ApeCoin DAO:** Continue to effectively manage the day-to-day operations of the ApeCoin DAO including AIP processing, facilitating Discourse and Discord, overseeing elections, drafting and implementing budgets, coordinating community committees, and implementing process improvements.\n\n2. **Sustainability and Compliance Strategies:** Contract research firms to gain actionable insights and assess on-chain structures to better understand economically sustainable options for the broader ApeCoin DAO, prioritizing a non-custodial environment.\n\n3. **Increased Adoption of APE:** We anticipate that our sustainability study and enhanced governance will stimulate both adoption and value within the ecosystem. This will offer an essential strategy for the APE token, enabling its widespread utilization across DeFi and web3 platforms. \n\n4. **Enhanced Transparency:** Provide detailed quarterly reports on expenditures, offering comprehensive insights into the DAO's spending patterns for the community, while identifying potential areas for optimization.\n\n5. **Building the Working Group Blueprint:** As the first Working Group to be established and newly assembled, we will take no chances in building a safe, compliant organizational structure with the right professional service providers and advisors mentoring our every step. Our goal is simple: to become the gold standard of all Working Groups and build out the framework for others to follow.\n\n6. **Website and Dashboard Development:** Elevate the user experience on Apecoin.com by creating a captivating interface that welcomes users, enables language selection and motivates visitors to explore and discover more about ApeCoin and the ApeCoin DAO. Our governance dashboard will display real-time analytics on key voting and AIP metrics as well as the ApeCoin DAO treasury.\n\n7. **Community Empowerment:** Increase decentralized decision-making within the ApeCoin DAO and empower members to drive impactful change through committees and other initiatives aimed at providing a larger voice to constituents.\n\n![2|690x160](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/4/494c0e970e84480d1bedfd3cd966be5f1a40763c_2_1380x320.png)\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nThis budget proposal requests the allocation of APE tokens totaling $488,600 USD to cover the ApeCoin DAO’s six-month governance and operational needs.\n\nBudget spreadsheet [download.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_4vvH1WIxFcGIjxNgLMw5f7d4zxon0SO/view?usp=sharing)\n\n\n\n\n![GWGHeader|690x228](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/0/0cf8fedf72ddd4e53adcc0307ce6d6f8ee44b54d_2_1318x1000.jpeg)\n\n\n*The Governance Working Group shall invoice the Foundation against this budget as needed but still reserves the right to take custody in full, as approved through this AIP.*\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-317-apecoin-dao-governance-and-operations-budget/17165\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-297: An NFT Community Vault Operating as an ApeCoin Sister DAO with a Goal to Advance the Mission and Influence of ApeCoin",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to position ApeCoin as the web3 culture token to power the broader web3 ecosystem. This proposal aims to secure 750,000 APE to acquire NFTs which represent various cultures and also with a certain level of influence in web3. The acquired NFTs will be managed via a community-governed vault, voted by the sister DAO members, and open for $APE holders to utilize the IP with potential grants in $APE in the near future. The initial deployment of $APE for NFT acquisition will be operated and decided by the Committee.\n\n#### BENEFIT TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nEvery step of our proposed approach will prioritize the usage and adoption of $APE\n\nOur 5-step approach to execute this proposal are as follows:\n\n1. Purchase the selected NFTs using the grant in $APE\n2. ApeCoin holders owning the governance rights of the usage or moblization of the acquired NFTs (voting through a sister DAO)\n3. (Sister DAO Process) ApeCoin DAO will lease these NFT IPs to $APE holders / proposers\n4. (ApeCoin DAO or Sister DAO Process) Use $APE to fund the development of these IP utilizations\n5. (ApeCoin DAO or Sister DAO Process) Adopt $APE in these products\n\n$APE will be the token that powers the operations and execution of every stage, all the way from initial NFT acquisition to the development of products leveraging these NFT IPs. This will create vital benefits for the ApeCoin ecosystem because it will lead to wider adoption and usage of $APE beyond its current applications.\n\nSister DAO to be governed by $APE holders with the following decision making:\n\n* Whether specific NFT IPs should be rented to a specific proposer based on the suggested products or projects\n* $APE funding for development of the suggested products or projects using the vault's NFT IPs\n* Which NFT collections to buy / sell from in the vault’s future NFT acquisitions after the initial acquisition based on this proposal\n\nThis sister DAO would operate outside of the main ApeCoin DAO, but still consist of the same membership base with the only requirement being to own 1 $APE.\n\nSupercharge IP utilization within and beyond the APE ecosystem\n\n* This community-run vault will acquire, hold, and empower utilizing a number of NFTs from notable NFT collections across the web3 landscape. Benefits:\n  + The first application of the acquired NFT IP to create products / services will set the first example of receiving $APE support to power the broader web3 ecosystem and other projects\n  + The NFTs acquired via the vault can be used by the ApeCoin community without having to deploy capital and own the NFTs themselves, however able to utilize the IP to the holders’ preference of projects\n  + Open cross-community dialogue and supercharge the educational process of ApeCoin DAO involvement\n\nOne of the many benefits of this vault’s sister DAO is its low-barrier entry of owning at least 1 APE to have governance and usage rights in this vault.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nWe propose allocating an initial budget of 750,000 ApeCoin from the DAO treasury for acquiring NFTs. The budget will be utilized as such:\n\n1. 500,000 $APE: To purchase NFTs from various platforms and projects that align with the vision and values of ApeCoin, encompassing art, music, virtual worlds, gaming, and other web3 domains\n2. 250,000 $APE: As a buffer for additional NFT purchases that may be needed and development of any related services to assist in initial vault maintenance\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-297-an-nft-community-vault-operating-as-an-apecoin-sister-dao-with-a-goal-to-advance-the-mission-and-influence-of-apecoin/16167\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

After a fun and successful event, I was very grateful to receive 2 ApeCoin awards from our wonderful judges, Maaria and Lost.\n\nI was given 1 ApeCoin by Maaria, and invited to join the ApeCoin DAO and submit an AIP. A vibrant community welcomed me at the DAO. A community of artists, creators, builders, gamers and web3 frens from all walks of life.\n\nI’ve been afforded many great opportunities to grow and thrive within the DAO, all with the help of the wonderful ApeCoin community, thank you!\n\nAIP 243: The Ape Inn - EthGlobal Project is an ApeCoin Grant Proposal which aims to bring the concept to life and continue to grow the project with the help of the ApeCoin DAO and community.\n\n#### BENEFIT TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nThe Ape Inn will be Powered by ApeCoin and aims to create new uses cases for the $APE token. A monthly subscription fee will be offered in ApeCoin for premium content and features, with more coming in phase two of the project.\n\nThe project will generate revenue from fees on NFT trades made through the platform. The current NFT API allows us to show certain price data in the token of choice.\n\nWe will showcase ApeCoin throughout the platform with options to switch between ETH, WETH and ApeCoin.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nThe ApeCoin Grant will assist in bringing The Ape Inn concept to life and launch us into the next phase. The grant funding of $50 000.00, paid in ApeCoin or APE token please, will be utilised for the startup costs including hosting, Reservoir API fees, marketing, design and development and any other costs associated with The Ape Inn concept.\n\n**Design & Marketing $5 000.00 (Once off Costs)**\n**Running Expenses $5 000.00 (12 months)**\n**Development Costs $40 000.00 (10 months)**\n\nGrant Total $50 000.00\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-243-the-ape-inn-ethglobal-project/11756\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP.

Our vision is to allow users to borrow anything against everything. ParaSpace has many advantages, including auto-compounding, auto-repay to save gas, and maximizing staking rewards. We also offer a variety of pool choices, such as p2pool and p2peer. We provide BNPL services, allowing users to buy blue-chip NFTs and enjoy benefits with 0% down payment and immediate profit generation for Staking.

In addition to providing information on the current price, daily, monthly, and annual percentage changes, trading volume, market capitalization, and changes from the all-time high price, the bot is also capable of generating comparative charts between ApeCoin and Ethereum over a seven-day period.\n\n\n####  BENEFITS TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM:\n\nA bot on Discord that displays the prices of APE coin, and creates comparative charts with other currencies can bring various benefits to Ape coin community. Here are some of the potential benefits:\n* Immediate access to information: With a bot, we won’t need to leave Discord or open another tab to check APE coin price. You’ll have access to this information directly on Discord, which makes real-time price monitoring more convenient.\n* Useful visual comparisons: Comparison charts can help visualize APE coin performance with Ethereum more effectively than just numbers. This can help in making investment decisions.\n* Updated and reliable information: In a volatile market like cryptocurrency, having the most recent information can be crucial for investment decision-making. With a bot, we can be sure that you are getting the Updated and reliable (because the data comes from the API provided by coingecko) information possible.\n* Efficiency: Having all this information in one place, and easily accessible, can significantly increase the efficiency of your trading or investment analysis.\n* Community: The bot can be a valuable resource for your community, offering additional value to your members and encouraging more interaction.\n\n####  OVERALL COST\n\nthis bot has no costs because it is hosted on a free version of the squarecloud server, it is enough to meet your needs\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-306-apecoin-price-tracking-bot/16632\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nIn production since May 2021, BORED AS F*CK is a feature length documentary directed by Francis Bored Apela (BAYC #9081) that tells the comprehensive story of the Bored Ape Yacht Club and the ever evolving world of web3. We’re industry veterans who aped into BAYC a few weeks after mint to tell its story using the very IP that granted us membership into the club. A movie about NFTs directed by an NFT. Today we’re seeking a community grant from the ApeCoin DAO to support the film in our final stages of production / post-production.\n\n####  BENEFITS TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM:\n\nThe biggest benefit to the $APE ecosystem is to provide awareness and education through an easily accessible, fun and entertaining documentary that is designed for a broad audience - not just the ones who already know and live in the space. This will be a documentary that can be enjoyed by web3 maxis and non-crypto people alike.\n\nAdditionally, we plan to offer additional content, host events, and create merchandise and other collectibles associated with the film that can be purchased/minted with $APE. We will have a ton of additional footage that will be left on the cutting room floor, and we plan to make this available in the form of extended interviews, deleted scenes, and behind the scenes content that can either be purchased directly with $APE or live behind a token gate that can be accessed by anyone that has at least one $APE in their wallet.\n\nOur hope is that a large number of non-crypto people will see the movie on traditional platforms and will be motivated to seek out more information and explore the ecosystem that we showcase in the film.\n\n####  OVERALL COST\n\n$400,000 USD paid in $APE\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-303-bored-ape-yacht-club-documentary/15696\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-292: Inclusive Governance: Delegate Community Program ",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nThis proposal seeks approval to establish a process and framework to build out a “Delegate Community Program\" for the purpose of fostering inclusivity, further decentralization of cultural governance, and encouraging collaboration with ApeCoin from diverse web3 communities.\n\nA ‘Delegate Community’ in essence acts as a sub-DAO and utilizes voting rights delegated to it by the ApeCoin DAO. Per any other delegate voting entity, the $ape tokens remain in the custody of the owner - in this case the ApeCoin DAO\n\n‘Delegate Communities’ will establish Snapshot Organisations which will deploy ERC-721 strategies, enabling their respective communities to vote on proposals using their own NFTs. In turn, the result of their internal vote will dictate the direction of their delegated ApeCoin vote. This mirrors the Mocaveerse model.\n\nTo incentivise participation, ‘Delegate Communities’ will receive a share of TBD $ape grant on a TBD frequency for participating in a TBD percentage of AIPs.\n\nMuch like recent Working Group AIPs, this proposal is not requesting approval for the final program implementation. Rather, this proposal is introducing voters to the concept of delegating power to and incentivising communities across web3 to engage with ApeCoin and its governance.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, there is NO COST FOR THIS INITIAL PROPOSAL.\n\nIf successfully passed, however, there will be a follow-up proposal to outline and agree the process for:\n* Implementation\n    * Period Covered: Fixed, Rolling etc\n* Vote Delegation\n    * How many votes to ring fence and delegate\n* Delegate Community Selection\n    * How many\n    * Qualifying Criteria\n* Rewards/Incentives\n    * Amount of $ape for the rewards\n    * Frequency of rewards\n    * Qualification/KPIs\n* Administrative Oversight\n    * People - who is managing this stream\n    * How are they incentivised\n    * How is success (theirs and the proposal) measured\n    * Detailed overview of the deployable process including systems, transparency and community engagement\n\nI intend to work with the Ape Assembly to propose the above items and any other considerations that will be needed to implement the final process.\n\n####  BENEFITS TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM:\n\nBy creating delegate communities, the DAO benefits from distribution via new, currently disengaged communities. New, diverse perspectives from these communities will increase and improve AIP creation potentially leading to better governance and growth of the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\n####  OVERALL COST\n\nThe overall cost for this proposal is zero.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-292-inclusive-governance-delegate-community-program/16199\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP.

Open to all who wish to participate, from users to project contributors, the group has already successfully completed its initial version. Now, it is time to elevate the program by introducing policies, procedures, and structure. To achieve this, this proposal suggests creating a custom “Beta Tester” badge on the Forum, symbolizing legitimacy and fostering a sense of belonging and accomplishment for its members.\n\nFuture plans encompass expanding the program’s scope, reaching beyond the DAO, and providing user feedback to external projects. Additionally, the group aims to act as a bridge between communities, encouraging interaction and coordination, resulting in enhanced opportunities for collaboration.\n\n#### BENEFIT TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nThe custom “Beta Tester” badge will kindle a profound sense of camaraderie and pride among the participants, fostering greater engagement within the group. Additionally, this initiative marks the beginning of outreach efforts to external communities, facilitating collaboration and cooperation with the DAO community, in harmony with the Persistence value, understanding that success is an ouroboros, not a straight line.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n$0 (It will be realized through existing resources and the collective efforts of the community).\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-300-create-custom-beta-tester-forum-badge/16664\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nI would like the ApeCoin DAO to give away (for free) ApeCoin DAO merch to Ape Fest participants meeting some criteria. This is aimed to increase the awareness about, and participation in, the DAO among the wider Yuga ecosystem.\n\n#### BENEFIT TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\n* Increase participation meaningfully among the most enthusiastic audience (ApeFest attendance is a good proxy for enthusiasm for the ecosystem and “meaningful participation” can be ascertained by linking our giveaway to apply only to Trust Level 2 holders).\n\n* Word of mouth - Imagine this conversation repeated 100+ times at ApeFest. “That’s a great tshirt/ cap, where did you get it?” “I got it from the ApeCoin DAO because I’m active in the ApeCoin discord.” “Wow, I didn’t even know something like it existed.”\n\n* Minimal cost: We can have a control over quality and costs. We could get something basic (but good quality) for $80 per person (cap + hoodie + t-shirt). Limiting to 100 merch bundles, the total cost would be ~$8k.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nA maximum cost of **$8,300**\n\nI understand that the ApeCoin discord server is not a Foundation asset and that dependence on it would require approval by the ApeCoin DAO Discord moderation team.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-299-apecoin-merch-for-the-apefest/16791\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",

      "title": "AIP-293: APE awards for round 2 runner ups in the elections",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nAIP Idea: The idea is simple. Getting to round two of the elections takes a lot of work from the candidates. Less well off candidates may not put their name forward as they can’t take the time off from their current work or not have earnings for this period. A one time award to the three runner up finalists in each category can make this more equitable.\n**N.B. the AIP is to run for a total of two election cycles.**\n\n#### BENEFIT TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nIt benefits the ApeCoin Ecosystem by encouraging participation in the election process with a range of candidates, as the process is very time consuming. The award level is set that it is enough to be thankful to receive but not so much that it is worth applying for roles just for the reward. It only applies to those who are runners ups in round two as those runner up finalists had to put in significant investment of time and effort as the main competitors. Overall this AIP will make the process more equitable and encourage broader participation.\n\nIt is retroactive for those that participated in the July 1st 2023 election. It will also apply to the next election cycle. Therefore in total two cycles. Please note the idea was added before the end of the last election cycle. Also after the two cycles it will require a new AIP to continue this Election Reward Program.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nSpecial Council Runner Ups\n*2,000 x 3 = 6,000 ApeCoin\n\nStewards Runner Ups\n*2,000 x 3 = 6,000 ApeCoin\n\nOne Election Cycle cost = 12,000 ApeCoin\n*Total Cost = 24,000 ApeCoin*\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-293-ape-awards-for-round-2-runner-ups-in-the-elections/15201\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-285: Ape Insights - More Than Just Another Newsletter Proposal",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nThis proposal outlines the creation of a comprehensive and user-friendly newsletter for the ApeCoin DAO community. The newsletter aims to offer concise summaries of new proposals, initiating informed discussions and enabling every member to contribute actively to the platform’s evolution. This isn’t just about sharing information - it’s about inspiring understanding and fostering a more unified and democratically engaged DAO community.\n\n#### BENEFIT TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nInvesting in this initiative equates to investing in a passionate builder from within our community, committed to over-delivering on the promise of fostering a more informed, engaged, and vibrant ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\nBut What unique value will the Proposal Summaries Newsletter bring to the ApeCoin ecosystem as a whole?\n\n1. **Increased Accessibility and Understanding:** The newsletter aims to translate complex AIPs into simple, digestible language, breaking down technical barriers and easing time constraints that often limit wider participation. Every member, regardless of their technical acumen or time commitments, deserves to understand, discuss, and vote on proposals that shape our DAO.\n\n2. **Enhanced Community Engagement:** A regular, concise, and easy-to-understand newsletter, delivered directly to ApeCoin members, facilitates ongoing engagement with the DAO's activities. This increased engagement strengthens the democratic process and cultivates a more connected and vibrant community.\n\n3. **Promoting Informed Decision-making:** The ApeCoin DAO operates on democratic principles, and well-informed participants are crucial for a functioning democracy. By providing unbiased, neutral summaries of AIPs, we enable members to cast their votes based on understanding and facts, not speculation.\n\n4. **Community Building:** A consistent, reliable line of communication nurtures stronger ties within our DAO community. This sense of unity and belonging encourages more members to actively participate and contribute to our collective goals.\n\n5. **Supporting AIP Authors:** AIP authors also benefit from this initiative. Our summaries make their ideas accessible to a wider audience in an easily comprehensible format, leading to broader discussions, constructive feedback, and ultimately, more robust AIPs.\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nTo materialize this initiative, a robust financial plan has been carved out. Encompassing the various phases of the project, the financial blueprint divides the costs into initial setup and weekly operations.\n\nThe project kicks off with an initial investment of 1,200 $APE. This infusion is primarily directed towards a diverse set of tasks that lay the groundwork for the initiative. From setting up the Beehiiv platform, website designing, and development to kick-starting the first round of in-depth research, content creation, and formatting, this phase also involves initial promotion and distribution of the newsletter. Moreover, the cost also takes into account the graphic design aspect, making the content visually appealing and easier to digest.\n\nFollowing the setup phase, the project enters the operational stage. Here, the weekly recurring cost is 1,050 $APE, accounting for tasks including continued research, content writing, designing, editing, and distributing the newsletters.\n\nThe cost that will be received within the year (52 weeks) of weekly recurring payments\n55,800 $APE as a total amount.\n\nWe aim to build an independent website besides the Beehiiv platform. This would provide a unique, user-friendly experience, fostering a deeper connection between the ApeCoin DAO community and the newsletter.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-285-ape-insights-more-than-just-another-newsletter-proposal/14201\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",

      "title": "AIP-252: Funding Grant Proposals using Delegated Domain Allocation",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\n* We propose ApeCoin DAO fund a *wide variety* of teams aligned with ApeCoin’s roadmap with a budget of $1M spread across 2 quarters using Delegated Domain Capital Allocation Model. Questbook is leading [Compound](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136) grants program through [Delegated Domain Capital Allocation Model](https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/), a community-run grants program\n* We additionally propose that this budget be managed by **4** **individuals called Domain Allocators - chosen from the community and by the community**. These domain allocators would manage grants for a *domain*. These domains are strategic areas of focus for which ApeCoin DAO wants to disburse grants\n* The performance of each of these *domain allocators* will be publicly viewable and auditable using rich dashboards. At the end of the quarter, the ApeCoin community can vote to replace, continue domain allocators or increase budgets for each *domain allocator.*\n* We ([Questbook.xyz](https://questbook.xyz/)) **will help facilitate setting up these *domain allocators* and provide the tooling to run the program in an efficient and transparent way**. We have previously set up or currently setting up the grants process for Compound, Polygon, Solana, Celo, Aave, Perpetual, and IoTeX\n\n#### BENEFITS TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\n1. **Aligned allocation of funds:** By leveraging the Delegated Domain Allocator (DDA) model, the ApeCoin DAO can ensure that funds are allocated to projects that align with the domain (key areas selected by the ApeCoin DAO community), promoting efficient and effective use of resources. This approach aligns with ApeCoin DAO’s goal of enabling the distribution of $APE to empower the community to build and participate in the future of the Greater Metaverse.\n2. **Increased transparency:** The Delegated Domain Allocator approach provides a clear and transparent process for allocating funds, ensuring stakeholders understand the decision-making process and building community confidence. Questbook, a decentralized grant management platform, provides a transparent space for teams to showcase their backgrounds and experience. In addition, Questbook’s reporting features will allow the ApeCoin DAO to quickly generate monthly reports on the allocation of funds, with the details for each grant proposal.\n3. **Increased accountability:** With a dedicated group of stakeholders responsible for allocating funds, the Delegated Domain Allocator approach promotes increased accountability, ensuring that the funds are used effectively and efficiently. Domain allocators can be replaced through a community vote if their performance is not up to the standards accepted by the community.\n4. **Pseudonymity / Anonymity:** Builders can use Questbook and apply for funding without doxxing themselves. Questbook provides a transparent space for teams to showcase their backgrounds and experience, fulfilling the proposal’s requirement for team member descriptions.\n5. **Turnaround Time (TAT):** The Delegated Domain Allocator model will help significantly improve proposals’ turnaround time and overall outcomes for the ecosystem. **An example of this is Compound who’s already leveraging the DDA model and has a communication TAT of less than 48 hours**\n6. **Increase in the number of high quality proposals :** While we recognize that the ApeCoin DAO has dedicated its entire treasury to support proposals that advance its mission, we are **concerned about the underutilisation of reserved funds and the dearth of high-quality proposals**. Comparatively, [Aave receives more than 50 proposals per month](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-aave-grants-dao-renewal/11289#:~:text=increasing%20number%20of%20grants), and Nouns receives over 100 proposals per month across different funding formats. Without investing in resourcing and scaling high quality proposals, we believe that the ApeCoin DAO risks falling behind and losing its competitive edge. Delegated Domain Capital Allocation Model and Questbook’s organic builder traffic of 20,000+ builders/month will enable the ApeCoin DAO to source and fund significantly greater number of high quality proposals in a transparent manner.\n\nMore specifically, the Delegated Domain Capital Allocation model aims to address the following challenges:\n\n1. **Addressing Blind Spots:** It is unrealistic to assume that every community member or one individual possesses expertise across all domains. Evaluating projects outside of one’s area of expertise can be challenging and inefficient, potentially resulting in missed opportunities for valuable contributions to the ApeCoin ecosystem. By delegating capital and decision-making to people who are experts and who are closely involved in that domain, ApeCoin DAO will be able to find and fund projects that align with the mission of the ApeCoin DAO, while also **addressing any blind spots.**\n2. **Addressing Voter Fatigue:** We believe that not every grant proposal needs to go through an AIP process for receiving grant funding. Requiring every proposal to be voted on by the entire community can result in voter fatigue and low participation. By funding proposals through delegated domain capital allocation model, domain allocators can set maximum thresholds for accepting proposals within their respective domains. Proposals that fall below the threshold can be approved directly by domain allocators, reducing the burden on the community while reserving the AIP process for proposals that exceed the threshold and require broader community input.\n3. **Addressing Inadequate Review Process and Tooling** : Lack of evaluation rubrics and domain-specific evaluation criteria can result in an inconsistent and subjective review process, potentially leading to suboptimal proposals getting funded. Each domain allocator in the delegated domain capital allocation model will be required to specify domain specific evaluation rubrics to ensure alignment with ApeCoin DAO’s roadmap and funding of high quality proposals. With Questbook, members of the community can easily access and view the scores assigned to a proposal by the domain allocator, based on their domain-specific rubric as mentioned below.\n\n![image1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/a/a0491bfc580e688c7de46fba5137f354995e298b.png)\n\n* **Multi - Sig Wallet** - The disbursement of the grant will take place on-chain through a multi-sig wallet for each domain controlled by the program manager & the domain allocator\n\n#### OVERALL COST\nApeCoin DAO will be required to set aside an overall budget of $1M to be disbursed by the elected domain allocators to fund a wide variety of teams aligned with ApeCoin’s roadmap across two quarters. The compensation for Domain Allocators and Program Managers has been factored into this overall proposed budget. Please find below its details:\n\n1. **Program Manager** : $100/hour (est. $24K per quarter at 20 hours per week)\n2. **A Domain Allocator :** $80/hour (est. $14.4K per quarter at 15 hours/week per domain allocator)\n\nThe proposed compensation is based on the valuable feedback given by the ApeCoin community members, community poll and our ongoing engagement with Compound. It is competitive with some of the best-run grants program and community initiatives of ecosystems such as [Compound](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136), [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17358), [Nouns DAO](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1585710858038132737?s=20), [ApeCoin DAO Working Group](http://apecoin.staged-by-discourse.com/t/aip-239-working-group-guidelines-the-governance-working-group-charter/11462) and [Aave](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/145/). Based on our experience after working with multiple reputed ecosystems, a domain may receive more than 20 quality proposals per month. To effectively support and fund exceptional teams, domain allocators will need to invest significant time in activities such as marketing, project research, calls with proposers, preparing reviews, exchanging info/feedback with other DAs, tracking teams’ progress, and coordinating milestone based payouts. These activities **demand significant expertise and time commitment.** It is crucial for ApeCoin DAO to attract top talent for the role of domain allocator to ensure that exceptional projects are funded.\n\n3. **Questbook :** 3% of all disbursals made through Questbook as product fee\n\nOur approach of charging a percentage of the grants disbursed is designed to align our incentives with delivering value as against product usage. Funding a project signifies that the ecosystem has identified a project worth investing in, which further indicates that various steps in the funding process, such as attracting quality builders, establishing evaluation rubrics, and ensuring successful milestone-based payouts, have been executed effectively by the domain allocators. Our intention is to charge based on the successful completion of all these steps, rather than just product usage, to align our pricing with the value delivered through the entire grant disbursal cycle.\n\nThe domain allocators and program manager will be required to track their hours and provide weekly reports that will be accessible to the community. If the domain allocators have clocked fewer hours than estimated, the total spend will be lower than the proposed spend. If there are fewer grant requests or smaller grant amount requests for a particular domain, **the unused fund from every domain** will be returned back to the treasury after two quarters. For instance, [in the case of CGP 2.0](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136), not all domain allocators spent an equal amount of time reviewing and funding proposals for their respective domains. Some domain allocators spent comparatively less time than the budgeted 15hrs/week due to the time required to review proposals and the volume of proposals received within their domain.\n\nThe proposed budget represents the **maximum** amount needed to ensure the success of the program and **to avoid the need for frequent community ratification for budgets** for the proposed funding model. It does not guarantee that all the proposed expenses will be incurred. The unused fund from every domain **will be returned back to the treasury after two quarters**. Moreover, the proposed spend per quarter is expected to remain constant for the proposed budget/quarter and **is not expected to increase every quarter.**\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-252-funding-grant-proposals-using-delegated-domain-allocation/11862\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-283: Ape.AR: The AR Launchpad, Powered by ApeCoin",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT  ![image1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/a/a8ee2b87112a849d471f7484504745d73e2dc9c2_2_1380x776.jpeg)\n\nGraphic tees transform into motion graphic tees; street art unlocks interactive NFTs; trading cards become living highlight reels; album covers reveal hidden songs & lyrics; IRL events bring digital to the physical. All powered by ApeCoin.\n\n#### BENEFIT TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM:\n##### Community Benefit #1: Access to State-of-the-Art Technology, Tools & Resources for Creative Entrepreneurs\n- State-of-the-art AR technology is cost prohibitive for most independent artists & creatives. Since 2019, my company has been powering app-less AR experiences for brands, solving friction-laden user experience problems. Therefore, this proposal would fund the ability to empower accepted applicants with our already built zero-code, zero-download AR software used by brands from Paramount Pictures to Compass Real Estate.\n- Along with this technology, we provide the advisory resources for the Launchpad participants to follow best practices & achieve success with their physical-meets-digital releases.\n- This proposal then empowers creatives & furthers the entrepreneurial ecosystem that is Web3. Each project that emerges from the Ape.AR Launchpad\nwill produce an augmented product or experience, with a requisite to incorporate $APE as its exclusive currency.\n\n##### Community Benefit #2: Augmented Utility for Collectors\n- Through collecting NFTs, I quickly realized that AR technology can even further solve key problems endemic to the Web3 ecosystem. Specifically, it can be leveraged to bridge multiple divides: between physical and digital, between story and product, between online & IRL. In aggregate, this also solves the collector’s greatest concern by offering cohesive, comprehensive, continual utility.\n- Both a connection to and extension of the jpeg itself, our AR technology can take any still object, location, or image, regardless of where it appears, bringing it to life with motion and sound. 2D & 3D animations, video, audio, rich text, 360 portals. Once static artworks become dynamic & life-like with personality, stories & journeys.\n- Even further, all of the digital layers can be updated anytime, over time, real-time. This presents the potential for utility, or continuous value, in perpetuity. Augmented, unfolding stories. These stories can be strictly narrative, practical like early access to NFT drops, or a combination. Content drops layered onto physical product drops.\n\n##### Community Benefit #3: Onboarding New Web3 Participants\n- An indirect consequence of bridging the physical & digital divide with AR may eventually become its most important Web3 legacy: bridging the world of NFT early adopters & the rest of the world.\n- Products like motion graphic tees & experiences like interactive murals expose new audiences to the digital art we experience daily in Web3. But instead of leading with the technicalities of NFTs & blockchain, we lead with the visual stories - what the tokens represent - as digital layers to our physical realities. Newcomers get immersed in the intrinsic value of art before the financial value of art. Actual appreciation before financial appreciation. True, authentic, sustainable onboarding.\n- Then, given our layered approach to AR, newcomers can be presented with options to collect the motion art at the point of experience via available frictionless NFT solutions.\n- This expansive & inclusive worldview results in expanding the Web3 ecosystem to include new, interested & eventually active participants.\n\n##### Community Benefit #4: ApeCoin Commerce\n- $APE will be the exclusive payment method for all of the Ape.AR Launchpad collections. All of the resulting products will also include a “Powered by ApeCoin” logo.\n- Through this physical-meets-digital new use case, Ape.AR will generate new demand for $APE. This benefits the entire community, serving the vision of ApeCoin as the currency of choice for creative capital in Web3. A flywheel effect takes place when Ape.AR Launchpad projects successfully go to market & generate even greater interest for ApeCoin DAO.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n$300,000 USD, payable in $APE \n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-283-ape-ar-the-ar-launchpad-powered-by-apecoin/12704\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-289: Designing a Mascot for Apecoin ",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nThis proposal aims to create a unique, ape/monkey-inspired mascot for the Apecoin DAO. The mascot will add depth and personality to the brand, creating an emotional connection and sparking curiosity. My proposal highlights the benefits of having a mascot, including brand recognition, collaboration promotion, community building, adaptability, inspiration for artists, narrative elements, and improving the Discord environment.\n\n#### BENEFIT TO THE APECOIN ECOSYSTEM:\n- Brand Recognition: A well-designed mascot will make the brand easily identifiable and memorable.\n- Collaboration Promotion: The mascot will spark curiosity and encourage collaboration among community members, fostering a culture of engagement.\n- Unity and Community Building: It will bring life to the DAO, creating an exciting and inspiring culture.\n- Adaptability: The mascot’s design can be leveraged for various marketing materials, merchandise, and promotional activities.\n- Inspiration for Artists: The mascot will serve as a collaborative art subject, fostering creative contributions from artists within and outside the community. It can inspire others to also contribute to the development of the Apecoin brand.\n- Narrative Element: A mascot can act as a narrator in graphics, guiding the audience and conveying the DAO’s values and mission. (Example: As a narrating character in the guide for DAO newcomers by BojangleGuy) 1\n- Discord Enhancement: The mascot can be featured on DIscord in the form of emotes and stickers, supporting conversations and creating a fun and expressive environment on our Discord and others.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nAs the artist and initiator of this proposal, I kindly request a grant of $5,750 denominated in ApeCoin (breakdown see below) from the Apecoin DAO to support the mascot design project.\n The proposed budget will cover the following:\n- Research and initial development of alternative designs\n- Complete development process of the final mascot\n- Style guide development\n- ~15 Discord emojis/stickers\n- ~10 graphic assets for marketing purposes\n- 3D model (in collaboration)\n- Complete transfer of IP ownership to the Apecoin DAO \n\nCOST BREAKDOWN\nAverage hourly rate of $40\n* Brand and market research and evaluating community feedback to ensure that the mascot embodies the brand and DAO perfectly (7-8h) = $300\n* Sketches of variations and alternatives to choose from incl. process of gathering references and inspiration (8-10h) = $400\n* Final detailed mascot character sheet incl. front, back, and side view (8-10h) = $400\n* 15 discord Stickers ($40 each incl discount) = $600\n* Telegram sticker set ($10 per sticker) = $150\n* 10 illustrations to use for graphics, guides etc ($100 half body, $280 full body) = $1900\n* 3D model (in collaboration) = $500\n* Mascot guide (incl. character sheet, facial expressions and poses, color guide, material, details, accessories and variations, personality description) and usage guidelines (10-15h) = $600\n* Transfer of full IP ownership (incl. renunciation of profit share from merch etc. distributed by someone else) = $1500\n= ~$5750\n\nI kindly request $5,750 denominated in ApeCoin as my budget for this project.\nIf everything goes smoothly and faster than expected, I would add more illustration assets to the package.\n\nWith the support and help of the Apecoin community, I’m sure I can create the perfect mascot for the Apecoin DAO.\nThank you for your time!\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-289-designing-a-mascot-for-apecoin/15247\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nThe creation of Apeverse, a multi-language information hub, is aimed at streamlining the dissemination of information and promoting community engagement within the rapidly expanding Ape ecosystem. As the Ape community continues to grow, there is a growing need for a platform that offers readily accessible information on the latest developments, data, and activities within the ecosystem.\n\nBeyond serving as an information resource, Apeverse also functions as a platform where community members can interact and collaborate, thereby fostering a sense of unity and facilitating growth. It keeps track of dynamic changes relating to Apecoin and Ape-associated NFTs, and provides data analysis to illustrate the ecosystem’s progress, thereby enhancing transparency and accountability within the community.\n\nApeverse surpasses language barriers to become an essential hub for information delivery, given the rich array of information the Ape community encounters daily but lacks a singular space to consolidate it efficiently. Therefore, Apeverse is seen as a key resource for the community, facilitating greater inclusivity and communication efficiency within the diverse global Ape ecosystem.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n* UI/UX design * 1 people * 2 months = 6,000 * 1 * 2 = 12,000\n* Website front-end development * 3 people * 2 months = 4000 * 3 * 2 = 24,000\n* On-going development and maintenance of the website * 1 person * 10 months = 4,000 * 1 * 10 = 40,000\n* Smart contract development *1 people * 1 months = 8,000 * 1 * 1 = 8,000\n* Smart contract audit = 10,000\n* Website content operations * 1 person * 10 months = 3,000 * 1 * 10 = 30,000\n* Invited writers * 1 articles per month * 10 months = 500 * 1 * 10 = 5,000\n* Marketing campaigns * 1 every 2 months * 10 months = 1000 * 0.5 * 10 = 5,000\n* Others (domain name, server, etc.) = 3,000\n\nTotal: $135,000 for the first year.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-264-resubmission-of-aip-232-building-apeverse-a-multi-language-information-hub-for-the-ape-ecosystem/13210\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

We aim to reinforce and leverage ApeCoin and its ecosystem by creating new user experiences through the power of the game. Thus, this integration will provide an ecosystem where players can utilize APE tokens within the game, alongside the other benefits they know APE tokens for.\n\n![image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/6/68782b86612b9bf58e4e9ecb2533449321df23fb.png)\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nNO funds are needed from ApeCoin DAO. Meta Merge will be responsible for the cost of smart contract deployment, testing and auditing, and other fees and resources associated with AIP-xxx. We request support from the ApeCoin Community for implementing this integration and will be responsible for updating all progress.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-280-exploring-new-frontiers-bring-apecoin-ape-into-the-mobile-gaming-world/13556\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

This global event aims to introduce sharp university students to leading blockchain protocols, providing the space for a four-week deep dive into the Apecoin ecosystem.\n\nWe anticipate driving greater engagement with Apecoin and promoting its adoption across an ever-expanding community. Apecoin’s involvement would include interaction with hackers during two 60-minute technical workshops and setting up to three challenges with accompanying prizes!\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nWe kindly request Apecoin to sponsor our Gold-tier package, entailing a total commitment of $25,000. This sum is split between event organization, targeted marketing, hiring support, and other related costs ($12,500), and prizes to incentivise participants ($12,500).\n This carefully balanced investment in event logistics and participant motivation will help to ensure a successful, dynamic hackathon that champions innovation and brings the Apecoin community closer together.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-273-apecoin-to-co-sponsor-encode-s-upcoming-university-hackathon/12518\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

This charter details what an initial infrastructure could/should entail, provides foundational branding support & IP usage guidelines, and creates an environment for the majority of initiatives to spring forth from the community.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to help establish the ApeCoin DAO Marketing and Communications Working Group. The Marketing and Communications Working Group’s mandate is to:\n\n“Propose a consistent and compelling brand strategy and identity for the ApeCoin DAO, propose and implement comprehensive marketing and communications strategies, and help establish a strong presence through effective global communication efforts in order to onboard more users into the DAO.”\n\nWorking Groups enable a sustainable community-led infrastructure that further decentralizes the DAO, creates operational efficiency, and is flexible enough to adapt to any opportunities that may arise. The guidelines for how this Working Group will function are proposed in AIP-239.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n$0\n* This AIP serves as an initial framework to establish this Working Group. The three elected Stewards will propose a budget 1-3 weeks after being onboarded.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-246-working-group-charter-marketing-communications/11837\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-255: $Ape x Innovation: Expanding the $Ape Universe",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nIn September 2022, NFTxExplore, a Ladies of BAYC member, teamed up with a friend and designed a web3 hackathon in Moldova where entrepreneurs created innovative business ideas using blockchain technology. The event received over 500 applications for 100 spots.\n\nDuring the event, they introduced skills such as how to create a Smart contract, build community, and develop a DAO; NFTxExplore used the ApeDAO as an example and tapped into builders across web3 as mentors to lead virtual sessions. Teams pitched their business ideas, and the top three joined the HUG, a leading web3 incubator that supports early stage web3 businesses.\n\nCheck out these two videos about the event:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/yepmoldova/videos/1121038925455387\nAnd \n[Se formează prima comunitate Web3 din Moldova - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlfhtSLHiT0)\n\nThis grant builds off of last year’s event, and will place $ApeCoin at the center of the experience. $Ape is designed to drive culture forward and as a tool for developers to participate in the ecosystem by incorporating $Ape into services, games, and projects.\n\nNFTxExplore and her colleague will provide web3 learning experiences to spread the $Ape brand and position $ApeCoin at the forefront of web3 innovation and creativity. We’ll lead web3 learning experiences, invite $Ape mentors from the DAO to lead sessions, and create an onsite art installation as part of the 4-day experience.\n\nThe art installation will be in collaboration with another Ladies of BAYC member, artist Stella (@Stellitart), and local artists. As a part of this engagement, we will produce an art product available free to $Ape holders. We will also invite local and international media to cover the event and amplify the $Ape brand across web3.\n\nWe seek $28,400 USD.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nItem and Detailed Costs\nDesign & Development:\n* Weekly meetings with Moldovan organizations\n* Design of learning experiences: 4 days of facilitation, PPT decks, workshops\n* Planning with local artist(s) / @Stellitart / HUG\n* $5000\n\nTravel + Per Diem (3 people)\n* Flights + Hotel + Food (all approximate):\n* Flights: $1,400 each = $4200\n* Hotel: $1,200 each = $3600\n* Food $50/day each = $600\n* Total: $8400\n\nHonorariums for Mentors/Experts (Zoom) and locals (Moldova) Approximately 5-7 people ($350 – $500)\n* Total: $3500 (approximate)\n\n3-month Mentorship (October 2023- December 2023)\n* Mentorship for creators (3 creators/teams): personal mentorship from the HUG Team for 3-months. This incubator begins with a four-week intensive curriculum that engages other web3 projects from around the world. Mentorship includes training in customer/community discovery, brand development, media planning, go-to-market strategy, and more.\n* Total: $10,000 (approximate)\n\nArtwork, Supplies / Distribution: \n* $1500\n\nTotal Requested: $28,400\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-255-ape-x-innovation-expanding-the-ape-universe/12371\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

Applicants put themselves forward and nomination profiles were posted on Discourse for community discussion. Since May 28th, the community has been discussing, engaging, and providing feedback to the nominees. Now it is time to vote for the 5 candidates who will move to the Special Council election vote that will take place from June 22-28.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nNone\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the Nomination Announcement: \nhttps://forum.apecoin.com/t/nomination-announcement-ape-foundation-special-council-term-beginning-july-2023/12395\n\nLink to the Nomination Profiles: \nhttps://forum.apecoin.com/c/special-council-elections/special-council-nominees/35\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

However, newcomers to the DAO may not be familiar with these systems, and the lack of instructional material available to them, such as video content, infographics, or live training, can lead to confusion, inactivity, and low participation (the ApeCoin DAO may be their first ever interaction with a DAO). This leaves new DAO members on their own to find their way around. This AIP aims to provide a central, easy to understand source of information for new members to use as a reference. Getting new members of the DAO up to speed and answering basic questions on day one will benefit the DAO across the board. \n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n$10,000 in $APE at time of funding\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-251-apecoin-dao-101-the-ultimate-guide-for-apecoin-dao-newcomers/12392\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-238: Mecha Chaotic: Forge - Add chaos to your PFP",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nTHE FORGE\nIntro Video\n\n![image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/8/830b3bde59ae947666589267b44ea2c1e1e32bfe.jpeg) \n[Mecha Chaotic Forge Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK_02BQgiWc)\n\nThe Forge is an interactive, community-driven platform created by Mecha Chaotic that allows Mecha Chaotic NFT holders to customize and enhance their NFTs from other Collection. By collaborating with their artist, Ethan S. Brewerton, during livestreams, NFT holders can create and add unique traits to their existing NFTs, giving them a personalized touch. This innovative approach to NFT customization encourages community involvement and enhances the value of the NFTs by making them a one-of-a-kind companion piece.\n\nWHAT WILL THE GRANT DO?\nThis grant will power everything that I do for the next year. This would give me the freedom to focus on creating and innovating as I’ve done for the last 2 years in the space. One of the biggest current projects for me being The Forge.\n\nSo one of the first and most obvious things that the grant will do is that it will allow me make the best Forge possible. That’s awesome, but what does that look like?\n\nIt looks like me going from community to community making traits with them, putting them in the Forge, and those communities having a great time playing with their NFTs in a way they haven’t been able to before.\nCollectors will collaborate with me to make the traits, and then again while choosing what traits they’d like to use on their PFP in the Forge.\n\nThink of me as a traveling performer promoting myself while serving the communities I’m performing in. All the while promoting myself, Mecha Chaotic, and most importantly for you all, ApeCoin.\n\n![image2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/e/e9847c2a5796c95c212922bdcb5fa87c71c2d3b4.png)\n\nUSER INTERFACE UPDATE\n\nThis would also fund a significant update to the User’s experience while using the Forge. Such as, while currently we can accept $APE and other ERC20s as a mint currency, we have to pick which currency to use every mint cycle. We would like to make it so that our users have the choice of what currency to use. $APE or $ETH or a number of other ERC20 tokens for whatever collection they’re Forging.  ![image3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/2/26dfdc08803417d1c54cbcd74e417009af8ad0d6.png)  GUEST ARTISTS\n\nAdditionally, we will be adding a feature that will allow guest artists to create traits for their own Forged collections. This will take this concept to the next level and expand this concept far beyond what I could do on my own. The Forge would take all of the following from all of the artists involved and focus them into the Forge, where $APE would be prominently featured.\n\nTo do this, we will need to implement an improved UI for adding traits to the “collection” files to populate each collection with metadata such as categories, trait layering, trait organization, as well as a way for artists to submit the trait artwork.\n\nCurrently the process is very code based and would potentially be confusing, in addition to leaving room for errors that could break their collection. We’d aim to reduce or completely eliminate that possibility with the UI.\n\nTHE FUTURE\n\nThese are just the ideas that I have right now, but I will undoubtedly have many more along the way on how to improve this experience, or how I could innovate other aspects of the space through this process. This grant would fund this and those future ideas.\n\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nI request 19,000 $APE to add a variable payment system, quality of life UI elements, incorporate a feature to allow guest artists to make their own Forge Traits, A system for trait rarity (i.e. limited uses per trait), as well as other creative ideas that are spawned from this process. \n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-238-mecha-chaotic-forge-add-chaos-to-your-pfp/11634\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nAs a member of the Ape community, you’re part of one of the strongest communities in Web3. However, despite the wealth of talent and opportunity within the community, it can be difficult for members to connect and collaborate effectively without the right tools. That’s why ApeTalent was born - one of the first software products developed from scratch by and supported by the ApeCoin community. With ApeTalent, we’re taking collaboration and communication within the community to the next level, creating a hub for talent and opportunity that will benefit all members of the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n![image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/9/9bc1cedc3d256336a349c8fabf101aa3ca5a10d0.gif)\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nWe are committed to delivering value to the community as soon as possible. In order to achieve this, we have divided the work into 3 blocks of 4 months each, for a total of 1 year of work. The funding request is $330,000 USD worth of ApeCoin (on the date of this AIP is approved), which will be divided into payments for each block of work completed ($110,000 each).\n\nWe will only receive the next payment for block once we have confirmed with the Foundation that the work for the current block is ready in production, as agreed upon in this AIP, starting the first payment once this proposal is accepted. This payment schedule ensures that we are held accountable for delivering the agreed-upon features in a timely manner and that our community can have confidence in our commitment to providing value.\n\nThe funds obtained in this AIP will provide us with enough help to finance the development, bug fixing and maintenance costs of these new features in the time window of a year since the feature is ready in production.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-235-apetalent-beyond-talent-building-the-future/11525\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-179: NFTCG Generation 2 - ApeCoin DAO Physical & Digital Trading Card Game",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\nThe proposal presents the idea that NFTCG Generation 2 will feature Bored Ape Yacht Club as the pilot collection that introduces PBTs (Physically Backed Tokens) under the EIP-5791 contract, in the form of a physical and digital collectable trading card game. Each physical trading card will contain an immutable private key that ties itself to a token on the Ethereum blockchain. This not only allows for immediate authentication of every physical trading card, but also allows for future on-chain interaction in order to play NFTCG within the Otherside. In doing so, BAYC is able to leverage the mainstream trading card market as the gateway into the BAYC community, while simultaneously pushing forward the first macro implementation of PBT technology within the Web 3.0 and IOT space. \n\nEach booster pack in this pilot collection is exclusively purchasable in $APE, pushing forward further exposure and adoption of the token. 5% of revenue generated from NFTCG Generation 2 “Going Bananas” and ALL FUTURE Yuga Labs related collections will be donated towards endeavors that are to benefit the Ape DAO as a whole. These endeavors are to be decided based on Ape DAO participation and community thought. Suggestions include an agreement to redistribute the donation back to the ApeCoin DAO community directly, burn the $APE, or donate it to a charity of the community’s choice. This is in an effort to give back to the $APE DAO and thank the community for their efforts.  \n\n![image1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/1/13cb2dfde15987c9af66cb4c8d0779a58cff0813_2_624x312.png)\n\n   #### OVERALL COST   \n##### Total Cost: $55,885 in $APE\n* Phase 1: Card Selection and Final Advisory Board [$0.00]\n    * Raffle for selected cards in collection and advisory board: $0\n* Phase 2: Illustration & Designs [$4,630]\n    * Card illustrations and designs for each selected ape: $4,130\n    * Test prints and balanced gameplay testing: $500\n* Phase 3: NFTC Chip Manufacturing, Calibrating, and EIP-5791 Creation [$42,230]\n    * Cost of encoded NFTC chips with OpenSea page integration: $5.95 * 6000 cards = $35,700\n    * Backend contract implementation for each of the 6000 encoded NFTC chips: $6,530\n* Phase 4: Booster Pack Manufacturing and Packing [$6,645]\n    * Trading card manufacturing and holographic foil effects: $5,345\n    * Booster pack manufacturing and manual card organization and packaging: $1,300\n* Phase 5: Website Developments and Launch [$2,380]\n    * Metamask integration and staked $APE wallet detector: $2,380\n    * Updated website features such as product images, rules and a collection breakdown: $0\n\n![image2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/4/4a0c6f0af8000832cca5133cc740034624802796_2_624x444.png)\n #### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-179-nftcg-generation-2-apecoin-dao-physical-digital-trading-card-game/9743\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

Since APE coin is primarily held in self-custodial wallets, securely storing wallet seed phrases is essential to minimize risks like hacks, loss, or theft. My proposal seeks funding to manufacture 1,500 Apebooks or more as needed (Added Cost below) while incorporating our patent-pending design from the [Sheildfolio Stonebook](https://shieldfolio.com/products/shieldfolio-stonebook). Crucially, this initiative strengthens long-term voting participation, empowering members to manage their $APE safely to make informed decisions that positively impact the future of the Apecoin Dao.  ![image1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/7/78cd4b59c44c2c7718b28254fce259a940788d36.png) *Apebook Seed Phrase Stonebook*  ![image2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/4/4a6070abefa1e7ffd85fa697cbdd367ad26252e4.png) *(Trezor and Laptop not included) Apebook notebook only*  #### OVERALL COST   This section proposes a budget for the development, printing, production, and shipping of 1,500 Apebooks, which amounts to $47,200 USD in APE  #### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-241-apebook-self-custody-seed-phrase-notebook/11723\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

Projects looking to launch through the Ape Accelerator will require $APE token to submit a proposal, and holders of $APE and BAYC Ecosystem NFTs will be able to access the launchpad to invest in these projects.\n\nDeck [DocSend]([https://docsend.com/view/688xg28g3d93hwdf](https://docsend.com/view/688xg28g3d93hwdf)) [Twitter Thread]([https://twitter.com/harry_forj/status/1583269222750113792](https://twitter.com/harry_forj/status/1583269222750113792))\n\n**Draft UI/UX Design for Ape Launchpad**(4th revision)\n\nThe product images and information shown are for illustration purposes only and may not be an exact representation of the product, which is subject for further change.\n\n![Image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/a/a7cd108bc10a4b1d63fd6f384e8e69c67360f512_2_566x1000.jpeg)\n![image2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/f/f7e98fb6779ff85b5e8bfe24d0bd3c8f06ecc075_2_556x1000.png)\n\nForj, a subsidiary of Animoca Brands, has been a BAYC holder since May 2022. Our mission is to empower BAYC IP Growth, from being clubhouse advocate to building the first BAYC experience in The Sandbox that attracted 165k plays and 46k unique players, to driving mass awareness with monthly Yuga IP ecosystem map. We created the Yuga IP Ecosystem map, showcased regularly since August 2022 gaining over 2M impressions up to date. The amount of projects joining the BAYC IP ecosystem grow from 70+in August 2022 to 247 in Feb 2023, nearly 250% increase.\n\n**Yuga IP Ecosystem Map** (Feb 2023)\n\n![Image3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/e/efab05015bbb7233686c0e3bc1b8e2004306bbd9_2_274x1000.jpeg)\n\nThrough 1 on 1 calls with founders, we see projects encounter the challenges of 1) Lack of Web2 audience, 2) Lack of ongoing utility for their projects, 3) Low frequency of interaction. With the Ape Accelerator, we want to accelerate the BAYC IP ecosystem growth by building the launchpad for NFT sales and distribution, providing incubation and advisory projects on Strategic Partnerships, Storytelling, Tokenomics design, Capital Support and Distribution. We would like to form the strategic incubation vertical to maximize cohort synergy for Yuga’s ecosystem growth\n\n\nAs a Animoca Brand subsidiary, Forj has\n\n- Animoca ecosystem projects exposure to participate in the sale\n- Deal flow from Animoca investment portfolio\n- Wide connections to NFT projects and VCs\n- Already established launchpad that have successfully launched 20+ projects e.g., Kylin Network, Altava, Phantom Galaxies\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n##### Total Ecosystem Ask - $480,000 USD in ApeCoin (~126,616 APE)\n\n$300k Development Cost\n\n- UI/UX design - $40k\n- Front End - $90k\n- Smart Contract Development - $90k\n- Contract Deploy & Audit - $80k\n\n$180k Operation Cost - for the first six months ($30k per month)\n\nTeam members:\n\n- 1 product manager\n- 1 Front End Developer\n- 1 designer\n- 1 operation associate\n- 1 business development\n- 1 marketing associate\n- website maintenance/snapshot/airdrop\n\nIf the Ape Foundation will not be able to provide a subdomain, we will set up its own domain. We secured [apeaccelerator.com](http://apeaccelerator.com/) as a potential domain option. And the cost will be included in the website maintenance.\n\nCommission - 5% on each Ape launchpad sale revenue\n\nAllocation - 25% of total Ape launchpad allocation\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: [https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-209-ape-accelerator-powered-by-apecoin/10818](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-209-ape-accelerator-powered-by-apecoin/10818)\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nThe ApeCoin DAO is built on the fundamental goal of enabling Yugaverse and ApeCoin holders with value. To date, the focus has been enabling marketplaces, communications, IRL events/education, and physical assets. We believe a DEX can be the next big thing.\nApeCoin itself is trading on most major CEXs and DEXs (centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges). There are a wide range of fees charged by these exchanges associated with opening and closing positions, and conducting swaps.\nOur vision is to create an ApeCoin DAO decentralized exchange (DEX) to benefit ApeCoin holders. The ApeCoin DAO DEX will enable the decentralized exchange of ERC-20 tokens supported by multi-asset pools that earn liquidity providers fees from market making and swap fees. We expect to help create the lowest possible trading fees available in all of DeFI for $APE holders, stakers, and buyers.\nOur core contract functionality will include rewarding LP providers in $APE, thus creating an important use-case around utility for $APE and activating significant deflationary pressure on the token. The impact should be greater utility, engagement, and value for our DAO. \n\n![image](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/7/7b67036c174dacb03894624014eccdbb5165a43e_2_1248x878.png)\n*Draft UI mockup*\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n##### 39,000 $APE\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-223-a-community-first-apecoin-dao-dex-ecosystem-fund-allocation/11062\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\n##### TLDR : This proposal aims to present the ApeCoinDAO brand and weekly AIP updates on well-respected 3rd party Twitter Spaces to reach new audiences. This proposal aims to leverage Twitter Spaces as a resource to raise awareness about the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\nBy educating new users about the ApeCoin DAO through regular Web 3.0 focused Twitter Spaces, we encourage community engagement and aim to onboard thousands of potential new members.\n\nThis effort will be instrumental in increasing participation and the number of stakeholders invested in the governance of the project, which adds to the further decentralisation of the DAO.\n\ndNFTs more like damn, NFTs \n\nWe’ll use on chain data from Dynamic NFTs connected to Chainlink’s oracle to track KPIs and performance metrics. These NFTs will go through stages of Evolution, reflecting acknowledged contributions. This data and feedback from the pilot will inform their potential use across the entire DAO.\nMore about it in the dedicated section\nCheck this out : [ApeCoin Tracker](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/apecoin-tracker-tracking-anon-txns-wrt-the-treasury/11591)\n\n##### Brief Overview :\n* This proposal is for a 60-day trial-run to provide a weekly ApeCoinDAO update across multiple Web3/NFT Twitter Spaces deemed the best audience-DAO-culture-fit.\n* By reaching new users through regular Web3 focused Twitter Spaces, we encourage curiosity and onboard hundreds of potential builders, creators, artists and other NFT communities to the DAO.\n* This effort is instrumental in increasing participation and the overall number of stakeholders invested in the governance of the project, which adds to the further decentralisation of the DAO.\n* This proposal requests a grant of UP TO 15,000 ApeCoin tokens to go directly to 10-15 Twitter Spaces and their teams as a Scholarship for an initial trial period of 60 days (approximately 60 appearances).\n\nWe are shooting for 5 spaces in the first month at up to 1000 APE each, which’ll be scaled up to 10 in the 2nd month.\n\nObligatory “Up to” cause some spaces will be much less, some would be sponsored giveaways and the better ones will be Scholarship based.\n\n#### OVERALL COST \n\nThe maximum cost for this proposal over its 60 day running period (including giveaways, scholarships and partnerships) is estimated to be up to 15,000 ape with a max cap of 1000 ape per space\n\nThe funds will be transferred by the treasury directly to the Creators without the need for external management. This ensures no misappropriation of DAO funds can take place.\n\nWe’ll start with 5 spaces in the first month and scale it upto 10 spaces in the following month.\n* May - working budget of 5,000 APE\n* June - working budget of 10,000 APE\n\nFor comparison: Rug Radio costs approx. $5k USD for a single appearance Nifty Portal costs approx. $10k USD for a month of once weekly updates read by a team member\n\n###### Total Request is 15,000 APE for 60 Days\n\nAuthor is taking Zero Comp for this effort, a follow-up proposal may include some form of compensation \n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-233-a-c-t-on-twitter-spaces-60-day-trial/11427\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP.

As she tries to find out who she is, she meets familiar characters (Jenkins, Andrew, SpottieWIFI, and the traveling Sealsman, among others), gets embroiled in world politics full of magic, right-click savers, and inter-collection intrigue, and has to decide between going home or defending this strange land from a full-scale invasion by [redacted].\n\n![c564c4a3e27e740fe7336badd8899be6dcb2ff38.jpeg](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/c/c564c4a3e27e740fe7336badd8899be6dcb2ff38_2_367x500.jpeg)\n    \n(illustration by fellow ape [Julian the Creative](https://twitter.com/Juliandacreatve/status/1640736379054243840?s=20) ) \n\n#### OVERALL COST \n\n$28,150 paid in ApeCoin\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-236-fantasy-novel-about-nfts/11561\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

The main feature of the platform is a set of tools that enable community members to easily build, connect, and interact with one another as they manage their islands together.\n\nThrough the platform, community members can find statistics and information on their desired islands. The platform also serves as a marketplace/aggregator that facilitates the process of finding and becoming a part of an island with other community members who share the same interests and goals.\nOverall, the platform’s primary focus is on providing tools for DAOs, with the marketplace/aggregator feature serving as a secondary aspect that supports the formation and management of island communities. \n\n#### OVERALL COST \n\n$48,000 equivalent in $APE\n~$2,240 will be the base cost for hosting services for the first year.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-227-nothersight-public-goods-for-building-daos-based-on-islands-in-the-otherside/11230\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

Under this proposal, the DAO will select two Discourse Facilitators via DAO-wide vote, while @Lost.Admin will be seeded as the third Discourse Facilitators, to ensure continuity from the current Discourse Facilitator team.

This will empower members of the DAO to make meaningful contributions and participate in facilitating governance operations, in order to further decentralize key functions of the DAO. Working Groups enable a sustainable infrastructure which will allow the DAO to operate efficiently while adapting to any challenges.\n\nPlease see the [FAQ here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tjloWCfZX8bufYmGielsCDpPzkgcLy8TaM_ZVbndMw4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n![image1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/3/33263d2193000750063bbafd163cef7dcfe063e9_2_522x500.jpeg)\n\n#### Links to other Working Group Charters:\n\n##### 1. Treasury: Working Group Charter - *[Treasury](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/11835)*\n* The Treasury Working Group’s Mandate is to: “Explore legal and governance structures that would enable the DAO to sustain operations and Initiatives in perpetuity. The Treasury Working Group would also oversee a portion of the ApeCoin DAO’s assets, exploring ways to deploy them thoughtfully on-chain while promoting a non-custodial environment.”\n\n##### 2. Metaverse: Working Group Charter - *[Metaverse](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/11840)*\n* The Metaverse Working Group’s Mandate is to: “Drive culture forward into the metaverse by actively supporting metaverse-related efforts within the ApeCoin DAO.”\n\n##### 3. Marketing and Communications: *[Working Group Charter - Marketing & Communications](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/11837)*\n* The Marketing and Communications Working Group’s Mandate is to: “Create a consistent and compelling brand strategy and identity for the ApeCoin DAO, develop and implement comprehensive marketing and communications strategies, and establish a strong presence through effective global communication efforts in order to onboard more users into the DAO.”\n\n#### OVERALL COST \n\nThis AIP is requesting up to $180,000 USD in $APE using the price of APE when the grant is issued in order to fund the operations of the Governance Working Group.\n\nThe Governance Working Group will invoice the Foundation as needed against this budget until the Governance Working Group Multisig is deployed with four signers including the DAO Secretary. The Governance Working Group will then take custody of the budget.\n\n![image2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/6/6f525137715f06bd25f6a4793980597208931887.png)\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-239-working-group-guidelines-the-governance-working-group-charter/11462\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nApe Page builds you a personalized website/URL that highlights all the important things related to your Ape. Link to your Ape Page from anywhere to show off your involvement in the ecosystem. \nOver the last year, the Yuga ecosystem has exploded. Otherside Deeds, Mutant Cartel, pets, Sewer Passes, claims, ApeCoin, the list goes on and on. You’ve been working hard to keep up and work your way through the ranks of the Yugaverse, but all that involvement is hard to visualize. Sure, you can show people some NFTs on your Opensea profile or Tweet about your new Tier 4 Sewer Pass, but telling the story of how it all fits with the community and your PFP is tedious or disconnected at best.  That’s where Ape Page comes in. Connect your wallet, and Ape Page automatically pulls together your BAYC/MAYC PFPs, Sewer Passes, Pets, Jenkins Licenses, ApeCoin Staking stats, wearables, derivatives, Discord Roles, PFP Lore, achievements (and more) into a unique website with a custom URL belonging to you and your ape: 1234.MAYC.PAGE.\n\nStop wasting time explaining how your Ape PFP is more than a monkey picture. Drop the link anywhere (Discord, Twitter, leaderboards… within Otherside) to show off how baller your Ape is.\n\nBy supporting this proposal, you will enable us to provide free page claims (minus gas fees) to all Ape holders and keep pages live for the first year. To claim a page, you’ll need to own an Ape (BAYC/MAYC) and have a minimum of 10 $APE in your wallet. We plan to support wallet delegation for ownership verification and to enable cross-wallet display of items and NFTs.\n\n![401e4a227e45029bdd5f59ddaca94bd213a0b517.png](ipfs://bafkreifojfcycene27fevif4y7ztk6kni64e2kymnt6cmydl6iajifo4c4)\n    \nClaimed pages will be publicly available at [Ape ID].mayc.page or [Ape ID].bayc.page and only modifiable by the Ape holder.\nCheck out the progress we’ve already made here: www.apes.page  \n\n![7540a2929efb422e5e23fb0a6b243b47490ac0f0.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreid4pmuiy4aaezmlgpm7vudp32ani6pfragxg2dvkjf3hr5xw6sw6u)\n    \n![jpg](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/a/a83f08c269d1b2a349a7a0033a76ba39053d9ba6.png)\n\n\n#### OVERALL COST \n\n$125k - Roughly 25k Apecoin\n\nWe are offering to receive 20% up-front and the remaining 80% upon release of the first version of the app to ensure completion.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-225-ape-page-one-place-for-everything-about-your-ape/11200\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

NFT Embed is a free tool from Graviton, providing Shopify and Stripe functionality for NFTs. NFT Embed is free to use; Graviton will deploy an initial marketplace for ApeCoin DAO.\n\nMarketplace fee: 0.30%, including a 0.30% base fee and a 0.00% finder’s fee. The finder’s fee amount and recipient is customizable, by collection, and can be ‘turned on’ when ApeCoin DAO has infrastructure and processes to accept revenue.\n\nNFT Embed is powered by Universe’s decentralized, open-source, audited 1 2 marketplace that supports any collection and major tokens including $APE. Building with trustless, customizable solutions mitigates counter-party risks and compounds economic benefits attributable to marketplace ownership.\n\n#### OVERALL COST \n\nNFT Embed is free to use.\n\nUpon approval, Graviton has committed to providing and managing a domain for this marketplace, which will be communicated to ApeCoin DAO upon release. The marketplace will support Ecosystem assets (for those collections that are released before the marketplace is live), as defined, and launch with the 0.30% marketplace fee and 0% finder’s fee.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-118-apecoin-dao-marketplace-via-nft-embed-provided-by-graviton-and-powered-by-universe/8345\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

This proposal presents the idea that the Forever Apes team develop a custom built plugin to address this issue and facilitate the integration of $APE into the displayed currency on Shopify product pages. This plugin will be available to retailers at NO COST and will immediately enhance the platform’s functionality, while increasing visibility and encouraging wider adoption amongst their 2 million plus DAU. We’re choosing to build this plugin on Shopify but recognize it caters to a mostly North American audience, we will expand the plugin’s availability to other eComm platforms once demand is proven.\n\nProduct mock for visual purposes only.

I decided to get it implemented by reaching out to Horizen Labs. which they were happy about the findings and implemented the findings at the last moments.\n* This proposal will set an example and a motivation for open source contributors to contribute to the DAO and obey by one of the main DAO’s guiding values: “Collective Responsibility: We leave everything better than we found it.”\n\n#### OVERALL COST \n\n6000 APE\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-208-reflecting-on-aip161-feedback-and-revising-proposed-reward/10766\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "#### ABSTRACT \n\nThis grant builds on prior work done by MAYC #16168 to enhance web3 skill sets and expand economic opportunities. In September, 2022, she and a colleague from HUG (a leading web3 technology accelerator) designed and launched Moldova’s first web3 Hackathon and a series of learning experiences for over 500 people in Chisinau, Moldova (see [Bored Ape Gazette article](https://www.theboredapegazette.com/post/spotlight-this-bored-ape-yacht-club-member-is-working-to-onboard-more-users-to-web3-via-hackathons) and [Metalaunchers blog post](https://metalaunchers.medium.com/moldova-expands-its-horizons-into-web3-2f4969d2e69f)). \n\nThis grant aims to deepen and expand that initial engagement through 1) continued outreach to educators and students to build on the prior engagement in Moldova 2) expand web3 learning experiences to independent media and local entrepreneurs in Moldova, and 3) to launch 3 additional Hackathons in 2023.

Aside from columns featuring news and difference makers from outside of our ecosystem, content will focus on the ApeCoinDAO, ApeCoinDAO-led initiatives, successful ApeCoinDAO AIPs, and ApeCoin use cases; Yuga Labs and the growing number of projects under their umbrella; brands utilizing holder IP; diversity within regional meetup groups; female collectors; augmented reality through a sponsorship with [Art House](https://www.arthouse.ar/); gaming; art, tech and blockchain. All primary sales will be conducted in APE, contributors will be paid in APE and any future revenue raised from in-magazine advertising will be received in APE.\n\n![7a8965fe628196ffd743b2f0b881b60fda91b8a9_2_1035x690.png](ipfs://bafkreicls456jlpmrsc5fdchfmgh2yabp2ehbletdux7ukj4k3y5rorza4)\n\nOur mission is to create an onramp into the ApeCoin and Yuga Labs ecosystems while strengthening ties between existing communities. We will take an ethical approach to journalism, provide culture-driven meaningful content, and act as a springboard for existing and up-and-coming artists. Our team is made up by a creative director with a history in bookmaking alongside a team of illustrators and graphic designers.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreigcmfy4itstoeh5sucbtni5v5jqlzhab2vw2pqmuupwfjeykeh5dm)\n\n![42126cb63d7d2e9295e3d2764cdc48d29be48c0e_2_999x750.jpg](ipfs://bafkreidemp4c5gss4wh722e7aud4i26b4rpb5tqx56ksz7ajvgz756z3mq)\n\nWe also want to further-facilitate artists by providing interview space and fair compensation for cover art. Additional features include spotlights on active community members; regional BAYC groups like Bored Club Canada, TaiwanDAO, FrenchApeYC and associations like PinkDAO; women in the space; Blender tips and tech talk; metaverse; memes; music and photography; generative artwork; Meebin with the Meebits; Mutants are INSANE; Mutant Cartel and the Mutant Hounds; Cryptopunks and Cryptopunks history; 10ktf; interviews; features on ApeCoinDAO Special Council members and Stewards; discussions with founders; security tips; advertisements from brands utilizing holder IP (ApeWater, ForeverApes etc); gaming; as well as articles written by contributors sourced from projects like Nouns, Doodles, Gutter Cat Gang, Moonbirds, CloneX, and Deadfellaz. We will also be including advanced in-magazine AR capabilities to bring artwork, advertising and otherwise static NFTs to life triggered by QR codes. \n\n![5f77ffd0f8b4de9f38ab8a852dd2cef564e959fb_2_1035x679.jpg](ipfs://bafkreib6hc4bun5ccd6z43quedifd6qrfuc7mw2uuqoxoygw7odviwbute)\n\n![108d4299001c473572f2758565f5065d0cf15787_2_999x750.jpg](ipfs://bafkreic3pcb2hfw4on7elfycxgcgwbmkbie3xqtu2yrw2ivesvik6ngusq)\n\nAlso important to note that as marketing in the NFT space shifts away from macro influencers we believe that providing community-driven content packaged in a collectible physical form will initiate broader trust from outsiders and better prepare them for onboarding. It should also be said that for some collectors, tangible products often feel longer lasting or more real than digital; particularly to those just entering the space. That being said many others prefer tokens, so keeping those community members in mind we want to include additional NFT packs based on Beyond the SWAMP NFT rarity.\n\n![18f40013a316ed30707e8ce86f7fd12d2f6ae9cc_2_1035x582.jpg](ipfs://bafkreibbshdklqm5o5wpfkzvytfar5az6ymmvdqggui4wphzrfaiya46x4)\n\n![a5f08e3fc5bc960915993e1c14e95e564042babb_2_1035x582.jpg](ipfs://bafkreidd5gc2jweyexc3kfa2fugjfu46uroqlabmjmsppaop4izfk52j5m)\n\nBeyond the SWAMP is seeking a one-time grant for company development and first issue production. The layout of our magazine will be completed by a team of career creatives specializing in layout, illustration and graphic design. Beginning with an initial rollout of 350 copies, we will create an economy of scale increasing to 500 copies for our second issue and 750 copies from issues three to six totalling 3850 magazines in our first year at an average production cost of $13.63 per copy. Taking this approach will allow us to grow our readership cautiously during tumultuous market conditions while lowering the overall grant request and cost to the community. External services and service providers include advisors, legal, website builders, smart contract developer, audit team, printing and promotion. \n\n![9c766c9846872148a15c43edbe4f28dba1e6638c_2_1035x679.jpg](ipfs://bafkreih3e76kvvtfhykm3gdx6xmdk5likeng42zm2fgfk5u5cmplrwpkvi)\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nOverall cost: $52,500 USD \n\nAPE ($30,600.00)\n\n- $4000.00 Advisors\n- $3200.00 Columnists and contributors\n- $3000.00 Cover/featured artist\n- $7500.00 Publishing manager (3 months x $2500.00)\n- $1700.00 Otherdeed golden cover\n- $1700.00 Otherdeed Twitter\n- $2000.00 Additional NFTs (for rarity tiers created by artists for Beyond the SWAMP)\n- $2500.00 Marketing\n- $5000.00 Contingency planning & additional marketing (as needed)\n\nUSDC ($21,900.00)\n\n- $5000.00 Legal (NDAs, releases, copyright review, etc)\n- $4500.00 Logo and graphic design\n- $3500.00 Website w/Web3 + smart contract development\n- $1500.00 Third party website and smart contract audit\n- $3500.00 Printing\n- $525.00 Packaging\n- $500.00 Promo (stickers, posters, etc)\n- $1800.00 Dedicated iMac\n- $600.00 Adobe Create Cloud\n- $225.00 Ledger 3 Pack (funds, deployer, giveaway NFTs)\n- $250.00 Converted to ETH - deploy contract (gas)\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibjdp77mdnvmfcb7uz6ehpbovjorl76lmmuavkxht2ckosozc34oe)\n    \n#### PROPOSAL \n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-169-beyond-the-swamp-bimonthly-apecoin-yuga-labs-focused-magazine-nft/9608 \n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-168: The Legend of ApeCoin: Atrium Casting Call",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nTo produce 12 independent animations with a run time of 1 minute each.\n\nThis proposal introduces an ecosystem-wide casting call to all eligible IP Holders powered by ApeCoin. The animators of Atrium have experience with Disney, Pixar, HBO, Netflix & more and await the opportunity to co-create with community members. Funding this proposal showcases ApeCoin’s dedication to providing new avenues for creators and results in 12 animations under a “Legend of ApeCoin” theme.\n\nRationale of Value Added to ApeCoin\n\n- In an increasingly digital landscape, content rules permanence and brand recall. Good brands build timeless content that fans can anchor on. That in turn creates an increasingly valuable ecosystem around it. As the canon storylines are created officially by Yuga, this proposal to the ApeCoin DAO community has a unique opportunity to co-create equally memorable characters and storylines that are completely driven bottoms-up.\n- Being crypto native and having highly experienced talent from the animation industry (Pixar, Sony, Netflix, Dreamworks, Marvel), Atrium is uniquely positioned to work with ApeCoin DAO to create content that appeals to mainstream audience, bring more awareness to an already lovable crypto-native brand and deliver co-created cinematic content.\n\nHow does this benefit DAO + DAO members?\n\n- ApeCoin DAO produces the storylines the community creates involving the ApeCoin brand.\n- Co-create with crypto native network of qualified animators and filmmakers.\n- Reinforces top of mind for community-produced content on all social channels (Atrium’s previously created content has recorded millions of impressions and hundreds of thousands of views in aggregate).\n- Crypto native distribution mechanism of artifacts used in the production (content viewing, companion mints all made available free to the community members)\n\nBased on the overall reception of the pilot short-film series, if community wants to expand on any specific storyline - Atrium will have logistics In place to build out the series with follow-up proposal.\n\nWhat is Atrium?\n\nAtrium is a blockchain-backed network of artists and creators. Disciplines represented on Atrium currently include Screenwriting, Animation, Concept Art, Voice Actors, and Music production.\n\nSecuring top-quality creative talent who are well versed in the NFT space and committed to supporting the long-term growth of an ecosystem is extraordinarily difficult. Here at Atrium, we have curated and nurtured a collective of outstanding animators, illustrators, storytellers, and all-around remarkable creatives.Take a look at a few of our creators below.\n\n[3DPG:](https://atrium.art/artist/3d-print-guy)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreifjfekdx3rm6bbfqnctxbon3xinud4idv4ream7rarnqhdzmcspyu)\n    \n[ZenDoubt](https://atrium.art/artist/zendoubt)\n\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiampf7abehbot3tljdnzdfe7bthgjvc44f4w4sc74r5l6qmhxqgxq)\n    \n[HKJAY:](https://atrium.art/artist/hkjay)\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihejf5xcetuaqfkrh6cvtuyqge6t7wmjk2qcwahaqjjc23n57wqm4)\n    \n[Phuncal:](https://atrium.art/artist/phuncal)\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreib3rf3lslvbhcola2m2fsvsx6ppow2kco4vnsfqxdql2cb2k6vzzi)\n    \nRetroSketch:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifcvarqxqbo7cecmelfyvpqi3sl2cki6ylsmekctq6pknt2kgvhie)\n    \nIndy\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreic7kqo2dtai6f5hrf2sxuqrxfl44wlla53sfw7lyxvex6g3ydbvrq)\n    \nTimeline\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicuazcfagpam2aawfjsc4ignzv3usuu37ahjpy4arqgdjvczda3re)\n    \nWeb-App creation\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifavzx3r5i3ywpzqqqyusqi2e5743yimdclgad2dc2sxqmsnhbrja)\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nFunds requested from ApeCoin\n$200,000\n\nOur independent artists and animators will produce 12 stories for the first series.

      "title": "AIP-124: Thank APE: Decentralized, Automated Rewards for Valuable ApeCoin Contributions",
      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nWe propose to thank (reward and recognize) decentralized contributions to ApeCoin with $APE, charitable donations, and an on-chain thank you note. We will do it in a way that is scalable, automated, bot-protected… and rewards truly valuable contributions.\n\nThank APE is critical DAO infrastructure that can enormously increase opportunity, utility, and value for APE holders. We can encourage and thank the following categories of utility-creating contributions across platforms:\n\n- Governance participation\n- Onboarding & education\n- Intra-DAO collaboration\n- Defi & web3 partnerships\n- Community building\n- Completing Core Tasks\n- Art and culture innovations\n- Infrastructure innovations\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiab26bgkpfdfvgjzsombx4mxjfrl6djyoiyhrgbu7ehjiyrdnk3ze)\n\nHow it works\n1. ApeCoin members are auto-rewarded with $APE + on-chain thank you notes for valuable, decentralized contributions to the DAO.\n2. Members can keep rewards or donate them to approved charities that accept $APE.\n3. Sophisticated tech automates and scales thanking and filters out bots and bad actors to ensure real, valuable contributions are rewarded.\n\nTeam\n- Our Thank APE advisory board are seven OG BAYC and ApeCoin members. We are long-time community contributors with diverse backgrounds and skill sets. We are committed to ensuring Thank APE creates extraordinary value for our DAO.\n- Our Thank APE tech is supported by ThriveCoin. We are web3 natives and VC funded. Our leadership team has scaled tech to support millions of users. We are also long-time BAYC and ApeCoin community members.\n\nFunding (one time)\n1. $0 to start. 100% performance-based. Thank APE is rewarded only when we create value for ApeCoin.\n2. 0 $APE to 33.3k $APE / month (up to 200k total) allocated ONLY to ApeCoin members who make contributions that create value for our ApeCoin community.\n3. 0 $APE to 7k $APE / month (up to 42k total) for all tech, dev setup, servers, maintenance, white-labeling, integrations, support, and customization [offsets some infrastructure costs].\n4. $0 after six months: We’re building sustainable funding for Thank APE through exciting collaborations with core ApeCoin infrastructure you’ve voted for!\n\nMilestones\n- January: Community feedback and Snapshot vote!\n- February: Launch within 1 month of positive vote\n- March: Reward 30+ ways to contribute at launch\n- July: Reward 100+ ways to contribute by month 6\n- August: Fully sustainable funding model after six months\n- Monthly: Improve core DAO engagement metrics by >10% each month!\n\nWhy we made this proposal\n\nWe love this community. Our expertise is in driving utility and value for communities by automating and scaling decentralized rewards. We believe now is the time for ApeCoin to harness core infrastructure that can profoundly increase excitement, demand, and value in our DAO!\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreif2ey4e3bhv4e7hcmo372t2auuift67krcxuhmeg74t3apnst53km)\n    \n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nThank APE is a one-time cost that is entirely performance based. It uses, at most, less than .04% of the treasury. In return, it gives ApeCoin lasting, critical infrastructure to help scale decentralization, automation, and utility-creation long into the future!\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiaedzsmj3wi3jdhnzj5ld7d2khzjdqv3ifzg6ijxgdnoqasrzibdy)\n    \n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-124-thank-ape-decentralized-automated-rewards-for-valuable-apecoin-contributions/8564\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

We will facilitate future art installations and a series of graffiti contests. Our community has changed lives through these murals and we should be proud of these stories. We will document this campaign and artist’s stories through a series of mini-docs (think vice) and not let them get lost in the noise.\n\nAdditionally we will consolidate all new and existing street art on an Otherside inspired website. We believe this will grow ApeCoin brand awareness IRL as well as digital and traditional media. We will continue to positively impact emerging artists and give $APE holders a reason to explore a world of art they didn’t know existed. We are requesting a grant from the ApeCoin DAO to do this.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreianmiubgg5mgz6u5kllgnztqfpk3fs4rjtkveczabhcoktrw7jauq)\n    \n#### OVERALL COST\n\nThis section highlights the rough cost structure including collaborations, design, development, production, and PR.\n\n100% ApeCoin payment would be preferred.\n\nNo action outside of the grant will be required from the Ape Foundation, however any twitter exposure is appreciated.\n\nPlease see the attached document for the cost breakdown.\n\n- [AIP BUDGET LINK](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0659/6653/8995/files/AIP_5_BUDGET_-_MURALS_-_APE_PROPOSAL_2.pdf?v=1669309943)\n\nTotal Estimate: 41000 $APE\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-156-forever-apes-upgrade-5-apes-in-the-wild-global-street-art-initiative/9289\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\n[AIP-134](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-134-bug-bounty-program-for-aip-21/8792) recently requested budget to support the set up of a bug bounty program for the staking system. This proposal suggests we expand the budget and timeline + build a process that supports all future AIPs who’s ongoing operation poses risk to ApeCoin community members. We propose using treasury assets to fund a 1 million $APE bug bounty program with Immunefi, and partner with [Solidity.io](https://www.solidity.io/) to help design and implement the program + onboard new AIPs as they launch.\n\nThis proposal would unlock the first $20,000 $APE immediately to fund [Solidity.io](https://www.solidity.io/) costs for program set up, and the rest made available at program launch to fund white hat hackers until depleted. At this point the community can draft a second proposal to continue funding.\n\nWe believe it is very beneficial for the DAO to approve this program since the absence of this infrastructure and process leaves the DAO with only two options:\n\n1. Every new AIP must create a second AIP to request additional bug bounty funding which poorly allocates hacker rewards at scale.\n2. Accept the security risk.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nA total budget of 1 million $APE (roughly $4.5 million based on 30-day average $APE price).\n\nOperational costs are minimal, and the majority of the budget will be used to fund prizes for the program.\n\nThe program will end if the community creates a proposal asking to cease and unused funds would be returned.\n\nThe funds requested will be allocated as following:\n\nBug bounty rewards can be tiered based on the severity of the exploit, or can be based on % of value at risk. [Solidity.io](https://www.solidity.io/) and Immunefi will structure the program within the 1 million $APE budget being requested. All budget not listed below will go directly to white hat hackers.\n\n1. 20,000 $APE (~$60,000) paid to [Solidity.io](https://www.solidity.io/) upfront, for operating the ongoing program on behalf of the DAO.\n2. 20,000 $APE annually for each year the program runs with the first year paid 6-months following launch and every 12-months after.\n3. 10% performance fee paid to Immunefi on any vulnerabilities discovered (i.e. if a white hat hacker is paid $100,000 for a bug they discovered, Immunefi will receive $10,000)\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-155-should-we-fund-an-ongoing-bug-bounty-program-for-all-aip-s-that-introduce-security-risk/9278\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nThis proposal introduces a tool ([Catapult](https://catapult.xyz/)) that will help us unlock the power of the ApeCoin DAO community and put ourselves at the heart of the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nThe biggest challenge for all decentralized communities is the lack of context. Without easy ways to share who you are, what you’ve done, and to represent it to your community, it’s impossible to effectively contribute and build relationships.\n\nCatapult resolves this, empowering the community and its members, and driving value to the ApeDAO community (and therefore to APE).\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nCatapult will contribute 100% of their time and labour at zero cost to ApeCoin DAO.\n\nHowever, we do request an allocation of 10,000 APE for member onboarding incentives.\n\nThe full allocation would be used to incentivise members to go through the onboarding flow, which helps everyone learn more about the DAO (including basic structure, mission, values, governance, and more), build their profile, and take their first steps towards broader participation and connection in the DAO.\n\nWe are proposing that the first 5,000 members who go through this flow will each receive 2 APE.\n\nCatapult will also provide other incentives at its own cost. This will include, for example, POAPs for early members — which the team intends to form part of future reward programs.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-140-integrate-with-catapult-to-refine-dao-onboarding-participation/8870\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

Ensuring the security and efficiency is a high priority.\n- Multiple gas optimizations were proposed to the community and Horizen Labs team and received positive feedback, the team have implemented them and they are live on the mainnet staking contract.\n- For the input on optimizing the gas fees consumption that were disclosed and discussed previously on an AIP idea, a reward is proposed for the timely contribution.\n- Note that gas optimizations are completely out of AIP-134 bug bounty scope, as it is only focused on security vulnerabilities.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nProposed reward is a floor BAYC, equivalent to 10% of the funds saved upfront. It would be HODLed and staked to earn $APE rewards.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-161-a-reward-proposal-for-staking-contract-gas-optimization-contribution/9340\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nThis AIP provides for $165,000 USD (which includes a 10% contingency) to fund a marketing initiative to increase awareness of Ape Coin.\n\nImagine cheering for the ApeCoin sponsored race car in a nationally televised race! I want to bring ApeCoin to the NASCAR racing community. This can be accomplished in February 2023 during the most visible week of racing — at the World Center of Racing, Daytona International Speedway. We will involve the ApeCoin community by holding a contest to custom design a fully digital ApeCoin vinyl wrap for the 200 mph race car! That’s right, the ApeCoin community will design the look of the race car! The winner (and companion) will receive airfare, accommodations, Pit Road Patio Suite credentials to the race (The Lucas Oil 200) and infield/garage credentials to meet the team and the ApeCoin race car prior to the race. ALL members that vote for this initiative will be eligible to join us at Daytona and watch the race from the Pit Road Patio Suite (thats right behind the race teams on pit road)! We will have a random drawing for up to 35 members to join us and support the ApeCoin race car! The goal of this funding is to increase awareness and adoption of ApeCoin.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nTotal cost will be $165,000 USD (which includes a 10% contingency). This includes: all transportation, testing and racing costs, digital vinyl wrap, fan base marketing outreach at the track, marketing personnel, giveaways, Pit Road Patio Suite for the ApeCoin community, ApeCoin display race car and operation costs.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-136-apecoin-community-goes-racing-at-daytona-international-speedway/8841\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

Contributors would be compensated directly by the Ape Foundation on a monthly basis. ApeComms Operating Fund amounts would only be accessed as needed. Breakdown of compensation vs operating fund is available below.\n\nWe have been advised by the administrators during our previous AIP submission that we should provide an exact day each month to receive compensation. For our purposes, the first day of every month would be ideal to receive team compensation. For the ApeComms Operating Fund, for which we will submit invoices to be paid by the Ape Foundation, we kindly request those be paid as needed. We were also advised by the administrators to request an amount in USD, which is why we have done so.\n\nTable 7: Total cost to implement the proposal (note that this cost is for 3 months - click to enlarge):\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreibwgsthdwq2jvnx4dn4zqoouacia7cdxq6z7rfqs5igz2oitduqbm)    \n\nTable 8: Data used to calculate 3 month compensation (click to enlarge):\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreic43ijyo6bbbno4ue7yhkhesjofrxgtxwrn5our4usw6a43fxbb5m)\n    \nTable 9: Comparables that were used for compensation rates (click to enlarge):\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreicozlyxmuqgd5myxc2o44apifkydzzmoeualul6mtkovjzwhcxjjy)\n    \nTable 10: ApeComms Operating Fund “OpsFund” breakdown (click to enlarge):\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidpzw3mfrr7mcp5mrjxcdrh3t7owanpmqgthxet6445icgwouawri)\n\nAny ApeComms members who are appointed or elected as Stewards of WG0 will not receive any compensation under this proposal.

We drop digital collectibles - including mint passes, NFTs redeemables, tokens, and more in both fixed physical locations and also spawned automatically around users’ geolocations. The platform serves as a medium for providing easy, fun, and interactive access to digital assets and exposure to Web3 to casual smartphone users.\n \n![2c4a8f680f04c5fb6b4991fd11865d51ccc3095a_2_1035x423 - 1.png](ipfs://bafkreihgfbt4alsg6mjahppi5gkyu45xj5s4avdycaygranorianoag4a4)\n    \nAs BAYC members and Apecoin holders ourselves, we have invested a lot of time and effort into growing out the ecosystem. We have already used our funds to give out over 300 $APE in our beta, and are requesting 500 more a month so we can continue growing the $APE holder base and incentivize engagement within the ApeCoin community. 100% of all ApeCoin granted will be distributed to users through our platform.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\n500 $APE a month; 6,000 for the full year. 100% of which will be distributed to users.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-105-apecoin-drops-in-the-real-world/8159\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

We have talked to thousands of community members, made new friends, and have had an amazing time collaborating with everyone *(more on Cartan’s initial scope of DAO operations and key accomplishments to date in Rationale Section below)*.\n\nWe have worked continuously to match the momentum and keep the workflow moving, which meant taking on additional responsibilities that were not part of the original scope. Ultimately, things needed to be done, so we rolled up our sleeves and delivered, and through operating this way, and listening to the community, we have connected with the nuances of what community members want delivered *(more on expansion of scope of DAO operations and key accomplishments to date in Rationale Section below)*.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nThe community approved fees for the Initial Scope of DAO Operations were US$150,000 per month.\n\nIn order to address the Expanded Scope of DAO Operations, the monthly costs for this AIP is US$250,000 + 20,000 ApeCoin.\n\nThe reason for the split cost (between US$ and ApeCoin) is that we know it is important that we fully align with the community and commit to growing the ApeCoin ecosystem, thereby increasing demand, which is beneficial to all.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-183-cartan-s-proven-track-record-continued-commitment-to-advancing-the-apecoin-ecosystem/9827\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

In such a short period of time we have managed to attract nearly 300 BAYC holders, proving that our community is very strong and eager to integrate.\n\nWe’ve received many positive reviews and amazing feedback from community members, which encouraged us to double down on our efforts and request an ApeCoin DAO grant to accelerate our growth.\n\nOur goal is to unite us, the entire Yuga holders community (BAYC, ApeCoin, MAYC, BAKC, Otherdeed), on one platform giving you the following value:\n\n- Enhanced ApeCoin utility both for signup and in app features\n- New relationships through meeting fellow Apes in your area\n- Feeling welcome in any country worldwide, by meeting Apes while you travel\n- Create business relationships with other Apes across the world\n- Easily organize and attend Ape events\n- Promote projects you are working on and collaborate with other community members on their projects\n\nWe feel that our platform will perfectly complement The Otherside.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nOur operations currently consume on average $88,000 per month. We would like to request funding for the next 9 months of operations at an increased burn rate of $125,000 per month in order to achieve the goals mentioned above.\n\nThis will give us the fuel needed to onboard & satisfy the needs of the Yuga holders community, and explore various means of monetisation to fund future development and maintenance.\n\nSo our total grant request is 225,000 $APE.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-120-apeclub-token-gated-social-network-for-the-yuga-community/8511\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

Therefore, we want to build an Ape ecosystem website named Apeverse to deliver Ape-related information to ApeCoin holders in a timely manner, and to show the development of the Asia-Pacific community to $APE global holders.\n\nApeverse will also bring more utilities to ApeCoin, including payment and membership systems. Our goal is to create a hub for users to view information and interact better with each other through ApeCoin.\n\n#### OVERALL COST\n\nThe future revenue includes the profit from the sales of merchandise and the membership subscription fee. We expect to reach a break-even point after 1 year. We will need starting funds to cover the cost for the first year.\n\n- UI/UX design * 2 people * 2 months = 5,000 * 2 * 2 = 20,000\n- Website front-end development * 3 people * 2 months = 4000 * 3 * 2 = 24,000\n- On-going development and maintenance of the website * 1 person * 10 months = 5,000 * 1 * 10 = 50,000\n- Smart contract development *1 people * 1 months = 7,000 * 1 * 1 = 7,000\n- Smart contract audit = 10,000\n- Website content operations * 1 person * 10 months = 3,000 * 1 * 10 = 30,000\n- Invited writers * 1 articles per month * 10 months = 500 * 1 * 10 = 5,000\n- Marketing campaigns * 1 every 2 months * 10 months = 1000 * 0.5 * 10 = 5,000\n- Derivative product design and physical prototype building = 10,000\n- Others (domain name, server, etc.) = 3,000\n\nTotal: $164,000 for the first year.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-123-apeverse-a-multi-language-web-hub-for-ape-ecosystem-and-ape-holders/8561\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

We have etched out a rough outline of how we believe we will be allocating the funds, along with what we will do with the proceeds. Although our DAO structure will, in time, allow for the voting and direction of some of these funds, our initial budget has the breakdown of the requested funds as follows:\n\n[Funds Requested from Apecoin DAO] [Funds Expected from Supporter NFT]\n\n$420,696.9 Estimated Proceeds $170,000\n\n~$590,696.9\n\nFunds Requested from Apecoin DAO Breakdown (~$420,696.9):\n\n- $380,000 for UNIv3 Deployment Strategy\n- $26,109.41 to pay back Boring Consulting (Feld) for out-of-pocket expenses\n- $13,987.49 Immediate Partnerships and promotion use (Ledger, etc.)\n\nWe plan to reach out to other communities and partners to generate funds from our Supporter NFT (more information on supporter (grid) NFT can be found at https://boringsecurity.murall.art). These funds will be added to UNIv3 and bring the total funds for our deployment strategy to $550,000.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-133-boring-security-for-the-long-haul/8791\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "#### ABSTRACT\n\nAs we near the launch of the ApeCoin staking system outlined in AIP-21 and AIP-22, we propose taking additional measures to ensure the DAO is following smart contract security best practices. This proposal uses treasury assets to fund a 1 million $APE bug bounty program with Immunefi, and partners with Llama to help design, implement, and run operations of these initiatives.\n\nThis proposal would go into effect ahead of staking rewards beginning to accrue with AIP-21. The smart contract for AIP-21 is currently live on testnet so the bug bounty program can go into effect shortly after the AIP passes.\n\nThis proposal will delay staking rewards by roughly 3 weeks. If this proposal passes, staking rewards would begin accruing on 12/7, rather than 11/14. Though the 3 week delay is unfortunate it is vastly preferable to a security breach as a result of not following security best practices. We believe it is very beneficial for the DAO to approve this program.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-134-bug-bounty-program-for-aip-21/8792\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

In order to compete this marketplace must be cost competitive with fees in-line with or lower than competitors like X2Y2.\n\nOur marketplace will host all Yugaverse projects in a single marketplace UI, with dramatically reduced fees, keeping $$ in the BAYC ecosystem and improving the marketplace experience for both buyers and sellers.\n\nWhile we have a lot to share, some notable key features of the marketplace are the following:\n\n- Leveraging @reservoir0x’s open-source, on-chain orderbook to increase openness and composability.\n- Aggregated orders from major marketplaces (OpenSea, LooksRare, X2Y2, Sudoswap, and more) to maintain a strong bridge to the rest of the NFT market.\n- Native sales in $APE with no fees to users buying and selling in $APE.\n- A .5% marketplace fee on $ETH listings and a .25% fee in $APE. .25% of all fees will be sent to a community-held multi-sig wallet on a monthly cadence. The use of funds can then be decided in a separate AIP. (more on why later) The .25% from $ETH will be converted to $APE and sent to the wallet.\n- Development of contextual and ape-specific marketplace functionality, such as integration of key BAYC metadata, relation to the Otherside, and more.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-98-a-community-first-apecoin-dao-marketplace-proposal/8079\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

Even within a bear market, NFT sales/trading continues to be one of the largest crypto-native economies.\n2. Projects should have their own marketplace, and the time is now for Yuga Labs & Otherside Partner NFT collections to have our own.\n3. It is time for a NFT Marketplace to evolve and serve the needs of the larger NFT economy.

The terms of the Foundation’s relationship with the DAO were established on a six-month basis in AIP-1. That six-month period will conclude on September 30, and absent any alternative process for continuing the DAO’s operations, will bring with it the risk that the DAO falls into a vulnerable period during which it lacks actionable operational procedures. This AIP proposes a three-month extension of the terms laid out in AIP-1 to (1) provide time for the development of a proper and thorough Ape Foundation election framework and process; (2) allow the community to better understand and ultimately engage with whatever process emerges; and (3) enable the DAO to continue functioning coherently beyond September 30.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-113-extending-aip-1-the-dao-process/8236\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

The essential feedback was that overall the framework was fine, but lacked the key element of caps.\n\nThis AIP proposes a staking system for ApeCoin and the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT ecosystem: Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC). Staking participants will be able to stake ApeCoin and use the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem NFTs to receive ApeCoin from a preset pool over a set period of time.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-21-staking-process-with-caps-1x-drop-process/5074\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP.
