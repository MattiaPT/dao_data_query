      "content": "*Author* : Fifoooo(11008), PG(4895)\n*Quorum Requirement* : 20% (9M)\n*Vote Duration* : 14 Days\n*Discord thread*: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1294627583299686421\n\n# Intro\nLast 6 / 9 months, I participated to the Battler tournaments, Rarity farming, and played Dropt and SFA a bit.... I think it's too complicated when it came to managing my gotchis and which wearable goes where. What I mean is that it could be easier with some better tools / features.\nEach game requires some optimization in terms of the wearable you use in order to perform properly.\n\nWith all that in mind I think that at least 2 features are actually missing in the ecosystem. \n* A \"save and restore\" system for gotchis. I can save some wearable configurations for a gotchi I own, put a name on each config, and restore my gotchi to that config later on\n* A unified UI where I can see the perks and attributes of my gotchi on each game (Battler, SFA, Dropt, Strategotchi, Gotchi Guardians and more to come).\n\nAt that point I contacted CoderDan, for 2 reasons: \n* First I did not want to start working on this if PC was already working on something similar for the official dapp (they were not indeed).\n* The \"save and restore\" would be a nice addition to the aavegotchi diamond contract. We are a web3 gaming community and I did not see why I would store that data off-chain.\n\nHere is a quick recap of what came out of those discussions:\n* If this proposal is adopted, PC has agreed to let me implement those features directly on the official dapp, based on the mockup and ideas I provided.\n* The features will be tested on Polter and released on Geist directly.\n* Regarding the per-game UI I will also deliver an open-source data schema that will store all in-games specific traits for gotchis and their wearables, for each available game at the moment. The repo will be open sourced. The goal is to streamline the update process (more on that below).\n* Some additions will need to be made on the diamond contract. On that part too PC has agreed that we can submit some PR that they will review. A subgraph that gives easier access to all those datas will also be delivered.\n\nYou will find below more details about each features, then the actual costing of everything.\n\n# Feature details\n## Per-game gotchi details \n### UI & integration.\nThis feature would be added directly into the gotchi detail dialog.\nYou can see in the figma linked below how it could look like (i'm not a UI designer, so you get an idea but final UI will be more polished than that ofc).  \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiapfeqj3afmi5s7qbt5sefts5tsamb7tijb3uxiyszmkxz4tdcbqa)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihpgtx5ewnvxpkhztamvt4uqeuwwiljcgzucuxxwufylthujn34je)\n       \n Full UI preview here:    \nhttps://www.figma.com/design/ArbrjPnDlCgIzcS2in7Rn3/aavegotchi_dapp_per_game_details?node-id=34-95&t=j4Q7aA9EKFHI58G2-1\n\nI will be in charge of the implementation with direct access to the source code provided by PixelCraft.\nThis feature should vastly improve \"quality of life\" of the ecosystem users, as you do not need to switch between multiple sites to see the impact of some wearable on your gotchi, for each games. \nPlus it puts the list of all games in one of the most important page of the dapp. So it's a way to tell newcomers: \"look all the games you can play with your gotchis\". That's why a link to each game will also be added to that page (see in the figma for more details).\n\n### Schema design.\nThere have been some discussions about it before in the Discord but no action taken so far. Basically it's a data structure that can store all the specs and logical rules for each  games separately. There are many advantages having all that information inside a schema instead of raw-coding the whole logic. \n* The schema can be shared and reused in other dapps.\n* A game maker can update the schema by himself when he makes a balance change or release a major version. This insures the schema remains up to date with the game more easily. That way every other dapp that relies on the schema also gets the update.\n* Even if it's not as readable as a wiki that details mecanics, it remains publicly available so games are not black box at all in that regards.\n\nI plan to use [jsonlogic](https://jsonlogic.com) to implement per game schema. This engine allows to describe some logics inside static json files and then share that same logic. Plus this engine is available multiple platforms (Js, Python, C#, java, ruby) which helps when it comes to reusability. \n\nAll the datas in the schema, for all the games, would be stored inside a public github repository that I would set up, including the creation of the initial schema for every game that actually needs it. That way the game makers do not start from scratch when it comes to it, ground work will be done, they will just need to push updates. \n\nThis repository and a first version of the schema for each game is part of what I would like to deliver through this proposal\n\n## \"save and restore\" system for gotchis\n### Description\nThis feature will allow users to store on-chain wearable configs for each game they use to play, then to switch easily from one config to another. On chain storage and a well-thought UI will allow users to make those switches easily. Because storage is on-chain and a subgraph will be also part of the deliverable, other dapps and even games could decide to use those features. Meaning in the future, you could launch an aavegotchi game and switch your gotchi config directly in-game.\nOther way to use this config system could emerge, for example a gotchi config could be shared through a unique url on discord, X, lens, so people can get some inspiration from it.\nAs the community suggested in the DAO thread, each gotchi will be allowed to use 3 free slots to save configs, additional slots will cost a 1GHST fee each, this fee will go to the DAO fund. \n\n### UI & integration\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigwqdk3cei6xghr6dhtz5l4wdel7lfyfcwcjimcp7aosomki6athq)\n        \nFull UI preview here: \nhttps://www.figma.com/design/KPsjwWdAI8jJdGQkMbCYsE/aavegotchi_dapp_dressing?node-id=23-301&t=qsoD5EP4kxRTvAOw-1\n\nThe feature will be accessible from the gotchi equip page of the official dapp. On click it will open a modal where you can: \n* Save the current config if it's not already saved.\n* See the configs you have already saved for that gotchi.\n* Restore a previous config\n\nWhen you ask the dapp to restore a previous config, the dapp will take care of all checks. \n* If at least one wearable is not available anymore on your inventory it will warn you which one(s) and cancel\n* If at least one wearable is already equipped on another gotchi you own it will warn you that this werable is going to be unequip from the other gotchi beforehand. The dapp will take care of all the Tx automatically.\n\n### Smart contract work.\nDan suggested we add a new facet to the aavegotchi diamond, called WearableConfig. We will put all the solidity stuff in there. In addition to that, a \"batchEquip\" function will be added to the \"ItemsFacet\". The goal is that if the dapp needs to undress some gotchis first, then we can do all that in one Tx, which is way better regarding user experience.\n\n### Subgraph. \nIn order to provide an easier and wider access to the configs, a subgraph will be developped in order to expose those new datas.\n\n# Deliverables. \nIf I recap all the part that should be delivered : \n* For the \"Per-game gotchi details\", we have a UI added to the official dapp and an open source schema in a separated demo with a complete first implementation for each game.\n* For the \"save and restore\" system for gotchis, we have also a UI added to the official dapp, additions to the aavegotchi diamond smart contract for on-chain storage and a subgraph for easier access to the datas.\n\n\n# Budget\nI made an estimation of both features in terms of dev time. I will handle all the tasks, except for those 2: \n* @CoderDan offered me that a UI designer from PC helps me by preparing a better UI through Figma.\n* @PG will handle all the solidity aspects. I have worked with him on several occasions and he's way better than me when it comes to Solidity.\n\nWith all that in mind, the overall budget is 19340$. \n* 10700$ for \"backup / restore\" (4900$ for UI, 3600$ for Solidity work, 1200$ for subgraph, 1000$ for tests)\n* 8640$  for the \"per-game\" UI (3240$ for schema setup and initial implementation for SFA, Dropt, Battler and Strategotchi, 4400$ for UI, 1000$ for tests)\n\nI will add to that amount a 15% contingency + bugfix fund, so we add 2900$, to get a grand total of 22240$.\nI have been in development for many many years so I know from experience that things do not always go as planned. I mention that contingency + bugfix fund separately because those additional 15% are kind of a safety reserve and if one month after final release it is not depleted, **I pledge to send back whatever remains to the DAO.**\n\n**I also pledge to post monthly updates stating how the project is going, and if it's still on track in terms of timing and budget.** \n\n# Disbursement. \n* 5000$ in stable on acceptance of the proposal\n* 5000$ one month later.\n* 5000$ 2 months later.\n* 7240$ as a final payment 3 months later.\n\n# Schedule \nIf the proposal is accepted, the goal is to start as soon as possible with the  \"save and restore\" system for gotchis, then the \"Per-game details\". Ideally I would like the development to spread on 2 to 3 months with one feature delivered every 4 to 6 weeks depending on my own workload. \n\n# Conclusion\nI think the fact that PC let the DAO interacts with the official DAPP content through proposal is a unique opportunity we need to take as a community. I hope everyone see as much value as I do in that proposal !\nAs this is a sigprop, discussions are still open in the DAO thread. All comments and suggestions are still welcome.",

      "content": "Author: Zygo (#4743)\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 14 days\nLink to Discord thread: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1277791549505273947\n\n![final_art_screenshot.png](ipfs://bafybeieyxehgcjzgnczdouby7e2xedy5yx4azttujrfd4bu6fxvk3y7iqq)\n    \n\nSummary\n\nThis proposal is for funding another phase of development for Grid Gladiator, a roguelike deck-building grid-based battler based on the assets & lore of the Gotchiverse. Play the (DAO-funded) demo on Itch.io here: https://zygoth.itch.io/grid-gladiator  . \n\nThe long-term goals of the project are:\n\n#1 Create a great roguelike deck-builder, in order to\n #2 increase the exposure of crypto-agnostic & crypto-ignorant gamers to the Aavegotchi ecosystem and\n #3 provide a long-term income stream to the DAO of new users to the ecosystem\n\nGrid Gladiator is targeted towards people who don’t know about Aavegotchi yet and maybe don’t even have a crypto wallet. Rather than try to monetize the (currently) small number of people that both own Aavegotchi assets and want to play minigames with them, this project is designed to appeal to the wider gaming audience and expose them to the Aavegotchi ecosystem and community. Systems within the game and the Grid Gladiator discord server will incentivize players to engage with GHST, the Aavegotchi community, and its games, particularly the Gotchiverse. (See the expanded community meta-progression system section in the design doc here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nBfL2-QKX6tOcclyTZ63pF90lALQ7ZCQU2h1jlniBHI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI am asking for $8000 worth of USDC to fund the development and marketing of the game for a V1 release on Steam in 12 months, plus an Android release soon after.

(see CMP system section here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nBfL2-QKX6tOcclyTZ63pF90lALQ7ZCQU2h1jlniBHI/edit)\n\n\n\nAcknowledge potential risks or unintended consequences\n\nRisk: the game is not finished or is completed poorly\nMitigations: I have a record of completing jam games and larger projects, including the MVP for Grid Gladiator.

I’m Zygo, a game developer that has been involved with Aavegotchi since Haunt 1. I’ve always been interested in making games, and in the last 2 years I’ve been doing it full time. In February of 2024 I released Spellstrife on Steam after 14 months of work (https://store.steampowered.com/app/2385240/Spellstrife/). Since then, I’ve been doing game jams to practice quick development and test out some of my ideas. See my Itch.io page for my game jam games: https://zygoth.itch.io/ .

      "content": "Author: coderdan (1484)\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 10 days\nLink to Discord thread: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1283971443838943244\n\n# Background\nThe GHST DAICO concluded successfully in March 2023, raising 30,000,000 DAI for AavegotchiDAO over a three-year period. \n\nOf this sum, 25% was allocated to Pixelcraft Studios for continued development and marketing of the Aavegotchi gaming protocol. \n\nOver the last 18 months, Pixelcraft Studios has worked diligently to build out products we believe have a strong chance of success in crypto gaming, while also expanding the mindshare and reputation of Aavegotchi in the gaming vertical.\n\nSome major accomplishments during this time period include:\n\n- The development of 3D-compatible Aavegotchis for use in Unity and other 3D engines, as well as the 3D dressing room;\n- The development of Spirit Force Arena and pivot of Gotchiverse2D (built in Phaser) to Gotchiverse3D (built in Unity). \n- The development of Gotchi Guardians, a Unity gaming title for the growing Tower Defense market (estimated 2.3B market size by 2030)\n- The launch of Licky’s Escape puzzler, the first mobile game of Aavegotchi\n- Numerous improvements to the Aavegotchi dapp to offer a beginner-friendly access point to Aavegotchi, while still offering features for power users. \n- Development of the Aavegotchi Gaming profile and integrations into SFA and Gotchi Guardians\n- Research and development on Gotchichain, now announced as Geist\n- Production of a soon-to-be published sidescroller that also delivers open-source game-ready sprites for all Aavegotchis and wearables\n- Numerous IRL events and activations, augmented by the Gotchi Greetooors program\n- DAO-specific tasks, such as Rarity Farming, Wearable updates, and Snapshot maintenance\n\n\nNow, after this period of extended development, we are ready to begin enacting our Geist-centric go-to-market strategy: “Fun games, good rewards, members-only”. \n\n# Sustainability is our goal  \nThe goal of Pixelcraft Studios is to build out a sustainable gaming business that ensures AavegotchiDAO and Pixelcraft Studios are well-funded and can continue to thrive as crypto gaming goes mainstream. Big players like Epic Games, Sony, and Ubisoft are all warming to Web3 gaming –  leading indicators that the industry is about to experience exponential growth. We believe Aavegotchi is perfectly placed to benefit. \n\nPixelcraft Studio’s burn rate over the last 24 months has averaged around $350,000/month, which covers salaries for our team of ~30, subscriptions, infrastructure costs, and other expenses such as audits, legal, or other billing. We still hold a significant balance of GHST, but our runway in stables/bluechips is running low.\n\n\n\n\nOn the DAO side, informed members know that Rarity Farming in its current form is not sustainable unless AavegotchiDAO is able to re-fill its coffers with GHST rewards.\n\n**Therefore, it is our aim in 2025 to make Pixelcraft Studios net revenue-positive, while also contributing funds back to AavegotchiDAO where it can distribute them as it chooses.**\n\nImportantly, we want to earn these funds in sustainable ways that do not dilute the assets of existing NFT holders. \n\nIn 2025, we anticipate multiple revenue sources, both recurring and one-time, coming online for both AavegotchiDAO and Pixelcraft Studios:\n\n## Recurring Revenue Streams\n- **Geist membership fees.** It is our goal to grow the membership base of Geist to at least 10,000 throughout 2025. With memberships costing roughly 19 GHST per month (or 99 GHST for annual membership), this would bring in 100,000-190,000 GHST per month, with a revenue share for AavegotchiDAO. \n- **In-game purchases.** Gotchi Guardians, our flagship mass-market game, will soon be integrating a native Shop where players can purchase skins and power-ups to enhance their gaming experience. \n- **Lootbox Keys.** A core component of the Aavegotchi Gaming Console is lootboxes that are distributed to players playing Aavegotchi games. Lootboxes are generally free, but opening them requires a Key, which will be purchasable using fiat or GHST in the Aavegotchi Gaming Console. \n- **Marketplace Trading Fees.** With more assets and more players, trading fees in the Baazaar will likely increase.\n- **Merch sales.** We are building a new Merch shop from scratch that will support print-on-demand items, native crypto payments, and PoS payments. \n\n## One-time Sales\n- **Glitch Pack Sale.** Envisioned as the ultimate booster pack for Aavegotchi games, the Glitch Pack will contain a variety of lootbox keys, as well as one “Glitch Key” – a special key that always gives the rarest item in a given lootbox. We are aiming for a max quantity of 5000-10,000 packs, with some airdropped and some sold for GHST or ETH. \n\n\n\nWith proper marketing and live-ops, we believe that these revenue streams combined can generate enough revenue to make Pixelcraft Studios revenue-positive, while also generating significant cashflow back to AavegotchiDAO. \n\n# Marketing Begins\nUp til now, Pixelcraft Studios has been fairly light on marketing Aavegotchi and our gaming products, preferring to wait until our product line is more mature. \n\nNow, with the upcoming launch of Geist, multiple Aavegotchi titles nearing readiness with built-in monetization, and big reward campaigns being planned, we are ready to get out there and spread the good Gotchi gospel around the world. \n\nSome major beats we are planning over the next year include:\n- At least one Coinbase quest to raise awareness of Geist and the Aavegotchi Gaming Console to high-quality Coinbase users. \n- A major play-to-airdrop campaign for all eligible games on Geist. \n- Strategic, targeted Invite giveaways to partner communities and projects.\n- Targeted campaigns with Youtubers to create long-tail funnels into our ecosystem.\n- Increased IRL presence in US, EU, and APAC regions.\n\nMany of these initiatives are already underway and just waiting for a catalyst to move forward. The launch of Geist, in combination with Gotchiverse, Gotchi Guardians, Dropt, and other accessible community games, will be that catalyst. \n\n# Thank you for your support\nWe would like to have a moment to express our deep gratitude to AavegotchiDAO for believing in Pixelcraft Studios’ vision of an interoperable gaming protocol, and supporting our journey over the past four years. \n\nAlthough these four years have been exciting, we strongly believe that the best years of Aavegotchi are still ahead of us. We are ready to come out of “ghost mode” and show the world how a truly native Web3 gaming community operates! \n\n# Our Ask\nWe are requesting $3,000,000, paid in USDC, distributed in two equal tranches: the first upon the successful passing of this proposal, and the second after the launch of Geist Mainnet (as determined by block explorer being functional). \n\nThe source of these funds is the Treasury wallet. For each tranche, Directors will need to withdraw 1.5M USDC from Aave. The funds should be transferred to 0x86cEee5D55AE2670c94A6005aD4a3890A1885Cfc on Ethereum Mainnet. \n\n*[Note, the SigProp originally specified Polygon Mainnet, but Ethereum Mainnet is correct].*\n\nIn return, we are committed to returning 20% of all of Pixelcraft’s gross revenue back to AavegotchiDAO until the DAO has earned $13M in revenue (including the $3M initially paid), or until the DAO votes to end this revenue sharing agreement.\n\nThese sources of income include Geist membership fees, in-game purchases, Lootbox key purchases, and any other revenue generated through our games. \n\n**As an additional level of security, we also commit to transferring the ownership of the Aavegotchi IP to AavegotchiDAO in the event that Pixelcraft Studios is unable to continue operation.** \n\n\n# Conclusion\nThank you for your continued support as we enter this new, exciting phase of the Aavegotchi project together!\n\nPixelcraft Studios team \n![revenue.png](ipfs://bafkreidgnuhcb3zvt2kxl2dt2apc2uq7bdtgv2boaoajrlrjnqd274sbgy)\n     \n![expenses.png](ipfs://bafkreiecjfopdscpbcos67izd7rw7zjfklsk6h3awmd46r2hh6sk464daq)",

      "title": "Funding Renewal Proposal for Pixelcraft Studios, 2024-2025",
      "content": "Author: coderdan (1484)\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 10 days\nLink to Discord thread: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1283971443838943244\n\n# Background\nThe GHST DAICO concluded successfully in March 2023, raising 30,000,000 DAI for AavegotchiDAO over a three-year period. \n\nOf this sum, 25% was allocated to Pixelcraft Studios for continued development and marketing of the Aavegotchi gaming protocol. \n\nOver the last 18 months, Pixelcraft Studios has worked diligently to build out products we believe have a strong chance of success in crypto gaming, while also expanding the mindshare and reputation of Aavegotchi in the gaming vertical.\n\nSome major accomplishments during this time period include:\n\n- The development of 3D-compatible Aavegotchis for use in Unity and other 3D engines, as well as the 3D dressing room;\n- The development of Spirit Force Arena and pivot of Gotchiverse2D (built in Phaser) to Gotchiverse3D (built in Unity). \n- The development of Gotchi Guardians, a Unity gaming title for the growing Tower Defense market (estimated 2.3B market size by 2030)\n- The launch of Licky’s Escape puzzler, the first mobile game of Aavegotchi\n- Numerous improvements to the Aavegotchi dapp to offer a beginner-friendly access point to Aavegotchi, while still offering features for power users. \n- Development of the Aavegotchi Gaming profile and integrations into SFA and Gotchi Guardians\n- Research and development on Gotchichain, now announced as Geist\n- Production of a soon-to-be published sidescroller that also delivers open-source game-ready sprites for all Aavegotchis and wearables\n- Numerous IRL events and activations, augmented by the Gotchi Greetooors program\n- DAO-specific tasks, such as Rarity Farming, Wearable updates, and Snapshot maintenance\n\n\nNow, after this period of extended development, we are ready to begin enacting our Geist-centric go-to-market strategy: “Fun games, good rewards, members-only”. \n\n# Sustainability is our goal  \nThe goal of Pixelcraft Studios is to build out a sustainable gaming business that ensures AavegotchiDAO and Pixelcraft Studios are well-funded and can continue to thrive as crypto gaming goes mainstream. Big players like Epic Games, Sony, and Ubisoft are all warming to Web3 gaming –  leading indicators that the industry is about to experience exponential growth. We believe Aavegotchi is perfectly placed to benefit. \n\nPixelcraft Studio’s burn rate over the last 24 months has averaged around $350,000/month, which covers salaries for our team of ~30, subscriptions, infrastructure costs, and other expenses such as audits, legal, or other billing. We still hold a significant balance of GHST, but our runway in stables/bluechips is running low.\n\n\n\n\nOn the DAO side, informed members know that Rarity Farming in its current form is not sustainable unless AavegotchiDAO is able to re-fill its coffers with GHST rewards.\n\n**Therefore, it is our aim in 2025 to make Pixelcraft Studios net revenue-positive, while also contributing funds back to AavegotchiDAO where it can distribute them as it chooses.**\n\nImportantly, we want to earn these funds in sustainable ways that do not dilute the assets of existing NFT holders. \n\nIn 2025, we anticipate multiple revenue sources, both recurring and one-time, coming online for both AavegotchiDAO and Pixelcraft Studios:\n\n## Recurring Revenue Streams\n- **Geist membership fees.** It is our goal to grow the membership base of Geist to at least 10,000 throughout 2025. With memberships costing roughly 19 GHST per month (or 99 GHST for annual membership), this would bring in 100,000-190,000 GHST per month, with a revenue share for AavegotchiDAO. \n- **In-game purchases.** Gotchi Guardians, our flagship mass-market game, will soon be integrating a native Shop where players can purchase skins and power-ups to enhance their gaming experience. \n- **Lootbox Keys.** A core component of the Aavegotchi Gaming Console is lootboxes that are distributed to players playing Aavegotchi games. Lootboxes are generally free, but opening them requires a Key, which will be purchasable using fiat or GHST in the Aavegotchi Gaming Console. \n- **Marketplace Trading Fees.** With more assets and more players, trading fees in the Baazaar will likely increase.\n- **Merch sales.** We are building a new Merch shop from scratch that will support print-on-demand items, native crypto payments, and PoS payments. \n\n## One-time Sales\n- **Glitch Pack Sale.** Envisioned as the ultimate booster pack for Aavegotchi games, the Glitch Pack will contain a variety of lootbox keys, as well as one “Glitch Key” – a special key that always gives the rarest item in a given lootbox. We are aiming for a max quantity of 5000-10,000 packs, with some airdropped and some sold for GHST or ETH. \n\n\n\nWith proper marketing and live-ops, we believe that these revenue streams combined can generate enough revenue to make Pixelcraft Studios revenue-positive, while also generating significant cashflow back to AavegotchiDAO. \n\n# Marketing Begins\nUp til now, Pixelcraft Studios has been fairly light on marketing Aavegotchi and our gaming products, preferring to wait until our product line is more mature. \n\nNow, with the upcoming launch of Geist, multiple Aavegotchi titles nearing readiness with built-in monetization, and big reward campaigns being planned, we are ready to get out there and spread the good Gotchi gospel around the world. \n\nSome major beats we are planning over the next year include:\n- At least one Coinbase quest to raise awareness of Geist and the Aavegotchi Gaming Console to high-quality Coinbase users. \n- A major play-to-airdrop campaign for all eligible games on Geist. \n- Strategic, targeted Invite giveaways to partner communities and projects.\n- Targeted campaigns with Youtubers to create long-tail funnels into our ecosystem.\n- Increased IRL presence in US, EU, and APAC regions.\n\nMany of these initiatives are already underway and just waiting for a catalyst to move forward. The launch of Geist, in combination with Gotchiverse, Gotchi Guardians, Dropt, and other accessible community games, will be that catalyst. \n\n# Thank you for your support\nWe would like to have a moment to express our deep gratitude to AavegotchiDAO for believing in Pixelcraft Studios’ vision of an interoperable gaming protocol, and supporting our journey over the past four years. \n\nAlthough these four years have been exciting, we strongly believe that the best years of Aavegotchi are still ahead of us. We are ready to come out of “ghost mode” and show the world how a truly native Web3 gaming community operates! \n\n# Our Ask\nWe are requesting $3,000,000, paid in USDC, distributed in two equal tranches: the first upon the successful passing of this proposal, and the second after the launch of Geist Mainnet (as determined by block explorer being functional). \n\nThe source of these funds is the Treasury wallet. For each tranche, Directors will need to withdraw 1.5M USDC from Aave. The funds should be transferred to 0x86cEee5D55AE2670c94A6005aD4a3890A1885Cfc on Polygon Mainnet.\n\nIn return, we are committed to returning 20% of all of Pixelcraft’s gross revenue back to AavegotchiDAO until the DAO has earned $13M in revenue (including the $3M initially paid), or until the DAO votes to end this revenue sharing agreement.\n\nThese sources of income include Geist membership fees, in-game purchases, Lootbox key purchases, and any other revenue generated through our games. \n\n**As an additional level of security, we also commit to transferring the ownership of the Aavegotchi IP to AavegotchiDAO in the event that Pixelcraft Studios is unable to continue operation.** \n\n\n# Conclusion\nThank you for your continued support as we enter this new, exciting phase of the Aavegotchi project together!\n\nPixelcraft Studios team \n![revenue.png](ipfs://bafkreidgnuhcb3zvt2kxl2dt2apc2uq7bdtgv2boaoajrlrjnqd274sbgy)\n     \n![expenses.png](ipfs://bafkreiecjfopdscpbcos67izd7rw7zjfklsk6h3awmd46r2hh6sk464daq)",

      "content": "Author: Zygo (#4743)\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 14 days\nLink to Discord thread: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1277791549505273947\n\n![final_art_screenshot.png](ipfs://bafybeieyxehgcjzgnczdouby7e2xedy5yx4azttujrfd4bu6fxvk3y7iqq)\n    \n\nSummary\n\nThis proposal is for funding another phase of development for Grid Gladiator, a roguelike deck-building grid-based battler based on the assets & lore of the Gotchiverse. Play the (DAO-funded) demo on Itch.io here: https://zygoth.itch.io/grid-gladiator  . \n\nThe long-term goals of the project are:\n\n#1 Create a great roguelike deck-builder, in order to\n #2 increase the exposure of crypto-agnostic & crypto-ignorant gamers to the Aavegotchi ecosystem and\n #3 provide a long-term income stream to the DAO of both cash and new users to the ecosystem\n\nGrid Gladiator is targeted towards people who don’t know about Aavegotchi yet and maybe don’t even have a crypto wallet. Rather than try to monetize the (currently) small number of people that both own Aavegotchi assets and want to play minigames with them, this project is designed to appeal to the wider gaming audience and expose them to the Aavegotchi ecosystem and community. Systems within the game and the Grid Gladiator discord server will incentivize players to engage with GHST, the Aavegotchi community, and its games, particularly the Gotchiverse. (See the expanded community meta-progression system section in the design doc here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nBfL2-QKX6tOcclyTZ63pF90lALQ7ZCQU2h1jlniBHI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI am asking for $62,000 worth of DAI to fund the development and marketing of the game for a V1 release on Steam in 12 months, plus an Android release soon after. This is planned to be the last proposal for funding; after release, development will be funded by the game’s monetization system. The game will start making income for the DAO even during the first year of development, with an estimated break-even point of 4-5 years.\n\n\nTimeline (12 months)\n\nOctober-January Milestones:\n\n    Create Discord voting/proposal system & schedule for the whole year (1 month)\n\tPost Steam store page & demo to begin collecting wishlists (1 week)\n\tAdd cross-promotion link within Spellstrife to wishlist Grid Gladiator (1 day)\n\tImproved enemy pathfinding (½ week)\n\t3 act structure with 3 bosses (2 weeks)\n\tMore & improved enemies for south beach biome (2 weeks)\n\tRelics system & starting amount of relics [5 boss 15 normal] (3 weeks)\n\tBattlefield Map system (2 weeks)\n\nFebruary-April Milestones\n\n\tTerrain system (1 week)\n\t44 cards for Radar Gotchi, bringing total to 75 (3 weeks)\n\t2 new biomes (2 weeks)\n\t6 new bosses (2 weeks)\n\tNew enemies for the new biomes (3 weeks)\n\nMay-JulyMilestones\n\n\tOverworld Map system (3 weeks)\n\t2nd playable character, set determined by Discord vote (1 week)\n\t75 cards for new character (4 weeks)\n\tExpanded CMP system (2 weeks)\n\tPay for gameplay trailer creation, update store page assets (1 week)\n\tParticipate in June Steam Next Fest (1 week)\n\nAugust-September Milestones\n\n\tImplement the community’s character & cards (1 month)\n\tSponsor at least 5 streamers to play the game on stream (1 week)\n\tBug-fixing, balancing, polish, testing (3 weeks)\n\tSteam release!\n\n\nKey performance indicators\n\nBefore release:\n\n\tSteam wishlists\n\tSteam demo plays, and average playtime\n\tItch.io beta version daily plays & donations\n\nAfter release:\n\n\tSteam unique & daily players\n\tDonations\n\tCMP tasks completed, especially trying out Gotchiverse and joining Aavegotchi discord\n    GHST used in community development system\n\tGrid Gladiator discord # of members\n\nEffect\n\nSee below for the simplified funds breakdown and payment milestones. Detailed funds breakdown here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fp98Iy3vL8_KHgMB9JfGVNbsPnSZIe7At9CxUFcs32E/edit\n\nFunds\n\nArtwork\n$8,000\n\nMusic\n$4,000\n\nSFX\n$2,000\n\nProgramming\n$42,000\n\nMarketing\n$6000\n\n\nPayment milestones\n\nInitial Payment (just after core prop succeeds)\n$14,000\nMilestone 1 (February 1, 2025)\n$12,000\nMilestone 2 (May 1, 2025)\n$12,000\nMilestone 3 (August 1, 2025)\n$12,000\nMilestone 4 (October 1, 2025)\n$12,000\n\n\n\nCompleting this proposal will provide the following benefits:\n\nCreate a finished free-to-play game in a popular genre that can appeal to non-crypto gamers, released on Steam and mobile.\n\nCreate a GHST sink that incentivizes non-crypto users to buy and use it.\n\nInclude systems that incentivize players to join the Aavegotchi ecosystem, or donate directly. (see CMP system section here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nBfL2-QKX6tOcclyTZ63pF90lALQ7ZCQU2h1jlniBHI/edit)\n\nProvide income to the DAO, see projections here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1szDl_S-DXiwZ0zAGPS4jFLcCqqG0qD7jBUJXqzEIcTM/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\nAcknowledge potential risks or unintended consequences\n\nRisk: the game is not finished or is completed poorly\nMitigations: I have a record of completing jam games and larger projects, including the MVP for Grid Gladiator. The payments are mostly milestone-based, which means the DAO can confirm the work has been done before paying.\n\nAny alternative paths (Plan B, Plan C, etc)\nN/A\n \nAbout Me\n\nHi! I’m Zygo, a game developer that has been involved with Aavegotchi since Haunt 1. I’ve always been interested in making games, and in the last 2 years I’ve been doing it full time. In February of 2024 I released Spellstrife on Steam after 14 months of work (https://store.steampowered.com/app/2385240/Spellstrife/). Since then, I’ve been doing game jams to practice quick development and test out some of my ideas. See my Itch.io page for my game jam games: https://zygoth.itch.io/ . I’m most familiar with the Phaser3 engine.",

      "title": "Coinzilla x Aavegotchi - Creating a Marketing Budget",
      "content": "Author: Flamevipers (7885)\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 14 days\nLink to Discord thread: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1257084090021056582/1257084090021056582\n\nThis proposal aims to CREATE and DEDICATE a marketing budget if PC or the DAO are ever READY to promote Aavegotchi. The ads should synchronize with an Aavegotchi event which a widespread amount of newcomers could get onboarded into. This marketing budget is for promoting Aavegotchi through ads on various websites such as Dextools and Etherscan among many other webpages for 45 days.\n\n“To empower players to own, build, grow, and connect in a multiverse of their own creation.”\n![bafkreiay7oq6pww3dwiunysuws6pkzqllrhvxq6elwqqolwnvde4zgv4ia (1).png](ipfs://bafkreiay7oq6pww3dwiunysuws6pkzqllrhvxq6elwqqolwnvde4zgv4ia)\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/0xc4a9034b518ae0ba34181e3f835fa1f525efbf9bc1172b2cdd3fac7bfda5599e\nhttps://medium.com/@mootcat1/aavegotchi-index-guide-afa2ced708c5\n\nThe ads will send people to this link;\nhttps://docs.aavegotchi.com\n\n45 days ad duration\nMobile & PC\nSponsored + Native\n\nDextools \nEtherscan/ Bsc/ Sol \nBlockchain \nNative campaign \nPremium general campaign includes all these websites:\nhttps://docs.coinzilla.com/premium-websites.pdf\n\nCoinzilla will be in charge of creating the banners for Aavegotchi.\nCoinzilla have been provided the Press kit & brand guideline:\nhttps://dapp.aavegotchi.com/press-kit\n\n\nCoinzilla will enable global geo location for 1 week then disable global accordingly to optimize the CPM. \nThe APPROXIMATE price is € 20k Euros // $ 22k USDCs\nPlus a few more websites such as Reddit and 4chan will be advertised on.\nSo the final price will be 27K USDCs(Polygon) to make sure it fits within budget. Any remaining budget must be sent back in USDC(Polygon) to the address either through another proposal or direct transfer and announced beforehand. \nThe funds will be sent to either a dedicated marketing wallet made by Maxicrouton or someone else who handles signing treasury txs.\nIf Maxicrouton does not accept in 30 days from proposal to end of core proposal the responsibility of holding a separate marketing funds wallet or address then the funds will be sent to a separate address owned by Flamevipers who will hold the responsibility of keeping them safe and not use them until the time comes.\n0x7DF893cc18597A431F6E6375b94BCB02D2096e04\n\nThe funds will not be used until Geist network is primed and ready for release Or any other prime event that newcomers would feel attracted towards to., but will instead be kept in standby ready to be used only requiring 1 user and 1 transaction instead of 9 transaction taxes for confirmation. \nThe funds will not be used until a website with all the statistics trackers and all the onboarding information for contributers and content creators and gamers has been finalized. The website must either be part of the DAO or part of Pixelcraft Studios.\nhttps://docs.aavegotchi.com/\nhttps://docs.aavegotchi.com/gaming/live-games\n\nOptionally we will pair this marketing ad campaign with a content creationg & POAP rewards quest campaigns such as GALXE with Aagent Missions and similar contributions.\nThe final asking price will be 27K USDCs (Polygon) +150 USDC\nAn extra $150 USDC will be sent to the below address for listing the GHST token on 25 websites.\n0xDe34393312C0C1e97e404d18A04580E9610e063C\n\nWhen converting GHST to USDC and then to Euro, GHST must not be under 90 USD cents.",

Six Games in One:** This project includes six hybridized elements combined into a single game. The sequel will separate and polish these elements into distinct games.\n**2. Supporting Aavegotchi Land Owners: **\nThe project focuses on raising the value of Aavegotchi land parcels and decorations, providing gameplay usecase for landowners.\n**3. New Tournament Reward System:**\nAn asset-based reward system without affecting gameplay.\n**4. Original Aavegotchi Member:**\nThe lead director for being an Aavegotchi member will utilize a portion of his own funds to be reinvested into Aavegotchi assets, supporting the ecosystem and community.\n**5. 2D Graphics SDK:**\nThe game features squid-themed Lickquidators and ghost Aavegotchis. This 2D Graphics SDK will be utilized for future game development and future gamejams.\n**6. Extensive Music Library:**\nThe game will feature 100 vocal songs and 100 instrumental songs, offering a total of 200 songs for its 100+ levels. \nSound Gallery confirmed.\n**7. Android touchscreen support**\n**8. Epic Games market release. Itch.io release and possible Steam release**\n**9. Tetrisgotchi game bonus.**\n\n****With just 14k USDC in funding some of these features will be affected namely the 2D Graphics SDK, Steam release, leaderboard security.****\nSound gallery and graphics swapping system will be available in the final demo.\n\n\nI will make a functional demo where I will host a XP tournament where 1 gotchi = XP per gotchi, with potential for extra rewards for the top 10 players such as wearables, FAKEs, behind the scenes information, etc.\n\n\n**Web3 ownership detailed // Monetization:**\nFirst iteration;\nIn order to compete for rewards newcomers must buy aavegotchi assets.\nI’m separating the tournament rewards based on how many assets a player owns.\nNot in the XP tournament demo.\n\nFAKE NFT release which will act as a key to get past the first requirements.\nPremium NFT with 15 editions meant for the community. (They unlock all 3 ranks of tournaments)\nPossibility for the demo.\n\nI will utilize land parcels near landmarks and 28Kek Spacious Parcels to give knowledge+experience bonuses such as unlocking a boss practice mode early on. As well as give 28Kek Spacious Parcel owners availability to the final game 1 week before the tournament begins for a whole 7 days of practicing. This indirectly impacts the game without affecting the gameplay.\nPossible, but need to talk to UserDefault to make an updated Aavegotchi gaming web3 kit.\n\n**Arcade tokens monetization**\nYou will only get extra lives/resets if you pay alchemica. I will utilize alchemica instead of GHST to create alchemica sinks and further help landowners.\nNot guaranteed for demo, but will try.\n\nFunding Request \nWe are seeking a total grant request of $14000 USDC.\n\nFunding disbursement\n100% of funds upon core proposal passing \n$14000 USDC sent to address\n0xDe34393312C0C1e97e404d18A04580E9610e063C\n\nApproximate completion date: 4 months \nPossibility to finish earlier; yes\n\nOtherwise 50% every 4 months will extend the deadline to 8 months+ as I have to first get the programming side done before I get the graphics side done. They'd have to wait on each other.\n\n![IMG_2182.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreihv4oa74iyxylhxlecfpo7mjgqqiz4rrucq2r623pyg2k64unfluy)\n     \n![IMG_2181.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreiappvdi6u4pn5fp2lb7h4vzpjrrcxejltriz5v7s23tg4fdoanlma)\n     \n![IMG_2180.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreia4nxjivmenwu3vwr7wk5pywh5g3iluprtyidrwr2tahlyjjcdf2a)\n     \n![IMG_2169.jpg](ipfs://bafkreib35ddpnpkppudzhbdmuijxwcrrv6u6a3qyzrrjxrxamjmqfebv54)\n     \n![IMG_2170.jpg](ipfs://bafkreid6o76lobcxwmvp2c4ffjdejwiv46vr2kzy3muiqpykemdyvmjwsi)\n     \n![IMG_2171.jpg](ipfs://bafkreig5rvarh4slpg7kgezsi6rghvrkxyoqjohtiwbivpku3d7ibdmc2y)\n     \n![IMG_2173.jpg](ipfs://bafybeihzpeokt3nzegci3cxo2jzg4xurrews22s4at6p3jf2l7l24vzoe4)\nSound Gallery will enable the average user to change music & SFX with his own package, all in-game and saved after closing the game.

Mastering those 3 is the secret to achieving a high score.\nGotchi 1 - The combat gotchi. He wields all your weapons and is the bread and butter of dealing with the Lickquidators. With a variety of weapons and upgrades to increase your damage he fends off the enemies.\nGotchi 2 - The Income gotchi. His purpose is to collect the fallen Ethereum from the Lickquidators. With upgrades that will allow him to strive away from this support role and give the player more offensive options to play with.\nGotchi 3 - The Support gotchi. Sometimes you need a way to freeze and slow the enemy, not just damage. With upgrades revolving around freeze duration and slow amount.\n\nOutside of the 3 playable characters you will have NPCs' helping you out.\nCitizens, they act as mini-combat gotchis, throwing fireballs from inside the Citaadel.\nWarrior Gotchis - Their purpose is to stop the Lickquidators in their tracks, stopping their movement once they get too close to the walls, fighting to the bitter end.\nThe shopkeeper is here to give you helpful tips and fun facts, morale is an important thing, as is his shop full of upgrades.\nIn Defense of Aave - Arcade your objective is to achieve as high of a highscore as possible. Outside of just getting to the highest level possible, you can control the difficulty by spending your Ethereum to increase the amount of enemies that spawn every night. This fine balance of how many enemies you can handle should allow you come up with plenty of strategies to achieve the highest of scores!\nWhile the amount of enemies doesn't increase naturally each level, their difficulty does. Having increasingly more health, and more Elite enemies replacing normal ones. So time is of the essence. \n![Defense of Aave possible game icon.png](ipfs://bafybeibjeypslbe3xtmyeuykhm3szepxsznubdnttuq4fs2sp4szzeyc7a)\n    \n\n![image2 (1).png](ipfs://bafybeicdlwdyvxwxqp53dxswhc2kkarnzdejkbv5mwbu5sanlxzngubooy)\n\n![image5 (1).png](ipfs://bafybeidp37vcu4tpwnkcqpxcnn437ipelnwzyr6fpy4zi4vd4kvpkwboji)\n    \n![image4 (1).png](ipfs://bafybeifon3yswcxva4mguzwpdii3muw55ozcs2jvvmap57qmx3sxdjo2la)\n     \n![image6optional.PNG](ipfs://bafkreie4qkdpgee2iazk6l5p5afxizxljtewpkl6iu5mxujupckzgigkwy)\n     \n![image7optional.PNG](ipfs://bafkreica7vmke52ugotkutmolqly7oc3afgart2gl2jp3xoefamdha2lda)\n\n![image3.PNG](ipfs://bafybeihqpthsswu6gjg2rnyhipffrunjbsnjjgchpw7kkyuq3yiez32jwa)\n\n![Tiny Licks.PNG](ipfs://bafybeibs7iqtyuc7amvtqa4yvacdgaohpop4cbwi3svibd6tsjwa6c2fuq)\n\n![Bomb Enemies.PNG](ipfs://bafybeidllndyr5j66p3sfmnm3rvfd6egu5g7jhrr7m64e4gqcfqv7kchka)\n\n****Investment Highlights:****\n**1.

      "content": "Author: Oliver Spoon, Fifoooo, PG \nGotchiID: 4858, 4895, 11008\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 10 days\n\nDiscussion: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1110591248269582468\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeiepehd2ca2umykeshs7nri5md3jrow3bv4roo4gfiftzqtyouqgyu)\n    \nGm everyone, \n\nToday I present the first ever DAO Forge Competition. For the pilot season, we will keep it simple with a single snapshot capturing the Top 100 gotchis by smithing XP. \n\nThe current leaderboard is here: \nhttps://wearables.report/smithing-skill.html\n\n## The high level points:\n\n* A single snapshot will capture the leaderboard \n* Top 100 gotchis by smithing xp will be awarded prizes\n* Prizes will be airdropped to the gotchi owner’s wallet (rented gotchis will also route prizes to their owners)\n* The snapshot date will be **Saturday, September 7th during the hangout**\n* Prizes will distribute 10% of the total supply from the new schematics release\n* The new schematics are from the community design competition which was held on July 6th, 2024\n\n## The Project\n\nWe will design a designated live-updating leaderboard (the link above is only daily) capable of handling the snapshot for the competition. The site will be designed future-ready to allow for more seasons should we choose to have them. The site will have an admin backend that will allow us to deploy the prize distribution script. \n\n## Prize Structure \n\nPrizes are for individual gotchi smithing xp. \n\nPrize breakdown is as follows:\n\n* Top 100: all new common schematics\n* Top 50: all new uncommon and below schematics\n* Top 25: all new rare and below schematics\n* Top 10: all new legendary and below schematics\n* Top 5: all new mythical and below schematics\n* “And below” means all schematics below the mentioned rarity. Ie: Top 25 will receive all new rare, uncommon, and common schematics\n\nTies: in the unlikely but nonzero chance of a tie that falls across two prize bands, the tie-breaking metric will be based on which gotchi reached that score first. For example, two gotchis each have 420 skill points. Gotchi A achieved that score at block height 50,000,000 and Gotchi B achieved the score at block 52,000,000. Gotchi A would be placed in front of Gotchi B and be the winner of the prizes.\n\n## Purpose of the competition:\n\n* Award the biggest forge users with prizes relevant to their craft\n* Provide a healthy distribution for the upcoming schematics release. Without the competition, all new schematics will go into the geodes, making them very difficult to obtain.\n* Incentivise players to use the forge and burn alloy in the process\n* Provide a fun experience for the community\n\nIf this season goes well, we can add this competition to our ecosystem as a means to distribute future wearables. For subsequent seasons, we could implement more mechanics like delta xp and so on. \n\n## Funding request:\n\nThe total cost of the competition is $5500 USD equivalent paid in stable coins.\n\nCompetition planning and coordination, website design and graphics - $2,000\nOliver Spoon \nWeb development, admin page for distribution, smart contract work, testing, and prize deployment - $3,500 \nFifoooo & PG\n\nUpon successful passing of the proposal, the full sum is to be sent to \n0xa2e3680A18aBAfEff813E8aA67AEfB49bf078C86\nPayment can be made in USDC, DAI, aUSDC, or aDAI on either Polygon or Ethereum network\n \n![Flex-transparent.png](ipfs://bafkreifp44tax37pyxicg37cnlsgreltp4h3zi3loo34fvlnhhrnbid3pi)",

If there are more than one maintainers, the split should be proportional to the number of maintainers (50/50 % if there are two maintainers).\n\nThe total amount asked is 600 GHST x 5 = 3000 of GHST.\n\nDue to the nature of the funding and the small amount, in addition to the long history of involvement in the community, the maintainers will do a best effort maintenance of the website.\nIf there are any issues or fixes to the functionality of the websites, the maintainers will do a best effort to fix the issues, issues that need to be created on their respective Github link issue page or Discord channel (if any), or sent directly to their DMs.\nWe suggest creating a Discord thread in the Aavegotchi channel for support or issues related to the Aavegotchi community apps, as Github requires some knowledge.\n\nThe 5 projects are:\n\n\n> **Verse Analytics - https://verse-analytics.xyz/**\n> \n> Description : Collection of tools and reports, with a focus on lending operations and alchemicas.\n> \n> Time since first deployment: September 2021\n> Uptime link: https://stats.uptimerobot.com/xMwwMImYG6\n> Discord ID: @fifoooo \n> Ethereum address: 0x49F2df1E567e588f3aa2CE63fcCA80a6a0f4C029\n> Issue tracker: https://discord[.]gg/fZVWHMaRqQ\n\n----\n\n> **The big brain API - https://aavegotchi.land**\n> \n> Description: Gotchiverse analytics, wallet asset tracking, rarity farming reward estimation.\n>\n> Time since it was first deployed: March 2021\n> Uptime link: https://stats.uptimerobot.com/pAllDhQYl8/797188784\n> Discord ID: @aavegotch1.eth \n> Ethereum address: 0x47d6f96ba098816389db7c87cbf077de7181b853\n> Issue tracker: https://github.com/lazyprogrammerio/ghst-gg\n> GitHub URL: https://github.com/lazyprogrammerio/ghst-gg\n> Github commit id: https://github.com/lazyprogrammerio/ghst-gg/commit/d4c799e5f7c3c877a3748df68e971da9adf36231\n\n\n----\n\n> **Aadventure - https://www.aadventure.io**\n> \n> Description: realm explorer, historical auctions, historical rarity farming, lending tools, gotchi pockets, wearable sets by gotchi type.\n> \n> Time since it was first deployed: December 2021\n> Uptime link: https://stats.uptimerobot.com/XHXsXlT1Ot\n> Discord ID: `@_eitri_`\n> Ethereum address: 0xaf4fe811ffa1bf1f7de8fdaa9f706487c882aed0\n> Issue tracker: https://github.com/mistaya/aavegotchi/issues\n> GitHub URL: https://github.com/mistaya/aavegotchi/tree/main/realm\n> Github commit id: https://github.com/mistaya/aavegotchi/commit/9b026d8f7f4c2c0096fbed4aa9e94f6e9247cf27\n\n\n----\n\n\n> **Aavegotchi Wearables Report - https://wearables.report**\n> \n> The wearables report dashboard supplies vital metrics regarding the Aavegotchi wearables market.

      "content": "Author: Oliver Spoon, Fifoooo\nGotchiID: 4858, 4895\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 10 days\n\nDiscussion: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1110591248269582468\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeiepehd2ca2umykeshs7nri5md3jrow3bv4roo4gfiftzqtyouqgyu)\n    \n\nGm everyone, \n\nToday I present the first ever DAO Forge Competition. For the pilot season, we will keep it simple with a single snapshot capturing the Top 100 gotchis by smithing XP. \n\nThe current leaderboard is here: \nhttps://wearables.report/smithing-skill.html\n\n## The high level points:\n\n* A single snapshot will capture the leaderboard \n* Top 100 gotchis by smithing xp will be awarded prizes\n* Prizes will be airdropped to the gotchi owner’s wallet (rented gotchis will also route prizes to their owners)\n* The snapshot date will be **Saturday, September 7th during the hangout**\n* Prizes will distribute 10% of the total supply from the new schematics release\n* The new schematics are from the community design competition which was held on July 6th, 2024\n\n## The Project\n\nWe will design a designated live-updating leaderboard (the link above is only daily) capable of handling the snapshot for the competition. The site will be designed future-ready to allow for more seasons should we choose to have them. The site will have an admin backend that will allow us to deploy the prize distribution script. \n\n## Prize Structure \n\nPrizes are for individual gotchi smithing xp. \n\nPrize breakdown is as follows:\n\n* Top 100: all new common schematics\n* Top 50: all new uncommon and below schematics\n* Top 25: all new rare and below schematics\n* Top 10: all new legendary and below schematics\n* Top 5: all new mythical and below schematics\n* “And below” means all schematics below the mentioned rarity. Ie: Top 25 will receive all new rare, uncommon, and common schematics\n\n_Ties: in the unlikely but nonzero chance of a tie that falls across two prize bands, the upper tier prizes for those gotchis will be pooled and distributed at random to them. For example, rank 50 and 51 have the same points. The total prizes would be two each of the common schematics and one each of the uncommon. The pool of uncommon schematics would then be distributed at random to the two gotchis._ \n\n_As this is incredibly unlikely to occur (presently there is only one tie in the top 100 and it is rank 99), the tie breaker RNG would be handled off-chain during the hangout for verification._\n\n## Purpose of the competition:\n\n* Award the biggest forge users with prizes relevant to their craft\n* Provide a healthy distribution for the upcoming schematics release. Without the competition, all new schematics will go into the geodes, making them very difficult to obtain.\n* Incentivise players to use the forge and burn alloy in the process\n* Provide a fun experience for the community\n\nIf this season goes well, we can add this competition to our ecosystem as a means to distribute future wearables. For subsequent seasons, we could implement more mechanics like delta xp and so on. \n\n## Funding request:\n\nThe total cost of the competition is $5500 USD equivalent paid in stable coins.\n\nCompetition planning and coordination, website design and graphics - $2,000\nOliver Spoon \nWeb development, admin page for distribution, smart contract work, testing, and prize deployment - $3,500 \nFifoooo & PG\n\nUpon successful passing of the proposal, the full sum is to be sent to \n0xa2e3680A18aBAfEff813E8aA67AEfB49bf078C86\nPayment can be made in USDC, DAI, aUSDC, or aDAI on either Polygon or Ethereum network\n \n![Flex-transparent.png](ipfs://bafkreifp44tax37pyxicg37cnlsgreltp4h3zi3loo34fvlnhhrnbid3pi)",

      "title": "Octav Onboarding to Track Aavegotchi DAO Treasury ",
      "content": "Author(s): Octav Team (15259)\nQuorum Requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote Duration: 14 days \nXP Reward: 10 XP for each Aavegotchi in voter's wallet\nDiscussion Link: \nhttps://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1264985485512806410\n\n## Summary  \nOctav proposes to provide monthly treasury reconciliation and reporting services for Aavegotchi DAO, offering detailed transparency reports that include key performance indicators (KPIs), wallet positions, and protocol deposits. The service aims to enhance stakeholder awareness through balance reports and revenue inflow information.\n\n## Motivation \nThis initiative addresses the need for enhanced transparency and accountability within Aavegotchi DAO. By providing regular, data-centric reports and the ability to view any transaction performed by the Directors, we aim to keep the community informed about the financial health and strategic decisions of the DAO.\n\n## Specification & Implementation  \nOctav will deliver 12 monthly treasury holdings breakdown reports for Aavegotchi DAO, each analysing key metrics and fundamental treasury data. \n\n### The reports will cover:\n- Key Metrics Report: Total funds, wallet positions, protocol positions, total funds by category, and total funds by network.\n- Wallet Positions Report: Detailed breakdown of all tokens in treasury wallets, including balance, value, percentage, and network.\n- Protocol Positions Report: Detailed breakdown of protocol deposits, including staked amount, yield, protocol, balance, and value.\n- PDF and CSV: The treasury reports will be shared as both a PDF and CSV and can be imported to other dapps/treasury tracking software to enhance compliance.\n\n### Example report\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicohzr7gwqvplhyjbie7vgxxsoyomkzhswycph3fjlz4hwqdfvin4)\n    \n### Aavegotchi Treasury Dashboard and Transaction History\nDAO Directors (or DAO treasurer) will label and reconcile transactions done by the treasury to enhance transparency and accuracy. Holders can view balances and reports at any time.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidj45dnmi2yz4gmho2x2ljgq6k7w5lyakb2m7nqrxhrnr743qvuyy)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidjhw6f3frjlajjrcqibxfgg6ouslz7zoghj6wve6v2d3y6bpy7p4)\n     \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreif3lmgxdfak5snpuqokjcnshmpda3odsnfbqo7zfka44dvz3i224a)\n    \n## Initial Pricing Offer\nThe service is priced at $360 per wallet for a 1-year subscription, covering 10 treasury wallets (9 paid, 1 free) and 12 monthly breakdown reports. The total payment will be $3240. Payment will be made in USDC (Mainnet) to an address specified by the Octav team following approval.\n\n## Onboarding\nThe Aavegotchi DAO treasury wallets are already integrated with Octav, and the first paid report is set to be generated on September 1st, 2024, with August provided free. Octav will collaborate with Aavegotchi DAO monthly to gather feedback and continuously improve the platform’s transparency features.\n\n## Wallets\nLow txs wallets receive a free pro account. This list was chosen in collaboration with Maxicrouton (Aavegotchi DAO Treasurer and Director) to fit the DAO’s needs. \n\n### Paid Pro Addresses\nETH Treasury 0x53c3CA81EA03001a350166D2Cc0fcd9d4c1b7B62\nLiquidity Wallet 0x62DE034b1A69eF853c9d0D8a33D26DF5cF26682E\nRewards Wallet 0x8c8E076Cd7D2A17Ba2a5e5AF7036c2b2B7F790f6\nPolygon Treasury 0x939b67F6F6BE63E09B0258621c5A24eecB92631c\nRarity Farming Baazaar fees 0x27DF5C6dcd360f372e23d5e63645eC0072D0C098\nDAO Baazaar fees + Gotchiverse crafting fees 0xb208f8bb431f580cc4b216826affb128cd1431ab\nBonding Curve fees 0xFFE6280ae4E864D9aF836B562359FD828EcE8020\nGotchiverse Player Rewards 0x48eA1d45142fC645fDcf78C133Ac082eF159Fe14\nATF wallet 0x921D8FDF089775D5AC61b2d6e8f34F1edd554D8f\n### Free Addresses (Low tx count)\nDTF Wallet 0x6fb7e0AAFBa16396Ad6c1046027717bcA25F821f\n\n## Term\nThe term for these services is 1 year, with a renewal option to be discussed at the end of the period.\n## Rationale\nThe proposed reporting service and reconciliation features are designed to provide maximum transparency and accountability for the Aavegotchi DAO treasury. This solution was chosen over others due to Octav’s existing integration with Aavegotchi DAO wallets and our commitment to delivering comprehensive, user-friendly reports that facilitate community engagement and trust.\n\n## Downside (Cons)\nThere are no significant disadvantages anticipated with this proposal. However, there may be minor implementation challenges associated with integrating feedback and ensuring reports meet all stakeholder requirements.\nVoting: A “yes” vote will approve the proposal to implement Octav’s treasury reconciliation and reporting services for Aavegotchi DAO, while a “no” vote will reject it.",

More on the release of the feature here:\n\n\"Consider a contentious vote in which a minority is pushing the poll early in one direction. Voters that don't have a strong opinion already formed might see this and think the outcome is already decided. Thus they'll be discouraged from voting and also from researching/forming an opinion. This could then lead to the vote going in favor of the minority due to voter apathy, which would not be a good outcome, given that the goal of the poll is to represent the majority opinion.\"\nPeople often are unsure what to vote for and look over the neighbour's shoulder to see what he voted, often times trying to vote for the majority regardless of your own opinion.\nMy last proposal has been proven right as it ended at a perfect standstill and nobody decided if to vote yes or no, it became a self-fulfilling prophecy as half the people ironically voted with a weight of 50/50, both yes & no.\n\nThis of course will not fix many other problems such as our feelings. We might vote yes one day and vote no the next for the same proposal. Perhaps we had a good day and a bad day. Perhaps we rushingly voted yes for 5 proposals in a row. Perhaps we really liked the proposal's presentation or we completely forgot about it after some time.\nThis also does not fix the fact most people do not read the proposals, let alone the whitepaper inside of them.\nBut it's a start.",

If there are more than one maintainers, the split should be proportional to the number of maintainers (50/50 % if there are two maintainers).\n\nThe total amount asked is 600 GHST x 5 = 3000 of GHST.\n\nDue to the nature of the funding and the small amount, in addition to the long history of involvement in the community, the maintainers will do a best effort maintenance of the website.\nIf there are any issues or fixes to the functionality of the websites, the maintainers will do a best effort to fix the issues, issues that need to be created on their respective Github link issue page or Discord channel (if any), or sent directly to their DMs.\nWe suggest creating a Discord thread in the Aavegotchi channel for support or issues related to the Aavegotchi community apps, as Github requires some knowledge.\n\nThe 5 projects are:\n\n\n> **Verse Analytics - https://verse-analytics.xyz/**\n> \n> Description : Collection of tools and reports, with a focus on lending operations and alchemicas.\n> \n> Time since first deployment: September 2021\n> Uptime link: https://stats.uptimerobot.com/xMwwMImYG6\n> Discord ID: @fifoooo \n> Ethereum address: 0x49F2df1E567e588f3aa2CE63fcCA80a6a0f4C029\n> Issue tracker: https://discord[.]gg/fZVWHMaRqQ\n\n----\n\n> **The big brain API - https://aavegotchi.land**\n> \n> Description: Gotchiverse analytics, wallet asset tracking, rarity farming reward estimation.\n>\n> Time since it was first deployed: March 2021\n> Uptime link: https://stats.uptimerobot.com/pAllDhQYl8/797188784\n> Discord ID: @aavegotch1.eth \n> Ethereum address: 0x47d6f96ba098816389db7c87cbf077de7181b853\n> Issue tracker: https://github.com/lazyprogrammerio/ghst-gg\n> GitHub URL: https://github.com/lazyprogrammerio/ghst-gg\n> Github commit id: https://github.com/lazyprogrammerio/ghst-gg/commit/d4c799e5f7c3c877a3748df68e971da9adf36231\n\n\n----\n\n> **Aadventure - https://www.aadventure.io**\n> \n> Description: realm explorer, historical auctions, historical rarity farming, lending tools, gotchi pockets, wearable sets by gotchi type.\n> \n> Time since it was first deployed: December 2021\n> Uptime link: https://stats.uptimerobot.com/XHXsXlT1Ot\n> Discord ID: `@_eitri_`\n> Ethereum address: 0xaf4fe811ffa1bf1f7de8fdaa9f706487c882aed0\n> Issue tracker: https://github.com/mistaya/aavegotchi/issues\n> GitHub URL: https://github.com/mistaya/aavegotchi/tree/main/realm\n> Github commit id: https://github.com/mistaya/aavegotchi/commit/9b026d8f7f4c2c0096fbed4aa9e94f6e9247cf27\n\n\n----\n\n\n> **Aavegotchi Wearables Report - https://wearables.report**\n> \n> The wearables report dashboard supplies vital metrics regarding the Aavegotchi wearables market.

Six Games in One:** This project includes six hybridized elements combined into a single game. The sequel will separate and polish these elements into distinct games.\n**2. Supporting Aavegotchi Land Owners: **\nThe project focuses on raising the value of Aavegotchi land parcels and decorations, providing gameplay usecase for landowners.\n**3. New Tournament Reward System:**\nAn asset-based reward system without affecting gameplay.\n**4. Original Aavegotchi Member:**\nThe lead director for being an Aavegotchi member will utilize a portion of his own funds to be reinvested into Aavegotchi assets, supporting the ecosystem and community.\n**5. 2D Graphics SDK:**\nThe game features squid-themed Lickquidators and ghost Aavegotchis. This 2D Graphics SDK will be utilized for future game development and future gamejams.\n**6. Extensive Music Library:**\nThe game will feature 100 vocal songs and 100 instrumental songs, offering a total of 200 songs for its 100+ levels. \n**7. Android touchscreen support**\n**8.

(They unlock all 3 ranks of tournaments)\n\nI will utilize land parcels near landmarks and 28Kek Spacious Parcels to give knowledge+experience bonuses such as unlocking a boss practice mode early on. As well as give 28Kek Spacious Parcel owners availability to the final game 1 week before the tournament begins for a whole 7 days of practicing. This indirectly impacts the game without affecting the gameplay.\n\n**Arcade tokens monetization**\nYou will only get extra lives/resets if you pay alchemica.

Mastering those 3 is the secret to achieving a high score.\nGotchi 1 - The combat gotchi. He wields all your weapons and is the bread and butter of dealing with the Lickquidators. With a variety of weapons and upgrades to increase your damage he fends off the enemies.\nGotchi 2 - The Income gotchi. His purpose is to collect the fallen Ethereum from the Lickquidators. With upgrades that will allow him to strive away from this support role and give the player more offensive options to play with.\nGotchi 3 - The Support gotchi. Sometimes you need a way to freeze and slow the enemy, not just damage. With upgrades revolving around freeze duration and slow amount.\n\nOutside of the 3 playable characters you will have NPCs' helping you out.\nCitizens, they act as mini-combat gotchis, throwing fireballs from inside the Citaadel.\nWarrior Gotchis - Their purpose is to stop the Lickquidators in their tracks, stopping their movement once they get too close to the walls, fighting to the bitter end.\nThe shopkeeper is here to give you helpful tips and fun facts, morale is an important thing, as is his shop full of upgrades.\nIn Defense of Aave - Arcade your objective is to achieve as high of a highscore as possible. Outside of just getting to the highest level possible, you can control the difficulty by spending your Ethereum to increase the amount of enemies that spawn every night. This fine balance of how many enemies you can handle should allow you come up with plenty of strategies to achieve the highest of scores!\nWhile the amount of enemies doesn't increase naturally each level, their difficulty does. Having increasingly more health, and more Elite enemies replacing normal ones. So time is of the essence.\n\n![image2 (1).png](ipfs://bafybeicdlwdyvxwxqp53dxswhc2kkarnzdejkbv5mwbu5sanlxzngubooy)\n\n![image5 (1).png](ipfs://bafybeidp37vcu4tpwnkcqpxcnn437ipelnwzyr6fpy4zi4vd4kvpkwboji)\n    \n![image4 (1).png](ipfs://bafybeifon3yswcxva4mguzwpdii3muw55ozcs2jvvmap57qmx3sxdjo2la)\n     \n![image6optional.PNG](ipfs://bafkreie4qkdpgee2iazk6l5p5afxizxljtewpkl6iu5mxujupckzgigkwy)\n     \n![image7optional.PNG](ipfs://bafkreica7vmke52ugotkutmolqly7oc3afgart2gl2jp3xoefamdha2lda)\n\n![image3.PNG](ipfs://bafybeihqpthsswu6gjg2rnyhipffrunjbsnjjgchpw7kkyuq3yiez32jwa)\n\n![Tiny Licks.PNG](ipfs://bafybeibs7iqtyuc7amvtqa4yvacdgaohpop4cbwi3svibd6tsjwa6c2fuq)\n\n![Bomb Enemies.PNG](ipfs://bafybeidllndyr5j66p3sfmnm3rvfd6egu5g7jhrr7m64e4gqcfqv7kchka)\n\n****Investment Highlights:****\n**1.

      "content": "Author: Litepiglet\nGotchi ID: 5369\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 14 days\n\nOVERVIEW\nThis election will serve to replace Mori on the DAO multisig as the 9th signer, as he has stepped down. The salary for this position is 8000 ghst annually, paid quarterly (2000 ghst), as stated in AGIP 51. The elected person will also adhere to all principles and guidelines set forth in AGIP 51. The initial payment will be prorated at 2000 * (days left of term/91.25).\n\nThe elected individual will be immune to any future (re)elections from a community initiated vote for 2 years following their inauguration into the DAO Foundation as a director, but may still be removed by the other directors if they are not fulfilling their duties. They will provide the necessary doxx information and a wallet address to be added to multsig after the election.\n\nCOMPETENCY\n- Be an upstanding member of AavegotchiDAO with a good reputation\n- Be familiar with smart contract interactions\n- Possess a hardware wallet and know how to use it\n- Be willing to have their name on a Cayman entity and be doxxed to Pixelcraft Studios\n- Be familiar with creating transactions and signing on (prev. Gnosis) Safe\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\nThe DAO Directors act as the executor of the DAO’s wishes. If an individual director disagrees with an action of the DAO, they can choose to resign, but they cannot vote or act against a verified on-chain AGIP’s intent.\n\nDirectors have no legislative power, execute off-chain commands of the DAO, and simultaneously serve as signers of the Foundation's multisig.\n\nCANDIDATES\naavegotch1.eth\ntburd.eth\nfifoooo\nmusashi13\n\nYou can find each candidate's application here:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1259200686994882660",

Mastering those 3 is the secret to achieving a high score.\nGotchi 1 - The combat gotchi. He wields all your weapons and is the bread and butter of dealing with the Lickquidators. With a variety of weapons and upgrades to increase your damage he fends off the enemies.\nGotchi 2 - The Income gotchi. His purpose is to collect the fallen Ethereum from the Lickquidators. With upgrades that will allow him to strive away from this support role and give the player more offensive options to play with.\nGotchi 3 - The Support gotchi. Sometimes you need a way to freeze and slow the enemy, not just damage. With upgrades revolving around freeze duration and slow amount.\n\nOutside of the 3 playable characters you will have NPCs' helping you out.\nCitizens, they act as mini-combat gotchis, throwing fireballs from inside the Citaadel.\nWarrior Gotchis - Their purpose is to stop the Lickquidators in their tracks, stopping their movement once they get too close to the walls, fighting to the bitter end.\nThe shopkeeper is here to give you helpful tips and fun facts, morale is an important thing, as is his shop full of upgrades.\nIn Defense of Aave - Arcade your objective is to achieve as high of a highscore as possible. Outside of just getting to the highest level possible, you can control the difficulty by spending your Ethereum to increase the amount of enemies that spawn every night. This fine balance of how many enemies you can handle should allow you come up with plenty of strategies to achieve the highest of scores!\nWhile the amount of enemies doesn't increase naturally each level, their difficulty does. Having increasingly more health, and more Elite enemies replacing normal ones. So time is of the essence.\n\n    ![decisions.PNG](ipfs://bafkreia5gpwg3ecbyxayzr6y73kao2f4guj74egjv4uojwjug3wye7mrie)\n\n![image2 (1).png](ipfs://bafybeicdlwdyvxwxqp53dxswhc2kkarnzdejkbv5mwbu5sanlxzngubooy)\n\n![image5 (1).png](ipfs://bafybeidp37vcu4tpwnkcqpxcnn437ipelnwzyr6fpy4zi4vd4kvpkwboji)\n    \n![image4 (1).png](ipfs://bafybeifon3yswcxva4mguzwpdii3muw55ozcs2jvvmap57qmx3sxdjo2la)\n     \n![image6optional.PNG](ipfs://bafkreie4qkdpgee2iazk6l5p5afxizxljtewpkl6iu5mxujupckzgigkwy)\n     \n![image7optional.PNG](ipfs://bafkreica7vmke52ugotkutmolqly7oc3afgart2gl2jp3xoefamdha2lda)\n\n![image3.PNG](ipfs://bafybeihqpthsswu6gjg2rnyhipffrunjbsnjjgchpw7kkyuq3yiez32jwa)\n\n![Tiny Licks.PNG](ipfs://bafybeibs7iqtyuc7amvtqa4yvacdgaohpop4cbwi3svibd6tsjwa6c2fuq)\n\n![Bomb Enemies.PNG](ipfs://bafybeidllndyr5j66p3sfmnm3rvfd6egu5g7jhrr7m64e4gqcfqv7kchka)\n\n****Investment Highlights:****\n**1.

      "title": "[AGIP 124] Fund Creation of Ghostly Gladiator MVP",
      "content": "Author: Zygo (#4743)\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 10 days\nLink to Discord thread: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1247253990320898162\n\nSummary (include rationale, timeline, goals and any key performance indicators)\n\n This proposal is for funding an MVP of Ghostly Gladiator, a roguelike deck-building grid-based battler based on the assets & lore of the Gotchiverse. The long-term goals of the project are:\n\n#1 Create a great roguelike deck-builder, in order to\n #2 increase the exposure of crypto-agnostic & crypto-ignorant gamers to the Aavegotchi ecosystem and\n #3 provide a long-term income stream to the DAO through a community meta-progression system (see the Monetization section of the design doc for details on this part: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qCVldT37hQrScq8H8WI_bwYuk403gBzK89verrtVwI8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nGhostly Gladiator is targeted towards people who don’t know about Aavegotchi yet and maybe don’t even have a crypto wallet. Rather than try to monetize the (currently) small number of people that both own Aavegotchi assets and want to play minigames with them, this project is designed to appeal to the wider gaming audience and expose them to the Aavegotchi ecosystem and community. For those who like to ask ‘wen marketing’, my answer is ‘right now’. In marketing speak this game is targeted towards the top of the marketing funnel rather than the very bottom like many of the minigames so far have been.\n\nI am asking for $6500 worth of DAI or GHST to fund the creation of the MVP over 6 weeks, with plans for a larger proposal later if the project is successful with the community. At the end of the 6-week period I would run a small XP event for the community to try out the MVP.\n\nGhostly Gladiator (title not final) is a roguelike deck-building grid-based battler. For a game in the same genre, see Fights in Tight Spaces (or Knights in Tight Spaces). Fisht Fight (https://zygoth.itch.io/fisht-fight) is a simple example of this genre that I made for a 7-day game jam, and it’s the concept and code that I will be building from. Fisht Fight placed 11th out of 564 entries in the ‘Fun’ category in the Fish Fest game jam (top 2%). I highly recommend that you play Fisht Fight if you want an idea of how Ghostly Gladiator will play.\n\nBelow: Knights in Tight Spaces, a game in the same genre. (Ghostly Gladiator will be using simpler 2D graphics to reduce game scope)\n\n \n![knights-in-tight-spaces-example.jpg](ipfs://bafybeidleyxj6rigop4bikc5rj2zq4y2hjbtqm6qlfrevcoxi6mranlcii)\n    \n\nBasic Gameplay\n\nThe game is divided into 10 separate battles, each with different types of monsters. Each turn, the player draws 5 cards from their deck and receives 3 energy. They can use the energy to play cards from their hand in order to move around the battlefield, attack enemies, defend, summon allies, etc. Battles end when all enemies are defeated. After each battle, the player gets to pick a new card from 3 options to add to their deck. The game ends when the player completes all battles (victory) or loses all their HP.\n\nTimeline (6 weeks)\n\nProgramming (Zygo)\n\nRefactor code from Fisht Fight (3 days)\nSave/load system (5 days)\nBasic CMP system, accept user donations to unlock new features (5 days)\n10 new cards to unlock with the CMP system (3 days)\nIntegrate new art (3 days)\nTitle screen (1 day)\nUI improvements for increased clarity (3 days)\nTutorial (3 days)\nBug fixing (3 days)\nSystem to record player crypto address for an XP event (2 days)\nTotal: 31 days of work\n\nArt (Admurin)\n\nNew battle background\n Beta art for all cards\n Title screen art\n Reskin main character as Aavegotchi and enemies as different types of Lickuidators\n New Battle tile sprites\n Card sprite\n Various UI icons like draw/discard pile, card energy icon, block icon, etc.\n\nMusic (Mario Sello)\n\nTitle theme\nBattle music\nWin & lose fanfares\n\nSFX (Zygo)\n\nUse sounds from Zygo’s sound library & tools like LabChirp/SFXR\n\nKey performance indicators\n\nThe game will be hosted on Itch.io, so to begin with the KPIs will be the analytics that they offer. (daily views and plays) In addition, during the XP event the amount of unique crypto addresses that users submit will be a KPI for this proposal. Eventually tracking unique users, time played, and donations would be useful but these are out of scope for the MVP.\n\nEffect\n\nSend $6500 in DAI to address 0xF0Bc763e0A6AF4784a36fa102220FF60eC651f9e to fund the development of the MVP, including programming, pixel art, and music. This should be sent soon after the completion of the core prop so I can pay the pixel artist & composer up front.\n\nSchedule an XP event for the week of August 21-28. Since the game won’t be interfacing with the blockchain directly, XP credit tracking would be via an in-game form that shows up after a successful run. Players would submit their wallet address and a list of these addresses would be submitted to the DAO at the conclusion of the event. I chose this method because successful runs last about an hour, which would make farming XP for many gotchis individually take a prohibitive amount of time.\n\nCompleting this proposal will provide the following benefits:\n\nCreate the MVP for a free-to-play game in a popular genre that can appeal to non-crypto gamers and thus bring new players to the Aavegotchi ecosystem.\n\nHost an XP event to give Aavegotchi holders an opportunity to try out the game and give feedback\n\nCreate a base from which I can build mechanisms that will eventually self-fund the game and bring income to the DAO. (see the Monetization section in the design doc for more details on this: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qCVldT37hQrScq8H8WI_bwYuk403gBzK89verrtVwI8/edit)\n\nAcknowledge potential risks or unintended consequences\n\nRisk: the game is not finished or is completed poorly\nMitigations: I have a record of completing jam games and also projects much larger than 1 month; I also have a strong incentive to finish the MVP so I can continue working on the project in the future. Even if this were to occur, the amount of DAI committed to this MVP is small, so the risk of wasting funds is low.\n\nAny alternative paths (Plan B, Plan C, etc)\n\nNot sure what to put here, I always have ideas for other games but this is the one I feel most confident about.\n\nAbout Me\n\nHi! I’m Zygo, a game developer that has been involved with Aavegotchi since Haunt 1. I’ve always been interested in making games, and in the last 2 years I’ve been doing it full time. In February of 2024 I released Spellstrife on Steam after 14 months of work (https://store.steampowered.com/app/2385240/Spellstrife/). Since then, I’ve been doing game jams to practice quick development and test out some of my ideas. See my Itch.io page for my game jam games: https://zygoth.itch.io/ .

      "content": "Author: Zygo (#4743)\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 10 days\nLink to Discord thread: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1247253990320898162\n\nSummary (include rationale, timeline, goals and any key performance indicators) \nThis proposal is for funding an MVP of Ghostly Gladiator, a roguelike deck-building grid-based battler based on the assets & lore of the Gotchiverse. The long-term goals of the project are:\n\n#1 Create a great roguelike deck-builder, in order to\n#2 increase the exposure of crypto-agnostic & crypto-ignorant gamers to the Aavegotchi ecosystem and\n#3 provide a long-term income stream to the DAO through a community meta-progression system (see the Monetization section of the design doc for details on this part: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qCVldT37hQrScq8H8WI_bwYuk403gBzK89verrtVwI8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nGhostly Gladiator is targeted towards people who don’t know about Aavegotchi yet and maybe don’t even have a crypto wallet. Rather than try to monetize the (currently) small number of people that both own Aavegotchi assets and want to play minigames with them, this project is designed to appeal to the wider gaming audience and expose them to the Aavegotchi ecosystem and community. For those who like to ask ‘wen marketing’, my answer is ‘right now’. In marketing speak this game is targeted towards the top of the marketing funnel rather than the very bottom like many of the minigames so far have been.\n\nI am asking for $6500 worth of DAI or GHST to fund the creation of the MVP over 6 weeks, with plans for a larger proposal later if the project is successful with the community. At the end of the 6-week period I would run a small XP event for the community to try out the MVP.\n\nGhostly Gladiator (title not final) is a roguelike deck-building grid-based battler. For a game in the same genre, see Fights in Tight Spaces (or Knights in Tight Spaces). Fisht Fight (https://zygoth.itch.io/fisht-fight) is a simple example of this genre that I made for a 7-day game jam, and it’s the concept and code that I will be building from.

      "title": "[AGIP 121] AavegotchiDAO MCON III Sponsorship Package",
      "content": "Author: TBURD.ETH #0001(9673)\nQuorum Requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote Duration: 14 Days\nLinks: MAIN EVENT LINK: MCON III — 26th -28th September 2024  Detroit, MI https://mcon.fun/\n\tSIDE EVENT LOCATION: https://www.offworldarcade.com/ and Checker Bar Lounge https://checkerbar.com/\nDiscussion: https://www.discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1235789442321616897\n\nOVERVIEW\nThis proposal is to form a partnership with the MetaCartel and promote the Aavegotchi DAO at MCON3 in Detroit, MI. This intimate event with ~800 people who are deep into the onchain ecosystem, including creators, developers, and investors, will expose Aavegotchi to a new audience and strengthen connections with influential builders in the community.\n\nGOALS\nArcade Machine with WHTRANG3R/LITEPIGLET\nSide Event at Off-World Arcade ( GAME JAM HACK and/or TOURNAMENTS)\nInform and Incentivize builders to come and collaborate alongside the Aavegotchi DAO\n\nThe ethos of MetaCartel is “IF YOU WANT TO GO FAST, GO ALONE. IF YOU WANT TO GO FAR, GO TOGETHER” Members of the Aavegotchi DAO have attended previous MCONs, engaging with dedicated and innovative builders in governance, public goods, coordination, and onchain innovation. \nThis proposal seeks to invest in an event that has historically provided significant value to the Aavegotchi community. The MetaCartel is known for being an OG grants DAO in the Ethereum ecosystem, giving away $2mm+ in grants over 5 years of operation ( https://www.forum.metacartel.org/c/dao/7 ) they are also architects and incubators of some of the most well known projects in Web3. \n\n~ https://www.hydraventures.xyz/ \n~ https://www.metacartel.xyz/ \n~ https://www.gelato.network/ \n~ https://www.zapper.xyz/ \n~ https://www.collab.land/ \n~ https://www.raidguild.org/\n~ https://www.metafactory.ai/ \n\nAnd many many more…..\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\nThis proposal solicits support for a Mid-Tier Sponsorship of MCON3.  Whereby the funds will go towards executing the main event, as well as supporting a dedicated side event for Aavegotchi. \n\nThis 10k ticket covers staff/organizers, food, AV/ furnishings, tickets for the whole team as well as $2500 allocated to a Gotchi exclusive side event that the MCON organizers will help organize and promote amongst locals and OGs.\n\nAs a part of this experience Aavegotchi would be able to co-create the gaming track, pick topics of discussion, invite speakers to share their perspectives, and have a dedicated side event, social media spotlight, as well as all of our branding on the events marketing and media + logistical support from the MetaCartel to bring it all together. \n\nThe DAO arcade machine is needed to coordinate a successful side event where we can set up and interact with people playing it at Off-World Arcade. After sponsorship is approved by the DAO, more details can be laid out as we co-create a gaming track, tournament or game jam. \n\nWe’d need a paid team of at least 3 GotchiGang/Greetors (setup, breakdown, BD, media) and would prefer a PC representative and/or a DAO funded game dev to attend as well. Stickers, merch and other physical goods for marketing/signage and rewards for email captures for mailing lists would also need to be discussed, funded and produced. \n\nIF we do a game jam/hack focused side-event we need to consider qualified judges, discuss prizes for winners as well as rewards for any tournaments. Or just showcase Aavegotchi games and the arcade machine, run a few tournaments and onboard new DAO members, artists, and devs. \n\nFinal costs could range from 13-15K total(likely less), but we’d be saving funds by collaborating alongside MetaCartel to produce and market a successfully spicy Aavegotchi DAO side-event.\n\n\nMILESTONES\nEmail signups, Social Media Spotlight\nGames Developed\nDapps built for DAO governance and tooling\nGotchiPill community governerds, investors, gamers and game devs.\nLive discussions featuring Aavegotchi DAO members\n\nRISKS\nGotchichain not ready, readiness of playable Aavegotchi web3 connected games, Arcade machine progress, overspending budget. Not being a sponsoring partner and missing out on the spicy fun.\n\nCONCLUSION\nMembers from Aavegotchi DAO with personal connections and history with the MetaCartel have already proven to be valuable. Through these bonds we were given an opportunity for a last minute free booth at ETH Denver 2023 and are getting the top tier(20k) perks for sponsorship at the mid-tier(10K) cost for MCON3.\nThe proposed $10K sponsorship will leverage existing relationships with MetaCartel to achieve top-tier sponsorship benefits at a mid-tier cost. The additional estimated available budget from GotchiGreetors (3-5k) ensures logistical support for a successful event. This collaboration is expected to strengthen long-term relationships and create significant impact at MCON III!\n\n$10K paid for in USDC or EVM-Native Token on MAINNET sent to MetaCartel Safe eth: 0xc70c7090b91e0d9861d734Eb613761e8b35224D2 **directors should withdraw the 10K USDC from aave and send it to the recipient as advised by Maxicrouton. \n![Screenshot 2024-05-22 133902.png](ipfs://bafybeifp7tih46loomr3khkwjcjvh2gkjwp2jtjafec56ibfp36ddmbhwi)",

      "title": "[AGIP 123] Community Wearable Schematics Release",
      "content": "Author: Oliver Spoon (4858)\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 10 days\nDisccusion: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1126256051528937624/1238889414911066274\n\n# Overview\n\nFrens and Accessories Wearables Launch \nTheme is community-designed\n14 new designs ranging from common to mythical\n**Eyes, face, and pets only**\n**No new cores to be minted/released**\nAimed to balance the trait meta and freshen up the wearables pool\n12 unique designs. The common, uncommon, and rare pet would be evolutions of each other\nTarget release: end of September 2024 (sooner if PC has bandwidth for the push)\n\n## Community Competition\n\nAnyone can design a wearable and submit their artwork in any format. The winners will be chosen during a hangout in traditional emoji-response fashion\nI will work with the winners to make sure the pieces are in proper pixel-perfect format\nPrize money ranges from 100 ghst to 500 ghst \nBonus GHST prizes for whoever makes the best use of old wearables in set creation. The sets should strive to pick up older wearables as well as fill the gaps as shown here: https://wearables.report/trait-selection.html\nBonus GHST for the #1 favourite wearable\n\n \n![Screenshot 2024-05-28 at 15.02.25.png](ipfs://bafkreickae26ayzleuemaememj2dyq3m4alb5k363eeqejslmj2j2yfdj4)\n    \n\n## Partnerships\n\nPartnerships are always a great idea and welcomed. However they take quite a bit of time and coordination. Therefore, I propose we open this aspect with a bounty. Anyone who can successfully bridge our community with another favourable gang can grab a nice 500 GHST bounty. Keep in mind it's important in a partnership for reciprocity. Partnering goes beyond simply doing something for another community while receiving nothing in return. \n\nPartnership connections must be established by 15th June. The deal may not need to be closed, but we need to be 80% committed to it. This is because partnership-specific wearables are limited in their design scope (we don't want to have people designing a wearable for a slot that gets filled with a partnership!)\n\n## Timeline\n\nProposal raised and voting period 29th May - 15th June\nPartnership bounty deadline 15th June\nDesign submissions deadline 28th June\nCompetition voting 29th June\nArtwork refinement 30th June - 20th July\nHandoff all completed pieces to PC 20th July\nPC does their magic 20th July - release ???\n\n## Distribution & Mint\n\nNo new cores will be minted.\n\n \n![Screenshot 2024-05-28 at 15.11.21.png](ipfs://bafkreiftp4esfjbrtuvgtkcocc3olfzkgmcaewp6j33o3uio4vizrsxjfe)\n    \n    \nThe traits are pulled from here: https://wearables.report/trait-selection.html\nThe bigger the standard deviation, the further from balance that particular slot/rarity is. There are clear winners in every slot. For uncommon eye, there is no imbalance, so we propose two items which counter-balance each other.\n\nThe DAO will buy a basket of cores from the market and forge a number of pieces to use as giveaways or sales\nI propose a budget of 8,000 GHST to buy/forge as many pieces as possible. The goal is the following quantities:\nCommon eye & face: 50 ea\nCommon pet: 25\nUncommon eye & face: 25 ea\nUncommon pet: 15\nRare faces: 10 ea\nRare pet: 5\nno legendary or mythical\n\nThe total maximum alloy required is 72k which will be provided by the DAO stock. Any remaining alloy / ghst from this allotment will be returned. Any schematics obtained through smelting will be added to the geode pool.\n\nAll remaining schematics from the mint will be added to the geode pool.\n\nForged wearables will be sent to the DAO.\n\n## Total Costs\n\nCore buying: 8000 GHST\nPrize pool: 2650 GHST\nOliver for coordination, communication, and wearable rigging: 2600 GHST\nPartnership bounties: 500ea (to be distributed later upon success)\n\nTotal: 13,250 GHST + successful partnership bounties (as this number is unknown, we will send this separately)\n\nUpon successful passing of prop, send 13,250 GHST and 72,000 alloy to:\n0x4a478E4593A5D557dB640642c34Ae52800084451\nThis is a clean wallet which can be tracked for all buying / smelting.\nAs mentioned, all unspent GHST and alloy will be returned to the DAO.\n\n## Closing\n\nOverall, my hope is to have a fun event which brings the community together. The last design competition was a hit and there were so many great wearables designed. By opening up the design to more possibilities, we will have more winners. I also would love to see some old wearables freshened up in new creative ways with the addition of one or two new items :smile:\n\nWith more games on the horizon, RF, and the Battler, players are going to need different wearables to win the meta. \n\nMore option = more alloy burning = floors rising.\nThanks everyone and let's have some fun!",

      "title": "Community Wearable Schematics Release",
      "content": "Author: Oliver Spoon (4858)\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 10 days\nDisccusion: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1126256051528937624/1238889414911066274\n\n# Overview\n\nFrens and Accessories Wearables Launch \nTheme is community-designed\n14 new designs ranging from common to mythical\n**Eyes, face, and pets only**\n**No new cores to be minted/released**\nAimed to balance the trait meta and freshen up the wearables pool\n12 unique designs. The common, uncommon, and rare pet would be evolutions of each other\nTarget release: end of September 2024 (sooner if PC has bandwidth for the push)\n\n## Community Competition\n\nAnyone can design a wearable and submit their artwork in any format. The winners will be chosen during a hangout in traditional emoji-response fashion\nI will work with the winners to make sure the pieces are in proper pixel-perfect format\nPrize money ranges from 100 ghst to 500 ghst \nBonus GHST prizes for whoever makes the best use of old wearables in set creation. The sets should strive to pick up older wearables as well as fill the gaps as shown here: https://wearables.report/trait-selection.html\nBonus GHST for the #1 favourite wearable\n\n \n![Screenshot 2024-05-28 at 15.02.25.png](ipfs://bafkreickae26ayzleuemaememj2dyq3m4alb5k363eeqejslmj2j2yfdj4)\n    \n\n## Partnerships\n\nPartnerships are always a great idea and welcomed. However they take quite a bit of time and coordination. Therefore, I propose we open this aspect with a bounty. Anyone who can successfully bridge our community with another favourable gang can grab a nice 500 GHST bounty. Keep in mind it's important in a partnership for reciprocity. Partnering goes beyond simply doing something for another community while receiving nothing in return. \n\nPartnership connections must be established by 15th June. The deal may not need to be closed, but we need to be 80% committed to it. This is because partnership-specific wearables are limited in their design scope (we don't want to have people designing a wearable for a slot that gets filled with a partnership!)\n\n## Timeline\n\nProposal raised and voting period 29th May - 15th June\nPartnership bounty deadline 15th June\nDesign submissions deadline 28th June\nCompetition voting 29th June\nArtwork refinement 30th June - 20th July\nHandoff all completed pieces to PC 20th July\nPC does their magic 20th July - release ???\n\n## Distribution & Mint\n\nNo new cores will be minted.\n\n \n![Screenshot 2024-05-28 at 15.11.21.png](ipfs://bafkreiftp4esfjbrtuvgtkcocc3olfzkgmcaewp6j33o3uio4vizrsxjfe)\n    \n    \nThe traits are pulled from here: https://wearables.report/trait-selection.html\nThe bigger the standard deviation, the further from balance that particular slot/rarity is. There are clear winners in every slot. For uncommon eye, there is no imbalance, so we propose two items which counter-balance each other.\n\nThe DAO will buy a basket of cores from the market and forge a number of pieces to use as giveaways or sales\nI propose a budget of 8,000 GHST to buy/forge as many pieces as possible. The goal is the following quantities:\nCommon eye & face: 50 ea\nCommon pet: 25\nUncommon eye & face: 25 ea\nUncommon pet: 15\nRare faces: 10 ea\nRare pet: 5\nno legendary or mythical\n\nThe total maximum alloy required is 72k which will be provided by the DAO stock. Any remaining alloy / ghst from this allotment will be returned. Any schematics obtained through smelting will be added to the geode pool.\n\nAll remaining schematics from the mint will be added to the geode pool.\n\nForged wearables will be sent to the DAO.\n\n## Total Costs\n\nCore buying: 8000 GHST\nPrize pool: 2650 GHST\nOliver for coordination, communication, and wearable rigging: 2600 GHST\nPartnership bounties: 500ea (to be distributed later upon success)\n\nTotal: 13,250 GHST + successful partnership bounties (as this number is unknown, we will send this separately)\n\nUpon successful passing of prop, send 13,250 GHST and 72,000 alloy to:\n0x4a478E4593A5D557dB640642c34Ae52800084451\nThis is a clean wallet which can be tracked for all buying / smelting.\nAs mentioned, all unspent GHST and alloy will be returned to the DAO.\n\n## Closing\n\nOverall, my hope is to have a fun event which brings the community together. The last design competition was a hit and there were so many great wearables designed. By opening up the design to more possibilities, we will have more winners. I also would love to see some old wearables freshened up in new creative ways with the addition of one or two new items :smile:\n\nWith more games on the horizon, RF, and the Battler, players are going to need different wearables to win the meta. \n\nMore option = more alloy burning = floors rising.\nThanks everyone and let's have some fun!",

      "title": "AavegotchiDAO MCON III Sponsorship Package",
      "content": "Author: TBURD.ETH #0001(9673)\nQuorum Requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote Duration: 14 Days\nLinks: MAIN EVENT LINK: MCON III — 26th -28th September 2024  Detroit, MI https://mcon.fun/\n\tSIDE EVENT LOCATION: https://www.offworldarcade.com/ and Checker Bar Lounge https://checkerbar.com/\nDiscussion: https://www.discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1235789442321616897\n\nOVERVIEW\nThis proposal is to form a partnership with the MetaCartel and promote the Aavegotchi DAO at MCON3 in Detroit, MI. This intimate event with ~800 people who are deep into the onchain ecosystem, including creators, developers, and investors, will expose Aavegotchi to a new audience and strengthen connections with influential builders in the community.\n\nGOALS\nArcade Machine with WHTRANG3R/LITEPIGLET\nSide Event at Off-World Arcade ( GAME JAM HACK and/or TOURNAMENTS)\nInform and Incentivize builders to come and collaborate alongside the Aavegotchi DAO\n\nThe ethos of MetaCartel is “IF YOU WANT TO GO FAST, GO ALONE. IF YOU WANT TO GO FAR, GO TOGETHER” Members of the Aavegotchi DAO have attended previous MCONs, engaging with dedicated and innovative builders in governance, public goods, coordination, and onchain innovation. \nThis proposal seeks to invest in an event that has historically provided significant value to the Aavegotchi community. The MetaCartel is known for being an OG grants DAO in the Ethereum ecosystem, giving away $2mm+ in grants over 5 years of operation ( https://www.forum.metacartel.org/c/dao/7 ) they are also architects and incubators of some of the most well known projects in Web3. \n\n~ https://www.hydraventures.xyz/ \n~ https://www.metacartel.xyz/ \n~ https://www.gelato.network/ \n~ https://www.zapper.xyz/ \n~ https://www.collab.land/ \n~ https://www.raidguild.org/\n~ https://www.metafactory.ai/ \n\nAnd many many more…..\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\nThis proposal solicits support for a Mid-Tier Sponsorship of MCON3.  Whereby the funds will go towards executing the main event, as well as supporting a dedicated side event for Aavegotchi. \n\nThis 10k ticket covers staff/organizers, food, AV/ furnishings, tickets for the whole team as well as $2500 allocated to a Gotchi exclusive side event that the MCON organizers will help organize and promote amongst locals and OGs.\n\nAs a part of this experience Aavegotchi would be able to co-create the gaming track, pick topics of discussion, invite speakers to share their perspectives, and have a dedicated side event, social media spotlight, as well as all of our branding on the events marketing and media + logistical support from the MetaCartel to bring it all together. \n\nThe DAO arcade machine is needed to coordinate a successful side event where we can set up and interact with people playing it at Off-World Arcade. After sponsorship is approved by the DAO, more details can be laid out as we co-create a gaming track, tournament or game jam. \n\nWe’d need a paid team of at least 3 GotchiGang/Greetors (setup, breakdown, BD, media) and would prefer a PC representative and/or a DAO funded game dev to attend as well. Stickers, merch and other physical goods for marketing/signage and rewards for email captures for mailing lists would also need to be discussed, funded and produced. \n\nIF we do a game jam/hack focused side-event we need to consider qualified judges, discuss prizes for winners as well as rewards for any tournaments. Or just showcase Aavegotchi games and the arcade machine, run a few tournaments and onboard new DAO members, artists, and devs. \n\nFinal costs could range from 13-15K total(likely less), but we’d be saving funds by collaborating alongside MetaCartel to produce and market a successfully spicy Aavegotchi DAO side-event.\n\n\nMILESTONES\nEmail signups, Social Media Spotlight\nGames Developed\nDapps built for DAO governance and tooling\nGotchiPill community governerds, investors, gamers and game devs.\nLive discussions featuring Aavegotchi DAO members\n\nRISKS\nGotchichain not ready, readiness of playable Aavegotchi web3 connected games, Arcade machine progress, overspending budget. Not being a sponsoring partner and missing out on the spicy fun.\n\nCONCLUSION\nMembers from Aavegotchi DAO with personal connections and history with the MetaCartel have already proven to be valuable. Through these bonds we were given an opportunity for a last minute free booth at ETH Denver 2023 and are getting the top tier(20k) perks for sponsorship at the mid-tier(10K) cost for MCON3.\nThe proposed $10K sponsorship will leverage existing relationships with MetaCartel to achieve top-tier sponsorship benefits at a mid-tier cost. The additional estimated available budget from GotchiGreetors (3-5k) ensures logistical support for a successful event. This collaboration is expected to strengthen long-term relationships and create significant impact at MCON III!\n\n$10K paid for in USDC or EVM-Native Token on MAINNET sent to MetaCartel Safe eth: 0xc70c7090b91e0d9861d734Eb613761e8b35224D2 **directors should withdraw the 10K USDC from aave and send it to the recipient as advised by Maxicrouton. \n![Screenshot 2024-05-22 133902.png](ipfs://bafybeifp7tih46loomr3khkwjcjvh2gkjwp2jtjafec56ibfp36ddmbhwi)",

      "content": "*Author* : Maxicrouton (13700), Fifoo(11008), CryptoGotchi(8612), PG(4895), Roxiano (24711)\n*Quorum Requirement* : 20% (9M)\n*Vote Duration* : 14 Days\n*Reference Material* : Aavegotchi Grants Operations and Procedures:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1zpA2aYRJYjXIrI93gSMKbkbppYNJpu_JxxK1m97QGsI/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\n**Introduction** :\nNavigating the process of submitting a project to the DAO can often prove to be a lengthy endeavor, particularly for smaller-scale initiatives, MVPs or ecosystem tool maintenance. With a focus on fostering community-driven initiatives, the AGP aims to provide financial support to promising projects, facilitating their journey from conception to realization.\n\n\n**Key Features**:\n- Funding Ceiling: The AGP will concentrate on supporting projects with funding requirements below $10,000.\n\n- Evaluation Criteria: Projects seeking funding will be assessed based on criteria including technical feasibility, budget and timeline reasonability, alignment with Aavegotchi's vision, team competency, community impact, innovation, and DAO revenue.\n\n- Decision Making: The AGP team, comprising individuals with equal voting power, will evaluate project proposals and decide on funding allocations.\n\n- Oversight and Management: The AGP will be responsible for monitoring funded projects, encompassing monitoring, milestone review, fund disbursement, and proactive management of potential deviations.\n\n\n**Team Structure**:\n\nThe AGP team comprises the following members:\n\n- @[GFA]fifoooo (Team Leader): Assumes responsibility for overall coordination and management of the AGP.\n- @roxiano (Spokesperson): Tasked with managing public relations and communication efforts on behalf of the AGP.\n- @Maxicrouton (Treasurer & DeFi Expert): Provides oversight on financial matters and contributes technical expertise to the AGP's operations.\n- @CryptoGotchi (Unity Expert): Published on the Unity Asset Store since 2016. Founded a game development company in 2019 and gained valuable experience in navigating grant funding..\n- @PG (Solidity Expert): Contributes technical expertise on smart contracts development and integration. Provides code assessment and review to support and enhance the AGP's effectiveness in achieving its objectives.\n\n\n**Budget Considerations**:\n- The proposed budget to be handled by the AGP is $100,000 (in stablecoin). A minimum of 80% will be allocated for funding projects, while the remaining will be designated for compensating the individuals working within the AGP. This allocation is projected to sustain the program for eight months based on estimated operational and project funding requirements.\n- Hourly compensation for team members is set at $40/hour (paid in stablecoin), with monthly caps on hours worked per role.\n- Funds allocated to the AGP will be stored in a 3/5 multisig wallet. The address (matic:0x8ee698836C494DDb267549259840E0565Ca557e9) will receive the funds once the core proposal is approved.\n\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe revised proposal for the Aavegotchi Grants Program reflects adjustments made in response to community feedback from the signaling proposal made 4 months ago. By adhering to transparent and accountable practices, the program endeavors to create a seamless process for funneling developers, creators, and innovators within the DAO.\n\nFor more details, here is a link to the whitepaper of the AGP : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zpA2aYRJYjXIrI93gSMKbkbppYNJpu_JxxK1m97QGsI/edit?usp=sharing",

This proposal applies retroactively to the rewards we are currently accruing.\n\nCurrently, any AERO that is earned by the DAO via the Aerodrome liquidity flywheel cannot be allocated because the terms were not in the original proposal. \n\nThis prop proposes to allocate any AERO earned by our POL (protocol-owned liquidity) on Aerodrome in the following way:\n\n20% converted to ETH\n80% added to the GHST/WETH liquidity pool incentives for the next epoch\n\nThese transactions should be carried out within seven (7) days of receiving the AERO, unless extenuating circumstances cause delays. \n\nThe proposed length for this allocation is three months. After three months, a new proposal will be drafted and submitted to AavegotchiDAO to either continue the allocation as is, or make changes. \n\nThank you for your consideration frens!",

      "content": "Author: Flamevipers\nGotchi ID: 7885\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\nDiscord Thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1237740922075222057/1237740922075222057\nLite-Litepaper GDD presentation:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ss0MByss0d3MPpR-_qLB9f72xqaDxQbZuH3VfIXf4AU/edit?pli=1#heading=h.d15qfbplsqci\n\n\nHello gotchigang,\nIt is with great pleasure to bring forward to you today a proposal for the start of an incremental defense shooter game me and my partner have worked on to bring to the community.\n\n**What is Defense of Aave[DOA]?**\nDefense of Aave [DOA] is an incremental defense type game that focuses on the player defending The Citaadel from the onslaught of the Lickquidators. \n\nOur three heroic Gotchis have taken upon themselves to protect the gates. Each one harboring a different ability that'll help them push back the Lickquidators. \nGotchi 1 - Dusk Blackflame - A true mage he throws his mighty fireballs unleashing havoc wherever he hits.\nGotchi 2 - Umbria Nightsong- The Vortex with his gravity type abilities he'll suck all the precious resources. \nGotchi 3 - Noir Frozencaller - A pacifist at his heart even he decided the Lickquidators are a threat. With his iceballs he stops anything from moving. \n\nBut the three mighty Gotchis aren't the only ones in this fight! the citizen gotchis themselves will help with their own fireballs from the Citaadel shooting over the walls. \nThe Citaadel must survive! But the threat of the Lickquidators only gets higher with each passing night as they get stronger and stronger. \nFear not! as the shopkeeper is here to provide priceless upgrades to aid in the battle!\n\nJust make sure to collect the Ethereum from the slain Lickquidators. \nOh, you thought it would be easy to just collect the Ethereum? Hah, you summer gotchi. You'll have competition, for the Lickquidators have brought their own loan sharks to try and collect their Ethereum back! And believe me when I tell you that you don't want to know what happens if they manage to run away with enough Ethereum... \nIn our first iteration of the game Defense of Aave: Arcade You'll be faced against an infinite amount of enemies, they will come every night stronger and stronger. For how long can you survive before the Citaadel falls? \nWho will gain the most score? \nThis is Arcade! A fun short version that anyone can pickup at any time. In a later proposal we'll have Defense of Aave: Frontiers which will allow you to take the fight to the Lickquidators and end the onslaught once and for all.\nThe current arcade demo will be available to select members of the community for feedback.\n\n**The Arcade demo currently includes:**\nThree difficulties for the more faint of heart all the way to the masochists. \nThree types of enemies and 2 Elite enemies.\nMelee Enemy that serves as the frontguard, beefy and large. \nRanged Enemy slow and small, they will shoot at you from afar while they let the melee tank all the hits. \nEthereumStealers, these cunning enemies only purpose is to steal all the ethereum from the board and make it back to their base. \nBossType a very large, slow and chonky enemy, his large body requires the Lickquidators to collect Ethereum to summon this monstrosity. \nIn the full version of the Arcade we hope to add more enemy types, different weapons for the user to play around with and various unique upgrades to really allow you to try all kinds of different playstyles.\n\n**Funding Request**\nWe are seeking a grant request of $58,000 with a 9,000 GHST bounty.\n$20,000 USDC to Flamevipers for web2 game code, game design, project management, lead director.\n$20,000 USDC main programmer for web2 game code, game design & development.\n$12,000 USDC for extra programmers for game code, web3 implementation, website, server costs, leaderboard security, anti DDOsing, Unity animation implementation and other extra work.\n$6,000 USDC for graphics & animations, audio work.\n9,000 GHST bounty.\n\n**Funding disbursement**\nUpon core proposal passing \n$10,000 USDC sent to address\n0x169c8b95378241814d3793415614e1c40c26e1c0\n$18,000 USDC sent to address\n0x3b19B211304709FBfDB99b1791d40E15E553CA84\n\nJuly 10th (Saturday)\n$5,000 USDC sent to address\n0x169c8b95378241814d3793415614e1c40c26e1c0\n$10,000 USDC + 4,500 GHST sent to address\n0x3b19B211304709FBfDB99b1791d40E15E553CA84\n\nAugust 10th (Saturday) \n$5,000 USDC sent to address\n0x169c8b95378241814d3793415614e1c40c26e1c0\n$10,000 USDC + 4,500 GHST sent to address\n0x3b19B211304709FBfDB99b1791d40E15E553CA84\n\nTarget launch: 25th October, 2024 (Friday).\n\nAll funds must be sent through a Polygon compatible address.\nThis proposal was handwritten without the help of any LLM AI.",

After three months, a new proposal will be drafted and submitted to AavegotchiDAO to either continue the allocation as is, or make changes. \n\nThank you for your consideration frens!",

      "content": "Author: AL (discord: @AL4105)\nGotchi ID: 1264\nVote details: 20% Quorum; (7) days duration\n\n## Background:\nAavegotchiDAO holds a range of treasury assets according to the mandate laid out in AGIP65 which outlined a 4-way split for unlocked $DAI for liquidity, general reserve, core team, and player rewards.\n\n### As of April 1st 2024, our stablecoin basket is as follows:\n~5.8million USD worth\n87.3% in $DAI/$aDAI; remaining in $USDC\n\n## Motivation:\nAn ecosystem change at MakerDAO is recently introducing some additional risk to $DAI with the consideration of including algorithmic stablecoin $USDE and $sUSDE as collateral to borrow $DAI against, with a cap being considered up to $1 billion USD.\n\nThis move is indicative of a growing trend where DeFi protocols seek to capture additional yield for users and controversially increase instability risks of the underlying assets in return. With our own DAO stablecoin holdings denominated largely in $DAI I think it is time to shed this risk by converting all our DAI into less risky stablecoins.\nIt is encouraged voters learn more on the MakerDAO situation in the URLs listed at the bottom of this vote.\n\n### Voting Material:\nI am proposing we convert all treasury assets held in $DAI and $aDAI into $USDC and $aUSDC, respectively. All assets will remain on their current networks unless bridged elsewhere on a different vote.\nWith some research on 3-month yields it looks like there will be minimal impact on our interest accrued if we swap all $aDAI -> $aUSDC. This can be seen from a Dune Analytics chart below.\n\nIf passed, the acting AavegotchiDAO Treasurer and Foundation multi-sig directors should follow the below recommendations when swapping:\n• Withdraw all $DAI tokens deposited into Aave & Issue two tranches of swaps to USDC on https://swap.cow.fi/. Then re-deposit all USDC from aDAI equivalents back into the Aave Ethereum V3 Market for address 0x53…7B62.\n• For affected addresses on Polygon issue one swap from DAI -> USDC for both addresses 0x93…631c & 0x8c…90f6 on https://curve.fi/ .\n• For the remaining DAI in wallet 0xFF…8020 please follow the swap instructions above for Polygon on Curve.fi and swap to USDC.\nTotal DAI Holdings and Wallets\nDAO Foundation Treasury\n15,809 DAI - 0x53c3CA81EA03001a350166D2Cc0fcd9d4c1b7B62 ; Ethereum\n3,557,579 aDAI - 0x53c3CA81EA03001a350166D2Cc0fcd9d4c1b7B62 ; Ethereum\n193,490 DAI - 0x939b67F6F6BE63E09B0258621c5A24eecB92631c ; Polygon\nRemaining Bonding Curve Fees (Ethereum)\n275,825 DAI - 0xFFE6280ae4E864D9aF836B562359FD828EcE8020\nDAO Foundation Rewards Pool (Polygon)\n9 DAI - 0x8c8E076Cd7D2A17Ba2a5e5AF7036c2b2B7F790f6\nTotal – 4,042,712 DAI\n\nBackground Sources:\nhttps://forum.makerdao.com/t/money-view-of-the-makerdao-morpho-ethena-drama/24026\nhttps://forum.makerdao.com/t/risk-assessment-usde-morpho-lending-integration/23924/7",

      "title": "[AGIP 118] Proposal to Add Liquidity on Aerodrome and earn AERO",
      "content": "Author: coderdan (1484)\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\n\n# Introduction:\n\nThis proposal seeks to strengthen the Aavegotchi ecosystem by increasing liquidity on Aerodrome, Base's native decentralized exchange (DEX). By adding $500K worth of $GHST and $500K worth of Ethereum to a liquidity pool on Aerodrome, we aim to deepen liquidity and attract more users to the platform. Additionally, we propose allocating 100K GHST worth of bribe incentives to further encourage participation and engagement.\n\n# Rationale:\n\nIncreasing Liquidity: With GHST recently launching on Base, we have a responsibility to help ensure adequate liquidity for traders on Base. The proposed allocation of $500K worth of GHST and $500K worth of Ethereum into a liquidity pool on Aerodrome will significantly improve the depth of liquidity for trading on Base. This will allow for more efficient trading and reduce price slippage, making the Aavegotchi ecosystem more attractive to both existing and potential users.\n\nIncentivizing Participation: By allocating 100K GHST worth of bribe incentives, we aim to encourage more users to engage with the Aavegotchi ecosystem on Aerodrome. These incentives will be distributed as rewards for veAERO holders in exchange for them voting to increase the allocation of AERO rewards for the GHST-ETH pool.\n\nEarning AERO token for the DAO treasury: Aerodrome is the leading native DEX on Base, and with Aavegotchi making inroads into Base and Gotchichain settling to Base, it makes sense for the DAO to have a stake in the chain’s success. Since Base does not have a native token, tokens like AERO can be seen as proxies for the chain’s growth. \n\n# Proposal Details:\n\nAllocation of Funds: The proposal calls for the allocation of $500K worth of GHST and $500K worth of Ethereum from the AavegotchiDAO treasury to be used for creating a liquidity pool on Aerodrome.\n\nDistribution of Incentives: The proposal also includes the allocation of 100K GHST of bribe incentives to be distributed among veAERO holders on Aerodrome. These incentives should be distributed in two tranches of 50K GHST each over a period of one month.\n\nImplementation Timeline: The proposal aims to have the liquidity pool established and the bribe incentives ready for distribution within 14 days of the proposal's approval. The AavegotchiDAO foundation should be responsible for overseeing the implementation process and ensuring that all necessary steps are completed in a timely manner.\n\nSource of funds: $500K worth of ETH should be sourced by converting DAI from the DAO Liquidity wallet into ETH. $500K worth of GHST should be obtained by reducing the DAO’s 80-20 LP on Balancer to obtain enough GHST. Both GHST and ETH should be bridged from Ethereum to Base via the canonical Superbridge or Base Bridge (whichever is easiest).",

      "content": "Author: AL (discord: @AL4105)\nGotchi ID: 1264\nVote details: 20% Quorum; (7) days duration\n\n**Background:**\n\nAavegotchiDAO holds a range of treasury assets according to the mandate laid out in AGIP65 which outlined a 4-way split for unlocked $DAI for liquidity, general reserve, core team, and player rewards. \n\nAs of April 1st 2024, our stablecoin basket is as follows:\n* ~5.8million USD worth\n* 87.3% in $DAI/$aDAI; remaining in $USDC\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nAn ecosystem change at MakerDAO is recently introducing some additional risk to $DAI with the consideration of including algorithmic stablecoin $USDE and $sUSDE as collateral to borrow $DAI against, with a cap being considered up to $1 billion USD. \n\nThis move is indicative of a growing trend where DeFi protocols seek to capture additional high yield while risking stability of the underlying assets in return. With our own DAO stablecoin holdings denominated largely in $DAI I think it is time to shed this risk by converting all our DAI into less risky stablecoins.\n\nIt is encouraged voters learn more on the MakerDAO situation in the URLs listed at the bottom of this vote.\n\n**Voting Material:**\n\nI am proposing we convert all treasury assets held in $DAI and $aDAI into $USDC and $aUSDC, respectively. All assets will remain on their current networks unless bridged elsewhere on a different vote.\n\nWith some research on 3-month yields it looks like there will be minimal impact on our interest accrued if we swap all $aDAI -> $aUSDC. This can be seen from a Dune Analytics chart below. ![image](ipfs://bafkreidjyvb5cz5etsgh7x5ise73moqxofqlh5fvjwbxny56u3f2f3rhza)\n\nIf passed, the acting AavegotchiDAO Treasurer and Foundation multi-sig directors should follow the below recommendations when swapping:\n\n•    Withdraw all $DAI tokens deposited into Aave & Issue two tranches of swaps to USDC on https://swap.cow.fi/ for the aDAI & DAI balance in 0x53…7B62.\n•    For affected addresses on Polygon issue one swap from DAI -> USDC for both addresses 0x93…631c & 0x8c…90f6 on https://curve.fi/ .\n•    For the remaining wallet 0xFF…8020 please follow the swap instructions above for Polygon on Curve.fi.\n\nTotal DAI Holdings and Wallets\n\nDAO Foundation Treasury\n15,809 DAI -   0x53c3CA81EA03001a350166D2Cc0fcd9d4c1b7B62    ; Ethereum\n3,557,579 aDAI -    0x53c3CA81EA03001a350166D2Cc0fcd9d4c1b7B62    ; Ethereum\n193,490 DAI -    0x939b67F6F6BE63E09B0258621c5A24eecB92631c   ; Polygon\n\nRemaining Bonding Curve Fees (Ethereum)\n 275,825 DAI -   0xFFE6280ae4E864D9aF836B562359FD828EcE8020\n\nDAO Foundation Rewards Pool (Polygon)\n9 DAI -    0x8c8E076Cd7D2A17Ba2a5e5AF7036c2b2B7F790f6\n\nTotal – 4,042,712 DAI\n\n\nBackground Sources:\n- https://forum.makerdao.com/t/money-view-of-the-makerdao-morpho-ethena-drama/24026\n\n- https://forum.makerdao.com/t/risk-assessment-usde-morpho-lending-integration/23924/7",

      "title": "Proposal to Add Liquidity on Aerodrome and earn AERO",
      "content": "Author: coderdan (1484)\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\n\n# Introduction:\n\nThis proposal seeks to strengthen the Aavegotchi ecosystem by increasing liquidity on Aerodrome, Base's native decentralized exchange (DEX). By adding $500K worth of $GHST and $500K worth of Ethereum to a liquidity pool on Aerodrome, we aim to deepen liquidity and attract more users to the platform. Additionally, we propose allocating 100K GHST worth of bribe incentives to further encourage participation and engagement.\n\n# Rationale:\n\nIncreasing Liquidity: With GHST recently launching on Base, we have a responsibility to help ensure adequate liquidity for traders on Base. The proposed allocation of $500K worth of GHST and $500K worth of Ethereum into a liquidity pool on Aerodrome will significantly improve the depth of liquidity for trading on Base. This will allow for more efficient trading and reduce price slippage, making the Aavegotchi ecosystem more attractive to both existing and potential users.\n\nIncentivizing Participation: By allocating 100K GHST worth of bribe incentives, we aim to encourage more users to engage with the Aavegotchi ecosystem on Aerodrome. These incentives will be distributed as rewards for veAERO holders in exchange for them voting to increase the allocation of AERO rewards for the GHST-ETH pool.\n\nEarning AERO token for the DAO treasury: Aerodrome is the leading native DEX on Base, and with Aavegotchi making inroads into Base and Gotchichain settling to Base, it makes sense for the DAO to have a stake in the chain’s success. Since Base does not have a native token, tokens like AERO can be seen as proxies for the chain’s growth. \n\n# Proposal Details:\n\nAllocation of Funds: The proposal calls for the allocation of $500K worth of GHST and $500K worth of Ethereum from the AavegotchiDAO treasury to be used for creating a liquidity pool on Aerodrome.\n\nDistribution of Incentives: The proposal also includes the allocation of 100K GHST of bribe incentives to be distributed among veAERO holders on Aerodrome. These incentives should be distributed in two tranches of 50K GHST each over a period of one month.\n\nImplementation Timeline: The proposal aims to have the liquidity pool established and the bribe incentives ready for distribution within 14 days of the proposal's approval. The AavegotchiDAO foundation should be responsible for overseeing the implementation process and ensuring that all necessary steps are completed in a timely manner.\n\nSource of funds: $500K worth of ETH should be sourced by converting DAI from the DAO Liquidity wallet into ETH. $500K worth of GHST should be obtained by reducing the DAO’s 80-20 LP on Balancer to obtain enough GHST. Both GHST and ETH should be bridged from Ethereum to Base via the canonical Superbridge or Base Bridge (whichever is easiest).",

It's time to find out who's FAKE strength is real. This adaptation of classic war card combat + 3-in-a-row, utilizing FAKEgotchis with a custom dynamic numerical model, enables deterministic gameplay with the existing asset library of FAKEgotchi NFTs.\n\n## Whitepaper\nhttps://gmifrens.gitbook.io/fakewaar-whitepaper\n\n## Current Gameplay\nTwo players, 1v1, 9 cards randomly selected from the FAKEgotchiDEX. High card wins. Winner is able to place their winning card on the battle board. Players are able to overtake an already placed card on the battle board if their card has a higher FAKE strength. Three in a row placed on the battle board provides additional bonus points at final score.\n\n## Target Audience\nFAKEwaar is designed to provide a lightweight, casual, replayable gamification layer to the existing FAKEgotchi assets. It is meant for creators, collectors and everyone else who has yet to discover the cultural heartbeat of Aavegotchi: FAKEgotchis!\n\n## Platform\nFAKEwaar is built in Unity with native networking. While a web hosted version is the primary focus, we will also be working hard to support ANDROID mobile users. Probably iOS as well.\n\n## Request for Continuing Development Support\nV1 as presented during the March 30th, 2024 DAO call has been developed independently by GMI Game Labs. We humbly request additional support from the Aavegotchi DAO based on the demonstrated capabilities and potential of the V1 playable proof of concept. \n\n## Timeline\nUpon approval and receipt of the requested continuing development fund, FAKEwaar V2 would be planned for a three month development timeline. This fund would allow GMI Game Labs to put full time effort into this development and we fully anticipate fulfilling or even beating this timeline. A full overview of V2 implementations can be found in the FAKEwaar Whitepaper.\nhttps://gmifrens.gitbook.io/fakewaar-whitepaper\n\n# Requested Funding\nTotal Cost: 18K USD\nBreakdown:\n6K - Unity Development & Project Management by Mycaleum\n6K - Website, Smart Contract and Technical Support by User Default\n6K - Creative leadership of asset and art generation by Kravitch\n\nUpon approval, we request $18k USD equivalent in stablecoins (USDC/USDT/DAI) to be transferred to the GMI Multisig Treasury on Polygon PoS at:\n0x376184461aaa5Bd445cd52924Fdf29e8E4b86900 \n\nIn the event the DAO does not have on-hand stablecoin liquidity on Polygon PoS to fulfill this disbursement, we request an appropriate amount of $GHST tokens be swapped in order to provide this stablecoin liquidity in full.\n\n### Thank you for your support!\nWith the amazing talent, commitment and passion of FAKEgotchi creators and collectors and a team like this, we know FAKEwaar is definitely GMI!",

      "title": "Increase Successful Core Proposal XP to 500",
      "content": "Author: Dr. Wagmi (16635)\nQuorum Requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote Duration: 14 Days\n\nI propose that we increase the amount of XP granted to author(s) of successful core proposals to 500 total XP. It is an incredible amount of work to ideate and champion a proposal through any DAO, let alone one of the most active, vibrant and successful DAOs of all time. As a DAO, we should attempt to recognize and reward that work appropriately. \n\nSimply put, 150XP isn't sufficient. XP is generally valued at 0.2GHST/XP in the marketplace. This means we are rewarding successful authors of proposals a measly 30 GHST of value for the work they put in. An increase to 500 XP/successful proposal provides an estimated value of 100 GHST of XP which still feels small but is closer to appropriately recognizing our core contributors. A larger XP allotment also allows multiple authors to split XP as dividing up 150 XP among multiple people is exceptionally painful.\n\nThere has been no update to voting XP since AGIP7! This proposal still leaves room for ongoing improvements to the voting system but immediately addresses gap in recognition.\n\nThanks for the consideration\n\nDW",

      "title": "FAKEwaar Continuing Development Fund",
      "content": "Author: Mycaleum (7260)\n\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 10 days\nDiscussion:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1221209900517163158\n \n![FAKEwaar Title Banner.png](ipfs://bafkreigokfn7iawh75hyqrej6ik6zznt65pcuo5yeffjgdh67xymq3d34i)\n    \n# Introduction\nDo you hear the drums of waar, fren? It's time to find out who's FAKE strength is real. This adaptation of classic war card combat + 3-in-a-row, utilizing FAKEgotchis with a custom dynamic numerical model, enables deterministic gameplay with the existing asset library of FAKEgotchi NFTs.\n\n## Whitepaper\nhttps://gmifrens.gitbook.io/fakewaar-whitepaper\n\n## Current Gameplay\nTwo players, 1v1, 9 cards randomly selected from the FAKEgotchiDEX. High card wins. Winner is able to place their winning card on the battle board. Players are able to overtake an already placed card on the battle board if their card has a higher FAKE strength. Three in a row placed on the battle board provides additional bonus points at final score.\n\n## Target Audience\nFAKEwaar is designed to provide a lightweight, casual, replayable gamification layer to the existing FAKEgotchi assets. It is meant for creators, collectors and everyone else who has yet to discover the cultural heartbeat of Aavegotchi: FAKEgotchis!\n\n## Platform\nFAKEwaar is built in Unity with native networking. While a web hosted version is the primary focus, we will also be working hard to support ANDROID mobile users. Probably iOS as well.\n\n## Request for Continuing Development Support\nV1 as presented during the March 30th, 2024 DAO call has been developed independently by GMI Game Labs. We humbly request additional support from the Aavegotchi DAO based on the demonstrated capabilities and potential of the V1 playable proof of concept. \n\n## Timeline\nUpon approval and receipt of the requested continuing development fund, FAKEwaar V2 would be planned for a three month development timeline. This fund would allow GMI Game Labs to put full time effort into this development and we fully anticipate fulfilling or even beating this timeline. A full overview of V2 implementations can be found in the FAKEwaar Whitepaper.\nhttps://gmifrens.gitbook.io/fakewaar-whitepaper\n\n# Requested Funding\nTotal Cost: 18K USD\nBreakdown:\n6K - Unity Development & Project Management by Mycaleum\n6K - Website, Smart Contract and Technical Support by User Default\n6K - Creative leadership of asset and art generation by Kravitch\n\n### Thank you for your support!\nWith the amazing talent, commitment and passion of FAKEgotchi creators and collectors and a team like this, we know FAKEwaar is definitely GMI!",

Gather and communicate feedback to forum operators.\n\nCommunication and Follow-Up:\nDeliver succinct summaries of discussions, decisions, and action items. Monitor progress on agreed-upon tasks.\n\nConflict Resolution:\nServe as an impartial mediator to resolve disputes and disagreements during discussions.\n\nInnovation Promotion:\nPromote the exploration of innovative ideas, tools, and practices to improve our governance process.\n\nCommitment:\nThe role requires 6-10 hours of preparation weekly, including a one-hour DAO call every Saturday at 3pm UTC.\n\nIf the role is split (in this case amongst 4 members) the commitment will also be split equally. 4 members taking on this role would take one week each in this case.\n\nImportant to note this is usually a week long ongoing effort + Saturday Call. \n\nTerm length:\n6 Months with an option to re-elect a member at 3 months should they step down or cannot fulfill the role adequately.\n\nCompensation:\n500 USD, per month, per member \nTotal of 2000 USD in GHST for 4 Members, payed at the end of the month\n\nMany have stepped up to nominate as well as those I have spoken to myself.\n\nFollowing the passing of the proposal I suggest we hold a soft election off-chain to appoint actively participating members.\n\nI am deeply grateful for serving in this position for the last 3 Years, and look forward to the evolution of our roster!",

      "content": "Author: Dr. Wagmi (16635)\nQuorum Requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote Duration: 14 Days\n\nObjective:\nThis proposal aims to enhance the Aavegotchi DAO's treasury management through strategic staking, with a dual focus on accruing additional yield and increasing our Ethereum (ETH) holdings. We propose to engage in ETH staking through two prominent protocols, Lido and Rocket Pool, to achieve this objective.\n\n**Details of the Proposal:**\n\n1. **Staking with Lido:** We propose to stake 350 ETH directly with the Lido protocol. Lido currently offers an estimated yield of 3.7% per annum.\n\n2. **Acquiring rETH via Cowswap:** Concurrently, we propose to swap an additional 350 ETH for Rocket Pool's rETH using Cowswap. Rocket Pool's yield is approximately 2.94% per annum.\n\n3. **Expected Returns:** By adopting this strategy, we anticipate an annual yield of approximately 23.24 ETH, equating to a value of $70,000, based on the current ETH valuation of $3,000 per unit. \n\n4. **Risk Management:** This approach also involves splitting our smart contract risk between Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest entities in the ETH staking ecosystem. This strategy aims to balance the pursuit of optimal yield (via Lido) with robust participation in the Ethereum ecosystem (via Rocket Pool).\n\n5. **Remaining Treasury Funds:** Following this allocation, 537.96 ETH will remain unallocated within our treasury, available for other strategic initiatives or active management.\n\n**Context and Financial Overview:**\n\n- The Aavegotchi DAO presently holds 1237.96 ETH, acquired for $3,000,000 as per AGIP 103.\n- The current market value of this holding is approximately $3.7 million, representing an unrealized gain of $700,000 since the approval of the core proposal on January 2, 2024.\n- For transparency and ongoing monitoring, the DAO's treasury wallet is accessible at: (https://debank.com/profile/0x53c3CA81EA03001a350166D2Cc0fcd9d4c1b7B62).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis proposal is crafted with a view to optimize the Aavegotchi DAO's asset management, leveraging the potential of ETH staking for yield generation, while maintaining a balanced and risk-aware approach.",

      "content": "Author: Dr. Wagmi (16635)\nQuorum Requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote Duration: 14 Days\n\nObjective: This proposal is designed to strategically manage the Aavegotchi DAO's Ethereum (ETH) holdings by establishing a structured sell ladder. The aim is to maximize returns while mitigating the impacts of market volatility and psychology.\n\nDetails of the Sell Ladder Proposal:\n1.\tFirst Tranche: Sell 300 ETH in two equal parts within 24 hours if ETH valuation exceeds $8,000 per unit.\n2.\tSecond Tranche: Sell another 300 ETH in two equal parts within 24 hours at any ETH valuation above $10,000 per unit.\n3.\tThird Tranche: Sell 300 ETH in three equal parts within 24 hours if ETH valuation surpasses $12,000 per unit.\n4.\tFourth Tranche: Sell 300 ETH in three equal parts within 24 hours at any ETH valuation exceeding $15,000 per unit.\n\nExecution Strategy:\n•\tThe sale of ETH should follow a specific order from the DAO's Ethereum treasury wallet:\n•\tBegin with unstaked ETH.\n•\tProceed to rETH.\n•\tIf necessary, unstake stETH and sell the resulting ETH.\n•\tAll sold ETH will be exchanged for USDC (USD Coin).\n•\tThe acquired USDC will then be supplied to Aave, which currently offers over 1 billion USD in capacity.\n\nRationale and Transparency:\n•\tThis structured approach aims to provide clarity and predictability to DAO participants and investors.\n•\tIt helps in minimizing the influence of market psychology and speculative behavior, especially in a bullish market scenario.\n•\tAssuming ETH reaches a valuation greater than $15,000 per unit, this strategy positions the Aavegotchi DAO to accumulate approximately $13.5 million in USDC, significantly enhancing returns on the initial $3 million investment in ETH.\n\nConclusion: The proposed ETH sell ladder is a prudent financial strategy, offering the Aavegotchi DAO a methodical and transparent approach to realizing gains. It ensures that the DAO's assets are managed in a way that is both strategically sound and aligned with the interests of all stakeholders.",

      "content": "Author: Jesse | gldnXross#6482\nGotchiID: 4563\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 14 days\nXP Reward: 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\nDiscourse Thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1180534503828111471\n\n### New: \nPlease note the new specific KPIs and repayment strike prices documented in part 1 of the “Solution” section. \n\n## BACKGROUND\nWhen the GHST Bonding Curve closed in early 2023, our governance token lost its deepest liquidity pool (paired with DAI). To prepare for the coming loss of this GHST/DAI pool, Pixelcraft Studios took it upon themselves to lend a total of 300k GHST to Skynet Trading, a liquidity solutions company, to bolster liquidity on major exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase. \nSkynet Trading has successfully fulfilled its role as a market maker for GHST throughout 2023, consistently maintaining the most liquidity for GHST on Coinbase.\nThe loans that made this possible will soon expire but Skynet Trading is open to continuing to support GHST initiatives. I believe any future collaboration is something better suited to be executed by AavegotchiDAO.\nProposal\nWith the first year viewed as a sort of due diligence, I am now proposing that AavegotchiDAO replace Pixelcraft Studios with new loans to Skynet Trading, beginning with 600k GHST for 12 months explicitly to improve GHST’s liquidity on more centralized exchanges.\n\nSkynet Trading is dedicated to providing trading services that aim to reduce slippage by narrowing spreads, increase the accessibility of GHST by focusing on spread and depth key performance indicators, encourage organic trading through the development of attractive order books, and minimize the impact of large market orders.\nWhereas last year’s focus was primarily on Coinbase, a 600k-sized loan makes it possible for Skynet Trading to also provide liquidity on Binance, OKX, and HTX respectively. \n\n## The Problem: Poor liquidity on CEXs.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreify62wvqwodk5fixjxuq7xlkxcps2ndvga52othbxb5se7ltwz27m)\n    \nThis screenshot from coinmarketcap (Feb 9, 2024) illustrates the poor liquidity of GHST on exchanges. Most GHST pairs suffer from significantly thin books. This means GHST is inaccessible to people seeking medium to large allocations on most exchanges. Working with Skynet to improve liquidity across exchanges is a strategic move to foster a better trading environment for all participants interested in GHST tokens.\nSolution: \n### PART I: Loan Terms and Goals\nThis proposal is for AavegotchiDAO to lend 600k GHST to Skynet Trading for a 12 month term. The loaned GHST shall be used as liquidity provisions across four exchanges: Coinbase, Binance, OKX, and Huobi. \nSkynet Trading’s terms impose no retainer fee, no setup fee, or trading fees.\nNewly Published KPIs and Strike Price Formula:\nTight spreads: No greater than 50 bps.\nDeep order books: Minimum of 25 orders on both sides of the book. 10k USDT across \nRepayment strike price:\n-300k tokens @TWAP7 from start \n-150k tokens @TWAP7 from 3 months into the agreement\n-150k tokens @TWAP7 from 6 months into the agreement \n* The exact strike price formula was not included in the Sigprop but are now revealed per requests from DAO members and Skynet obliged. I can confirm the team has agreed to add the 3 and 6 month out terms in light of our concerns about frontloading all strike prices near the beginning of this potentially bullish year. \nAt the end of the 12 month term, Skynet Trading will have the option to A) return the 600k GHST to AavegotchiDAO or B) purchase the GHST at the strike prices as defined in this proposal.\n\n\n### PART II: Responsibilities\nThe second part of this proposal defines the relationship between AavegotchiDAO and Skynet Trading and who executes which responsibilities. The solution offered is the creation of a Liquidity Management Task Force (LMTF).\nThe Signer shall be a current director from Aavegotchi DAO Foundation willing to sign the contract between Skynet Lending and the Aavegotchi DAO Foundation. The Signer must be willing to KYC by providing liveness check and passport scans.\nThe Primary Point of Contact  (PPC) shall be the leadership team at Pixelcraft Studios. They shall continue to maintain daily contact between the two main parties and always advocate for the best interests of AavegotchiDAO and the spirit of this proposal. There is an existing communication channel between Pixelcraft Studios and Skynet Lending that will continue to serve as the main comms channel throughout this contract’s term. The PPC shall attend weekly DAO meetings when summoned and answer any questions raised by DAO members at those meetings. The PPC role can be transferred from Pixelcraft leadership to another party at any time via a DAO Role Change Vote (DRCV).\nThe process is simple. Any DAO member can create a Motion to Change Roles and then make the case via a snapshot vote. If the voting power in favor of the motion exceeds 9 million, the role shall be changed. This threshold is high enough to discourage any practical attack vectors yet completely within the realm of possibility if the will to enact is widely supported by DAO participants. \n\n\n### PART III: Order of Operations\nThe 600,000 value of GHST will come from the DAO’s Liquidity Wallet (Polygon: 0x62DE034b1A69eF853c9d0D8a33D26DF5cF26682E). The Liquidity Wallet currently holds no GHST but still has roughly 2.3M USD of stablecoins, so we shall use the autoswappper contract developed in AGIP 69 to buy these 600,000 GHST. \nSteps:\n1: Directors shall send 700K USDC to the autoswapper contract. \n2: Set the autoswapper’s buy amount to 6500 USDC and the buy interval to 2 Hours.\n3:  Execute the autoswapper. It shall accumulate 600k GHST in roughly 8 days. \n3.1: IF 700k USDC is not enough to purchase 600k GHST, the Directors shall calculate how much additional USDC is required and send those funds to the autoswapper contract as well. Their discretion is enough for up to an additional 100k USDC required, but anything beyond that will require unanimous approval during a weekly DAO meeting. Even one dissenting vote (expressed by emojis in Discord) during that meeting would render additional funds unobtainable. \n3.2: Any GHST accumulated beyond the required 600k shall remain on the Liquidity Wallet’s balances until the DAO decides some further actions for those funds.\n4. Skynet Trading presents the final executable contract to the Signer for review.\n5. If both the Signer finds the contract agreeable, the Signer shall sign.\n5.1 If the Signer finds details in the contract not aligning with our CoreProp, the Signer shall not sign and instead the process will revert back to negotiations between all parties.\n6. After signing, the Directors shall transfer 600k GHST to a wallet provided by Skynet Trading.\n7. The Primary Point of Contact shall begin interfacing with Skynet Trading to confirm receipt of the 600k GHST and the beginning of executing liquidity support across four exchanges.\n8. Skynet Trading shall provide a monthly report to the Primary Point of Contact who shall, in turn, share this report during the next weekly DAO call. \n9. This process shall continue throughout the 12 month term of the contract.\n10. Nearing the conclusion of the contract, Skynet Trading and the DAO can signal to each other whether or not each party wishes to re-engage for another agreement or not. \n### Risks\nI believe that the loan to Skynet Trading presents minimal risk, given the company's financial stability and reputation in the industry. \nAlthough Skynet Trading utilizes Fireblocks for institutional-grade custody solutions, risks associated with exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, HTX, and OKX remain present. It is important to note that Skynet Trading does not bear liability for any risks or losses incurred due to the operational aspects of these exchanges.\nWhile not a direct risk, it is prudent to acknowledge the possibility of ‘seller’s remorse’ should GHST values significantly surpass the contract’s strike prices within the next 12 months. The strike prices, set as either premiums or averages of future market rates, are designed to align the interests of both parties. Both parties must enter this agreement with a comprehensive understanding of the associated risks.\n### Benefits\nThe benefits and reasoning for this are already well fleshed out above but to briefly review:\nImproving liquidity on at least three additional exchanges improves the trading efficiency of the token.\nMaturing the relationship with an industry-leading company like Skynet Trading may also lead to indirect benefits such as introductions to more exchanges and more opportunities for future loans related to on-chain DEX support and even perps markets (Skynet Trading is open to advocating for GHST perps and can make introductions).\n### Conclusion\n\nFor the benefits noted above, I am proposing that now is the time for AavegotchiDAO to engage with Skynet Trading to improve the currently weak state of GHST liquidity on most of its current listed exchanges. \n\n\n### VOTE:\nShould AavegotchiDAO provide a 600k GHST loan to Skynet Trading for 12 months?",

      "title": "Establishing an ETH Sell Ladder",
      "content": "Author: Dr. Wagmi (16635)\nQuorum Requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote Duration: 14 Days\n\nObjective: This proposal is designed to strategically manage the Aavegotchi DAO's Ethereum (ETH) holdings by establishing a structured sell ladder. The aim is to maximize returns while mitigating the impacts of market volatility and psychology.\n\nDetails of the Sell Ladder Proposal:\n1.\tFirst Tranche: Sell 300 ETH in two equal parts within 24 hours if ETH valuation exceeds $8,000 per unit.\n2.\tSecond Tranche: Sell another 300 ETH in two equal parts within 24 hours at any ETH valuation above $10,000 per unit.\n3.\tThird Tranche: Sell 300 ETH in three equal parts within 24 hours if ETH valuation surpasses $12,000 per unit.\n4.\tFourth Tranche: Sell 300 ETH in three equal parts within 24 hours at any ETH valuation exceeding $15,000 per unit.\n\nExecution Strategy:\n•\tThe sale of ETH should follow a specific order from the DAO's Ethereum treasury wallet:\n•\tBegin with unstaked ETH.\n•\tProceed to rETH.\n•\tIf necessary, unstake stETH and sell the resulting ETH.\n•\tAll sold ETH will be exchanged for USDC (USD Coin).\n•\tThe acquired USDC will then be supplied to Aave, which currently offers over 1 billion USD in capacity.\n\nRationale and Transparency:\n•\tThis structured approach aims to provide clarity and predictability to DAO participants and investors.\n•\tIt helps in minimizing the influence of market psychology and speculative behavior, especially in a bullish market scenario.\n•\tAssuming ETH reaches a valuation greater than $15,000 per unit, this strategy positions the Aavegotchi DAO to accumulate approximately $13.5 million in USDC, significantly enhancing returns on the initial $3 million investment in ETH.\n\nConclusion: The proposed ETH sell ladder is a prudent financial strategy, offering the Aavegotchi DAO a methodical and transparent approach to realizing gains. It ensures that the DAO's assets are managed in a way that is both strategically sound and aligned with the interests of all stakeholders.",

      "content": "Author: Dr. Wagmi (16635)\nQuorum Requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote Duration: 14 Days\n\nObjective:\nThis proposal aims to enhance the Aavegotchi DAO's treasury management through strategic staking, with a dual focus on accruing additional yield and increasing our Ethereum (ETH) holdings. We propose to engage in ETH staking through two prominent protocols, Lido and Rocket Pool, to achieve this objective.\n\n**Details of the Proposal:**\n\n1. **Staking with Lido:** We propose to stake 350 ETH directly with the Lido protocol. Lido currently offers an estimated yield of 3.7% per annum.\n\n2. **Acquiring rETH via Cowswap:** Concurrently, we propose to swap an additional 350 ETH for Rocket Pool's rETH using Cowswap. Rocket Pool's yield is approximately 2.94% per annum.\n\n3. **Expected Returns:** By adopting this strategy, we anticipate an annual yield of approximately 23.24 ETH, equating to a value of $70,000, based on the current ETH valuation of $3,000 per unit. \n\n4. **Risk Management:** This approach also involves splitting our smart contract risk between Lido and Rocket Pool, the two largest entities in the ETH staking ecosystem. This strategy aims to balance the pursuit of optimal yield (via Lido) with robust participation in the Ethereum ecosystem (via Rocket Pool).\n\n5. **Remaining Treasury Funds:** Following this allocation, 537.96 ETH will remain unallocated within our treasury, available for other strategic initiatives or active management.\n\n**Context and Financial Overview:**\n\n- The Aavegotchi DAO presently holds 1237.96 ETH, acquired for $3,000,000 as per AGIP 103.\n- The current market value of this holding is approximately $3.7 million, representing an unrealized gain of $700,000 since the approval of the core proposal on January 2, 2024.\n- For transparency and ongoing monitoring, the DAO's treasury wallet is accessible at: (https://debank.com/profile/0x53c3CA81EA03001a350166D2Cc0fcd9d4c1b7B62).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis proposal is crafted with a view to optimize the Aavegotchi DAO's asset management, leveraging the potential of ETH staking for yield generation, while maintaining a balanced and risk-aware approach.",

Then, from Season 9 onwards, more complexity/variations will be added so that simulations will be too computationally expensive to be worth it.\n\n***\n\n\nHello frens,\n\nWe've been blown away and deeply humbled by all the enthusiasm and support for Gotchi Battler over the last few weeks. We're starting this proposal to deliver on the promise of evolving protocol rewards through the addition of Gotchi Battler as a staple of our Rarity Farming seasons going forward.\n\nThe proposed changes to Rarity Farming Rewards are:\n**Season 8**\n| Category       | Previous Split | New Split |\n|----------------|----------------|-----------|\n| BRS            | 70%            | 60%       |\n| Gotchi Battler | 0%             | 10%       |\n| Kinship        | 20%            | 20%       |\n| XP             | 10%            | 10%       |\n\n\n**Season 9 onwards**\n| Category       | Previous Split | New Split |\n|----------------|----------------|-----------|\n| BRS            | 70%            | 50%       |\n| Gotchi Battler | 0%             | 20%       |\n| Kinship        | 20%            | 20%       |\n| XP             | 10%            | 10%       |\n\n\nIn line with the original Gotchi Battler proposal [AGIP 86] to gamify protocol rewards, we wish to reallocate 10% from the BRS leaderboard to Gotchi Battler Tournaments for season 8 and 20% from the BRS leaderboard for Season 9 and onwards. Gotchi Battler was designed with this exact purpose in mind to carry on the meta of the BRS leaderboard as much as possible whilst also providing a more engaging and competitive experience for players.\n\nThere's been a tonne of amazing discussion on this already in the forums and I've summarised a list of Frequently Asked Questions below:\n\n## FAQs\n**Why not fund Gotchi battler tournaments outside of RF?**  \nAt this point in time, when there is no significant revenue being generated by the DAO, it would not be prudent to increase our yearly reward spend of 4.5M GHST any further. Instead, we should be looking to make better use of the money we are already spending to further engage existing community members and attract new users to the ecosystem. As well as that, using the regular and predictable cadence of rewards from Rarity Farming seasons ensures the future health of Gotchi Battler and gives buyers and renters confidence to invest for the game.\n\n**Will this lower my RF rewards?**  \nGotchi Battler aims to carry on the meta of the BRS leaderboard as much as possible. However, there is an element of skill and luck involved. Due to this, you may end up earning more or less rewards than the BRS leaderboard depending on your luck/skill but on average you should earn an equivalent amount. If you don't have 5 gotchis to enter a team you can either rent gotchis for your team or lend yours out at a much higher rate than usual during the tournament.\n\n**What happens if this prop doesn't pass?**  \nIf the proposal doesn't pass it means 2 things. Firstly, that Gotchi Battler as a project has failed to achieve it's main objective, meaning it would either have to source extra reward funds at huge expense to the DAO/rewards wallet, or go back to the drawing board. Secondly, if a game that the DAO funded to gamify Rarity Farming isn't voted to do so then it's safe to assume that Rarity Farming as an entity will continue to go in its current form. The benefit in this scenario is that DAO discussion and resources can now shift to other areas, understanding that the current rewards paradigm is staying fixed for the foreseeable future.\n\nHead over to the forum post below for further discussion and thank you, as always, for your support frens.",

When empty, directors can ask for a refill.\n\nSigner addresses:\n0x92B908c078D8f8a2271b1EE7cFf583405618771B\n0x61Cec7155ffF2EcbcC28eEdd16b055794929fBBa\n0x251B594d2f6fAFA9903E0aE61186cA0B14F3aD29\n0xd0De01420788632a9d2286eeBDf4f0CeA88187B7\n0xa2D623315C16ACCb86B0E15A2B385A43A4032F79\n0xe1Da02bAD2E6a1c931b0C4f41006138De6dC2Aa0\n0x7a002eCfB15bfad105ecdD60022D747A19Df252c\n0xc6055aeE74Ca070BbAf93d1C3C92843512E41987\n0x0F469AF9E3d7402e9d5990AFD9B97ca9924a1231\n\n(Note : The directors will only use this gas to sign DAO TXs.)\n(Note 2 : The directors will give back the remaining funds use for gas in case directors step down from their roles.)\n(Note 3 \"Retroactive gas reimbursement\" : to be more equitable, the directors will be able to claim the funds used for transaction expenses that were funded by themselves before the date of the approval of this vote as core proposal.)",

      "title": "Sigprop: Lend 600k GHST to improve liquidity and orderbooks on major CEXs",
      "content": "Author: Jesse | gldnXross#6482\nGotchiID: 4563\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 14 days\nXP Reward: 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\nDiscourse Thread: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1180534503828111471\n\n**BACKGROUND**\nWhen the GHST Bonding Curve closed in early 2023, our governance token lost its deepest liquidity pool. To prepare for the coming loss of this GHST/DAI pool, Pixelcraft Studios took it upon themselves to lend a total of 300k GHST to Skynet Trading, a liquidity solutions company, to bolster liquidity on major exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase. As part of this initiative, Skynet Trading contributed the necessary USDT to improve the liquidity and close the spreads, thereby ensuring a more stable, safe and efficient trading environment for GHST.\n\nSkynet Trading has successfully fulfilled its role as a market maker for GHST throughout the entire year of 2023. Both parties involved have expressed a high level of satisfaction with the partnership. Skynet Trading has primarily supported liquidity on Coinbase. Skynet Trading merges its respected status with extensive institutional trading experience with an exemplary reputation and commitment to compliance and market integrity.\n\nThe loans that made this possible will soon expire but Skynet Trading is prepared to continue to support GHST. We believe the next such loans are something better suited to be executed by AavegotchiDAO.\n\n**PROPOSAL**\nWith the first year viewed as a sort of due diligence, I am now proposing that AavegotchiDAO replace Pixelcraft Studios with new loans to Skynet Trading, beginning with 600k GHST for 12 months explicitly to improve GHST’s liquidity on more centralized exchanges.\n\nSkynet Trading is dedicated to providing trading services that aim to reduce slippage by narrowing spreads, increase the accessibility of GHST by focusing on spread and depth key performance indicators, encourage organic trading through the development of attractive order books, and minimize the impact of large market orders.\n\nWhereas last year’s focus was primarily on Coinbase, a 600k-sized loan makes it possible for Skynet Trading to also provide liquidity on Binance, OKX and HTX respectively. \n\n**THE PROBLEM: Poor liquidity on the majority of CEXs that GHST is listed on.**\n \n![1D204B90-A310-4BF5-9532-89D94C782E63.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeie7yqmajkscbfogt2m2a3bvssxvo5omvmpu7wqlhtzqhv5fyrsoe4)\n    \nThis screenshot from cmc (Feb 9, 2024) shows the amount of GHST buys and sells it would take to move the price 2% in either direction as well as cmc’s “liquidity score”. \n\nIt is evident most pairs suffer from thin books. This means GHST is inaccessible to most people seeking medium to large allocations on most exchanges. By lending Skynet Trading tokens, we can substantially improve liquidity. This strategic move will foster a safer and more reliable trading environment for all participants interested in trading GHST tokens.\n\n**THE SOLUTION**\n \n**PART I of PROPOSAL: Loan Terms and Goals**\n\nLend 600k GHST to Skynet Trading for a 12 month term. Loaned GHST shall be used as provisions across four exchanges: Coinbase, Binance, OKX, and Huobi. \n\nSkynet Trading’s terms impose no retainer fee or trading fees. The loan shall be realized in three tranches of 200k GHST per. Each tranche will have its own strike price based on premium and/or future token prices. For example, the first strike price may be a rolling average of the token price across a certain number of days while another strike price may be SPOT + a percentage premium of 5 or 10%. \n\nExact strike prices will not be publicly available so only the Signer of the Agreement and the Primary Point of Contact (see PART II of proposal) will have eyes on what these rates are. The examples above are accurate representations of the type of strike prices we can expect. \n\nAt the end of the 12 month term, Skynet Trading will have the option to A) return the 600k GHST to AavegotchiDAO or B) purchase the GHST at the strike prices established in the three tranche strike prices determined at time of signing.\n\n**PART II of PROPOSAL: Responsibilities**\n\nThe Signer shall be a current director from Aavegotchi DAO Foundation willing to sign the contract between Skynet Lending and the Aavegotchi DAO Foundation. The Signer must be willing to KYC by providing liveness check and passport scans.\n\nThe Primary Point of Contact  (PPC) shall be Pixelcraft Studios. They shall continue to maintain contact between the two main parties and always advocate for the best interests of AavegotchiDAO. There is an existing communication channel between Pixelcraft and Skynet that will continue throughout this contract’s term. The PPC shall attend weekly DAO meetings when summoned and answer any questions raised by DAO members at those meetings. The PPC role can be transferred from Pixelcraft leadership to another party at any time via a DAO Role Change Vote (DRCV).\n\nAny DAO member can create a Motion to Change Roles and make official via a snapshot vote. If the voting power in favor of the motion exceeds 9 million, the role shall be changed. This threshold is high enough to discourage any practical attack vectors yet completely within the realm of possibility if the will to enact is widely supported by DAO participants. \n\nHaving already worked with the Skynet team for over one year, I find Pixelcraft Studios serving as the PPC to be a very practical solution. That said, it is important to define a mechanism for transfer of this role in the spirit of decentralization. \n\n**PART III of PROPOSAL: Funding and Order of Operations**\nThe 600k GHST for the loan will come from the DAO’s Liquidity Wallet (Polygon: 0x62DE034b1A69eF853c9d0D8a33D26DF5cF26682E). The Liquidity Wallet currently holds no GHST but still has roughly 2.3M USD of stablecoins, so we shall use the autoswappper contract developed in AGIP 69 to buy these 600,000 GHST. \n\nSteps:\n1: Directors shall send 700K USDC to the autoswapper contract. \n\n2: Set the autoswapper’s buy amount to 6500 USDC and the buy interval to 2 Hours.\n\n3:  Execute the autoswapper. It shall accumulate 600k GHST in roughly 8 days. \n\n3.1: IF 700k USDC is not enough to purchase 600k GHST, the Directors shall calculate how much additional USDC is required and send those funds to the autoswapper contract as well. Their discretion is enough for up to an additional 100k USDC required, but anything beyond that will require unanimous approval during a weekly DAO meeting. Even one dissenting vote (expressed by emojis in Discord) during that meeting would render additional funds unobtainable. \n\n3.2: Any GHST accumulated beyond the required 600k shall remain on the Liquidity Wallet’s balances until the DAO decides some further actions for those funds.\n\n4. Skynet Trading presents the final executable contract to the Signer and Primary Point of Contact for review. This contract contains sensitive information such as strike prices that are not to be disclosed to the rest of the DAO or public.\n\n5. If both the Signer and the Primary Point of Contact find the contract agreeable, the Signer shall sign and proceed to step 6. \n\n5.1 If either the Signer or the Primary Point of Contact find questions or concerns with details in the contract, the Signer shall not sign and instead the process will revert back to negotiations between all parties.\n\n6. After signing of the contract, the Directors shall transfer 600k GHST to a wallet provided by Skynet Trading in the contract.\n\n7. The Primary Point of Contact shall begin interfacing with Skynet Trading to confirm receipt of the 600k GHST and the beginning of executing liquidity support across four exchanges.\n\n8. Skynet Trading shall provide a monthly report to the Primary Point of Contact who shall, in turn, share this report during the next weekly DAO call. \n\n9. This process of reporting and adjusting strategies per DAO feedback shall continue throughout the 12 month term of the contract with Skynet Trading. \n\n10. Nearing the conclusion of the contract, Skynet Trading and the DAO can signal to each other whether or not each party wishes to re-engage for another agreement or not. The PPC will help facilitate this conversation between the two parties. \n\n**RISKS**\nThe loan presents minimal risk, given Skynet's reputation in the industry. \n\nAlthough Skynet utilizes Fireblocks for institutional-grade custody solutions, risks associated with exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, HTX, and OKX remain present. It is important to note that Skynet Trading does not bear liability for any risks or losses incurred due to the operational aspects of these exchanges.\n\nIt is prudent to acknowledge the possibility of ‘seller’s remorse’ should GHST values significantly surpass the contract’s strike prices within the next 12 months. The strike prices are designed to align the interests of both parties. Both parties must enter this agreement with a comprehensive understanding of the associated risks.\n\n**BENEFITS**\nThe benefits are established: Improve liquidity on 4 exchanges.\n\nMaturing the relationship with an industry-leading company like Skynet Trading may also lead to indirect benefits such as introductions to more exchanges and more opportunities for future loans related to on-chain DEX support and even perps markets (Skynet Trading is open to advocating for GHST perps and can make introductions).\n\n**CONCLUSION**\nFor the benefits noted above, I propose that now is the time for AavegotchiDAO to engage with Skynet Trading to improve the current state of GHST liquidity on most of its current listed exchanges. \n\nSkynet Trading has proven to be professional, compliant, ethical, and transparent experts in their field that can greatly benefit our governance cornerstone, GHST token. \n\nPlease note, regarding KYB, there will need to be 1 KYC’d director and a number of documents. The directors have already confirmed these KYB processes are achievable.",

We received limited but valuable information about the experience. It’s important to note it reflects the vision of Aavegotchi Native community member: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOKbJm8oLUzo-SgiYIY2rhwMOgb56AH9wiwL9AbYm0lG3SjA/viewform?usp=sf_link\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreietzdkw4estnik7caodb3vsggyq4onhmowdmr65wddcmkcyben4hy)\n\nAbout TheSandbox Team and community, we got tremendous returns. TheSandbox was shocked by the richness of Aavegotchi ecosystem and Lore applied in their voxeled environnement. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis project scope of work Supported by the DAO was established as follow :\n--\n\n_1) Creation of a Sandbox Single player experience providing :_\n- Educational content about Aavegotchi\n- Aavegotchi Lore exploration\n- Cross universe Aavegotchi Artistic creation\n\n_2) Second: One Multiplayer experience_ \n- Bêta test of TheSandbox 0.9 Gamemaker Version Multiplayer features\n- To be delivered early 2024\n\n_3) Organization of incentives around the project_\n\n_4) Aavegotchi x The Sandbox AMA_\n \n \n**GFA decided to go further by achieving unscheduled/ out of scope milestones:**\n-\n>- Forge an official partnership between Aavegotchi and TheSandbox\n>- Bridge of gotchis as Official TheSandbox Aavegotchi Aavatar Collection\n>- Negotiations to gain access to top tier (VIP) partner communication by TheSandbox on social media concerning the release\n>- Creation of 3 full OG equipment sets (Sandbox Marketplace)\n>- IRL event Hosted in TheSandbox Office in Paris\n>- The Enigma Odyssey (300+ contestants)\n>- RIPPLES OF THE GOTCHIVERSE Graphic Novel (To be delivered soon)\n\n\nEntrusted by the Licence IP signed with Aavegotchi, GFA community made the choice to lean over the revenue share repartition even if the initial proposal only mentioned 10% Royalty to Pixelcraft Studio. \n\nDifferent types of revenues are generated through this project : Direct and indirect returns.\n\nAbout Direct financial returns, here is the repartition GFA decided to apply :\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiehmwjp57m276npqnk4xcfd33bmxm2dero7uedys5wt2zetjemvxm)\n\n\n\nSo far, around 13500 SAND tokens sales has been generated. DAO Share was delivered in December (7 425 SAND). Multiplayer Experience is empowered to generate more of those.\n\nAbout Indirect revenues, please find below the stats of the single experience release engagement : \n_**1) TheSandbox**_\n- Social engagement\n- Good overall engagement on sandbox announcement tweets\n- Good visibility of Aavegotchi community to TheSandbox userbase\n- Good average in-game numbers (KYC Accounts)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicuqvruassjxlpauiud3qoyadj4iookv7oy4hzlrctnrssurbcrn4)\n_**2) Aavegotchi**_\n- Some of the best Aavegotchi tweets of 2023 (around 90k + views)\n- Forge an alliance with top Web3 brend (TheSandbox)\n\nWith the great impact this initiative had, it’s now official, as discussed during the last Hangout and AMA, Aavegotchi made the choice to get some lands (1 Estate 3x3) in TheSandbox. It Gives the possibility to Selfpublish Aavegotchi experiences beeing playable without interruption.\n\nHere is the location of Aavegotchi 3x3 Estate owned by Pixelcraft : \nhttps://www.sandbox.game/en/map/?lat=82&lng=-158&zoom=4&x=-158&y=82\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProposal of Funding\n-\nThis proposal of funding is to empower GFA to operate Pixelcraft lands and partnership for a limited and renewable 6 months duration with as follows duties : \n\n1) Management of Project and Coordination\n2) Partnership Management\n- Maintain channel of discussion with Sandbox officers like Sebastien Borget\n- Upgrades of Aavegotchi avatar collection in Sandbox \n- Aavegotchi Assets collection utility and highlight in game\n3) Experience Updates\n- Management of Aavegotchi Parcels in Sandbox + Collect & analysis of InGame and Traffic datas with TheSandbox\n- Upgrades and modifications of experiences due to Sandbox New GameMaker and GameClient release (Forecasted Bi-Monthly for 0.9 minor versions) and specific events\n- Interaction in the Slack Technical support with Sandbox Team and ticketing system\n\n4) Organisation and Strategy for futur events \n- InGame contests / Social events\n- Maintain & highlight Aavegotchi in next mainstream Sandbox events like ie. alpha seasons / IRL events\n\n\nPlease note: the single player experience has been migrated to the latest 0.9.10 Gameclient version and is fully operative as covered!\n\n>The overall budget breakdown to achieve those tasks for the 6 months duration of this proposal is 29 460 DAI\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeigysvfidiravdfkkruawlfv2dum4jfidtpkbilnmc5dznwja5dt2i)\n    \n\nWe would suggest a monthly payment to be delivered each beginning of month.\n\nThanks Frens for your attention and your support.",

      "content": "Author: Bearded\nGotchi ID: 13536\n\nIn Rarity Farming Season 7, the DAO gave out a total of 1.6 million GHST in rewards. For the first time, Gotchi Battler was included as part of the rewards, with 100,000 GHST being awarded to an initial set of Gotchi Battler tournaments which are still ongoing. This resulted in 65% of the total rewards going to the BRS leaderboard, 18.7% going to kinship, 9% going to XP, and 6% going to Gotchi Battler.\n\nIn a recent SigProp (https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/0x6714bd532f3bca44a2a92c221d3b57f51682c57047f15505a1205493b7ee4cbf), the DAO was presented with a yes/no vote to include Gotchi Battler as a permanent feature in future rarity farming seasons. The vote did not reference season 8, and included the option to shift 20% of total rewards from the BRS leaderboard to Gotchi Battler. This would result in a roughly 30% decrease in rewards being distributed to the BRS leaderboard. The proposal, which passed sigprop, has not gone to coreprop status.\n\nRecent discussion in the DAO discussion thread for an upcoming rarity farming season 8 has resulted in various opinions as to the extent of the rewards that should be allocated to Gotchi Battler in season 8, and where the rewards should be taken from. This proposal gauges the DAO’s interest in various options. It is not a stand-alone SigProp, and it will be consolidated into a future Rarity Farming Season 8 SigProp.\n\nOptions:\n\nOption 1: No reduction in BRS rewards, fund Gotchi Battler independently of Rarity Farming\nOption 2: Allocate 10% of total rewards to Gotchi Battler, taken solely from BRS\nOption 3: Allocate 20% of total rewards to Gotchi Battler, taken solely from BRS\nOption 4: Further discussion needed (please provide note when voting -- i.e., \"should take from XP and kinship also\", etc)",

The proposal, which passed sigprop, has not gone to coreprop status. \n\nRecent discussion in the DAO discussion thread for an upcoming rarity farming season 8 has resulted in various opinions as to the extent of the rewards that should be allocated to Gotchi Battler in season 8, and where the rewards should be taken from. This proposal acts as a formal poll gauging the DAO’s interest in various options. It is not a stand-alone SigProp requiring quorum, as it will be consolidated into a future Rarity Farming Season 8 SigProp. \n\nOptions:\n- Option 1: No reduction in BRS rewards, fund Gotchi Battler independently of Rarity Farming \n- Option 2: Allocate 10% of total rewards to Gotchi Battler, taken solely from BRS\n- Option 3: Allocate 20% of total rewards to Gotchi Battler, taken solely from BRS\n- Option 4: Further discussion needed (please provide note when voting -- i.e., \"should take from XP and kinship also\", etc)",

When empty, directors can ask for a refill.\n\n**Signer addresses**: \n0x92B908c078D8f8a2271b1EE7cFf583405618771B\n0x61Cec7155ffF2EcbcC28eEdd16b055794929fBBa\n0x251B594d2f6fAFA9903E0aE61186cA0B14F3aD29\n0xd0De01420788632a9d2286eeBDf4f0CeA88187B7\n0xa2D623315C16ACCb86B0E15A2B385A43A4032F79\n0xe1Da02bAD2E6a1c931b0C4f41006138De6dC2Aa0\n0x7a002eCfB15bfad105ecdD60022D747A19Df252c\n0xc6055aeE74Ca070BbAf93d1C3C92843512E41987\n0x0F469AF9E3d7402e9d5990AFD9B97ca9924a1231\n\n(Note : The directors will only use this gas to sign DAO TXs.)\n(Note 2 : The directors will give back the remaining funds use for gas in case directors step down from their roles.)\n(Note 3 \"Retroactive gas reimbursement\" : to be more equitable, the directors will be able to claim the funds used for transaction expenses that were funded by themselves before the date of the approval of this vote as core proposal.)",

      "title": "Gotchi Battler Protocol Rewards",
      "content": "Authors: Immaterial  \nGotchiIDs: 13681  \nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)  \nVote duration: 7 days  \nDiscussion: [https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1201505887169286276](https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1201505887169286276)\n\nHello frens,\n\nWe've been blown away and deeply humbled by all the enthusiasm and support for Gotchi Battler over the last few weeks. We're starting this proposal to deliver on the promise of evolving protocol rewards through the addition of Gotchi Battler as a staple of our Rarity Farming seasons going forward.\n\nThe proposed changes to Rarity Farming Rewards are:\n\n| Category \t\t\t| Previous split\t| New Split\t| \n|-------------------|-------------------|-----------| \n| BRS \t\t\t\t| 70% \t\t\t\t| 50% \t\t| \n| Gotchi Battler\t| 0% \t\t\t\t| 20% \t\t| \n| Kinship \t\t\t| 20% \t\t\t\t| 20% \t\t| \n| XP \t\t\t\t| 10% \t\t\t\t| 10%\t\t|\n\nIn line with the original Gotchi Battler proposal [AGIP 86] to gamify protocol rewards, we wish to reallocate 20% from the BRS leaderboard to Gotchi Battler Tournaments each season going forward. Gotchi Battler was designed with this exact purpose in mind to carry on the meta of the BRS leaderboard as much as possible whilst also providing a more engaging and competitive experience for players. \n\nThere's been a tonne of amazing discussion on this already in the forums and I've summarised a list of Frequently Asked Questions below:\n\nFAQs\n\n**Why not fund Gotchi battler tournaments outside of RF?**\nAt this point in time, when there is no significant revenue being generated by the DAO, it would not be prudent to increase our yearly reward spend of 4.5M GHST any further. Instead, we should be looking to make better use of the money we are already spending to further engage existing community members and attract new users to the ecosystem. As well as that, using the regular and predictable cadence of rewards from Rarity Farming seasons ensures the future health of Gotchi Battler and gives buyers and renters confidence to invest for the game.\n\n**Will this lower my RF rewards?**\nGotchi Battler aims to carry on the meta of the BRS leaderboard as much as possible. However, there is an element of skill and luck involved. Due to this, you may end up earning more or less rewards than the BRS leaderboard depending on your luck/skill but on average you should earn an equivalent amount. If you don't have 5 gotchis to enter a team you can either rent gotchis for your team or lend yours out at a much higher rate than usual during the tournament.\n\n**What happens if this prop doesn't pass?**\nIf the proposal doesn't pass it means 2 things. Firstly, that Gotchi Battler as a project has failed to achieve it's main objective, meaning it would either have to source extra reward funds at huge expense to the DAO/rewards wallet, or go back to the drawing board. Secondly, if a game that the DAO funded to gamify Rarity Farming isn't voted to do so then it's safe to assume that Rarity Farming as an entity will continue to go in its current form. The benefit in this scenario is that DAO discussion and resources can now shift to other areas, understanding that the current rewards paradigm is staying fixed for the foreseeable future.\n\nHead over to the forum post below for further discussion and thank you, as always, for your support frens.",

      "content": "Author: Hefe (2400), Fifoo(11008), NationalBank(9266), CryptoGotchi(8612), PG(4895)\nQuorum Requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote Duration: 14 Days\nReference Material: Aavegotchi Grants Operations and Procedures:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQjKItH9VTif3spQ61TqBSycKT91OvINuM5rHDpK_cU/edit?usp=sharing\n\nSummary/TLDR;\nThe Aavegotchi Grants program (AGP) aims to serve as a catalyst for innovation and growth within the Aavegotchi ecosystem. The Mission of the AGP would be to provide viable community ideas and projects with the financial resources to flourish from inception to implementation. The overarching goal is a community-led, transparent process for connecting developers/creators/innovators with resources needed to go from idea to funded development. \n\nPurpose/Rationale\nThe Aavegotchi community is made up of a wide array of stakeholders; project team/contributors, token holders, asset holders, players/users and partners. The goal for the AGP is to nurture Aavegotchi’s ecosystem to benefit all of these stakeholders. To be more specific, the grants program aims to do the following:\n\n-Drive the growth of the Aavegotchi ecosystem by financially backing development projects that contribute to its expansion.\n\n-Support projects leveraging Gotchichain, enhancing the variety of gaming experiences and fostering inter-game player interaction.\n\n-Boost community engagement by funding projects originating within the community, thereby encouraging active participation and a sense of shared ownership.\n\n-Foster innovation and creativity by offering support and resources to smaller-scale projects, sparking new ideas that benefit the entire ecosystem.\n\nProgram Scope\n\nThe AGP will focus on supporting projects with a funding ceiling of $50,000. These projects will adhere to stringent reporting standards and guidelines to ensure transparency and accountability. Key aspects include a detailed process for project evaluation and selection, a tiered funding system, regular monitoring of project progress, ongoing communication with the community for feedback and engagement, and adaptations to the program based on community input.\n\nCommittee members\nTeam Lead (Fifoooo): Responsible for overall leadership, strategic direction, and coordination of the DTF 2.0 team.\n\nProject Managers (Fifoooo / NationalBank): Oversee the implementation of projects, ensuring they align with set goals, timelines, and budgets.\n\nFinancial Analyst (NationalBank): Manages budgeting, financial planning, and reporting, ensuring transparency and efficient use of funds.\n\nTechnical Advisors (PG, CryptoGotchi): Provide insights on technical aspects of projects, ensuring feasibility and sustainability of technological implementations.\n\nFacilitator/Community Liaison (Hefe): Facilitates communication between involved parties and engages with the broader DAO community, gathering feedback while promoting transparency. \n\nBudget and Committee compensation\n\nCommittee compensation:\nPersonnel costs amount to a total maximum of 10,000 USD per month across all AGP members. The first three months will be paid at an equal rate, transitioning to a capped  hourly rate (hours worked) in the second quarter. At no point will the total personnel costs exceed 10,000 USD per month.\n\nBudget\nThis proposal outlines two budget selections with pro’s and cons for each;\n- A larger budget to fund more viable projects and ideas, higher initial cost.\n\n- A smaller budget is fiscally beneficial to the DAO, would mean being more selective when presented with many viable projects and ideas.\n\nOption 1:\n200,000 USD for funding projects, ideas and initiatives\n10,000 USD in Personnel costs for Six months, totalling 60,000 USD\nOperational expenses (tooling) for six months, 3,000 USD\nTotal Budget 263,000 USD\n\nOption 2:\n100,000 USD for funding projects, ideas and initiatives\n10,000 USD in Personnel costs for Six months, 60,000 USD\nOperational expenses (tooling) for six months, 3,000 USD\nTotal Budget 163,000 USD \n\nThe total amount would be disbursed as $GHST, priced in USD at the time of the proposal concluding. Disbursed to the AGP Multi-sig.\n\nWhat does success look like?\nSuccess of the program would be measured against the following criteria:\n\nMeasurable Criteria:\n- Growth in the number of projects, ideas, and events funded and delivered\n- The number of funded initiatives scaling to stand-alone proposals going through Aavegotchi DAO\n- The number of funded projects and initiatives scaling on Gotchichain\n- Growth in the overall player base and DAU through funded projects\n- The number of projects funded by the AG that involves ecosystem newcomers.\n\nSubjective criteria:\n- Improved sentiment and goodwill within the community\n- Improvement to Aavegotchi’s brand and positioning in the market\n\nConclusion \n\nThe AGP is committed to continuous incremental improvements to our guidelines and procedures to ensure the program will be a great success. We will utilize the weekly DAO meetings to work transparently and in line with the DAO’s sentiment.\n\nAfter the first 6 months, the AGP will publish a full report with its overall results. Measurable and Subjective criteria will be outlined in the report. Community feedback will serve as a core aspect influencing the evolution of the AGP on a continuous basis after the trial period ends. \n\nThank you for considering our proposal, appreciate all your feedback.",

With an average supply APR of 4.34%, this move aims to generate an annual yield of approximately $154,061, enhancing the DAO's revenue through a stable, high-yield strategy. The proposal ensures over 500,000 DAI remains in the DAO's Polygon wallet for ongoing initiatives, while the rest of the DAI is strategically supplied to Aave. All supplied DAI comes from the 25% post curve closure Treasury Allocation.\n\nProposed Porfolio Composition Assuming AGIP 103 Passes\nProposed Portfolio\tUSD Value\nGHST (0.904)\t15017760.91\nUSDC\t3756276\nSupplied DAI\t3549809\nUnsupplied DAI\t2337064\nETH (not yet purchased)\t3000000\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicewwnivw2wh2an3ccjjqyt4jcgyrvqif3dhvxreyv6jqdrhspvb4)\n    \nBenefits:\n1.\tPassive Income: Leverages a stable, high-yield avenue for revenue generation without active management.\n2.\tFlexibility: Easy entry and exit strategies for the supplied positions, offering liquidity management benefits.\n3.\tMarket Optimism: Positions the DAO to capitalize on the anticipated increased demand for stablecoins in an upcoming bull market.\n4.\tDiversification: Broadens the DAO's investment portfolio and protects our stablecoins against inflation by generating yield.\n\nRisks:\n1.\tPlatform Dependence: Relies heavily on the Aave ecosystem and the stability of its smart contracts, introducing platform-specific risks.\n2.\tLiquidity Constraints: Future proposals may require accessing funds from the supplied DAI if the Polygon treasury depletes, potentially affecting liquidity.\n3.\tMarket Volatility: Exposure to market fluctuations could affect the APR and overall returns.\n4.\tSmart Contract Vulnerabilities: Despite Aave's track record, the risk of smart contract bugs or exploits remains inherent in DeFi protocols.\n\nThe proposal represents a balanced approach to revenue generation and risk management, aiming to strengthen the Aavegotchi DAO's financial position while maintaining operational flexibility.\n\nDr Wagmi",

      "title": "Lend 600k GHST to improve liquidity and orderbooks on major CEXs",
      "content": "Author: Jesse | gldnXross#6482\n\nGotchiID: 4563\n\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\n\nVote duration: 14 days\n\nXP Reward: 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n\nDiscussion Thread:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1180534503828111471\n\n**BACKGROUND**\nWhen the GHST Bonding Curve closed in early 2023, our governance token lost its deepest liquidity pool (paired with DAI). To prepare for the coming loss of this GHST/DAI pool, Pixelcraft Studios took it upon themselves to lend a total of 300k GHST to Skynet Trading, a liquidity solutions company, to bolster liquidity on major exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase. As part of this initiative, Skynet Trading contributed the necessary USDT to improve the liquidity and close the spreads, thereby ensuring a more stable, safe and efficient trading environment for GHST.\n\nSkynet Trading has successfully fulfilled its role as a market maker and liquidity provider for GHST throughout the entire year of 2023, operating under a loan agreement in collaboration with Pixelcraft Studios. Both parties involved have expressed a high level of satisfaction with the loan agreement and its outcomes. Skynet Trading has been the majority of liquidity for GHST on Coinbase. Skynet Trading merges its respected status with extensive institutional trading experience with an exemplary reputation and commitment to compliance and market integrity.\n\nThe loans that made this possible will soon expire but Skynet Trading has expressed interest in continuing to support GHST initiatives. While the loan has served its purpose and Skynet Trading its performance is everything Pixelcraft Studios hoped for, we believe the next such loans are something better suited to be executed by AavegotchiDAO represented by the AavegotchiDAO Foundation.\n\n**PROPOSAL**\nWith the first year viewed as a sort of due diligence, I am now proposing that AavegotchiDAO replace Pixelcraft Studios with new loans to Skynet Trading, beginning with 600k GHST for 12 months explicitly to improve GHST’s liquidity on more centralized exchanges. Other potential loans are expected to be crafted with their own proposals by myself or anyone else on an as needed basis.\n\nSkynet Trading is dedicated to providing trading services that aim to reduce slippage by narrowing spreads, increase the accessibility of GHST by focusing on spread and depth key performance indicators, encourage organic trading through the development of attractive order books, and minimize the impact of large market orders.\n\nWhereas last year’s focus was primarily on Coinbase, a 600k-sized loan makes it possible for Skynet Trading to also provide liquidity on OKX and HTX respectively.\n\nThe second part of this proposal defines how the relationship between AavegotchiDAO and Skynet should be managed. We propose a Liquidity Management Task Force (LMTF).\n\nBased on community feedback on recent DAO calls and in Discord, there seems to be support for AavegotchiDAO to handle making the transfers of GHST tokens but to entrust Pixelcraft Studios with representing AavegotchiDAO as the main point of contact with Skynet Trading. In this way, the LMTF will be co-chaired by AavegotchiDAO Foundation (the signers of multisig to transfer funds) and Pixelcraft Studios’ leadership (the entity tasked with being the main point of contact with Skynet).\n\nI am personally neutral on whether or not Pixelcraft Studios serves on the task force. Having Pixelcraft serve as main contact is more work for us and serves no benefit to us (as whoever accepts this role has a fiduciary responsibility to AavegotchiDAO). That said, I am familiar with Skynet team communicating for over one year and it is really not a heavy lift so I’m fine with Pixelcraft Studios serving as the Liquidity Management Task Force’s lead until further notice. Ideally, a new individual or team can step up in due time to replace Pixelcraft in this role, as we continue to transfer authorities to the DAO and focus our energies on gaming products.\n\n**THE PROBLEM**\n\nThe problem is poor liquidity on the majority of CEXs that GHST is listed on.\ncmc ghst liquidity.png \n![image](ipfs://bafkreian4qu5m6n7sno7xfdqjz4q7q3uq3vubjjazaqgxo37oukzkq6rou)\n    \nThis screenshot from coinmarketcap (Dec 16, 2023) shows the amount of GHST buys and sells it would take to move the price 2% in either direction (slippage). While Binance is good and Coinbase is OK, most suffer from significantly thin books and volatility. For instance, in the above image, Gate.io looks good at north of 9k USD but watch it over a week and you will see how often the 2% slippage number drops significantly lower. \n\nLong story short, GHST is inaccessible to those seeking medium to large allocations on most exchanges listing the token. By lending Skynet Trading tokens, we can substantially improve liquidity and narrow the spreads on exchanges. This strategic move will foster a safer and more reliable trading environment for all participants interested in trading GHST utility tokens.\n\n**THE SOLUTION**\nThis proposal is for AavegotchiDAO to lend 600k GHST to Skynet Trading for a 12 year term. As per industry standards, this loan will not have any interest attached to it. At the end of the 12 months, Skynet will have the option to A) return the 600k GHST to AavegotchiDAO or B) purchase the GHST at the strike prices established in the agreement.\n\nTo enhance flexibility and fairness, Skynet is offering to view the loan in three tranches of 200k GHST each with strike prices based on premium and/or future token prices. \n\n**THE RISKS**\nWe believe that the loan to Skynet Trading presents minimal risk, given the company's financial stability and reputation in the industry. \n\nAlthough Skynet Trading utilizes Fireblocks for institutional-grade custody solutions, risks associated with exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, HTX, and OKX remain present. It is important to note that Skynet Trading does not bear liability for any risks or losses incurred due to the operational aspects of these exchanges.\n\nWhile not a direct risk, it is prudent to acknowledge the possibility of ‘seller’s remorse’ should GHST values significantly surpass the contract’s strike prices within the next 12 months. The strike prices, set as either premiums or averages of future market rates, are designed to align the interests of both parties. Both parties must enter this agreement with a comprehensive understanding of the associated risks.\n\n**POTENTIAL BENEFITS**\nThe benefits and reasoning for this are already well fleshed out above but to briefly review:\n\nImproving liquidity on at least three more exchanges improves the trading efficiency of the governance token.\n\nMaturing the relationship with an industry-leading company like Skynet Trading may also lead to indirect benefits such as introductions to more exchanges and more opportunities for future loans related to on-chain DEX support and even perps markets (Skynet Trading is open to advocating for GHST perps and can make introductions).\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nFor the benefits noted above, I am proposing that now is the time for AavegotchiDAO to engage with Skynet Trading to improve the currently weak state of GHST liquidity on most of its current listed exchanges. \n\nPixelcraft Studios, having successfully navigated a previous loan arrangement with Skynet Trading and being more than content with the results, is well-positioned and enthusiastic about presenting this new proposal. They have proven to be professional, compliant, ethical, and transparent experts in their field that can greatly benefit our governance cornerstone, GHST token. \n\n*Please note, AavegotchiDAO Foundation is required to pass KYB and AML with Skynet Trading for the official onboarding.* \n\nI am familiar with the process and it is not invasive. Basically there will be 1 KYC’d board member to represent the company as an official associate and then a number of official documents and certificates to provide.",

With an average supply APR of 4.34%, this move aims to generate an annual yield of approximately $154,061, enhancing the DAO's revenue through a stable, high-yield strategy. The proposal ensures over 500,000 DAI remains in the DAO's Polygon wallet for ongoing initiatives, while the rest of the DAI is strategically supplied to Aave.

      "content": "Author: Dr. Wagmi (16635)\nQuorum Requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote Duration: 14 Days\n\nReference Material: (Aavegotchi DAO Treasury Report)\n https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u-hODswpYcLSJhCh4y6SNoR-17rClwenenmU71Ag9Og/edit#heading=h.2gazcsgmxkub\n\nProposal Summary:\nThe proposal recommends the Aavegotchi DAO to diversify its treasury by purchasing 3,000,000 DAI worth of ETH. This acquisition would be executed through Cowswap on the Ethereum blockchain, divided into six weekly tranches of 500,000 DAI each. Funds will come from the DAO Foundation Treasury Wallet which stems from the 25% treasury allocation after curve closure.\nCurrent Treasury Composition:\n • GHST: 16,223,059 ($16,098,141 @ $0.9923)\n • DAI: 8,886,873\n • USDC: 3,756,276\n Total Value: $28,741,290\nPost-Purchase Treasury Composition:\n • GHST: $16,098,141 (56%)\n • USDC: $3,756,276 (13%)\n • DAI: $5,886,873 (21%)\n • ETH: $3,000,000 (10%)\n\n\nBenefits:\nEnhanced Portfolio Diversification: Acquiring ETH introduces a high-potential asset, reducing overreliance on stablecoins and GHST.\nReduced DAI Exposure: Decreases dependency on a single stablecoin, mitigating specific stablecoin risks.\nHedging Against Inflation: ETH, as a non-fiat asset, offers a hedge against USD inflationary pressures.\nCapital Appreciation Potential: ETH has historically shown significant growth potential, offering possible higher returns compared to stablecoins.\nAccess to DeFi Opportunities: ETH holdings can be leveraged for staking or other DeFi instruments, potentially generating additional revenue.\nSimple Execution: The proposed method of acquisition is straightforward and can be executed with relative ease.\nAdditional Benefits:\n • Liquidity and Market Depth: ETH, being a major cryptocurrency, offers high liquidity and market depth, facilitating easy entry and exit.\n • Community Engagement: Participation in a major blockchain like Ethereum could enhance community engagement and visibility.\nPotential Risks and Challenges:\nMarket Volatility: ETH is subject to high price volatility, which could significantly impact the value of the DAO's treasury.\nAccessibility of Funds: Allocating a portion of funds in ETH may complicate treasury access, as proposals would need to clearly specify fund origination requiring additional transactions by the Directors.\nExecution:\nThe purchase will come from the DAO Director Multisig Safe (0x53c3CA81EA03001a350166D2Cc0fcd9d4c1b7B62) using funds from the DAO Foundation Treasury Wallet (0x939b67F6F6BE63E09B0258621c5A24eecB92631c). The purchases will be made in 6 equal, weekly tranches of 500,000 DAI using Cowswap.\n \nConclusion:\nThis proposal strategically diversifies the Aavegotchi DAO’s treasury by leveraging the potential of Ethereum while being mindful of the associated risks. If this proposal is accepted by the Aavegotchi DAO, a separate, second proposal will be produced to consider staking acquired ETH on Lido.\nDr Wagmi",

      "content": "Authors: Slick\nGotchiID(s): 4285\nQuorum Requrement: 20% (9M)\nVote Duration: 7 days\n\n## Background\nThe ATF was officially formed in [AGIP54](https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/0x123768584b0e878a6466a293e402702de7427f0657ea24fd60d71589d0b3003e). In amost a year, there has only been one request to the ATF for prize pool funding and  99,500 GHST remains along with 70+ Fake Cards in the ATF treasury wallet:\n- 0x921D8FDF089775D5AC61b2d6e8f34F1edd554D8f\n\n## Problem\nThe ATF treasury is under-utilized. Uptake on prize pool funds has been minimal due to lack of new minigames. There have also been instances where more substantial Aavegotchi games have requested funds but due to the ATF’s hard limit of 500 GHST per game, they have instead had to complete a full SigProp/CoreProp application to the DAO. E.g. [AGIP 97](https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/0x5fa86c431e3e0d5429906f86d1182781b7f0366f554a57631cf0c8fd2dd1c2b5).\n\n## Solution\nThe ATF would like to propose the following updates to their operation of treasury funds so that individual game developers can apply for, and be granted up to:\n- 4000 GHST per calendar year to fund their gaming prize pools\n- 5 fake gotchi cards per calendar year to be used as part of their game competitions\n- 1000 GHST per calendar year to assist with server hosting costs, playtest funding, fake gotchi artist commissions, marketing and any other activities that help raise awareness for, or assist development of, their game.\n\n## End Goal & Benefits\nThis proposal will:\n- Allow game developers more flexibility when creating prize pools\n- Create quicker turnaround for funding approvals\n- Encourage use of predominantly dormant ATF prize pool funds that are available for the community\n\n## Updated ATF Members\nAs per original ATF creation proposal, 4 out of 7 signers will be required for all transactions and approval of funding requests. Some of our original signers have now moved on and the updated list of 7 signers will be:\n- Slick\n- PG\n- Scrooger\n- Hefe\n- Mycaleum\n- Laggin\n- Chair\n\nPlease note, if one of the ATF signers is requesting funding, they will not be able to sign for that specific transaction should the ATF agree to provide funding.\n\n## Conclusion\nThank you for your time Gotchigang, now let's vote!",

      "title": "[AGIP 103] Strategic Treasury Diversification into Ethereum with $3M ETH Purchase",
      "content": "Author: Dr. Wagmi (16635)\nQuorum Requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote Duration: 7 Days\nReference Material: Aavegotchi DAO Treasury Report:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1u-hODswpYcLSJhCh4y6SNoR-17rClwenenmU71Ag9Og/edit#heading=h.2gazcsgmxkub\n\nProposal Summary:\nThe proposal recommends the Aavegotchi DAO to diversify its treasury by purchasing 3,000,000 DAI worth of ETH. This acquisition would be executed through Cowswap on the Ethereum blockchain, divided into six weekly tranches of 500,000 DAI each.\n\nCurrent Treasury Composition:\n•\tGHST: 16,223,059 ($16,098,141 @ $0.9923)\n•\tDAI: 8,886,873\n•\tUSDC: 3,756,276\nTotal Value: $28,741,290\n\nPost-Purchase Treasury Composition:\n•\tGHST: $16,098,141 (56%)\n•\tUSDC: $3,756,276 (13%)\n•\tDAI: $5,886,873 (21%)\n•\tETH: $3,000,000 (10%)\n\n  \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibilks7knbzbrur7kjbh6qwqxw7xuesmspvni2lda5si2zy66jfwa)\n    \n\nBenefits:\n1.\tEnhanced Portfolio Diversification: Acquiring ETH introduces a high-potential asset, reducing overreliance on stablecoins and GHST.\n2.\tReduced DAI Exposure: Decreases dependency on a single stablecoin, mitigating specific stablecoin risks.\n3.\tHedging Against Inflation: ETH, as a non-fiat asset, offers a hedge against USD inflationary pressures.\n4.\tCapital Appreciation Potential: ETH has historically shown significant growth potential, offering possible higher returns compared to stablecoins.\n5.\tAccess to DeFi Opportunities: ETH holdings can be leveraged for staking or other DeFi instruments, potentially generating additional revenue.\n6.\tSimple Execution: The proposed method of acquisition is straightforward and can be executed with relative ease.\n\nAdditional Benefits:\n•\tLiquidity and Market Depth: ETH, being a major cryptocurrency, offers high liquidity and market depth, facilitating easy entry and exit.\n•\tCommunity Engagement: Participation in a major blockchain like Ethereum could enhance community engagement and visibility.\n\nPotential Risks and Challenges:\n1.\tMarket Volatility: ETH is subject to high price volatility, which could significantly impact the value of the DAO's treasury.\n2.\tAccessibility of Funds: Allocating a portion of funds in ETH may complicate treasury access, as proposals would need to clearly specify fund origination requiring additional transactions by the Directors.\n\nConclusion:\nThis proposal aims to strategically diversify the Aavegotchi DAO’s treasury by leveraging the potential of Ethereum while being mindful of the associated risks. If this proposal is accepted by the Aavegotchi DAO, a separate, second proposal will be produced to consider staking acquired ETH on Lido. Additionally, I will compose a third, separate proposal to supply stablecoins to Aave to generate passive yield.\n\n\nDr Wagmi",

      "title": "Upgrading the ATF",
      "content": "Authors: Slick\nGotchiID(s): 4285\nQuorum Requrement: 20% (9M)\nVote Duration: 7 days\n\n## Background\nThe ATF was officially formed in [AGIP54](https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/0x123768584b0e878a6466a293e402702de7427f0657ea24fd60d71589d0b3003e). In amost a year, there has only been one request to the ATF for prize pool funding and  99,500 GHST remains along with 70+ Fake Cards in the ATF treasury wallet:\n- 0x921D8FDF089775D5AC61b2d6e8f34F1edd554D8f\n\n## Problem\nThe ATF treasury is under-utilized. Uptake on prize pool funds has been minimal due to lack of new minigames. There have also been instances where more substantial Aavegotchi games have requested funds but due to the ATF’s hard limit of 500 GHST per game, they have instead had to complete a full SigProp/CoreProp application to the DAO. E.g. [AGIP 97](https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/0x5fa86c431e3e0d5429906f86d1182781b7f0366f554a57631cf0c8fd2dd1c2b5).\n\n## Solution\nThe ATF would like to propose the following updates to their operation of treasury funds so that individual game developers can apply for, and be granted up to:\n- 4000 GHST per calendar year to fund their gaming prize pools\n- 5 fake gotchi cards per calendar year to be used as part of their game competitions\n- 1000 GHST per calendar year to assist with server hosting costs, playtest funding, fake gotchi artist commissions, marketing and any other activities that help raise awareness for, or assist development of, their game.\n\n## End Goal & Benefits\nThis proposal will:\n- Allow game developers more flexibility when creating prize pools\n- Create quicker turnaround for funding approvals\n- Encourage use of predominantly dormant ATF prize pool funds that are available for the community\n\n## Updated ATF Members\nAs per original ATF creation proposal, 4 out of 7 signers will be required for all transactions and approval of funding requests. Some of our original signers have now moved on and the updated list of 7 signers will be:\n- Slick\n- PG\n- Scrooger\n- Hefe\n- Mycaleum\n- Laggin\n- Chair\n\nPlease note, if one of the ATF signers is requesting funding, they will not be able to sign for that specific transaction should the ATF agree to provide funding.\n\n## Conclusion\nThank you for your time Gotchigang, now let's vote!",

      "content": "Authors: Thrax (9884), JK (18895)\n\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 14 days\nXP Reward: 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in voter's wallet\nDiscussion:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1171486760618950707\n\n![shot3-20289 smoller.png](ipfs://bafybeigiskw46v7b5egxjpeslrfl55aypxpf2jhfhvwseupaabjmxjmuky)\n    \n## Introduction\nSet in a remote training ground somewhere in the Gotchiverse, players will be able to engage in intense PvP battles. For game mode 1 we'll be focused on multiplayer and damage system development, followed by Gotchi trait integration and mech customization.\n\n## Game Mechanics\nPlayers will pilot their Mechagotchis using a mouse and keyboard , with future updates to include controller support. \n\nThe game's mechanics are deeply tied to the Gotchi traits, which tentatively influence mech performance as follows:\n\n- Energy: Balances Health Points and Action Points.\n- Aggression: Dictates the strength of Shields and Attack Speed.\n- Spookyness: Affects the chance for Dodge and Critical Hits.\n- Brain Size: Determines the power of Melee versus Ranged attacks.\n- Eyes shape and Color effect TBC\n\n# LAST MECH STANDING WINS!\n\n## Blockchain Integration\nBlockchain technology is at the heart of Mechagotchis, enabling the distribution of reward tokens and NFTs that represent rare mech upgrades and to verify ownership for exclusive in-game content (eg. LE Gold Skin for Mechagotchi FAKEgotchi holders.)\n\n## Community Engagement\nThe game will foster community involvement through active dev logs, Beta test parties, a community mech design contest, and potentially even a level-builder for user-generated maps. And of course at the end of each phase’s development we will hold our usual XP event/ playtest. These initiatives should contribute to the game's evolution as well as engage players and help them feel more involved in the development process.\n\n\n## Platform\nMechagotchis is a web-based PC game developed in Unity, ensuring broad accessibility while maintaining high-quality graphics and gameplay.\n\n## Customization\nMech customization will evolve from simple paint jobs to extensive modifications, including weapons, armor, and other mech parts, allowing players to tailor their combatants to their playstyle, modifying their in-game behavior. Think of this part like “wearables for your mech”\n\n## Timeline\nThis proposal is to fund development of game mode 1, which is expected to enter beta testing within two months. Milestones will include devlogs, environment designs, secondary mech design finalization, closed group beta testing, wider testing, and an XP event tournament!\n\n## Expected Costs\n\n### Total Cost: 20K USD\n\n### Breakdown:\n4K - Project Management\n5K - 3D modeling/Animation/Rigging\n4K - Front-end Development \n6K - Back-end Development\n1K - Server Deployment + maintenance\n\nJoin the discord to learn more and help shape the game as it's built!\nhttps://discord.com/invite/Q4sW78Mb",

      "title": "[AGIP 101] Strategotchi V1: Funding Proposal",
      "content": "Author: Laggin (23792)\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 14 days\nXP Reward: 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in voter's wallet\nDiscussion:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1168845205999464549\n\n  \n![promo.jpg](ipfs://bafybeibcw6cvuogcti6xfkgvchvmlhacud4lvas6plxi5uh6otxq5tggly)\n      \n\n## Background:\n\nThe original version of Strategotchi was proposed as a strategy game that featured lengthy multiplayer games. Following community feedback, significant refinements were made to the game concept, mechanics, and graphics.\n\n## Strategotchi Tactics Litepaper:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/17dtKyTLHUWB35UxmfNXlXl9TK6mRCsbHkuxkiJht6Q4/edit#heading=h.z6ne0og04bp5\n\nSince the initial vote, the game's development has been ongoing, with the focus shifting towards a single-player experience, blending elements of a tactical RPG, rogue-lite and a puzzle game. The current iteration presents an innovative blend, requiring players to skillfully manage various elements of a mining operation\n ![gamescene2.jpg](ipfs://bafybeidpxhpzvdajdrp5wpfiiv7ms4tgwo2cynxayzh6hx56va7pe46ale)\n    \n## Gameplay:\n\nThe game is essentially a puzzler disguised as a tactical RPG. Individual levels are puzzle-like, with moveable pieces and a finite number of rounds to achieve your goals, yet there is a heavy emphasis on battle strategy. You train and build your Gotchis (predefined avatars and actual Gotchis) the way you want, utilizing various classes with unique advantages. \n\n \n![stuff.jpg](ipfs://bafybeibfpiwz5rnvfyqjnpu7ig5b54enmofdp5pcaloxlfdcqavl77vvyy)\n    \n\nThe weapons and Gotchis you choose define your play style. Each protocol weapon has a unique effect that “moves things” around in different ways. Typical attacks cause damage as well as push units back. Lassos pull things. Grenades disperse crowds. Other weapons might temporarily freeze or teleport units to another location. With the multitude of available weapons in the Aavegotchi protocol, players will be able to tailor unique teams to suit their play style and gain experience to upgrade and grow their characters and equipment as they see fit.\n\n![interaction.jpg](ipfs://bafybeidlunzge4tqh4l5olbhcotmjn77shdr26g3xj2dkoz4cibul23w74)\n## Level Progression:\n\nThe game incorporates rogue-like elements (resembling a dungeon run) where you try to get as far as you can through a series of procedurally generated landscapes. Players aim to harvest as much *REDACTED* as they can to stop their Reputation (REP) from inevitably reaching zero. Luckily you can use earnings to buy your REP back from shady characters you meet in the wild. Earnings can also be used to upgrade weapons and equipment, enhancing the player's chances of advancing further.\n\n## V1 Overview:\n V1’s objective is to highlight the core gameplay mechanics, offering a glimpse into the possibilities of Strategotchi. It will showcase a singular game mode featuring an “infinite island” (dungeon) with a predefined party of avatars. Your aim is to progress as far as possible through the island and maintain your REP, clearing procedurally generated levels with unique parameters. Once you lose your REP, your run is over and your final score is tallied.\n \n![enemies.jpg](ipfs://bafybeicrwvya6bx6eoqulwzyulpsq3eiq4bbodtxxmfl76jkhtq5kkm33u)\n    \n## Current Development Status:\n\nThe project has achieved significant milestones, including fully modeled assets, procedural level generation, functional player and enemy systems, enemy AI and targeting mechanisms. The front end has been completely revamped from the initial prototype and the GUI has been redesigned and partially implemented\n\n## Remaining Tasks:\n\nRevamp player movement system\nRevamp player interaction system\nCreate inter collision damage system\nComplete GUI implementation\nSound design\nLeaderboards\nJuice/eye candy/VFX\n\n![gamescene1.jpg](ipfs://bafybeiawiu4lejsk7efhw3vbjcw3byvfc6bxaqmbzg6kwa6ejx5bt6xore)\n\n## Funding Request\n\nSeeking a $12,000 grant in USD equivalent (USDC or DAI) to expedite Unity development and accelerate the completion of V1. The funding will support finalization of the remaining tasks and shipping of a playable game within a 4-6 week timeframe.\n \n    \n## Conclusion:\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this proposal. Join the Strategotchi discord and follow the Strategotchi gaming channel on official discord to learn more about what’s happening behind the scenes, give suggestions and feedback and generally stay up to date on the development of the project.\n\n### Strategotchi Discord:\n\nhttps://discord.com/invite/ZFfasrKv\n\n### Strategotchi gaming channel on official:\n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1168845205999464549\n\nThanks again and I look forward to your support, feedback and suggestions!",

      "title": "Freckle x Aavegotchi DAO (Investment Proposal)",
      "content": "# Investment and Builder Proposal\nTo: Aavegotchi DAO & Community\nFrom: Lord Trivia (Ian Feiner), Founder & CEO, Freckle TV\n\nFreckle TV is thrilled to propose a unique investment and partnership opportunity directly to the Aavegotchi DAO community. We envision a strategic collaboration to unveil \"Gotchi Guess,\" a mobile web app game show that synergizes Freckle TV's engaging game formats with the iconic Aavegotchi brand identity. This proposal elaborates on the investment terms, the game's concept, and the mutual advantages both parties stand to gain.\n\n## Investment Terms\n\n### Investment Amount:\nA proposal for the Aavegotchi DAO to invest $100,000 into Freckle TV's ongoing Pre-Seed Round. (This amount can be flexible in both directions)\n\n### Valuation: \nThe Pre-Seed round is set at a valuation of $500K with a $5M Valuation Cap.\n\n### Discount:\nIn recognition of Aavegotchi DAO's invaluable contribution, a 30% discount is proposed to expedite the investment process.\n\n### Round Status: \nThe current round has seen over 60% completion, attracting esteemed investors such as the Algorand Foundation and Borderless Capital. We are willing to close the round heroically!\n\n## About Gotchi Guess \n\n### Introduction:\n\"Gotchi Guess\" is an interactive, mobile web app game show developed through a strategic partnership between Aavegotchi and Freckle TV. Set in the Aavegotchi universe, the game features Aavegotchi branding and verbiage throughout. The core gameplay involves players guessing objects from zoomed-in video clips or still images, with a unique Aavegotchi twist.\n\n### **Storyline:**\nIn a distant corner of the Aavegotchi universe, a brave Gotchi Explorer has been stranded on Earth during a special mission. Only the Gotchi Gang can help the Gotchi Explorer return home. By deciphering his \"GotchiDex\" journal entries filled with mysterious earthly objects, items, and sounds, you will help the Gotchi Explorer progress through the levels and make it back to the Gotchiverse. These Earthly items are not just curiosities; they hold the key to understanding new forms of \"Gotchi Energy\" that could revolutionize the Aavegotchi world.\n\n### **Platform:**\n Web App (potential for mobile app). Ex: gotchiguess.freckle.live\n\n### **Gameplay Overview:**\nThe game is designed to be intuitive, engaging, and in line with the Aavegotchi universe. Backed by a compelling storyline,  players guess objects from zoomed-in video clips or still images, and audio clips,  and the points system rewards both the accuracy of the guess and the speed of response. Gameplay is progression and reward-based, with the ability to jump levels, get hints, and more by spending $GHST or hard-earned raffle tickets!\n\n### **Rewards System:**\nPlayers are awarded raffle tickets based on their score, and speed of progression. Tickets can be used in an incredible prize marketplace. Tickets can also be used to purchase powerups, level skips, and beyond. \n\n## **Personnel:**\n- Lead Producer: @lordtrivia \n- Creative Director: @.lostlocal \n- Design + Art Direction @teh_soju \n- Lead Developer: Jewook Ryu\n\n## Community Engagement\nOur past interactions hint at the substantial support from the Gotchi community, emphasizing their eagerness for such a collaboration. Their proactive involvement will not merely legitimize this association but also bolster its outreach through their roles as brand champions for \"Gotchi Guess.\"\n\n## Broader Ecosystem Opportunities\nWhile \"Gotchi Guess\" acts as our initial endeavor, the horizons for Freckle and Aavegotchi to converge on expanded ecosystem opportunities are vast. This could encompass assimilating Freckle assets into the Aavegotchi realm or interweaving Gotchi assets like Glimmer, KEK, Alpha, and other tokens into the expansive Freckle cosmos. The nuances and intricacies of these engagements can be elaborated upon during our conversations, and we remain adaptable in our strategy. Our chief ambition is to arrive at decisions that resonate with both entities' best interests.\n\n## Mutual Benefits\n\n### Evangelizing Other Investors: \nPixelcraft's investment will serve as a strong endorsement, encouraging other investors to join the round.\n\n### Brand Exposure: \nThe game will expose Aavegotchi to new audiences and align it with globally recognized brands through potential partnerships (e.g., Oreo).\n\n### Revenue Generation:\nFreckle TV's network will be utilized to find sponsors and advertisers, creating a new revenue stream for the game.\n\n## Freckle TV Metrics\n\n### Pre-Platform Roll-Over: \n13K total unique users, with 20-30% as Weekly Active Users (WAUs).\n### Post-Platform Roll-Over (Last 45 days): \n2K total unique accounts created, over 50% captured weekly.\n### User Engagement:\nAverage session time of 10 minutes, with user retention above 50% week-over-week.\n### Global Reach: \nActive in 65+ countries, with top demographics in the USA, UK, Germany, Russia, and Canada.\n### Platform Visits: \n30K-45K total platform visits monthly post migration\n\n## Previous Collaborations\n\nOur previous successful collaborations with Aavegotchi have proven that we are aligned in vision and strategy. We believe that \"Gotchi Guess\" is a match made in heaven that will benefit both parties immensely.\n\n## Conclusion\nFreckle TV's proven track record in creating engaging game formats, combined with Aavegotchi's strong visual brand identity and community, creates an intrinsically marketable formula ripe for mass adoption. We are excited about partnering with the DAO to bring this vision to life.",

      "title": "Freckle x Aavegotchi DAO (Investment Proposal)",
      "content": "# Investment and Builder Proposal\nTo: Aavegotchi DAO & Community\nFrom: Lord Trivia (Ian Feiner), Founder & CEO, Freckle TV\n\nFreckle TV is thrilled to propose a unique investment and partnership opportunity directly to the Aavegotchi DAO community. We envision a strategic collaboration to unveil \"Gotchi Guess,\" a mobile web app game show that synergizes Freckle TV's engaging game formats with the iconic Aavegotchi brand identity. This proposal elaborates on the investment terms, the game's concept, and the mutual advantages both parties stand to gain.\n\n## Investment Terms\n\n### Investment Amount:\nA proposal for the Aavegotchi DAO to invest $100,000 into Freckle TV's ongoing Pre-Seed Round. (This amount can be flexible in both directions)\n\n### Valuation: \nThe Pre-Seed round is set at a valuation of $500K with a $5M Valuation Cap.\n\n### Discount:\nIn recognition of Aavegotchi DAO's invaluable contribution, a 30% discount is proposed to expedite the investment process.\n\n### Round Status: \nThe current round has seen over 60% completion, attracting esteemed investors such as the Algorand Foundation and Borderless Capital. We are willing to close the round heroically!\n\n## About Gotchi Guess \n\n### Introduction:\n\"Gotchi Guess\" is an interactive, mobile web app game show developed through a strategic partnership between Aavegotchi and Freckle TV. Set in the Aavegotchi universe, the game features Aavegotchi branding and verbiage throughout. The core gameplay involves players guessing objects from zoomed-in video clips or still images, with a unique Aavegotchi twist.\n\n### **Storyline:**\nIn a distant corner of the Aavegotchi universe, a brave Gotchi Explorer has been stranded on Earth during a special mission. Only the Gotchi Gang can help the Gotchi Explorer return home. By deciphering his \"GotchiDex\" journal entries filled with mysterious earthly objects, items, and sounds, you will help the Gotchi Explorer progress through the levels and make it back to the Gotchiverse. These Earthly items are not just curiosities; they hold the key to understanding new forms of \"Gotchi Energy\" that could revolutionize the Aavegotchi world.\n\n### **Platform:**\n Web App (potential for mobile app). Ex: gotchiguess.freckle.live\n\n### **Gameplay Overview:**\nThe game is designed to be intuitive, engaging, and in line with the Aavegotchi universe. Backed by a compelling storyline,  players guess objects from zoomed-in video clips or still images, and audio clips,  and the points system rewards both the accuracy of the guess and the speed of response. Gameplay is progression and reward-based, with the ability to jump levels, get hints, and more by spending $GHST or hard-earned raffle tickets!\n\n### **Rewards System:**\nPlayers are awarded raffle tickets based on their score, and speed of progression. Tickets can be used in an incredible prize marketplace. Tickets can also be used to purchase powerups, level skips, and beyond. \n\n## **Personnel:**\n- Lead Producer: @lordtrivia \n- Creative Director: @.lostlocal \n- Design + Art Direction @teh_soju \n- Lead Developer: Jewook Ryu\n\n## Community Engagement\nOur past interactions hint at the substantial support from the Gotchi community, emphasizing their eagerness for such a collaboration. Their proactive involvement will not merely legitimize this association but also bolster its outreach through their roles as brand champions for \"Gotchi Guess.\"\n\n## Broader Ecosystem Opportunities\nWhile \"Gotchi Guess\" acts as our initial endeavor, the horizons for Freckle and Aavegotchi to converge on expanded ecosystem opportunities are vast. This could encompass assimilating Freckle assets into the Aavegotchi realm or interweaving Gotchi assets like Glimmer, KEK, Alpha, and other tokens into the expansive Freckle cosmos. The nuances and intricacies of these engagements can be elaborated upon during our conversations, and we remain adaptable in our strategy. Our chief ambition is to arrive at decisions that resonate with both entities' best interests.\n\n## Mutual Benefits\n\n### Evangelizing Other Investors: \nPixelcraft's investment will serve as a strong endorsement, encouraging other investors to join the round.\n\n### Brand Exposure: \nThe game will expose Aavegotchi to new audiences and align it with globally recognized brands through potential partnerships (e.g., Oreo).\n\n### Revenue Generation:\nFreckle TV's network will be utilized to find sponsors and advertisers, creating a new revenue stream for the game.\n\n## Freckle TV Metrics\n\n### Pre-Platform Roll-Over: \n13K total unique users, with 20-30% as Weekly Active Users (WAUs).\n### Post-Platform Roll-Over (Last 45 days): \n2K total unique accounts created, over 50% captured weekly.\n### User Engagement:\nAverage session time of 10 minutes, with user retention above 50% week-over-week.\n### Global Reach: \nActive in 65+ countries, with top demographics in the USA, UK, Germany, Russia, and Canada.\n### Platform Visits: \n30K-45K total platform visits monthly post migration\n\n## Previous Collaborations\n\nOur previous successful collaborations with Aavegotchi have proven that we are aligned in vision and strategy. We believe that \"Gotchi Guess\" is a match made in heaven that will benefit both parties immensely.\n\n## Conclusion\nFreckle TV's proven track record in creating engaging game formats, combined with Aavegotchi's strong visual brand identity and community, creates an intrinsically marketable formula ripe for mass adoption. We are excited about partnering with the DAO to bring this vision to life.",

      "content": "Author: 0xlide([#9345](https://app.aavegotchi.com/gotchi/9345))\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\nXP Reward: 10 XP for each Aavegotchi in voter’s wallet\nSummary\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal suggests converting the held DAI on Ethereum into sDAI and sFRAX to increase the income of the Aavegotchi DAO.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAavegotchiDAO holds [6.5 million DAI](https://etherscan.io/address/0x53c3ca81ea03001a350166d2cc0fcd9d4c1b7b62) in its treasury, and by converting this into 3.25 million sDAI and 3.25 million sFRAX, the treasury can generate an annual yield of over $300k. Also, splitting it into sDAI and sFRAX will help diversify the treasury’s portfolio more than before and reduce its reliance on Maker DAO.\n\n・sDAI\nDocs: https://docs.spark.fi/defi-infrastructure/sdai-overview\nContract Adress: 0x83F20F44975D03b1b09e64809B757c47f942BEeA\nAcquisition Amount: 3,250,000 sDAI\nAPY: 4.20 ~ 5.00%(*DSR ~ EDSR 2023-10-23)\nMain [Liquidty: crvUSD-sDAI (Curve DEX)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1539c2461d7432cc114b0903f1824079bfca2c92) *[Defillama Data](https://defillama.com/yields/pool/e3ddd6f7-7490-4e28-a933-8b01f7fa94eb)\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiczf4s4cmd6gb4hf73uhr2rk7bvllghy6r22cduxv3jykqmxzckru)\n\nAbout: Savings Dai (sDAI) is an ERC-4626 representation/wrapper of DAI in the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) module.The sDAI vault APY is calculated based on the DSR set by Maker DAO and the EDSR, which is determined by the utilization of the DSR. The EDSR has a maximum limit of 5% and decreases as more DAI is staked in the vault. Additionally, the EDSR is a one-time, one-way temporary mechanism, which means that the EDSR can only decrease over time, it cannot increase again even if DSR utilization goes down.\n\nThe collateral assets for DAI and sDAI can be found in the [Monthly Real-World Asset Report](http://forum.makerdao.com/t/real-world-asset-report-2023-10/22696?u=0xlide) and [Dashboard](https://dune.com/steakhouse/makerdao) provided by Steakhouse Financial. The DSR is subject to change with Maker DAO Governance.\n\n・sFARX\nDocs: https://docs.frax.finance/frax-v3/sfrax\nContract Adress: 0xA663B02CF0a4b149d2aD41910CB81e23e1c41c32 1\nAcquisition Amount: 3,250,000 sFRAX\nAPY: 5.40%(*IORB Rate 2023-10-20)\nMain Liquidty: [crvUSD-sFRAX (Curve DEX)](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfef79304c80a694dfd9e603d624567d470e1a0e7) *[Defillama Data](https://defillama.com/yields/pool/eb022571-0e59-4ed9-8f4d-cceb0898e460)\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifruifxay3y3giegr4haclqqctcffnsg2nzu2waa5zkchjobsks4e)\n\nAbout: Staked FRAX (sFRAX) is an ERC4626 staking vault that distributes part of the Frax Protocol yield weekly to stakers denominated in FRAX stablecoins. The sFRAX vault APY is based on a utilization function that can be set by the frxGov governance module. The utilization curve starts at a top end of 10% APY and theoretically has no bottom; however, as more FRAX is staked in the vault, the protocol will attempt to deploy the staked FRAX to sources that yield as close to the IORB rate as possible to keep the bottom APY close to the IORB oracle.Also,[Financial Reserves and Asset Exploration Inc](https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-277-onboard-finrespbc-as-frax-v3s-offchain-rwa-partner/2492?u=0xlide) (dba FinresPBC 167) was incorporated in the US state of Delaware as a public benefit C corporation to accomplish this mission.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe recommended procedures for acquiring sDAI and sFRAX are as follows:\n\n・sDAI Acquisition:\nDeposit the acquired $3,250,000 DAI into DSR to obtain sDAI.\n\n・sFRAX Acquisition:\n\n1. To prevent MEV attacks, use [CoWswap’s TWAP Order](https://swap.cow.fi/#/1/advanced/DAI/FRAX?tab=open&page=1) to convert $3,250,000 DAI to FRAX.\n\n2. Deposit the acquired $3,250,000 FRAX into Frax V3 to obtain sFRAX.\n\n## Next Step\n\nIf passed, the Aavegotchi Foundation will execute this proposal with the cooperation of 0xlide.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n0xlide is not affiliated with or paid by Maker DAO or Frax Finance to publish this Proposal.",

Following community feedback, significant refinements were made to the game concept, mechanics, and graphics.\n\n## Strategotchi Tactics Litepaper:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/17dtKyTLHUWB35UxmfNXlXl9TK6mRCsbHkuxkiJht6Q4/edit#heading=h.z6ne0og04bp5\n\nSince the initial vote, the game's development has been ongoing, with the focus shifting towards a single-player experience, blending elements of a tactical RPG, rogue-lite and a puzzle game. The current iteration presents an innovative blend, requiring players to skillfully manage various elements of a mining operation\n ![gamescene2.jpg](ipfs://bafybeidpxhpzvdajdrp5wpfiiv7ms4tgwo2cynxayzh6hx56va7pe46ale)\n    \n## Gameplay:\n\nThe game is essentially a puzzler disguised as a tactical RPG. Individual levels are puzzle-like, with moveable pieces and a finite number of rounds to achieve your goals, yet there is a heavy emphasis on battle strategy. You train and build your Gotchis (predefined avatars and actual Gotchis) the way you want, utilizing various classes with unique advantages. \n\n \n![stuff.jpg](ipfs://bafybeibfpiwz5rnvfyqjnpu7ig5b54enmofdp5pcaloxlfdcqavl77vvyy)\n    \n\nThe weapons and Gotchis you choose define your play style. Each protocol weapon has a unique effect that “moves things” around in different ways. Typical attacks cause damage as well as push units back. Lassos pull things. Grenades disperse crowds. Other weapons might temporarily freeze or teleport units to another location. With the multitude of available weapons in the Aavegotchi protocol, players will be able to tailor unique teams to suit their play style and gain experience to upgrade and grow their characters and equipment as they see fit.\n\n![interaction.jpg](ipfs://bafybeidlunzge4tqh4l5olbhcotmjn77shdr26g3xj2dkoz4cibul23w74)\n## Level Progression:\n\nThe game incorporates rogue-like elements (resembling a dungeon run) where you try to get as far as you can through a series of procedurally generated landscapes. Players aim to harvest as much *REDACTED* as they can to stop their Reputation (REP) from inevitably reaching zero. Luckily you can use earnings to buy your REP back from shady characters you meet in the wild. Earnings can also be used to upgrade weapons and equipment, enhancing the player's chances of advancing further.\n\n## V1 Overview:\n V1’s objective is to highlight the core gameplay mechanics, offering a glimpse into the possibilities of Strategotchi. It will showcase a singular game mode featuring an “infinite island” (dungeon) with a predefined party of avatars. Your aim is to progress as far as possible through the island and maintain your REP, clearing procedurally generated levels with unique parameters. Once you lose your REP, your run is over and your final score is tallied.\n \n![enemies.jpg](ipfs://bafybeicrwvya6bx6eoqulwzyulpsq3eiq4bbodtxxmfl76jkhtq5kkm33u)\n    \n## Current Development Status:\n\nThe project has achieved significant milestones, including fully modeled assets, procedural level generation, functional player and enemy systems, enemy AI and targeting mechanisms.

      "content": "Authors: Thrax (9884), JK (18895)\n\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\nXP Reward: 10 XP for each Aavegotchi in voter's wallet\nDiscussion:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1171486760618950707\n\n![shot3-20289 smoller.png](ipfs://bafybeigiskw46v7b5egxjpeslrfl55aypxpf2jhfhvwseupaabjmxjmuky)\n    \n## Introduction\nSet in a remote training ground somewhere in the Gotchiverse, players will be able to engage in intense PvP battles. For game mode 1 we'll be focused on multiplayer and damage system development, followed by Gotchi trait integration and mech customization.\n\n## Game Mechanics\nPlayers will pilot their Mechagotchis using a mouse and keyboard , with future updates to include controller support. \n\nThe game's mechanics are deeply tied to the Gotchi traits, which tentatively influence mech performance as follows:\n\n- Energy: Balances Health Points and Action Points.\n- Aggression: Dictates the strength of Shields and Attack Speed.\n- Spookyness: Affects the chance for Dodge and Critical Hits.\n- Brain Size: Determines the power of Melee versus Ranged attacks.\n- Eyes shape and Color effect TBC\n\n# LAST MECH STANDING WINS!\n\n## Blockchain Integration\nBlockchain technology is at the heart of Mechagotchis, enabling the distribution of reward tokens and NFTs that represent rare mech upgrades and to verify ownership for exclusive in-game content (eg. LE Gold Skin for Mechagotchi FAKEgotchi holders.)\n\n## Community Engagement\nThe game will foster community involvement through active dev logs, Beta test parties, a community mech design contest, and potentially even a level-builder for user-generated maps. And of course at the end of each phase’s development we will hold our usual XP event/ playtest. These initiatives should contribute to the game's evolution as well as engage players and help them feel more involved in the development process.\n\n\n## Platform\nMechagotchis is a web-based PC game developed in Unity, ensuring broad accessibility while maintaining high-quality graphics and gameplay.\n\n## Customization\nMech customization will evolve from simple paint jobs to extensive modifications, including weapons, armor, and other mech parts, allowing players to tailor their combatants to their playstyle, modifying their in-game behavior. Think of this part like “wearables for your mech”\n\n## Timeline\nThis proposal is to fund development of game mode 1, which is expected to enter beta testing within two months. Milestones will include devlogs, environment designs, secondary mech design finalization, closed group beta testing, wider testing, and an XP event tournament!\n\n## Expected Costs\n\n### Total Cost: 20K USD\n\n### Breakdown:\n4K - Project Management\n5K - 3D modeling/Animation/Rigging\n4K - Front-end Development \n6K - Back-end Development\n1K - Server Deployment + maintenance\n\nJoin the discord to learn more and help shape the game as it's built!\nhttps://discord.com/invite/Q4sW78Mb",

      "title": "Aavegotchi DAO Directors' Interaction with Aave V3 ",
      "content": "Author: Maxicrouton#1596\nGotchi ID: 13700\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\n\n***INTRODUCTION***:\nHey fren !\nTo optimize our financial resources, I present a proposal that would grant Aavegotchi DAO directors the ability to interact with Aave V3 on both the Ethereum and Polygon blockchains, exclusively with stablecoins (USDT, DAI, USDC).\n\n***BACKGROUND***:\nOur current treasury holds approximately $10 million in stablecoins. With an average Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of 5% on Aave V3 for stablecoins, this presents an opportunity to generate significant annual interest income. By allowing our directors to manage these funds within Aave V3, we can leverage this potential.\n\n***PROPOSAL***:\n\n* Whitelisting Addresses: Only addresses associated with Aave V3 on Ethereum and Polygon will be whitelisted for interaction, and the interaction will be limited to stablecoins (USDT, DAI, USDC).\n* Director's Role: Directors of the DAO will have the authority to deposit or withdraw stablecoins into and from Aave V3. Their actions will be limited to these deposit and withdrawal operations.\n\n***BENEFITS***:\n* Efficient Treasury Management: This proposal streamlines our treasury management by allowing unused funds to be deposited into Aave V3 without the need for voting for withdrawal.\n* Enhancing Financial Stability: By optimizing our treasury, we are better equipped to strengthen the Aavegotchi ecosystem and drive community growth.\n\n***VOTE OPTIONS***:\n* [For] Enable Aavegotchi DAO directors to deposit and withdraw stablecoins on/from Aave V3 on Ethereum and Polygon.\n* [Against] Do not enable Aavegotchi DAO directors to interact with Aave V3 for stablecoins on Ethereum and Polygon.\n\n***CONCLUSION***:\nEmpowering our directors to interact with Aave V3 for stablecoins presents a strategic opportunity to efficiently manage our treasury, generate annual revenue, and enhance our financial stability. I encourage all Aavegotchi DAO members to vote on this.",

The first submission received widespread support but unfortunately did not attain quorum before closure. Thanks for getting us this far Fantasma and crew. Let’s get it all the way Home this time, frens. -Mycaleum\n\nProp:\nFor quite a long time, our DAO has faced the challenge of passing proposals, funding initiatives, making changes to DAO mechanics, all while postponing answering our most basic questions.\nWhat are we? Who are we? What do we stand for? What is the reason and purpose of our DAOs existence?\n\nIt has not been a straight or obvious path, but the journey of discovery for the many frens here, has been deeply enjoyable and illuminating. We humbly present you with a mission statement we believe most successfully aims at the core and soul of the purpose and spirit of our DAO. We hope you find enthusiastic agreement, as we did.\n\nWithout further ado, we propose that the mission statement of Aavegotchi Dao be ratified as:\n\n“To empower players to own, build, grow, and connect in a multiverse of their own creation.”\n \n![AavegotchiDAO Mission Statement.jpg](ipfs://bafkreiay7oq6pww3dwiunysuws6pkzqllrhvxq6elwqqolwnvde4zgv4ia)\n\nThe Word-Salad Graveyard (terms that were deliberately excluded):\n\nGotchigang: \nMany felt this endearment could instead create an exclusionary feeling to potential or prospective readers considering joining our DAO.\n\nWeb3/SDK/Protocol/Blockchain/L2/decentralization/metaverse: \nAll of these words were sprinkled among the earlier (and lengthier) versions of our mission statement. We drew inspiration from the most successful organizations in history, and chose to avoid directly mentioning the product, the technology or explicitly what we do. Nintendo’s mission statement doesn’t even mention gaming consoles.\n\nmembers/participants: \nThis was one of the toughest choices. These identifiers were ultimately supplanted by “player”, to avoid being exclusionary or stale and uninspiring.\n\ngamers, game, play: \nJust how much to convey our gaming focus and roots was a point of constant consideration. We feel that by addressing “players”, this spirit is sufficiently covered. “Player” is also a synonym for “participant”. As such, participants that engage with the DAO and protocol can always be considered players, even if they are not gamers.\n\nWhy bother with a mission statement? \nWhat does the DAO achieve from this vote and effort?\n\nBy answering our most basic organizational identity questions, a ratified Mission Statement gives our DAO cohesive intention. It also paves the way towards creation of a funded working group to formulate our Vision Statement. Ultimately, this skill tree leads to high quality operational achievements such as organizational charts and workstreams, budget proposals that align with the intention of the DAO, diverse and effective contributors and more. Our Mission Statement will be a philosophical rally point for the entire community, and provide a stronghold to empower players to own, build, grow, and connect in a multiverse of their own creation.",

      "content": "Authors: Litepiglet (5369), LostLocal (11732), Tburd (9673), Nofuturistic (5883), Choyna (5139)\n\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\nXP Reward: 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n\nAs we are on the precipice of multiple releases of new games and a refreshed Gotchiverse, I believe it is time for the DAO to take our IRL presence to the next level! Pixelcraft has stepped up big time, putting in some aavesome efforts with the BFG and new booth design. Now it’s time for us to take that and show the world what Gotchigaang is all about! I am proposing the creation of the Gotchi Greetoors (formerly ITF), which would be responsible for the following:\n\nCoordinate IRL strategy in collaboration with Pixelcraft\nHandling administrative tasks on behalf of the DAO (Business Development, Partnerships, onboarding of talent, administrative duties, general networking)\nSource a minimum of 25% of event/booth staff from local dao members where/when applicable\nManage event booth + staff in tandem with Lost Local or other PC employees\nFind lodging to house DAO staff members for the duration of the event at a budget-friendly price\nDAO-related content capture, post production of content, and ensuring timely delivery of said DAO content to social streams and proof-of-attendance via live streaming\nExplore feasibility of creating DAO revenue streams via DAO-sourced merch, ticketed events, IRL tournaments, etc\nDeveloping DAO-to-DAO and DAO-to-influencer collaborations for events and content capture\nCoordinate DAO representation at events outside of PC’s scope that are beneficial to the DAO\nCurate and source lRL wearables for gotchigang attending each event\nQuarterly reporting on task force activity\nBudgets for previous & following quarter\nReport on events attended (bizdev + partnership leads, activations, etc.)\nStrategy for upcoming quarter’s events\nPlanning Phase 2 for implementation after event strategy has been perfected\ncommunity led meetups + tournaments in gotchi IRL hot zones, GotchiCon, more TBD\nThis team would consist of:\n\nLitepiglet - Admin Lead\nNofuturistic - Media Lead\nLost Local - Pixelcraft Liaison\nTburd - Lead Support or aka assistant to the assistant regional manager\n\nWe are requesting a total budget of $80,000 paid as $20,000 per quarter, in USDC or DAI, which would be converted to USDC upon transfer. This task force would need to submit for funding for any additional time period after the first year. This funding would rollover to the following quarter if it is not spent in the previous one and any excess would be returned to the DAO after the 1 year funding period is up. These funds will be used for DAO member payments for the following:\n\nTravel\nPer diem\nEvent/booth work\nIncidental travel expenses (lost luggage, flight delays, etc)\nAlso included would be quarterly compensation to the task force in the following amounts:\n\nNofuturistic - 750 USDC\nLitepiglet - 500 USDC\nTburd - 350 USDC\n\nA sample budget for Q4, where would be expecting to attend Art Basel Miami, can be seen here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bsh_BJ0Y3efY7eSid5EoLW-gH8ECvbVjpO7Ca2x7Jz0/edit#gid=0\n\nOur current projected schedule for 2023 - 2024 is as follows:\nArt Basel Miami - December 8 - 10, 2023\nEthereum Denver - Feb 29 - March 3 2024\nGDC (Game Developers Conference) San Fran - March 19 - March 22 2024\nNFTNYC - April 3 - April 5 2024\nRare Evo Denver- Late Summer 2024\nArt Basel Miami - Winter 2024\nInternational Schedule - TBD\n\nTeam size would vary from event to event. We can expect a much larger working crew for events like Ethereum Denver vs Art Basel. This schedule is subject to change. We will also be targeting some international events, such as ETHCC, Devcon, Smartcon, ETH Tokyo etc. Many dates are TBD at this moment. Nofuturistic will be responsible for handling post-production of content captured at these events. In the event he is unavailable for timely output, we will outsource, so this can be an expected expense from time to time.\n\nThe GG will be creating a typeform to maintain a working list of DAO members and their locations that may like to assist the task force in their duties or just possibly attend events with some regularity, so we can strategically choose where to send DAO representation. When an event is chosen, the GG will reach out to members that indicated their interest in working on the typeform from the selected location. The selection process will be slightly subjective in that you will need to have a proven track record of knowledge of the project, be known to some degree in the community already, and have the necessary technical skills, in regards to the media team. Internal scoring reports will be maintained of each DAO member's performance for reference for future participation at other events. We would like to rotate in as many DAO members as possible, so previous selection and exceptional performance does not guarantee future selection.\n\nThere will also be a sign-up for claiming your IRL wearable prior to each event. The GG will curate and source an item to give to gotchi dao members that have given their info + size, as an incentive to come to these events they are putting funds towards, as well as becoming walking billboards at the event. We will source the art for each wearable (shirts, hoodies, etc.) from the community, hopefully someone local, whenever applicable. This sign up will be first-come-first-serve with the quantity limited at 100 (legendary) or less. The number of attendees from the DAO and size of the event will dictate the rarity of this item. You must retrieve your wearable IRL.\n\nBy creating this task force I believe we can bring Aavegotchi to center stage in Web3 gaming. Not only does it create unique, tangible experiences for those of us already here, it can unlock our potential to be a powerhouse in this space by capturing the hearts and minds of many. I mean, seriously, who doesn’t want to pet the BFG?\n\nRequested funds to be sent to following address (GG Multisig): 0x39Ce3d5869739A20024f4b2Bc70E1b2D0B00BEb3\n\nMulti-sig Signers:\nLitepiglet - 0x9730299b10A30bDbAF81815c99b4657c685314AB\nNofuturistic - 0x710a24b16ef692c1563e77AFc3f94b758921aa62\nTburd - 0xc89A3292Eb0a8396A2505deB6195AFA7f83A8A30",

      "content": "Authors: Litepiglet (5369), LostLocal (11732), Tburd (4895), Nofuturistic (5883), Choyna (5139)\n\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\nXP Reward: 20 XP for each author’s listed Aavegotchi ID #\n\nAs we are on the precipice of multiple releases of new games and a refreshed Gotchiverse, I believe it is time for the DAO to take our IRL presence to the next level! Pixelcraft has stepped up big time, putting in some aavesome efforts with the BFG and new booth design. Now it’s time for us to take that and show the world what Gotchigaang is all about! I am proposing the creation of the ITF (In Real Life Taask Force), which would be responsible for the following:\n\n- Coordinate IRL strategy in collaboration with Pixelcraft\n-  Handling administrative tasks on behalf of the DAO (Business Development, Partnerships, onboarding of talent, administrative duties, general networking)\n- Source a minimum of 25% of event/booth staff from local dao members where/when applicable\n- Manage event booth + staff in tandem with Lost Local or other PC employees\n- Find lodging to house DAO staff members for the duration of the event at a budget-friendly price\n- DAO-related content capture, post production of content, and ensuring timely delivery of said DAO content to social streams and proof-of-attendance via live streaming\n- Explore feasibility of creating DAO revenue streams via DAO-sourced merch, ticketed events, IRL tournaments, etc\n- Developing DAO-to-DAO and DAO-to-influencer collaborations for events and content capture\n- Coordinate DAO representation at events outside of PC’s scope that are beneficial to the DAO\n- Curate and source lRL wearables for gotchigang attending each event \n- Quarterly reporting on task force activity\n\t- Budgets for previous & following quarter\n\t- Report on events attended (bizdev + partnership leads, activations, etc.)\n\t- Strategy for upcoming quarter’s events\n- Planning Phase 2 for implementation after event strategy has been perfected \n\t- community led meetups + tournaments in gotchi IRL hot zones, GotchiCon, more TBD\n\nThis team would consist of:\n\nLitepiglet - Admin Lead\nNofuturistic - Media Lead \nLost Local - Pixelcraft Liaison\nTburd - Lead Support or aka assistant to the assistant regional manager\n\nWe are requesting a total budget of $80,000 paid as $20,000 per quarter, in USDC or DAI, which would be converted to USDC upon transfer. This task force would need to submit for funding for any additional time period after the first year. This funding would rollover to the following quarter if it is not spent in the previous one and any excess would be returned to the DAO after the 1 year funding period is up. These funds will be used for DAO member payments for the following: \n\n- Travel\n- Per diem\n- Event/booth work\n- Incidental travel expenses (lost luggage, flight delays, etc)\n\nAlso included would be quarterly compensation to the task force in the following amounts:\n\nNofuturistic - 750 USDC\nLitepiglet - 500 USDC\nTburd - 350 USDC\n\n\nA sample budget for Q4, where would be expecting to attend Art Basel Miami, can be seen here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bsh_BJ0Y3efY7eSid5EoLW-gH8ECvbVjpO7Ca2x7Jz0/edit#gid=0\n\nOur current projected schedule for 2023 - 2024 is as follows:\nArt Basel Miami - December 8 - 10, 2023\nEthereum Denver - Feb 29 - March 3 2024\nGDC (Game Developers Conference) San Fran - March 19 - March 22 2024\nNFTNYC - April 3 - April 5 2024\nRare Evo Denver- Late Summer 2024\nArt Basel Miami - Winter 2024\nInternational Schedule - TBD\n\nTeam size would vary from event to event. We can expect a much larger working crew for events like Ethereum Denver vs Art Basel. This schedule is subject to change. We will also be targeting some international events, such as ETHCC, Devcon, Smartcon, ETH Tokyo etc. Many dates are TBD at this moment. Nofuturistic will be responsible for handling post-production of content captured at these events. In the event he is unavailable for timely output, we will outsource, so this can be an expected expense from time to time. \n\nThe ITF will be creating a typeform to maintain a working list of DAO members and their locations that may like to assist the task force in their duties or just possibly attend events with some regularity, so we can strategically choose where to send DAO representation. When an event is chosen, the ITF will reach out to members that indicated their interest in working on the typeform from the selected location. The selection process will be slightly subjective in that you will need to have a proven track record of knowledge of the project, be known to some degree in the community already, and have the necessary technical skills, in regards to the media team. Internal scoring reports will be maintained of each DAO member's performance for reference for future participation at other events. We would like to rotate in as many DAO members as possible, so previous selection and exceptional performance does not guarantee future selection.\n\nThere will also be a sign-up for claiming your IRL wearable prior to each event. The TF will curate and source an item to give to gotchi dao members that have given their info + size, as an incentive to come to these events they are putting funds towards, as well as becoming walking billboards at the event. We will source the art for each wearable (shirts, hoodies, etc.) from the community, hopefully someone local, whenever applicable. This sign up will be first-come-first-serve with the quantity limited at 100 (legendary) or less. The number of attendees from the DAO and size of the event will dictate the rarity of this item. You must retrieve your wearable IRL, no exceptions.\n\n\nBy creating this task force I believe we can bring Aavegotchi to center stage in Web3 gaming. Not only does it create unique, tangible experiences for those of us already here, it can unlock our potential to be a powerhouse in this space by capturing the hearts and minds of many. I mean, seriously, who doesn’t want to pet the BFG? \n\nRequested funds to be sent to following address (ITF Multisig): 0x39Ce3d5869739A20024f4b2Bc70E1b2D0B00BEb3\n\nMulti-sig Signers:\nLitepiglet - 0x9730299b10A30bDbAF81815c99b4657c685314AB\nNofuturistic - 0x710a24b16ef692c1563e77AFc3f94b758921aa62\nTburd - 0xc89A3292Eb0a8396A2505deB6195AFA7f83A8A30",

The first submission received widespread support but unfortunately did not attain quorum before closure. Thanks for getting us this far Fantasma and crew. Let’s get it all the way Home this time, frens. -Mycaleum\n\nProp:\nFor quite a long time, our DAO has faced the challenge of passing proposals, funding initiatives, making changes to DAO mechanics, all while postponing answering our most basic questions.\nWhat are we? Who are we? What do we stand for? What is the reason and purpose of our DAOs existence?\n\nIt has not been a straight or obvious path, but the journey of discovery for the many frens here, has been deeply enjoyable and illuminating. We humbly present you with a mission statement we believe most successfully aims at the core and soul of the purpose and spirit of our DAO. We hope you find enthusiastic agreement, as we did.\n\nWithout further ado, we propose that the mission statement of Aavegotchi Dao be ratified as:\n\n“To empower players to own, build, grow, and connect in a multiverse of their own creation.”\n \n![AavegotchiDAO Mission Statement.jpg](ipfs://bafkreiay7oq6pww3dwiunysuws6pkzqllrhvxq6elwqqolwnvde4zgv4ia)\n\nThe Word-Salad Graveyard (terms that were deliberately excluded):\n\nGotchigang: \nMany felt this endearment could instead create an exclusionary feeling to potential or prospective readers considering joining our DAO.\n\nFren(s): \nThis was painful to remove, frens. While it clearly has earned a special place in the hearts of many within our community, the group behind this proposal ultimately decided that the unfortunate association of this word with alt-right and hate groups make it an impossible word to embrace in our mission statement in good conscience.\n\n\nWeb3/SDK/Protocol/Blockchain/L2/decentralization/metaverse: \nAll of these words were sprinkled among the earlier (and lengthier) versions of our mission statement. We drew inspiration from the most successful organizations in history, and chose to avoid directly mentioning the product, the technology or explicitly what we do. Nintendo’s mission statement doesn’t even mention gaming consoles.\n\nmembers/participants: \nThis was one of the toughest choices. These identifiers were ultimately supplanted by “player”, to avoid being exclusionary or stale and uninspiring.\n\ngamers, game, play: \nJust how much to convey our gaming focus and roots was a point of constant consideration. We feel that by addressing “players”, this spirit is sufficiently covered. “Player” is also a synonym for “participant”. As such, participants that engage with the DAO and protocol can always be considered players, even if they are not gamers.\n\nWhy bother with a mission statement? \nWhat does the DAO achieve from this vote and effort?\n\nBy answering our most basic organizational identity questions, a ratified Mission Statement gives our DAO cohesive intention. It also paves the way towards creation of a funded working group to formulate our Vision Statement. Ultimately, this skill tree leads to high quality operational achievements such as organizational charts and workstreams, budget proposals that align with the intention of the DAO, diverse and effective contributors and more. Our Mission Statement will be a philosophical rally point for the entire community, and provide a stronghold to empower players to own, build, grow, and connect in a multiverse of their own creation.",

      "title": "IRL Taask Force",
      "content": "Authors (Gotchi ID): Litepiglet (#5369), LostLocal (#11732), Notfuturistic (#5883), TBurd (#9673), Choyna(#5139)\n\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 9 days\nXP Reward: 20 XP for each author’s listed Aavegotchi ID #\n\nAs we are on the precipice of multiple releases of new games and a refreshed Gotchiverse, I believe it is time for the DAO to take our IRL presence to the next level! Pixelcraft has stepped up big time, putting in some aavesome efforts with the BFG and new booth design. Now it’s time for us to take that and show the world what Gotchigaang is all about! I am proposing the creation of the ITF (In Real Life Taask Force), which would be responsible for the following:\n\n- Coordinate IRL strategy in collaboration with Pixelcraft\n-  Handling administrative tasks on behalf of the DAO (Business Development, Partnerships, onboarding of talent, administrative duties, general networking)\n- Source a minimum of 25% of event/booth staff from local dao members where/when applicable\n- Manage event booth + staff in tandem with Lost Local or other PC employees\n- Find lodging to house DAO staff members for the duration of the event at a budget-friendly price\n- DAO-related content capture, post production of content, and ensuring timely delivery of said DAO content to social streams and proof-of-attendance via live streaming\n- Explore feasibility of creating DAO revenue streams via DAO-sourced merch, ticketed events, IRL tournaments, etc\n- Developing DAO-to-DAO and DAO-to-influencer collaborations for events and content capture\n- Coordinate DAO representation at events outside of PC’s scope that are beneficial to the DAO\n- Curate and source lRL wearables for gotchigang attending each event \n- Quarterly reporting on task force activity\n\t- Budgets for previous & following quarter\n\t- Report on events attended (bizdev + partnership leads, activations, etc.)\n\t- Strategy for upcoming quarter’s events\n- Planning Phase 2 for implementation after event strategy has been perfected \n\t- community led meetups + tournaments in gotchi IRL hot zones, GotchiCon, more TBD\n\nThis team would consist of:\n\nLitepiglet - Admin Lead\nNofuturistic - Media Lead \nLost Local - Pixelcraft Liaison\nTburd - Lead Support or aka assistant to the assistant regional manager\n\nWe are requesting a total budget of $80,000 paid as $20,000 per quarter, in USDC or DAI, which would be converted to USDC upon transfer. This task force would need to submit for funding for any additional time period after the first year. This funding would rollover to the following quarter if it is not spent in the previous one and any excess would be returned to the DAO after the 1 year funding period is up. These funds will be used for DAO member payments for the following: \n\n- Travel\n- Per diem\n- Event/booth work\n- Incidental travel expenses (lost luggage, flight delays, etc)\n\nAlso included would be quarterly compensation to the task force in the following amounts:\n\nNofuturistic - 750 USDC\nLitepiglet - 500 USDC\nTburd - 350 USDC\n\n\nA sample budget for Q4, where would be expecting to attend Art Basel Miami, can be seen here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bsh_BJ0Y3efY7eSid5EoLW-gH8ECvbVjpO7Ca2x7Jz0/edit#gid=0\n\nOur current projected schedule for 2023 - 2024 is as follows:\nArt Basel Miami - December 8 - 10, 2023\nEthereum Denver - Feb 29 - March 3 2024\nGDC (Game Developers Conference) San Fran - March 19 - March 22 2024\nNFTNYC - April 3 - April 5 2024\nRare Evo Denver- Late Summer 2024\nArt Basel Miami - Winter 2024\nInternational Schedule - TBD\n\nTeam size would vary from event to event. We can expect a much larger working crew for events like Ethereum Denver vs Art Basel. This schedule is subject to change. We will also be targeting some international events, such as ETHCC, Devcon, Smartcon, ETH Tokyo etc. Many dates are TBD at this moment. Nofuturistic will be responsible for handling post-production of content captured at these events. In the event he is unavailable for timely output, we will outsource, so this can be an expected expense from time to time. \n\nThe ITF will be creating a typeform to maintain a working list of DAO members and their locations that may like to assist the task force in their duties or just possibly attend events with some regularity, so we can strategically choose where to send DAO representation. When an event is chosen, the ITF will reach out to members that indicated their interest in working on the typeform from the selected location. The selection process will be slightly subjective in that you will need to have a proven track record of knowledge of the project, be known to some degree in the community already, and have the necessary technical skills, in regards to the media team. Internal scoring reports will be maintained of each DAO member's performance for reference for future participation at other events. We would like to rotate in as many DAO members as possible, so previous selection and exceptional performance does not guarantee future selection.\n\nThere will also be a sign-up for claiming your IRL wearable prior to each event. The TF will curate and source an item to give to gotchi dao members that have given their info + size, as an incentive to come to these events they are putting funds towards, as well as becoming walking billboards at the event. We will source the art for each wearable (shirts, hoodies, etc.) from the community, hopefully someone local, whenever applicable. This sign up will be first-come-first-serve with the quantity limited at 100 (legendary) or less. The number of attendees from the DAO and size of the event will dictate the rarity of this item. You must retrieve your wearable IRL, no exceptions.\n\n\nBy creating this task force I believe we can bring Aavegotchi to center stage in Web3 gaming. Not only does it create unique, tangible experiences for those of us already here, it can unlock our potential to be a powerhouse in this space by capturing the hearts and minds of many. I mean, seriously, who doesn’t want to pet the BFG? \n\nRequested funds to be sent to following address (ITF Multisig): 0x39Ce3d5869739A20024f4b2Bc70E1b2D0B00BEb3\n\nMulti-sig Signers:\nLitepiglet - 0x9730299b10A30bDbAF81815c99b4657c685314AB\nNofuturistic - 0x710a24b16ef692c1563e77AFc3f94b758921aa62\nTburd - 0xc89A3292Eb0a8396A2505deB6195AFA7f83A8A30",

Who are we? What do we stand for? What is the reason and purpose of existence for our DAO?\n\nWell friends… it has not been a straight or obvious path, but the journey of discovery for the many who participated in this exercise, has been deeply enjoyable and illuminating. We humbly present you with a mission statement we believe most successfully aims at the core and soul of the purpose and spirit of our DAO, and we hope you agree as enthusiastically as we ultimately did.\n\nWithout further ado, we propose that the mission statement of Aavegotchi Dao be ratified as:\n\n“To empower players to own, build, grow, and connect in a multiverse of their own creation.”\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiblyiveaypqzwhgoha2fay7w5fardeoyjdnyz4rgewagioikludhu)\n    \n \nThe word-salad graveyard (or the controversial words that were ultimately removed):\n\nGotchigang: This word was replaced as many felt it’s exclusionary to potential or prospective readers considering joining our DAO.\n\nFren(s): Probably the most painful word to remove. While it has clearly earned a special place in the hearts of many within our community, the group behind this proposal ultimately decided that the unfortunate relation of this word with alt-right and hate groups makes it an impossible word to embrace in our mission statement in good conscience.\nWeb3/SDK/Protocol/Blockchain/L2/decentralization/metaverse: All of these words were sprinkled among the earliest (and lengthy) versions/suggestions for our mission statement. We drew inspiration from the most successful organizations in history, to avoid directly mentioning the product, the technology and explicitly what we do (Nintendo’s mission statement does not mention gaming consoles).\n\nmembers/participants: This was among the toughest choices, these words were ultimately supplanted by “player”, by virtue of being exclusionary or stale and uninspiring.\n\ngamers, game, play: Just how much to convey our gaming focus and roots was a point of constant consideration- we feel that by addressing “players”, this spirit is sufficiently covered, while also allowing the flexibility of the  fact that “player” is a synonym of “participant”. As such, participants that engage with the DAO and protocol, can always be considered players even if they are not gamers.\n\n\nWhy bother with a mission statement? What does the Dao get from this vote and effort?\n\nBy answering the most basic questions, a ratified Mission Statement will pave the way for the creation of a paid working group to formulate our Vision Statement, and ultimately fulfill great operational achievements such as organizational charts/hierarchies and budgets that align with the very soul of the voters of this DAO, thanks to guidance the Mission Statement. It will be a philosophical stronghold for the entire community to rally and unite around for all the exciting things that our future holds.",

This proposal suggests keeping reward parameters largely the same as the prior several seasons, with the addition of a 100k prize pool for Gotchi Battler.   Last season used the following reward parameters:\n\n4 Rounds (2 weeks each) 1.5 Million GHST Rewards Pool - to be funded by the DAO Treasury\n\n70% BRS\n\n20% Kinship\n\n10% XP\n\nTop 7.5k Gotchis (30%)\n\nFor the upcoming season we want to add a 4th category for Gotchi Battler. The prizepool will be increased to 1.6M total GHST and the extra 100K will be for a Gotchi Battler tournament.

To participate you just need to enter your team during the registration period at the start of the tournament, then your team will automatically progress through each round. Once the VRF has been rolled for the round each day you can view all the battles on the Gotchi Battler website.

      "content": "Author: MikeyJay (15682)\n\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\nXP Reward: 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n\nDiscussion: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1147600236764741683\n\n### Project Summary\nGotchi Deals Club is an innovative project that enhances player engagement in the Aavegotchi Baazaar by aiding users in discovering the most attractive deals. The web app utilizes a revolutionary scoring algorithm, ranking assets between 0-100 based on historical market activities and sophisticated data science models, catering to both newcomers and seasoned collectors.\n\nA proof-of-concept prototype (https://gotchideals.com) was unveiled as part of the Aavegotchi DAO Voltron Hackathon in August 2023, featuring a single-page UI that displays live top wearable deals from the baazaar, serving as a proof-of-concept with a simplified algorithm to score deals. The prototype received broadly positive feedback, as well as helpful observations from the community that will be incorporated into future development.\n\n### Funding Request\nI am seeking approval for a grant of $15,000 in USD equivalent (USDC or DAI) to support the development of the Alpha release of Gotchi Deals Club. This proposal is strictly for the approval of funding for the Alpha release; proposals for Beta and Production release funding will be submitted separately in the future. \n\n**Payment Address:** 0x755A89AC371eE91c1E0fC313Bc9efF5Fc150b993 (polygon)\n\n### Project Roadmap\n![image](ipfs://bafybeifli7m7p4ygh3ptxfs3hbthr2ablzoacf5coz2r6xd3nmnoqx23bu)\n\n#### Alpha Release (Cost: $15,000, Delivery timeframe: 2-3 months)\nThe goal of the alpha release is to perfect the deal scoring algorithms and expand support beyond wearables to include gotchi listings.\n- **Expansion of Deal Scoring Algorithm:** Introduction and refinement of deal scores for gotchi listings using machine learning.\n- **Maintenance and Improvement of Existing UI:** The current prototype UI will be retained and enhanced based on feedback and requirements.\n\n#### Beta Release (Future Proposal, Est. Cost: $20,000)\n- **Enhanced User Experience:** Rebuilt app UI with on-brand design, flexible data views, and interactive charting.\n- **Real-Time Discord Alerts:** Instant notifications for new hot deals as they appear.\n\n#### Production Release (Future Proposal, Est. Cost: $15,000)\n- **Final Implementation and Optimization:** All planned features including customization and advanced features like asset valuator will be fully implemented and refined.\n- **Wallet Integration:** Connectivity for quality-of-life features.\n- **Deal Score API:** Enable other tools in the ecosystem to integrate deal scores into their interface.\n\n### Conclusion\nI firmly believe that the Gotchi Deals Club will significantly enhance user experience and engagement on the Aavegotchi Baazaar. I am excited about the potential impact of this project on the Aavegotchi community and look forward to your support, feedback, and suggestions as we progress in bringing Gotchi Deals Club to fruition.",

Who are we? What do we stand for? What is the reason and purpose of existence for our DAO?\n\nWell friends… it has not been a straight or obvious path, but the journey of discovery for the many who participated in this exercise, has been deeply enjoyable and illuminating. We humbly present you with a mission statement we believe most successfully aims at the core and soul of the purpose and spirit of our DAO, and we hope you agree as enthusiastically as we ultimately did.\n\nWithout further ado, we propose that the mission statement of Aavegotchi Dao be ratified as:\n\n“To empower players to own, build, grow, and connect in a multiverse of their own creation.”\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiblyiveaypqzwhgoha2fay7w5fardeoyjdnyz4rgewagioikludhu)\n    \n \nThe word-salad graveyard (or the controversial words that were ultimately removed):\n\nGotchigang: This word was replaced as many felt it’s exclusionary to potential or prospective readers considering joining our DAO.\n\nFren(s): Probably the most painful word to remove. While it has clearly earned a special place in the hearts of many within our community, the group behind this proposal ultimately decided that the unfortunate relation of this word with alt-right and hate groups makes it an impossible word to embrace in our mission statement in good conscience.\nWeb3/SDK/Protocol/Blockchain/L2/decentralization/metaverse: All of these words were sprinkled among the earliest (and lengthy) versions/suggestions for our mission statement. We drew inspiration from the most successful organizations in history, to avoid directly mentioning the product, the technology and explicitly what we do (Nintendo’s mission statement does not mention gaming consoles).\n\nmembers/participants: This was among the toughest choices, these words were ultimately supplanted by “player”, by virtue of being exclusionary or stale and uninspiring.\n\ngamers, game, play: Just how much to convey our gaming focus and roots was a point of constant consideration- we feel that by addressing “players”, this spirit is sufficiently covered, while also allowing the flexibility of the  fact that “player” is a synonym of “participant”. As such, participants that engage with the DAO and protocol, can always be considered players even if they are not gamers.\n\n\nWhy bother with a mission statement? What does the Dao get from this vote and effort?\n\nBy answering the most basic questions, a ratified Mission Statement will pave the way for the creation of a paid working group to formulate our Vision Statement, and ultimately fulfill great operational achievements such as organizational charts/hierarchies and budgets that align with the very soul of the voters of this DAO, thanks to guidance the Mission Statement. It will be a philosophical stronghold for the entire community to rally and unite around for all the exciting things that our future holds.",

      "content": "Authors: Bearded, Immaterial\nGotchiIDs: 13536, 13681\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\nXP Reward: 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\nDiscussion: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1153382684014411897\n\n\nHi all,\n\nWe are proposing that we start rarity farming season 7 on Halloween, October 31 (if deemed feasible by PC, or ASAP after that in consultation with PC).\n\nWe’ve been aiming for ~3 rarity farming seasons a year, and our proposed Halloween start date ends this third 2023 season right around the end of the year.  This proposal suggests keeping reward parameters largely the same as the prior several seasons, with the addition of a 100k prize pool for Gotchi Battler.   Last season used the following reward parameters:\n\n4 Rounds (2 weeks each) 1.5 Million GHST Rewards Pool - to be funded by the DAO Treasury\n\n70% BRS\n\n20% Kinship\n\n10% XP\n\nTop 7.5k Gotchis (30%)\n\nFor the upcoming season we want to add a 4th category for Gotchi Battler. The prizepool will be increased to 1.6M total GHST and the extra 100K will be for a Gotchi Battler tournament. The tournament can have up to 4096 teams entered with each team comprising of 5 gotchis, this means a total of 20,480 gotchis could enter, although we'd expect a lot less than that. The payout structure would be as follows:\n\n| Place     | Prize (in GHST) |\n|-----------|-----------------|\n| 1              | 10,000          |\n| 2             | 6,000           |\n| 3-4         | 2,500           |\n| 5-8         | 1,270           |\n| 9-16        | 760             |\n| 17-32       | 500             |\n| 33-64      | 310             |\n| 65-128     | 200             |\n| 129-256   | 120             |\n| 257-512    | 85              |\n\nThe tournament will be a single elimination tournament with 1 round each day. To participate you just need to enter your team during the registration period at the start of the tournament, then your team will automatically progress through each round. Once the VRF has been rolled for the round each day you can view all the battles on the Gotchi Battler website. The tournament will take place before the end of the season and we will have many \"test\" tournaments with small prize pools beforehand so there will be plenty of opportunity to practice and figure out what your best team configuration is.\n\n\nLaunch period: Season 7 round 1 to commence on October 31, or as soon as deemed feasible by PC\n\nThank you as always for your consideration and your votes!",

The key improvements and new features include:\n\n1. A full graphical revamp, encompassing game items, objects, battle scenes, and monsters, to enhance the visual experience. (Artwork Included)\n\n2. Fully animated battles between Aavegotchis and monsters, allowing you to witness epic fights and see your beloved gotchis in action. (Artwork Included)\n\n3. A completely redesigned UI/UX to provide a better and smoother gaming experience. (Artwork Included)\n\n4. The introduction of numerous new features, including account progression and leveling up, achievements, dungeon gameplay mode, a new in-game item crafting system, epic boss battles with a loot system, pet companions, and much more!\n\n5. Finally, we have worked on balancing the Leaderboard climbing experience by reducing the presence of pay-to-win elements and adding more in-game loot, objectives, and activities mentioned above.\n\n6. And yet, this is just the beginning of our journey with this newly improved Aavegotchi Idle game, which will soon be ready to be introduced to the entire blockchain world.\n\nTLDR.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### New Art Styles\n\n### Animated Combat (Featuring Innovative Animated Gotchis!

Initially with a small team and limited experience, we embarked on this journey to create an enjoyable, addictive game with real rewards. After nearly two years of dedicated effort and significant personal investment, we are proud to have brought our initial vision to life and gained a lot of experience throughout the journey. While I have funded the majority of the project, my ambition to fulfill the dream that inspired me remains unwavering. The fact that players are now engaged and participating in the game brings me immense joy and gratitude.\n\nAt SlowSundayGames, we've developed Gotchi Heroes, an IDLE gameplay journey where players use their Aavegotchis as characters. Through XP events and rewarding seasons, we've tested our backend servers and scalability successfully. However, to further enhance our offering, there are enhancements we need to make.\n\nGotchi Heroes aims to provide an immersive gaming experience on par with industry leaders. We plan to integrate Aavegotchi assets and other features to enhance the interface and bring our vision to life.\n\nOur vision extends beyond the present. We're excited about the prospects of transitioning to the Unity game engine and a full art revamp, a move that promises a refreshing, graphic design and a responsive user interface. This leap forward isn't just an upgrade; it's our ticket to unveiling new and exciting game mechanics, designed to captivate our gamers further.\n\nTo realize this vision, we seek financial support from the Aavegotchi DAO. Together, we aim to redefine gaming standards for Aavegotchi games and leave our mark in the blockchain gaming world.\n\n\n### New Feature Enhancements for Gotchi Heroes\n\n#### 1. Leveling System for Players During the Season\n\nIntroduce a player leveling system that progresses with in-game activity during each season. This system will provide players with a tangible sense of progression and reward for consistent participation.\n\n\n#### 2. Achievements\n\nIntroduce an achievement system with tasks and rewards, ensuring every player's experience is unique and promoting replayability.\n\n\n#### 3. Reworked Tokenomics of Our Token\n\nRevise the current tokenomics to ensure a sustainable and balanced in-game economy that's rewarding for players and investors alike.\n\n\n#### 4. New Items Crafting Mechanics and In-Game Currencies\n\nExpand the game's depth by introducing item crafting mechanics and additional in-game currencies.\n\n\n#### 5.

      "title": "[AGIP 94] Revamp the Aavegotchi Rental Protocol to support Parcels and Wearables",
      "content": "Author: ernani.eth\nGotchi ID: #19417\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote Duration: 8 days\nXP reward: 20 XP to each AAvegotchi that is in the voter’s wallet\nDiscussion link: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1142228456491458652\n\nGm Everyone!\n\nToday, I’m super excited to come here on behalf of Orium Network and unveil a Proposal we have been working on for the past few months: A new Aavegotchi Rental Protocol!!!\n\n## Why does the DAO need a new Rental Protocol?\n\nThe current Rental Protocol was specifically made for the Aavegotchi use case. It will take a great deal of time to add support for other NFTs, which would have to be implemented one at a time with much customisation.\n\nMoreover, the DAO does not benefit from Rental activity. 100% of the $GHST generated goes straight to the lender, meaning token holders are not rewarded even when the marketplace bursts with usage.\n\nFinally, the DAO needs a standard interface to list new NFTs when they are launched. There are many unexplored use cases for lending Wearables, Tiles, and Installations, and by providing a standard interface, the DAO will have an easy path to list these new assets.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nWe propose to create a custom implementation of [ERC-7432](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7432), including a contract that stores all role assignments for all NFTs of the Aavegotchi ecosystem. This approach will tremendously simplify how utility delegation is implemented since all logic will be centralised in a single contract owned by the DAO.\n\nHowever, it’s important to highlight that this proposal only covers Aavegotchis, Land Parcels, and Wearables. Other NFTs can still be listed, but we must review their current functionality to ensure they will work as expected.\n\n![image5.png](ipfs://bafkreias6ez32umpa72zjhesk2v62riz5fkvhffdfvoih4vlway7gydgmy)\n\nIn addition to the rental functionality users are already familiar with, this proposal includes the following features: Royalties, Non-Custodial Rentals, Direct Rentals, and Automatic Expiration.\n\n### Royalties\n\nCurrently, the DAO does not benefit from Rental activity. This proposal aims to change that by introducing royalties: a collection-based fee implemented by the new Rental Marketplace. With royalties, the DAO can decide through governance how much should be charged and where the funds should go.\n\n###  Non-Custodial Rentals\n\nUnlike conventional models where NFTs are transferred to the borrower’s wallet, Non-Custodial Rentals enable users to delegate utility while retaining the asset. This approach represents an important security feature since the ownership and utility are implemented separately. Furthermore, this functionality allows users to sell their NFTs even when rented.\n\n### Direct Rentals\n\nThere is no need for a marketplace when NFT Owners rent their assets without charging any tokens. Direct Rentals cover this scenario by allowing anyone to grant a role (delegate utility) without a marketplace listing.\n\n### Automatic Expiration\nTo end an Aavegotchi Rental, users must submit a “Claim” transaction after the expiration date. With ERC-7432, rentals will expire automatically, meaning users will not spend additional gas to reclaim their assets.\n\n## Deliverables & Timeline\nHere is a complete list of all the deliverables included in this Proposal:\n\n* Smart Contracts:\n  - Aavegotchi Diamond contract update.\n  - Land Parcel Diamond contract update.\n  - Wearables Diamond contract update.\n  - New Contract: Roles Registry (ERC-7432).\n* Subgraphs:\n  - Roles & Marketplace.\n* Front-End & Back-End:\n  - UI for Direct Rentals.\n  - UI for Marketplace.\n  - API to parse Subgraph data.\n\nAfter assessing the technical effort to implement the items above, the team estimated the development time in four months, which should be spent according to the image below:\n\n![image2.png](ipfs://bafkreickrkgkfwd2cdyquzuvamtqoglyqdbcncaaar6yjfotrrzdbvf74e)\n\nPlease note that it will take additional time to migrate the Rental Protocol once development is completed, which we will coordinate with Pixelcraft.\n\nAll deliverables will be transferred to the DAO control, except for the Front-End & Back-End. After consulting with the Pixelcraft team, we concluded that it might take too much back and forth between teams to design the Front-End according to the Aavegotchi guidelines. For this reason, the Front-End will initially be available at orium.network, and the DAO will incorporate it into aavegotchi.com on its own time.\n\nIt's also important to add that the Marketplace contract was not included in the deliverables. This contract will be open-source and will never hold Aavegotchi tokens. However, since this contract is deeply associated with the Front-End, the team will have to support it long-term. When the DAO adds the Front-End to aavegotchi.com, they will also redeploy this contract. Just like ERC-721, anyone can deploy their marketplace for ERC-7432.\n\n## Cost Breakdown\n\nThe team working on this project contains five full-time developers: three Solidity Engineers and 2 Full-Stack developers. Since we will spend four months developing the project, with an average compensation of 5,000 DAI per developer per month, the team is requesting a budget of 80,000 DAI to deliver this project.\n\nWe also suggest a payment schedule of three tranches:\n1. 20,000 DAI when the proposal is approved.\n2. 30,000 DAI when the Smart Contracts are delivered.\n3. 30,000 DAI when the Subgraphs and UI are delivered.\n\n## ROI (Return on Investment)\n\nThe ROI assessment of this Proposal can be evaluated through various metrics. Nevertheless, considering a purely financial ROI, the result would depend on the marketplace volume and the royalties established by the DAO. The following table estimates the financial ROI of this Proposal using a 3.5% royalty (which is the same as the Baazaar):\n\n| **Yearly Volume** | **Royalty** | **Yearly ROI** |\n|-------------------|-------------|----------------|\n| $500,000          | 3.5%        | 21.88%         |\n| $750,000          | 3.5%        | 32.81%         |\n| $1,000,000        | 3.5%        | 43.75%         |\n| $2,000,000        | 3.5%        | 87.50%         |\n\nAs demonstrated by the table above, the DAO would still earn a substantial return even in a low-volume year. However, many essential metrics were not included in this simulation. For example:\n* New use cases are unlocked by allowing users to borrow Land and Wearables.\n* User onboarding friction should decrease.\n* Crucial infrastructure will be created to enable more assets to be listed.\n\n## Why Orium?\n\nOrium has been actively building on the Gotchiverse since 2021. We maintain the most popular Petting Operator in the space and manage hundreds of Rentals through our Scholarship Platform.\n\nThe team is doxxed, has a track record of delivering high-quality open-source projects, and firmly believes in the mission of Aavegotchi.",

We realized a mishap with the voting system used (single choice instead of weighted). To stay true to the rules & the DAO’s preference, we are resubmitting our proposal.*\n\n### TLDR:\n\nThe Gotchi Heroes Reworked version is the culmination of valuable feedback received over the past year, representing our ultimate dream of creating a fun-to-play Aavegotchi Idle game. The key improvements and new features include:\n\n1. A full graphical revamp, encompassing game items, objects, battle scenes, and monsters, to enhance the visual experience. (Artwork Included)\n\n2. Fully animated battles between Aavegotchis and monsters, allowing you to witness epic fights and see your beloved gotchis in action. (Artwork Included)\n\n3. A completely redesigned UI/UX to provide a better and smoother gaming experience. (Artwork Included)\n\n4. The introduction of numerous new features, including account progression and leveling up, achievements, dungeon gameplay mode, a new in-game item crafting system, epic boss battles with a loot system, pet companions, and much more!\n\n5. Finally, we have worked on balancing the Leaderboard climbing experience by reducing the presence of pay-to-win elements and adding more in-game loot, objectives, and activities mentioned above.\n\n6. And yet, this is just the beginning of our journey with this newly improved Aavegotchi Idle game, which will soon be ready to be introduced to the entire blockchain world.\n\nTLDR.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### New Art Styles\n\n### Animated Combat (Featuring Innovative Animated Gotchis!

Initially with a small team and limited experience, we embarked on this journey to create an enjoyable, addictive game with real rewards. After nearly two years of dedicated effort and significant personal investment, we are proud to have brought our initial vision to life and gained a lot of experience throughout the journey. While I have funded the majority of the project, my ambition to fulfill the dream that inspired me remains unwavering. The fact that players are now engaged and participating in the game brings me immense joy and gratitude.\n\nAt SlowSundayGames, we've developed Gotchi Heroes, an IDLE gameplay journey where players use their Aavegotchis as characters. Through XP events and rewarding seasons, we've tested our backend servers and scalability successfully. However, to further enhance our offering, there are enhancements we need to make.\n\nGotchi Heroes aims to provide an immersive gaming experience on par with industry leaders. We plan to integrate Aavegotchi assets and other features to enhance the interface and bring our vision to life.\n\nOur vision extends beyond the present. We're excited about the prospects of transitioning to the Unity game engine and a full art revamp, a move that promises a refreshing, graphic design and a responsive user interface. This leap forward isn't just an upgrade; it's our ticket to unveiling new and exciting game mechanics, designed to captivate our gamers further.\n\nTo realize this vision, we seek financial support from the Aavegotchi DAO. Together, we aim to redefine gaming standards for Aavegotchi games and leave our mark in the blockchain gaming world.\n\n\n### New Feature Enhancements for Gotchi Heroes\n\n#### 1. Leveling System for Players During the Season\n\nIntroduce a player leveling system that progresses with in-game activity during each season. This system will provide players with a tangible sense of progression and reward for consistent participation.\n\n\n#### 2. Achievements\n\nIntroduce an achievement system with tasks and rewards, ensuring every player's experience is unique and promoting replayability.\n\n\n#### 3. Reworked Tokenomics of Our Token\n\nRevise the current tokenomics to ensure a sustainable and balanced in-game economy that's rewarding for players and investors alike.\n\n\n#### 4. New Items Crafting Mechanics and In-Game Currencies\n\nExpand the game's depth by introducing item crafting mechanics and additional in-game currencies.\n\n\n#### 5. Introduction of Gotchi Companions (Pets) and NFTs\n\nBoost in-game immersion by introducing battle companions for Gotchis.\n\n\n#### 6. Enhanced Player Onboarding with a Free-to-Play Focus\n\nImprove player onboarding by offering a more accessible entry point into the game, reducing the emphasis on owning a top-tier gotchi for high rankings.\n\n#### 7. Dungeons\n\nRather than having progressive levels, the game will now feature dungeons. Each dungeon will comprise of 10 levels.\n\n—\n\nThese are just some of the features that we will include in the new version of the game. More details can be found in the [Features Litepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dIyWXdrA2sKTsyYRx5Z9_sofJ0tvKTf4zm08Cloml2Y/edit?usp=sharing) that is a WIP progress full of new features that we can now include with the new game engine. \n\n\n\n### Roadmap\n\n#### Month 1: Planning and Preparation\n\n- Define scope and requirements for demo version\n- Finalize feature set and prioritize\n- Allocate resources and assign tasks\n- Set up project management tools and communication channels\n\n\n\n#### Month 2-3: Development of Demo Version\n\n- Begin frontend development (core gameplay, basic UI/UX)\n- Start graphical rework (key visual elements)\n- Begin backend development (server infrastructure, basic functionality)\n- Conduct regular progress meetings\n\n\n\n#### Month 4: Demo Release\n\n- Complete frontend development (functional gameplay, polished UI/UX)\n- Finalize graphical rework (polished visual elements)\n- Complete backend development (stable infrastructure, working features)\n- Conduct early private testing and bug fixing\n- Release public demo version for user feedback\n\n\n#### Month 5-6: New Features and Updates\n\n- Analyze user feedback and identify improvements\n- Plan and prioritize new features based on feedback\n- Allocate resources for implementation\n- Continue frontend and graphical development\n- Extend backend functionality and optimize performance\n- Conduct testing and bug fixing\n- Release updated version with new features\n\n\n#### Proposal\n\nThis proposal outlines our request for Aavegotchi DAO's support in migrating Gotchi Heroes to the Unity game engine and eventually the Gotchichain. This endeavor is not just a cosmetic upgrade; it's a comprehensive revamp of the game, from its core framework to its user interface. We are working with a game developer and game artist so the assets shown are real life examples of how the game will change. \n\nHow will Aavegotchi DAO Benefit?\nHere's what Aavegotchi DAO stands to gain:\n\nImproved Player Experience: By enhancing the graphics and incorporating fresh game mechanics, we promise a vastly improved and more immersive player experience.\n\nInclusion of Alchemica: The integration of Alchemica is already complete This move will offer new in-game actions and raise their utility.\n\nToken Burning: We plan to burn 50% of the Alchemica deployed for in-game actions, which will effectively serve as a sink for Aavegotchi tokens.\n\nWe project a budget of 50k DAI for this initiative. This figure encompasses the costs of redevelopment, graphic enhancement, testing, implementation, and subsequent maintenance.\n\n\n### Cost Breakdown\n\n\n#### 1.

      "title": "Revamp the Aavegotchi Rental Protocol to support Parcels and Wearables",
      "content": "Author: ernani.eth\nGotchi ID: #19417\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote Duration: 8 days\nXP reward: 20 XP to each AAvegotchi that is in the voter’s wallet\nDiscussion link: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1142228456491458652\n\nGm Everyone!\n\nToday, I’m super excited to come here on behalf of Orium Network and unveil a Proposal we have been working on for the past few months: A new Aavegotchi Rental Protocol!!!\n\n## Why does the DAO need a new Rental Protocol?\n\nThe current Rental Protocol was specifically made for the Aavegotchi use case. It will take a great deal of time to add support for other NFTs, which would have to be implemented one at a time with much customisation.\n\nMoreover, the DAO does not benefit from Rental activity. 100% of the $GHST generated goes straight to the lender, meaning token holders are not rewarded even when the marketplace bursts with usage.\n\nFinally, the DAO needs a standard interface to list new NFTs when they are launched. There are many unexplored use cases for lending Wearables, Tiles, and Installations, and by providing a standard interface, the DAO will have an easy path to list these new assets.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nWe propose to create a custom implementation of [ERC-7432](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7432), including a contract that stores all role assignments for all NFTs of the Aavegotchi ecosystem. This approach will tremendously simplify how utility delegation is implemented since all logic will be centralised in a single contract owned by the DAO.\n\nHowever, it’s important to highlight that this proposal only covers Aavegotchis, Land Parcels, and Wearables. Other NFTs can still be listed, but we must review their current functionality to ensure they will work as expected.\n\n![image5.png](ipfs://bafkreias6ez32umpa72zjhesk2v62riz5fkvhffdfvoih4vlway7gydgmy)\n\nIn addition to the rental functionality users are already familiar with, this proposal includes the following features: Royalties, Non-Custodial Rentals, Direct Rentals, and Automatic Expiration.\n\n### Royalties\n\nCurrently, the DAO does not benefit from Rental activity. This proposal aims to change that by introducing royalties: a collection-based fee implemented by the new Rental Marketplace. With royalties, the DAO can decide through governance how much should be charged and where the funds should go.\n\n###  Non-Custodial Rentals\n\nUnlike conventional models where NFTs are transferred to the borrower’s wallet, Non-Custodial Rentals enable users to delegate utility while retaining the asset. This approach represents an important security feature since the ownership and utility are implemented separately. Furthermore, this functionality allows users to sell their NFTs even when rented.\n\n### Direct Rentals\n\nThere is no need for a marketplace when NFT Owners rent their assets without charging any tokens. Direct Rentals cover this scenario by allowing anyone to grant a role (delegate utility) without a marketplace listing.\n\n### Automatic Expiration\nTo end an Aavegotchi Rental, users must submit a “Claim” transaction after the expiration date. With ERC-7432, rentals will expire automatically, meaning users will not spend additional gas to reclaim their assets.\n\n## Deliverables & Timeline\nHere is a complete list of all the deliverables included in this Proposal:\n\n* Smart Contracts:\n  - Aavegotchi Diamond contract update.\n  - Land Parcel Diamond contract update.\n  - Wearables Diamond contract update.\n  - New Contract: Roles Registry (ERC-7432).\n* Subgraphs:\n  - Roles & Marketplace.\n* Front-End & Back-End:\n  - UI for Direct Rentals.\n  - UI for Marketplace.\n  - API to parse Subgraph data.\n\nAfter assessing the technical effort to implement the items above, the team estimated the development time in four months, which should be spent according to the image below:\n\n![image2.png](ipfs://bafkreickrkgkfwd2cdyquzuvamtqoglyqdbcncaaar6yjfotrrzdbvf74e)\n\nPlease note that it will take additional time to migrate the Rental Protocol once development is completed, which we will coordinate with Pixelcraft.\n\nAll deliverables will be transferred to the DAO control, except for the Front-End & Back-End. After consulting with the Pixelcraft team, we concluded that it might take too much back and forth between teams to design the Front-End according to the Aavegotchi guidelines. For this reason, the Front-End will initially be available at orium.network, and the DAO will incorporate it into aavegotchi.com on its own time.\n\nIt's also important to add that the Marketplace contract was not included in the deliverables. This contract will be open-source and will never hold Aavegotchi tokens. However, since this contract is deeply associated with the Front-End, the team will have to support it long-term. When the DAO adds the Front-End to aavegotchi.com, they will also redeploy this contract. Just like ERC-721, anyone can deploy their marketplace for ERC-7432.\n\n## Cost Breakdown\n\nThe team working on this project contains five full-time developers: three Solidity Engineers and 2 Full-Stack developers. Since we will spend four months developing the project, with an average compensation of 5,000 DAI per developer per month, the team is requesting a budget of 80,000 DAI to deliver this project.\n\nWe also suggest a payment schedule of three tranches:\n1. 20,000 DAI when the proposal is approved.\n2. 30,000 DAI when the Smart Contracts are delivered.\n3. 30,000 DAI when the Subgraphs and UI are delivered.\n\n## ROI (Return on Investment)\n\nThe ROI assessment of this Proposal can be evaluated through various metrics. Nevertheless, considering a purely financial ROI, the result would depend on the marketplace volume and the royalties established by the DAO. The following table estimates the financial ROI of this Proposal using a 3.5% royalty (which is the same as the Baazaar):\n\n| **Yearly Volume** | **Royalty** | **Yearly ROI** |\n|-------------------|-------------|----------------|\n| $500,000          | 3.5%        | 21.88%         |\n| $750,000          | 3.5%        | 32.81%         |\n| $1,000,000        | 3.5%        | 43.75%         |\n| $2,000,000        | 3.5%        | 87.50%         |\n\nAs demonstrated by the table above, the DAO would still earn a substantial return even in a low-volume year. However, many essential metrics were not included in this simulation. For example:\n* New use cases are unlocked by allowing users to borrow Land and Wearables.\n* User onboarding friction should decrease.\n* Crucial infrastructure will be created to enable more assets to be listed.\n\n## Why Orium?\n\nOrium has been actively building on the Gotchiverse since 2021. We maintain the most popular Petting Operator in the space and manage hundreds of Rentals through our Scholarship Platform.\n\nThe team is doxxed, has a track record of delivering high-quality open-source projects, and firmly believes in the mission of Aavegotchi.",

      "title": "Brand Awareness Advertisement",
      "content": "https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/brand-awareness-advertisement/7093\n\nAuthor: flameviper_\nGotchi #8064\n\nRevised with plan B and talking points 1 through 6, see way further below:\n\nPlan A:\nI propose we advertise for 6 months on a 1000$ budget Aavegotchi.com .We can use Go Go Duppy as an ad to establish brand awareness. We will use Go Go Duppy as an ad on 4chan /co/ for mobile users specifically, it should avoid most of the bots on desktop which waste precious ad impressions. Go Go Duppy is basically an ad in itself for Aavegotchi which has been made for free, it would be wasteful not to put it to use as an ad for the main brand.\n\nIn plan A the ad would link to the webseries on Youtube which in return would link to the comic book and Aavegotchi website and gotchiverse. Plan B would link directly to another video explaining the game, which happens to be owned by the main Aavegotchi channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-crg4Dyt3g\n\nIt’s important to establish Aavegotchi as a multi-medium brand like many other brands such as Megaman, Sonic, Pokemon, Wakfu which touch multiple demographics that might not be interested in web3, but are interested in comics and cartoons and offer free advertisement by talking about the Aavegotchi comic book and webseries, by default they will reference the web3 game each time when they talk about the comic and webseries cause people will use Google to search for it thus granting Aavegotchi.com further top Google search results for SEO engagement.\nThe goal is to establish Aavegotchi as a brand that’s worth being copied by third parties to sell and offer us free advertisement through word of mouth, indirect advertisement and unintended advertisement by letting them discuss and sell their products with Aavegotchi in the name, just like Among Us having unofficial toys and merchandise everywhere in the world due to popularity despite Among Us being a video game primarily, not a music video series, not an animation series and not a toy brand.\n\nThe creator of Go Go Duppy has granted his blessings in the thread as well as agreed to link to the Margin’s Blade comic book through his webseries and link to the Aavegotchi.com website to use Go Go Duppy as an ad for the gotchiverse and Aavegotchi project.\n\nAavegotchi is lacking in mass exposure type advertising and interest for it is also lacking severely. Voting yes is voting that you’re interested in advertising Aavegotchi which you as an investor must be interested in to see the product you invested in reach Pokemon levels of popularity and value. Aavegotchi isn’t a secret clubhouse, we need to grow. We can keep a secret clubhouse through specific channels and NFTs, but that’s not the goal here.\n\nWe have to change this sentiment of “no advertisement, period, not even if it’s free” , it’s also about speed. A crypto bullrun only lasts 2 years total and the peak is the most important part. We already have enough content to advertise for and with, other crypto projects only have an avatar NFT that does nothing and they provide 20x more advertisement for something with 0 utility and 0 features.\nBasically every time we had minigames, especially for Gotchi Heroes we should have readily put an ad for it and made noise on Twitter.\n\nIt means a bigger community through advertisement which means together with new money, new buyers and new NFT collectors that are interested in far more aspects of Aavegotchi, not just Rarity Farming, growing our community means we’ll also receive developers to help build our web3 apps and participate in hackatons.\n\nWe attract new users with skills we require, especially people with connections who know toy factories, people who work at Steam, Youtube, Roblox, etc. marketers, Youtube celebrities, toy makers, Twitter celebrities, AI programmers and AI savvy people.\n\nWe are producing content without any advertisement backing it up. Building something on a low traffic network like Polygon isn’t helping us, most of the money is stuck on Ethereum and Bitcoin and the stock market.\nYou’re basically creating a party, but forgot to send out the invitations to everyone. Nobody knows what the Polygon network is. Nobody knows the party exists, nobody knows how to get there, nobody knows what the party even has to offer. By advertising Aavegotchi we are also indirectly advertising for Polygon which is a great thing, we can further make partnerships through Polygon and various DEXes on Polygon.\n\nWe need very long, very extended advertisement, not just one time for 1 week in 12 months like with Coingecko. We need our ads to stay up at least 6 months. We need to keep Aavegotchi in people’s minds so they check on it every few weeks and we nudge them a little when something big happens. If they know Aavegotchi exists in the first place then our updates such as -2 kinship, crafting, 3D gotchis will have much more impact, said users will be more interested, they’ll do word of mouth by themselves.\n\nExecution:\nI have made and handled 4chan ads before, originally through bid.glass, now I shall use danbo.org which is not my decision it’s 4chan’s decision. I know how to save on ad impressions, avoid the bots, make sure people see the ad without wasting too many ad impressions and especially I know how to keep it going long for 6 months without breaking bank.\n\n![f4c59522b1ed12018de038311cfd674e19965187_2_690x173.png](ipfs://bafkreib5rs6qbptvy6wk32fgpfipnxaglq36ixcf3axk6oikw6jqcmskyq)\nMy proposed duration for the ad is at least 6 months before it runs out of cash, as such I have to limit certain things such as the amount of times a user can see the same ad within 24h. Desktop ads may appear cheaper money wise, but the amount of bots and unengaged users on desktop is 5 times higher than on mobile. Certain hours have certain prices you have to compete with other ads for. Certain countries have a large amount of bots to human population, luckily most of these bots are on desktop.\nDanbo.org allows me to pick the devices, boards and countries I want and lets me see the amount of ad impressions vs. clicks. We are paying for ad impressions and there is no way to pay for clicks specifically. I can limit it to Linux and Mac users if I want to, but most users are on Windows.\nUnfortunately unlike bid.glass, danbo.org does not provide more detailed data I myself would love to have such as which country clicked the most and which country wasted the amount of ad impressions and at which hour and day so I can further polish the ad campaign in a more precise manner rather than shooting in the dark. I however know when the low and peak hours are.\nDanbo.org allows for Polygon USDC to be sent directly to them and converted instantly to $USDs\nThe money will be sent through Polygon USDC to an address of my choosing by contacting CoderDan who will contact the treasury governors.\n\nPlan A: Advertise on comics & cartoons related message & imageboard /co/ for 1000$ for 6 months and we use Go Go Duppy as an advertisement for free. Normally a webseries itself would cost an arm and a leg.\n\nPlan B: advertise on crypto-related message & image forum /biz/ which requires 6000$ for 6 months.\nThe large amount is because /biz/ is a much more expensive board filled to the brim with crypto ads and such the auction for each time slot to advertise our own ad increases significantly due to the quantity of competing ads especially at peak hours. Meanwhile on /co/ the prices are much smaller. The /biz/ campaign will be separate from the /co/ one to keep a closer eye on it.\nThe /biz/ campaign instead of linking to Go Go Duppy will instead link to the “How to buy your own Aavegotchi playable NFT | Aavegotchi” Gotchi U video and playlist https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgdlYYohW7g&list=PLnX_mZJN6kK8Ky18dioE6-9GJ9CTVNiAn&index=4\nI can also modify where the ad links to at any time. I can also modify any aspect of the ad and I can pause the campaign and create a new ad campaign.\n\nDrawbacks: Advertisement might not have its intended effect of creating word of mouth exposure or attracting pleasant people to our project & community or result in any significant effect.\n\nThe ad content is already made and free to use as opposed to having to pay for the ad video itself.\nThe “Go Go Duppy!” webseries in question:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLn-q1vaPZSYdtqHPIUfKsKc7ilZm2F8YJ&v=hQKOjKM2VtE",

      "content": "Author: Network_Hustler\nGotchi ID: Hustli 8748\nRealm ID: Spacious 8144 - District 2\nQuorum requirements: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 8 days\nForum thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/2023-spain-portugal-bicycle-adventure-lap-35-45-days-sponsorship-partnership/5704/37\n\n\nHello fellow Gotchis.\n\nFirst of all, I need to thank you all for such positive feedback on my idea, I appreciate that and want to say that is motivating me to do even harder challenges.\n\nIn this DAO Proposal, I would like to refer to an already widely discussed and welcomed with positive feedback topic about the luscious potential Sponsorship/Partnership Marketing Deal opportunity regarding my IRL Bicycle Journey/Challenge.\n\nSo, let me explain to those who weren't in the discussion.\n\nI have put myself a challenge to cycle all around the whole Iberian Penisula region using only the strength of my own muscles, my goal is to draw a big circle on a map and finish where I started. \n\nI know the challenge is big and some might not believe people are doing such things, but this is not my first adventure-challenge, my first one was walking all around the whole Poland country, which took 103 days and was so viral and successful that we finished with an interview in national TV.\n\nThe challenge is so hard, that even my 3 previous team members about which I was talking in the forum topic, completely backed out and because of that, I am going on the journey alone as 1 team solo army. I am calculating that the whole route can take me up to 4500 kilometers of cycling and last\neven 44 days or more.\n\nTo spice that adventure up I will sleep in the wilderness in my tent or hammock.\n\nWhole journey is going to be recorded using GoPro 11 with full attachments and additionally with Xiaomi MI 10T.\n\nVideo content will be recorded in English and Polish language, all content is going to be daily posted/streamed on my non-web3 journey-related Polish social media which is Facebook and Instagram, and English web3 crypto-related Twitter profile. After returning home from cycling, all gathered materials will be used to create YouTube videos which will be in both languages for both audiences.\n\nThere will be hundreds of gigabytes of videos, and around 44 days of cycling should be edited into around 6-15 full YouTube episodes, they are going to be partially launched on YouTube, even a long time afterwise the journey, I will add all of them and fulfill what was\nstarted regarding the time passed.\n\nNow let's go to the part - what's the goal about.\n\nThis is really simple, my character is a leader path and since my young years, I loved to raise people up, boost their motivation, and help them to be better selves.\n\nWhen I started networking after I left my country looking for work I learned how big leverage is that activity and how big things we can achieve thanks to the Internet. Normal 9-5 work was not for more because I felt useless there and was born for something completely different, one day, I simply thought that I won't care anymore about my current job and problems and I just want to start living, to start feeling the life.\n\nI knew that when I will do something big with ease and show that to people, they will be inspired and follow me to do something with their lives too. Doing things that people aren't aware that someone was capable of, or things that people don't believe, makes them change their minds about themselves and makes them wonder why they are not doing more.\n\nBuilding people up is something that builds me, and thanks to that, while I can simply have fun and push my own limits, I can at the exact same time show that to people that it is not\nhard at all but it is a pleasure to try.\n\nMy goal is to simply, motivate people to live more, to care less, to show them that not only the destination point is important but the road itself too. Since my motivation and goal is like\nthat, I want to connect with the possibly healthiest community and project in the space which I am invested in almost since the start.\n\nI believe that the Aavegotchi Ghost theme, will show people even more how important are their lives and show them how important are good helpful people/communities around them.\n\nI do not see possibly any other better-fitting community here as Aavegotchi is already one of the most known on the whole crypto scene and one of the few biggest regarding members and DAO activity.\n\nEach met Aavegotchi holder shows really strong vibes and resonates with kind aura, this is attracting for people like a magnet, but we need to show Aavegotchi to people, who didn't see them yet, and that's the main cause of that proposal.\n\nTo promote Aavegotchi worldwide thanks to my double-languaged viral  video content and to bring masses not only from outside the Aavegotchi ecosystem but also outside the whole web3 scene.\n\nMy proposal is to create an official Sponsorship/Partnership deal so whole journey will be signed under the official Aavegotchi wing.\n\nIn return for the sponsorship, I commit to promoting the Aavegotchi brand and\ncommunity in various ways.\n\nThis includes:\n- Incorporating Aavegotchi content into our adventure videos.\n(Putting logos, fonts, Aavegotchis and with every other possible way)\n- Wearing Aavegotchi-branded merchandise during our journey.\n(T-shirts, Flags, stickers on my equipment and whatever other is possible)\n- Creating dedicated promotional videos for Aavegotchi.\n(Videos in which I talk strictly bout Aavegotchi and explain the project + simple mentions)\n- Creating dedicated promotional threads for Aavegotchi.\n(+ tagging in my content tweets etc.)\n- Displaying the Aavegotchi logo on all our official adventure videos.\n(Exactly the created YouTube episodes and adding everywhere information about the official\npartnership)\n- Leaving Aavegotchi-branded stickers throughout Spain and Portugal.\n(Randomly sticking to places where it is possible, or giving away to people explaining what it is)\n\nAdditional possibilities:\n- Engaging the community to redeem daily Aavegotchi-Adventures squad collab POAPs.\n(This is hard to do as a solo team member, would need help with)\n- Gamifying content and me as a player making possible bets/wagers bycommunities or raising challenges.\n(Loose idea to think about wider)\n\nOur Sponsorship/Partnership deal is not limited to those services and we might together think about how to potentially do it better.\n\nTo make that deal happen and realize my vision with that Partnership deal I would like to get paid only expenses which I will spend on food through whole cycling and transport of me + bicycle back and forth by plane.\nMy calculations are saying I can spend about 30$ daily per food and 1 way ticket altogether with a bicycle is about 200$.\n\nSince my offer is genuine and I do not look to earn anyhow on that Partnership, I am asking only to cover the food and flight expenses, but my own expenses on equipment and\nplanning were of course much bigger, but I am not, and will never ask for them.\n\nI believe that in this way, helping me to eat well daily I can happily tell and show who is feeding me and sponsoring that, what people are watching.\n\nI do not want to extort the DAO for big expenses and money, I am trying to using my content as leverage, and help both of the sides with small efforts simply just connecting us each\nother.\n\nI believe that the push of the Aavegotchi community and project will raise numbers of my content visibility really high in WEB3 spaces, combining that with my reach to the WEB2\nfanbase, would bring a lot of new eyes to the official sponsor which is Aavegotchi.\n\nTotal expenses if my journey would last 44 days would be around - 30$x44 + 2x200$ = 1720$, which we can round to 1700-1800$ for promoting Aavegotchi through the whole journey each next day and afterwise still proudly promoting Aavegotchi by posting on YouTube content. This makes me think, that that opportunity is really luscious for both of the sides as my demands are low, but the outcome which I want to give is worth much more and will be very long.\n\nIf my journey will last shorter than expected or I will finish somehow by unplanned accident, I will return the payment.\n\nFunds can be sent after vote or I can without problems pay expenses from my own pocket and accept the payment afterwise I finish the trip.\n\nFunds can be transferred to address:\n\nzmotykanaslonce.eth - 0xE59CBF4Fb2bf1a90A620dB7001B8d62a440d55f1\n\nAny cryptocurrency of calculated $ worthiness at the moment of transfer is okay but preferably if it is GHST.\n\nBut this is not all, and independently from the vote results I have already started making my PLAN B how I want to promote the Aavegotchi for free.\n\n(I just like the Gotchis)\n\nDoesn't matter what will be the outcome, yes or no, I have already designed and decorated my Spacious Realm Number 8144 which will act as a marketing billboard for my Bicycle trip, I have spent about 100$ for that but now I am proud of my realm and this are also my own expenses.\n\nUsing this realm I want to create Twitter contests/giveaways or random picks in which my followers or people watching the content will be able to win Whitelist and claim my resources for free and/or additionally make inside realms events in which I will attract Aavegotchis to come into my realm by raising the event to #1 place.\n\nThanks to that many eyes will see how Aavegotchi looks like from the inside but also for aavegotchi holders to check what is my trip about.\n \n\nThis realm/billboard will further additionally work as an ad space for an Fakegotchi NFT Art which I created together with my friend. \nThe art piece is currently in the queue and you can vote and gib hearts here:\n\nhttps://www.fakegotchis.com/queue/399\n\nThis is my main move here because even if it is Fakegotchi Art, I will try to sell as many as possible to mainly only users from outside of the Aavegotchi community.\n\nI want to attract completely new people into the ecosystem as a thank you word for everything and just because like that.\n\nArt will be minted in all 100 pieces to potentially use the full opportunity and bring about 100 new Fakegotchi holders and users, each of them will dig deeper with big probability.\n\nThank you for each of the votes and hope to connect in this extraordinary,\nfirst-mover web3 connected cycling trip.",

      "title": "[AGIP 93] Alchemica spending Competition - Season 3",
      "content": "Authors,: Rikige, Hardkor\nGotchi ID: #12543, #20019\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\nXP reward: 20 XP to each AAvegotchi that is in the voter’s wallet\nDiscussion link: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1131451897774100510\n\nHey frens, \nFollowing the success of Season 1 and Season 2, we would like to propose Alchemica Spending Competion Season 3. New season parameters reflect learning from the previous seasons + there is more than GHST prize this time.\n\nSeason 3 parameters:\n\n2 one –week rounds \n(Most of the activity came within first two weeks of competition, and so this should be the focus)\n\nWeek one:  28 August (Monday) to 3 September (Sunday)\nWeek two: 4 September (Monday) to 10 September (Sunday) \n\n30k GSHT reward for each round funded from gotchiverse player rewards wallet\n\nMultiplier for both weeks will be the same: 1.8x – 1.6 – 1.4x – 1.3x – 1.2x – 1.1x – 1x\n(We believe this give incentive to build early, moving focus from the “last minute” spenders as they would have bigger cost to move up in the leaderboard)\n\nTop 100 places paid each round\n (We want to experiment with longer tail. The kinship burn mechanic had a major impact on the alchemica emission. We saw about 300% reduction in alchemica emissions from channeling, and therefore we think this season could attract some new builders inside gotchiverse)\n\nPrize allocation each week (GHST):\n1st is  6900\n2nd  is 4050\n3rd  is 2550\n4th is 1950\n5th  is 1650\n6th is 1170\n7th  is 870\n8th is 570\n9th is 390\n10th is 300\n11-15th is 300\n16-20th is 210\n21-25th is 180\n26-30th is 150\n31-35th is  135\n36-40th is 120\n41-50th is  84\n51-60th is  72\n61-75th is  66\n76-100th is 63\n(The payout structure was engineered by SOLOEGOIST based on the WSOP payout structure which is historically proofed to be effective)\n\nWINNING should feel awesome - FAKE + Reward from Pixelcraft:\n\nTOTAL WINNER of competiton will get a unique “Statue” decoration from Pixelcraft once the 3D Gothiverse launches, there will be only 1 statue like this inside the Gotchiverse.\n\nWINNER of each week get a “Trophie” Fake from SOJU (preview in post), so it’s going to be 2 out of 2 fake (super rare)\n\nFIRST to TENTH place for each week get a “Medal” Fake from SOJU (preview in post), so it’s going to be 20 out of 20 fake (still quite rare)\n\nSOJUs work is commissioned, and would be sent to SOJUs wallet 0x8CbF96319b3C56d50a7C82EFb6d3c46bD6f889Ba after the FAKES are delivered to the winners. The price of commission is 250 GHST for each fake + 70 GHST floor for 1 FAKE card, so in total 640 GHST payed from Gotchiverse reward pool \n\n![Preview.jpg](ipfs://bafybeib4ck4gmxm55gshbvu6rwjemfaj7cj2sd3qwml4lz6lfc4h76pbqa)\n\nTotal budget for competion: 60640 GHST  from “Gotchiverse player rewards wallet”\n\n![image.png](ipfs://bafkreidxww6zprhy4enw6azp27arj76xmz5or3r5nhyqkqh654syicfdxa)\n\nThe rules:\nAll on-chain transactions count, same as season 1 and season 2\nWe have Altars / Harvesters / Reservoirs / NFT Displays / ITEM SHOP to spend alchemica on\n\nFinal words:\nWe believe this competition could “flush out” plenty of alchemica from circulation. The effect should be longer term, as the channeling emissions are reduced after kinship burn implementation.  At the same time, we would incentive more builders to come to gotchiverse, and potentially turn them into alchemica bulls.",

      "title": "Advertisement Go Go Duppy!",
      "content": "Author: flameviper_\nGotchi #8064\n\nI propose we spend 1000$ on putting an ad for Go Go Duppy the webseries on 4chan /co/ for mobile users specifically, it should avoid most of the bots on desktop which waste precious ad impressions.\nWe would also not allow certain countries due to a huge amount of bots. Namely India & China, as well as Russia, Africa, South America.\nThe ad would link to the webseries on Youtube. The webseries would also link to the comic book and Aavegotchi website and web3 game.\n\nThe goal is to establish Aavegotchi as a brand that’s worth being copied by third parties to sell and offer us free advertisement, just like Among Us having unofficial toys and merchandise everywhere in the world due to popularity.\nIt's important to establish Aavegotchi as a multi-medium brand like many other brands such as Megaman, Sonic, Pokemon, Wakfu which touch multiple demographics that might not be interested in web3, but are interested in comics and cartoons.\n\nThe creator of Go Go Duppy has granted his blessings in the thread as well as agreed to link to the Margin's Blade comic book through his webseries.\n\nPlan B: advertise it somewhere else. (implies a much bigger budget)\n\nDrawbacks: Advertisement might not have its intended effect of creating word of mouth exposure or attracting pleasant people to our project & community or result in any significant effect.\n\nThe \"Go Go Duppy!\" webseries in question:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLn-q1vaPZSYdtqHPIUfKsKc7ilZm2F8YJ&v=hQKOjKM2VtE",

      "title": "Alchemica spending competion - season 3",
      "content": "Author: Rikige#0073\nGotchi ID: #12543\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\nXP reward: 20 XP to each AAvegotchi that is in the voter’s wallet\nDiscussion link: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1131451897774100510\n\nHey frens, \nFollowing the success of Season 1 and Season 2, we would like to propose Alchemica Spending Competion Season 3. New season parameters reflect learning from the previous seasons + there is more than GHST prize this time.\n\nSeason 3 parameters:\n\n2 one –week rounds \n(Most of the activity came within first two weeks of competition, and so this should be the focus)\n\nWeek one:  28 August (Monday) to 3 September (Sunday)\nWeek two: 4 September (Monday) to 10 September (Sunday) \n\n30k GSHT reward for each round funded from gotchiverse player rewards wallet\n\nMultiplier for both weeks will be the same: 1.8x – 1.6 – 1.4x – 1.3x – 1.2x – 1.1x – 1x\n(We believe this give incentive to build early, moving focus from the “last minute” spenders as they would have bigger cost to move up in the leaderboard)\n\nTop 100 places paid each round\n (We want to experiment with longer tail. The kinship burn mechanic had a major impact on the alchemica emission. We saw about 300% reduction in alchemica emissions from channeling, and therefore we think this season could attract some new builders inside gotchiverse)\n\nPrize allocation each week (GHST):\n1st is  6900\n2nd  is 4050\n3rd  is 2550\n4th is 1950\n5th  is 1650\n6th is 1170\n7th  is 870\n8th is 570\n9th is 390\n10th is 300\n11-15th is 300\n16-20th is 210\n21-25th is 180\n26-30th is 150\n31-35th is  135\n36-40th is 120\n41-50th is  84\n51-60th is  72\n61-75th is  66\n76-100th is 63\n(The payout structure was engineered by SOLOEGOIST based on the WSOP payout structure which is historically proofed to be effective)\n\nWINNING should feel awesome - FAKE + Reward from Pixelcraft:\n\nTOTAL WINNER of competiton will get a unique “Statue” decoration from Pixelcraft once the 3D Gothiverse launches, there will be only 1 statue like this inside the Gotchiverse.\n\nWINNER of each week get a “Trophie” Fake from SOJU (preview in post), so it’s going to be 2 out of 2 fake (super rare)\n\nFIRST to TENTH place for each week get a “Medal” Fake from SOJU (preview in post), so it’s going to be 20 out of 20 fake (still quite rare)\n\nSOJUs work is commissioned, and would be sent to SOJUs wallet 0x8CbF96319b3C56d50a7C82EFb6d3c46bD6f889Ba after the FAKES are delivered to the winners. The price of commission is 250 GHST for each fake + 70 GHST floor for 1 FAKE card, so in total 640 GHST payed from Gotchiverse reward pool \n\n![Preview.jpg](ipfs://bafybeib4ck4gmxm55gshbvu6rwjemfaj7cj2sd3qwml4lz6lfc4h76pbqa)\n\nTotal budget for competion: 60640 GHST  from “Gotchiverse player rewards wallet”\n\n![image.png](ipfs://bafkreidxww6zprhy4enw6azp27arj76xmz5or3r5nhyqkqh654syicfdxa)\n\nThe rules:\nAll on-chain transactions count, same as season 1 and season 2\nWe have Altars / Harvesters / Reservoirs / NFT Displays / ITEM SHOP to spend alchemica on\n\nFinal words:\nWe believe this competition could “flush out” plenty of alchemica from circulation. The effect should be longer term, as the channeling emissions are reduced after kinship burn implementation.  At the same time, we would incentive more builders to come to gotchiverse, and potentially turn them into alchemica bulls.",

      "content": "Author: Network_Hustler\nGotchi ID: Hustli 8748\nRealm ID: Spacious 8144 - District 2\nQuorum requirements: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 8 days\nForum thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/2023-spain-portugal-bicycle-adventure-lap-35-45-days-sponsorship-partnership/5704/37\n\n\nHello fellow Gotchis.\n\nFirst of all, I need to thank you all for such positive feedback on my idea, I appreciate that and want to say that is motivating me to do even harder challenges.\n\nIn this DAO Proposal, I would like to refer to an already widely discussed and welcomed with positive feedback topic about the luscious potential Sponsorship/Partnership Marketing Deal opportunity regarding my IRL Bicycle Journey/Challenge.\n\nSo, let me explain to those who weren't in the discussion.\n\nI have put myself a challenge to cycle all around the whole Iberian Penisula region using only the strength of my own muscles, my goal is to draw a big circle on a map and finish where I started. \n\nI know the challenge is big and some might not believe people are doing such things, but this is not my first adventure-challenge, my first one was walking all around the whole Poland country, which took 103 days and was so viral and successful that we finished with an interview in national TV.\n\nThe challenge is so hard, that even my 3 previous team members about which I was talking in the forum topic, completely backed out and because of that, I am going on the journey alone as 1 team solo army. I am calculating that the whole route can take me up to 4500 kilometers of cycling and last\neven 44 days or more.\n\nTo spice that adventure up I will sleep in the wilderness in my tent or hammock.\n\n\nWhole journey is going to be recorded using GoPro 11 with full attachments and additionally with Xiaomi MI 10T.\n\nVideo content will be recorded in English and Polish language, all content is going to be daily posted/streamed on my non-web3 journey-related Polish social media which is Facebook and Instagram, and English web3 crypto-related Twitter profile. After returning home from cycling, all gathered materials will be used to create YouTube videos which will be in both languages for both audiences.\n\nThere will be hundreds of gigabytes of videos, and around 44 days of cycling should be edited into around 6-15 full YouTube episodes, they are going to be partially launched on YouTube, even a long time afterwise the journey, I will add all of them and fulfill what was\nstarted regarding the time passed.\n\nNow let's go to the part - what's the goal about.\n\nThis is really simple, my character is a leader path and since my young years, I loved to raise people up, boost their motivation, and help them to be better selves.\n\nWhen I started networking after I left my country looking for work I learned how big leverage is that activity and how big things we can achieve thanks to the Internet. Normal 9-5 work was not for more because I felt useless there and was born for something completely different, one day, I simply thought that I won't care anymore about my current job and problems and I just want to start living, to start feeling the life.\n\nI knew that when I will do something big with ease and show that to people, they will be inspired and follow me to do something with their lives too. Doing things that people aren't aware that someone was capable of, or things that people don't believe, makes them change their minds about themselves and makes them wonder why they are not doing more.\n\nBuilding people up is something that builds me, and thanks to that, while I can simply have fun and push my own limits, I can at the exact same time show that to people that it is not\nhard at all but it is a pleasure to try.\n\nMy goal is to simply, motivate people to live more, to care less, to show them that not only the destination point is important but the road itself too. Since my motivation and goal is like\nthat, I want to connect with the possibly healthiest community and project in the space which I am invested in almost since the start.\n\nI believe that the Aavegotchi Ghost theme, will show people even more how important are their lives and show them how important are good helpful people/communities around them.\n\nI do not see possibly any other better-fitting community here as Aavegotchi is already one of the most known on the whole crypto scene and one of the few biggest regarding members and DAO activity.\n\nEach met Aavegotchi holder shows really strong vibes and resonates with kind aura, this is attracting for people like a magnet, but we need to show Aavegotchi to people, who didn't see them yet, and that's the main cause of that proposal.\n\nTo promote Aavegotchi worldwide thanks to my double-languaged viral  video content and to bring masses not only from outside the Aavegotchi ecosystem but also outside the whole web3 scene.\n\nMy proposal is to create an official Sponsorship/Partnership deal so whole journey will be signed under the official Aavegotchi wing.\n\nIn return for the sponsorship, I commit to promoting the Aavegotchi brand and\ncommunity in various ways.\n\nThis includes:\n- Incorporating Aavegotchi content into our adventure videos.\n(Putting logos, fonts, Aavegotchis and with every other possible way)\n- Wearing Aavegotchi-branded merchandise during our journey.\n(T-shirts, Flags, stickers on my equipment and whatever other is possible)\n- Creating dedicated promotional videos for Aavegotchi.\n(Videos in which I talk strictly bout Aavegotchi and explain the project + simple mentions)\n- Creating dedicated promotional threads for Aavegotchi.\n(+ tagging in my content tweets etc.)\n- Displaying the Aavegotchi logo on all our official adventure videos.\n(Exactly the created YouTube episodes and adding everywhere information about the official\npartnership)\n- Leaving Aavegotchi-branded stickers throughout Spain and Portugal.\n(Randomly sticking to places where it is possible, or giving away to people explaining what it is)\n\nAdditional possibilities:\n- Engaging the community to redeem daily Aavegotchi-Adventures squad collab POAPs.\n(This is hard to do as a solo team member, would need help with)\n- Gamifying content and me as a player making possible bets/wagers bycommunities or raising challenges.\n(Loose idea to think about wider)\n\nOur Sponsorship/Partnership deal is not limited to those services and we might together think about how to potentially do it better.\n\nTo make that deal happen and realize my vision with that Partnership deal I would like to get paid only expenses which I will spend on food through whole cycling and transport of me + bicycle back and forth by plane.\nMy calculations are saying I can spend about 30$ daily per food and 1 way ticket altogether with a bicycle is about 200$.\n\nSince my offer is genuine and I do not look to earn anyhow on that Partnership, I am asking only to cover the food and flight expenses, but my own expenses on equipment and\nplanning were of course much bigger, but I am not, and will never ask for them.\n\nI believe that in this way, helping me to eat well daily I can happily tell and show who is feeding me and sponsoring that, what people are watching.\n\nI do not want to extort the DAO for big expenses and money, I am trying to using my content as leverage, and help both of the sides with small efforts simply just connecting us each\nother.\n\nI believe that the push of the Aavegotchi community and project will raise numbers of my content visibility really high in WEB3 spaces, combining that with my reach to the WEB2\nfanbase, would bring a lot of new eyes to the official sponsor which is Aavegotchi.\n\nTotal expenses if my journey would last 44 days would be around - 30$x44 + 2x200$ = 1720$, which we can round to 1700-1800$ for promoting Aavegotchi through the whole journey each next day and afterwise still proudly promoting Aavegotchi by posting on YouTube content. This makes me think, that that opportunity is really luscious for both of the sides as my demands are low, but the outcome which I want to give is worth much more and will be very long.\n\nIf my journey will last shorter than expected or I will finish somehow by unplanned accident, I will return the payment.\n\nFunds can be sent after vote or I can without problems pay expenses from my own pocket and accept the payment afterwise I finish the trip.\n\nFunds can be transferred to address:\n\nzmotykanaslonce.eth - 0xE59CBF4Fb2bf1a90A620dB7001B8d62a440d55f1\n\nAny cryptocurrency of calculated $ worthiness at the moment of transfer is okay but preferably if it is GHST.\n\nBut this is not all, and independently from the vote results I have already started making my PLAN B how I want to promote the Aavegotchi for free.\n\n(I just like the Gotchis)\n\nDoesn't matter what will be the outcome, yes or no, I have already designed and decorated my Spacious Realm Number 8144 which will act as a marketing billboard for my Bicycle trip, I have spent about 100$ for that but now I am proud of my realm and this are also my own expenses.\n\nUsing this realm I want to create Twitter contests/giveaways or random picks in which my followers or people watching the content will be able to win Whitelist and claim my resources for free and/or additionally make inside realms events in which I will attract Aavegotchis to come into my realm by raising the event to #1 place.\n\nThanks to that many eyes will see how Aavegotchi looks like from the inside but also for aavegotchi holders to check what is my trip about.\n \n\nThis realm/billboard will further additionally work as an ad space for an Fakegotchi NFT Art which I created together with my friend. \nThe art piece is currently in the queue and you can vote and gib hearts here:\n\nhttps://www.fakegotchis.com/queue/399\n\nThis is my main move here because even if it is Fakegotchi Art, I will try to sell as many as possible to mainly only users from outside of the Aavegotchi community.\n\nI want to attract completely new people into the ecosystem as a thank you word for everything and just because like that.\n\nArt will be minted in all 100 pieces to potentially use the full opportunity and bring about 100 new Fakegotchi holders and users, each of them will dig deeper with big probability.\n\nThank you for each of the votes and hope to connect in this extraordinary,\nfirst-mover web3 connected cycling trip.",

      "title": "[AGIP 91] Gotchi Crawler Demo Proposal",
      "content": "**Author:** Oliver Spoon\n**Gotchi ID:** Mescaline 2415\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**Forum and Discord Threads:**\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/gotchi-crawler-demo-litepaper-and-funding-request/6936\nhttps://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1133041966985257000\n**Litepaper:**\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1QFy8ko6TtrLZyF47Uwobc-MWTqn0mt6MuACzhppW_hs/edit?usp=sharing\n\nHello frens,\n\nIt is with great pleasure to bring forward to you today a proposal for the long-anticipated Gotchi Crawler! Slick and I have teamed up to bring to the community a demo for the game. \n\n![Sample Map.png](ipfs://bafybeibizxphbjmzvok6k5dof6j2ubbpqff42z2sjxl47r5vseul3753na)\n\n### What is Gotchi Crawler?\n\nGotchi Crawler is a single or multiplayer (up to three) roguelike dungeon crawler. Players must descend, gather treasure and fight off swarms of enemies along the way. On each floor multiple of ten there is a merchant floor where players may exit the mines, capturing their score. Or, they can choose to descend further. Take note, if they die or run out of time before exiting, their score will be zero!\nSimply put, the core gameplay loop is enter mines, descend, gather treasure, exit / die, skill up, descend further, repeat\nThe game is designed in such a way to facilitate solo play, however you are at great advantage to play as a team!\n\n### A Boon for Asset Holders\n\nOne of the core design principles is how to bring value back to the community? While creating a fun game is priority #1, we also want to build mechanisms that give fresh new utility to existing Aavegotchi assets. One thing we are really keen on is finding value for as many protocol assets as possible. These concepts are slated for the alpha release and beyond.\n\n### The Road Ahead\n\nThe game will launch in a series of stages: demo, alpha, beta, and the final game. The purpose of the demo is to establish the core gameplay loop. From the demo phase, we will have a better understanding of the scope for the full game and what it will require from the perspective of funding and additional team. We are confident in our abilities to deliver the demo as outlined below:\n\n\nTarget launch: Mid October, 2023\n1. Multiplayer:\n* 1-3 players\n* Client side prediction for lag-free games\n2. Levels:\n* Three types -battle, adventure, and puzzle\n* Randomly spawn destructible objects\n* Single biome, the underground forest\n3. Destructible objects - these can contain:\n* GLTR points (this is how high scores are tracked in the MVP),\n* Ladders which allow the team to progress to lower level,\n* Lil Essence which if captured adds essence to the essence timer\n4. Battle:\n* Health/AP bars for gotchis\n* In-game stats based on gotchi traits\n* Geode smasher & fireball weapons\n* Dash mechanic for gotchis\n* Enemies with health bars only (no mage creeps yet!)\n* Simple enemy AI (roaming with an aggro range trigger)\n5. Puzzles\n* Team-dependent pressure switches implemented into the levels\n* Special doors that can only be opened with switches that (usually) contain treasure\n6. Essence timer:\n* Shared timer for all team mates\n* Approximately 15 minutes of play\n* Capture “Lil Essence” to increase play time\n7. Scoring:\n* GLTR = points\n* One score per gotchi\n8. Merchant / exit floor:\n* every multiple of 10, players will be able to escape and capture their score or descend lower\n9. Gameover screen:\n* Appears for a gotchi if their HP goes to zero\n* Appears for entire team if Essence goes to zero\n10. Sound FX & background song\n11. Leaderboard:\n* Per gotchi\n* XP event (TBC and pending Pixelcraft approval)\n\nWe believe this will give enough of a gameplay experience for the community to enjoy, provide feedback for, and determine whether they wish for the game development to continue.\n\n### Funding Request\nWe are seeking a grant request of $58,000 with a 4,000 GHST bounty. \n\n$32,000 DAI Oliver Spoon for project management, game design, and game assets\n$24,000 DAI Slick for development\n4,000 GHST for bounty and outsourcing components\n$2,000 DAI for server maintenance\n\n### Funding Disbursement\nBounty and server funds to be released up-front.\nPay funds to be released 1/2 up front and in two further tranches as follows:\n\n**Upon Core prop passing:**\n18,000 DAI and 4,000 GHST to 0xa2e3680A18aBAfEff813E8aA67AEfB49bf078C86\n12,000 DAI to \n0xA21329fec88d918d05f1D906dBb363E61Af76355\n\n **September 15:**\n14,000 DAI to 0xa2e3680A18aBAfEff813E8aA67AEfB49bf078C86\n\n**October 15:**\n14,000 DAI to 0xa2e3680A18aBAfEff813E8aA67AEfB49bf078C86\n\n### Alpha Phase and Beyond\nPlease see the litepaper for the full alpha phase plans.\n\n### Closing Remarks\nI’ve spoken with Jesse and our vision is in line with theirs regarding IP usage. This project concept has been refined over many months. Please have a read through the litepaper to see all that is in store. \n\nAs always, thank you for your support!",

      "title": "[AGIP 89] Forge 2.0 New Schematics, Methodology, and Godlike Sets",
      "content": "Author:  dr.wagmi\nGotchi ID: 16635\nDiscussion: \nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/geodes-and-forge-2-0-new-schematics-and-distribution/6167\n\nTakeaway Points:\n-\tWe propose 14 new schematics designed by the Forge Team\n-\tMikeyJay’s methodology was used for trait/set selection and should guide any future releases\n-\tWe propose 4 new four-piece godlike sets to give all 16 gotchi types access to such a set\n-\tNew godlikes maximally incorporate “old/classic” wearables\n\nNew Schematics\nThe Forge Team has been working diligently on standardizing and improving the process of new content releases. Intermittent wearable releases have been a staple of engagement for our community and comprise the majority of protocol engagement thus far. New content release comes with extensive backend work, however, especially as the Pixelcraft team transitions all assets to 3D in light of the rebranding and Gotchi Guardians. To this end, it’s imperative that trait and set selection be deliberate and equitable to all gotchi types. This will maximize the available wearables per gotchi, satisfy unmet demand, balance rarity farming, and provide a more balanced collection of assets on which 3rd party games can be built.\n\nHere are the proposed new wearables with rarity tier, slot, and specific trait modification:\n  \n![image](ipfs://bafybeib3vvab2ynrel5vvgyogua3kh4izh4tuudk7cnausxthmtaxof6pi)\n    \n\nSpecial Notes for this release:\n-\t“Best choice” is defined by highest impact on standard deviation impact for slot/rarity for each wearable. In simpler terms, the best choice is the one that fills the most trait gaps.\n-\tBest choice was chosen for all wearables with a single exception of Godlike Hands:\no\tThe Godlike Hands item was the best choice that provided a path to balance four-piece godlike sets which needed NRG-, BRN- specifically.\n-\tSpecific slot selection accounted for unmatched cores from the Forge 1.0 sale \n\nMikeyJay’s methodology is outlined in this intensive 13 page document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D9e2FEh5NnYXrPEK28UF7GWpsI1ybOsCY94x1kGCpJs/edit\n\nSpecific trait selections by rarity tier and slot are outlined in this spreadsheet:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y8geMG-uI7yZMn3khWnTzwOLD7_r6kRQawU9kqeMGGg/edit#gid=562462486\n\nThe data set can be updated in the future and serve as a community-facing guideline for new wearable releases. This will allow easy and transparent assignment of traits to wearables developed by PC or third parties. It also allows transparent insight into the highest need wearables so that the community could hold high impact design competitions.\n\nSets and Godlike Sets\nA major critique of the Forge 1.0 wearable release was the introduction of a 4-piece godlike set and general “power creep” with new content releases. This was the second 4-piece godlike set and only allowed 3 out of 16 gotchi types access to a 4-piece godlike set. A major goal of this release was to provide all gotchi types access to “end game” with a 4-piece godlike set. Another major goal was to incorporate classic wearables and reduce power creep of newly released wearables as much as possible. To meet this goal, we propose the introduction of 4 new four-piece godlike sets composed of new and classic wearables.\n\nHere are the proposed 4 new four-piece Godlike Sets:\n  \n![image](ipfs://bafkreic5h2u3m7cps25fop62xbh7zwvwltotqsrxszl6ieyqw7k5dt2rzy)\n    \n\nAttached here is the spreadsheet that outlines the number of sets accessible to each of the 16 gotchi types: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VigrwRsUfTSl5sKMYD_Sy7dBDhpNCSu91hTK4mVA-VU/edit#gid=1816507981\n\nRegarding four-piece godlike sets, this snippet outlines current state and each type of gotchi afforded a new four-piece godlike set with each addition. For example, the addition of an NRG-,BRN+ godlike set allows 4 more gotchi types access to a four-piece godlike set. The four new sets address all 16 gotchi types:  \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidvny67hqvbv7o36ohzwl374yqrhp3hjbyt6mnomjrdvclw6atbwm)\n    \nThis release maximally fills gaps in the wearable market and provides all gotchi types access to a four-piece godlike set. It also provides a transparent path forward for new content which can be used by all parties building on the protocol. We are very excited about the art and can’t wait to share more with the community if this and the corresponding distribution proposal are accepted.\nThe Forge Team",

      "content": "Author:  dr.wagmi\nGotchi ID: 16635\nDiscussion: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1126256051528937624/1126256051528937624\n\nPlease note the author, gotchi, ID, and discussion are the same for this Geode proposal and the Forge 2.0 Schematic proposal. \n\n\nTakeaway points:\n-\tThe table below outlines the programmed odds for the multi-tier rarity geode\n-\tThe 14 Forge 2.0 Schematics will be distributed 60% through geodes and 40% by raffle\n-\tThis raffle will be the last non-drop ticket raffle paving the way for a transition to GLTR tickets\n\nGeodes:\nGeodes are currently only obtained by smelting wearables which means you can only get new content by smelting old content and burning alloy in the process. This allows for predictable distribution of new content over time. A well-stocked prize pool will transparently drip new content to the community and could be refilled at any time – refills could be new schematics or other prizes, content, partnership items (Anata NFTs), etc. MikeyJay designed the table below outlining odds for Multitier-Rarity Geodes. We plan to push this live in August alongside the Forge 2.0 New Schematic Release. Schematics can be minted and stored in the forge contract until the updated Geode contract is ready. \n\nSee Appendix A for details regarding geode odds and prize distribution:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1zFjdeOae-Pg8r2DHIGvJu7RGennHzZDtZ0lv8v142S8/edit\n \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreib4rbc7k55wcmge2ccr7sffndtniyofab573ijfgvlvdh2ef226xy)\n    \nForge 2.0 Schematic Distribution:\nWe propose that the 14 new wearable schematics be distributed 60% by multi-tier rarity geodes and 40% by traditional raffle using FRENS-purchased tickets. This recommendation comes after soliciting feedback from the community and Pixelcraft. It avoids a resource-intensive auction which comes with a risk of poor user experience. It uses up all remaining FRENS (unless users elect to wait for a drop ticket raffle) and sets an expectation for no further FRENS-based tiered raffles. It also allows for the fun, community-building event of a raffle and slow, drip distribution metered by protocol engagement through the Geode mechanic. Overall, we think the 60:40 distribution strategy threads the needle and respects all stakeholders. See below for the exact distribution strategy, rarity tiers, and slots of items:\n  \n![image](ipfs://bafybeignrpr3weqxdyass76srdemlhlpy2gglyjigv2kmeqs4ui6lb42z4)\n    \n\nFinal FRENS Tiered-Rarity Raffle\nThe Forge Team proposes this raffle be the last traditionally tiered FRENS raffle. This means that Common-Godlike tickets purchased by FRENS will not be used again. They could be converted to Drop Tickets for a final Drop Ticket raffle to be determined later by Pixelcraft or the DAO. This is a significant step toward removing FRENS as a liability on the DAO balance sheet. It paves the way for creation of a GLTR-based raffle system to be used in the future if deemed necessary by PC or the DAO.\n\nPlease see the complementary proposal on the Forge 2.0 Schematics release for details on the proposed schematics and methodology.\n\nThe Forge Team",

      "title": "Gotchi Crawler Demo Proposal",
      "content": "**Author:** Oliver Spoon\n**Gotchi ID:** Mescaline 2415\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**Forum and Discord Threads:**\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/gotchi-crawler-demo-litepaper-and-funding-request/6936\nhttps://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1133041966985257000\n**Litepaper:**\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1QFy8ko6TtrLZyF47Uwobc-MWTqn0mt6MuACzhppW_hs/edit?usp=sharing\n\nHello frens,\n\nIt is with great pleasure to bring forward to you today a proposal for the long-anticipated Gotchi Crawler! Slick and I have teamed up to bring to the community a demo for the game. \n\n![Sample Map.png](ipfs://bafybeibizxphbjmzvok6k5dof6j2ubbpqff42z2sjxl47r5vseul3753na)\n\n### What is Gotchi Crawler?\n\nGotchi Crawler is a single or multiplayer (up to three) roguelike dungeon crawler. Players must descend, gather treasure and fight off swarms of enemies along the way. On each floor multiple of ten there is a merchant floor where players may exit the mines, capturing their score. Or, they can choose to descend further. Take note, if they die or run out of time before exiting, their score will be zero!\nSimply put, the core gameplay loop is enter mines, descend, gather treasure, exit / die, skill up, descend further, repeat\nThe game is designed in such a way to facilitate solo play, however you are at great advantage to play as a team!\n\n### A Boon for Asset Holders\n\nOne of the core design principles is how to bring value back to the community? While creating a fun game is priority #1, we also want to build mechanisms that give fresh new utility to existing Aavegotchi assets. One thing we are really keen on is finding value for as many protocol assets as possible. These concepts are slated for the alpha release and beyond.\n\n### The Road Ahead\n\nThe game will launch in a series of stages: demo, alpha, beta, and the final game. The purpose of the demo is to establish the core gameplay loop. From the demo phase, we will have a better understanding of the scope for the full game and what it will require from the perspective of funding and additional team. We are confident in our abilities to deliver the demo as outlined below:\n\n\nTarget launch: Mid October, 2023\n1. Multiplayer:\n* 1-3 players\n* Client side prediction for lag-free games\n2. Levels:\n* Three types -battle, adventure, and puzzle\n* Randomly spawn destructible objects\n* Single biome, the underground forest\n3. Destructible objects - these can contain:\n* GLTR points (this is how high scores are tracked in the MVP),\n* Ladders which allow the team to progress to lower level,\n* Lil Essence which if captured adds essence to the essence timer\n4. Battle:\n* Health/AP bars for gotchis\n* In-game stats based on gotchi traits\n* Geode smasher & fireball weapons\n* Dash mechanic for gotchis\n* Enemies with health bars only (no mage creeps yet!)\n* Simple enemy AI (roaming with an aggro range trigger)\n5. Puzzles\n* Team-dependent pressure switches implemented into the levels\n* Special doors that can only be opened with switches that (usually) contain treasure\n6. Essence timer:\n* Shared timer for all team mates\n* Approximately 15 minutes of play\n* Capture “Lil Essence” to increase play time\n7. Scoring:\n* GLTR = points\n* One score per gotchi\n8.

These funds will be used to compensate users who have been affected by the 0vix exploit. The longer the process takes, the more uncertainty it brings for them. It is crucial to resolve this so that 0VIX can reopen the markets and distribute the shares to the users in question.

      "title": "Forge 2.0 New Schematics, Methodology, and Godlike Sets",
      "content": "Takeaway Points:\n-\tWe propose 14 new schematics designed by the Forge Team\n-\tMikeyJay’s methodology was used for trait/set selection and should guide any future releases\n-\tWe propose 4 new four-piece godlike sets to give all 16 gotchi types access to such a set\n-\tNew godlikes maximally incorporate “old/classic” wearables\n\nNew Schematics\nThe Forge Team has been working diligently on standardizing and improving the process of new content releases. Intermittent wearable releases have been a staple of engagement for our community and comprise the majority of protocol engagement thus far. New content release comes with extensive backend work, however, especially as the Pixelcraft team transitions all assets to 3D in light of the rebranding and Gotchi Guardians. To this end, it’s imperative that trait and set selection be deliberate and equitable to all gotchi types. This will maximize the available wearables per gotchi, satisfy unmet demand, balance rarity farming, and provide a more balanced collection of assets on which 3rd party games can be built.\n\nHere are the proposed new wearables with rarity tier, slot, and specific trait modification:\n  \n![image](ipfs://bafybeib3vvab2ynrel5vvgyogua3kh4izh4tuudk7cnausxthmtaxof6pi)\n    \n\nSpecial Notes for this release:\n-\t“Best choice” is defined by highest impact on standard deviation impact for slot/rarity for each wearable. In simpler terms, the best choice is the one that fills the most trait gaps.\n-\tBest choice was chosen for all wearables with a single exception of Godlike Hands:\no\tThe Godlike Hands item was the best choice that provided a path to balance four-piece godlike sets which needed NRG-, BRN- specifically.\n-\tSpecific slot selection accounted for unmatched cores from the Forge 1.0 sale \n\nMikeyJay’s methodology is outlined in this intensive 13 page document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D9e2FEh5NnYXrPEK28UF7GWpsI1ybOsCY94x1kGCpJs/edit\n\nSpecific trait selections by rarity tier and slot are outlined in this spreadsheet:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y8geMG-uI7yZMn3khWnTzwOLD7_r6kRQawU9kqeMGGg/edit#gid=562462486\n\nThe data set can be updated in the future and serve as a community-facing guideline for new wearable releases. This will allow easy and transparent assignment of traits to wearables developed by PC or third parties. It also allows transparent insight into the highest need wearables so that the community could hold high impact design competitions.\n\nSets and Godlike Sets\nA major critique of the Forge 1.0 wearable release was the introduction of a 4-piece godlike set and general “power creep” with new content releases. This was the second 4-piece godlike set and only allowed 3 out of 16 gotchi types access to a 4-piece godlike set. A major goal of this release was to provide all gotchi types access to “end game” with a 4-piece godlike set. Another major goal was to incorporate classic wearables and reduce power creep of newly released wearables as much as possible. To meet this goal, we propose the introduction of 4 new four-piece godlike sets composed of new and classic wearables.\n\nHere are the proposed 4 new four-piece Godlike Sets:\n  \n![image](ipfs://bafkreic5h2u3m7cps25fop62xbh7zwvwltotqsrxszl6ieyqw7k5dt2rzy)\n    \n\nAttached here is the spreadsheet that outlines the number of sets accessible to each of the 16 gotchi types: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VigrwRsUfTSl5sKMYD_Sy7dBDhpNCSu91hTK4mVA-VU/edit#gid=1816507981\n\nRegarding four-piece godlike sets, this snippet outlines current state and each type of gotchi afforded a new four-piece godlike set with each addition. For example, the addition of an NRG-,BRN+ godlike set allows 4 more gotchi types access to a four-piece godlike set. The four new sets address all 16 gotchi types:  \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidvny67hqvbv7o36ohzwl374yqrhp3hjbyt6mnomjrdvclw6atbwm)\n    \nThis release maximally fills gaps in the wearable market and provides all gotchi types access to a four-piece godlike set. It also provides a transparent path forward for new content which can be used by all parties building on the protocol. We are very excited about the art and can’t wait to share more with the community if this and the corresponding distribution proposal are accepted.\nThe Forge Team",

      "content": "Author:  dr.wagmi\nGotchi ID: 16635\nDiscussion: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1126256051528937624/1126256051528937624\n\nPlease note the author, gotchi, ID, and discussion are the same for this Geode proposal and the Forge 2.0 Schematic proposal. \n\n\nTakeaway points:\n-\tThe table below outlines the programmed odds for the multi-tier rarity geode\n-\tThe 14 Forge 2.0 Schematics will be distributed 60% through geodes and 40% by raffle\n-\tThis raffle will be the last non-drop ticket raffle paving the way for a transition to GLTR tickets\n\nGeodes:\nGeodes are currently only obtained by smelting wearables which means you can only get new content by smelting old content and burning alloy in the process. This allows for predictable distribution of new content over time. A well-stocked prize pool will transparently drip new content to the community and could be refilled at any time – refills could be new schematics or other prizes, content, partnership items (Anata NFTs), etc. MikeyJay designed the table below outlining odds for Multitier-Rarity Geodes. We plan to push this live in August alongside the Forge 2.0 New Schematic Release. Schematics can be minted and stored in the forge contract until the updated Geode contract is ready. \n\nSee Appendix A for details regarding geode odds and prize distribution:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1zFjdeOae-Pg8r2DHIGvJu7RGennHzZDtZ0lv8v142S8/edit\n \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreib4rbc7k55wcmge2ccr7sffndtniyofab573ijfgvlvdh2ef226xy)\n    \nForge 2.0 Schematic Distribution:\nWe propose that the 14 new wearable schematics be distributed 60% by multi-tier rarity geodes and 40% by traditional raffle using FRENS-purchased tickets. This recommendation comes after soliciting feedback from the community and Pixelcraft. It avoids a resource-intensive auction which comes with a risk of poor user experience. It uses up all remaining FRENS (unless users elect to wait for a drop ticket raffle) and sets an expectation for no further FRENS-based tiered raffles. It also allows for the fun, community-building event of a raffle and slow, drip distribution metered by protocol engagement through the Geode mechanic. Overall, we think the 60:40 distribution strategy threads the needle and respects all stakeholders. See below for the exact distribution strategy, rarity tiers, and slots of items:\n  \n![image](ipfs://bafybeignrpr3weqxdyass76srdemlhlpy2gglyjigv2kmeqs4ui6lb42z4)\n    \n\nFinal FRENS Tiered-Rarity Raffle\nThe Forge Team proposes this raffle be the last traditionally tiered FRENS raffle. This means that Common-Godlike tickets purchased by FRENS will not be used again. They could be converted to Drop Tickets for a final Drop Ticket raffle to be determined later by Pixelcraft or the DAO. This is a significant step toward removing FRENS as a liability on the DAO balance sheet. It paves the way for creation of a GLTR-based raffle system to be used in the future if deemed necessary by PC or the DAO.\n\nPlease see the complementary proposal on the Forge 2.0 Schematics release for details on the proposed schematics and methodology.\n\nThe Forge Team",

These funds will be used to compensate users who have been affected by the 0vix exploit. The longer the process takes, the more uncertainty it brings for them. It is crucial to resolve this so that 0VIX can reopen the markets and distribute the shares to the users in question.

This method is preferable due to its ability to reduce a substantial price pressure that could result from a sell order of this magnitude.\n\n## Objectives:\n\nIn essence the goal is to secure a fair OTC deal that meets the needs and expectations of all stakeholders involved. Aavegotchi DAO’s goal is to mitigate the sell pressure on the GHST token while concurrently ensuring the rightful owners of the funds receive their funds\n0VIX users want to have a fair price and get the maximum value from funds recuperated\n\nTo circumvent market volatilities, the OTC price will be defined by averaging Chainlink prices over the time period that this CoreProp is voted on.\n\nTo derive the price of the GHST / DAI pair from Chainlink, the block-per-block price feeds on Polygon PoS will be used. The final OTC price for swapping GHST into DAI will be determined as the simple average of all the GHST/DAI pair prices derived at each block (~300k distinct values).\n\nUpon passing of the CoreProp vote, a csv file and simple script will be submitted to the Aavegotchi DAO with the final OTC price value for everyone to verify publicly.\nScript link: https://gist.github.com/pestopoppa/28630e7a6ae0215e071de7decf678e6a\n\n\n### Option A:\n\nYes to the OTC deal at a fixed price.\nThat option offers the key advantage of price certainty and stability for both Aavegotchi DAO and 0VIX users. It circumvents market volatility by averaging prices over the days that the CoreProp is voted on, thus providing a quick execution route for the transaction.\n\n### Option B:\n\nThis CoreProp has been discussed extensively over the past days and weeks. If there are questions please refer to the 0VIX discussion sub-channel on the AV DAO discord.\n\nIf the community feels it requires even further discussion, then please vote for this option.\nOptions:\n\nOption A: OTC deal at a fixed price\nOption B: Further Discussion needed\n\nThe returning of funds will be voted on separately and should appear on Snapshot after review by the community.\nAs it stands now the multi-sig co-signers would be Hamzah Khan, Head of DeFi at Polygon Labs and Benjamin.lens, core-contributor at QiDAO.",

      "content": "Author: Immaterial#0001  \nGotchiID: #16559\n\nHello frens, \n\nThis sigprop is to obtain funding for the development of Gotchi Battler. I've assembled a team of some of the best builders in the community and we're excited to get started and build what is hopefully a prize asset for the DAO and community for years to come. Please read on to get an overview of the game, costs and deliverables and if you want a deeper dive into the game including a trailer please visit the forum post: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/gotchi-battler/4772 \n\nThank you for your support, as always!\n\n\n**What is Gotchi battler?**\n\nGotchi Battler is an auto battler game where 2 teams of 5 gotchis battle each other until 1 team is wiped out. Each Gotchis stats and special move will be determined by its traits. To set up a good team you’ll have to strategise what types of Gotchis mix well together and what formation the team should be in. Once you’ve set up the team you can sit back and watch your strategy play out in an epic Gotchi battle to the death!\n\n**Why Gotchi Battler?**\n\nI created a long post detailing the motivation behind building Gotchi Battler here: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/gotchi-battler/4772/21?u=immaterial\nSo please go read that post but the TLDR headlines are:\n\n - Gamify Protocol Rewards\n - Increase demand for protocol assets\n - Strengthen the game lineup for Gotchichain\n - DAO revenue generation through future PvE expansions\n\n**Cost breakdowns**\n\nName: Immaterial (gotchiboard.com)\nRole: Ideation, Prototype, Specs, Management, Backend/Frontend dev, Infrastructure.\nMonthly cost: $8k\nMonths of work: 7 (Feb-September)\nTotal cost: $56k\n\n  \n\nCoinmandeer (gotchiboard.com)\nRole: Designer\nMonthly cost: $8k\nMonths of work: 1\nTotal cost: $8k\n\n  \n\nWildfyr\nRole: Battle Mechanics Consultant\nMonthly cost: $4k\nMonths of work: 1\nTotal cost: $4k\n\n  \n\nMaxicrouton\nRole: Backend specs, ½ Backend API, Smart contracts\nMonthly cost: $8k\nMonths of work: 3.5 (June-August + ½ September)\nTotal cost: $28k\n\n  \n\nEitri (aadventure.io)\nRole: Frontend Development\nMonthly cost: $8k\nMonths of work: 2.5 (July-August + ½ September)\nTotal cost: $20k\n\n  \n\nUnity Developer (anon)\nRole: Unity development\nMonthly cost: $8k\nMonths of work: 2.5 (July-August + ½ September)\nTotal cost: $20k\n\nBounties: $10k\nTotal cost: $146k\n\n**DAO payout schedule and deliverables:**\n\n***14th of July***\nAmount: 45k DAI \nAddress: 0x10B989914A478Ed7DE2d2C4CC4e835bbd3de229b\nDescription: For designs, battle mechanics and upfront 1/2 payment for devs\nDeliverables:\n - Web app designs \n - Battle mechanics V2 document\n\n\n***1st of September***\nAmount: 45k DAI\nAddress: 0x10B989914A478Ed7DE2d2C4CC4e835bbd3de229b\nDescription: 2nd 1/2 payment for devs on completion of beta and funds for bounties\nDeliverables:\n - Public beta version of the game\n - Bug bounty program\n\n  \n\n***1st of October***\nAmount: 56k DAI\nAddress: 0x10B989914A478Ed7DE2d2C4CC4e835bbd3de229b\nDescription: Immaterial's payment on completion of the project\nDeliverables\n - Full general release of the game",

      "title": "Gotchiverse Environment in Music Parkour",
      "content": "**Author**: CryptoGotchi\n**GotchiIDs**: 8612\n\n \n![Header1.jpg](ipfs://bafybeiaff2czrcnr76wsbkqlk7n7qbunyytffzr3dxkcknyvrqfqw2ev3i)\n    \n\n## **Introduction**\nIn Music Parkour, players navigate through obstacles courses, overcome hurdles, and strike down objects to the rhythm of the beat.\n\nFor some time now, we've hosted various Aavegotchi themed giveaways. I'm Music Parkour's lead developer and have also been a GotchiGang member since H1.\n\nMusic Parkour has been over two years in the making, with many ups and downs, and a lot of lessons learned along the way. Almost all the assets have been custom made by professionals, including the first songs we'll be releasing with the game. You can find two alpha gameplay teasers on our website: https://mupa.io/\n\nThese teasers are set in the \"Grassland\" Environment. What sets Music Parkour apart is that Environments are not tied to a specific parkour (level) or song. Any parkour can be played in any unlocked Environment. This provides players with the freedom to customize their gaming experience and explore different landscapes while enjoying their favorite songs and parkours.\n\nAccess to these Environments is enabled by Environment NFTs. An Environment NFT is a digital asset, stored on the blockchain, that represents ownership of a particular virtual setting in the game. They are tradable assets which can be bought, sold, and owned independently of the game itself. This means that as the game grows and evolves, the value and demand for these Environment NFTs may change, potentially offering an exciting opportunity for players and collectors alike. Ownership of an Environment NFT, unlocks that Environment in the game, allowing owners to experience parkours in that setting. Of course, not every Environment has to be token gated. The Grassland Environment for example is the default environment that does not need to be unlocked.\n\nYou can find out more about Music Parkour's ecosystem in our litepaper:\nhttps://liscintec.github.io/MusicParkourLitepaper/\n\nYou are also very welcome to join our freshly minted Discord and share your thoughts about the game and the litepaper. We're still looking for feedback, it's not cast in stone yet:\nhttps://discord.com/invite/wkgaHzRyRM\n\nThe game is written in C# using Unity DOTS / ECS.\n\n\n## **Proposal** (Summary / Goal)\n\nIn this proposal, I'd like to apply for funding from the Aavegotchi DAO to create a Gotchiverse themed Environment for Music Parkour. Environments can be thought of as reskins of the entire game, except that not only the skin (as in texture) changes, but so do most of the models. Here is an example of a Cave Environment (wip):\n![CaveEnv.jpg](ipfs://bafybeib3arcvl5kcmvbfobmahssbezp3jc63fz7hkthpivnwvlvqvoxgj4)\n    \n\nWe propose a collaboration between Music Parkour and Aavegotchi DAO to create a Gotchiverse Environment within Music Parkour. This immersive virtual landscape will reflect the unique design elements and thematic aesthetics of the Gotchiverse, offering a possibility for both communities to interact and engage with.\n\nThe creation of the Gotchiverse Environment will provide additional avenues for entertainment and rewards for both our player bases. This new environment will cost approximately 28k USD to develop, implement, test, and maintain, and we are asking Aavegotchi DAO for the funding to make this happen.\n\nRegarding licensing the necessary Gotchiverse rights from PC, I already talked with Jesse.\n\n\n## **How does Aavegotchi DAO benefit?** (Effect)\n\nBesides being able to play Music Parkour in an immersive Gotchiverse-themed setting, here is what we offer Aavegotchi DAO in return:\n\n1. **Exclusive control over distribution of the Gotchiverse Environment**: The Aavegotchi DAO get's to decide if the Gotchiverse Environment will be one of the default (free / non-NFT) Environments, or if the Environment will be purchasable as an NFT. In case of the latter, it also gets to decide if the offer should be limited or unlimited, as well as set a price. If Aavegotchi DAO decides to sell the Gotchiverse Environment as NFTs (limited or unlimited), they will receive all the proceeds, except for a yet-to-be-determined percentage that should go to Pixelcraft for licensing the IP.\n\n2. **100x Game Licenses**. Game Licenses unlock the main game. We plan to use a freemium model in which users get to try 1 song for free. A Game License NFT unlocks the rest of the songs and parkours that are provided by us (not the user generated content though), as well as the ability to make your own levels.\n\n3. **32x Ring NFTs**. Rings are the main NFT in Music Parkour. Rings allow players to earn tokens. For more information, see the litepaper linked above. We are contemplating to let Ring owners earn tokens, even without playing the game, to attract a wider range of users (including users without VR gear). Aavegotchi DAO could distribute the Rings as prices for (mini)games or events.\n\n4. **Sponsoring of the first Gotchivision Song Contest**. There are some talented musicians among GotchiGang. We'd like to sponsor a contest, where all of GotchiGang can submit songs they made and the 3 highest rated songs will win a UREEQA \"Package of Proof\" Validation for their song (or whichever service provider we'll end up working with). We're hoping to work with UREEQA to enable musicians to license their music to the Music Parkour project in a seamless and trustless manner.\n\nWe are also happy to share any of the related 3D assets (that do not require licensing) with the rest of the Aavegotchi community for other devs to use.\n\n\n## **Cost breakdown**\n\n***Conceptualization*** 1.200 USD\nConceptualizing the Environment so that it is unique in it's Gotchiverse aesthetics, while still compatible with all other environments, so that our premise that every parkour can be played in every Environment remains to hold true.\n\n***Graphic Assets*** 10.928,96 USD\nThis includes, style finding, ground textures, pillar, castle system, giant root arch, various stones and boulders, beat object, mine, pit, lanterns, button, rune stone, bridge system, rope, palm trees, pylon, various other Gotchiverse objects for decoration, beams, 1x rigged Aavegotchi, 4 animations, 7 wearables.\n\n***Development work*** 6.800 USD\nIntegration and coding.\n\n***Testing and QA*** 5.600 USD\nMaking sure everything works correctly, fixing bugs, etc.\n\n***Maintenance*** 3.400 USD\nWe not only plan to add various other Environments to the game, but also add additional obstacles, and other functionality to the game as we go. To retain value of any and all Environment NFTs, this requires updating all Environments whenever we introduce a new obstacle or function.\n\n**Total:** 27.928,96 USD\n\nWe propose the following payout structure:\n\n**1.** 1-2 weeks after the core proposal concluded:\n9,309.65 DAI to 0xda0B0bCF6E405d71156F974ce895d33702f2F94B\n\n**2.** 1-2 weeks after half of the Graphic Assets are done (we'll regularly share screenshots to keep Aavegotchi DAO up to date):\n9,309.65 DAI to 0xda0B0bCF6E405d71156F974ce895d33702f2F94B\n\n**3.** 1-2 weeks after the Environment is complete:\n9,309.66 DAI to 0xda0B0bCF6E405d71156F974ce895d33702f2F94B\n\n\n## **Risks**\nVR Blockchain games are still a small niche, and the Music Parkour community is still small as well. While we're working hard to make Music Parkour a success, there is still some residual risk that our community might not grow as fast as we'd like, especially given the market conditions.\n\n\n## **Alternative Paths**\n\nNo Gotchiverse Environment in Music Parkour.\n\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nWe hope Aavegotchi DAO will favorably consider this proposal and look forward to the possibility of working together.👻💖🎵",

      "content": "Author: Immaterial#0001  \nGotchiID: #16559\n\nHello frens, \n\nThis sigprop is to obtain funding for the development of Gotchi Battler. I've assembled a team of some of the best builders in the community and we're excited to get started and build what is hopefully a prize asset for the DAO and community for years to come. Please read on to get an overview of the game, costs and deliverables and if you want a deeper dive into the game including a trailer please visit the forum post: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/gotchi-battler/4772 \n\nThank you for your support, as always!\n\n**What is Gotchi battler?**\n\nGotchi Battler is an auto battler game where 2 teams of 5 gotchis battle each other until 1 team is wiped out. Each Gotchis stats and special move will be determined by its traits. To set up a good team you’ll have to strategise what types of Gotchis mix well together and what formation the team should be in. Once you’ve set up the team you can sit back and watch your strategy play out in an epic Gotchi battle to the death!\n\n**Why Gotchi Battler?**\n\nI created a long post detailing the motivation behind building Gotchi Battler here: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/gotchi-battler/4772/21?u=immaterial\nSo please go read that post but the TLDR headlines are:\n\n - Gamify Protocol Rewards\n - Increase demand for protocol assets\n - Strengthen the game lineup for Gotchichain\n - DAO revenue generation through future PvE expansions\n\n**Cost breakdowns**\n\nName: Immaterial (gotchiboard.com)\nRole: Ideation, Prototype, Specs, Management, Backend/Frontend dev, Infrastructure.\nMonthly cost: $8k\nMonths of work: 7 (Feb-September)\nTotal cost: $56k\n\n  \n\nCoinmandeer (gotchiboard.com)\nRole: Designer\nMonthly cost: $8k\nMonths of work: 1\nTotal cost: $8k\n\n  \n\nWildfyr\nRole: Battle Mechanics Consultant\nMonthly cost: $4k\nMonths of work: 1\nTotal cost: $4k\n\n  \n\nMaxicrouton\nRole: Backend specs, ½ Backend API, Smart contracts\nMonthly cost: $8k\nMonths of work: 3.5 (June-August + ½ September)\nTotal cost: $28k\n\n  \n\nEitri (aadventure.io)\nRole: Frontend Development\nMonthly cost: $8k\nMonths of work: 2.5 (July-August + ½ September)\nTotal cost: $20k\n\n  \n\nUnity Developer (anon)\nRole: Unity development\nMonthly cost: $8k\nMonths of work: 2.5 (July-August + ½ September)\nTotal cost: $20k\n\nBounties: $10k\nTotal cost: $146k\n\n**DAO payout schedule and deliverables:**\n\n***1st of July***\nAmount: 45k DAI \nAddress: 0x10B989914A478Ed7DE2d2C4CC4e835bbd3de229b\nDescription: For designs, battle mechanics and upfront 1/2 payment for devs\nDeliverables:\n - Web app designs \n - Battle mechanics V2 document\n\n\n***1st of September***\nAmount: 45k DAI\nAddress: 0x10B989914A478Ed7DE2d2C4CC4e835bbd3de229b\nDescription: 2nd 1/2 payment for devs on completion of beta and funds for bounties\nDeliverables:\n - Public beta version of the game\n - Bug bounty program\n\n  \n\n***1st of October***\nAmount: 56k DAI\nAddress: 0x10B989914A478Ed7DE2d2C4CC4e835bbd3de229b\nDescription: Immaterial's payment on completion of the project\nDeliverables\n - Full general release of the game",

      "title": "How to return the GHST from the 0VIX exploit that was transferred to the Aavegotchi DAO Treasury to 0VIX users",
      "content": "Authors: 0VIX Protocol\nGotchiIDs: 22864 (@Maxicrouton)\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\nDiscord Thread: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1106249657425862827\n\n\n# Proposal\nThe purpose of this proposal is to vote on returning the GHST that GotchiVault transferred to the Aavegotchi DAO Treasury in one of the following ways:\n\n\n\n* Send the GHST to the 0VIX multi-sig\n* Send the GHST to a new multi-sig with Aavegotchi, 0VIX & neutral 3rd party\n* Recapitalize markets directly according to [[OIP21]](https://vote.0vix.com/#/proposal/0x7f8f6ce23115e8a009327b9010caf7e6b809617691281f05ee0afc874143b8c3)\n\n\n## **Introduction:**\n\nThis proposal’s primary objective is the recovery of funds that were illegitimately obtained through the exploit on the 0VIX Protocol. Part of those assets were transferred to the GotchiVault, which in turn passed on the funds to the AavegotchiDAO. \n\nIn Summary, 763,624 GHST tokens are held by the Aavegotchi Treasury, leaving the rightful owners without access to their assets. The 0VIX Protocol Association is in discussions with the community to proceed with the distribution of recovered funds back to the respective markets and their rightful owners. \n\n\n## **Objectives:**\n\nThere are 2 main open items that need to be resolved:\n\n\n\n1. Destination of funds\n2. OTC-Deal terms (to be decided in follow-up proposal)\n\nThis proposal is about finding a trusted and secure location for the funds that ensures maximum benefit for the affected 0vix users in a way that satisfies the Aavegotchi DAO. \n\nThe following options are proposed on sending the funds to custody until the 0VIX DAO agrees on the distribution of recuperated GHST:\n\n#### Option A:  Directly transfer the funds to the 0VIX multisignature wallet.\n\n\n\n* KYC of involved parties\n* Address: **0x7b2b0cBaDC25953A64D77B4785848b48B45E1017** (Multisig - PoS)\n\n#### Option B: Establish a new multisignature wallet with representatives drawn from three separate entities\n\n\n\n* 1 from the 0VIX team, \n* 1 individual from the Polygon team (likely Hamzah Khan, Head of DeFi @ Polygon)\n* 1 individual from the QiDAO team (likely Benjamin.lens) \\\n\n\n#### Option C: Aavegotchi takes responsibility of recapitalizing the markets directly\n\n* Swap into each of the markets tokens avoid ding tot the liquidity distribution at OIP21\n* Transfer tokens directly to the markets by being themselves responsible for each transaction needed for this.\n\n\n\n## **Next steps:**\n\nThe 0VIX Protocol aims to allocate the recuperated liquidity in a manner that promotes fairness, accessibility, and the long-term sustainability of the affected markets. In [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/933368396299530310/933368396299530313/1110959116022722732) there was the call for comments on how we should distribute the recuperated funds. After getting feedback from the community the proposal was simplified, and in OIP 21 the community is voting on whether GHST funds from AAVEGOTCHI DAO should be distributed directly to affected markets proportionally to their net liquidity drained.\n\n[OIP21 Snapshot vote ](https://vote.0vix.com/#/proposal/0x7f8f6ce23115e8a009327b9010caf7e6b809617691281f05ee0afc874143b8c3)\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreia73qr35o2mxe4w3flydmuawlqseuhnmae7y54teoyr2uxijxripy)\n    \n\nThe absolute amounts of each market’s recapitalization proceeds will ultimately be determined by the value of GHST/the terms of the OTC deal. Assuming the OTC deal goes through and the 0VIX multi-sig gets DAI in return. The DAI would then be swapped according to the liquidity distribution that the voted option suggests. \n\n# Background\n\n\n## **OTC Deal (not part of this proposal)**\n\nIn essence, our goal is to secure a fair OTC deal as preliminarily discussed with some of the AAVEGOTCHI DAO team members, that meets the needs and expectations of all stakeholders involved\n\n\n\n* Aavegotchi DAO’s goal is to mitigate the sell pressure on the GHST token while concurrently ensuring the rightful owners of the funds receive their due\n* 0VIX users want to have a fair price and get the maximum value from funds recuperated\n\n\n## **0VIX DAO vote system**\n\nPre-exploit, 0VIX governance was kept on [https://community.0vix.com/](https://community.0vix.com/) and the platform was in public beta preparing for a token launch.\n\nPost-exploit, 0VIX DAO moved to a preVIX voting system to further ensure fairness and prevent bots and misuse. PreVIX is the de-facto pre-mine token that was accumulated by participating in a liquidity mining campaign, therefore it can be seen as a proof-of-liquidity where no individual address has a benefit over others. 0VIX governance will from now on be held on [https://snapshot.org/#/0vix-protocol.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/0vix-protocol.eth)\n\n\n## **The exploit:**\n\nYou can find more info in the [post-mortem](https://0vixprotocol.medium.com/0vix-exploit-post-mortem-15c882dcf479) of the attack: \n\n\nThe total extracted value post-exploit amounts to a net total of $4.33 million, paid out of 0VIX’s user funds. Of these, 1.4M GHST excess tokens remained with the GotchiVault where they were used to process further withdrawals by users selling into the price increase until the vault was finally halted and 978K GHST tokens are in the process of being returned to 0VIX by the Aavegotchi DAO and GotchiVault DAO.\n\nReturning the funds follows established protocols in the DeFi ecosystem for managing such situations. Recalling the Yearn incident, they successfully recovered $9.42 million that a Cream attacker had deposited into the yUSD vault as part of an attack. These retrieved funds were [returned to Cream.](https://twitter.com/yearnfi/status/1453681370698502148)",

It also affords more confident participation in the alchemica spending competitions which have been very successful to date. \n\nHistorical Survey Dates: \nSurvey #1 (Initial Farm release): 7/20/2022 (25% of alchemica in act 1) \nSurvey #2: 3/3/2023 \n\nProposed Survey rolls (estimate based on Pixelcraft Shipping Fridays): 8.33% each: \nSurvey #3: 6/16/2023 \nSurvey #4: 9/8/2023 \nSurvey #5: 12/1/2023 \nSurvey #6: 2/24/2024 \nSurvey #7: 5/18/2024 \nSurvey #8: 8/10/2024 \nSurvey #9: 11/2/2024 (final survey of Act 1) \n\nReferences: Aavegotchi Medium Alchemica Report: https://aavegotchi.medium.com/top-secret-gotchus-alchemica-tokenomics-report-fc588cda9896 \nAavegotchi Bible Chapter 2 Alchemica Tokenomics: https://blog.aavegotchi.com/the-gotchiverse-game-bible-chapter-2/\n\n\nThanks\nDr Wagmi",

      "content": "Introduction\n\nDaoLens DAO Manager is an all-in-one platform for all DAO activity. The DAO Lens platform is a browser-enabled experience bundling Snapshot, Discourse, Discord, and other governance/education activity into one clean UI.\n\nIn addition to being a governance/discussion hub, the DAO Manager is enabled by a GPT-4 powered AI framework specifically trained on DAO functions for Aavegotchi DAO.\n\nDaoLens' DAO Manager aims to leverage Robin AI to assist in governance discussions and proposal development. In addition, the platform allows aggregation of all DAO discourse. Aavegotchi DAO will work alongside DAO Lens as partners who will optimize the platform for our DAO.\n\nThis proposal outlines a three-month trial of the DAO Lens product with the following deliverables:\n\nCustom Development of the following:\n\n- Robin AI for Proposal Management (Gpt-4 powered AI)\n- Train Robin-AI (running GPT-4) for Aavegotchi DAO-specific functions/prompts and other immutable datasets\n- Ability to award Aavegotchi XP On-Chain\n- Data Migration from Discord forums to the DAO lens platform\n- Conduct meetings twice a week (preferably, one public and one with core contributors) as a regular cadence for the key updates.\n- Beta test new Dao Lens features together with a tester group from Aavegotchi DAO\n- Optimize the onboarding process with guides and meetings\n- Assign members to specific tasks\n- Collaborate on joint marketing efforts with Aavegotchi DAO through Twitter Spaces, Discord Spaces, etc.\n- Deliver custom requirements within four weeks after core prop passing\n\nBudget\n\nDaoLens DAO Manager: A one-time fee of 2000 USDC (discounted 80% under the Partner program) and monthly subscription fee of 199 USDC for three months.\n\nTotal Budget: 2,597 USDC\n\nConclusion\nAavegotchi DaoLens DAO Manager aims to harness the power of community and AI technology to create a more efficient, open, and inclusive decision-making process, ultimately fostering more growth and innovation within the DAO.\n\nTreasury Details:\nPayment to be made in USDC/DAI within 48 hours of core proposal passing. Payment should be made to the specified DAO Lens wallet.",

      "content": "Author: Hefe#1514\nGotchi ID: #3833\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\n\nIn the spirit of progress and effective collaboration, I am presenting this subsequent funding request to ensure the continuity of Aavegotchi DAO meeting planning & execution for the months of April through July.\n\nThe objectives remain steadfast:\n\n- Facilitate Sunday DAO meetings or other designated DAO gatherings to appraise active and funded projects, active bounties, and more\n- Provide an impartial platform for balanced and diverse dialogues\n- Organize and discuss project deliberations\n- Testing and implementation of DAO tooling (DAO Lens)\n- Offer support in the preparation of DAO proposals, offering critical feedback\n- Live stream to the official Aavegotchi DAO YouTube channel\n\nIn line with continuous efforts, notable goals include:\n\n- Curating a dynamic team of 3-5 DAO hosts from our active community members. These participants will then be eligible for rewards via ThriveCoin's Thank Aavegotchi initiative in season 2\n\n- Implementing DAO Lens: A groundbreaking AI-enabled DAO Hub that integrates all Discourse, Discord, Snapshot, and event activity into one user-friendly interface. DAO Lens promises to revolutionize our dialogue and governance process\n\n- Following the successful completion of this funding request and associated deliverables (Option 1), my intention is to effectively distribute my individual role across various proficient DAO contributors.\n\nFunding Request:\n\nOption 1:\n\n- A total of 6800 USDC for 4 months (April, May, June, July)\nIncludes the implementation of DAO Lens, integrated Thrive task rewards, and training of 3-5 certified DAO hosts\n- Hosts stepping in for meetings during this timeframe will be compensated from this allotment.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- A total of 3400 USDC for the months of April and May (delivered upon proposal acceptance)\n- In this scenario, I would relinquish my position at the end of May, and I would defer to the DAO and Thrive Advisory Board for arrangements to cover the tasks associated with the role.\n\n\nTreasury Details:\nFull payment to the specified wallet within 48 hours of Core Proposal approval, either in DAI or USDC.\n\nTLDR; This proposal underlines commitment to continuity, community engagement, and effective governance within the Aavegotchi DAO. By granting this funding request, we would ensure the successful implementation of DAO Lens, promote dynamic hosting, and set the stage for decentralized participation in the DAO's activities.\n\nThank you for considering this proposal. Your continued support and active participation are instrumental in our collective endeavor to shape a robust and inclusive Aavegotchi DAO.",

      "content": "Authors: Bearded | GotchiVault.com#0001\nGotchiIDs: 13536\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\nXP Reward: 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/next-season-of-rarity-farming/4778\n\n\nHi all,\n\nI am proposing that we start rarity farming season 6 on June 1 (if deemed feasible by PC, or ASAP after that in consultation with PC).\n\nWhile there was significant discussion in the DAO forum and on recent DAO calls about potential changes, no details were finalized and discussion stalled out.  While it feels like the last season ended only recently, the last season started on 2/1/23 and ended on 3/28/23. We’ve been aiming for ~3 rarity farming seasons a year, which would put us at a June 1 start date.  This proposal suggests keeping reward parameters the same as the prior several seasons and deferring any significant changes until Season 7 towards the end of the year.   Last season used the following reward parameters:\n\n4 Rounds (2 weeks each) 1.5 Million GHST Rewards Pool - to be funded by the DAO Treasury\n\n70% BRS\n\n20% Kinship\n\n10% XP\n\nTop 7.5k Gotchis (30%)\n\nLaunch period: Season 6 round 1 to commence on June 1, or as soon as deemed feasible by PC\n\nThank you as always for your consideration and your votes!",

      "content": "**Author:** @thrivegiraffe\n**GotchiID:** #23926\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:**  20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Links to Discourse:** \nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/thank-aavegotchi-proposal-scalable-automated-on-chain-rewards-for-valuable-aavegotchi-dao-contributions/4763\n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1084501947647795220\n\nThriveCoin support: Daniel (@thrivegiraffe), Senad (@senad.eth), Joe (@Above_Average_Joe), and Robert (@shepherd)\nAavegotchi proposal co-creation support: @stedari, @Thrax, @diddlypoo. @Mycaleum, @0xZFi, @Hefe, @zimteemo and many dozens of people who have been on our weekly Discord calls in the Aavegotchi server for over a month. → Thank you!\n\n## Summary:\nAavegotchi DAO members provide extraordinary support to the DAO. They could provide even more - and better - support if they are thanked for their valuable DAO contributions with $GHST and an on-chain thank you note!\n\nWe propose a 3-month Thank Aavegotchi pilot to thank (reward and recognize) valuable contributions to Aavegotchi DAO with $GHST + an on-chain thank you note. We’ll do it in a way that is automated, scalable, on-chain, and protects against bots and bad actors.\n\nThe impact of rewarding Aavegotchi DAO members for your value-creating contributions should be greater efficiency, utility, and value for Aavegotchi DAO as well as more shared ownership in our community.\n\nDuring pilot, we will test 3 different rewards formats in 3 1-month “seasons”:\n\nSeason 1: 15k total $GHST raffled to 30 winners. Each contribution you make to the DAO earns you “raffle tickets”. \n\nSeason 2: 15k total $GHST rewarding each valuable contribution you make. \n\nSeason 3: 15k total $GHST rewarding you in rarity-farming style. \n\nAt the culmination of the third month, the community will vote on which rewards format you prefer. If a follow-up proposal passes to continue our pilot for an additional 3 months, rewards for the second pilot will be in the winning format. \n  \n![ApeCoin_-_Card_01.png](ipfs://bafkreif2w53zavvdquibgnvizqv4hdkubge6r4smeqhjnkt3govpfa3gty)\n\n## Rationale:\nWe are deeply aligned with Aavegotchi’s work to enable true asset ownership for gamers at the protocol level. The excitement of this work is palpable in every community event and call we’ve been a part of since the beginning.\n\nTo continue pushing this work forward, we must incentivize valuable contributions across our DAO in a way that is automated, scalable, on-chain (transparent), and protects against bots and bad actors.\n\nWhile Thank Aavegotchi can automate limitless valuable DAO activity, we propose to start by focusing on rewarding metaverse and governance activities most valued by the Aavegotchi DAO community - which we’ve served in weekly Aavegotchi DAO & ThriveCoin Discord conversations.\n\nSample contributions suggested by the community are included in the slide below:\n\n \n![ApeCoin_-_Card_07.png](ipfs://bafkreialqqeptaukwn4y7rhgat7prfjzz43yt2vbeqe5ftxbinwfl3lew4)\n    \n\n## Rewarding Value\nTo ensure we only reward valuable contributions, ThriveCoin - the tech powering Thank Aavegotchi - provides five layers of bot and bad actor protection:\n\no Granular community control over rewarded activities\no System designed to incentivize concentration of activity within one account\no System can flexibly shift validation criteria in alignment with community \nneeds\no Delayed review and reward states supporting additional layers of detection\nSpectrum of oversight for reward verification\n\n\n## Case Study\nThriveCoin has been supporting Bankless DAO across two seasons. During this time, we have experienced broad adoption and support, and we have increased core user engagement across the DAO. Below are just a few examples:\n\no 182% seasonal increase in Bankless DAO members using ThriveCoin\no 89% increase in recognized contributions made across Bankless DAO\no 41% increase in contributions from top 50 Bankless DAO members\n\n## Team\n ![image](ipfs://bafkreiewvgsaa56fa23xdlh3ucedpsx3cuo7pui2o2jwvuvr3i2nuhpr4e)\n        \nWe think about the team in two ways:\n\nThank Aavegotchi Advisory Board:\n\n[The first board selection will occur after this proposal passes the sig-prop. Top contributors have expressed the desire to nominate themselves and/or others for the board positions.]\n\nThe Thank Aavegotchi board oversees Thank Aavegotchi - from choosing contributions rewarded to choosing reward amounts. Their job is to look at data, get feedback from the community, and continuously iterate to better serve the community.\n\nThe board role requires 1 to 3 hours of work a week. Because this is work in support of the community, board members will be compensated at a TBD rate proposed and ratified in a community vote (e.g. they will not choose their own compensation).\n\nAdditionally, as suggested on our weekly Aavegotchi & ThriveCoin Discord community calls, board members will hold their roles for six months at a time, and one board member will be selected from each of the seven community pillars included in the slide above.\n\n## ThriveCoin:\nThe ThriveCoin team will implement and maintain all the technology onboarding, implementation, and support. Additionally, we will hold community calls on the Aavegotchi Discord server in which we offer expertise, best practices, and feedback.\n\nThriveCoin’s tech supports ApeCoin DAO, Bankless DAO, and other top DAO communities. We are web3 natives, VC funded, and have been working with Aavegotchi members for months to ensure this proposal is aligned with community needs.\n\n## Timeline:\no March and April: Feedback on Discord/Discourse.\no Late April / early May: Snapshot Proposal sig-prop and core-prop passed.\no June: Thank Aavegotchi: Reward format I\no July: Thank Aavegotchi: Reward format II\no August: Thank Aavegotchi: Reward format III  \no Monthly: Review contribution data; optimize contributions and rewards.\no Monthly: Ongoing support, best practices, bot, bad actor, sybil protection.\no Monthly: 10% increase invaluable metaverse and governance contributions.\n \n![ApeCoin_-_Card_10.png](ipfs://bafkreihcdfnlacg3pfz4tr4xygytknb57hjxc43ov6hf5d4cvbgcrrx7ey)\n    \n## Goals:\nOur goal with Thank Aavegotchi is to ensure that every community member is thanked for their valuable contributions to the DAO with $GHST and an on-chain thank you note. This should drive more efficiency, utility, and value in the community.\n\nTo measure the success of Thank Aavegotchi, baseline contribution data will be established and will be tracked throughout the initiative. We will provide monthly reports on our progress, and share successes and learning as we go.\nAdditionally, we have a set of tech-provision milestones: \n\n- Launch Thank Aavegotchi within one month of grant\n- 20+ auto-validated, auto-rewarded ways to contribute at launch\n- 50+ auto-validated, auto-rewarded ways to contribute 3 months after launch\n- 99% uptime of Thank Aavegotchi webpage and supporting services\n\n## Specifications\nDuring our 3-month Thank Aavegotchi pilot, we will reward value-creating contributions to the community across web3, web2, and IRL. Valuable contributions can exist across many dozens of platforms, including those on the slide below and many more!\n      \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidv7tlvqdmzv5hnalxivpjnn7huwhuvisigcrcy2zdj7cb6xbcurm)\n        \nWe will use the ThriveCoin technology to do the following:\n\n1. Auto-validate contributions:\n-Auto-validate activities across all relevant platforms\n-Granular control over which activities to reward\n-Platform-specific quality control filters to greatly reduce fraud risk\n\n2. Auto-thank contributors on-chain:\n-Auto-record contributions on the Mumbai network, Polygon chain\n-Auto-log in IPFS file (blockchain storage) referenced in on-chain record\n\n3. Auto-reward contributors with $GHST and charitable contributions:\n-Contributions will occur within one Season of three months\n-Contributors receive their $GHST rewards at the end of the Season\n\n## Impact:\nThank Aavegotchi should result in an increase in valuable DAO contributions, as determined by community members.\nSustainability Goal + Benefits to Aavegotchi DAO:\nAssuming the initiative is a success, we will help create a self-sustaining rewards system that can fund itself without continuous grants from the DAO-treasury. We are developing such a system with ApeCoin DAO, Bankless DAO, and others, and we are excited to propose it after the first few successful months of our work together.\n\n## Risks + Potential Consequences:\nOverall, Thank Aavegotchi is designed to be a low-risk way of exploring the impact of thanking Aavegotchi members for their valuable contributions to the DAO.\n\n$GHST is only allocated upon performance - including performance milestones ThriveCoin must achieve. We understand the importance of good stewardship of treasury funds.\n\n## Overall Cost + Alternative Paths:\nThe cost for the Thank Aavegotchi pilot is 18,000 $GHST a month for 3 months.\nThe cost is performance-based.\nThere is enormous upside if we can drive greater value for the DAO.\nThere is little financial risk.\n1. 100% performance-based. Rewards are distributed at the end of each month (Season) after contributions are made.\n2. Up to 15,000 $GHST a month, on average, distributed back to community members who make valuable contributions.\n3. Up to 3,000 $GHST a month, on average, distributed to ThriveCoin for milestone achievement. The cost includes all tech, white-labeling, integrations, 24/7 support, and extensive customization.\n4. Two weeks before successful completion of the pilot, a proposal will be submitted to support one 3-month extension on the pilot. \n5. If we’ve had two successful pilots together, we will submit one final proposal to ensure Thank Aavegotchi continues to drive sustainable, ongoing value for our community!  \n\n**Alternative: the same concept, structure, and cost above, but using Alchemica tokens as the rewards in addition to $GHST. We will coordinate with the community to request community-desired amounts in $FUD, $FOMO, $ALPHA, $KEK and $GLTR.**\n\n## Final thoughts\nThank Aavegotchi allows Aavegotchi DAO members to be thanked (rewarded and recognized) for your valuable contributions to the DAO. The impact should be more excitement, more efficiency, and more value for our DAO.\n\nThis pilot is a performance-based grant. It uses ~0.05% of the Aavegotchi DAO treasury, most of which goes to value-contributing Aavegotchi DAO members. It’s a small investment that has the opportunity to pay off very, very big.  \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibnmapaqapwwqazaajb7mdxdmjsys5wtx3ygzyqzm4o66iuet6lae)\n        \n**Snapshot Signaling Proposal Time: 7 Days**\n\nTotal proposal is for 54,000 GHST (currently $59,400 in USDC) with the vast majority allocated directly back to the Aavegotchi DAO community.\n\nDisbursement Addresses:\n\nThank Aavegotchi community multisig: 45,000 GHST (currently $49,500 USDC) or equivalent in Alchemica (If Path B) allocated over 3 months to:\nPolygon: 0xB383d59F337ebd93308d494C47Ce520c8cE10078\n\nThriveCoin multisig: 9,000 GHST (currently 9,900 in USDC) or equivalent in Alchemica (If Path B) allocated after reaching Thrive’s Tech Provision Milestones to:\nPolygon: 0xdf673bAf06511E972a26E3C8389686BD0E52770D\n\nPS we already designed the Thank Aavegotchi community page.

      "content": "Author: @Maxicrouton\nGotchiID: #4285\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 3 days\nLinks to Discourse:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/734081492967489576/1103717472034627684\n\nHello everyone,\n\nJust wanted to inform you that we have received about 763,000 GHST from GotchiVault (GV) after the 0vix exploit.\n\nTo summarize the exploit: The 0vix exploit involved market manipulation by driving up the price of vGHST, which was listed on 0vix. The hacker bought a huge amount of GHST, sent it to GV to increase the vGHST price greatly. Ultimately, the hacker made off with over a million dollars from deposits made by 0vix users, but to carry out the exploit, they had to give about 1 million GHST to GV. (Giving a lot to LP fees/MEV/market makers/arbers too)\n\nGotchiVault then voted to return 20% of the GHST obtained from the hacker to 0vix and 80% to the Aavegotchi DAO. The DAO must now decide what to do with the funds.\n\nWe can either wait for a proposal from the 0vix team, or I can submit a snapshot proposal in the next few days. I see only two options for these funds:\n\nA) Return them to 0vix.\nB) Return them to GotchiVault (and publicly state that it is not our business).\n\nKeeping the funds is not an option for the DAO in my opinion.\n\nHere are my (personal) thoughts on the matter:\n\n1) I don't like the fact that GotchiVault passed the hot potato to us.\n2) 0vix was foolish to list an asset that had been manipulated in the past (just look at the chart). Aave had \"frozen\" the GHST market after the end of the curve.\n3) I really don't want the DAO to keep the funds. Let's return them to GotchiVault or 0vix, but really, we should not keep them.\n4) The DAO should not suffer from this hack and should not bail out any party.\n5) The DAO can provide a GHST buyback (pending snapshot vote, obviously) for the 1 million dollars of GHST to avoid a huge market sell.\n6) I think the best solution is to return the funds to Ovix and discuss a buyback of those funds with them.",

      "content": "**Author:** @thrivegiraffe\n**GotchiID:** #23926\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:**  20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Links to Discourse:** \nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/thank-aavegotchi-proposal-scalable-automated-on-chain-rewards-for-valuable-aavegotchi-dao-contributions/4763\n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1084501947647795220\n\nThriveCoin support: Daniel (@thrivegiraffe), Senad (@senad.eth), Joe (@Above_Average_Joe), and Robert (@shepherd)\nAavegotchi proposal co-creation support: @stedari, @Thrax, @diddlypoo. @Mycaleum, @0xZFi, @Hefe, @zimteemo and many dozens of people who have been on our weekly Discord calls in the Aavegotchi server for over a month. → Thank you!\n\n## Summary:\nAavegotchi DAO members provide extraordinary support to the DAO. They could provide even more - and better - support if they are thanked for their valuable DAO contributions with $GHST and an on-chain thank you note!\n\nWe propose a 3-month Thank Aavegotchi pilot to thank (reward and recognize) valuable contributions to Aavegotchi DAO with $GHST + an on-chain thank you note. We’ll do it in a way that is automated, scalable, on-chain, and protects against bots and bad actors.\n\nThe impact of rewarding Aavegotchi DAO members for your value-creating contributions should be greater efficiency, utility, and value for Aavegotchi DAO as well as more shared ownership in our community.\n\nDuring pilot, we will test 3 different rewards formats in 3 1-month “seasons”:\n\nSeason 1: 15k total $GHST raffled to 30 winners. Each contribution you make to the DAO earns you “raffle tickets”. \n\nSeason 2: 15k total $GHST rewarding each valuable contribution you make. \n\nSeason 3: 15k total $GHST rewarding you in rarity-farming style. \n\nAt the culmination of the third month, the community will vote on which rewards format you prefer. If a follow-up proposal passes to continue our pilot for an additional 3 months, rewards for the second pilot will be in the winning format. \n  \n![ApeCoin_-_Card_01.png](ipfs://bafkreif2w53zavvdquibgnvizqv4hdkubge6r4smeqhjnkt3govpfa3gty)\n\n## Rationale:\nWe are deeply aligned with Aavegotchi’s work to enable true asset ownership for gamers at the protocol level. The excitement of this work is palpable in every community event and call we’ve been a part of since the beginning.\n\nTo continue pushing this work forward, we must incentivize valuable contributions across our DAO in a way that is automated, scalable, on-chain (transparent), and protects against bots and bad actors.\n\nWhile Thank Aavegotchi can automate limitless valuable DAO activity, we propose to start by focusing on rewarding metaverse and governance activities most valued by the Aavegotchi DAO community - which we’ve served in weekly Aavegotchi DAO & ThriveCoin Discord conversations.\n\nSample contributions suggested by the community are included in the slide below:\n\n \n![ApeCoin_-_Card_07.png](ipfs://bafkreialqqeptaukwn4y7rhgat7prfjzz43yt2vbeqe5ftxbinwfl3lew4)\n    \n\n## Rewarding Value\nTo ensure we only reward valuable contributions, ThriveCoin - the tech powering Thank Aavegotchi - provides five layers of bot and bad actor protection:\n\no Granular community control over rewarded activities\no System designed to incentivize concentration of activity within one account\no System can flexibly shift validation criteria in alignment with community \nneeds\no Delayed review and reward states supporting additional layers of detection\nSpectrum of oversight for reward verification\n\n\n## Case Study\nThriveCoin has been supporting Bankless DAO across two seasons. During this time, we have experienced broad adoption and support, and we have increased core user engagement across the DAO. Below are just a few examples:\n\no 182% seasonal increase in Bankless DAO members using ThriveCoin\no 89% increase in recognized contributions made across Bankless DAO\no 41% increase in contributions from top 50 Bankless DAO members\n\n## Team\n ![image](ipfs://bafkreiewvgsaa56fa23xdlh3ucedpsx3cuo7pui2o2jwvuvr3i2nuhpr4e)\n        \nWe think about the team in two ways:\n\nThank Aavegotchi Advisory Board:\n\n[The first board selection will occur after this proposal passes the sig-prop. Top contributors have expressed the desire to nominate themselves and/or others for the board positions.]\n\nThe Thank Aavegotchi board oversees Thank Aavegotchi - from choosing contributions rewarded to choosing reward amounts. Their job is to look at data, get feedback from the community, and continuously iterate to better serve the community.\n\nThe board role requires 1 to 3 hours of work a week. Because this is work in support of the community, board members will be compensated at a TBD rate proposed and ratified in a community vote (e.g. they will not choose their own compensation).\n\nAdditionally, as suggested on our weekly Aavegotchi & ThriveCoin Discord community calls, board members will hold their roles for six months at a time, and one board member will be selected from each of the seven community pillars included in the slide above.\n\n## ThriveCoin:\nThe ThriveCoin team will implement and maintain all the technology onboarding, implementation, and support. Additionally, we will hold community calls on the Aavegotchi Discord server in which we offer expertise, best practices, and feedback.\n\nThriveCoin’s tech supports ApeCoin DAO, Bankless DAO, and other top DAO communities. We are web3 natives, VC funded, and have been working with Aavegotchi members for months to ensure this proposal is aligned with community needs.\n\n## Timeline:\no March and April: Feedback on Discord/Discourse.\no Late April / early May: Snapshot Proposal sig-prop and core-prop passed.\no June: Thank Aavegotchi: Reward format I\no July: Thank Aavegotchi: Reward format II\no August: Thank Aavegotchi: Reward format III  \no Monthly: Review contribution data; optimize contributions and rewards.\no Monthly: Ongoing support, best practices, bot, bad actor, sybil protection.\no Monthly: 10% increase invaluable metaverse and governance contributions.\n \n![ApeCoin_-_Card_10.png](ipfs://bafkreihcdfnlacg3pfz4tr4xygytknb57hjxc43ov6hf5d4cvbgcrrx7ey)\n    \n## Goals:\nOur goal with Thank Aavegotchi is to ensure that every community member is thanked for their valuable contributions to the DAO with $GHST and an on-chain thank you note. This should drive more efficiency, utility, and value in the community.\n\nTo measure the success of Thank Aavegotchi, baseline contribution data will be established and will be tracked throughout the initiative. We will provide monthly reports on our progress, and share successes and learning as we go.\nAdditionally, we have a set of tech-provision milestones: \n\n- Launch Thank Aavegotchi within one month of grant\n- 20+ auto-validated, auto-rewarded ways to contribute at launch\n- 50+ auto-validated, auto-rewarded ways to contribute 3 months after launch\n- 99% uptime of Thank Aavegotchi webpage and supporting services\n\n## Specifications\nDuring our 3-month Thank Aavegotchi pilot, we will reward value-creating contributions to the community across web3, web2, and IRL. Valuable contributions can exist across many dozens of platforms, including those on the slide below and many more!\n      \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidv7tlvqdmzv5hnalxivpjnn7huwhuvisigcrcy2zdj7cb6xbcurm)\n        \nWe will use the ThriveCoin technology to do the following:\n\n1. Auto-validate contributions:\n-Auto-validate activities across all relevant platforms\n-Granular control over which activities to reward\n-Platform-specific quality control filters to greatly reduce fraud risk\n\n2. Auto-thank contributors on-chain:\n-Auto-record contributions on the Mumbai network, Polygon chain\n-Auto-log in IPFS file (blockchain storage) referenced in on-chain record\n\n3. Auto-reward contributors with $GHST and charitable contributions:\n-Contributions will occur within one Season of three months\n-Contributors receive their $GHST rewards at the end of the Season\n\n## Impact:\nThank Aavegotchi should result in an increase in valuable DAO contributions, as determined by community members.\nSustainability Goal + Benefits to Aavegotchi DAO:\nAssuming the initiative is a success, we will help create a self-sustaining rewards system that can fund itself without continuous grants from the DAO-treasury. We are developing such a system with ApeCoin DAO, Bankless DAO, and others, and we are excited to propose it after the first few successful months of our work together.\n\n## Risks + Potential Consequences:\nOverall, Thank Aavegotchi is designed to be a low-risk way of exploring the impact of thanking Aavegotchi members for their valuable contributions to the DAO.\n\n$GHST is only allocated upon performance - including performance milestones ThriveCoin must achieve. We understand the importance of good stewardship of treasury funds.\n\n## Overall Cost + Alternative Paths:\nThe cost for the Thank Aavegotchi pilot is 18,000 $GHST a month for 3 months.\nThe cost is performance-based.\nThere is enormous upside if we can drive greater value for the DAO.\nThere is little financial risk.\n1. 100% performance-based. Rewards are distributed at the end of each month (Season) after contributions are made.\n2. Up to 15,000 $GHST a month, on average, distributed back to community members who make valuable contributions.\n3. Up to 3,000 $GHST a month, on average, distributed to ThriveCoin for milestone achievement. The cost includes all tech, white-labeling, integrations, 24/7 support, and extensive customization.\n4. Two weeks before successful completion of the pilot, a proposal will be submitted to support one 3-month extension on the pilot. \n5. If we’ve had two successful pilots together, we will submit one final proposal to ensure Thank Aavegotchi continues to drive sustainable, ongoing value for our community!  \n\n**Alternative: the same concept, structure, and cost above, but using Alchemica tokens as the rewards in addition to $GHST. We will coordinate with the community to request community-desired amounts in $FUD, $FOMO, $ALPHA, $KEK and $GLTR.**\n\n## Final thoughts\nThank Aavegotchi allows Aavegotchi DAO members to be thanked (rewarded and recognized) for your valuable contributions to the DAO. The impact should be more excitement, more efficiency, and more value for our DAO.\n\nThis pilot is a performance-based grant. It uses ~0.05% of the Aavegotchi DAO treasury, most of which goes to value-contributing Aavegotchi DAO members. It’s a small investment that has the opportunity to pay off very, very big.  \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibnmapaqapwwqazaajb7mdxdmjsys5wtx3ygzyqzm4o66iuet6lae)\n        \n**Snapshot Signaling Proposal Time: 7 Days**\n\nTotal proposal is for 54,000 GHST (currently $59,400 in USDC) with the vast majority allocated directly back to the Aavegotchi DAO community.\n\nDisbursement Addresses:\n\nThank Aavegotchi community multisig: 45,000 GHST (currently $49,500 USDC) or equivalent in Alchemica (If Path B) allocated over 3 months to:\nPolygon: 0xB383d59F337ebd93308d494C47Ce520c8cE10078\n\nThriveCoin multisig: 9,000 GHST (currently 9,900 in USDC) or equivalent in Alchemica (If Path B) allocated after reaching Thrive’s Tech Provision Milestones to:\nPolygon: 0xdf673bAf06511E972a26E3C8389686BD0E52770D\n\nPS we already designed the Thank Aavegotchi community page.

      "title": "[AGIP 82] [Mechanic Change] -- Channel Alchemica through a -2 kinship burn",
      "content": "\n**Author:** @Yanik_ai, @AL\n**Gotchi ID:** 10504\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Discourse thread:** https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1087881280210870333\n\nThis proposal re-attempts to change kinship mechanics so that kinship points are burned during each Gotchi channeling event. Current Alchemica emission trajectories forecast an annual increase of 40% in supply due to persistent increases in Gotchi kinship multipliers at no cost to the player. The proposed change is a -2 kinship point burn per each Gotchi channeling event.\n\nAdditionally, a new rental permission will also be added for Aavegotchis that will on default be set to “NO” to avoid player friction with accidental kinship burning. Players may toggle this feature to allow renters to channel their gotchis or keep it off to preserve kinship.\n\nSome benefits of this proposal:\nPlayers will immediately face trade-offs for how to use kinship. This translates to either burning it at the altar to produce resources, or preserving it for other Aavegotchi uses like rarity farming, future gotchiverse functions, or expenditure in other games.\n\nDevelops some standardization around spending kinship. Serves as a good foundation for future spending utility.\n\nThere is a timing impact of this proposal where future Gotchiverse developments should provide meaningful kinship buffs from Pixelcraft efforts or through use in other games.\n\nThe specific burn rate can be adjusted via DAO vote over time if needed. The bigger focus is just implementing the mechanic change.\n\nAlchemica emissions should lower as players opt to save points for kinship leaderboard ranking funded by the Aavegotchi protocol instead of spending them to expand their Gotchiverse assets.\n\nThe Graph of FUD emissions below shows the short and long-run effects of this proposal. Emissions reductions would be immediate and their impacts long-lasting if implemented. For example, after 1 year of implementation the emissions reductions is about -55% from the current trajectory & -20% reduction from a baseline of 0. \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigktjisgcxvsdotljvqk5ca4dd4obfiuukzgzfzmd7vze3fnifva4)\n    \nPotential Risks:\nPlayers with newly summoned, or low kinship gotchis will lose channeling abilities if they want their kinship to grow. A counter-argument is\nLess engagement with Aavegotchis due to expected loss of channeling activity.\nAdditional complexity. This mechanic opens the door for dynamic strategy, but also has potential to overwhelm newcomers.\n\nThis work was the result of several people’s efforts including, but not limited to @Yanik_AI as the original kinship burning author, Alchemica + GLTR Task Force, @Immaterial for the edits, and feedback from the discussions boards.

The directors have been discussing the importance of DAO officer roles for some time, and I believe it's crucial to start the process by appointing a treasurer for the DAO.\nDAO officer roles are important because sometimes directors' tasks go beyond signing transactions on DAO proposals. These roles help to further structure the DAO. That's why I am running for the position of treasurer.\n\nThe purpose of the treasurer role would be to:\n\nEnsure that all movement of funds asked to the DAO is completely clear, without missinterprertation possible.\nEnsure that all movement of funds is smooth, swap contracts have sufficient funds, transfer of funds is done in a timely manner, etc.\nPrepare a monthly summary of the DAO treasury that is accessible to all.\nStay informed about DAO proposals, ongoing funding, and the status of the treasury.\nAdditionally, the role would also serve as an \"expert\" role, advising directors on how to interact with smart contracts to minimize losses to the DAO.\n\nAs a current director, I receive a payment of 2,000 GHST every three months. Given the active nature of the treasurer role, I plan to dedicate two hours per day to this role and will be requesting an increase in compensation to 5,000 GHST per three months.\n\nWhy choose me?\n\nI possess in-depth knowledge of DeFi and market making, enabling me to provide valuable advice on all financial decisions related to the DAO.\nI am well-versed in the DAO's structure and DAO fund locations. I think having a go-to person for all treasury matters can be helpful for the DAO.\nMy participation in the Curve transition team and in directors group allow me to be aware and understand every fund move.\n\n***Thank you for considering me for the treasurer role. ***\n\n\n",

      "title": "[AGIP 80] Fund development of Strategotchi - Digital Multiplayer version",
      "content": "**Author:** Laggin | STRATEGOTCHI#9341\n**Gotchi ID:** 8977\n**Funding Request:** 131,400 USD\n**Development time:** 4-6 months\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Discourse thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/introducing-strategotchi/4671\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe Strategotchi team is seeking a grant to complete the design and development of Strategotchi - Digital Multiplayer version.\n\nThe team aims to expand the Aavegotchi universe with a unique multiplayer gaming experience that favors politics and alliance building as heavily as strategy and gaming ability.\n\nIntroductory post + litepaper:\n\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/introducing-strategotchi/4671\n\nLong Term Value:\n\nAdditionally, the grant will aid in bootstrapping Strata Inc., a legitimate software development company capable of providing long-term value to the ecosystem. By establishing a legal entity we can improve credibility, accountability, and better facilitate contracting with third parties, thereby enhancing the potential for scaling and achieving significant impact on adoption.\n\nA Gotchi Multiplayer Strategy Game\n\nOur game takes place in the Gotchiverse Grid, bringing players outside of the Citaadel for the first time and expanding on the established lore\n\nIt features a new type of asset in the form of Guild Cards; NFT assets with in-game utility that allow players to build custom decks and tailor their play style to their preference.\n\nGuild Cards Season 1 - Tokenomics and Distribution:\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/guild-cards-season-1-tokenomics-and-distribution/4724\n\nToken Sinks:\n\nThe game will provide a sink for native tokens through “Ranked Mode” buy-ins in GHST and/or Alchemica. Future plans for sinks include crafting a Strategotchi Board Tile for Gotchiverse parcels, a Seasonal LE Guild Waarz Trophy deco, and de-gen game modes (Sacrificial Gotchi) that, utilizing Forge smelting, will create deflationary pressure on Gotchis and wearables.\n\nGuild vs Guild:\n\nAlong with the development of the game, the team will host the Strategotchi Inaugural Guild Tournament, a precursor to Guild Waarz, our model for an ongoing seasonal tournament that gives guilds the opportunity to make their mark in Gotchiverse History with custom skinned Limited Edition Trophies\n\nGotchichain:\n\nWith the ability to process more than 2000 transactions per second, Gotchichain can provide a seamless and responsive gaming experience. This is why PC sees the potential for Strategotchi to launch with heavy support in Gotchichain's launch window\n\nBudget:\n\nWe are seeking 131,400 USD (GHST equivalent) paid in 2 installments.\nA 50% upfront payment of 65,700 USD to be transferred upon successful passing of a core prop. The subsequent 50% (65,700 USD) to be paid upon the successful completion of the single player mode MVP (based on DAO foundation members’ judgment)\n\nDeliverables:\n\nSeason 1 Guild Cards Distribution (GBM)\nSingle player mode (digital)\nMultiplayer mode (digital)\nInaugural Guild Tournament (precursor to Guild Waarz)\n\nCost Breakdown:\n\nDevelopment: 61,200 USD\n\nArt: 48,200 USD\n\nManagement: 22,000 USD\n\nTotal: 131,400 USD (GHST equivalent)\n\nOriginal budget: 87.6k GHST ($1.5/GHST)\n\nRoadmap + Budget:\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/strategotchi-roadmap-budget-proposal/4711\n\nConclusion:\n\nWe believe this project has the potential to attract a new player base and expose the Aavegotchi IP to a new audience of strategy game enthusiasts, aligning it with the 2023 roadmap set out by PC, focusing on gaming and player growth.\n\nIt also serves our existing community by expanding utility of native assets as well as providing an engaging social experience involving Guild play, and pioneering the path for Guild vs. Guild competition.\n\nAs of today, I have achieved a verbal understanding with PC to have a limited licensing agreement extended to this project. Such a license will move into drafting and signatures only after the passage of this Sigprop. The agreement grants PC 20% of the revenue, and includes their support with smart contract development. (The remaining 80% is to be split evenly between player rewards and the DAO.)\n\nIt's important to emphasize that this grant is specifically for the digital version of the game, although plans for an official PC physical version are already being discussed. From my talks with the PC team, they are very enthusiastic about the idea and already have multiple manufacturing and distribution leads for the tabletop physical.\n\nWe are super excited and highly driven to embark on this ebic project, frens. With your support, Strata aims to establish itself as a reliable and valuable contributor to the ecosystem over the long haul. We are eager to have your backing and work together to transform our aspirations into a reality!\n",

      "title": "[AGIP 79] Forge 2.0 Request for Funding",
      "content": "**Author:** Dr Wagmi (Dr Wagmi#6629)\n**Gotchi ID:** #16635\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Discourse thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/forge-2-0-proposal-discussion/4736\n\nProposal Summary:\n• Hire the Forge Team for a 3-month period with an overall UI/UX focus\n• Planned deliverables: full geode functionality with refilling of prize pool with at least 3 new schematics; respec potion completion and distribution; strong UI/UX focus with main website integration of the Dressing Room w/ similar art/RPG feel as offered by the Forge UI; major improvements to Forge UI/UX; operationalize a schematic pipeline for new schematic releases\n• No plans for further core or alloy release in this period\n• Goal is for content to accrue value to native assets (gotchis, wearables)\n• Backgrounds, wearable skins, evolving pets and a new BRS-modifying slot will be tabled for further technical development. The Forge Team will prevent the most viable and community-favored project(s) for the next Forge installment.\n• Compensation is denominated in USD instead of GHST for a total of $161,825 for the Forge Team and a 10,000 GHST bounty budget\n\nThe Aavegotchi Forge Team proposes a 3 month contracted period of service to the Aavegotchi DAO to continue developing and improve features on the Aavegotchi protocol and User Interface. Over this three-month period, we plan to “stick the landing” for the Forge, add additional User Interface work w/ an integrated dressing room, and outline potential new features that can be pursued by the Forge Team or other design teams.\n\nA contracted three-month period allows the team to take on multiple projects simultaneously. It also allows our team the ability to provide rolling economic data, maintain and improve the UI, update the Core Framework document, and maximally engage the community. The Forge launch on 2/22 generated >$256,000 in total sales. We anticipate we will be able to continue to generate revenue without inflating cores or alloy and aim for budget neutrality or better while delivering new content, advancing the protocol, improving user experience, and providing value to native assets.\n\nForge Team Roadmap:\n• Geodes: Regardless of this proposal, the Forge team will debut the minimal viable Geode ASAP with function to obtain the 400 legendary Forge set schematics. As part of this proposal, the Forge Team will develop additional schematics for some of the unmatched cores from the Forge Launch auction. Plan to reload the prize pool by the end of April, ideally with multi-tier rarity functionality.\n• Review and complete the technical design and airdrop “Respec Potions”\n• UI Upgrade: Integrate the “Dressing Room” to the main Aavegotchi website. Create a dress-up and buy now option with new art, new NPC, and Aavegotchi aesthetic. Additionally, we will focus on overall UI/UX improvement with the goal of maximally educating users on protocol assets.\n• Schematic pipeline – Will operationalize new schematic creation with predictable schematic releases, randomized/fair trait selection, intentional approach to avoid power creep, and maximally assist in translating new wearables to Gotchiverse functionality\n• Updates to wearables.report (market data reporting) site to account for new wearables mechanics:\n• Add a dashboard of metrics related to The Forge (include reporting on two new mechanics developed by The Forge team)\n• Update existing metrics to account for changes in supply related to forging\n• UI/UX improvements (mostly navigation related to accommodate additional content, with some minor aesthetic updates\n• Back-end code improvements to allow for modularity and expandability in the future\n\nFuture Project Outlines – Forge Team to investigate and prepare potential proposals for the following:\n• Outline and potentially implement the transition from FRENS to GLTR for raffle tickets\n• New/Custom backgrounds – Develop a path for the community to design unique backgrounds and/or obtain Forge Team/Pixelcraft designed backgrounds\n• Wearable skins/non-BRS-modifying wearables – Continue aesthetics focus by creating a path for wearable skins w/ goal to maximize community-created content.\n• New BRS-modifying slot – Will be tabled for further economic and technical development for presentation to the DAO in Q3 2023\n• Evolving pets/Upgradeable wearables – Tabled for further technical development and separate proposal for the DAO, though it still may be implemented by the Forge Team during the 3-month period or beyond.\n\nForge Team Stipend:\nFor this work, diddly will be hired on as a full-time developer and responsible for all technical builds, solidity work and front-end management. This stipend for the Lead Developer role includes pay for extensive work performed in February-March 2023 to complete the Forge and to build the mobile user interface for a 4 month total stipend vs 3 months for the rest of the team. The three other roles will be part time ~20 hours/week. The 10,000 GHST bounty budget is to maximize external contributions and facilitate open contributions as much as possible.\n\nExecution Details:\n• Three disbursements in DAI from the DAO Treasury Wallet to the Forge Team Wallet which will be specified in the core proposal:\no $61,825 upon passage of core proposal\no $50,000 30 days after passage of core proposal\no $50,000 60 days after passage of core proposal\no Funds will be sent to the following address: 0xa60CD32d13d1D99c1141eebD6D6F07652F19B982\n\nIn summary, we are requesting compensation for a dedicated 3-month period to form a devoted, highly skilled and proven team to continue developing the protocol. We strongly believe we will create more value than our asking cost as demonstrated by our previous success. We look forward to this period of exponential growth and helping the DAO continue its transition through the metamorphosis phase.\n-The Forge Team\n",

This sail will be great passive advertising for us and allows for active marketing to charter clients.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibfnpbwmdznwxkb6l7rekx63wd3jjfjwbso4p5d6egxn4hdumsk4y)\n    \n\nI got a quote on a billboard in our area, they charge **$1200 a month** with around 5400 views a day and are sold out. We’d get **5 years easy compared to 6 months** with a billboard with easily a few hundred sets of eyes on the sail each trip.\n\nWe run 100-130 trips throughout the year. Trips are 2-5+ hours and we often have 12+ people onboard. The boat is owned and paid for and the sail is expected to last 5 to 10+ years from this sail and the costs of a billboard or something similar are way higher and less unique and targeted.\n\n115 trips x 3 hours= 345 hours/year\n345 hours x 5 years =1725 hours\n$7700/1725 hours =$4.4/per hour of advertising minimum\n\n**BENEFITS:** Captive target audience with extra income and crypto knowledge, unique advertising opportunity, media capture, onboarding help and discounted sailing trips for Aavegotchi holders. Opens the door for a world of content creation and unique marketing with merch as well as offering a platform for IRL meetups. Building positive synergy between the DAO and community supporters. I've already been offering 50% off discounts for Aavegotchi holders for over a year.\n\n**POTENTIAL RISK/DOWNSIDE:** Damage to sail due to extreme weather (Hurricane, high-wind events, etc.) and daily usage. Sail must be used in the appropriate wind conditions to avoid damage. Advertising/Marketing funds could be used in other places.\n\nFunds should be sent as a single payment in DAI on Polygon to this address:\n0xc89A3292Eb0a8396A2505deB6195AFA7f83A8A30\n",

This dashboard, created in collaboration with Eitri (eitri#0228), will enable stakeholders to make informed decisions about the DAO’s operations and governance. It may also be useful to a bookkeeping and accounting team in the future, as it will provide summarized transaction information that can be posted as individual accounting ledger entries each month.\n\nThe dashboard will break down income sources, such as alchemica earned from Gotchiverse crafting, GHST earned from Baazaar fees and GBM auctions, and alloy earned from The Forge. It will also include a breakdown of various DAO token balances over time (GHST, DAI, alchemica, alloy, matic, and USDC).\n\nThe dashboard will be created using Dune Analytics. The complete specification for the dashboard can be reviewed here: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXVahA1sCNVdZntcTGUobbMByF55qNg3Sm8FGT4BuNDVd\n\nWe aim to complete the dashboard within six weeks of the proposal's passage by the DAO. We request 2,000 DAI in funding, which we will allocate as follows:\n\n1,500 DAI paid to Eitri to create the dashboard\n500 DAI paid to myself for writing the specification and project management\n\n**Potential Risks**\nOur initial investigation suggests that we can use the freely available Dune Analytics to create the dashboard. However, there is a possibility that we may need a supplemental tool as work progresses. If we identify the need for a supplemental paid tool as work progresses, we will inform the DAO and, if necessary, seek approval for additional funding.\n",

The competition is viewed by many as a necessary evil that is being used to reduce the circulating supply of alchemica being that the economy does not have any meaningful and sustainable burning mechanisms currently in place. The preceding spending competition was a marked success especially based on the amount the DAO paid verses the amount of alchemica that was burnt. Its success however had the unforeseen consequence of increased alchemica issuance due to incentivizing the building and leveling of installations. Being that the latest spending competition is similar to the first and has not really addressed the unavoidable issuance increase of alchemica that concerns many DAO members, I am proposing a change to the cool down times of all reservoirs to help mitigate the expected increase and help extend the time period between the need for another spending event.\n\nTHE PURPOSE\n The purpose of this proposal is :\n*To help further manage the issuance of alchemica tokens by adjusting the ability to claim from up to 3 times a day to only 2 times per day\n*To enact these changes early in the developmental stage as to prevent negatively affecting a vast amount of players later on\n*To reduce player's gas fees by increasing the period between claiming alchemica from reservoirs\n*To enact safeguards to help mitigated increases to issuance caused from additional parcels becoming active, future land sales and/or other unforeseen events\n*To help to extend the time-frame between spending events by maximizing the event's positive effect on reducing the circulating supply of alchemica.\n\nTHE DATA\n(https://dune.com/9stx6/aaltars-alchemica-emissions , https://dune.com/froid1911/gotchiverse-analytics) & https://dune.com/queries/1728950/2851336\n\n*In FUD we have 16,787 lvl 1 harvesters, at least 1,847 lvl 2-lvl 3 reservoirs, at least 2,179 lvl 4-lvl 6 reservoirs and at least 512 lvl 7- lvl 9 reservoirs. For a total of 10,894 reservoirs. \n*In FOMO we have 21,482 lvl harvesters, at least 1,732 lvl 2-lvl 3 reservoirs, at least 2,698 lvl 4-lvl 6 reservoirs and at least 894 lvl 7- lvl 9 reservoirs. For a total of 12,356 reservoirs. \n*In ALPHA we have 16,285 lvl harvesters, at least 1,533 lvl 2-lvl 3 reservoirs, at least 1,629 lvl 4-lvl 6 reservoirs and at least 480 lvl 7- lvl 9 reservoirs. For a total of 9,347 reservoirs\n*In KEK we have 11,328 lvl harvesters, at least 1,444 lvl 2-lvl 3 reservoirs, at least 1,418 lvl 4-lvl 6 reservoirs and at least 462 lvl 7- lvl 9 reservoirs. For a total of 8,501 reservoirs \nThis gives of the grand total of 41,098 reservoirs with 30,826 in the lvl 1- lvl 3 range which would be the cheapest to upgrade. \n(As of April 14 2023)\nThis shows how fast the amount of circulating tokens has been increasing using FOMO as an example, however all alchemica have almost the same steep trajectory.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibb52ovugl6uzwa2yqfghknrv7p476dgiuzpyracsgszk6kfpak5a)\n    \n\nHere is an example to show the effect a change could have using lvl 6 FOMO reservoirs. A lvl 6 reservoir’s capacity is 80 fomo so if emptied every 8 hours that’s 240 fomo daily and 1680 weekly. If we were to change it to a 12 hour schedule it would be reduced to 160 fomo daily and 1120 weekly. That would reduce issuance by 560 fomo weekly or 2240 fomo monthly. At first glance, it does not look to be a substantial reduction however when you apply it to the current total of 685 lvl 6 FOMO reservoirs the number transforms to a possible reduction to issuance of over 1.534 mil FOMO tokens monthly and that is just lvl 6 reservoirs.\n\nTHE PLAN\n I am proposing that the cool down time increase from 8 hours to 11 hours. Players would  benefit by having a natural 1 hour window to prevent time drift and this would easily facilitate an optimum 12 hour claiming schedule. \n\nPOTENTIAL BENEFITS\n This change will allow parcel owners the flexibility to maintain a 12 hour emptying rotation set to their individual preference on their reservoirs by adding a 1 hour drift window which would help especially in high fee/high traffic time periods.\nThe change would help to mediate increases in token issuance due to spending events by  limiting daily issuance.\nThis change will help to future proof increases to issuance caused by future parcels coming online, further leveling of reservoirs and future land sales which are still needed to complete the cathedral map by further gate keeping tokens entering the ecosystem. \nThe change would come at a time-frame that will not negatively affect the vast majority of landholders due to an early implementation.\n\nPOTENTIAL DOWNSIDE\n The biggest and probably the worse consequence from increasing the cool down time would be that we will have some owners sit with a full reservoir for 3 hours if they are on a 8 hour rotation of claiming their tokens presently.\n\nVOTING OPTIONS\nThe voting options will be:\n*Option 1: YES Change Reservoir Cool Down Times\n*Option 2: NO Do Not Change Cool Down Times\n",

      "title": "Cap the Max Earnings Received From Channeling",
      "content": "Author: Quincy1971#6786\nGotchi ID: 5375\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 8 days\nXP Reward: 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\nDiscourse link: \nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/cap-the-max-earnings-received-from-channeling/4748\nhttps://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1091512854026399835\nPROPOSAL SUMMARY\nThis proposal seeks to replace [Mechanic Change] -- Channel Alchemica through a -2 kinship burn\nThe topic of channeling has become a divisive one since the proposal to increase spillover percentage was raised and later passed. Kinship has been a part of Gotchi lore since the first one was summoned from the first portal and has been a part of Rarity Farming beginning with season 1. With kinship being the basis of how channeling earnings are calculated AND also being a Rarity Farming category, it makes channeling one of the most difficult to really balance. We don’t want to nerf owners by further affecting their earning by targeting kinship but we really need to address the long-term effects channeling poses to the economy. So I propose that we the DAO adjust the base channeling rate and put a cap on the max that a gotchi would earn, or simply put a cap on the multiplier earned thru kinship, at a number the DAO would vote on at a later date. This way a gotchi would naturally come to this set number without affecting RF because kinship itself would still rise normally. This would leave other options more viable for kinship use, for instance, mini games or other areas. Doing this we the DAO could help slow emissions without needlessly hurting gotchi owners.\nI propose doing this in 2 stages:\n*The first would be a vote to see if the DAO members are interested in pursuing this. If both the sigprop and coreprop pass, we continue to the second stage.\n*The second would be a separate sigprop requesting that the DAO  fund a bounty to have a third party model, for example, at least three (3) different kinship cap levels to see when at least 60% or perhaps 65% of the channeling gotchi will reach that point, the daily and/or weekly emissions projected before and after the caps are reached. I would open a new thread on the topic to get more input from the DAO on the various parameters that should be included in the modeling. \nFIRST STAGE\nThe initial proposal is to:\n*Change the base channeling rate from the current 20 FUD, 10 FOMO, 5 ALPHA, and 2 KEK to 15 FUD, 7.5 FOMO, 3.75 ALPHA and 1.4 KEK\n*To install a toggle on Gotchi listings to turn channeling On/Off with the default set to Off.\n\nPOTENTIAL BENEFITS\nThe changing of the channeling base rate would amount to 25% emissions reduction for FUD, FOMO and ALPHA while giving a 30% emissions reduction to KEK. \n*FUD total channeling is ~472k-FUD would drop to ~354k \n*FOMO total from channeling is ~239k-FOMO would drop to ~179k \n*ALPHA total from channeling is ~120k-ALPHA would drop to ~90k \n*KEK total from channeling is ~48k-KEK would drop to ~33.6k \n{Numbers are current as of 4/7/2023}\nThis change would immediately target emissions directly rather than a “quid pro quo” mechanic that is dependent on player actions.\nThis is not meant to be immutable. I envision the DAO having the ability to adjust the base channeling rate along with the multiplier or channeling cap based on the economic situation in the future.\nThis should take very little DEV effort to implement and would not negatively affect Rarity Leader boards by intermingling it with daily tasks .\nBoth low kinship gotchi and newborn gotchi will still be able to gain kinship and a cap is easily understood by new players being that caps are very common.\nAllows space for kinship to be utilized in other areas; for example mini-games and crafting.\nA toggle would help future proof lending when kinship could be used while the gotchi was being rented.\n\nPOTENTIAL DOWNSIDE\nThe decreasing of the channeling base rate would reduce earnings but with the plan move to the Gotchi Chain the fees to channel will be minimal and the DAO could re-examine spillover rates being that it does not affect emissions.\n\nVOTING OPTIONS\nThe three voting options will be:\n*Option 1: YES Continue to The Second Stage\n*Option 2: NO I Am Not Interested\n*Option 3: Abstain\n",

This sail will be great passive advertising for us and allows for active marketing to charter clients. \n\nI got a quote on a billboard in our area, they charge $1200 a month with around 5400 views a day and are sold out. We’d get 5 years easy compared to 6 months with a billboard with easily a few hundred sets of eyes on the sail each trip. \n \n![AAVEGOTCHI SAIL for GHST SHIP-1.jpg](ipfs://bafkreidmvjvkovh5tedz7tyy7uklcnnx4dnpe5ym5i6b2hudstxvtb2duy)\n\nWe run 100-130 trips throughout the year. Trips are 2-5+  hours and we often have 12+ people onboard. The boat is owned and paid for and the sail is expected to last 5 to 10+ years from this sail and the costs of a billboard or something similar are way higher and less unique and targeted. \n\n115 trips x 3 hours= 345 hours/year \n345 hours x 5 years =1725 hours\n$7700/1725 hours =$4.4/per hour of advertising minimum\n\nBENEFITS: Captive target audience with extra income and crypto knowledge, unique advertising opportunity, media capture, onboarding help and discounted sailing trips for Aavegotchi holders.

      "title": "Create a DAO Treasury Dashboard",
      "content": "Author: MikeyJay#4956\nGotchi ID: 15682\nDiscussion Links:\n- https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/create-a-dao-treasury-dashboard/4746\n- https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1091088201227194399\n\n## Proposal Summary\n\nI propose creating a DAO Treasury Dashboard to provide a clear overview of the Aavegotchi DAO’s financial health and activity. This dashboard, created in collaboration with Eitri (eitri#0228), will enable stakeholders to make informed decisions about the DAO’s operations and governance. It may also be useful to a bookkeeping and accounting team in the future, as it will provide summarized transaction information that can be posted as individual accounting ledger entries each month.\n\nThe dashboard will break down income sources, such as alchemica earned from Gotchiverse crafting, GHST earned from Baazaar fees and GBM auctions, and alloy earned from The Forge. It will also include a breakdown of various DAO token balances over time (GHST, DAI, alchemica, alloy, matic, and USDC).\n\nThe dashboard will be created using Dune Analytics. The complete specification for the dashboard can be reviewed here: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXVahA1sCNVdZntcTGUobbMByF55qNg3Sm8FGT4BuNDVd\n\nWe aim to complete the dashboard within six weeks of the proposal's passage by the DAO. We request 2,000 DAI in funding, which we will allocate as follows:\n\n- 1,500 DAI paid to Eitri to create the dashboard\n- 500 DAI paid to myself for writing the specification and project management\n\n## Potential Risks\n\nOur initial investigation suggests that we can use the freely available Dune Analytics to create the dashboard. However, there is a possibility that we may need a supplemental tool as work progresses. If we identify the need for a supplemental paid tool as work progresses, we will inform the DAO and, if necessary, seek approval for additional funding.\n",

      "content": "**Author:** Herro#4278\n**Gotchi ID:** #6626\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Discourse link:** https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1091014164291530762\n\n**Changes from SigProp: The proposal at AnataDAO is currently passing. We also added clarification on how the Anatas will be bought and how the community can use the DAO owned Anatas.**\n\n**WHAT**\nProvide Aavegotchi community with Anata NFT's. A similar proposal is passing with 100% in favor to buy Aavegotchi Gotchi’s from AnataDAO. The Anata team would TWAP buy GHST over a 1-3 day period and purchase Aavegotchi's / Portals on for our holders to participate in the Gotchiverse (Bazaar or Magic Eden, etc.).\n\n**ABOUT**\nAnata is a collection of 2,000 Anime Themed VTube rigged avatars. It is the NFT you use on calls, streams, meetings, etc. Each anata counts as one vote in Anata DAO. Anata is an art project heavily catered towards content creators. So far, the DAO has voted to provide every Anata NFT holder a 3D VRM, 1/1 PFP, Chibi, Upgraded 2D Vtuber Files, Gaming & Metaverse world integrations.\n\nHolders - 950\nActive Members - 100 (ish)\nTreasury - $4m+\nTeam - BigDSenpai, Grug, DCF God, Herro\n\n**WHY**\nI am a big believer in Aavegotchi. Some of you may remember I used to stream opening H1-H2 portals and giving away gotchi's at random to the community. I didn't have a Face Cam though - an Anata VTUBE avatar would have been perfect while playing - which makes chat and video way more interactive.\n\nAnata has a very large gaming sector, with gaming events & nights firing off 4-5 times per week. It would be great to intertwine what we are doing with Pudgy Penguins, Cozy Penguins and other communities with Aavegotchi games.\n\n**TLDR; more exposure into the gotchiverse by helping eachother get community members involved in both projects.**\n\n**COST**\nA) $10,000 DAI  (4-5 Anata)\nB) $20,000 DAI (9-11 Anata)\nC) Do Nothing\n\nAverage Anata price is .69-1ETH, the \"cost\" really depends on how much the DAO would want to give out to the community. I am all in favor of starting small if everyone else is.\n\nThe proposal would only be executed assuming the Anata DAO proposal passes. This is probably the best way to learn about Anata in under 2.5 minutes: https://twitter.com/AnataNFT/status/1625594906596249600\n\nVOD of Moon playing Gotchi Miners: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1779138941 \n\n**Aavegotchi DAO Owning Anatas**\nAavegotchi DAO will own the Anatas they purchase. Each Anata NFT comes with:\nFully rigged vtuber 2D Files\n3D VRM Files *soon to be completed*\n1/1 Profile Pictures\nAny future releases tied to that specific Anata NFT #\n\nThese files of the purchased Anata’s can be placed in an Aavegotchi holder-only discord channel for Aavegotchi community members to use.\n\n**Aavegotchi DAO  Buying Anatas**\nAavegotchi DAO will buy an equal (as reasonably possible) amount of Male & Female Anatas at the best prices (floor) across multiple marketplaces Blur, Opensea, etc. within two weeks after the proposal passing.\n \n\n    ",

I am happy to help formulate a new proposal in collaboration with the DAO based on aggregated feedback + additional input. \n\nWe can develop a satisfactory iteration of the previous DAO proposal reasonably quickly since extensive discussion exists. We will sort out details on management and delivery of meetings and associated media over 1-2 focused DAO calls. A subsequent proposal will get posted in addition to any challenging proposals (highly encouraged). The DAO can vote on the offering(s) of their choice.\n\nThis part of the last proposal did not seem like a point of contention and would serve as a reasonable way to continue moving forward with the DAO on what they would like to see from Sunday DAO calls.\n\nJanuary, February and March payments total 4800 GHST\n\nTreasury Details:\n4800 GHST priced @ the time of Signal Proposal Snapshot (1.07 USD/GHST)\nTotal disbursement amount in USD: 5,136\n\nPaid out to 0xfD95Dea0f353618826d5FA94be862D9cb0d4dda8 within 48 hours of Core Proposal passing in either DAI or USDC",

I believe 2 months is appropriate. Not too long since the sooner we had liquidity the better it is for the DAO/ecosystem, and doing it in less than 2 months would dilute our own LM program.\n\nTechnical details for the DAO directors: \nDeploy a new \"swap contract\" (see AGIP 69) with the Liquidity wallet as owner\nSwap $1.25M DAI into USDC. (can be done in little chunks)\nSend $1.25M USDC to the contract. (can be done in little chunks)\nWait 2 months for the swaps to finish.\nAdd all the funds on the GHST-USDC pool (Gamma V3 Quickswap pool)\n",

(With constant swaps over the period) \n\nNot having too long of a  timeline will help to have an average price closer to the price when we borrowed the funds.\n\nThe original Sigprop had four options for GHST Reimbursement, this CoreProp only includes the option that got the most support. Which is:\n\n\n1 GHST is 1 GHST, trying to reimburse the 2,740,000 GHST borrowed with $5M DAI (Would be at maximum $5M purchase of GHST, can be lower if we suceed to get enought GHST to reimburse the DAO with less than 5M$)\n\nTechnical details for the DAO directors: \nDeploy a new \"swap contract\" (see AGIP 69) with the Liquidity wallet as owner.\nSwap 3/4/5/$7.5M DAI into USDC. (can be done in little chunks)\nSend 3/4/5/$7.5M USDC to the contract. (can be done in little chunks)\nSend GHST to the Treasury Wallet. \n\n**Note: The 6 months swaps timeline specified can be changed to any timeline if the DAO is willing to.**",

      "title": "Fund development of Strategotchi - Digital Multiplayer version",
      "content": "Author: Laggin | STRATEGOTCHI#9341\nGotchi ID: 8977\nFunding Request: 131,400 USD\nDevelopment time: 4-6 months\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote Duration: 7 days\nDiscourse thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/introducing-strategotchi/4671\n\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe Strategotchi team are seeking a grant to complete the design and development of Strategotchi - Digital Multiplayer version.\n\nThe team aims to expand the Aavegotchi universe with a unique multiplayer gaming experience that favors politics and alliance building as heavily as strategy and gaming ability.\n\nIntroductory post + litepaper:\n https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/introducing-strategotchi/4671\n\n\nLongterm Value:\n\nAdditionally, the grant will aid in bootstrapping Strata Inc., a legitimate software development company capable of providing long-term value to the ecosystem. By establishing a legal entity we can improve credibility, accountability, and better facilitate contracting with third parties, thereby enhancing the potential for scaling and achieving significant impact on adoption.\n\nA Gotchi Multiplayer Strategy Game\n\nOur game takes place in the Gotchiverse Grid, bringing players outside of the Citaadel for the first time and expanding on the established lore\n\n\nIt features a new type of asset in the form of Guild Cards; NFT assets with in-game utility that allow players to build custom decks and tailor their play style to their preference.\n\nGuild Cards Season 1 - Tokenomics and Distribution:\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/guild-cards-season-1-tokenomics-and-distribution/4724\n\n\nToken Sinks:\n\nThe game will provide a sink for native tokens through “Ranked Mode” buy-ins in GHST and/or alchemica. Future plans for sinks include crafting a Strategotchi Board Tile for Gotchiverse parcels, a Seasonal LE Guild Waarz Trophy deco, and de-gen game modes (Sacrificial Gotchi) that, utilizing Forge smelting, will create deflationary pressure on Gotchis and wearables.\n\n\nGuild vs Guild:\n\nAlong with the development of the game, the team will host the Strategotchi Inaugural Guild Tournament, a precursor to Guild Waarz, our model for an ongoing seasonal tournament that gives guilds the opportunity to make their mark in Gotchiverse History with custom skinned Limited Edition Trophies\n\n\nGotchichain:\n\nWith the ability to process more than 2000 transactions per second, Gotchichain can provide a seamless and responsive gaming experience. This is why PC sees the potential for Strategotchi to launch with heavy support in Gotchichain's launch window\n\n\nBudget:\n\nWe are seeking 131,400 USD (GHST equivalent) paid in 2 installments.\nA 50% upfront payment of 65,700 USD to be transferred upon successful passing of a core prop. The subsequent 50% (65,700 USD) to be paid upon the successful completion of the single player mode MVP (based on DAO foundation members’ judgement)\n\n\n\n\nDeliverables:\n\n\nSeason 1 Guild Cards Distribution (GBM)\nSingle player mode (digital)\nMultiplayer mode (digital)\nInaugural Guild Tournament (precursor to Guild Waarz)\n\n\n\nCost Breakdown:\n\n\nDevelopment: 61,200 USD\n\nArt: 48,200 USD\n\nManagement: 22,000 USD\n\nTotal: 131,400 USD (GHST equivalent)\n\nOriginal budget: 87.6k GHST ($1.5/GHST)\n\nRoadmap + Budget:\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/strategotchi-roadmap-budget-proposal/4711\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\n\nWe believe this project has the potential to attract a new player base and expose the Aavegotchi IP to a new audience of strategy game enthusiasts, aligning it with the 2023 roadmap set out by PC, focusing on gaming and player growth.\n\nIt also serves our existing community by expanding utility of native assets as well as providing an engaging social experience involving Guild play, and pioneering the path for Guild vs. Guild competition.\n\nAs of today, I have achieved a verbal understanding with PC to have a limited licensing agreement extended to this project. Such a license will move into drafting and signatures only after the passage of this Sigprop. The agreement grants PC 20% of the revenue, and includes their support with smart contract development. (The remaining 80% is to be split evenly between player rewards and the DAO.)\n\nIt's important to emphasize that this grant is specifically for the digital version of the game, although plans for an official PC physical version are already being discussed. From my talks with the PC team, they are very enthusiastic about the idea and already have multiple manufacturing and distribution leads for the tabletop physical.\n\nWe are super excited and highly driven to emark on this ebic project, frens. With your support, Strata aims to establish itself as a reliable and valuable contributor to the ecosystem over the long haul. We are eager to have your backing and work together to transform our aspirations into a reality!",

      "content": "Author: Dr Wagmi (Dr Wagmi#6629)\n Gotchi ID: 16635\n Discourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/forge-2-0-proposal-discussion/4736\n \nProposal Summary:\n•\tHire the Forge Team for a 3-month period with an overall UI/UX focus\n•\tPlanned deliverables: full geode functionality with refilling of prize pool with at least 3 new schematics; respec potion completion and distribution; strong UI/UX focus with main website integration of the Dressing Room w/ similar art/RPG feel as offered by the Forge UI; major improvements to Forge UI/UX; operationalize a schematic pipeline for new schematic releases\n•\tNo plans for further core or alloy release in this period\n•\tGoal is for content to accrue value to native assets (gotchis, wearables) \n•\tBackgrounds, wearable skins, evolving pets and a new BRS-modifying slot will be tabled for further technical development. The Forge Team will prevent the most viable and community-favored project(s) for the next Forge installment.\n•\tCompensation is denominated in USD instead of GHST for a total of $161,825 for the Forge Team and a 10,000 GHST bounty budget\n \nThe Aavegotchi Forge Team proposes a 3 month contracted period of service to the Aavegotchi DAO to continue developing and improve features on the Aavegotchi protocol and User Interface. Over this three-month period, we plan to “stick the landing” for the Forge, add additional User Interface work w/ an integrated dressing room, and outline potential new features that can be pursued by the Forge Team or other design teams.\n \nA contracted three-month period allows the team to take on multiple projects simultaneously. It also allows our team the ability to provide rolling economic data, maintain and improve the UI, update the Core Framework document, and maximally engage the community. The Forge launch on 2/22 generated >$256,000 in total sales. We anticipate we will be able to continue to generate revenue without inflating cores or alloy and aim for budget neutrality or better while delivering new content, advancing the protocol, improving user experience, and providing value to native assets.\n \nForge Team Roadmap:\n•\tGeodes: Regardless of this proposal, the Forge team will debut the minimal viable Geode ASAP with function to obtain the 400 legendary Forge set schematics. As part of this proposal, the Forge Team will develop additional schematics for some of the unmatched cores from the Forge Launch auction. Plan to reload the prize pool by the end of April, ideally with multi-tier rarity functionality.\n•\tReview and complete the technical design and airdrop “Respec Potions”\n•\tUI Upgrade: Integrate the “Dressing Room” to the main Aavegotchi website. Create a dress-up and buy now option with new art, new NPC, and Aavegotchi aesthetic. Additionally, we will focus on overall UI/UX improvement with the goal of maximally educating users on protocol assets.\n•\tSchematic pipeline – Will operationalize new schematic creation with predictable schematic releases, randomized/fair trait selection, intentional approach to avoid power creep, and maximally assist in translating new wearables to Gotchiverse functionality\n•\tUpdates to wearables.report (market data reporting) site to account for new wearables mechanics:\n•\tAdd a dashboard of metrics related to The Forge (include reporting on two new mechanics developed by The Forge team)\n•\tUpdate existing metrics to account for changes in supply related to forging   \n•\tUI/UX improvements (mostly navigation related to accommodate additional content, with some minor aesthetic updates\n•\tBack-end code improvements to allow for modularity and expandability in the future\n \nFuture Project Outlines – Forge Team to investigate and prepare potential proposals for the following:\n•\tOutline and potentially implement the transition from FRENS to GLTR for raffle tickets\n•\tNew/Custom backgrounds – Develop a path for the community to design unique backgrounds and/or obtain Forge Team/Pixelcraft designed backgrounds\n•\tWearable skins/non-BRS-modifying wearables – Continue aesthetics focus by creating a path for wearable skins w/ goal to maximize community-created content.\n•\tNew BRS-modifying slot – Will be tabled for further economic and technical development for presentation to the DAO in Q3 2023\n•\tEvolving pets/Upgradeable wearables – Tabled for further technical development and separate proposal for the DAO, though it still may be implemented by the Forge Team during the 3-month period or beyond.\n \nForge Team Stipend:\nFor this work, diddly will be hired on as a full-time developer and responsible for all technical builds, solidity work and front-end management. This stipend for the Lead Developer role includes pay for extensive work performed in February-March 2023 to complete the Forge and to build the mobile user interface for a 4 month total stipend vs 3 months for the rest of the team. The three other roles will be part time ~20 hours/week. The 10,000 GHST bounty budget is to maximize external contributions and facilitate open contributions as much as possible.\n \nExecution Details:\n•\tThree disbursements in DAI from the DAO Treasury Wallet to the Forge Team Wallet which will be specified in the core proposal:\no   $61,825 upon passage of core proposal\no   $50,000 30 days after passage of core proposal\no   $50,000 60 days after passage of core proposal\n \nIn summary, we are requesting compensation for a dedicated 3-month period to form a devoted, highly skilled and proven team to continue developing the protocol. We strongly believe we will create more value than our asking cost as demonstrated by our previous success. We look forward to this period of exponential growth and helping the DAO continue its transition through the metamorphosis phase. \n-The Forge Team\n \n\n",

      "title": "External Proposal: Origin Protocol’s OUSD for Treasury Yield",
      "content": "Submitter: Dr Wagmi | Forge Team | Vault#6629\nAuthor: SlagathorTheMammothKing#7632\nGotchiID: 11146\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/external-proposal-origin-protocols-ousd-for-treasury-yield/4728\nVoting Options: Yes; No; Abstain\n\nThis is a proposal from Origin Protocol to convert $2m DAI of the 25% allocated to the DAO treasury from closing the curve into OUSD to generate passive yield for the Aavegotchi treasury.\n\nOUSD generates passive yield while sitting in a wallet, and is able to generate higher yields than using any single protocol strategy manually. Backed 1:1 by USDC, DAI, and USDT at all times; yield is paid out daily and automatically (sometimes multiple times per day) though a positive rebase in the form of additional OUSD, proportional to the amount of OUSD held. OUSD yield is currently ~5% APY, but it has ranged from as low as 4.08% APY and as high as 198.24% APY over the past month. OUSD yield comes from a combination of:\n\n- Lending collateral to Aave, Compound, Morpho, Curve, and Convex\n- Reward tokens (AAVE, COMP, CRV, and CVX) are automatically claimed and converted to stablecoin\n- A 25bip exit fee is charged to those who choose to exit OUSD via the dapp (completely avoidable if using DEX or CEX), this fee goes back to OUSD holders\n- OUSD sitting in non-upgradable contracts (more than half the OUSD in existence) does not rebase, instead the interest generated from those tokens is provided to those that can rebase\n\nThere are no lock-ups, terms, or conditions with OUSD; it’s completely non-custodial. Any web3 wallet should be able to support OUSD and its rebasing function, including hardware wallets and multi-sigs. There’s no need to ever again give up the keys to a 3rd party platform, such as Celsius, Blockfi, or FTX, to earn yield.\n\nBackground on Origin Protocol\n\nOrigin was founded by Web3 veterans Josh Fraser and Matthew Liu in 2017 and is one of the most venerable projects in the space. Josh and Matthew are joined by the fully doxxed Origin team and community, which includes hundreds of thousands of members and open-source contributors. Origin has raised $38.1M from top investors including Pantera, Spartan Group, Foundation Capital, BlockTower Capital, Steve Chen, Garry Tan, and Alexis Ohanian, and currently maintains a multimillion dollar treasury. As a technology partner, Origin Story, released in 2019, has helped launch some of the largest NFT projects to-date:\n\n- Paris Hilton Launches ‘Past Lives, New Beginnings’\n- 3LAU Launches Record-Setting $11.7M Auction\n- Charlie Bit My Finger NFT Sale Makes Headlines and Sets New Record\n- Macallan Cask NFT Sells For $2.3 Million\n- First Real Estate Sale via NFT Marketplace\n\nFor the full proposal, please view the discussion on the forum post, as well as the proposal comments.

      "title": "[Mechanic Change] -- Channel Alchemica through a -2 kinship burn",
      "content": "Title: Channel Alchemica through a -2 kinship burn\n\nSigprop Author(s): @Yanik_ai (Gotchi ID: 4751) @AL (Gotchi ID: #10504 – XP forgone as working group author)\nQuorum requirement: 9mn/20%\nVoting Options: Yes, Implement. ; No, Abandon Mechanic Change. ; Abstain\nBody:\n\nThis proposal re-attempts to change kinship mechanics so that kinship points are burned during each Gotchi channeling event. Current alchemica emission trajectories forecast an annual increase of 40% in supply due to persistent increases in Gotchi kinship multipliers at no cost to the player. The proposed change is a -2 kinship point burn per each gotchi channeling event. \n\nAdditionally, a new rental permission will also be added for Aavegotchis that will on default be set to “NO” to avoid player friction with accidental kinship burning. Players may toggle this feature to allow renters to channel their gotchis or keep it off to preserve kinship.\n\nSome benefits of this proposal:\nPlayers will immediately face trade-offs for how to use kinship. This translates to either burning it at the altar to produce resources, or preserving it for other Aavegotchi uses like rarity farming, future gotchiverse functions, or expenditure in other games.\n\nDevelops some standardization around spending kinship. Serves as a good foundation for future spending utility.\n\nThere is a timing impact of this proposal where future Gotchiverse developments should provide meaningful kinship buffs from Pixelcraft efforts or through use in other games.\n\nThe specific burn rate can be adjusted via DAO vote over time if needed. The bigger focus is just implementing the mechanic change.\n\nAlchemica emissions should lower as players opt to save points for kinship leaderboard ranking funded by the Aavegotchi protocol instead of spending them to expand their Gotchiverse assets. \n\nThe Graph of FUD emissions below shows the short and long-run effects of this proposal. Emissions reductions would be immediate and their impacts long-lasting if implemented. For example, after 1 year of implementation the emissions reductions is about -55% from the current trajectory & -20% reduction from a baseline of 0.\n\n![efsdf.png](ipfs://bafkreigktjisgcxvsdotljvqk5ca4dd4obfiuukzgzfzmd7vze3fnifva4)\n\nPotential Risks:\nPlayers with newly summoned, or low kinship gotchis will lose channeling abilities if they want their kinship to grow. A counter-argument is \nLess engagement with Aavegotchis due to expected loss of channeling activity.\nAdditional complexity. This mechanic opens the door for dynamic strategy, but also has potential to overwhelm newcomers.\n\nThis work was the result of several people’s efforts including, but not limited to @Yanik_AI as the original kinship burning author, Alchemica + GLTR Task Force, @Immaterial for the edits, and feedback from the discussions boards.

      "title": "DAO Directors : Treasury officer role",
      "content": "Author: Maxicrouton#1596\nGotchiID: 13306\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/dao-directors-officer-roles/4742\n\n\n***Hello frens !***\n\nWith the end of the curve, a substantial amount of funds has been given to the DAO. The directors have been discussing the importance of DAO officer roles for some time, and I believe it's crucial to start the process by appointing a treasurer for the DAO.\nDAO officer roles are important because sometimes directors' tasks go beyond signing transactions on DAO proposals. These roles help to further structure the DAO. That's why I am running for the position of treasurer.\n\n***The purpose of the treasurer role would be to:***\n\n- Ensure that all movement of funds asked to the DAO is completely clear, without missinterprertation possible.\n- Ensure that all movement of funds is smooth, swap contracts have sufficient funds, transfer of funds is done in a timely manner, etc.\n- Prepare a monthly summary of the DAO treasury that is accessible to all.\n- Stay informed about DAO proposals, ongoing funding, and the status of the treasury.\n\nAdditionally, the role would also serve as an \"expert\" role, advising directors on how to interact with smart contracts to minimize losses to the DAO.\n\nAs a current director, I receive a payment of 2,000 GHST every three months. Given the active nature of the treasurer role, I plan to dedicate two hours per day to this role and will be requesting an increase in compensation to 5,000 GHST per three months.\n\n***Why choose me?***\n\nI possess in-depth knowledge of DeFi and market making, enabling me to provide valuable advice on all financial decisions related to the DAO.\nI am well-versed in the DAO's structure and DAO fund locations. I think having a go-to person for all treasury matters can be helpful for the DAO.\nMy participation in the Curve transition team and in directors group allow me to be aware and understand every fund move.\n\n***Thank you for considering me for the treasurer role. ***",

A subsequent proposal will get posted in addition to any challenging proposals (highly encouraged). The DAO can vote on the offering(s) of their choice.\n\nThis part of the last proposal did not seem like a point of contention and would serve as a reasonable way to continue moving forward with the DAO on what they would like to see from Sunday DAO calls.\n\nJanuary, February and March payments total 4800 GHST\n\nTreasury Details:\n4800 GHST priced @ the time of Signal Proposal Snapshot (1.07 USD/GHST)\nTotal disbursement amount in USD: 5,136\n\nPaid out to 0xfD95Dea0f353618826d5FA94be862D9cb0d4dda8 within 48 hours of Core Proposal passing in either DAI or USDC\n",

These members proved to be critical to the great representation we had across all venues.\n\nKey performance metrics proved challenging to quantify, but there was a noticeable increase in Twitter and discord engagement, Bazaar activity, External and internal enthusiasm for Aavegotchi, and BD/partnership leads post-event.\n\nWhile the impact went far, we would like to fairly compensate all attending members at appropriate rates for the work done, and the initial budget set out for the event cannot accommodate that. Below is a complete breakdown of estimated vs actual hours, unforeseen expenses, preparation and long-tail labor (not taken into account), and finally, our request in USD terms.\n\nThis being our first IRL activation as AavegotchiDAO, we over-delivered and initially underestimated ourselves, and the current budget reflects that. As a team, we are coming away from this event with immense experience in planning future events.\n\nDeliverables\nThe team hit across all metrics in the initial proposal and then some. There was a noticeable increase in internal and external enthusiasm for the Aavegotchi protocol during our presence in Denver.\n\nEstimated hours vs actual\nThe original Estimate for a workday was:\n7 hours/day\n$15/hr\nTen days in total\n\nFinal Production Payout Structure was updated to:\n12 hours/day (reflective of actual hours from arriving and leaving main venues)\n$21/hr\nTen days in total for core event staff\nAdditional days allocated for long tail labor regarding prep and post-production\n\nUnforeseen Expenses\nCalvary team members' support; all who stepped up put in immense work and were critical to our mission. Most of them gave up their booth-browsing time to help us.\nSticker production costs were late-stage additions, but immense value adds in promoting Aavegotchi + creating awareness for Fake Gotchis.\nCrafting supplies for Marijuana mansion, Art Work Prints, and Framing\nAn extensive amount of driving for the vehicle team\n\nPreparation and long-tail labor\nWe genuinely undervalued and underestimated the work on the front and back end of EthDenver.\n\nFront end\nHefe & Mycaleum: Many hours were spent planning, scheduling, and working with event organizers to secure panel slots. We also put time into budget management and funding necessary travel expenses for team members while waiting for the initial funding proposal to clear.\n\nBack end\nNoFuturistic continues to work on post-event content editing and distribution.\nHefe & Mycaleum: We have been working on the budget with actual expenses as well as the distribution of costs and compensation. We also put lots of time into crafting this budget extension proposal.\nTBurd completed his photo album edits and uploading.\nSmokescreens is working on a b-roll for behind-the-scenes clips and footage.\nZombie Shepheard assisting with post-event media delivery and lead follow-up\nKontak has large content libraries to edit and share with NF for distribution.\nDr. Wagmi and Diddly have continuing BD discussions with project teams that met in Denver.\n\nFunding Request in USD\nThe initial funding proposal [AGIP 60] was $11,723, paid in GHST at delivery on February 11th, 2023.\n\nThe requested extension is $19,255 USD, paid in DAI.\n\nWe appreciate the continued support and look forward to future IRL activations with the Gotchigang!\n\nFunds should be sent to this Safe address as a single payment on Polygon: 0x376184461aaa5Bd445cd52924Fdf29e8E4b86900",

I hoped to find 8 members but ended up getting 10 amazing applications from some of the best minds and contributors in the community. These members have different types/sizes of holdings and different political/philosophical viewpoints to represent the diversity of our DAO as closely as possible. \n\nWe plan to split into vertical teams of 1-3 to work on ideas and come together on weekly public calls to collaborate and provide feedback. This means, as a taskforce, we will constantly be progressing 4-5 ideas in parallel. The projects we intend to start with are:\n\n- Kinship Channelling\n  - @Immaterial\n- GLTR emissions/sinks research\n  - @Maxicrouton\n  - @Webb\n  - @Umami\n- GLTR Raffles\n  - @soloegoist \n- Guild/District Tokenomics\n  - @HARDKOR \n  - @AL \n- New Alchemica/GLTR sinks ideation\n  - @Gotchinomics \n  - @kuwlness\n- Media work (weekly summary videos)\n  - @Nofuturistic\n\nWe are asking for funding for 5 hours of work per week at 25 GHST/hour for each of our members on a monthly rolling basis. This will make sure our community members are compensated for this important work and will keep them accountable to ensure that, as a DAO, we are constantly progressing our tokenomics.\n\nThe total funding for this month will be:\n10 members * 25 GHST/hour * 5 hour/week * 4 weeks = 5000 GHST\n\nAs we have already started work, the 4 weeks will run from 6th of March until 2nd April.\n\nFor further details on the taskforce, including our Vision, Mission and Values please check the forum thread.\n\nThank you for your votes, frens.",

      "content": "**Author:** Herro#4278\n**Gotchi ID:** 6626\n**Discord thread:** https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1091014164291530762\n\n**WHAT**\nProvide Aavegotchi community with Anata NFT's. I will also be writing a similar proposal in Anata DAO to provide Anata holders with Aavegotchi's. The Anata team would TWAP buy GHST and purchase Aavegotchi's / Portals on the marketplace for our holders to participate in the Gotchiverse.\n\n**ABOUT**\nAnata is a collection of 2,000 Anime Themed VTube rigged avatars. It is the NFT you use on calls, streams, meetings, etc. Each anata counts as one vote in Anata DAO. Anata is an art project heavily catered towards content creators. So far, the DAO has voted to provide every Anata NFT holder a 3D VRM, 1/1 PFP, Chibi, Upgraded 2D Vtuber Files, Gaming & Metaverse world integrations.\n\nHolders - 950\nActive Members - 100 (ish)\nTreasury - $4m+\nTeam - BigDSenpai, Grug, DCF God, Herro\n\n**WHY**\nI am a big believer in Aavegotchi. Some of you may remember I used to stream opening H1-H2 portals and giving away gotchi's at random to the community. I didn't have a Face Cam though - an Anata VTUBE avatar would have been perfect while playing - which makes chat and video way more interactive.\n\nAnata has a very large gaming sector, with gaming events & nights firing off 4-5 times per week. It would be great to intertwine what we are doing with Pudgy Penguins, Cozy Penguins and other communities with Aavegotchi games.\n\nTLDR; more exposure into the gotchiverse by helping eachother get community members involved in both projects.\n\n**COST**\nA) $10,000 DAI  (4-5 Anata)\nB) $20,000 DAI (9-11 Anata)\nC) Do Nothing\n\nAverage Anata price is .69-1ETH, the \"cost\" really depends on how much the DAO would want to give out to the community. I am all in favor of starting small if everyone else is.\n\nThe proposal would only be executed assuming the Anata DAO proposal with equal value passes. This is probably the best way to learn about Anata in under 2.5 minutes: https://twitter.com/AnataNFT/status/1625594906596249600\n\nVOD of Moon playing Gotchi Miners: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1779138941 \n\n![Screenshot of Twitch VOD](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1091014164291530762/1091014164492861545/Screenshot_2023-03-30_at_8.58.40_AM.png)\n",

I believe 2 months is appropriate. Not too long since the sooner we had liquidity the better it is for the DAO/ecosystem, and doing it in less than 2 months would dilute our own LM program.\n\nTechnical details for the DAO directors : \nDeploy a new \"swap contract\" (see AGIP 69) with the Liquidity wallet as owner.\nSwap 1M25$ DAI into USDC.

      "content": "Author: Hefe#1514\nGotchi ID: #1043 (GMIFrens.lens)\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\nDiscord thread: https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1084905113350570084/1084905113350570084\n\nThe 2023 Gotchi Lodge was a major success, with the Aavegotchi project being one of the best-represented projects at ETH Denver 2023.\n\nThe Lodge started with six core team members but quickly became Gotchi Hostel, accommodating seven Gotchigang cavalry members into the mix. These members proved to be critical to the great representation we had across all venues.\n\nKey performance metrics proved challenging to quantify, but there was a noticeable increase in Twitter and discord engagement, Bazaar activity, External and internal enthusiasm for Aavegotchi, and BD/partnership leads post-event.\n\nWhile the impact went far, we would like to fairly compensate all attending members at appropriate rates for the work done, and the initial budget set out for the event cannot accommodate that. Below is a complete breakdown of estimated vs actual hours, unforeseen expenses, preparation and long-tail labour (not taken into account), and finally, our request in USDC terms.\n\nThis being our first IRL activation as Aavegotchi DAO, we over-delivered and initially underestimated ourselves, and the current budget reflects that. As a team, we are coming away from this event with immense experience in planning future events.\n\nDeliverables\nThe team hit across all metrics in the initial proposal and then some. There was a noticeable increase in internal and external enthusiasm for the Aavegotchi protocol during our presence in Denver. \n\nEstimated hours vs actual\nThe original Estimate for a workday was:\n7 hours/day\n$15/hr\nTen days in total\n\nFinal Production Payout Structure was updated to:\n12 hours/day (reflective of actual hours from arriving and leaving main venues)\n$21/hr\nTen days in total for core event staff\nAdditional days allocated for long tail labour regarding prep and post-production\n\nUnforeseen Expenses\nCalvary team members' support; all who stepped up put in immense work and were critical to our mission. Most of them gave up their booth-browsing time to help us.\nSticker production costs were late-stage additions, but immense value adds in promoting Aavegotchi + creating awareness for Fake Gotchis.\nCrafting supplies for Marijuana mansion Art Work Prints and Framing\nAn extensive amount of driving for the vehicle team\n\nPreparation and long-tail labour\nWe genuinely undervalued and underestimated the work on the front and back end of EthDenver.\n\nFront end\nHefe & Mycaleum: Many hours were spent planning, scheduling, and working with event organizers to secure panel slots. We also put time into budget management and funding necessary travel expenses for team members while waiting for the initial funding proposal to clear.\n\nBack end\nNoFuturistic continues to work on post-event content editing and distribution.\nHefe & Mycaleum: We have been working on the budget with actual expenses as well as the distribution of costs and compensation. We also put lots of time into crafting this budget extension proposal.\nTBurd completed his photo album edits and uploading.\nSmokescreens is working on a b-roll for behind-the-scenes clips and footage.\nZombie Shepheard assisting with post-event media delivery and lead follow-up\nKontak has large content libraries to edit and share with NF for distribution.\nDr. Wagmi and Diddly have continuing BD discussions with project teams that met in Denver.\n\nFunding Request in USD\nThe initial funding proposal [AGIP 60] was $11,723, paid in GHST at delivery on February 11th, 2023.\n\nThe requested extension is $19,255 USD, paid in GHST.\n\nWe appreciate the continued support and look forward to future IRL activations with the Gotchigang!\n\nFunds should be sent to this Safe address as a single payment on Polygon: 0x376184461aaa5Bd445cd52924Fdf29e8E4b86900",

      "title": " Creating a Data Dashboard and Monthly Reports for Aavegotchi DAO Governance ",
      "content": "Author: mialalala#2321\nGotchiID: 10138\n\nDear fren,\nI’m Mialalala, a longstanding participant of the Aavegotchi community especially in Asian market. I am writing to express my delight at the recent developments within the community, particularly with the unveiling of the 2023 roadmap, which has ushered in a new era of vibrancy and growth.\n\nHowever, with the increase in community members and the decentralization of the entity, which will increase the complication of the operation and disclosure, I believe that it is now necessary to establish a DAO steward role to manage / disclose the treasury balance changes and governance data regularly. This will not only ensure transparency and accountability in the governance of the community but also provide a clear and concise entry point for new members to understand the DAO structure, including the treasury and governance.\n\nTherefore, I propose that we consider the creation of a DAO steward role, which will be responsible for overseeing the management of the treasury and promoting good governance practices within the community. This will enable us to build a more robust and sustainable Aavegotchi ecosystem that is better equipped to meet the needs of our growing community.\n\nWhat’re the responsibilities of the DAO steward team?\n\nThe DAO Steward Team will be responsible for the following:\n\n1- Building and operating the Aavegotchi DAO profile/Dashboard.\n\nAggregating basic information and social graphs, and converting them into a DAO profile.\nMapping the treasury addresses of the DAO and its associated parties, including sub-DAOs or DAO departments.\nAnalyzing the evaluation of the treasury assets, including fungible tokens (FT) and non-fungible tokens (NFT).\nTracking the inflow and outflow of assets.\nAggregating governance data, including proposals, voters, votes, and more.\nTracking the approved proposals and keeping a record of fund consumption\n2- Generating Monthly Treasury Report\n\nThe status-quo of the treasury assets including FT and NFTs (balance sheet)\nMonthly assets inflow and outflow\nThe Status-quo of governance (data about proposals/voters/votes; Approved proposals and rejected)\nFollow-up and feedbacks about the old approved proposals\nPublishing and sharing the report in Aavegotchi discord monthly\nAs one of the early members of Aavegotchi, we hope to support the team in their endeavors and make even greater contributions to the DAO. We are thrilled to see so many active DAO adopters and players in the community already. We believe that more and more fresh blood will contribute to DAO, and that such a community will become more and more dynamic and creative.\n\nWe hope that our contributions and plans, along with our request for a one-time grant of 7200 DAI and a monthly reward of 2500 DAI, will be considered. Grant can be issued all at once, while the monthly rewards can be released each month. To better test and verify our work, we propose a trial period of 6 months for the DAO Steward role.\n\nOur Team Structure:\n\nWe will apply for this position through the entity team called ThePASS, which is a senior team focused on DAO treasury and governance asset exploration and research. We will allocate the following personnel and roles:\n\n| Mialalala | Project Manager | Responsible for the DAO steward team |\n| Muneeb | FrontEnd |\n| Yung | BackEnd |\n| Lim | UI/UX Designer | Responsible for dashboard design and future report design |\n| Hakan | Content Writing | Responsible for drafting and polishing reports or other content |\n| Fengyun | Technology Content Writing | Responsible for talking with the DAO and team from tech side |\n| Di Kim | Data Engineering | Responsible for tracking the related data both about the treasury and governance |\n| Nina L / Saya Lin | Content Publishing / Socials | Responsible for the monthly report publishing and sharing|\n\nTo sum-up, I propose the establishment of a DAO steward role within the Aavegotchi community to manage the treasury balance changes regularly. This will promote good governance practices within the community and ensure transparency and accountability. As we continue to attract more participants, a DAO steward team will be responsible for building and operating the Aavegotchi DAO profile/Dashboard and generating a monthly treasury report.\n\nWe are excited to support the team in their endeavors and make even greater contributions to the DAO. With more fresh blood joining the community, we believe that the Aavegotchi ecosystem will become more dynamic and creative. Let’s work together to build a robust and sustainable community.\n\nMore information\n\nThe PASS is a DAO aggregator and treasury tracking platform. It helps build the reputation system for DAOs by aggregating the social graph (onchain+offchain) and track, analyze, and evaluate treasury assets including FT and NFT assets, giving the communities a better and more transparent way to dive deeper.

      "content": "**Author:** AL #4105\n**Gotchi ID:** 10504\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Discourse link:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/dao-curve-transition-team/4676\n\nSecuring Protocol Rewards – Operational & funding request\nCoreProp summary (important parts):\n\nBuyback schedule specifications for buying $GHST protocol rewards outlined in AGIP65. This includes consideration of a non-linear 18-month buying schedule with a 2-month long multiplier for purchase amounts to coincide with the liquidity mining plan, and the funding of an automated smart contract to execute purchases with various features. More details below:\n\nINTRO\n\nPer AGIP65 25% of the unlocked $DAI reserves from the retired Bonding Curve are supposed to be allocated for securing protocol rewards in the form of rarity farming rewards. To meet this goal, the CTT recommends internally developing operations standards for actually following through on this request.\n\n1) Protocol Rewards Purchasing Program:\n\nThe main aspects voters should consider in this proposal involve establishing a buying schedule for $GHST as well as how to best execute purchases for the DAO. \n\nFilling the rewards pool is proposed to start once the curve closes & operations are in place to buy $GHST, with a planned duration in mind of no more than 18 months to conclusion. We are also proposing that the DAO implement a non-linear approach to daily/weekly purchases.\n\nFor voters this would mean commitment to a 2-month long multiplier for every purchase, in line with the liquidity mining schedule outlined in AGIP67. We believe that this is the best way to quickly accumulate $GHST reserves and turn our stable assets into ecosystem rewards.\n\n \n![image.png](ipfs://bafkreigcejgcq3pxtxthdxaw3vont44bv5dtpxqokebbg5w7weuvzjx27y)\n\nIt is also recommended, but not proposed, to establish responsibilities within a long-term treasury management team for projection modeling to ensure that the DAO is closely following a buying schedule. There will be some aspects of maintenance in such a long-term program. \n\n2) Smart Contract\n\nThe proposed smart contract will ensure a secure environment for buying protocol rewards while ensuring Foundation users have the tools needed to buy protocol rewards in $GHST. \n\nThis proposed tool will be designed by CTT member @Bearded Gotchi Vault, and will undergo review by members @Sudeep, @MaxiCrouton and other critical members prior to implementation for production.\n\nThe expected contract deliverable will have the following features available for its DAO users:\n\n- Gelato automation tooling\n- Ability to choose purchasing between different DEX pools for best rate discovery\n- Adjusting the timing in between purchases & amounts of buybacks\n- Toggling for slippage rate tolerance\n- Automated reporting for accounting and proof of purchase\n\n+ potential for future iteration and optimization development through the DAO bounty program or other funding opportunities.\n\nFunding Request:\n\nWe are seeking a separate request of $5000 DAI (or $5000 worth of $GHST) to complete this contract as it will require ongoing maintenance and wasn’t anticipated in AGIP66 when the team was funded to conduct market research mainly.",

      "content": "**Author:** yanik | fireball ally\n**Gotchi ID:** 4751\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Discourse links:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/fireball-on-chain-guilds/4678?u=yanik\nhttps://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1074286012584435842/1074286012584435842\n**Funding Request:** 27,500 DAI\n**Development Time:** 4+ Months\n\n**Changes from SigProp:** The previous SigProp funding request was for 25,000 GHST. The funding request for this CoreProp is for 27,500 DAI (a fixed price of $1.10 per GHST from the previous funding request).\n\n---\n\n**BEGINNING**\n\nLast year, within the fireball.gg team we tried to imagine how guilds may look like in Aavegotchi. We deployed a guilds list page https://fireball.gg/guilds where players could group up and claim their spot as a guild inside the gotchiverse!\n\nTwenty one brave guild leaders with their guilds passed through github pull request quest and participated in this imaginary guild claim!\n\n \n![Untitled-_3_.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreidffz7iaiiomt2r2rt7we2g6mcts3dlkj6ma3mlisnqel3zua7hzy)\n\n \n![Untitled (4).jpg](ipfs://bafkreia4kh2doin2wnq6i7yjnasl5mehwyfmslmzxwnb6lelarvgx3csvu)\n\n---\n\n**NEXT STEPS** \n\nUsing all of our knowledge and insight, a new guild model was constructed, with given properties: \n\n- on chain solution based on https://app.safe.global/ makes it very convenient to pull all related guild stats\n- to participate there is no need to move any assets or any change in custody\n- guild warehouse (inventory) out of the box\n- name (flag) as non-transferable NFT\n- we teach our community how to best use the safe app!\n\n \n![Untitled (5).jpg](ipfs://bafkreieb2uxrcrzqqv42xca24mf5hbkbmsk5zbsrvjqbf7d7ttkymrpy3y)\n\nFrom a guild leader perspective the guild creation process would be something like: \n\n1. initiation transaction (deploy an empty gnosis safe)\n2. **claim a guild flag-name in registry contract**\n3. (optional) add members and other associated addresses\n4. (optional) set warehouse access rights\n\n---\n\n**DELIVERABLES**\n\nThe deliverables are separated in two stages (both are included within the current funding request): \n\nVersion 2 — core features needed to start building guilds within the community and integration with ecosystem projects (Gotchiverse, STRATEGOTCHI and possibly others) \n\nVersion 3 — a feasibility study for the experimental features based on data from the first two versions\n\n**Version 2:**\n\n(a) smart contract with the following capabilities: \n\n1. guild registration\n2. guild deletion \n3. guild name-flag as a non-transferable NFT\n\n(b) a custom data graph with a specific guilds and aavegotchi related stats:\n\n1. voting power\n2. assets (gotchis, wearables, land, etc)\n\n**Version 3**:\n\n(a) updates to the smart contract: \n\n1. guilds legacy — a historical NFT issued to remember historical events, like tournaments\n2. advanced guild warehouse access framework on https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-guard-scope/\n\n(b) guilds market\n\n(c) other needed features based on data from version 2\n\n---\n\n**BUDGET**\n\n(in DAI)\n\n- model, organization, integrations (ordengg) — 14,300\n- smart contract (PG) — 8,250\n- graph and data structures (ordengg) — 3,300\n- visual assets (FakeGotchis artists) — 1,650\n\n---\n\n**OWNERSHIP**\n\nAfter the guilds framework is stable we can:\n\n(a) transfer registry to the dao\n\n(b) deploy a new guild registry system to and from the dao which will effectively give us the “Official Aavegotchi Guilds”! \n\n---\n\n**TIMELINE**\n\nVersion 2 — April-May \n\nVersion 3 — June-July\n\n---\n\n**INTEGRATIONS**\n\nHaving guilds makes pvp, farming and development much more interesting! The fireball.gg team has agreements in place to test new guild mechanics with other Aavegotchi sponsored projects: \n\n1. integration with https://gotchiboard.com/ will open a road for guild specific tournaments!\n\n2. Integration with STRATEGOTCHI will help with guilds registrations and leaderboards data.\n\n---\n\n**FAQ**\n\nQ: If I already have a complicated custody structure, do I need to move assets?\nA: No! All you need to do is to simply add all your members addresses as guild members (safe owners)\n\nQ: Can I delete my guild?\nA: Yes, simply fire the flag(nft) removal function!\n\nQ: Can Version 2 be funded first?\nA: Versions here are for only workflow structure: (a) deploy a product, (b) analyse the data from real usage (c) improve the product ",

      "title": "Alchemica + GLTR Economic Taskforce funding",
      "content": "Author: Immaterial#0001\nGotchiID: 16559\n\nHello frens,\n\nI've spent the last couple of weeks recruiting a diverse taskforce to generate ideas, conduct research and create sig props for our Alchemica + GLTR tokenomics. I hoped to find 8 members but ended up getting 10 amazing applications from some of the best minds and contributors in the community. These members have different types/sizes of holdings and different political/philosophical viewpoints to represent the diversity of our DAO as closely as possible. \n\nWe plan to split into vertical teams of 1-3 to work on ideas and come together on weekly public calls to collaborate and provide feedback. This means, as a taskforce, we will constantly be progressing 4-5 ideas in parallel. The projects we intend to start with are:\n\n- Kinship Channelling\n  - @Immaterial\n- GLTR emissions/sinks research\n  - @Maxicrouton\n  - @Webb\n  - @Umami\n- GLTR Raffles\n  - @soloegoist \n- Guild/District Tokenomics\n  - @HARDKOR \n  - @AL \n- New Alchemica/GLTR sinks ideation\n  - @Gotchinomics \n  - @kuwlness\n- Media work (weekly summary videos)\n  - @Nofuturistic\n\nWe are asking for funding for 5 hours of work per week at 25 GHST/hour for each of our members on a monthly rolling basis. This will make sure our community members are compensated for this important work and will keep them accountable to ensure that, as a DAO, we are constantly progressing our tokenomics.\n\nThe total funding for this month will be:\n10 members * 25 GHST/hour * 5 hour/week * 4 weeks = 5000 GHST\n\nAs we have already started work, the 4 weeks will run from 6th of March until 2nd April.\n\nFor further details on the taskforce, including our Vision, Mission and Values please check the forum thread.\n\nThank you for your votes frens.",

      "content": "Author: AL #4105\nGotchi ID: (#10504)\nSecuring Protocol Rewards – Operational & funding request\nSigprop summary (important parts):\n\nBuyback schedule specifications for buying $GHST protocol rewards outlined in AGIP65. This includes consideration of a non-linear 18-month buying schedule with a 2-month long multiplier for purchase amounts to coincide with the liquidity mining plan, and the funding of an automated smart contract to execute purchases with various features. More details below:\n\nINTRO\n\nPer AGIP65 25% of the unlocked $DAI reserves from the retired Bonding Curve are supposed to be allocated for securing protocol rewards in the form of rarity farming rewards. To meet this goal, the CTT recommends internally developing operations standards for actually following through on this request.\n\n1) Protocol Rewards Purchasing Program:\n\nThe main aspects voters should consider in this proposal involve establishing a buying schedule for $GHST as well as how to best execute purchases for the DAO. \n\nFilling the rewards pool is proposed to start once the curve closes & operations are in place to buy $GHST, with a planned duration in mind of no more than 18 months to conclusion. We are also proposing that the DAO implement a non-linear approach to daily/weekly purchases.\n\nFor voters this would mean commitment to a 2-month long multiplier for every purchase, in line with the liquidity mining schedule outlined in AGIP67. We believe that this is the best way to quickly accumulate $GHST reserves and turn our stable assets into ecosystem rewards. \n\nIt is also recommended, but not proposed, to establish responsibilities within a long-term treasury management team for projection modeling to ensure that the DAO is closely following a buying schedule. There will be some aspects of maintenance in such a long-term program. \n\n2) Smart Contract\n\nThe proposed smart contract will ensure a secure environment for buying protocol rewards while ensuring Foundation users have the tools needed to buy protocol rewards in $GHST. \n\nThis proposed tool will be designed by CTT member @Bearded Gotchi Vault, and will undergo review by members @Sudeep, @MaxiCrouton and other critical members prior to implementation for production.\n\nThe expected contract deliverable will have the following features available for its DAO users:\n\n- Gelato automation tooling\n- Ability to choose purchasing between different DEX pools for best rate discovery\n- Adjusting the timing in between purchases & amounts of buybacks\n- Toggling for slippage rate tolerance\n- Automated reporting for accounting and proof of purchase\n\n+ potential for future iteration and optimization development through the DAO bounty program or other funding opportunities.\n\nFunding Request:\n\nWe are seeking a separate request of $5000 DAI (or $5000 worth of $GHST) to complete this contract as it will require ongoing maintenance and wasn’t anticipated in AGIP66 when the team was funded to conduct market research mainly.",

      "title": "[AGIP 67] Curve Transition Plan - Securing funds for liquidity",
      "content": "**Author:** Maxicrouton#1596\n**GotchiID:** 24877\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/dao-curve-transition-team/4676\n\n**Important note:** Currently there is $38M of DAI in the curve contract, 30% more than when sigprop went live, so we are asking for a bit more funds than in sigprop ($4M increased to $5M). This increase allows us to increase the liquidity on the DEXs a little more and not end up with cash intended for liquidity that would end up lying idle.\n\nHello Frens!\n\nThe core proposal to close the curve is in progress and the vote for a 25/25/25/25% split is likely to pass.\nOne of these 25% was voted by the DAO to be used as liquidity to allow new entrants not to suffer from high slippage and to have a nice and smooth price discovery.\n\nAt the moment the liquidity on the DEX is quite low. We have about $2 million in liquidity in the GHST-USDC Quickswap pool and we can assume that if we do nothing it will drop drastically because the 8% APY coming from the GLTR is not enough incentive compared to the impermanent loss risks when the curve will close.\n\nThe liquidity provision will be split in 2 plans: \n - Pre-curve plan: Ensure high liquidity for the curve transition. \n - Post-curve plan: Buyback (protocol rewards), DAO treasury management, liquidity reallocations after price discovery.\n\nIn the sigprop we had asked to secure $4M for the pre-curve plan while having fairly approximate plans, so after discussions with Balancer and Quickswap we are coming back with a more detailed plan.\n\nThis core-prop only discusses the pre-curve plan to ensure liquidity on DEXs.\n\nWe have a liquidity target of around $5M+, as this could allow new entrants to trade $50,000 with less than 2% slippage.\n\nPRE-CURVE PLAN:\nDEXs: Quickswap and Balancer.\n\nBALANCER LIQUIDITY PROVISION : \n\nWe have a maximum of 957,000 DAI available in the DAO treasury pre-curve closure (1.067M DAI - FArmy's 110k). \n\nTo add DAO liquidity, we chose an 80(GHST)-20(Stable) type pool. Since we have a lot more GHST than DAI in the treasury, this type of pool looks quite interesting. \n\nTo use 950k DAI in the Balancer pool we would need to match it with the following amounts of GHST if valued at 1.50:\n\n80-20 pool: 2560000 GHST (4,750,000$ pool total)\n\nThis liquidity injection must occur 3 days before the close of the curve.\nBribes program: \n\nIt is possible for the DAO to deploy 6M DAI (this number depends on the number of DAI at the close of the curve) on Balancer and earn 5% (~300k annual) + 5-6% BAL rewards. (For the rest of the calculation we will take the worst case: 5% APY total on the DAI => 300k$/year)\n\nThen we can use the 300k+ in DAI rewards to bribe the 80-20 GHST-STABLE pool, giving the DAO more rewards. This allows us to yield on our treasury and not let it sleep without yield.\n\nBribes are done via Snapshot, which will require regular participation between our Snapshot DAO and Balancer.\n\nQUICKSWAP V3 LIQUIDITY MINING PROGRAM : \n\nTo achieve the liquidity target, we believe that a liquidity mining (LM) program in addition to the direct provision of liquidity by the DAO is worthwhile.\n\nWe are targeting $3M+ in external liquidity from this program. We believe that an APR of 50% for 2 months would be enough to incentivize the liquidity provider. This would require 160,000 GHST in LM rewards. The GHST must stay above $4 for the LM program to be cheaper than the IL incurred for the DAO. This liquidity mining program must begin 3 days before the curve closes and last for 2 months.\n\nWe expect between 10% and 20% of the GHST amount in Quick rewards from Quickswap team for the liquidity mining rewards on their V3 (full range liquidity). \nFor technical reasons, we cannot add all these rewards to the existing GLTR staking contract. So liquidity providers will have to choose between the GLTR rewards and the GHST + Quick rewards.\n\nSo, to summarize, we are asking the DAO to add 2,560,000 GHST with the 957,000 DAI available in the DAO treasury to a 80-20 Balancer pool. This pool will be bribed by the DAO through treasury management thereafter.\n\nThis provision of liquidity by the DAO will allow the DAO to earn swap fees and BAL rewards thus obtaining more cash flow.\nIn addition to these numbers, we are asking the DAO to sponsor a Quickswap LM program with 160,000 GHST.\n\nDoing a liquidity program can be smarter in high volatility times because a 50-50 pool is very prone to impermanent losses, and we prefer incentive liquidity rather than having the DAO lose money through IL.",

      "title": "[AGIP 66] Form and Fund the Curve Transition Team",
      "content": "**Authors:** Dr Wagmi (Dr Wagmi#6629)\n**GotchiID:** 16635\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Discourse thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/dao-curve-transition-team/4676\n\nWe propose the formation of a DAO Curve Transition Team (CTT) to assist the DAO in managing liquidity and treasury on a contingent basis prior to and after turning off the GHST curve should the DAO consent. We have numerous problems to tackle which need thoughtful investigation. The CTT will provide detailed summaries and analysis of our current state and potential paths moving forward regarding liquidity and asset management. These are some of the main questions the CTT will address and provide potential paths and analyses for DAO consideration:\n \nRegarding liquidity:\nShould current treasury assets be used to provide liquidity prior to the curve being turned off?\n If so, how much? What wallet will hold these LP tokens? Will that liquidity remain after the curve DAI is distributed? Should the DAO stake those LP tokens for GLTR?\nShould the DAO keep GHST-USDC as the primary liquidity pool? If supporting any secondary pools, where do we diversify out? \nWhat is our goal amount of decentralized liquidity?\nHow does this compare to current liquidity? How fast should we seek to establish our goal amount?\nWhat are potential estimations for impermanent loss with different potential trajectories for GHST?\nShould we turn off GLTR rewards for amGHST and move them elsewhere?\n\nRegarding treasury management:\nWhat are our operations for treasury management?\nWhat wallet is holding the funds?\nIs our operational security process adequate?\nAre we keeping funds in DAI or moving to alternative assets?\nWhat other stablecoins would we consider?\nWhat other crypto assets would we consider? ETH, BTC, MATIC? On what chain?\nWhat DeFi protocols should we consider for treasury management?\nWhich ones should we meet with and what liquidity mining rewards should we aim for?\nShould we perform GHST buybacks? If so, how? What are the potential impacts and costs of such a strategy at different liquidity targets?\nWhat should be done with interest earned? GHST buybacks? Compounding into the asset earning interest?\n\nTo answer the above questions with sufficient market research, we propose a 10,000 GHST bounty. We aim to provide the DAO a complete analysis within 3 weeks with multiple potential paths for consideration. Efficient treasury management will provide yield to keep our operations sustainable while also directing liquidity to ensure decentralized access to our core product.\n",

      "title": "The Forge Team Contract and Six-Month Roadmap",
      "content": "Author: Dr Wagmi (Dr Wagmi#6629)\nGotchi ID: 16635\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/introducing-evolving-pets/4639\n\nWe, The Aavegotchi Forge Team, propose a 6 month contracted period of service to the Aavegotchi DAO to continue developing features on the Aavegotchi protocol. We have worked diligently since October to deliver the Forge with intensive ideation, economics development, art creation, DAO navigation, smart contract execution, and user interface work. We have set the stage to continue to build features that will add value to native assets and increase engagement. Over this six month period, we plan to launch at least 4 new features while maintaining and improving the initial Forge launch, economics, and user experience.\n\nA contracted six-month period allows the team to take on multiple projects simultaneously. It also allows our team the ability to provide rolling economic data, maintain and improve the UI, update the Core Framework document, and maximally engage the community. The Forge launch on 2/22 will likely generate enough GHST revenue to have paid for itself, but, more importantly, creates a path towards sustainable revenue without dilution through schematics. It also creates opportunities to create new content that accrues value into our native assets. \n\nForge Team Roadmap: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lPdoyLvupwg7jKSoaUbX6PWOzttteyrF/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100550936649233683179&rtpof=true&sd=true\n-\tEvolving pets/Upgradeable wearables – obtain upgraded schematics by engagement and through “feeding” tokens or assets to the pet\n-\tCustom backgrounds – Develop a path for the community to design unique backgrounds\n-\tNew BRS-modifying slot – Create a new slot, ensure value accrual to native assets, maximize engagement, and provide new metas for future rarity farming iterations\n-\tSchematic sales – Plan for quarterly release of new schematics and maintenance of the Core Framework document. There are no current plans for additional core releases prior to review.\n-\tOther potential ideas that can be pursued: non-brs modifying wearables, “skins” for existing wearables, gems obtained by smelting or from land parcels with boosts.\n\nForge Team Stipend:\nFor this work, diddly will be hired on as a full time developer and responsible for all technical builds, solidity work and front-end management. This stipend for the Lead Developer role includes pay for extensive work performed in February 2023 to complete the Forge and to build the mobile user interface for a 7 month total stipend vs 6 months for the rest of the team. The three other roles will be part time ~20 hours/week. My role as Lead is detailed in the link below with an expected 25-30 hours/week of work as team lead with overlapping responsibilities in business development and promotion of Forge growth. The 16,000 GHST bounty budget is to maximize external contributions and facilitate open contributions as much as possible. \n\n6-month stipend (GHST)\nChair:\t                    Dr Wagmi   50,000\nLead Economist\tMikeyJay\t19,000\nLead Developer\tDiddly\t    115,000\nLead Creative:   \tOliver         36,000\n\t\t\nTeam Salary Total\t\t220,000\nBounty Budget\t\t16,000\n\t\t\nTotal\t\t236,000 GHST\n\nForge Team Chair Role: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g2enTK6enYpMZdnwVh634jRwnP0nVjXV/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100550936649233683179&rtpof=true&sd=true\n\nIn summary, we are requesting 236,000 GHST to form a devoted, highly skilled and proven team to continue developing the protocol and product. We strongly believe we will create more value than our asking cost. We look forward to this period of exponential growth and helping the DAO continue its transition through the metamorphosis phase.\n\nThe Forge Team\n",

      "content": "**Coreprop to split the post-Curve DAI into four equal allocations**\n\nAuthor: Immaterial#0001, Fantasma#1777\nGotchiID: 16559, 2824\n\nHello frens,\n\nWe would like to put forward our own proposal that we believe is the fairest way to allocate the funds whilst also protecting asset holders. We believe that the 4 pillars of the Aavegotchi ecosystem are: Liquidity, The DAO, Pixelcraft and Asset holders. Therefore, our proposal is to allocate the curve funds evenly between these 4 pillars and making sure asset holders are not left behind by allocating them 25% of the DAI for Protocol Rewards which will directly reward asset holders through either Rarity Farming, or another reward mechanism chosen by the DAO.\n\nThe split would be as follows:\n\nLiquidity: 25%\nThe DAO: 25%\nPixelcraft: 25%\nProtocol rewards: 25%\n\nBy protocol rewards, we mean fair and inclusive reward pools that account for all native assets in the protocol. A yes vote for protocol rewards in this case does not mean a yes vote for ongoing RF in its current iteration, it protects funds to be used to make sure that protocol assets remain liquid and sufficiently included in the economic cycle/paradigm going forward.\n\nA yes vote for protocol rewards signals to loyal supporters of the protocol that the original vision remains intact, rather than being diverted into new and unproven games and business models.\n\nWithout inclusion/correlation between GHST and assets, great economic disruption could follow the turning off of curve for asset owners. A stream of funding protocol rewards for two years not only creates an ongoing source of buy side liquidity for the GHST token, it also allows market participants to trust in the correlation between GHST and protocol assets.\n\nAs we prepare to release the Forge and GBM different assets, we have the choice to signal to market participants whether they are bidding into a single RF season, or towards inclusion in the economic benefits of the platform for a full two years from here.\n\nThank you frens for your vote. For further discussion please head over to the forum thread linked below.\n",

      "title": "[AGIP 64] Close the GHST Bonding Curve",
      "content": "**CoreProp to Turn off the GHST Bonding Curve**\n\nAuthor: Jesse | gldnXross#6482\nGotchiID: 4563\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\n\nFinal Discourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/alternate-proposal-for-post-curve-allocation/4668\n\nOriginal Discourse Thread:\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/proposal-to-close-the-ghst-bonding-curve-and-allocate-curve-s-collateral/4628\n\nINTRODUCTION\nAavegotchiDAO was summoned as a 100% on-chain DAO in September 2020 via the deployment of the GHST Bonding Curve. This proposal is based on a diligent risk assessment of the Curve and concludes that there is a strong case for closing the GHST Bonding Curve and freeing GHST from reliance on MakerDAO’s DAI stable coin.\n\nClosing the Curve in effect concludes a 2.5+ year DAICO (DAO+ICO) token sale. All DAI in the GHST Bonding Curve at the time of closing will transform the DAI from being half of a simple liquidity pool into actual Aavegotchi funding. A second Signal Proposal follows this one proposing a 30/30/40 split of the DAI for the founding team at Pixelcraft Studios, AavegotchiDAO treasury, and an additional 40% for the DAO that is explicitly earmarked for liquidity provisions.\n\nThe Problem: Unnecessary Risk Underpins Aavegotchi Today\n“The Curve is forever” is a shorthand way of expressing how reliable GHST’s tokenomics have been up to this point. However, starting in 2022 turbulence in the macro crypto space has been growing, and our beloved bonding curve is potentially at risk of contagion.\n\nWhile MakerDAO, the issuers of DAI, have delivered a stable stablecoin up to this point (DAI has never had a significant depeg from the USD) there is no guarantee that such success will continue indefinitely. Recent red flags include an inability for MakerDAO to remove the GUSD vault (a stablecoin issued by the recently bankrupt Genesis), the “Endgame” plan to depeg DAI from USD, growing exposure to real-world-assets (RWA) fraught with counterparty risk, and a general overexposure to (and vulnerability of) the USDC stablecoin in the MakerDAO asset pool.\n\nEven if one concludes that DAI’s risk is only low to moderate, we must soberly assess whether such risk tolerance is acceptable to our DAO. Today, I put forth that not only is any risk from DAI’s depeg unacceptable, but such risk is also entirely avoidable.\n\nAavegotchi Is Ready to Secure Funds On Our Own\nAavegotchiDAO has already demonstrated that it can manage its own treasury. Likewise, two plus years of Pixelcraft Studios flawlessly managing all significant ecosystem multisigs and upgradeable contracts underscores the company’s readiness to also manage the DAI at scale.\n\nWith nearly 20M DAI in the curve, there is sufficient funding to continue development and enable deep liquidity at the same time. The Curve was KYC’d and never accessible to a large swath of Aavegotchi fans. Under this proposal, GHST with good liquidity would actually become more accessible to more people!\n\nIt is along this backdrop of benefits including derisking, securing funding, and improving GHST accessibility that I propose closing the GHST Bonding Curve.\n\nAllocation of the Curve’s DAI\nTurning off the Curve is an opportunity to not only derisk from reliance on MakerDAO, but also secure significant funding for our ecosystems.\n\nSo far, the DAI in the Curve’s contracts has only served one purpose: to provide liquidity for the creation and destruction of GHST tokens. After the Curve’s closure, whatever DAI remains in that contract will be freed to go to work on behalf of the Aavegotchi protocol.\n\nMy originally paired Signal Proposal regarding allocation of DAI was voted down. However, another Signal Proposal written by Immaterial and Fantasma has passed with over 80% support. Titled “25/25/25/25 split for curve DAI”, that SigProp will be upgraded to CoreProp shortly after the publishing of this proposal you are now reading. \n\nIF the 25/25/25/25 CoreProp passes alongside this proposal to close the curve, then DAI post-Curve closure shall be allocated in accordance with it. \n\nIF the 25/25/25/25 CoreProp does not pass, but this proposal to close the curve does pass,  Curve’s on-chain vote on Aragon will not happen until a new CoreProp regarding DAI allocation is passed. \n\nProcess:\nAssuming both CoreProps pass, the process for our community to close the GHST Bonding Curve will happen in a controlled, methodical way by following these steps:\n\nSunday, Feb 26\nThis CoreProp and a DAI distribution CoreProp must both pass in order to confirm AavegotchiDAO’s intention and terms. If passed, the Aragon on-chain vote to close the GHST Bonding Curve begins in the days following shortly after. \n\n*Achieving quorum on our on-chain vote requires 8% of total GHST supply to participate. That means GHST holders need to coordinate migrating GHST back to Ethereum between now and the vote so that we can honor the AGIP and successfully close the Curve. \n\nIF Aragon vote successfully closes the Curve:\nThe Curve will immediately close, capping the supply of GHST. Any DAI collateral shall be transferred to all multisig wallets in accordance with the terms of the 25/25/25/25 AGIP. \n\nRisks\nThe risks of closing the Curve mostly are technical in nature. Pixelcraft Studios has already had our Solidity team spend time simulating the process for closing the Curve and how that would work. Everything worked as designed. The majority of risk is in the moments after the Curve closes.\n\nWithout deep liquidity and a spike in outside entities speculating, we may see dramatic volatility in the GHST market. \n\nThere is also a greater-than-zero risk for the new multisig wallets tasked with securing the DAI. With proper planning and for the reasons noted above, we believe that AavegotchiDAO is capable of this responsibility.\n\nBenefits\nThe benefits and reasoning for this are already well fleshed out above but to briefly review:\n\nRemove all risk of Aavegotchi’s success relying on an outside party (MakerDAO and DAI)\n\nComplete the GHST continuous token sale, securing funding for both AavegotchiDAO and Pixelcraft Studios, thus enabling bigger, better, faster, stronger development for both parties.\n\nImprove GHST tokenomics, especially in terms of accessibility. As opposed to having most liquidity locked into a KYC-walled liquidity pool, AavegotchiDAO will be able to dynamically direct liquidity to the platforms that make the most sense at any given time.\n\nConclusion\nFor the benefits noted above, I am proposing that now is the time to meet the moment and make this significant change to the Aavegotchi ecosystem’s meta. The status quo is simply unacceptable as the risk of doing nothing cannot be justified. Together we have weathered a brutal bear market in 2022 and now have an opportunity to prove we’ve learned lessons from watching seemingly invincible players in the space fall. Securing significant funding that is rightfully raised also makes a lot of sense given where we are as a protocol. The vision is too great for small budgets especially when the option to close the token sale and allocate those funds to the vision’s development is completely within AavegotchiDAO’s control.\n\nWe are in a completely unique situation where we can self-fund on a scale envious of our competitors, all while completely derisking from our current reliance on DAI tokens. Let's use this opportunity as a rallying cry to come together and level up as the completely independent, self sustaining AavegotchiDAO.",

      "content": "**Author:** yanik | fireball ally \n\n**Gotchi ID:** 4751\n\nFunding request: 25’000 GHST \n\nDevelopment time: 4+ month \n\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n\n**Discourse links:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/fireball-on-chain-guilds/4678?u=yanik \nhttps://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1074286012584435842/1074286012584435842  \n\n---\n\n**BEGINNING**\n\nLast year, within the fireball.gg team we tried to imagine how guilds may look like in aavegotchi. We deployed a guilds list page [https://fireball.gg/guilds](https://fireball.gg/guilds) where players could group up and claim their spot as a guild inside the gotchiverse! \n\nTwenty one brave guild leaders with their guilds passed through github pull request quest and participated in this imaginary guild claim!\n\n![Untitled](https://fireball-gg.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F6603a471-1883-4dc1-bbbb-fca76c47778a%2FUntitled.png?id=5df660e2-36c0-4e53-a12f-12be243c9eac&table=block&spaceId=0370fbe1-10fb-4daa-b752-6e470d5904b4&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n![Untitled](https://fireball-gg.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fb3ef4a28-6754-45c8-a382-69bb8033293b%2FUntitled.png?id=ca5de8f0-ae2e-49d9-b621-d733871bf954&table=block&spaceId=0370fbe1-10fb-4daa-b752-6e470d5904b4&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n---\n\n**NEXT STEPS** \n\nGiving all our knowledge and insight, a new guild model was constructed, with a given properties: \n\n- on chain solution based on [https://app.safe.global/](https://app.safe.global/) makes it very convenient to pull all related guild stats\n- to participate there is no need to move any assets or any change in custody\n- guild warehouse (inventory) out of the box\n- name (flag) as non-transferable NFT\n- we teach our community how to best use of safe app!\n\n![Untitled](https://fireball-gg.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F9e1a8b11-5a70-45de-92be-9e1151412a08%2FUntitled.png?id=9c929aec-0e98-462c-8eae-77cb9893af7c&table=block&spaceId=0370fbe1-10fb-4daa-b752-6e470d5904b4&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)\n\nfrom a guild leader perspective the guild creation process would be something like: \n\n1. initiation transaction (deploy an empty gnosis safe)\n2. **claim a guild flag-name in registry contract**\n3. (optional) add members and other associated addresses\n4. (optional) set warehouse access rights\n\n---\n\n**DELIVERABLES**\n\nThe deliverables are separated in two stages (both are included within the current funding request): \n\nversion 2 — core features needed to start building guilds within the community and integration with ecosystem projects (gotchiverse, STRATEGOTCHI and possibly other) \n\nversion 3 — a feasibility study for the experimental features based on data from the first two versions\n\n**version 2:**\n\n(a) smart contract with the following capabilities: \n\n1. guild registration\n2. guild deletion \n3. guild name-flag as a non-transferable NFT\n\n(b) a custom data graph with a specific guilds and aavegotchi related stats:\n\n1. voting power\n2. assets (gotchis, wearables, land, etc)\n \n\n**version 3**: \n\n(a) updates to the smart contract: \n\n1. guilds legacy — a historical NFT issued to remember historical events, like tournaments\n2. advanced guild warehouse access framework on https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-guard-scope/\n\n(b) guilds market\n\n(c) other needed features based on data from version 2 \n\n---\n\n**BUDGET**\n\n(in GHST)\n\n- model, organisation, integrations (ordengg) — 13000\n- smart contract (PG) — 7500\n- graph and data structures (ordengg) — 3000\n- visual assets (fakeGotchi artists) — 1500\n\n---\n\n**OWNERSHIP**\n\nAfter guilds framework will be stable we can:\n\n(a) transfer registry to the dao\n\n(b) deploy a new guild registry system to and from the dao which will effectively give us the “Official Aavegotchi Guilds”! \n\n---\n\n**TIMELINE**\n\nversion 2 — April-May \n\nversion 3 — June-July\n\n---\n\n**INTEGRATIONS**\n\nHaving guilds makes pvp, farming and development much more interesting! Fireball.gg team has agreements in place to test new guild mechanics with other Aavegotchi sponsored projects: \n\n1. integration with [https://gotchiboard.com/](https://gotchiboard.com/) will open a road for guild specific tournaments!\n\n2. integration with STRATEGOTCHI will help with guilds registrations and leaderboards data. \n\n---\n\n**FAQ**\n\nQ: If I already have a complicated custody structure, do I need to move assets?\nA: No! All you need to do is to simply add all your members addresses as guild members (safe owners)\n\nQ: can I delete my guild?\nA: yes, simply fire the flag(nft) removal function!\n\nQ: can version 2 to be funded first?\nA: versions here are for only workflow structure: (a) deploy a product, (b) analyse the data from real usage (c) improve the product",

      "title": "Curve Transition Plan - Securing funds for liquidity",
      "content": "Author: Maxicrouton#1596\nGotchiID: 24877\n\nDiscourse links: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/dao-curve-transition-team/4676\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nHello Frens !\n\nThe proposal to close the curve is in progress and the vote for a 25/25/25/25% split is likely to pass.\nOne of these 25% was voted by the DAO to be used as liquidity to allow new entrants not to suffer from high slippage and to have a nice and smooth price discovery.\n\nAt the moment the liquidity on the DEX is quite low. We have about $2 million in liquidity in the GHST-USDC Quickswap pool and we can assume that if we do nothing it will drop drastically because the 8% APY coming from the GLTR is not enough incentive compared to the risks impermanent loss when the curve will close.\n\nWe have a liquidity target of around $5 million, as this could allow new entrants to trade $50,000 with less than 2% slippage.\n\nLIQUIDITY PROVISION\nTogether with the curve transition team, we would like to secure enough funds that will serve directly as liquidity to DEXs. We are thinking of two DEXs: Quickswap and Balancer, we are in discussions to secure rewards from these projects.\nWe have a maximum of 957,000 DAI available in the DAO treasury pre-curve closure (1.067M DAI - FArmy's 110k). \nTo add the liquidity, we thought of 3 types of pool, either Balancer pools with pools of type 80(GHST)-20(Stable) or 75(GHST)-25(Stable), or usual pool type 50-50. Since we have a lot more GHST than DAI in the treasury, the Balancer pool looks quite interesting because it would allow the DAO to provide more than $2M worth of liquidity pre-closure.\nIf we were to use 950k DAI in a weighted balancer pool we would need to match it with the following amounts of GHST if valued at 1.30:\n75-25 pool: 2,192,000 (3,800,000$ pool total)\n80-20 pool: 2,923,000 (4,750,000$ pool total)\n50-50 pool: 736,000 (1,900,000$ pool total)\n\nLIQUIDITY MINING PROGRAM\nTo achieve the $5M liquidity target, we believe that a possible option could be a liquidity mining (LM) program in addition to the direct provision of liquidity by the DAO. \nHere is a chart of LM reward costs. The X-axis is clusters of different target APRs for different amounts of goal external liquidity provision. The Y-axis is the LM reward expense.\n\n \n![lM1.png](ipfs://bafkreiac757d5nx7qwm4qjlp53czcoi2dyz6gjwms2qy3kgmtvs2jhiqlm)\n    \n\nThis is the calculation of potential DAO Impermanent Loss. The highlighted column assumes the DAO provided $2M in liquidity and highlights the IL at different GHST values.\n \n![LM2.png](ipfs://bafkreifwwg6uy6m7ie7bsj5qrckphykovge6xgcfn7pbnyqzqcqlbnfhsq)\n    \n\nWe are targeting $3 million in external liquidity from this program. We believe that an APR of 50% for 2 months would be enough to incentivize the liquidity provider. This would require $250,000 in LM rewards. The GHST must stay above $3.75 for the LM program to be cheaper than the IL incurred for the DAO. This liquidity mining program is expected to begin shortly before the curve closes.\nThese numbers are only indicative, maybe we can go up to $500,000 in LM rewards at the beginning to give the project an impulse and have a nice price discovery ?\n\n\nSUMMARY\nSo to summarise, we would like to secure $4M ($3M5  for the liquidity provision depending on the type of pool used and about $500k for the LM program). These numbers are obviously subject to adjustments but these $4M would be a maximum used for the liquidity provision at least for a pre-curve program.\n\n\n\nAs an indication, there is 27M of DAI in the contract of curve, which gives $7M of DAI which must be used for increasing liquidity.\n\n\nWe're asking for your feedback and we will be happy to discuss the numbers presented by the CTT.",

      "content": "**Author:** The GotchiFArmy ([GFA] The Gotchi FArmy#6696\n**Gotchi ID:** 8050\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Discourse thread:** https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/1070492453846654977\nhttps://thegotchifarmy.org/aavegotchi-x-sandbox-experience/\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/aavegotchi-x-sandbox-experience-proposal/4637\n \n![Screen-xp-0.8-4-1536x864.png](ipfs://bafkreibhh36u34sxew4ezxr6cw237gvfeafmwy4zfhicsrq3azcj7l6bki)\n\nThe GFA Sandbox team proposes to launch the creation of the Aavegotchi X The Sandbox Experience. It follows the great feedback we got from the **Proof of Concept** presented in January and the SigProp that received the support of the DAO.\n\nThis proposal aligns with the recent Aavegotchi Blog Post related to 2023 **\"The Year of the Gotchi.\"** We are convinced that having Aavegotchi in The Sandbox will bring exposure from a large user base to our ecosystem.\n\n>Bringing Aavegotchi into the Sandbox will contribute to achieving Aavegotchi’s three main focuses of 2023 : \nPlayer growth, Partnerships and Decentralization.\n\nAs described in the DAO Discord Thread, we have an Aavegotchi IP Licence and are discussing  the details of this partnership with The Sandbox but we already have some exclusive intel to share. The **Alpha Season 4** is on its way (End Q2 2023) and Aavegotchi could be part of it if the DAO supports this initiative! With these Sandbox experiences, Aavegotchi DAO will be able to republish again for another Alpha season or in the future on their own lands.\n\nPlease note these additions upon the feedback received from the SigProp and the most recent discussions with The Sandbox:\n\n- Maintenance and Updates: The SigProp mentions \"New updates or features to be added after those releases are out of this scope of work.\" This point will evolve regarding the last discussions we had with The Sandbox and expectations from DAO members. We got the confirmation that the time between the Alpha season 4 with experiences v0.8 (Q2 on sandbox lands) and the expected date for Land owners to be able to release experiences on their own lands shouldn't be too far from each other. That's the reason this proposal includes maintenance and updates until Aavegotchi DAO is willing to publish its own experiences on land (1 Major Gamemaker version update to 0.9 ie). As 0.8 just went out, Sandbox confirmed that the next release isn't right around the corner...\n\n- Ownership: As explained in Hangouts and DAO calls with the community, the GFA does not claim the ownership of any asset or account used / created in this whole process. The limited license agreement entrusts the GFA team to create and use digital assets based on Aavegotchi intellectual property (10% royalty to PC). All source files from asset creations (.VXM / . VXR / ...) and credentials of the Sandbox account (dedicated account) are licensed for a specified purpose and scope: the development and maintenance of our Sandbox Aavegotchi experience.\n\nThis proposal will also lead to some returns upon:\n- Marketing Strategy (Ownership and specific tokens/assets) for experienced players (Gotchis i.e.)\n- Aavegotchi and Sandbox project Aura and community \n- Incentivized events (cross universe/easter eggs/enigmas/contests/leaderboard/prize pools/Twitch Live/AMA/Crew3 quests)\n- Avatars / Wearables Sales (5% commission to Sandbox)\n- Original Assets sales\n\n**This Core Proposal is to fund 195k GHST** and launch the creation of 2 Aavegotchi Experiences in the next 4 months as per:\n- The production costs\n- The side Costs (Project management tool licenses / Promotion / Creation process events / Sandbox Grant discussions and negotiations)\n- Incentives (In-game and Cross-Universe)\n\nThose costs cover 2 experiences:\n- A single player game on a 2x2 land with multiple layers dedicated to Aavegotchi environments \n- A multiplayer game on a 1x1 land with multiple layers\nWe will start to work on these 2 experiences right after this voting session if the DAO supports it.\n\n>**A detailed funding request is available here if you missed it in the DAO Thread :** https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/aavegotchi/optimized/2X/e/e2e7fd532e25a686269be903dfb79fa95cf703f5_2_936x396.jpeg\n\nWe are proposing a split funding with DAI & GHST from the treasury holdings (900k DAI and 4M GHST) :\n> 95k GHST + 110k DAI (rate : 1 GHST = $1.10)\n\nThe idea is to limit the selling pressure on GHST for the production compensation part. This would be 2 payments operated by the DAO Fondation. The release would be settled this way:\n\n> 50% at start (47.5k GHST + 55k DAI)\n50% mid-journey (47.5k GHST + 55k DAI)\n\nMid-journey achievements to be judged would be based on The Sandbox milestones already settled in the timeline to be signed in order to be ready for the end of Q2 2023. The Beta Version is planned for the beginning of May and is the milestone to be considered. According to our contracts PC + Sandbox would judge the quality of that mid term release.\n\nThis funding includes some incentives to be distributed to engaged players and Aavegotchi community members. \n\nThank you for your support Frens and get to your votes!\n \n![comptoirs_baazar.png](ipfs://bafkreie3iykck6rk6p34hfznxfphzechzspxlvkqhl4pxuc377vmffyc4u)   ",

      "content": "**Author:** Andy Boyan and chair\n**Gotchi ID:** 13482\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Discourse thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/infinity-keys-x-aavegotchi/4595\n\nThis CoreProp is for funding the Infinity Keys X Aavegotchi Onboarding Hunt. Infinity Keys put forth a discussion forum post here: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/infinity-keys-x-aavegotchi/4595, has attended several Saturday Hangouts and Sunday DAO meetings to discuss their proposal, and include longtime members of the Aavegotchi community.\n\nIf you didn't read the detailed post here is a tldr.\n- 4,500 ghst to fund a series of gamified challenges to promote onboarding for new players, 3,000 ghst is dedicated for treasure incentives.\n- 3 Challenges: 1) A passcode riddle based on Gotchi Lore, 2) Hold or Rent a Gotchi 3) Pet a Gotchi, and 4) Find a passcode hidden in the gotchiverse.\n- These are designed to be easy for new players to get familiar with the vibes and concepts behind Aavegotchi before they make a full purchase decision to play.\n- At some point beyond the start of the campaign (1-3 weeks) we will conduct a drawing from addresses that have completed the achievement and airdrop various Tickets to winning participants.\n- There is no hard timeline to stop this campaign so it can be used for future Gotchi testers and Infinity Keys collectors beyond the campaign and treasure airdrops.\n- Completing this achievement will be required in other Infinity Keys quests and hunts, bringing other communities to Aavegotchi\n\nOne question that came through the discussions was about metrics. Infinity Keys has 26,000 mints from 5,000+ unique wallets for both free and low-cost mints from players solving challenges and collecting NFT keys. Individual partner projects have seen ~4,000 mints. And what's more exciting is that many of those mints continue to creep up far after the promotional campaign is complete.\n\nWe have done no marketing or promotions, so we think this is a good sign that as we ramp up community more players will come to test out the games. We can't guarantee any level of participation, however, it is very much in our interest to bring as many players as we can through this hunt and into Aavegotchi.\n\nOne of the major goals of this proposal is to give those around you an easier path to trying Aavegotchi without buying in at a high price point. This onboarding comes from a deep understanding of the Gotchi community and how the system functions from an insider's perspective, but has the Alchemica to reach new players and bring them in.\n \n![bafkreihcq722zafexmqkh4x25tucmkl4lu4c67iijnpipqgtdx4nxvmm6m.png](ipfs://bafkreihcq722zafexmqkh4x25tucmkl4lu4c67iijnpipqgtdx4nxvmm6m)",

      "content": "Author: Dr Wagmi (Dr Wagmi#6629)\nGotchi ID: 16635\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/dao-curve-transition-team/4676\n\nWe propose the formation of a DAO Curve Transition Team (CTT) to assist the DAO in managing liquidity and treasury on a contingent basis prior to and after turning off the GHST curve should the DAO consent. We have numerous problems to tackle which need thoughtful investigation. The CTT will provide detailed summaries and analysis of our current state and potential paths moving forward regarding liquidity and asset management. These are some of the main questions the CTT will address and provide potential paths and analyses for DAO consideration:\n \nRegarding liquidity:\nShould current treasury assets be used to provide liquidity prior to the curve being turned off?\n If so, how much? What wallet will hold these LP tokens? Will that liquidity remain after the curve DAI is distributed? Should the DAO stake those LP tokens for GLTR?\nShould the DAO keep GHST-USDC as the primary liquidity pool? If supporting any secondary pools, where do we diversify out? \nWhat is our goal amount of decentralized liquidity?\nHow does this compare to current liquidity? How fast should we seek to establish our goal amount?\nWhat are potential estimations for impermanent loss with different potential trajectories for GHST?\nShould we turn off GLTR rewards for amGHST and move them elsewhere?\n\nRegarding treasury management:\nWhat are our operations for treasury management?\nWhat wallet is holding the funds?\nIs our operational security process adequate?\nAre we keeping funds in DAI or moving to alternative assets?\nWhat other stablecoins would we consider?\nWhat other crypto assets would we consider? ETH, BTC, MATIC? On what chain?\nWhat DeFi protocols should we consider for treasury management?\nWhich ones should we meet with and what liquidity mining rewards should we aim for?\nShould we perform GHST buybacks? If so, how? What are the potential impacts and costs of such a strategy at different liquidity targets?\nWhat should be done with interest earned? GHST buybacks? Compounding into the asset earning interest?\n\nTo answer the above questions with sufficient market research, we propose a 10,000 GHST bounty. We aim to provide the DAO a complete analysis within 3 weeks with multiple potential paths for consideration. Efficient treasury management will provide yield to keep our operations sustainable while also directing liquidity to ensure decentralized access to our core product.\n",

      "title": "25/25/25/25 split for curve DAI",
      "content": "Author: Immaterial#0001, Fantasma#1777\nGotchiID: 16559, 2824\n\nHello frens,\n\nWe would like to put forward our own proposal that we believe is the fairest way to allocate the funds whilst also protecting asset holders. We believe that the 4 pillars of the Aavegotchi ecosystem are: Liquidity, The DAO, Pixelcraft and Asset holders. Therefore, our proposal is to allocate the curve funds evenly between these 4 pillars and making sure asset holders are not left behind by allocating them 25% of the DAI for Protocol Rewards which will directly reward asset holders through either Rarity Farming, or another reward mechanism chosen by the DAO.\n\nThe split would be as follows: \n\nLiquidity: 25%\nThe DAO: 25%\nPixelcraft: 25%\nProtocol rewards: 25%\n\nBy protocol rewards, we mean fair and inclusive reward pools that account for all native assets in the protocol. A yes vote for protocol rewards in this case does not mean a yes vote for ongoing RF in its current iteration, it protects funds to be used to make sure that protocol assets remain liquid and sufficiently included in the economic cycle/paradigm going forward. \n\nA yes vote for protocol rewards signals to loyal supporters of the protocol that the original vision remains intact, rather than being diverted into new and unproven games and business models. \n\nWithout inclusion/correlation between GHST and assets, great economic disruption could follow the turning off of curve for asset owners. A stream of funding protocol rewards for two years not only creates an ongoing source of buy side liquidity for the GHST token, it also allows market participants to trust in the correlation between GHST and protocol assets. \n\nAs we prepare to release the Forge and GBM different assets, we have the choice to signal to market participants whether they are bidding into a single RF season, or towards inclusion in the economic benefits of the platform for a full two years from here.\n\nThank you frens for your vote. For further discussion please head over to the forum thread linked below.",

This proposal is based on a diligent risk assessment of the Curve and concludes that there is a strong case for closing the GHST Bonding Curve and freeing GHST from reliance on MakerDAO’s DAI stable coin.\n\nClosing the Curve in effect concludes a 2.5+ year DAICO (DAO+ICO) token sale. All DAI in the GHST Bonding Curve at the time of closing will transform the DAI from being half of a simple liquidity pool into actual Aavegotchi funding. A second Signal Proposal follows this one proposing a 30/30/40 split of the DAI for the founding team at Pixelcraft Studios, AavegotchiDAO treasury, and an additional 40% for the DAO that is explicitly earmarked for liquidity provisions. \n\nThe Problem: Unnecessary Risk Underpins Aavegotchi Today\n“The Curve is forever” is a shorthand way of expressing how reliable GHST’s tokenomics have been up to this point. However, starting in 2022 turbulence in the macro crypto space has been growing, and our beloved bonding curve is potentially at risk of contagion.\n\nWhile MakerDAO, the issuers of DAI, have delivered a stable stablecoin up to this point (DAI has never had a significant depeg from the USD) there is no guarantee that such success will continue indefinitely. Recent red flags include an inability for MakerDAO to remove the GUSD vault (a stablecoin issued by the recently bankrupt Genesis), the “Endgame” plan to depeg DAI from USD, growing exposure to real-world-assets (RWA) fraught with counterparty risk, and a general overexposure to (and vulnerability of) the USDC stablecoin in the MakerDAO asset pool.\n\nEven if one concludes that DAI’s risk is only low to moderate, we must soberly assess whether such risk tolerance is acceptable to our DAO. Today, I put forth that not only is any risk from DAI’s depeg unacceptable, but such risk is also entirely avoidable. \n\nAavegotchi Is Ready to Secure Funds On Our Own\nAavegotchiDAO has already demonstrated that it can manage its own treasury. Likewise, two plus years of Pixelcraft Studios flawlessly managing all significant ecosystem multisigs and upgradeable contracts underscores the company’s readiness to also manage the DAI at scale.\n\nWith nearly 20M DAI in the curve, there is sufficient funding to continue development and enable deep liquidity at the same time. The Curve was KYC’d and never accessible to a large swath of Aavegotchi fans. Under this proposal, GHST with good liquidity would actually become more accessible to more people!\n\nIt is along this backdrop of benefits including derisking, securing funding, and improving GHST accessibility that I propose closing the GHST Bonding Curve.\n\nAllocation of the Curve’s DAI\nTurning off the Curve is an opportunity to not only derisk from reliance on MakerDAO, but also secure significant funding for our ecosystems.\nSo far, the DAI in the Curve’s contracts has only served one purpose: to provide liquidity for the creation and destruction of GHST tokens. After the Curve’s closure, whatever DAI remains in that contract will be freed to go to work on behalf of the Aavegotchi protocol.\n\nI have offered a separate Signal Proposal to allocate 70% of such DAI to AavegotchiDAO (40% of the total DAI collateral being earmarked specifically for Liquidity Provisions in a separate multisig) and the remaining 30% to go to the team that kickstarted it all and continues to develop both the protocol and the Gotchiverse, Pixelcraft Studios. \n\nTake this proposal and the allocation proposal into consideration together. If my proposed allocation does not pass, there would need to be a new Signal Proposal to take its place before the process of closing the Curve could begin.\n\nProcess:\nThis proposal is for us to close the GHST Bonding Curve in a controlled, methodical way by following these steps:\n\n1. Pass an AGIP on Snapshot confirming AavegotchiDAO’s intention and terms.\n\n2. Migrate the required 8% of total GHST supply back to Ethereum so we can reach quorum in our Curve’s on-chain voting system (long established on Aragon contracts).\n\n3. Complete the Aragon-based vote. It is at this point the Curve will immediately close and any DAI collateral shall be transferred to all multisig wallets in accordance with the original Snapshot’s terms.\n\n4. The Curve closes and all DAI are distributed according to the terms decided by AavegotchiDAO in a subsequent AGIP. \n\nRisks\nThe risks of closing the Curve mostly are technical in nature. Pixelcraft Studios has already had our Solidity team spend time simulating the process for closing the Curve and how that would work. Everything worked as designed. The majority of risk is in the moments after the Curve closes.\nWithout deep liquidity and a spike in outside entities speculating, we may see dramatic volatility in the GHST market.\n\nThere is also a greater-than-zero risk for the new multisig wallets tasked with securing the DAI. With proper planning and for the reasons noted above, we believe that AavegotchiDAO is capable of this responsibility. \n\nBenefits\nThe benefits and reasoning for this are already well fleshed out above but to briefly review:\n\n1. Remove all risk of Aavegotchi’s success relying on an outside party (MakerDAO and DAI)\n\n2. Complete the GHST continuous token sale, securing funding for both AavegotchiDAO and Pixelcraft Studios, thus enabling bigger, better, faster, stronger development for both parties. \n\n3. Improve GHST tokenomics, especially in terms of accessibility. As opposed to having most liquidity locked into a KYC-walled liquidity pool, AavegotchiDAO will be able to dynamically direct liquidity to the platforms that make the most sense at any given time. \n\nConclusion\nFor the benefits noted above, I am proposing that now is the time to meet the moment and make this significant change to the Aavegotchi ecosystem’s meta. The status quo is simply unacceptable as the risk of doing nothing cannot be justified. Together we have weathered a brutal bear market in 2022 and now have an opportunity to prove we’ve learned lessons from watching seemingly invincible players in the space fall. Securing significant funding that is rightfully raised also makes a lot of sense given where we are as a protocol. The vision is too great for small budgets especially when the option to close the token sale and allocate those funds to the vision’s development is completely within AavegotchiDAO’s control. \n\nWe are in a completely unique situation where we can self-fund on a scale envious of our competitors, all while completely derisking from our current reliance on DAI tokens. Let's use this opportunity as a rallying cry to come together and level up as the completely independent, self sustaining AavegotchiDAO. ",

      "title": "Sigprop: Distribute Curve’s DAI 70/30 to AavegotchiDAO and Pixelcraft Studios",
      "content": "Author: Jesse | gldnXross#6482\nGotchiID: 4563\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\n\nFinal Discourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/alternate-proposal-for-post-curve-allocation/4668\n\nOriginal Discourse Thread:\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/proposal-to-close-the-ghst-bonding-curve-and-allocate-curve-s-collateral/4628\n\nAllocation of the Curve’s DAI\nIn addition to derisking from reliance on MakerDAO and DAI, turning off the Curve is also an opportunity to secure significant funding for Aavegotchi development.\n\nSo far, the DAI in the Curve’s contracts has only served one purpose: to provide liquidity for the creation and destruction of GHST tokens. After the Curve’s closure, whatever DAI remains in that contract will be freed to go to work on behalf of the Aavegotchi protocol.\n\nThis proposal is for the Curve’s DAI to be allocated to two main parties, AavegotchiDAO at 70% and Pixelcraft Studios at 30%. This is to take place across three distinct multisig wallets, two of which are managed by AavegotchiDAO elected members while the third allocation goes to the founding team, Pixelcraft Studios, to continue development and advocacy for Aavegotchi protocol. \n\nNote: The numbers below were adjusted from the 20/40/40 split originally proposed, based on community feedback. \n\nAavegotchiDAO Liquidity Provisions (40%)\n40% of the Curve’s collateral should immediately be directed to a DAO managed multisig specifically tasked with deepening liquidity on an agreed upon platform or platforms to help prevent extreme volatility in the moments following the closure of the Curve. There needs to be one or more places for people to enter and exit GHST with healthy liquidity.\n\nAavegotchiDAO will have to decide which platforms make the most sense to deploy on. I suggest that we consider creating a task force empowered to manage this liquidity while the decision of where to initially direct that liquidity could be signaled by the greater DAO at the same time. Examples include decentralized platforms like Quickswap and Uniswap but there is a case for traditional CEXs as well. In either case, Pixelcraft Studios can help to introduce AavegotchiDAO Foundation to trusted market makers or decision makers at the platforms being considered.\n\nIf this proposal passes, AavegotchiDAO should set about deciding how to structure the receiving multisig and who will be responsible for signing, as well as strategies to put the funds to use ASAP.\n\nAavegotchiDAO Foundation (30%)\nThe 9 members recently elected to sit on the AavegotchiDAO Foundation host the most obvious multisig wallet to receive and secure DAI on behalf of our DAO’s treasury.\n\nThe DAO can then opt to vote on a diversification strategy it believes is optimal, and the multisig Directors can carry out that plan. \nRemember, the 9 multisig signers were elected without any decision making power. The DAO at large will be responsible for appropriating funds from treasury via AGIPs, Taask Forces, or other future methods.\n\nPixelcraft Studios (30%)\nHome of the Summoners of AavegotchiDAO and the creators of Aavegotchi, Pixelcraft Studios prides itself on being frugal, good stewards of the funds entrusted to it by the community.\n\nOur vision for 2023 and beyond is clear – to make Aavegotchi a well-known brand in the NFT gaming industry, and beyond that, an IP recognized around the world.\n\nAs to how Pixelcraft Studios intends to use these funds, that can be broken down into seven distinct categories:\n\n1. Ensuring relevant partners have sufficient working capital to maintain deep liquidity on CEXes partnering with Aavegotchi.\n2. Increasing spending on outreach, tasteful marketing, and growth-oriented endeavors to ensure that our message is heard loud and clear in 2023.\n3. Equipping our development and design teams with the staff and training they need to deliver on key roadmap items such as the Gotchiverse, Gotchi Guardians, and Gotchichain.\n4. Derisking from potential stablecoin collapses by diversifying the DAI received into a variety of assets secured on Polygon, Ethereum, and Bitcoin chains, with a small percentage also stored offchain to pay for real-world expenses.\n5. Launching an Aavegotchi builder’s program to incentivize talent to build on Aavegotchi and fast-tracking the IP licensing process.\n6. Donating to registered charities that align with the shared vision and mission of the Aavegotchi community and Pixelcraft Studios.\n7. Sponsoring and hosting IRL events to raise awareness of the Aavegotchi brand and form lasting connections with frens new and old in the meatspace.\n\nNotably, here’s what we would NOT do:\nA. Use the funds to give bonuses or unnecessary raises to Pixelcraft Studios founders or team members.\nB. Spend the funds on frivolous, tasteless marketing that does not serve the Aavegotchi brand.\nC. Spend the funds on any endeavor or product not directly related to Aavegotchi.\n\nWhat if the DAO says no?\nIf the DAO rejects the proposal to turn off the curve for whatever reason, we are pleased to say that Pixelcraft Studios is in fine financial condition, and our roadmap plans would not be significantly affected by this decision.\n\nAll of the items published on our latest 2023 Roadmap, and also on previous roadmaps, are doable with our current treasury and burn rate, assuming that DAI does not experience the depeg we are worried about, and the market does not experience major black swans that massively wipe out all value in the crypto space.\n\nIf the DAO votes to turn off the curve but decides not to allocate funds to Pixelcraft Studios, that is also fine with us, but we would hope it has a solid plan on how to handle a post-curve GHST ecosystem.\n\nConclusion\nThis proposal advocates increasing funding to both major parties by putting the Curve token sale’s DAI to work on behalf of all GHST and Aavegotchi NFT holders. \n\nIf you believe now is the time to go big, scale up operations and improve accessibility to GHST token,  vote for this proposal. \n",

      "content": "Author: Oliver Spoon\nGotchi ID: 4858\n\nHi frens,\n\nI wanted to take a temperature check from the community. Recently there's been a lot of heated debate surrounding the Curve and further the distribution of tokens.\n\nBefore we rush into a binary vote of yes/no turn off and yes/no accept the 40/40/20 split proposal, I think we should slow down and have a proper discussion where all voices are made heard.\n\nWe have a golden opportunity here to really create a collective vision as both PC and community. There are a number of points to discuss and carefully consider before making such bold moves.\n\nAlternatives to the 40/40/20 split have already been proposed and I am sure there will be others from a healthy discussion. I hope to achieve harmony where all parties feel secure in their investments and energy.\n\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/even-allocation-of-curve-reserves-among-4-pillars-of-the-ecosystem/4664/2\n\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/proposal-to-close-the-ghst-bonding-curve-and-allocate-curve-s-collateral/4628/\n\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/addressing-the-comments-and-concerns-about-pixelcraft-finances-and-usage-of-dai-collateral/4641\n\nPlease let the community know how you feel.",

We are convinced that having Aavegotchi to The Sandbox will bring light and a large user base to our ecosystem. \n\n>Bringing Aavegotchi into the Sandbox will contribute to achieving Aavegotchi three main focuses of 2023 : \nPlayer growth, Partnerships and Decentralization.\n\nAs described in the DAO Discord Thread, we have an Aavegotchi IP Licence and are discussing with The Sandbox the details of this partnership but we already have some exclusive intel to share. The **Alpha Season 4** is on its way (End Q2 2023) and Aavegotchi could be part of it if the DAO supports this initiative ! \n\n**The aim of this Signal Proposal is to fund 195 kGHST** for the creation of the Aavegotchi Solo experience in the next 4 months as per :\n- The production costs\n- The side Costs (Project management tool licences / Promotion / Creation process events / Sandbox Grant discussions and negociations)\n- Incentives (Ingame and Cross-Universe)\n\n>**Detailed funding request is available here if you missed it in the DAO Thread :** https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/aavegotchi/optimized/2X/e/e2e7fd532e25a686269be903dfb79fa95cf703f5_2_936x396.jpeg\n\nWe are proposing a split funding with DAI & GHST from the treasury holdings (900k DAI and >4M GHST) :\n> 95 kGHST + 110 kDAI (rate : 1 GHST = 1,10$)\n\nThe idea is to limit the selling pressure on GHST for the production compensation part. This would be a 1 time payment sent to the project Multisig with GFA team + PC + DAO fundation signers. Following release would be settle this way :\n\n> 50% at start (47,5 kGHST + 55 kDAI)\n50% mid-journey upon Multisig signers judgment (same)\n\nThank you for your support Frens and get to your votes ! \n\n![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1049593915650605076/1073151574953701376/comptoirs_baazar.png)\n",

This proposal combines all previous Forge-related signal proposals into a final core proposal. The Core Framework has already been submitted and accepted as a core proposal (AGIP 57). The Completed Forge Whitepaper outlines all Forge mechanics and economics. The Whitepaper will be updated with Forge v1.1- Geodes expansion when the mechanic has been finalized.\n\n**The signal proposals included in this core proposal:**\n\nThe Forge v1.1 – Geodes Funding and Implementation: https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/0x23655a075cd863a6c91f5a55557413c2b20b6cf3d41ab12c575437b321e9b851\n\nForge Raffle Strategy and Revenue Splits: https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/0xfd80fb620a1bfc80f1796d5f3cdc47bb62223e7ccbb8333bd4d7deb76c9f1fd9\n\nThe Forge- Fee Structure and Burn/DAO Percentages: https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/0x5436b9282dc8bff710b89110a9bcfd81010fe606f4306673f8e7a46058adc658\n\nThe Forge- Establishing Alloy Ratios: https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/0xac0a2081017c0540538e877d9bb5f2d8c87dcc1bc47d50435bbfd89cdfcb4962\n\nThe DAO modifiable variables:\n\nThe following are build-in variables designed as levers for the DAO to control.\n\n1. Alloy return on smelting\n      - Currently set at 90% of the amount required to forge\n      - Of the 10% not returned, launch settings are the following:\n                                                  - 50% of alloy sent to a burn address\n                                                  - 50% of alloy sent to the DAO\n2. Core Framework Ratios and Sales – Already passed in AGIP 57\n3. Essence destination on Forging\n     - Settings on launch: 50% of essence will be burnt; 50% sent to the DAO\n\nThis proposal has no major adjustments from the passed signal proposals to the final product.",

In hindsight, the funds allocated for a project should have been withheld to avoid making requests after the fact. We learn from this.\nThe DAO is discussing the assessment and funding of new projects. This process may take another 3-6 weeks till we reach consensus and implement a new funding model.\n\nIn the meantime, we should ensure DAO members and project sponsors who have already done work are made whole for their efforts.\n\nBelow are the completed projects, including an additional request to cover bounties for two months. My compensation has been removed and will be included in another proposal.\n\n- Gotchi Farmy Sandbox Project; 8000/16000 GHST\n- GotchiBoard by Mark; 1000/2000 GHST\n- Media team Bounties 5000 GHST\n\nThe total request is 14,000 GHST. Funding will be sent to the current DTF multi-sig.\n\nThe DTF is not funding new Project Grants for 2023 until the DAO reaches a consensus on an improved funding process. This request is only to compensate members for completed work and to keep DAO operations going with bounties\n\nAppreciate contributions and efforts given towards Aavegotchi DAO & Project development so far.",

It represents the largest gathering of Web3 talent in the world. This year’s event presents an opportunity for Aavegotchi DAO to collaborate with Pixelcraft by sending a team to spread awareness of the Aavegotchi protocol to developers and interested parties at the conference.\n\nThe team will be led by Aavegotchi DAO member Hefe and some of our most active Aavegotchi members.\n\nThe attending team will be:\nLost Local; Pixelcraft Director of physical goods and events.\nHefe; Event lead, managing bounties, organisation\nNoFuturistic; Media capture, editing\nZombie Shepheard; Partnerships, media capture, A/V\nMycaleum; Partnerships, marketing, support\nSmokescreens; Marketing, support\nLev; Support\n\nThe team is coordinating efforts to represent Aavegotchi as a unit; collaborating by wearing weather-appropriate branded team gear, carrying physical merchandise such as stickers, boiling down concise explanations for specific target audiences, and distributing links to a landing page showcasing key features of the protocol and resources for builders.\n\nOne IRL meetup we are excited to host is an ebic coffee shop live-streamed discussion featuring interesting builders present at the event, advocates from venues, and existing partnership connections. We are calling this event #BuidlWithFrens. There will be merchandise giveaways and a custom FG card exclusive to the event, published by GMI. The event will be an opportunity to connect with new frens, and capture unique and interesting experiences from both the Hackathon, shilling zone, man-on-the-street interviews, as well as lectures workshops. The whole coffee shop event will be broadcasted via various streaming services, including Aavegotchi Discord for those who cannot attend.\n\nAn extensive media plan has been put together for ETH Denver featuring a diverse and varied array of content, notably a dual daily VLOG, as well as raw footage sent to both editors and the Pixelcraft marketing team for promotional videos. Media coverage will not only increase our presence at the event, but also give the Aavegotchi team multiple opportunities to create long-term connections with other interesting and informed attendees. The Gotchi Lodge(Air BNB) is close to the venue, making it easy to host interviews there as well.\n\nCurrently, lodging for the event has been secured close to the main venues. Travel plans to the event are secured for over-the-road travellers, with flyers waiting for proposal approval prior to ticket purchase. Details for the ETH Denver Core event are currently limited, but being followed closely with the guidance of LostLocal. The team is in process of procuring team gear and coordinating with partners such as the ETH Denver Polygon team for collaborative opportunities.\n\nETH Denver #BUIDLWeek kicks off February 24th and runs to March 1st. The Core event runs from March 2nd to March 5th. There is a Mountain retreat running from March 6th to the 9th. Attendance to the retreat costs extra, and many of our members have not opted in for this. No allocated proposal funding will be utilised for the optional Mountain Retreat.\n\nFully expanded proposal details can be found here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1cJpbepEWpZnxTn3mlEO9ts_RFdI2npBkGBSXb151lPM/edit?usp=sharing\n\n- Please refer to the above document for amendments. Changes were made to the travel and lodging budgets.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read our proposal and for the continued community support. With frens like you we are definitely GMI.",

      "title": " Infinity Keys x Aavegotchi Paartnership [Updated Numbers]",
      "content": "Author(s): Andy Boyan and chair\nGotchiID: 13482\n\nThis sigprop is for funding the Infinity Keys Aavegotchi Onboarding Hunt. Infinity Keys put forth a discussion forum post here: [https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/infinity-keys-x-aavegotchi/4595](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/infinity-keys-x-aavegotchi/4595), has attended several Saturday Hangouts and Sunday DAO meetings to discuss their proposal, and include longtime members of the Aavegotchi community.\n\nIf you didn't read the detailed post here is a tldr.\n\n- 4,500 ghst to fund a series of gamified challenges to promote onboarding for new plays, 3,000 ghst is dedicated for treasure incentives.\n- 3 Challenges: 1) A passcode riddle based on Gotchi Lore, 2) Hold or Rent a Gotchi 3) Pet a Gotchi, and 4) Find a paccode hidden in the gotchiverse.\n- These are designed to be easy for new players to get familiar with the vibes and concepts behind Aavegotchi before they make a full purchase decision to play.\n- At some point beyond the start of the campaign (1-3 weeks) we will conduct a drawing from addresses that have completed the achievement and airdrop various Tickets to winning participants.\n- There is no hard timeline to stop this campaign so it can be used for future Gotchi testers and Infinity Keys collectors beyond the campaign and treasure airdrops.\n- Completing this achievement will be required in other Infinity Keys quests and hunts, bringing other communities to Aavegotchi\n\nOne question that came through the discussions was about metrics. Infinity Keys has 26,000 mints from 5,000+ unique wallets for both free and low-cost mints from players solving challenges and collecting NFT keys. Individual partner projects have seen ~4,000 mints. And what's more exciting is that many of those mints continue to creep up far after the promotional campaign is complete.\n\nWe have done no marketing or promotions, so we think this is a good sign that as we ramp up community more players will come test out the games. We can't guarantee any level of participation, however, it is very much in our interest to bring as many players as we can through this hunt and into Aavegotchi.\n\nOne of the major goals of this proposal is to give those around you an easier path to trying Aavegotchi without buying in at a high price point. This onboarding comes from a deep understanding of the Gotchi community and how the system functions from an insider's perspective, but has the Alchemica to reach new players and bring them in. \n\n![cd31170de5acbd6da61f0ff0f8528bbc77ce75c0.png](ipfs://bafkreihcq722zafexmqkh4x25tucmkl4lu4c67iijnpipqgtdx4nxvmm6m)\n    ",

We are proposing three key ratios to be set by the DAO and used for managing the supply of cores in the future:\n\n1. The ratio of total wearables to total gotchis.\nThe Forge Team proposes an increase in the rate of wearables to gotchis from current state of 4.2/gotchi  to 4.3/gotchi (approximately 2.6% increase).\n\n2. The ratio of each rarity tier to the total number of wearables.\nThe Forge Team is not proposing any modifications to the ratios between rarity tiers. \n\n3. The ratio of each wearable slot to the total number of wearables.\nThe Forge Team recommends the following slot ratios:\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiekl2hviywszeaiim6q66gmhxt6qbedmkkuiedpiedu53hdmw5gf4)\n    \n\nWe propose that the DAO should use the above key ratios to determine when to release additional cores, as well as how new cores should be distributed between rarities and slots. These ratios result in an initial addition of 2158 total cores across 15 different core types (out of 36 total). \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigqr6cik44k43ei7otfpy6qfyqs3pqedtmeuyaossniqkjvbc3fjy)\n    \nThe Core Framework will need to be maintained to include recent, relevant market data and evolutions in the market and the Aavegotchi protocol. Additional Core or Alloy sales must pass a core proposal outlining the specific sale and reasoning. If this Core Framework is accepted by the DAO, it will be included in a large Core Proposal to launch The Forge. \n",

      "content": "**Author:** Dr Wagmi (Dr Wagmi#6629)\n**GotchiID:** 16635\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Discourse Thread:**  https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/second-round-vrf-rolls-for-parcels/4602\n\nI propose that we implement the round 2 parcel roll by early February. \n\nThe  predominant discussions and farming emissions design specifically outlined a re-roll at 6 months. Many of the most invested and long-standing members of the Gotchiverse specifically designed their farming strategy around this shared understanding. Numerous DAO members helped contribute to the current recipes and mathematics specifically with that timetable in mind. There are additional reasons to implement the round 2 rolls:\n-\tWe have an opportunity to meet our commitments as a DAO, even if the Gotchiverse deliverable of a great battle is not quite ready\n-\tWe can set a precedent for supporting asset holders and contributing members of our ecosystem \n-\tWe will encourage further investment from current community members and be a more attractive investment to newcomers if we establish a pattern of reliability\n-\tGotchiverse land owners have been especially harmed by macro market conditions and gotchiverse-specific market trends. This is one small effort to support those investing time and resources into the Gotchiverse\n-\tWe are pushing for a higher farming to channeling ratio of alchemica emissions which this would support\n-\tIt is more attractive to invest in the alchemica spending competition (and land in general) with a definitive round 2 plan\n-\tIt is a targeted nerf/rug to those most supporting the ecosystem to intentionally delay rerolls\n-\tThe hopeful time frame of an April Great Battle is also not definitive and susceptible to delays given the complexity of the current roadmap and desired focus on PVP\n\nThere are notable potential cons to consider:\n-\tIncreased overall alchemica emissions if invested farmers have round 2 alchemica to farm\n-\tMismatch of new rounds to the anticipated lore of a Great Battle followed by the new round\n\nOn the 1/8 DAO call, coderdan specifically stated it is a small dev lift to implement the next round of re-rolls, so this should not cause any major delays or change in shipping priorities. As thoroughly discussed in DAO discussion, both paths are reasonable, and I appreciate the formal DAO temperature check with this sig prop.\n\nDW\n",

      "content": "Author: Dr Wagmi (Dr Wagmi#6629)\nGotchi ID: 16635\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/the-forge-aalloys-essence-and-smithing-a-massive-proposal/4432\nThe Forge Whitepaper (WIP as a living document): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RvlJmCRudFnso45oPU0veBqo-OLwwZiMJDaNBjRhf54/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThis signal proposal outlines the Geodes mechanic and a request for 8k GHST for funding its smart contract development, art, user interface, and economics.\n\nThe Forge team proposes development and implementation of Geodes in the Forge v1.1 release. The Geode mechanic has the following goals:\n-\tFurther gamify distribution of assets, specifically schematics for The Forge launch set\n-\tDirectly incentivize smelting and maximize deflationary pressure on alloy\n-\tCreates a novel mechanic for distribution of current and future content. This makes the Forge set specifically unique to obtain, marking its namesake debut\n-\tAdd value to individuals directly engaging in the protocol\n-\tSpecifically add value to users who may otherwise feel put off by the 10% alloy tax\n-\tCapture market interest in VRF-based mechanisms\n\nThe Forge Team’s current vision for geodes is the following:\n-\tThere are 6 different rarity tiers of geodes: common through godlike\n-\tA geode is obtained with every smelt \n-\tUsers instantly receive the same rarity tier geode as the smelted wearable\n-\tFor the initial release, only legendary prizes will be available (Forgor set schematics)\n-\tThe mechanic will be further refined so different rarity tiers of prizes will be available\n\nThe following are the proposed chances for winning a prize for each geode rarity. Please note the highlighted row is for the initial Forge release where only legendary schematics will be available. As an example, a common geode gives a 0.792% chance of winning a legendary schematic while a mythical geode gives an 86.3022% chance of winning the legendary schematic. If all 400 legendary schematics are allotted to geodes, 2.25% of all wearables would need to be smelted for all schematics to be claimed.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifcqm6cmtjecmdk2jrqgvardcu5jojhvuiputxf5r7hkwc4imccbu)\n    \n \nThe Forge Team will launch the minimal viable geode as soon as possible to support the Forge release and availability of the Forge set wearables. This will hopefully be soon after the full launch of the Forge. \n\n\n\n",

      "content": "Author: Dr Wagmi (Dr Wagmi#6629)\nGotchi ID: 16635\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/the-forge-aalloys-essence-and-smithing-a-massive-proposal/4432\n\nThis signal proposal outlines the revenue distribution plan for the sale of cores and schematics. It also outlines the GBM and raffle strategy for the cores and schematics distributed via the Forge Launch. The revenue split was discussed with Pixelcraft who is in agreement with the proposed revenue splits.\n\nAs a guiding principle, Cores and Alloy will be sold via GBM and not raffled. GBM revenue will help sustain rarity farming and provide revenue as a counter to the dilutionary effect of their respective sales. As sales of cores and alloy are directly inflationary to asset holders, maximal revenue will be directed to rarity farming to support their RF value proposition. Pixelcraft must receive at least 18% of revenue to maintain tax compliance with the sales. Revenue from the sales will be sent to a PC-controlled wallet and then redistributed via the proposed splits below to their own wallet and the DAO Rarity Farming wallet. As a reminder, no alloy will be sold upon the Forge release. These are the Cores which will be auctioned via GBM:\n  \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihc7aylqiy5euqq6sx73vzwbixvv23x2b3zrntdi5dnlularysvmi)\n    \n\nRevenue splits:\nCores: \n80% to the DAO Rarity Farming Wallet\n20% to Pixelcraft\n\nSchematics:\n55% to the DAO Rarity Farming Wallet\n45% to Pixelcraft\n\nThere are two options regarding Schematics Release and the Raffle Plan:\nOption 1 – Legendary schematics all via Geodes: \nGBM 60% of Godlike, Mythical, Rare, Uncommon, and Uncommon Schematics\nRaffle the remaining 40% of the above schematics via a traditional raffle\nDistribute all legendary schematics via the Geode mechanic \n\nOption 2 – Legendary schematics in geodes and raffle:\nGBM 60% of Godlike, Mythical, Rare, Uncommon, and Uncommon Schematics\nDistribute 60% of legendary schematics via the Geode mechanic\nRaffle 40% of all schematics via a traditional raffle.\n\nThe geode mechanic is still in development but will have a minimal viable product ready shortly after the Forge release. Please see the Forge 1.1 – Geodes signal proposal for more information on its mechanic. Both of these sig props will be combined into the large core prop to launch the forge.\n\nOption 1 (legendary schematics all via geodes) and accept revenue splits\nOption 2 (legendary schematics in geodes and raffle) and accept revenue splits\nNeither option. Delay release.\n",

It represents the largest gathering of Web3 talent in the world. This year’s event presents an opportunity for Aavegotchi DAO to collaborate with Pixelcraft by sending an Aavegotchi DAO team to spread awareness of the Aavegotchi protocol to developers and interested parties at the conference.\n\nThe team will be led by Aavegotchi DAO’s PM and some of our most active Aavegotchi members.\n\nThe attending team will be:\nLost Local; Pixelcraft Director of physical goods and events \nHefe; Aavegotchi DAO PM, editing, bounties, organization\nNoFuturistic; Media capture, editing\nZombie Shepheard; Partnerships, media capture, A/V\nMycaleum; Partnerships, promotion, support\nSmokescreens; Support\nLev; Support \n\nThe team is coordinating efforts to to represent Aavegotchi as a unit; collaborating by wearing weather-appropriate branded team gear, carrying physical merchandise such as stickers, boiling down concise explanations for specific target audiences, and distributing links to a landing page showcasing key features of the protocol and resources for builders.\n\nOne IRL meetup we are excited to host is an ebic coffee shop live-streamed discussion featuring interesting builders present at the event, advocates from venues, and existing partnership connections. We are calling this event #BuidlWithFrens. There will be merchandise giveaways and a custom FG card exclusive to the event, published by GMI. The event will be an opportunity to connect with new frens, and capture unique and interesting experiences from both the Hackathon, shilling zone, man-on-the-street interviews, as well as lectures workshops. The whole coffee shop event will be broadcasted via various streaming services, including Aavegotchi Discord for those who cannot attend. \n\nAn extensive media plan has been put together for ETH Denver featuring a diverse and varied array of content, notably a dual daily VLOG, as well as raw footage sent to both editors and the Pixelcraft marketing team for promotional videos. Media coverage will not only increase our presence at the event, but also give the Aavegotchi team multiple opportunities to create long-term connections with other interesting and informed attendees. The Gotchi Lodge(Air BNB) is close to the venue, making it easy to host interviews there as well.\n\nCurrently, lodging for the event has been secured close to the main venues. Travel plans to the event are secured for over-the-road travelers, with flyers waiting for proposal approval prior to ticket purchase. Details for the ETH Denver Core event are currently limited, but being followed closely with the guidance of LostLocal. The team is in process of procuring team gear and coordinating with partners such as the ETH Denver Polygon team for collaborative opportunities. \n\nETH Denver #BUIDLWeek kicks off February 24th and runs to March 1st. The Core event runs from March 2nd to March 5th. There is a Mountain retreat running from March 6th to the 9th. Attendance to the retreat costs extra, and many of our members have not opted in for this. No allocated proposal funding will be utilized for the optional Mountain Retreat.\n\nFully expanded proposal details can be found here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1cJpbepEWpZnxTn3mlEO9ts_RFdI2npBkGBSXb151lPM/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThank you for taking the time to read our proposal and for the continued community support. With frens like you we are definitely GMI.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In hindsight, the funds allocated for a project should have been withheld to avoid making requests after the fact. We learn from this.\n\nThe DAO is discussing the assessment and funding of new projects. This process may take another 3-6 weeks till we reach consensus and implement a new funding model.\n\nIn the meantime, we should ensure DAO members and project sponsors who have already done work are made whole for their efforts.\n\nBelow are the completed projects, including an additional request to cover bounties for two months. My compensation has been removed and will be included in another proposal.\n\n- Gotchi Farmy Sandbox Project; 8000/16000 GHST \n- GotchiBoard by Mark; 1000/2000 GHST \n- Bounties 5000 GHST\n \nThe total request is 14,000 GHST. Funding will be sent to the current DTF multi-sig.\n\n***The DTF is not funding new Project Grants for 2023 until the DAO reaches a consensus on an improved funding process. This request is only to compensate members for completed work and to keep DAO operations going with bounties***\n\nAppreciate contributions and efforts given towards Aavegotchi DAO & Project development so far.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Launch Round 2 Parcel Rolls ",
      "content": "Author: Dr Wagmi (Dr Wagmi#6629)\nGotchi ID: 16635\nDiscourse Thread:  https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/second-round-vrf-rolls-for-parcels/4602\n\nI propose that we implement the round 2 parcel roll by early February. \n\nThe  predominant discussions and farming emissions design specifically outlined a re-roll at 6 months. Many of the most invested and long-standing members of the Gotchiverse specifically designed their farming strategy around this shared understanding. Numerous DAO members helped contribute to the current recipes and mathematics specifically with that timetable in mind. There are additional reasons to implement the round 2 rolls:\n-\tWe have an opportunity to meet our commitments as a DAO, even if the Gotchiverse deliverable of a great battle is not quite ready\n-\tWe can set a precedent for supporting asset holders and contributing members of our ecosystem \n-\tWe will encourage further investment from current community members and be a more attractive investment to newcomers if we establish a pattern of reliability\n-\tGotchiverse land owners have been especially harmed by macro market conditions and gotchiverse-specific market trends. This is one small effort to support those investing time and resources into the Gotchiverse\n-\tWe are pushing for a higher farming to channeling ratio of alchemica emissions which this would support\n-\tIt is more attractive to invest in the alchemica spending competition (and land in general) with a definitive round 2 plan\n-\tIt is a targeted nerf/rug to those most supporting the ecosystem to intentionally delay rerolls\n-\tThe hopeful time frame of an April Great Battle is also not definitive and susceptible to delays given the complexity of the current roadmap and desired focus on PVP\n\nThere are notable potential cons to consider:\n-\tIncreased overall alchemica emissions if invested farmers have round 2 alchemica to farm\n-\tMismatch of new rounds to the anticipated lore of a Great Battle followed by the new round\n\nOn the 1/8 DAO call, coderdan specifically stated it is a small dev lift to implement the next round of re-rolls, so this should not cause any major delays or change in shipping priorities. As thoroughly discussed in DAO discussion, both paths are reasonable, and I appreciate the formal DAO temperature check with this sig prop.\n\nDW\n",

      "content": "Author: Dr Wagmi (Dr Wagmi#6629)\nGotchi ID: 16635\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/the-forge-aalloys-essence-and-smithing-a-massive-proposal/4432\n\nThe Core Framework: A Proposal for Responsibly Managing Aavegotchi Wearables Emissions\n\nCore Framework Written Summary: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HTBNQqIVzvENiNmCL3kKAvgdKzcs4nWgyyVHvmX_ONQ/edit?usp=sharing\n\nCore Framework Ratios, Calculations and Proposed Sale: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jk6O3zzsOIBmy1OwQlBsy0LWPQZrjxsWmlY2YCMz2iw/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThese documents, prepared by The Forge Team, constitutee our recommended framework for the DAO to responsibly manage the future emissions of additional cores, and thus the increase of wearables supply. \n\nThe supply of cores, as defined in The Forge Litepaper, is the lever by which the protocol controls how many wearables can be forged on a rarity and slot basis. We are proposing three key ratios to be set by the DAO and used for managing the supply of cores in the future:\n\n1. The ratio of total wearables to total gotchis.\nThe Forge Team proposes an increase in the rate of wearables to gotchis from current state of 4.2/gotchi  to 4.3/gotchi (approximately 2.6% increase).\n\n2. The ratio of each rarity tier to the total number of wearables.\nThe Forge Team is not proposing any modifications to the ratios between rarity tiers. \n\n3. The ratio of each wearable slot to the total number of wearables.\nThe Forge Team recommends the following slot ratios:\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiekl2hviywszeaiim6q66gmhxt6qbedmkkuiedpiedu53hdmw5gf4)\n    \n\nWe propose that the DAO should use the above key ratios to determine when to release additional cores, as well as how new cores should be distributed between rarities and slots. These ratios result in an initial addition of 2158 total cores across 15 different core types (out of 36 total). \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigqr6cik44k43ei7otfpy6qfyqs3pqedtmeuyaossniqkjvbc3fjy)\n    \nThe Core Framework will need to be maintained to include recent, relevant market data and evolutions in the market and the Aavegotchi protocol. Additional Core or Alloy sales must pass a core proposal outlining the specific sale and reasoning. If this Core Framework is accepted by the DAO, it will be included in a large Core Proposal to launch The Forge. \n",

      "title": "[AGIP55] Update the Template to Require the Use of ‘Weighted Voting’’ ",
      "content": "**Author:** CryptoGotchi\n**GotchiIDs:** 8612 (I opt out of receiving XP for this proposal)\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Discourse Thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/update-the-template-to-require-the-use-of-weighted-voting/4569\n\nHey there,\n\nI'd like to propose that we update the template for proposals to require all future proposals to use the voting system 'weighted voting' (even for simple yes/no proposals). Weighted voting is what was used in the AavegotchiDAO Foundation election CoreProp.\n\nEffect:\n\n1. Using weighted voting, sub-DAOs like GotchiVault will be able to vote in a way that accurately reflects the outcomes of their sister proposals.\n2. People will be able to show slight preferences, or even indifference, by splitting their own votes; even on yes/no proposals.\n\nGoals:\n\n1. A more accurate reflection of VP.\n2. Lessen concerns about large sub-DAOs being able to determine a proposal's outcome by themselves. For example, when GotchiVault does not split it's vote, they basically pick the winning choice of any proposal that reaches a quorum of about 3M or more. By giving them the ability to fine-tune their VP to their sister-proposal's results, there would be less concerns from DAO members about large sub-DAOs accumulating VP.\n\nRisks:\n\n1. Even if we require the use of weighted voting for all future proposals, we can't force sub-DAOs to utilize it in a democratic way. They still might decide to put all their VP behind the winning choice of their sister proposal. While this is completely up to them, there is little downside for the DAO in giving them that choice (i.e. enabling them to split their votes more accurately).\n2. Weighted voting might seem unfamiliar at first. However, we've recently utilized this voting system for the AavegotchiDAO Foundation election, and I have yet to see any complaints about the system being too complicated for people to use. The way that snapshot implemented it, is very intuitive, so 'weighted voting' being unfamiliar seems to be a negligible concern.\n3. Could potentially increase uninformed voting. Having to make a choice is sometimes hard. Especially because snapshot allows anyone to check all your past votes. So one should feel a sense of responsibility when casting one's vote. Using weighted voting we could see some people splitting their vote equally for all available choices. While this could reflect true indifference, it could also be a way for people to get XP while avoiding responsibility for any outcome. So no reason to read up on what's going on, just split the vote and get XP.\nWhile this might seem like a valid concern, I don't believe it is. There are always some uninformed people voting with their guts. People who care enough about their reputation to vote 50/50 to avoid responsibility for their choice (instead of just picking one of the options), but don't care enough to read up on their choices and pick what they believe is the best option, are likely a negligible minority.\n\nAlternative:\n\nNot changing the template.\n\nRelated material:\n\nTemplate:\n\nhttps://aavegotchi.medium.com/scaling-aavegotchidao-c7e589de0333\n\nWeighted voting:\n\nhttps://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types#weighted-voting\n",

      "title": "[AGIP54] Creating the Aarcade Taask Force (ATF)",
      "content": "**Authors:** jarrod | aavegotchistats.com#9686, Gotchinomics#4936, Slick#2526\n**GotchiIDs:** [6912, 233, 3934]\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Discourse Thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/creation-of-an-aarcade-dao/2128/47?u=jarrod\n\nBackground\n\nThis SigProp was previously created back in June 2022, the proposal did not meet the quorum at the time. This proposal is being re-created as there has been some traction on games developed by community members that would like to utilize player rewards acquired through AGIP16.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe open-source nature of the Aavegotchi protocol combined with its on-chain assets provides an excellent foundation for external development efforts. More specifically, third-party developed games can greatly expand the usability of Aavegotchi assets and provide growth to the entire project.\n\nProblem\n\nThrough AGIP 16, the DAO staked 100k GHST to generate rewards that could be given out to the wider Aavegotchi community of players for participating in mini-game events. To date, there has been minimal usage of these rewards. This is in part due to lack of:\n\n- Clarity on how game developers can apply for (and be sent) player rewards for their game events,\n- A game development focused task force that can help review applications for these player rewards, and,\n- New games!!\n\nSolution\n\nThis proposal aims to introduce and confirm the Aarcade Taask Force (ATF) who will:\n\n- Control the multi-sig wallet that distributes player rewards to the community and developers,\n- Review applications for player rewards to be used in developer games, and\n- Provide a supportive platform for developers to discuss, troubleshoot and test their games in the ATF’s Aavegotchi Aarcade discord server.\n\nEnd Goal & Benefit\n\nThe ATF’s objective is to help incentivize the development of more mini-games of a higher quality for the Aavegotchi community to play, share and enjoy. The natural benefit of this is increased utility and growth for the Aavegotchi protocol and its assets. By taking active custody of the 100k GHST from AGIP16, the ATF firmly believes it can help more player rewards get to the community and spur the next generation of Aavegotchi mini-games!\n\nPotential Risks\n\nAs we are in the early stages of forming the Aarcade Task Force some potential risks include:\n\n- Mismanagement, theft or loss of rewards (multi-sig wallet helps mitigate this),\n- ATF members becoming inactive (signer numbers have been kept low to help ensure the multi-sig remains agile)\n\nAmendment to AGIP 16\n\nAGIP16 did not originally allow for usage of the 100k GHST to directly purchase assets from the Aavegotchi bazaar.\n\nThe ATF proposes that for successful stress test and xp/release game events, the following maximum drawdown amounts from the 100k GHST pool can be made (in agreeance with the game developer hosting an event) to purchase additional prizes from the Aavegotchi bazaar to be distributed to players:\n\n- 100 GHST per stress test game event\n- 500 GHST per xp/release game event\n\nNote: Purchases will only be made via the Aavegotchi bazaar for maximum transparency.\n\nFake Gotchi Cards (FGC’s)\n\nFrens generated by the AGIP16 100k GHST were used to enter the last raffle draw for Fake Gotchi Cards netting a total of 87 burn cards that are now available for use as mini-game player rewards. Under this proposal, these cards would also be transferred to the ATF multi-sig.\n\nThe ATF intends to allow one card be used per game event to mint a collection that can be distributed to players as the game developer of that event sees fit. A typical use case could be that 100 pieces of art are minted with one FGC and then distributed to the top 100 addresses in a game leaderboard event.\n\nNote: Compensation for artists collaborating on FGC works will be from funding sources outside of the AGIP16 100k GHST (and its rewards pool) and is outside the ATF’s scope. It will be the game developers responsibility to negotiate terms with a collaborating artist.\n\nATF Members\n\nThere will be 7 initial signers for the ATF multi-sig wallet.\n\nThese members have all actively participated in the Aavegotchi community for over a year now, come from different backgrounds and consist of experienced developers, security experts and gamers:\n\nTransactions will require 4 out 7 signers to approve before they can be processed.\n \n![bafkreih5o7prg2u2mvfrqteqnjz3zrfj6xdc6uv4cdkpwqgfzi5ed2ckai.png](ipfs://bafkreih5o7prg2u2mvfrqteqnjz3zrfj6xdc6uv4cdkpwqgfzi5ed2ckai)\n\nThe ATF multi-sig treasury wallet will be used to:\n\n- Control distribution of rewards from AGIP16 100k GHST Staking,\n- Convert GHST to and from wapGHST for GLTR staking, noting the following:\nThe staked ratio to be managed at the ATF’s discretion, and,\nOnly the wapGHST pool will be used for staking\nATF to stake for GLTR for now but will review this as the greater Aavegotchi protocol and DAO evolves\n- Drawdown on 100K player rewards to purchase Aavegotchi NFT assets from the Baazaar to distribute as player rewards\nMaximum of 100 GHST for each stress test event\nMaximum of 500 GHST for each xp/release event\n- Minting Fake Gotchi Card art work to be used as player rewards\n\nConclusion\n\nSo what do you think? Should we form the Aarcade Taask Force this time Anon?\n",

      "content": "Author: HARDKOR#6268\nGotchiID: 15883\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\nDiscussion thread: \nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/designate-all-backspill-as-district-funds-for-municipal-auctions/4574\nThe alternative discussion thread:\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/burn-locked-spillover/4570 (thread for other prop, is mostly people preferring this is idea)\n\nHello frens, this proposal is an alternative to \"Burn locked spillover\"\n\nProblems: \n1. Unreleased spillover(Backspill) has accumulated to a point where it would be too inflationary to add back into the economy and many are worried that this event would be catastrpohic for our tokenomics.\n2. Many also feel that the spillover is part of their yield and want some control of it or credit for creating it.\n\nProposed Solution:  \nAllocate all backspill  to the District DAOs, upon their formation. This is only to be used in municipal auctions(decorating the districts and making them unique) and is not to be released into the general economy, ever.\n\nBenefits:\n1. The economic effect is the same as burning the spillage.\n2. People get to do something with the spillage.\n3. The community will be brought together by community building instead of divided by a one sided result.\n\nTo be very clear - Backspill would be set aside until district DAOs are formed, and used only for purchasing municipal installations, directly from Pixelcraft, who would then burn the alchemica.",

      "title": "Burn locked spillover",
      "content": "Authors: Mark#4094\nGotchi IDs: 19172\n\nHey frens,\n\nSince turning off spillover in the gotchiverse the \"locked\" spillover has been collecting in a PC owned wallet.\n\nAs a DAO we've taken great steps to improve the economy and tokenomics by reducing issuance to a level our current number of players and demand can handle. I believe this large amout of \"locked\" spillover would endanger this hard work if it were to be brought into circulation. Therefore, I am proposing to change the locked spillover policy to one of the following options:\n\n*Option 1*\n\n- Burn all currently locked spillover\n- Burn all spillover going forward unless an event is happening (e.g. Saturday hangout) or the DAO votes to turn spillover back on\n\n*Option 2*\n\n- The same as option 1 but exclude spillover that has come from reservoirs (land)\n\nEither option burns all currently locked spillover but with option 1 no spillover will be collected going forward whereas Option 2 would mean spillover from reservoirs would carry on being collected going forward and we would need to decide how to distribute that later.\n\nThe main argument for option 1 is that it's better for the economy at this stage to have less alchemica being circulated. The main argument for Option 2 is that the spillover from reservoirs has come from parcels that people own and therefore shouldn't be burnt.\n\nThere's more nuanced discussion in the forum thread so check that out and ask any questions there. Happy voting frens.",

      "title": "Update the template to require the use of 'weighted voting'",
      "content": "Author: CryptoGotchi\nGotchiID: 8612 (I opt out of receiving XP for this proposal)\nVoting Duration: 7 days\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/update-the-template-to-require-the-use-of-weighted-voting/4569\n\nHey there,\n\nI'd like to propose that we update the template for proposals to require all future proposals to use the voting system 'weighted voting' (even for simple yes/no proposals). Weighted voting is what was used in the AavegotchiDAO Foundation election CoreProp.\n\n**Effect:**\n\n1. Using weighted voting, sub-DAOs like GotchiVault will be able to vote in a way that accurately reflects the outcomes of their sister proposals. \n\n2. People will be able to show slight preferences, or even indifference, by splitting their own votes; even on yes/no proposals.\n\n**Goals:**\n1) A more accurate reflection of VP.\n\n2) Lessen concerns about large sub-DAOs being able to determine a proposal's outcome by themselves. For example, when GotchiVault does not split it's vote, they basically pick the winning choice of any proposal that reaches a quorum of about 3M or more. By giving them the ability to fine-tune their VP to their sister-proposal's results, there would be less concerns from DAO members about large sub-DAOs accumulating VP.\n\n**Risks:**\n1) Even if we require the use of weighted voting for all future proposals, we can't force sub-DAOs to utilize it in a democratic way. They still might decide to put all their VP behind the winning choice of their sister proposal. While this is completely up to them, there is little downside for the DAO in giving them that choice (i.e. enabling them to split their votes more accurately).\n\n2) Weighted voting might seem unfamiliar at first. However, we've recently utilized this voting system for the AavegotchiDAO Foundation election, and I have yet to see any complaints about the system being too complicated for people to use. The way that snapshot implemented it, is very intuitive, so 'weighted voting' being unfamiliar seems to be a negligible concern.\n\n3) Could potentially increase uninformed voting. Having to make a choice is sometimes hard. Especially because snapshot allows anyone to check all your past votes. So one should feel a sense of responsibility when casting one's vote. Using weighted voting we could see some people splitting their vote equally for all available choices. While this *could* reflect true indifference, it could also be a way for people to get XP while avoiding responsibility for any outcome. So no reason to read up on what's going on, just split the vote and get XP. \nWhile this might seem like a valid concern, I don't believe it is. There are always some uninformed people voting with their guts. People who care enough about their reputation to vote 50/50 to avoid responsibility for their choice (instead of just picking one of the options), but don't care enough to read up on their choices and pick what they believe is the best option, are likely a negligible minority.\n\n**Alternative:**\n\nNot changing the template.\n\n\n**Related material:**\n\nTemplate:\nhttps://aavegotchi.medium.com/scaling-aavegotchidao-c7e589de0333\n\nWeighted voting:\nhttps://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types#weighted-voting",

      "content": "Author: Jesse | gldnXross#6482\nGotchiID: 4563\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\nXP Reward: 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/form-aavegotchidao-foundation-with-9-directors-multisig-signers/4551\nSigprop: https://vote.aavegotchi.com/#/proposal/0xa9fb5cbdeae064bf114b27ea77390e93d8515c6c3512d4352f21e99212628483\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\nAavegotchiDAO was summoned as a 100% on-chain DAO in September 2020 via the deployment of the GHST bonding curve. Since then, the DAO has matured into one of the world’s most active with over forty successful AGIPs passed and extremely healthy metrics on Snapshot. Over this period we also graduated across our DAO’s roadmap, going from DAO 1.0 into the more experimental period known as Cocoon, our precursor to Metamorphosis (AKA DAO 2.0). Achieving Metamorphosis requires the DAO to further decentralize and accept more responsibilities currently guarded by the original summoners and Pixelcraft Studios.\n\nToday we propose the next major step forward by suggesting it is time for AavegotchiDAO to add an off-chain presence to our decentralized autonomous organization. The following proposal is rooted in months of research and interfacing with a variety of legal advisors. We also take the practices of leading peers such as ENS and Sushi into consideration, opting for Foundation formation in the Cayman Islands coupled with on-chain governance being secured as primary via the Foundation’s Constitution.\n\nRead on to see how we may move AavegotchiDAO forward in a way that drives progress for our vision of an open-source, on-chain gaming protocol!\n\n**PROPOSAL**\nMy proposal is for us to form the AavegotchiDAO Foundation in the Cayman Islands as soon as possible by following these steps:\n\n1. AGIP 51 is simultaneously live to elect 9 Directors/multisig signers. The results of this election will only be applied if this CoreProp to form the Foundation passes.\n\n*Hear from all of the applicants for Directorship at our Discord's “#DAO Entity Signaling Thread” under #Dao-forum.\n\n2. Submit the nine fully KYC’d, elected Directors details to our legal counsel from LEX DAO so that they can immediately begin Foundation formation. \n\n3. Upon formation of the Foundation, the Directors shall create the new Foundation’s primary multisig using Gnosis.\n\n4. Pixelcraft Studios shall transfer DAO Treasury multisig funds to the Foundation multisig, including DAI, GHST, and Alchemica on both Ethereum and Polygon networks.\n\n5. The Foundation is thus formed, ready to execute transactions according to the will of AavegotchiDAO. Further definitions of responsibilities, scope, goals and limits can be defined by the DAO at a later date.\n\n**FOUNDATION DETAILS**\n**Entity**\n- A Cayman Islands foundation with a board consisting of 9 Directors, who are also the multisig signers of the DAO Treasury wallet.\n\n- Legal Counsel shall arrange a local officer to act as secretary fulfilling basic administrative requirements until further notice.\n\n- Legal Counsel shall arrange a local corporate secretarial service to assist with Foundation formation, documentation and production of financial statements.\n\n**DAO Treasury**\n\n- All DAO treasury funds present and future shall be transferred to the Board’s multisig.\n\n- The GHST Bonding Curve Council tokens could potentially also be transferred to the multisig signers, via a new AGIP proposal.\n\n- Eventually, all protocol contracts could be owned by this multisig, or if that is deemed not ideal, could be owned by the DAO itself (onchain voting) with the Board multisig action as a last resort Guardian to prevent malicious transactions.\n\n**Bank Account**\nUpon formation of the Foundation, legal counsel will confer with our corporate secretary to establish a Cayman Island’s bank account on the Foundation’s behalf. While not immediately useful, we have requested that this bank account be opened so as to futureproof the DAO to be able to natively settle any off-chain expenses (tradfi subscription fees, service providers, etc).\n\n**Board of Directors**\n- Consists of nine doxxed Directors that also act as multisig signers on the DAO Treasury multisig. The DAO Treasury multisig shall be set at 5/9 signers in order to execute.\n\n- Paid position starting at 8000 GHST per year, paying 2000 GHST to each Directory directly from the Treasury multisig every 90 days.\n\n- The Board acts as the executor of the DAO’s wishes. If individual Directors disagree with an action of the DAO, they can choose to resign but they cannot vote or act against a verified on-chain AGIP’s intent.\n\n**The Officer**\nThe Foundation also requires at least one Officer to serve an official capacity for signing off-chain documentation. Legal offers a package to deliver one local Officer to fulfill this role. This is not a role for advocacy so this Officer will simply execute signatures at the direction of the Directors. Of course, AavegotchiDAO can always revisit or even expand Officer roles at any point.\n\n**The Constitution**\n- Legal Counsel will draft and supply a first version of a Constitution that takes best practices from fellow DAOs into consideration. Counsel will submit this Constitution in the form of a Google Sheet with comments turned on for our community to give feedback and suggest changes.\n\n- Counsel and the DAO shall go back and forth in up to three drafts before the Constitution is sent to Snapshot for a three-day CoreProp regarding ratification.\n\n- If ratification fails, another two drafts shall be edited before re-submitting for another CoreProp vote. This process continues until a ratification of the Constitution is achieved.\n\n- The Consitution Ratification shall require 66%+ support once ready for CoreProp (no Sigprop). \n\n**ROADMAP  (Estimated and updated since Sigprop)**\nNow - Nov 21: DAO Discussion Forum + Signaling *(PASSED)*\nNov 21: 3 Day Sigprop on whether or not to incorporate\nNov 27: 7 Day Coreprop with elections\nDec 5 - DAO Foundation directors confirmed/elected\nDec 17 - DAO Foundation officially launched with 9 directors\nDec 18 - DAO Treasury multisig transfers to the Foundation\nQ2 2023 - Diamond Contracts transfer to Foundation\n\n**Benefits of Formation**\n- Independence; greater separation of Pixelcraft Studios from AavegotchiDAO\n- Board can execute proposals on behalf of the DAO (Liquidity provision, GHST staking, funding Dework, etc.)\n\n**Risks of Formation**\n- More responsibility on AavegotchiDAO governance\n- More exposure to any future policy shifts specifically in the Cayman Islands jurisdiction\n\nJoin the conversation in the forum and be sure to review those applying to serve as Directors in AGIP 51 as well. \n",

      "title": "SigProp: Creating the Aarcade Taask Force (ATF)",
      "content": "Authors: jarrod | aavegotchistats.com#9686, Gotchinomics#4936, Slick#2526\nGotchiIDs: [6912, 233, 3934]\nVoting Duration: 7 days\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/creation-of-an-aarcade-dao/2128/47?u=jarrod\n\nBackground\n\nThis SigProp was previously created back in June 2022, the proposal did not meet the quorum at the time. This proposal is being re-created as there has been some traction on games developed by community members that would like to utilize player rewards acquired through AGIP16.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe open-source nature of the Aavegotchi protocol combined with its on-chain assets provides an excellent foundation for external development efforts. More specifically, third-party developed games can greatly expand the usability of Aavegotchi assets and provide growth to the entire project.\n\nProblem\n\nThrough AGIP 16, the DAO staked 100k GHST to generate rewards that could be given out to the wider Aavegotchi community of players for participating in mini-game events. To date, there has been minimal usage of these rewards. This is in part due to lack of:\n- Clarity on how game developers can apply for (and be sent) player rewards for their game events,\n- A game development focused task force that can help review applications for these player rewards, and,\n- New games!!\n\nSolution\n\nThis proposal aims to introduce and confirm the Aarcade Taask Force (ATF) who will:\n- Control the multi-sig wallet that distributes player rewards to the community and developers,\n- Review applications for player rewards to be used in developer games, and\n- Provide a supportive platform for developers to discuss, troubleshoot and test their games in the ATF’s Aavegotchi Aarcade discord server.\n\nEnd Goal & Benefit\n\nThe ATF’s objective is to help incentivize the development of more mini-games of a higher quality for the Aavegotchi community to play, share and enjoy. The natural benefit of this is increased utility and growth for the Aavegotchi protocol and its assets. By taking active custody of the 100k GHST from AGIP16, the ATF firmly believes it can help more player rewards get to the community and spur the next generation of Aavegotchi mini-games!\n\nPotential Risks\n\nAs we are in the early stages of forming the Aarcade Task Force some potential risks include:\n\n- Mismanagement, theft or loss of rewards (multi-sig wallet helps mitigate this),\n- ATF members becoming inactive (signer numbers have been kept low to help ensure the multi-sig remains agile)\n\nAmendment to AGIP 16\n\nAGIP16 did not originally allow for usage of the 100k GHST to directly purchase assets from the Aavegotchi bazaar. \n\nThe ATF proposes that for successful stress test and xp/release game events, the following maximum drawdown amounts from the 100k GHST pool can be made (in agreeance with the game developer hosting an event) to purchase additional prizes from the Aavegotchi bazaar to be distributed to players:\n\n- 100 GHST per stress test game event\n- 500 GHST per xp/release game event\n\nNote: Purchases will only be made via the Aavegotchi bazaar for maximum transparency.\n\nFake Gotchi Cards (FGC’s)\n\nFrens generated by the AGIP16 100k GHST were used to enter the last raffle draw for Fake Gotchi Cards netting a total of 87 burn cards that are now available for use as mini-game player rewards. Under this proposal, these cards would also be transferred to the ATF multi-sig.\n\nThe ATF intends to allow one card be used per game event to mint a collection that can be distributed to players as the game developer of that event sees fit. A typical use case could be that 100 pieces of art are minted with one FGC and then distributed to the top 100 addresses in a game leaderboard event.\n\nNote: Compensation for artists collaborating on FGC works will be from funding sources outside of the AGIP16 100k GHST (and its rewards pool) and is outside the ATF’s scope. It will be the game developers responsibility to negotiate terms with a collaborating artist. \n\nATF Members\n\nThere will be 7 initial signers for the ATF multi-sig wallet.\n\nThese members have all actively participated in the Aavegotchi community for over a year now, come from different backgrounds and consist of experienced developers, security experts and gamers:\n\nTransactions will require 4 out 7 signers to approve before they can be processed.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreih5o7prg2u2mvfrqteqnjz3zrfj6xdc6uv4cdkpwqgfzi5ed2ckai)\n    \nThe ATF multi-sig treasury wallet will be used to:\n\n- Control distribution of rewards from AGIP16 100k GHST Staking,\n- Convert GHST to and from wapGHST for GLTR staking, noting the following:\n  The staked ratio to be managed at the ATF’s discretion, and,\n  Only the wapGHST pool will be used for staking\n  ATF to stake for GLTR for now but will review this as the greater Aavegotchi protocol and DAO evolves\n- Drawdown on 100K player rewards to purchase Aavegotchi NFT assets from the Baazaar to distribute as player rewards\n  Maximum of 100 GHST for each stress test event\n  Maximum of 500 GHST for each xp/release event\n- Minting  Fake Gotchi Card art work to be used as player rewards\n\nConclusion\n\nSo what do you think? Should we form the Aarcade Taask Force this time Anon?\n",

      "title": "SigProp: Create AavegotchiDAO Foundation with 9 Directors/multisig signers",
      "content": "Author: Jesse | gldnXross#6482\nGotchiID: 4563\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 3 days\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/form-aavegotchidao-foundation-with-9-directors-multisig-signers/4551\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\nAavegotchiDAO was summoned as a 100% on-chain DAO in September 2020 via the deployment of the GHST bonding curve. Since then, the DAO has matured into one of the world’s most active with over forty successful AGIPs passed and extremely healthy metrics on Snapshot. Over this period we also graduated across our DAO’s roadmap, going from DAO 1.0 into the more experimental period known as Cocoon, our precursor to Metamorphosis (AKA DAO 2.0). Achieving Metamorphosis requires the DAO to further decentralize and accept more responsibilities currently guarded by the original summoners and Pixelcraft Studios. \n\nToday we propose the next major step forward by suggesting it is time for AavegotchiDAO to add an off-chain presence to our decentralized autonomous organization. The following proposal is rooted in months of research and interfacing with a variety of legal advisors. We also take the practices of leading peers such as ENS and Sushi into consideration, opting for Foundation formation in the Cayman Islands coupled with on-chain governance being secured as primary via the Foundation’s Constitution. \n\nRead on to see how we may move AavegotchiDAO forward in a way that drives progress for our vision of an open-source, on-chain gaming protocol! \n\n**PROPOSAL**\nMy proposal is for us to form the AavegotchiDAO Foundation in the Cayman Islands as soon as possible by following these steps:\n\n- Gather all interested in serving as one of nine Directors on the Foundation. These nine Directors simultaneously are seated on the Foundation’s newly formed multisig wallet. All serving must be KYC’d. \n\n*Interested in being a Director? Signal your interest by saying so in the dedicated Discord thread called “#DAO Entity Signaling Thread” under #Dao-forum. \n\n- Host election via Snapshot where the nine most voted for shall serve as Directors of the Foundation until further notice (The DAO should likely flesh out details for term length etc with a separate AGIP at a later date). The election shall happen in parallel to this proposal’s CoreProp.\n\n- Submit the nine fully KYC’d Directors details to our legal counsel from LEX DAO so that they can immediately begin Foundation formation. This will be completed in days, not weeks. \n\n- Upon formation of the Foundation, the Directors shall create the new Foundation’s primary multisig using Gnosis. \n\n- Pixelcraft Studios shall transfer DAO Treasury multisig funds to the Foundation multisig, including DAI, GHST, and Alchemica on both Ethereum and Polygon networks.\n\n- The Foundation is thus formed, ready to execute transactions according to the will of AavegotchiDAO. Further definitions of responsibilities, scope, goals and limits can be defined by the DAO at a later date. \n\n**FOUNDATION DETAILS**\n**Entity**\n- A Cayman Islands foundation with a board consisting of 9 Directors, who are also the multisig signers of the DAO Treasury wallet. \n- Legal Counsel shall arrange a local officer to act as secretary fulfilling basic administrative requirements until further notice.\n- Legal Counsel shall arrange a local corporate secretarial service to assist with Foundation formation, documentation and production of financial statements. \n\n**DAO Treasury**\n- All DAO treasury funds present and future shall be transferred to the Board’s multisig. \n- The GHST Bonding Curve Council tokens could potentially also be transferred to the multisig signers, via a new AGIP proposal. \n- Eventually, all protocol contracts could be owned by this multisig, or if that is deemed not ideal, could be owned by the DAO itself (onchain voting) with the Board multisig action as a last resort Guardian to prevent malicious transactions. \n\n**Bank Account**\nUpon formation of the Foundation, legal counsel will confer with our corporate secretary to establish a Cayman Island’s bank account on the Foundation’s behalf. While not immediately useful, we have requested that this bank account be opened so as to futureproof the DAO to be able to natively settle any off-chain expenses (tradfi subscription fees, service providers, etc).\n\n**Board of Directors**\nConsists of nine doxxed Directors that also act as multisig signers on the DAO Treasury multisig. The DAO Treasury multisig shall be set at 5/9 signers in order to execute. \nPaid position starting at 8000 GHST per year, paying 2000 GHST to each Directory directly from the Treasury multisig every 90 days.\n\nThe Board acts as the executor of the DAO’s wishes. If individual Directors disagree with an action of the DAO, they can choose to resign but they cannot vote or act against a verified on-chain AGIP’s intent. \n\n**Candidates should:**\nBe upstanding members of AavegotchiDAO with good reputations\nBe familiar with smart contract interactions\nPossess a hardware wallet and know how to use it\nBe willing to have your name on a Cayman entity and be doxxed to Pixelcraft Studios\n(Nice to have) Be familiar with creating transactions and signing on Gnosis Safe\n\n**The Officer**\nThe Foundation also requires at least one Officer to serve an official capacity for signing off-chain documentation. Legal offers a package to deliver one local Officer to fulfill this role. This is not a role for advocacy so this Officer will simply execute signatures at the direction of the Directors. Of course, AavegotchiDAO can always revisit or even expand Officer roles at any point. \n\n**The Constitution**\nLegal Counsel will draft and supply a first version of a Constitution that takes best practices from fellow DAOs into consideration. Counsel will submit this Constitution in the form of a commentable Google Sheet for our community to give feedback and suggest changes. \n\nCounsel and the DAO shall go back and forth in up to three drafts before the Constitution is sent to Snapshot for a three-day CoreProp regarding ratification.\n\nIf ratification fails, another two drafts shall be edited before re-submitting for another CoreProp vote. This process continues until a ratification of the Constitution is achieved. \n\nDue to the critical nature of this CoreProp and the fact that it skips the SigProp step, **the CoreProp vote shall require a voting result with those in approval at 66% or greater.**\n\n**Roadmap (Estimated)**\nNow - Nov 21: DAO Discussion Forum + Signaling\nNov 21: 3 Day Sigprop on whether or not to incorporate\nNov 24: 7 Day Coreprop with elections \nDec 2 - DAO Foundation directors confirmed/elected\nDec 14 - DAO Foundation officially launched with 9 directors\nDec 16 - DAO Treasury multisig transfers to the Foundation\nQ2 2023 - Diamond Contracts transfer to Foundation\n\n**Benefits of Formation**\n- Independence; greater separation of Pixelcraft Studios from AavegotchiDAO\n- Board can execute proposals on behalf of the DAO (Liquidity provision, GHST staking, funding Dework, etc.)\n\n**Risks of Formation**\n- More responsibility on AavegotchiDAO governance\n- More exposure to any future policy shifts specifically in the Cayman Islands jurisdiction\n\nThis completes the proposal. I look forward to your consideration and vote!\n",

      "title": "Changing Altar Intervals to Help Combat The Alchemica Issuance Problem ",
      "content": "Author: Quincy1971\nGotchiID: 5375\nQuorum requirement: 20% (9M)\nVote duration: 7 days\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/a-3rd-option-to-the-alchemica-issuance-problem/4538?u=quincy19711\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThere have been a few approaches that have been mentioned from drastically cutting the percentages that gotchi receive from channeling to ending channeling all together. All these approaches have their merits by attacking the major contributor to token supply increase, which at this time is channeling. I however would like to propose another solution that addresses the increasing minting trajectory and at the same time the proverbial elephant in the room, the now locked spillover.\n\nPROPOSAL\n\nTo increase the intervals of all the altar levels without decreasing the spillage percentage and the stoppage of minting new tokens. I propose that we start using the spillover wallet that contains the already minted alchemica to fund channeling until the Gotchiverse has better, sustainable sinks or the wallet can no longer support channeling in this way. I propose that the DAO in No Later Than 90 days revisits this to make any changes, if needed.\n\nPROPOSED CHANGES\n\nOld Intervals VS Proposed Intervals\nLevel 9 every 1 hrs … Level 9 every 1.5 hrs\nLevel 8 every 2 hrs … Level 8 every 3 hrs\nLevel 7 every 3 hrs … Level 7 every 5 hrs\nLevel 6 every 4 hrs … Level 6 every 7 hrs\nLevel 5 every 6 hrs … Level 5 every 9 hrs\nLevel 4 every  8 hrs … Level 4 every 12 hrs\nLevel 3 every 12 hrs … Level 3 every 18 hrs\nLevel 2 every 18 hrs … Level 2 every 24 hrs\nLevel 1 every 24 hrs … Level 1 every 36 hrs\n\nThis change helps the ecosystem by:\n(1) addressing the overall supply of alchemica tokens by stopping its further minting of new tokens via channeling.\n(2) addresses the issuance of tokens by limiting how much is being claimed daily. These changes cause a ripple effect that would make more gotchi channel on the lower level altars further affecting issuance.\n(3) start using the collected spillover to effectively release its potential sell pressure by addressing the “What are we going to do about the collected spillover?” in a way that helps the game economy. \n\nQuestions/Concerns\n(1) As a landowner, it feels like this somehow takes my spillover from my parcels. The majority of the alchemica in the combined spillover wallet has come from gotchi channeling.\n(2) Why would this be any better than just changing all the altars spillover percentage? Changing the spillover percentage is indeed an option but it would also mean that players would be still channeling at the old intervals but for less alchemica. Once you added in the cost of the transaction, in some cases, it would actually cost YOU to channel.\n(3) Would it not be easier to just stop channeling altogether? Yes it would be the easiest option, however, channeling was the major \"selling point\" that brought a lot of investors into the community and its loss would affect a large portion of asset holders. Channeling, or UBI, started off as a \"filler\" that provided both (a) activity in the Gotchiverse while (b) providing a way for asset holders to earn while awaiting land mining to go live. Unfortunately, some changes were made that made channeling more profitable than mining land parcels, especially for non-spacious parcel owners.",

      "title": "[Replaces AGIP49] Temporarily Disable Channeling - Alternate Economic Proposal ",
      "content": "**Author:** coderdan#8904 on the DAO Forum (re-posted as a SigProp on by jarrod | aavegotchistats.com#9686)\n\n**Gotchi ID:** 8364 (or one of coderdan's gotchis if he wants the XP)\n\n**Discourse Thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/alternate-economic-proposal-temporarily-disable-channeling/4495\n\nI am re-posting the proposal outlined by coderdan on the DAO forum to Snapshot as a SigProp as people have expressed interest in voting for this as an alternative to [AGIP49] Adjust Aaltar Spillover Rates.\n\nIf this passes SigProp and CoreProp votes this would **REPLACE** the solution voted on under [AGIP49] Adjust Aaltar Spillover Rates. \n\nThe following is a re-post of the Aavegotchi DAO Forum post created by coderdan. It contains 4 proposed changes in it marked [1], [2], [3], and [4].\n\n**Introduction**\n\nA good game economy aims to balance its sources (inflation) and sinks (deflation) and frequently adjusts mechanics to do so.\n\nIn a Web3 game, extra care must be taken to ensure that these balance changes do not significantly affect the developmental plans of the players involved.\n\nCurrently, the Gotchiverse has two main sources — Alchemical Channeling, and Farming. New supply added from Alchemical Channeling far outpaces that of Harvesting, and together combined, the sources outpace sinks by a ratio of roughly 10:1.\n\nI believe it is necessary to take some action to bring these ratios closer back to equilibrium.\n\n**Note: This proposal would replace the current proposal by Mark/Fantasma.**\n\n**Proposal**\n\nMy proposal is as follows:\n\n[1] Disable Alchemical Channeling completely, except for one full day during the week (likely Saturday, to coincide with hangouts). Spillover would be enabled for Alchemical channeling. This will drastically cut the inflation coming from Alchemical Channeling, immediately bringing the S-S equilibrium closer to 1.  This would be re-visited in three months and adjusted accordingly.\n\n[2] Enable spillover for Reservoirs 24/7. Alchemica stored inside parcels is limited and land owners should have a claim to the Alchemica stored inside.\n\n[3] Allow 100% refund for demolishing Altars. Since this is a large adjustment, we should allow parcel owners to update their strategies accordingly with no penalty.\n\n[4] Boost movement speed and hit points for high kinship Gotchis. Since high kinship is tied to Alchemical Channeling yield, without Alchemical Channeling this mechanism would no longer function. Additional movement speed and HP would allow high kinship Gotchis to excel at Alchemica gathering. This mechanic may or may not be permanent, but would be active during this three-month period.\n\nAs mentioned in the points above, this proposal would last for three months after being implemented, and the sources-to-sinks ratio would be monitored during this time. A proposal would be made during the last two weeks detailing the success or failure of the implementation, and steps to proceed after it expires.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Addressing some criticisms**\n\n**What about gameplay? Without channeling, the Gotchiverse will be empty!**\n\nPVE / PVP gameplay is on the way frens. You can see the progress we are making after yesterday’s demo. We are not worried about the Gotchiverse becoming a “ghost town” at this point. When the time is right and conditions are optimal, it is easy to attract players.\n\n**Why 100% refund for Altars? Will that lead to a bank run?**\n\nA 100% refund for Altars is necessary because some players who planned their strategy around Alchemical Channeling on multiple parcels will be negatively affected by this patch. With such a drastic change in game rules, it makes sense to allow them to restructure without penalty.\n\nAs for the bank run scenario, if all the LE Golden Altars and Altars that have ever been minted were burned today, the total would be roughly 25M FUD, 19M FOMO, 11M ALPHA, and 3.3M KEK.\n\nThe REALM Diamond currently contains 83M FUD, 45M FOMO, 20M ALPHA, and 7M KEK, a large surplus over that total amount.\n\n**What about bots?**\n\nWe recently implemented an API called Jigger that helps catch bots. Other P2E games are using it, and so far it has had pretty good results at catching bot daddies.\n\nAddresses flagged by Jigger can use Proof of Humanity to get a SBT, similar to how GovernorDAO works. But you only need to verify if your address is flagged.\n\nThe cartridge contracts have also been completed and are waiting for Gotchiverse UI implementation. We are planning to deploy them within this three month period and monitor performance.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nI strongly believe that if the DAO wants to deploy a solution for bringing sinks and sources back into equilibrium, we should go to the root cause, which currently is Alchemical Channeling. It is clear that the demand side of our economy is not strong enough to support this mechanic yet, and we must maintain flexibility in this crucial time of the Gotchiverse. Minor changes such as those currently proposed do not address the root cause, and also sow division in the community without offering any olive branches.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Appendix: Some calculations**\n\nAs a DAO we should strive to back up our proposals with onchain data. Here are the forecasted before/after effects of this proposal, if implemented today.\n\n**Current**\n\nChanneling (spillover deducted):\n\n616,000 FUD\n308,000 FOMO\n154,000 ALPHA\n61,600 KEK\n\nChanneling (including spillover):\n\n919,214 FUD\n459,607 FOMO\n229,804 ALPHA\n91,922 KEK\n\nHarvesting (not deducting spillover):\n\n236681 FUD total generated\n151832 FOMO total generated\n53720 ALPHA total generated\n12722 KEK total generated\n\nActual Harvesting (Spillover deducted)\n\n182851 FUD (23% spillover)\n115051 FOMO (25% spillover)\n39101 ALPHA (28% spillover)\n10116 KEK (21% spillover)\n\nTotal Daily Inflation\n\n798,851 FUD\n423,051 FOMO\n193,101 ALPHA\n71,716 KEK\n\n**After Proposal Implementation (Forecasted)**\n\nAssuming no new Altars, Harvesters, Reservoirs built\n\nChanneling (original values divided by 7)\n\n131316 FUD\n65658 FOMO\n32,829 ALPHA\n13,131 KEK\n\nHarvesting (including spillover)\n\n236681 FUD\n151832 FOMO\n53720 ALPHA\n12722 KEK\n\nTotal Daily Inflation After Changes (Forecast)\n\n367,997 FUD ( -54%)\n217,490 FOMO (-49%)\n86549 ALPHA (-56%)\n25853 KEK (-64%)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDaily new supply would be reduced by 54%, 49%, 56%, and 64% for FUD, FOMO, ALPHA, KEK respectively if this proposal were implemented.",

It's clear that our economy cannot handle the amount of tokens being currently issued. Therefore, we have come up with a proposal to increase spillover rate in lower level aaltars to help reduce the amount of alchemica being issued and encourage frens to upgrade their aaltars. We believe this will stabilize the economy until more alchemica sinks are introduced in the eagerly anticipated combat release.\n\nThe following table shows the Daily FUD inflation rate caused by chanelling, broken down by aaltar level. You can see the current inflation levels and spillover rates, our new proposed spillover rates and the reduction in inflation this will cause.\n \n![a53e3864a04692463a81f33fca8e73c35941db9d-2.png](ipfs://bafkreic3zdxesyhq523yitay522s2pvwqkcirtcjknlu5gbp25pqgvzhm4)\n\nWe believe these measures are necessary given current economic conditions but we are always free as a DAO to change them at a later date in light of new information or more alchemica sinks being introduced.\n",

To prevent gotchi owners from channeling their gotchis while they are listed for rent on the aavegotchi site. The reason for this is that we saw at least a few instances of owners listing their gotchis for rent then immediately after channeling. What would happen was that an unexpecting player would check the rental market after the gotchi was rented but before it got channeled and would then be stuck renting a channeled gotchi. The owner would get the channeling alchemica as well as the rental fees from the borrower.\n\nThis hasn’t been a widespread issue yet because not many people are maliciously doing it, it also needs to be timed well with someone checking the rental market at the wrong moment. But I don’t believe there is any benefit to allowing owners the ability to make use of this exploit.\n\nAs per Dan on the thread, the implementation is ready so it won’t require anymore dev time, there just happened to be some minor pushback on this idea so the devs don’t want to implement it without a vote.\n",

At large, this effort has been also a means to share with the broader Aavegotchi DAO public how the process has previously worked between WTF and Pixelcraft i.e. a volunteer-dependent process, that nonetheless can achieve great things for the ecosystem by harnessing the different talents and creativity of all of our frens.\n",

Godlikes and pets will additionally require essence which is obtained by sacrificing a gotchi. Wearables can be smelted back into Aalloys + schematic + Frame +-essence at the Forge. Wearables can only be forged if the user has all of the underlying components. There is an alchemica cost for Forging and success can be determined by the smithing skill. It will feel challenging to successfully forge a Godlike which will require high smithing skill + all underlying components. Successful smithing will increase your smithing skill. It will cost more Aalloy to forge a wearable than will be obtained when melting it down. This will serve as an Aalloy burn which will reduce the potential building blocks of wearables. This can serve as a deflationary mechanic on the wearable market.\n\nThe Forge allows all wearables to be turned into their base components which can then be reused to craft new wearables. This creates fluidity in the wearable market by allowing users to craft new wearables or break down ones they don’t use into useful parts. Breaking down wearables into base components abstracts specific aspects of wearables into designated tokens that can be granularly controlled. This allows for more wearable designs and trait combinations with introduction of schematics without net dilution. Alloys allow for wearables to be turned into other wearables with different traits, creates fluidity in the market and provides much needed equity in traits. Frames serve as the lever for scarcity for which emissions will be controlled by the DAO. Each wearable is composed of its underlying Aalloy, its schematic, and its frame.\n\nAll current wearables are “complete wearables” and can be smelted into these components. The separate components allow sufficient levers to design healthy engagement loops, introduce more wearables, and have potential loot/player rewards. Additionally, it allows for a Smithing mechanic in the gotchiverse to increase overall experience in the gotchiverse. It creates an even stronger bond between the user and their wearables since they were forged (or even designed) by the user. It also creates opportunities for deflationary mechanics on each component that can be modified as needed to maximize player experience and asset value. While there would be many mechanics introduced, the base idea of crafting is familiar to MMORPG players.\n\nThere will be multiple primary decision points that need DAO approval. The DAO forge team will work through various mechanics and propose a series of signal propositions to the DAO for consideration. These propositions will include a recommendation and the underlying models to understand the impact of the decisions. The Forge team will work diligently to include community feedback and create the Forge in a maximally transparent way. The forge idea has already morphed significantly since its inception and I expect it to continue to evolve before and even after implementation.\n\nPlease see the attached documents for more information and please feel welcome and encouraged to leave comments or message me directly for feedback. Thank you for the consideration\n\nDW\n",

While this proposal is certainly related to the discussion, it is NOT a proposal to make GHST a free floating token. Let me elaborate...\n\n**Problem**\n\nFor the people not super familiar with the entire MakerDAO debate, you can get a long-form summary here. In short, there is a lot of uncertainty concerning the regulation of decentralized smart contracts (Tornado Cash) and stablecoins. Since GHST is closely tied to DAI's value, we need to monitor those developments very closely. If anything happens to DAI, our entire treasury (and GHST's stability) is at risk.\n\nIn this proposal I want to define the potential cases of emergency and the actions the multisig currently managing the GHST Bonding Curve on Ethereum mainnet needs to take to mitigate risks. Again, as long as DAI works as intended, this proposal does not suggest messing with the Curve - that is a completely separate discussion\n\n**Emergency Scenarios**\n\nDAI loses dollar peg: As long as USDC backing is intact, no action needed. Signers should however set alerts for $0.95 and $0.90 to be notified of a potential depeg so they're able to act immediately as the situation unrolls.\nMakerDAO shifts away from a dollar backing: Very long-term strategic consideration, will probably take 2-3 years to unfold. No immediate action needed, more relevant for the discussion surrounding a general Curve shutdown.\nThis is the important one. MakerDAO contracts get blacklisted by Circle (USDC) due to regulatory reasons: Signers would have to act immediately to protect the value of GHST's backing. I propose immediately shutting down the Curve and swapping the DAI for USDC. This ensures that we lock in some of our treasury's value, it does however remove the main source of liquidity for GHST. To make sure GHST doesn't enter a free fall, $5M worth of USDC should immediately be paired with $5M worth of treasury GHST in our main Quickswap pool.\n\nUsing the current numbers, this would leave us with ~$18M USDC - the majority of which should be used to buy back the paired GHST and build up a larger LP position. The initial LP position would double our current pool and buy enough time to decide on next steps.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a very unlikely emergency scenario. We should be prepared for everything though, getting caught with our pants down could wipe out a large sum of our treasury value and put GHST in a very vulnerable position.",

      "content": "Author: Dr Wagmi#6629\nGotchi ID: 16635\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/the-forge-aalloys-essence-and-smithing-a-massive-proposal/4432/48\nForge Litepaper: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sKEmMJcwAfmIsysr1NP2D-EGvxKBtzZls7iDtM6gGXg/edit?usp=sharing\n\nAalloy will serve as the tokenization of the entire wearables market. It is one of the key ingredients in Forging and allows for fluid movement between wearables of different traits and rarities. This proposal seeks to clarify how much Aalloy will be required to Forge wearables of the 6 different rarity tiers. The Forge team proposes that we employ the FRENS ratio for Aalloy requirement which would require the following amounts of Aalloy to forge each rarity tier:\n\n  \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigg7rqfwilb4zaoozimvfl3kxpsudpzdntb76suuexy4wfv6c3lzi)\n    \n\nFor context, wearables have been distributed using multiple methodologies, two of which had built-in ratios. 52.6% of all wearables have been distributed via raffles utilizing the FRENS ratio, 24.3% via the Maall sales which had different value ratios than FRENS, 18.6% via GBM which utilized market value, and the other 4.5% via miscellaneous methodologies (Aagent/OKEX). Utilizing the FRENS ratio will likely provide the most intuitive and smooth user experience as the majority of wearables were distributed using this methodology. It provides a balance between utilizing Item Cap ratios which would only require 200 commons worth of alloy to forge a godlike and the Maall ratio which would require 2,000 commons worth of Aalloy. The marginal value for valuable slots and rarity tiers will be captured by Frames with some, but likely less, captured by the corresponding schematic. See the “Distribution Ratios” tab of the Forge Google Sheet for comparison between the Distribution ratios and their corresponding GHST/Aalloy estimate : (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fFPZr2QE1ngpGbnfQQQS1gDxWLvMVJ6j7iNTwjtzrmU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiaoe72ptbvlg3d6cmlrlf4tquj2emf6lw72qpg6nwsxpub73irlkm)\n    \n\nThis is one of a series of signal proposals necessary in creating and deploying the Forge. These signal proposals will shape the direction and creation of Forge mechanics and be combined into a Core Proposal after the Forge is complete and ready to deploy if the DAO accepts. Some essential design decisions have received broad support from the community and Forge creators and will not be submitted for a DAO Signal Proposal.

      "title": "The Forge - Fee structure and establishing burn %, DAO %",
      "content": "Author: Dr Wagmi#6629\nGotchi ID: 16635\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/the-forge-aalloys-essence-and-smithing-a-massive-proposal/4432/48\nForge Litepaper: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sKEmMJcwAfmIsysr1NP2D-EGvxKBtzZls7iDtM6gGXg/edit?usp=sharing\n\nAs part of the Forging process, more Aalloy will be required to Forge than will be returned to the Smith when the smelt their wearable. Our initial recommendation is for a 10% reduction in Aalloy returned to the user on Smelting. As an example, a common will cost 100 Aalloy to Forge but would only return 90 Aalloy to the user when smelted. This provides the ability for a deflationary mechanic or for Aalloy to be accrued by the DAO for utilization throughout the ecosystem. If all the Aalloy is burnt, this will provide a ~10% burn ratio of all Aalloy in the forging process and establish strong deflationary pressure. This leaves no Aalloy for the DAO, however. As Aalloy represents tokenization of the entire wearables market, it will provide powerful utility as a reward mechanism for players or a non-dilutionary revenue stream for the DAO in the future should the DAO seek to issue its own wearables using accrued Aalloy.\n\nThe Forge team recommends a balance between the two approaches with 5% of Aalloy being burnt and 5% of Aalloy being sent to the DAO wallet. This will ensure a deflationary impact of the mechanic while also providing the DAO flexibility moving forward. This number can be modified by future DAO vote to meet the needs of the ecosystem. \n\nSpecial Note: A base 100 system that requires 100 Aalloy to Forge a common is necessary to allow flexibility with this fee in the smart contracts. The previous sig prop outlined a base 10 system which would not have afforded this flexibility. While the base has been increased to 100 from 10, the underlying ratios for consideration remain unchanged.\n\nThis is one of a series of signal proposals necessary in creating and deploying the Forge. These signal proposals will shape the direction and creation of Forge mechanics and be combined into a Core Proposal after the Forge is complete and ready to deploy if the DAO accepts. Some essential design decisions have received broad support from the community and Forge creators and will not be submitted for a DAO Signal Proposal. If anyone in the community would like to make a separate signal proposal shaping Forge design, they are welcome to do so. The following are the design assumptions which will be implemented in the Forge unless an external Signal Proposal decides otherwise:\n-\tEssence will not be airdropped to those who have previously sacrificed gotchis\n-\tFace, eye, and pet wearables will be codified as less abundant per the Framework. The Framework will be a separate DAO proposal outlining Frame distribution\n-\tThe Forge will not be a Gotchiverse installation\n-\tNo individual trait will or should be codified as less abundant\n-\tThe Forge will have an initial 10% Aalloy fee. This can be adjusted by future DAO proposal\n-\tAalloy, Essence, and Schematics will be ERC-1155 tokens\n-\tAll gotchis will provide an equal 1000 essence when sacrificed\n-\tEssence will not be returned to the user after smelting a pet or Godlike wearable\n-\tThe schematic will be returned after smelting a wearable \n\nThanks again – The Forge Team\n",

      "content": "Authors: Mark#4094, Fantasma#1777\nGotchi IDs: 16559, 2824\n\nHello frens,\n\nThere's been a lot debate in the DAO this week around alchemica inflation. It's clear that our economy cannot handle the amount of tokens being currently issued. Therefore, we have come up with a proposal to increase spillover rate in lower level aaltars to help reduce the amount of alchemica being issued and encourage frens to upgrade their aaltars. We believe this will stabilize the economy until more alchemica sinks are introduced in the eagerly anticipated combat release.\n\nThe following table shows the Daily FUD inflation rate caused by chanelling, broken down by aaltar level. You can see the current inflation levels and spillover rates, our new proposed spillover rates and the reduction in inflation this will cause. \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiab6fhzlxujtovvx4sge6zxa7kfikb2q265htk76ft4lqfdgklrse)\n    \nWe believe these measures are necessary given current economic conditions but we are always free as a DAO to change them at a later date in light of new information or more alchemica sinks being introduced.",

Godlikes and pets will additionally require essence which is obtained by sacrificing a gotchi. Wearables can be smelted back into Aalloys + schematic + Frame +-essence at the Forge. Wearables can only be forged if the user has all of the underlying components. There is an alchemica cost for Forging and success can be determined by the smithing skill. It will feel challenging to successfully forge a Godlike which will require high smithing skill + all underlying components. Successful smithing will increase your smithing skill. It will cost more Aalloy to forge a wearable than will be obtained when melting it down. This will serve as an Aalloy burn which will reduce the potential building blocks of wearables. This can serve as a deflationary mechanic on the wearable market.\n\nThe Forge allows all wearables to be turned into their base components which can then be reused to craft new wearables. This creates fluidity in the wearable market by allowing users to craft new wearables or break down ones they don’t use into useful parts. Breaking down wearables into base components abstracts specific aspects of wearables into designated tokens that can be granularly controlled. This allows for more wearable designs and trait combinations with introduction of schematics without net dilution. Alloys allow for wearables to be turned into other wearables with different traits, creates fluidity in the market and provides much needed equity in traits. Frames serve as the lever for scarcity for which emissions will be controlled by the DAO. Each wearable is composed of its underlying aalloy, its schematic, and its frame. \n\nAll current wearables are “complete wearables” and can be smelted into these components. The separate components allow sufficient levers to design healthy engagement loops, introduce more wearables, and have potential loot/player rewards. Additionally, it allows for a Smithing mechanic in the gotchiverse to increase overall experience in the gotchiverse. It creates an even stronger bond between the user and their wearables since they were forged (or even designed) by the user. It also creates opportunities for deflationary mechanics on each component that can be modified as needed to maximize player experience and asset value. While there would be many mechanics introduced, the base idea of crafting is familiar to MMORPG players. \n\nThere will be multiple primary decision points that need DAO approval. The DAO forge team will work through various mechanics and propose a series of signal propositions to the DAO for consideration. These propositions will include a recommendation and the underlying models to understand the impact of the decisions. The Forge team will work diligently to include community feedback and create the Forge in a maximally transparent way. The forge idea has already morphed significantly since its inception and I expect it to continue to evolve before and even after implementation. \n\nPlease see the attached documents for more information and please feel welcome and encouraged to leave comments or message me directly for feedback. Thank you for the consideration\n\nDW\n\n",

Further, I propose that we do not stake corresponding LP tokens for GLTR.\n\nThe benefits of adding liquidity are multiple:\n\nAllows for lower slippage trading which will attract more trading and investment\nLegitimizes the Aavegotchi ecosystem, its farming, and the native tokens\nSupports land investors and, more specifically, those actively farming their land\nAllows the DAO to earn trading fees on the liquidity provided\n\nThere are also some risks which should be considered:\n\nImpermanent loss may decrease the net dollar value of DAO treasury funds\nAsks a difficult question of whether or not to stake LP tokens for GLTR and compete directly against community stakers for rewards\nPaying for liquidity is an expense in our ecosystem. In the long term, revenue must outweigh expenses for the Aavegotchi economy to thrive and assets to gain value. We should seriously consider our expenses vs revenues moving forward as we incentivize liquidity, hence the recent passed proposal to terminate FRENS which will both decrease expenses and allow NFT distributions to generate revenues\n\nThere is currently only $732,000 TOTAL in liquidity among the four alchemica-GHST pairs. Anything above a 1500 GHST swap has a price impact >1% which is not acceptable for a GameFi blue chip looking to instill investor confidence and attract new, large builders. Let’s bolster liquidity now and develop a sustainable and predictable plan to continue to add DAO liquidity at an, ideally, expense neutral rate. We can partner with the incoming DAO Project Manager(s) and community bounty hunters to further define DAO revenues and expenses to formulate our liquidity plan.\n \n![2022-10-10 13_56_59-bafkreia2x4chhhwtvkyuuofndnuzz4eevrqh7pnpwgfebf7znuyvrflteq (500×363) - Brave.png](ipfs://bafkreihi2ltiiks2p6t56n3qg2zxgp3atsjme5ijrd274z6e6ljlczc7jy)\n\nI have included amounts of 50k GHST + matching alchemica and 30k GHST + matching alchemica as well as an option to add zero DAO liquidity.

      "title": "Bonding Curve Emergency Plan",
      "content": "**Author:** MoonGotchi#1234\n**GotchiID:** 3541\n**Discourse Thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/bonding-curve-emergency-plan/4397\n\nHello fellow GHST enjoyooors,\n\nMy post about the Bonding Curve has sparked an interesting discussion about GHST's future and a potential shutdown of our well-known stability mechanism. While this proposal is certainly related to the discussion, it is **NOT** a proposal to make GHST a free floating token. Let me elaborate...\n\n**Problem**\n\nFor the people not super familiar with the entire MakerDAO debate, you can get a long-form summary [here](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/the-path-of-compliance-and-the-path-of-decentralization-why-maker-has-no-choice-but-to-prepare-to-free-float-dai/17466). In short, there is a lot of uncertainty concerning the regulation of decentralized smart contracts (Tornado Cash) and stablecoins. Since GHST is closely tied to DAI's value, we need to monitor those developments very closely. If anything happens to DAI, our entire treasury (and GHST's stability) is at risk.\n\nIn this proposal I want to define the potential cases of emergency and the actions the multisig currently managing the GHST Bonding Curve on Ethereum mainnet needs to take to mitigate risks. Again, as long as DAI works as intended, this proposal does not suggest messing with the Curve - that is a completely separate discussion\n\n**Emergency Scenarios**\n\n1. DAI loses dollar peg: As long as USDC backing is intact, no action needed. Signers should however set alerts for $0.95 and $0.90 to be notified of a potential depeg so they're able to act immediately as the situation unrolls. \n2. MakerDAO shifts away from a dollar backing: Very long-term strategic consideration, will probably take 2-3 years to unfold. No immediate action needed, more relevant for the discussion surrounding a general Curve shutdown.\n3. **This is the important one.** MakerDAO contracts get blacklisted by Circle (USDC) due to regulatory reasons: Signers would have to act immediately to protect the value of GHST's backing. I propose immediately shutting down the Curve and swapping the DAI for USDC. This ensures that we lock in some of our treasury's value, it does however remove the main source of liquidity for GHST. To make sure GHST doesn't enter a free fall, $5M worth of USDC should immediately be paired with $5M worth of treasury GHST in our main Quickswap pool. \n\nUsing the current numbers, this would leave us with ~$18M USDC - the majority of which should be used to buy back the paired GHST and build up a larger LP position. The initial LP position would double our current pool and buy enough time to decide on next steps. \n\nKeep in mind that this is a very unlikely **emergency** scenario. We should be prepared for everything though, getting caught with our pants down could wipe out a large sum of our treasury value and put GHST in a very vulnerable position.",

We have a variety of assets as a protocol, some of which have considerable goodwill value such as parcels in the DAO district. We can leverage these assets to better compensate and acknowledge past, current, and prospective contributors. Parallel to this effort, a transparent, stepwise process towards earning a DAO parcel will be designed. Potential pros of using alchemica/minted NFT displays/parcels as compensation:\n\nGives the DAO more options in reimbursing contributors\nLeverages assets outside of GHST\nDevelops and promotes a contributor/builder culture specifically inside the gotchiverse\nMay have potential cascade effect where contributors build and develop their earned parcels, keeping assets within the ecosystem\nFosters building and development in the DAO district which should hopefully be a spotlight of activity in the gotchiverse.\n\nAn example of contributor compensation would be a DAO parcel with a LE NFT display and custom NFT – an incredibly meaningful and valuable token of appreciation for DAO contributions.\n\nThe specific parcels will be defined in the core proposition if this signal proposition passes. Feedback and ideas on specific parcel allocation is appreciated and should be directed to the included DAO discourse thread above. If the DTF is absorbed by the new DAO structure, the parcels and alchemica can be sent to the same multisig holding the DTF budget funds.\n\nDW\n",

      "content": "Author: Xeko#4950\nGotchi ID# 19086\nThread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/preventing-gotchis-listed-for-rental-from-being-able-to-channel/4388/56\n\nThe idea here is fairly simple. To prevent gotchi owners from channeling their gotchis while they are listed for rent on the aavegotchi site. The reason for this is that we saw at least a few instances of owners listing their gotchis for rent then immediately after channeling. What would happen was that an unexpecting player would check the rental market after the gotchi was rented but before it got channeled and would then be stuck renting a channeled gotchi. The owner would get the channeling alchemica as well as the rental fees from the borrower.\n\nThis hasn’t been a widespread issue yet because not many people are maliciously doing it, it also needs to be timed well with someone checking the rental market at the wrong moment. But I don’t believe there is any benefit to allowing owners the ability to make use of this exploit.\n\nAs per Dan on the thread, the implementation is ready so it won’t require anymore dev time, there just happened to be some minor pushback on this idea so the devs don’t want to implement it without a vote.",

We have a variety of assets as a protocol, some of which have considerable goodwill value such as parcels in the DAO district. We can leverage these assets to better compensate and acknowledge past, current, and prospective contributors. Parallel to this effort, a transparent, stepwise process towards earning a DAO parcel will be designed. Potential pros of using alchemica/minted NFT displays/parcels as compensation:\n•\tGives the DAO more options in reimbursing contributors\n•\tLeverages assets outside of GHST\n•\tDevelops and promotes a contributor/builder culture specifically inside the gotchiverse\n•\tMay have potential cascade effect where contributors build and develop their earned parcels, keeping assets within the ecosystem\n•\tFosters building and development in the DAO district which should hopefully be a spotlight of activity in the gotchiverse. \n\nAn example of contributor compensation would be a DAO parcel with a LE NFT display and custom NFT – an incredibly meaningful and valuable token of appreciation for DAO contributions.\n\nThe specific parcels will be defined in the core proposition if this signal proposition passes. Feedback and ideas on specific parcel allocation is appreciated and should be directed to the included DAO discourse thread above. If the DTF is absorbed by new DAO structure, the parcels and alchemica can be sent to the same multisig holding the DTF budget funds.\n\nDW\n\n",

      "content": "Author: TommyGotchi\nGotchiID: 19131\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/re-spec-your-spirit-points/2486\n\nLittle History:\nGotchis can earn spirit points from aging and gaining XP. Since the first haunt it wasn’t totally flushed out how points would be interpreted in the gotchiverse. Recently we’ve gotten more clarity from the gotchiverse bible and DAO conversations with Pixelcraft. Until this time gotchi owners have been allocating earned spirit points in order to increase their gotchis BRS and climb the BRS leaderboard.\n\nMistakes have been made:\nThere has been a basic misunderstanding of the BRS trait curve and the BRS calculation formula. Players have miss allocated their earned points which resulted in lowered their gotchi’s BRS. Currently there is no “undo”. There needs to be a way to allow gotchi owners to reallocate earned points.\n\nProposal:\nNew Spirit Respecification Potion, this potion would rollback the gotchi’s spirit points to when it was summoned and unallocating their earned points. The gotchi’s earned points can be reallocated. This would allow gotchi owners to fix past mistakes. It would also allow owners to better align their gotchi traits with wearables and wearable sets. \n\nThe gotchi owner would receive in their wallet one free potion per gotchi at time of snapshot (snapshot to be determined by Pixelcraft). Unsummoned gotchis would not get a potion since they have no earned spirit points. Currently around 20K summoned gotchis. \n\nAirdrop example:\nIf a gotchi owner has 10 gotchis in their wallet at the time of the snapshot, they would receive 10 potions at the time of the airdrop.\n\nPotion example:\nA gotchi has earned 10 spirit points by aging and acquiring XP. The owner decides to put them all on Brain Size, thinking they are building an effective long range fighter, but realize in the gotchiverese their other traits are underpowered. They could consume a respec potion and reallocate their 10 earned spirit points. Maybe put 4 on Brain Size and 6 on Energy. \n\nThis potion would be eligible to be listed in the baazaar just like Kinship and XP potions. \n\nWhy airdrop? This is an added value to gotchi owners. It provides a “undo” for past allocation mistakes, and gives gotchi buyers a way to undo previous gotchi’s owners mistakes. A potion being bought and sold in the baazaar allows for market price discovery, and can provide fees in the baazaar to fund future rarity farming events. \n",

FRENS emissions have been used as a liquidity mining (LM) incentive by providing GHST holders and liquidity providers access to future content through the raffle system. While this was an initially effective tool for LM, it is now doing more harm than good. Outlined below and in the forum thread are the reasons why Aavegotchi should sunset FRENS:\n\nI propose that we alter GLTR emissions to optimize GHST liquidity and support the sunsetting of FRENS as outlined in the “Sunset FRENS” signal proposal here: https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/0x0ad57c0cffa815efcc3f41afac774245777f4bae11fee8d0c0ea956ce34a2427.\n\nThe above proposal and this one will accomplish the following:\n\n- Retire the GHST-QUICK liquidity pool liquidity mining rewards (currently FRENS)\n- Retire the GHST-WETH liquidity pool mining rewards (currently FRENS)\n- Retire the GHST-MATIC liquidity pool mining rewards (currently FRENS + GLTR)\n- Add 5% weight to the GHST-USDC LM rewards (taken from GHST-MATIC) for a total of 20%\n- This consolidation will maximize our most successful pool in GHST-USDC. It will eliminate rewards for unpopular pools and help grow our most successful pool. The GHST-WETH pair was borne from the Dinoswap pool which is a failed project. The GHST-MATIC pair is the only one on SushiSwap which is an inactive exchange on Polygon. Neither project offers ongoing LM incentives. The increase in GHST-USDC LM rewards is necessary to offer compensation for the impermanent loss risk incurred by the pair, otherwise single-sided staking for wapGHST will be prioritized and not afford further depth in the GHST-USDC pool.

      "content": "**Author:** Dr Wagmi#6629\n**GotchiID:** 16635\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Discourse Thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/sunset-frens-by-october-1st/4255\n\nI propose that we cease FRENS emissions immediately. FRENS emissions have been used as a liquidity mining (LM) incentive by providing GHST holders and liquidity providers access to future content through the raffle system. While this was an initially effective tool for LM, it is now doing more harm than good. Outlined below and in the forum thread are the reasons why Aavegotchi should sunset FRENS:\n\n- Eliminating FRENS will reduce Aaveogotchi protocol pressure to hold dilutional events by eliminating ongoing “content debt” created by FRENS emissions\n- GHST has alternative staking utility with GLTR liquidity mining\nShifting focus to alchemica/GLTR pairs reallocates LM rewards to asset holders who are more directly providing value to the ecosystem in the form of liquidity vs single-sided GHST staking which provides limited and historically overcompensated value\n- Future content events can generate protocol revenue instead of paying out content debt. This allows for a more sustainable revenue stream for Pixelcraft and the Aavegotchi DAO\n- The value of future content can be captured on-chain with GLTR/Alchemica/GHST instead of off-chain with FRENS\n- Capturing on-chain value of the above native assets will significantly add utility to all tokens\n- Current FRENS and raffle ticket holders must be acknowledged with raffle(s). There are multiple avenues for this which are outlined in the DAO forum thread. The community can design and publicize events to utilize these FRENS which will be an easier task if we stop further emissions and narrow the scope of the raffle with cessation of FRENS’ emissions.\n\nThere will be an additional signal proposal outlining changes to GLTR emissions to support liquidity provision for the GHST token specifically. While the bonding curve is in place, it is important that a sustainable GHST liquidity plan is in place that captures and rewards LPs fairly and sustainably.\n\nDr Wagmi\n",

      "content": "**Authors:** eMM#9638, aargh#7037\n**GotchiIDs:** 23748, 6605 \n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Discourse Threads:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/from-days-to-blocks-modifying-the-new-renting-safeguards/4274\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/anti-botting-limits-on-rentals/4294\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/reform-public-rental-market/4089\n\nUntil recently there have been no limits on the number of gotchis an address can borrow at the same time, either from a whitelist or from the open (non whitelisted) market.\n\nThis was recently changed to a limit of 1 borrowed gotchi on the open market and 1 by default on all whitelists. A whitelist owner can change the number of allowed borrowed gotchis per address using Louper Dev, and soon, through the official UI.\n\nThis change was put in place with no warning as an experiment in anti botting measures. Community members had reported difficulty in securing a gotchi to borrow for channelling, particularly around the 0:00UTC reset time, which has been attributed to bots scraping all the best rental offers before humans get a chance.\n\nThe change has so far seen Gotchigang report an increase in available gotchis to borrow around reset time which is a positive.\n\nOn the negative side, other Gotchigang have reported being unable to fully channel their aaltars due to not being able to rent enough gotchis. This is particularly for borrowers who’ve paid, say, 20ghst for a long term rental and are now stuck with that 1 gotchi and are unable to channel other parcels using other borrowed gotchis. This issue will tend to grow over time as people level up their aaltars and generate more channelling opportunities. The current limit on the open market is a disincentive to levelling up aaltars and purchasing more land for those without enough gotchis who prefer longer term rentals. It could also severely limit the demand for lending out gotchis long term, however it forces people to approach multiple guilds/whitelist owners for spots which is a positive for the social element of the game.\n\nA poll was run in the weekly DAO Hangout by CoderDan with the results suggesting most community members would prefer the allowed number of borrowed gotchis on the open market to reflect the number of parcels a wallet address holds plus 1, so in theory each parcel could be channelled once per day whilst still holding longer term rentals. For single channel rentals this is less of a concern as people can return a gotchi and borrow another as soon as they’ve finished using it.\n\nFurther increasing the borrowing limit up to the number of available channellings per address was suggested by considering aaltar levels as well, but it was deemed too inefficient to be constantly recalculating this number dynamically in the background.\n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/892307846010658856/1008035273168392243\n\nAs this was an experiment, I propose we revert these changes back now and continue to monitor the impacts so we can be clearer on the severity of the botting issue and be more confident in the effectiveness of this solution, whilst voting to implement the below.\n\nOnce this experimental change is reverted, voting for option 1 in this proposal will set in place the following:\n\n- Set a limit on the number of gotchis each address can borrow from the open market equal to the number of parcels in the borrower’s wallet plus 1.\n\nVoting Options:\n\n1. Set the limit on the number of gotchis each address can borrow from the open market equal to the number of parcels in the borrower’s wallet plus 1.\n2. Keep the original unlimited system and do nothing further, allowing unlimited numbers of borrowed gotchis per address both on the open market and through whitelists.\n3. Leave the open rental market to allow unlimited gotchis to be borrowed, but set the default to 1 on all whitelists (and implement the ability for whitelist creators to change the limit per whitelist.)\n4. Use a limit of 1 gotchi per address across whitelists and the open market, while WL owners can adjust the number as seemed appropriate.",

      "title": "Add DAO Liquidity to GHST-Alchemica Pairs",
      "content": "Author: Dr Wagmi#6629\nGotchi IDs: 16635\nDiscourse Thread (Idea/Proposal): https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/add-dao-liquidity-to-ghst-alchemica-pairs/4309 \n\nI propose that the Aavegotchi DAO add 50,000 GHST + matching alchemica liquidity to the GHST-Alchemica pairs. Further, I propose that we do not stake corresponding LP tokens for GLTR. \n\nThe benefits of adding liquidity are multiple:\n-\tAllows for lower slippage trading which will attract more trading and investment\n-\tLegitimizes the Aavegotchi ecosystem, its farming, and the native tokens\n-\tSupports land investors and, more specifically, those actively farming their land\n-\tAllows the DAO to earn trading fees on the liquidity provided\n\nThere are also some risks which should be considered:\n-\tImpermanent loss may decrease the net dollar value of DAO treasury funds\n-\tAsks a difficult question of whether or not to stake LP tokens for GLTR and compete directly against community stakers for rewards\n-\tPaying for liquidity is an expense in our ecosystem. In the long term, revenue must outweigh expenses for the Aavegotchi economy to thrive and assets to gain value. We should seriously consider our expenses vs revenues moving forward as we incentivize liquidity, hence the recent passed proposal to terminate FRENS which will both decrease expenses and allow NFT distributions to generate revenues\n\nThere is currently only $732,000 TOTAL in liquidity among the four alchemica-GHST pairs. Anything above a 1500 GHST swap has a price impact >1% which is not acceptable for a GameFi blue chip looking to instill investor confidence and attract new, large builders. Let’s bolster liquidity now and develop a sustainable and predictable plan to continue to add DAO liquidity at an, ideally, expense neutral rate. We can partner with the incoming DAO Project Manager(s)  \n![DAO Liquidity.png](ipfs://bafkreia2x4chhhwtvkyuuofndnuzz4eevrqh7pnpwgfebf7znuyvrflteq)\n    and community bounty hunters to further define DAO revenues and expenses to formulate our liquidity plan. \n\nI have included amounts of 50k GHST + matching alchemica and 30k GHST + matching alchemica as well as an option to add zero DAO liquidity. Further proposals can be made regarding GLTR pools for which discussion is ongoing in the attached thread.\n\nThank you all,\nDr Wagmi\n\n \n",

      "title": "Change to Lvl 8 & Lvl 9 Aaltars",
      "content": "Author: CryptoGreen\nGotchi Id: 11156\n\nRecommended Altar Level for Spacious is lvl 8 and lvl 9, however out of thousands of Spacious parcels there are only 58 total lvl 8 and lvl 9 altars combined on all spacious parcels so far in the gotchiverse? One would wonder why is that? One could argue its b/c of the price it costs to have lvl 8/9 aaltar but the real reason imo is that its b/c of the structure of the time element on how many times you can channel per day. The current system for lvl 8 altar is that you can channel once every 2 hours which makes it possible to channel 12 times in a 24 hour period. The current system for lvl 9 altar is that you can channel once every hour which makes it possible to channel 24 times in a 24 hour period. Here is where the problem lies, its impossible to be efficient to the max b/c humans need to sleep and so there is no sustainable way where a human can channel 12 times per day with lvl 8 altar, and no way where a human can channel 24 times with a lvl 9 altar with what is implemented currently. This current system also makes it too demanding to manage lvl 8/9 altars and is part of the reason why it is so low in numbers how many lvl 8/9 altars there is in the gotchiverse, although its the recommendation from pixel craft simulations. My proposal would upgrade the current system where more users would be upgrading there Spacious Parcels. How so? By removing the time element. My Proposal is to allow lvl 8 altars to channel up to 12 times in any 24 hour period starting at the 5pm Pst.  And lvl 9 altars to channel up to 24 times in any 24 hour period starting  at the 5pm Pst. The Pros will outweigh the Cons with this new system. \n\nPros: More users will upgrade to lvl 8 and lvl 9 b/c its more efficient and easier to manage assets with no time element restrictions of waiting time to elapse before channeling again. \n\nThe more users upgrade, the more TVL (Total Value Locked) in the system which is a metric used normally in crypto that the higher this number is the healthier the protocol is and worth investing in. \n\nA boost in amount of users upgrading to lvl 8 and lvl 9 on their parcels would make gltr in more demand and burned which would help cut down supply. \n\nOne of the largest benefits in my opinion, even if users didn't own any parcels in the gotchiverse but owned aavegotchis, is that if this proposal gets passed and users upgrade more to lvl 8/9 aaltars will bring much more demand for aavegotchis. Imagine if 100 upgrades happen from lvl 4 altars to lvl 9 altars. That would increase those parcels to channel additional 2100 gotchis just for those 100 altars. As you can see the demand for gotchis could go up dramatically and gotchiverse assets should in theory go upwards if this happens. \n\nCons: With more channeling, alchemica can go down much lower as more quanities are sold. \n\nI have few more ideas that I will believe will give great value to all gotchiverse assets if this proposal passes. \n\nVoting options :\n\n1. Remove time element on lvl 8/9 altars. Allow lvl 8 altar to channel 12 times in a 24 hour period starting at 5pm pst. Allow lvl 9 altar to channel 24 times in a 24 hour period starting at 5pm pst. \n\n2. Do nothing and keep current system . \n\n3. Remove time element across all altars, making it less demanding for users to manage their assets in the gotchiverse. Example instead of just passing proposal for lvl 8/9 altars , do it for all. Example lvl 4 altars can channel 3 times in any 24 hour period after 5pm pst.\n\n4. Another sink for gltr and have the time element eliminated by using gltr fee (must be fairly cheap where it makes sense for users to pay for this service)\n",

      "title": "Setting limits on the number of borrowed gotchis allowed per wallet address",
      "content": "Author: eMM#9638\nGotchi ID: 23748\nDiscourse Threads: \nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/from-days-to-blocks-modifying-the-new-renting-safeguards/4274\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/anti-botting-limits-on-rentals/4294\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/reform-public-rental-market/4089\n\nUntil recently there have been no limits on the number of gotchis an address can borrow at the same time, either from a whitelist or from the open (non whitelisted) market. \n\nThis was recently changed to a limit of 1 borrowed gotchi on the open market and 1 by default on all whitelists. A whitelist owner can change the number of allowed borrowed gotchis per address using Louper Dev, and soon, through the official UI.\n\nThis change was put in place with no warning as an experiment in anti botting measures. Community members had reported difficulty in securing a gotchi to borrow for channelling, particularly around the 0:00UTC reset time, which has been attributed to bots scraping all the best rental offers before humans get a chance.\n\nThe change has so far seen Gotchigang report an increase in available gotchis to borrow around reset time which is a positive.\n\nOn the negative side, other Gotchigang have reported being unable to fully channel their aaltars due to not being able to rent enough gotchis. This is particularly for borrowers who’ve paid, say, 20ghst for a long term rental and are now stuck with that 1 gotchi and are unable to channel other parcels using other borrowed gotchis. This issue will tend to grow over time as people level up their aaltars and generate more channelling opportunities. The current limit on the open market is a disincentive to levelling up aaltars and purchasing more land for those without enough gotchis who prefer longer term rentals. It could also severely limit the demand for lending out gotchis long term, however it forces people to approach multiple guilds/whitelist owners for spots which is a positive for the social element of the game.\n\nA poll was run in the weekly DAO Hangout by CoderDan with the results suggesting most community members would prefer the allowed number of borrowed gotchis on the open market to reflect the number of parcels a wallet address holds plus 1, so in theory each parcel could be channelled once per day whilst still holding longer term rentals. For single channel rentals this is less of a concern as people can return a gotchi and borrow another as soon as they’ve finished using it. \n\nFurther increasing the borrowing limit up to the number of available channellings per address was suggested by considering aaltar levels as well, but it was deemed too inefficient to be constantly recalculating this number dynamically in the background.\n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/892307846010658856/1008035273168392243\n\nAs this was an experiment, I propose we revert these changes back now and continue to monitor the impacts so we can be clearer on the severity of the botting issue and be more confident in the effectiveness of this solution, whilst voting to implement the below. \n\nOnce this experimental change is reverted, voting for option 1 in this proposal will set in place the following:\n\n•\tSet a limit on the number of gotchis each address can borrow from the open market equal to the number of parcels in the borrower’s wallet plus 1.\n\n•\tSet a default limit of 1 borrowed gotchi per address for all existing and new whitelists while giving the whitelist creator the ability to change that limit up to any number.\n\nVoting Options:\n1)\tSet the limit on the number of gotchis each address can borrow from the open market equal to the number of parcels in the borrower’s wallet plus 1 \nAND set a default limit of 1 borrowed gotchi per address for all existing and new whitelists while giving whitelist creators the ability to change that limit up to any number.\n\n2) Revert back to the original unlimited system and do nothing further, allowing unlimited numbers of borrowed gotchis per address both on the open market and through whitelists.\n\n3) Revert back and leave the open rental market to allow unlimited gotchis to be borrowed, but set the default to 1 on all whitelists and implement the ability for whitelist creators to change the limit per whitelist.\n\n4) Do not revert back and leave the current limits of 1 in place across whitelists and the open market (WL owners can still increase the number).\n",

It will eliminate rewards for unpopular pools and help grow our most successful pool. The GHST-WETH pair was borne from the Dinoswap pool which is a failed project. The GHST-MATIC pair is the only one on SushiSwap which is an inactive exchange on Polygon. Neither project offers ongoing LM incentives. The increase in GHST-USDC LM rewards is necessary to offer compensation for the impermanent loss risk incurred by the pair, otherwise single-sided staking for wapGHST will be prioritized and not afford further depth in the GHST-USDC pool.

FRENS emissions have been used as a liquidity mining (LM) incentive by providing GHST holders and liquidity providers access to future content through the raffle system. While this was an initially effective tool for LM, it is now doing more harm than good. Outlined below and in the forum thread are the reasons why Aavegotchi should sunset FRENS:\n-\tEliminating FRENS will reduce Aaveogotchi protocol pressure to hold dilutional events by eliminating ongoing “content debt” created by FRENS emissions\n-\tGHST has alternative staking utility with GLTR liquidity mining\n-\tShifting focus to alchemica/GLTR pairs reallocates LM rewards to asset holders who are more directly providing value to the ecosystem in the form of liquidity vs single-sided GHST staking which provides limited and historically overcompensated value\n-\tFuture content events can generate protocol revenue instead of paying out content debt. This allows for a more sustainable revenue stream for Pixelcraft and the Aavegotchi DAO\n-\tThe value of future content can be captured on-chain with GLTR/Alchemica/GHST instead of off-chain with FRENS\n-\tCapturing on-chain value of the above native assets will significantly add utility to all tokens \n\nCurrent FRENS and raffle ticket holders must be acknowledged with raffle(s). There are multiple avenues for this which are outlined in the DAO forum thread. The community can design and publicize events to utilize these FRENS which will be an easier task if we stop further emissions and narrow the scope of the raffle  with cessation of FRENS’ emissions.\n\nThere will be an additional signal proposal outlining changes to GLTR emissions to support liquidity provision for the GHST token specifically. While the bonding curve is in place, it is important that a sustainable GHST liquidity plan is in place that captures and rewards LPs fairly and sustainably.\n\nDr Wagmi\n\n\n\n \n",

Something the whole community can see and investors can easily digest. A cap based on total live gotchis was proposed, but in truth it does not accurately depict the true usage of assets.\n\nThe community by and large agrees on a budget, however at this moment in time, we don't have the metrics or data to create one. This budget is likely going to come from data such as daily active users (once PvP is live).\n\n**Proposal**\n\nThis proposal is simple and straightforward:\n\n1. No new BRS-based wearables until the DAO votes on a budget\nThat budget will be developed at a later date once the data is available\n2. The idea is to restore investor confidence and allow us to sleep a bit easier at night, knowing that our assets will not suffer from spontaneous dilution.\n\nNote: this proposal does not include aesthetic wearables, new set creations, or set rebalances (such as Link Marine)\n\n**Associated Risks**\n\nI don't see any potential risks for this proposal.\n",

      "content": "**Author**\nnotorious_btc\nGotchi IDs: 15320\n\n**Discourse Thread**\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/setting-a-fixed-cap-on-new-wearables/4211\n\n**Problem**\n\nOver the lifespan of Aavegotchi, we've endured many wearable dilution events which have negatively impacted our community by:\n\n• Loss of investor confidence (and investors)\n• Depreciation of asset values\n• No known schedule for releases, resulting in uncertainty in the markets\n• In bullish conditions, new wearables would be released, capping our upside growth\n\nIt makes sense to have a wearables budget. Something the whole community can see and investors can easily digest. A cap based on total live gotchis was proposed, but in truth it does not accurately depict the true usage of assets.\n\nThe community by and large agrees on a budget, however at this moment in time, we don't have the metrics or data to create one. This budget is likely going to come from data such as daily active users (once PvP is live).\n\n**Proposal**\n\nThis proposal is simple and straightforward:\n\n1. No new BRS-based wearables until the DAO votes on a budget\n\n2. That budget will be developed at a later date once the data is available\n\nThe idea is to restore investor confidence and allow us to sleep a bit easier at night, knowing that our assets will not suffer from spontaneous dilution. \n\nNote: this proposal does not include aesthetic wearables, new set creations, or set rebalances (such as Link Marine)\n\n**Associated Risks**\n\nI don't see any potential risks for this proposal.",

      "title": "State of spillover for harvester release",
      "content": "Author: Mark#4094, HARDKOR#6268\nGotchi ID: 19172, 21107\n\nHello frens,\n\nThe DAO recently voted to disable spillover with a 71% majority due to the game being heavily botted. Bots were taking up considerable developer bandwidth which was delaying the upcoming game features and causing a lot of sell pressure on alchemica prices. Dan recently proposed the Cartridge invite system which, while not a direct solution to botting, does introduce some incentives in attempt to reduce the amount of botters and extractors collecting spillover. Currently we don't know how effective the cartridge proposal would be but the DAO is in agreement that if we were to enable spillover again then then we would need to implement the cartridge proposal in an attempt to reduce the botting issue. If we do decide to implement cartridges then Coderdan would lead the project with a team of solidity and realm developers.\n\nThe choice we have to make with the harvester release coming up mid July is either:\n\na) Keep spillover turned off\n\nOR \n\nb) Turn spillover back on and implement the cartridge system\n\nThe participents of the DAO meeting were fairly split on which choice to make so here's the TLDR to both sides of the argument.\n\nIn favor of keeping spillover turned off:\n- No incentive to bot means no bots\n- No implementation or smart contracts risks from new cartridge system\n- No unintended side effects of a new system (cartridges)\n- No risks to further delays for harvesters\n- Less sell pressure on alchemica from botters/extractors\n- Dev time spent on cartridges can be used for PVP/Traits/SDK instead\n- Doesn't require a community team focused on manually banning bots\n- Allows more time to develop ideas for cartridges/invites and anti botting measures\n\n\nIn favor of turning spillover back on and implementing the cartridge system:\n- Spillage and management of P2E players is a core game mechanic\n- Activity in game and in Discord has been greatly reduced, since we stopped spillage\n- Allows us to test an anti botting solution early\n- Caartridges incentivise owning multiple Gotchis\n- Spillover is an integral part of rewarding player engagement\n- Rental markets are largely funded by spillover",

However, since this core prop was started (20th May) a lot of things have changed:\n\n- Harvester release has been delayed\n- We are in the middle of a bloodbath in the markets\n- LAND prices have dropped 30-70%\n- LAND bazaar volume has dropped 90%\n- There's been huge selling pressure on alchemica prices\n\nDue to these significant changes in the market, its seems right to allow the DAO to have another emergency vote on whether to go ahead with the LAND auction or not as releasing an auction in this market is very likely to drive down assets prices across the ecosystem.\n\nCoderdan confirmed it is viable to stop the auction but we must act quickly frens:\n\n> \"My thoughts are that it's generally not ideal to do a token sale in the middle of a market bloodbath as we are currently experiencing. Assets from all sectors of crypto are down, not just Aavegotchi. We are actually holding fairly strong in comparison. However, the DAO has voted to do this sale, and it passed overwhelmingly, so the DAO will also need to vote to delay it.\"",

      "title": "[AGIP34] AavegotchiDAO <> Pixelcraft Studios 1.75M DAI Token Swap",
      "content": "**Author:** Jesse | gldnXross#6482\n**GotchiID:** 8497\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Discourse Thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/token-swap-1-75m-dai-from-aavegotchidao-for-ghst-from-pixelcraft-studios/3769\n\n**Summary**\nThis proposal aims to swap 1.75 million DAI from AavegotchiDAO’s treasury with an equal value of GHST from Pixelcraft Studios’ balance sheet.\n\n**Rationale**\nThe launch of the Gotchiverse has introduced new and increasing infra costs for Pixelcraft Studios that cannot be paid for in GHST (or any crypto for that matter). These costs primarily consist of usage of AWS and Redis Enterprise for real-time gameplay in the Gotchiverse, and will continue to scale up as the game gets more popular.\n\nTo pay for these costs, we have outlined several options:\n\n- Raise funding from VCs\n- Liquidate GHST into DAI and swap for fiat\n- Use GHST as collateral on Aave to take loans in DAI\n- Perform a token swap with AavegotchiDAO\n\nWe believe Option 4 (Token Swap) is the best available option at the moment. We strongly value our independence from VCs, prefer not to have debt on our balance sheet, and do not want to market sell GHST acquired from sales.\n\nTherefore, we propose a token swap between AavegotchiDAO and Pixelcraft Studios to ensure adequate fiat runway for several years of further development, no matter how bearish the market becomes.\n\n**Key Details**\nAt the time of this writing, AavegotchiDAO treasury holds roughly:\n- 2.5 Million DAI\n- 3.5 Million GHST\n- 3 Million Alchemica\n\n(Live source here: https://app.aavegotchi.com/treasury) \n\n\nPixelcraft Studios, on the other hand, is heavily skewed toward GHST with over 6.7 Million GHST in our primary revenue wallet while our only DAI is coming from the curve’s monthly 150k DAI faucet, 50k of which is already earmarked for GHST purchases.\n\nPixelcraft Studios has been able to effectively grow the team and support infrastructure costs without needing to liquidate any significant amount of GHST. But last month’s launch of the Gotchiverse and anticipated continued growth has pushed operating costs dramatically higher. Server costs for the April playdrop, for example, exceeded 40k USD, and that is projected to grow in the months ahead.\n\nSuch operating expenses are anticipated but we have to acknowledge that these subscriptions and invoices almost always insist on trad banking (fiat). We would prefer to not have to sell GHST in order to achieve the necessary growth budget.\n\nThe DAO’s revenue from the GHST bonding curve opens up the possibility of a large-scale exchange of assets between our two parties. With the game live, GHST off its all time highs, and a DAO treasury that is well established, we believe this is the right time to propose an OTC token swap.\n\nFor the purposes of this token swap, a valuation for GHST that all can agree on must be established. There are many ways to arrive at such, so in the interest of expediency, I am proposing an intuitive method that also tips the scale generously in the DAO’s direction:\n\n**GHST valuation methodology**\nPixelcraft Studios has calculated GHST’s average price from Tuesday, June 14 to Saturday, June 18 (duration of the SigProp via CoinGecko) with a 5% discount applied to the final price: USD 1.28. If DAO voters find the results agreeable, they may vote to approve this CoreProp.\n\n**Execution**\nIf the CoreProp passes, the token swap should process in a predictable way. I suggest the token swap occur with the following method of execution:\n\n- Pixelcraft Studios shall first transfer the agreed upon amount of GHST (defined in the CoreProp) to the AavegotchiDAO treasury wallet.\n- AavegotchiDAO treasury wallet (currently managed via multisig by Pixelcraft team) shall transfer 1.75 million DAI within 8 hours of receiving the GHST to the Pixelcraft Studios primary revenue wallet.\n- Pixelcraft Studios shall make an announcement in Aavegotchi Discord confirming the reception of the DAI, thus concluding the token swap.\n",

A lot of it completely misses the point though, at least in my opinion. I went more in-depth on why I don't believe botting to be the primary problem at the moment in a comment here: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/keeping-the-status-quo-of-disabled-spillover-for-a-while/3845/172\n\nSo I started playing around with the numbers for spillover radius & rate, but I just couldn't find a satisfying solution. Reducing them only by a bit would barely have an effect, while reducing them drastically would devalue high level Aaltars. When I went through the blog post on channeling radius it finally clicked though! The mechanic was right there, just not utilized to its full potential (or at all really): The Hot Zone.\n\n  \n![cdb60288d7d0c96c4c7a5ec3bb767a4174b44326_2_441x375.jpeg](ipfs://QmUntsAfd6SLoj11eMkoMQ7AqiW13krfxrGWyzHb7yKxh5)\n    \n\nIt became obvious pretty quickly that the Hot Zone wasn't so hot after all. The name simply implied that statistically speaking, 10% of the spillover would spawn inside of the inner 10% radius, 20% inside of the inner 20%, etc. This results in a slightly higher drop rate closer to the parcel, but in reality it barely makes a difference (only a single digit % of all spillover spawns in the \"Hot Zone\"). I want to propose allocating a fixed % of the spilled Alchemica based on Aaltar level as outlined in the model below:\n\n \n![8d72bfd571de3af3d94599dfb9f9504b37deab13.png](ipfs://QmSMdQzxv2uU2KQpdrqpoYV6pXjgmjfSWrvERqtpUHzVfe)\n    \n\nCombined with a proposed radius of 60 Gotchis (compared to the 64x32 measurements of a Spacious), dropping a larger amount of Alchemica inside of the Hot Zone would suddenly make spillover feel much more like actual spillover instead of a random token drop around the map. Here's what that would look in-game:\n\n![hot zone radius 60.png](ipfs://QmTXCJyFw9P6NB3XvPozgtrAoLBNR1JN5B2hGjSKB5mX3M)\n\nImo this would:\n\n- Create an interesting mechanic around the concept of spillover (as seen in the OG trailer)\n- Add an incentive for players to pick up their spilled tokens instead of channeling & logging off (and writing off the spillover completely)\n- Reduce the advantage of bots, since picking up spillover becomes less of a grinding & more of a channeling mechanic\n- Overall make the Gotchiverse in its current form more interesting\n\nLastly, I would like to note one thing. This proposal suggests introducing the Hot Zone mechanic as soon as spillover is resumed. However, the reverse is not the case. This proposal is not a vote to turn spillover back on, I merely believe it to be one piece in the larger puzzle",

      "content": "**Author:** Dr Wagmi#6629\n**GotchiID:** 16635\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Discourse Thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/use-dyst-voting-power-for-the-vqi-qi-pool/4010\n\n**Proposal:**\nThe Aavegotchi DAO should use its DYST voting power to support the vQi-Qi pool on DystopiaSwap indefinitely. Any community member can submit an additional signal prop should reallocation be considered.. Indefinite support will avoid overly frequent Sig Prop submissions that are only tangentially related to the Aavegotchi DAO.\n\n**Background:**\nDystopia Swap is an automated market maker with ve(3,3) mechanics which was recently launched on Polygon. They airdropped a big portion of their initial token supply to Polygon dApps including the Aavegotchi protocol, QiDAO, and the GotchiVault. This voting token is used to allocate scheduled rewards similar to QiDAO’s Qi. This means it is up to our Aavegotchi community to decide how to best use our airdropped voting power to support the DeFi aspect for Aavegotchi and GHST. I propose that this voting power be used to support the vQi-Qi pool which secures liquidity and rewards for the ~4M GHST in the vGHST protocol.\n\n**A brief overview of why this is good for GHST:**\n\n1. GHST users deposit their GHST for vGHST using the GotchiVault (3.83M vGHST exist currently)\n2. vGHST can be deposited in QiDAO as collateral for borrowing MAI\n3. Qi rewards are paid to borrowers based on a biweekly vote by Qi holders\n4. Qi that is staked for 4 years has 4x the voting power- this is known as eQi. vQi is a liquid form of eQi that allows holders to sell the token. vQi voting power is always used for vGHST. 5. The current vQi supply is 833k which means 3.3M eQi voting power.\n6. The system requires adequate vQi-Qi liquidity to be sustainable. This vote incentivizes the vQi-Qi pool which will deepen liquidity and create a flywheel effect in increasing vGHST rewards on QiDAO.\n7. More rewards for vGHST means more rewards in the hands of the Aavegotchi community\nNone of the other pools directly benefit GHST holders which is why only vQi-Qi is included in this SigProp (https://www.dystopia.exchange/vote).\n\nThank you for your support as the GotchiVault runs with the DeFi aspect of our DeFi RPG, seeks to add value to GHST, and solidifies Aavegotchi’s position as a cornerstone of Polygon DeFi and gaming.\n\nDr Wagmi",

      "content": "**Author:** Cookiethief#3952\n**GotchiID:** 1998\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Discourse Thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/launch-of-rf-szn4/3875\n\n*[CoreProp Edit:] In case AGIP35 passes and the REALM Distribution #3 gets delayed, Rarity Farming Szn 4 will be funded by the DAO’s Gameplay Rewards Pool, which currently holds roughly 5 Million GHST. This could be changed by a governance vote.]*\n\nIn line with the core prop passed via governance on feb 15th, I’d like to take this moment to formalise the start of rarity farm S4 with the gotchi-DAO. You can refer to the previous proposal, AGIP23, here: https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/0x5ffa4d3b8f4c1d744424af5c0f079ebfa286c9aec9c35e898c2c02bee87a0b60\n\nSince no major changes to the BRS, XP or kinship systems have occurred since the last season and since the passing of the proposal, I suggest we keep parameters equal to what they were for S3.\n\nFollowing that, this would be the final model for SZN4:\n\n4 Rounds (2 weeks each) 1.5 Million GHST Rewards Pool - to be funded by the land sale of AGIP30, for which the core prop passed here: https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/0x658926263e4ce1eca559950bcb0f5d8f203758c5c99b30999bb7f082552695b8\n\n- 70% BRS\n- 20% Kinship\n- 10% XP\n- Top 7.5k Gotchis (30%)\n\nIn the event where the land sale of AGIP30 does not lead to a RF pool of 1.5m GHST or higher, I suggest we make the rest of the 1.5m GHST prize pool whole via the DAO treasury as previously discussed in AGIP 23.\n\nThe DAO is potentially going to get rebalanced with a lot of GHST due to a recent pixelcraft-lead proposal for a DAI buyback that might pass governance in the near future, so it would tie in handily to that.\n\nIn case you missed it, a short recap for our RF scheduling;\n\nSZN 4 (covered in this sigprop): June - July\nSZN 5: October - November\nSZN 6: February - March 2023",

      "content": "AUTHOR: HARDKOR GOTCHIID: 15883\n\nSince the introduction of GLTR and the launch of Realm, much discussion has been held on what is appropriate to do about tickets.\n\nThe FRENS mechanic is outdated and many feel causes unsatisfactory experiences for those who buy tickets and are at the mercy of DAO votes to delay raffles.\n\nThis proposal does three things -\n\nUpon passage, FRENS emissions will be reduced by .1 FRENS and continue to be reduced by 0.1 FRENS per month, until they stop completely.\nTickets will be purchasable with GLTR, and redeemable for GLTR at a 10% restocking fee\nTickets bought with FRENS cannot be redeemed for GLTR, as there is no supply of GLTR allocated for this. A second sigprop could be raised, to have the DAO stake it's alchemica for GLTR, if this is desired.\nCurrently, drop tickets(10k frens) have a floor of 2.5 GHST, which is 127k GLTR\nThis would be 1.27 GLTR per FRENS at todays rates.\nTo not further destroy the ticket market by undercutting it, Pixelcraft will set the FRENS/GLTR ratio at the time that Pixelcraft has the technology ready to release. This will prevent people from manipulating the market, as only Pixelcraft will know when they are shipping.",

The goal of this document is to provide the DAO with the tools and governance structure to carry out their intended duties and navigate various membership obstacles. The Aavegotchi community has extensively reviewed and contributed to the formation of this document. Modifications or edits can be made prior to the core proposal. Please comment on the document, facilitate community discussion, and ensure your concerns are addressed. If the core proposal passes, changes and additions to the SOP can only be made via DAO vote\n\nThe Aavegotchi DAO SOP: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jYgJiDqtOBgPyq_NRAxXME1Xw3_5ByxY/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100550936649233683179&rtpof=true&sd=true\n\nThe TL;DR of the document: \n•\tIndividual task force members and the DAO can vote to remove elected members. A removal process is outlined in the document.\n•\tThe DTF extended multi-sig will be reviewed every 6 months\n•\tThe default task force review will be yearly\n•\tA process for temporary membership is outlined with a defined maximum number of temporary members (no more than 1/3 of the committee)\n\nThank you to the many contributors, especially Gadfly for applying his writing and legal expertise in the document’s formation.\n\nDr Wagmi\n",

      "title": "Utilizing the Channeling “Hot Zone”",
      "content": "Author: MoonGotchi#1234\nGotchi ID: 3541\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/utilizing-the-channeling-hot-zone/4055\n\nThere has been a lot of heated discussion about bots, scholars, spillover and more. A lot of it completely misses the point though, at least in my opinion. I went more in-depth on why I don't believe botting to be the primary problem at the moment in a comment here: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/keeping-the-status-quo-of-disabled-spillover-for-a-while/3845/172\n\nSo I started playing around with the numbers for spillover radius & rate, but I just couldn't find a satisfying solution. Reducing them only by a bit would barely have an effect, while reducing them drastically would devalue high level Aaltars. When I went [through the blog post](https://blog.aavegotchi.com/gotchi-ubi-is-coming-to-the-gotchiverse/) on channeling radius it finally clicked though! The mechanic was right there, just not utilized to its full potential (or at all really): The Hot Zone.\n\n \n![cdb60288d7d0c96c4c7a5ec3bb767a4174b44326_2_441x375.jpeg](ipfs://QmUntsAfd6SLoj11eMkoMQ7AqiW13krfxrGWyzHb7yKxh5)\n    \n\nIt became obvious pretty quickly that the Hot Zone wasn't so hot after all. The name simply implied that statistically speaking, 10% of the spillover would spawn inside of the inner 10% radius, 20% inside of the inner 20%, etc. This results in a slightly higher drop rate closer to the parcel, but in reality it barely makes a difference (only a single digit % of all spillover spawns in the \"Hot Zone\"). I want to propose allocating a fixed % of the spilled Alchemica based on Aaltar level as outlined in the model below:\n\n \n![8d72bfd571de3af3d94599dfb9f9504b37deab13.png](ipfs://QmSMdQzxv2uU2KQpdrqpoYV6pXjgmjfSWrvERqtpUHzVfe)\n    \n\nCombined with a proposed radius of 60 Gotchis (compared to the 64x32 measurements of a Spacious), dropping a larger amount of Alchemica inside of the Hot Zone would suddenly make spillover feel much more like actual spillover instead of a random token drop around the map. Here's what that would look in-game:\n\n \n![hot zone radius 60.png](ipfs://QmTXCJyFw9P6NB3XvPozgtrAoLBNR1JN5B2hGjSKB5mX3M)\n    \n\nImo this would:\n* Create an interesting mechanic around the concept of spillover ([as seen in the OG trailer](https://youtu.be/BxYQoDKO62Y?t=28))\n* Add an incentive for players to pick up their spilled tokens instead of channeling & logging off (and writing off the spillover completely)\n* Reduce the advantage of bots, since picking up spillover becomes less of a grinding & more of a channeling mechanic\n* Overall make the Gotchiverse in its current form more interesting\n\nLastly, I would like to note one thing. This proposal suggests introducing the Hot Zone mechanic as soon as spillover is resumed. However, the reverse is not the case. This proposal is not a vote to turn spillover back on, I merely believe it to be one piece in the larger puzzle.",

However, since this core prop was started (20th May) a lot of things have changed:\n- Harvester release has been delayed\n- We are in the middle of a bloodbath in the markets\n- LAND prices have dropped 30-70%\n- LAND bazaar volume has dropped 90%\n- There's been huge selling pressure on alchemica prices \n\nDue to these significant changes in the market, its seems right to allow the DAO to have another emergency vote on whether to go ahead with the LAND auction or not as releasing an auction in this market is very likely to drive down assets prices across the ecosystem. \n\nCoderdan confirmed it is viable to stop the auction but we must act quickly frens:\n> My thoughts are that it's generally not ideal to do a token sale in the middle of a market bloodbath as we are currently experiencing. Assets from all sectors of crypto are down, not just Aavegotchi. We are actually holding fairly strong in comparison. \n> \n> However, the DAO has voted to do this sale, and it passed overwhelmingly, so the DAO will also need to vote to delay it.\"",

It will only be possible to move the time forward, and you can only do this, if the gotchi(s) are currently able to channel.\n\nThe risks associated with this are that there will be unintended consequences, as always.",

This diminishes the effectiveness of makers and the utility of GLTR.\n\nAfter a month and a half of theorising, simulating, and refining MikeyJay, coderdan, letsgobankless, and myself have arrived at a final recipe which we believe best solves the above problem. \n\n**The proposed recipe changes to the harvester:**\n\n- Promote dynamic gameplay with a multitude of winning strategies\n- Make high level harvesters not only viable, but desirable\n- Reduces inflation of alchemica \n- Handicap the Low Leveloor strategy\n- Significantly increase build time for each installation which promote a healthy GLTR economy. *This increase drives more utility to the maaker.* \n\nThis topic has been discussed at length. For a full understanding, I highly encourage you to read through the forum thread, simulation results, and recipe changes found in the links above.

      "title": "SigProp: AavegotchiDAO <> Pixelcraft Studios 1.75M DAI Token Swap",
      "content": "**Author:** Jesse | gldnXross#6482\n**GotchiID:** 8497\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 5 days\n**Discourse Thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/token-swap-1-75m-dai-from-aavegotchidao-for-ghst-from-pixelcraft-studios/3769\n\n**Summary**\nThis proposal aims to swap 1.75 million DAI from AavegotchiDAO’s treasury with an equal value of GHST from Pixelcraft Studios’ balance sheet.\n\n**Rationale**\nThe launch of the Gotchiverse has introduced new and increasing infra costs for Pixelcraft Studios that cannot be paid for in GHST (or any crypto for that matter). These costs primarily consist of usage of AWS and Redis Enterprise for real-time gameplay in the Gotchiverse, and will continue to scale up as the game gets more popular.\n\nTo pay for these costs, we have outlined several options:\n\n- Raise funding from VCs\n- Liquidate GHST into DAI and swap for fiat\n- Use GHST as collateral on Aave to take loans in DAI\n- Perform a token swap with AavegotchiDAO\n\nWe believe Option 4 (Token Swap) is the best available option at the moment. We strongly value our independence from VCs, prefer not to have debt on our balance sheet, and do not want to market sell GHST acquired from sales.\n\nTherefore, we propose a token swap between AavegotchiDAO and Pixelcraft Studios to ensure adequate fiat runway for several years of further development, no matter how bearish the market becomes.\n\n**Key Details**\nAt the time of this writing, AavegotchiDAO treasury holds roughly:\n- 2.5 Million DAI\n- 3.5 Million GHST\n- 3 Million Alchemica\n\n(Live source here: https://app.aavegotchi.com/treasury) \n\nPixelcraft Studios, on the other hand, is heavily skewed toward GHST with over 6.7 Million GHST in our primary revenue wallet while our only DAI is coming from the curve’s monthly 150k DAI faucet, 50k of which is already earmarked for GHST purchases.\n\nPixelcraft Studios has been able to effectively grow the team and support infrastructure costs without needing to liquidate any significant amount of GHST. But last month’s launch of the Gotchiverse and anticipated continued growth has pushed operating costs dramatically higher. Server costs for the April playdrop, for example, exceeded 40k USD, and that is projected to grow in the months ahead.\n\nSuch operating expenses are anticipated but we have to acknowledge that these subscriptions and invoices almost always insist on trad banking (fiat). We would prefer to not have to sell GHST in order to achieve the necessary growth budget.\n\nThe DAO’s revenue from the GHST bonding curve opens up the possibility of a large-scale exchange of assets between our two parties. With the game live, GHST off its all time highs, and a DAO treasury that is well established, we believe this is the right time to propose an OTC token swap.\n\nFor the purposes of this token swap, a valuation for GHST that all can agree on must be established. There are many ways to arrive at such, so in the interest of expediency, I am proposing an intuitive method that also tips the scale generously in the DAO’s direction:\n\n**GHST valuation methodology**\nPixelcraft Studios will calculate GHST’s average price from Tuesday, June 14 to Saturday, June 18 (duration of the SigProp via CoinGecko) with a 5% discount applied to the final price. On the last day of the range dates, I will publish the final calculated GHST price in the above linked Discourse Thread for everyone to discuss. If DAO voters find the results agreeable, they may vote to approve this SigProp and the resulting CoreProp will use that published GHST price for the deal.\n\n**Execution**\nIf the CoreProp passes, the token swap should process in a predictable way. I suggest the token swap occur with the following method of execution:\n\n- Pixelcraft Studios shall first transfer the agreed upon amount of GHST (defined in the e.CoreProp) to the AavegotchiDAO treasury wallet.\n- AavegotchiDAO treasury wallet (currently managed via multisig by Pixelcraft team) shall transfer 1.75 million DAI within 8 hours of receiving the GHST to the Pixelcraft Studios primary revenue wallet.\n- Pixelcraft Studios shall make an announcement in Aavegotchi Discord confirming the reception of the DAI, thus concluding the token swap.\n",

      "content": "#### Authors: Cookiethief (#1998), Kokusho (#6447), Xeko (#12300)\n#### Discourse threads:\nDisable Spillover: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/keeping-the-status-quo-of-disabled-spillover-for-a-while/3845/193\nWhitelist-Only: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/whitelist-only-rentals/4043/2\n#### Voting period: 3 days\n\n## Proposal\n\nHey frens, after much discussion about various ideas to restrict botting in the Gotchiverse, I believe we have settled on two options that are ready for voting.\n\n### Option A: Temporarily Disable Spillover\nThis would see all Alchemica spillover in the Gotchiverse halted, except for during weekly community events like the Saturday Haangout, where we could unload a sizeable portion to all those present. \n\nPros: Would immediately stop the majority of botting in the Gotchiverse. Could add extra hype for our weekly events.\nCons: Players that have already been onboarded would be sitting around twiddling their thumbs until we add spillover back in. \nDev time: Basically none\n\n### Option B: Restrict Gotchi Lending to a Whitelist-only system\nRight now, Gotchi Lending is available to literally anyone with 0.1 GHST and some MATIC. Enabling a Whitelist-only system would restrict which addresses can borrow Gotchis to a specific set of addresses determined by the whitelist specified during the listing creation. \n\nPros: Would likely restrict botters’ ability to easily gain access to Gotchis, meaning less Gotchi-bots in the Verse.\nCons: Adds more complexity to the borrowing process. New players will have to join Guilds or converse with players to gain access to their Whitelist. \nDev time: Basically none\n\n## My thoughts\n\nI believe the onboarding challenges could be overcome with some frontend portals that show which Guilds are currently active and onboarding new players into their whitelists.\n\nLeaderboards could also be a fun way to show the performance of the players on each Whitelist. \n\nIdeally, Guilds should do due diligence on players they whitelist, to ensure they are not adding potential botter addresses. There are currently no repercussions for this, but it could be something we as a community begin tracking in the future. \n\nIf, after a few weeks of review we do not believe that Option B is doing enough to reduce the problem, we can continue discussing stricter options. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nSo what do you say frens? We are bumping this directly to a Coreprop, and it will only be open for three days, to ensure we have a quick turnaround on this issue. Let’s blast through quorum and turn the tide in the war on botters!",

      "title": "Creating the Aarcade Taask Force (ATF)",
      "content": "**Authors:** Gotchinomics#4936, Slick#2526\n\n**GotchiID:** [233,3934]\n\n**Voting Duration:** 10 days\n\n**Discourse Thread:** [https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/creation-of-an-aarcade-dao/2128](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/creation-of-an-aarcade-dao/2128)\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe open-source nature of the Aavegotchi protocol combined with its on-chain assets provides an excellent foundation for external development efforts.  More specifically, third-party developed games can greatly expand the usability of Aavegotchi assets and provide growth to the entire project. \n\n**Problem**\n\nWhen developing 3rd party games for the Aavegotchi protocol, there is currently a lack of:\n\n- A definitive process for taking a game from concept to Pixelcraft XP event,\n- API’s and rules for implementing server security and anti-cheat mechanisms,\n- Guidance for new developers seeking funding from Pixelcraft or the AavegotchiDAO,\n- Utilisation of rewards from AGIP16 Stake 100k GHST to generate Minigame Rewards,\n- Organized periodic game events to breathe life back into old mini-games\n- Structured testing procedures that ensure sufficient quality and performance benchmarks are met prior to releasing games to the wider Aavegotchi community.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThis proposal aims to introduce and confirm the Aarcade Taask Force (ATF). The ATF’s primary focus will be to support game development efforts that incorporate assets from the Aavegotchi protocol.\n\nInitially, the ATF will have the following responsibilities:\n\n- Distribution and accountability for all raffle tickets/rewards generated per AGIP16,\n- Development of application forms/checklists for game developers seeking raffle tickets/rewards to be issued as prizes in their games,\n- Implementation of an ATF game approval voting system that publicly records raffle ticket/reward approvals for transparency to the wider Aavegotchi community,\n- Development of a **”From Concept to Pixelcraft XP Event”** document that guides developers through the concept, feedback, stress test, giveaway event and Pixelcraft XP event phases of a successful Aavegotchi protocol Aarcade game,\n- Organization of periodic Aavegotchi mini-game events/giveaways.\n\n**End Goal & Benefit**\n\nThe ATF’s short term goal is to help incentivize the development of more mini-games of a higher quality for the Aavegotchi community to play, share and enjoy with the natural benefit being increased utility and growth for the Aavegotchi protocols assets.\n\nLong term, the ATF aims to support the development of the Aavegotchi Aarcade, player base and its stakeholders.\n\n**Potential Risks**\n\nAs we are in the early stages of forming the Aarcade Task Force some potential risks include:\n\n- ATF members voting on their own games for approval (mitigated by making these members abstain from votes on their games)\n- Awarding raffle tickets before a game is even finished (clear check points need to be implemented)\n- Mismanagement, theft or loss of rewards (a multi-sig wallet will be setup),\n- ATF members becoming inactive (onboard/offboard procedures will be required)\n\n**ATF Members**\n\nThe initial 12 members of the ATF will be the following. These members have all actively participated in the Aavegotchi community for over a year now, come from different backgrounds and consist of experienced developers, security experts and gamers:\n\n- alvi#1123\n- chair #6121\n- Coyote#3131\n- enoonmai#4469\n- Gotchinomics#4936\n- Hefe#1514\n- Hotspur#9218\n- ricJones | Grizzy#9187\n- shah#0369\n- Slick#2526\n- SpyceBringer#2075\n- Thunderfish#4370\n\nThese members will also be the signers for the ATF multi-sig treasury wallet used to:\n\n- Control distribution of rewards from AGIP16 100k GHST Staking,\n- Manage funds from any future development grants awarded to the ATF,\n- Manage Income/Expenditure of any future ATF developed websites/platforms\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOn a final note, AGIP16 required that 100% of frens generated from the 100k GHST staking be converted to raffle tickets for distribution to gamers during mini-game events. For flexibility, the ATF request the following amendments to this reward structure:\n\n1) Raffle tickets may be converted to other Aavegotchi NFT’s/tokens of equal market value to help provide more diverse giveaways,\n\n2) 50% of the 100k Staked GHST is moved into wapGHST staking to generate GLTR to further ease conversion of rewards into other Aavegotchi NFT’s/tokens,\n\n3) 10% of the value of a games giveaway event prize pool be awarded to game developers **after** their giveaway event as a bonus incentive for shipping their game! This will also help support the developers higher server costs during the month of the giveaway event.\n\nAll transactions, conversions and ATF votes will be documented and made public for complete community transparency. In addition, any ticket/GLTR redemptions (or transfer of AGIP16 GHST staking control) still need to be approved and signed off by the DAO Treasury Force (DTF).\n\nSo what do you think? Is it time to form the Aarcade Taask Force Anon?",

      "title": "Use DYST voting Power to Support vQi-Qi on Dystopia",
      "content": "Author: Dr Wagmi#6629\nGotchi ID: 16635\nDiscourse Thread (Idea/Proposal): https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/use-dyst-voting-power-for-the-vqi-qi-pool/4010\n\nProposal:\nThe Aavegotchi DAO should use its DYST voting power to support the vQi-Qi pool on DystopiaSwap indefinitely. Any community member can submit an additional signal prop should reallocation be considered.. Indefinite support will avoid overly frequent Sig Prop submissions that are only tangentially related to the Aavegotchi DAO.\n\nBackground:\nDystopia Swap is an automated market maker with ve(3,3) mechanics which was recently launched on Polygon. They airdropped a big portion of their initial token supply to Polygon dApps including the Aavegotchi protocol, QiDAO, and the GotchiVault. This voting token is used to allocate scheduled rewards similar to QiDAO’s Qi. This means it is up to our Aavegotchi community to decide how to best use our airdropped voting power to support the DeFi aspect for Aavegotchi and GHST. I propose that this voting power be used to support the vQi-Qi pool which secures liquidity and rewards for the ~4M GHST in the vGHST protocol.\n\nA brief overview of why this is good for GHST:\n1.\tGHST users deposit their GHST for vGHST using the GotchiVault (3.83M vGHST exist currently)\n2.\tvGHST can be deposited in QiDAO as collateral for borrowing MAI\n3.\tQi rewards are paid to borrowers based on a biweekly vote by Qi holders\n4.\tQi that is staked for 4 years has 4x the voting power- this is known as eQi. vQi is a liquid form of eQi that allows holders to sell the token. vQi voting power is always used for vGHST. The current vQi supply is 833k which means 3.3M eQi voting power.\n5.\tThe system requires adequate vQi-Qi liquidity to be sustainable. This vote incentivizes the vQi-Qi pool which will deepen liquidity and create a flywheel effect in increasing vGHST rewards on QiDAO.\n6.\tMore rewards for vGHST means more rewards in the hands of the Aavegotchi community\n\nNone of the other pools directly benefit GHST holders which is why only vQi-Qi is included in this Sig Prop (https://www.dystopia.exchange/vote).\n\nThank you for your support as the GotchiVault runs with the DeFi aspect of our DeFi RPG, seeks to add value to GHST, and solidifies Aavegotchi’s position as a cornerstone of Polygon DeFi and gaming.\n\nDr Wagmi\n\n \n",

      "title": "Allow Players to Customize Their 24-Hour Channeling Windows",
      "content": "As the Gotchiverse continues to evolve during alpha testing, we are learning that some aspects of the game still need a little adjustment and fine-tuning.  Currently, gotchi channeling resets every 24-hours, with this reset happening at midnight UTC.   While the 24-hour window is popular with community members, being bound to the single, universal reset time is causing stress for both the game servers and the community.  \n\nWe propose players be allowed to reset their 24-hour windows to a time of their choosing for a small $GLTR fee.  Details are as follows:   \n- By default, the reset time will remain midnight UTC.\n- Gotchis will still channel one time within a 24hr window.\n- Players can customize their reset time by paying 10,000 $GLTR.\n- The new reset time will be set when the gotchi channels after the fee is paid.\n- There is no slippage of channeling time.   (For example if you reset your window to 9am but on the next day, you don't channel until 11am, your window will still open at 9am the day after that.)  Players can channel when it suits them.\n- Devs have confirmed that bulk gotchi resets will be possible to assist players with large numbers of gotchis.\n- For multiple gotchis, the $GLTR reset fee will be paid per gotchi and the time will be reset to when the first gotchi in the batch channels.\n- To prevent abuse, players must wait 60 hours before resetting again.\n- This mechanic has the added benefit of providing a burn mechanism for $GLTR.",

      "content": "Author: Zygo (Gotchi ID#4743)\nLink to Discourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/make-estate-building-worthwhile/3662/20\n\n\nSummary:\n\nThere is a problem with the currently proposed estate building mechanics. Since linking parcels is restricted by the presence of an upgraded lodge, it is quite expensive to link parcels with very little benefit for doing so. This can be fixed by linking the estate size limit to a parcel's Aaltar level rather than Lodge level. \n\n\nEnd goal and benefits: \n\nEstate building is a great opportunity to create a fun meta-game of building a large estate and help users see the value of a parcel as more than just its alchemica-harvesting potential. The goal of this sigprop is to help realize this future for potential land-holders.\n\n\nPotential risks or negative consequences:\n\nThis proposal would decrease the demand for Lodges and make estates easier to create. It would probably increase the demand for higher-level aaltars.\n\n\nAlternative paths:\n\nThere are two approaches to solving this problem: \n\n#1 increase the benefit of estates \n#2 decrease the cost of creating estates\n\nSince Coderdan clarified things like sharing installations between estate parcels would require significant development, those in the forum mostly agreed that the best solution for now is to lower the cost of creating an estate. However there were a couple other ideas which gained support in the poll: Making estates visible on the mini-map, and adding an outgoing teleportation radius to estates. These can be discussed and proposed in a separate proposal if desired. \n",

I propose that we schedule the event to end the day before realm launch.\n\nEffect - \n\nThat 3rd land release will be 7000 auction/3000 raffle, and occur before the launch of realm, or as soon afterwards as Pixelcraft can manage it, if there are technical and marketing concerns.\n\nHighlight end goal and benefits - \n\nThe community was told that there will be 3 land releases before launch.\nLaunch is very soon so we need to decide if we are honoring that.\nThis will give new players a chance to participate as well as learn about how the deeper ecosystem works.\nScholars will buy tickets and save them, instead of selling alchemica to cash out.\nIt's been twice as long between raffles as we have ever gone, and there is  GHST inflation due to leverage loops created by various DAPPS, so we need to release a raffle before the tickets become too devalued.\nThe resulting market activity will feed new money into the game, prop up the alchemica markets by providing even more reasons that you need a lot of alchemica for launch day, and give the new players, especially those with small bags, their first big win, thereby teaching them that this game is what they should be investing in.\n\nAcknowledge potential risks or unintended consequences -\n\nIt's possible that there is no new money, and we are just rearranging existing funds.\n\nAny alternative paths - \n\n1. Delay auction for longer.\n2. Smaller Auction/Raffle  3500/1500\n3. Set the Auction/Raffle to be one month after launch.",

This CoreProp proposes to change the trait mappings for these 4 traits to:\n\n**NRG:** HP Capacity (0 NRG) <===> AP Capacity (100 NRG)\n**AGG:** Defense Power (0 AGG) <===> Action Speed (100 AGG)\n**SPK:** HP & AP Regen (0 SPK) <===> Ethereality (100 SPK)\n**BRN:** Melee Power (0 BRN) <===> Ranged Power (100 BRN)\n**EYS:** To Be Confirmed\n**EYC:** To Be Confirmed\n\nPlease refer to the DAO forum thread linked above for a full rundown on what these changes mean (including an FAQ section).\n\n**Core Effects of the New Trait Map**\n\n* Movement speed removed from trait maps will now lead to an improved quality of life user experience (UX) for all players starting out in the Gotchiverse, both new and old,\n* Carrying capacity removed from trait maps corrects the imbalance of 1 farming trait vs. 7 combat traits on NRG, AGG, SPK and BRN,\n* There is now a clear distinction between physical and ability specialist (mage) gotchis,\n* There is now a clear distinction between melee and ranged gotchis,\n* Ethereality can now be thought of as “Luck” and influences evasion, critical strikes, slipping through walls and all sorts of other chance based actions in the Gotchiverse.\n\n**End Goal**\nFor the community and Pixelcraft to build a trait map together that is balanced, has excellent UX, playability and longevity while simultaneously allowing the flexibility to implement wearable buffs and abilities that work with the traits in the future.\n\n**Risks**\nThere is potential that some players and investors have already purchased gotchis based on the original trait mappings. It is important to note that these traits were always specified as non-immutable in the Game Bible HOWEVER, we strongly believe the new trait maps proposed here will create even moar diverse and entertaining play styles for OG investors and new players alike to experiment with and enjoy playing.\n\n**Final Important Notes**\n\n* There are a number of ways these Traits can scale (Yin/Yang linear, asymmetric, buff only starting from 50 and diminishing returns to name a few). The Trait Scaling System is still under review by the community so look forward to further calls with Pixelcraft (to really get into the nitty gritty) and another SigProp!\n* EYS and EYC are still under review by the community. A number of interesting ideas including farming/alchemica/HUD abilities have been proposed. Make sure you get involved and have your say on how you’d like to see these evolve too!\n\nSo without further ado, let us know what you think!\n\nOption 1: Yes, use the new Trait Map\nOption 2: No, stick with the original",

The current utilisation rate is at 45% with a deposit APR ~2.5%. Given the significant yield and quickly growing utility of the GHST token, we anticipate ongoing borrowing demand, and, thus, yield for GHST depositors and the DAO Treasury. The Aavegotchi DAO can demonstrate its dexterity, effectiveness, and impressive treasury by quickly capitalizing on this passive yield opportunity. This would speak volumes to the broader DeFi and crypto community and immediately provide additional value to GHST token holders through increased borrowing capacity in the Aave pool.\n\nAn initial deposit of 3,000,000 GHST would represent approximately 80% of the DAO Treasury GHST. This deposit is completely liquid and could be withdrawn if the DAO designates other uses. A 3% APR is nearly $90,000 which can be used to further invest in the Aavegotchi ecosystem through DAO initiatives. A separate proposal can be considered for the additional 20% and for the 2.4M DAI in the treasury. We do not propose that the received amGHST from this proposed initial deposit be staked for FRENS. This proposal is not requesting DTF multi-sig control over this deposit or the ongoing management.\n\n-Dr Wagmi\n\nOption 1: Yes, deposit 3M GHST\nOption 2: No, keep GHST in the Treasury\nOption 3: Abstain",

The primary goal of this allocation is to ensure excellent long-term liquidity across many platforms, including the GAX, various DEXes on Polygon, Mainnet, and even CEXes.\n\nThose who follow the project carefully know that we always try to do everything “by the book”, to make Aavegotchi a model case study for decentralization and legal compliance. We are currently in the final stages of setting up a new legal wrapper for AavegotchiDAO (more specifically, a Panama Foundation) and will soon be making an announcement for applications to serve.\n\nOn the technical side, we are also working to implement onchain governance of the Aavegotchi protocol. However, this will take some time, as it requires upgrades to the deployed GHST token on Polygon.\n\nWhile all of this is happening in the background, we are also launching FIVE new ERC20 Alchemica tokens and locking a sizable amount of them into vesting contracts.\n\nFor both legal and strategic reasons, we believe that the Ecosystem allocation should not be managed by Pixelcraft, but instead by AavegotchiDAO. The DAO Treasury Force has already been created to manage some of the DAO treasury, but the number of signers is quite few (six) and in my opinion insufficient to hold such a sum of funds.\n\nTherefore, I propose we create an additional multisig under the current DTF, with fifteen signers instead of the current six. **Eleven** out of fifteen signatures would be required to confirm transactions.\n\nThis multisig would be the beneficiary of the Ecosystem Vesting Contract (which holds 10% of each Alchemica’s token supply, vested over 30 years), and could also inherit the 1M GHST originally allocated during the GHST creation for Ecosystem building, to help bootstrap Alchemica liquidity.\n\nOn our side, we will deploy the Alchemica and create initial liquidity pools on Quickswap, after which we will transfer ownership of the vesting contract to the multisig. After that point, it will be up to the DTF to coordinate liquidity provision.\n\nLet’s goooo Gotchigang!\n\n[Final note: You can vote for multiple members at once, the top 9 choices will then get elected!

Keep in mind that the first round (quarter) will distribute more Alchemica than the rest of them, so losing big in the first round could set someone back by a lot.\n\n**Solution:**\nI want to propose lowering the variance to AT LEAST 0.5 - 1.5 if not even 0.75 - 1.25 for the first round (Voting Choice 1). My issue with this very high variance is that people made financial decisions based on the average numbers published before the first auction, making people lose 50-80% of Alchemica value underneath the parcel is terrible UX to me.\n\nAnother option suggested by Mori would be to create a binomial distribution with the left tail cut off, so it's possible to win big but impossible to get rekt hard (Voting Choice 2). This results in an average pull of 100, a minimum pull of 60, and a maximum pull of ~800. There's a fairly reasonable chance of winning this top prize, with ~0.02% of parcels being able to achieve this. Important note: This option would reduce the previous Median of 100 to roughly 83.\n\n**Keep in mind:**\n\n* There are 9 rounds, so getting rekt in 1 doesn’t mean you’ll always get unlucky (even though you might!)\n* There is a VRF roll for every type of Alchemica (FUD, FOMO, ALPHA, KEK), so it’s likely you’ll get good rolls in one and bad rolls in others\n\nOption 1: Round 1 0.75 - 1.25 & 0.5 - 1.5\nOption 2: Binomial Distribution\nOption 3: No, don’t change the Variance",

It is important to note that these traits were always specified as non-immutable in the Game Bible HOWEVER, we strongly believe the new trait maps proposed here will create even moar diverse and entertaining play styles for OG investors and new players alike to experiment with and enjoy playing.\n\n**Final Important Notes**\n- There are a number of ways these Traits can scale (Yin/Yang linear, asymmetric, buff only starting from 50 and diminishing returns to name a few). The Trait Scaling System is still under review by the community so look forward to further calls with Pixelcraft (to really get into the nitty gritty) and another SigProp!\n- EYS and EYC are still under review by the community. A number of interesting ideas including farming/alchemica/HUD abilities have been proposed. Make sure you get involved and have your say on how you’d like to see these evolve too!\n\nSo without further ado, let us know what you think!\n",

      "content": "Author: Garrett#9293\n\nGHST is a popular asset listed on many spot market including DEX and CEX. But GHST is not listed yet on any perpetual market or market with leverage. Once listed, there will be an increase of trading volume of GHST in both derivative market and spot market, which in a long term will benefit the popularity and price of GHST.\n\nWe propose to list GHST on TripleFi (https://triple.fi/). \nTripleFi is a derivative perpetual DEX on Polygon and can list GHST/USDT with 5x leverage.\n\nThere will be no cost for a listing. However GHST/USDT trading pair will launch once liquidity pool exceeds 10k USDT in the liquidity pool. Therefore we suggest to deposit 10k into the liquidity pool of GHST/USDT pair after listing. The liquidity can be withdrawn and liquidity pool will generate a return above 30% APR in a fully traded pair which is also beneficial for the DAO.\n\nMore about TripleFi: https://linktr.ee/triplefi ",

      "content": "Author:   ! Dev Oskii | Umbria Network#4669\nGotchiID:   #4458 \nQuorum requirement:   20% (9M)\nVote duration:   7 days\nXP Reward:   20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\nDiscourse Thread:   https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/add-ghst-stake-to-the-umbria-narni-bridge/2836\n\nThe Umbria Narni Bridge has implemented the GHST token, and is facilitating cheaper migration of GHST between the Ethereum <--> Polygon networks, compared to the official Polygon bridge. The Umbria Narni bridging cost is about 1/2 of the official polygon bridge cost and is also much faster (4 minutes, as opposed to > 1 hour).\n\nThe Umbria Narni bridge protocol can bridge a maximum of 20% of its total GHST liquidity, per bridging event. For example, with $100k of GHST tokens in one side of the pool, the bridge can migrate a maximum of $20k of GHST per single transaction.\n\nCurrently there is approximately $14,000 of GHST tokens on each side of the bridge. This is mostly funded by the Umbria team. This enables the bridge to be able to bridge a maximum of $700 of GHST tokens per transaction - which is pretty good, but we are aware that some users want to bridge much more in a single transaction.\n\nWe propose the Aavegotchi DAO add $100,000 of GHST to each bridge pool (1. Polygon and 2. Ethereum). There are a few advantages for doing so:\n\nThe Aavegotchi DAO will earn a 0.2% bridging fee whenever anyone uses the bridge to migrate GHST tokens between Ethereum <--> Polygon. So across time, the Aavegotchi DAO will make money. If the Narni bridge ever becomes an unnecessary solution, the Aavegotchi DAO can easily remove their liquidity and enjoy their profit.\n\nTransactions up to approximately $21,000 of GHST will now be possible.\n\nThe Aavegotchi community will learn about our bridge which enables migration of assets for WAY cheaper than the official polygon bridge. A great quality of life improvement if they are participating in other projects too.\n\nETH average cost $4 - time 4 minutes, compared to > 1 hour\nUSDT average cost $9 - time 4 minutes, compared to > 1 hour\nUSDC average cost $9 - time 4 minutes, compared to > 1 hour\nMATIC average cost $9 - time 4 minutes, compared to > 7 days\n\nUnlike the official Polygon bridge who offer absolutely no technical support, even in the event of a bridge error, the Umbria Narni bridge has a dedicated discord support team who have an excellent reputation for speedily resolving any issues and guarantee transaction resolution in the event of an unforeseen error.\n\nThe Umbria Narni bridge is administered and coordinated by a publicly listed company Online Blockchain PLC from the UK, who are bound by the rules and regulations of the UK financial conduct authority. It has also been audited by ADVFN, and is in the process of several other audits.\n\nThe Umbria project is officially partnered with Polygon, as well as a number of popular NFT projects including Zedrun, The Red Village and many others.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, I (Dev Oskii - @OskiiDev on twitter and \"! Dev Oskii | Umbria Network\" on Discord) would be more than happy to answer them in the official Umbria discord channel. We hope you approve this DAO proposal so our platform can improve the user experience for Aavegotchi.\n\n",

We launched our very first DeFi savings pools on Polygon, during the summer of 2021. So far, we have helped over 7000 users to save over $600k worth of assets on Polygon. All while collecting some nice \n\nNFTs and climbing our leaderboard.\nThe GoodGhosting team believes in a world where saving is rewarding, easy and fun. Yet, traditional saving is none of that. We build decentralized social saving applications that combine game design elements with goal-based saving. We want to help our community to develop better financial habits, and have fun at the same time.\n\ntl;dr If you make all deposits, you earn a slice of the pool’s interest, and additional rewards! More details can be found in the DAO thread.\n\nPotential collaboration  \nWe want to expose the GoodGhosting community to Aavegotchi, by introducing an Aavegotchi-themed savings pool. This pool will require players to save in GHST tokens, and earn them more GHST on top. We see it as a fun opportunity to cross-pollinate the GoodGhosting and Aavegotchi communities.\n\nAavegotchi is a one-of-a-kind project we have been keeping a close eye on from the very start. Both as players and as ecosystem residents. In our opinion, it envisions everything that DeFi and Web3 is about 👻\n\nBesides inviting all Aavegotchi users and the DAO itself to participate in the upcoming GHST savings pool, GoodGhosting would like to request the AavegotchiDAO to consider co-sponsoring this pool.\n\nOur Request  \nA total of 7000 GHST in sponsorship for this savings pool. To be shared between all winning players.\nThe ability to reward successful savers with Gotchi XP, or alternatively FRENS. Considering GoodGhosting an extensive mini-game that encourages people to stack more GHST.\nAn allocation of Aavegotchi NFTs (worth up to 3000 GHST) to be raffled to random participants and/or to all winners. These could be Wearables, Gotchi’s, Raffle tickets or Realm parcels. \n These could either be provided by the AavegotchiDAO, or alternatively purchased by the GoodGhosting team on the Bazaar. For these additional incentives, we hope to provide benefits to a small handful of lucky winners (via a raffle system), and/or a smaller reward that is feasible to be delivered to all winners. \n\nWhat can GoodGhosting bring to the table?  \nUp to 4000 WMATIC tokens in sponsorship (from our DeFiForAll grant). To be shared between all winning players.\nAn influx of new users into the Aavegotchi ecosystem. So far over 20500 users joined our Celo and Polygon savings pools. Most have not yet been exposed to Aavegotchi or GHST, and many are likely to join the Gotchigang.\nWe will create a YouTube video explaining Aavegotchi, and how to obtain the GHST token on Polygon. Directed at our community members.\nWe will allow users to play GoodGhosting using their Aavegotchis as avatar. This will show up in the shared ‘Players’ tab, as well as in the individual player profiles on Goodghosting.com\nSome very special NFTs by our in-house artist Mali3D\nAn increased GG score for all successful savers\n\nWe look forward to proceeding in a way to benefit both Aavegotchi and GoodGhosting in some serious Ghostly synergy.\n",

      "content": "Author:   Cookiethief#3952\nGotchiID:   1998\nQuorum requirement:   20% (9M)\nVote duration:   7 days\nXP Reward:   20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\nDiscourse Thread:   https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/season-3-for-q1-2022/2779\n\nProblem  \nCurrently, Rarity Farming Seasons happen sporadically and are difficult to account for in the cadence of Aavegotchi releases. It leaves investors wondering if they should hold onto their Gotchis and Wearables, or if they might find better ROI flipping into the next rounds. It would be desirable to have a bit of certainty / predictability for both investor sentiment and for planning purposes.\n\nSolution  \nIf possible funding-wise, Rarity Farming should happen three times a year. It would fit in with the seasonal nature we are already following, and if properly planned could be sustainable based on GBM Sales in-between seasons, Treasury revenue via staking and partnerships (such as the Umbra Bridge proposal), and other streams of revenue such as DAO Grants. The author of this proposal believes Rarity Farming is an essential part of the Gotchiverse ecosystem, and something to build out and improve upon rather than scrap.\n\nDistribution  \nFor Season 3, I suggest we go back to the standard reward ratio, as was tried and tested in Tarity Farming Season 1. The rookies of the similarly named rookie board are now all grown up and ready to compete with the big boys. This would mean 70% of payouts go to the BRS leaderboard, 20% to the Kinship leaderboard and 10% to the XP leaderboard.\n\nBased on Forum discussions this would be the final model for SZN3:\n4 Rounds (2 weeks each)\n1.5 Million GHST Rewards Pool (1.4m GHST funded already)\n70% BRS\n20% Kinship\n10% XP\nTop 5k Gotchis (20%) → Top 7.5k Gotchis (30%)\n3 Seasons per Year (approx. schedule below)\nSZN 3: February - March\nSZN 4: June - July\nSZN 5: October - November\n\nUpdated Rewards Sheet: Rarity Farming SZN 3 Distribution Model\n\nSince there is a ~100k GHST discrepancy between the proposed amount to be distributed and GHST currently in the rewards pool, this proposal includes a funding request for the remaining amount to be taken out of the AavegotchiDAO Treasury. The pool balance can be viewed here: https://polygonscan.com/address/0x27DF5C6dcd360f372e23d5e63645eC0072D0C098/tokens\n",

      "content": "\nAuthor: Dr Wagmi#6629\nGotchiID: 16635\nVote duration: 8 days\nDiscourse Thread: \nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/deposit-3-000-000-ghst-from-the-dao-treasury-into-aave/3007\n\nAlongside the DAO Treasury Taask Force, I propose that we immediately take advantage of the Aave GHST listing by depositing ~80% of our DAO Treasury GHST (3,000,000 GHST) into Aave as collateral to earn passive yield. The current utilisation rate is at 45% with a deposit APR ~2.5%. Given the significant yield and quickly growing utility of the GHST token, we anticipate ongoing borrowing demand, and, thus, yield for GHST depositors and the DAO Treasury. The Aavegotchi DAO can demonstrate its dexterity, effectiveness, and impressive treasury by quickly capitalizing on this passive yield opportunity. This would speak volumes to the broader DeFI and crypto community and immediately provide additional value to GHST token holders through increased borrowing capacity in the Aave pool.\n\nAn initial deposit of 3,000,000 GHST would represent approximately 80% of the DAO Treasury GHST. This deposit is completely liquid and could be withdrawn if the DAO designates other uses. A 3% APR is nearly $90,000 which can be used to further invest in the Aavegotchi ecosystem through DAO initiatives. A separate proposal can be considered for the additional 20% and for the 2.4M DAI in the treasury. We do not propose that the received amGHST from this proposed initial deposit be staked for frens. This proposal is not requesting DTF multi-sig control over this deposit or the ongoing management. If the signal proposal passes, an abstain option will be included in the core proposition. \n-Dr Wagmi\n  \n \n \n",

      "content": "**Author:** SynFutures Team & Moon\n**GotchiID:** 3541\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Discourse Thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/provide-ghst-as-liquidity-on-the-derivatives-dex-synfutures/2664\n\nSince Aavegotchi has gathered a lot of liquidity on Spot DEXes, it is high time for Aavegotchi to create and boost its Futures market. Derivatives markets make up the majority of global trading activity and allow users to leverage their investments. Adding GHST liquidity on SynFutures would allow people to take on leverage longs (or shorts) on the future of Aavegotchi. But why SynFutures?\n\n**Great investors and team background**\nSynFutures is backed by Polychain, Pantera, Dragonfly, Framework, Standard Crypto, Woo, and more. The team’s background is a great combination of traditional finance and DeFi. SynFutures is the only project of its kind which can support the listing of any assets by anyone in a permissionless manner (in less than 30s).\n\n**Security**\nBacked by solid experience from the TradFi financial engineering and DeFi protocol safety, SynFutures has many risk management features (e.g. anti-flashloan attack, EMA smoothing method, etc.) and has gone through external code audits.\n\n**Easy to manage and start**\nSynFutures supports a single token model to add liquidity which means the Aavegotchi Treasury would only have to deposit GHST instead of offering two tokens with the risk of impermanent loss. We are asking for 200k worth of GHST tokens to kickstart the pool. The liquidity could be withdrawn anytime.\n\n**Growth Potential**\nTrading volume and users are growing fast on SynFutures. For the past 3 months since the SynFutures Alpha launched, we reached 47k users of and $1bn+ in trading volume. All this happened without a native SynFutures token, which could attract even more users.\n\n**Volume analysis**\nQuickswap vs. SynFutures:\nTotal LPs: 150k / 40K\nTotal traders: 100k / 20k\nDaily trading volume: $100M / $29M\n\nSynFutures trading volume makes up ~1/3rd of QuickSwap, and the amount of traders is 1/5th as big as on QuickSwap, however, the trading volume for different pairs is more concentrated. SynFutures has 108 trading pairs while QuickSwap has more than 22k pairs. For example, the daily trading volume of MATIC-USDC on SynFutures closes in on around $9M, while Quickswap reaches $14M.\n\nOption 1: Yes, add $200k in GHST\nOption 2: No, do not add $200k in GHST",

      "content": "**Author:** Dr Wagmi#6629\n**GotchiID:** 16635\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Discourse Thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/establish-the-dao-treasury-taask-force/2460\n\nWe propose the creation of the DAO Treasury Taask Force (DTF). This committee will initially be composed of 8 members with reassessment of membership by the DAO within 6 months.\n\nAs of 12/07/2021, the DAO Treasury (https://aavegotchi.com/treasury) boasts nearly ~$11,408,400 worth of DAI and GHST. In its initial form, the committee will form proposals for consideration by the DAO which will subsequently be voted on and, if passed, enacted.\n\n**Proposed Mission Statement**\nThe Aavegotchi DAO Treasury Taask Force is a dynamic committee assigned with making DAO treasury management proposals to the community and DAO for consideration. The initial mission and goals of the committee will be: 1) Grow and optimize the DAO treasury with an emphasis on safety, security and transparency; 2) Partner with Pixelcraft to assist in developing and identifying tools and infrastructure for ongoing DAO Treasury management; and 3) Foster and encourage growth of the overall Aavegotchi community by increasing awareness, actively promoting adoption, and maintaining current user engagement.\n\n**Initial Funding**\nAfter lengthy discussions with the task force, the community, and with coderdan, the DTF would like to request an initial 50,000 GHST budget. The 50,000 GHST budget would be transferred from the DAO Treasury to the 8 multi-signature Gnosis Safe. This budget will greatly expand the flexibility of the DAO in incentivizing and rewarding engaged community members, developers, creatives, and overall contributors. This budget will never be used to reward members of the DTF. The DTF’s core main initiative will be to form a proposal for overall use of the DAO Treasury by investing some of the $10 million DAI/GHST in yield bearing opportunities. With effective deployment of the DAO Treasury, even modest returns would more than pay for the DTF budget request. The DTF will ensure comprehensive accounting and provide community facing documentation to ensure transparency. Some potential uses for the budget include the following:\n\nReward community engagement and aarcade play\nReward game developers and designers\nReward community application developers\nReward and acknowledge community art contributions\nReward, acknowledge and grow content creators and general marketing efforts\nExpand Aavegotchi and GHST’s opportunities for decentralized financial applications\n\nThe DTF is developing a structured plan and multiple potential pilot projects to best utilize these funds. We will work to develop tools to allow maximum transparency into the budget use. Expenses within this 50,000 GHST budget would not require a DAO approval in order to maximize nimble use of the funds. Any further budget requests beyond the initial 50,000 GHST would require a DAO vote.\n\n\n**The initial 8 members of the DTF**\nBowtiedNerd\nMori\nletsgobankless\nAddison\nDeucehearts\nBackfireCapital\nSwappi\nDr Wagmi\n\nWe appreciate the Aavegotchi community’s support and look forward to our first proposal.\n\nOption 1: Yes, with 50k GHST budget\nOption 2: Yes, without 50k GHST budget\nOption 3: No, do not create the DTF\n",

      "title": " GoodGhosting <> AavegotchiDAO Collaboration Request",
      "content": "Author: Mycaleum#8283, Deepcryptodive | GoodGhosting#1044 \nGotchiID: 11921, 5109\nDiscourse Thread (Idea/Proposal): https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/aavegotchidao-x-goodghosting-collaboration-request/2975/1 \nVote duration: 5 days\n##### _Brought to you by the GoodGhosting team_\n\n![NFT](https://i.imgur.com/b22asul.png) \n\n### What is GoodGhosting? \n###### GoodGhosting is a no-loss savings game, built on top of Aave. We launched our very first DeFi savings pools on Polygon, during the summer of 2021. So far, we have helped over 7000 users to save over $600k worth of assets on Polygon. All while collecting some nice NFTs and climbing our leaderboard. \n\n###### The GoodGhosting team believes in a world where saving is rewarding, easy and fun. Yet, traditional saving is none of that. We build decentralized social saving applications that combine game design elements with goal-based saving. We want to help our community to develop better financial habits, and have fun at the same time.\n\n###### Tl;dr _If you make all deposits, you earn a slice of the pool’s interest, and additional rewards! More details can be found in the [original proposal](https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/aavegotchidao-x-goodghosting-collaboration-request/2975)_\n\n\n\n### Potential collaboration\nWe want to expose the GoodGhosting community to Aavegotchi, by introducing an **Aavegotchi-themed savings pool**. This pool will require players to save in **GHST** tokens, and earn them more GHST on top. We see it as a fun opportunity to cross-pollinate the GoodGhosting and Aavegotchi communities. \n\n###### Aavegotchi is a one-of-a-kind project we have been keeping a close eye on from the very start. Both as players and as ecosystem residents. In our opinion, it envisions everything that DeFi and Web3 is about 👻\n\n\nBesides inviting all Aavegotchi users and the DAO itself to participate in the upcoming GHST savings pool, GoodGhosting would like to request the AavegotchiDAO to **consider co-sponsoring this pool**.\n\n### Our Request\n\n- A total of **7000 GHST** in sponsorship for this savings pool.\n_To be shared between all winning players._\n\n- The ability to reward successful savers with **Gotchi XP**, _or alternatively FRENS_. _Considering GoodGhosting an extensive mini-game that encourages people to stack more GHST._\n\n- An allocation of **Aavegotchi NFTs (worth up to 3000 GHST)** to be raffled to random participants and/or to all winners. These could be Wearables, Gotchi’s, Raffle tickets or Realm parcels. _These could either be provided by the AavegotchiDAO, or alternatively purchased by the GoodGhosting team on the Bazaar. For these additional incentives, we hope to provide benefits to a small handful of lucky winners (via a raffle system), and/or a smaller reward that is feasible to be delivered to all winners._\n\n\n### What can GoodGhosting bring to the table?\n- Up to **4000 WMATIC** tokens in sponsorship (from our DeFiForAll grant). _To be shared between all winning players._\n\n- An **influx of new users** into the Aavegotchi ecosystem. _So far over 20500 users joined our Celo and Polygon savings pools. Most have not yet been exposed to Aavegotchi or GHST, and many are likely to join the Gotchigang._ \n\n- We will create a **YouTube video** explaining Aavegotchi, and how to obtain the GHST token on Polygon. Directed at our community members.\n- We will allow users to **play GoodGhosting using their Aavegotchi’s as avatar**. _This will show up in the shared ‘Players’ tab, as well as in the individual player profiles on Goodghosting.com_\n- Some very **special NFTs** by our in-house artist [Mali3D](https://www.mali3.de/)\n- An increased [GG score](https://medium.com/goodghosting/launching-the-gg-score-66acd783dd53) for all successful savers\n\n\n#### We look forward to proceeding in a way to benefit both Aavegotchi and GoodGhosting in some serious Ghostly synergy.\n\n### Do you support this proposal?\n",

No wearable raffles/auctions should introduce a scenario where H has a larger supply than L.\n2.  In cases where H already has a larger supply than L, each raffle/auction should close the gap between H’s and L’s supply until the imbalance is resolved.\n\nExample:\nThere are currently 260 mythical eyes and 200 legendary eyes, creating a supply imbalance of 60.\nIn the next raffle/auction:\nWe could drop both a legendary and mythical eye (improving the imbalance to 10 from 60)\nWe could drop just a legendary eye (eliminating the imbalance entirely)\nWe COULD NOT drop just a mythical eye (this would grow the imbalance from 60 to 110).\n\nAt a later point in time, this restriction could be lifted via another proposal.",

      "title": "Add GHST Stake to the Umbria Narni Bridge",
      "content": "The Umbria Narni Bridge has implemented the GHST token, and is facilitating cheaper migration of GHST between the Ethereum <--> Polygon networks, compared to the official Polygon bridge. The Umbria Narni bridging cost is about 1/2 of the official polygon bridge cost and is also much faster (4 minutes, as opposed to > 1 hour).\n\nThe Umbria Narni bridge protocol can bridge a maximum of 20% of its total GHST liquidity, per bridging event. For example, with $100k of GHST tokens in one side of the pool, the bridge can migrate a maximum of $20k of GHST per single transaction.  \n\nCurrently there is approximately $14,000 of GHST tokens on each side of the bridge. This is mostly funded by the Umbria team. This enables the bridge to be able to bridge a maximum of $700 of GHST tokens per transaction - which is pretty good, but we are aware that some users want to bridge much more in a single transaction.\n\nWe propose the Aavegotchi DAO add $100,000 of GHST to each bridge pool (1. Polygon and 2. Ethereum). There are a few advantages for doing so:\n\n1. The Aavegotchi DAO will earn a 0.2% bridging fee whenever anyone uses the bridge to migrate GHST tokens between Ethereum <--> Polygon. So across time, the Aavegotchi DAO will make money. If the Narni bridge ever becomes an unnecessary solution, the Aavegotchi DAO can easily remove their liquidity and enjoy their profit.\n\n2. Transactions up to approximately $21,000 of GHST will now be possible. \n\n3. Aavegotchi community will learn about our bridge which enables migration of assets for WAY cheaper than the official polygon bridge. A great quality of life improvement if they are participating in other projects too.\n\n- ETH average cost $4 - time 4 minutes, compared to > 1 hour\n- USDT average cost $9 - time 4 minutes, compared to > 1 hour\n- USDC average cost $9 - time 4 minutes, compared to > 1 hour\n- MATIC average cost $9 - time 4 minutes, compared to > 7 days\n\n4. Unlike the official Polygon bridge who offer absolutely no technical support, even in the event of a bridge error (You literally just lose your funds), the Umbria Narni bridge has a dedicated discord support team who have an excellent reputation for speedily resolving any issues and guarantee transaction resolution in the event of an unforeseen error. \n\n---\n\nThe Umbria Narni bridge is administered and coordinated by a publicly listed company Online Blockchain PLC from the UK, who are bound by the rules and regulations of the UK financial conduct authority. It has also been audited by ADVFN, and is in the process of several other audits. \n\nThe Umbria project is officially partnered with polygon, as well as a number of popular NFT projects including Zedrun, Aavegotchi, The Red Village and many others. \n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, I (Dev Oskii - @OskiiDev on twitter and \"! Dev Oskii | Umbria Network\" on Discord) would be more than happy to answer them in the official Umbria discord channel https://discord.gg/Epse2vauA8\n\nI hope you approve this DAO proposal so our platform can improve the user experience for Aavegotchi.\n\nThanks for reading :)",

      "title": "[AGIP18] Gotchiverse Patch v0.1",
      "content": "**Author:** Jesse | gldnXross#6482\n**GotchiID:** 8497\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (9M)\n**Vote duration:** 7 days\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Discourse Thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/gotchiverse-paatch-v0-1-thread/2791\n**Blog post:** https://aavegotchi.medium.com/vote-now-aavegotchidao-end-of-the-year-xp-extravaganza-ce8f9dddfaec\n\n## Patch v0.1\nAlthough the Gotchiverse is not yet live, we have identified a few areas that we believe should be adjusted before the game is released, and would like to bring these items to the community’s attention for discussion and a decision on whether or not to enact. \n\nTo ensure no single proposed change can revert the entire batch, we originally created six separate snapshot SigProp Proposals. This CoreProp combines the successful SigProps into the first Gotchiverse Patch v0.1!\n\nMore details can be found in the Medium Post: https://aavegotchi.medium.com/vote-now-aavegotchidao-end-of-the-year-xp-extravaganza-ce8f9dddfaec\n\n### **Patch 0.1a**\nAs we were finalizing key details such as build costs and harvesting rates for the upcoming Whitepaper, we discovered that one of our key assumptions had undervalued the amount of Alchemica in each parcel relative to total supply. The patch will increase the amount of Alchemica under each parcel to match our initial Alchemica tokens’ supplies, allocations, and emissions rates.\n\nThe SigProp for Patch 0.1a passed with the following numbers:\nYes: 13.14M GHST\nNo: 41.85k GHST\n\n### **Patch 0.1b**\nAlthough our original intention was to make boosts one-time only, it is clear that many in the community interpreted the GEO paper to mean that boosts would be replenished. This patch allows boosts to also replenish together with the parcel itself after each Great Battle.\n\nHowever, unlike parcels, the replenish rate is a fixed amount that is the same per round. For example, a parcel with a “5” FUD boost receives 5 servings of FUD per boost round.\n\nThe SigProp for Patch 0.1b also passed pretty convincingly:\nYes: 10.36M GHST\nNo: 2.37M GHST\n\n### **Patch 0.1c**\nEven with Patch 0.1b passed, boosts will still be undervalued compared to the value the market has assigned to them, relative to a similar parcel with no boosts. Patch 0.1c proposed increasing boosts by 5x to bring the value of a boost closer to what the market is currently valuing it at. \n\nThe SigProp for Patch 0.1c **did not pass** and **WILL NOT BE INCLUDED** in Patch v0.1:\nYes: 5.85M GHST\nNo: 8.04M GHST\n\nFuture SigProps may be created to address this issue separately.\n\n### **Patch 0.1d**\nThe Gotchiverse Litepaper mentions that Kinship will be exchanged for a serving of Alchemica, essentially “burning” kinship. We certainly want to maintain the idea of a “kinship boost” for channeling but after thinking more deeply, we now believe there is a better way to achieve this. \n\nAn “achievements” approach does not require depleting an Aavegotchi’s kinship. Instead, high kinship Aavegotchis will channel Alchemica at a slightly higher rate, depending on their achievement level.\n\nThe SigProp for Patch 0.1d also passed:\nYes: 12.64M GHST\nNo: 431.93k GHST\n\n### **Patch 0.1e & 0.1f**\nDistricts did not exist as a Citaadel concept when the Litepaper was first published. That said, we have always envisioned an area or areas for Pixelcraft to develop in-depth experiences that add value to the overall game. Likewise, one of our earliest ideas, (predating the Citaadel itself!) was to reserve a town square for real time DAO voting. The idea of having a gamified governance experience was one of the very earliest ideas seeding Aavegotchi’s need for its own virtual world.\n\nPatch 0.1e & 0.1f proposed allocating 1000 parcels each to Pixelcraft and the AavegotchiDAO in D27/D30. Both Patches passed convincingly:\n\nYes: 11.94M GHST / 12.14M GHST\nNo: 615.78k GHST / 734.92k GHST\n\n## Conclusion\nAnd that’s it for the first Gotchiverse Patch! Now it is up to you, the AavegotchiDAO, to decide if Patch v0.1 should be implemented or not.\n\n\nOption 1: Yes, implement Patch v0.1\nOption 2: No, do not implement Patch v0.1\n",

      "title": "Should we start rarity farming season 3 in Q1?",
      "content": "Author: Cookiethief#3952\nGotchi ID: 1998\nDiscourse Thread (Idea/Proposal): https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/season-3-for-q1-2022/2779\n\nProblem: \nCurrently, rarity farm seasons happen sporadically and are difficult to account for in the cadence of Aavegotchi releases. It leaves investors wondering if they should hold onto their gotchis and wearables, or if they might find better ROI flipping into the next rounds. It would be desirable to have a bit of certainty / predictability for both investor sentiment and for planning purposes. \n\nSolution: \nWhen possible funding-wise, rarity farms should be a quarterly event. It would fit in with the seasonal nature we are already following, and if properly planned could be sustainable based on GBM sales in-between seasons, treasury revenue via staking and partnerships (such as the umbra bridge proposal also live now), and other streams of revenue such as DAO grants. The author of this proposal believes rarity farming is an essential part of the gotchiverse ecosystem, and something to build out and improve upon rather than scrap.\n\nFor season 3, I suggest we go back to the standard reward ratio, as was tried and tested in rarity farming season 1. \nThe rookies of the similarly named rookie board are now all grown up and ready to compete with the big boys.  This would mean 70% of payouts go to the BRS leaderboard,  20% to the kinship leaderboard and 10% to the XP leaderboard. \n\nIdeally, we would kick the rarity farm off in mid-late January 2022; this would fit snugly into the timing of the gotchiverse release, and would position us right in the first quarter of a new fiscal year.",

      "title": "[RF S3] Replacing the Kinship Leaderboard with BOOSTED Dependability",
      "content": "[Summary]\nWith no Rookies and no Kinship burn, climbing the Kinship leaderboard will be very expensive. Despite the occasional Chad move, we won't see any significant movement. The most diligently pet H2 Gotchis made it to the tail end of the overall Kinship leaderboard in one huge tie of over 200 Gotchis that never missed a pet and never drank a potion. All those ties are broken by XP, essentially turning a large part of the Kinship leaderboard in an expansion of the XP leaderboard.\nHence, this proposal seeks to replace the Kinship Leaderboard for Season 3 of Rarity Farming with a BOOSTED Dependability Leaderboard that is tie-broken by interaction time-shift.\n\n[Introduction]\nAn explanation of what dependability is can be found in the discourse thread linked below. It fixes the major issues we've seen with the Kinship leaderboard and does not require a Rookie exclusive version to give newly summoned Gotchis good chances to climb the leaderboard.\n\n[Effect]\nWhen we launch RF S3, Gotchis from H2 would see little to no rewards from an overall Kinship leaderboard. And as we've seen with the Rookie Kinship leaderboards, another Rookie Leaderboard for Kinship would just result in a huge number of ties, essentially turning the rookie Kinship leaderboard into a partial Rookie XP leaderboard.\nAt the last snapshot of RF S2, Haunt 2 Gotchis made it into the Top 400 of the Dependability leaderboard, seen on aavegotchi.pet\nUsing a Potion Boosted version of Dependability with time-shift as tie breaker, we'd end up with a leaderboard that is entirely based on interactions that newly summoned Gotchis of any Haunt, would be able to climb much faster than the traditional Kinship leaderboard. The exact details are explained in the discourse thread linked below.\n\n[Goal]\nTo create an interaction based Leaderboard that is as fair as possible to all the different kinds of Gotchi owners.\n\n[Disclaimer]\nAuthor: CryptoGotchi\nGotchiID: 8612\n\n[Discourse]\nDAO discussion:\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/rf-s3-replacing-the-kinship-leaderboard-with-boosted-dependability/2815",

      "content": "Author: PG#0811\nGotchiID: 4895\nDiscourse thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/new-designated-wearable-for-guild-insignia/2118/24\n\n[Context]\n\nThe Gotchiverse will be launching soon and guilds have started to form in preparation. One type of installation they will be able to build on their parcels is the Gotchi Lodge. With it guilds will be able to provide their members with the opportunity to participate in communal channeling.\n\nCommunal channeling is defined in the litepaper as:\n\n\"Aavegotchis can also collectively channel Alchemica when a Gotchi Lodge Installation has been built upon the REALM Parcel. In order to participate in communal channeling, the Aavegotchi must be wearing the associated Guild Insignia and be present on the REALM Parcel during the ritual. For every additional Aavegotchi participating in the Communal Channeling ritual, Alchemica will be farmed more rapidly.\"\n\nThe Aavegotchi team further specified that it would use existing wearables which prompted guilds to adopt specific wearables as their insignias. From the alpha that was released regarding the lodge installation we believe those insignias would also be linked to the lodge.\n\n[Proposition]\n\nAdd support for custom guild insignias NFTs in addition to existing wearables for participation in communal channeling\n\n[Goals]\n\n- Give free access to communal channeling for guild members by not requiring to buy a wearable to participate\n- Remove the potential impact of the guild wearable on the gotchi BRS or abilities\n- Remove the necessity to block a slot with a specific wearable to participate in communal channeling\n\n[Options]\n\n1. Add the possibility of holding another type of NFT in the pocket to participate in communal channeling\n\nBenefits:\n- Add a free to play option for participation in communal channeling\n- Does not occupy a slot and does not affect BRS or stats\n- Unique guild insignia makes it easy to upgrade or replace if necessary\n- Allow for custom designs that relate closely to the guild theme and encourage creators in the community\n\nLimitations :\n- Lodge would need to support generic contracts (dev time)\n- Unlimited supply means communal channeling participant number would only be limited by land surface (parcel or estate)\n- Free option means users could more easily participate in more than one guild\n- Potential to negatively impact wearables price if guilds massively decide to use custom insignias instead of wearables\n\n2. Change nothing (only existing wearables can be used for communal channeling)\n\nBenefits:\n- Easier to implement (only need to support existing wearables)\n- Exclusive utility for wearables which can help support the price\n- Some guilds have already disclosed their chosen wearable for communal channeling (stays in line with the litepaper)\n\nLimitations :\n- Add an upfront cost to participate in communal channeling\n- Make wearables more scarce and less liquid\n- Finite choice of wearables (could be a limiting factor for some guilds)\n- Could negatively affect BRS or stats by forcing to equip a specific wearable\n",

This committee will initially be composed of 8 members with reassessment of membership by the DAO within 6 months.\n\nAs of 12/07/2021, the DAO treasury (https://aavegotchi.com/treasury) currently boasts nearly ~$11,408,400 worth of DAI and GHST. In its initial form, the committee will form proposals for consideration by the DAO which will subsequently be voted on and, if passed, enacted. \n\nProposed Mission Statement\nThe Aavegotchi DAO Treasury Taask Force is a dynamic committee assigned with making DAO treasury management proposals to the community and DAO for consideration. The initial mission and goals of the committee will be: 1) Grow and optimize the DAO treasury with an emphasis on safety, security and transparency; 2) Partner with Pixelcraft to assist in developing and identifying tools and infrastructure for ongoing DAO Treasury management; and 3) foster and encourage growth of the overall Aavegotchi community by increasing awareness, actively promoting adoption, and maintaining current user engagement\n\nThe initial 8 members of the DTF\nBowtiedNerd\nMori\nletsgobankless\nAddison\nDeucehearts\nBackfireCapital\nSwappi\nDr Wagmi\n\nWe appreciate the Aavegotchi community’s support and look forward to our first proposal.\n\nOption 1: Yes.

      "content": "*Disclaimer: I’m posting this on behalf of the SynFutures team with some slight edits by me.*\n\nAuthor: Moon & SynFutures Team\nGotchi ID: 3541\nDiscourse Thread (Idea/Proposal): https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/provide-ghst-as-liquidity-on-the-derivatives-dex-synfutures/2664\n\nSince Aavegotchi has gathered a lot of liquidity on Spot DEXes, it is high time for Aavegotchi to create and boost its Futures market. Derivatives markets make up the majority of global trading activity and allow users to leverage their investments. Adding GHST liquidity on SynFutures would allow people to take on leverage longs (or shorts) on the future of Aavegotchi. But why SynFutures?\n\n**Great investors and team background**\nSynFutures is backed by Polychain, Pantera, Dragonfly, Framework, Standard Crypto, Woo, and more. The team’s background is a great combination of traditional finance and DeFi. SynFutures is the only project of its kind which can support the listing of any assets by anyone in a permissionless manner (in less than 30s). The project has the potential to be the No’1 Derivatives DEX.\n\n**Security**\nBacked by solid experience from the TradFi financial engineering and DeFi protocol safety, SynFutures has many risk management features (e.g. anti-flashloan attack, EMA smoothing method, etc.) and has gone through external code audits.\n\n**Easy to manage and start**\nSynFutures supports a single token model to add liquidity which means the Aavegotchi Treasury would only have to deposit GHST instead of offering two tokens with the risk of impermanent loss. We are asking for 200k worth of GHST tokens to kickstart the pool. The liquidity could be withdrawn anytime.\n\n**Growth Potential**\nTrading volume and users are growing fast on SynFutures. For the past 3 months since ^the SynFutures Alpha launched, we reached 47k users of and $1bn+ in trading volume. All this happened without a native SynFutures token, which could attract even more users.\n\n**Volume analysis**\nQuickswap/SynFutures:\nTotal LPs: 150k / 40K\nTotal traders: 100k / 20k\nDaily trading volume: $100M / $29M\n\nSynFutures trading volume makes up ~1/3rd of QuickSwap, and the amount traders is 1/5th as big as on QuickSwap, however, the trading volume for different pairs is more concentrated. SynFutures has 108 trading pairs while QuickSwap has more than 22k pairs. For example, the daily trading volume of Matic-USDC on SynFutures closes in on around $9M, while Quickswap reaches $14M.",

However, there is room for improving the short-term possibilities through seasonal gaming events. The main problem is the lack of structure and funds.\n\n**Solution**\nBefore creating a dedicated Aarcade DAO, the first step to enable play2earn rewards is to create a sustainable stream of funds. A simple and low-risk solution would be to stake a portion of the main DAO treasury, such as 100k GHST, to generate FRENS. Those could be then transformed into raffle tickets and given away to mini-game players through periodic events.\n\n**Potential risks**\nStaking GHST will indirectly imply a dilution of FRENS/tickets. However, since they would be distributed via mini-game rewards, the impact should be minimal compared to the boost on engagement and appeal to new people.\n\n**Alternatives**\nWait for the Aarcade DAO to launch and let the new committee decide how to designate funds.\n\nOption 1: Yes, stake 100K GHST\nOption 2: No, wait for an Aarcade DAO",

That said, we have always envisioned an area or areas for Pixelcraft to develop in-depth experiences that add value to the overall game. Likewise, one of our earliest ideas, (predating the Citaadel itself!) was to reserve a town square for real time DAO voting. The idea of having a gamified governance experience was one of the very earliest ideas seeding Aavegotchi’s need for its own virtual world. \n\nPerhaps this is why the thought of amending the Litepaper or publishing an official change regarding district allocations slipped through the cracks. We spoke about the Pixelcraft and DAO square areas as if they’d always existed! The idea for districts partially arose out of these two “squares” along with a combination of our development tracks reinforcing one another: gameplay, map design, auction prep, and progress with the path to smart contract executed non-playable characters (NPCs).\n\nIt was no ill intent and definitely an oversight. That said, we recognize that it is indeed a big allocation and are fine with whichever way the DAO votes on keeping or removing the 1000 parcels for Pixelcraft Studios currently assigned to District 27.\n\nOption 1: Yes, implement Patch 0.1e\nOption 2: No, do not implement Patch 0.1e \n",

We certainly want to maintain the idea of a “kinship boost” for channeling but after thinking more deeply, we now believe there is a better way to achieve this. An “achievements” approach does not require depleting an Aavegotchi’s kinship. Instead, high kinship Aavegotchis will channel Alchemica at a slightly higher rate, depending on their achievement level.\n\nAn achievements approach is advantageous in a number of ways. Generally, achievements based rewards are far easier to understand, since variations of such are already a common mechanic within all sorts of games. Achievements are intuitive, give players specific goals and help players easily differentiate their own play from peers. In contrast, the original idea of burning kinship for Alchemica directly doesn’t deliver on any of those mentioned benefits. Instead, you either have to burn the kinship (hurting your poor Aavegotchi) or install a parallel, in-game only, kinship score that we can see becomes quite cumbersome in implementation.\n\nOption 1: Yes, implement Patch 0.1d\nOption 2: No, do not implement Patch 0.1d ",

We propose increasing boosts by **5X** to bring the value of a boost closer to what the market is currently valuing it at.\n\nFor example, instead of 1 FOMO Boost guaranteeing 500 FOMO to be farmed, a single FOMO boost would instead mean 2500 FOMO. While this may sound dramatic, it actually is a conservative option among the variety of choices available. A single FOMO Boost at 5X still pales in comparison to the amount of FOMO present in a single Spacious parcel.\n\n[VIEW THE COMPARISONS: https://aavegotchi.medium.com/vote-now-aavegotchidao-end-of-the-year-xp-extravaganza-ce8f9dddfaec]\n\nThe surface level Alchemica is a major feature of the world map and gameplay, so we think it makes sense to better align the messaging of the game design and presentation with the reality of the boosts. A boost without much meaning is not something we intended.\n\n**While other game features can be tweaked at any point, this is the last opportunity to right imbalances that pertain to tokenomics.** It’s time to lock in the smart contracts and we think this “boost to boosts” is worthy of another draft. \n\nOption 1: Yes, implement Patch 0.1c\nOption 2: No, do not implement Patch 0.1c",

The patch will increase the amount of Alchemica under each parcel to match our initial Alchemica tokens’ supplies, allocations, and emissions rates. \n\n**[TABLE OF NEW VALUES CAN BE FOUND ON MEDIUM POST:  https://aavegotchi.medium.com/vote-now-aavegotchidao-end-of-the-year-xp-extravaganza-ce8f9dddfaec]**\n\nAs you can see, the originally published chart suggests the totals are for the entirety of emissions for ACT 1 (roughly the first two years of the Gotchiverse’s existence) but in fact these emissions rates per parcel type are only for the **first Round** of ACT 1.\n\nPatch 0.1a updates the average allocations by roughly 4x to match our original assumptions for Act 1.

      "content": "**Author:** Cookiethief\n**GotchiID:** 8161\n**XP Reward:** 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in the voter’s wallet\n**Quorum requirement:** 20% (roughly 9M according to https://aavegotchi.com/quorum/)\n**Discourse Thread:** https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/voting-power-for-land-plots/2508\n\n**CoreProp Edits**\nAn option for \"Auction floor\" has also been added. This brings the \nVote Differential up to 20%, meaning that any option must have 20% higher than the next option to pass.\n\n**Problem:**\nWith a new asset class added to the Aavegotchi family in the form of realm plots comes a new sink of GHST. This currently leaves those who have heavily invested into the new plots with much lesser voting power in the Aavegotchi DAO.\n\n**Solution:**\nSince realm plots and the Gotchiverse are such an integral part of the Aavegotchi ecosystem, I believe it's only right that realm owners get an amount of voting power that is proportional to the size of their realm plots. This ensures that their vote can be heard, which is of particular importance when future governance proposals will concern the Gotchiverse.\n\nSince every plot has a set size in pixels which is also a scaling factor for the amount of alchemica within the plot, the suggestion brought forward is:\n\n1 pixel = 1 GHST worth of voting power (64, 256, 2056)\nOR\n1 pixel = 0.5 GHST worth of voting power (32, 128, 1028)\n\nAn alternative would be to give every plot flat voting power based on the auction floor, with a vote afterward allowing for fine-tuning of final voting power amounts while ensuring that all land owners will have a say.\n\nThis would give 100, 200, and 1300 GHST worth of voting power to humbles, reasonables, and spacious parcels, respectively. \n\nOption 1: Yes, give REALM parcels a voting power of 0.5 GHST/pixel\nOption 2: Yes, give REALM parcels a voting power of 1 GHST/pixel\nOption 3: Yes, give REALM parcels a voting power based on auction floor\nOption 4: No, don’t give REALM parcels voting power",

For example, a parcel with a “5” FUD boost would receive 5 servings of FUD per boost round. \n\nFailing to implement boost replenishment alongside Patch 0.1a’s boosted tokenomics would result in a dramatically nerfed use case for surface level boosts, which is contrary to our world and auction map designs.\n\nLike parcel replenishments, topping up boosts after each Great Battle does not take away from the original emissions intentions.\n\nOption 1: Yes, implement Patch 0.1b\nOption 2: No, do not implement Patch 0.1b\n",

      "title": "Should we give voting power to REALM plots?",
      "content": "Author: Cookiethief\nGotchi ID:  8161\nDiscourse Thread (Idea/Proposal): https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/voting-power-for-land-plots/2508\n\nProblem:\nWith a new asset class added to the Aavegotchi family in the form of realm plots comes a new sink of GHST. This currently leaves those who have heavily invested into the new plots with much lesser voting power in the Aavegotchi DAO. \n\nSolution: \nSince realm plots and the Gotchiverse are such an integral part of the Aavegotchi ecosystem, I believe it's only right that realm owners get an amount of voting power that is proportional to the size of their realm plots. This ensures that their vote can be heard, which is of particular importance when future governance proposals will concern the Gotchiverse.\n\nSince every plot has a set size in pixels which is also a scaling factor for the amount of  alchemica within the plot, the suggestion brought forward is to **equal 1 pixel to 1 GHST worth of voting power**.\n\nThis would mean a Humble plot has a voting power of **64 GHST**\nA Reasonable plot has a voting power of **256 GHST**\nAnd finally, a Spacious plot has a voting power of **2048 GHST**\n\nTo put this into context with the most recent realm auction: \nThe Humble mean price was: **236.84 GHST**\nThe Reasonable mean price was: **430.94 GHST**\nThe Spacious mean price was: **1730.29 GHST**\n\nAn alternative that was put forward in the DAO discussion thread would be to give every plot a voting power weighted at **half a GHST per pixel**; this would put all three sizes well below their GBM floor price, with a vote afterward allowing for fine-tuning of final voting power amounts while ensuring that all land owners will have a say with their newly enabled 0.5 GHST/pixel voting power.\n\nThis would mean a Humble plot has a voting power of **32 GHST**\nA Reasonable plot has a voting power of **128 GHST**\nAnd finally, a Spacious plot has a voting power of **1024 GHST**\n",

Due to the complexity of the different possible trait ranges of gotchis, and the variety of possible wearable stats, it is not an easy task to arrive at a balanced distribution of equippable items. Releasing new wearables without proper analysis can lead to duplication (and dilution) of existing items and further skew of practical applicable sets for gotchis with trait ranges in certain directions.\n\n### Specifications:\nThis proposal aims to introduce a Wearables Taask Force (WTF), the idea of which arose from discussions regarding the above concerns. Akin to the FRENS Taask Force, the goal of the WTF would be to assist Pixelcraft in the analysis of the current distribution of items within the ecosystem from a slot, rarity, and trait modifiers perspective, and in how this analysis can best be applied to future items. This Taask Force would NOT have the unilateral ability to determine what and how new items are released, but would function entirely in an advisory capacity.\n\n### Nominees:\nThe nominees for the Taask Force include long term community members who have a wide range of applicable skills, including statistical analysis, programming ability, strong experience in baazaar activity, and prior DAO experience. This Taask Force would greatly benefit from as many voices and perspectives as possible, so all nominations are included. \n\nEstablishing this Taask Force would be a major step forward in creating a more balanced ecosystem and helping the AavegotchiDAO mature.\n\nFull list of nominees: Kuwlness, JG1 (Fantasma#1777), Bearded, Actaeon, Thunderfish, Letsgobankless, Kokusho, Ader1990.eth, Machete, Aimo217 (AL#4105), Notorious_BTC, MonsterRNG, Goobz, Diddlypoo\n\n### Options\nOption 1: Yes, establish the Wearables Taask Force\nOption 2: No, don’t establish the Wearables Taask Force",

      "title": "[AGIP13] Introduce an Aging Boost for Aavegotchis",
      "content": "**Author**: diddlypoo\n**Gotchi ID**: 15560\n**XP Reward**: 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in voter’s wallet\n**Quorum requirement**: 20% (roughly 7.5M according to aavegotchi.com/quorum)\n**Vote Differential**: 10%\n**Voting Duration**: 7 days\n**DAO Discussion thread**:  https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/coreprop-agip13-gotchi-aging-discussion-thread/2362\n \n**A short list of notable adjustments have been made from the SigProp and are highlighted here with this update:**\n\n- **The implementation will be slightly modified to use the available onchain data of birth block timestamp as opposed to block number**, with epoch times predetermined using the same fibonacci intervals proposed in the sigprop and the current average block time. This makes the implementation much simpler, allows for predictable timelines (since a block time denominator would be constant, as opposed to variable based on chain activity), as well as ensures the functionality of the mechanic should any potential cases of architecture or blockchain network changes occur in the future. The petting time intervals already function using real time, so a precedent for this exists.\n\n- **The 10 BRS cap is removed**. The fibonacci intervals themselves act as a natural cap, as the time to reach further epochs approximates an exponential function. For example, it will take over 4 more years to get an additional BRS bonus (+11 total), then 6.5 years for another, then 10.5 years, etc.\n\n- **The implementation would go live prior to the beginning of Rarity Farming Season 2**. One of the goals of aging is to provide a short term buffer to the effects of statistical variance once a new haunt is released. For Haunt 1's to be able to experience any of this benefit at all, the implementation must go live as soon as possible, as by the middle of season 2 H2's will already be mostly caught up to the H1 bonus, with only a 1-2 BRS difference.\n\n# AGIP13 - Aavegotchi Aging Mechanic\n\nThis sigprop proposes a small BRS boost to gotchis as they age, to counteract statistical variance between haunts and reward long term engagement.\n\n## Problem\nAs new haunts are released, whether or not they include a bug fix that impacts gotchi trait generation, a strong dilution of existing high BRS gotchis occurs. Due to the nature of rarity farming and its rewards, this dilution is exclusively felt by those who invested heavily into older haunts, and who may not have the desire to sell due to emotional attachment, the means to invest more, or the ability to \"flip\" their way (due to local tax laws) into higher BRS gotchis from the newer haunts. Furthermore, very significant statistical variance can occur in new haunts, making it near impossible to make long term financial decisions, as the variance can render previous haunt gotchis all but obsolete. This leaves far too much entirely up to \"luck\".\n\n## Solution\nThe Aging Mechanic is a proposal, initially introduced by Tistou on discord, that is designed to address all of the above mentioned issues, as well as create an interesting new dynamic of Aavegotchis that can be built upon in the future (age limits for activities, wearables, new appearance qualities, etc). It provides a buffer of approximately 6 months during which older gotchis have a BRS boost over newly summoned gotchis. As newly summoned gotchis age, they quickly begin to catch up to their older counterparts.\n\nIn the spirit of using numbers occurring in nature, the formula is modeled after the Fibonacci numbers x 1 million, but replacing the first 0 with a 1 to better fit the use case. Specifically, the first 10 Fibonacci numbers (replacing the first 0) are 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, the sum of which is 89. Following this formula would mean +1 BRS after 1 million blocks, then another +1 BRS after 2 million blocks, another +1 BRS after 3 million blocks, another +1 BRS after 5 million blocks, …, up to a final sum of +10 BRS after 89 million blocks (approx 6.5 years using average block time of 2.3 seconds - the average since May 1st).\n\nList of first 10 epochs (cumulative BRS boost -> # of blocks elapsed since birth):\n\n+1 -> 1 million\n+2 -> 2 million\n+3 -> 3 million\n+4 -> 5 million\n+5 -> 8 million\n+6 -> 13 million\n+7 -> 21 million\n+8 -> 34 million\n+9 -> 55 million\n+10 -> 89 million\n\nThis solution provides for a quicker boost in the first few epochs of age, and greatly flattens over time to avoid anything too OP and allow more recently summoned gotchis to eventually catch up to within a 1 BRS boost of their older and wiser brethren. It incentivizes opening and summoning portals as opposed to sitting on them, both boosting the in-game economy as well as the scarcity of those that are still chosen to remain closed. Most of all, it is a fair system that benefits no one haunt over any other, and simply rewards long term engagement, while counteracting the effects of sudden and aggressive dilution like we are currently witnessing.",

The max XP rewarded via Realm Aadventures in this proposal is 100XP per Aavegotchi.\n\nAll players should have the opportunity to experience and play to earn some XP. For the upcoming Realm this should be done via Realm Aadventures and Realm Tutorial Adventures. \n\nXP should be rewarded to players for players who complete Realm Tutorial Aadventures and ordinary Realm Aadventures. The purpose of the Realm Tutorial Aadventure is to engage and learn how to interact with the Aavegotchi Realm.\n\nA Realm Aadventure are metaverse adventures, commonly known in video games as in-game quests. Players are to be guided by a mix of non-playable characters, playable characters, prompts, Web3 tools, video game assets for an immersive experience. The activities and objectives of each Aadventure will vary, but they should be like other metaverses and video game MMORPGs and RPGs. An example is completing a dungeon, creating a potion, or using the chatbox for the first time. Aadventures completion history are to be stored with the Aavegotchi.\n\nRealm Tutorial Aadventures should be longer lasting with the intention of teaching mechanics of Aavegotchi ecosystem and the realm. Ordinary Aadventures can be short, longer lasting, or seasonal. They are differentiated from Tutorial Aadventures because they guide users/players into participating in the storyline, spending time in the realm, and/or community building.\n\nXP should be rewarded through Realm Aadventures or Realm Tutorial Aadventures via this proposal should total no more than 100 XP per Aavegotchi.

However, there is room for improving the short-term possibilities through seasonal gaming events. The main problem is the lack of structure and funds.\n\nSolution\n---\nBefore creating a dedicated Aarcade DAO, the first step to enable play2earn rewards is to create a sustainable stream of funds. A simple and low-risk solution would be to stake a portion of the main DAO tresury, such as 100k GHST, to generate FRENS. Those could be then transformed into raffle tickets and given away to mini-game players through periodic events.\n\nPotential risks\n---\nStaking GHST will indirectly imply a dilution of FRENS/tickets. However,  since they would be distributed via mini-game rewards, the impact should be minimal compared to the boost on engagement and appeal to new people.\n\nAlternatives\n---\nWait for the Aarcade DAO to launch and let the new committee decide how to designate funds. However, this alternative option would mean loosing precious time to generate more attractive rewards.\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "\"Goodie Bags\" (Portals) for Wearables",
      "content": "I've thought it would be interesting to use Chainlink VRF and probabilities to generate items, instead of a set number per release. \n\nThe initial thought was to have what I'm calling a \"Goodie Bag\" of Gotchi wearables-- what inside isn't known until opened. Each Goodie Bag would contain 5 wearables of varying rarity. Unlike portals where you have to choose one Gotchi, i was hopeful all 5 wearables would be claimable. There could be a \"minimum included rarity\" so that all 5 items are not commons.\n\nThere's a couple ways to do this through probabilities-- using a \"stacked deck\" approach, where there are 500 of \"X\" uncommon items, scattered throughout each of the 1000 bags. There will always be 500 of item \"X\" and as the packs are opened, the probability of earning X in a bag can vary. Chainlink could be used to determine which goodie bags each wearable goes into.\n\nP( \"X\" | 0 bags opened) = 500/5000 =10% (1000 bags*5 wearables per bag) \nP( \"X\" | 500 bags opened, 300 with X) = 200/500 = 40%\nP( \"X\" | 500 bags opened, 100 with X) = 400/500 = 80%\n\nAnother would be to have set probabilities for each item, goodie bag, or even rarity type, and have a \"Expected quantity\" of items based on the number of goodie bags released. If 1000 bags (5000 potential items) were released, we can expect to see 10% of all items be item \"X\", or about 500. If each wearable were unique in a bag (cannot receive 2 \"X\" in same bag) then the expected qty would be 100 of item X. \n\nPER ITEM probability\nEach item has a set probability, could be designed to receive the same item multiple times in a bag, or prevent it!\n\nChainlink would be used to determine the probability of each item being crafted upon goodie bag opening. \n\nEssentially, the concept of having wearable drops within a \"goodie bag\" has massive potential. Using probability entirely, there's a chance for ONLY ONE ITEM TO BE CREATED. If using a stacked deck, bazaar prices could go craazy if the high rarity items haven't been pulled! Requiring people to choose one or some of the items could add even further market complexities! The possibilities are endless FRENS!\n\n",

The idea here with aavegotchi's is to incentivize derivative projects either thru grants or wearables sets or some other form of 'payment'. The reasoning for this is to engage community building beyond just minigaames.\n\nAn example derivative project could be one gotchi to claim a generative set of NFT ghosts which could then be placed in the realm paarcels in the future as a form of decoration.Or cacti wearable holders can claim some generative cactus NFT that could act as in game furniture as well.\n\nJust a little idea to pop the cherry on my first proposal.",

My thinking is that \"rarity\" is inherently tied to all of H1 based on when they were summoned and how early someone participated in this dope project.  If anything should be considered rare, shouldn't it be the first 10,000?  They will forever be \"rare\", so it doesn't seem out of the REALM to give a tiny boost of rarity score based on the haunt number.  I suppose it could apply in the future as well, whenever we do H3.\n\nPerhaps one solution would be adding a rarity increase to the Background item that all H1's received and can equip.  Or maybe that isn't even possible and there would need to be a new item dropped to all H1 gotchis... just spitballing and I know someone smarter than I would be able to come up with a solution.\n\nJust my thoughts.  If we are talking \"rare\", why not include a boost based on the Haunt they belong to.  Your thoughts?",

      "content": "NOTE: This poll uses approval based voting. This means you can vote for as many options as you wish. This is to prevent the dilution of votes between choices 1 and 2.\n\nWith the release of Haunt 2 comes new gotchis that use collateral from the AAVE Polygon market. This opens up the potential for gotchis to take on debt using their spirit force collateral. Spirit force is currently underutilized, with most gotchis simply storing the minimum amount of collateral necessary to keep it alive. Allowing gotchis to take on debt would increase the utility of the gotchis, and would add the potential for gotchis to be liquidated for the sadistic gamblers among us.\n\nAdditionally, AAVE has a credit delegation feature which could potentially allow the user to directly borrow assets from AAVE with credit delegated from their gotchi. If this were to be implemented, the credit delegations should be reset to zero upon any transfer of a gotchi to prevent any funny business. Because of the potential implications of this feature, this may not be technically viable to implement. As this is just a signal proposal, we will have to wait for feedback from the developers to decide whether this would be viable.\n\nAs an example, one could put 4 ETH of collateral into a gotchi. The gotchi would then be able to borrow up to 3 ETH worth of any asset from AAVE, which would then be able to be transferred to your wallet for you to use for anything your heart desires.\n\nLet's get liquidated, gotchigang!\n\nDiscussion Thread:\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/proposal-allow-gotchis-to-take-on-debt/2161\n",

Depending on the risk of Impermanent Loss (IL) these numbers can vary, originally it was +35% for GHST-QUICK, +20% for GHST-ETH and +10% for GHST-USDC. Because the rates have to be manually adjusted and prices have moved quite a bit since this was introduced, the FRENS rewards are off by quite a lot; GHST-QUICK is at around +90%, while GHST-USDC earns -10%.\n\n**Solution**\nQuoted from coderdan:\n\"There has been talk of setting up committees for managing certain parts of Aavegotchi, and I believe this could be an interesting candidate for such a committee. Right now we only have two [now three] pairs incentivized by FRENS, but this could change in the future.”\n\nThe “committee” could be a multisig of at least nine (maybe up to fifteen) members with strong reputation in the community and high Gotchi dependability counters. At its core, this Liquidity Committee would monitor and adjust FRENS rates to keep in check with the pre-determined rate, by performing contract calls to the GHST Staking contracts only available to a new “rateManager” role created for the committee.\"\n\nFor now the committee should just have one job - keeping the FRENS rates up-to-date. In the future this could be extended to partnerships, monitoring of FRENS inflation, etc.\n\n**Candidates**\nTwo weeks ago we created a Discourse thread (linked above) for interested parties to apply as candidates. Since then 11 people have applied. All candidates have been members of the community for a while and put forward good reasons as to why they should be chosen. As this is still within the range of 9-15, the easiest way would be to form the committee with all applicants.\n\nSo now it's up to you, AavegotchiDAO. Should we take this step in further decentralizing Aavegotchi and put the FRENS rate into the hands of:\n\nAngst, Jarrod, Kenymccornick, UnfitStone, Notorious_BTC, Doxy, Kokusho, Grip, Almond-Stew, Shanekoy and Moon\n\n",

      "content": "Author: Fren\nGotchi: Rngesus(7488)\nThread:  https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/proposal-community-wearable-drops/2033\n\nThe goal here is to allow the community to be creative and also supporting more community interaction. And of course to get some gotchi swag!\n\nEvery 1-3 months depending on the community. There would be a community wearable drop selected and voted by the community. Eventually I'd even like a snapshot-like system where you can sign off on wearables you like and want to vote for using 1 gotchi as 1 vote on the official website.\n\nThe best liked ones on the dao would be collected by a community manager and put on the official site for voting. though maybe it could be done on something like reddit or some other platform as well.\nA community manager may even use his/her own digression in picking out ones that look good.\n\nThe number of items dropped can be decided later. as well as any other details.\n\nTo BRS or not to BRS:\nWearables that have BRS will have an effect on the gotchi/wearable ratio and thus may make items lose value. due to the effect it has on the gotchi/wearable ratio. The upside however is that community wearables are actually useful in some way.\n\nCommunity wearable drops that do not have any BRS bonus instead acts as a skin you can wear to hide your ugly min/max rarity farming suit. This would help with the fact we don't have to worry about other wearables losing value making it so we can release more of them. Yet even in this case i would prefer quality over quantity. \n\nIdeas people have are often just rough drafts, it will be up to pixelcraft to refine the ideas into something that fits more in the ecosystem and artstyle.\n\nTLDR:\ndrop with brs:  just like every other piece of clothing. but the gotchi/wearable ratio might lead to a loss in value across all wearables.  so we need to limit community drops. But at least the drops will have valuable items.\n\ndrop without brs:  just a skin to put over your normal wearables.\ndrops could be more frequent in this case since it wouldn't make you win.\nunless of course there are any beauty contests coming up?",

Depending on the risk of Impermanent Loss (IL) these numbers can vary, originally it was +35% for GHST-QUICK, +20% for GHST-ETH and +10% for GHST-USDC. Because the rates have to be manually adjusted and prices have moved quite a bit since this was introduced, the FRENS rewards are off by quite a lot; GHST-QUICK is at around +90%, while GHST-USDC earns -10%.\n\n**Solution**\nQuoted from coderdan: \n\"There has been talk of setting up committees for managing certain parts of Aavegotchi, and I believe this could be an interesting candidate for such a committee. Right now we only have two [now three] pairs incentivized by FRENS, but this could change in the future.\n\nThe “committee” could be a multisig of at least nine (maybe up to fifteen) members with strong reputation in the community and high Gotchi dependability counters. At its core, this Liquidity Committee would monitor and adjust FRENS rates to keep in check with the pre-determined rate, by performing contract calls to the GHST Staking contracts only available to a new “rateManager” role created for the committee.\"\n\nFor now the committee should just have one job - keeping the FRENS rates up-to-date. In the future this could be extended to partnerships, monitoring of FRENS inflation, etc. \n\n**Candidates**\nTwo weeks ago we created a Discourse thread (linked above) for interested parties to apply as candidates. Since then 11 people have applied. All candidates have been members of the community for a while and put forward good reasons as to why they should be chosen. As this is still within the range of 9-15, the easiest way would be to form the committee with all applicants.\n\nSo now it's up to you, AavegotchiDAO. Should we take this step in further decentralizing Aavegotchi and put the FRENS rate into the hands of:\n\nAngst, Jarrod, Kenymccornick, UnfitStone, Notorious_BTC, Doxy, Kokusho, Grip, Almond-Stew, Shanekoy and Moon",

      "content": "Author: pgendreau#0811 \nGotchi ID: 4895\n\nContext: \nThe Venly wearables drop was supposed to happen on the 29th of July but there was some infrastructure issues and the drop had to be cancelled after only a few of the items were released (https://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/784303575593517087/870325906319757342).  It was decided between Venly and Pixelcraft that it would be better to auction the rest of the wearables through the GBM auction system. The actual plan is to auction them at the same time as the Haunt 2 portals. Some members of the community feel it would be better to hold a separate auction prior to the Haunt 2 release.\n\nProposition:\nOrganise a standalone event to auction the remaining Venly wearables on their own before the Haunt 2 auction. \n\nPROS:\n- Allow new users to get a feel for the GBM auction process before Haunt 2\n- Put the focus on the new set and allow for better price discovery\n- Create a more dynamic market for GHST ahead of Haunt 2 auction\n- Simpler capital allocation for users and opportunity to reuse incentives\n\nCONS:\n- More work for Pixelcraft team to organise a second event on short notice\n- New users may not have an aavegotchi yet to equip wearables",

      "content": "Author: FlameViper#7396\nID Gotchi: 7885\nDiscourse thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/airdrop-to-nft-lovers/1962/\n\nProblem being addressed:\nLack of wide exposure to Aavegotchi. Aavegotchi aimed for quality over quantity when it comes to partnerships and making a name for itself like bitcoin. Most people are still unaware that Aavegotchi exists despite having Aave in the name and various journalists reporting on it. \n\nSolution:\nI'm proposing two valueless airdrops: one to be airdropped to OpenSea users through Matic and the second to be claimed on Aavegotchi.com\n\nThe second airdrop should carry no BRS and trait value because around 300k-900k and even 3M+ will be claimable.\nThe second airdrop should be a new type of wearable like a boombox with cassettes in it or a video game cartridge instead of just another pants, shirt, hat wearable set otherwise we can always just have everyone claim 1 common ticket to enter the wearable raffles.\n\nThe first airdrop is a newly-created, detailed-description ERC1155 NFT saying you've been invited to join Aavegotchi and you have an NFT ready to be claimed which in the future might have a greater usecase, with a link that gives you information on how to claim the NFT airdrop. \n-There will be an initial airdrop wave to all OpenSea users and then a second airdrop wave to all NFT lovers(CryptoKitties, CryptoPunks, Axie Infinity, Rarible users, etc.)\n-These NFTs should be easy to generate months and years after the initial airdrop so nobody attempts to buy off the entire current supply of 300k wearables and turn it into the next Runescape party hat.\n\nI looked into Mintgate.io and what they can do is take an existing token and add a hidden link, PNG image, any content to whoever owns that specific NFT or a number of those said NFTs. \n-If possible I would like to create a channel in the Aavegotchi discord that sends the newbies directly to said channel with a role associated to them automatically for owning said NFT.\nUses for these extremely common and easy to acquire NFTs may be discussed and implemented at later dates.\n\nBecause OpenSea finally supports Matic and people can see their NFT airdrops from Matic even if they are on the Ethereum network then this is the perfect use for a cheap mass airdrop to OpenSea users and NFT lovers in general.\n\nPros:\nWide exposure for Aavegotchi.\nExtremely cheap and easy to execute.\nDoes not destroy the economy like Murall did.\nPromising further use cases for said wearables.\nJust in time for land parcels.\n\nCons:\nPeople bored that the drop is worth nothing.\nAn extremely slim chance of devaluing the current wearables.\nPeople won't like it that they missed Haunt 2 by a month because of how long it takes to bring a DAO proposal to fruition.\n\nOption A: A new type of wearable which might take longer to implement.\nOption B: A new 3-piece wearable set with a bonus common ticket.\n",

      "content": "Author: noahns#1723\n\nGotchi ID: 3267 (The Bearded Lady)\n\nDiscourse thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/dao-money-printer-go-brrr/\n\nDO YOU LIKE YIELD?? If so, vote yes. \n\nTl;DR: let’s make our inactive DAO funds earn yield, staking GHST for FRENS, and Dai on Curve\n\nSummary: The DAO treasury gets a cut of all Curve fees and all baazaar fees, and has grown into approximately $500k worth of GHST and $1m worth of Dai. These funds are currently not being used for anything.  As a responsible DAO, we should ensure that these funds are being maximized in a safe manner.\n\nThis proposal suggests that we take the first step towards becoming a financially-active DAO by generating yield on our funds.\n\nFor the GHST, I propose that we stake the DAO's GHST in the Aavegotchi FRENS single staking contract. This is risk free, and will start generating a significant amount of FRENS. Of course, we don’t have to use them if people are worried about diluting their own FRENS/raffle tickets, but by generating FRENS we’ll have options in the future to do airdrops/giveaways to promote Aavegotchi through the polygon community. To repeat, this proposal is only to start staking FRENS, not to actually spend them on anything. \n\nFor the Dai, I propose we put the funds into the Curve Aave pool, which generates yield on stablecoin assets.  For those unfamiliar, the Curve Aave pool is a pool with aUSDC, aUSDT, and aDai -- all USD stablecoins.  From an impermanent-loss perspective, this is essentially risk free since it’s just stablecoins in the pool, and Curve has established itself as a pretty safe protocol over the last several years.  The Curve site currently shows that the Aave pool is returning approximately 8% APR returns, through a combination of Aave fees, CRV rewards, and WMATIC rewards. This would give the DAO additional funds for future projects. \n\nSome community members expressed concern on Discourse about sending funds to a non-Aavegotchi protocol. My understanding is that Curve has been heavily audited, and has not had any major issues over the last several years. However, another option would be to put Dai directly into Aave (which would be significantly less yield), or not to do anything with the Dai for now. I’m hoping we can discuss this further at the discussion thread above. \n\nWAGMI frens! ",

      "content": "Author: Jesse | gldnXross#6482\nGotchi ID: 4563\nEnd Date: July 26, 2021 at 0:00 UTC\nQuorum: 20% (9.38M)\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/coreprop-launch-haunt-2/2034\n\n***Problem being addressed:***\nAccessibility to the Aavegotchi platform. Currently Aavegotchis are limited by a maximum possible 10,000 because only that many Haunt 1 Portals exist. This makes acquiring a first Aavegotchi cost prohibitive. a second Haunt of 15,000 more Portals, we aim to address this problem while respecting unique, collectible aspects of Haunt 1 Aavegotchis.\n\nOur vision is for far wider adoption of playable NFTs, and the first step to achieving that means leaving the scarcity memes behind and focusing on being able to offer meaningfully unique experiences to more people.\n\n**Solution:**\nWe are suggesting it is the right time to introduce a second Haunt of 15,000 more Portals in Haunt 2. We aim to address the accessibility problem while respecting unique, collectible aspects of Haunt 1 Aavegotchis.\n\nSo today, we are launching the Haunt 2 CoreProp, open for voting on this extremely important topic over the next 7 days. The proposal maintains all of the original Haunt 2 SigProp’s key details with one new bit of added langauge:\n\n***CoreProp Amendment 1/1***\n\nBecause rarity farming seasons are primarily funded by Portal NFT sales, the H2 SigProp needed to address reward distribution adjustments. This CoreProp maintains the same cap increase (Season 1’s 1.4 million GHST increased to 2 million GHST) but with one explicit caveat:\n\nThe rewards cap is completely amendable by the DAO and we encourage more proposals for what the Season 2 revenue cap should be (before or after any Haunt 2 auction). \n\nMany community members have expressed that they would prefer the Rarity Farming Rewards Cap to be decided later, so we are honoring that by encouraging the community to put forth some Signal Proposals on this issue. The DAO is encouraged to deliver an AGIP that can change this cap.\n\n*** Unchanged Haunt 2 Proposal Details ***\n\nHow many Portals?\n--- 15,000 Portals (each Portal summons one Aavegotchi)\n--- Each Portal contains 10 potential Aavegotchis\nStake what tokens to summon?\n--- Polygon Aave.com amTokens\nWhat Spirit Forces are completely new?\n--- WBTC, MATIC and WETH designs + GHST (pending listing on Aave.com)\nHow will Portals be distributed?\n--- 80% will be listed in a GBM bid-to-earn style Aauction\n--- 20% will be raffled\nHow does Haunt 2 relate to Season 2 of Rarity Farming?\n--- 40% of total Portal revenue will fund the Rarity Farming rewards pool.\n--- 2 new “Rookie Season” leaderboards will be added for Kinship and XP (see below)\n--- Season 2 reward distribution caps at a maximum 2 Million GHST\n--- Any additional GHST in the pool will be reserved and staked to earn more for future seasons.\n--- Top 5000 in each of the five categories will farm GHST\n\n**There are key changes since the last time we voted regarding a potential Haunt 2:**\n- Our home network, Polygon, has exploded in popularity.\n- Significant progress on the Pixelcraft Studios dev roadmap.\n- The release of details regarding The Gotchiverse Realm.\n- A new NFT drop method, powered by bid-to-earn mechanics.\n\n**There are specific differences between H1 and H2 Aavegotchis**\n- Exclusive, non-transferable H1 backgrounds for all H1 gotchis\n- Two eye shape traits reserved exclusively for H1\n- Two new eye shapes added for H2\n\n**PROS:**\n- Greatly increases accessibility\n- Drives interest preceding the launch of REALM\n- Demonstrates a successful \"supply by consensus\" model\n- Introduces new mechanics re. Rarity Farming\n\n**CONS:**\n- Risk is inherent to each in every product launch\n- Potential exists to misjudge supply and demand\n- Certain collectors strategies may not align with this approach\n- H2 Revenue Distribution\n\nThe original Haunt had a revenue split that included a massive 33% GHST token burn (along with 40% player rewards, 17% Pixelcraft income and 10% DAO funding). In retrospect, we found that such a significant burn was not the best use of capital. Lessons learned include:\n\nDampened effect:\nThe unique nature of GHST token (asset backed by DAI and minting/burning on a bonding curve) means burning has minimal impact on volatility.\n\nOpportunity costs:\nThis massive amount of value burned could have been put to work on behalf of Aavegotchi. In one example, a certain leading exchange offers an OTC desk product to high net worth individuals and institutional investors. We were approached to have GHST offered in their catalog, but in order to do so, a minimum stake north of 1 million GHST would be required. By providing that GHST, we would be exposing our token to larger scale investors and also could earn a decent percentage return for simply providing the tokens on a long term loaned basis (not selling them). If we hadn’t just lit our GHST on fire, we would have had the reserves to execute on this sort of opportunity.\n\nWar chest:\nFinally, Pixelcraft and AavegotchiDAO are extremely ambitious organizations facing their own unique challenges in regulations, taxation, and scaling. For example, potential taxation on a 33% token burn represents a significant risk factor for Pixelcraft Studios. Even if sailing is smooth, a strong war chest helps both Pixelcraft and the DAO continue healthy growth while remaining independent. While flexible and open to strategic partners, we’d rather not have to ever be in a position where we feel we must sell out to outside parties.\n\nMarketing campaigns:\nTicket giveaways are a great way to drum up interest in Aavegotchi, but since we are committed to not “pre-minting” any tickets, they must be earned by staking just like everyone else. Having more GHST to stake allows us to generate more tickets which can be used for strategic marketing campaigns and airdrops to help grow the #GotchiGang!\n\nThese are some of the main reasons we are advocating for an adjustment to the virtuous cycle to go along with any new Haunt being implemented. The new breakdown greatly reduces the burn while increasing distribution to Pixelcraft Studios and AavegotchiDAO as well. We believe the 40% rewards pool has proven very successful and should remain the same. \n\n***The proposed distribution goes as follows:***\nRewards pool = 40%\nPixelcraft Studios = 40%\nAavegotchiDAO = 15%\nGHST burn = 5%\n\n***In conclusion***\nThe growth of the Gotchi economy means that digital scarcity has its place but is not the ultimate goal. We are offering a carefully balanced approach with unique attributes retained for Haunt 1 Aavegotchis while also expanding accessibility and user growth as we barrel toward The Gotchiverse Realm and wider awareness and adoption of playable NFTs and DeFi.\n\nThank you for your consideration and vote, no matter which direction!",

      "content": "Everyone is excited for H2, which is why the SigProp already passed. Some people have criticized that so many proposed changes were bundled into a single proposal. Using a number of polls, we should assess, how close these individual proposals are to the DAOs opinion.\n\nIn this poll, we're looking at the total percentage of Rarity Farming rewards, exclusively reserved for the newest Haunt (Rookies).\n\nPixelcraft proposed reserving 20% of the Rarity Farming rewards for the newest Haunt. This is an important onboarding strategy to incentivize new people to invest into our ecosystem. It will facilitate growth and lead to a continued influx of new funds from new people. It will prevent or at least significantly reduce a potential player's feeling of \"being too late\".\n\nBut is 20% the right number? Can we afford to only invest 20% into our growing userbase? Can we afford to take those 20% from our current userbase?\n\nThis poll is not intended to arrive at a precise percentage, but instead to get a rough estimate, if the DAO prefers to invest more into our growth.",

      "content": "Author: Jesse | gldnXross#6482\nGotchi ID: 4563\nEnd Date: July 15, 2021 at 0:00 UTC\nQuorum: 20% (roughly 5M)\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/proposing-haunt-2-aauction-for-july/1876\n\n***Problem being addressed:***\nAccessibility to the Aavegotchi platform. Currently Aavegotchis are limited by a maximum possible 10,000 because only that many Haunt 1 Portals exist. This makes acquiring a first Aavegotchi cost prohibitive. a second Haunt of 15,000 more Portals, we aim to address this problem while respecting unique, collectible aspects of Haunt 1 Aavegotchis.\n\nOur vision is for far wider adoption of playable NFTs, and the first step to achieving that means leaving the scarcity memes behind and focusing on being able to offer meaningfully unique experiences to more people.\n\n***Solution:***\nWe are suggesting it is the right time to introduce a second Haunt of 15,000 more Portals in Haunt 2. We aim to address the accessibility problem while respecting unique, collectible aspects of Haunt 1 Aavegotchis.\n\nThe discussions at dao.aavegotchi.com and our Discord have heavily informed the details contained in this Signal Proposal. This vote will last one week and, if passed, we will upgrade to one more round of voting with a binding Core Proposal (CoreProp).\n\nWithout further ado, let’s lay out the SigProp’s details and also clarify some key points in regards to portal sales revenue sharing and how Haunt 2 relates to Rarity Farming Season 2.\n\n***Haunt 2 Proposal Details***\n\n**How many Portals?**\n--- 15,000 Portals (each Portal summons one Aavegotchi)\n--- Each Portal contains 10 potential Aavegotchis\n**Stake what tokens to summon?**\n--- Polygon Aave.com amTokens\n**What Spirit Forces are completely new?**\n--- WBTC, MATIC and WETH designs + GHST (pending listing on Aave.com)\n**How will Portals be distributed?**\n--- 80% will be listed in a GBM bid-to-earn style Aauction\n--- 20% will be raffled\n**How does Haunt 2 relate to Season 2 of Rarity Farming?**\n--- 40% of total Portal revenue will fund the Rarity Farming rewards pool.\n--- 2 new “Rookie Season” leaderboards will be added for Kinship and XP (see below)\n--- Season 2 reward distribution caps at a maximum 2 Million GHST\n--- Any additional GHST in the pool will be reserved and staked to earn more for future seasons.\n--- Top 5000 in each of the five categories will farm GHST\n\n***Key changes since the last time we voted regarding a potential Haunt 2:***\n\n- Our hometown, Polygon has exploded in popularity.\n- Significant progress on the Pixelcraft Studios dev roadmap.\n- The release of details regarding The Gotchiverse Realm.\n- A new NFT drop method, powered by bid-to-earn mechanics.\n\n***Specific differences between H1 and H2 Aavegotchis***\n- Exclusive, non-transferable H1 backgrounds for all H1 gotchis\n- Two eye shape traits reserved exclusively for H1\n- Two new eye shapes added for H2\n\n***PROS:***\n- Greatly increases accessibility\n- Drives interest preceding the launch of REALM\n- Demonstrates a successful \"supply by consensus\" model\n- Introduces new mechanics re. Rarity Farming\n\n***CONS:***\n- Risk is inherent to each in every product launch\n- Potential exists to misjudge supply and demand\n- Certain collectors strategies may not align with this approach\n\n\n***H2 Revenue Distribution***\nThe original Haunt had a revenue split that included a massive 33% GHST token burn (along with 40% player rewards, 17% Pixelcraft income and 10% DAO funding). In retrospect, we as the core team found such a significant burn was not the best use of capital. Lessons learned include:\n\n**Dampened effect:**\nThe unique nature of GHST token (asset backed by DAI and minting/burning on a bonding curve) means burning has minimal impact on volatility.\n\n**Opportunity costs:**\nThis massive amount of value burned could have been put to work on behalf of Aavegotchi. In one example, a certain leading exchange offers an OTC desk product to high net worth individuals and institutional investors. We were approached to have GHST offered in their catalog, but in order to do so, a minimum stake north of 1 million GHST would be required. By providing that GHST, we would be exposing our token to larger scale investors and also could earn a decent percentage return for simply providing the tokens on a long term loaned basis (not selling them). If we hadn’t just lit our GHST on fire, we would have had the reserves to execute on this sort of opportunity.\n\n**War chest:**\nFinally, Pixelcraft and AavegotchiDAO are extremely ambitious organizations facing their own unique challenges in regulations, taxation, and scaling. For example, potential taxation on a 33% token burn represents a significant risk factor for Pixelcraft Studios. Even if sailing is smooth, a strong war chest helps both Pixelcraft and the DAO continue healthy growth while remaining independent. While flexible and open to strategic partners, we’d rather not have to ever be in a position where we feel we must sell out to outside parties.\n\n**Marketing campaigns:**\nTicket giveaways are a great way to drum up interest in Aavegotchi, but since we are committed to not “pre-minting” any tickets, they must be earned by staking just like everyone else. Having more GHST to stake allows us to generate more tickets which can be used for strategic marketing campaigns and airdrops to help grow the #GotchiGang!\n\nThese are some of the main reasons we are advocating for an adjustment to the virtuous cycle to go along with any new Haunt being implemented. The new breakdown greatly reduces the burn while increasing distribution to Pixelcraft Studios and AavegotchiDAO as well. We believe the 40% rewards pool has proven very successful and should remain the same. The proposed distribution goes as follows:\n\nRewards pool = 40%\nPixelcraft Studios = 40%\nAavegotchiDAO = 15%\nGHST burn = 5%\n\n***Conclusion, time to vote!***\nThe conversation for this SigProp will continue in a new SigProp dedicated dao.aavegotchi.com thread. The vote is set to last for 7 days. Upon reaching quorum and a majority of support, we will see the contents of the vote upgraded to a binding Core Proposal AGIP11. If the vote fails to reach quorum or reach consensus, we will again table Haunt 2 until further notice. It would likely not come up again until some time in Q3 or even later depending on circumstances and the signals received by the wider community.\n\nTo conclude, we are aiming for wider adoption and so moving beyond the focus on scarcity of Aavegotchis. This is all carefully balanced with unique attributes retained for Haunt 1 Aavegotchis and the momentum building toward The Gotchiverse Realm and more.\n\nWe look forward to your vote in any direction! And remember, thanks to AavevotchiDAO, your voting power now is informed by your GHST balance, your Aavegotchis and your wearables. See you in the poll booth!",

This will serve to ensure each and every aavegotchi has a voice in each action the DAO takes going forward.\n\nI propose 3 options of valuing voting power per aavegotchi:\n\n300 GHST per gotchi (ape tax price)\n100 GHST per gotchi (base price)\nBRS weighted per gotchi (1 GHST voting power per point of BRS)\n\n*** If the community chooses any option in favor of assigning a fixed voting power in GHST to each Aavegotchi, then a core proposal can be created choosing between that single option and 'No Voting Power' ***",

      "content": "Author: doxy#2017\nGotchi ID: 3433\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/liquidity-expansion-options-honeyswap/1845\n\n** PROBLEM BEING ADDRESSED: **\nLiquidity for GHST pairs on Quickswap is dropping as QUICK rewards are spread across more pools.\n\n** SOLUTION: **\nThe 1hive DAO is expanding its Honeyswap exchange from xDAI to Polygon.  Honeyswap is live at: https://app.honeyswap.org/ \n\nAs part of this expansion, they will be incentivizing Polygon trading pairs with their pComb token, including the wETH-GHST pair.  See their wiki at: https://wiki.1hive.org/projects/honeyswap/honeyswap-on-polygon\nHoneyswap farms on xDAI currently yield 10% (USDC pair) to 460% (xComb pair).\n\nTo incentivize the growth of this liquidity pool, I propose that we award FRENS to stakers in the wETH-GHST pair at Honeyswap at a rate of approximately 1.2x the rate of staking GHST alone.  This rate is between the 1.1x for GHST-USDC and 1.33x for GHST-QUICK available from Quickswap staking.\n\nDiscussions between Pixelcraft and 1hive developers will be required to determine whether the mechanism for staking is similar to Quickswap (deposit liquidity, stake LP at Aavegotchi, then stake Aavegotchi receipts at exchange for rewards) \n\n** PROS: **\n- Incentives for staking GHST at Honeyswap will increase liquidity available for GHST traders.\n- wETH-GHST pair will have a 0.15% trading fee (instead of 0.30% for Quickswap pairs)\n- Traders interested in ETH long-term can hold ETH-based pair instead of USDC stablecoin or QUICK speculative token.\n- Visibility of Aavegotchi and FRENS rewards to the active 1hive DAO community with a compatible mindset\n\n** CONS: **\n- Additional FRENS emissions makes each FREN less valuable\n- Potential fragmentation of GHST liquidity with many incentivized GHST pairs\n- Additional effort by Pixelcraft to setup the rewards mechanism\n- Future value of pComb along with Honeyswap's potential for success on Polygon is unknown.  Currently, Honeyswap has $13M TVL on xDAI; Quickswap has $1.3B TVL.\n\nThis proposal was originally described on the DAO forum as an either/or proposition between Honeyswap and Dinoswap. However, discussion and the poll seemed to favor considering each partnership separately.\n\n** IN SUMMARY, this proposal has:\nMore liquidity for GHST and more visibility for Aavegotchi by incentivizing the wETH-GHST pool at Honeyswap with FRENS.",

      "content": "# Core Proposal -- AGIP #10: Co-fund partnership between AavegotchiDAO, Pixelcraft Studios, and DinoSwap\n\nAuthor: Jesse | gldnXross#6482\nGotchi ID: 4563\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/ghst-liquidity-rewards-on-new-launch-pixelcraft-dao-collaboration/1804\n\n## Problem being addressed:\nSome community members are worried about the waning liquidity of GHST on Quickswap and their gradually decreasing LP rewards.\n\nView the detailed proposal at the Discourse Thread linked above.\n\n## Solution:\nRather than simply allocating more liquidity to the pool, we are considering partnering with a soon to launch liquidity aggregator called DinoSwap. The terms include a total of 200k USD worth of GHST tokens to be allocated to their incentivized “extinction pools”, the details of which are fleshed out below.\n\n\n## Update:\nSince this proposal's original SigProp, we have seen DinoSwap publish their first blog post, activate their Twitter (@dinoswapHQ), launch their Telegram channels (https://t.me/DinoSwapOfficial and announcements channel https://t.me/DinoSwapAnn) and be copied by fake scammer knockoffs. \n\n**NOTE: No DinoSwap tokens have been minted yet!**\n\nWe are expecting their team to publish more news throughout this week and have a verbal agreement for an AMA to take place before the conclusion of this CoreProp. It is completely reasonable to withhold casting any vote on this proposal before that AMA takes place. Once we have a date and time confirmed, its details will be plastered all over our various socials. \n\n## Proposal:\nI am proposing that Pixelcraft Studios and AavegotchiDAO each contribute 100k USD worth of GHST to partner with DinoSwap during their launch window. For the $200,000 of GHST tokens provided, DinoSwap will be providing approximately $2,000,000 in DINO rewards over a 3 month period to stkGHST-WETH LPs on QuickSwap.\n\nThis particular arrangement offers an asymmetric risk/reward scenario: consider, if the DAO foregoes this and instead puts up 100K worth of GHST as just normal liquidity, then we've got 100K more liquidity in an already existing pair's pool. Not terrible, but not great either.\n\nThe opportunity here is that this 100K may lead to much more than 100K in liquidity for a newly bootstrapped GHST-WETH pair. Maybe 1M, maybe 10M, or maybe something much lower. It's hard to say, but the potential is there, and that's why this proposition is worth the DAO's consideration.\n\nAfter over a month of vetting by Pixelcraft, we believe the upside (big increase in liquidity, potentially valuable DINO rewards for LPs) significantly outweighs the downside (spending 100K GHST for the DAO, 100K for Pixelcraft).\n\nA quick check of https://aavegotchi.com/treasury shows that DAO treasury currently sits near 870k DAI and 515k GHST.\n\n**PROS:**\n\n* Potentially significant increases for GHST liquidity demand.\n* Wider exposure of GHST to the fast growing Polygon user base and users of DinoSwap.\n* Bootstrapping a new, third major liquidity pair in GHST-WETH.\n\n**CONS:**\n* DinoSwap is a new, untested (but audited by Certik) product that may not live up to the hype.\n* The $200K in GHST provided is going into an “extinction pool”, which means it will be consumed by yield farmers participating in liquidity mining on Quickswap, in exchange for the new DINO token (whose value is unknown).\n* The assorted risks of the unknown and opportunity cost.\n\nNote, Pixelcraft would also integrate FRENS rewards for the GHST-WETH liquidity providers, in order to maximize the LPs participation in the Aavegotchi ecosystem.\n\nThe exact percentage of FRENS rewards can be discussed, but given WETH’s volatility it would likely be greater than our USDC rewards but less than the QUICK pair.\n\n**In summary, this proposal has:**\n* Pixelcraft Studios contributing 100k USD worth of GHST (taken from our monthly 50K tap allocation) while\n* AavegotchiDAO treasury matches with another 100k USD worth of GHST.\n\nBEFORE voting, I highly suggest reading/joining the Discourse conversation above and joining our soon to be confirmed AMA if at all possible. It will take place in Discord. \n\nThe length of this CoreProp is set to 7 days (Concluding Sunday, June 20 at 2pm UTC).\n",

      "content": "[Summary]\nSacrificed Gotchis should be able to be revived by sacrificing multiple (exact amount to be determined) other Gotchis.\nSacrificed Gotchi IDs should redirect to a GrAAVEyard.\n\n[Introduction]\nWhen accessing the profile of a sacrificed Gotchi, it currently says \"This Aavegotchi hasn't been claimed yet!\". Here is an example:\nhttps://aavegotchi.com/gotchi/107\nI propose that, instead, these URLs redirect to a GrAAVEyard, with little tombstones that have the Gotchi IDs on them.\nWhen clicking on one of the tombstones, you should be able to revive that Gotchi ID by sacrificing multiple of your Gotchis (between two and four; exact number is yet to be determined).\n\n[Effect]\nThe revived Gotchi will have:\nTraits: Random (like a portal with just one Gotchi)\nKinship: 50 (or maybe even higher, since you sacrificed to revive them)\nXP: Sum of the sacrificed Gotchi's XP\nCollateral type: Random \nBadges: Resurrected badge.\nThe resurrected badge should be a tier badge. If all the Gotchis you sacrificed to revive a Gotchi had a resurrected badge, the revived Gotchi would get the next tier badge.\nExample names: Tier 1: Resurrected badge. Tier 2: Undying badge Tier 3: Immortal badge.\nExample scenarios:\nIn case two Gotchis need to be sacrificed to revive: You would need to sacrifice 8 Gotchis in total to get a Tier 3 badge.\nIn case three Gotchis need to be sacrificed to revive: You would need to sacrifice 27 Gotchis in total to get a Tier 3 badge.\n\n[Goal]\nThere are two user camps in the community: Those who want a lot more Gotchis, and those who are worried that more Gotchis would lead to Gotchi inflation and devalue their Gotchi assets.\nBoth camps have valid arguments. Yet, more Gotchis will be inevitable for two reasons.\nFirstly, Haunts are a great source of income, both for Pixelcraft and Rarity Farming. Keeping Pixelcraft well fed, ensures that they can expand, which, in turn, means that we get more features, faster.\nSecondly, many more Gotchis are needed to make Aavegotchis mainstream, which is one of the goals of the roadmap.\nBy offering the proposed game mechanic, people will sacrifice more and more Gotchis, thereby decreasing the Gotchi population. This will counteract the inflationary component of new Haunts.\n\n[Why]\nThere are several reasons why people would use this mechanic, and each time it is used, the amount of Gotchis in the GrAAVEyard increases:\n1. Anyone can resurrect ANY dead Gotchi. So there are already multiple incentives here: One might want the ID of a dead Gotchi, because that ID might be special to that user. Or a new users who bought several Haunt 2 Gotchis might want a Gotchi with a Haunt 1 ID but is not willing to pay 500+ GHST on the Bazaar for it.\n2. Badge hunters will want that elusive tier 3 resurrection badge.\n3. Gotchis with common traits can be sacrificed for a chance at a Gotchi with better stats. Since multiple Gotchis need to be sacrificed, the sampling bias introduced by this mechanic shouldn't be too bad.\n4. Once new collaterals are added, people can use this mechanic to get a Haunt 1 ID Gotchi with a collateral that didn't exist during Haunt 1. This would be a super rare Gotchi!\n\n[Potential risks or unintended consequences]\n1. Bots. Depending on how many Gotchis the next few Haunts will have and how much they will cost, bot users might constantly query for Haunt 1 Ids in the GrAAVEyard and immediately revive them with cheap Gotchis of later Haunts. So if there ever is an \"unlimited edition\" Gotchi that is very cheap, those should either not be eligible to revive older Haunt IDs, or it should require a lot more \"unlimited edition\" Gotchis to be sacrificed in order to revive a Gotchi ID from a limited edition Haunt.\n2. People might go really crazy over the resurrection badge and we might see a Gotchi massacre that will forever be remembered as \"the culling\". However, this wouldn't really be an issue, since it would only increase Gotchi value of older Haunts. And new Haunts could be spawned to make sure there is always a point of entry for newcomers.\n\n[Disclaimer]\nAuthor: CryptoGotchi\nGotchiID: 8612 (Yes, I only have one, so I couldn't even use this mechanic #sad )\n\n[Discourse]\nDAO discussion:\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/resurrection-as-a-tool-to-increase-gotchi-deflation/1695",

It's hard to say, but the potential is there, and that's why this proposition is worth the DAO's consideration. \n\nAfter over a month of vetting by Pixelcraft, we believe the upside (big increase in liquidity, potentially valuable DINO rewards for LPs) significantly outweighs the downside (spending 100K GHST for the DAO, 100K for Pixelcraft).\n\nA quick check of https://aavegotchi.com/treasury shows that DAO treasury currently sits near 870k DAI and 515k GHST.\n\n** PROS: **\n- Potentially significant increases for GHST liquidity demand.\n- Wider exposure of GHST to the fast growing Polygon user base and users of DinoSwap.\n- Bootstrapping a new, third major liquidity pair in GHST-WETH.\n\n** CONS: **\n- DinoSwap is a new, untested (but audited by Certik) product that may not live up to the hype.\n- The $200K in GHST provided is going into an “extinction pool”, which means it will be consumed by yield farmers participating in liquidity mining on Quickswap, in exchange for the new DINO token (whose value is unknown).\n- The assorted risks of the unknown and opportunity cost.\n\nNote, Pixelcraft would also integrate FRENS rewards for the GHST-WETH liquidity providers, in order to maximize the LPs participation in the Aavegotchi ecosystem.\n\nThe exact percentage of FRENS rewards can be discussed, but given WETH’s volatility it would likely be greater than our USDC rewards but less than the QUICK pair.\n\n\n## In summary, this proposal has: ##\n\nPixelcraft Studios contributing 100k USD worth of GHST (taken from our monthly 50K tap allocation) while AavegotchiDAO treasury matches with another 100k USD worth of GHST.\n\nBEFORE voting, I highly suggest reading/joining the Discourse conversation above. I acknowledge, there is nearly zero public info on DinoSwap yet. This is frustrating but also unavoidable because of the nature of the proposal (they are in stealth and we deciding whether to join their launch). \n\nI've set the length of this SigProp to 6 days, in the hopes that we can engage in rigorous debate and still have enough buffer for us to complete a potential CoreProp vote in time for DinoSwap's launch (soft circled for the last week of June).

      "title": "Signal Proposal: Petting Gotchis within 12hours time frame",
      "content": "Author: Pouis#8690\nGotchi: 6695\n\nDiscourse Thread: \nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/petting-gotchis-within-12hours-time-frame/1681\n\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/petting-gotchis-1-hour-grace-period/1557\n\nProposal Synopsis: change petting mechanism to « pet whenever you like within the 12 hours period ».\n\nProposal Details\n\nCurrent system: You pet your Gotchi. You will be able to pet your Gotchi again after exactly 12 hours.\n\nProblem: In theory, you should be able to pet twice a day everyday. In reality, it is not possible, since you won’t be able to pet exactly 12 hours later. Even with the best effort, you will lose few seconds, or minutes. If you try to pet everyday at 8:00 and 20:00, it will still slowly slide to 8:01 and 20:02, then 8:03 and 20:04… until a point where you will have to skip to pet again at 8:00. In the meantime, people using bots or script continue to pet twice a day, exactly with 12 hours interval. Because kinship is part of season reward and competition, this is not equitable.\n\nSolution: set two 12 hours period, in which you can pet at any moment and be eligible for kinship. For example, we set 2 periods: period 1 from 00:00 to 11:59 and period 2 from 12:00 to 23:59. (timezone can be anything). For the period 1, if we pet anytime during 00:00 to 11:59, then we receive 1 kinship. For period 2, if we pet anytime between 12:00 and 23:59, then we receive 1 kinship.\nThis method will:\n* provide more relaxed schedule for players, hence better quality of life.\n* allow human players to compete with petting bots or scripts\n* keep the current mechanism to pet twice in 24 hours.\n\nA similar topic exists: “Petting Gotchis: 1-hour grace period” and a snapshot proposal was made, without success. I believe this is because of a lack of communication. I truly believe this mechanism IS needed for a better Aavegotchi as a project.",

      "content": "Aauthor:  ~ 🐙Musashi13#5579 ~ gotchi#928\nDiscord Thread: https://discord.gg/QeUR3PBg\n\nSummary: We have all had some time to experience the burden of lost time due to our current model for petting our Aavegotchis once every 12 hours. Some of us lost sleep. Some lost kinship. Some set up bots :-o A similar proposal has been made to solve this issue and can be found here:\n https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/QmQoVWWmABvivkcyh1mGN2d3tcu3j4hpTrHi7uvVrToWDw\n\nI would like to thank Pouis#8690 for that proposal and also offer another possible solution with this goal: to make it easier to pet our Gotchis while also still allowing for an heir of competitiveness to be played out. \n\nPlaan Aa: Envoke \"Naaptime\" (11.5 HR pet/24 HR clock/1 HR Naaptime)\nPet Gotchis once every 11.5 hours per 24 hour time period with a 1 hour grace period per 24 hours we call \"Naaptime\". I personally think this mechanism could solve petting issues with lost time while also still allowing some competitiveness in the kinship aarena.\n\nPlaan B: Envoke \"Naaptime\" (12 HR pet/25 HR clock/1 HR Naaptime)\nPet Gotchis once every 12 hours per 25 hours with a 1 hour grace period per 25 hours we call \"Naaptime\". The timing mechanism here should be thought through as it could potentially pose similar issues. But it would allow for a small amount of wiggle room while also still allowing competitiveness by allowing you to get behind in your petting schedule.",

Many of us have done it while listening the the cool music the website provides a couple of times. But most of the time we all are there with the site muted. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a catchy tune, but after a little while it becomes monotonous. Hence Aavegotchi Raadio.\n\nThe idea is to invite different 8-bit music artists and the community to create and play their tunes on the Raadio, so people would love to press the play button and find something new, interesting and entertaining while surfing de Aavegotchi platform and future realm.\n\nI don’t know if the technology allows it but it would be aavesome to be able to include tunes in the baazaar, so people can buy them and add them to their Aavegotchi Plaaylist, just like any other wearable. Or just buy the tunes directly from the Raadio and add it to your Aavegotchi's Plaaylist! And just like any wearable you can add your music collection to your Items and sell them along with your Aavegotchi. New songs all the time!\n\nSomething simple. Press the play button and the Raadio starts. A bar slides showing the artist name, the title of the song and remaining time for the song to end; next to it the fixed price or bid space and actual bid price (bids last same time as the song), then the purchase/bid button and a like button for a Top 10 songs of the week chart.\n\nThere's a limited quantity of each tune and they are played on the radio until it runs out or until x amount of time has passed (for example 1 week). After that you can find them in the Baazaar! ",

So far none of those proposals were able to even get close to the quorum of 20%. The most popular one by @JG about adding additional fees for rarity farming only got around 2 million GHST in votes (~11%) - even though the team decided to take it as a Core Proposal. After being upgraded to Core we smashed right through the quorum in less than 24h.\n\nI think there are two pretty obvious reasons for this. On the one hand, our Snapshot is a bit chaotic right now, with some Signal Proposals not following the template at all. On the other hand - and I think this is the more important one - voting on Core Proposal gets you 20 Experience (XP) for your Gotchi.\n\n**I propose adding a small Experience drop (10 XP) for people who voted on successful Signal Proposals, meaning ones that reach quorum and get upgraded to Core Proposals. Simply dropping XP for all Community Proposals could result in more low quality suggestions, which shouldn't be the goal of this proposal.**\n\nEven if 10 XP might not be much, it gives people incentives to actually look through the Signal Proposals and vote on quality proposals with a higher chance of reaching quorum. As a DAO, community involvement is extremely important and I believe this is a small, but decent, step in the right direction.\n\n*If this Proposal reaches quorum and passes, all Aavegotchis held by their owners at the end of the vote will receive 10 XP! 🎉👻🎉*",

For example a licensed NFL jersey or a Kangol hat and then have that fee distributed straight to Gotchi holders in GHST tokens not to the reserve? I think big companies would pay for the opportunity and all Gotchi holders could benefit even the low ranking ones. Its more incentive to be a Gotchi owner. The sponsor could also pay for upgrades to make their wearables more desirable like an increase in a specific trait. This might mess with the game mechanics when it comes to rarity scores so that portion would have to be worked out but the sponsor could be charged accordingly and so it's still a win for the holders. The payouts could be done per Gotchi or wallet address. If its per Gotchi people may be inclined to open unused portals so they can get the funds from the sponsorship distribution.",

For example if each person can only have five gotchi and a wallet holds twenty, only the first five held by the address will eligible for any Gotchi benefits. This could be put into effect now or next haunt. Just putting some ideas out there to be discussed and voted on. ",

      "title": "Signal Proposal: Introduce a Traveling Caart to Encourage more Gameplay and Excitement",
      "content": "Gotchi: Tyler (1806)\n\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/proposal-open-a-traveling-cart-selling-wearables/955\n\nFrens, do you often open the maall, only to disappointedly find its shelves barren? Would you like to add a little more excitement and gameplay to the aavegotchi realm?\n\nI would like to propose the opening of the Aavegotchi Traveling Caart! \n\n*Summary:*\n\nIntroduce a Traveling Caart that would sell a proportion of each season’s wearables (more details in the options). \nThe caart would appear twice per week.\nEx: Every Tuesday and Saturday at 12:00 and 0:00 UTC respectively. \n\nThe exact moment of the caart’s arrival would be random within a thirty-minute window, and there would be an announcement made in Discord saying the cart is arriving into the station in the next 5 minutes.\n\n*Benefits:*\n\n• Add more gameplay and excitement to Aavegotchi! The caart would add a consistent reason to check back and play.\n\n• Builds community within Discord. More eyes in Discord would drive more connection. Also, people can brag about what sweet items they scored!\n\n• More incentive to hold GHST. By spreading out when GHST is spent, there will be less price spiking/dumping around seasonal launches.\n\n• A caart could allow for more dynamic item introduction. If the caart is always stocked with different wearables, a new, smaller set could be folded into it seamlessly (the maall stocking just one or two items would feel a bit random, yea?). It also opens the possibility for more surprise items to be folded into the ecosystem. What if there was a mystery item yet-to-be launched and you found out it was coming in the Discord announcement 5 minutes before it lands?!\n\n• Benefits the small guy who loves the game. A passionate player who checks the cart often might be able to snap up a legendary and sell it in the bazaar for a nice premium.\n\n• Gives new arrivals something to participate in between haunts.\n\n• It would create a more dynamic bazaar as even some of the rarest items could first arrive with a limited stock. Players who really want the items NOW would pay the premium. \n\n• Godlikes and mythicals would be even more elusive as the final drops might not appear for a few weeks, even a month.\n\n• It could add a level of excitement for the top-tier players. What if that one yet-to-be-spawned godlike is the key to them claiming the prize for rarity farming?\n\n*The end goal:*\n\nThe end goal is to have more playability, better price stability for GHST, as well as introduce dynamic supply for the items. Imagine a physical representation of the caart rolling up into town square twice per week, blowing its horn, and all the little gotchis scurrying to the counter to make a purchase? \n\n*Potential Risks:*\n\nI don’t really see many risks, so I’m going out on a limb here…\n\n• One potential risk is if the game isn’t very popular, then the demand for wearables would be low enough that the cart would always be stocked and prices in the bazaar would flat line. Though I suppose if the game isn’t very popular, then flooding the market with 10k+ new items wouldn’t help prices either!\n\n• The RNG of drops could confuse or frustrate people. \n\n• The big whales who hoard everything and resell on bazaar might not support the idea, get upset, and leave?\n\n*Two Options:*\n\nI propose two different options. The first is an integrated approach which preserves the maall while introducing the caart. The second is a more radical approach which replaces the maall entirely. \n\nPlease note: at no point am I proposing to change the final item count of any items.\n\n*Option One: Keep the Maall and launch the caart as a bonus*\n\nWith this option, new wearables would launch in the maall as before, but at a 50% rate.\n\nCommon: 1000 -> 500\nUncommon: 500 -> 250\nRare: 250 -> 125\nLegendary: 100 -> 50\nMythical: 50 -> 25\nGodlike: 5 -> 3\n\nThe cart would then spawn the remaining items over an eight-week period (for a total of sixteen appearances). The length of time could also be synced to the length of each season so that way there’s always something in stock. The drop rate would be subject to RNG but would, on average, be per cart appearance:\n\nCommon: 31.25\nUncommon: 15.6\nRare: 7.8\nLegendary: 3.12\nMythical: 1.56\nGodlike: 0.125\n\nAt the end of the eight weeks, the full stock will have been sold.\n\n*Option Two: Demolish the Maall and use only the caart*\n\nThis option is a bit more radical but could be even more exciting. Rather than mint half the wearables up front, everything would instead appear in the caart entirely. The first caart appearances would have a heavier weight and there would be diminishing returns in the drops until the stock is finally exhausted. \n\nWhere it gets interesting is with items of higher rarity. Towards the end, a mythical or godlike could go several rounds with zero drops and then BAM!\n\nNote: roughly 50% of the items would still appear within the first two weeks.\n\nThe drops would still be subject to RNG but would look something more like this:\n\nCommon: \n190 -> 140 -> 100 -> 65 -> 40 -> 35 -> …\nUncommon:\n95 -> 70 -> 50 -> 30 -> 25 -> …\nRare: \n50 -> 40 -> 30 -> 18 -> 15 -> …\nLegendary:\n30 -> 21 -> 17 -> 13 -> 5 -> …\nMythical:\n16 -> 9 -> 5 -> 3 -> 0 -> 1 -> ...\nGodlike:\n3 -> 1 -> 0 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> …\n\nThis could be set to a finite end point or could be left open with diminishing returns. An open schedule would allow for a few straggling items (could cut this to rare and lower) to pop up many weeks or months later.\n\n*Option Three: Keep things the way they are*\n\nThis option means empty maall shelves 99.9% of the time with players smashing through the maall doors in Black Friday fashion.\n\n----\n\nIf you like the general idea but disagree with one micro-aspect of it, I encourage you to vote in favor as I am sure the devs will be making adjustments anyhow.\n\nI would like to suggest to the devs that if there is huge support for either option one or two, but the margin requirement isn’t met, that the proposal of reworking the maall be considered largely supported by the community.\n",

      "title": "ARP: Community Airdrops",
      "content": "Author: noahns#1723\nGotchi ID: Degenerate (9111)\nDiscourse Discussion Thread (much more detail and analysis on here!): https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/community-airdrops/1535\n\nThe Aavegotchi Revitalization Plan (ARP) is a series of proposals designed to increase user engagement and retention, and to increase the inherent value of Aavegotchis by rewarding users who own gotchis.\n\nSummary of Proposal: This proposal suggests that future distributions (XP distributions, wearable sales/raffles, and season-end GHST distribution) set aside a small amount of the distribution and randomly airdrop the item to a small number of aavegotchi-holding wallets (i.e., a wallet that is holding an aavegotchi).\n\nProblem : Going into Season 1, we’re losing interest from what I’ll call “low commitment” players who are unable to commit a sufficient amount of capital input to acquire expensive wearables or buy tons of raffle tickets at a chance of getting a wearable. These players were further dispirited by the recent Maal sale. Simply put, with no minigames out yet, folks who bought lower BRS gotchis are feeling like there’s not a place for them in the current meta, and this is being reflected in the decreasing gotchi prices. To many, the game is increasingly overwhelmingly “pay to play.”\n\nProposed Solution: For future distributions, a small amount of each distribution will be set aside and airdropped to a random gotchi-holding wallet that otherwise would not have received the distribution:\n\n*For every XP drop, whatever the amount of XP that’s being distributed will also be distributed to three unique Aavegotchi-holding wallets that otherwise would not have received the XP. This is obviously free to the DAO\n*For every wearable-distribution, the following number of items are set aside and randomly airdropped: 2 mythics, 5 legendaries, 10 rare, 10 uncommon, 10 common. This is also free to the DAO\n*For the season-end GHST distribution, roughly 0.5% of the total GHST is set aside and airdropped to three Aavegotchi-holding wallets who finished outside the top 100 for that season. For this season, that would be a little less than 5,000 GHST being distributed, resulting in <2 GHST being taken away from each Aavegotchi who would be otherwise receiving GHST.\n\nThis means that an Aavegotchi essentially becomes a re-usable raffle ticket. Just by holding an Aavegotchi, users get a chance at receiving airdrops. Wallets will be weighted based on the number of Aavegotchis someone holds.\n***\nThis should be very easy to implement with a simple contract that notes the owner wallets of all gotchis, and using Chainlink VRF randomly distributes the airdrop.\n\nOverall, I think this is a very easy to implement solution that would dramatically increase user participation and retention, and increase the inherent value of all Aavegotchis.",

      "title": "ARP: Three-tier Wearable Distribution",
      "content": "Author: noahns#1723\nGotchi ID: Degenerate (9111)\nDiscourse Discussion Thread (much more detail and analysis on here!): https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/arp-part-ii-three-part-wearable-distribution-plan/1555\n\nThe Aavegotchi Revitalization Plan (ARP) is a series of proposals designed to increase user engagement and retention, and to increase the inherent value of Aavegotchis by rewarding users who own gotchis.\n\nSummary of Proposal: Future wearable drops will be distributed in three waves.  One-third will be distributed through a traditional raffle (tickets purchased with FRENS).  The remaining two-thirds will be distributed through a \"riskless raffle\" where users stake GHST to claim an item, but don't lose their GHST if they don't win an item.  Users who own gotchis will be prioritized for half of these items.\n\nProblem : Going into Season 1, we’re losing interest from what I’ll call “low buy-in” or more casual players who are unable to commit a sufficient amount of capital input to acquire expensive wearables or buy tons of raffle tickets for a chance of getting a wearable. These players were further dispirited by the recent Maal sale. Simply put, with no minigames out yet, folks who bought lower BRS gotchis are feeling like there’s not a place for them in the current meta, and this is being reflected in the decreasing gotchi prices. To many, the game is increasingly overwhelmingly “pay to play.” So far, the DAO has tried a few different wearable release methods, each with pros and cons.\n\nProposed Solution: This proposal suggests that future wearable drops are distributed in three waves (which could all take place at once). I propose the following three-wave system:\n\nRaffles : One third of all new wearables are raffled off through the normal existing method. People continue staking GHST for FRENS, and buying/selling raffle tickets. This gives anyone a shot at getting a Godlike if they want, without spending 10k GHST, and isn’t susceptible to bots. Of course, we still have the issue of people losing money if they don’t get selected and feeling rekt, which leads us to the second and third waves…\n\n“Riskless” Raffle (aka GHST staking) (two waves) : The remaining two thirds of new wearables are distributed through a “riskless raffle”.  Users stake GHST directly towards the item they want to acquire.  If they are selected, they get the item; if not, the contract returns their GHST and no one gets rekt. \n\nThe riskless raffle proceeds in two waves: First , half of the wearables that are allocated for the riskless raffle (or one third of the total wearables) are randomly distributed to wallets that own gotchis. Wallets are weighted based on the number of aavegotchis they own, as determined by a snapshot shortly in advance of the raffle.  In this wave, wallets are limited to being awarded one item per gotchi they own.  This gives every Aavegotchi-holding wallet a decent chance of getting an item, since there are a finite amount of Aavegotchis.\n\nSecond , the remaining one-third of wearables will be randomly distributed among all users who have staked GHST towards the item contracts. Again, the contract will use VRF to randomly select a wallet that staked GHST towards that item. Obviously, those who stake more GHST will have a better chance of being awarded items here. Users will be charged a 1% fee on all GHST they stake. This will be negligible for people trying to get a rare or legendary item (just a few GHST), but will disincentivize people from staking vast amounts of GHST.\n***\nOverall, this proposal should be easy to implement using pre-existing contracts from the Maal and raffle.  This proposal will ensure that wearables are distributed equitably, and that owners of Aavegotchis are rewarded for holding a Gotchi",

While not exclusive of providing for RF rewards, the treasury funds are currently in no obligation to be allocated in any form of ratio towards the RF pool each season.\n\nProposal:\n*To tweak the numbers to 2% Pixelcraft, 1% DAO Treasury, and 0.5% RF rewards pool. \n***     3.5% total fee from current standing 3% fee ***\n\nArguments:\n*Although nobody likes an increase in fees, the resulting increase from 3 to 3.5% would not be too disruptive on a per transaction basis, while for reference it would have increased SZN 1 rewards by a very healthy 46,000 GHST approx. (As per figures shared by Coderdan). Competitors already charge higher fees as in 5% at NBA Top-Shot and 4.25% at Axie marketplace.\n\nBenefits:\n*A major benefit is expanding the value proposition of gotchies and wearables, as proxies of participation into the wefficient trading mechanism that is the Aavegotchi Bazaar on Polygon network.\n*A virtuous cycle of economic growth and value is fostered in the ecosystem.",

Why don’t we create a companion to Aavegotchis for the kid who only knows how to play on his Switch or for the Generation X/Baby Boomers who may have more trouble than average trying to engage this ecosystem.\n\nLil Aavegotchis could be what brings Aavegotchis to the mainstream.\n\nCreate a mini/toy companion set of NFTs called Lil Aaveotchis that have already been summoned through a portal and come with a very small amount (chosen by the user) of maGHST or another maToken that they can stake and hold as long as they want.\n\nMaybe the treasury can contribute 0.1 GHST for hundreds of thousands of Lil Gotchis to be handed out on social media? Lil Gotchis could provide liquidity to GHST or any compatible token and even to the Aavegotchi ecosystem. Lil Gotchis can be very trendy and if airdropped to wallets who have held GHST or MATIC or engaged the MATIC ecosystem in some way they can explode in popularity and bring more people to Aavegotchi.\n\nThink of the memes.\n\nThere can be a separate marketplace and item set for the Lil Gotchis. Holding them can contribute to the rarity and experience of your Aavegotchi. The possibilities are endless.",

      "content": "Author: dark_pet (forum) / Pressure#2880 (Discord)\nGotchi ID: 7972 (Dark)\n\nLink: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/peer-to-peer-trading-widget/1067\n\nProposal Description:\n\nThere are several possible ways to interact with other users within the Aavegotchi community, and one such way includes the purchasing or selling of Aavegotchis, portals, and other items on the Baazaar. In this transactional exchange, User A may list their asset in the Baazaar for a particular price in GHST that can then be purchased by User B. This transaction takes place without a formal discussion between Users A and B; one user posts, the other person purchases, and the transaction executes.\n\nThroughout my time in the Discord, I have noticed numerous users attempting to try to negotiate “trades” with other users. The prime conundrum users attempting to trade are currently facing is that there is no safe and trustless way to transfer in-app assets. Other than manually transferring assets from user-to-user, the only available option for these users includes the transferring of in-app assets to a vetted third-party/intermediary within the community (such as a developer or community leader) who then collects the assets/funds from both parties and allocates them accordingly. However, this introduces both inconvenience (to all three parties) and the risk of human error (i.e., mistyping an address, or sending the incorrect asset).\n\nMy proposal is to create an in-app “Trade” widget, wherein users who have made an agreement off-app, for example on Discord or other discussion/social media platforms, can propose trades to other users. If accepted, the trade will process and the assets/funds will be transferred from each user to the other user in the agreement.\n\nWith this widget, there are innumerable possibilities. For instance, users can trade Aavegotchis, items, and even GHST, FRENS, or raffle tickets with one another. Gotchi for GHST, Gotchi for raffle tickets, portals for Aavegotchis, FRENS for items, etc.\n\nAnother possibility could be to “propose” trades, wherein users will have the option to open any individual’s Gotchi or Portal page and propose a trade. A great example of this is in Fantasy sports, where users are able to accept or reject trades made by other users.\n\nAnother possibility could be to have the “Trade” option listed for every asset listed on the Baazaar, so if a user does not want to spend the listed amount in GHST for a particular listed asset, they can propose a trade. For example, if an Aavegotchi is listed for 10,000 GHST, a user can propose a Trade countering the 10,000 GHST listed price and instead offering up a rare Haunt 1 portal.\n\nUltimately this will provide users with a standardized, trustless mechanism for trades that allows for more flexibility with what they can do with their in-app assets, while mitigating the risks associated with transferring assets to other random users.",

The timer doesn't go backwards neither forwards, it gives you a 1 hour window to pet your gotchi, the timer will be stable.\nThis is a plain fix that keeps the timer from creeping by a few minutes each time till it ruins your schedule.\nPeople will no longer have to use bots and stop having to ruin their sleep schedules.\nThis should be implemented right after the first round of BRS farming ends, at most before the end of this month.\nI do not see any risks whatsoever associated with this specific proposal.\n\nPlan B is to make things easy by allowing players to pet their gotchis 2 times in a day and a night whenever they choose in said day/afternoon and night/morning, just that they have to stay within the allocated time periods; 12:00-23:59 and 0:00-11:59 UTC\nYou can pet your gotchi before 23:59 and after 0:00 if you want both pets to count, just make sure you don't forget.

      "content": "I propose a modest change to attract and retain more users with a limited bankroll by adding BRS when an Aavegotchi possesses a certain number of \"mythical\" traits.\n\nIf an Aavegotchi has 3 traits in the mythical class (e.g. 0-2, 98-100) then they get +25 BRS. If they have 4 traits in the mythical class, they get +50 BRS. This rewards users who already possess rare Aavegotchis, while incentivizing users to buy basic items to reach that threshold. At the same time, this many mythical traits is rare enough to not dilute the value of mythical and godlike Aavegotchis.\n\nI believe this change will give users with less funds a second chance to own a rare Aavegotchi, increase the demand for common, uncommon, and rare items in the Bazaar, and make the game less about buying items that are as expensive as possible and more about deliberate selection of an Aavegotchi with high potential.",

      "content": "\nThe way the distribution is designed is absolute concentration.  It's  almost impossible to a newbie player reach the top positions of the leaderboard. The first place winner is receiving the vast majority of the prizes and he will stay there practically for ever cause he can reinvest the prizes for getting the best wearables and buying more portals.  How a new player will rise in the ranking to the point of overcoming first place? Impossible! The first place will remain there forever, simply. The difference of prizes between the ranking should be minimal. With minimal prize difference between the leaderboard all NFT gotchi will have a nicer market value, and players could play with more than one gotchis if they want bigger prizes. Right now if you have a low grade aavegotchi you will never sell it, nobody will buy it , and you will never get good prize by rarity.\n\nHow is rarity farming currently being distributed:\nRank 1 - 135828,31 GHST (that`s 15% of all GHST distributed in the pool!! This player will stay here in top 1 for ever !!!)\nRank 2 - 67914.15\nRank 3 - 43942,77\nRank 4 - 31957.08\nRank 5 - 24965.66\nRank 6 - 20071,38\nRank 7 - 17218.33\nRank 8 - 15078.54\nRank 9 - 13414.26\nRank 10 - 12082.83\n...\nRank 500 - 119,83 (almost nothing)\n\nsource:  rarity farming distribution:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13F9VoLHqSX7SgNHaBSa4K-TgoxFBYz2pKLzkEAvdPI0/edit#gid=291463579\n\nSuggestion of a better way to distribute the prizes, avoiding the absolute power of the first places and allowing new players to rise in the ranking. We  also create better market value for all gotchis NFT's:\n\nExample: 1 millon GHST pool for 500 players.\nSuggestion: Sum of weights method: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ... + 500 = 125250 shares\nThis way the prize decreases by 8 GHST each position lower\nRank 1 : 3992 GHST (500 shares)\nRank 2 : 3984 GHST (499 shares)\nRank 3 : 3976 GHST (498 shares)\n...\nRank 100 : 3129 GHST (400 shares)\n...\nRank 200 : 2320  GHST (300 shares)\n...\nRank 300: 1520 GHST (200 shares)\n...\nRank 400: 800 GHST (100 shares)\nRank 500: 1  GHST ( 1 share)\n...\n\nThis way ALL NFT aavegotchi will have nice market value!! If you are a whale you can play with two or more gotchis for double gains! The way is designed right now most of the gotchis has no value in the market and will never reach the top spots. ",

Regardless of the timing of future hunts, we need to change this to a win-win dynamic. There are several ways that one can solve this dynamic. Here are few simple examples:\n\n1. What if statistically, the chance of getting a rare Gotchi reduced from Hunt to hunt? Simple to implement. Easy to understand. This means that the chance of high quality Gotchis entering the pool reduces over time. \n\n2. What if the number of new portal generated for each hunt be a function unclaimed Gotchis? That is number of new portals for \n# new portal for Hunt N = 10000 - # unclaimed Gochis",

      "content": "# Core Proposal: AGIP6 - Add 0.5% Fee on Baazaar to Support Rarity Farming\n**Author**: JG#7031\n**Gotchi ID**: Red Pill https://aavegotchi.com/gotchi/1345\n**XP Reward**: 20 XP for each Aavegotchi in voter's wallet\n**Discourse Thread**: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/signal-proposal-additional-bazaar-fees-towards-rarity-farming/1387\n**Original Signal Proposal**: https://snapshot.org/#/aavegotchi.eth/proposal/QmU4WLexfVT8sXz4XzHqDgXPFhFvK7wRSpBPjxUtktzdZe\n\nAll information below is taken from the original Signal Proposal, with slight modifications for clarity.\n\n## Proposal Information ##\n\n### Background:\nWith the announcement of SZN1 Rewards now official, we explore how to align the community's interests and rewards structures, as it pertains to Baazaar fees.\n\nCurrently, 2% is allocated to Pixelcraft and 1% to DAO treasury. While not exclusive of providing for RF rewards, the treasury funds are currently in no obligation to be allocated in any form of ratio towards the RF pool each season.\n\n### Proposal:\nIncrease the Baazaar fees from 3% to 3.5%, with the additional 0.5% going directly to the Rarity Farming rewards pool.\n\n### Arguments\nAlthough nobody likes an increase in fees, the resulting increase from 3 to 3.5% would not be too disruptive on a per transaction basis, while for reference it would have increased SZN 1 rewards by a very healthy 55,000 GHST approx. (As per figures shared by Coderdan). Competitors already charge higher fees as in 5% at NBA Top-Shot and 4.25% at Axie marketplace.\n\n### Benefits:\nA major benefit is expanding the value proposition of Gotchies and Wearables, as proxies of participation into the efficient trading mechanism that is the Aavegotchi Bazaar on Polygon network.\nA virtuous cycle of economic growth and value is fostered in the ecosystem, where trading brings a larger pool of rewards, which increases the velocity of trading within the Baazaar.\n\n### Options:\n* Yes, increase the fees from 3% to 3.5% to support Rarity Farming Player Rewards\n* No, leave the fees as they are.\n\n**Required Quorum**: 3.4M GHST (20% of all eligible GHST on Polygon)\n**Required Vote Differential**: 10% (only two options)\n**Vote duration**: 7 days\n\nIf this vote is passed with sufficient quorum, a contract upgrade will be deployed to increase the fee and begin directing said fee to the Rarity Farming Rewards Pool address, located at xxx.\n\n*Note: Only fees accrued AFTER the enacting of this vote will be redirected to Rarity Farming rewards. SZN1 of Rarity Farming rewards are already capped at 1.4M GHST. All future rewards will be earmarked for future Seasons!*\n\n## Vote now! 👇",

      "content": "**[What]**\nThis month, Season 1 of Rarity Farming will commence. Undoubtable, there will be a lot of ties in all three categories. The aim of this proposal is to change the tie breaker sorting criterion for the Kinship category to \"time until next interaction\" (with lower times ranking higher, of course).\n\n**[Why]**\nThe Kinship ranking has a lot of ties, because people have been petting their Gotchis diligently. However, everyone's 12h petting cycle is a little different. The exact time of the reward snapshots could easily lower your rank 10 to 50 places, if it ends up being a few minutes before your next interaction would raise your Kinship score. This would lead to drama and upset frens, similar to what we've seen after Haunt 1.\n\n**[Arguments PRO]**\nPro 1: The current tie breaker (Experience) has by far the most ties and is therefore not suited to be a tie breaker. There would still be a lot of ties left unbroken.\n\nPro 2: 'Time until next interaction' is (unlike any other criterion) directly tied to the Kinship score and therefore a much more fair tie breaker for the Kinship category.\n\nPro 3: Based on the time resolution (seconds or even milliseconds) 'time until next interaction' leaves virtually no ties left unbroken.\n\nPro 4: The current tie breaker (Experience) has its own reward category. \"Cross contamination\" between reward pools would make each pool less unique. Reward categories are there to reward *different* aspects.\n\n**[Arguments CON]**\nCon 1: It was already announced that Experience is going to be the tie breaker.\n\nCon 2: Kinship is the tie breaker in the BRS category. Therefore it is only fair, if one of the other categories is the tie breaker in the Kinship category.\n\n**[Counter arguments for CON]**\nCounter for Con 1: Tie-breakers should have been determined by a core proposal all along. Hence, changing the tie-breaker, even after the announcement, would make for good press (e.g. Active DAO decides to make reward pool of ~ 300,000 USD more fair for active users).\n\nCounter for Con 2: This proposal is ONLY for the Kinship category. Other categories are a different topic. But if we must discuss this here: Two wrongs don't make a right. BRS could easily tie-broken in more suitable ways. E.g. relative rarity - i.e. rank items uniquely by how many Gotchis are wearing them, and rank high/low traits by how many Gotchis have those traits high or low. Those are just two of many things that would be a better fit for the BRS category. \n\n**[Alternatives]**\n1: Spread the snapshot timestamps for the 4 reward rounds 3h apart. E.g. round 1 at 1pm, round 2 (two weeks later) at 4pm, round 3 (two weeks later) at 7pm, and round 4 (two weeks later) at 10pm. This would mitigate the 12h issue to a much less effective degree, but it would still be better than nothing.\n\n2: In addition, 'Time until next interaction' could be used as a second tie-breaker, for all the ties that are still unbroken after the Experience tie-breaker has been applied.\n\n**[Disclaimer]**\nAuthor: CryptoGotchi\nGotchiID: 8612\n\n**[Discourse]**\nThe proposal has had overwhelming support in the DAO discussion.

      "title": "Adding new aTokens as Spirit Force",
      "content": "Author: Moon#5262\nGotchi: 3541 (Moon)\nDiscourse Thread: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/adding-new-collaterals-awbtc-axsushi-as-spirit-force/1191\n\nThis is a proposal to add two new aTokens, specifically aWBTC and axSUSHI, as Spirit Force to Aavegotchi. The advantages of adding new collaterals should be pretty clear:\n\n- We get to include more communities, especially of DeFi projects that share the same values as us.\n- Players can summon an Aavegotchi while still being exposed to the price of their favorite token.\n- A higher diversity of Aavegotchis. This could also give haunts distinct value since the odds of getting a specific collateral change.\n\nI chose aWBTC and axSUSHI for the following reasons:\n\n- aWBTC: Bitcoin is the mother of all crypto assets. As the largest cryptocurrency and the 4th largest Aave pool by market size, this is a no brainer in my opinion. It's the most conservative crypto investment and the first choice for anyone dipping their toes into the space.\n- axSUSHI: They are one of the most recent additions to the Aave liquidity pools and have already grown to be one of the largest. What started as a simple Uniswap fork has now become one of the leading innovators. Since axSUSHI is the aToken of staked SUSHI (xSUSHI), players will earn staking rewards (currently ~4.83% APY) on top of the Aave yield.\n\nThe largest downside is the low yield on both of these assets, which is a common trend for speculative tokens. aWBTC is at around 0.16% APY right now, with axSUSHI generating ~0.01% yield on Aave. axSUSHI makes up for this with the staking rewards (~4.83%), which puts it at rank 2 in terms of yields of non-stable assets (just after aSNX with ~5.51%).\n\nAnother drawback is that this proposal could take some time for the devs to implement (adding them to Gotchis and bridging the aTokens to Matic) - time that might be spent building minigames and the realm.\n\nSince the implementation would depend on different factors (amount of dev work, launch of new haunts, etc.) I can't give an exact timeline for this proposal. Would be great to have it included in haunt 2, but this is ultimately up to the team.\n\nIf you're unhappy with my choice of aTokens, keep in mind that we can always create proposals for new collaterals in the future.\n\nIf you support this proposal, vote for Option 1 (\"Yes, add aWBTC and axSUSHI\")\nIf you do not support this proposal, vote for Option 2 (\"No, don't add new collaterals\")",

      "title": "Proposal: Gotchi breeding",
      "content": "**Introduction**\n\nAfter the opening of the *portals*, there are a lot of lonely and abandoned Ghotchi with a *rarity score* below 500. They are sold on the market for a penny and no one wants to be frens with them. To give them utilitarian properties, I propose to introduce a new *mechanic* **\"Breeding ghosts\"**.\n\n**Breeding mechanics description**\n\nYou can take two gotchi, combine them and get a new one with random traits in return (the old two gotchi will be sacrificed).\nAlso, traits may not be completely random, but generated based on the traits of the parents. In this way, it will be possible to even create ghosts with the desired traits (but always with random eyes).\nAt the same time, it turns out that not all ghosts are good for each other, for example, a ghost with a **high** energy trait does not fit well with a ghost with a **low** energy trait, since as a result this trait will be averaged.\nWe can also add new \"Generation\" property, which means how many generations of ancestors this ghost had. For this procedure, you can take a commission in $GHST and send it to treasure. The commission can increase with each generation.\n\nThus, we will reduce the number of ordinary ghosts and give them more value, and also there will be another completely new profession for Aavegotchi ecosystem.\n\n**Summary**\n**- Make gotchi with common traits more valuable and add to them new utility function**\n**- Replenishment of the treasury through commissions**\n**- New profession for Aavegotchi masters**\n\n*P.S. This is a general description of the new mechanics, and of course it can be simplified or made more complex.*",

This proposal suggests that we add a randomly distributed prize to one or more lucky gotchis/wallets at the end of the season. For example, at the end of season 1, one random gotchi will receive 15k GHST just for playing. This could be a high BRS gotchi, a low BRS, or somewhere in the middle. This will encourage people to hold their gotchis (which would essentially become non-burnable raffle tickets), increase the floor price for gotchis, and encourage people to open portals. This would be accomplished at a relatively low cost to the project. \n",

      "content": "With respect to the aspirations of the DAO Cocoon phase for consensus, community growth, high voter turnout and enjoyment, I think it would be beneficial to consider implementing two different voting mechanisms.  One would be based strictly on GHST holdings while the other would be based on a one Gotchi-one vote principle.\n\nBecause of the tokenomics of Aavegotchi and the need for risk investment and liquidity, those community members with a lot of skin in the game should have a weighted influence on certain classes of decisions, e.g., those with dilutive or inflationary impact on the Gotchi market.  But there are other classes of community decisions where voting based on Gotchis holdings rather than GHST assets should prevail, for example, decisions involving gameplay rules, haunt procedures, rarity mechanics, etc.\n\nHaving two such voting mechanisms for DAO governance would balance the influence of investors with those of crypto-neophytes, DeFi advocates and gamers. This should help avoid Aavegotchi becoming a niche game solely for high-asset collectibles speculators while promoting an ecosystem that incentivizes game play and community engagement.\n\nOf course, the devil is in the details.  But this DAO Cocoon phase is the perfect time to start evolving such a voting model and identifying which aspects of DAO governance voting should be GHST weighted and which should be Gotchi weighted.",

Not an extra one, just the normal hunt incomming someday.\n\nYou can reserve only 1 Portal in advance and save it for the haunt day. On the hunt day itself, you have the chance to buy this one for sure, and haunt for the others just as we did this time.\n\nYou have 24 hours to claim and buy your reserved Portal. Otherwise there will be the afterhaunt. On the day After, all reserved Portals, who did not get bought, will be sold. It will be done just as a normal hunt. First come, first serve.\nThis way, everybody could get at least one Portal but the first come, first serve base and the excitement, if we got more than one Portal will stay. \n\nI think it's a great idea to allow everybody to buy at least one Portal at haunt day. If you wanna buy more than one, you can do that in the normal, first come, first serve, haunt.",

By being distinctively different from Haunt 1, this will drastically increase the chances that whales from Haunt 1 will support because this proposal would most likely not affect the prices of current gotchis and wearables. Hopefully this can help cater towards both target markets of NFT collectors/investors(mainly those that are from Haunt 1 or buyers in Bazaar) and gamers/tamagotchi fans to mutually benefit from this entire ecosystem.",

Every anniversary of the launch, Aavegotchi's annual games are held where only Haunt-1 Gotchis can participate \n\n2. Other Haunt Gotchis can participate, but would need a Haunt-1 Fren to partner up with\n\n3. Maybe a very low tax can be imposed to 'partner up' e.g. 0.1 GHST\n\n4. Haunt-1 Gotchis who 'bring the most Frens' could win prizes as well\n\nAnyway, these are just some ideas of what an exclusive Haunt-1 Gotchi event could look like. I am sure, further down the line, the idea could be refined but the gist is there.\n\n\n",

People who bought from baazaar at multiples of the launch price will suffer from huge loses too if this were to happen. Therefore I suggest to add something unique like a shiny background for Haunt 1 in order to maintain the “limited” component of the initial launch. This will make everyone happy because Haunt 1 buyers will not suffer loses or devaluation of their purchase while more people get to enjoy the game and mass adoption can come true in the future.",

It is not necessary to collect feedback from community members to understand that most of the early adopters were left without a portal and without a fren. This topic has already been discussed here: https://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/proposal-for-a-new-haunt-immediately/330\n\nThe second Haunt will be declined by current GHST holders who bought portals. This would be rational behaviour because additional 10000 portals will devalue their portals and aavegotchis. At the same time, rejecting a friend's needs will cause negative feedback from the community and will lower the loyalty of the community. So, the motivation is to let people be engaged in the game and do not devalue the holdings of current holders.\n",

      "content": "Our liquidity migration program has been a huge success, with over 8M GHST migrated to Matic already. However, as many community members have noted, liquidity for the GHST-USDC pair is still not deep enough to support trading large amounts of USDC for GHST on Quickswap. \n\nWe believe one way to remedy this is by adding GHST-USDC as a pair eligible for FRENS on https://aavegotchi.com/stake-matic. Just like GHST-QUICK has a receipt token stkGHST-QUICK, staked GHST-USDC can also emit a stkGHST-USDC token, which may be eligible for rewards on Quickswap, if their team deems it necessary. \n\nSince this decision directly affects gameplay, we believe it is a ripe candidate for our first Snapshot vote on Matic. \n\nWe are setting a 500,000 GHST quorum for this vote to be enacted. \n\nThe GHST-USDC LP token will earn FRENS at the same rate as just staking GHST, since impermanent loss is minimal and fees are significant. \n",

      "content": "Player rewards and liquidity incentives are crucial to bootstrapping the Aavegotchi ecosystem to a level where it becomes self-sustained on trading volume and economic activity. \n\nWhenever GHST is spent in the Aavegotchi ecosystem, 33% of it is automatically sent to a burn address. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, burning GHST (except via the bonding curve) does not actually lower the total value of GHST, since that value is stored as DAI within the bonding curve. \n\nWhat burning *does* do is trap DAI within the bonding curve, essentially increasing the reserve ratio over time, which stabilizes the price of GHST. \n\nIn order to offset the burning (which could ultimately turn GHST into a stablecoin), **we advise the community to increase the tap to 150,000 DAI per month**. This will help balance the reserve of the bonding curve, while also providing an extra 50,000 DAI per month that can be put towards player rewards and liquidity incentives.\n\nOur recently-announced Rarity Farming player reward bonus of 50,000 GHST is a great example of this, as is the Matic liquidity migration incentive of 50,000 USD we are offering starting January 29.\n\nPlease signal whether or not you support this modification to the Aavegotchi DAICO bonding curve. \n",

NFTs are a big part of the DCL community and will continue to be so as art and collectable NFTs are taking off. The DCL community loves to show off their art and collectable NFTs in the DCL world. Aavegotchi could be apart of this collectable/art scene as well as being apart of Defi etc etc. Potential ideas and options below.\n\n1. Being able to display your Aavegotchi in game like artwork. Similar to Cryptokittes atm. (I believe this should already be able to happen, once our Aavegotchi NFTs are minted)\n\n2. Creating Aavegotchi merch. Wearables, shirts, hats etc or even a hand held Aavegotchi device you can carry? (Has to be approved through DCL DAO etc) \n\n3. Bring 3D models of Aavegotchis into DCL to roam around. There is already 3D models from Axie Infinity and Ethermon roaming around and land in DCL already. Aavegotchi ghosts could do the same, would be great marketing and bring attention to the space.\n\n4. Create an in game store / building to advertise and promote Aavegotchi.\n\n5. Great idea for Aavegotchi, lets create something in DCL\n\n6. No this is not a good idea for Aavegotchi and or isn't possible.",

      "content": "I propose that each portal, along side the choice of 1 of 10 Aavegotchi, should also come with a NFT wearable that is unique to the haunt that it came from. \n\nThe NFTs will have different rarity and only a certain number will be available while opening portals. \n\nRarity as follows\nCommon 45%\nUncommon 30%\nRare 15%\nMythic 7%\nLegendary 3%\n\nThese drop rates can be voted on by the DAO at a future time to be adjusted but as this would be the first haunt I think it should be more rewarding.\n\nThe NFT wearables will also be decided on by the DAO as to what wearable has what rarity, this makes each of the items more likely desirable due to the nature of the community consensus. \n\nAs each portal has the choice to be used it creates value in holding onto the unused portal as chances legendary rarity can go up for a haunt if NFTs of those rarities for that haunt haven't been found.",
