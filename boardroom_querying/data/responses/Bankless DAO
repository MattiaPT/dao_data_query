      "content": "**Title:** Vote to Ratify Transition Council Authority\n**Authors:** Hiro Kennelly, trewkat\n**Forum Post:** [Transition Council Authority](https://forum.bankless.community/t/transition-council-authority/10737)\n\n# SUMMARY\n\nThe Transition Council, which was established to guide our community through this period of change, is seeking BANK-holder ratification of its authority to implement a broad set of changes within the DAO, as described in this [Forum post](https://forum.bankless.community/t/transition-council-authority/10737). \n\n\nSix Transition Council members were appointed at the June 24, 2024 Governance meeting, per a [tlBANK Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/tlbank.banklessvault.eth/proposal/0x26ab0168ff7c2fd2751c5427343343d564c668bae33c7401901b95563c28e7e1). To date, the six appointed members have proceeded with work around purpose and branding, but before we move forward with officially implementing these changes and making additional decisions that will further shape our future, we believe it’s crucial to have the broader community’s formal and documented backing. \n\n# SPECIFICATIONS\n\nIf ratified, the Transition Council will have the authority to:\n\n* Implement its selected new name and brand identity for the DAO (Black Flag DAO) across social media accounts and web presence.\n* Decide on the role of the BANK token and issuance of new token(s) within the new Black Flag DAO.\n* Change the Black Flag DAO membership requirements and organizational structure.\n* Decide on the tooling necessary to operationalize these changes.\n* Update DAO governance processes to reflect membership and/or token ownership rights.\n* Produce a replacement Constitution that reflects these changes (and any others necessary to effectuate these changes). While the replacement Constitution will be written and implemented by the Transition Council with consideration of community feedback, the text will include a process by which members can later suggest and enact revisions to the new Constitution. (After community feedback, the language of this bullet point is slightly different than the Forum post).\n\n# DISCUSSION\nAny discussion related to this Snapshot vote should take place on the [Forum post](https://forum.bankless.community/t/transition-council-authority/10737).\n\n# POLL\nDo you support the Transition Council’s authority to implement the changes listed under Specifications? This token-weighted Snapshot vote will run for seven days and requires ≥ 66% approval (Yes vote) to pass.",

      "title": "Season 10 Guild Signaling",
      "content": "# Summary\nAs per the [changes](https://forum.bankless.community/t/announcement-changes-to-the-s10-seasonal-funding-process/9905) to the Season 10 (S10) [Seasonal Funding Process](https://forum.bankless.community/t/announcement-changes-to-the-s10-seasonal-funding-process/9905), guilds get a flat rate for S10 plus a bonus depending on DAO sentiment.  This snapshot asks members of the DAO to signal their support of a guild via voting, which will then be used to award an additional 500,000 BANK for guilds to use to attract and retain talent.\n\n# Specification\nBelow you will find a list of guilds [vetted by Grants Committee](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18FOh-izySD0wWAsH6i739skODY5cnsTJumGjO8Yw3jw/edit#gid=0) and receiving grants for Season 10.  DAO members are asked to signal their support for guilds by allocating some of their token-weight to each guild.  This functions almost exactly like a Grants Committee election - you can distribute your vote to as many guilds as you wish and also choose the weight of each vote.\n\n**Note:** this is not retro-funding, it is a measure of DAO sentiment towards guilds.  If you feel a guild is doing a good job and want it to get more resources, weigh your vote higher for that guild.  To help make your choice, here are some links to the S10 grant requests from the included guilds:\n* [Project Management Guild](https://forum.bankless.community/t/project-management-guild-season-10-funding-request/9969)\n* [Developer's Guild](https://forum.bankless.community/t/developers-guild-season-10-funding-request/9981)\n* [AV Guild](https://forum.bankless.community/t/av-guild-season-10-funding-request/9971)\n* [Design Guild](https://forum.bankless.community/t/design-guild-season10-funding-proposal/9962)\n* [Writers Guild](https://forum.bankless.community/t/writers-guild-season-10-budget-proposal/10002)\n\n**Note:** The last option is for those who don’t think any listed guild should get additional funds.  If you select this option, you are effectively voting for the BANK above to stay in the treasury.",

      "content": "Squad: Treasury Department\nDate Created: 12.06.2023\n\n## TLDR:\nBanklessDAO treasury has 14,693.416 DAI sitting idle\nDeposit DAI in BanklessDAO’s Rari Fuse pool and earn 6.53% APY\n\n## BACKGROUND\nAfter migrating DAO liquidity to Uniswap V3 in early 2022 [here 1], the DAO was able to create a Rari Fuse pool to enable BANK holders to borrow against their BANK.\n\n## What is Rari Fuse?\n\nWinverse wrote a nice piece about it in the 4th June, 2022 issue of the Weekly Rollup(here), but in short Rari Fuse allowed the DAO to create its own money market. [link]\n\n## SPECIFICATION\nIf approved, the follow transaction will be initiated\n\nBDAO multisig would submit a deposit transaction into the rari fuse contract\n\nThe treasury department will monitor this position and submit a proposal to withdraw when it is no longer feasible to earn yield from this strategy.\n\nThis proposal grants the Treasury Deptment the right to deposit the aforementioned funds into the Rari pool from, and the right to decide and execute the withdraw of such funds back into the DAO multi-sig when judged to be appropriate and necessary for economic or risk considerations.\n\n## Risks and disclosures:\n- As with anything in DeFi, this strategy is vulnerable to smart contract risks\n- The strategy is also vulnerable to loss of value resulting from by high slippage trades triggered by high volatility black swan events\n- The rari front end may go down, although this can be mitigated by interacting with the smart contracts directly. The Treasury Department will monitor this and be prepared to exit.",

      "content": "### Summary:\n\nThis proposal seeks to renew DAOStewards as the official meta-governance group of BanklessDAO for Season 9, enabling the BanklessDAO Vault Multsig to delegate eligible governance tokens to DAOStewards upon request. DAOStewards will report back to the DAO at the end of each season and propose to renew the delegation.\n\n### Background:\n\nBankless DAOStewards is a meta-governance group formed in late 2022, with the goal of representing BanklessDAO in the governance of other DAOs. Through effective governance, the reputations of DAOstewards and BanklessDAO grows, which translates into revenue for BanklessDAO and its projects.\n\nSince inception, we have helped BanklessDAO and its projects earn over 130,000 OP via Optimism, claim 701,275 Collab.Land tokens, and have otherwise helped steward $30,000 to DAO-related projects and affiliated contributors via public good projects such as Gitcoin, DAO Drops, and clr.fund.\n\nWe hold delegated voting power from both the Vault and the DAO’s contributors, and have actively participated in the governance of multiple DAOs, including Optimism, Arbitrum, Safe, and Uniswap. Our voting rate remains over 80% and we always communicate our voting rationale via our Notion page 1.\n\n### Mission & Values Alignment:\n\nDAOStewards have a proven track record of helping BanklessDAO projects earn revenue, thus enabling contributors to be focused on the mission of helping the world #goBankless.\n\nWe lead with Bankless, our members are among the most value-aligned contributors in the DAO. In the coming season we will incorporate tlBANK as a requirement for our governors, thus further aligning our relationship with BanklessDAO and its values.\n\n### Scope of Work:\n\nIn practise this will have the following implications:\n\nIf ratified, DAOStewards will receive delegation of all delegatable governance tokens for Season 9.\n\nDAOStewards will regularly report its voting activity and other wins during the weekly Community Calls.\n\nDAOStewards will post a report of its activities at the end of each season and seek renewal of delegation from the DAO.\n\nIf the proposal gains consensus on Forum, DAOStewards will receive delegation of all possible governance tokens for S9 and the consequent implementation will be included in the seasonal spec subject to community approval each season\n\nDAOStewards will incorporate tlBANK into its membership and compensation structure.\n\n### Financial Implications:\n\nThere are no immediate costs associated with this proposal.\n\n### Success Metrics or KPIs:\n\nRevenue raised for BanklessDAO and its projects\nVoting weight\n\n### Squad Background:\n\nCurrent active contributors of DAOStewards include:\n\nBaer.eth : L2 member, Project champion: Bankless wallet, active governor at SAFE, 1inch\n\nLinks: L2 member, Project champion: Bankless Card, active governor at SAFE\n\nHiroKennely: L2 member, Project Champion: Bankless Publishing, active governor at Optimism, A\n\nThinkdecade: L2 member, Project champion: Bankless Africa, Active governor at Optimism, SAF\n\nLiviuC: L2 member, Active governor at Arbitrum\n\nJengajojo: L2 member, Project Champion: IMN, Global Events, DAOStewards, Governance Dept coordinator, Active governor: SAFE, Optimism, Arbitrum, Gitcoin, 1inch, AAVE, VITA",

      "content": "Title: Season 9 Specification\nProposal Champion: 0xZFI\nDate: August 21st, 2023\n\n# SUMMARY\n\nThis is the finalized BanklessDAO Season 9 Specification.\n\n**Some Quick Reminders**\n\n* Seasonal Specifications are not to handle funding requests. Any organizational unit requesting funding should go through the Seasonal Budget Request process and be reviewed by the Grants Committee.\n* Any changes to governance would need to be proposed with their own individual bDIPs (bDIP Template [here](https://github.com/BanklessDAO/bankless-dao-constitution/blob/main/bDIP-template.md))\n\nThe Seasonal Specifications are simply general operational specifications that allow organizational units to plan for the following season. While the Operations Department will manage the specifications we want as much input from DAO Members as possible so as to make decisions that align with members.\n\n# Operational/Governance Changes\n\nThese changes have been proposed and have independently passed a vote on the Forum during the current season and their details are to be implemented upon their passage or in upcoming weeks. The vote on this Seasonal Specification will not impact the results of these previously-passed proposals.\n\n* **bDIP-10: Revision to BanklessDAO Constitution**\n  * [Snapshot ](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/0x00373e42a742a9e0eafbcd201b022faad8acbc6aed73ec568a2de9adc54bc298)\n  * The BanklessDAO Constitution has been revised to simplify the language and add clarity without making any changes to governance.\n  * This bDIP replaces the entire existing Constitution with the entire revised Constitution. The revised text is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WUwx4LiZs3lOgi-uz69ctcOUUMxcMlK7zNtbwpFeYe8/edit?usp=sharing).\n* ****BanklessDAO Multi-sig Wallet Election****\n  * [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/0x29097420d4f6ad3e040839c217001cd602a9b457c2d69a45ad2d84ac65c5bddc)\n  * The Banklessvault.eth multi-sig was refreshed after a year, which allowed inactive members to step-down and active contributors to step-in\n* ****bDIP-11: Dynamic Forum Quorum for bDIPs****\n  * [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/0x29097420d4f6ad3e040839c217001cd602a9b457c2d69a45ad2d84ac65c5bddc)\n  * A formula-based dynamic quorum will be adopted for bDIPs in order to better adapt to the DAO’s evolving membership and reduce the impact of voter apathy. The quorum threshold will be updated each month by the Governance Department according to the formula stated in this proposal.\n* **Delegate Snapshot Proposal rights to Governance Dept**\n  * [Delegate Snapshot Proposal rights to Governance Dept](https://forum.bankless.community/t/delegate-snapshot-proposal-rights-to-governance-dept/8330)\n   * The Governance Department multi-sig has been granted Snapshot posting permissions\n\n# Community-Indicated Direction\n\nThese temp-checks have been posted on the Forum for discussion and voting, but their details are not ready for immediate implementation. This list indicates new experiments and directions the community is considering taking, but specifics are still being worked out. The vote on this Seasonal Specification will not impact the results of these discussions.\n\n* **TEMP CHECK - Sybil Resistant Forum**\n  * [TEMP CHECK - Sybil Resistant Forum - #7 by BueMetaforo ](https://forum.bankless.community/t/temp-check-sybil-resistant-forum/5753/7)\n  * Discussion still open, feedback welcomed\n  * From the Governance Department’s S9 Funding Request:\n    * “Citing the recent Sybil attacks, we have kickstarted the process to integrate Gitcoin Passport on forum. We are currently waiting for the Passport team to finish the integration so we can deploy this feature in Season 9.”\n  * 92%/8%/0%; Yes, No, Maybe (poll still open)\n* **DAO Next Season Goals Survey**\n  * [DAO Next Season Goals Survey](https://forum.bankless.community/t/dao-next-season-goals-survey/5450)\n  * Survey closed; analysis in progress\n  * From the Governance Department’s S9 Funding Request:\n    * “The department collected feedback from the community on the direction we should take as a DAO via the DAO Goals survey. We will follow this up with a SWOT analysis of the DAO and create next steps towards alignment in S9.”\n\nIf this proposal passes Snapshot, the following timeline will fall into place for Season 9:\n\n# Season 9 Operations Timeline\n\n**DAO Operational Timeline** [[Notion link](https://bankless.notion.site/0e5b263706154f73bb54790c63c00643?v=03f00bb16dbf44348c70e4ba9ac655ea&pvs=4)]\n\n* September 4 : Season 9 begins\n* Week 1 or 2 : The Season 9 Kick-Off Event will be held on Twitter\n* November 11 : All funding requests from guilds, departments, and projects to be posted to the Forum for the Grants Committee to review\n* November 12 - 25 : Grants Committee to work with groups to review funding requests\n* November 19 - December 2 : Draft 1 of the Season 10 Specification to be posted to the Forums\n* November 26 - December 9 : Grants Committee to work with groups to finalize funding requests\n* November 26 - December 9 : Season 10 Grants Committee Election applications accepted\n* December 3 - 9 : Draft 2 of the Season 10 Specification to be posted to the Forums\n* December 10 : The Season 10 Grants Committee election will be posted to Snapshot\n* December 10 : The Season 10 Specification will be posted to Snapshot\n* December 10 : The Season 10 Budget Request will be posted to Snapshot\n* December 17, 2023 : Last day of Season 9\n* December 18 - January 1, 2024 : Annual Break (15-day gap)",

      "content": "Author: @daolexa\nSquad: Grants Committee\n\n## SUMMARY:\n\nIn view of the recent changes and the extended duration of the season, the Grants Committee is seeking additional funding to cover contributors’ compensation related to the tasks that will be undertaken by the Committee members. We are asking to approve additional weekly funding for the Grants Committee members.\n\n## BACKGROUND:\n\nThe mandate of the Grants Committee (as stated in the Constitution):\n\nThe Grants Committee is required to be transparent and communicative with the DAO, such as access to Committee meetings and an opportunity to voice opinions and feedback.\nSeasonal funding is distributed to Guilds and Departments paid from DAO Multisig, and Projects are paid from GC Multisig after the funding approval has been granted.\nBefore new seasons begin, all previously funded guilds, departments and projects must submit a funding proposal to the forum for the Grants Committee to review. Funding proposals that pass the Grants Committee review process are packaged together in a single seasonal budget Snapshot vote.\nOrganizational units seeking funding over the course of a season will be directed to the Grants Committee upon successfully passing their Forum proposal. The Grants Committee is responsible to evaluate these requests and has the liberty to accept or reject these requests for funds.\nOrganizational units seeking funding over the course of a season will be directed to the Grants Committee upon successfully passing their Forum proposal. The Grants Committee is responsible to evaluate these requests and has the liberty to accept or reject these requests for funds.\nDuring the last weeks of Season 7, the Committee had to address internal matters and underwent a change in its membership. As a result, the request for additional funding was not considered a priority at that time.\n\n## GOALS FOR SEASON 8:\n\nThe Grants Committee acknowledges the previous communication and other issues that have arisen between the Committee and other Guilds. Therefore, we are fully dedicated to finding solutions and improving communication with Guilds and projects. Additionally, we aim to establish streamlined processes that will enhance the efficiency of our work and funding procedures.\n\nMoving forward, the GC will maintain its weekly meetings with projects every Friday at 1 PM UTC. We will also keep the DAO updated on any internal changes and modifications to our processes.\n\n## FUNDING REQUEST:\n\n## Additional funding requested is:\n\nEach member: 3,846 $BANK/week\nLeads: 6,250 $BANK/week",

      "content": "Author: Icedcool🏴\nSquad: Tokenomics Department\n\n## TLDR\n**Challenge:** In Optimism L2, there is currently no DAO-owned liquidity.\nL1 Gas costs are increasing, and BanklessDAO Subdao operations are growing on Optimism.\nTo address this, we propose migrating 5 ETH and ~2.2M BANK from mainnet to establish a full range position on Uniswap V3, creating an initial liquidity pool of ~$20k.\nAdditionally, an Arrakis dynamic ranged position will be implemented to support contributors interested in providing LP.\n\n## SUMMARY\nBanklessDAO lacks DAO-owned liquidity on Optimism. With BanklessDAO's expansion to Optimism's Layer 2 (L2), the need for liquidity has grown. To facilitate the utilization of BANK, the Treasury Department proposes migrating $20k of liquidity into a BANK/WETH full range Uniswap V3 position.\n\nThis proposal seeks approval from the DAO to implement this liquidity and support Optimism operations.\n\n## SPECIFICATIONS\n- Migrate 5 ETH and ~2.2M BANK to the Optimism BANK/WETH Uniswap V3 position.\n\n## IMPLEMENTATION\nThe implementation steps are as follows:\n\n1. BDAO multisig will bridge the 5 ETH and ~2.2M BANK to Optimism.\n2. The multisig will then deposit these assets into the Optimism BANK/WETH Uniswap V3 position.\n\nAfter implementation, the liquidity depth will be approximately $20k, facilitating initial Optimism liquidity. The Treasury Department will monitor and analyze the volume and usage. After 3 months, a decision will be made whether to maintain or further deepen the liquidity.\n\nThis vote will remain active for 7 days. Pending approval of this vote, it will proceed to snapshot for DAO-wide approval.",

      "content": "Author: Jengajojo, Icedcool, Hirokennelly\n\n## TL;DR\nDelegate Snapshot proposals to the BanklessDAO Governance Department to support governance.\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal seeks to grant the Governance Department of BanklessDAO rights concurrent with the BanklessDAO Vault multisig signers to post proposals on the DAO’s Snapshot. These rights would be delegated from the BanklessDAO Vault multisig, whose signers would retain ultimate authority to delete any proposals submitted by the Governance Department.\n\n## Background\nCurrently, posting proposals on Snapshot is limited to the BanklessDAO Vault multi-sig, restricting the process to those seven signers. Extending posting rights to the Governance Department furthers decentralization, transparency, inclusivity, and operational efficiency.\n\n## Specification\n- **Delegating Posting Rights:** The BanklessDAO Vault multisig will delegate posting rights on Snapshot to the Governance Department, allowing them to create and submit proposals on behalf of the DAO. Vault multisig signers retain rights to delete proposals.\n\n- **Proposal Review and Feedback:** The Governance Department will gain consensus from the Vault multisig signers on proposal text, ensuring consensus and decentralization.\n\n- **Transparent Proposal Publication:** After review, the Governance Department will post on Snapshot and create an announcement for visibility.\n\n## Process Overview\nGovernance Dept. approval process:\n\nStep 1: Ensure proper format and quorum.\n\nStep 2: Edit text for accurate proposal language.\n\nStep 3: Initiate multi-sig tx from Department wallet with 12-hour delay.\n\nStep 4: Make a DAOwide announcement through communication channels.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- **Implementation:** If majority support, BanklessDAO Vault multisig signers execute necessary actions to delegate Snapshot posting rights to the Governance Department multisig.",

      "title": "Delegate VITA Tokens to DAOstewards.eth ",
      "content": "Author: @cryptodad @jengajojo @baer.eth\nSquad: DAOstewards\n\n# TL;DR\nThis proposal suggests delegating VITA token voting rights to DAOstewards.eth to improve BanklessDAO’s participation in VitaDAO’s governance. It aims to build on top of the treasury swap we did with VITADAO last year and create mutual collaboration, which can solidify the DAO position as a leader in the web3 space.\n\n# Background\nBanklessDAO holds various other DAOs’ governance tokens, which grants BanklessDAO voting rights in participating in these DAOs’ governance processes. It is crucial for BanklessDAO to actively participate in the governance of these DAOs and provide value to them. However, it can be challenging for average BanklessDAO members to timely and efficiently follow what happens in these DAOs and participate in the governance process.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, DAOstewards is a meta-governance group formed in Season 61 for BanklessDAO, consisting of dedicated BanklessDAO members with competence, discipline, and bandwidth to participate in the governance process. Since then, DAOstewards has been assigned to vote for SAFE token held by BanklessDAO.\n\nIn Season 5, BanklessDAO acquired VITA tokens via token swap1 but was not able to actively participate in the governance of VitaDAO. This proposal aims to assign VITA token voting rights to DAOstewards to improve governance participation in VitaDAO.\n\n# Mission and Value Alignment\nBy actively executing voting rights and participating in governance processes, BanklessDAO can provide valuable input and contribute to the success of VitaDAO. This, in turn, can increase the value of the VITA token, benefiting both VitaDAO and BanklessDAO.\n\nThrough its active participation in the governance of other DAOs, such as VitaDAO, BanklessDAO can set an example and encourage those DAOs to participate in BanklessDAO’s own governance. This mutual collaboration can create more value for all parties involved and foster a more robust web3 ecosystem.\n\nActive governance participation can also be a powerful tool for BanklessDAO to increase its influence and promote initiatives that align with its mission. By engaging with other DAOs, BanklessDAO can leverage its expertise and resources to advance important projects, expand its network, and solidify its position as a leader in the web3 space.\n\n# Specifications\nThe VITA token is the governance token of the VitaDAO ecosystem, which aims to develop and commercialize cellular and gene therapies. To increase participation in VitaDAO’s governance, we propose that BanklessDAO delegate its voting power to ‘daostewards.eth’.\n\nDAOStewards will act as the delegate of BanklessDAO to make proposals, give feedback, and vote in VitaDAO’s governance. To carry out this duty, DAOStewards will form a dedicated group of individuals with competence, discipline, and bandwidth to participate in VitaDAO’s governance process.\n\n# VITA Delegate Pod Structure\nThe DAOstewards delegation comprises max. five members who are vetted DAO governance participants.\n\n# Selection Process of Pod Members\nDAOSteward’s core team has onboarded the following governance talents:\n\nJengajojo\nCryptodad\nThinkdecade\n\nThanks to the VitaDAO and Metropolis Pod smart contracts, delegate membership is fluid; the Membership is represented as ERC721 access tokens, the DAO or the initial cohort of delegates can add or remove members if a member is inactive or not value-aligned. The exact process of removal should be fleshed out.\n\nHistorical Voting of BanklessDAO in VitaDAO\nNone, The current voting power of BanklessDAO in VitaDAO is 16,046 VITA. The expected voting power after the snapshot is also 16,046 VITA.\n\n# Financial Implications\nThe delegation of tokens requires no new or unexpected expenses. Delegation and voting on-chain require gas, which is covered by BanklessDAO’s gas refund policy.\n\n# Success Metrics or KPIs\nThe success of the delegation of VITA token voting rights to DAOstewards will be measured based on the percentage of all proposals voted on and communication of the rationale behind votes, and revenue/perks generated for BanklessDAO.",

      "title": " bDIP-11: Dynamic Forum Quorum for bDIPs",
      "content": "Author: Governance Department\n\n## BDIP SUMMARY\n\nThis proposal suggests adopting a formula-based dynamic quorum for bDIPs in order to better adapt to the DAO’s evolving membership and reduce the impact of voter apathy. The quorum threshold will be updated each month by the Governance Department according to the formula stated in this proposal.\n\n## BDIP BACKGROUND\n\nQuorum was defined in the Constitution at a time when there were many more active contributors. The challenge with a static threshold is that it is unlikely to reflect the number of active contributors in the DAO at any given time; attention to governance matters can vary significantly between bull and the bear market phases.\n\n## BDIP SPECIFICATION\n\nHow can we address this challenge?\n\nWe can either update thresholds manually via the bDIP process — a large administrative burden — or we can adopt a formula-based approach which can dynamically update thresholds based on current Forum activity.\n\n##### How will dynamic quorum work?\n\n- The Governance Department will make a Forum post each month setting the Forum quorum requirements based on the below formula. bDIP proposers should refer to the latest available forum update for the appropriate quorum requirement.    \n- All governance proposals posted in that month will need to meet that quorum threshold to proceed to Snapshot.\n- All governance proposals need to insert a link to the Forum quorum post for the relevant month to enable accurate record keeping.\n\n##### Changes to the governance procedure\n\nThis proposal will modify the quorum table in the Constitution as follows:\n\n| Governance update | Forum quorum                                   | Approval % | Timeline |\n|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|\n| Major             | 30-day Average + (0.2 x 30-day Average) | 70%         | 1 week   |\n| Minor             | 30-day Average                                  | 70%         | 1 week   |\n| Patch             | 30-day Average - (0.2 x 30-day Average) | 70%         | 1 week   |\n\nThe following text shall be added to the Constitution:\n\n- All Forum quorum calculations are rounded to the nearest whole number\n- Any poll which has been live for at least 7 days will be used to calculate the quorum threshold. \n- If a Forum post includes more than one poll, each poll should be considered a separate datapoint\n- 30-day Average formula = Sum of votes / number of independent polls\n- The Governance Department is responsible for updating the quorum thresholds at the beginning of each month via a Forum post. bDIP proposers should refer to the latest available forum update for the appropriate quorum requirement\n\n##### The bDIP proposal template will include the following update:\n\nInsert a link to the quorum threshold for this proposal.\n\n## EXPECTED IMPACT\nMakes Forum quorum more dynamic and reflective of the latest activity in the DAO.\n\n## ANALYTICS\nHere is an example of the Forum post that the Governance Department will make:\n\nQuorum Threshold for the month of ‘x’:\n\n| Title                                  | Value |\n|----------------------------------------|-------|\n| Major                                  | 50    |\n| Minor                                  | 41    |\n| Patch                                  | 33    |\n\nCalculation:\n\n| Date posted | Post title                                              | #votes |\n|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 02-12-2022  | Snapshot voting - Implement Shielded Voting              | 53     |\n| 14-12-2022  | Weekly rollup recap video series                         | 38     |\n| 12-12-2022  | Purpose Driven Guild Funding                             | 29     |\n| 06-12-2022 | Proposal to re-create the Education Guild Organizational Unit within the DAO | 29     |\n| 25-11-2022  | Marketing Department Season 6 - Content Coordinator Re-election | 58     |\n\n## NEXT STEPS\n- Update Constitution\n- Update bDIP Format\n\n## WORKING GROUP BACKGROUND\nGovernance Department",

      "content": "# bDIP-10: Revision to BanklessDAO Constitution\n\n**Draft Authors:** Trewkat, HiroKennelly, links, Ernest of Gaia\n**Working Group:** Trewkat, HiroKennelly, links, Ernest of Gaia\n\n# BDIP SUMMARY\n\n* BanklessDAO’s Constitution lacks clarity and completeness.\n* We have created a revision of the BanklessDAO Constitution which simplifies the language without making any changes to governance.\n* This bDIP is to replace the entire existing Constitution with the entire revised Constitution. The revised text is available [here ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WUwx4LiZs3lOgi-uz69ctcOUUMxcMlK7zNtbwpFeYe8/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n# BDIP BACKGROUND\n\nThis work has been supported by the Governance Department with the dual goals being:\n\n* to update the wording of the existing Constitution so that the information is presented in clear and concise language within an intuitive, numbered structure.\n* to document information about existing governance practices which were not included in the existing Constitution.\n\nThe goal for this round of work has NOT been to introduce new governance principles or practices, except where there was concurrent work happening and its inclusion made sense.\n\n***Notes from the Temp Check***\nThis bDIP follows a [Temp Check ](https://forum.bankless.community/t/temp-check-proposed-revision-to-banklessdao-constitution/5690) which included polling on various aspects of the proposed revision.\n\nAs a result of **Poll 1**, the following section of the proposed version has been updated, as follows:\n\n* 4.6.4 Grants Committee Election Process “… any Level 1 Member may self-nominate … “\n\nThe Constitution currently states “anyone may self-nominate”, but 89% of Poll 1 voters were in favour of changing this language to reflect current practice.\n\nText referred to by the other polls in the Temp Check was already included in the proposed document and this text was accepted by the majority of voters.\n\n* **Poll 2** resulted in 100% of votes in favour.\n* **Poll 3** resulted in 84% of votes in favour.\n\n**Poll 4** asked whether the proposed revised Constitution is ready to proceed to a bDIP in its current form, and resulted in 91% of voters in favour.\n\nLastly, as a result of the recent [tlBANK proposal ](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/0x964d634883d3ee073ef2994e178bf735a71bf6d85f16332ea5718e395cba635e) passing Snapshot, Section 3.2 of the proposed version has been updated from what was first referenced by the Temp Check to incorporate language about tlBANK. Note the added text does not match the text approved in bDIP-09 but retains the intent.\n\n***Vote Time!***\nIt’s now time to vote on whether the proposed revised Constitution should replace the existing BanklessDAO Constitution in its entirety, remembering that no changes to governance rights, responsibilities, or processes are enacted by this new version.\n\n# BDIP SPECIFICATION\n\nRather than include the full text of both documents in this proposal, the relevant links can be accessed below.\n\n|Current Form|Proposal|\n| --- | --- |\n|[BanklessDAO Constitution & Community Handbook ](https://github.com/BanklessDAO/bankless-dao-constitution/blob/main/bdao-constitution.md)|[BanklessDAO Constitution ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WUwx4LiZs3lOgi-uz69ctcOUUMxcMlK7zNtbwpFeYe8/edit?usp=sharing)|\n\n# EXPECTED IMPACT\n\nWe anticipate that if the revised version of the Constitution is implemented it will clarify our current governance practices and establish the foundation for future governance revisions.\n\n# ANALYTICS\n\nn/a\n\n# NEXT STEPS\n\nWe expect this to be designated as a Major change; although it does not make changes to governance, it is a substantial revision to the existing document. Therefore, the following governance proposal thresholds must be met on Forum before the bDIP proceeds to a Snapshot vote:\n\n|Governance Update|Forum Quorum|Approval %|Timeline|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Major|63|70%|1 week|\n\nSnapshot proposals run for seven days and require ≥66% approval. If the bDIP proceeds to Snapshot and is approved, the Governance Department will be prompted to update the Constitution.\n\n# WORKING GROUP BACKGROUND\n\nTrewkat, Ernest of Gaia, HiroKennelly, and links are long-time Level 2 Contributors.\n\n# POLL\n\nDo you support this proposal for the revised Constitution text to replace the existing BanklessDAO Constitution in its entirety?\n\n* Approve\n* Abstain\n* Reject",

This was sought in order to have a price oracle that could integrate with RARI (which now no longer supports borrowing) or other DeFi platforms in the future. The UNIv3 position has additionally benefited us by consolidating the BANK-ETH liquidity, driving the majority of the volume to Uniswap and improving fee revenue to the DAO treasury.\n\nUniswap offers a 1% fee pool for smaller market cap tokens with higher volatility (perfect for BANK), and this pool is now where the majority of the existing liquidity lives. Making Uniswap v3 the primary source of liquidity for BANK has shown to be a clear benefit, supporting the majority of transaction volume and maximizing fee revenue to the DAO treasury.\n\n# SPECIFICATION\n\nThe steps would be as follows:\n\n1. [BDAO multisig 2](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf26d1bb347a59f6c283c53156519cc1b1abaca51) would[ submit a fee-collecting transaction 1](https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/main/v3-sdk/collecting-fees/README.md) to[ collect accrued fees 2](https://docs.uniswap.org/sdk/v3/guides/liquidity/liquidity-fees) from the UNIv3 liquidity position.\n\n2.

Hopefully the schedule allows for a smooth season transition for everyone.\n\n* Season 8: Mon, May 15 - Sun, August 27 (15 weeks)\n* Gap Week: Mon, August 28 - Sun, Sept 3 (1 week)\n\nThat break is important and I wanted to ensure our operational timelines were aligned to accommodate Gap Week by default. Notice the Gap week is technically between the seasons.\n\nPlease review the proposed[ timeline for Season 8](https://www.notion.so/Season-8-Specification-Draft-afd496ca247c419b879eef813033f0d8) and provide any feedback regarding the adjustment of dates. If a change in dates is desired for any of the Season 8 milestones, please open discussion in the comments so that any updates can be reflected in a second draft.\n\n### Author’s Introduction\n\nHello! I am Ernest of Gaia, and I have been stewarding the Season 8 transition. The processes around season transitions have been adapting to changes in governance, so I’d like to offer some context on the current state of the season transition process.\n\n### Some quick reminders:\n\n* Seasonal Specifications are not to handle funding requests. Any organizational unit requesting funding should go through the Seasonal Budget Request and be reviewed by the Grants Committee.\n* Any changes to governance would need to be proposed with their own individual bDIPs\n  * [Bdip Template](https://github.com/BanklessDAO/bankless-dao-constitution/blob/main/bDIP-template.md)\n\nThe Seasonal Specifications are simply general operational specifications that allow organizational units to plan for the following season. While the Operations Department will manage the specifications we want as much input from DAO Members as possible so as to make decisions that align with members.\n\nThis process is evolving and is not without flaws. Suggestions for improvements are welcome. Thank you for your active participation in BanklessDAO governance. Let’s make 2023 up-only!\n\n### Remaining Season 7 Operations Timeline\n\n* May 1: The Season 8 Specification will be posted to Snapshot\n* May 1: The Season 8 Budget Request will be posted to Snapshot\n* May 8-14: Gap Week\n* May 14: Last day of Season 7\n\n# “State of the bDIPs” - Community-Indicated Direction and Operational Governance Changes\n\n[BDIP Template 1](https://forum.bankless.community/t/bdip-template-bdip-n-topic/4366)\n\n[Constitution and BDIP Standard](https://forum.bankless.community/t/constitution-bdip-standard-part-2/3740) Discussion & Proposal Part 2\n\nThese changes have been proposed and have independently passed a vote on the Forum during the current season and their details are to be implemented upon their passage or in upcoming weeks. The vote on this Seasonal Specification will not impact the results of these previously-passed proposals.\n\n### Old Business\n\n* Season 6[ bDIP-00: Seasonal Funding Process Clarification](https://forum.bankless.community/t/bdip-00-seasonal-funding-process-clarification/4662) Went to Snapshot Ratified, All updates were put into place\n  * [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/0x188955a5f1e169c46e600a60a8d8e3c6449b32776dbd43718d16a96ff121e9ba)\n* Season 6 Patch[ bDIP-01: Correcting Grant Proposal Requirements](https://forum.bankless.community/t/bdip-01-correcting-grant-proposal-requirements/4695) - Approved, Ratified, All Updates were put in place\n  * [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/0x092ca3b8133a105b9abcc9a9dd19d47cdd2117071956227a4982c34ac3612b7e)\n\n### Season 7 Business\n\n* Season 6 -[ bDIP-02: Coordinated Timing Across BanklessDAO](https://forum.bankless.community/t/bdip-02-coordinated-timing-across-banklessdao/4752) - Approved, Ratified, All Updates put in place\n  * [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/0x2a5e217854a0b85a44f260199c6fdb9dfdd5dad9dd9e788050f7450a679e2b77)\n* Season 7 -[ bDIP-07: Set Season Length at 16 Weeks with Designated Downtime](https://forum.bankless.community/t/bdip-07-set-season-length-at-16-weeks-with-designated-downtime/5140) - Approved, Ratified, All Updates put in place\n  * [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/0x446bce1363261a936d64c8797b158c327afcbb5efa380a7e40f0a37987d8bdb6)\n* Season 7 - [ bDIP-8: Selection and Election of BanklessDAO Vault Multi-Signature Wallet Signers](https://forum.bankless.community/t/bdip-n-selection-and-election-of-banklessdao-vault-multi-signature-wallet-signers/5298) - met quorum, approved, currently resolved snapshot and Approved\n  * [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/0x092241f8160b6b3d0072e1c9c8d41f384c8778c8eda7b6ed97ee64645b32f2e1) Ended April 17, 2023, 12:00 AM\n\n### Unresolved business\n\n* Season 6 - [bDIP-03: Dynamic forum quorum for bDIPs](https://forum.bankless.community/t/bdip-03-dynamic-forum-quorum-for-bdips/4927) Met Quorum.\n  * Next steps: Finish getting revision approval and submit to Snapshot.\n* Season 6 -[ bDIP 04 : Departments](https://forum.bankless.community/t/bdip-04-departments/4973) Has not met quorum, is not approved, nor gone to snapshot.\n* Season 6 - bDIP 05 adjustments to member based funding - abandoned in Temp Check stage, Taxonomy is Retired.\n* Season 6 - Temp Check [bDIP - 6 - Code Of Conduct Change](https://forum.bankless.community/t/bdip-6-code-of-conduct-change/5064) - This proposal has been closed, keep an eye out for discussions in the DAO discord.\n\n### New Business\n\n* Season 7 - [[bDIP-N]: Expanding the Mandate of Governance Department](https://forum.bankless.community/t/bdip-n-expanding-the-mandate-of-governance-department/5215) - Proposal closed\n* Season 7 - [bDIP-N: Level update to include tlBANK](https://forum.bankless.community/t/bdip-n-level-update-to-include-tlbank/5419) - met quorum, up on snapshot\n  * [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/0x964d634883d3ee073ef2994e178bf735a71bf6d85f16332ea5718e395cba635e)\n* Season 7 -[ Formal Proposal - Minor bDIP N- Format Change to Constitution & Community Handbook](https://forum.bankless.community/t/formal-proposal-minor-bdip-n-format-change-to-constitution-community-handbook/5285) - has not met quorum\n\n## Season 8 Operational Timeline - 15 weeks\n\n* May 4th: 2nd Year DAO Birthday\n* May 8-14: Gap Week\n* Mon, May 15th - Season 8 Begins\n* Week 1 or 2: Season Kick Off Event\n* July 9th - 22nd: All Seasonal funding requests to be posted to the Forum for the Grants Committee to review.\n* July 23rd - August 5th: Grants Committee to work with groups to review funding requests\n* July 30th: Draft 1 of the Season 9 Specification to be posted to the Forums\n* August 6th - 19th: Grants Committee to work with groups to finalize funding requests\n* August 6th - 19th : Season 9 Grants Committee Election applications accepted\n* August 20th: The Season 9 Grants Committee election will be posted to Snapshot\n* August 20th: The Season 9 Specification will be posted to Snapshot\n* August 20th : The Season 9 Budget Request will be posted to Snapshot\n* Sun, August 27th: Last day of Season 8\n* Gap Week: Mon, August 28th - Sun, Sept 3rd (1 week)",

To keep up with these changes, it is imperative that the token itself evolve. tlBANK was first introduced on the forum[ here 5](https://forum.bankless.community/t/tlbank-time-lock-bank-draft-1/4299). Since then, we have seen support for the use of tlBANK grow. This can be seen in multiple forum posts that have obtained quorum. This can be seen[ here 5](https://forum.bankless.community/t/tlbank-time-lock-bank-draft-1/4299) and[ here 2](https://forum.bankless.community/t/season-6-bankless-research-grants-proposal/4465). The use of tlBANK was ratified in[ this 2](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/0xdb3c64468dcc7156aa7b43576f71977727e62b7dd6b199ec44c110d61413e9ea) snapshot vote.\n\n# BDIP SPECIFICATION\n\n### Recognize tlBANK as L1\n\n|Current Text|New Text|\n| --- | --- |\n| L1 - Members | L1 - Members|\n|Full DAO members are those who have accumulated the requisite 35,000 BANK and are authenticated in the Discord server.

The benefits of L1s include access to additional Discord channels and no longer needing to renew the guest pass. DAO Members that mint the preset tlBANK will also be given L1 Membership with the included benefits. Only the tlBANK minting address receives the L1 access.|\n\n# EXPECTED IMPACT\n\n* This will create secondary use cases for the BANK token by:\n  * Allowing tlBANK to trade on any NFT marketplace.\n  * Creating new areas of involvement and alignment of projects.\n* UI will define lockup, but open ended on the back to allow projects different involvement.\n* ONLY the minting address will receive the L1 Access to the DAO.\n\n# NEXT STEPS\n\n* Upon ratification, go to snapshot\n* Upon snapshot approval, modify CollabLand configuration to support tlBANK as an L1 level.\n\n# POLL\n* Approve\n* Abstain\n* Reject",

      "content": "**Title:** bDIP-08: Selection and Election of BanklessDAO Vault Multi-Signature Wallet Signers\n**Authors:** senad.eth#8782, links#7868, Trewkat#1933, HiroKennellyᵍᵐ#0001\n**Working Group:** HiroKennellyᵍᵐ#0001, jengajojo#5896, links#7868, senad.eth#8782, thinkDecade#7181, Trewkat#1933\n**Scope:** Minor Change\n\n---\n\n# BDIP SUMMARY\n\nBased on the feedback received from the [Swapping BanklessDAO Multi-Signers [Temp Check]](https://forum.bankless.community/t/swapping-banklessdao-multi-signers-temp-check/5210) , this bDIP seeks to modify the BanklessDAO Constitution to include text regarding the selection criteria, mandate, and election procedures associated with the role of a BanklessDAO Vault multi-signature wallet signer.\n\n# BDIP BACKGROUND\n\n* In S1, BanklessDAO members [agreed to transfer control](https://forum.bankless.community/t/dao-control-of-treasury-multisig/1480) of the DAO treasury from the Genesis members to the DAO. The results were then ratified via [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/Qmdthz7Anz7g2aJJAewNqm3gQnssP5NkS2StNKELvArQkk).\n* Via [Forum](https://forum.bankless.community/t/submission-for-multi-sig-signer-applicants/1661/3) post, DAO members applied to become BanklessDAO Vault multi-signature wallet signers. An election was held on the [Forum](https://forum.bankless.community/t/dao-multi-sig-signers-vote/1729), and later [ratified via Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/QmYmHuawgkCZxVMo6EHq5s2WxQrSwTYZeBGRfFkc1xeW5f).\n* The current cohort of BanklessDAO Vault multi-signature wallet signers are: Icedcool, frogmonkee, Above Average Joe, RedVan, 0xLucas, Eagle, and Kouros. Only Above Average Joe and Icedcool remain active in the DAO.\n* The recent [Temp Check](https://forum.bankless.community/t/swapping-banklessdao-multi-signers-temp-check/5210) indicated a desire to codify the mandate, selection, and election of BanklessDAO’s multi-signature wallet signers.\n* This bDIP seeks to enshrine the mandate, selection criteria, and election procedures for BanklessDAO’s multi-signatue wallet signers in the Constitution.\n\n---\n\n# BDIP SPECIFICATION\n\n## Current Form of “[DAO Organizational Units](https://github.com/BanklessDAO/bankless-dao-constitution/blob/main/bdao-constitution.md#dao-organizational-units)”\n\nThere is no mention of the BanklessDAO Vault multi-signature wallet signers in the Constitution.\n\n## Proposal\n\n[Text to be included immediately before the [Grants Committee](https://github.com/BanklessDAO/bankless-dao-constitution/blob/main/bdao-constitution.md#grants-committee) section of [DAO Organizational Units](https://github.com/BanklessDAO/bankless-dao-constitution/blob/main/bdao-constitution.md#dao-organizational-units)]\n\n### BanklessDAO Vault Multi-Signature Wallet\n\nThe BanklessDAO Vault multi-signature wallet (vault multisig) is the holder of DAO funds, and disburses BANK to DAO Organizational Units. It is managed by a team of seven BanklessDAO members, and requires four of the seven members to sign in order for any transaction to be executed.\n\nVault multisig signers have the following rights and responsibilities:\n\n|Rights (can do)|Responsibilities (must do)|\n| --- | --- |\n|Can create transactions for consideration by other signers.|Must work to ensure the perpetuity of the DAO’s existence in alignment with the DAO’s mission, vision, and values.|\n|Can approve or reject transactions at their own discretion.|Must sign and execute transactions in a timely manner.|\n||Must vet all transactions to make sure that they align with agreed decisions.|\n||Must validate the individual transactions of mass payouts to ensure they are legitimate.|\n||Must monitor the vault multisig’s activity.|\n||Must manage access and permissions to the multisig.|\n||Must keep their own software and hardware secure and up-to-date.|\n|Can post proposals to the BanklessDAO Snapshot.org space.|Must vet Snapshot proposals to confirm compliance with established governance procedures.|\n||Must steward the process of moving proposals to Snapshot.|\n\n### Vault Multisig Signer Elections\n\nTo be considered for selection and to retain the role, vault multisig signers must meet the following criteria:\n\n1. Recognition as a Level 2 Contributor of BanklessDAO.\n2. Active membership of BanklessDAO for at least one year.\n3. A previously held leadership position in the DAO (equivalent to Guild Coordinator, Project Champion, Grants Committee).\n4. Experience as a signer on a multi-signature wallet.\n5. Current knowledge of BanklessDAO’s governance procedures.\n\n### Elections have the following procedure:\n\n1. To kick off an election, any BanklessDAO member can post a [formal proposal](https://github.com/BanklessDAO/bankless-dao-constitution/blob/main/bdao-constitution.md#formal-proposals) to check the level of support to hold a vault multisig signer election. This proposal must have a poll which passes the [Minor quorum thresholds](https://github.com/BanklessDAO/bankless-dao-constitution/blob/main/bdao-constitution.md#formal-proposals).\n2. When the formal proposal reaches quorum, the member may then post a Forum post to gather candidates. In this post, candidates must provide evidence that they meet the eligibility requirements. This proposal must stay up for at least one week.\n3. After one week, the veracity of each candidate’s eligibility evidence must be validated by the member who posted the proposal. This member will then post the final candidate list in a comment on the proposal.\n4. The current vault multisig signers must then post a token-weighted poll on Snapshot with the list of candidates specified above as well as a list of the current vault multisig signers as options (barring any signer who wishes to step away from the role). This poll must stay open for at least one week.\n5. The seven candidates with the highest proportion of support will become the new vault multisig signers. The current signers must take the steps to add/remove members as needed to ensure the group of vault multisig signers reflects the will of the DAO.\n\n### Removal of Vault Multisig Signers\n\nVault multisig signers can be removed if:\n\n1. a vault multisig signer has violated any of the mandated responsibilities.\n2. any member in the DAO gathers consensus via Forum on the no-confidence state of a vault multisig signer or the vault multisig signers as a whole.\n\nThere is no term limit for vault multisig signers, however continuation in the role is subject to the community vote.\n\n# EXPECTED IMPACT\n\nThis change will mean the DAO has adequately documented procedural information about the role of a BanklessDAO Vault multi-signature wallet signer. It is anticipated that if enacted, this update will be followed with an election for a new team of BanklessDAO Vault multi-signature wallet signers.\n\n# ANALYTICS\n\nAfter this bDIP is ratified, we hope to hold an election to increase active multi-signature wallet signers from 2/7 to 7/7.\n\n# NEXT STEPS\n\nAchieve Minor quorum to add bDIP to Constitution, then run an election.\n\n# WORKING GROUP BACKGROUND\n\nHiroKennellyᵍᵐ🏴#0001 - Guild and project coordinator, BC Associate, contributor to various projects.\njengajojo🏴#5896 - Contributor in governance and project management.\nlinks#7868 - L2 Contributor, PM Guild Coordinator, Bankless Card Champion, governance enthusiast.\nsenad.eth 🏴#8782 - L2 Contributor, Member of the Grants Committee, ex-DAOlationships Guild Coordinator and Project Champion of B Labs.\nthinkDecade 🏴#7181 - L2 Contributor, GC member, project management.\nTrewkat#1933 - L2 Contributor in Writers Guild and several other projects and teams.\n",

      "title": "bDIP-07: Set Season Length at 16 Weeks with Designated Downtime",
      "content": "**Author:** Trewkat\n**Working Group:** Trewkat, links, HiroKennelly\n**Date:** February 13, 2023 6:00 AM\n\n---\n\n# BDIP SUMMARY\n\nTo date, the DAO’s practice is to set the exact dates for each upcoming Season during the final weeks of the current season, which are then ratified by the community via Snapshot. This has shown to be an error-prone and inefficient practice which negatively impacts planning in teams across the DAO.\n\nThis bDIP seeks to set season length at 16 weeks and designate formal downtime between each, to commence in 2024 following two adjusted seasons for the remainder of 2023.\n\n# BDIP BACKGROUND\n\nIn February 2022, the Forum proposal titled[ The Super Season: Proposing a 6-month season between April and October 2](https://forum.bankless.community/t/the-super-season-proposing-a-6-month-season-between-april-and-october/3031) suggested a one-off, six-month ‘super season’ to address perceived issues associated with a three-month season, specifically that budget planning “ four times per year … expends tons of bandwidth that could be going toward working on and in the organization.”\n\nWhile there was general agreement for the concept of a super season, with 52% voting in favour and a further 26% voting for “maybe, with edits”, there was also positive support (10 likes) for a comment suggesting a 16-week season instead.\n\nIn March 2022 the original proposal author created a new proposal titled[ 4-Month Season Proposal: SuperSeason Revisions 2](https://forum.bankless.community/t/4-month-season-proposal-superseason-revisions/3140), which stated that “Based on discussions in the #seasons channel and feedback from many contributors, a four-month season (16-weeks) seems to be a happy medium.” Despite 93% of the 30 voters being in favour, no action was taken.\n\nIt’s possible that inaction was due to the timing of the proposal which suggested implementation within a few weeks’ time. These proposals occurred prior to the existence of the DAO Constitution and during a period of confusion around Forum and Snapshot quorum thresholds, which may also be a contributing factor in the lack of progression.\n\n# BDIP SPECIFICATION\n\n\n|**Current Form**|**Proposal**|\n| --- | --- |\n|**Section: DAO Cycles -[ Seasons 1](https://github.com/BanklessDAO/bankless-dao-constitution/blob/main/bdao-constitution.md#seasons)**|**Section: DAO Cycles -[ Seasons 1](https://github.com/BanklessDAO/bankless-dao-constitution/blob/main/bdao-constitution.md#seasons)**\n|Seasons are funding cycles (typically 3 months) intended to align the DAO’s collective energy to key objectives. These objectives are in the form of funded initiatives BANK token holders vote on before each season.|Seasons are funding cycles (each set at 16 weeks) which are intended to align the DAO’s collective energy to key objectives. These objectives are in the form of funded initiatives voted on by BANK token holders before each season. Between seasons, the DAO schedules designated ‘Gap Weeks’ and an ‘Annual Break’ in order to respect the need for contributors to rest.\n|**Section: DAO Organizational Units -[ Grants Committee 2](https://github.com/BanklessDAO/bankless-dao-constitution/blob/main/bdao-constitution.md#grants-committee):** | **Section: DAO Organizational Units -[ Grants Committee 2](https://github.com/BanklessDAO/bankless-dao-constitution/blob/main/bdao-constitution.md#grants-committee):**|\n|Grants Leads serve a 6-month term and can resign at any time.| Grants Leads serve a 2-season term and can resign at any time.|\n|**Section: DAO Organizational Units -[ Grants Committee 2](https://github.com/BanklessDAO/bankless-dao-constitution/blob/main/bdao-constitution.md#grants-committee):** | **Section: DAO Organizational Units -[ Grants Committee 2](https://github.com/BanklessDAO/bankless-dao-constitution/blob/main/bdao-constitution.md#grants-committee):**|\n|Grants Reviewers serve a 6-month term and can resign at any time.|Grants Reviewers serve a 2-season term and can resign at any time.|\n\n\nThe textual change to the Constitution is minimal in terms of word count but high-impact in terms of operational change. However, given that this change does not alter the DAO’s activities or priorities, only the way in which our time is allocated, it is therefore designated as a Minor change.\n\nFurther, it should be noted here and in any subsequent Snapshot vote that the update to the Constitution will only truly reflect DAO practice from 2024, due to the suggested adjustment period to cover the remainder of 2023.\n\nTherefore this bDIP seeks not only a change to the Constitution wording in two places (as specified below), but also community consensus to specify season dates for the remainder of 2023 and thereafter as listed below. This is to ensure that the DAO can commence the 16-week season structure from January 2, 2024.\n\nAlthough the Constitution will not specify season dates for 2023, 2024, or subsequent years, the intention of this proposal is to gain consensus to commence Week 1 of the relevant season on January 2 (UTC) of any year, regardless of what day of the week that falls. The season dates do not need to change thereafter, only the days of the week on which they fall will change.\n\nAs a global organisation that promotes work-life balance and flexibility for contributors, the DAO does not need to stick to the traditional approach that all working weeks begin on a Monday.\n\nBeginning in 2024, and starting each year from January 2, the seasons would run for 16 weeks, with a one-week designated Gap Week between the first and second seasons, and another Gap Week between the second and third. Between the third season and the first season of the new calendar year there would be a 16-day designated Annual Break.\n\nThe Gap Weeks and Annual Break are opportunities to pause official events and encourage contributors to take a break. Teams within the DAO will have the ability to plan for budgeting and operational needs for these periods and may decide for themselves which activities should continue through breaks, if any.\n\nThe dates below provide a plan for the remainder of 2023 and the dates for 2024. Thereafter, each DAO year will start on January 2 and the season dates will be the same. The dates are intentionally omitted from the proposed Constitution wording because constitutions should capture high-level principles, not operational details. Please understand that if you vote to approve then you are signalling your approval of the dates as well as the Constitution change.\n\n## The Plan\n\nAccording to the Snapshot vote titled[ Season 7 Specification and Community-Indicated Direction 1](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/0xdb3c64468dcc7156aa7b43576f71977727e62b7dd6b199ec44c110d61413e9ea), Season 7’s designated Gap Week finishes on Sun, May 14, 2023.\n\nProposed Season Dates for 2023 (Seasons 8 and 9)\n\n* Season 8: Mon, May 15 - Sun, August 27 (15 weeks)\n* Gap Week: Mon, August 28 - Sun, Sept 3 (1 week)\n* Season 9: Mon, Sept 4 - Sun, Dec 17 (15 weeks)\n* Annual Break: Mon, Dec 18 2023- Mon, January 1 2024 (15 days)\n\nSeason Dates for 2024 (based on the specification detailed above)\n\n* Season 10: Tues January 2 - Mon April 22 (16 weeks)\n* Gap Week: Tues April 23 - Mon April 29 (1 week)\n* Season 11: Tues April 30 - Mon Aug 19 (16 weeks) - Week 1 would incorporate bDAO anniversary\n* Gap Week: Tues Aug 20 - Mon Aug 26 (1 week)\n* Season 12: Tues Aug 27 - Mon Dec 16 (16 weeks)\n* Annual Break: Tues Dec 17 - Wed January 1 2025 (16 days)\n\n2025 seasons begin on Thurs Jan 2.\n\n2026 seasons begin on Fri Jan 2.\n\n… and so on.\n\n\n# EXPECTED IMPACT\n\nAs noted above, the textual change to the Constitution is minimal but this is a highly impactful positive operational change for the DAO. It is anticipated that hundreds of hours will be saved through the designation of set seasonal dates, particularly in workstreams associated with:\n\n* Guild and Department role elections and budget planning.\n* Project budget planning.\n* Seasonal budgets assessment and approval (Grants Committee).\n* Seasonal planning (operations).\n* Season launch planning (marketing and design).\n\nIn addition, teams will be better able to plan contributor coverage for operational needs during Gap Weeks and Annual Breaks, whilst also recognising that contributors may also decide to take personal time away from the DAO at any time of the year. Having set dates for the year ahead enables productive discussions at team level about appropriate time away.\n\n# ANALYTICS\n\nThe DAO-wide sentiment survey could be used to collect feedback on the change.\n\n# Poll\nApprove\nReject\nAbstain",

Compared to Season 6, this timeline has things scheduled sooner to hopefully achieve a smoother season transition for everyone.

      "title": " bDIP-02: Coordinated Timing Across BanklessDAO",
      "content": "**Title:** bDIP-02 : Coordinated Timing Across BanklessDAO\n**Scope:** Minor Change\n**Draft Author:** Rowan (chunz)\n**Working Group:** Operations Department\n[**Link to Working GDoc**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ti4btJ7xPrx_U67ug_CMJmyINPUuQ6J6Lz8nU-r3wKs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n# BDIP SUMMARY\n\nThe [BanklessDAO Constitution ](https://github.com/BanklessDAO/bankless-dao-constitution/blob/main/bdao-constitution.md) doesn’t specify a single timezone around which we can all effectively coordinate. This may seem inconsequential most of the time, but twice each year confusion manifests as some regions observe “Daylight Savings”, while others do not. This bDIP will establish Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) as the single reference timezone for meetings and events across BanklessDAO.\n\n# BDIP BACKGROUND\n\nBanklessDAO is a global community, collaborating across countries and timezones. So far, we haven’t identified a single reference timezone for scheduling calls and events, and most of the time it’s not an issue. Twice each year, however, some regions shift their clocks by an hour, while others do not. Further, this shift isn’t coordinated across regions and occurs on a different date depending on where you live.\n\nAs UTC is the time standard by which most countries regulate clocks and time, it makes sense that bDAO would use this standard as well. UTC is not subject to “Daylight Savings” and most of the DAO already rely on it as a reference to avoid potential confusion resulting from timezone math.\n\n# BDIP SPECIFICATION\n\nThis bDIP introduces new content but is compatible with previous versions and can be considered a minor change.\n\n## Proposed Form\n\nIt is proposed that a new section of the Constitution is created:\n\n> ## DAO Coordination\n> BanklessDAO coordinates around Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). Wherever possible, meeting and event times are expressed in this timezone.\n\n# EXPECTED IMPACT\n\nbDAO will officially have a single, coordinated reference timezone (UTC).\n\n# ANALYTICS\n\nNone.\n\n# NEXT STEPS\n\n1. Collect feedback and make any necessary changes to the proposed bDIP.\n2. Get Forum consensus (quorum: 51 votes)\n3. Snapshot vote\n3. Update the Constitution\n\n# WORKING GROUP BACKGROUND\n\n**Rowan** was the Coordinator for the Operations Department in Season 5 and continued in Season 6.\n**Operations Department** includes many folks who meet to discuss aspects of bDAO function, developing solutions to improve DAO functions and operations.\n",

      "title": "bDIP-01: Correcting Grant Proposal Requirements",
      "content": "**Title:** bDIP-01: Correcting Grant Proposal Requirements\n\n**Scope:** patch (bug fix)\n\n**Draft Authors:** links\n\n**Working Group:** links, hirokennelly, trewkat, siddhearta\n\n# BDIP SUMMARY\n\nThe[ BanklessDAO Constitution](https://github.com/BanklessDAO/bankless-dao-constitution/blob/main/bdao-constitution.md) failed to capture the operational realities of the Grants Committee, and incorporated incorrect requirements (quorum, ungated polls) for grant proposals. This bDIP will bring the Constitution in line with the practices of the Grants Committee, providing clarity for future funding requests.\n\n# BDIP BACKGROUND\n\nThe BanklessDAO Constitution lists Forum quorum requirements for grant applications which are specified in the[ Firming Up Governance 6](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/0x0eb29303825c37c67ddc5d71b199bbc66c149712918c2a7c9261c7f6a2953d66) Snapshot vote. Those quorum requirements were interpreted by the Grants Committee as having been vacated by the[ Quorum Removal Vote 2](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/0x903b96c30ac4f555c3dd598e48d5b1566f394dfa072eb6945d7c093704d1f064). In the perceived absence of a quorum, the Grants Committee created its[ own quorum adjustment method 2](https://discord.com/channels/834499078434979890/996478071353909279/1005128811823775845), with help from the GSE, and this has been in operation since July, 2022. Later, the Constitution was enacted via a[ Snapshot vote which incorporated the incorrect quorum information 4](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/0x30028859fd36f3e6ac797b9cc1dac27ef9907d6a917191b4a75c19df9bc41863).\n\nThe BanklessDAO Constitution also states that proposal votes are REQUIRED to be ungated. This was never specified in any seasonal specification or previous Snapshot, and introduces significant security issues (sybil attacks). There have already been one suspected and one confirmed case of non-BanklessDAO members voting for grant proposals to meet quorum requirements, so it’s important we ensure the Constitution does not encourage this.\n\nThis bDIP’s intent is to patch the two bugs listed above.\n\n# BDIP SPECIFICATION\n\nSince this is a “bug fix”, this bDIP can be considered a patch.\n\n## Current Form\n\nForum voting leverages one vote per user and is not token-weighted or gated. Forum proposals require 70% approval to pass to successive stages of governance. Proposals must be posted for one week unless the request exceeds 1M BANK. In these instances, they must be posted for two weeks. Forum quorum is the minimum number of voters that need to be present for the vote to be valid and is listed in the following table. For example, if your Forum post is asking for 50,000 BANK or less, only 25 voters need to cast their votes for the vote to be valid.\n\n|Requested Bank|Forum Quorum|\n| --- | --- |\n|< 50k BANK|25|\n|50k - 250k BANK|31|\n|250k - 500k BANK|40|\n|500k - 1M BANK|51|\n|> 1M BANK|63|\n|Governance (Major)|63|\n|Governance (Minor)|51|\n|Governance (Patch)|40|\n\n[[See Snapshot 6](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/0x0eb29303825c37c67ddc5d71b199bbc66c149712918c2a7c9261c7f6a2953d66)]\n\n## Proposed Form\n\nProposal votes are one vote per user and are not token-weighted.

It has been reformatted to adhere to the procedure of governance changes as defined by our newly codified [Constitution](https://github.com/BanklessDAO/bankless-dao-constitution/blob/main/bdao-constitution.md#banklessdao-constitution--community-handbook). If this Seasonal Specification passes Snapshot, the following timeline will be ratified. Special considerations for focus in Season 6, as indicated through the [Season 6 Community Vote](https://forum.bankless.community/t/community-vote-season-6/4441), are included here as well.\n\n# Background\n\nAfter Draft 1 of the Season 6 Spec had been posted to the Forum, it was brought to the attention of the author that the Seasonal Specification process was superseded in Season 5 by the Constitution.\n\nAs such, the Seasonal Specification has been limited in scope to operational timeline ratification including community-indicated direction with bDIP suggestions.\n\n---\n\n## Season 6 Timeline\n\n* Season 6 will start on Monday, November 7, 2022.\n* Season 6 will end on Sunday, February 5, 2023.\n* Formal gap week will be February 6 through February 12, 2023.\n\n## Delayed Transition Timeline\n\n* The Season 6 Budget Proposal will be posted to Snapshot November 4, 2022.\n* The Season 6 Specification will be posted to Snapshot November 4, 2022.\n\n## Community-Indicated Direction\n\nThese changes have acquired consensus on the Forum but do not require addition to, or alteration of, the Constitution. They simply express the direction the Community has indicated they would like to take for Season 6 as a result of the Community Vote.\n\n* The community has [signaled an interest](https://forum.bankless.community/t/what-should-bankless-dao-focus-on-jokedao-results/4548) in increasing the utility of BANK tokens. Any guilds, departments, or projects whose purview encompasses this topic are encouraged to develop ideas and collaborate on this throughout Season 6.\n* The [Otterspace verifiable credentials pilot](https://forum.bankless.community/t/bdao-season-role-holder-badges-otterspace-pilot/4172) will begin in Season 6.\n* The Grants Committee [shall be allowed](https://forum.bankless.community/t/community-vote-season-6/4441) to remove an inactive and unreachable member with a unanimous consensus among other Committee members.\n\n## Changes that Require a bDIP\n\nAny potential changes to our Constitution would require a bDIP. bDIPs for the items below will be drafted for a formal voting process in Season 6.\n\n* [Member-Based Guild Funding](https://forum.bankless.community/t/member-based-guild-funding/4358) (previously called Automatic Guild Funding) will begin to apply for Season 6. Guilds, as categorized in Season 5, are to choose between continuing as a Guild or a Department, as defined by the taxonomy post [here](https://forum.bankless.community/t/an-idea-for-team-taxonomy-aka-wtf-is-a-guild/3745), and to submit funding requests accordingly.\n\nThe full Season 6 Specification post can be found [here](https://forum.bankless.community/t/draft-1-season-6-specification/4538).\n\n---\n\n# POLL\n\nApprove the Season 6 Specification, disapprove, or abstain.",

Established procedures through Season 5, including the Season 5 Specification process, were superseded by the Constitution, which was ratified during Season 5. As a result, the governance processes around the season transition require clarification.\n\nThis bDIP proposes new wording to the Funding section under Seasonal Budgets to accurately reflect current Seasonal Process. Its passage will allow seasonal funding to continue as intended, given the short timelines leading up to Season 6. Future bDIPs will be developed to further clarify the Constitution in this respect.\n\n**It is our intent to minimize the delay of funding disbursement for Season 6. If this bDIP passes, a seven day delay is expected. If this bDIP does not pass, the delay is unknown.**\n\n# BDIP SPECIFICATION\n\nThis is intended to be a Minor Change to the Constitution, as the proposed revision simply aims to provide procedural clarity for the seasonal funding process. As such, the Constitution would be updated to v1.1 if this bDIP passes the Forum and Snapshot votes.\n\n|Current Form|Proposed Change|\n| --- | --- |\n|Old text in *Funding*, under *Seasonal Budgets*:|Revision to *Funding*, under *Seasonal Budgets*:|\n|New seasons are initiated by all guilds and projects submitting proposals for funding. If these proposals pass Forum approval, they are packaged together in a single seasonal budget approval Snapshot vote. If this budget is approved, then the DAO multi-signers are responsible for issuing disbursements in line with the approved budget.|***Before new seasons begin, all previously funded guilds and projects must submit a funding proposal to the forum for the Grants Committee to review. Funding proposals that pass the Grants Committee review process*** are packaged together in a single seasonal budget Snapshot vote. If this budget is approved then the DAO multi-signers are responsible for issuing disbursements in line with the approved budget.|\n\n# EXPECTED IMPACT\n\nPassage of this bDIP would clarify and align the Constitution to current operations and enable the seasonal funding for Season 6. This would establish the operational procedure through which seasonal budget requests are approved going forward.\n\n# ACKNOWLEDGING RISKS\n\nIf this proposal does not pass on the Forum, we will be holding up the season transition and the funding requests that have already been approved by the Grants Committee. This bDIP would need revision until it passes. Only then could we continue with the seasonal funding round.\n\n# NEXT STEPS\n\nThis bDIP will be posted to the Forum for 7 days. If it passes on the Forum, it will be posted on Snapshot for 7 days. In order to facilitate timely Season 6 funding, the Season 6 Specification will be posted to Snapshot the day after the bDIP is posted and the votes will run simultaneously. Assuming the bDIP passes, the Season 6 Specification can also pass, and funding will be disbursed.",

      "content": "**Title:** Tokenomics - L2 Liquidity Deepening\n\n**Author:** Icedcool🏴#4947\n\n**Discord Vote:** [Link](https://discord.com/channels/834499078434979890/846544905958457377/1007284065621246032)\n\n**Forum Post:** [Link](https://forum.bankless.community/t/tokenomics-l2-liquidity-deepening/4125)\n\n---\n\n# TLDR\n\n* In Balancer L2 we have a liquidity depth of $46,419 (2184423 BANK and 5.4556 ETH)\n  * This translates into high slippage for AMM operations on Polygon.\n* We need sufficient liquidity on every chain $BANK is implemented on to enable BanklessDAO operations.\n* To resolve this we would like to migrate 50k of liquidity from L1 to Polygon Balancer\n  * Sushiswap [Liquidity](https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0x2c51eaa1bcc7b013c3f1d5985cdcb3c56dc3fbc1) (705,194.04 BANK and 7.49 ETH ≈ $24,122.29) - (50/50)\n  * Balancer [Liquidity](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x87165b659ba7746907a48763063efa3b323c2b0700020000000000000000002d) (1217788 BANK and 3 ETH ≈ $25,878) - (80/20)\n\n## SUMMARY\n\nBanklessDAO has the Balancer pool on Polygon which has a volume(usage) of around $1,000 daily. Currently we have a liquidity depth of 46k on L2, which is resulting in high slippage for people using and trading on L2. BanklessDAO needs to support the liquidity depth for operational usage on all chains, and so plans to migrate 24k of liquidity from Sushi (low usage) and 26k from the Balancer L1 pool for a total of 50K liquidity to support depth on Polygon L2.\n\nThis proposal is to gain approval from the DAO to migrate this liquidity to enable Polygon operations.\n\n## SPECIFICATIONS\n\n* Sushiswap [Liquidity](https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0x2c51eaa1bcc7b013c3f1d5985cdcb3c56dc3fbc1) (705,194.04 BANK and 7.49 ETH ≈ $24,122.29) - (50/50)\n* A portion of Balancer [Liquidity](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x87165b659ba7746907a48763063efa3b323c2b0700020000000000000000002d) (1217788 BANK and 3 ETH ≈ $25,878) - (80/20)\n\n## IMPLEMENTATION\n\nImplementation steps would be as follows:\n\n1. BDAO multisig would unpair the Sushiswap liquidity.\n2. The multisig would unpair a portion of the Balancer Liquidity (1217788 BANK and 3 ETH ≈ $25,878)\n3. The multisig would then migrate the total amount of assets to Polygon via the Treasury Guild Bridging Service (TBS) to the Polygon multisig (X ADDRESS)\n4. FInally the multisig would deposit the assets into Balancer pool at an 80/20% ratio.\n\n  1. The Sushi assets (50/50) would be auto balanced to the 80/20 ratio.\n\nPost implementation the liquidity depth will be at roughly 100k worth of depth, which should enable Polygon Operations and usage.\n\n",

The VitaDAO collective will directly hold legal IP rights to these projects and may develop a growing portfolio of assets represented as IP-NFTs and Tokens.\n\nMembers of the public can join VitaDAO and govern its IP through VITA tokens by contributing funds, work, or valuable research data or IP assets. VITA tokens enable their holders to engage in decision-making and governance of VitaDAO’s research, signal support for specific initiatives, and govern its data repositories and IP portfolio.\n\n## KEY VITADAO METRICS:\n\n* $9m+ Treasury to fund research\n* 3000+ Active Discord members\n* 30+ Research projects evaluated\n* $1.5m+ Longevity research funded\n\n![|624x352](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gBFWYBwTeearpFQaaR9V7_D6R3GTv3X-nrDHNYkemP8LAQySxTEAiKVokGe3xrfbmNnlgAtVRnM-BhSove1EEC6b0Wv2Ofe6ljTK6lybryb6aEpK9iNtQIuhmFgrq30BooSCwLAl4HKKJ9neJg)\n\n[1600×901 108 KB](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/bankless/original/2X/0/069c62a7aafe64e7eb2460f1023020c003d5a76a.jpeg)\n\nThe VitaDAO Ecosystem (Source: VitaDAO Whitepaper)\n\n## MISSION AND VALUES ALIGNMENT\n\nThis proposal will initiate the partnership between bDAO and VitaDAO, which aligns with what “Go Bankless” means: promoting decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant technology and community.\n\nThe Bankless meme envisions a world where people use web3/crypto tools to navigate the coordination challenges of the 21st Century. Funding longevity research is currently masked with red tape. If we are able to use web3/crypto tools to unlock new drugs and techniques to reduce the healthcare costs of society as a whole, it gives added validation for using web3/crypto tools to coordinate actions of apes around the world with this Bankless technology and encourages more people to adopt the Bankless lifestyle.\n\n## SPECIFICATIONS\n\n* USD 25,000 in notional value, swapped in BANK for VITA.\n* Token prices will be taken at the 30-day moving average at the end of the votes on both sides.\n  * Example: As of 3/31/2022, the 30-day moving average price is $0.03092 for BANK and $1.9730 for VITA. The swap would be 808,538 BANK for 12,671 VITA.\n\n## FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS\n\n* bDAO will swap USD 25,000 in notional value of BANK for VITA.\n\n## RISKS\n\nAs of the date this proposal is created, the only identified risk is investment risk.\n\n* The VITA token could become worthless if VitaDAO fails to create and retain value.\n* The maximum loss would be $25,000.\n\n## STIPULATIONS\n\n* Holding period: Both parties will hold the tokens for one(1) year after the swap.\n  * Sale of tokens: Following the one-year period, each party has the right of Preemption if the other party decides to sell.\n* Communications around the partnership\n  * To ensure operational effectiveness, a monthly call will be set up by at least one representative of each organization.\n\n## SUCCESSFUL METRICS OR KPIS\n\n* Increased treasury value from the token swap\n  * If the VITA token outperforms BANK, bDAO would gain exposure to the VITA token value.\n* VitaDAO adopts bDAO’s products or services.\n\n## DISCORD POLL\n\nTreasury Guild member[ temp check poll 3](https://discord.com/channels/834499078434979890/846544905958457377/961743114127699968):\n\n![poll|517x343](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/f8XNlGKHpMjIkOi5t2Qio26aTaa7pxgw9CPPgk3YIQ6HyXxN7h-EeA8epchb-jozJixnfiyjUsIUiJqk5J7w7iPpvWuS21hMReGBagu-4JkjViKruVIqq8OGgsCI7_YEY9g6tZmHBwsnfN29SA)\n\n## FORUM POLL\n\n![image|690x267](https://i.imgur.com/w88FEkL.png)\n",

      "title": "Tokenomics - Stake 10 ETH from Treasury using Rocket Pool",
      "content": "Title: Stake 10 ETH from Treasury using Rocket Pool\nAuthors: 0xHunter#3863\nDate Created: March 9th, 2022\nDate Posted: March 30th, 2022\n**Status:** Snapshot [Draft->Voting->Forum Voting->Snapshot->Closed]\n**Forum Post:** [Post](https://forum.bankless.community/t/tokenomics-stake-10-eth-from-treasury-using-rocket-pool/3199)\n\n\n## TLDR\n\n* Stake 10 ETH from the Bankless treasury with Rocket Pool\n  * Generate 4.3% annual yield (potential ~10% after the PoS merge)\n  * Support permissionless staked ETH pooling infrastructure\n  * Gather data to support staking larger percentage of Bankless treasury ETH in the future\n\n## Summary\n\nThe proposal is to stake (10 ETH) of our ETH in the treasury (34.45 ETH) for rETH to generate passive yield on ETH and support permissionless, decentralized PoS ETH staking. The reason for starting with a 10 ETH stake is to minimize our initial Rocket Pool protocol risk exposure, and we should stake more after we are more confident in the benefits of staking our ETH with Rocket Pool. rETH is liquid and can be swapped back for ETH at any time if needed.\n\nThe future vision that this proposal will aid in proving out is to make holding rETH (or other decentralized ETH PoS pools) the standard for the BanklessDAO treasury using any ETH not set aside for gas. This proposal is our initial foray into this vision.\n\n## BACKGROUND\n\nWe currently have 34.45 ETH in our treasury that could be passively generating low-risk yield via securing the ETH PoS network using Rocket Pool’s protocol.\n\nRocket Pool docs:[ https://docs.rocketpool.net/ 1](https://docs.rocketpool.net/)\n\n## MISSION & VALUES ALIGNMENT\n\nThis proposal would extend our treasury runway by generating low-risk yield, which would allow BanklessDAO to allocate more funds to support our mission.\n\nThis proposal is also highly aligned with BanklessDAO’s commitment to supporting fully permissionless, decentralized systems. Rocket Pool is currently the only fully permissionless, decentralized ETH PoS Staking system. This system allows anyone with less than 32 ETH and anyone willing to maintain a validator to secure the ETH PoS consensus mechanism. In the same way that the Ethereum community has elected to maintain low block size in the PoW consensus mechanism to allow for a higher degree of decentralization, Rocket Pool allows any amount of ETH to be staked, further decentralizing the upcoming PoS consensus mechanism.\n\nWhy not Lido?\n\nLido is not a truly permissionless platform and whitelists validators. This mitigates slashing risk but does not promote true decentralization. Rocket Pool has collateral mechanisms to mitigate slashing effects instead of whitelisting, which is outlined in the specification below.\n\n## SCOPE OF WORK\n\nStake 10 ETH from our treasury for rETH\n\n## SPECIFICATION\n\nYield: Currently, Rocket Pool’s website lists a 4.33% APR, which will decrease slowly as more ETH is staked and potentially jump up to ~9-12% APR ([Reference by Justin Drake](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vrK5sY5ooq-F8dcyRhmmAJ5YtgkvWKWP3OfGCZIYxSA/edit?usp=sharing)) after the PoS merge and fees are distributed to PoS validators.\n\n### Income generated per season:\n\n10 ETH stake:\n\n* 0.099 ETH per season pre-merge\n\n* 0.249 ETH per season post-merge\n\nFuture potential of 34.45 ETH stake:\n\n* 0.345 ETH per season pre-merge\n\n* 0.861 ETH per season post-merge\n\nSlashing risk: There is a slashing risk losing underlying ETH if the Rocket Pool validators misbehave, but this is heavily insured by the ETH and Rocket Pool token collateral that validators have to put up. And the pooled nature of rETH spreads the risk across all holders (Reference:[ 🤔 Frequently Asked Questions | Rocket Pool](https://docs.rocketpool.net/overview/faq/#how-does-the-protocol-protect-the-value-of-reth)).\n\nSmart contract risk: There is a risk of the Rocket Pool contracts being exploited, although greatly reduced as they have been audited by Sigma Prime and ConsenSys Diligence and have been operational on mainnet since November 9th 2021 and have gone through multiple rounds of beta testing (Reference:[ 🤔 Frequently Asked Questions | Rocket Pool](https://docs.rocketpool.net/overview/faq/#are-your-smart-contracts-audited-and-open-source)).\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS OR KPIS\n\nYield: Any yield would be considered a success against our current ETH generating no yield. Slashing and Rocket Pool smart contract exploitation could move our yield below 0%, so we should still consider this a success despite a slashing event or smart contract exploit if our yield stays above 0%.\n\n## NEXT STEPS\n\nStake 10 ETH from our treasury for rETH\n\n\n\n",

One such method is to partner with specific decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to allow BANK token owners to increase their holdings by providing liquidity mining incentives to any BANK token owner that provides liquidity (Liquidity Providing/Provider, or LP) to BANK pools in those protocols. This mechanism not only allows for a higher yield percentage on fees accrued in said pools, but also provides rewards in the form of more BANK tokens, as well as protocol tokens.\n\nOne such agreement was made in August of 2021 to launch an 80/20 BANK/wETH liquidity pool with Balancer protocol[[1] ](https://forum.bankless.community/t/launch-bank-liquidity-mining-on-the-80-bank-20-weth-balancer-pool/1337). The proposal passed and the BANK/wETH Balancer Pool on Ethereum Mainnet was established with liquidity mining benefits that allowed Liquidity Provider (LP) token owners to earn both BAL and BANK for participating. Due to miscommunication with the timing for rewards distribution, Balancer ran rewards for five weeks beyond what was agreed upon. As a result, they have come up short on BANK to distribute. Because bDAO values our partnership with Balancer, we want to address this discrepancy and provide Balancer with the necessary BANK to distribute as rewards to those who provided liquidity during the extended rewards period.\n\n## SOLUTION\n\nThis proposal addresses this inconsistency and fulfills bDAO’s obligation to Balancer and LP token owners. Upon approval, bDAO will provide 475K BANK to Balancer to distribute five weeks worth of liquidity mining rewards to LP token holders during the reward period, not only honoring bDAO’s agreement with Balancer, but in appreciation for their willingness to provide rewards . This will also serve to maintain bDAO’s social capital, as potential partners can be confident that bDAO executes on its responsibilities.\n",

      "content": "**Title:** BalancerDAO’s collaboration with BanklessDAO (Newsletter Sponsorship, Polygon Liquidity Pool, Written content and Podcast)\n**Forum Post:** [Link\n](https://forum.bankless.community/t/balancerdao-s-collaboration-with-banklessdao-newsletter-sponsorship-polygon-liquidity-pool-written-content-and-podcast/2722/23)**Authors:** @eagle, @grendel, @siddhearta, @Andrea BalancerDAO, @Icedcool\n**Original submission Date:** 1/13/22\n**Resubmission Date:** 3/6/22 (post Quorum)\n\n# SUMMARY\n\nBalancerDAO offers to sponsor one BanklessDAO newsletter for the entire 2022 in exchange for a strong economic incentive in BAL for the BANK/WETH pool on Polygon.\n\nMoreover, Balancer is interested in awarding a grant to BanklessDAO for obtaining media coverage concerning its DAO and the aforementioned BANK/WETH liquidity pool on Polygon.\n\nDIFFERENCE FROM PREVIOUS [SNAPSHOT VOTE](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/QmU1Rz7s87ow29QsfeCee7j2jr7H9h6BFkoPmVu6Ux56XD):\nWe will be migrating BanklessDAO owned Balancer liquidity from L1 to L2 to provide the liquidity needs for this Balancer pool. To do this, we will unpair the DAO owned balancer liquidity, migrating it up to L2, then submitting for L2 incentive distribution.\n\n## BACKGROUND\n\n[Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/) is a well-known DeFi platform, which recently decided to launch its DAO.\n\nBalancer and BanklessDAO collaborated together in the last season. Balancer has awarded to BanklessDAO an educational grant and has launched a liquidity BANK/WETH pool 1 on Ethereum. Recently, Balancer has launched a BANK/WETH pool 3 on Polygon.\n\n## MISSION & VALUES ALIGNMENT\n\nThe mission of BanklessDAO is to help the world go Bankless by creating user-friendly onramps for people to discover decentralized financial technologies. Due to its characteristics, Balancer is the perfect example of a DeFi project which could help the world go Bankless, in allowing to create liquidity and to earn from assets which are deposited in the Balancer’s pool. Moreover, in launching its DAO, Balancer - in line with the more advanced web 3.0 culture - demonstrates the willingness of decentralizing its operations.\n\nMoreover, this type of collaboration demonstrates that BanklessDAO has reached a mature status, where projects show up and demand for client services. In the future, sponsorships and paid services will make our DAO financially sustainable.\n\n## SPECIFICATION / BUDGET\n\n1. Polygon BANK/WETH liquidity pool incentives and BanklessDAO Newsletter sponsorship\n\nBanklessDAO is requested to deposit in the BANK/WETH 80/20 Polygon liquidity pool:\n\n* 4M BANK\n* 14 WETH\n\nBalancer will grant for the entire 2022 a weekly reward of 300 BAL (apx. 5k USD) for depositors. It means that if, for instance, BanklessDAO holds 50% of the liquidity in the pool, a revenue of 10k USD in BAL will be granted to the DAO treasury on a monthly basis (as 1200 BAL per month have a value of apx. 20k USD).\n\nAs consideration of the pool incentives, BanklessDAO will host BalancerDAO as the main sponsor on the “Weekly Roll-up” newsletter or the “State of the DAOs” newsletter for the entire 2022. The precise collocation of Balancer’s sponsorship will be determined on a seasonal basis.\n\n2. BalancerDAO’s grant for media coverage\n\nBalancerDAO would like to award to BanklessDAO a grant of 7k USD in BAL for:\n\nA medium post where the collaboration between Market and BanklessDAO will be announced (500 USD)\n\n2 medium articles, which will be tweeted 2 times by the BanklessDAO account and that will be mentioned in the weekly roll-up. (2,500 USD)\n\nArticle 1: The Multi-chain Strategy of Balancer\n\nArticle 2: The Creation of the Balancer DAO (with a short version in the State of the DAOs DAO Spotlight section)\n\nA Crypto-Sapiens Podcast where the founders will present the Balancer DAO (2,000 USDC)\n\nA strong marketing campaign concerning the liquidity pools (4 tweets with graphics prepared by designers) (1,000 USD)\n\n1,000 USD for the project champions\n\n## FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS\n\nIn order to get the pool incentives on a yearly basis, BanklessDAO is requested to deposit in the BANK/WETH 80/20 Polygon liquidity pool:\n\n* 4M BANK\n* 14 WETH\n\nIMPORTANT: Funding will be provided by the BanklessDAO treasury. We will use the BPT tokens that are DAO own, unpair them on L1, migrate them to Polygon, then submit to the polygon liquidity pool.\n\nAs to the media coverage, Balancer will cover the entire costs.\n\n## BRAND USAGE\n\nEvery published item will present BalancerDAO and BanklessDAO logos together.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS OR KPIS\n\nSuccess will be evaluated from the number of views of the articles, the likes of the tweets and from the number of the participants at the podcast and at the workshop.\n\nMoreover, Balancer will also evaluate whether the media coverage has brought an increment in the usage of the BANK/WETH liquidity pools.\n\n## NEXT STEPS\n\nThe proposal requires a snapshot vote.\n\nIn case of approval, the champion of the proposal will organize the teams to cover the planned work.\n\nWriters’ Guild Client Services will organize the written content and the publication on Medium. BalancerDAO’s founders will be put in contact with representatives of Crypto-Sapiens in order to organize the podcast.\n\n## SQUAD BACKGROUND\n\n@Eagle is the Legal Guild Coordinator and member of the Grants Committee. He is a Law Professor and Lawyer interested in blockchain technology, DAO governance and DeFi\n\n@Grendel is the Translator Guild Coordinator and member of the Grants Committee. He is a IT entrepreneur who designs and implements fungible and non-fungible tokenization blockchain projects.\n\n@andrea Balancer is a Balancer core contributor and marketing strategist\n\n@siddhearta is the Bankless DAO Newsletter Coordinator.",

      "title": " Tokenomics - Migrate DAO-Owned Liquidity to Uniswap V3 ",
      "content": "**Proposal Name:** Tokenomics - Migrate DAO-Owned Liquidity to Uniswap V3\n**Program Champion(s):** 0xLucas, Icedcool, HashedMae, tokenomics crew\n**OP Date:** March 4, 2022\n**Status:** Snapshot Vote\n**Discord Voting Link:** [Discord Vote ](https://discord.com/channels/834499078434979890/846544905958457377/934896869346275408)\n**Forum Voting Link:** [Forum Vote ](https://forum.bankless.community/t/tokenomics-migrate-dao-owned-liquidity-to-uniswap-v3/2848)\n\n## TL;DR\n\n* Migrate Sushiswap protocol owned liquidity to Uniswap V3 full range position.\n* This move will create a price oracle, allowing us to launch a Rari lending market and generate more revenue as the Uniswap position has fees defined at 1% (Sushiswap is 0.25%).\n\n## Background\n\nThe Tokenomics Department is working on creating lending markets for $BANK. This will initially begin with deploying a Rari Capital Fuse Pool on Ethereum mainnet while opening up the ability to also launch on a Layer 2 lending protocol (Market.xyz on Polygon or Rari on Arbitrum) in the future.\n\nAdding a lending market has multiple benefits. For one, it allows BANK holders to deposit and borrow against their holdings rather than having to sell. More importantly, this allows the treasury to open up its own lending market.\n\n\nIn order to kick this off, we need strong price oracles for $BANK that’s supported by lending markets. Rari Capital leverages Uniswap V3 oracles; however, all of the DAO owned liquidity is on Sushi. As such, we can easily bootstrap a lending market by migrating our liquidity to Uniswap v3 as a full range position (the position providing the strongest oracle).\n\n## Implementation\n\nThis proposal looks to pull the liquidity that we have acquired from OlympusPro Bonding, owned by the treasury, and migrate that over to Uniswap v3 as a full range position. As of writing, this amounts to $500,000 in liquidity. As a result, this will allow us to have a price oracle that is integrated with Rari, and any future integrations with other defi platforms.\n\nAdditionally, Uniswap offers a 1% fee pool. This fee tier is for smaller cap, exotic tokens with more volatility (perfect for BANK) and is where the majority of the existing liquidity lives. The benefit here is that this will make Uniswap the primary source of liquidity for BANK, driving the majority of the volume Uniswap and the fee revenue to the DAO treasury.\n\nFor reference, Sushiswap fees are 0.25%, meaning the treasury can generate 3x the revenue by migrating.\n\n**More info on uniswap oracles:**\n[Uniswap oracles ](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V2/concepts/core-concepts/oracles)",

Ex, got approval on the GSE vote([23M votes](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/0x749e887debb581c7b416376ffe12d73de3a8a304310479e0c8a2a672ef8785ca)), but didn’t reach 36.84M BANK vote, so it didn’t pass.\n\nOur plan is to abolish the quorum requirement with this vote, then re-propose the votes so that we can implement the GSE, then the GSE will re-propose a more researched quorum requirement.\n\nThe snapshot vote of this must reach the 36.8M BANK Quorum in order to be enacted.",

      "content": "Title: BalancerDAO’s collaboration with BanklessDAO (Newsletter Sponsorship, Polygon Liquidity Pool, Written content and Podcast)\n[Link to forum post](https://forum.bankless.community/t/balancerdao-s-collaboration-with-banklessdao-newsletter-sponsorship-polygon-liquidity-pool-written-content-and-podcast/2722/23)\n\nAuthors: @eagle, @grendel, @siddhearta, @Andrea BalancerDAO\n\nDate: 13 January 2022\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nBalancerDAO offers to sponsor one BanklessDAO newsletter for the entire 2022 in exchange for a strong economic incentive in BAL for the BANK/WETH pool on Polygon.\n\nMoreover, Balancer is interested in awarding a grant to BanklessDAO for obtaining media coverage concerning its DAO and the aforementioned BANK/WETH liquidity pool on Polygon.\n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\n[Balancer ](https://app.balancer.fi/#/)is a well-known DeFi platform, which recently decided to launch its DAO.\n\nBalancer and BanklessDAO collaborated together in the last season. Balancer has awarded to BanklessDAO an educational grant and has launched a liquidity BANK/WETH pool 1 on Ethereum. Recently, Balancer has launched a BANK/WETH pool 3 on Polygon.\n\n**MISSION & VALUES ALIGNMENT**\n\nThe mission of BanklessDAO is to help the world go Bankless by creating user-friendly onramps for people to discover decentralized financial technologies. Due to its characteristics, Balancer is the perfect example of a DeFi project which could help the world go Bankless, in allowing to create liquidity and to earn from assets which are deposited in the Balancer’s pool. Moreover, in launching its DAO, Balancer - in line with the more advanced web 3.0 culture - demonstrates the willingness of decentralizing its operations.\n\nMoreover, this type of collaboration demonstrates that BanklessDAO has reached a mature status, where projects show up and demand for client services. In the future, sponsorships and paid services will make our DAO financially sustainable.\n\n**SPECIFICATION / BUDGET**\n\n1. Polygon BANK/WETH liquidity pool incentives and BanklessDAO Newsletter sponsorship\n\nBanklessDAO is requested to deposit in the BANK/WETH 80/20 Polygon liquidity pool:\n\n4M BANK\n\n14 WETH\n\nBalancer will grant for the entire 2022 a weekly reward of 300 BAL (apx. 5k USD) for depositors. It means that if, for instance, BanklessDAO holds 50% of the liquidity in the pool, a revenue of 10k USD in BAL will be granted to the DAO treasury on a monthly basis (as 1200 BAL per month have a value of apx. 20k USD).\n\nAs consideration of the pool incentives, BanklessDAO will host BalancerDAO as the main sponsor on the “Weekly Roll-up” newsletter or the “State of the DAOs” newsletter for the entire 2022. The precise collocation of Balancer’s sponsorship will be determined on a seasonal basis.\n\n2. BalancerDAO’s grant for media coverage\n\nBalancerDAO would like to award to BanklessDAO a grant of 7k USD in BAL for:\n\nA medium post where the collaboration between Market and BanklessDAO will be announced (500 USD)\n\n2 medium articles, which will be tweeted 2 times by the BanklessDAO account and that will be mentioned in the weekly roll-up. (2,500 USD)\n\nArticle 1: The Multi-chain Strategy of Balancer\n\nArticle 2: The Creation of the Balancer DAO (with a short version in the State of the DAOs DAO Spotlight section)\n\nA Crypto-Sapiens Podcast where the founders will present the Balancer DAO (2,000 USDC)\n\nA strong marketing campaign concerning the liquidity pools (4 tweets with graphics prepared by designers) (1,000 USD)\n\n1,000 USD for the project champions\n\n**FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS**\n\nIn order to get the pool incentives on a yearly basis, BanklessDAO is requested to deposit in the BANK/WETH 80/20 Polygon liquidity pool:\n\n4M BANK\n\n14 WETH\n\n:warning: Funding should be provided by the BanklessDAO treasury\n\nAs to the media coverage, Balancer will cover the entire costs.\n\n**BRAND USAGE**\n\nEvery published item will present BalancerDAO and BanklessDAO logos together.\n\n**SUCCESS METRICS OR KPIS**\n\nSuccess will be evaluated from the number of views of the articles, the likes of the tweets and from the number of the participants at the podcast and at the workshop.\n\nMoreover, Balancer will also evaluate whether the media coverage has brought an increment in the usage of the BANK/WETH liquidity pools.\n\n**NEXT STEPS**\n\nThe proposal requires a snapshot vote.\n\nIn case of approval, the champion of the proposal will organize the teams to cover the planned work.\n\nWriters’ Guild Client Services will organize the written content and the publication on Medium. BalancerDAO’s founders will be put in contact with representatives of Crypto-Sapiens in order to organize the podcast.\n\n**SQUAD BACKGROUND**\n\n@Eagle is the Legal Guild Coordinator and member of the Grants Committee. He is a Law Professor and Lawyer interested in blockchain technology, DAO governance and DeFi\n\n@Grendel is the Translator Guild Coordinator and member of the Grants Committee. He is a IT entrepreneur who designs and implements fungible and non-fungible tokenization blockchain projects.\n\n@andrea Balancer is a Balancer core contributor and marketing strategist\n\n@siddhearta is the Bankless DAO Newsletter Coordinator.\n",

      "content": "Title: Governance Solutions Engineer Program\nAuthors: frogmonkee#6855\nDate Created: December 16th, 2021\nDate Posted: January 20th, 2022\nForum proposals: [[Draft 1](https://forum.bankless.community/t/draft-1-governance-solutions-engineer-program/2484)] [[Draft 2](https://forum.bankless.community/t/draft-2-governance-solutions-engineer-program/2663)]\nQuorum Requirement: 36.84M BANK\nVoting Threshold: 77.64%\n\n> ⚠️Once you have voted on this proposal, please click this [link](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/0x33f869377c1b93a3b6db367001b6bb2604626f919ca4322960a20b8f01f58860) and elect the 5 GSEs for this program.\n\n# SUMMARY\n\nThis proposal, seeks to activate groups of people to address two important challenges for the DAO:\n\n* Contributor Incentives\n* Strategic Prioritization\n\nIt outlines the need for these two problem spaces to have a dedicated team responsible for designing scalable solutions that align with the community’s sentiment.\n\nDeliverables are defined as a thorough and community-aligned specification in order to update our governance procedures and create room for growth. A close comparable is the original [Season Specification ](https://forum.bankless.community/t/draft1-banklessdao-season-1-proposal/904) that continues to act as an important cornerstone in our governance model.\n\nAs such, this proposal calls for:\n\n* Five elected members of the DAO to lead these two problem spaces, known as Governance Solutions Engineers (GSEs). Each GSE will be granted 75,000 BANK as an initial allocation in Season 3 (375K total). At the end of the Season, when deliverables are presented to the DAO, the DAO will vote on whether to apply a bonus of up to 750,000 BANK.\n* 500,000 BANK set aside for each problem space to incentivize participation in working groups, led by the five elected members (1M total). This would be allocated to the working group and distributed as per the group’s decision, *not* at the GSE’s discretion.\n\n# BACKGROUND\n\nWhen building an organization, there’s this mental model of working *in* the organization vs working *on* the organization. I highlighted this distinction in [Onwards to Season 3!](https://forum.bankless.community/t/onwards-to-season-3/2354#season-3-revenge-of-moloch-8) under the `Season 3: Revenge of Moloch` heading, so I’ll just quickly summarize here:\n\nAs organizations grow and scale, their underlying operational model must change too. As new organizational behavior and information arise, systems must adapt and modify. Our current operational model - grants, guilds, projects, proposals, compensation - was largely ideated between May 4th and June 8th.\n\nSix months in, we’re seeing where the existing operational model is insufficient:\n\n* In Season 2, the Grants Committee ran out of funding with a month left in the Season, despite increasing the budget by an additional 40% from Season 1\n* Projects have come back for funding without a clear way to evaluate whether these projects should be funded a second or third time.\n* Community voting does not reflect critical evaluation. We largely vote yes without taking the time to evaluate the full scope of a proposal.\n* (Related to above) People do not have the bandwidth to participate in proposal discussion\n* Grants Committee sometimes does not have sufficient subject matter expertise to evaluate project scope (namely developer projects)\n* We have no way to evaluate the value that a project brings do the DAO when coming back for funding\n* Compensation was set at 1000 BANK/hr, back when BANK average 5 cents per token. Today, we sit at 15.\n* Compensation varies heavily in the DAO between standard roles like Talent Scout, Guild Coordinator, Secretary, etc.\n* L2 contributor status doesn’t accommodate for Guest Pass members that have shown themselves worthy of L2 status.\n\nThe points above reflect challenges that come from outgrowing our current framework.\n\nI see the problems broken down into two main categories:\n * **Contributor Alignment** - How do we properly reward active DAO contributors, accounting for the varying skillsets and time commitment people are making?\n* **Strategic Prioritization** - What should we say no to? How do we, as a DAO, learn how to say no?  How do we do this in a way that empowers the community to make decisions while also letting high-context individuals influence outcomes?  \n\nMy point here is that, in Season 0, we directed our attention in working *on* the organization and building systems/processes. In Season 1 and Season 2, all those same people worked *in* the organization. Now, we have new information and behavior that are forcing us to re-evaluate those systems/processes that we built.\n\nNow you may stop and say, “Well okay, why don’t we just spin up a working group in this…? Let’s just find a bunch of people interested in solving these problems and let’s get on with it!” Good question! **I tried.** Nearly 3 months ago, I created this forum post: [ALL HANDS ON DECK: Compensation and PLM Working Groups ](https://forum.bankless.community/t/all-hands-on-deck-compensation-and-plm-working-groups/1932). In it, I called for a group of interested parties to help scope out our inadequate compensation guidance. The result? Despite having 15 people [signal their interest ](https://lettucemeet.com/l/BENKv), we only met [three times](https://www.notion.so/bankless/Projects-9e37997f29fa4df2b8b4e4284709403a) and we delivered on this flimsy [forum post ](https://forum.bankless.community/t/compensation-at-banklessdao/2272).\n\nI see this failure resulting from two factors:\n\n1. Our working group did not have explicit signaling from the DAO that this was a major priority. We’re all fucking busy in our respective niches. Without an explicit mandate from the DAO saying “This is important, we need people on this project,” it’s really difficult to activate people to redirect their resources and attention on this matter.\n2. I did not have the time and bandwidth to lead this working group. I was active in a number of different places in the DAO, and without some social signal and explicitly incentivization, it eventually fell down my priority list.\n\nGiven my experience here, I want to propose a new model - One that creates an explicit mandate from the DAO to focus on these two problem areas and properly incentivizes participation.\n\nLadies, Gentlemen, and non-binaries, I’d like to introduce the *Governance Solutions Engineer Program*\n\n# MISSION & VALUES ALIGNMENT\nI’m going to be lazy here, but in the [Onwards to Season 3!](https://forum.bankless.community/t/onwards-to-season-3/2354#season-3-revenge-of-moloch-8) forum post, I did a quick temp check on this topic with overwhelming support of a focus on Governance and Coordination.\n# SPECIFICATION\n\n## What are GSEs?\n\nIn the failures section just above, I pointed out how I did not have the bandwidth to coordinate/lead the Compensation working group. As such, the working group ended up falling to the wayside on my list of priorities.\n\nGiven this outcome, I think it’s important to explicitly assign coordinator responsibility. We need people who view it as their #1 priority to *lead* these working groups. As such, I define GSEs as:\n\n* Governance-minded DAO members elected to spec out a comprehensive solution to mission-critical DAO infrastructure challenges.\n* These members are *not* to operate in silos and make decisions on behalf of the DAO. They are to work *with* the DAO to find the optimal solution by progressively designing solutions, presenting them to the DAO, capturing feedback, and iterating.\n* GSEs have appropriate context for the problems they are working on and properly embody the values of the DAO. They are *trusted by their social reputation for acting in the best interest in the DAO.*\n* GSEs *must* make this their #1 priority. Given the scope of activity in the DAO, many qualified members hold multiple other positions. Instead of requiring that GSE only hold one other role, max, any member can apply but must disclose their other responsibilities, both in the DAO and IRL (ie if they have a job). In this way, the DAO can decide if they feel people have the appropriate bandwidth. (The change from 3 to 5 GSEs from Draft1 and the modified comp model allow for some flexibility for GSEs that have additional responsibilities.) Additionally, once elected, members may not accept any additional roles.\n  * For example, if I applied, I would disclose my role as Ops Guild coordinator and part time editor for BanklessHQ.\n  * They may participate in lower order activities. Eg, if I wanted to write a piece of the Newsletter, I can do that. But I cannot accept a role on the newsletter team.\n  * Gov SEs *can* be on the Grants Committee, but must disclose\n\nA successful Gov SE program should result in major clout for Gov SEs in the DAO. At the risk of sounding vain… what if there were more frogmonkees? Ooh ooh aah aah motherfucker.\n\n## What is the Scope of Work?\n\n> Expected 25-30 hours per week for each GSE. Plan accordingly.\n\nRight now, I think the scope of work should be limited to our most existential threats: (1) Contributor Alignment and (2) Strategic Prioritization. We do have other important challenges that we can expect down the pipeline, but given this is the first time testing a program like this, I would caution against taking on more we can chew without testing this first.\n\n**Deliverables**\n Deliverables would include a detailed specification that we can begin to implement in Season 4. The closest comparable is the original [Season Specification ](https://forum.bankless.community/t/draft1-banklessdao-season-1-proposal/904) that still serves as an important guiding document for the DAO to this day.\n\nThis deliverable would have to be in its final form, if not extremely close. The idea is to have something we can implement by the end of Season 3 going into Season 4. As such, community feedback must already be included. I want to acknowledge that this community feedback can take time *but* if `Draft 1` is done properly, much of the community consensus will already be aligned.\n\n**Contributor Alignment**\n* Refining the Guest Pass, L1, and L2 system to be more inclusive\n  * Includes ways to offboard contributors that no longer meet the activity/recognition threshold\n* Create a compensation framework that can be updated and:\n  * Define [global compensation](https://forum.bankless.community/t/compensation-at-banklessdao/2272#compensation-guidelines-4) that standardizes compensation rules for the entire DAO\n  * Provides guidance on letting projects/guild define [local compensation](https://forum.bankless.community/t/compensation-at-banklessdao/2272#compensation-guidelines-4).\n* Envisions a new incentive model that rewards long-term contributors that stick with the DAO for longer periods of time.\n* Work with guilds to standardize guild roles and Coordinape rounds\n* Work with guild Talent Scouts and First Quest to identify challenges and better retain talent entering DAO\n\n**Strategic Prioritization**\n* Model and present various strategic directions the DAO can take (present to DAO for feedback)\n  * Eg. DAO incubator model vs. [software profit model](https://discord.com/channels/834499078434979890/842810844236742677/926525644576284804) vs Emergent Strategy\n* Outline a business plan based on an identified strategic model\n* Create an evaluation framework based on the identified strategy to help the DAO make strategic decisions with treasury and grant funding\n* Create a new evaluation *process* that optimizes for both community consensus and responsible decision making (will likely deprecate the Grants Committee as it stands)\n* Design a system that actually measures the output of funded projects and incorporates those findings into the evaluation process\n* Balancing funding cost centers with things that generate revenue or token appreciation\n\n## Gov SEs and Working Groups\n\nEarlier, I said about Gov SEs:\n\n> These members are *not* to operate in silos and make decisions on behalf of the DAO. They are to work *with* the DAO to find the optimal solution by progressively designing solutions, presenting them to the DAO, capturing feedback, and iterating.\n\nOne method of working with the DAO is to create a working group around these two problem spaces. As such, Gov SEs will have to work publicly in these working group. Part of their responsibility will be coordinating these working groups, somewhere between a Guild Coordinator and Project Manager.\n\n## Elections\n[Elections are live.](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/0x33f869377c1b93a3b6db367001b6bb2604626f919ca4322960a20b8f01f58860)\n\n\n\n# FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS\n\nMaximum funding for this initiative would be: 2,125,000 BANK and come from the main treasury. Any BANK unallocated will go back to the treasury at the end of this program. Funding will come from the BanklessDAO treasury and must follow the framework presented [in this snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/0x0eb29303825c37c67ddc5d71b199bbc66c149712918c2a7c9261c7f6a2953d66).\n\n**2,125,000 BANK is broken down as:**\n\n* Each Gov SE would be guaranteed 75,000 BANK salary\n* At the end Season 3, the DAO will vote on two deliverables produced by the GSEs via forum vote. One for strategic prioritization and one for contributor Alignment. Each deliverable will be rated on a scale of 1 to 5, which will unlock additional compensation.\n  *  Each deliverable will unlock a maximum of 375K BANK, for a total of 750K. \n  * Each rating will unlock 75K in funding. 1 = 75K, 2 = 150K, 3 = 225K, 4 = 300K, 5 = 375K\n  * Additional compensation is *only* for GSEs. Distribution will be up to the 5 GSEs. They can choose to use Team Set Salaries or Coordinape.\n* The two working groups (for each problem space) will have an allocated budget of 500,000 BANK to collectively decide how to allocate and compensate members of the working group. Gov SEs may not draw from this allocation.\n* Funds will be held in a multi-sig held by the 5 GSEs\n  * Once all compensation has been distributed, GSEs must produce a financial report outlining how funds were distributed.\n  * Any funds not distributed will be returned to the treasury\n\n# SUCCESS METRICS OR KPIS\nDelivery of two detailed specifications by the end of Season 3 that already has community feedback folded into in order to execute and implement during Season 4.\n",

      "title": "Season 3 Grants Committee Elections",
      "content": "Title: Season 3 Grants Committee Elections\nProposal Champion: Icedcool#4947\nDate: January 4th, 2021\n[Forum proposal](https://forum.bankless.community/t/season-3-grants-committee-submissions/2345)\n\n> This snapshot was re-uploaded with the BPT token strategy, allowing for BANK holders to vote with tokens held in [Balancer's liquidity pools](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x87165b659ba7746907a48763063efa3b323c2b0700020000000000000000002d).\n\n# SUMMARY\nAccording to the [Season 3 specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VyNIjq85ORqeeUJkzNhx0lk6_06qrH0GIK0qZ8coqhA/edit#heading=h.5uor07hvudm9), there will be 4 seats up for election for Season 3 Grants Committee.\n\n**The Grants Committee consists of 5-7 members along with a multisig with all committee members as signers.**\n* The Committee is responsible and accountable for managing the grants system, reviewing grant applications, and managing the grants treasury, with the help of other guilds as needed (e.g., treasury).\n* The Committee has a quorum with four members over seven OR three members over five, but is otherwise responsible for their own operations.\n* The Committee cannot change the application process to be a Committee member without a snapshot vote and is encouraged to accept the DAO’s proposal template.\n* The Grants Committee is required to be transparent and communicative with the DAO, such as access to Committee meetings and an opportunity to voice opinions and feedback.\n\n**The voting period will last one week and will take place on Snapshot:**\n* Grants Committee Applications will be submitted and decided on by a weighted snapshot vote, and the highest 4 voted applications will be elected into the Grants Committee.\n* Any unapproved candidate can gather feedback, improve their resume, and resubmit for future vacancies.\n* Committee members can be recalled with an instant vote of 51% or more. Committee members may leave the Committee at any time by submitting a written resignation note to the Committee.\n\n# APPLICANTS\n### Icedcool#4947\n**Reason for (re)applying**\nMy aim continues to be to support the DAO’s operations, and as a representative of the #dev-guild. I plan to continue to develop the strategies around how the DAO and Grants Committee can distribute funding that supports the DAO, projects and contributors in an equitable manner that supports the long term viability of all three.\n\n**Describe your involvement thus far at BanklessDAO**\nI am heavily involved in the #dev-guild and a huge cheerleader of the #analytics-guild. I am also the PM on the Bounty Board project, and am working to support it as it as it grows and develops to be a major DAO tooling component. Lastly, I am working in tokenomics to increase the utility and opportunities around the $BANK.\n\nMy overall aims are to support DAO operations, drive opportunities and $BANK valuation that allow members to work for the DAO.\n\n**Qualifications - What will you bring to the committee?**\nI aim to bring a balanced, principled and as unbiased an opinion as possible, with an intent to support the DAO’s success in all endeavors, focused on tech, economics, and equity.\n\nI have been part of the Grants Committee since genesis, and aim to bring my learnings to continue to iterate and improve on the service and quality of the Grants Committee.\n\n**Sponsor(s)**\n@jameswmontgomery.eth, @frogmonkee, @Eagle, @nonsensetwice, @Grendel\n\n### Kouros#2107\n**Reason for applying**\nThe projects in Bankless DAO make the organisation thrive and move forward. It is important that we distribute the funds across the DAO and keep the machine working at a good speed. It is for this reason that I would like to keep assessing and advising projects for the benefit of all of us.\n\n**Describe your involvement thus far at BanklessDAO**\nMy involvement with Bankless DAO started in the very first days when the DAO was created, and I have seen the DAO and myself progressing in this space to a great degree and I would like to continue growing together.\n\nIn addition to this, I have been overseeing the Treasury Guild since Season 0 and organising and actioning NFT sales successfully on behalf of the DAO as well as being part of the Grants Committee since its origins so I believe all this experience and knowledge about the DAO will make me an excellent candidate to continue as member of the Grants Committee.\n\n**Qualifications - What will you bring to the committee?**\nHaving studied maths has giving me an analytical mind that likes solving problems and always eager to learn new things. I believe this is important when reviewing projects.\n\n**Sponsors**\n@Icedcool @Eagle @nonsensetwice @Grendel @AboveAverageJoe\n\n### Grendel#3875\n**Reason for applying**\nI am and I feel very involved in BanklessDAO, I strongly believe in its educational, informative and support mission to all those who want to build something in the crypto ecosystem, defi, dao, nft.\n\nThe development and implementation of individual or team projects supported emotionally and financially by the DAO is one of the end points of this process of empowering community members.\n\nI wish I could continue my work on the grants committee to be able to support this process which is made up of both support and constructive criticism. Constructive criticism serves to ensure that BanklessDAO is not a sandbox for community projects but a place to learn and fulfill oneself.\n\n**Qualifications - What will you bring to the committee?**\nI am involved in project management tasks and have been actively involved in many crypto projects for several years. I think I can put my experience to good use by putting it at the service of BanklessDAO and the grants committee.\n\n**Sponsors**\n@Eagle, @Kouros, @Icedcool, @AboveAverageJoe, @siddhearta, @sovereignhealth, @AyrtonB26\n\n### LiveTheLifeTV (⚓, ⚓)#5415 \n**Reason for applying**\nI would love to keep supporting new initiatives at Bankless DAO. I plan to step down from the bankless dao website and bankless loans to focus on a potential new role at the Grants Committee.\n\n**Describe your involvement thus far at BanklessDAO**\nI have been around since day one and enjoyed kickstarting many initiatives, including being the project champion for the bDAO website and the Bankless Loans project, both projects now have new people stepping up and I feel confident that it’s time to explore this role at the GC to review new projects and stay involved at the DAO. Helping to fix the issue of the token liquidity by onboarding bDAO on the Olympus Pro feels like my most impactful contribution so far.\n\n**Qualifications - What will you bring to the committee?**\nMy deep interest in Defi, DAO’s, and NFT’s has only increased the past few 5 years. I love supporting and reviewing new initiatives and feel like my passion to keep pushing the space will be a good fit.\n\n**Sponsor(s)**\n@Eagle, @Kouros , @Grendel\n\n### Soundman#6783\n**Reason for Applying:**\nMy reason for applying to the grants commitee is that I think I can help add clarity around compensation in projects. Having been involved with the DAO from its inception I have a good perspective on where the DAO is currently, how it got here and where we are trying to go. I believe that compensation on projects needs to have some definition from inception not necessarily a detailed plan but a roadmap for how you will get to a detailed plan. Compensation in the form of roles, bounties, coordinape rounds or other means should be clear to everyone involved setting expectations is key. My primary goal if I were elected to grants commitee is making sure the people involved in a project all have an understanding of what compensation looks like at the moment of deciding to fund it as well as if there is a plan to define forms of compensation for the longterm.\n\n**My qualifications:**\nI am aligned with the BanklessDAO mission and will use our mission statement as a guide in my decisions. I am a champion for the podcast hatchery so I know what it takes to make a project and even more importantly I know the challenges involved.\n\n**Sponsors:**\nEurekajohn#2094, Droste#0063, ivan7538#4763\n\n### chuck25#4313\n**Reason for applying**\nI am a major proponent for BanklessDAO’s mission to onboard new people into crypto, and it would be an honor to help steer funding decisions for the DAO’s next chapter of development.\n\nI am a living embodiment of this community’s mission to provide an on-ramp for professionals who want to leave their boring legacy world jobs behind and help build the future.\n\nFinding BanklessDAO in early November 2021 was, I imagine, like arriving at Ellis Island in the late 1800s. BanklessDAO welcomed my tired self yearning to be free and told me to go find work! The decentralized, permissionless nature of the DAO empowered me to begin contributing almost immediately to the incubation of Bankless Consulting, which was born with an award from the Grants Committee just as I arrived. Helping to build the world’s first decentralized, web3 consultancy has been a thrill. My wife says she has never seen me this motivated to sit in front of a computer screen late into the night.\n\nAs I pivot my career into working in web3 full-time in 2022, I would like to play a bigger role in helping BanklessDAO fulfill its mission as we elevate our work and become an even more impactful community within the web3 ecosystem.\n\n**Qualifications**\n\n* IRL work | 10+ years of nonprofit management experience geared towards helping others reach their full potential. Have worked at two private foundations and one public foundation making grants for public impact. Have been a member of several boards and grants committees. Have built multiple education nonprofits that relied on grant funding and have also built a nonprofit education business fully sustained by earned revenue. Currently directing the nonprofit management graduate program at a university in the United States.\n* Studies | Bachelor’s in Economics with specialization in economic policy and Master’s in Public Policy with specializations in philanthropy and nonprofit leadership. Currently devoting at least two hours a day to reading, listening to podcasts, and watching videos to learn more and more about web3.\n* BanklessDAO | Joined BanklessDAO in early November 2021 and will earn my way to L1 status (35,000 BANK) before the end of Season 2. Have led the Compensation Working Group for Bankless Consulting to meet both of our key milestones for Season 2. Have also been a core member of the Governance Working Group for Bankless Consulting, helping to build the Governance Framework for the world’s first web3-native, decentralized consultancy.\n\n**Sponsor(s)**\n@RunTheJewelz @Icedcool @omen @dside @MC10\n\n# POLL\nThis poll uses the \"[Weighted Voting](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types#weighted-voting)\" mechanic:\n> Each voter may spread voting power across any number of choices.\n\nPlease use your tokens to weigh which applicants you would like to see elected. Of the applications, the four with the highest weighted votes will be elected to the Grants Committee in Season 3.",

      "title": "Execute swap with Tokemak for BANK reactor ignition",
      "content": "**Title: BanklessDAO <> Tokemak**\n**Proposal Champion: Icedcool#4947**\n**Date: October 21st, 2021**\n**[Forum proposal](https://forum.bankless.community/t/proposal-banklessdao-tokemak/1963)**\n# Summary\nBanklessDAO has challenges with the $BANK token of liquidity depth and deployment. Right now we have fractionalized liquidity across Uniswap, Sushiswap, and Balancer.\n\nInsufficient liquidity results in poor pricing and volatility. This negatively impacts exchanges looking to offer the best possible pricing for the token, and the individual, hoping to avoid slippage due to the price impact of their trade. Additionally, in the future BanklessDAO interacting with other projects’ tokens require reliable liquidity.\n\nAs BanklessDAO grows we need to continue to address the issue of liquidity.\n\nThrough Tokemak we can solve that problem and deploy liquidity quickly and effectively using the platform.\n\nThe integration of BanklessDAO and Tokemak, would enable the quick and efficient deployment of liquidity, create a token swap opportunity for the DAO to be exposed to the valuation of TOKE, as well as give BANK holders a novel opportunity to single sided stake their bank on the TOKEMAK platform, enabling further liquidity for the BANK token.\n# BACKGROUND\nThe current state of DeFi is comprised of fragmented, unpredictable, and expensively sourced liquidity. Providing 50/50 paired liquidity is expensive for an individual, and has the looming risk of impermanent loss. Traditional market making solutions are opaque for native DeFi builders, highly centralized, and expensive. Finally, reliance upon whales to provide liquidity results in a perpetual state of uncertainty.\n\nTokemak enables users to both provide liquidity and control where that liquidity goes.\n\nLiquidity Providers deposit single-sided assets into individual Token Reactors and/or Genesis Pools (ETH, USDC), and earn yield in the form of TOKE, Tokemak’s native protocol token.\n\nLiquidity Directors stake TOKE into individual Token Reactors and vote how that liquidity gets paired from the Genesis Pools and to what exchange venue it gets directed. They too earn yield in the form of TOKE.\n\nTOKE can be thought of as generalized or tokenized liquidity. TOKE holders are able to generate liquidity on demand for whatever tokens they want, on whatever exchange they want, by controlling and directing Tokemak’s TVL. This is done through single sided staking on their platform of the token (BANK) then directing liquidity with TOKE via their front end.\n\nTokemak has several different mechanics and guardrails in place to mitigate IL risk to ensure that Liquidity Providers can always claim their underlying assets deposited, 1:1. These mechanics involve some risk to TOKE stakers, but only as a last resort.\n\nThe protocol captures fees from providing liquidity across DeFi. Over time, this will allow Tokemak to build a strong reserve of various assets in Tokemak’s PCA (Protocol Controlled Assets). In the end, the PCA is controlled by TOKE holders through decentralized governance.\n\nIt offers opportunities for exchanges to reinforce their liquidity and for market makers to leverage the PCA to create deep liquidity for a specific project.\n# MISSION & VALUES ALIGNMENT\nTokemak provides invaluable infrastructure for BanklessDAO as it grows and migrates from L1 to L2’s. The support that the platform would provide for liquidity to the BANK token, would enable the tokens use both internally to the DAO, and externally as other platforms begin to integrate with BanklessDAO.\n\nWith the Tokemak platform managing the liquidity for BanklessDAO, the DAO can focus on onboarding 1 billion people into crypto without having to worry about the liquidity of the token.\n# SPECIFICATION\n* $3,000,000 in notional value, swapped in BANK for TOKE(details below)\n* Kick off a token swap with a 30-day moving average for BANK and TOKE\n# FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS\nTo kickstart a Tokemak Reactor, BanklessDAO will need to do a token swap of $3,000,000 in notional value of BANK for TOKE. This will be a backing for the platform to minimize slippage and risk to single sided BANK stakers.\n# SUCCESS METRICS OR KPIS\n* Deep Liquidity in the chosen AMM of BanklessDAO\n* Ability to quickly deploy to different AMM’s, and later L2’s.\n* No or low slippage for trades (buy or sells)\n* Staking opportunity for BanklessDAO members(BANK holders)\n  * Treasuries (DAO, and GUILDS) and BANK holders could stake BANK for TOKE rewards\n* Increased treasury value from token swap (TOKE)\n  * BanklessDAO would gain exposure to the TOKE token value, and if the platform does well and accrues value, the valuation of TOKE would increase.\n# POLL\nExecute swap with Tokemak for BANK reactor ignition - dependent upon C.O.R.E voting results.",

      "content": "Author: LiveTheLifeTV#5415\n# Summary\nImplement a bond program for the Bankless DAO to own its own liquidity. Protocol-owned-liquidity is the future of liquidity incentive programs. By implementing a bond program for BANK-ETH liquidity, bDAO can distribute its governance tokens to more users while also accumulating its own liquidity.\n\nThe proposed bond program would sell BANK at a discount in exchange for BANK/ETH LP tokens. The discount rate on bonds is achieved by a novel pricing mechanism that allows the market to set the discount. Basically, bond prices are decreased until a bond is purchased which then pushes up the price of the next bond.\n# BACKGROUND\nOlympus is offering to provide its expertise in bond contract management to support other DAOs interested in owning their own liquidity. This will include providing the UI for bonds and maintaining bond control variables to balance emissions with liquidity accumulation. In exchange for the implementation and community engagement, Olympus would take a 3.3% on all BANK bonds sold. Olympus will use the BANK earned as backing for the intrinsic value of OHM, which would act as a supply sink for BANK. BANK bonds would be offered with a week-long vesting period, which helps prevent immediate price impact from discounted tokens. This aligns the goals of the protocol with those of bond participants. Typically, higher bond volume is seen when users expect the price of the token to increase during the vesting period.\nhttps://www.olympusdao.finance/\nhttps://docs.olympusdao.finance/pro/\n# MISSION & VALUES ALIGNMENT\nOlympus has spent months studying and perfecting its own bonds. Their valuable insight will help bDAO get passive, self-regulating bond programs up and running. Bankless DAO will be featured on Olympus Pro X, a unified marketplace for bonds from a multitude of protocols. The marketplace will become the default destination for DeFi investors looking for discounted exposure to various tokens through this unique mechanism. A presence on this interface will be invaluable in reaching new investors, much like the value of listing on an exchange.\n# SPECIFICATION\n\n“The goal should always be to bootstrap and accrue long-term defensible value, rather than perpetually pay high interest on mercenary capital” — OlympusDao\n\nMore details: https://olympusdao.medium.com/introducing-olympus-pro-d8db3052fca5 \n# FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS\n\nAllocate 5M BANK per month to target $3M of liquidity over the next six months. If we allocate 30M BANK out of 1B we dedicate 3% of total supply to fix our biggest pain point, low liquidity. And we will increase our onchain revenue by earning fees as the owner of our own liquidity.\n\n# SUCCESS METRICS OR KPIS\n\n• Discount rate < 10% on bonded BANK\n\n• Minimal impact on BANK price\n\n• Permanent liquidity source\n\n• Increased treasury value from liquidity that also earns trading fees\n\n• Exposure to paired asset in liquidity pool (ETH)\n\n• bDAO can stake its LP tokens to provide additional runway",

      "content": "Author: Icedcool#4947, Kouros#2107\n\n# SUMMARY\n\nThe Balancer Liquidity Mining Program has received thorough forum [soft consensus](https://forum.bankless.community/t/launch-bank-liquidity-mining-on-the-80-bank-20-weth-balancer-pool/1337) and a proposal to fund and kick off the initiative was created and submitted to the Grants Committee.\n\nThe Grants Committee attempted to vote on the [Balancer Liquidity Mining Program](https://www.notion.so/bankless/Balancer-Liquidity-Mining-Program-50b91d8eee2a47a5920597cca80c0613), although five of seven grants committee members are involved with the proposal, and voting on it would generate a conflict of interest.\n\nAs such the proposal must go to snapshot for wider approval of the DAO.\n\n# Proposal Details:\n\nAuthors: Eagle, Grendel, GavWan, AboveAverageJoe, LuukDAO, davoice321, 0x_Lucas, Kouros\n\nChampion: Eagle_lex Bartolus\n\nDate: October 12th, 2021\n\n## SUMMARY\n\nIn partnership with Balancer, Bankless DAO is looking to launch a dual liquidity mining program on the[ Balancer 80/20 BANK ETH Pool](https://www.notion.so/Balancer-Liquidity-Mining-Program-50b91d8eee2a47a5920597cca80c0613).\n\nThis proposal requests a Season 2 grant of 1,020,000 BANK as incentives for this program. The Balancer Liquidity Mining Committee plans to match our allocation with 480 BAL/week over the same time period.\n\n## BACKGROUND\n\nBankless DAO is strongly committed in its educational purposes and considers Balancer one of the most innovative and reliable DeFi protocols. Some members of the Bankless DAO outbound-grant squad therefore decided to apply for a[ Balancer grant](https://balancer.community/balancer-community-grants).\n\nBalancer has approved a[ grant proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K7OQFeZoJZdYjXnVMA0uhjcjcSifjGiZKi5SdQbwTr8/edit) presented by[ @eagle](https://forum.bankless.community/u/eagle) and[ @grendel](https://forum.bankless.community/u/grendel) for up to 10k USD to be paid in BAL + some incentives for a liquidity mining program. We've completed the initial grant and are now prepared for the incentives for the LM program.\n\nGenerally speaking, this program should aid in our liquidity issue while providing a token economic boost for the community. With Season 2, members can retain access with BPT tokens. Additionally, we can add the BPT tokens as voting power on Snapshot.\n\n## MISSION & VALUES ALIGNMENT\n\nThe mission and values of Balancer are aligned with what Bankless DAO considers fundamental in guiding people towards an economically more inclusive and independent life.\n\n## SPECIFICATION\n\nDistribute 85,000 BANK per week over 12 weeks via the Balancer Liquidity Mining program. In total, this equates to 1,020,000 BANK which will last for the entirety of Season 2 and some time in Season 3.\n\nThe program will start on October 25th, 2021 and end on January 17th, 2022.\n\nThe Balancer team will create a frontend UI for us to distribute the rewards on a weekly basis, claimable on Ethereum mainnet.\n\n## FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS\n\nThe total expected distribution will entail 1,020,000 BANK for this 12-week program.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS OR KPIS\n\nThe aim of the campaign is to mitigate the liquidity issue and provide a moderate utility boost to BANK.\n\nThe target APY for the Balancer pool would be around 25% which equates to $4.5M in total liquidity when factoring the BAL matching rewards.\n",

They are not in the ideation phase with loose expectations.\"\n\nAs requiring the projects to have been funded by the Grants Committee previously, and defer funding of the projects that haven’t previously been funded till after Season 2 commencement, as well paying from the Grants Committee fund. (Read in detail [here](https://forum.bankless.community/t/grants-committee-meeting-season-2-funding-meeting-9-29-21/1807))\n\nThis put the project funding request at 3,689,000 BANK, which left 1,311,000 BANK in the budget.\n\nIn order to account for the additional funding request needs, the Grants Committee would like the approval of the DAO to roll the 1,311,000 BANK not used in the Project Fund into the Grants Committee Fund, to be validated via snapshot and disbursed from the BanklessDAO Multisig.\n\nThis funding will go towards funding the deferred guild and projects described above.\n\n# SPECIFICATION\n\n* Increase the BANK allocation to the GC multisig for Season 2 by 1,311,000 resulting in a new total allocation of 11,811,000 BANK\n\n### Guild Funding = 4,954,403 BANK\n* [Legal Guild](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x984eC14dc726B75cA3eb6A94C64D165D37EA823e/settings) = 288,000 BANK\n* [Writers Guild](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xe7636c7ef670a3Bcf772D9d57244c9e88aD90437) = 302,000 BANK\n* [Marketing Guild](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xE5a64FC0d3396D11EB63d728791577E254Ac18Ca) = 306,000 BANK\n* [Operations Guild](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x47F238eF7F6B9e4f8452d77228B101f7c0419733) = 520,000 BANK + 3 ETH\n* [Treasury Guild](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x31016FFCEBFf16C20E74A8610f1650DCB5c01Df3/settings) = 286,385 BANK\n* [DAOlationships](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xb40f4ce59dA4A0B6D10aE605E10FD4E6ca9Ed4Ae/balances) = 276,000 BANK\n* [Translators Guild](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x045a805c83c1D4C9E5a0bdcC5a27EFa73D2a3c0b/balances) = 434,000 BANK\n* [Education Guild](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xcF8422021b408B32983B525778CE45420715f094) = 735,000 BANK\n* [AV Guild](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xE2D721c126150BeEE3C56A1AD71A2E0E29A411F0) = 606,233\n* [Analytics Guild](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x28861eeec6ab073A36Cc299ef8186978893e21FF) = 592,400 BANK\n* [Design Guild](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x8a771e2874B1e8a38cb08eBCB6e1058d27Fa64c0/balances) = 490,000 BANK\n* [Research Guild](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x2b00Fdf9AadAFEe22Cf56eb59BA367f6aCD0ce10/) = 118,385 BANK\n\n### Project Funding = 3,689,000 BANK\n* [First Quest](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x53105aD20960A842e082c60ef243C8c3C49bf518/balances) = 461,000 BANK\n* [Bankless Academy](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xf80Cd14ec747b2AdF7B1A9911b38c65a885dAeeA/balances) = 1,340,000 BANK\n* [Bankless Loans](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x4Aad6d8D45ba9a906B3DbcD9ee6F4d42e8D4a6B1) = 194,000 BANK\n* [Website](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xca22f929Aa5DBe2db2d0305d31604FE0dfD386b5/balances) = 360,000 BANK\n* [DEGEN](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x735FF6F197B0dc18eBEE127DD918d2111Eaf8220/balances)  = 1,334,000 BANK\n",

However, the Grant Committee members are still not compensated for their input. This proposal seeks to change this, so the GC members are in line with other contributors in the DAO.\n\n# MOTIVATION\nThe members of the Grants Committee carry out their role with extreme respect for the decisions made by the members of the DAO and with a sense of responsibility towards the consequences that the decisions taken may have on the whole DAO both in the immediate present and in the future.\n\nThe role therefore includes different types of commitment:\n* Study of the projects\n* Evaluation of the pros and cons that the rest of the DAO can indicate\n* Decision on the submitted proposals\n\nThe Grants Committee has then the important task of distributing funds to projects that will have a positive impact in the overall performance of the DAO. It is for this reason that the members of this committee are kept engaged, committed and appropriately compensated to perform their tasks.\n\n# SPECIFICATION\nThe Grants Committee is looking for a compensation of 800,000 BANK for Season 1 and Season 2. This is 400,000 BANK per season and it is calculated as per the table below:\n* Grants Committee Review (5 members) at 50,000 BANK = 250,000 BANK\n* Grants Committee Leads (2 members) at 75,000 BANK = 150,000 BANK\n* Total BANK = 800,000 BANK\n\n### Payments\nPayment will be distributed at the end of each season in lump sum.\n\n# CONCLUSION\nDuring the current Season 1 it was decided to assign a certain amount of BANK tokens to members who covered a role in the guilds or in some projects, while failing to define the same for the Grant Committee. This compensation proposal for the members of the Grants Committee aims to resolve the current lack of assimilation of a committee member to a role played in the DAO.",

      "content": "\nBACKGROUND\n\nSince genesis, the Bankless DAO treasury multisig has been controlled by the genesis team. This is because the wallet had to be created before the DAO was launched and stabilized so that there would be a place to store the treasury.\n\nWe are now midway through season 1 and the DAO seems to have stabilized enough to allow ownership of the DAO treasury multisig from the genesis team to the DAO.\nMISSION & VALUES ALIGNMENT\n\nThis proposal would further decentralized the DAO by transferring ownership from a “centralized” genesis team to the DAO.\nSPECIFICATION\n\nTiming & Tenure\n\nOne month before the start of a season elections will be held to determine the multisig wallet holders for the upcoming season.\n\nEligibility\n\n    Any DAO member is eligible to apply.\n    There are no term limits.\n\nElection\n\n    A forum post will be made to General soliciting applications.\n\n    Applicants reply to the post with their application.\n\n    After 7 days, the application period closes. If there are not 7+ applicants, applications will remain open until 7+ applications are received.\n\n    A new post is then created for voting.\n\n    Voting lasts for 7 days. DAO members will be allowed to vote for 7 candidates.\n\n    The 7 applicants with the most votes are submitted to the DAO for approval via a snapshot vote\n\n    Voting lasts for 7 days and quorum is 20%+ of BANK\n\n    If the vote passes\n\n    New multisig wallet holders are added\n\n    Existing multisig wallet holders that will not be on it for the next season are removed\n\n    If the vote fails\n\n    Ops Guild gets feedback from the DAO and ensures the feedback is disseminated\n\n    The election process takes place again. Anyone is free to reuse an existing application\n\n    The existing multisig wallet holders remain until new holders are elected\n\nApplication\n\n    Discord handle\n    Reason for applying\n    Describe your involvement thus far at BanklessDAO\n    Qualifications - What will you bring to the committee?\n    How many hours can you commit to the DAO per week?\n    Sponsor(s) (i.e. people who will second your nomination. The more the better)\n\nRemoval of a Signer\n\n    If a multisig wallet holder becomes inactive or acts against the best interests of the DAO, they can be removed with a super-majority vote from the other multisig wallet holders\n\nSpecial Election\n\n    Multisig wallet holders can initiate a special election to fill any vacant seats, provide the special election would not overlap with the election for the next season.\n    Special Elections would follow the same process as season elections, except the election would be for the number of open seats and DAO members would get votes equal to the number of open seats.\n\nFINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS\n\n    The DAO will have to pay a transaction fee to update the signers.\n    The DAO members that have the authority to distribute treasury funds will change.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\n    Conduct election for new multisig owners\n    Update multisig\n",

      "content": "Authors: Above Average Joe, Kouros\nSummary:\n\nNotion subscription is being paid by the Defipedia earmarked account for the DAO, Initially self funded with $2500. Defipedia needed to pay employment taxes and the funds were taken from this account, therefore the last payment to Notion has not gone through.\n\nHereby, we are requesting 2,000 USDC from the DAO’s Treasury to refill this account and be able to pay for the Notion subscription. The price of the subscription varies each month depending on the new members added to the BanklessDAO Notion account. The failed payment for this month is for $249.07\n\nThe Notion subscription is paid in fiat so the Defipedia CEO (Above Average Joe) will need to exchange the USDC into USD to be able pay for it.\n\nAll transactions will be tracked and recorded accordingly.\n\nBackground:\n\nNotion is the main tool that the DAO has to store and organize information regarding the organization. We held all kind of information related to operations, projects, Guilds, bounties, governance and so on.\nBilling for notion is discounted 20% if membership is paid for up front on an annual basis. The first month's Bill was $480. The second was $740.38. \nThe workspace’s Team Plan is set to $1,536 per year with our current membership and will renew on May 18, 2022. Adjusted for our account balance, we will be charged $1,536.\nIt is therefore critical to maintain the Notion account if we want to preserve our efforts and successes of the past few months.\n In between this time new members are expected to join and need access, and these funds will be used for this, and any other fiat expenses the Dao needs to pay.\n\nSpecification:\n\nSend 2000 USDC to Defipedia.eth\n\nDeFipedia will send reports of account holdings to the treasury guild when the balance changes.\n",

Shortly afterwards, people started filing into voice channels to discuss, and the conversation went on for hours.\n\nThis conversation was fated to happen as soon as the DAO was created. For four weeks, community members have lifted the DAO and carried it step by step. As time went on, this enthusiasm turned into concern about sustainability. The market had taken a dump and the hours everyone was putting in netted zero income.\n\nFrom quiet whispers, Joe brought this topic in the limelight. We had a healthy discussion that reinforced the DAO’s ability to ideate and work through difficult problems as a collective.\n\n## MOTIVATION\nThe motivation of this specific proposal is to retroactively distribute $BANK to valuable community members from Season 0. Typically, companies don’t spend money they don’t have, and we fall squarely into that category. But, we need to give some reward, or we will inevitably lose talent that feels unappreciated.\n\nThat’s why, for Season 0 , we propose treating $BANK as equity and not a wage. \n\n## SPECIFICATION\n\nTo distribute $BANK, four questions came up as the most important:\n\n- Who will receive $BANK?\n- How much $BANK will they receive?\n- How will they receive $BANK?\n- When will they receive $BANK?\n- Who will receive $BANK?\n\nThis is the trickiest question, isn’t it? Ideally, we want to be as inclusive as possible, but also support informed decision making and not a popularity contest.\n\nThe solution here is an opt-in program for all members. Anyone is eligible for the round and may self-select by filling out this form: https://forms.gle/4yLDFcZvq2kcFJVw7\n\nAll members who fill out this form prior to the starting period will be eligible to participate in the round\n\n**How much $BANK will they receive?**\n\nCollectively, a pool of 1,000,000 $BANK will be allocated to Coordinape. \n\n** How will they receive $BANK?**\nUsing [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/). Coordinape is a P2P budget management tool that grew out of Yearn Finance. This is explained further below.\n\n**When will they receive $BANK?**\n\nOnce Coordinape is implemented, we will start a one week vote period with 1M $BANK, after which the funds will be proportionately distributed across participating DAO members based on the results from the Coordinape voting.\n\n**What is Coordinape?**\n\nCoordinape is central to this proposal. Coordinape was a project spun out from Yearn Finance  You can think of Coordinape as a peer to peer payroll management system. It’s broader than that, but for our purposes, it works. (For reference, Yearn’s governing DAO is a few steps ahead of BanklessDAO, but there are many parallels.)\n\nThe essence of Coordinape is allowing your peers to determine your earnings. The process works as such:\n- Each member is given 1000 GIVE tokens. Each token represents a proportional share of the salary pool (1M $BANK)\n- Members can gift (or not) GIVE tokens to people they think deserve some share of the pool.\n- After a voting period, all the unallocated GIVE tokens are burned. The remaining number of tokens represents a proportional piece of the salary pool, and members are programmatically paid their share based on the number of tokens they’ve received.\n\nThe simple premise is that if you ask everyone in the community who is doing good work, their collective answers will give a good sense of where the value is and who should be most rewarded. Over time, this also provides valuable insights for the DAO about what kinds of work is prioritized, what the community finds most valuable, and who are the key contributors in different areas.\n\nYou can learn more about Coordinape by reading their [Medium](https://medium.com/iearn/decentralized-payroll-management-for-daos-b2252160c543) announcement post, [Docs](https://docs.coordinape.com/), and [Youtube demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8oGun8EKDE).\n\n**How would this work?**\n\nLet’s tie all these topics back together. We’re proposing that:\n\n1. Using Coordinape, we will let DAO members vote on how 1M $BANK will be allocated to their peers\n2. Any DAO member that has at least 35K $BANK is eligible and can opt in with [this form](https://forms.gle/4yLDFcZvq2kcFJVw7) \n3. Over a one week period, we will all be able to claim their tokens and allocate them to any other DAO member\n4. After the voting period, the 1M $BANK will be distributed proportionally to the number of tokens they’ve received.\n5. Participants will fill out a survey evaluating their satisfaction with their payout.\n\nSuccess is defined as a >80% satisfaction rate.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Approve the proposal on Snapshot budget (1M BANK)\n2. Onboard to Coordinape\n3. Begin a one week voting period\n4. Distribute funds\n5. Take a survey\n\n## FAQ:\nHow do we know if this model will work?\n\nWe don’t. That’s part of the great blockchain experiment and why we're allocating a smaller amount of BANK to this program. It's meant to act as a trial! We’re inventing new ways to distribute money in a fairer manner. But both Sushiswap, Yearn and others use Coordinape, so there is some social proof. Internally, we will define success as a >80% satisfaction rate amongst participants.\n\nWhat about members that like to work solo?\n\nThese people will slip through the cracks. Right now, the community is small enough that we can recognize and vouch for these members. Also, Coordinape has a “regift” feature where members that were overcompensated can redistribute. This is not a great solution, but Coordinape is working on this problem.\n\n\n## Resources\n[Forum Post Draft](https://forum.bankless.community/t/draft1-rewarding-season-0-active-community-members/796)\n[Forum Post Final](https://forum.bankless.community/t/draft3-rewarding-season-0-active-community-members/825)\n",

      "title": "Badge Distribution for Second Airdrop",
      "content": "Authors: @lambda @EliteViking\nCollaborators: @0x_Lucas @0xHouston \nRead the Discord discussion: [Discord ](https://discord.com/channels/834499078434979890/839883260540747826/839883549720969236)\nDate: 5/7/2021\n\n## SUMMARY\n**There are two options under consideration for this proposal:**\n\n* Replace the current “unique emails seen” scheme for the premium subscriber airdrop of 87M BANK with an even distribution to **2021 Bankless Badge holders** as of 5/31/2021 at 11:59pm UTC.\n\n* Replace the current “unique emails seen” scheme for the premium subscriber airdrop of 87M BANK with an even distribution to **2020 and 2021 Bankless Badge holders** as of 5/31/2021 at 11:59pm UTC.\n\n## BACKGROUND\nWhile the initial airdrop was meant to reward those who took the initiative to claim their badges, we still want to recognize people who subscribed to Bankless, even if they forgot to claim. This is why the original email-based distribution scheme was proposed (pro rata amount based on “unique emails seen” per Substack).\n\nUnfortunately, the above approach has several shortcomings:\n\n1. Some of our community members utilize privacy software that blocks Substack’s ability to track newsletter engagement. This means their newsletter activity wouldn’t have been recorded and thus they would receive a disproportionately low/no allocation in the airdrop.\n\n2. Additionally, many Bankless fans prefer to listen to podcasts on YouTube, etc. and therefore their engagement wouldn’t be reflected in the airdrop.\n\n3. Lastly, Bankless DAO is currently looking for community members to perform outreach in order to collect ETH addresses for the second airdrop. In terms of privacy, this is inferior to badges in which the association of claim URL to ETH address is obfuscated by POAP, which doesn’t display the claim address for a particular link. The inferior privacy of email-based distribution leads to an inconvenient experience if users wish to return BANK to their primary wallet while preserving pseudonymity. Collecting addresses needlessly expends the labor of DAO participants that could go toward more productive activities.\n\n## MOTIVATION\nA badge-based scheme achieves a more equitable distribution of tokens since it doesn’t rely on inaccurate proxies for engagement. This aids in the credibility of the DAO in the eyes of its members and the general public. Given the Bankless ethos, we shouldn’t penalize users who take extra steps to protect their privacy online.\n\nMoreover, our DAO should be equally inclusive of those who have auditory learning styles instead of biasing toward those who prefer to read.\n\nDue to the superior privacy and accuracy of the badge-based distribution mechanism, it is inherently credibly neutral and decentralized. It’s not enough to evangelize the virtues of decentralization as a DAO; we must embody them as well.\n\n## SPECIFICATION\n\n### 2021-Only Distribution\n\n* On 5/31/2021 at 11:59pm UTC, a snapshot will be taken of all addresses on ETH and xDAI that hold the **2021 Bankless Badge POAP**.\n* For each address, a count of the total number of badges held by that address will be computed.\n* The total number of badges held across all addresses will be summed.\n* The share of BANK to be allocated in the airdrop will be divided equally amongst all addresses according to the following formula:\n\nBANK claim = (87M BANK / Total # of badges) \n\n* BANK not claimed within 90 days of claims going live will be surrendered back to the community treasury.\n* The snapshot for 2021 Badge addresses will be taken from [here](https://poap.gallery/event/885)\n\n**Rationale behind switching to 2021-only:**\nAfter we locked the original thread, it came to our attention that it's no longer practical to obtain 2020 badges. **Due to technical difficulties, not everyone was *or ever will be* able to claim their badge. Details here: [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/834499078434979890/839883260540747826/840732076403327046)** \n\nThere are also some in the community who have expressed that 2020 badge holders have already received quite a generous airdrop, and going with 2021 only will allow the DAO to be more decentralized by making it viable for those folks to access the discord. As such, we believe the best path forward is a \"true even\" split among all subscribers based on the 2021 badge. I also recognize that the original naming of the \"even distribution\" proposal was somewhat confusing. This proposal is intended to resolve any ambiguities. \n\n### 2020+2021 Distribution\n\n* On 5/31/2021 at 11:59pm UTC, a snapshot will be taken of all addresses on ETH and xDAI that hold the following POAPs:\n  * 2020 Bankless Badge\n  * 2021 Bankless Badge\n* For each address, a count of the total number of badges held by that address will be computed.\n* The total number of badges held across all addresses will be summed.\n* The share of BANK to be allocated in the airdrop will be divided equally amongst all addresses according to the following formula:\n\nBANK claim = (87M BANK / Total # of badges)\n\n* BANK not claimed within 90 days of claims going live will be surrendered back to the community treasury.\n* The snapshot for 2021 Badge addresses will be taken from [here](https://poap.gallery/event/885) \n* The snapshot for 2020 Badge addresses will be taken from [here](https://poap.gallery/event/204)\n\n### Distribution Amount\n\nThe amount of BANK allocated is set to 29% of the retroactive distribution (87,000,000 BANK) per the [announcement post](https://medium.com/bankless-dao/announcing-bankless-dao-133220f5efd8). \n\n## NEXT STEPS\n\n* Bankless DAO shall announce the new distribution scheme on its public social media properties:\n  * Medium\n  * Twitter\n  * Substack\n* Bankless LLC, Ryan Sean Adams and David Hoffman are strongly encouraged to announce the new distribution scheme as well:\n  * Podcasts\n  * Discord\n  * Medium\n  * Twitter\n  * Substack\n* The Genesis Squad will oversee the computation and distribution of BANK.\n* Once the computation is complete, the airdrop should be available within the next seven days.\n* Ninety days after the claim site goes live, claims will be deactivated and remaining funds surrendered to the community treasury.\n\n## CONCLUSION\nFair genesis is critical for the perception and longevity of any DAO, so it’s important that we get it right. The current proposed subscriber airdrop is flawed in several ways. This proposal more closely aligns the distribution scheme with Bankless values while addressing the concerns of our community members. Vote “For” to help assure the future we all want.\n\n## VOTE\n\n* ### FOR (2021-only)\nAbandon the “unique emails seen” distribution scheme in favor of the **2021-only** scheme described above.\n\n* ### FOR (2020+2021)\nAbandon the “unique emails seen” distribution scheme in favor of the **2020+2021** scheme described above.\n\n* ### AGAINST\nNothing changes; preserve the status quo of using “unique emails seen” and manual collection of ETH addresses by DAO members.\n\n## FAQs\n\n**Doesn’t this mean that people who already received BANK will get a second airdrop?**\nYes, however, that would be the case under the current [genesis proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/QmdoixPMMT76vSt6ewkE87JZJywS1piYsGC3nJJpcrPXKS) as well. This proposal is only concerned with the distribution mechanism, not the target audience of the second airdrop.\n\n**Won’t this cause a rush of new subscribers who are only interested in claiming BANK to dump?**\nNo. This is known as a [Sybil attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack) and is impossible under this proposal. Anyone who subscribed in May or later would only be eligible to claim their badge on June 1st or later, which is after the deadline.\n\n**Shouldn’t we be providing extra compensation to those who forgot to claim their badge? People who already claimed are double dipping.**\nThis is a controversial topic and a distraction from the main purpose of this proposal, which is to get away from the email-based allocation scheme. If the DAO wants to provide additional compensation for those who forgot to claim their badge, that should be a separate proposal.\n\n**What happened to the duration-based option?**\nForum polling indicated that this was relatively unpopular compared to the \"even\" proposal, trailing with around half the votes. Given that the \"even\" proposal has a simple majority, we consider this sufficient to move forward with a formal vote. It's impossible to have a solution that satisfies everyone and the \"even\" proposal has the broadest support. In the original poll with no duration-based option, it achieved >80% approval.\n\n**Does this mean that users who bought badges on the secondary market would receive more BANK?**\nYes, however, this is believed to be quite rare. There's no practical way to exclude such cases, so the only way around this would be to issue a new NFT, which has its own set of issues (an extra step for many people to claim). Even if we went this route, people could still choose to speculate on the value of their new badge on the secondary market. As a result, we believe using the 2021 badge is our best option. ",

      "title": "Approve the Bankless DAO Genesis Proposal?",
      "content": "---\n\nRead the proposal on Bankless Medium:\nhttps://medium.com/bankless-dao\n\nAuthors: Ryan Sean Adams, David Hoffman\nProposed: 04 May, 2021\n\nSUMMARY\nBankless LLC is requesting a one-time grant of 250,000,000 BANK vesting over 3 years (includes a 6 month cliff) for on-going participation in the Bankless DAO.\n\nBACKGROUND\nBankless LLC is a core media node for the Bankless movement led by Ryan Sean Adams and David Hoffman. In addition to founding the bankless meme it has grown several valuable media properties including:\n\n- Bankless Newsletter - 40k subscribers\n- Bankless Podcast - 400k monthly downloads\n- Bankless YouTube - 46k subscribers\n\nBankless LLC is a profitable company with revenue, expenses, employees, and contractors.\n\nBankless LLC currently has 0 BANK.\n\nThis is by design. BANK is a fair launch distribution. The only recipients of BANK at genesis are individual community participants. Despite the effort put into founding this movement and future plans to participate, neither Bankless LLC nor the Genesis team have a BANK allocation.\n\nWe think the community should change that.\n\nWe think the Bankless DAO should allocate a portion of BANK supply to Bankless LLC and the Genesis team who launched this DAO.\n\nThis isn't about the value Bankless LLC has added to date. This is about the value we can add moving forward under the right alignment.\n\nBut we've chosen not to make this allocation decision unilaterally.\n\nWe want the community's blessing and on-chain proof that the BANK holders voted to add Bankless LLC as an active participant in the Bankless DAO.\n\nThis is your call.\n\nMOTIVATION\n\nWe think you should vote YES and here's why:\n\n1) Growth\n\nFirst, both the DAO and the movement need growth. We're on track to 10x the bankless movement this year:\n\n- Grow Bankless Newsletter reach to 100k readers\n- Grow Bankless YouTube to 100k subscribers\n- Grow Bankless Podcast to 1m monthly downloads\n\nBankless LLC can act as a funnel for new participants in the DAO.\n\n2) Products\n\nSecond, the Bankless DAO needs products.\n\nWe've shown the ability to scale new crypto media products quickly. For example, Metaversal our NFT newsletter was launched in January - it now has 25k subscribers! What could a DAO managed media outlet look like?\n\nWe're also expanding into culture products. For example, we recently stealth partnered with the apparel DAO Metafactory to propagate bankless culture to scarce physical items (announcement coming soon!). These culture products can be scaled and expanded with the Bankless DAO.\n\nLastly, we can collaborate with DeFi protocols to create new offerings for the bankless community. Will protocols give group discounts to the Bankless community like this? Can we create new financial products like the BED index? Can the Bankless DAO build its own DeFi tools? We'll see.\n\nIn short: we can help you build media, culture, and DeFi products.🔥🔥🔥\n\n3) Execution\n\nThird, the Bankless DAO needs execution.\n\nVision without execution is hallucination. When DAO's fizzle out it's not due to lack of vision, it's due to lack of execution. Look at the successful ones - Aave, Synthetix, Uniswap, Sushi, Yearn. What's the thing they have in common?\n\nThey deliver. They ship. They execute.\n\nBankless LLC executes.\n\nWe've built up the bankless narrative and created one of the most successful crypto media studios in the span of 18 months. We'll bring the resources and a culture of execution to the Bankless DAO. 🥳\n\n4) People\n\nWhich brings us to the forth reason, People. Aligning human capital to the mission and governance of the DAO is critical.\n\nThis proposal aligns the following talent to Bankless DAO:\n\n- Ryan Sean Adams - Media Producer (Genesis team)\n- David Hoffman - Media Producer (Genesis team)\n- Lucas Campbell - Writer & Analyst (Genesis team)\n- Michael Wong - Memelord (Genesis team)\n- Luke Whitten - Media Operations (Genesis team)\n- Mariano Conti - Solidity Lead (Genesis team)\n- James Montgomery - Front-end Developer (Genesis team)\n- David Mihal - Developer (Genesis team)\n- Nate Welch - Developer (Genesis team)\n- Reuben Bramanathan - Regulatory & Governance (Genesis team)\n- Logan Craig - Web Designer\n- William Peaster - Writer & NFT Analyst\n\nAbove - the Genesis team and Bankless LLC contributors.\n\nAdditionally, Bankless LLC will use a portion of its allocation to allow future talent and employees to participate in the DAO.\n\n5) Partnerships\n\nThe fifth reason is Partnerships. We believe DAO-to-DAO partnerships are the future of the DeFi industry, maybe the future of every industry. 🧠\n\nHere are some DAO's Bankless LLC has already worked with:\n- Aave\n- Balancer\n- Index Coop\n- MetaFactory\n- Kyber\n- Synthetix DAO\n- Uniswap\n- YFI (via yearn contributor)\n\nAdditionally, we've partnered with a number of non-DAO ecosystem companies including Argent, Gemini, Ledger, Metamask, Zapper, and Zerion.\n\nPerhaps we can find win/wins for these entities with Bankless DAO?\n\nSo why vote yes?\n\nGrowth. Products. Execution. People. Partnerships.\n\nThat's why you should vote yes.\n\nHere's what Bankless LLC will accomplish in the first 30 days:\n\n- Provide the Genesis team members a vesting BANK allocation for getting Bankless DAO off the ground\n\n- Provide operational staffing to collect ETH Addresses from Premium \n\n- Subscribers in order to complete the Premium Member Retrospective airdrop\n\n- Stand-up next versions of DAO infrastructure including: DAO Discord, DAO Snapshot, and DAO website\n\n- Participate in governance proposals to accomplish key objectives for the DAO (including Season 1 design)\nOrganize and recruit early community talent and participants\n\nSPECIFICATION\n\nBankless LLC is requesting a one time minority grant of 250,000,000 BANK (25% of the total supply) vesting over 3 years with a 6 month cliff, in order to participate as one of the core media nodes of the Bankless DAO.\n\nThis allocation will be granted out of the DAO's genesis treasury and sent to a Bankless LLC controlled multi-sig.\n\nIf passed the community treasury will be left with 50,000,000 BANK liquid plus an additional 400,000,000 BANK vesting linearly over 3 years starting at genesis.\n\nBankless LLC will follow the DAO community treasury's linear vesting schedule of 3 years but will also add an initial 6 month cliff to it's allocation. During this cliff, Bankless LLC will receive no vesting distributions for the first 6 months. After the cliff has completed, Bankless LLC's allocation will be distributed evenly over the remaining 30 months.\n\nIf this proposal passes, 75% of BANK will still be owned and controlled by non-Bankless LLC community members via the retroactive distribution and community treasury.\n\nIf this proposal passes, the total BANK distribution would as follows:\nIf this proposal fails to pass, the total BANK distribution would remain:\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis Genesis proposal aligns Bankless LLC to the DAO as a media node and rewards the Genesis team for its role in launching the DAO. The allocation is a minority stake and vesting over 3 years.\n\nThe community maintains majority control.\n\nIf this proposal is passed by BANK token holders, Bankless LLC will provide foundational support for the DAO during its earliest phases and will remain long-term aligned as Bankless DAO pursues its objectives.\n\nVote YES to make Bankless LLC your first media node.\n\nLet's help the world go bankless.\n\n-Ryan Sean Adams & David Hoffman\n\n---\n\nAuthor background and commitment\n\nRyan Sean Adams is a crypto investor & co-founder of Bankless LLC.
