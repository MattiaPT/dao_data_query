      "title": "Proposal #021 = Community appreciation to @Aamorris11 @yuurinbee",
      "content": "Proposal Type: Resources \n\nCreator: @ProfMetaverse\n\nRelic Type: Archmage \n\nOverview: \nMetaBrands has been an awesome experience for me, and having been involved from startup, I have witnessed firsthand how a DAO can and should operate. That to me has been extremely rewarding and insightful. What I have also witnessed is that – and that is often the Achilles heel of any decentralized blockchain – it was driven above and beyond by only a few. In my view it is time we reward those who have put in literally blood, sweat, tears not to mention heaps of their own money to make this work. This was all done without seeking recognition or acknowledgement for that, let alone compensation. \n\nNow we have been informed that there is one asset left, namely the bksbackstage project for which MetaBrands hopes to receive seed tokens. Latest status is they have been delaying their launch for more than 2 years now, and it is not sure if they will ever distribute these tokens. When they do, I am proposing to my fellow Relic holders we waive that distro and let @Aamorris11 and @yuurinbee be the exclusive beneficiaries of that last distro. Am open to including more names if I missed anyone. \n\nMy reasoning is as follows. Although I am one of the co-founders, and have contributed to MetaBrands during its inception, launch and operations, I feel I did not pull my weight as @Aamorris11 and @yuurinbee have done. Without their relentless drive, efforts and tenacity, MetaBrands would have failed in its infancy, and would by now be a long and distant memory. That would also mean no Relic holder would have ever been able to recover any of the assets. I personally feel almost embarrassed to ‘hold my hand out’ and get a distro while I honestly feel I am not fully entitled to that. That is also why I did not participate in the Relic raffle. Yes, I am fully aware of how a DAO works, and actually fully embrace that. \n\nBut, a DAO also lives and thrives on input and ideation from the community, this being an example of that. So, I ask my fellow Relic holders to join me in doing the right thing, and abstain from the last distro and let @Aamorris11 and @yuurinbee be the sole beneficiaries of that. \n\nOn a final note, this is proposal 21. The number 21 is associated with creativity, independence, and personal growth, it signifies positive change and expansion of one's horizons. All could not be more applicable. \n\n\nTimeline: Bring to a vote asap, distro as originally scheduled. \n\nInvestment Scope: NA \n\nOptions: As some might think all of the distro is a bit too much, I am including a 50% option. \nOption 1:\t\t100% of distro to be given to @Aamorris11 and @yuurinbee\nOption 2:\t\t50% of distro to be given to @Aamorris11 and @yuurinbee, rest dispersed amongst Relic holders (minus @Aamorris11 and @yuurinbee). \nOption 3:\t\tdistro to all Relic holders. \n\nReceiver: \n@Aamorris11\n@yuurinbee\n\nVoting period: \n3 days. \n\nExecutor: Any available DAO Operator",

      "title": "Proposal #20",
      "content": "**Proposal Type**:  Core\n\n**Creator**: Sigurdsen\n\n**Relic Type**: Archmage\n\n---\n\nMAGE Relic Final Snapshot Date: 10/1/2024\n\n**Overview**:  \nThis proposal aims to disband MetaBrands DAO and distribute its remaining assets fairly among all Relic NFT holders. The goal is to ensure a fair resolution for all participants, allowing them to decide how best to proceed with their holdings. Given the diverse opinions within the community regarding future investment strategies and market conditions, this approach is intended to address the different preferences of all members.\n\n**Assets to be Distributed**:  \nThe DAO currently holds several assets that will be distributed evenly among all Relic NFT holders, based on the number of NFTs each holder owns. The assets include:\n> - BTC  \n> - ETH  \n> - MATIC  \n> - WETH  \n> - USDC  \n> - AVAX  \n> - **RON** (to be distributed separately via a sign-up form due to its native token requirements)  \n\nAdditionally, several smaller positions (e.g., GQ, etc.) and Cornucopias NFTs will be liquidated (if possible) and converted to stablecoins to be added to the total distribution.\n\n**Voting Options**:  \n1. **Option 1: Equal Split to Relics with Ronin Sign-Up Form**  \n   - All assets will be split evenly among all Relic NFT holders proportionate to their holding weight, **except Ronin (RON)**, which will require a separate sign-up form due to its native token requirements.  \n   - **Execution Plan**:  \n     - **2 Weeks to Vote**: Conduct voting via a Snapshot Proposal to decide on disbanding the DAO and distributing assets.  \n     - **If Vote Passes in Favor of Disbanding (Start of Week 3)**:  \n       - **Collect Data for Ronin Airdrop (1 Month)**: Begin data collection for the Ronin Airdrop process.  \n       - **Prepare for Liquidity Pull**: Plan to pull liquidity from the Uniswap WETH/MAGE Pool by the end of Week 6.  \n       - **Set Up Airdrop/Split Distribution**: Prepare for asset distribution based on voting outcomes.  \n     - **End of Week 6**:  \n       - **Pull Liquidity from Pools**: Withdraw all liquidity from the Uniswap WETH/MAGE Pool.  \n       - **Distribute Assets**: Complete the airdrop and distribution of assets.  \n     - **Conclude Operations**:  \n       - **Dissolve MetaBrands Entity**: After distribution, close down the website, Discord, Twitter, and other social channels to finalize the dissolution of MetaBrands.\n\n2. **Option 2: Distribution with Sign-Up Phases**  \n   - **Execution Plan**:  \n     - **Initial Sign-Up Period**: All Relic NFT holders will have **1 month** to complete a sign-up form and claim the portion of the treasury associated with their Relics.  \n     - **First Distribution**: At the end of the 1-month period, only the funds corresponding to the registered and approved Relic holders will be distributed.  \n     - **Second Sign-Up Period**: Relic NFT holders who did not sign up initially will have an additional **3 months** to complete the sign-up form.  \n     - **Second Distribution**: At the end of the 3-month period, only the funds corresponding to the relics claimed in this phase will be distributed.  \n     - **Final Distribution**: Any remaining assets, after both distribution phases, will be evenly shared among all users who signed up in either the first or second phase.  \n     - **Distribution Method**: All tokens will be sent to the registered holders using **BulkSender** to ensure an efficient and accurate distribution process.\n\n   - **Distribution Plan**:  \n     - **Initial Distribution Phase**:  \n       - Relic NFT holders will have **1 month** to sign up for the initial distribution of assets by completing a sign-up form.  \n       - At the end of this 1-month period, only the portion of the treasury corresponding to the registered Relic holders will be distributed.  \n       - Users can only claim in this initial sign-up period or the second period, not both.  \n       - Funds for Relic holders who do not sign up will remain in the treasury pool for a second distribution.  \n     - **Second Distribution Phase**:  \n       - Relic holders who did not participate in the initial distribution will have **3 additional months** to sign up for a second distribution by completing a sign-up form.  \n       - At the end of this 3-month period, only the portion of the treasury corresponding to the relics claimed in this period will be distributed.  \n     - **Final Allocation**:  \n       - After the second distribution, any remaining assets in the treasury (from relics not claimed in either the first or second phase) will be shared among the holders who registered in either the first or second distribution periods.  \n       - All users who have signed up during either of the distribution phases will receive their share of these remaining assets.\n\n3. **Option 3: Do Nothing**  \n   - Take no action and continue as is.  \n\n**Reasoning Behind the Proposal**:  \nThe decision to propose disbanding the DAO and distributing the assets is based on the following considerations:  \n- **Fairness and Flexibility**: This option allows each NFT holder to decide independently what to do with their share of the assets. Some may choose to hold until a potential bull run in 2025, while others may prefer to invest in high-risk assets or move away from crypto altogether.  \n- **Covering All Interests**: By distributing assets directly, the proposal respects the different opinions and investment goals of the community members, ensuring that no one feels stuck or forced into a particular strategy.\n\n**Background on MetaBrands**:  \nMetaBrands started with promising projects and a solid team of advisors, but external challenges, such as a prolonged bear market, projects with questionable actors, and a decline in interest in web3 scholarships (such as Axie Infinity), led to a downward trajectory. Despite these challenges, the DAO has maintained transparency and communication with its community. However, given current conditions, it seems prudent to offer a fair and equitable way to resolve the DAO's future.\n\n**Distribution Method**:  \n- **Bulksender** will be used to efficiently distribute funds to all eligible Relic NFT holders.\n\n**Executor**: Any available DAO Operator(s)\n\n**Bounty/Payment**: None",

      "title": "[Time Sensitive 24H] Blink Galaxy - GQ Accumulation",
      "content": "Proposal Type: Resource\n\nCreator: @Adrian | MetaBrands.io \nRelic Type: Archmage\n\nOverview: Blink Galaxy - Previously known as OuterRing has reached below seed price marking a good opportunity for the DAO to secure our spot as the top holder in their entire ecosystem and more yield opportunity for MAGE Relic owners.\n\nAdditional Details: Delays and many negative sentiment revolving around $GQ has taken the token to an all time low below seed price, but I personally feel that things are about to reverse and sentiment is about to change due to these events that could positively impact the token price. \n\nA) The token was holding its price around private sale pretty well until a hack incident happened, causing more FUD and panic from token holders selling the token to slightly below seed price. (As of today, the stolen tokens were recovered and 100% of it was burned and removed forever from circulation)\n\nB) The sentiment in the community has reached an all time low with many people questioning the teams activity and lack of marketing initiative. (We've been on calls with them and they've already acknowledged the challenges they have and working to improve these areas)\n\nC) Bull market is here while BTC broke all time high, $GQ made an all time low, so some impatient whale recently sold off their entire stash at a loss to exit the project. Many have questioned the team's silence and why the token price is where it is. (They are changing and about to drive up marketing for their ecosystem as well as releasing newly designed content they've been working on for the past 2 years.)\n\nD) Risk/Reward here feels fairly safe given that majority of the token is already in circulation and many of the pre-sale investors have dumped and exited their position. The upside here is that OR re-branded to Blink Galaxy and has become a distribution hub for other games within their ecosystem. All of them all using $GQ as the main token. They are striving to launch their own gaming chain which $GQ will be used as the gas token to transact on their network.  We would be acquiring additional token from this project at around 13-14m FDV for an entire gaming ecosystem.\n\nThe objective is to accumulate $GQ token at their all time low while the bull market is here and they have transition into a gaming ecosystem before the GameFi narrative cycles back and their marketing initiatives kick off. We would be well positioned that allows the DAO to exit some of its holdings to realize yield for MAGE Relic owners while still maintaining our position as a top token holder in their entire ecosystem. \n\nAdditional Context: The DAO invested into OuterRing for Seed & Private rounds and have achieved a full ROI + over $100k in realized profit for MAGE Relic owners while still owning tokens right now that puts us in the top 20 holder position. We are technically in a safer and better position to re-enter into this project now and benefit from the upside potential, even if it's just a small 2-3x on a short time frame if the DAO voted for it. As their partner, we are also actively working with them on the backend to help them with their strategy to take advantage of the current bull run sentiment so they aren't left behind.\n\nTimeline: When prices are within/below the DAO's agreed entry point. \n\nInvestment Scope: This should include the size of the investment and desired assets to acquire\na. Total Amount ($50k, $100k, $150k, none)\nb. Asset List (stable token)\nc. Investment Horizon (decided by the DAO)\n\nOptions:\n$50k to buy $GQ\n$100k to buy $GQ\n$150k to buy $GQ\nReject (Do Nothing)\n\nReceiver: MetaBrands Treasury Trade\n\nExecutor: Any available DAO Operator",

      "title": "MAGE (AVAX) Bridge Closure",
      "content": "Proposal Type: Core\n\nCreator: Sigurdsen\nRelic Type: Archmage\n\nOverview: In light of the confirmed closure of the Multichain bridge and ongoing issues with price display on the AVAX chain, this proposal outlines a strategic plan to safeguard the project by pulling MAGE token liquidity from AVAX. The burn will be initiated within precisely defined timeframes - 1 month or 3 months after voting has concluded. This will give the community to decide the right timeframe and also allow for a wider window for people to have enough time to base their decision. The objective is to mitigate risks, protect the project's foundation, and maintain transparency.\n\nAdditional Details:\nRationale: The closure of the Multichain bridge, combined with ongoing issues in price display on the AVAX chain, has been confirmed. These associated risks necessitate decisive action. The proposed strategies aim to secure the project's foundation, mitigate potential losses, and position it for future opportunities.\n\nImplementation Plan: The chosen option will be implemented exactly 1 month or 3 months after voting has concluded, with clear communication to the community about the reasons behind the decision and the steps taken to ensure the project's stability.\n\nOutcome: The successful execution of the chosen strategy is expected to safeguard the project, protect user assets, and foster trust within the community. Correcting price display issues is an essential part of this strategy.\n\nRisk Mitigation: The closure of the bridge, coupled with the proposed liquidity pull and burn, serves as a risk mitigation strategy, ensuring the project's sustainability amid challenging circumstances, including price display issues.\n\nBridge Closure and Price Display Issues Certainty: Given the confirmed closure of the Multichain bridge and ongoing issues with price display on the AVAX chain, the proposal strongly leans towards the consideration that the bridge is not likely to reopen. This confident speculation, along with price display issues, forms the basis for the proposed strategies outlined in Options 1-3.\n\n\nStrategies & Options:\nOption 1 : Pull Liquidity After 1 Month\nPull MAGE token liquidity for the WAVAX/MAGE pair on Avalanche and initiate the burning of MAGE (AVAX) tokens exactly 1 month after voting has concluded. After the liquidity pair has been pulled, add the remaining WAVAX tokens to the MetaBrands DAO Treasury Multi-sig Wallet.\n\nOption 2 : Pull Liquidity After 3 Months\nPull MAGE token liquidity for the WAVAX/MAGE pair on Avalanche and initiate the burning of MAGE (AVAX) tokens exactly 3 months after voting has concluded. After the liquidity pair has been pulled, add the remaining WAVAX tokens to the MetaBrands DAO Treasury Multi-sig Wallet.\n\nOption 3 : Do Nothing, Reject Proposal\nDo not proceed with the liquidity burn and keep the WAVAX/MAGE pair on Avalanche.\n\n\nTimeline: Effective upon completion, as specified in proposal\n\nExecutor: Any available DAO Operator\n\nBounty/Payment: None",

      "title": "Adjustment for Buyback and Yield Distribution",
      "content": "Proposal Type: Core\n\nCreator: Rellixx & Adrian\nRelic Type: Archmages\n\nOverview: With the success of DEXT tokens implemented buyback and burn strategy, I recommend also adapting our buyback and Yield distribution to a similar strategy where majority of the yield is used towards a token burn. This will ultimately create less sell pressure each month while creating more demand and a healthier liquidity pool for the ecosystem.\n\nAdditional Details:\nAs of current, 75% of yield is being distributed while 20% is reserved for the treasury and 5% burned is counter productive for the DAO as mage prices linger around -85% (0.022) of TGE price (0.15). This current ratio is affecting the liquidity pool as demonstrated by months of yield distribution, only for the price to increase momentary while a day or two later retraces with a small increase followed by dropping off even lower, making the yield distro ineffective and circulating a lot more mage tokens amongst relic owners who wouldn't have the liquidity to sustain their mage valuation. This negatively impacts the project as a whole in a few ways\n1: It devalues the relics and creates an easier entry for new relics to be minted. Currently treasury share to Archmage is more than what it cost to mint an Archmage relic.\n2: The project as a whole is not seen as attractive for new comers to join and participate in the DAO (purchasing mage to mint relic to increase the burn and adding to LP). \n3: with a thin liquidity pool, token holders or new investors aren't able to buy or sell a large amount of mage without having a high price impact. \n4: As the value of mage is low, the treasury's holding of mage becomes devalued as well making it harder to use mage as leverage to be accepted as collateral for future partners, advisors, or influencers.\n\nThis proposal aims to address this issue with a scaling adjustment for yield distro. The goal is to adjust the ratio so that the burn ratio of each buy back is larger than the yield distro vs the current ratio of yield being more than burn. This will help the DAO, relic owners, as well as token holders by:\n1: Increasing the liquidity pool by ensuring that the liquidity injection is always more than what's possible to sell into.\n2: Increases every holder's value of mage holding and relic's value\n3: Increases the leverage of mage tokens held in our treasury to onboard more supporter\n4: Steady upward growth in our tokenomics to attract new relic owners participation at a later stage\n5: Helps sustain mage value long term especially when staking is released\n\n\nOptions 1, 2, and 3 will offer no yield to the Treasury by utilizing it for more token burn while the total buyback amount is between $1 - $30,000 USD. At $30,001 and on, 20% of the burn amount will be allocated to the treasury.\n\nStrategies & Options:\n>Option 1> : 90% Burn and 10% Yield distribution under $30k USD or 70% Burn, 20% Treasury, 10%Yield over $30k USD\n\n> Option 2> : 75% Burn and 25% Yield distribution under $30k USD or 55% Burn, 20% Treasury, 25%Yield over $30k USD\n\n> Option 3> : 50% Burn and 50% Yield distribution under $30k USD or 30% Burn, 20% Treasury, 50%Yield over $30k USD\n\n> Option 4> : No action, keep the same 75%Yield, 20% Treasury, and 5% burn (Reject Proposal)\n\n\nTimeline: Effective immediately\n\nBounty/Payment: NONE",

      "title": "Convert AXS to RON Reward Strategy",
      "content": "Proposal Type: Resource\n\nCreator: YuurinBee\nRelic Type: Archmage\n\nOverview: To diversify the portfolio and reduce potential investment risk of staking and compounding AXS alone, the DAO can sell the monthly rewards of AXS and convert them into RON, which will be used to stake at approximately 25%+ APR. This strategy allows for the diversification of DAO assets and compounding rewards by staking the Ronin Native Blockchain Token (RON) by Axie Infinity/Sky Mavis.\n\nAdditional Details: As mentioned above for those not aware, RON is the native token of Sky Mavis/Axie Infinity's blockchain. Sky Mavis is making efforts to create the next scalable solution for Blockchain Gaming, using their own game Axie Infinity at the core. I will avoid getting into too much speculation and price speculation with this proposal and just focus more on this being a diversification strategy for DAO and supporting another gaming blockchain's core protocol by staking its native token. For more information, please join the Discord and view the latest DAO Discussion labeled \"Convert AXS to RON Reward Strategy\".\n\nAt the end of each month, the DAO will sell the AXS rewards that have been accumulated and sell them for RON via Katana - Official DEX (https://katana.roninchain.com/#/swap) and immediately afterwards, delegate them for staking via the official website (https://app.roninchain.com/staking). Tracking of both AXS and RON can be done via the official MetaBrands DAO Treasury Portfolio on Nansen.\n\nStrategies & Options:\n\nConvert Monthly AXS for RON (Accept Proposal)\nNo Action (Reject Proposal)\nTimeline: Effective Immediately. Starts at the end of the month in which the proposal is passed.\n\nInvestment Scope:\na. Monthly AXS Rewards (Sold at Market Price)\nb. Acquire & Stake RON\n\nReceiver: MetaBrands Ronin Wallet\n\nFinal Notes: If this proposal passes, the acquiring of RON through the selling of monthly AXS rewards will be in the same wallet that is staking AXS (Ronin Wallet). Available for tracking on the official MetaBrands DAO Treasury Portfolio on Nansen (https://portfolio.nansen.ai/dashboard/APE-4G7NY8).\n\nExecutor: YuurinBee\n\nBounty/Payment: 50,000 MAGE (One Time Payment)",

      "title": "DCA For Scaling Treasury with Yield Intent (Part 2)",
      "content": "Proposal Type: Resource\n\nCreator: YuurinBee\n\nRelic Type (Optional): Archmage\n\nOverview:  This proposal is an extended version of the previous proposal by Adrian titled \"DCA For Scaling Treasury with Yield Intent\", as discussed in the Discord with the DAO.\n\nThe Market and P2E sentiment is currently at an extreme low (all time low since the high). If the current sentiment continues, our monthly yield rewards will be drying up very quickly as there aren't enough activities generating positive yield on a monthly basis. I would like to present a semi-low risk strategy during these market conditions for the DAO to consider in order to grow our treasury for the long-term as well as potentially generating additional yield for MAGE Relic owners.\n\nAdditional Details: As BTC is below $20k and ETH barely above $1k, I believe we should start discussing in what range we should DCA some BTC, ETH, MATIC, etc... to add to the DAO Treasury for the next bull cycle. I would suggest $130k to be considered with a  potential split between different top currencies.\n\nWith this strategy, the purpose is to trade and earn profit off the volatility of the market by accumulating in different ranges as the token hits its highs and lows in the daily range. For example, within the 4 hour range of BTC there is usually a price difference of $500-2k. The goal would be to find favorable entries and take the profit from low to high as often as possible. This should result in two possible outcomes:\n\nIf the currency drops even lower after the purchase, that buy order would be considered as a DCA order that gets added to the DAO Treasury for long-term appreciation.\n\nIf the currency appreciates after the purchase, the profits realized would be accumulated for the purpose of expanding yield generating opportunities. This could mean a side pool for high risk, high reward investments that are deemed time-sensitive without proposals and approval or injected as monthly buybacks when deemed favorable.\n\nTimeline: On-going, until later decided by the DAO.\n\nThe intention of this investment would be for growing the DAO Treasury, but at any time the DAO can vote and decide when to liquidate assets for yield if it makes sense to do so.\n\nFor example, using easy numbers for reference... the DAO puts $300k into BTC at $10k per BTC. If BTC does a 5x to $50k, the DAO's $300k would be worth $1.5m. At that time, if the DAO votes and wants to start harvesting profit, say $200k for the end of month's buyback, $500k of BTC would be sold so that the initial $300k would be returned to the DAO Treasury's liquid capital with $200k left to be used for buyback. The DAO ultimately votes and decides when it wants to liquidate assets and how the profits should be utilized.\n\nAdditionally, say an investment opportunity comes up and the DAO decides we need some liquid capital, we can vote to sell X to get $Y to fund Z.\n\nInvestment Scope:\na. $130,000 worth of Stable to deploy into BTC/ETH/MATIC\nb. As assets appreciate long-term, exit timing decided by DAO\n\nReceiver: MetaBrands Treasury\n\nFinal Notes: The executor of this proposal requests to be compensated with a 15% performance fee on all profits generated for trading and management (Outcome 2). This is only applied for generated profits, not for deploying funds to DCA. For example, if $150k is approved for DCA and by the end of the month, we are able to earn $30k in profit, 15% of $30k or $4.5k would be owed as compensation to the executor. If the full $150k is deployed to DCA with no profits generated, no compensation will be given.\n\nExecutor: YuurinBee",

      "title": "Change Yield Mechanic (Treasury Allocation)",
      "content": "Proposal Type: Core\n\nCreator: Oleg\nRelic Type (Optional): Archmage\n\nOverview: Keep the monthly yield airdrop portion going to the DAO treasury (20%) in a better liquid asset/stable instead of MAGE tokens to improve the investment strength to allocate more capital into products and projects.\n\nAdditional Details:\n\nBackground: At the beginning of every month, the total yield collected by play-to-earn models and their assets will be used to buy the MAGE token at market price. After the market purchase, MAGE tokens will be burned, added to the treasury, and the majority will be airdropped to the MAGE Relic NFT owners. See WP for more details: https://whitepaper.metabrands.io/airdrops\n\nMy proposal has the goal of making better use of the 20% portion going to the DAO Treasury by keeping the profits in a high cap (or even better in stables) instead of buying mage tokens from the market.\n\nThis has several, positive reasons and one disadvantage:\n\n+ Adding MAGE tokens to the balance sheet, just \"locks\" the value (if i may call it) since we don't sell or lend the tokens as there is not enough liquidity on the market without pushing the price too much.\n+ DAO treasury already holds more than 50% of its total capitalization in MAGE tokens - this is already a very good balance, i don't see any reason to increase it even further. Reference : https://apeboard.finance/dashboard/APE-4G7NY8\n+ By keeping the yield in stables, we can invest in more projects, execute DCA strategies, or build passive income streams - where the direction is decided by the DAO as usual, but we have more room to grow.\n--\n- At first it may look like buying less MAGE tokens from the market is a bad thing in term of price and supply, but we quickly can find counter-arguments:\n1. The percentage for MAGE Relic owners as well as the burn ratio remains the same - 75% / 5% of the yield. On the other side, higher working capital/generated yield means accordingly more MAGE tokens are still bought and distributed, just through an other way (which is actually an other advantage for relic holders and removing supply)\n2. With MAGE staking being ready for release anytime the DAO decides, we have a huge tool in the hindquarters to lock circulating supply, which is definitely a possible hedge in case the rate of deflation is not good enough from DAO perspective (self speaking and complementary similar to the relic minting being a tool since day one).\n\nTimeline: Starting with next yield distribution.\n\nBounty/Payment: none\n\nReceiver: MetaBrands DAO Treasury\n\nFinal Notes: More important than the actual proposal, we should also use the capital and invest it into passive income options that produce less but stable/calculable yields, so I encourage every MAGE token holder and MAGE Relic owner to create resource proposals.

      "content": "**Proposal Type:** Resource\n\n**Creator:** @Adrian | MetaBrands.io\n\n**Relic Type (Optional):** Archmage\n\n**Overview:** The Market and P2E sentiment is currently at an extreme low (all time low since the high). If the current sentiment continues, our monthly yield rewards will be drying up very quickly as there aren't enough activities generating positive yield on a monthly basis. I would like to present a semi-low risk strategy during these market conditions for the DAO to consider in order to grow our treasury for the long-term as well as potentially generating additional yield for MAGE Relic owners.\n\n**Additional Details:** As BTC drops below $20k and ETH below $1k, I believe we should start discussing in what range we should DCA some BTC, ETH, MATIC, etc... to add to the DAO Treasury for the next bull cycle. I would suggest a minimum of $150k to be considered with a maximum of $300k split between different top currencies.\n\nWith this strategy, the purpose is to trade and earn profit off the volatility of the market by accumulating in different ranges as the token hits its highs and lows in the daily range. For example, within the 4 hour range of BTC there is usually a price difference of $500-2k. The goal would be to find favorable entries and take the profit from low to high as often as possible.

      "title": "MAGE Staking Launch Strategy",
      "content": "Title: MAGE Staking Launch Strategy\n\nProposal Type: Strategy\n\nCreator: YuurinBee\nRelic Type (Optional): Archmage\n\nOverview:\n\nAccording to the MetaBrands Roadmap, MAGE Staking is supposed to go live within Q2 (this quarter). With the recent shift in market sentiment and morale, I would propose that we strategically delay the launch for 3 key points outlined below:\n\n1. Staking should be launched when market sentiment is more bullish, where more users are comfortable and more willing to participate. With the current conditions, I don't think we can create a big enough wave in order to get a lot of stakers and bring the attention and awareness to the MetaBrands ecosystem that it deserves. If we don't have a lot of participants, the rewards could be too consolidated (not a healthy distribution) and create some massive whales (likely promoting unhealthy, selfish market manipulation) for those that come in and buy up a bunch of cheap tokens to stake for a very high APR.\n\n2. Staking usually helps to stabilize a token price with added liquidity. With this in mind, we should actually market and launch staking when our token price is more desirable and above the launch price. Launching now would effectively make the cost of minting relics a lot cheaper than majority of current relic owners, ultimately extracting value from our current assets.\n\n3. We should plan a marketing campaign around the launch of staking in order to create as much buzz as possible, this should take approximately 2-4 weeks of preparation work/arrangement before the launch date. *Note: MetaBrands advisors have already created a marketing plan for the launch of the Staking Portal, but unfortunately due to the timing and current marketing conditions, another strategy is needed.\n\nSuggested Launch: Since we just finished with IDO vesting and some of the current market bloodbath, our token is now at/nearing an all time low. We still have a few more distribution cycles for Private & Seed investors. I would suggest that we continue to harvest our yield rewards for our monthly buyback and continue distribution to potentially offset private investors dumping. Once these next allocations are distributed, we can plan a marketing campaign along with our buyback to raise the floor, where it feels desirable to co-launch with staking. \n\nIn conclusion, we can coordinate something much larger where multiple moving parts and efforts work together to execute a strategic campaign in order to best support the market and project.\n\nFull Details \n\nVote Option 1: Delay Staking Launch & New Marketing Strategy\nVote Option 2: Launch Staking Following Roadmap (Suboptimal Conditions, No Marketing Support)",

They must mint in March and hold the entire month of April in order to qualify.\n\nTimeline: Immediately after February's Distribution (Early March), Starting in March\n\nBounty/Payment: n/a\n\nReceiver: n/a\n\nFinal Notes: Final notes or additional input from proposal creator\n\nHere is a Google Sheet template on how to determine approximate distribution amount/Relic owners.\n\nFeel free to make a copy, so you can edit the green fields and play around with the values and variables.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dt-_Cxvi-9e8JNnr8f-GqcEyJRT_HE48KuTBuHgop6Y/edit?usp=sharing\n\nMage Relic Snapshot Clarification: To elaborate a bit more on the process, this means that at the end of this month (February) a new snapshot will be taken of all current Relics that were minted up until this snapshot. In April, Relics minted up until February, who have not moved wallets, will receive the yield distribution generated during the month of March. New Relic minters in March, would need to hold their Relic for the entire month of April to qualify for April's yield distribution around May 1st-5th.",

      "title": "Utilize AXS Staking Yield",
      "content": "Proposal Type: Strategy\n\nCreator: Oleg\nRelic Type: Archmage\n\nOverview: \nThe MetaBrands Treasury initially bought $250,000 worth of AXS and put it into the official Axie Infinity (Ronin) single-sided staking contract. At the time of writing this proposal, the earned rewards are re-staked (compounding). I suggest we start to convert/sell this rewards in a 75%/25% split. See the following details.\n\nAdditional Details: \nI suggest a sell and compound strategy as follows:\n\n- We sell 75% of rewards on a monthly basis\n- We keep 25% of rewards compounding to grow our position\n\nNote: I want to highlight my proposal affects only the delta between the 2,500 AXS and the accumulated APR. The initially bought 2,500 AXS is untouched and growing. See my example calculation\n\nLet's assume we generate 100 AXS per month (example number).\nBy the end of the yield interval, we sell 75 AXS to use these profits for our MAGE Yield Airdrop (https://whitepaper.metabrands.io/airdrops). \n2,525 AXS will stay in the contract and is used to grow our position within this investment. \n\nNext month, we follow and repeat the 75/25% strategy every month, until voted otherwise.\n\nTimeline: Monthly, before MAGE Yield Airdrop\n\nBounty/Payment: none\n\nReceiver: none\n\nFinal Notes: \nThis way we can add a consistent income source for the MAGE airdrops, but also compound a smaller portion to grow our positions within DAO investments and other ecosystems.

Many also attribute its popularity to the gameplay, team transparency and community involvement during the development process.\"\n\nTimeline: 1 Week\n\nInvestment Scope: This should include the size of the investment and desired assets to acquire\na. Total Amount: ($USD): 50,000 USDT\nb. Asset List (Type, Information, etc.):\n\nFunds will be used to acquire NFT horses with the purpose to race (earning income daily + Breed to increase output/reselling horses to de-risk)\n\nSmaller portion of remaining funds will be used to acquire PGX governance token.\n\nReceiver: MB Scholarship Investment Account\n\nExecutor: Adrian \n\nBounty/Payment: \na. Amount of total MAGE tokens requested: 5,000 MAGE (~1,000) + $1,000 USDT\nb. Bounty reward paid after the deployment of funds (acquisition of horses and PGX tokens)\nc.

Based on the current projections if the game economy stabilizes the ROI for purely racing would be approximately 2 months excluding breeding/reselling. If breeding to scale + resell, ROI could be recovered in ~20 days or less. This will take approximately one week of research and market watching to acquire the most optimal horses / cooldown of newly purchased horses to start breeding.",

      "content": "Proposal Type: Strategy\n\nCreator: Adrian\nRelic Type (Optional): Archmage\n\nOverview: \nMetaBrands is bridging to AVAX as per our roadmap and will be needing liquidity in AVAX to pair the new pool on Pangolin DEX. The initial plan is to bridge 50% of existing LP from Uniswap over to Avalanche (AVAX).\n\nETH is currently ~$3,200, the market condition has dropped from our initial acquisition price of eth at ~$4,000/ETH. If we are to sell eth now to convert it to AVAX from our LP we would be assuming a loss with this conversion.\n\nI would suggest we use stable from the treasury to acquire AVAX and move the ETH from LP into the treasury (~66 ETH) that can be used in the future for acquiring NFTs or other assets on ETH. \n\nAdditional Details: As AVAX token also took a dip recently it would make the most sense to deploy stable tokens to acquire this asset also on a lower entry point if viewing it for long-term appreciation. It also makes sense to preserve the ETH and not sell at this price unless the DAO views ETH going even lower from here on out and wishes to sell the ETH now for stable/AVAX.\n\nTimeline: 24 hours, Urgent Decision Needed\n\nBounty/Payment: \na. Amount of total MAGE tokens requested: 1,000 MAGE ~$350\nb. If requesting a deposit or down payment to start, include the requested amount: 0\nc.

Sorry for the inconvenience and urgency.\n\n1) Agree - Acquire AVAX with Stable Tokens\n2) Disagree - Convert ~66 ETH from LP to AVAX (Loss)",

The goal is to generate additional income on a monthly basis or until the funds are utilized in other contributions like MBV.\n\nIn order to enter Yean Finance Vault, MetaBrands needs to supply LUSD3CRV-f to Convex Finance to earn CRV and CVX (and any other available tokens). Earned tokens are harvested, sold for more LUSD3CRV-f which is deposited back into the strategy. However, MetaBrands first needs to provide liquidity into the Curve lusd pool (without staking in the Curve gauge), and then stake the LUSDCRV tokens into Convex Finance. The deposit into Curve can be done with one single token, for example USDT.\n\nIn summary, the multsing treasury singers need to perform the following steps:\n1- Provide Liquidity into Curve;\n2- Deposit LUSDCRV into Convex;\n3- Deposit LUSD3CRV-f into Yearn Finance Curve-LUSD Vault.\n\nAdditional Details: At the moment, the Yearn Finance Curve-LUSD Vault is yielding 27.12% APY.

      "content": "Proposal Type: Core \n\nCreator: YuurinBee\nRelic Type (Optional): Archmage\n\nOverview: This proposal is for newly recommended Yield Distribution rates and percentages for the long-term health and growth of the MetaBrands ecosystem\n\nAdditional Details: \n\nCurrent Distribution: \n80% Relic Owners, 10% Treasury, 10% Burned\n\nProposed Distribution:\n75% Relic Owners, 20% Treasury, 5% Burned\n\nTimeline: Implemented immediately after the first Yield Distribution on January 1, 2022 so future cycles include these updated adjustments\n\nBounty/Payment: \na. n/a\nb. n/a\nc. n/a\n\nReceiver: n/a\n\nFinal Notes: The reason why I suggest these changes is for the long-term health and growth of the MetaBrands ecosystem, largely by doubling the amount of yield that the MetaBrands Treasury acquires. By having more liquid assets to invest with, MetaBrands is effectively able to scale and contribute to more projects and ecosystems. This isn't only beneficial from the financial or resource perspective, but this allows for MetaBrands to partner and participate in more projects at a higher capacity. If resources are managed properly and favorably, this recommended distribution ratio will help double the growth of the MetaBrands Treasury, without reducing the rate of yield much for MAGE Relic owners (-5%) and only a 5% reduction on MAGE token burning. As a MAGE Relic owner, I would like to see MetaBrands contribute and participate in more projects and ecosystems, which could create more yield in the big picture and more overall growth... compared to the current model which is only 5% higher yield for MAGE relic owners. Additionally, burning tokens is a great mechanic, but we are all aware that minting MAGE Relic NFTs is the biggest deflationary mechanic for the MAGE Token and I think it's better to take 5% of that Yield Distribution and add it to the MetaBrands Treasury for scaling and potential partnerships.",
