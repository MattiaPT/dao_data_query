      "content": "The Doodle Watch vote will be using Weighted Voting.\n\nIn Weighted Voting, a voter may split their voting allocation (amount of Doodles they own) amongst any number of choices, or keep them all to one choice. \n\nExamples shown in this vote are:\n- A holder with multiple Doodles, splitting up their voting power equally amongst options #1-3. (10 Doodles total, inputting 10 on all 3 options)\n- A holder with one Doodle, splitting up their voting power equally amongst options #4-5. (1 Doodle total, inputting 1 on all 2 options)\n- A holder with one Doodle, using their voting power on option #6. (1 Doodle total, inputting 1 on 1 option)\n- Option #7 receiving no votes.\n\nNotes: \n- You are only able to allocate the amount of Doodles you own or have delegated to you. For example, a holder with 10 Doodles total can split their allocation of 10 votes, but cannot allocate 11. (will receive an error)\n- You will always be voting with all your Doodles. For example, a holder with 10 Doodles will still use all 10 to vote even if they only allocate 1.",

      "title": "[FINAL] Doodlebank Amendment",
      "content": "**Discourse**: https://forum.doodles.app/t/the-doodlebank-amendment/2386\n\n#### **Proposal**:\n* Yes, amend the Doodlebank\n* Do not amend\n\n#### **TL;DR**:\n* Appointing a founding community council and commit to establishing council governance\n    * Improve oversight of Doodlebank\n    * Responsible for community budget planning and proposal vetting.\n    * Responsible for communication with the community on Doodlebank progress.\n    * Accountable for rewards program roadmap planning\n    * Informed on the product roadmap\n* Nomination of the Doodle Watch\n    * Attend Community Council meetings\n    * Monitor the council’s activities and ensure alignment with Doodles goals and values\n    * Provide feedback and recommendations to Doodle’s team based on observations\n    * Support community outreach and communication from council\n* Removing the $100k commercial license cap for revenues derived from projects executed under the approved Doodlebank proposals.\n* Replace snapshot proposal voting with community council and Doodles team approval\n* Align incentives between holders and the Doodles core team to distribute Doodlebank funds strategically\n* Remove quorum requirements\n\n#### **The Amendment**:\nA year and a half ago, three friends launched Doodles on Ethereum as an NFT project. Together we’ve reached hundreds of millions of people, deployed our technology on multiple blockchains, and made Doodles one of the most colorful and joyful brands in the world.\nThe original Doodlebank objectives were to fund both the growth of the Doodles team and the growth of the Doodles brand via community experiments. As a small team without outside investments, this was incredibly helpful.\nWe initially deposited 420 ETH into the Doodlebank and to date, half of royalties paid from secondary sales of the OG Doodles collection on Opensea have been deposited in the Doodlebank. Today, the Doodlebank holds Ether with a present value of ~$5 million USD, that awaits deployment!\nAs Doodles has evolved since we embarked on this journey together, so must the Doodlebank. We are incredibly excited about the changes outlined here for the Doodlebank. Together, these new and refreshed Doodlebank practices look to meet the needs of our collectors and the broader Doodles community and facilitate our ambitious long-term vision.\n\n#### **The Evolved Doodlebank Proposal**:\nThe pillars of this evolved Doodlebank proposal are community empowerment and holder rewards.\n\n##### **Community Empowerment**:\n###### **Events**\nThe Doodlebank will deploy capital to further our ability to connect as a community in real life. From local collector meetups to Doodles branded experiential events at culture and web3 conferences, Doodlebank funds may be distributed to help the Doodles community experience Doodles joy in person, deepen relationships and make more meaningful connections that you can take into your everyday lives.\n\n###### **Entrepreneurs**\nLike a Y Combinator or Disney Accelerator Program, the Doodlebank will become a funding resource to support collectors working to build meaningful products, stories and services for our community and the world. With an eye to ensuring that these new projects bring incremental value to collectors, where it’s appropriate, these grants may be subject to collectors receiving specialized access, pricing or other unique benefits.\nWe cannot wait to see members of our community use access to our Doodles-only funding platform to take their ideas to new heights.\n\n###### **Community Creators**\nDoodles is filled with skilled content creators who drive awareness of our brand, from organized teams like JKB and TGID to artists like NFT Sushi, Cyclo, and ArtDood. The Doodlebank will become a resource to support these creators who grow our reach.\nTo maintain value for the whole community and stay on course with our long-term goals, we want to ensure that any content that’s Doodles-branded or centered around are community are consistently considered best-in-class in terms of quality and professionalism. To help our community content creators maintain that standard and to encourage such creation, the Doodlebank will be a resource to help fund top-tier content production. This could include funding equipment to be used for content creation, or engagement of services necessary to create or promote content, like post-production engineers, social media agencies, or event planning coordinators.\nBeyond ensuring that content created by the Doodles community is best-in-class, we also feel this presents a unique opportunity for community creators to grow their creative skill sets with support from the Doodles community.\n\n##### **Rewards Program**:\nWe are building a timeless media franchise with our community at the center. Our vision requires taking a long-term approach, one where we build with our holders over time. As part of this experience, we want to make being a part of the Doodles community more valuable. With the Community Council, we will deploy Doodlebank funds to establish a roadmap for an enhanced rewards program which aim not only to create additional benefits available to Doodles holders (e.g., specialized access and discounts) but also reward Doodles holders who have held their Doodles the longest.\n\n##### **Waiver of $100k Commercial License Cap**:\nWhether it’s the creation of physical products, content or other endeavors that our community members may want to pursue, we understand that the strength and appeal of these projects may rely on community members’ abilities to exploit their own (or other community members’) Doodles. For this reason, in connection with projects borne out of approved Doodlebank proposals, the $100,000 USD cap on revenue our community members may generate from exploiting their Doodles will be waived. Our goal with waiving the revenue cap is to incentivize community members to think creatively in how to monetize their own (and potentially other Doodles’) characters and IP and empower the community to pursue opportunities which the Doodles team feels complement or strengthen its own efforts.\n\n##### **Installation of a Community Council**:\nWith the installation of a Community Council, our objectives are:\n1. To make funds easier to deploy\n2. Reduce the time needed for proposals to get approved\n3. Empower leaders in the community to steer the use of funds (i.e., creation of the Community Council)\n\nAt the outset, we envision the Community Council and its role within the Doodles community as follows:\n\n###### **Members**:\n5 positions; however, we may add to the council over time.\n\n###### **Positions**:\n1. Council Chair\n    * Serve as a liaison between the Doodles team and the Community Council\n    * Schedule bi-weekly meetings with the Doodlebank Community Council\n    * Collaborate with the community to refine proposals and share progress\n2. Treasurer\n    * Manage Doodlebank quarterly budget and reporting\n    * Oversee delivery of Doodlebank funds to proposals\n    * Report on Doodlebank royalties from funded projects\n3. Events Lead\n    * Manage the allocation of Doodlebank funds to community events\n    * Source event and program partners\n    * Develop proposals for events and programs to be reviewed by the Community Council\n4. Grants Lead\n    * Collaborate on Doodlebank grants program with the Doodles team\n    * Manage the allocation of Doodlebank funds to entrepreneurs and creators\n    * Work alongside Doodles team to develop Requests For Proposals (RFPs)\n5. Rewards Lead\n    * Collaborate on rewards program roadmap with the Doodles team\n    * Source partnership opportunities (i.e., rewards partners)\n\n###### **Responsibilities**:\nAs a council member, your responsibilities and tools will include the following:\n* Bi-weekly meetings with the Doodlebank Review Council\n* Dedicated slack channel with the chair of the Doodlebank Review Council and other Doodles team members\n* Oversight on Doodlebank allocation\n* Insight into our product roadmap\n* Collaborate with the community to refine proposals and share progress\n* Meet with and gather feedback from the community\n* Provide feedback on work in progress product, creative, and live experiences\n* Source partnership opportunities (i.e., rewards partners)\n\n    ![image](ipfs://bafkreihkvepsqay2ludjvcc2fch77c44allacwpe5hmmaztbmmc7vj5hnm)\n    \n###### **Qualifications**:\nWe’re looking for a mash-up of excellent Doodlers with:\n    * Strong belief in the strength of the community\n    * Business and operational acumen\n    * Industry-specific experience (e.g., media, entertainment, gaming, commerce, and fashion)\n    * Ability to spend ~10 hours per week on your responsibilities\n\n###### **Term**:\n6 months\n\n###### **Pay**:\nETH equivalent of $24,000 USD per term, paid monthly at the end of each month\n\n\n###### **Community Council Application Process**:\nUpon approval of this proposal, the Doodles team will open a request for Community Council submissions on the forums. Interested holders will have 7 days to submit their applications for their desired role(s). The application period will be followed by a 7-day campaign period during which we will work with the community to host spaces for candidates to campaign for their nomination. At the end of the campaign period, members of the Doodles executive team will deliberate for no more than 4 days before selecting the 5 council members. We will consider community support/championing along with each candidate’s application submission and qualifications. The success of the Community Council relies on this process being a meritocracy rather than a popularity contest and it is imperative that the campaign period does not devolve into smear campaigns. We will consider decentralizing this process in the future.\n\n###### **Doodles Team Council**:\nTo work with the Community Council, we are creating a Doodles Team Council. The Chair of the Doodles Team Council will be Austin Hurwitz. For those proposals which require Doodles Team Council approval, Austin will assemble members of the Doodles team, based on roles and subject matter expertise appropriate for the particular proposal and together with Austin, those Doodles team members will comprise the Doodles Team Council for that particular proposal.\n\n###### **Community Council & Rewards Program Efforts**:\nThe Community Council will serve as an extension of the business development team to identify partnership opportunities (and field inbound partnership opportunities from the Doodles community) that will create additional benefits available to Doodles holders (e.g., specialized access and discounts) and/or reward Doodles holders who have held their Doodles the longest. Once received or identified, the Community Council will then present these partnership opportunities to the Doodles Team Council for review and approval.\n\n##### **Proposal Submission, Budgeting and Approval Process**:\n###### **Proposal Submission**:\nDoodle holders may submit proposals to the Doodlebank discourse forum under one of our strategic pillars (Events, Entrepreneurs, Creators, Rewards).\n\n###### **Quarterly Budget Planning**:\nAt the beginning of each calendar quarter, the Community Council submits to the Doodles Team Council for approval of a proposal which includes the overall strategy and proposed budget of Doodlebank funds which may be deployed for said quarter.\n\n###### **Approvals & Reporting on Progress**:\nThe Community Council will have autonomy to approve proposals (and remit funds) for all events that do not utilize the Doodles brand beyond the name and limited signage/materials (e.g., a local Doodles meet-up). For all other proposals, the Community Council will present the same to the Doodles Team Council for review and approval. Additionally, the Community Council will hold monthly status updates for the community to discuss approved and pending proposals.\n\n###### **Community Council Proposal Review**:\nThe Community Council review incoming proposals and take one of the following paths:\n1. Approve and release funds (for specific community events)\n2. Submit the proposal to the Doodles Review Council\n3. Work with the proposer to refine the proposal before submitting to the Doodles Review Council\n4. Reject proposals that are not aligned with our strategic pillars of community empowerment and holder rewards.\n\n###### **Doodles Team Review**:\nThe Community Council will meet with the Doodles Team Council to review pending and recently approved proposals, rewards program opportunities, and community feedback bi-weekly. The Doodles Team Council will also establish a dedicated communication channel with the council for asynchronous communication. If the Doodles Team Council wishes to revoke any approval by the Community Council, the Doodles Team Council will have 5 business days to do revoke such approval and the Doodles Team Council will provide the Community Council with feedback as to why the proposal approval is being revoked.\n\n   ![image](ipfs://bafkreiahkmo3kjmcyfkywpmpl7ftzfwh3w3rpzz2fyh25wv6snzdbei5yy)\n\n##### **Election of Doodle Watch**:\nWith the election of the Doodle Watch, our objectives are:\n1. Establish the community oversight over the community council\n2. Develop a feeder program for future community council positions\n3. Ensure the community’s voice is heard in council meetings\n\n###### **Members**:\n2 positions; however, we may add to the watch over time.\n\n###### **Doodle Watch Responsibilities**:\n* Attend Community Council meetings and take notes\n* Ensure the mission and values of Doodles are being upheld\n* Communicate council’s progress to broader Doodles community\n\n###### **Term**:\n3 months\n\n###### **Pay**:\n$6,000 per term\n\n###### **Doodle Watch Election Process**:\nImmediately after selecting the Community Council, nominations will open for the Doodle Watch. Community voting will take place by snapshot after a 7-day submission window.\n\n##### **Timeline**:\n* Amendment Vote: 4/5 - 4/8\n* Community Council Submissions: 4/10 - 4/17\n* Community Council Campaign & Interview Window: 4/18 - 4/25\n* Announce Community Council Members: 5/1\n* Define quarterly budget and proposal approval process: 5/1 - 5/31\n* Doodle Watch Submissions: 5/2 - 5/5\n* Doodle Watch Voting: 5/8 - 5/20\n* Announce Doodle Watch Members: 5/21\n\n##### **Voting Info**:\n* Quorum (Stacks): 5%\n* Majority of Yes or No.\n* Abstentions count to quorum but do not affect yes/no votes.

      "content": "#### **Discourse:**\n* https://forum.doodles.app/t/establish-a-doodles-community-fund-dedicated-to-funding-community-organized-activities-for-one-another/2350\n\n#### **Proposal:**\n* Allocate max of 9.99 ETH; or\n* Do not allocate\n\n#### **Rationale:**\n* Establish a Doodles Community Fund (\"DCF\"), dedicated to funding Doodles community-organized activities (e.g. online game tournaments, IRL meetups, etc.)\n* Allocate initial funds of 9.99ETH for reimbursements (90% / 9ETH) and rewards (10% / 0.99ETH) of such activities\n* Set up and run a simple, streamlined process for organizers to access those funds while being transparent and accountable to the community\n\n#### **Timeline:**\n* 6-month \"pilot\" timeframe to deploy funds and evaluate DCF performance (e.g. how many activities were funded, members participated, etc.)\n* Based on performance, a decision will be made after 6 months to continue or discontinue the DCF (and return any remaining funds to DoodleBank if discontinued)\n* At \"run-rate\" (after 2 months ramp-up), we hope to fund at least 2 online activities + 1 IRL activity per month, totalling at least 16 events involving more than 500 participants in 6 months:\n\n|EVENTS|M1|M2|M3|M4|M5|M6|TOTAL|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|# Online|1|1.5|2|2|2|2|10.5|\n|# IRL|0.5|1|1|1|1|1|5.5|\n|# TOTAL|1.5|2.5|3|3|3|3|16|\n|ATTEND.|50|80|100|100|100|100|530|\n|COST (ETH)|0.9|1.6|1.8|1.8|1.8|1.8|9.7|\n\n#### **Goals:**\n* Our ultimate goal is a consistent calendar of activities for Doodles community members, with a good mix of online vs. IRL, geographies, interests, and overall representation\n* This proposal is designed to quickly test:\n  1. How many more activities and participants can we achieve via funding?\n  2. How can we support organizers and be transparently accountable to the community?\n* If we can achieve meaningful community impact, we hope to scale up the DCF with better tools (e.g. dashboards, pipelines, etc.) and more resources (e.g. funds, \"Activity Kits\", etc.)\n\n#### **Cost:**\nMax of 9.99ETH\n\n##### Disbursement Plan\nActivity organizers will be able to apply for funds in 3 simple steps:\n![image](ipfs://bafkreih5bzrzyomfjlzx3qhfxmys2ddsgzsvnk23gg7za6y6nfgzhmvuzi)\n\n1. Submit Application\n  * Simply submit a 3-minute Google Form\n\n2. DCF Committee Review\n  * Applications will be reviewed within 1 week\n  * Communication via Discord private channels (created by Doodles Moderators)\n  * Approved -- reimbursement upon Post-activity Submissions (below); up to 20% upfront\n  * Rejected -- give feedback, e.g. organization, budget, and impact considerations\n\n3. Post-activity Submissions\n  * Reasonable records and/or receipts for expenditures to be reimbursed\n  * Brief activity report (simple Google Form) w/ collected metrics (e.g. duration, attendees, etc.)\n  * Sufficient completion of an optional participant survey\n  * For transparency, this info will be made available (with privacy protection) to the community\n\n#### **Accountability:**\n* A DCF Committee will administer the DCF according to the Disbursement Plan above\n* During the pilot, it will consist of the following volunteers: Mushy, Doodles Mods, and CKT (note: as volunteers, Committee members will receive NO COMPENSATION from the DCF)\n* Administrative work of setting up and driving the application and review processes will be done primarily by CKT as community representative\n* Mushy and Doodles Mods will provide oversight and review input to ensure adherence to processes and engender community trust\n* Funds will be held in a dedicated DCF wallet controlled only by Mushy as custodian\n* DCF disbursements & results will be made public to the Doodles community on a regular basis\n\n#### **Voting Info:**\n* Quorum (Duffel Bags): 5%\n* Majority of Yes or No.\n* Abstentions count to quorum but do not affect yes/no votes.\n\nFor more details, please see the full proposal here: [Doodles Community Fund // Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uCUGAT1ovZSCQzw-MlfEjVypDU1Svmix-2goIvKKcpw/edit#heading=h.7g53ca9i9v5p)\n",

(Sandbox, Otherside and Decentraland DAO)\n\nFull Portfolio www.aaronleupp.com/3D\n\nMake Doodles NFTs linked Wearable playable skins across all Metaverses (Sandbox, Decentraland, OthersideMeta) and more which will make it the first multiple Metaverse platform linked wearable NFT collection in the space. Can also be called “multi-meta linked NFTs” for short.\n\nMake Doodles NFTs linked Wearables across all Metaverses (Sandbox, Decentrand, OthersideMeta) and more which will make Doodles the first multi-meta linked wearable NFTs. Have AaronLeupp.eth and his team create a full body 3D master molds of all 10,000 Doodle NFT’s that can be given to each holder for their personal use as well as modified version to be playable and used in OthersideMeta as well as alternative modified versions to fit within the Decentraland and Sandbox guidelines so that they also can be utilized within all three Metaverses.\n\nWhy?\nNot only will this bring more massive utility to all Doodle NFTs by making them the first multi-metaverse linked wearable NFTs making them playable and useable across all three of the top metaverses, and also the raw file so they can use on their own personal projects and ventures. This will also set the correct course example on the destiny of what NFTs could have meant to go towards all along. Almost all of us know by now that one of the founders of Ethereum got motivated by the creation of it based on his negative experience in the unapproved modification of a World of Warcraft in game item can be seen here: www.polygon. com/22709126/ethereum-creator-world-of-warcraft-nerf-nft-vitalik-buterin\n\nWhats in it for DoodleBank and all holders?\nThis will give the NFT owner not only defense against modification against their Doodle IP in game but also true ownership that can be utilized in hopefully down the road in all platforms, games, and Metaverses that continue to spawn years to come. It will also be great defense against fraudulent items and wearables in other Metavereses because they will be linked to the Doodle NFT only, and all can be transferred to a new owner if they wish to sell the Doodle NFT at any time.\n\nWhy are we the team to do it?\nAside from my team and I creating all the full body 3D molds and rigs for each of the 10,000 unique Doodle NFTs I will be personally working through the logistics and campaigning to get all VP votes needed in the Decentraland DAO, YugaLabs for OtherSide, and the Sandbox team to join us in this pioneering venture to complete our mission. As can see already I have experience in this space by getting my teams latest $60,000 grant passed with over 2,000,000 VP and 135+ yes votes from the Decentraland community!\nwww.governance.decentraland. org/proposal/?id=7431b280-c69a-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1)\n\nWith our teams, previous experience with our Disney Quality 3D Princess Feature film we have learned a lot. Not only about all the different creation process’s and programs like blender and Unreal engine we have also took on and achieved the advance hair and fur movement features that most 3D models do not have because they are very advance and time consuming to create. We also innovated the space by utilizing techniques Disney has not even used before in any of their 3D Princess movies such as tears, dirt and mud reacting and rubbing off on the skin when they get up. All this can be viewed in our latest teaser trailer video here:\n\nOpen to all debates and questions.\n\nCan see our old proposal from 7 months ago too for more details here: Make Doodles Multi-meta linked wearable NFTs (OtherSide, Sandbox, Decentraland)) across all Metaverses\n\nThanks again!\n\n-Aaron Leupp\nhttps://twitter.com/AaronLeupp\n",

      "content": " \n![doodle2.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreieipt5gch3edqw7fmdgxmf2yacythohk4yfupwrvhhs5335l7vdma)\n     \n![doodle1.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreiaqcpx2tb4j23uaejnch3jaswvgklte52i7zxudruvttkyfilx4ue)\n    \nhttp://www.aaronleupp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/doodles3d2-copy.jpg\n\ntry #2 \n\nMake Doodles NFTs linked Wearable playable skins across all Metaverses (Sandbox, Decentraland, OthersideMeta) and more which will make it the first multiple Metaverse platform linked wearable NFT collection in the space. Can also be called “multi-meta linked NFTs” for short.\n\nMake Doodles NFTs linked Wearables across all Metaverses (Sandbox, Decentrand, OthersideMeta) and more which will make Doodles the first multi-meta linked wearable NFTs. Have AaronLeupp.eth and his team create a full body 3D master molds of all 10,000 Doodle NFT’s that can be given to each holder for their personal use as well as modified version to be playable and used in OthersideMeta as well as alternative modified versions to fit within the Decentraland and Sandbox guidelines so that they also can be utilized within all three Metaverses.\n\nWhy?\nNot only will this bring more massive utility to all Doodle NFTs by making them the first multi-metaverse linked wearable NFTs making them playable and useable across all three of the top metaverses, and also the raw file so they can use on their own personal projects and ventures. This will also set the correct course example on the destiny of what NFTs could have meant to go towards all along. Almost all of us know by now that one of the founders of Ethereum got motivated by the creation of it based on his negative experience in the unapproved modification of a World of Warcraft in game item can be seen here: www.polygon.com/22709126/ethereum-creator-world-of-warcraft-nerf-nft-vitalik-buterin\n\nWhats in it for DoodleBank and all holders?\nThis will give the NFT owner not only defense against modification against their Doodle IP in game but also true ownership that can be utilized in hopefully down the road in all platforms, games, and Metaverses that continue to spawn years to come. It will also be great defense against fraudulent items and wearables in other Metavereses because they will be linked to the Doodle NFT only, and all can be transferred to a new owner if they wish to sell the Doodle NFT at any time.\n\nWhy are we the team to do it?\nAside from my team and I creating all the full body 3D molds and rigs for each of the 10,000 unique Doodle NFTs I will be personally working through the logistics and campaigning to get all VP votes needed in the Decentraland DAO, YugaLabs for OtherSide, and the Sandbox team to join us in this pioneering venture to complete our mission. As can see already I have experience in this space by getting my teams latest $60,000 grant passed with over 2,000,000 VP and 135+ yes votes from the Decentraland community!\nwww.governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=7431b280-c69a-11ec-90c9-11bf3c6f4ca1)\n\nWith our teams, previous experience with our Disney Quality 3D Princess Feature film we have learned a lot. Not only about all the different creation process’s and programs like blender and Unreal engine we have also took on and achieved the advance hair and fur movement features that most 3D models do not have because they are very advance and time consuming to create. We also innovated the space by utilizing techniques Disney has not even used before in any of their 3D Princess movies such as tears, dirt and mud reacting and rubbing off on the skin when they get up. All this can be viewed in our latest teaser trailer video here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2vwwwKnJWg\n\nAs stated before this is not just a process of making 10,000 unique 3D molds. It will have to be a process of making that times 4 to be modified to fit all Metaverse guidelines and vibe as well as the master quality mold for personal usage. For example, our 3D princess character molds have the highest quality interactive strains of hair as can be seen, but for a game like Decentraland they may require a more limited mold as they also limit the number of polygons and triangles per wearable as well as restrictive interactive movement. Thus, we must pivot the hair also not be as interactive and more stable on the character as it moves like this:\n\nwww.youtube .com/watch?v=9tiY1dGa20c&ab_channel=AaronLeupp\n\nor this:\n\nwww.youtube. com/watch?v=9RiZbdTajsw&ab_channel=AaronLeupp\n\nWhile in Sandbox they also require a cube style mold as an example can be seen here:\n\nwww.twitter.com/TheSandboxGame/status/1518124730930417665\n\nHere are also some examples of Decentraland Wearables we have made in the past:\nwww.aaronleupp.com/free-nfts/\n\nAs well as several Decentraland Events we put on:\n\nwww.youtube .com/watch?v=ETgkhyoo68Q&ab_channel=AaronLeupp\nwww.youtube. com/watch?v=q0uB2ls0aDE&ab_channel=AaronLeupp\nwww.youtube. com/watch?v=7H-ntwQPnZs&ab_channel=AaronLeupp\n\nTimeline | Relevant timing details, including but not limited to start date, milestones, and completion dates\n\nOur timeline would be 6 steps for entire process however it is very possible we can deliver a lot sooner.\n-Step 1 would be several demos to show the Doodlebank and community to choose from for approval.\n-Step 2 would be creation of all highest quality 3D unique molds for all 10,000 Doodle NFTs\n-Step 3 Would be modifications and asset recreations for Decentraland and Otherside Meta as well as rigging.\n-Month 4 Sandbox mold and asset creation for all 10,000 Doodlebank NFTs as well as rigging and implementing as well as any other catching up needed from previous steps.\n\nOverall Cost | The total cost to implement the proposal.\n$19 est per 3D mold and per 3D mold for each metaveese for each doodle \n(if all doodles owners everyone wants this) \nor $49 est per 3D mold and per 3D mold for each metaverse for each doodle \n(if only 200 to 9,000  doodle owners want this) \nor $69 est per 3D mold and per 3D mold for each metaverse for each doodle \n(if only 100 to 200 doole owners want this) \n\n-Payment also will also not be released until after proof of work is finished. \n33% will be sent after step 2 then 33% after step 3 and 34% after step 4. \n\nWhy so cheap?\nYes, when you google “how much does 3D character cost” first result comes up with $4,000 to $6,000 per character and with 10,000 characters isn’t that $40,000,000 to $60,000,000 and making that times 4 (master file, Outerworlds, Decentraland, Sandbox) would make it more $160,000,000 to $240,000,000 not only $1,900,000?! This is true however with our years of experience, 3D rendering algorithms and millions of dollars spent on our current 3D Feature Film as have learned a lot that we can pass onto this project which will cut costs dramatically while also bringing the highest quality.\n\nCan I vote yes since I want Doodles to be the first MultiMeta linked wearable NFTs, but still demand an alternative budget then what you guys are asking?\nYes! Go ahead and vote yes and in the comments, write a budget or deal you prefer so we on our end can try our best to make it work. We are willing to work with pretty much any type of alternative structure of funding of a deal with cash flow of $1 to $100,000,000 even if it comes at a loss for us. Why would we do that? As stated several times we feel this will be the future of NFT utility and we want the opportunity to work with what I continue to see being one of the top leaders in the space as well as proof of concept to the world, and of course we want to be a part of that process since we forecast it will lead to us being the supplier to all other NFT collections as well. My main concerns are #1 highest quality delivery to you all Doodle holders, #2 Making sure my team makes a wage for all the hard work and massive number of hours they will spend helping us achieve this delivery and #3 if there are any profits it will go to continue to fund our current venture of our 3D Princess Feature Film. If it ends up I don’t make anything on this to make it happen, all is good, I am pretty much use to it anyway since already invested almost all my personal funds I have made over the years anyway on our own 3D Princess Film project so defiantly use to it already lol. Call it cringe or woke I understand lol, as Mexican American growing up watching us continued to be the last ones not represented in this space tired of waiting around for Disney to do it so we decided to do it ourselves.\n\nFREE Gift #1 If passes to every Doodle, Dooplicator, and Space Doodle Owner will also get 1 additional FREE Doodle Cat Pet to follow them around in Decentraland and other Metaverses. And **100% of all royalties of sales of these will go back into the Doodlebank DAO if can mint them from the DAO address or if need us to mint from our address and pay back monthly revenue back to DAO then can give 90% to Doodlebank and 10% can go to us for adding and sending monthly revenue to Doodlebank DAO.\n\n1 Unique Cat pet wearable NFT will go to one holder randomly\n10 Mythic Cat pet wearable NFTs will go to the top 10 holders randomly.\n100 Legendary Cat pet wearable NFTs will go to the 100 doodle holders randomly.\n100,000 Common Cat pet Wearable NFTs will go to all holders.\n\nwww.aaronleupp .com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ezgif-2-8c3d3f889a.gif\nwww.aaronleupp .com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ezgif-2-f3acc715d5.gif\n\nwww.decentraland .org/blog/announcements/collecting-rare-items-in-decentraland/\n\nFREE Gift #2 We will be creating a custom Waifumon NFT for everyone that VOTES YES (First 10,000) if passes as thanks, can be based on their Doodle, Space Doodles, Dooplicator or anything they want. There will get a 1 of 1 shiny and also 6,000 non-shiny for them to give out to their friends or sell if they want. Waifumon collection currently 2nd largest in the world with over 102,000+ owners.\n\nShiny example: www.opensea. io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/25301351943351891415725927464477484049512317528648331027932693935476705329842\nNon shiny example: www.opensea. io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/25301351943351891415725927464477484049512317528648331027932693936576216963828\nCollection is 104,000+ owners: www.opensea.io/collection/polygonpresalewaifumon\n\nI am still looking for a reason to say no to this but can’t find any reason why. Can I just say it’s because I just don’t like, and hate your face?\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=M3lGKMXYOG8&ab_channel=ryfaceply\n\n“Ok, ok all I can do is take that in, conceder it and I will just try to do my best version of whatever I think that will be.”\n\nEnd of Pitch\nAgain, we are open to all debates, criticism, feedback, counters and thoughts since we would love to be a part of such a pioneering venture as this, and also would really love to continue to prove ourselves to you all in hopes we can also get the opportunity to expand our team and take on doing the same with all of the other top NFT collections as well. For those that looked up the URL we posted above with the list of Decentraland wearables we already made can see we have been pioneering some of the first pet wearables in that Metaverse, and would love to do that as well for the Doodle Cat NFTs, but we understand we must start things out one step at a time. We also really hope this idea comes to life regardless if choosing us to execute it or not since sounds like a ton of fun. So, if so or not, regardless thanks again for this opportunity in pitching this idea to this Doodlebank DAO!\n\nwww.aaronleupp.com/3D\nwww.twitter.com/aaronleupp\n\nIf none of the URLs work all can be seen here too!:",

The individuals approving requests and requirements around requests are subject to change if necessary and interested contributors may reach out to Ayhth and Mushy.\n\n**Timeline**: Allocated budget and $DOODLE from NFTx will be kept in the wallet controlled by Doodles’s Project Manager (Community), Mushy, and will stay there until requests are approved.\n\n**Goal**: Expand the possible uses of Doodlebank with experimentation focused on appreciating and celebrating the community. As the team moves forward and hopes for a decentralized Doodlebank, this will serve as a stepping stone to allow more out-of-the-box community uses.\n\n**Cost**: Total of 50 ETH\n* 10~ ETH allocated for a Doodle to be submitted into NFTx.\n* 40~ ETH flexibly allocated for community proposed activations, activities, contests, dust, etc.\n\n**Accountability**: Funds will be under the custodian of the Doodles’s Project Manager (Community), Mushy.

      "content": "TL;DR\nSeeking to approve a budget of 25 ETH:\n10 ETH to fund community contests prizes and contractors.\n15 ETH to create Doodle dust as rewards for:\nA. Rewarding proposal champions and their teams for successful implementation.\nB. Tip jar for community event organizers, content creators and artists (monthly, community-nominated)\n\nDetails:\n10 ETH BUDGET\n\n1. Fund community contests prizes and contractors (adhoc)\n\nGoal: Farm vibes. Increase meaningful participation and engagement in the community.\n\nProposals for contests and activations need not pass through DB as long as approved by @Mushy / Discord Mod Team\nSimilar to Lore Wars contest, upcoming Doodles Music cover art contest.\n\nRationale:\nWith funds pre-approved in this proposal, we can move fast and encourage regular contests. Removes current barriers such as finding resources, preparing proposals and passing the snapshot vote.\n\nGovernance:\n\nNew ETH wallet managed by @Mushy (Doodlebank manager) with wallet address made known to the community.\nContractor payments to be made known via #updates (same thread as founder and royalty payments)\n15 ETH BUDGET\n\n2. Create Doodles Dust wallet for A) Rewards and B) Tip jar\n\nUsed to purchase 15ETH of DOODLE tokens from NFTX.io 4 vault Buy - NFTX App\nApproximately 1 DOODLE to be used for Doodles dust rewards (1st experiment)\n\nFractionalized based on t-shirt sizing shorthand (approximate eth value):\n\nRationale:\nValuable, on-brand rewards and incentives to encourage community participation in building the brand. Doodlebank has been quiet for a while, this is an experiment to sustain meaningful activity.\n\nGovernance:\n\nManaged by @Mushy with wallet address made public to the community (same wallet as ETH).\nShould the experiment succeed, future DOODLE tokens to be held in Gnosis multisig wallet with cosigners consisting of mods or community members in various timezones.\n\n2A. Reward Doodlebank proposal champions and their teams\nBuilding on a past proposal by Mushy: Doodle Dust as Incentives 3\n\nGoal: Reward proposal execution and incentivize quality proposals in Doodlebank.\n\nSimultaneously execute DB guidelines refinement and forum clean-up.\n\nProposal champions to prepare proposals, now with ‘briefs’ and suggested categories.\nBriefs to be prepared with Doodles team, based on key activation themes and Doodles calendar of events/releases and published in Discord and DB.\nUpdate DB guidelines to have suggested categories and no-go areas.\nAvoid ‘no-go’ areas (such as proposal for Doodle tokens, or derivative collections).\nArchive in-active or outdated proposals to remove forum noise.\nRewards are distributed in 2 stages.\n\n\n2B. Tip jar for community organizers, content creators and artists\n\nMonthly distributions, community nominated, mod accessed and approved.\nThe team as well as community members can nominate folks to be tipped in an activity channel on discord #tipjar.\nThe moderator team will review nominations, and make sizing determinations (usually XS to M)\nMushy will make transfers of Doodles Dust to individual wallets.\nUpdated in #Updates as well as News stand.\n\nTipping examples:\n- Organizers of online or IRL events (including contests) that have benefitted a number of doodlers.\n- Volunteers for official online or IRL events.\n- Content creators that have created specific content (art, articles, tweets, videos, twitter spaces) that has positive brand impact.\n- Builders / devs that build on top of Space Doodles, licensed properties.\n- Individuals or agents that bring valuable licensing/cross-licensing opportunities.\n- Talent referrals: bringing talent into the Doodles ecosystem for building or promotion (i.e. Team hires a developer you introduced. Your friend who’s a celebrity bought a Doodle on your recommendation)\n- Super-helpful Doodlebank supporters who provide the right amount of dissent and constructive opinions.\n- Doodles newsletter contributors.\nExcludes commissioned works / commerical works paid for by others.\n\nUncoloreddood is an example of community artist that helps grow the brand and vibes:\n![uncoloreddood.jpeg](ipfs://QmdLrPBvkZM5htB8LycAaYtphREaodtvxtgJk1JvjhmYsa)",

      "content": "[Doodlebank Discussion] https://forum.doodles.app/t/team-scaling-proposal-v2/1871\n\nThe next chapter has begun and we’re incredibly excited to continue building best-in-class experiences for our collectors and fans with the vision to bring Doodles into the homes of millions.\n\nWe’ve flexed our muscles with the release of Space Doodles showing the world what we’re capable of with a lean team. It’s time to scale that up and build Doodles for the masses. Here are this year’s NFT-track focused problems we’d like to solve,\n\n- Create a mainstream NFT purchasable with a credit card that is cross-licensed from our collectors’ Doodles. We become responsible for building the platform, collectors experience, and demand. Collectors license their Doodle to us so that we can create/sell officially licensed derivatives (as an example) on their behalf. Collectors earn a share of the revenue.\n\n- Establish the lore of Doodles and take advantage of cross-media opportunities to bring Doodles in front of millions\nIncredibly amazing Space Doodles experience that is additive to #1 and solves its tragedy of the commons problem through economy design and intelligent sinks\n\n- Upgrade without dilution v2 - a friendly vampire attack on the entire NFT ecosystem to make everyone a member of our universe in a way that adds direct value to Doodlers and avoids dilution\n\n- Legal trademarking and copyright filing, defense and enforcement\n\nWe aim to innovate with (3) L-XL sized products this year with the help of our developer partners and long-time blockchain partners/friends. In comparison, Space Doodles was a medium-sized (M) release.\n\nSince our initial proposal, we’ve hired the following roles to assist us in full and/or part time capacities which we’ve funded with proceeds from the team scaling v1 proposal plus our own personal income.\n\n- Animation director\n- Product designer\n- Merch manager\n- Brand strategist\n- Project manager, events\n- Sound designer\n- Project manager, doodlebank & community\n- Video engineer\n- Finance and accounting\n- General counsel\n- 3d modeler\n- 2d animator\n\nMoving forward, we’d like to add the following roles to our team with Doodlebank funds. We have candidates in mind for most roles who come from the industry and are best-in-class at what they do. Our partners will be responsible for scaling up engineering talent\n\n- Lead game designer\n- Lead token economy designer\n- Writer\n- Marketing illustrator\n- Senior 2d illustrator\n- Senior 2d vector artist\n- Senior 3d modeler\n- Senior 3d animator\n\nAsk: 690 ETH to scale the team, new additions and existing, through the end of 2022\n\nAccountability: Doodles LLC will be responsible for all hiring and operations. Funds will be held in a multi-sig wallet with Poopie/Burnt/Tulip as cosigners in a 2/3 signor policy. Payments to contractors will be monthly.",

      "content": "Doodle ID for kudos: \n#1050\n\n\nDiscourse: \nhttps://forum.doodles.app/t/onboard-educate-new-nft-users/1755/17\n\n\nRationale & Goals: \nNFT trading activity has more than doubled between July and August 2021, according to the number of unique wallets that either bought or sold an NFT. By August 2021, there were roughly 280,000 unique buyers or sellers(the source does not distinguish between the two - after a growth of 185,000 unique wallets).\n\nThe current adaptation rate for NFTs has been quite good but not the best. We have seen a lot of Celebrities & Influencers purchasing NFTs, which in turn bought in a lot of new users. But a majority of these New Users never convert to buying & selling.\n\nWhy? The major problem faced by these New Users are education & onboarding. There is no dedicated platform for NFT Education available currently. Onboarding into NFTs is already a very tough task for a lot of people due to the complexity of handling their own wallets without complete knowledge. A lot of users also fall victims to scams due to this lack of information.\n\nHow do we plan on fixing this? Enter LearnJPEG. We have designed a NFT Education platform with a lot of added utilities + benefits for learners. \n\nThe main function of our platform will be:\n• Learn & Earn - This will allow new users to enrol into NFT + Web3 courses and earn in-app coins for successfully completing the course. These courses will contain a variety of content, such as text guides, videos, podcasts & more. The course will be followed by some questions which would authenticate wether a user really learnt. On successful completion of the course, the user would receive a fixed no of coins. These coins can be converted into NFTs using our Rewards Store. All courses on our platform will be free of cost.\n\n\nTimeline: \n • Platform development has already begun & will take a time period of 4 months after which we do 1 month of beta testing and bug discovery before the release. \n• We will delivery an initial MVP product within 1.5 months of this proposal.\n\n\nCost:\n• Stacks – 7 ETH  \n• These 7 ETH will be allocated for platform development. \n• Total platform development cost is 21 ETH, out of which 14 ETH has already been secured and platform development has already begun.\n\n\nAccountability: \n• Funds will be sent from the DoodleBank to learnjpeg.eth and a transaction hash will be provided when the funds are transferred from learnjpeg.eth to the development company. All our accounting is open and can be viewed by visiting our notion. \n• Provide a platform wireframe demo to the any of our interested DOODS & provide an MVP platform within 1.5 months. \n• We are expecting a revenue of up to 40 ETH per month and will contribute 20% of this revenue to the DoodleBank each month.\n• I @0xshub on twitter will be personally liable for these funds and am willing to sign a contract for the delivery of this platform. Failing which I would pay back the 7 ETH to DoodleBank.\n\n\nOptions: \n• Approve – Move forward to bring NFT & Web3 education to the world. \n• Reject – I do not want to bring NFT & Web3 education to the world.",

      "title": "Can Doodles be first GREEN project on Ethereum?",
      "content": "\nWith great power comes great responsibility!\n\nA huge congratulations to all of us in becoming one of the most sought after projects in whole NFT community. We are getting attention from almost every big-shot in the industry & there are folks selling their BAYC/punks to go all-in to Doodles. We account success of Doodles to all the right ingredients in right proportion ranging from art, team to community.  \n\nBeing leaders in NFT space, there also comes a moral & social responsibility. We are aware of critics, every now & then, criticising blockchains due to their environmental impact by carbon emissions and Greenhouse gases. We generally turn deaf ears to their arguments or counter it by stating how blockchain is gonna change the world economy as a whole. \n\nHowever, bitter truth is, the problem is real and grave. To give you a rough idea, every successful transaction on Ethereum blockchain emits ~100kg of carbon in the environment & electricity consumed by it could have powered a US household for 8 days ( https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption ). There are proposals for a brighter future with POS and other optimisations but a lot of emissions have been done already and ‘A LOT’ are yet to be done. If we look at solely our project, we have emitted ~3000 tonnes of Carbon in the environment so far. \nTo counter the environmental impact, the least we can do at this stage is to nullify carbon emissions by promoting carbon preserving projects (renewable energy, solar, bio-mass etc)  & afforestation. \n\nVCS (voluntary carbon standard) is one such mechanism to achieve it. Almost every big company/MNC emitting carbon nullifies the impact by retiring equivalent VCS in the carbon registries ( http://www.perillon.com/blog/12-companies-that-are-buying-carbon-offsets) . We can start doing similar activities as part of BSR (Blockchain Social Responsibility I call it) for on-chain projects.\n \nPrima-facie, the responsibility to make particular project/smart contract green lies with project’s founders and communities.  Doodles community can setup a benchmark in the industry by becoming first GREEN project on Ethereum blockchain. \n\nHow can we achieve that?\nThere are certain carbon credit tokens already trading on-chain which can be utilised to achieve the same. Doing it in a decentralised first manner, we need to create a smart contract which takes input of these carbon credits and ‘burns’ them against particular project (Doodle in our case). Also, creating dashboards on top of that will help us in tracking emissions, green % and other metrics for projects. \n\nSo here I’m doing my bit for environment preservation and proposing to take pledge (not any money) from community if I should work on this and if Doodle community is gonna support to become 1st GREEN PROJECT by nullifying the carbon emissions?\n\nWanna discuss more? Hit me up @cryptonoob#4807\n\nThanks for reading through all of this. More power to Doodlers!\n",

      "content": "Doodle ID for Kudos: #9054 and #7525\n\nDiscourse: https://forum.doodles.app/t/the-pixel-doodles/1408\n\nRationale:  Our project proposal is a non-dilutive upgrade to integrate Doodles into the Worldwide Webb3 (www3) pixel metaverse.  This is NOT a derivative collection or mint; but rather, a proposal to provide a pixel art avatar and animation based on your Doodle’s existing properties and rarity.  The ability to play as your Doodle in the pixel metaverse will provide a new medium to engage in and bring a deeper connection to your Doodle.  Further, the Doodles brand will gain additional recognition within the Web3 space and be positioned to capitalize on future opportunities within this metaverse.\n\nTimeline: March 2022\n\nObjective:\n•\tIntegrate Doodles into the www3 metaverse as a playable pixel avatar for the entire 10k collection\n•\tProduce spritesheets to generate the in-game walking animations needed for integration\n•\tProvide a location to download your Doodle’s static images and animated gifs for use in social media platforms and personal creations such as Discord emojis or Twitter Banners (images will be provided as a sprite and high-resolution version)\n\nCost: \n•\tRacks – Up to 25 ETH total budget\n•\tEstimated 15 ETH allocated for design, animation, and project management\n•\tEstimated 10 ETH budget allocated for programming and miscellaneous expenses \n•\tFormal budget will be finalized prior to final approval\n\nAccountability:\n•\tFunds will be transferred into a gnosis multisig wallet controlled by core team\n•\tETH allocated for project team will be provided over several phases as designated objectives are completed\n•\tETH allocated for outsourcing will be requested upon entering engagements\n•\tOur final design decisions will require approval from the core team to maintain their vision and product quality\n\nOptions:\n•\tApprove – Move forward to bring Doodles into the pixel metaverse\n•  Reject – I do not want Pixel Doodles\n",

This proposal only reimburses for the necessary 137.63 ETH for quickly putting together the events of Miami Art Basel.\n* The Founders saw Miami Art Basel as an opportunity to showcase the entertainment, art, and fashion potential of the web3 space and moved quickly to do so.\n* Although unclear ROI and large expenditure, the Founders are confident that the Doodles have since secured a significant spot in history as an example of Web3 x Web2.\n\n**Moving Forward**: \n* The team intends on proactively approving budget proposals rather than retroactively proposing reimbursements.\n\n**Timeline**: As approved. \n\n**Goal**: To show significant and standout presence in Miami Art Basel as a NFT Project as well as a Web3 Entertainment Company.\n\n**Cost**: 137.63 ETH\n\n**Accountability**: Doodles LLC is responsible for any and all of its unapproved spending. This proposal is to reimburse some of the cost that the Founders have fronted to prepare and host immediate events.

      "content": "Doodle ID for Kudos: #9399\n\n**Discourse**: https://forum.doodles.app/t/adjusting-prelim-quorum-and-snapshot-voting-duration/1341\n\n**Vote**: \n* Reduce Preliminary Vote Quorum from 15% to 10%, and\n* Increase Voting Period from 2 days to 3 days.\n* Implement no changes\n\n**Rationale**:\n* With the constant moving of hands and attention in the NFT Space, the Doodlebank has shown growing pains of not reaching quorum for both highly and lowly discussed proposals.\n* Reducing preliminary vote quorum from 15% to 10% and increasing the duration of a vote from 2 days to 3 days will help remedy current growing pains as we adapt and develop the system further.\n\n**Moving forward**: \n* Guidelines/rules for proposals directly addressing the system will be developed.\n* Awareness and use of the system will continue to be worked on.\n* Snapshot Saturdays will be internally started with expectations of proposal writers to be in active communication with myself to best organize their releases.\n\n**Timeline**: Ongoing until further changes.\n\n**Goal**: To alleviate current growing pains of the Doodlebank and allow more thinkers to create value in their ideas and push them forward.\n\n**Cost**: 0 ETH\n\n**Accountability**: As the Project Manager (Community), it is my role to better our current system around the Doodlebank and adjust to what the team and I believe is necessary. Final proposals still require approval from the team to prevent any abuse of the system.\n\n**Vote Info**:\n- Quorum (Undeveloped, Systematic Proposals): 15%\n- Options: Yes to both changes or No to both changes.",

      "content": "tl;dr\nPukenzas have passed the preliminary proposal phase! Thanks everyone! We want to give all Doods the opportunity to claim a free (+ gas) Pukenza generative artwork by @L3xc\n\nBackground on Pukenza\nA member of the Doodles community, Lim (a.k.a. @L3xc), is a very talented generative artist and developer at WestCoastNFT, the company that did the smart contract work for Doodles. Inspired by Tyler Hobbs’ article about Flow Field and Fidenza, he decided to play with those concepts and combine them with the Doodles color palette to create a really cool generative art piece called “Rainbow Puke over the Flow Field,” now lovingly known as “Pukenza.” The original proposal for Pukenza was so popular and received so much support that we passed the preliminary Snapshot with flying pukey colors! Since then, Lim has continued to work hard at developing the art, refining the outputs, and doing all the little technical things that need to be done in order for us to all be able to receive our beautiful Pukenzas!\n\nWhy Pukenza?\nThis art is awesome and it would be a nice little treat to Doodle holders whilst rewarding an artist that is deeply involved with the Doodles community!\n\nHow will this be delivered?\n@L3xc and @WestCoastNFT will deliver the Pukenza via https://degenartclub.com/\n\nWen Pukenza mint:\n4-6 Weeks\n\nThis time will allow for:\n- Polishing the algorithm for the generative art\n- Testing outputs\n- Smart contract + website preparation\n\nYou can find frequent updates on the project in Lim's Degen Art Club Discord server: https://discord.gg/csh7FGjcMm\n\nDid you vote on the preliminary snapshot? If you did, you can claim a fun Pukenza Voter POAP which will also make you eligible to enter a raffle to win one of ten custom Pukenzas by @L3xc himself!\n\nMore info on the POAP and raffle here: https://forum.doodles.app/t/poaps-for-votes/1274\n\nBudget: Stacks\n\nCost: 4.20 ETH total\n- 3ETH to L3xc for artwork (address: L3xc.eth)\n- 1.2 ETH to WestcoastNFT for smart contract development + contract deployment gas fee + website development (address: 0xwest)\n- 7.5% royalty on secondary sales\n- 5% going to L3xc\n- 2.5% going to Doodlebank\n\nAccountability:\n- funds will be transferred into gnosis multisig with tulip/burnt/poopie as cosigners in a 4/5\npolicy\n- funds will be paid out on delivery of completed timeline found in this final proposal\n\nLinks:\nNew proposal discussion: https://forum.doodles.app/t/pukenza-airdrop-for-doods/367\nPreliminary proposal (snapshot):\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/doodles.eth/proposal/0x0c8179316680c90dc6f7ef131b3e4c21c7eb42e502c7273bac9581e8e2bf95e4\nThanks for reading this, and thank you for the continued support\n- Jer #276",

Proposals will only be posted to Discord once they surpass X votes\n2. Alerts will be posted multiple times (at start, before ending)\n3. Twitter notification as well\nThis will come at the low low cost of 1 ETH, including development, hosting, support and enhancements. \n\nOption 3\nDo nothing. The current process is fine. ",

Create a Doodles companion for NFT newcomers and existing Doodle holders\n2. Fund the Doodlebank Treasury for its vision and goals\n\nGoal: \nCreate a community of 5,555 Noodles, with 833 (15%) free mints reserved for Doodlers. Commit 20% of initial primary sales to the Doodlebank. Set the precedent in which derivatives should be created and the manner that they are perceived in. \n\nCost: Expected net positive to the Doodlebank after revenues from primary sales.\n\n-0 ETH out of Doodlebank\n+47.2 ETH into Doodlebank (if all Noodles are sold)\n \nTimeline:\nTentative launch date: December 13th - 17th, 2021\nLaunch date is to be determined and publicly announced to the community and Founders at least 3 days in advance.\n\nWe have high confidence in this timeline because,\n1. Art & Noodle traits are completed, but we are always open to improvements and tweaks to reflect Noodles community culture in Noodles Discord.\n2. Website is completed with working minting functionality.\n3. Smart Contracts are completed and tested on Testnet and on OS.\n \nLaunch Plan:\nThere are a total of 5,555 Noodles and the price will be 0.05 ETH.\nNoodles will commit 20% of primary sales revenue to Doodlebank & 833 free mints for Doodle holders who have claimed the ‘Free Mint’ role in our Discord. An allocated 1,000 general whitelists will proceed to mint the following day and the remaining Noodles will be held for general sale after. \n\nMinting will take place over the course of 2 days,\nDay 1: Doodler’s Day \n- 833 (15% of supply) reserved free mints (1 mint per wallet, 20 hours to claim)\n- Reserve 50 Noodles for future marketing and promotions\n\nDay 2: Noods’ Day \n- 1,000 Whitelisted Noodle members (between 1-3 mints per, 12 hours to claim)\n- Up to 3,672 general public sale (# of mints TBD) \n\nReveal (4 hours after start of general public sale)\n\nCommunity & Marketing :\nDoodle-side \n1. Tweet about @Noodles_NFT after the final proposal passes as the first community supported derivative\nDoodles\n2. Retweet (2) promos and giveaways in the lead up for launch\npublicly announce the mint in Discord\n3. Create a ‘derivatives’ channel in Discord highlighting Noodles + art\n4. Raffle off free Noodle mint’s in Discord\n\nNoodle-side\n1. Giveaway (1) Doodles NFT\n2. Run interactive competitions for outreach and community building\n\nAccountability: \nEthan is responsible for the organization of the community, Justin is responsible for back-end and smart contract security, Fidel is responsible for front-end website development with integration for smart contract mint functionality. Revenue earned from the project will be secured and managed with a multi-sig Gnosis wallet. 20% primary sales revenue to the Doodlebank is hard-coded into the smart contract to ensure the safety of funds and will be audited by Poopie. Sales phases will be rigorously tested on Rinkeby with the Doodles core team prior to launch.",

      "content": "Doodle ID for unusually bias kudos: #474\nDoodle ID for usually bia kudos: #1920\n\nDiscourse: https://forum.doodles.app/t/spookle-unofficial-doodrivative-proposal/672/\n\nRationale: \nWe were inspired by Doodles to create our own quirky and spooky take on the Doodleverse. The Halloween project sparked a passion in us to create more and also give back to the Doodle community which has inspired and encouraged us. Spookles is our genesis collection of 300 1:1s and we hope to receive the 'Unofficial Doodrivative' badge. In return, we will share 3% royalties to Doodlebank and provide 30 free mints to Doodlers!\n\nBenefits to doods:\n1. 240 WL reserved for Doodles owners.\n2. 30 free mints raffle for the 240 doodles White-listers.\n3. If demand is high, we might have a public raffle for doodler slots.\n4. Doodlers will also get WL access to future non-doodles, derivative projects our team works on.\n\nTimeline: If we meet the minimum quorum and receive majority vote, we will be waiting for the founders' feedback. \n\nAt the moment we have:\nThe art 85% ready\nThe website + the minting system 90%\nThe community wallet 100% ready\n\nInformation: 300, 1 of 1 Spookles NFTs\n240 WL Mints - Verified Doodle owners\n50 WL Mints - Spookles community members\n10 Mints - Spookles staff + giveaways\n\nMint Price : 0.09ETH + gas \n\nMint proceeds:\n- 50% To grow our community (Marketing, Giveaways, Charity) \n- 50% Project Team / Mint Functions / Websites\n\n10% Royalties will be allocated to: \nDoodleBank - 3% \nCommunity Wallet - 7% (Of which 5% will go into buying of Doodles from Secondary Market to give back to Spookles holders)\n\nGoal: We absolutely love Burnt Toast's art and the Doodles Community! We want to invite doodlers into the Spookles Community. Our future NFT collections will be our own original art and Spookles holders as well as Doodlers will have special access.\n\nCost: We created 300 unique hand-drawn pieces in our free time and for that, no investment is required from Doodlebank. We used our savings to pay for the minting and website features. Our most desired thing is the love from the community and that magical 'Unofficial Doodrivative' badge.\n\nAccountability: We would love to receive feedback and advise from the founders and the Doodles community. The Spookles community is also actively involved in how we work. We the founders (usually bia, unusually bias, ordinary and typical), will hold custody of the community wallet with standard DAP protocol, voting, multi-sig approval.",

All proceeds go to GiveDirectly, one of Vitalik's favorite charities. Link: https://www.givedirectly.org/crypto-for-good-2021/\n\nAs Doodles, we care deeply about community and collective effort, and we must also recognize we are part of the global community. To this end, we think that the Doodles should use the power of our community to make a big difference in the world by supporting organizations that help those in need.\n\nBy using a set amount of Doodlebank funds to support charitable efforts, we're helping those who are less fortunate and showing the world we are more than just NFT collectors, we're a community that cares and gives back.\n\nNote, this is a one time donation not a long term commitment to allocate a certain % of funds. These learnings will help inform future Doodlebank charity initiatives.\n\n\nThe Plan:\n\n1. Use snapshot to vote on set amount to dedicate to match\n\n2. Match donations in the December 2nd crypto charity event\n\n3. Share the news through a social push (both official and unofficial)\n\n4. The organizers have agreed to announce us as the only NFT project matching a donation (other matching orgs include FTX)\n\n5. Analyze the success/ROI of our investment through tracking retweets, likes, general social sentiment, and new eyes on our project\n\n6. @Explorer and @Jingaling share back the results to the community\n\n7. Use these learnings to help direct future Doodles charity efforts.\n\n\nPanelist Twitter reach (total ~1 million):\n\nSam Bankman-Fried (Panelist) - 441k followers\nLaura Shin (Moderator) - 180k followers\nCaitlin Long (Panelist) - 158k followers\nPeter Singer (Panelist) - 113k followers\nHaseeb Qureshi (Panelist) - 35k followers\nGiveDirectly - 22k followers\nThe Life You Can Save - 13k followers",

In the future perhaps IRL meetups can be organized.  The sky is the limit.  This proposal is simply to set January 23rd as Doodle Day.  Future proposals can be drawn up to use the community fund for DD giveaways, marketing, etc.  I thank you for your time!  -BennyHaze",

WestcoastNFT, the company who handled Doodles’ web3 dev needs, will be assisting in this drop as well.\n\nTimeline: Pukenzas will be available for either claiming or airdrop 4-6 weeks after the proposal is finalized.

Doodlers will either pay gas to claim or receive polygon airdrop.\n\nCost:  4.20 ETH total cost \n•\t3ETH to L3xc for artwork \n•\t1.2 ETH to WestcoastNFT for smart contract development + contract deployment gas fee + website development\n•\t7.5% royalty on secondary sales going to L3xc\n\nAccountability:\n•\tFunds will be transferred into gnosis multisig with tulip/burnt/poopie as cosigners in a 4/5 policy\n•\tFunds will be paid out on delivery of completed user stories found in final proposal\n\nOptions: \nYes – Mainnet: I will pay my own gas to mint Pukenza on Ethereum mainnet in exchange for the chance of higher secondary value\nYes – Polygon: I want all 10,000 Pukenzas to be minted on Polygon and distributed to all Doodler’s wallets for free\nNo: I don’t want the free Pukenza\n",
