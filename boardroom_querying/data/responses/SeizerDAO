What seems to be the best option is adding a Meme Maxi logo to The Meme. \nAdding a logo is possible in the interactive Memes but will take more time. \n\nOther options considered:\nAdding a frame as Chris / Articulate.eth has done is more complex given the different dimensions of the card.\nAesthetically not as great.\n\nThe low cost will\nCreate a low barrier for entry\nPrevent others from undercutting us\nBring audience to a future initiative on Memes Derivatives as proposed by @sundayfunday and @parachicaa. \nWe can list some editions on Open Sea or other marketplaces through the deployer wallet to avoid people trying to collect arbitrage between Manifold and Open Sea.\n\nChains that we will be minting on:\n\nEthereum\nPolygon - to reach the growing Reddit Community\nTezos - low cost, artistic crowd\nSolana - do it for thr y00ts\n\nReasons to try this:\n\nCreate a low barrier to entry into The Memes\nShowcase the talent and variety of artists in The Memes\nSpreads the Message of the Memes\nStart a small revenue stream for the DAO that is independent of token auctions\nHelp quell FOMO of The Memes in your collection, missed a meme, grab a $1Meme\nPairs well with future derivatives initiatives (FakeRareMemes)\nNeed to know The Memes to appreciate how great the recombinations are in the derivatives\nMany people are not technologically savvy enough to mint a copy on their own\n\nCounterpoints:\n\nWill people want it?\nPeople can make their own RCS version\nPeople can use unowned tokens on Deca and OnCyber, is this even needed?\n\n\nHow it will work:\nInitiative specific contributors- @G9ralt, @Regular Dad , @amtwo.⌐🆇-🆇 \n\nInitiative specific Contributors- To get 50% of proceeds\nDAO Treasury- To get 50% of proceeds.\n\nBy creating a sustainable mechanism that incentivises both contributors and other DAO members, I believe this would be a viable way to help the $1MemeShop to grow.\n\nProposed Transactions:\n\nFund allocation of 0.2E from the DAO Treasury to cover setup costs across chains.",

The meme donation could happen at the time of the Meme drop or at a later date. This would also apply to Season 1 artists retroactively.\n\nWe have had several said artists inquire about joining the DAO. They are vetted believers in the Memes and will forever be part of the Memes community; we would be a stronger collective with their support and having them join us. As we enter festivities and approaching Season 2, it is a good time to further expand both DAO’s meme collection and the membership base!\n\nOne immediate case would be Rik Oostenbroek, artist of Meme Card #46, who has openly expressed his interest in joining the DAO, specifically on Twitter with comments and Retweets in the past few days, and has spoken to @cadmonkey confirming this interest. This would be a great first example of the model.\n\nIn addition, any Meme Artist who has already donated their Meme to the DAO and have a SeizerDAO membership token will have their 0.2 ETH refunded to maintain consistency across artist donations. As it stands, this would only impact Hugo Faz, who has kindly donated his Meme Card #30 during the initial DAO setup.\n\nMeme artists could of course also alternatively join through the normal auction process if they deem their card more valuable than the membership token.",

      "content": "This is a proposal to buy three additional meme cards, to\nA) complete a collection that comprises at least one card per meme\nB) optimizes for AL for card #47 (XCOPY).\n\nWhich cards to buy\n\nBroadth in cards collected has been rewarded with AL by the 6529 team. In this spirit it feels right, to strive to collect 1 card of each meme as a next milestone. With the first allocation the genesis set (3 cards meme 1) has been purchased. Furthermore Hugo Faz generously gifted his OM card. In addition to this, Trashor and OM Breakdown have been seized with remaining funds dedicated to genesis set purchase and some cards have been collected in the context of the ambassador program.\nThis leaves 3 memes, with floor cards as follows (price at the time of writing in ETH):\n\n- DON’T LET THE INSTITUTIONS STEAL YOUR JPEGs: JPEGs ARE Infinite (.39)\n- FREEDOM TO TRANSACT: Sgt. Pepe (3.30)\n- FREESTYLE: Aeroglyph6529 (.35)\n\nHOWEVER, with the XCOPY drop incoming, there seems to be little downside on collecting Authentic Summer for the Freestyle category (current floor .48), which is an XCOPY derivative and might be helpful for AL. Given that we do not expect huge changes in floor prices, the most cost efficient was to complete one card per meme AND optimize for Fridays AL is collecting:\n\n- JPEGs ARE Infinite (.39)\n- Sgt. Pepe (3.30)\n- Authentic Summer (.48)\n\nThe total floor price to complete a collection that covers all memes according to the guidelines above at the time of writing is 4,17 ETH.\n\nThe proposal is to purchase the three cards as outlined above (incl. Authentic Summer) in the next step.\n\nHow to buy\n\nThe X derivative might be time critical for AL for Fridays drop. Thus this proposal covers buying it via a direct purchase instead of a WETH offer, if no WETH offer is accepted in time.\n\nSgt. Pepe and JPEGs are infinite shall be purchased via WETH offers when appropriate, latest by the end of the festivities.\n\nWhat else\n\nAny remaining funds after the three cards as outlined above have been acquired, can be used to buy further meme cards.\nThis would also happen via WETH offers.\nPriority in this case will be given to cards with a high thd/eth ratio, that have not yet been acquired.\n\nProposed Transactions:\n\nTransfer 4.5 ETH to fresh hot wallet(0x0520D946eD9781957f1972DBE573CaCf91F792b9) controlled by Amtwo on a Ledger device.",

We are considering allowing for alternative methods to enter the DAO for those who have been around and supportive early on in the process.\n\nThe DAO WhitePaper had set out an initial token sale of 50 tokens at 0.2E along with a weekly token launch schedule to kick-off right after; however, many current members have expressed interest in welcoming more members into the DAO before moving on to the planned auction.\n\nAdmittance Mechanism:\n\nThe eligible prospective members will be allowed to contribute a unique meme card to the DAO in exchange for a DAO token. \nThe token must be of greater value than the initial offering price of 0.2ETH and a unique card that isn’t already in the DAO treasury\n\nThe DAO will make a list of 15 meme cards above the FP of 0.2E that will be eligible and run a random generator to assign any from that list to these members.\n\nFor the purpose of achieving the objectives of this proposal: \n\nWe propose to allow people who are in the original Meme Maxis Twitter group, who have been around and contributing since the very start, to be taken care of in this proposal \n\nWhile this seems exclusionary to some members who joined later on in discord, it is the only way to guarantee what we set out to do with this proposal.\nAlso, logistically, the only way possible to ensure fair distribution is to do it through something like google forms. Which would again be FCFC (off-chain gas war).\n\nIf we open this process up to all who signed up to mint (54+), we again run the risk of leaving out the very members we are trying to include\n\nOption 1: Yes, Expand\n\n\nThe current list of members in the Meme Maxis Twitter group as of Thursday, December 8th 9am EST, excluding members who are already in the DAO and who were not on the Phase 2 Allowlist.\n\nPros:\nEnsures people who’ve been part of the genesis of the DAO are on-boarded\nAdds additional unique cards to our treasury\nAdds a group of committed members to the DAO\n\nCons:\nMembers who came in later could feel left out\n\nOption 2: No Change, Start Auction\n\nStick to original issuance plan as per Whitepaper\nKickstart 1st Weekly Auction.\n\n\nPROS:\nSticks to original vision\nAvoids complexity\nAllows market auction dynamics to flourish\n\nCONS:\nBoth new and old community members will be left out of the initial allowlisted sale.\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "This is a proposal to alter SeizerDAO's initial token launch and auction schedule to accommodate our growing community at the genesis moment of our DAO.\n\nAs SeizerDAO has launched, we've had a stream of new community members from the 6529/OM community and some OG members having missed out due to ArtBasel Miami coinciding with mint week.\n\nThe DAO WhitePaper had set out an initial token sale of 50 tokens at 0.2E along with a weekly token launch schedule to kick-off right after. \n\nWhitePaper link: https://mirror.xyz/0xB10D617109342926fC845DD6943e5E86c88fa4Cc/sFmt5Wyy_tXvJxsopvfd4n7hS_cVDKq4hzHyEDd3I8M \n\nAfter debates in the community Discord,we created a poll to guage interest, below are the poll results:\n \n![Screenshot 2022-12-06 at 2.07.08 AM.png](ipfs://Qmbt444Vq3SD4UhZhgnfHL4STz3A1LEpXQ9Eu7Bzx1sb4w)\n![Screenshot 2022-12-06 at 2.06.57 AM.png](ipfs://bafkreienguxbxn3w4abvubtgjr5abj7a5aoqga546im54sacehgnp6cbwe)\n![Screenshot 2022-12-06 at 2.13.00 AM.png](ipfs://bafkreibwffd7t5z354rv3shddfdhl7265nrkumwz6tgi5qeqnfo4bdoo5i)\n    \nHere are 3 options proposed by the community:\n\n\nOption 1: The 6529 Approach\n\nAdditional token supply: 15 tokens\nMinting Period: 24 hours\nMint Price: 0.2E\n\nAllowlist all members in discord who have sent their address in the #daotoken-mint-address channel at the time of the release of this snapshot proposal.(6 PM EST)\nAnnounce mint time and website announced 24 hours in advance.\nOnly for new members to join, existing members can not participate.\nWeekly Auction will begin after all tokens are minted out or the minting period ends.\n\nPROS:\nNon-subjective and unbiased\nEqual chance for all\nThe 6529 way. Currently being utilised for Meme Card drops.\nAdditional raise of 3 ETH to the DAO treasury\n\nCONS:\nSome members will still miss out\nPossible small gas war\nIf overestimated demand, can impact future issuance\n\n\n\nOption 2: Temporary Accelerated Auctions\n\n\n\nAdditional token supply: 14 Tokens\nMinting Period: 2 Weeks\nReserve Price: 0.2E\n\nAs per the whitepaper, the DAO will have a weekly token auction as an issuance model.\nThis approach will modify this schedule for a proposed period of 2 weeks of daily auctions.\nDaily Nouns-style auctions for a period of 2 weeks after which the cadence will reset to the original schedule of weekly auctions.\nAnyone, including existing dao token holders can participate\n\nPROS:\nAllows market dynamics to flourish\nEqual chance for all\nChances of increasing treasury in the short run\n\nCONS:\nSome community members will still be priced out\n\n\nOption 3: No Change\n\nAdditional token supply: N/A\nMinting Period: N/A\n\nStick to original issuance plan as per Whitepaper\nKickstart 1st Weekly Auction.\n\nPROS:\nSticks to original vision\nAvoids complexity\nAllows market auction dynamics to flourish\nCONS:\nBoth new and old community members will be left out of the initial allowlisted sale.\n\nAdditional Considerations:\nWe should also vote on the fact that this is a one-off extraneous event happening at the time of the DAO’s Genesis and is not to be repeated again.\nThe WhitePaper lays out the issuance schedule as below:\nA weekly new addition to seizerdao through a token auction in which all funds go to the treasury and are used for DAO initiatives or acquisitions. \nThese auctions will initially be for a period of 1 year, beyond which, the DAO can vote on continuity or explore other models.\nThus, at the end of the first year period, we will have a fresh proposal being voted on by the DAO with regards to future issuance.\nRegardless of whichever option that is chosen, we vote to not deter from this for the period as set out in the WhitePaper.\n\n \n![Screenshot 2022-12-06 at 2.27.21 AM.png](ipfs://bafkreicnpknawp3rmbz7uzt373shvikcwvgriug3jwscuooolxwwejtrw4)\n![Screenshot 2022-12-06 at 2.27.31 AM.png](ipfs://bafkreigum4azmx6tvyj427hg2za4kdqnz3lqtabztw75uktzipv72xrd54)\n![Screenshot 2022-12-06 at 2.27.42 AM.png](ipfs://bafkreid5ch4m6xe53oo2uiistw7daoabrvurznoghk4fewkzevxxf6i42e)\n\n![Screenshot 2022-12-06 at 2.27.53 AM.png](ipfs://bafkreigexzikmf2fnx5ylmqhjcdnjipr4e5gcpvvleich74yhbk2pnxwra)\n",
