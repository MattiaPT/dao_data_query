      "content": "### Full Forum Post: [Here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-growth-program-trial/24703/1)\n\n### Authors\n\nAlphaGrowth and our sister company ReservoirDAO are DAO service providers primarily working in the realm of DeFi growth through grants, BD, growth-marketing, and DeFi Operations. Our marquee partner is Compound.Finance, where we run all things growth, business development and marketing for the DAO.\n\n#### Co-authors for Uniswap Ecosystem Incentives Initiative section\n\nUniswap MetaGov Team: @PGov and @AranaDigital; The team first formed as the UADP to focus on Arbitrum’s governance and ecosystem. After applying and receiving 1M ARB in grants for the Uniswap DAO, it was deployed over 3 months and recently concluded. With this success, the UADP, now MetaGov team, is looking to deploy this framework across other chains. The team consists of long-time community members and delegates who have participated as contributors through multiple working groups and have worked across various committees and grant programs in Uniswap and across DeFi.\n\n### How we got here\n\nOver the last few market cycles, we cut our teeth in the world of grants, BD, go-to-market, tokenomics, and ecosystem growth. We’ve helped dozens of projects go multichain. Throughout this process, members of Compound DAO encouraged us to design and implement a comprehensive growth program to address stagnation in the protocol. As of today, we lead growth for Compound.Finance.\n\n[Here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/alphagrowth-quarterly-report-400m-added-in-tvl-and-user-growth/5717) is the most recent quarterly report on our growth program at Compound. For a comprehensive view of AlphaGrowth-led Compound Growth Program, check out this [Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/woof_team/alphagrowth-compound-growth-dashboard?growth_program_start_date_d7517c=2024-05-26+00%3A00%3A00).\n\n### What’s the problem?\n\nCurrently, there is little outbound business development.\nUniswap Labs is not currently focused on expanding the protocol to new chains, creating an opportunity within the DAO. Additionally, the UAC has done an exceptional job in facilitating the middle of the pipeline. However, to continue scaling Uniswap’s impact and user base, there is a growing need to strengthen the initial and final stages of the business development process.\n\nUniswap lacks a structured outbound business development strategy, limiting new chains and strategic partnerships. This reliance on inbound interest restricts Uniswap’s growth. Without outbound, valuable opportunities are being missed, and Uniswap risks falling behind competitors who take a more aggressive approach in pursuing partnerships and integrations. The current reactive approach slows expansion into new markets and ecosystems.\n\nTeams like Oku are often marketing new deployments and incentives on their own—efforts that could be amplified by the Uniswap ecosystem if a mechanism were in place. At present, the lack of a standardized process for co-marketing initiatives is causing missed opportunities for growth.\n\n### We’re leaving incentives on the table.\n\nAlthough Uniswap is live on over 25 chains, we aren’t currently capitalizing on the numerous incentive programs that are up for grabs. Without a team dedicated to securing and effectively distributing these funds, valuable opportunities for growth and user acquisition are being missed out on. Here are some concrete examples:\n\n* Optimism Grants Council: Potential to secure ~$1 million each year in incentives for Uniswap users\n* Scroll: Recently closed applications to a grants program awarding six figures to ecosystem projects\n* Chains like Taiko, Mantle, Rootstock, Boba, and Linea offer incentives that Uniswap is eligible for but not is taking full advantage of.\n* Other chains have expressed interest in creating one-off grants for incentivizing activity within their ecosystems\n* Projects including Circle (USDC) have spoken to us about ways to incentivize utilization, but channels for doing so are currently unclear to them.\n\n### What solutions do we propose?\n\nOur plan of action includes an outbound business development team, a dedicated marketing team, and a team committed to securing grants and incentives for Uniswap users.\n\n#### A Dedicated Outbound Business Development Team\n\nTo maximize opportunities at the top of the funnel, we will deploy our crypto-native team to spearhead outbound business development for the Uniswap Protocol. The objective is to consistently deliver high-quality opportunities to the UAC and the DAO, streamlining and enhancing the current process.\n\nWith this proactive strategy, we will engage new opportunities before our competitors do. This is crucial in sustaining Uniswap’s leadership position in the DeFi space.\n\nOur team will work closely with the UAC, Oku, and others to identify the best opportunities to prioritize the roadmap for future Uniswap deployments. Some of these targets include new chains and integrations like wallets and bridges. Our immediate focus includes targeting the various new EVM chains launching on the horizon, in addition to the abundance of opportunities within the OP Superchain and Arbitrum Orbit. Further, as the Uniswap v4 rollout is iterated upon launch, we will work hand in hand with relevant stakeholders to ensure target chains are aware of v4’s value proposition. This may include DeFi, CeFi, and TradFi.\n\nTo further support our DeFi BD team over the years, we’ve built a Telegram-native CRM specifically designed to manage growth efficiently and effectively. We’ll touch more on this later.\n\n#### A Dedicated Marketing Team\n\nTo ensure these new opportunities and incentives are shared far and wide, we propose leveraging our growth-marketing team. As we secure these grants and incentives, our mission is to strategically promote and distribute this alpha across the DeFi space, increasing TVL, volume, and activity on Uniswap.\n\nBased on the success we’ve had running campaigns around the distribution of millions in incentives to Compound users, the primary marketing channel we recommend is Twitter. Promoting engaging content will help mitigate the cold-start problem of building a following. Additionally, ensuring visibility on industry-leading platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko will keep Uniswap top-of-mind for ideal audiences. If there are other channels that the DAO would like to see activated, we are more than happy to entertain these options.\n\nFurther, we will work with Blockchain Ads, one of our tried and true partners, to facilitate targeted marketing efforts. Together we will leverage on-chain data to reach high-value wallet owners. To maximize engagement, we’ll also leverage Layer3’s interactive quests to gamify onboarding and increase user awareness and retention.\n\nOver the past year, the DAO has approved the deployment of Uni V3 on over a dozen EVMs, but there has never been a DAO-led push to ensure that individuals outside of the DAO are aware of these deployments and the incentives that accompany them. We will act as that bridge between the DAO and the broader DeFi community. Our job is not to make up new stories, but to curate, manage, and amplify the stories that already exist inside the Uniswap ecosystem.\n\n### Uniswap Ecosystem Incentives Initiative (UEII)\n\nWe will be working together with @PGov and @AranaDigital on the UEII (Initial post here: [UEII](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-ecosystem-incentives-initiative/24548)). Their team first formed as the UADP, focusing on Arbitrum’s governance, applied and received a 1M ARB grant for the Uniswap DAO a few months ago. This grant was deployed over 3 months and recently concluded. With this success, the UADP, now MetaGov team, is looking to deploy this framework across other chains. Together, with our team at AlphaGrowth, we propose leveraging our dedicated team to distribute the most value to Uniswap users and help the Metagov team, focusing on securing grants and incentives for the DAO and Uniswap users.\n\nThe initial focus will be on chains where Uniswap is currently deployed, capitalizing first on the lowest-hanging fruit. Depending on the goals of the issuing partners, these grants and incentives can be distributed in several ways: allocated to liquidity providers on specific chains / liquidity pools (e.g., stablecoins, LSTs, LRTs), used to subsidize transaction costs and trading fees, or directed toward other creative initiatives.\n\nWhen reaching out to prospective chains, the UEII team will leverage our experiences and contributions across these chains as all of us are already involved across different target ecosystems. We’ll utilize existing DAO programs like the Uniswap Onboarding Package to strengthen our claim and pitch, working hand in hand with each chain to secure the maximum incentives possible for the DAO.\n\nOftentimes these grants require KYC/KYB, which we’ll handle through ReservoirDAO, AlphaGrowth’s sister company DAO LLC in the Marshall Islands. This is how we’ve successfully claimed and distributed incentives for Compound as we’re fully doxed and ready to facilitate the process.\n\n### Trial Period\n\nGiven the long sales cycles associated with business development, marketing, and grant sourcing, we are proposing a 6-month trial period for this program. These initiatives will require time and space to cultivate impactful relationships and attain measurable results. 6 months will provide a reasonable window to build momentum and gather meaningful insights, while still leaving room for any necessary strategic adjustments.\n\n### Budget Request\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/82234c27-dc3a-43f7-8a09-8d009c8f4d21_original.png)![](https://static.tally.xyz/da2e9960-4eab-4f98-b520-0e1b43e86aaf_original.png)Note: If the images aren't loading, please refer to the forums.\n\nFunds will be sent to the Uniswap Accountability Committee. $420k will be then sent to AlphaGrowth. For the UEII, since we do not know exactly how much in grants we can secure for the DAO, a $500k “reserve” has been set side for the UEII success fee. This “reserve” will be held in the separate DAO trusted entity (UAC), and the UAC will NOT send funds for the UEII until grants and incentives have been sourced for the DAO. This should reduce governance overhead from having to vote in funding each time and ALL remaining “reserve” funds after the 6 month trial period will be returned to the DAO.\n\nA forum thread updating the community on each UEII sourced grant and distribution/program specifics will be created and continuously updated.\n\nUNI Price at vote: $7.49",

      "title": "[Updated] Forse Analytics for Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program",
      "content": "![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/6/6eada85dd10662fad3466cbddfe5a2e68819781b.jpeg)**Simple Summary**\n\nThis proposal seeks to onboard Forse by StableLab as a data service provider, helping analyze the effectiveness of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program. The offchain vote was [<u>passed</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0xdf2d95ccfadebf141847b90e058f8fafb4f76d8ca2ec2a7351d93353187df560) in early August of this year, and for a month, we have discussed with various Uniswap DAO participants to incorporate their feedback. The onchain vote however didn’t hit the quorum by less than a million UNI. Therefore, we have incorporated further feedback received and will retry the onchain vote.\n\n**Feedback Incorporated**\n\n**1. Accountability and Completion Based**\n\nThe budget once the onchain vote passes will first go to the Uniswap Accountability Committee. Once the Committee confirms that the work has been completed, StableLab can claim the budget.\n\n**2. Budget and Scope Changes**\n\nInitially, the RFC requested $70,000 worth of UNI  to analyze the impact of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program for 3 blockchains chosen by the Uniswap DAO; this was expanded to 4 blockchains for offchain vote following the feedback. Following the feedback, the Analytics will cover 4 blockchains but at a reduced cost of $60,000, effectively reducing the cost by $10,000 and also increasing the number of blockchains covered compared to the original RFC. \n\n**3. Preventing Redundancy**\n\nThere have been concerns that the work on Arbitrum especially might overlap with Gauntlet’s research on incentive programs on Arbitrum. We are in active talks with the Gauntlet team and will also ensure the work doesn’t overlap with Gauntlet’s domains.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nIn February 2024, the Uniswap DAO introduced the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program, which incentivizes users to participate in current and new deployments of Uniswap on different networks within the L2 space. The initial onboarding packages of this program cost the Uniswap DAO at least $3.5M worth of assets.\n\nWe propose that Uniswap DAO engage with Forse, our DAO intelligence and analytics platform, to analyze the impact of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth program and assess if the current approach drives real growth.\n\nBy assessing the impacts of the Revitalization and Growth Program, the Uniswap DAO will have valuable insights to improve further iterations of the program and/or other incentive programs. With this information, Uniswap DAO will be able to understand who are the most relevant user groups, their acquisition cost, and evaluate if the program itself was effective in influencing user behavior leading to increased stickiness of users, and therefore TVL and other top-level protocol metrics.\n\nRecently, StableLab supported the Arbitrum DAO as the Program Manager for the [<u>Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/long-term-incentives-pilot-program/20223), and we delivered a comprehensive [<u>analysis</u>](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stablelab-analyzing-stip-s-efficacy-and-ltipp-comparison/24777/) of the STIP to the Arbitrium DAO.\n\nWith Uniswap allocating over $3.5M worth of assets for the purpose of growing Uniswap’s market share, it is essential to ensure that the DAO analyses and reviews the impact of these incentives on an ongoing basis. \n\n**What is Forse?**\n\n[<u>Forse</u>](https://www.forse.io) is a data and intelligence platform built by StableLab helping DAOs analyze the impact of governance decisions in protocol growth, top-line metrics, and governance operations, including its cost and effort structures. [<u>StableLab</u>](https://www.stablelab.xyz/) is the leading provider of governance products and solutions for decentralized protocols. We work with various projects, from the ones just starting their journey to decentralization to the most prominent DeFi protocols.\n\nWe are currently working with:\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex016/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/3/38a96659739cb1925ba81a74383f18a24bf0d670.png)![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex016/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/6/68a93841e4c4257a4c138d5abb8f4ba509f07d15.jpeg)![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex016/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/4/4eb8d06a0f9d3f123a39c42f74493679ad935ab1.jpeg)Figure: Example of Onchain Impact Analaysis - Arb STIP Analysis\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/4/4eb8d06a0f9d3f123a39c42f74493679ad935ab1.jpeg)![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/8/8c92ed986353f593a4da5280e0fb2ebd854a04f6.jpeg)Figure: Example of User Segmentation Analysis - Arb STIP Analysis\n\nThis service provider engagement grants the Uniswap DAO access to the services of the entire StableLab team. Specifically, three StableLab team members will be the primary points of contact. \n\n\n\n**Team**\n\n**Christian Ziegler** is the CTO at StableLab. Previously, he worked as a researcher at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where he wrote his doctoral thesis on DAOs. In 2018, he co-founded Blockcurators GmbH. Christian has several published scientific articles, including [a Taxonomy of DAOs;](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1709396/document.pdf) [scoring methodologies for DAOs;](https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/16/7/330) [network analysis of DAOS; ](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1742459/document.pdf)and [classification of DAO proposals using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07059); among others.\n\n**Johannes Loewe** is the Data Lead at StableLab, where he focuses on all stages of AI and ML development, from experimentation to deployment. Before joining StableLab, he was a Freelance AI & Blockchain Software Engineer. He also has experience with DAOs, being a founding member of PretzelDAO in Munich. He holds a Bachelor's degree from Radboud University in the Netherlands and a Master's degree in Machine Learning from NUI-Galway in Ireland.\n\n**Marcos Miranda** is the Head of Product at StableLab. With over 5 years of experience in Product Management, focusing on Web3 and Analytics products, he is also experienced in building DeFi protocols, having previously worked for other protocols in the space.\n\n\n\n**Methods** \n\n* K-means with Euclidean distance for user groups based on transformed transactions \n* Difference in Difference Analysis and Interrupted Time Series Analysis to separate the effect of the growth program from the effect of the market \n* The remaining analysis using further advanced statistical analysis\n\n**Specification**\n\nBy analyzing the impact of these incentives, Forse by StableLab hopes to identify the following:\n\n* Impact quantification of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program in top-line protocol metrics with the isolation of external factors influencing these metrics as far as permitted and reasonably possible.\n* User segmentation and analysis based on archetypes of users to determine the types of users attracted through the incentive program.\n* Post-incentive user retention, reactivation, and user acquisition cost metrics.\n* Per-dollar value of incentives compared to other ways of incentivizing users (e.g. Airdrops, LP rewards, grants, ..).\n* User Retention and activity patterns over the time of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program.\n\nTo see Forse in action, explore our [<u>interactive dashboard</u>](https://dashboard.forse.io/main/arbitrum/grants_program/Short_Term_Incentives_Program) showcasing the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program. This provides a great example of what our output could be for Uniswap’s Revitalization and Growth Program. Our **Deliverable** would be an interactive dashboard hosted on dashboard.forse.io on at least the metrics stated above.\n\n\n\n**Budget Request** \n\nThe proposal requests $60,000 worth of UNI, which is 7,500 UNI (at the time of the updated proposal) to analyze the impact of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program so far for 4 blockchains chosen by the Uniswap DAO, with 3 months of additional maintenance support and updates to analytics modules utilized in the live dashboard.\n\n\n\n**Four Blockchains Among Chosen by the Uniswap DAO**\n\n| Blockchains | TVL      |\n| ----------- | -------- |\n| Arbitrum    | $3.07b   |\n| Base        | $2.68b   |\n| Scroll      | $1.01b   |\n| Blast       | $731.18m |",

Some of these targets include new chains and integrations like wallets and bridges. Our immediate focus includes targeting the various new EVM chains launching on the horizon, in addition to the abundance of opportunities within the OP Superchain and Arbitrum Orbit. Further, as the Uniswap v4 rollout is iterated upon launch, we will work hand in hand with relevant stakeholders to ensure target chains are aware of v4’s value proposition. This may include DeFi, CeFi, and TradFi.\n\nTo further support our DeFi BD team over the years, we’ve built a Telegram-native CRM specifically designed to manage growth efficiently and effectively. We’ll touch more on this later.\n\n#### A Dedicated Marketing Team\nTo ensure these new opportunities and incentives are shared far and wide, we propose leveraging our growth-marketing team. As we secure these grants and incentives, our mission is to strategically promote and distribute this alpha across the DeFi space, increasing TVL, volume, and activity on Uniswap.\n\nBased on the success we’ve had running campaigns around the distribution of millions in incentives to Compound users, the primary marketing channel we recommend is Twitter. Promoting engaging content will help mitigate the cold-start problem of building a following. Additionally, ensuring visibility on industry-leading platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko will keep Uniswap top-of-mind for ideal audiences. If there are other channels that the DAO would like to see activated, we are more than happy to entertain these options.\n\nFurther, we will work with Blockchain Ads, one of our tried and true partners, to facilitate targeted marketing efforts. Together we will leverage on-chain data to reach high-value wallet owners. To maximize engagement, we’ll also leverage Layer3’s interactive quests to gamify onboarding and increase user awareness and retention.\n\nOver the past year, the DAO has approved the deployment of Uni V3 on over a dozen EVMs, but there has never been a DAO-led push to ensure that individuals outside of the DAO are aware of these deployments and the incentives that accompany them. We will act as that bridge between the DAO and the broader DeFi community. Our job is not to make up new stories, but to curate, manage, and amplify the stories that already exist inside the Uniswap ecosystem.\n\n### Uniswap Ecosystem Incentives Initiative (UEII)\nWe will be working together with @PGov and @AranaDigital on the UEII (Initial post here: [UEII](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-ecosystem-incentives-initiative/24548)). Their team first formed as the UADP, focusing on Arbitrum’s governance, applied and received a 1M ARB grant for the Uniswap DAO a few months ago. This grant was deployed over 3 months and recently concluded. With this success, the UADP, now MetaGov team, is looking to deploy this framework across other chains. Together, with our team at AlphaGrowth, we propose leveraging our dedicated team to distribute the most value to Uniswap users and help the Metagov team, focusing on securing grants and incentives for the DAO and Uniswap users.\n\nThe initial focus will be on chains where Uniswap is currently deployed, capitalizing first on the lowest-hanging fruit. Depending on the goals of the issuing partners, these grants and incentives can be distributed in several ways: allocated to liquidity providers on specific chains / liquidity pools (e.g., stablecoins, LSTs, LRTs), used to subsidize transaction costs and trading fees, or directed toward other creative initiatives.\n\nWhen reaching out to prospective chains, the UEII team will leverage our experiences and contributions across these chains as all of us are already involved across different target ecosystems. We’ll utilize existing DAO programs like the Uniswap Onboarding Package to strengthen our claim and pitch, working hand in hand with each chain to secure the maximum incentives possible for the DAO.\n\nOftentimes these grants require KYC/KYB, which we’ll handle through ReservoirDAO, AlphaGrowth’s sister company DAO LLC in the Marshall Islands. This is how we’ve successfully claimed and distributed incentives for Compound as we’re fully doxed and ready to facilitate the process.\n\n### Trial Period\nGiven the long sales cycles associated with business development, marketing, and grant sourcing, we are proposing a 6-month trial period for this program. These initiatives will require time and space to cultivate impactful relationships and attain measurable results. 6 months will provide a reasonable window to build momentum and gather meaningful insights, while still leaving room for any necessary strategic adjustments.\n\n### Budget Request\n![image](ipfs://bafkreifqvvdvswxdahods4pn4bzlccrsi22mprmfixgq32grpxissbdyta) \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifw54rs6oxbqesbykwjmnghppu76rvhblhw7hvk2iqwk7zabde5oy)\nNote: If the images aren't loading, please refer to the forums.",

      "title": "[TEMP CHECK] - Onboarding Package for Lisk",
      "content": "**TLDR**: This proposal adds Lisk to the v3 deployments record and grants Lisk an Onboarding Package, which includes $250k of UNI incentives for three months on three key markets and Angle Merkl’s integration of Lisk. Lisk will match Uniswap’s incentives 1-for-1. Additionally, Lisk is committed to locking $1 million of protocol-owned liquidity (POL) for one year in exchange for $125k in additional UNI rewards, bringing the total UNI incentives to $375k matched by $250k in LSK incentives and $1 million POL locked for a full year. Separate from this proposal, Lisk has arranged for Oku to support Lisk, and the contracts have been deployed.\n\n## About Lisk\n\nLisk is a Layer 2 blockchain dedicated to bringing Web3 adoption in emerging markets back to Ethereum. By leveraging cost-efficient, scalable, and innovative Layer 2 technology, Lisk enables real-world applications in emerging markets to operate efficiently on Ethereum for the first time. Lisk’s founder-focused approach provides a comprehensive ecosystem of startup programs, tooling, seed liquidity, and knowledge bases to support local founders from inception to success. As a long-standing Web3 infrastructure project, Lisk has been contributing towards democratizing blockchain accessibility for developers globally since 2016. As an original member of the Optimism Superchain, Lisk also plays a pivotal role in building the industry’s first truly interoperable supernetwork alongside Optimism, Base, Mode, and Worldchain.\n\nLearn more about Lisk: [Link](https://docs.lisk.com)\n\n![Screenshot 2024-09-24 at 14.04.12](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex016/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/2/21bc0e6ef4011f5bb936ecd1ac61119ec4aca3ee_2_1035x403.png)\n\nToday, Lisk’s total value locked is ~$150 million, which makes it the sixteenth largest chain Layer 2 by TVL, according to [L2beats](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/lisk). Having launched its Developer Mainnet in June and with the Public Mainnet scheduled for Q4, the Lisk DeFi ecosystem is very much in its infancy.\n\n## Roll Out Plan\n\nWith Lisk still in its early stages, Uniswap has the opportunity to grab the majority of its market share without spending much capital. We propose directing the requested UNI incentives to the following markets:\n\n1. USDC/USDT 0.05% - 42.5%\n2. WETH/USDT 0.30% - 42.5%\n3. LSK/ETH 0.30% - 15%\n\nOku has already completed integrating the contracts with its infrastructure. If the proposal passes, we will coordinate with the Lisk team, Angle Merkl, and the Accountability Committee to set up the incentives as soon as possible. As of now, we’re shooting to be live the week of October 21st. In the meantime, anyone from the ecosystem who would like the contract details can find them below, or if they want access to the staging deployment for Lisk on Oku, they can contact the Oku team.\n\n## Deployment Details\n\nGFX Labs deployed the standard Uniswap v3 contracts and the associated peripheral contracts on Lisk. The crosschain account handles the deployment’s ownership via Lisk’s messaging system.\n\n- **v3CoreFactoryAddress**: 0x0d922Fb1Bc191F64970ac40376643808b4B74Df9\n- **multicall2Address**: 0xE3dbcD53f4Ce1b06Ab200f4912BD35672e68f1FA\n- **proxyAdminAddress**: 0x454050C4c9190390981Ac4b8d5AFcd7aC65eEffa\n- **tickLensAddress**: 0x38EB9e62ABe4d3F70C0e161971F29593b8aE29FF\n- **nftDescriptorLibraryAddressV1_3_0**: 0x743E03cceB4af2efA3CC76838f6E8B50B63F184c\n- **nonfungibleTokenPositionDescriptorAddressV1_3_0**: 0x8B3c541c30f9b29560f56B9E44b59718916B69EF\n- **descriptorProxyAddress**: 0x6Aa54a43d7eEF5b239a18eed3Af4877f46522BCA\n- **nonfungibleTokenPositionManagerAddress**: 0x5911cB3633e764939edc2d92b7e1ad375Bb57649\n- **v3MigratorAddress**: 0xaa52bB8110fE38D0d2d2AF0B85C3A3eE622CA455\n- **v3StakerAddress**: 0xdD489C75be1039ec7d843A6aC2Fd658350B067Cf\n- **quoterV2Address**: 0x738fD6d10bCc05c230388B4027CAd37f82fe2AF2\n- **swapRouter02**: 0x1b35fbA9357fD9bda7ed0429C8BbAbe1e8CC88fc\n- **Permit2**: 0xB952578f3520EE8Ea45b7914994dcf4702cEe578\n- **Universal Router**: 0x447B8E40B0CdA8e55F405C86bC635D02d0540aB8\n- **Limit order registry**: 0x352A86168e6988A1aDF9A15Cb00017AAd3B67155\n- **Crosschain account**: 0x81dE30A9a2816F95f2EE8DF62bafC45a095d57b2\n\n## Cost\n\n- $375k in UNI for three months of incentives\n- €20k for Angle Merkl\n\nTwo things are worth noting. First, Lisk will match Uniswap’s incentives 1-for-1. Second, Oku is not included in the costs of this proposal because Lisk already arranged for Oku to deploy and integrate the Uniswap v3 contracts.\n\n## Timeline\n\nBelow is the proposed timeline for delegates’ consideration. The timeline is an estimate and may be extended during the process as more time is required.\n\n- Contracts deployed (completed)\n- Request for Comment (RFC) ends October 6th\n- Temperature check October 7th-12th\n- The onchain vote review period starts on October 12th\n- Onchain voting opens on October 14th\n\n## Added Comment\n\nIn addition to the proposed $250k in matching incentives, Lisk is also ready to lock protocol-owned liquidity (POL) to further enhance long-term sustainability and strategic alignment. Specifically, we propose locking $1 million of POL for a minimum duration of one year, in exchange for an additional $125k in UNI rewards.\n\nThis adjustment brings the total UNI incentives to $375k, matched by $250k in LSK incentives, alongside the $1 million POL locked for a full year.",

      "content": "The onchain vote to renew the Uniswap Accountability Committee (UAC) has passed. We will commence with the election of two new committee members. \n\nFor a detailed account of the type of work that the UAC conducts and will plan on undertaking during Season 3, please read the Season 2 Report on the [forums here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-accountability-committee-uac-season-2-report/24492).\n\nThe members below have applied on the forums. The top two winners will be part of the committee. Each member's pitch can be found on this forum thread: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uac-season-3-application/24618\n\nPlease note this rule from the forum post with respect to voting fairplay:\n- If you or anyone from your organization is applying for a UAC position, you are not allowed to designate 100% of your voting power to the candidate in question. The maximum self-voting % allowed is 50%, and this amount must be at least evenly distributed among other candidates. The maximum self-vote percentage in any scenario must be matched equally with at least one other candidate.\n  - Example: if you self-vote with 50% of your voting power, you must give one more candidate the other 50% (max matching 50%). If you self-vote with 25% of your voting power, you may divide the remaining 75% among as many candidates as you like, as long as one other candidate also receives 25% (max matching 25%). The self-vote % is simply your own voting cap that must be matched at least once with another applicant.\n- This setup introduces a cap to self-voting, while simultaneously giving a degree of priority to yourself, as we understand that you would not be applying if you didn’t feel like a qualified candidate. This is something that was “soft consensus” decided when some issues arose with the treasury working group vote a few months ago.\n\nEligibility Criteria\nAs specified on the forums, you are only allowed to apply as an individual—not as an organization, using your DAO-recognized name and identity. The applicants are shown in the order by which they applied with their individual listed DAO-recognized name.",

      "content": "![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/6/6eada85dd10662fad3466cbddfe5a2e68819781b.jpeg)\n\n**Simple Summary**\n\nThis proposal seeks to onboard Forse by StableLab as a data service provider, helping analyze the effectiveness of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program. The offchain vote was [passed](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0xdf2d95ccfadebf141847b90e058f8fafb4f76d8ca2ec2a7351d93353187df560) in early August of this year, and for a month, we have discussed with various Uniswap DAO participants to incorporate their feedback.\n\n**Feedback Incorporated**\n\n**1. Accountability and Completion Based**\n\n-The budget once the onchain vote passes will first go to the Uniswap Accountability Committee. Once the Committee confirms that the work has been completed, StableLab can claim the budget. If a StableLab member is on the Committee, one will not interfere and leave the decision to other Committee members.\n\n**2. Budget and Scope Changes**\n\n-Initially, the RFC requested $70,000 worth of UNI to analyze the impact of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program for 3 blockchains chosen by the Uniswap DAO, this was expanded to 4 blockchains for offchain vote following the feedback. However, there were more suggestions for reduced scope and lower budget. Thus, the Analytics will cover 3 blockchains but at a reduced cost of $60,000, effectively reducing the cost by $10,000 compared to the original proposal.\n\n**3. Preventing Redundancy**\n\n-There have been concerns that the work on Arbitrum especially might overlap with Gauntlet’s research on incentive programs on Arbitrum. We are in active talks with the Gauntlet team and will also ensure the work doesn’t overlap with Gauntlet’s domains.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nIn February 2024, the Uniswap DAO introduced the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program, which incentivizes users to participate in current and new deployments of Uniswap on different networks within the L2 space. The initial onboarding packages of this program cost the Uniswap DAO at least $3.5M worth of assets.\n\nWe propose that Uniswap DAO engage with Forse, our DAO intelligence and analytics platform, to analyze the impact of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth program and assess if the current approach drives real growth.\n\nBy assessing the impacts of the Revitalization and Growth Program, the Uniswap DAO will have valuable insights to improve further iterations of the Revitalization and Growth Program or other incentive programs. Armed with this information, Uniswap DAO will be able to understand what was the most relevant user groups, and their acquisition cost, and evaluate if the Revitalization and Growth program effectively modified user behavior and led to increased stickiness of users, and therefore TVL and other top-level protocol metrics.\n\nRecently, StableLab supported the Arbitrum DAO as the Program Manager for the [Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/long-term-incentives-pilot-program/20223), and we delivered a comprehensive [analysis](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stablelab-analyzing-stip-s-efficacy-and-ltipp-comparison/24777/) of the STIP to the Arbitrium DAO.\n\nWith Uniswap allocating over $3.5M worth of assets for the purpose of growing Uniswap’s market share, it is essential to ensure that the DAO analyses and reviews the impact of these incentives on an ongoing basis.\n\n**What is Forse?**\n\n[Forse](https://www.forse.io) is a data and intelligence platform built by StableLab helping DAOs analyze the impact of governance decisions in protocol growth, top-line metrics, and governance operations, including its cost and effort structures. [StableLab](https://www.stablelab.xyz/) is the leading provider of governance products and solutions for decentralized protocols. We work with various projects, from the ones just starting their journey to decentralization to the most prominent DeFi protocols.\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/6/68a93841e4c4257a4c138d5abb8f4ba509f07d15.jpeg)\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/4/4eb8d06a0f9d3f123a39c42f74493679ad935ab1.jpeg)![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/8/8c92ed986353f593a4da5280e0fb2ebd854a04f6.jpeg)\n\nThis service provider engagement grants the Uniswap DAO access to the services of the entire StableLab team. Specifically, three StableLab team members will be the primary points of contact.\n\n**Team**\n\n**Christian Ziegler** is the Tech Lead at StableLab. Previously, he worked as a researcher at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where he wrote his doctoral thesis on DAOs. In 2018, he co-founded Blockcurators GmbH. Christian has several published scientific articles, including [a Taxonomy of DAOs;](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1709396/document.pdf) [scoring methodologies for DAOs;](https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/16/7/330) [network analysis of DAOS; ](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1742459/document.pdf)and [classification of DAO proposals using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07059); among others.\n\n**Johannes Loewe** is the Data Lead at StableLab, where he focuses on all stages of AI and ML development, from experimentation to deployment. Before joining StableLab, he was a Freelance AI & Blockchain Software Engineer. He also has experience with DAOs, being a founding member of PretzelDAO in Munich. He holds a Bachelor's degree from Radboud University in the Netherlands and a Master's degree in Machine Learning from NUI-Galway in Ireland.\n\n**Marcos Miranda** is the Head of Product at StableLab. With over 5 years of experience in Product Management, focusing on Web3 and Analytics products, he is also experienced in building DeFi protocols, having previously worked for other protocols in the space.\n\n**Specification**\n\nBy analyzing the impact of these incentives, Forse by StableLab hopes to identify the following:\n\n* Impact quantification of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program in top-line protocol metrics with the isolation of external factors influencing these metrics as far as permitted and reasonably possible.\n* User segmentation and analysis based on archetypes of users to determine the types of users attracted through the incentive program.\n* Post-incentive user retention, reactivation, and user acquisition cost metrics.\n* Per-dollar value of incentives compared to other ways of incentivizing users (e.g. Airdrops, LP rewards, grants, ..).\n* User Retention and activity patterns over the time of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program.\n\nTo see Forse in action, explore our [interactive dashboard](https://dashboard.forse.io/main/arbitrum/grants_program/Short_Term_Incentives_Program) showcasing the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program. This provides a great example of what our output could be for Uniswap’s Revitalization and Growth Program.\n\n**Budget Request**\n\nThe proposal requests $60,000 worth of UNI, which is 8700 UNI to analyze the impact of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program so far for 3 blockchains chosen by the Uniswap DAO, with 3 months of additional maintenance support and updates to analytics modules utilized in the live dashboard.\n\n**Three Blockchains Among Chosen by the Uniswap DAO**\n\n| Blockchains | TVL      |\n| ----------- | -------- |\n| Arbitrum    | $2.596b  |\n| Base        | $1.35b   |\n| Blast       | $838.46m |",

      "content": "# Summary&#x20;\n\nThis vote combines the snapshot budget approval for the Uniswap Accountability Renewal (UAC) Season 3, Approved Budget Rebalance, and extra 16th delegate cycle 2 spot for Argonaut and Tane.\n\nUAC S3: 37,038 UNI ($242,600 @ $6.55/UNI)\n\nBudget Rebalance: 42,060 UNI\n\nAdding 16th Delegate Rewards Spot: 5,496 UNI ($36,000 @ $6.55/UNI)\n\nTotal: 84,594 UNI will be sent to the UAC wallet at this address: 0x3B59C6d0034490093460787566dc5D6cE17F2f9C\n\n## Descriptions\n\n**UAC Renewal S3**\n\nFor the full proposal, please see [this forum post](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-accountability-committee-uac-season-2-report/24492).\n\nThe UAC has ramped up contributions in its current iteration, demanding more hours from members than in the past. Collectively, with our new much expanded scope, we have contributed more than originally expected, which was the limited 10 hours/month per member. In total over 6.5 months, committee members have worked 359 hours, 99 hours more than the expected 260 hours for this time frame. Note that the extra hours have not been paid out. Today, the scope of the UAC can broadly relate to DAO operations, program oversight, and protocol growth–the specifics of these categories will continue to evolve to meet the needs of the DAO.\n\nGoing forward, we propose a few key areas of focus for the committee:\n\n* Proposing new incentive programs, including a potential exploration into Protocol Owned Liquidity and other forms of growth beyond mere incentives\n* Administering an operational framework for the Uniswap DAO to best sustain efficiency with ever increasing programs and working groups\n* Continuing our role as an escrow service for DAO-funded programs\n* Polishing our accounting and record-keeping to improve reporting\n* Exploring and implementing growth programs related to Uni v4\n\nTo accommodate this expanded focus, we propose the following next steps to operationalize the committee going forward:\n\n* Add an additional member (going from 4 to 5 members) to increase work capacity and multisig security\n* Increase the maximum hours per member from 10 hours/month to 30 hours/month\n* Institute a staggered election system to retain three current members on the committee–this helps retain momentum and continuity with existing projects. We believe a degree of stickiness with the UAC team is important since conducting the noted operations requires subject matter expertise and familiarity with the DAO.\n  * Going forward, the UAC will internally hold a vote to decide which of the ⅖ members will be up for reelection–that is, if two members don’t resign by default\n  * For this election, @0xpibblez has stepped down, so there are automatically 2 available seats for the Season 3 election\n* Approve the $32.6k of wages payable to accommodate for Season 2 overtime\n* Fund the committee with an additional $210,000 of $UNI for payroll through March 2025 (this assumes that all 5 members spend 30 hours per month for all 7 months, given the $200/hour rate)\n\n*Note: The UAGP is funding legal research into an entity structure that would be suitable for the UAC. This would, among other aspects, allow the committee to sign incentive matching agreements with protocols to which Uniswap is being deployed. The introduction of a legal entity may change the dynamic of the UAC and its election setup as well.*\n\n\n\n### Approved Budgets Rebalancing\n\nFor the full proposal, please see [this forum post](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-accountability-committee-uac-season-2-report/24492).\n\nFluctuations in the UNI token price means that the accounts for various programs become unbalanced–sometimes at a surplus and other times at a deficit. Since programs are almost always budgeted in terms of dollars, we are looking to top up those balances to ensure liabilities around sustaining elected DAO programs are covered. This temperature check associated with rebalancing is being run separately from the UAC Season 3 renewal vote–the vote will request 42,060 UNI.\n\nFurther details on the request and breakdown of budgets can be found at the forum linked above.\n\n\n\n### Uniswap Delegate Race Tiebreaker\n\nUpon conclusion of the cycle 2 for delegate rewards, two candidates were incredibly close for the last 15th spot. More information and rational can be found on this [forum post](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-delegate-reward-initiative-cycle-2-application/24434/34) regarding specifics of the tiebreaker.\n\nThe snapshot link is [here](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0x8eb2e8135cab63b0ff987dff2bda9b651f86bf6cc90336a9b11b92640e16405b).",

      "title": "UAC Renewal S3",
      "content": "For the full proposal, please see [this forum post](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-accountability-committee-uac-season-2-report/24492).\n\nThe UAC has ramped up contributions in its current iteration, demanding more hours from members than in the past. Collectively, with our new much expanded scope, we have contributed more than originally expected, which was the limited 10 hours/month per member. In total over 6.5 months, committee members have worked 359 hours, 99 hours more than the expected 260 hours for this time frame. Note that the extra hours have not been paid out. Today, the scope of the UAC can broadly relate to DAO operations, program oversight, and protocol growth–the specifics of these categories will continue to evolve to meet the needs of the DAO.\n\nGoing forward, we propose a few key areas of focus for the committee:\n* Proposing new incentive programs, including a potential exploration into Protocol Owned Liquidity and other forms of growth beyond mere incentives\n* Administering an operational framework for the Uniswap DAO to best sustain efficiency with ever increasing programs and working groups\n* Continuing our role as an escrow service for DAO-funded programs\n* Polishing our accounting and record-keeping to improve reporting\n* Exploring and implementing growth programs related to Uni v4\n\nTo accommodate this expanded focus, we propose the following next steps to operationalize the committee going forward:\n* Add an additional member (going from 4 to 5 members) to increase work capacity and multisig security\n* Increase the maximum hours per member from 10 hours/month to 30 hours/month\n* Institute a staggered election system to retain three current members on the committee–this helps retain momentum and continuity with existing projects. We believe a degree of stickiness with the UAC team is important since conducting the noted operations requires subject matter expertise and familiarity with the DAO.\n  * Going forward, the UAC will internally hold a vote to decide which of the ⅖ members will be up for reelection–that is, if two members don’t resign by default\n  * For this election, @0xpibblez has stepped down, so there are automatically 2 available seats for the Season 3 election\n* Approve the $32.6k of wages payable to accommodate for Season 2 overtime\n* Fund the committee with an additional $210,000 of $UNI for payroll through March 2025 (this assumes that all 5 members spend 30 hours per month for all 7 months, given the $200/hour rate)\n\n*Note: The UAGP is funding legal research into an entity structure that would be suitable for the UAC. This would, among other aspects, allow the committee to sign incentive matching agreements with protocols to which Uniswap is being deployed. The introduction of a legal entity may change the dynamic of the UAC and its election setup as well.*",

      "content": "Just like the [1 bp fee tier 1](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/polygon-1bp-fee-tier/16488) originally proposed 3 years ago by Getty Hill, we propose to additionally add a 2, 3, 4 bps fee tier to Uniswap v3 on Base.\n\nYou may question why we are proposing the creation of three new fee tiers when our analysis only focused on 4 bps. There are two reasons for this. For one, Aerodrome is able to adjust fees automatically on Base. We anticipate they may respond by lowering fees below 4 bps and want Uniswap Protocol to allow LPs to move without governance intervention if this happens.\n\nSecond, we believe this analysis may be a single case study into a larger finding that the required fee for LPs on L2s may be lower than 5 bps. While Aerodrome highlights the success of a 4 bp fee tier, it’s unclear whether that’s the right market rate. It may be lower.\n\nLastly, we note that this change should not be blindly repeated on other chains. The community should do further research on the success or failures of this program before executing it on another chain.",

      "content": "Author(s): Rodrigo Vasquez, Ethereum Foundation; Jay Yu, Stanford Blockchain Club\n\nOutline\n0 - Quick Links\n\n1 - Summary\n\n2 - Motivation\n\n3 - Proposal Details\n\n4 - Benefits to the Uniswap Community\n\n5 - Cost and Timeline\n\n5.1 - Sponsorship Tiers\n\n5.2 - Timeline and Key Dates\n\n0 - Quick Links\nSponsor the Ethereum Protocol Attackathon (ImmuneFi) 2\nEthereum Protocol Attackathon in Collaboration with Immunefi\nEthCC - Security Soirée 2024 - Fireside Chat with Immunefi and the Ethereum Foundation (YouTube)\n1 - Summary\nThis proposal seeks funding from the Uniswap DAO to support an Attackathon, a comprehensive security audit event designed to bolster the security of the Ethereum protocol. The Attackathon will consist of three phases: education, active code hunting, and result evaluation. The goal is to enhance the security of the Ethereum network, which in turn benefits the entire DeFi ecosystem, including Uniswap.\n\n2 - Motivation\nThe Ethereum Foundation and Immunefi are introducing the first-ever “Attackathon” program, which is aimed to be the largest ever crowdsourced security audit contest conducted to augment security for the entirety of the protocol’s code.\n\nAn Attackathon is a multifaceted event involving three phases:\n\nBefore the Attackathon: A comprehensive education program on the protocol’s code delivered via live technical walkthroughs and Attackathon Academy content.\nDuring the Attackathon: Security researchers hunt for vulnerabilities in the code based on specific rules to qualify for rewards. Only impactful reports, as specified by the rules of the Attackathon, will be rewarded.\nAfter the Attackathon: Immunefi evaluates and compiles the results into an official Attackathon report, spotlighting top researchers with monetary rewards, NFT awards and a leaderboard.\nAlthough the Ethereum Foundation has a permanent bug bounty, it does not get the awareness and eyeballs it should get on the code. While the EF Bug Bounty has existed since 2015, it typically only receives 2-3 low-medium reports per week. Therefore, we hope that through this event we can draw more skilled security professionals to audit Ethereum and blockchain projects more broadly.\n\nFollowing recent large hard forks such as Dencun and Shapella, the Ethereum network has undergone significant changes, making this the ideal time to conduct an extensive security audit. Ensuring the protocol’s stability and security post-upgrade is crucial for maintaining trust and reliability.\n\n3 - Proposal Details\nThis Attackathon will be held fully online. Immunefi will host the contest on their platform and triage the bug reports, and the EF Protocol Security Research Team will judge the results together with representatives from client teams.\n\nThe scope of this Attackathon program seeks to include:\n\nSpecification Bugs:\nSafety/finality-breaking bugs\nDenial of service (DOS) vectors\nInconsistencies in assumptions, like situations where honest validators can be slashed\nCalculation or parameter inconsistencies\nClient Bugs:\nSpec non-compliance issues\nUnexpected crashes, RCE or denial of service (DOS) vulnerabilities\nAny issues causing irreparable consensus splits from the rest of the network\nSolidity Compiler Bugs\nDeposit Contract Bugs\nThe primary ask for the Uniswap community in supporting this project will be in funding, but any contributions to broadcast the program through socials would also be appreciated!\n\n4 - Benefits to the Uniswap Community\nConducting the Attackathon now, following recent major hard forks of the Ethereum network, is crucial. These upgrades have brought significant changes, and a comprehensive security audit will ensure the protocol’s stability and security post-upgrade. This increased focus on security will attract significant attention to the Ethereum codebase, enhancing visibility and participation from security researchers.\n\nFor the Uniswap community, this initiative has direct benefits. Enhancing Ethereum’s security directly improves Uniswap’s reliability and trustworthiness, as Uniswap’s security is inherently tied to Ethereum’s security. A secure Ethereum fosters a confident developer community, which benefits the entire DeFi ecosystem, including Uniswap. Moreover, by including the Solidity compiler in the competition’s scope, the Attackathon will specifically address potential vulnerabilities in the primary programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, which includes those used by Uniswap. Ensuring the security of the Solidity compiler will thus directly enhance the security of Uniswap’s smart contracts.\n\nAdditionally, aligning with Ethereum’s security efforts offers cost-effective benefits. Uniswap will gain from top-tier security assessments without bearing the entire cost, ensuring a secure and robust environment for its operations. Furthermore, by upskilling security researchers now, we prepare them for future hard fork contests, enhancing the overall security readiness of the Ethereum and Uniswap ecosystems.\n\n5 - Cost and Timeline\n5.1 - Sponsorship Tiers\nUnicorn Partners (+75 ETH Commitment, Approx. $250,000) (limited to two sponsors)\n\n1x Unique NFT with leaderboard rank\nParticipation in Attackathon Kick-off Twitter Space as a partner speaker\nLeaderboard Placement on Sponsor page\nTop-tier logo placement on Sponsor and Program Landing Page\nTop-tier logo placement on the Program Education page and program report\nCall out in Press Releases and EF and Immunefi Program Announcement Blogs\nDigital Logo Placement in the results announcement at Devcon or a dedicated virtual event\n4x Devcon tickets\n25% Discount on Crowd Sec offerings [transferable]\n1x Dedicated Twitter post announcing sponsorship from Immunefi Twitter handle\nPanda Partners (+30 ETH Commitment, Approx. $100,000)\n\n1x Unique NFT with leaderboard rank\nLeaderboard listing on the sponsor landing page\nMid-roll logo placement on Sponsor and Program Landing Page\n2x Devcon tickets\n10% Discount on Immunefi Crowd Sec offerings [Transferable]\n1x Dedicated Twitter post announcing sponsorship from Immunefi Twitter handle\n5.2 - Timeline and Key Dates\nJuly 8-11: EthCC program announcement\nAugust 8: Detailed program announcement and education kickoff.\nSeptember 1st: Attackathon hunting begins.\nOctober 31st: Attackathon concludes, and results compilation begins.\nNovember 9-17: Results announced.",

      "content": "![](https://static.tally.xyz/21494c79-f103-40f1-9368-a9b2d88a297f_original.png)Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative - Cycle 2\n\n**Authors:** [@Doo\\_StableLab](https://gov.uniswap.org/u/doo_stablelab) [@PGov](https://gov.uniswap.org/u/pgov) [@AranaDigital](https://gov.uniswap.org/u/aranadigital)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal outlines the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative - Cycle 2, a compensation program designed to improve participation quality and dedication among Uniswap delegates following the conclusion of Cycle 1.\n\n## Background\n\nIn late February 2024, StableLab proposed the [Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative 14](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-delegate-reward/22909). After the GovSwap event in Denver, further research to plan and implement the Delegate Reward Initiative was highlighted, leading to the formation of the Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group, composed of 8 members from different organizations. After extensive research for more than a month, the Working Group produced several findings, which can be found here: [https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702 7](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702)\n\nIncorporating these findings, the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative–Cycle 1 was [proposed 4](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temp-check-uniswap-delegate-reward-3-months-cycle-1/23837) and [launched 2](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/64) in June 2024.\n\n## Success of Cycle 1\n\nThe 12 delegates that were selected under Cycle 1 maintained 100% voting participation rate for both offchain and onchain votes during this period. In addition, the Delegate Reward Initiative discussion attracted several new delegates.\n\nNew Delegate NameDelegate Join DateSEEDGovMay 2024CuriaJune 2024TanéJune 2024BobbayJuly 2024WhetstoneJuly 2024\n\n## Learnings from Cycle 1\n\nWhile Cycle 1 was simple and effective, there were several suggestions to have a tier system to incorporate different participation levels of delegates. In addition, various suggestions were shared on how to make a points system to determine the top delegate applicants more fair and objective.\n\n## Cycle 2 Proposal Details\n\n**Application Eligibility**\n\n* There will be a week-long period for delegate candidates to submit their applications. Top 15 delegates will be determined based on points.\n* Delegates from Cycle 1 must apply again for Cycle 2–they will not be automatically included.\n* Delegates that have joined less than 3 months can also apply for the Initiative.\n\n**Delegate Reward Eligibility**\n\nOnce delegates have passed the application process, they must fulfill the following requirements to be eligible for up to $6,000 USD worth of $UNI reward per month.\n\n**Requirements**\n\n1.Maintain 80% onchain and offchain voting participation for the past 3 months. Achieving this will provide $3,000 USD worth of $UNI\n\nAdditional Rewards (the below are only available if the above Requirement of Voting Participation is fulfilled)\n\n2a. Write rationale for the voting on their delegate profile.\n\n2b. Attend Uniswap Community Calls.\n\nAchieving these above will provide an additional up $3,000 USD worth of $UNI.For 2a and 2b, it allows proportional payment. For example, if there were 4 votings and 1 community call, and a delegate missed to write a rationale of 2 of the votings. The delegate would be eligible to receive $1800 \\[3/5 \\* $3000].\n\n## Uniswap Delegate Reward Cycle 2 Metrics\n\nIn case there are more than 15 eligible applicants, the top 15 will be chosen by the following objective metrics. The highest number of available point would be 10.\n\n**1. Voting Participation**\n\n-Considering one of the primary roles of the delegate is to receive voting power from their delegators to vote on behalf for the best of Uniswap, voting participation is crucial to ensure quorums are met and malicious proposals are prevented. The total point amount from this category is 6. The onchain part is weighted more heavily due to its usual frictions such as gas cost, as well as its ability to dictate governance contract alterations and movement of treasury funds. The voting rate is based on the past 6 months.\n\n**1. Offchain Voting (Snapshot)**\n\n1. 80% and above : 2\n2. 70% till 80% : 1.5\n3. 60% till 70%: 1\n4. 50% or below but above 0%: 0.5\n5. 0% : 0\n\n**2.

      "title": "[Temp Check] Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative - Cycle 2 ",
      "content": "Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative - Cycle 2\nAuthors: @Doo_StableLab @PGov @AranaDigital\n\nSummary\nThis proposal outlines the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative - Cycle 2, a compensation program designed to improve participation quality and dedication among Uniswap delegates following the conclusion of Cycle 1.\n\nBackground\nIn late February 2024, StableLab proposed the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative 9. After the GovSwap event in Denver, further research to plan and implement the Delegate Reward Initiative was highlighted, leading to the formation of the Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group, composed of 8 members from different organizations. After extensive research for more than a month, the Working Group produced several findings, which can be found here: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702 3\n\nIncorporating these findings, the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative–Cycle 1 was proposed 2 and launched 1 in June 2024.\n\nSuccess of Cycle 1\nThe 12 delegates that were selected under Cycle 1 maintained 100% voting participation rate for both offchain and onchain votes during this period. In addition, the Delegate Reward Initiative discussion attracted several new delegates.\n\nNew Delegate Name\tDelegate Join Date\nSEEDGov\tMay 2024\nCuria\tJune 2024\nTané\tJune 2024\nBobbay\tJuly 2024\nWhetstone\tJuly 2024\n\nLearnings from Cycle 1\nWhile Cycle 1 was simple and effective, there were several suggestions to have a tier system to incorporate different participation levels of delegates. In addition, various suggestions were shared on how to make a points system to determine the top delegate applicants more fair and objective.\n\nCycle 2 Proposal Details\n\nApplication Eligibility\n\nThere will be a week-long period for delegate candidates to submit their applications. Top 15 delegates will be determined based on points.\nDelegates from Cycle 1 must apply again for Cycle 2–they will not be automatically included.\nDelegates that have joined less than 3 months can also apply for the Initiative.\n\nDelegate Reward Eligibility\n\nOnce delegates have passed the application process, they must fulfill the following requirements to be eligible for up to $6,000 USD worth of $UNI reward per month.\n\nRequirements\n\n1.Maintain 80% onchain and offchain voting participation for the past 3 months. Achieving this will provide $3,000 USD worth of $UNI\nAdditional Rewards (the below are only available if the above Requirement of Voting Participation is fulfilled)\n\n2a. Write rationale for the voting on their delegate profile.\n\n2b. Attend Uniswap Community Calls.\n\nAchieving these above will provide an additional up $3,000 USD worth of $UNI.For 2a and 2b, it allows proportional payment. For example, if there were 4 votings and 1 community call, and a delegate missed to write a rationale of 2 of the votings. The delegate would be eligible to receive $1800 [3/5 * $3000].\n\nUniswap Delegate Reward Cycle 2 Metrics\nIn case there are more than 15 eligible applicants, the top 15 will be chosen by the following objective metrics. The highest number of available point would be 10.\n\n1. Voting Participation\n\n-Considering one of the primary roles of the delegate is to receive voting power from their delegators to vote on behalf for the best of Uniswap, voting participation is crucial to ensure quorums are met and malicious proposals are prevented. The total point amount from this category is 6. The onchain part is weighted more heavily due to its usual frictions such as gas cost, as well as its ability to dictate governance contract alterations and movement of treasury funds. The voting rate is based on the past 6 months.\n\n1. Offchain Voting (Snapshot)\n\n80% and above : 2\n70% till 80% : 1.5\n60% till 70%: 1\n50% or below but above 0%: 0.5\n0% : 0\n2. Onchain Voting\n\n80% and above : 3\n70% till 80% : 2.25\n60% till 70%: 1.5\n50% or below but above 0%: 0.75\n0% : 0\n3. The date of the first on chain vote is 3 months or more (this is to counterbalance very new applicants who have few votes and able to get full points on the voting)\n\nYes : 1\nNo : 0\n\n2. Proposal Authorship\n\n-Helping to write proposals for Uniswap DAO is important. However, we also want to prevent low-quality or malicious proposals. Therefore, only passed votes would count. The total points for this category is 3. The onchain part is weighted more heavily once again.\n\nIn case of non-binary proposals, if the choice equivalent to “No” was present, and the end voting result was another choice than “No”, then it would be considered as valid for below. For example, Uniswap Treasury Working Group (UTWG) Election wouldn’t be valid for the points as there’s no “No” vote . But [Temp] Uni Onboarding Package - BSC would be valid for the points as there was a choice of “Against”. And the voting result was “$1m”.\n\n1. Authored or Co authored a proposal that passed offchain (snapshot) vote before.\n\nYes, 2 or more : 1\nYes, 1 : 0.5\nNo: 0\n2.Authored or Co authored a proposal that passed onchain vote before\n\nYes, 2 or more : 2\nYes, 1 : 1\nNo: 0\n\n3. Other Governance Participation\n\n-The full point for this category is 1. This category is to recognize other ways one could contribute to discussion regarding Uniswap Governance. This can be achieved by either\n\n1. Joined Uniswap Gov Workshop Before\n\nYes: 1\nNo: 0\nOr\n\n2. Joined Uniswap Community Call Before\n\nYes: 1\nNo: 0\nTie Breaker\n\n-Ties will be decided by the date of the first on chain vote these applicants casted in order to reward those delegates that have been contributing to Uniswap governance for an extended period.\n\nBudget\n\nWe are requesting 540,000 [6000 USD *6 Months *15 Delegates ] USD worth of UNI for the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative.\n\nThe total amount, once approved, will be sent to the Accountability Committee, which will be responsible for the monthly distribution of rewards to eligible delegates and the proposal authors. Since the total budget of the now disbanded Delegate Reward WG has not been fully used, administration of this reward program–including the creation of this proposal and the admin work behind verifying monthly delegate participation–will be paid for using the current balance of $41.6k. The monthly admin consumption will be communicated each month to the DAO.\n\nNext Steps\n\nOn August 25th, assuming the snapshot vote passed, will proceed to Onchain vote.",

We have fixed this mistake and are re-running the snapshot.\n\nOriginal Text:\nJust like the 1 bp fee tier originally proposed 3 years ago by Getty Hill, we propose to additionally add a 2, 3, 4 bps fee tier to Uniswap v3 on Base. \n\nYou may question why we are proposing the creation of three new fee tiers when our analysis only focused on 4 bps. There are two reasons for this. For one, Aerodrome is able to adjust fees automatically on Base. We anticipate they may respond by lowering fees below 4 bps and want Uniswap Protocol to allow LPs to move without governance intervention if this happens. \n\nSecond, we believe this analysis may be a single case study into a larger finding that the required fee for LPs on L2s may be lower than 5 bps. While Aerodrome highlights the success of a 4 bp fee tier, it’s unclear whether that’s the right market rate. It may be lower.\n\nLastly, we note that this change should not be blindly repeated on other chains. The community should do further research on the success or failures of this program before executing it on another chain.",

      "title": "Deploy Uniswap v3 on X Layer",
      "content": "### Summary:\nThis proposal proposes deploying Uniswap v3 on X Layer. GFX Labs is sponsoring this proposal on behalf of X Layer.\n\n* X Layer will provide $1m of liquidity for a minimum of 6 months via a community multisig.\n* Uniswap DAO to provide the front end [cost](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-revitalization-and-growth/22616?u=gfxlabs) for Oku Trade.\n* At a later date, OKX may create a new proposal seeking UNI incentives.\n\n### Background:\nX Layer is a zkEVM Layer 2 network built on Ethereum, powered by Polygon CDK, a zkEVM stack for building Ethereum L2 scaling solutions. Developers can easily deploy their existing contracts on zkEVM, and users can move their assets from Ethereum and conduct transactions off-chain. These transactions are bundled into groups with zero-knowledge proofs to verify their validity.\n\n### Motivation:\nDeploying an instance of Uniswap v3 on X Layer provides numerous opportunities for Uniswap to gain millions of new users from the OKX ecosystem which comprises of approximately 50m. This deployment will be a win-win for both parties as it provides Uniswap with a new user base and revenue stream and X Layer the chance to offer its users access to a battle tested DeFi primitive, which is Uniswap v3.\n\n\n**Boundless scalability:** 100% EVM compatibility and easy-to-use developer tools for deployment.\n\n**X Layer is Powered by OKX:** seamless integration to all OKX products, all-in-one Web3 gateway, and access to 50M+ users in the OKX ecosystem.\n\n**Security:** rely on robust secure mechanisms from Ethereum, with trustless interoperability.\n\n**Low fee:** same coding experience as Ethereum but 100x cheaper.\n\n**Portal to Web3:** enter the world of Web3 via OKX Wallet, built with compact infrastructure modules to create innovative DApps.\n\n## Proposal Stakeholders:\nThe following list of stakeholders is present to transparently communicate which entities and individuals are involved in proposal creation and implementation.\n\n### Proposer: Yohaan (X Layer DeFi Strategy)\nThis entity is responsible for authoring the proposal & managing the governance process\n\n#### Deployer: [GFX Labs](https://x.com/labsGFX)\nThis entity is responsible for the technical deployment of the contracts on the target chain\n* GFX Labs will help deploy the v3 contracts on X Layer and has a track record of safely deploying Uniswap v3 on various EVM-compatible chains\n\n#### Frontend: [Oku Trade](https://oku.trade)\nThe initial frontend where users can interact with the new Uniswap v3 deployment\n* Oku is built and managed by GFX Labs\n* Oku was seeded by a Uniswap Foundation grant in 2022\n* Oku supports twelve chains and continues to aid Uniswap’s expansion to new protocols\n\n**Note:** Oku Trade has become the DAO’s go-to third party front-end for Uniswap deployments since the canonical front-end is owned and operated by Uniswap Labs\n\n#### Bridge Provider: [zkEVM Bridge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2a3dd3eb832af982ec71669e178424b10dca2ede#writeProxyContract)\nX Layer mainnet bridge allows you to seamlessly move value between Ethereum and X Layer mainnet and can also be used to send and claim messages to and from Ethereum and X Layer.\n\n#### Target Chain: [X Layer](https://www.okx.com/xlayer)\nThis is the chain that v3 contracts are deployed on\n\n#### Proposal Sponsor: [GFX Labs](https://x.com/labsGFX)\nThis entity has >1M UNI and is therefore eligible for administering the onchain vote\n\n### Liquidity Bootstrapping and Incentives:\n\n#### X Layer’s Commitment:\nX Layer commits $1M worth of liquidity to Uniswap pools on X Layer for a minimum of 6 months. All liquidity will be provided on the day of launch. The tokens will be deployed on Uniswap through the X Layer integration with Oku Trade. All liquidity will be provided immediately upon deploying an instance of Uniswap v3 on X Layer.\n**Pools and liquidity commitment:**\n* $500k in OKB/USDT 0.30%\n* $200k in OKB/USDC 0.30%\n* $200k in OKB/wETH 0.30%\n* $100k in USDC/USDT 0.05%\n\n#### Community Multisig for Liquidity Provisioning:\nThe liquidity committment made by X layer will be sent to a Gnosis Safe on X Layer prior to launch with signers from OKX, Oku Trade and select Uniswap Delegates.\n\nThe Uniswap representatives for the multsig will be PGov (Jun) and Arana (Abdullah).  \n\n#### Deployment Details:\nIf no major points of contention are posed by the DAO during the RFC, the Accountability Committee will\n* Optimistically approve this deployment and consider the deployed contracts on the X layer as canonical, and a comment will be posted on this forum with all the verified contracts\n* As is the case with all canonical v3 deployments, this deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3-deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended by the Accountability Committee to include the reference to the stated v3 contracts on X Layer.\n\n#### Timeline:\n**July 2024:** RFC\n\n**August 2024:** Liquidity commitment Temp Check\n\n**August 2024:** Onchain vote to approve onboarding package\n\n**September 2024:** Uni v3 contracts, as well as the front end on Oku Trade, will be deployed by GFX Labs\n",

      "content": "Just like the 1 bp fee tier originally proposed 3 years ago by Getty Hill, we propose to additionally add a 2, 3, 4 bps fee tier to Uniswap v3 on Base. \n\nYou may question why we are proposing the creation of three new fee tiers when our analysis only focused on 4 bps. There are two reasons for this. For one, Aerodrome is able to adjust fees automatically on Base. We anticipate they may respond by lowering fees below 4 bps and want Uniswap Protocol to allow LPs to move without governance intervention if this happens. \n\nSecond, we believe this analysis may be a single case study into a larger finding that the required fee for LPs on L2s may be lower than 5 bps. While Aerodrome highlights the success of a 4 bp fee tier, it’s unclear whether that’s the right market rate. It may be lower.\n\nLastly, we note that this change should not be blindly repeated on other chains. The community should do further research on the success or failures of this program before executing it on another chain.",

      "content": "# Uniswap Onboarding Package - Gnosis Chain\n\nOutline\n\n* Overview\n* Motivation\n* About Gnosis Chain\n* Benefits to Uniswap\n* Cost and Timeline\n* Stakeholders\n\n### Overview\n\nGnosis Chain is a community-owned, EVM-compatible network operated by a diverse set of 200k+ validators around the world. In the last two quarters (Q4 2023 and Q1 2024), Gnosis Chain experienced significant growth reaching over $300 Million in TVL. The DeFi sector added numerous established blue chip projects and now powers a vibrant ecosystem including Spark, Aave, Balancer, Curve, CoW Swap, 1inch and Connext among others.\n\nSince Gnosis Chain’s focus on revolutionising the payments infrastructure to make decentralized financial tools accessible and usable for all, we feel it fitting for Uniswap to tap into the ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal requests a retroactive Onboarding Package for Gnosis Chain.\n\n### Motivation\n\nWhile already deployed on Gnosis Chain, Uniswap is not currently capitalizing on it. This proposal aims to change that.\n\nOne of the key areas of focus suggested by the Uniswap Deployments Accountability Committee to expand the Uniswap ecosystem is “Uniswap Revitalization and Growth”. In their recent work, a large emphasis is on revisiting some of the old deployments and proactively capturing first-mover advantage on promising new chains.\n\nAs Gnosis Chain experienced significant growth across Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, we believe the chain aligns perfectly with the scope of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth initiative. Uniswap’s deployment on Gnosis Chain was completed in early 2022, hence Gnosis Chain was never a beneficiary of the “Onboarding Package” that is now included as a standard element of deployment proposals.\n\nWe believe there are synergies between Uniswap and Gnosis Chain as well as a strong potential for Gnosis Chain to generate high volumes and mobilize an influx of new users to Uniswap because of its focus on payments and financial tools.\n\nAs a comparison, Balancer processed over $590 Million in volumes YTD (end of May) on Gnosis Chain, making it the second-largest alternative EVM market for the DeFi protocol (similarly to Uniswap, Arbitrum is the first). Gnosis Chain has a larger positive impact on Balancer’s volumes than other more prominent networks like Polygon ($284M YTD) or Base ($80.8M YTD).\n\nWe believe that additional visibility and an incentive program would enable both Uniswap and Gnosis Chain to tap into their synergies resulting in positive growth on both ends.\n\n### About Gnosis Chain\n\nGnosis Chain is a community-owned, EVM-compatible network operated by a diverse set of 200k+ validators around the world. It features fast transaction times (5 seconds) and low transaction fees (500 tx for $0.01) with the unique advantage of having a stable token as a base asset for transactions and gas fees.\n\nOne of the first Ethereum sidechains, Gnosis Chain’s core values are resilience and credible neutrality. By allowing contributors to easily run a node, Gnosis Chain created a community-owned, anti-fragile network secured by a geographically diverse validator set. Its strong culture of at-home stakers (not reliant on cloud providers or data centres) and its community governance ensure Gnosis Chain remains credibly neutral at a lower price point than Mainnet.\n\nGnosis Chain underpins the Gnosis collective of aligned projects revolutionising the payments infrastructure to make decentralised financial tools accessible and usable for all. The collective features established blue chip projects like Safe as well as prominent ones like Gnosis Pay and Monerium.\n\nIn the last two quarters (Q4 2023 and Q1 2024), Gnosis Chain experienced significant growth reaching over $300 Million in TVL. The DeFi sector added numerous established blue chip projects and now powers a vibrant ecosystem including Spark, Aave, Balancer, Curve, CoW Swap, 1inch and Connext among others.\n\n### Benefits to Uniswap\n\nThe [Multichain Uniswap](https://blog.uniswap.org/multichain-uniswap) approach has proven successful with approx. [35% of trading volumes](https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/uniswap) in the last 6 months come from non-Ethereum-Mainnet deployments.\n\nSince Gnosis Chain’s focus on revolutionising the payments infrastructure to make decentralized financial tools accessible and usable for all, we feel it fitting for Uniswap to tap into the ecosystem. The potential for Uniswap to capture the inflow of new and existing users leveraging Gnosis Chain as a payments infrastructure is a promising opportunity for the project to reach a new audience.\n\nGnosis Chain underpins the Gnosis collective of aligned projects, building synergic services to Uniswap. Among those, Safe and Gnosis Pay. Safe Smart Accounts count 9.1 Million accounts deployed with $100B+ in total assets stored and VIP individuals (e.g. Vitalik) using them. Gnosis Pay is the world’s first on-chain spending account with a Visa Debit Card linked to a self-custodial blockchain wallet, connected with 80 Million merchants worldwide. Roll-out in Europe and the United Kingdom has already started, with upcoming new Countries including Brazil and Argentina. That is a combined population of approx. 1.45 Billion people.\n\nAdditionally, Gnosis Chain powers a growing DeFi sector with numerous blue chip projects added since Q4 2023. These include Aave, whose market on Gnosis Chain has grown rapidly since its launch 7 months ago and is now larger than the lending protocol’s markets on Base and Scroll (as of May 2024). sDAI (MakerDAO’s interest-earning DAI) accumulated over $68 Million TVL since October 2023. Focusing on the on-chain trading vertical, Balancer processed over $590 Million in volumes YTD (end of May) on Gnosis Chain, making it the second-largest alternative EVM market for the DeFi protocol (similarly to Uniswap, Arbitrum is the first). This means, Gnosis Chain has a larger positive impact on Balancer’s volumes than other more prominent networks like Polygon ($284M YTD) or Base ($80.8M YTD).\n\nBased on the above and observing Uniswap’s performance across blockchains, we anticipate the protocol will replicate its success in capturing market share on Gnosis Chain.\n\n### Bridges\n\nGnosis Chain is committed to providing easy and secure access to Ethereum L1 and other Layer 1 and Layer 2 ecosystems. For this reason, multiple bridging options are available to connect with Gnosis Chain.\n\nThe [Omnibridge](https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/About%20Token%20Bridges/omnibridge) is a native token bridge that connects Ethereum and Gnosis Chain (and vice-versa) by minting the canonical representation of bridged assets on Gnosis. The Omnibridge is built on top of the [Arbitrary Message Bridge (AMB)](https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/About%20Token%20Bridges/amb-bridge), a key bridge primitive that is used inside higher-order bridges like the Omnibridge and allows Gnosis contracts to send data and trigger contract functions on Ethereum and vice-versa. Therefore, the Omnibridge relies on the same trust models and group of [Trusted Bridge Validators](https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/management/validators#amb--omnibridge) as the AMB. Part of these validators is Succinct Lab’s zkSNARK-enabled Light Client, Telepathy. Telepathy is a key component of the AMB bridge ecosystem as it enhances security and reliability for cross-chain transactions by providing validity proofs via zkSNARKs that ensure trustless verification of transaction events across chains.\n\nThe [xDAI bridge](https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/About%20Token%20Bridges/xdai-bridge) is a native DAI bridge from Ethereum that is used to mint and burn xDAI, the native asset used for gas and transaction fees on Gnosis.\n\nGnosis has a long-term roadmap to move towards trustless bridges and is investing resources into trust-minimization of its bridges, to ensure trust and safety of users. [Hashi](https://crosschain-alliance.gitbook.io/hashi) is an EVM Hash Oracle Aggregator designed to enhance cross-chain bridge security by aggregating block headers from various sources. It supports 15+ General Message Passing bridges and ZK light clients, promoting redundancy and reducing reliance on single mechanisms. By requiring validation from multiple independent mechanisms, Hashi ensures greater resilience against security incidents. Gnosis plans to [gradually migrate](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-93-should-gnosisdao-support-the-integration-of-hashi-within-gnosis-chains-canonical-bridges/8245) its canonical bridges to Hashi’s distributed trust model with the goal of strengthening security, decentralisation and interoperability.\n\nAdditionally, Gnosis Chain is supported within independent bridge solutions that enable the cross-chain connection with other Layer 1 and Layer 2 ecosystems. These include Jumper (provided by Li.Fi), Bungee, Hop, Connext, DLN (debridge), LayerZero, Chainlink CCIP and Wormhole.\n\nCost and Timeline\nThis proposal has passed the snapshot with $250k being the winning option. This is addition to the $105k Oku deployment and $21.6k Merkl integration fee. Given the price volatility of UNI recently, we will take a price of $5 per UNI, resulting in 75320 UNI.\n\n\n\nStakeholders\nProposal sponsor - [karpatkey](https://www.karpatkey.com/). karpatkey is a delegate both in the Uniswap DAO and in the Gnosis DAO. PGov is helping propose the vote on their behalf.\n\nDeployer - The relevant smart contracts have already been deployed.\n\nTarget chain: Gnosis Chain by [GnosisDAO](https://www.gnosis.io/about)",

      "title": "[TEMP CHECK]- Revised - Uniswap Onboarding Package - OKX Chain",
      "content": "# [Temp Check] Deploy Uniswap v3 on X Layer\n\n## REVISED:\nBased on the feedback from the prior Temperature Check, our counter proposal is as follows:\n\n* Uniswap to provide the front end cost for Oku Trade\n* X Layer to provide $1m of liquidity for a minimum of 6 months via a community multisig as stated in the above proposal\n\nAt a later date, OKX may create a new proposal seeking UNI incentives.\n\n### Summary:\nThis proposes the deployment of Uniswap v3 on X Layer.\n\n### Background:\nX Layer is a zkEVM Layer 2 network built on Ethereum, powered by Polygon CDK, a zkEVM stack for building Ethereum L2 scaling solutions. Developers can easily deploy their existing contracts on zkEVM, and users can move their assets from Ethereum and conduct transactions off-chain. These transactions are bundled into groups with zero-knowledge proofs to verify their validity.\n\n### Motivation:\nDeploying an instance of Uniswap v3 on X Layer provides numerous opportunities for Uniswap to gain millions of new users from the OKX ecosystem which comprises of approximately 50m. This deployment will be a win-win for both parties as it provides Uniswap with a new user base and revenue stream and X Layer the chance to offer its users access to a battle tested DeFi primitive, which is Uniswap v3.\n\n**Boundless scalability:** 100% EVM compatibility and easy-to-use developer tools for deployment.\n**X Layer is Powered by OKX:** seamless integration to all OKX products, all-in-one Web3 gateway, and access to 50M+ users in the OKX ecosystem.\n**Security:** rely on robust secure mechanisms from Ethereum, with trustless interoperability.\n**Low fee:** same coding experience as Ethereum but 100x cheaper.\n**Portal to Web3:** enter the world of Web3 via OKX Wallet, built with compact infrastructure modules to create innovative DApps.\n\n### Proposal Stakeholders:\nThe following list of stakeholders is present to transparently communicate which entities and individuals are involved in proposal creation and implementation.\n\n### Proposer: Yohaan (X Layer DeFi Strategy)\nThis entity is responsible for authoring the proposal & managing the governance process\n\n#### Deployer: [GFX Labs](https://x.com/labsGFX)\nThis entity is responsible for the technical deployment of the contracts on the target chain\n* GFX Labs will help deploy the v3 contracts on X Layer and has a track record of safely deploying Uniswap v3 on various EVM-compatible chains\n\n#### Frontend: [Oku Trade](https://oku.trade)\nThe initial frontend where users can interact with the new Uniswap v3 deployment\n* Oku is built and managed by GFX Labs\n* Oku was seeded by a Uniswap Foundation grant in 2022\n* Oku supports twelve chains and continues to aid Uniswap’s expansion to new protocols\n\n**Note:** Oku Trade has become the DAO’s go-to third party front-end for Uniswap deployments since the canonical front-end is owned and operated by Uniswap Labs\n\n#### Bridge Provider: [zkEVM Bridge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2a3dd3eb832af982ec71669e178424b10dca2ede#writeProxyContract)\nX Layer mainnet bridge allows you to seamlessly move value between Ethereum and X Layer mainnet and can also be used to send and claim messages to and from Ethereum and X Layer.\n\n#### Target Chain: [X Layer](https://www.okx.com/xlayer)\nThis is the chain that v3 contracts are deployed on\n\n#### Proposal Sponsor: [GFX Labs](https://x.com/labsGFX)\nThis entity has >1M UNI and is therefore eligible for administering the onchain vote\n\n### Liquidity Bootstrapping and Incentives:\n\n#### X Layer’s Commitment:\nX Layer commits $1M worth of liquidity to Uniswap pools on X Layer for a minimum of 6 months. All liquidity will be provided on the day of launch. The tokens will be deployed on Uniswap through the X Layer integration with Oku Trade. All liquidity will be provided immediately upon deploying an instance of Uniswap v3 on X Layer.\n**Pools and liquidity committment:**\n* $500k in OKB/USDT 0.30%\n* $200k in OKB/USDC 0.30%\n* $200k in OKB/wETH 0.30%\n* $100k in USDC/USDT 0.05%\n\n#### Community Multisig for Liquidity Provisioning:\nThe liquidity committment made by X layer will be sent to a Gnosis Safe on X Layer prior to launch with signers from OKX, Oku Trade and select Uniswap Delegates.\n\n#### Deployment Details:\nIf no major points of contention are posed by the DAO during the RFC, the Accountability Committee will\n* Optimistically approve this deployment and consider the deployed contracts on the X layer as canonical, and a comment will be posted on this forum with all the verified contracts\n* As is the case with all canonical v3 deployments, this deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3-deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended by the Accountability Committee to include the reference to the stated v3 contracts on X Layer.\n\n#### Timeline:\n**July 2024:** RFC\n**August 2024:** Liquidity commitment Temp Check\n**August 2024:** Onchain vote to approve onboarding package\n**September 2024:** Uni v3 contracts as well as front end on Oku Trade will be deployed by GFX Labs",

      "title": "[Temp Check] Forse Analytics for Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program",
      "content": "Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to onboard Forse by StableLab as a data service provider, helping analyze the effectiveness of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program. The offchain vote (Snapshot) will be a weighted voting where each voter may spread voting power across any number of choices to help to assess three blockchain for Forse to analyze.\n\nMotivation\n\nIn February 2024, the Uniswap DAO introduced the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program, which incentivizes users to participate in current and new deployments of Uniswap on different networks within the L2 space. The initial onboarding packages of this program cost the Uniswap DAO at least $3.5M worth of assets.\n\nWe propose that Uniswap DAO engage with Forse, our DAO intelligence and analytics platform, to analyze the impact of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth program and assess if the current approach drives real growth.\n\nBy assessing the impacts of the Revitalization and Growth Program, the Uniswap DAO will have valuable insights to improve further iterations of the Revitalization and Growth Program or other incentive programs. Armed with this information, Uniswap DAO will be able to understand what was the most relevant user groups, and their acquisition cost, and evaluate if the Revitalization and Growth program effectively modified user behavior and led to increased stickiness of users, and therefore TVL and other top-level protocol metrics.\n\nRecently, StableLab supported the Arbitrum DAO as the Program Manager for the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program, and we delivered a comprehensive analysis of the STIP to the Arbitrium DAO.\n\nWith Uniswap allocating over $3.5M worth of assets for the purpose of growing Uniswap’s market share, it is essential to ensure that the DAO analyses and reviews the impact of these incentives on an ongoing basis.\n\nWhat is Forse?\n\nForse is a data and intelligence platform built by StableLab helping DAOs analyze the impact of governance decisions in protocol growth, top-line metrics, and governance operations, including its cost and effort structures. StableLab is the leading provider of governance products and solutions for decentralized protocols. We work with various projects, from the ones just starting their journey to decentralization to the most prominent DeFi protocols.\n\n\n1600×900 181 KB\n\n1600×1032 166 KB\n\n1600×900 106 KB\nThis service provider engagement grants the Uniswap DAO access to the services of the entire StableLab team. Specifically, three StableLab team members will be the primary points of contact.\n\nTeam\n\nChristian Ziegler is the Tech Lead at StableLab. Previously, he worked as researcher at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where he wrote his doctoral thesis on DAOs. In 2018, he co-founded Blockcurators GmbH. Christian has several published scientific articles, including: a Taxonomy of DAOs; scoring methodologies for DAOs; network analysis of DAOS; classification of DAO proposals using LLMs; among others.\n\nJohannes Loewe is the Data Lead at StableLab, where he focuses on all stages of AI and ML development, from experimentation to deployment. Before joining StableLab, he was a Freelance AI & Blockchain Software Engineer. He also has experience with DAOs, being a founding member of PretzelDAO in Munich. He holds a Bachelor’s degree from Radboud University in the Netherlands and a Master’s degree in Machine Learning from NUI-Galway in Ireland.\n\nMarcos Miranda is the Head of Product at StableLab. With over 5 years of experience in Product Management, with focus on Web3 and Analytics products, he is also experienced in building DeFi protocols, having previously worked for other protocols in the space.\n\nSpecification\n\nBy analyzing the impact of these incentives, Forse by StableLab hopes to identify the following:\n\nImpact quantification of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program in top-line protocol metrics with the isolation of external factors influencing these metrics as far as permitted and reasonably possible.\nUser segmentation and analysis based on archetypes of users to determine the types of users attracted through the incentive program.\nPost-Incentive user retention, reactivation, and user acquisition cost metrics.\nPer-dollar value of incentives compared to other ways of incentivising users (e.g. Airdrops, LP rewards, grants, …).\nUser Retention and activity patterns over the time of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program.\nTo see Forse in action, explore our interactive dashboard showcasing the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program. This provides a great example of what our output could be for Uniswap’s Revitalization and Growth Program.\n\nBudget Request\n\nThe proposal requests $70,000 worth of UNI to analyze the impact of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program so far for 3 blockchains chosen by the Uniswap DAO, with 3 months of additional maintenance support and updates to analytics modules utilized in the live dashboard.\n\nThree Blockchains Chosen by the Uniswap DAO\n\nWe believe it will be better for Uniswap to better understand the impacts of the Incentive program for protocols that are at least sizable. So the options will compose the top 6 blockchains by TVL.\n\nBlockchains\tTVL\nArbitrum\t$2.596b\nBase\t$1.35b\nBlast\t$838.46m\nScroll\t$601.14m\nLinea\t$519.15m\nMantle\t$440.09m\nZksync\t$77.19m\nSei\t$70.62m\nManta\t$39.74m\nMoonbeam\t$31.45m\nPolygon zkEVM\t$13.2m\nTaiko\t$13.29m\nNext Steps\n\n1.Launching Snapshot vote to decide the top 3 blockchains as well as regarding whether to proceed with this proposal\n\n2.Proceed to Onchain Vote if the snapshot vote passes",

      "title": "[TEMP CHECK] Uniswap Onboarding Package - OKX Chain",
      "content": "### Summary:\nThis proposes the deployment of Uniswap v3 on X Layer.\n\n### Background:\nX Layer is a zkEVM Layer 2 network built on Ethereum, powered by Polygon CDK, a zkEVM stack for building Ethereum L2 scaling solutions. Developers can easily deploy their existing contracts on zkEVM, and users can move their assets from Ethereum and conduct transactions off-chain. These transactions are bundled into groups with zero-knowledge proofs to verify their validity.\n\n### Motivation:\nDeploying an instance of Uniswap v3 on X Layer provides numerous opportunities for Uniswap to gain millions of new users from the OKX ecosystem which comprises of approximately 50m. This deployment will be a win-win for both parties as it provides Uniswap with a new user base and revenue stream and X Layer the chance to offer its users access to a battle tested DeFi primitive, which is Uniswap v3.\n\n**Boundless scalability:** 100% EVM compatibility and easy-to-use developer tools for deployment.\n**X Layer is Powered by OKX:** seamless integration to all OKX products, all-in-one Web3 gateway, and access to 50M+ users in the OKX ecosystem.\n**Security:** rely on robust secure mechanisms from Ethereum, with trustless interoperability.\n**Low fee:** same coding experience as Ethereum but 100x cheaper.\n**Portal to Web3:** enter the world of Web3 via OKX Wallet, built with compact infrastructure modules to create innovative DApps.\n\n### Proposal Stakeholders:\nThe following list of stakeholders is present to transparently communicate which entities and individuals are involved in proposal creation and implementation.\n\n### Proposer: Yohaan (X Layer DeFi Strategy)\nThis entity is responsible for authoring the proposal & managing the governance process\n\n#### Deployer: [GFX Labs](https://x.com/labsGFX)\nThis entity is responsible for the technical deployment of the contracts on the target chain\n* GFX Labs will help deploy the v3 contracts on X Layer and has a track record of safely deploying Uniswap v3 on various EVM-compatible chains\n\n#### Frontend: [Oku Trade](https://oku.trade)\nThe initial frontend where users can interact with the new Uniswap v3 deployment\n* Oku is built and managed by GFX Labs\n* Oku was seeded by a Uniswap Foundation grant in 2022\n* Oku supports twelve chains and continues to aid Uniswap’s expansion to new protocols\n\n**Note:** Oku Trade has become the DAO’s go-to third party front-end for Uniswap deployments since the canonical front-end is owned and operated by Uniswap Labs\n\n#### Bridge Provider: [zkEVM Bridge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2a3dd3eb832af982ec71669e178424b10dca2ede#writeProxyContract)\nX Layer mainnet bridge allows you to seamlessly move value between Ethereum and X Layer mainnet and can also be used to send and claim messages to and from Ethereum and X Layer.\n\n#### Target Chain: [X Layer](https://www.okx.com/xlayer)\nThis is the chain that v3 contracts are deployed on\n\n#### Proposal Sponsor: [GFX Labs](https://x.com/labsGFX)\nThis entity has >1M UNI and is therefore eligible for administering the onchain vote\n\n### Liquidity Bootstrapping and Incentives:\n\n#### X Layer’s Commitment:\nX Layer commits $1M worth of liquidity to Uniswap pools on X Layer for a minimum of 6 months. All liquidity will be provided on the day of launch. The tokens will be deployed on Uniswap through the X Layer integration with Oku Trade. All liquidity will be provided immediately upon deploying an instance of Uniswap v3 on X Layer.\n**Pools and liquidity committment:**\n* $500k in OKB/USDT 0.30%\n* $200k in OKB/USDC 0.30%\n* $200k in OKB/wETH 0.30%\n* $100k in USDC/USDT 0.05%\n\n#### Community Multisig for Liquidity Provisioning:\nThe liquidity committment made by X layer will be sent to a Gnosis Safe on X Layer prior to launch with signers from OKX, Oku Trade and select Uniswap Delegates.\n\n#### Deployment Details:\nIf no major points of contention are posed by the DAO during the RFC, the Accountability Committee will\n* Optimistically approve this deployment and consider the deployed contracts on the X layer as canonical, and a comment will be posted on this forum with all the verified contracts\n* As is the case with all canonical v3 deployments, this deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3-deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended by the Accountability Committee to include the reference to the stated v3 contracts on X Layer.\n\n#### Timeline:\n**July 2024:** RFC\n**August 2024:** Liquidity commitment Temp Check\n**August 2024:** Onchain vote to approve onboarding package\n**September 2024:** Uni v3 contracts as well as front end on Oku Trade will be deployed by GFX Labs",

      "title": "[Temp Check] Uniswap Onboarding Package - Gnosis Chain",
      "content": "### Outline\n\n- Overview\n- Motivation\n- About Gnosis Chain\n- Benefits to Uniswap\n- Cost and Timeline\n- Stakeholders\n\n### Overview\nGnosis Chain is a community-owned, EVM-compatible network operated by a diverse set of 200k+ validators around the world. In the last two quarters (Q4 2023 and Q1 2024), Gnosis Chain experienced significant growth reaching over $300 Million in TVL. The DeFi sector added numerous established blue chip projects and now powers a vibrant ecosystem including Spark, Aave, Balancer, Curve, CoW Swap, 1inch and Connext among others.\n\nSince Gnosis Chain’s focus on revolutionising the payments infrastructure to make decentralized financial tools accessible and usable for all, we feel it fitting for Uniswap to tap into the ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal requests a retroactive Onboarding Package for Gnosis Chain.\n\n### Motivation\nWhile already deployed on Gnosis Chain, Uniswap is not currently capitalizing on it. This proposal aims to change that.\n\nOne of the key areas of focus suggested by the Uniswap Deployments Accountability Committee to expand the Uniswap ecosystem is “Uniswap Revitalization and Growth”. In their recent work, a large emphasis is on revisiting some of the old deployments and proactively capturing first-mover advantage on promising new chains.\n\nAs Gnosis Chain experienced significant growth across Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, we believe the chain aligns perfectly with the scope of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth initiative. Uniswap’s deployment on Gnosis Chain was completed in early 2022, hence Gnosis Chain was never a beneficiary of the “Onboarding Package” that is now included as a standard element of deployment proposals.\n\nWe believe there are synergies between Uniswap and Gnosis Chain as well as a strong potential for Gnosis Chain to generate high volumes and mobilize an influx of new users to Uniswap because of its focus on payments and financial tools.\n\nAs a comparison, Balancer processed over $590 Million in volumes YTD (end of May) on Gnosis Chain, making it the second-largest alternative EVM market for the DeFi protocol (similarly to Uniswap, Arbitrum is the first). Gnosis Chain has a larger positive impact on Balancer’s volumes than other more prominent networks like Polygon ($284M YTD) or Base ($80.8M YTD).\n\nWe believe that additional visibility and an incentive program would enable both Uniswap and Gnosis Chain to tap into their synergies resulting in positive growth on both ends.\n\n### About Gnosis Chain\nGnosis Chain is a community-owned, EVM-compatible network operated by a diverse set of 200k+ validators around the world. It features fast transaction times (5 seconds) and low transaction fees (500 tx for $0.01) with the unique advantage of having a stable token as a base asset for transactions and gas fees.\n\nOne of the first Ethereum sidechains, Gnosis Chain’s core values are resilience and credible neutrality. By allowing contributors to easily run a node, Gnosis Chain created a community-owned, anti-fragile network secured by a geographically diverse validator set. Its strong culture of at-home stakers (not reliant on cloud providers or data centres) and its community governance ensure Gnosis Chain remains credibly neutral at a lower price point than Mainnet.\n\nGnosis Chain underpins the Gnosis collective of aligned projects revolutionising the payments infrastructure to make decentralised financial tools accessible and usable for all. The collective features established blue chip projects like Safe as well as prominent ones like Gnosis Pay and Monerium.\n\nIn the last two quarters (Q4 2023 and Q1 2024), Gnosis Chain experienced significant growth reaching over $300 Million in TVL. The DeFi sector added numerous established blue chip projects and now powers a vibrant ecosystem including Spark, Aave, Balancer, Curve, CoW Swap, 1inch and Connext among others.\n\n### Benefits to Uniswap\nThe [Multichain Uniswap](https://blog.uniswap.org/multichain-uniswap) approach has proven successful with approx. [35% of trading volumes](https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/uniswap) in the last 6 months come from non-Ethereum-Mainnet deployments.\n\nSince Gnosis Chain’s focus on revolutionising the payments infrastructure to make decentralized financial tools accessible and usable for all, we feel it fitting for Uniswap to tap into the ecosystem. The potential for Uniswap to capture the inflow of new and existing users leveraging Gnosis Chain as a payments infrastructure is a promising opportunity for the project to reach a new audience.\n\nGnosis Chain underpins the Gnosis collective of aligned projects, building synergic services to Uniswap. Among those, Safe and Gnosis Pay. Safe Smart Accounts count 9.1 Million accounts deployed with $100B+ in total assets stored and VIP individuals (e.g. Vitalik) using them. Gnosis Pay is the world’s first on-chain spending account with a Visa Debit Card linked to a self-custodial blockchain wallet, connected with 80 Million merchants worldwide. Roll-out in Europe and the United Kingdom has already started, with upcoming new Countries including Brazil and Argentina. That is a combined population of approx. 1.45 Billion people.\n\nAdditionally, Gnosis Chain powers a growing DeFi sector with numerous blue chip projects added since Q4 2023. These include Aave, whose market on Gnosis Chain has grown rapidly since its launch 7 months ago and is now larger than the lending protocol’s markets on Base and Scroll (as of May 2024). sDAI (MakerDAO’s interest-earning DAI) accumulated over $68 Million TVL since October 2023. Focusing on the on-chain trading vertical, Balancer processed over $590 Million in volumes YTD (end of May) on Gnosis Chain, making it the second-largest alternative EVM market for the DeFi protocol (similarly to Uniswap, Arbitrum is the first). This means, Gnosis Chain has a larger positive impact on Balancer’s volumes than other more prominent networks like Polygon ($284M YTD) or Base ($80.8M YTD).\n\nBased on the above and observing Uniswap’s performance across blockchains, we anticipate the protocol will replicate its success in capturing market share on Gnosis Chain.\n\n### Bridges\nGnosis Chain is committed to providing easy and secure access to Ethereum L1 and other Layer 1 and Layer 2 ecosystems. For this reason, multiple bridging options are available to connect with Gnosis Chain.\n\nThe [Omnibridge](https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/About%20Token%20Bridges/omnibridge) is a native token bridge that connects Ethereum and Gnosis Chain (and vice-versa) by minting the canonical representation of bridged assets on Gnosis. The Omnibridge is built on top of the [Arbitrary Message Bridge (AMB)](https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/About%20Token%20Bridges/amb-bridge), a key bridge primitive that is used inside higher-order bridges like the Omnibridge and allows Gnosis contracts to send data and trigger contract functions on Ethereum and vice-versa. Therefore, the Omnibridge relies on the same trust models and group of [Trusted Bridge Validators](https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/management/validators#amb--omnibridge) as the AMB. Part of these validators is Succinct Lab’s zkSNARK-enabled Light Client, Telepathy. Telepathy is a key component of the AMB bridge ecosystem as it enhances security and reliability for cross-chain transactions by providing validity proofs via zkSNARKs that ensure trustless verification of transaction events across chains.\n\nThe [xDAI bridge](https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/About%20Token%20Bridges/xdai-bridge) is a native DAI bridge from Ethereum that is used to mint and burn xDAI, the native asset used for gas and transaction fees on Gnosis.\n\nGnosis has a long-term roadmap to move towards trustless bridges and is investing resources into trust-minimization of its bridges, to ensure trust and safety of users. [Hashi](https://crosschain-alliance.gitbook.io/hashi) is an EVM Hash Oracle Aggregator designed to enhance cross-chain bridge security by aggregating block headers from various sources. It supports 15+ General Message Passing bridges and ZK light clients, promoting redundancy and reducing reliance on single mechanisms. By requiring validation from multiple independent mechanisms, Hashi ensures greater resilience against security incidents. Gnosis plans to [gradually migrate](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-93-should-gnosisdao-support-the-integration-of-hashi-within-gnosis-chains-canonical-bridges/8245) its canonical bridges to Hashi’s distributed trust model with the goal of strengthening security, decentralisation and interoperability.\n\nAdditionally, Gnosis Chain is supported within independent bridge solutions that enable the cross-chain connection with other Layer 1 and Layer 2 ecosystems. These include Jumper (provided by Li.Fi), Bungee, Hop, Connext, DLN (debridge), LayerZero, Chainlink CCIP and Wormhole.\n\nCost and Timeline\nThis proposal requests a retroactive Onboarding Package for Gnosis Chain as well as costs for Merkl and Oku integrations. To be voted on Snapshot:\n\n$250k\n$500k\n$750k\n$1m\nDo Not Fund\nAbstain\nPlease note that each of the options with incentives will include a Oku and Merkl integration package (21.6k and 105k).\n\nStakeholders\nProposal sponsor - [karpatkey](https://www.karpatkey.com/). karpatkey is a delegate both in the Uniswap DAO and in the Gnosis DAO.\n\nDeployer - The relevant smart contracts have already been deployed.\n\nTarget chain: Gnosis Chain by [GnosisDAO](https://www.gnosis.io/about)",

      "title": "Uniswap Arbitrum LTIPP Matching",
      "content": "### TLDR:\n\n* In April, the UADP submitted an application to participate in the Arbitrum LTIPP (long term incentive program pilot)\n* We were able to receive 1,000,000 of ARB, the largest amount out of all other DEX applicants\n* In our application, we stated that “the UADP will request the Uni DAO to decide whether or not it wants to partially match this 1.0M ARB ask. The options the DAO has to vote on are four: $250k, $500k, $750k, and $1M. We cannot guarantee that the DAO will vote to match incentives, but we will make a best-effort attempt and report the results of the temperature check”\n* We will be collaborating with Gauntlet and Merkl to distribute the incentives (cost breakdowns are below)\n* To those ends, we are running this temperature check to see if the DAO is interested in matching the given LTIPP grant to some capacity\n\n### About the LTIPP Application\n\nUniswap did not apply to the first two rounds of Arbitrum incentives (STIP 1 & 2). This was for two reasons:\n\n* Native DEXs and smaller protocols deserve a chance to make a name for themselves and perhaps offer unique protocols for trading\n* We did not have a formal structure like the UADP to help facilitate an application\n\nSince many native DEXs–and non-native ones–have already had the chance to apply for ARB incentives throughout the past year across multiple incentive distribution initiatives, the UADP decided that it’s now the right time for Uniswap to also partake in these programs, especially since other blue-chip protocols also applied for these incentives. Plus, the establishment of this committee has allowed Uniswap DAO to further mature its relationship with Arbitrum DAO. We’ve partaken in multiple discourses, participating in all of the votes taking place on Arbitrum since November 2023.\n\nThe LTIPP pilot program is a 3-month long incentive program, with 45M worth of ARB to be distributed among an elected group of protocols. A total of 174 applications were vetted by the LTIPP Advisors, with whom we interacted and obtained feedback during the month of March. One of the primary sticking points was the amount of capital that we initially requested, along with clarifications around some of the target KPIs behind our request.\n\nAfter some deliberation, in line with many other projects, we ended up lowering our ARB ask from 2.5M to 1M, which increased our chances of being admitted into the program by the Advisors and ARB delegates. Uniswap was able to attain the largest amount of incentives from the cohort of DEX applicants:.\n\n### Uniswap LTIPP Grant Structure and Execution\n\nBelow is a breakdown of how the LTIPP funds will be used:\n\n* 900k ARB for incentives: 882k ARB: The bulk of these funds will be used to incentivize liquidity providers on Uniswap using Gauntlet’s dynamic optimization engine. 18k ARB: For Merkl to distribute the funds. Merkl charges based on a percentage of the incentives distributed.\n* 85k ARB for Gauntlet: they will dedicate part of its Applied Research team, the same team currently managing the Uniswap/Arbitrum liquidity mining program, to this initiative.\n* 15k ARB for UADP: These funds will be sent to the UADP multisig with the goal of making this meta-governance initiative a self-sustaining program. This will allow Uniswap DAO to maintain its voting participation in the Arbitrum DAO.\n\nIn order for us to accept this grant, we had to elect three signers onto a Gnosis Safe, and each member had to follow Arbitrum Foundation’s KYC process.\n\n\n\nMultisig Address: 0x1026D3D219098D7b1B0A180F7E557DEeA7DA82C1 (⅔ Signers)\n\n* @Juanbug (UADP), 0xB8Dcad009E533066F12e408075E10E3a30F1f15A\n* @AbdullahUmar (UADP), 0x3d0e30031b547737fFCf13c127350159A6C4ce17\n* Picodes (Merkl), 0x34Eb88EAD486A09CAcD8DaBe013682Dc5F1DC41D\n\nAll performance reporting will be conducted by Gauntlet, just as they have been providing analytics regarding their previous Arb-Uniswap incentive program.\n\n### Incentive Matching\n\nIt’s clear that Uniswap has a steeped history with Arbitrum. We are currently the dominant DEX by TVL and volume on the L2. After ETH L1, Arbitrum is where Uniswap has the largest stronghold. It is therefore important for delegates to potentially consider doubling down on this ecosystem.\n\nUniswap DAO and Arbitrum DAO have also conducted themselves symbiotically ever since Uniswap launched on the L2 in August, 2021. Below are some contributions that Uniswap has made to the Arbitrum ecosystem in the past year alone:\n\n* Gauntlet has shipped out a Dynamic Incentive Optimization for Uniswap V3\n* Uniswap/Arbitrum liquidity mining mid-point retrospective\n* Set up a Uniswap-Arbitrum Working Group\n* Funded a ~$2m Uniswap-Arbitrum Grants Program\n* Created an active Metagovernance group (Uniswap-Arbitrum Delegate Program)\n\nAs mentioned, it is up to Uniswap delegates to decide whether or not matching is favorable. Doing so would signify to the Arbitrum community our continued support, and in the UADP’s opinion, allow for further collaboration and grants in the future. If any funds are approved, they will follow a similar distribution structure and execution as above and be grouped together in Gauntlet’s incentives allocation.\n\n\n\nWe recently ran a snapshot where the options were: $1m, $750k, $500k, $250k, Do Not Fund\n\nThe snapshot finished with the winner being $750k, hence we will move forward with this being the amount proposed. We will use the price of $9.74 per UNI for calculations.

      "content": "**Summary**\n\nThis proposal outlines the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative, a compensation program designed to improve participation quality and dedication among Uniswap delegates. The initiative was developed by several members of the Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group, which conducted extensive research and produced findings supporting the implementation of such a program.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn late February 2024, StableLab proposed the [Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-delegate-reward/22909). After the GovSwap event in Denver, further research to plan and implement the Delegate Reward Initiative was highlighted, leading to the formation of the Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group, composed of 8 members from different organizations. After extensive research for more than a month, the Working Group produced several findings, which can be found [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702).\n\nThe details of the findings were slightly different. However, this conclusion summarized the findings quite nicely:\n\n*“There was a general consensus across most categories that a compensation program for delegates could improve participation quality and dedication. However, the enthusiasm varied, with those deeply involved in governance showing the strongest support.”*\n\nThe Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group explored several frameworks for implementing rewards, including a Committee structure that allows several non-delegates to get rewarded for helping to contribute to various scopes. However, some non-delegates in the Working Group preferred the Delegate-only model while other non-delegates in the Group suggested other alternatives.\n\nTherefore, we believe that the delegate-focused structure can be launched, but other members can also propose structures that focus on different aspects, ultimately leaving the decision up to governance.\n\n**Proposal Details**\n\n**Qualified Applicants for the First Cycle**\n\nThere were 14 delegates who qualified for the application and applied for the first cycle. After examining both Voting Participation, Proposal Authorship, and Other Governance Participation, top 12 delegates were chosen. The details can be found [here ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WXf8Z2AnLIyKGNKYjKKsfb-c-d1hmCLAX-5rYAbiHDk/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n**Delegate Reward Eligibility**\n\nThe qualified Delegates need to fulfill the following to be eligible for up to $6,000 USD worth of $UNI reward per month.\n\n**Requirements**\n\n1\\. Maintain 80% onchain and offchain voting participation for the past 3 months. Achieving this will provide $3,000 USD worth of $UNI\n\n**Additional (only available if the above Requirement of Voting Participation is fulfilled)**\n\n2\\. Write rationale for the voting on their delegate profile. Achieving this will provide an additional $3,000 USD worth of $UNI\n\n**Budget**\n\nWe are requesting 216,000 \\[ 6000 \\*3 \\* 12] USD worth of UNI for the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative, plus an additional 64,000 USD (40 hours \\* 8 members \\* 200 USD per hour) worth of UNI as a retroactive reward for the Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group. The Working Group members will be required to share their hours.&#x20;\n\nThe total amount of 280,000 USD worth of UNI, 27,000 UNI at the time of the writing, once approved, will be sent to the Accountability Committee, which will be responsible for the monthly distribution of rewards to eligible delegates and retroactive reward for the Working Group members. In the unlikely scenario that the budget is depleted before the end of the 3-month cycle, Cycle 1 will end early.&#x20;",

      "title": "DeFi Education Fund",
      "content": "**Proposal Overview**\n\n[Temp Check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0xf17f3ca6b3d1aa6d8061a733fc0d627558159e0057f76ddfe056ea492cf56163)\n\n[Governance Thread](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-supporting-the-defi-education-fund/23631/)\n\nSince its founding via a timely Uniswap Governance governance proposal in 2021, the [DeFi Education Fund ](https://www.defieducationfund.org/) (DEF) has fought to advance and protect the potential of DeFi in the public policy sphere. The threat that misguided policies and overreaching regulators pose to DeFi has never been clearer. [GFX Labs](https://twitter.com/labsGFX) is bringing this proposal  to a vote to provide DEF with one million UNI tokens in two tranches to support them in fulfilling their mission, half of which will be locked up in a streaming contract that will “vest” linearly over 12 months. Governance can vote to stop the streaming of those tokens at any time.\n\nDeFi promises to revolutionize how people engage in economic activities. In particular, the openly accessible and decentralized characteristics of DeFi protocols means that anyone with an internet connection and a wallet can participate in the global economy in a way that would not be possible without DeFi. To do so, DeFi upends the structure of traditional financial services and related policy making approaches. That upending has brought with it intense interest, suspicion, and hostility from entrenched interests and regulatory bodies around the world.\n\nDEF has defended DeFi from legislative threats that would require DeFi developers to implement protocol access restrictions or requirements designed for CeFi businesses; regulatory proposals that would mandate centralization if finalized; and in the courts against overzealous regulators. In late March, we sued the SEC over its policy on airdrops and its campaign of regulation by enforcement that is crippling DeFi and crypto development and participation in the United States.\n\nOver the last few years, DeFi’s policy challenges have become more real, more imminent, and more numerous. For example, in the U.S. alone, there are at least half a dozen bills actively under consideration in Congress and two rulemakings pending finalization that would effectively prohibit DeFi development. Luckily, public policy education and advocacy has borne—and can continue to bear—fruit for DeFi.\n\nWithout doubt, building a public policy environment welcoming of DeFi and decentralized governance will be a long and arduous struggle, but we know that Uniswap Governance shares our commitment to winning that debate—and it is winnable—so that the benefits of DeFi can be felt and enjoyed by as many people as possible, as quickly as possible.\n\nDEF is eager to continue leading the fight on behalf of DeFi. With additional resources, we can build out our team:\n\n1. super charge our impact litigation efforts to reshape the legal landscape to DeFi and DAOs’ benefit;\n2. expand our outreach to legislators and double down on our educational efforts;\n3. more vigorously challenge the regulatory onslaught targeting DeFi; and\n4. enhance our ability to engage in state-level debates and jurisdictions outside of the United States.\n\nIf DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from the myriad policy risks it faces while proactively laying the foundation for longterm policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. We stand ready and able to do so with the community’s backing and appreciate your consideration.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nDeFi’s policy challenges are immense and interest in DeFi has only grown since the DEF got to work in 2021. Following the collapse of FTX and with the return of the bull market, there is acute interest in DeFi on Capitol Hill and state legislatures, as well as inside federal and state government agencies. Providing meaningful educational outreach about DAOs and DeFi to lawmakers while also assisting in the legal defense of decentralized organizations is a role not played by anyone else in the US.\n\nAt this time, DAOs and DeFi protocols face several potentially catastrophic threats: a live IRS proposal would mandate the creation of intermediaries to conduct tax reporting (i.e., ban on disintermediated systems) and a live SEC rulemaking would define anyone loosely related to a DeFi protocol—including the underlying chain’s miners/validators—to be national securities exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange. Moreover, bills written to regulate CeFi often inadvertently capture DeFi protocols and subject them to compliance obligations designed for CeFi businesses.\n\nIf DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from these myriad policy risks while laying the foundation for longterm proactive policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. There is a reason TradFi businesses collectively spend over $1 billion per year on U.S. lobbying and policy efforts: it works, and we’re making it work for DeFi.\n\nDEF focuses specifically on fighting for policy outcomes favorable to decentralized finance developers and users on the ground in Washington, DC. A summary of our past work, which has included defending DAOs in court, as well as providing comment and consultation to regulators to avoid burdensome rules and regulations in the US and around the world, below. This proposal would expand our budget so that we can expand our legislative, regulatory, and legal advocacy and education efforts on behalf of DeFi and DAO developers and users.\n\nIf DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from policy risks while proactively laying the foundation for longterm policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. We stand ready and able to do so with the community’s backing, and we appreciate your consideration.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe DeFi Education Fund is a nonprofit organization with a demonstrated history of being in the trenches fighting for DAOs and decentralized finance. Whether looking to provide legal assistance when DAOs and their members are targeted, providing educational resources, or fighting for policy changes, the DeFi Education Fund is the only major crypto advocate that focuses solely on decentralized web3.\n\n**FAQs**\n\n*Why are you raising money now if you have about two years of runway at your current burn?*\n\nWe are seeking Uniswap Governance’s further support now for three primary reasons.\n\nFirst, we need a good sense of our longer term funding in order to expand our efforts and take on the long term projects that our work often requires, which can play out over several years. For example, our legal challenge of the patent covering oracle tech that is being used against DAOs will likely take a total of at least two years from start to finish. Our lawsuit against the SEC will probably last several years. If we did not have a good expectation of being able to operate two years after starting those efforts, we would not have been able to take them on at all. In addition, because we hold tokens long term, we are exposed to crypto market price fluctuations.\n\nSecond, unexpected, ad hoc projects that we are well-positioned to take on in defense of DeFi can be extremely expensive. For example, we expect the challenge to the oracle patent to cost nearly $500,000 over its entire course. A legal challenge to proposed rules that would de facto ban DeFi in the United States would cost well over $1m. We have no ability to predict with certainty when and if those expenditures will be necessary, and without a sense of our longer term funding situation, we can’t take on those types of unexpected, but critical, projects while also expanding our day to day efforts and team.\n\nDeFi needs more dedicated advocates working on its behalf. With a larger budget, we can hire more people.\n\n*When and how would you plan on selling this proposal’s tokens?*\n\nIt is important to us that DEF remains aligned with the DeFi community and our supporters over the long term. Upon passage, 500k $UNI tokens will be transferred to DEF’s on-chain Coinbase $UNI [wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb39cb7Eb25CE07470Fb59F7548979Fae0Bb85824), and 500k will be locked up in a streaming contract that will “vest” linearly over 12 months. Governance can vote to stop the streaming of the remaining tokens at any time.\n\nWe will hold half of any tokens we receive for at least 12 months from the date we receive them, and we will pre-disclose all sales plans in writing.\n\n*How are you going to keep Uniswap Governance up to date on your activities?*\n\nThe DEF team will host monthly community calls that Uniswap community members can join to hear updates on our work, learn about high priority policy and regulatory developers, and have questions answered. We’ll also keep a thread on the Uniswap governance forum up to date with our monthly updates.\n\n*What about the tokens from the 2021 proposal?*\n\nWe received our initial grant of one million $UNI tokens from the Uniswap Governance in July 2021 and sold half of the tokens shortly thereafter. In February 2024, we began selling portions of the other half of the tokens according to an 18 month written [sales plan](https://www.defieducationfund.org/post/def-provides-update-on-our-funding). We will sell in July 2025 the last of the UNI tokens we received in July 2021.\n\n*Why are you asking us for money and not other DAOs?*\n\nWe are, and we will definitely continue to “pass around the hat”! We seek Uni governance’s continued support as a community that is building for the long term. Uniswap Governance took a massive “leap of faith” in generously funding an organization that did not yet exist to do work that would benefit every DeFi project and DAO. We hope that our track record of work has proven valuable to DeFi projects and users such that Uni governance and other projects’ governance will continue to contribute to our work going forward.",

      "title": "[Temp Check] Onboard Uniswap to Redstone",
      "content": "## TLDR:\nThe proposal to deploy Uniswap on Redstone has completed the 7-day RFC phase. All contracts have been deployed and verified. This deployment has therefore been optimistically approved by the Uni DAO. We will now turn to a temperature check to vote on whether or not the DAO would like to employ the Uniswap Onboarding Package to help incentivize Uniswap pools on Redstone. This vote also includes a veto option, allowing any delegates who hold a dissenting opinion to veto this deployment altogether.\n\n* Redstone will not be providing any incentive matching, nor will they be bootstrapping liquidity on their end.\n\n## Onboarding Package:\nThe purpose of the Uniswap Onboarding Package is to allow new deployments of Uniswap v3 to get set up with three months’ worth of liquidity incentives, a frontend, and an incentive distribution tool like Merkl. These resources will help position Uniswap to have a formidable presence on new EVM chains.\n\n### Criteria for Package Adoption:\nThis off-chain vote will be used to determine how much in incentives–if any–the DAO would like to allocate to this deployment. The options are as follows:\n\n* Incentivize $250k\n* Incentivize $500k\n* Incentivize $750k\n* Incentivize $1M\n* Deploy without incentives\n* Veto this deployment altogether\n\nThis temp check will be considered met as long as the total number of votes cast for the funding options is over >10M. If there isn't a clear winner for which level of incentives the chain should receive, a discussion can be had before the onchain proposal. All incentives will be distributed to LPs in terms of $UNI on the target chain.\n\n## Further Details:\n\n* Incentivized pools will primarily be blue chips like wETH-USDC–and any local pools if applicable. The onchain vote will include the final details for pool info.\n* The Accountability Committee will escrow the inflight incentives.\n* The DAO will not be using the funds from this vote for front-end integration and maintenance since Redstone has covered this cost.\n* Angle Merkl will be paid for incentive distribution. The fixed integration cost going to Merkl for this deployment is €20k.\n* Angle Merkl charges 3% on incentives distributed with their system. They have offered a 25% discount on their base 3% fee for incentives distributed between $2.5m-$5m, a 50% discount on incentives distributed between $5m-$10m, and a 75% discount on all incentives above $10m in a 365-day period. The Accountability Committee will be responsible for ensuring that the DAO attains properly discounted rates.\n  * Example scenario: if $500k of incentives are voted in, and the Merkl take rate is 3%, then the grand total that’ll be requested from the DAO during the onchain vote will be $500k + $15k + €20k = ~536,664",

      "title": "[Temp Check] Uniswap Delegate Reward -3 Months-Cycle 1",
      "content": "Summary\n\nThis proposal outlines the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative, a compensation program designed to improve participation quality and dedication among Uniswap delegates. The initiative was developed by several members of the Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group, which conducted extensive research and produced findings supporting the implementation of such a program.\n\nBackground\n\nIn late February 2024, StableLab proposed the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative 8. After the GovSwap event in Denver, further research to plan and implement the Delegate Reward Initiative was highlighted, leading to the formation of the Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group, composed of 8 members from different organizations. After extensive research for more than a month, the Working Group produced several findings, which can be found here: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702 7\n\nThe details of the findings were slightly different. However, this conclusion summarized the findings quite nicely:\n\n“There was a general consensus across most categories that a compensation program for delegates could improve participation quality and dedication. However, the enthusiasm varied, with those deeply involved in governance showing the strongest support.”\n\nThe Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group explored several frameworks for implementing rewards, including a Committee structure that allows several non-delegates to get rewarded for helping to contribute to various scopes. However, some non-delegates in the Working Group preferred the Delegate-only model while other non-delegates in the Group suggested other alternatives.\n\nTherefore, we believe that the delegate-focused structure can be launched, but other members can also propose structures that focus on different aspects, ultimately leaving the decision up to governance.\n\nProposal Details\n\nApplication Eligibility\n\nThere will be a week-long period for delegate candidates to submit their applications. If there are more than 11 eligible candidates, then the top 11 will be decided based on objective metrics outlined below. Considering past onchain votes, 19-21 delegates have been a consistent contributor amount to the voting, this acts as a mechanism to prevent sybil attack while also ensuring delegates who might have lesser voting power can be rewarded as well.\n\nFor the first cycle, the eligibility for the application will be\n\nAt least been a delegate for 3 months or more\nVoting Power of 10k $UNI or more OR Authored or co-authored a proposal that at least passed the Snapshot Vote\nThe reason for the application eligibility was that the first cycle should be focusing on Delegates that have been committed to Uniswap DAO, and ideally, the Initiative can encourage more to participate and thus more delegates will be eligible by Cycle 2.\n\nMetrics for Selection of Top 11 Candidates\n\nIn case there are more than 11 eligible applicants, the top 11 will be chosen by the following objective metrics. The highest point would be 10.\n\n1. Voting Participation\n\n-Considering one of the primary roles of the delegate is to receive voting power from their delegators to vote on behalf for the best of Uniswap, voting participation are crucial to ensure quorums are met and malicious proposals are prevented. The Full point from this category is 5. The onchain part is weighted more heavily due to its usual frictions such as gas cost, as well as its importance that its votes directly can dictate code changes or treasury. The voting rate is based on the past 3 months.\n\n1. Offchain Voting (Snapshot)\n\n80% and above : 2\n70% till 80% : 1.5\n60% till 70%: 1\n50% or below but above 0%: 0.5\n0% : 0\n2.Onchain Voting\n\n80% and above : 3\n70% till 80% : 2.25\n60% till 70%: 1.5\n50% or below but above 0%: 0.75\n0% : 0\n2. Proposal Authorship\n\n-Helping to write proposals for Uniswap DAO is important. However, we also want to prevent low-quality or malicious proposals. Therefore, only passed votes would count. The full point for this category is 4. The onchain part is weighted more heavily as it’s more difficult to have a proposal to pass the onchain vote as well as its importance that its proposals directly can dictate code changes or treasury.\n\nIn case of non-binary proposals, if the choice equivalent to “No” was present, and the end voting result was another choice than “No”, then it would be considered as valid for below. For example, Uniswap Treasury Working Group (UTWG) Election wouldn’t be valid for the points as there’s no “No” vote . But [Temp] Uni Onboarding Package - BSC would be valid for the points as there was a choice of “Against”. And the voting result was “$1m”.\n\n1. Authored or Co authored a proposal that passed offchain (snapshot) vote before.\n\nYes, 2 or more : 1\nYes, 1 : 0.5\nNo: 0\n2.Authored or Co authored a proposal that passed onchain vote before\n\nYes, 2 or more : 3\nYes, 1 : 1.5\nNo: 0\n3. Other Governance Participation\n\n-The full point for this category is 1. This category is to recognize other ways one could contribute to discussion regarding Uniswap Governance. This can be achieved by either\n\n1. Joined Uniswap Gov Workshop Before\n\nYes: 1\nNo: 0\nOr\n\n2. Joined Uniswap Community Call Before\n\nYes: 1\nNo: 0\nTie Breaker\n\n-In rare cases if there are ties, this will be first decided by how many “likes” one received on the forum. Considering likes would ideally be tied to how many posts one has made and also how liked their posts are. We believe this is a fair way to have them as Tie Breakers.\n\nDelegate Reward Eligibility\n\nOnce Delegates have passed the application process, the Delegates need to fulfill the following to be eligible for up to $6,000 USD worth of $UNI reward per month.\n\nRequirements\n\nMaintain 80% onchain and offchain voting participation for the past 3 months. Achieving this will provide $3,000 USD worth of $UNI\nAdditional (only available if the above Requirement of Voting Participation is fulfilled)\n\nWrite rationale for the voting on their delegate profile. Achieving this will provide an additional $3,000 USD worth of $UNI\n\nBudget\nWe are requesting 198,000 [ 6000 *3 * 11] USD worth of UNI for the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative, plus an additional 64,000 USD (40 hours * 8 members * 200 USD per hour) worth of UNI as a retroactive reward for the Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group.\n\nThe total amount of 262,000 USD worth of UNI, once approved, will be sent to the Accountability Committee, which will be responsible for the monthly distribution of rewards to eligible delegates and retroactive reward for the Working Group members. In the unlikely scenario that the budget is depleted before the end of the 3-month cycle, Cycle 1 will end early.",

      "content": "![]()**Authors:** [<u>Abdullah</u>](https://twitter.com/abdullahbumar) (Arana Digital) & [<u>Doo</u>](https://twitter.com/DooWanNam) (StableLab)\n\n### Summary:\n\n* The Uniswap DAO's treasury, containing assets worth nearly ~$6B, predominantly in $UNI tokens, faces challenges due to its single-asset composition and the lack of a plan for productive utilization. \n* To address the treasury's volatility and underutilization, we propose forming the Uniswap Treasury Working Group (UTWG) to explore treasury management strategies aimed at achieving sustainability and growth for the DAO. The UTWG will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO based on 8 weeks of research and interviews with various entities and individuals familiar with treasury management and adjacent subject matters. \n* The UTWG will be composed of four members. StableLab and Arana Digital are a part of working group zero (WG0). They have been helping administer and organize this proposal for the past couple of weeks. The other two members, Karpatkey and Franklin DAO, [<u>have been elected via a Snapshot vote</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0x7584aabd34944953f37008d4a6209e4efee8f1a066a5051fbba37910dae80b49). The elected members, along with WG0, will be responsible for helping conduct research and aiding in proposing the final deliverables to the DAO. \n* A deliverable will correspondingly be released on the forum where we present at least two viable treasury management options for the DAO to begin pursuing. Both of these options will be presented as their individual RFC/RFP, ideally allowing various treasury managers to present their products and services to the DAO. The UTWG will help facilitate this process. \n* We hope that a simultaneous discussion around, say, DUNA, or other legal frameworks, takes place. It seems unlikely that the DAO will be able to conduct treasury management if it doesn’t open itself up to adopting a legal architecture. Our hope is that while the Foundation and potentially another working group sort out the legal side, we are able to make some strides on treasury management research. Upon adoption of a legal entity, we can then hit the ground running by actually implementing the conclusions derived from the UTWG’s research. \n\n![]()**Treating the Uniswap Treasury as an Endowment**\n\n“Treasury” is a broad term that typically mirrors the nature of its underlying protocol. Some treasuries quite literally reflect a protocol’s balance sheet, where the holdings are used to cover capital expenditures, and income is either paid out as a dividend to token holders or used to further grow the protocol. Other treasuries are integral in managing risk, with Aave and Compound being prime examples. Then, some treasuries, like that of Uniswap, are structured more similarly to an endowment, where the DAO must manage a large pool of capital to further the sustenance of the protocol in the long-term.\n\n\n\nThe concept of an endowment refers to a collective pool of assets held by a nonprofit institution. These assets are employed to support an institution perpetually, with a clear directive of aligning with the desires of the contributing donor(s). In Uniswap’s case, the DAO was established upon the creation of the $UNI token–and 43% of the total supply was endowed to the DAO. \n\n![]()The goal of the DAO is to support Uniswap’s growth and development in a manner that aligns with the collective vision of the token holders and their entrusted cohort of delegates. These objectives can be achieved by funding development projects, liquidity incentives, community grants, and other programs that contribute to the ecosystem's growth and resilience. ***However, such pursuits cannot be facilitated without robust treasury management.***\n\n\n\n### The Native Token Problem\n\nThe Uniswap treasury is often touted as one of the largest sums of capital at the disposal of a DAO. As of today, Uniswap’s treasury boasts nearly ~$6B of assets, larger than any other DeFi protocol. That number, however, is highly inflated due to the composition of the treasury. Nearly 100% of the treasury is solely composed of one asset: the native $UNI token. Hence, the value of the treasury, in dollar terms, should be massively discounted.\n\nImagine if a traditional endowment was allotted billions of dollars in a singular, volatile asset, with a directive of using that treasury to sustain its core business–preposterous, right? That’s exactly the position where Uniswap is. What’s more is that there’s no current plan to mobilize this treasury in a productive manner. There lies a large amount of dormant capital simply sitting in the treasury without any explicit plan to be utilized. From our perspective, there needs to be an initiative to spur this dormant capital into action, even if it means doing so little by little. ***The goal of this proposal is to create a committee to begin researching ways by which we can put this treasury into effect.*** \n\n \n\n### What Are We Optimizing For? \n\n**This proposal optimizes for two variables:**\n\n\n\n1. ***Sustainability:*** the DAO should be a self-sustaining entity, able to cover its future costs in perpetuity. ****** \n2. ***Growth:*** the DAO should utilize its capital to grow its principal $UNI allotment in terms of dollars, thereby further propelling the adoption of Uniswap and delivering value to relevant stakeholders. \n\nSustainability is the bare minimum. It acts as a floor. Unless the $UNI price continues to increase forever, the DAO, whenever it reaches into its treasury reserves, is reducing its runway. Hence, the first objective in any treasury management initiative should be to diversify out of the native token and into a more stable asset, like a basket of stablecoins. One could go as far as stating that any $UNI held in the treasury should actually be written down to zero. This mindset, where [<u>treasury $UNI is effectively treated as an unissued share,</u>](https://uncommoncore.co/a-new-mental-model-for-defi-treasuries/) should spur us towards diversification. \n\n\n\nSince crypto is prone to fat-tail events, the DAO should establish a more robust cushion in case the market crashes. In 2021, the Uni treasury value ran to nearly $19B, and it quickly fell into a limbo zone between $1.5B - $2B for nearly 1.5 years between Q2 2022 and Q1 2024. No endowment should be this volatile. We should be in a position where if the DAO needs to fund certain initiatives, there are reserves to draw from without causing significant impairment to the token price. For instance, when the Foundation needs to be funded again, it should ideally be the case that a large portion of those requested funds are given in the form of stablecoins for instant liquidity. \n\nBeyond mere diversification, the DAO needs to pursue growth. Currently there are no programs in place for the treasury to increase its net asset value beyond $UNI appreciation. This is where the treasury can be used to generate revenue, either from operating or non-operating activities. Let’s break this concept down–distinguishing between the operating and non-operating income for the DAO is important for defining the source of treasury growth. \n\n\n\n**Operating Income:** Operating income would pertain to any income generated from the primary business activities of the protocol, which, in Uniswap’s case, is fees from swaps. Currently, the DAO does not collect any income from fees and likely won’t in the future under the Uniswap Foundation’s [<u>recently proposed fee architecture</u>](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-activate-uniswap-protocol-governance/22936). ***The Uniswap DAO will therefore not be sustainable in the long-run by relying on income from operations–fees generated will most likely be paid out to token holders in full, leaving the DAO with near zero income. To that end, we must rely on non-operating activities to ensure the sustainability of the Uni DAO.*** \n\n\n\n**Non-Operating Income:** All income not generated from fees falls into this category. If the Uniswap DAO does not plan on attaining revenue from operations, then it must utilize its current treasury to collect income via alternative methods–likely through yield-bearing strategies and investments. Reliance on non-operating income further establishes why the Uni treasury mirrors the setup of an endowment, where the long-term sustainability of the protocol is built on indirect investments detached from the protocol’s core operations. ***These methods are to be further explored, and the present proposal aims to pioneer such exploration.*** \n\n### Working Group Details\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the UTWG will conduct 8 weeks worth of research into the types of treasury management initiatives that the DAO may reasonably pursue in the short-to-medium term. The group will note on the experience of treasury management practices of other DAOs, adopting practices that have historically worked well and conforming them to Uniswap’s current situation, along with the presentation of new models that we believe are potentially more effective. Considering treasury management has been a key aspect of many prominent DAOs like Maker and Aave to Lido and Gnosis, we believe that there are many case studies and frameworks that can be explored to ensure initial experiments will return positive results. \n\n\n\nThe UTWG will also try to collaborate with those working on various legal developments including the recent [<u>Wyoming Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (DUNA) Act</u>](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/duna-for-daos/). This process may fall outside of the jurisdiction of the treasury committee and may require outsourcing entirely to another party. It’s vital that this treasury research is analyzed in the context of potential legal structures, and we won’t move forward with implementing our research unless there are proper legal frameworks in place. The Uniswap DAO has yet to formalize its opinions on how to set up legal entities, so this caveat may delay the implementation of the proposed treasury initiatives. The UTWG’s research may conclude that a legal working group should work in concert with the treasury group to effectively bring this program to fruition. \n\n\n\nIt’s also important to emphasize that the deliverables of the UTWG will aim to highlight potential treasury management options rather than pinpointing specific service providers. If the committee comes to the conclusion that an RFP process is the ideal manner by which treasury managers should be appointed, for example, then one of the UTWG deliverables will be a call to action for various service providers. After ample discussion in the forum, the most promising service providers will qualify for a vote of confidence from the DAO. We will communicate with the Uniswap Accountability Committee to determine how monitoring of this program will proceed in the long run. Depending on a handful of factors, like how much time it’ll operationally take to implement treasury management, it may be best to have the Committee act as the liaison between the treasury managers and the DAO–or out of the UTWG’s research, it may pose more beneficial to sustain this working group long term. The UTWG will also have to communicate with the DAO after the 8-week period to flesh out any further details regarding the proposal, hence there will likely also be an extensive feedback period. The exact structure and timeline regarding the operations beyond the 8-week period are to be determined, and we will keep the DAO posted regarding updates around this process. \n\n\n\nNote that it’s too early in the research process to conclude the exact operations of the treasury initiatives–the above paragraph simply outlines a potential order of operations, which is subject to change based on our research. ***Our*** ***goal is to simply present the DAO with an assortment of options, backed by interviews and research.***\n\n\n\n**The Uniswap Treasury Working Group Members**\n\n\n\nThe UTWG will be composed of four members. StableLab and Arana Digital are a part of working group zero (WG0). They have been helping administer and organize this proposal for the past couple of weeks. The other two members, Karpatkey and Franklin DAO, have been elected via a Snapshot vote. The elected members, along with WG0, will be responsible for helping conduct research and aiding in proposing the final deliverables to the DAO. \n\n\n\n***StableLab***\n\n* StableLab is a governance firm focused on professional delegation, DAO framework design, and product development. StableLab works with various projects, from the ones just starting their journey to decentralization to the most prominent DeFi protocols. They are the leading professional delegate team with a track record across major DeFi protocols, including MakerDAO, Optimism, Aave, 1inch, Balancer, and more. \n\n\n\n***Arana Digital***\n\n* AD is a professional governance group. The team is deeply steeped in the crypto space and has multiple years of participation in protocol governance. With delegation history for DEXs, money markets, L2s, liquid staking protocols, and stablecoins. AD brings a diversity of experience to DAOs–its members have consulted for companies like Immutable and dYdX, worked at crypto investment and trading firms, set up various validator nodes, and run educational events for university students. \n\n\n\n***Franklin DAO***\n\n* Franklin DAO has been an active member of Uniswap’s DAO since we first became delegates ~2 years ago. They pride themselves on having strong working relationships with key members/delegates of the DAO, and contributing in a way that promotes the sustainability and growth of Uniswap. Their team has a variety of experience in directly managing risk + incentives via market parameterization and ML modeling (Ion Protocol). They’ve also worked at notable venture funds like Portal, Galaxy, and Big Brain.\n\n\n\n***Karpatkey***\n\n* Karpatkey has been an active delegate in the Uniswap Protocol since August 2023, with a 93% participation across all voting actions. In addition to our Uniswap DAO contributions, Karpatkey has historically deployed a combined $62.91M worth of LP positions in both Uniswap V2 and V3. They have a team of DeFi engineers, treasury managers and analysts who regularly lead DeFi incentive programs and actively manage treasury assets for various protocols. They serve in treasury roles for AAVE, Balancer, CoW Protol, ENS, Gnosis DAO and Lido.\n\n**Budget** \n\nThe UTWG asks for a budget of 6,000 $UNI. The hourly rate will be the same as the Accountability Committee at $200 per hour. This onchain requests to send the mentioned UNI amount to the Accountability Committee multisig (0x3B59C6d0034490093460787566dc5D6cE17F2f9C). At the end of each month, each of the 4 UTWG members will submit a receipt of worked hours, and the Committee will correspondingly pay the members’ wallets. Retroactive compensation will be distributed to WG0 based on their input hours by the start of the program (i.e. once the onchain vote passes). \n\n### Next Steps\n\nThis program will take effect starting the week of May 20th and will conclude during the week of July 15th–at which point the UTWG will present its research publicly to the DAO. The conclusions from the research will determine the timing of a potential RFP process/implementation of the stated treasury management initiatives. The exact structure and timeline regarding the operations beyond the 8-week period are to be determined, and we will keep the DAO posted regarding updates around this process.",

      "title": "DeFi Education Fund Temp Check",
      "content": "**Overview**\n\nSince its founding via a timely Uniswap Governance governance proposal in 2021, the [DeFi Education Fund ](https://www.defieducationfund.org/) (DEF) has fought to advance and protect the potential of DeFi in the public policy sphere. The threat that misguided policies and overreaching regulators pose to DeFi has never been clearer. This proposal is to provide DEF with one million UNI tokens in two tranches to support them in fulfilling their mission.\n\nDeFi promises to revolutionize how people engage in economic activities. In particular, the openly accessible and decentralized characteristics of DeFi protocols means that anyone with an internet connection and a wallet can participate in the global economy in a way that would not be possible without DeFi. To do so, DeFi upends the structure of traditional financial services and related policy making approaches. That upending has brought with it intense interest, suspicion, and hostility from entrenched interests and regulatory bodies around the world.\n\nDEF has defended DeFi from legislative threats that would require DeFi developers to implement protocol access restrictions or requirements designed for CeFi businesses; regulatory proposals that would mandate centralization if finalized; and in the courts against overzealous regulators. In late March, we sued the SEC over its policy on airdrops and its campaign of regulation by enforcement that is crippling DeFi and crypto development and participation in the United States.\n\nOver the last few years, DeFi’s policy challenges have become more real, more imminent, and more numerous. For example, in the U.S. alone, there are at least half a dozen bills actively under consideration in Congress and two rulemakings pending finalization that would effectively prohibit DeFi development. Luckily, public policy education and advocacy has borne—and can continue to bear—fruit for DeFi.\n\nWithout doubt, building a public policy environment welcoming of DeFi and decentralized governance will be a long and arduous struggle, but we know that Uniswap Governance shares our commitment to winning that debate—and it is winnable—so that the benefits of DeFi can be felt and enjoyed by as many people as possible, as quickly as possible.\n\nDEF is eager to continue leading the fight on behalf of DeFi. With additional resources, we can build out our team:\n\n1. super charge our impact litigation efforts to reshape the legal landscape to DeFi and DAOs’ benefit;\n2. expand our outreach to legislators and double down on our educational efforts;\n3. more vigorously challenge the regulatory onslaught targeting DeFi; and\n4. enhance our ability to engage in state-level debates and jurisdictions outside of the United States.\n\nIf DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from the myriad policy risks it faces while proactively laying the foundation for longterm policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. We stand ready and able to do so with the community’s backing and appreciate your consideration.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nDeFi’s policy challenges are immense and interest in DeFi has only grown since the DEF got to work in 2021. Following the collapse of FTX and with the return of the bull market, there is acute interest in DeFi on Capitol Hill and state legislatures, as well as inside federal and state government agencies. Providing meaningful educational outreach about DAOs and DeFi to lawmakers while also assisting in the legal defense of decentralized organizations is a role not played by anyone else in the US.\n\nAt this time, DAOs and DeFi protocols face several potentially catastrophic threats: a live IRS proposal would mandate the creation of intermediaries to conduct tax reporting (i.e., ban on disintermediated systems) and a live SEC rulemaking would define anyone loosely related to a DeFi protocol—including the underlying chain’s miners/validators—to be national securities exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange. Moreover, bills written to regulate CeFi often inadvertently capture DeFi protocols and subject them to compliance obligations designed for CeFi businesses.\n\nIf DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from these myriad policy risks while laying the foundation for longterm proactive policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. There is a reason TradFi businesses collectively spend over $1 billion per year on U.S. lobbying and policy efforts: it works, and we’re making it work for DeFi.\n\nDEF focuses specifically on fighting for policy outcomes favorable to decentralized finance developers and users on the ground in Washington, DC. A summary of our past work, which has included defending DAOs in court, as well as providing comment and consultation to regulators to avoid burdensome rules and regulations in the US and around the world, below. This proposal would expand our budget so that we can expand our legislative, regulatory, and legal advocacy and education efforts on behalf of DeFi and DAO developers and users.\n\nIf DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from policy risks while proactively laying the foundation for longterm policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. We stand ready and able to do so with the community’s backing, and we appreciate your consideration.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe DeFi Education Fund is a nonprofit organization with a demonstrated history of being in the trenches fighting for DAOs and decentralized finance. Whether looking to provide legal assistance when DAOs and their members are targeted, providing educational resources, or fighting for policy changes, the DeFi Education Fund is the only major crypto advocate that focuses solely on decentralized web3.\n\n**FAQs**\n\n*Why are you raising money now if you have about two years of runway at your current burn?*\n\nWe are seeking Uniswap Governance’s further support now for three primary reasons.\n\nFirst, we need a good sense of our longer term funding in order to expand our efforts and take on the long term projects that our work often requires, which can play out over several years. For example, our legal challenge of the patent covering oracle tech that is being used against DAOs will likely take a total of at least two years from start to finish. Our lawsuit against the SEC will probably last several years. If we did not have a good expectation of being able to operate two years after starting those efforts, we would not have been able to take them on at all. In addition, because we hold tokens long term, we are exposed to crypto market price fluctuations.\n\nSecond, unexpected, ad hoc projects that we are well-positioned to take on in defense of DeFi can be extremely expensive. For example, we expect the challenge to the oracle patent to cost nearly $500,000 over its entire course. A legal challenge to proposed rules that would de facto ban DeFi in the United States would cost well over $1m. We have no ability to predict with certainty when and if those expenditures will be necessary, and without a sense of our longer term funding situation, we can’t take on those types of unexpected, but critical, projects while also expanding our day to day efforts and team.\n\nDeFi needs more dedicated advocates working on its behalf. With a larger budget, we can hire more people.\n\n*When and how would you plan on selling this proposal’s tokens?*\n\nIt is important to us that DEF remains aligned with the DeFi community and our supporters over the long term. Upon passage, 500k $UNI tokens would be transferred to DEF’s on-chain Coinbase $UNI [wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb39cb7Eb25CE07470Fb59F7548979Fae0Bb85824), and 500k would be locked up in a streaming contract that would “vest” linearly over 12 months. Governance could vote to stop the streaming of the remaining tokens at any time.\n\nWe will hold half of any tokens we receive for at least 12 months from the date we receive them, and we will pre-disclose all sales plans in writing.\n\n*How are you going to keep Uniswap Governance up to date on your activities?*\n\nThe DEF team will host monthly community calls that Uniswap community members can join to hear updates on our work, learn about high priority policy and regulatory developers, and have questions answered. We’ll also keep a thread on the Uniswap governance forum up to date with our monthly updates.\n\n*What about the tokens from the 2021 proposal?*\n\nWe received our initial grant of one million $UNI tokens from the Uniswap Governance in July 2021 and sold half of the tokens shortly thereafter. In February 2024, we began selling portions of the other half of the tokens according to an 18 month written [sales plan](https://www.defieducationfund.org/post/def-provides-update-on-our-funding). We will sell in July 2025 the last of the UNI tokens we received in July 2021.\n\n*Why are you asking us for money and not other DAOs?*\n\nWe are, and we will definitely continue to “pass around the hat”! We seek Uni governance’s continued support as a community that is building for the long term. Uniswap Governance took a massive “leap of faith” in generously funding an organization that did not yet exist to do work that would benefit every DeFi project and DAO. We hope that our track record of work has proven valuable to DeFi projects and users such that Uni governance and other projects’ governance will continue to contribute to our work going forward.\n[/quote]",

      "title": "Update Uni v3/v2 Deployment Process (March 2024)",
      "content": "**Authors: Uniswap Accountability Committee**\n\n## TLDR:\n\n* Today, Uniswap governance, via the timelock address, has the ability to declare a new v3/v2 deployment as official/canonical\n* The DAO has set a precedent for approving EVM-based deployments over the past 2 years\n* This proposal seeks to give the Uniswap Accountability Committee multisig agency over altering the v3-deployments.uniswap.eth & v2deployments.uniswap.eth subdomains\n* This will allow the Committee to edit these text records whenever a new v3/v2 deployment is complete without having to go through an onchain vote\n* To accommodate for this change, we are also proposing an alteration to the current deployment governance process (see “New Proposed Deployment Process” below) to increase efficiency\n* The DAO will retain the right to assign incentive distributions from the treasury to these deployments via an onchain vote\n* The DAO will maintain ownership of the primary domain, uniswap.eth, and thus have the ability to revoke the Committee's subdomain permissions through a governance vote–this assures proper checks and balances\n\n## Background:\n\nOver the past two years, the DAO has approved numerous EVM-based deployments for Uniswap v3. There has only been one instance of a deployment proposal that did not pass the off-chain stage due to not meeting quorum: [Fantom](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0x98e08d94e1174b0bfa2350c616d3cf2fb8f5e56c56c03dc0ae58fd29a6b29265). We believe that this sets a precedent for optimistically acknowledging incoming EVM-based deployments as canonical. The same precedent can be set for v2 since there was a recent proposal to [deploy v2 across all target chains with v3](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/58) in one fell swoop.\n\nThe v3-deployments.uniswap.eth & v2deployments.uniswap.eth ENS subdomains act simply as records of the v3/v2 deployments that the DAO has “blessed”. From a legal as well as technical perspective, alterations to the subdomain don’t hold any weight–it’s merely a place onchain that the DAO can recognize v3/v2 deployments across various EVM chains. This way, there’s a public place to keep track of which deployments are official. Such recognition is important because it allows users and developers to ensure that the contracts they’re interacting with are representative of the real Uniswap (i.e. the Uniswap fork that has been approved by the DAO), thereby ensuring security and consistency across each fork.\n\nWhen the DAO currently approves deployments onchain, only the v3-deployments.uniswap.eth & v2deployments.uniswap.eth text records are being altered. The actual contract deployment is completed by a third party, like [@GFXlabs](https://gov.uniswap.org/u/gfxlabs). In fact, the deployment has to be completed prior to the onchain vote since the text record alterations requires the\n\n* The destination chain’s network number\n* Bridge sender contract address on mainnet associated with the deployment\n* UniswapV3Factory/UniswapV2Factory address on the destination chain\n\n### Current Deployment Process:\n\n* If a chain wants to deploy Uniswap, they typically connect with either the Foundation, the Accountability Committee, a delegate, or any adjacent party\n* Anyone is able to author an RFC, whether it be a delegate, the destination chain themselves, or whoever else. That RFC is posted on the forum for a minimum of seven days to allow a discussion to transpire\n* A temperature check takes place, allowing the DAO to either approve or deny the deployment of Uni v3/v2 on the given chain\n* Once passed, the v3/v2 contracts are deployed on the destination chain–the deployer collaborates with an approved bridge provider if the EVM chain is not an L2 (i.e. doesn’t already have a canonical bridge)\n* The onchain vote takes place, recognizing the deployed contracts as official on the subdomain\n\n## Our Proposal\n\n**We are proposing to enable the Uniswap Accountability Committee multisig to alter the subdomains as soon as a deployment’s RFC passes the 7-day discussion period–given there are no major points of contention during the RFC phase.** The RFC should give ample time to the DAO to make a decision regarding the deployment without having to partake in a 4+ week governance ordeal. And to make sure voters have a say in this process, we are including a 5-day challenge period that will be a part of the onboarding package temperature check–this will allow voters to voice their dissenting opinion regarding a deployment.\n\nCurrently, the Uniswap DAO, more specifically the timelock address (0x1a9C8182C09F50C8318d769245beA52c32BE35BC) owns AND manages both subdomains. This proposal would make the Accountability Committee the manager of the subdomains. If at any time the DAO would like to alter the manager again or regain control, this can be done via an onchain vote since the timelock still owns the subdomains.\n\n### New Proposed Deployment Process:\n\n**Step 1**\n\n* If a chain wants to deploy Uniswap, they typically connect with either the Foundation, the Accountability Committee, a delegate, or any adjacent party\n* Anyone is able to author an RFC, whether it be a delegate, the destination chain themselves, or whoever else. That RFC is posted on the forum for a minimum of seven days to allow a discussion to transpire\n* The deployer can either have the contracts deployed at this point or not–if the deployment is complete, then include the contracts in the RFC\n* **If no issues arise in the RFC, then the deployment will be viewed as approved, and a 5-day challenge period will be rolled into the onboarding package snapshot vote**\n\n**Step 2 (Work for the Deployer and Accountability Committee)**\n\n* If deployment hasn’t already been completed, then it must be done after the RFC phase\n* As soon as contracts are deployed and verified, ensuring that the bytecode of the deployed contracts matches the bytecode of the mainnet contracts, the Committee will comment on the RFC confirming that the contracts have been verified&#x20;\n* The Committee will then hold a temperature check to see if there’s interest in deploying incentives on the new fork–this vote also acts as the challenge period\n* **Once the snapshot is completed, and the vote is not subject to a majority veto, the Committee has the authority to write the relevant text to the subdomain**\n* The Committee will comment on the RFC confirming that the subdomain has been properly updated\n* An onchain vote will then take place to send the selected amount of capital to the Committee multisig for distribution on the target chain\n\n## Technical Implementation:\n\nThe onchain proposal needs to include the function calls below to grant the Accountability Committee write permissions to the subdomains. The DAO will maintain ownership of the primary domain, uniswap.eth, and thus have the ability to revoke the Committee's permissions through a governance vote and establish checks and balances.\n\n**For Uniswap v3 Subdomain:**\n\nsetOwner(\n\n&#x20;   node = 0x0b9638d2c5bd4528d603562a1fa1e734fe1b88e680f448d779531e9bc2b55f12,&#x20;\n\n&#x20;   owner = 0x3B59C6d0034490093460787566dc5D6cE17F2f9C\n\n)\n\n**For Uniswap v2 Subdomain:**\n\nsetOwner(\n\n&#x20;   node = 0x30e9fa72b4d7d40be0f8809d748497121d5f38ebf8700a7d2e303074e9ccf1a5,&#x20;\n\n&#x20;   owner = 0x3B59C6d0034490093460787566dc5D6cE17F2f9C\n\n)\n\n## Next Steps:\n\n*The Accountability Committee will retroactively alter the subdomain text record for any deployments that are approved and haven't been included in the subdomains after the approval of this proposal. The Committee will also add the text for deployments that did not go through the formal governance process from the* [*Uniswap Revitalization and Growth*](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-revitalization-and-growth/22616) *proposal.*",

While we typically like to avoid bundling proposals, we consulted with the Accountability Committee (AC) and other members of the DAO prior to posting the proposal to weigh the operational headache of getting four delegates to make proposals. In the future, the organization could consider upgrading our governance contract to make it easier to run multiple governance proposals.&#x20;\n\n1. Sei’s onboarding package is $500k and includes the Merkl integration. The Sei team has committed to providing liquidity alongside Uniswap’s incentives ([more info](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0xe7274e00eb2a084cdc3b7510a8b40aa303ac2d7944e9706ad090c974c76e71bf)). The Sei has separately arranged to be integrated into Oku. Sei’s EVM launch has not yet occurred but is expected soon, and upon the AC's review, Sei will be added to the Uniswap v3 Deployments record under the new program. \n2. Manta’s onboarding package is $250k and includes the Merkl integration. Manta will match Uniswap’s $250k 1:1 with MANTA. After this proposal passes, the Manta team will work to deliver the tokens to the AC so UNI and MANTA rewards can be initiated at the same time. Manta, like Sei, separately arranged to be integrated into Oku’s frontend. This proposal also adds Manta to the Uniswap v3 Deployment record.\n3. Taiko’s onboarding package is $250k and includes Oku and Merkl integrations. In addition to the incentives, the Taiko team will commit $250k in liquidity to the wETH/USDC 0.05% pool. Taiko was previously [<u>approved</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0x178ac7eb76480798dbb656cbae4a405c3adaad48f9af4ae4c528b2cbd0f6af39) for a package in the original batch, but payment wasn’t processed in proposal 59 because their launch date was a while away. Their launch is now imminent. Taiko will be added to the Uniswap v3 Deployments record under the new program.\n4. Moonbeam’s onboarding package is $250k and includes the Merkl integration. Moonbeam was previously approved for a package in the original batch, but payment wasn’t processed in proposal 59 because talks were ongoing with their team. As part of this proposal, passing Moonbeam will add $100k of GLMR to the protocol’s incentives. After this proposal passes, their team will work to deliver the tokens to the AC so UNI and GMLR rewards can be initiated at the same time.\n   ![]()![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkOaq3WbA.png)\n\nThe above is based on a UNI price of $7.86.&#x20;",

      "title": "Update Uni v3/v2 Deployment Process (March 2024) ",
      "content": "**Authors: Uniswap Accountability Committee**\n\n## TLDR:\n\n* Today, Uniswap governance, via the timelock address, has the ability to declare a new v3/v2 deployment as official/canonical\n* The DAO has set a precedent for approving EVM-based deployments over the past 2 years\n* This proposal seeks to give the Uniswap Accountability Committee multisig agency over altering the v3-deployments.uniswap.eth & v2deployments.uniswap.eth subdomains\n* This will allow the Committee to edit these text records whenever a new v3/v2 deployment is complete without having to go through an onchain vote\n* To accommodate for this change, we are also proposing an alteration to the current deployment governance process to increase efficiency\n* The DAO will retain the right to assign incentive distributions from the treasury to these deployments via an onchain vote\n\n## Our Proposal\n\n**We are proposing to enable the Uniswap Accountability Committee multisig to alter the subdomains as soon as a deployment’s RFC passes the 7-day discussion period–given there are no major points of contention during the RFC phase.** The RFC should give ample time to the DAO to make a decision regarding the deployment without having to partake in a 4+ week governance ordeal. And to make sure voters have a say in this process, we are including a 5-day challenge period that will be a part of the onboarding package temperature check--this will allow voters to voice their dissenting opinion regarding a deployment. \n\nCurrently, the Uniswap DAO, more specifically the timelock address (0x1a9C8182C09F50C8318d769245beA52c32BE35BC) owns AND manages both subdomains. This proposal would make the Accountability Committee the manager of the subdomains. If at any time the DAO would like to alter the manager again or regain control, this can be done via an onchain vote since the timelock still owns the subdomains.\n\n### New Proposed Deployment Process:\n\n**Step 1**\n\n* If a chain wants to deploy Uniswap, they typically connect with either the Foundation, the Accountability Committee, a delegate, or any adjacent party\n* Anyone is able to author an RFC, whether it be a delegate, the destination chain themselves, or whoever else. That RFC is posted on the forum for a minimum of seven days to allow a discussion to transpire\n* The deployer can either have the contracts deployed at this point or not–if the deployment is complete, then include the contracts in the RFC\n* **If no issues arise in the RFC, then the deployment will be viewed as approved, and a 5-day challenge period will be rolled into the onboarding package snapshot vote**\n\n**Step 2.1 (Work for the Deployer and Accountability Committee)**\n\n* If deployment hasn’t already been completed, then it must be done after the RFC phase\n* As soon as contracts are deployed and verified, ensuring that the bytecode of the deployed contracts matches the bytecode of the mainnet contracts, **the Accountability Committee has the authority to write the relevant text to the subdomain**\n* The Committee will comment on the RFC confirming that the contracts have been verified and that the subdomain has been properly updated\n\n**Step 2.2 (Work for the DAO and Accountability Committee)**\n\n* The Committee will hold a temperature check to see if there’s interest in deploying incentives on the new fork--this vote also acts as the challenge period\n* If passed, an onchain vote will take place, sending the selected amount of capital to the Committee multisig for distribution\n\n***Both Step 2.1 & 2.2 can take place concurrently*\n\n## Technical Implementation:\n\nThe onchain proposal needs to include the function calls below to grant the Accountability Committee write permissions to the subdomains. The DAO will maintain ownership of the primary domain, uniswap.eth, and thus have the ability to revoke permission through a governance vote.\n\n**For Uniswap v3 Subdomain:**\n```solidity\nsetOwner(\n    node = 0x0b9638d2c5bd4528d603562a1fa1e734fe1b88e680f448d779531e9bc2b55f12, \n    owner = 0x3B59C6d0034490093460787566dc5D6cE17F2f9C\n)\n\n```\n**For Uniswap v2 Subdomain:** \n```solidity\nsetOwner(\n    node = 0x30e9fa72b4d7d40be0f8809d748497121d5f38ebf8700a7d2e303074e9ccf1a5, \n    owner = 0x3B59C6d0034490093460787566dc5D6cE17F2f9C\n)\n```",

      "title": "[Temp Check] Onboard Uniswap to Sei",
      "content": "## TLDR:\n\nThe [proposal to deploy Uniswap on Sei](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-on-sei/23471) has completed the 7-day RFC phase. This deployment has therefore been optimistically approved by the Uni DAO. We will now turn to a temperature check to vote on whether or not the DAO would like to employ the Uniswap Onboarding Package to help incentivize Uniswap pools on Sei. This vote also includes a veto option, allowing any delegates who hold a dissenting opinion to veto this deployment altogether.\n\n## Onboarding Package:\n\nThe purpose of the Uniswap Onboarding Package is to allow new deployments of Uniswap v3 to get set up with three months’ worth of liquidity incentives, a frontend, and an incentive distribution tool like Merkl. These resources will help position Uniswap to have a formidable presence on new EVM chains.\n\n### Criteria for Package Adoption:\n\nThis off-chain vote will be used to determine how much in incentives–if any–the DAO would like to allocate to this deployment. The options are as follows:\n\n* Incentivize $250k\n* Incentivize $500k\n* Incentivize $750k\n* Incentivize $1M\n* Deploy without incentives\n* Veto this deployment altogether\n\nThis temp check will be considered met as long as the total number of votes cast for the funding options is over >10M. If there isn't a clear winner for which level of incentives the chain should receive, a discussion can be had before the onchain proposal. All incentives will be distributed to LPs in terms of $UNI on the target chain.\n\n## Further Details:\n\n* Incentivized pools will primarily be blue chips (ETH-USDC, ETH/WBTC, USDC-USDT)–and any local pools if applicable. The onchain vote will include the final details for pool info.\n* The Accountability Committee will escrow the inflight incentives.\n* Sei Foundation is paying for the Oku Trade integration–the DAO will not be using the funds from this vote for front-end integration and maintenance. \n* Angle Merkl will be paid for incentive distribution. The fixed integration cost going to Merkl for this deployment is €20k.\n* Angle Merkl charges 3% on incentives distributed with their system. They have offered a 25% discount on their base 3% fee for incentives distributed between $2.5m-$5m, a 50% discount on incentives distributed between $5m-$10m, and a 75% discount on all incentives above $10m in a 365-day period. The Accountability Committee will be responsible for ensuring that the DAO attains properly discounted rates.\n  * *Example scenario: if $500k of incentives are voted in, and the Merkl take rate is 3%, then the grand total that’ll be requested from the DAO during the onchain vote will be $500k + $15k + €20k = ~$536,664*\n\n## Sei’s Liquidity Bootstrapping Commitment:\n\nSei Foundation will commit up to $1M worth of liquidity to Uniswap pools on Sei. The tokens will be deployed on Uniswap through the Sei integration with Oku. A tranched approach will be used to bootstrap the liquidity. Each quarter, between Q2 2024 - end of Q4 2024, the Sei team and the Uniswap Accountability Committee will evaluate the TVL, volume, and activity of the Uniswap pools on Sei.\n\n* Q2 2024: $400k guaranteed commitment\n  * $200k in SEI/USDC\n  * $100k in SEI/wETH\n  * $100k in SEI/USDT\n* Q3 2024: $300k tentative commitment\n* Q4 2024: $300k tentative commitment\n  * Q3 and Q4 liquidity deployments will be based on Uniswap’s volume/active users from the previous quarter and the TVL at the start of the given quarter. Lower traction will lead to lowered future commitments from Sei Foundation.\n\nOnce live, active pools, TVL, volume, and fee metrics will be available on Oku’s analytics page. The Accountability Committee will be responsible for ensuring that these above promises are kept.",

      "title": "[Temp Check] Mobilizing the Uniswap Treasury",
      "content": "Title: Mobilizing the Uniswap Treasury\n\nAuthors: @AbdullahUmar & @Doo\nSummary:\nThe Uniswap DAO's treasury, containing assets worth nearly ~$6B, predominantly in $UNI tokens, faces challenges due to its single-asset composition and the lack of a plan for productive utilization. To address the treasury's volatility and underutilization, we propose forming the Uniswap Treasury Working Group (UTWG) to explore treasury management strategies aimed at achieving sustainability and growth for the DAO. This involves diversifying assets to stabilize the treasury and finding revenue-generating investments beyond the protocol's core operations. The UTWG will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO based on 8 weeks of research and interviews with various entities and individuals familiar with treasury management and adjacent subject matters. A deliverable will correspondingly be released on the forum where we present at least two viable treasury management options for the DAO to begin pursuing. Both of these options will be presented as their individual RFC/RFP, ideally allowing various treasury managers to present their products and services to the DAO. The UTWG will help facilitate this process. \n\nThe proposal's ultimate goal is to ensure the DAO's long-term financial health and support the sustenance of Uniswap. However, there is one caveat–before implementing any of the proposed strategies, in other words, before moving any $UNI to and from the treasury, we must have clarity around the legal implications of administering this program. There has to be a way to pay taxes. We hope that a simultaneous discussion around, say, DUNA, or other legal frameworks, takes place. It seems unlikely that the DAO will be able to conduct treasury management if it doesn’t open itself up to adopting a legal architecture. Our hope is that while the Foundation and potentially another working group sort out the legal side, we are able to make some strides on treasury management research. Upon adoption of a legal entity, we can then hit the ground running by actually implementing the conclusions derived from the UTWG’s research. \n\nWorking Group Details\nBased on the above reasoning, the UTWG will conduct 8 weeks worth of research into the types of treasury management initiatives that the DAO may reasonably pursue in the short-to-medium term. The group will note on the experience of treasury management practices of other DAOs, adopting practices that have historically worked well and conforming them to Uniswap’s current situation, along with the presentation of new models that we believe are potentially more effective. Considering treasury management has been a key aspect of many prominent DAOs like Maker and Aave to Lido and Gnosis, we believe that there are many case studies and frameworks that can be explored to ensure initial experiments will return positive results. \n\nThe UTWG will also try to collaborate with those working on various legal developments including the recent Wyoming Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (DUNA) Act. This process may fall outside of the jurisdiction of the treasury committee and may require outsourcing entirely to another party. It’s vital that this treasury research is analyzed in the context of potential legal structures, and we won’t move forward with implementing our research unless there are proper legal frameworks in place. The Uniswap DAO has yet to formalize its opinions on how to set up legal entities, so this caveat may delay the implementation of the proposed treasury initiatives. The UTWG’s research may conclude that a legal working group should work in concert with the treasury group to effectively bring this program to fruition. \n\nIt’s also important to emphasize that the deliverables of the UTWG will aim to highlight potential treasury management options rather than pinpointing specific service providers. If the committee comes to the conclusion that an RFP process is the ideal manner by which treasury managers should be appointed, for example, then one of the UTWG deliverables will be a call to action for various service providers. After ample discussion in the forum, the most promising service providers will qualify for a vote of confidence from the DAO. The elected members will then collaborate with the UTWG to implement a proposed treasury management initiative–granted a legal framework is in place. At this point, the working group will act as the liaison between the DAO and the service providers, ensuring proper accountability and transparency for the sake of the DAO.\n\nNote that it’s too early in the research process to conclude the exact operations of the treasury initiatives–the above paragraph simply outlines a potential order of operations, which is subject to change based on our research. Our goal is to simply present the DAO with an assortment of options, backed by interviews and research.\n\nThe Uniswap Treasury Working Group Members\n\nThe UTWG will be composed of four members. 2/4 members are listed below and are a part of working group zero (WG0). They will be helping administer and organize this proposal. The other two members will be elected via a Snapshot vote. Elected members, along with WG0, will be responsible for helping conduct research and aiding in proposing the final deliverables to the DAO. \n\nStableLab\nStableLab is a governance firm focused on professional delegation, DAO framework design, and product development. StableLab works with various projects, from the ones just starting their journey to decentralization to the most prominent DeFi protocols.\n\nArana Digital\nAD is a professional governance group. The team is deeply steeped in the crypto space and has multiple years of participation in protocol governance. With delegation history for DEXs, money markets, L2s, liquid staking protocols, and stablecoins. AD brings a diversity of experience to DAOs–its members have consulted for companies like Immutable and dYdX, worked at crypto investment and trading firms, set up various validator nodes, and run educational events for university students. \n\nBudget \nThe UTWG asks for a budget of 6,000 $UNI. The hourly rate will be the same as the Accountability Committee at $200 per hour. If this committee is formed, then the UTWG will form a 3/4 multisig to conduct payroll. Retroactive compensation will be distributed to WG0 based on their input hours by the start of the program (i.e. once the onchain vote passes). \nTentative Next Steps\nMarch 19 - March 26: RFC\n\nMarch 26 - March 30: A temperature check will go live to gauge the interest to launch the The Uniswap Treasury Working Group.\n\nMarch 30 - April 6: If temp check to form UTWG passes, a 7-day period will take place for prospective candidates to apply to the working group on the forum\n\nApril 7 - April 11: A Snapshot election will take place, allowing the DAO to vote for the two remaining members of the UTWG out of the given applicant pool\n\nApril 12 - April 19: the onchain vote will be live, batching together the formation of the working group, its four members, and sending the budget to a multisig\n\nIf the onchain vote passes, then over the course of 8 weeks, the UTWG will examine various treasury initiatives for the Uniswap DAO and create at least two viable treasury management options, which will be put into their separate RFC/RFP processes.\n\nThe exact implementation of this program after step 6 is to be determined based on the working group’s research and adjacent legal developments.\n\n*NOTE: steps 7-11 are subject to change based on legal developments–the goal of this group is to set up a formal process and provide the DAO with research on treasury management",

This will prevent the DAO from being pigeonholed by a singular, immutable implementation, thereby enabling further experimentation and allowing the DAO to effectively respond to issues with the current setup.\n\n[Full forum thread](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-v3-fees-factory-owner-amendment/23187/1)\n\nTo not significantly slow down the current process proposed by the Foundation, this Snapshot poll will be used to collect opinions via a vote from the delegates. There will be two options, “Accept amendment” or “Reject amendment.” If the “Accept amendment” is able to demonstrate a significant majority, then we would expect the onchain proposal put forth by the Foundation to include the change.

      "title": "Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Proposal",
      "content": "[Forum thread](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-revitalization-and-growth/22616?u=gfxlabs)\n[Temperature checks](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-revitalization-and-growth/22616/41?u=gfxlabs)\n[Post-Temp check post](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-revitalization-and-growth/22616/48?u=gfxlabs)\n\n## TLDR\n\nUniswap v3 utilized its first mover advantage and achieved dominance on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon, but on more recent EVM chains has seen limited market share growth.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to take Uniswap on the offensive by actively supporting and incentivizing new deployments of Uniswap v3. If successful, we will be able to grow Uniswap's market share and increase the amount of volume growing through protocol-owned deployments rather than leaving the opportunity for more Uni V3 forks to grab market share.\n\nTo put Uniswap back in the driver's seat, this proposal creates an **Onboarding Package** that the DAO can proactively deploy to new EVMs and invite EVMs to seek out official Uniswap v3 deployments.\n\n## How can we increase Uniswap’s market share?\n\n* By supporting the latest emerging EVM chains and securing Uniswap a dominant position early\n  * For example, Monad, Linea, Scroll, Polygon zkEVM, Bera, Taiko, etc\n* By further investing in current deployments where Uniswap is not a dominant player\n  * For example, Binance Smart Chain, zkSync, Base, etc\n\nSince Uniswap v3 launched, little has been done to drive the growth of any Uniswap v3 deployments outside of Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum. Of which, each strongly benefited from early mover advantages. Today, there are 13 deployments of Uniswap v3. Many of the new deployments are newer chains that, while today, don’t have the usage seen on Arbitrum, Polygon, or Optimism, one or multiple of them will likely grow to be as big or bigger.\n\nOn each of these deployments, Uniswap is currently the underdog. We’re competing against Uniswap v3 & v2 forks and other concentrated liquidity protocols, which often have more focused resources for marketing and distribution than Uniswap and often boast close relationships with the chain’s team.\n\nThe good news is these chains are still generally nascent. So, if Uniswap acts quickly, it can take the lead spot and likely hold it thanks to its robust ecosystem of tooling and support.\n\n## Introducing the Onboarding Package\n\nIt is high time we made getting Uniswap v3 on new EVMs easy. The package covers everything from deployment of contracts, data infrastructure, user interface, liquidity incentives, and tooling to distribute the incentives. With this package, the Uniswap DAO can go live on new EVM chains significantly faster.\n\nGFX Labs will handle the deployment of Uniswap v3 core and peripheral contracts, verifying the contracts, making data available to other ecosystem projects and players via the [Oku API](http://oku.trade/api), and integrating the deployment into the Oku [trade](http://oku.trade/app) and [analytics](http://oku.trade/info) interface. [Angle Merkl](https://merkl.angle.money/) will handle the distribution of UNI rewards.\n\nLastly, the Uniswap Accountability Committee will escrow the funds in their multisig for the packages.\n\n### Liquidity Incentives\n\nLiquidity incentives will range between $250k and $1m and be voted in on a Temperature Check. Incentives will be distributed in UNI over three months. Once the three months are completed, delegates should look at the remaining liquidity and Uniswap's market share position to gauge the program's success. Overall, the program is meant get Uniswap's foot in the door and secure a stronger brand position on the chain.\n\nThe package will target 3-5 pools. Generally, mainstays like ETH/USDC, ETH/BTC, USDC/USDT, and one or two key local pairs. For example, MATIC/ETH on Polygon.\n\n### Pricing\n\n* For Oku to support a new chain, it’s $45k for the initial integration and $5k/month for 12 months. This covers deploying the contracts, getting the new chain onto the frontend, the Oku API (free), our onchain limit order functionality, our cloud costs for hosting the API, our global system for quoting, node requests, and DevOps maintenance.\n  * Oku currently supports 11 chains. Any of the current chains or chains that we're already in the process of adding to the frontend do not necessitate an additional cost. Oku only charges for new deployments requested by the DAO.\n* Angle Merkl has a one-time setup fee of €20k for going to a chain that they do not support. For chains they do support, but don't have Uniswap configured for the have a one-time setup fee of €10k. [Supported chains](https://docs.angle.money/merkl/supported-chains-amms)\n  * Merkl charges 3% on funds distributed using their tool. They have offered a 25% discount on their base 3% fee for incentives distributed between $2.5m-$5m, a 50% discount on incentives distributed between $5m-$10m, and a 75% discount on all incentives above $10m in a 365-day period.\n\n## First round of Onboarding Packages\n\nThe initial Temperature Checks ended two weeks ago. For links to them, go [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-revitalization-and-growth/22616/41?u=gfxlabs). For the Post-Temp check summary, go [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-revitalization-and-growth/22616/48?u=gfxlabs).\n\nThis onchain proposal funds the following Onboarding Packages. For pool and allocation info click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x1qve0heTIS_tp8bGbRV1ZK58D64-zSddpztM3KRDtQ/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n1. Linea: $250k (w/Oku + Merkl)\n2. Scroll: $250k (w/Merkl)\n3. Polygon zkEVM: $250k (w/Merkl - UniV3 only)\n4. zkSync: $500k (w/Merkl)\n5. Blast: $500k (w/Oku + Merkl)\n6. Base: $500k (w/Merkl)\n7. BSC: $1m (w/Merkl)\n8. Mantle: $250k (w/Oku + Merkl)\n\nBased on a UNI price of $7.42 and a EUR/USD price of $1.08, the image below shows the investment the DAO will make by approving this proposal.\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJ7831nsp.png)\n\nThe Uniswap Accountability Committee Multisg will receive the UNI, and Oku/GFX and the Angle team will work closely with them to get the infrastructure setup and incentives rolling on each of these chains.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf this proposal is approved, when a new chain wants a deployment, we can offer this package and roll it out as part of the governance proposal. This would end the current status of rubber-stamping deployment proposals and provide a reason for new chains to seek the support of Uniswap governance proactively.\n\nUniswap could quickly take the lead on 5-10 chains through this initiative. If one of these chains grows into a major player (like Arb/Op/Poly), it will have paid for the entire program multiple times over (assuming the fee switch is someday turned).\n\nProviding a modest onboarding package helps Uniswap diversify and develop new markets without waiting to see which chains become long-term relevant - at which point it is often too late or too costly to get market share.",

      "title": "Deploy Uniswap V2 on all chains with V3",
      "content": "## TL;DR\n\n* The only canonical deployment of Uniswap V2 is on Ethereum mainnet.\n* There is demand for V2-style AMMs on non-Ethereum chains and many V2 forks have been deployed with varying degrees of modification.\n* To the extent that these forks have been modified, they may prove unsafe for users.\n* To the extent that these forks have liquidity, that liquidity could likely have accrued to Uniswap V2.\n* The combination of Uniswap V2 and Uniswap V3 can often provide better execution for small-volume swappers via the Universal Router.\n\n## Introduction\n\nWhen Uniswap V3’s [Business Source License](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/LICENSE) expired and the code’s license transitioned to [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html), the DAO [created a process](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-post-bsl-cross-chain-deployment-process-creation-of-new-uniswap-eth-subdomain/20961) by which it would declare canonical deployments of the contracts. This process serves to identify instances of the V3 code that are a) not modified and b) owned and controlled by the Uniswap governance contracts. These assurances are meant to provide developers and users with comfort that the code they’re using is safe and any changes to it (to the extent that changes are even possible) will be telegraphed long in advance.\n\nUniswap V2 is governed by the same permissive GPL license but has not been subject to the same DAO-run multi-chain expansion as V3. Instead, it has been forked and deployed under different brand names and across many chains almost continuously since Sushi’s vampire attack in the summer of 2020. These forks may contain modifications to the code, and their ownership structure can range from DAO governance contracts to single-signature wallets. Nevertheless, forks of V2 can garner [significant liquidity and volume](https://defillama.com/protocols/dexes/Base) relative to other AMMs.\n\n## Proposal\n\nDeploy Uniswap V2 on all chains where there is a canonical instance of V3.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThere are at least three compelling arguments to move forward with this proposal.\n\nFirst, V2 forks have been plagued by hacks that have caused the loss of user funds. The Uniswap V2 contracts have been deployed on mainnet since [May 4, 2020](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc31d7e7e85cab1d38ce1b8ac17e821ccd47dbde00f9d57f2bd8613bff9428396) with no loss of user funds; they can be considered among the most battle-hardened contracts on Ethereum. Canonical versions of the Uniswap contracts can provide DEX users on new chains - swappers, liquidity providers, and developers - with the safety and security for which the protocol is known.\n\nSecond, there is demand for traditional, full-range AMMs on new chains. Uniswap should be in a place to service this demand and continue to grow our user base and brand equity across multiple ecosystems.\n\nThird, integrating Uniswap V2 pools into the Universal Router will help incrementally improve execution quality for applications that already use the Router to allow their users to swap.\n\n## Process\n\nThis process will be very similar to the first vote to [declare V3 canonical implementations](https://vote.uniswapfoundation.org/proposals/38). We will evaluate a batch of deployments, create a new ENS name, and populate the text record for each of those deployments. More specifically:\n\n* Chains that have a V3 deployment have already gone through the community vetting process and should be eligible for a V2 deployment by default.\n* V2 deployments should be owned by the same contract that owns the V3 deployment on its respective chain and subject to the same cross-chain governance mechanism\n* V2 deployments should be cataloged in the text records of a new ENS subdomain v2deployments.uniswap.eth with the key equal to the network ID and the value equal to the bridge sender contract address and the destination chain’s UniswapV2Factory contract address\n\nThe relevant contract addresses can be found in [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I2viBd0SbYs8M83bC3HKvYh_zh8i2_CjMMbMfP9bPSk/edit#gid=0) or on the Forum in [this post](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-deploy-uniswap-v2-on-all-chains-with-v3/21799/12).&#x20;\n\n## Vote Transaction Details\n\nIf executed, this proposal will execute two function calls.\n\n1. Create the `v2deployments.uniswap.eth` subdomain by calling the `setSubnodeRecord` function on the ENS Registry [contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e) and passing it the hashed values of the main name (uniswap.eth) and the new subname (v2deployments) as well as the timelock's address and the resolver we're using (the ENS public resolver [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4976fb03C32e5B8cfe2b6cCB31c09Ba78EBaBa41)).&#x20;\n2. Add the text records to the newly-created `v2deployments.uniswap.eth` by calling the `multicall` function on the ENS registry (since we have > 9 records to create and our governor contract can call max 10 functions per proposal). We pass `multicall` an array of the encoded bytes data for each function we want to call. Concretely, `multicall` receives an array of 14 items, each of which is the encoded bytes data for the function call that sets a text record in the format described above.\n\nThe code used to generate these function arguments (show below) can be found [here](https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/governance-seatbelt/blob/main/sims/v2-subdomain.sim.ts).\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/d7c7f9aa-ba63-4b72-a1bc-73d83a64e795_original.png)",

      "title": "Deploy Uniswap V3 on Zora",
      "content": "# Proposal Motivation\n\nWe at she256 are submitting this proposal on behalf of Zora Labs. Zora Network is an emergent ETH L2 built with the OP stack that has grown to more than [90k weekly active users](https://dune.com/queries/3102622/5177887) who drive [600k transactions every week](https://dune.com/jhackworth/zora-network). We propose a canonical deployment of Uniswap v3 on Zora benefitting creators, collectors, and builders of both ecosystems.\n\nZora Network is onboarding thousands of creators and collectors to Ethereum L2s through a distinctly creative brand and support from protocols like Mint.Fun, Holograph, PartyDAO, and the Zora Creator Toolkit. It is important for Zora Network’s ecosystem of creators, collectors, and developers to have access to premier crypto tooling, including DeFi protocols, that can help them protect and expand the value they are creating onchain.\n\nWe believe offering these tools is a material step in supporting creators as they explore and innovate with onchain media. This is particularly true as the amount of people and teams that earn ETH on Zora Network continues to grow from features like Zora’s Protocol Rewards.\n\nThis collaboration will position Uniswap to win long term market share on an emergent L2 network with a uniquely differentiated user base. And, it will signal the DAO’s ongoing support of the growing population of creators, collectors, and builders that transact on Zora Network everyday.\n\n## List of actors\n\n* Proposer [Zora Labs](https://zora.co) – [Twitter](http://@ourzora), [Website](http://zora.co), [About](http://zora.co/about), [Network Details and Docs](https://docs.zora.co/docs/zora-network/network)\n* Deployer: [Zora Labs](https://twitter.com/ZORAEngineering)\n* Bridge Provider: Bedrock (Optimism native bridge)\n* Proposal Sponsor: [she256](https://she256.org/)\n\n# Background\n\nZora Network is an L2 built on top of Ethereum using the OP stack [with over half a million addresses onchain](https://dune.com/sealaunch/zora-network) and just under 1000 ETH in transaction fees. Zora Network launched last summer on June 21st, the Summer Solstice. It is currently supported by industry leading infrastructure partners such as Rainbow, Opensea, Zerion, Dune, Layer Zero and many more. Zora Network supports a bustling ecosystem of creators, collectors and developers that are exploring creativity onchain.\n\n## Creator and Collector Ecosystem\n\nZora Network brings a uniquely creative and NFT native audience to the Uniswap ecosystem. Many of the active users on Zora Network are the artists, collectors, and builders that makeup the onchain creative community. Zora Network makes up [30-34% of mint marketshare ](https://dune.com/queries/3216404/5377012)across Ethereum and its L2s ecosystem. In the last month, there were more than 40,000 NFT contracts created on Zora Network, and today [36% of all unique collectors ](https://dune.com/jhackworth/zora-network)across Ethereum and its L2 ecosystem are active on Zora Network.\n\nAdoption of Zora Network comes alongside easy to use product features in the Zora Creator Toolkit like email signup and free creation, which position Zora to easily onboard first time users to crypto. As these users grow in their understanding of crypto, it’s important that Zora Network has brand aligned partners, like Uniswap, available to facilitate our users’ next steps in their crypto journey.\n\n## Developer Ecosystem\n\nThe Zora Network developer ecosystem includes a lot of the core infrastructure that developer teams need to get started with a new project in crypto. There are [over 10,000 contracts deployed to Zora Network everyday](https://dune.com/queries/3102645/5177911). Examples of teams that support Zora Network today include infrastructure teams like Dune, Third Web, Tenderly, and Gelato as well key developer tools like Wagmi and Privy.\n\nNFT native protocols like those mentioned above, Mint.Fun, Holograph, and Highlight, have also integrated Zora Network alongside others like [Gallery](https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x5921a344e85553d8ec7f8510917d38aaa8d21081) and [Fair XYZ](https://fair.xyz/). One of the more exciting integrations of late has been the [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/) team’s launch of in-app minting of Zora Network NFTs powered by Warps. Lastly on the developer front — Protocol Rewards on Zora Network, specifically referral rewards, are proving to be [a new revenue stream](https://twitter.com/kylemccollom/status/1697237856962720076) for developers building aggregators, recommendation systems like [Daylight](https://www.daylight.xyz/), and mobile notification rails like [Interface](https://twitter.com/interfacedapp). Zora Network is still early, but it's proving to be valuable for developer teams of all types.\n\n# Rationale for Uniswap on Zora Network\n\n[Protocol Rewards on Zora Network](https://support.zora.co/en/articles/8192123-understanding-protocol-rewards-on-zora) makes the need for stablecoins and fiat on/off-ramps increasingly apparent. Creators, collectors, and developers in the Zora ecosystem are [earning six figures of ETH in protocol rewards everyday](https://dune.com/queries/3216223/5376687). For some creators, protocol rewards are helping to [pay their rent ](https://warpcast.com/tokenart.eth/0xfb0ded63)or just grab a slice of pizza. And for platforms, rewards are quickly becoming a core part of their business model and a key to their success.\n\nThere is a growing need on Zora Network for swaps and stablecoins that can better protect the value these individuals and teams create. Today, creators are required to bridge their ETH from Zora Network to a chain where Uniswap is supported, which costs gas and eats into their earnings. Only then will they be able to swap to a stablecoin. Adding swaps natively on Zora Network will make taking this action cheaper and easier for onchain creators that are making their living with Protocol Rewards.\n\nOur goal with this proposal is to bring a canonical instance of world class DeFi tooling to Zora Network participants to help them more efficiently convert and expand their Protocol Rewards into value that they can transact with in their everyday lives. We think this is an exciting long tail opportunity for Uniswap.\n\n### Uniswap on Zora Network enables\n\n* Stablecoins for thousands of creators, collectors, and builders on Zora Network\n* Swaps for Zora Network participants without needing to bridge funds\n* Fiat payment rails to easily on and off ramps, for our creators, collectors, and builders\n* Creating and transacting in additional token types ERC20 tokens\n* Developer teams requiring liquidity pools for markets or experimentation\n\n# Benefits to Uniswap\n\nUniswap would be the first DeFi protocol on Zora Network giving it a first mover advantage to win consideration from the network’s unique audience of creators and collectors.\n\n## Expand the Uniswap Audience\n\nRecent market data from cross-chain minting activations indicate that, when given the option and equal incentive, creators [tend to choose Zora Network](https://x.com/js_horne/status/1744719299460337785?s=20) as the destination for their work onchain. Uniswap and Zora Network coming together is a great opportunity to expand the Uniswap audience to Zora Network’s creative community.\n\nZora Network is home to tens of thousands of creators of all disciplines: visual artists, musicians, photographers, podcasters, and more. Incredible crypto native talent like Chase Chapman, Nick Hollins from UFO, and more have made Zora Network their L2 of choice. This is all happening alongside some of the world’s best YouTube channels like [Color Studios](https://colorsxstudios.com/collect) or breakout brands like [KidSuper ](https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x3a669992d78cf9fd0f23a589c152ea4d2c5e7ed0/1)making Zora their home as well.\n\nUniswap V3 on Zora Network is an opportunity for Uniswap to market to a new, non-DeFi audience that is excited to support one another’s creativity. You can get a feel for who makes up the Zora community in the latest [Me + My Imagination campaign](https://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1735359375840297265/quotes).\n\n## Increase DEX Marketshare\n\nUniswap will be the first DEX to come to market on Zora Network. It will start out with 100% marketshare on this emergent L2 network. The more than half a million addresses on Zora Network will have a single destination for DeFi.\n\nZora Network has an increasingly active user base with active addresses on Zora Network are up 50% MoM from December to January. And, that user base is earning ETH at a good rate with more than $100k of ETH paid out daily on Zora Network in Protocol Rewards. Given these earnings and these levels of activity, there is a good chance these users will need stablecoins and other opportunities to protect the value their creating.\n\n## Commemorative Mint\n\nZora will mint a commemorative artwork to celebrate the launch of Uniswap V3. Zora plans to [split the creator rewards](https://support.zora.co/en/articles/8730492-split-contracts-on-zora) from this mint 70-30, with 70% of rewards from this mint at the discretion of the Uniswap DAO and 30% going to Zora. We will add the [Protocol Guild](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) as the beneficiary split recipient on this commemorative mint for Uniswap DAO's share of the split, benefitting core protocol development as collectors mint the artwork in celebration of the launch.\n\n# Success Criteria\n\nFor Uniswap, this is a unique opportunity to become the sole DEX on Zora Network, a breakout L2 for onchain creativity. This will help Uniswap win increasing amounts of creator affinity as you support the thousands of active creators and collectors around the world using Zora Network.\n\nIn addition, we consider this successful for Uniswap if we are able to:\n\n* Launch a successful commemorative mint to excite Zora’s community about Uniswap\n* Onboard Zora’s onchain creative and developer community to Uniswap\n* Partner with Zora on future Uniswap DAO activations, hackathons, etc.\n\nWe want to give network participants the tools they need to convert the value they create on Zora Network into stablecoins and real world currencies they can use everyday. By weaving Uniswap V3 seamlessly into this emergent network, we aspire to strengthen the ties between Uniswap and Zora, ensuring a mutually beneficial collaboration between both thriving communities.\n\n## KPI Summary\n\n**Brand Marketing**\n\n* 7,777 unique collectors from Uniswap x Zora commemorative mint\n* Increase Uniswap followers on Zora by at least 10k followers\n\n**Mint Performance**\n\n* 55k mints on Uniswap x Zora commemorative mint\n\n**Uniswap Core Metrics**\n\n* 111 creators on Zora Network swapping on Uniswap\n* 11 of erc20 tokens and LP pools launched on Zora Network\n\n**Dev Education**\n\n* At least 1 Zora Network platform offers swaps on Uniswap\n\n# Deployment Details\n\nAs is the case with all canonical v3 deployments, this deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3-deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended to include the reference to the Uniswap v3 Factory contract on Zora Network.\n\nUniswap V3 contracts have been deployed on Zora at the following addresses:\n\n| Contract Name                                                                                                                              | Zora Mainnet Address                       |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |\n| [v3CoreFactory](https://explorer.zora.energy/address/0x7145F8aeef1f6510E92164038E1B6F8cB2c42Cbb?tab=contract)                              | 0x7145F8aeef1f6510E92164038E1B6F8cB2c42Cbb |\n| [multicall2](https://explorer.zora.energy/address/0xA51c76bEE6746cB487a7e9312E43e2b8f4A37C15?tab=contract)                                 | 0xA51c76bEE6746cB487a7e9312E43e2b8f4A37C15 |\n| [proxyAdmin](https://explorer.zora.energy/address/0xd4109824FC80dD41ca6ee8D304ec74B8bEdEd03b)                                              | 0xd4109824FC80dD41ca6ee8D304ec74B8bEdEd03b |\n| [tickLens](https://explorer.zora.energy/address/0x209AAda09D74Ad3B8D0E92910Eaf85D2357e3044?tab=contract)                                   | 0x209AAda09D74Ad3B8D0E92910Eaf85D2357e3044 |\n| [nftDescriptorLibraryV1\\_3\\_0](https://explorer.zora.energy/address/0xffF2BffC03474F361B7f92cCfF2fD01CFBBDCdd1?tab=contract)               | 0xffF2BffC03474F361B7f92cCfF2fD01CFBBDCdd1 |\n| [nonfungibleTokenPositionDescriptorV1\\_3\\_0](https://explorer.zora.energy/address/0xf15D9e794d39A3b4Ea9EfC2376b2Cd9562996422?tab=contract) | 0xf15D9e794d39A3b4Ea9EfC2376b2Cd9562996422 |\n| [descriptorProxy](https://explorer.zora.energy/address/0x843b0b03c3B3B0434B9cb00AD9cD1D9218E7741b)                                         | 0x843b0b03c3B3B0434B9cb00AD9cD1D9218E7741b |\n| [nonfungibleTokenPositionManager](https://explorer.zora.energy/address/0xbC91e8DfA3fF18De43853372A3d7dfe585137D78?tab=contract)            | 0xbC91e8DfA3fF18De43853372A3d7dfe585137D78 |\n| [v3Migrator](https://explorer.zora.energy/address/0x048352d8dCF13686982C799da63fA6426a9D0b60?tab=contract)                                 | 0x048352d8dCF13686982C799da63fA6426a9D0b60 |\n| [v3Staker](https://explorer.zora.energy/address/0x5eF5A6923d2f566F65f363b78EF7A88ab1E4206f?tab=contract)                                   | 0x5eF5A6923d2f566F65f363b78EF7A88ab1E4206f |\n| [quoterV2](https://explorer.zora.energy/address/0x11867e1b3348F3ce4FcC170BC5af3d23E07E64Df?tab=contract)                                   | 0x11867e1b3348F3ce4FcC170BC5af3d23E07E64Df |\n\n## Front End Considerations\n\nZora will deploy the [open source Uniswap UI](https://github.com/Uniswap/interface) to a subdomain at <https://zora.energy.> This front end will be made available to all Zora Network users similar to <https://bridge.zora.energy.> Our goal is to ensure that there is an easy to use frontend interface for users to access the superpowers of Uniswap. Overtime, we will work with the Uniswap Labs team to get Zora Network added to the primary Uniswap website over time.\n\n# Bridge Details\n\nZora Network is built on the open-source OP Stack. As a result, the bridge for Zora Network operates functionally identical to both OP Mainnet and Base – two OP Stack chains with canonical Uniswap V3 deployments already live. The bridge address is listed below, and more information on the OP Stack Bridge design is available [here](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/dapp-developers/bridging/basics). As a further convenience, Zora Network hosts a bridging interface at <https://bridge.zora.energy.>\n\n| Contract Name                                                                                        | Address of Proxy                           |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |\n| [Optimism Portal](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a0ad011913A150f69f6A19DF447A0CfD9551054)           | 0x1a0ad011913A150f69f6A19DF447A0CfD9551054 |\n| [L1 ERC721 Bridge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x83A4521A3573Ca87f3a971B169C5A0E1d34481c3)          | 0x83A4521A3573Ca87f3a971B169C5A0E1d34481c3 |\n| [L1 Standard Bridge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e2ea9b92b7e48a52296fd261dc26fd995284631)        | 0x3e2ea9b92b7e48a52296fd261dc26fd995284631 |\n| [L1 Cross Domain Messenger](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdc40a14d9abd6f410226f1e6de71ae03441ca506) | 0xdc40a14d9abd6f410226f1e6de71ae03441ca506 |\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal has passed the RFC and temperature check phases. The relevant Uniswap v3 contracts have also been deployed on Zora mainnet.

      "title": "[Temp Check] Deploy Uniswap v3 on Zora",
      "content": "*We @she256 are submitting this RFC & proposal on behalf of Zora Labs. For the full proposal/discussion, please see the linked forum post. \n\n# Proposal Motivation\nZora Network is an emergent ETH L2 built with the OP stack that has grown to more than [90k weekly active users](https://dune.com/queries/3102622/5177887) who drive [600k transactions every week](https://dune.com/jhackworth/zora-network). We propose a canonical deployment of Uniswap v3 on Zora benefitting creators, collectors, and builders of both ecosystems.\n\nZora Network is onboarding thousands of creators and collectors to Ethereum L2s through a distinctly creative brand and support from protocols like Mint.Fun, Holograph, PartyDAO, and the Zora Creator Toolkit. It is important for Zora Network’s ecosystem of creators, collectors, and developers to have access to premier crypto tooling, including DeFi protocols, that can help them protect and expand the value they are creating onchain.\n\nWe believe offering these tools is a material step in supporting creators as they explore and innovate with onchain media. This is particularly true as the amount of people and teams that earn ETH on Zora Network continues to grow from features like Zora’s Protocol Rewards.\n\nThis collaboration will position Uniswap to win long term market share on an emergent L2 network with a uniquely differentiated user base. And, it will signal the DAO’s ongoing support of the growing population of creators, collectors, and builders that transact on Zora Network everyday.\n\n# Rationale for Uniswap on Zora Network\n[Protocol Rewards on Zora Network](https://support.zora.co/en/articles/8192123-understanding-protocol-rewards-on-zora) makes the need for stablecoins and fiat on/off-ramps increasingly apparent. Creators, collectors, and developers in the Zora ecosystem are [earning six figures of ETH in protocol rewards everyday](https://dune.com/queries/3216223/5376687). For some creators, protocol rewards are helping to [pay their rent ](https://warpcast.com/tokenart.eth/0xfb0ded63)or just grab a slice of pizza. And for platforms, rewards are quickly becoming a core part of their business model and a key to their success.\n\nThere is a growing need on Zora Network for swaps and stablecoins that can better protect the value these individuals and teams create. Today, creators are required to bridge their ETH from Zora Network to a chain where Uniswap is supported, which costs gas and eats into their earnings. Only then will they be able to swap to a stablecoin. Adding swaps natively on Zora Network will make taking this action cheaper and easier for onchain creators that are making their living with Protocol Rewards.\n\nOur goal with this proposal is to bring a canonical instance of world class DeFi tooling to Zora Network participants to help them more efficiently convert and expand their Protocol Rewards into value that they can transact with in their everyday lives. We think this is an exciting long tail opportunity for Uniswap.\n\n### Uniswap on Zora Network enables\n* Stablecoins for thousands of creators, collectors, and builders on Zora Network\n* Swaps for Zora Network participants without needing to bridge funds\n* Fiat payment rails to easily on and off ramps, for our creators, collectors, and builders\n* Creating and transacting in additional token types ERC20 tokens\n* Developer teams requiring liquidity pools for markets or experimentation\n\n# Benefits to Uniswap\nUniswap would be the first DeFi protocol on Zora Network giving it a first mover advantage to win consideration from the network’s unique audience of creators and collectors. \n\n## Expand the Uniswap Audience\nRecent market data from cross-chain minting activations indicate that, when given the option and equal incentive, creators [tend to choose Zora Network](https://x.com/js_horne/status/1744719299460337785?s=20) as the destination for their work onchain. Uniswap and Zora Network coming together is a great opportunity to expand the Uniswap audience to Zora Network’s creative community.\n\nZora Network is home to tens of thousands of creators of all disciplines: visual artists, musicians, photographers, podcasters, and more. Incredible crypto native talent like Chase Chapman, Nick Hollins from UFO, and more have made Zora Network their L2 of choice. This is all happening alongside some of the world’s best YouTube channels like [Color Studios](https://colorsxstudios.com/collect) or breakout brands like [KidSuper ](https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x3a669992d78cf9fd0f23a589c152ea4d2c5e7ed0/1)making Zora their home as well.\n\nUniswap V3 on Zora Network is an opportunity for Uniswap to market to a new, non-DeFi audience that is excited to support one another’s creativity. You can get a feel for who makes up the Zora community in our latest [Me + My Imagination campaign](https://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1735359375840297265/quotes).\n\n## Potential new revenue stream for Uniswap DAO\nThe most immediate increase in DAO revenue will come from a Uniswap x Zora commemorative mint. Zora will mint a commemorative artwork to celebrate the launch of Uniswap V3. We will add the Uniswap DAO as a split recipient on this commemorative mint. This will mean that the Uniswap DAO will receive ETH income in the [form of protocol rewards](https://docs.zora.co/docs/smart-contracts/creator-tools/rewards) as collectors mint the artwork in celebration of the launch.\n\nZora plans to split the creator rewards from this mint 70-30 with 70% of rewards from this mint going to the Uniswap DAO and 30% going to Zora.\n\nCommemorative mints also help teams build onchain followings that can be reactivated on Zora and pinged via on platform notifications. For example, [LayerZero gained 74k followers ](https://zora.co/0xc96454d527192f519f2e5f1d21e295ef56df7d73)on Zora as a result of their commemorative mint for Zora Network support in September 2023. It is easy to imagine Uniswap building an onchain audience on Zora that includes millions of its users.\n\n## Increase DEX Marketshare\nUniswap will be the first DEX to come to market on Zora Network. It will start out with 100% marketshare on this emergent L2 network. The more than half a million addresses on Zora Network will have a single destination for DeFi.\n\nZora Network has an increasingly active user base with active addresses on Zora Network are up 50% MoM from December to January. And, that user base is earning ETH at a good rate with more than $100k of ETH paid out daily on Zora Network in Protocol Rewards. Given these earnings and these levels of activity, there is a good chance these users will need stablecoins and other opportunities to protect the value their creating.\n\n# Success Criteria\nFor Uniswap, this is a unique opportunity to become the sole DEX on Zora Network, a breakout L2 for onchain creativity. This will help Uniswap win increasing amounts of creator affinity as you support the thousands of active creators and collectors around the world using Zora Network.\n\nIn addition, we consider this successful for Uniswap if we are able to:\n\n* Launch a successful commemorative mint to excite Zora’s community about Uniswap\n* Onboard Zora’s onchain creative and developer community to Uniswap\n* Partner with Zora on future Uniswap DAO activations, hackathons, etc.\n\nWe want to give our network participants the tools they need to convert the value they create on Zora Network into stablecoins and real world currencies they can use everyday. By weaving Uniswap V3 seamlessly into this emergent network, we aspire to strengthen the ties between Uniswap and Zora, ensuring a mutually beneficial collaboration between our thriving communities.\n\n\n# Deployment Details\nUniswap V3 has been deployed to the Zora Sepolia Network. All contracts have been verified on the [network block explorer](https://sepolia.explorer.zora.energy). We will update the proposal with the appropriate mainnet addresses before submitting this vote onchain.\n\nAs is the case with all canonical v3 deployments, this deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3-deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended to include the reference to the Uniswap v3 Factory contract on Zora Network.\n\n\n## Front End Considerations\nZora will deploy the [open source Uniswap UI](https://github.com/Uniswap/interface) to a subdomain at https://zora.energy. This front end will be made available to all Zora Network users similar to https://bridge.zora.energy. Our goal is to ensure that there is an easy to use frontend interface for users to access the superpowers of Uniswap. Overtime, we will work with the Uniswap Labs team to get Zora Network added to the primary Uniswap website over time.\n\n# Bridge Details\nZora Network is built on the open-source OP Stack. As a result, the bridge for Zora Network operates functionally identical to both OP Mainnet and Base – two OP Stack chains with canonical Uniswap V3 deployments already live. The bridge address is listed below, and more information on the OP Stack Bridge design is available [here](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/dapp-developers/bridging/basics). As a further convenience, Zora Network hosts a bridging interface at https://bridge.zora.energy.\n\n|Contract Name|Address|\n| --- | --- |\n|Optimism Portal Proxy|0x1a0ad011913A150f69f6A19DF447A0CfD9551054|\n|Optimism Portal|0x43260ee547c3965bb2a0174763bb8FEcC650BA4A|\n|L1 ERC721 Bridge|0xDBCdA21518AF39E7feb9748F6718D3db11591461|\n|L1 ERC721 Bridge Proxy|0x83A4521A3573Ca87f3a971B169C5A0E1d34481c3|\n|L1 Standard Bridge|0xbF6acaF315477b15D638bf4d91eA48FA79b58335|\n|L1 Cross Domain Messenger|0x363B4B1ADa52E50353f746999bd9E94395190d2C|\n\n# Timeline\nThis proposal has passed the RFC phase without contention. We will follow up this snapshot Tempature Check with a formal onchain vote to grant the canonical status to Uniswap V3 on Zora Network, with the proposal updated to include the corresponding mainnet addresses.",

      "content": "This temperature check will gauge delegates' interest/support for deploying the onboarding package to Linea.\n\nI've attached the forum thread for the full context.\n\n**TLDR**: The Uniswap Onboarding Package is for new deployments of Uniswap v3 to get set up with three-month liquidity incentives, a frontend (Oku), and incentives distribution tooling (Angle Merkl). These resources will help position Uniswap to have a formidable presence on new EVM chains.\n\n**How the vote works**:\nThe temperature check will be considered met as long as the total number of votes cast for the funding options is over >10M. If there isn't a clear winner for which level of incentives the chain should receive, a discussion can be had before the onchain proposal.\n\n**Notes**:\n* Applies to recent deployments of Uniswap v3 where delegates vote for them\n* Pools will be primarily blue chips (ETH-USDC, ETH/WBTC, USDC-USDT) and a local pool if applicable. The onchain vote will include the final details for pool info.\n* The Accountability Committee will escrow the inflight incentives.\n* Oku will only be paid for new deployments, not existing ones or ones already contracted. Oku prices all standard deployments at $45k for the initial integration and $5k/month for 12 months.\n* Angle Merkl will only be paid their integration fee for new deployments. For new deployments and new chains, Merkl is €20k. For existing chains, new Uni v3 deployments are €10k.\n* Angle Merkl charges 3% on incentives distributed with their system. They have offered a 25% discount on their base 3% fee for incentives distributed between $2.5m-$5m, a 50% discount on incentives distributed between $5m-$10m, and a 75% discount on all incentives above $10m in a 365-day period.",

      "title": "Deploy Uniswap V3 on Rootstock",
      "content": "# **Proposal Motivation**\n\nWe [<u>Michigan Blockchain</u>](https://twitter.com/UMichBlockchain) are submitting this proposal to facilitate the integration of Uniswap V3 on Rootstock (RSK), the first Bitcoin sidechain. Rootstock combines the security of Bitcoin and the functionality of Ethereum. This amalgam is enabled by RSK’s implementation of a merged mining architecture and an EVM-compatible execution environment. Unlike most deployments during the bear market, RSK has doubled-down on this initiative, allocating a total of $3 million for bootstrapping liquidity across various pools.\n\nWhat’s more is that the [<u>IOV Labs</u>](https://www.iovlabs.org/) team (the research and development group behind RSK) has been closely collaborating with both [<u>GFX Labs</u>](https://twitter.com/labsGFX) and [<u>Wormhole</u>](https://wormhole.com/) to ensure that this deployment is completed seamlessly. They have taken all of the necessary technical steps to be eligible for finalizing this deployment. The relevant v3 contracts are now deployed on RSK (see “Deployment Details”), along with pools for trading RBTC (1:1 with $BTC), RIF, and wETH, all accessible using the [<u>Oku Trade front-end</u>](https://oku.trade/app/rootstock/pool/0xd2ffe51ab4e622a411abbe634832a19d919e9c55?utm_source=uniswap\\&utm_medium=forum\\&utm_campaign=rootstocktemp). This deployment has already aggregated over [<u>$1.1M of TVL</u>](https://oku.trade/info/rootstock/overview?utm_source=uniswap\\&utm_medium=forum\\&utm_campaign=rootstocktemp) and is seeing[<u> upwards of $540k in daily volume</u>](https://oku.trade/info/rootstock/overview?utm_source=uniswap\\&utm_medium=forum\\&utm_campaign=rootstocktemp) over the past two weeks. Plus, the Wormhole integration is in place to facilitate any cross-chain governance messaging. The final hurdle is to officiate this proposal through the Uniswap governance process, and recognize this as the canonical v3 deployment on RSK.\n\n\n\n### **Introducing Uniswap to the Bitcoin Space**\n\nWe’ve been in contact with IOV Labs for the past couple of months regarding this deployment. Our teams have had back and forth conversations regarding the merits and drawbacks of bringing Uniswap to a Bitcoin sidechain, which, admittedly, has limited mindshare among DeFi users across other EVM chains. Currently, there are two divergent user profiles when it comes to Bitcoin. The first is the staunch Bitcoin Maxi. This person views $BTC as the one and true cryptocurrency, with a notable preference for highly secure and isolated systems. Conversely, we have the DeFi users. Most of their activity takes place on the EVM, and their objective is financial gain using various onchain instruments–staking, liquidity provision, borrowing/lending, yield farming, perpetuals, etc. Security is important to everyone, at least idealistically speaking, but users’ actions often indicate a preference for profiteering in the face of taking a degree of risk.\n\nHowever, we think that there may be a market in between these two that Uniswap–and DeFi protocols in general–could help service. It could very well be the case that users who want to conduct DeFi transactions using $BTC will do so through dapps launched on RSK. The security guarantees using the merged-mining setup make interacting with $BTC on RSK ($RBTC) more secure than using $BTC on alternative smart contract platforms. Although it may be a reaching assumption that users will have the motivation to prioritize security to such an extent, easy access to RSK via wallets like Metamask make it frictionless for users to jump between ETH and RSK. The potential concern here, however, is liquidity fragmentation. That is, unless, a certain market of users exclusively uses RSK for all things BTC.\n\n# **Proposal Stakeholders**\n\nThe following list of stakeholders is present to transparently communicate which entities and individuals are involved in proposal creation and implementation.\n\n**Proposer:** [**<u>Michigan Blockchain</u>**](https://twitter.com/umichblockchain?lang=en)\n\n*This entity is responsible for authoring the proposal & managing the governance process*\n\n**Deployer:** [**<u>IOV Labs</u>**](https://www.iovlabs.org/) **+** [**<u>GFX Labs</u>**](https://twitter.com/labsGFX)\n\n*This entity is responsible for the technical deployment of the contracts on the target chain*\n\n* The IOV Labs team is responsible for the innovation behind Rootstock\n* GFX Labs helped deploy the v3 contracts on RSK and has a track record of safely deploying Uniswap v3 on various EVM-compatible chains\n\n**Frontend:** [**<u>Oku Trade</u>**](https://oku.trade/app/rootstock/pool/0xd2ffe51ab4e622a411abbe634832a19d919e9c55?utm_source=uniswap\\&utm_medium=forum\\&utm_campaign=rootstocktemp)\n\n*The initial frontend where users can interact with the new Uniswap v3 deployment*\n\n* Oku is built and managed by GFX Labs\n* Oku was seeded by a Uniswap Foundation grant in 2022\n* Oku supports eight chains and continues to aid Uniswap’s expansion to new protocols\n\nNote: Oku Trade has become the DAO’s go-to third party front-end for Uniswap deployments since the canonical front-end is owned and operated by Uniswap Labs\n\n**Bridge Provider:** [**<u>Wormhole</u>**](https://wormhole.com/)\n\n*This is the cross-chain messaging solution selected for this deployment*\n\n* Wormhole serves as the governance messaging provider to four Uniswap deployments: BNB, Celo, Gnosis, and Moonbeam.

Moreover, the implementation of the protocol and operational security practices are well considered.”\n\n**Target Chain:** [**<u>Rootstock</u>**](https://rootstock.io/) **(Bitcoin Sidechain)**\n\n*This is the chain that v3 contracts are deployed on*\n\n**Proposal Sponsor:** [**<u>Michigan Blockchain</u>**](https://twitter.com/UMichBlockchain)\n\n*This entity has >2.5M UNI and is therefore eligible for administering the onchain vote*\n\n# **A Primer on Rootstock**\n\n### **Bringing the EVM to Bitcoin**\n\nLaunched in 2018, RSK is the first Bitcoin sidechain. Generally speaking, a sidechain is an independent blockchain that’s fettered to a parent blockchain. In this case, Bitcoin is the parent chain, while RSK is the sidechain. The sidechain extension typically features aspects that the primary chain cannot support–Ethereum folk are very familiar with functionality separation nowadays due to the multichain and modular nature of EVM-based systems. Bitcoin is naturally more isolated, with a particular focus on sustaining the so-to-speak sanctity of its chain. However, the bare bones nature of Bitcoin means that it cannot support complex applications due to limitations around programmability. So how can this system be improved? Well, Bitcoin itself ideally stays untouched. Its usage as a ledger for an incorruptible store of value is therefore preserved, but it can be complemented with a sidechain like RSK.\n\n**RSK is an EVM-compatible Bitcoin sidechain**, meaning that it is Turing complete and enables developers to construct a robust ecosystem with close proximity to the Bitcoin blockchain. Specifically, the chain uses the [<u>RSK Virtual Machine (RVM)</u>](https://dev.rootstock.io/rsk/architecture/), which is compatible with the EVM at the op-code level. This is precisely why Uniswap, and alike Ethereum dapps, have the ability to seamlessly deploy on RSK without significant smart contract modifications. Core Ethereum infrastructure, wallets, and tooling (Hardhat, Truffle, Ether.js, Web3.js, etc) also support RSK–so devs can easily migrate to and build on RSK while a user can simply [<u>add RSK</u>](https://chainlist.org/chain/30) to their already running list of chains on Metamask. But a shared execution environment is not enough of a value add. That’s where we must consider RSK’s true value proposition: shared security with Bitcoin.\n\n\n\n### **Security Before All Else–Merged Mining**\n\nUnlike most other blockchains, RSK employs a consensus mechanism known as merged mining, allowing miners to simultaneously secure both Bitcoin and RSK at no extra cost. This results in RSK benefiting from the formidable security and stability touted by Bitcoin. Approximately[<u> 50% of the current Bitcoin hashrate is involved in securing RSK</u>](https://stats.rsk.co/). In other words, many of the same miners that provide security to Bitcoin are also securing RSK using the same hardware and energy inputs. Some of the largest Bitcoin mining pools like Antpool, Luxor, Braiins, F2Pool, and Binance Pool, have all opted into the merged mining setup.\n\n**What about previous failures surrounding merged mining like CoiledCoin?**\n\n* Rootstock doesn’t implement the traditional merge-mining mechanism used by CoiledCoin–but a more modern protocol with additional security guarantees. This is explained by RSK’s Chief Scientist [<u>here. </u>](https://medium.com/iovlabs-innovation-stories/modern-merge-mining-f294e45101a0)An in-depth analysis can be found in the Consensus section [<u>here</u>](https://medium.com/iovlabs-innovation-stories/measuring-rsk-security-d169ac03b181). The infamous CoiledCoin attack was performed by a single individual (LukeJr) who could control more than 51% of the blockchain hashrate, which is impossible on Rootstock, and was ideologically motivated because CoiledCoin competed with Bitcoin, something Rootstock does not do. On the contrary, Rootstock provides additional value to Bitcoin. Rootstock talks have been given at Bitcon [<u>conferences</u>](https://baltichoneybadger.com/) without opposition of any kind. The same individual that attacked CoiledCoin has a positive opinion regarding Rootstock and a neutral opinion on the sidechain’s hashrate escrows.\n\n\n\n### **Two-way Proof of Work Peg (PoWPeg)**\n\nRootstock does not have its own token nor inflation-based incentives. The way Bitcoin and RSK are connected is via a two-way peg using $BTC. A user deposits their $BTC in the RSK bridge, which, in turn, mints the rBTC on the RSK network. Both assets will always have a 1:1 ratio, and the max amount of mintable rBTC is the same as the max BTC supply of 21M. Hence, the main asset that the entire RSK ecosystem relies on is, at the end of the day, $BTC. RSK mining rewards are paid out to miners solely through transaction fees in the form of $rBTC.\n\nTypically, if a PoW chain relies solely on rewarding its miners with txn fees, and if that chain has low volume, it would be subject to a 51% attack. This issue, however, is subverted under a shared security system like merged mining. No matter how low the volume falls, the network will remain steady because the reliance is entirely on the security of Bitcoin. Sure, one could argue Bitcoin itself could face fragility if txn fees and incentives simultaneously become too low–however, it is an unlikely case since the adoption of $BTC is so pervasive that many large parties are incentivized to secure the system even if it’s at a capital loss. Plus, innovations like [<u>inscriptions continue to sustain momentum for Bitcoin’s usage</u>](https://messari.io/report/bitcoin-brief-runes-grayscale-and-microstrategy?referrer=research-reports).\n\n# **Bitcoin Ecosystem Catalysts**\n\nIf we analyze the previous points about the robust security and EVM compatibility of RSK, it’s clear how there may be an untapped market here for Uniswap to enter. Bitcoin, relative to the rest of the crypto market, is to a degree, isolated. The adoption of Bitcoin has been far more prominent around the world relative to other cryptocurrencies, even becoming [<u>legal tender in countries like El Salvador</u>](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/financial-services/pdf/el-salvadors-law-a-meaningful-test-for-bitcoin.pdf). The US regulatory environment, though constrictive to most cryptocurrencies, [<u>has been significantly more amenable to Bitcoin</u>](https://watcher.guru/news/secs-gary-gensler-says-bitcoin-is-not-a-security).\n\nIn the past year alone, Bitcoin has taken tremendous mindshare among both investors and users. A series of BTC Spot ETF filings were released in July as [<u>Blackrock led the pack</u>](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/spot-bitcoin-etf/). And August saw [<u>Grayscale secure a vital victory against the SEC</u>](https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-wins-sec-lawsuit), as the appeals court denied the SEC’s attempt to deny GBTC’s conversion to an ETF. On the user side, inscriptions dominated the Bitcoin landscape, bringing another creative use case to the seemingly latent chain. Although ordinal (non-fungible) & BRC-20 (fungible) inscription volume peaked earlier in the year, they have since sustained a large degree of their momentum, with [<u>average daily inscription mints increasing by 48.1% in Q3</u>](https://messari.io/report/state-of-bitcoin-q3-2023). The large Bitcoin fee uptrend can also be attributed the inscriptions rush.\n\nRSK is also taking advantage of these advancing narratives. Through [<u>RSKIP-387</u>](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP387.md), Bitcoin ordinals and inscriptions are looking to become available on RSK using the Powpeg bridge. In terms of projects, IOV Labs is [<u>funding</u>](https://rootstock.io/grants/) more than 5 ordinals-based projects that came out of the HackerEarth Ideathon + Hackathon.\n\n# **Liquidity Bootstrapping**\n\nRootstock will commit $3M Rootstock-based tokens in Uniswap-specific liquidity. The tokens will be deployed on Uniswap through the Rootstock integration with Oku, the funds will be provided by IOV Labs. They will work to deploy the funds as follows:\n\n* 1st Phase - Deployment: up to $400k into four liquidity pools for the following:\n  * $100k in RIF/RBTC\n  * $100k in RIF/rUSDT\n  * $100k in RBTC/rUSDT\n  * $100k in RIF/wETH\n\n<!---->\n\n* 2nd Phase - Growth: up to $1M to be distributed in the previous four liquidity pools created in the 1st Phase.\n  * The amount to be added into the liquidity pools will be decided according to the trading volume growth in a period of 3 months for each pool.\n* 3rd Phase - Expansion: up to $2M to be used in order to create new liquidity pools and token pairs.\n  * IOV labs will create new liquidity pools according to market demand. These new liquidity pools will be a minimum amount of $100k.\n\nThe goal is to deploy the $3M within 12 months in several phases. While the proposed limit is $3M, IOV Labs may increase this amount based on the outcome and success of this initiative.\n\nTrack active pools, TVL, volume, and fee metrics via [<u>Oku’s RSK analytics page</u>](https://oku.trade/info/rootstock/overview?utm_source=uniswap\\&utm_medium=forum\\&utm_campaign=rootstocktemp).\n\n# **Success Criteria**\n\nOverall, we propose the transparent measurement of this project’s success through the following success criteria and long-term goals:\n\n* At least a 30% increase in TVL across all initial pools during 2024, excluding the liquidity provided by IOV Labs\n* At least a 100% increase in average RSK DEX trading volume across all initial pools in the first six months after the onchain proposal\n* Successful adoption of Uniswap by the Rootstock community, aiming for a >20% increase in the number of active users by end of Q1 2024\n* Continuous and sustainable maintenance of the Uniswap-RSK integration contract, ensuring optimal operation and long-term security\n\n# **Deployment Details**\n\nThe approval of this proposal by Uniswap governance will lead the below Uniswap v3 contracts to be deemed as the canonical deployment on RSK. As is the case with all canonical v3 deployments, this deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3-deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended to include the reference to the stated v3 contracts on RSK.\n\n**Below are the deployed contracts:**\n\n\n\n| [v3CoreFactory](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0xAf37Ec98A00fD63689cF3060Bf3b6784e00CaD82)                           | 0xaF37EC98A00FD63689CF3060BF3B6784E00caD82      |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| [nftDescriptor](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0xA231609cF5EE20B3Ff9BD8BbfD1928737e6e6264)&#xA;                      | 0xA231609CF5ee20b3FF9bd8bBfD1928737E6e6264&#xA; |\n| [nonfungibleTokenPositionDescriptor](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0x1519aB9C0bf7c8F261acA6c58d59A152c95B3eBc)&#xA; | 0x1519ab9C0bF7C8f261aCa6c58d59A152C95B3Ebc&#xA; |\n| [nonfungibleTokenPositionManager](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0x9d9386C042f194B460ec424a1e57ACde25F5c4B1)&#xA;    | 0x9d9386c042F194B460Ec424a1e57ACDE25f5C4b1&#xA; |\n| [v3Migrator](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0x16678977cA4eC3dAD5Efc7b15780295fe5F56162)&#xA;                         | 0x16678977CA4ec3DAD5efc7b15780295FE5f56162&#xA; |\n| [Multicall2](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0x996a9858cdFa45aD68E47C9a30A7201E29c6A386)&#xA;                         | 0x996a9858cDfa45Ad68E47c9A30a7201E29c6a386&#xA; |\n| [proxyAdmin](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0xe6c623E32eD33f29b4D7c002c01Debda629E4604)&#xA;                         | 0xE6c623e32eD33f29b4D7C002C01DebDA629e4604&#xA; |\n| [tickLens](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0x55b9df5BF68ADE972191a91980459f48ECA16AFC)&#xA;                           | 0x55B9dF5bF68ADe972191a91980459f48ecA16afC&#xA; |\n| ​​[descriptorProxy](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0x2aeCBEE0Dc58E3419a52eEAF6ea16c498bAeE24f)&#xA;                  | 0x2AECbeE0dc58e3419A52EEaF6Ea16C498BAeE24F&#xA; |\n| [v3Staker](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0x96481062bFAA29AdAAEBfc5fa6f46D9556F0150c)&#xA;                           | 0x96481062BfAA29AdaaeBfC5FA6F46d9556F0150c&#xA; |\n| [quoterV2](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0xb51727C996c68E60f598a923A5006853Cd2fEB31)&#xA;                           | 0xb51727c996C68E60F598A923a5006853cd2fEB31&#xA; |\n| [swapRouter02](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0x0B14ff67F0014046b4b99057Aec4509640b3947A)&#xA;                       | 0x0B14ff67f0014046b4b99057Aec4509640b3947A&#xA; |\n| [Permit2](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0xfcF5986450e4a014FFe7ad4aE24921b589D039b5)&#xA;                            | 0xFcf5986450E4A014fFE7ad4Ae24921B589D039b5&#xA; |\n| [Universal Router](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0x244f68E77357f86A8522323EbF80B5FC2f814d3E)&#xA;                   | 0x244f68e77357f86a8522323eBF80b5FC2F814d3E&#xA; |\n| [Message Sender](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0xf5F4496219F31CDCBA6130b5402873624585615a)&#xA;                     | 0xf5F4496219F31CDCBa6130B5402873624585615a&#xA; |\n| [Message Receiver](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0x38aE7de6f9C51e17f49cf5730dD5f2d29FA20758)&#xA;                   | 0x38aE7De6f9c51e17f49cF5730DD5F2d29fa20758&#xA; |",

      "content": "Proposal Authors: [Abdullah Umar](https://twitter.com/abdullahbumar) (Michigan Blockchain) & [Cameron O'Donnell](https://twitter.com/Consensys) (Consensys)\n\nFor clear graphs and visuals, visit the original forum post at <https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-lower-onchain-proposal-threshold/22429>\n\nNOTE: PGov is proposing as one address can only submit one vote at a time\n\n# Summary\n\nWe are proposing to lower the current proposal threshold (PT) from 2.5M UNI to 1M UNI with the intention of broadening the delegate base capable of submitting onchain proposals, thereby increasing delegate engagement. This request aligns with the increasing maturity and expanding influence of the Uniswap protocol.\n\n# Terminology\n\nProposal threshold and voting quorum are two vital parameters for ensuring that a DAO is functioning properly.\n\n* The quorum dictates how much friction is required to pass a proposal. This parameter conveys the *minimum number of votes required for a proposal to pass*. Quorum should NOT be easy to reach and ideally requires the participation of numerous large delegates. A high enough quorum ensures that malicious and/or ineffectual proposals do not pass. **Uniswap’s current quorum is 40M UNI. The quorum is a gauge for how difficult it is to pass a proposal.**\n* The PT serves a similar purpose to the quorum parameter. This number conveys the *minimum amount of $UNI that a delegate must hold in order to create a proposal onchain.* **Uniswap’s current proposal threshold is 2.5M UNI.** The friction point here is that a wallet must either purchase or be delegated enough governance tokens to reach this threshold, otherwise, they cannot put a vote onchain. A high PT prevents a DAO from freely posting proposals, subjecting it to centralization risk, while a low PT can lead to vote spamming. **The PT is a gauge for determining how freely people are allowed to create proposals.**\n\nIt’s important to put quorum and PT in the context of the governance token’s circulating and total supply, allowing us to normalize parameters across multiple DAOs.\n\n* **Circulating Supply (CS):** The total number of tokens currently available and active in the market, excluding those held in reserve or otherwise not in circulation. **Uniswap’s current CS is ~754M UNI.**\n* **Total Supply (TS):** The complete count of tokens created, including those in circulation, held in reserve, or locked for various purposes, representing the maximum potential supply. **Uniswap’s TS is 1B UNI.**\n\n# Motivation\n\nAt inception, Uniswap DAO’s governance framework required that “[1% of all UNI must be cast in favor to submit a proposal, and 4% in order to pass a vote.](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/governance/guide-to-voting)” In terms of tokens, this meant that the proposal threshold was 10M UNI, and the quorum was 40M UNI. These percentages use the *total supply* of UNI (1B), not the *circulating supply*, as the denominator. Acknowledging the restrictive nature of this parameter, the proposal threshold was quickly [reduced from 10M UNI to 2.5M UNI](https://boardroom.io/uniswap/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6dW5pc3dhcDphcmNoaXZlOjQ=). This alteration took place **over two years ago**.\n\nSince then, we have seen Uniswap governance mature and onboard new delegates. And of the current delegate cohort, ~33 have the ability to post onchain proposals. Unfortunately, many of the entities with enough voting power are scarcely involved in DAO forums and votes. Lowering the PT will help reduce the proposal creation barrier for delegates who are actually active in the DAO. This, in concert with [recent initiatives to increase active delegates’ voting power](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-delegation-of-uni-to-active-but-underrepresented-delegates/22238), will aid in further decentralizing Uniswap decision making.\n\n# Rationale for Reducing the PT to 1M UNI\n\n### **New DAOs Require High Thresholds**\n\nMost DAOs set decentralization as a north star metric that’s achieved over time. Initially, protocols tend to start out more centralized, and their governance parameters are indicative of their degree of maturity. A less mature protocol should start off with a high PT, for example. Core contributors and a circle of trusted entities should primarily be involved in proposal creation to ensure that the protocol grows legs. At this time, the token value tends to be lower as well, along with a relatively insignificant treasury. Therefore, the respective PT and quorum should be high enough to prevent nefarious actors from depleting reserves and collapsing the protocol before it reaches any sort of prominence. Responsibilities and workloads should, however, become dispersed across more and more contributors as the protocol grows.\n\n### **As a Protocol Grows, the PT Economic Cost Also Increases**\n\nA growing protocol typically correlates with an increasing token price. So, the economic cost of creating proposals and reaching quorum simultaneously increases. This means that the DAO must over time reduce such parameters. When Uniswap lowered its PT to 2.5M, the economic cost of putting a vote onchain was still upwards of $50M. At that time, the UNI token was less than a year old, and governance was extremely nascent, so caution remained the best policy.\n\nIn the past year, the UNI token went as low as ~$3.50. With a PT of 2.5M, the economic cost of putting a vote onchain hit ~$8.75M. And yet, the DAO wasn’t spammed with votes. It’s therefore clear that we should not be worried about an influx of useless proposals upon a reduction of the PT. Plus, as Uniswap v4, X, and perhaps a fee switch are introduced, along with a turn in economic conditions, the token value will likely increase. Hence, a reduction of the PT seems to be inevitable. It’s a matter of when–not if.\n\n### **If You Have 1M UNI, You Are Likely a Trusted Actor**\n\nWe are proposing to reduce the PT to 1M UNI. That is in and of itself not an insignificant amount. If an entity is able to purchase that much UNI or attain an equivalent amount via delegation, it’s likely that they are a trusted and competent party. Okay, perhaps that’s too optimistic. *So let’s ask–if the entity is nefarious, what’s the worst that can happen?* Answer: you get a bad proposal that never reaches quorum. If a nefarious proposal does reach quorum, we’ve got other problems. But it’s unlikely due to the massive capital requirement.\n\n**At the end of the day, Uniswap’s 40M quorum is enough to prevent malice, regardless of how low the PT is.** Again, the quorum is a gauge for how difficult it is to pass a proposal, and the PT is a gauge for determining how freely people are allowed to create proposals. **Suppressing the latter is counterproductive to growing and decentralizing the DAO.**\n\n### **We Should Increases the DAO’s Autonomy**\n\nAs of today, ~33 delegates are able to cross the 2.5M PT. Decreasing the PT to 1M increases that number to ~47 (again, with a small margin of error). This is effectively a centralization choke point, where proposers must turn to a select few delegates who may or may not be in support of sponsoring a proposal.\n\n| Wallet                                     | Delegated UNI | Entity   | Active?   | % Vote | Proposals Posted |\n| ------------------------------------------ | ------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | ---------------- |\n| 0x683a4f9915d6216f73d6df50151725036bd26c02 | 7,501,052.07  | Gauntlet | Yes       | 90%    | 1                |\n| 0x553f674dd7d102ad79c644103974a1cc53b62ac2 | 5,000,184.21  | Teemu    | Yes       | 80%    | 1                |\n| 0xa2bf1b0a7e079767b4701b5a1d9d5700eb42d1d1 | 5,000,021.65  | Ken (UF) | No        | 0%     | 1                |\n| 0x13bdae8c5f0fc40231f0e6a4ad70196f59138548 | 3,851,337.13  | Michigan | Yes       | 100%   | 6                |\n| 0x070341aa5ed571f0fb2c4a5641409b1a46b4961b | 3,000,601.96  | Penn     | Yes       | 80%    | 2                |\n| 0xa6e8772af29b29b9202a073f8e36f447689beef6 | 2,502,935.57  | GFX Labs | Yes       | 90%    | 5                |\n| 0xed11e5ea95a5a3440fbaadc4cc404c56d0a5bb04 | 2,500,839.08  | she256   | Yes       | 80%    | 2                |\n| 0x5d8908afee1df9f7f0830105f8be828f97ce9e68 | 2,500,667.32  | Argent   | No        | 10%    | 1                |\n| 0x7ae109a63ff4dc852e063a673b40bed85d22e585 | 2,500,030.00  | Berkeley | No        | 20%    | 1                |\n| 0xdc1f98682f4f8a5c6d54f345f448437b83f5e432 | 2,500,010.00  | Columbia | Sometimes | 60%    | 1                |\n| 0xb7771f70633c7e54e61dd38d01c26da0e86be1a5 | 2,500,000.00  | Chicago  | No        | 10%    | 1                |\n\n*The above table shows the number of proposals created by delegates with large amounts of voting power today. This does not include proposals posted by wallets who received temporary delegation. “% vote” is participation in the past 10 onchain votes. Proposals posted is the number of proposals created onchain since the Governor Bravo upgrade (i.e. since Q3 2021).*\n\nIf the few delegates who have enough voting power are disinterested in a proposal, it may never go onchain, even if the proposal passes the temperature check phase. One option that proposers currently have is the ability to turn to the Uniswap Foundation, who can then delegate the proposer 2.5M UNI–however, that creates a reliance on the Foundation.\n\n# Ethereum DAO Comparables\n\nComparing governance parameters and token ratios between DAOs is a tough exercise since most DAOs are not mature and have different objectives. The reality is that Uniswap sits in a position to set standards for other DAOs, and we certainly don’t have all of the answers, so the best that we can do is experiment. Regardless, below are some data illustrating where the Uniswap DAO sits compared to the industry.\n\n*The* [forum post contains graphs](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-lower-onchain-proposal-threshold/22429) *comparing the Proposal Threshold (PT), Total Supply (TS), Circulating Supply (CS), and Quorum (Q) ratios of 7 DAOs on Ethereum.*\n\nUniswap currently has the highest Q/TS ratio, along with Compound, from the given sample. It’s also on the higher end when looking at Q/CS. This means that relative to other DAOs, it takes more votes to pass a proposal. **Since we are not proposing to lower the quorum, we can rest assured that the barrier for a vote to pass remains high enough to prevent security issues.**\n\nThe PT/TS and PT/CS ratios, however, are on average lower for Uniswap relative to the sample. **So, relatively speaking, proposal creation is already easier for Uniswap, and the PT reduction to 1M will make it even easier.** This may simply indicate that DAOs overall are too constrictive. But a relative comparison here doesn’t tell the whole story. Even though the PT/TS and PT/CS are lower for Uni DAO, the absolute dollar amount that it takes to post a proposal is by far still the highest for Uniswap. The below table shows that the PT in dollar terms is $15.6M, with Aave coming in second at $7.2M and Compound third with only $1.3M. **The dollar cost for creating a proposal on Uniswap is ~4.5 times higher when compared to the sample.**\n\n| Protocol          | Economic Cost of PT | FDV                | Mcap              | Quorum          | Treasury          |\n| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |\n| Uniswap           | $15,575,000.00      | $6,230,000,000.00  | $4,695,966,335.41 | $249,200,000.00 | $2,100,000,000.00 |\n| Aave              | $7,200,000.00       | $1,440,000,000.00  | $1,317,033,360.00 | $28,800,000.00  | $134,000,000.00   |\n| Compound          | $1,275,000.00       | $510,000,000.00    | $349,660,335.00   | $20,400,000.00  | $114,000,000.00   |\n| ENS               | $890,000.00         | $890,000,000.00    | $229,470,773.70   | $8,900,000.00   | $597,000,000.00   |\n| Hop               | $50,000.00          | $50,000,000.00     | $3,761,124.15     | $150,000.00     | $25,800,000.00    |\n| Arbitrum Core     | $1,070,000.00       | $10,700,000,000.00 | $1,364,250,000.00 | $130,465,100.00 | $-                |\n| Arbitrum Treasury | $1,070,000.00       | $10,700,000,000.00 | $1,364,250,000.00 | $78,281,200.00  | $3,900,000,000.00 |\n| Gitcoin           | $1,090,000.00       | $109,000,000.00    | $66,341,074.39    | $2,725,000.00   | $64,300,000.00    |\n\n*Above are the PT, TS, CS, and Quorum in dollar terms (with prices as of December 11, 2023)*\n\n# A New Model Going Forward\n\nToday, the role of a delegate is pretty passive. All that’s required is voting yes, no, or abstain on proposals–unfortunately, many delegates don’t even fulfill that responsibility. Some delegates may take it a step further and contribute to discussions. And a select few with enough voting power may also create onchain proposals. The ability to post a vote onchain on behalf of another entity is currently a job that’s not given enough weight. Let’s categorize this relationship further.\n\n**Delegate**: an entity with delegated voting power\n\n**Proposer**: the entity that authors/initiates a proposal\n\n**Sponsor**: the facilitator of the governance process, taking a proposal from early-stage to onchain execution. Delegates with enough voting power to meet the PT are considered sponsors\n\nAn ideal DAO ecosystem is one where we have a handful of entities with the ability to sponsor proposals. A rolodex of sponsors should enable proposers to pick and choose which sponsors to approach for facilitating the governance process. Ideally, the proposer seeks to team up with a sponsor who holds similar values so that both parties are motivated to see the proposal through. Sponsors can also help co-author proposals, depending on how involved they’d like to get. A variety of sponsors, each with their own biases and areas of focus, allows for healthy debate and diversity of opinion. The sponsors should therefore be stewards of the DAO and not merely wallets who happen to have a bunch of voting power. An interconnected system like this is also superior to simply asking the Uniswap Foundation for temporary delegation as it’s less communal than that of sponsor–proposer partnerships.\n\nBeyond the collectivistic aspect, sponsors, if they so choose, can take their proposals from RFC to onchain vote independently. This autonomy is something that’s currently scarce, which may be a contributing factor behind a lack of development in DAOs.\n\nReducing the PT certainly helps lower friction in the mentioned areas, ideally leading to a more democratized and active Uniswap DAO.\n\n| Protocol | Proposal Threshold | Total Supply     | Circulating Supply | Quorum        | PT/TS  | PT/CS  | PT/Q   | Q/TS   | Q/CS   |\n| -------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| Uniswap  | 1,000,000.00       | 1,000,000,000.00 | 753,766,667.00     | 40,000,000.00 | 0.100% | 0.133% | 2.500% | 4.000% | 5.307% |\n\n*Above would be the new ratios upon lowering the PT to 1M*",

      "content": "The details can be found here: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-deployments-accountability-committee-next-steps-the-committee-application-thread/22475?u=doo_stablelab\n\n**Next Committee Member Selection Process and the Duration**\n\nThe Committee will be composed of 4 members, selected through a governance decision process similar to the original Committee, but with one fewer member. To ensure ample time for applications, a forum thread for the Committee member role will be available in the week leading up to Christmas. It’s important to note that the closing date for applications will be January 12th at 23:59 EST, considering the holiday season in late December and early January. On January 15th, a snapshot-weighted voting will take place, allowing each voter to distribute their voting power among any number of choices. The top four candidates will then be chosen as members for the upcoming Committee.\n\nIn terms of the duration of the next Committee, it will be once again 6 months. Therefore, the next Committee will span from mid-January to mid-July. Once the term ends, the next Committee should share learnings from the new program.\n\n**Applicants**\n\n**Applicant Name: @Juanbug (@PGov)**\nHello everyone! First off, I just wanted to say thanks to @Doo_StableLab for drafting this re-election post. For the last 6+ months, I’ve had the honor of working with him and three other talented committee members on the first cycle of this committee.\n\nTo be concise, I’ll link my first cycle nomination here 3 since much is the same, but in short, leading the Penn Blockchain and PGov platforms for 2+ years has allowed me to help various teams with their deployments and I look forward to continue doing so. With this new iteration of the committee, I would like to see/do more on the topic of general accountability and not just cross chain deployments to the extent of which the DAO and UF approve. Further, I’m looking forward to v4 deployment proposals and doing more on the topic of promised incentive and liquidity accountability.\n\nThanks to everyone for their consideration and hope everyone has a Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays & New Year!\n\n**Applicant Name: @Doo_StableLab [StableLab]**\nApplicant Summary including why interested in applying for the Program (1 Paragraph):\n\nThere were a lot of lessons learned while participating in the first Uniswap Deployments Accountability Committee. If selected again, this time will be focusing on reporting to improve the transparency for the Uniswap community. Experience in participating in various governance and committees focusing on evaluation and accountability will be an asset for the next Committee as well.\n\n**Applicant Name: Abdullah Umar (Michigan Blockchain / Arana Digital)**\n\nI’m applying for this role because of my previous work with 6 deployments in the last year. I’ve had the fortune to help facilitate the gov process and aid in authoring Uniswap v3 deployment proposals for\n\nAvalanche C-chain\nMoonbeam (Polkadot parachain)\nFilecoin Virtual Machine\nBase\nScroll\nRootstock (pending)\nCollaborating closely with these protocols has helped me develop a sense of how to best conduct due diligence and assess these various deployments. Going forward, the goal of this committee should be to continually assess the efficacy of these deployments and deliberate how Uniswap’s multichain future should be shaped. This will become even more interesting with Uniswap v4 rolling out soon. Multiple dimensions of complexity will be introduced with hooks, and that requires diligently planning which chains deserve v4 deployments. My pursuit with the committee is to critically think about how Uniswap should adapt with the ever-innovating crypto space with the likes of more and more L2s, VMs, architectures like EVM parallelization–and ensure that the protocol continues to sustain and grow its marketshare.\n\n**Applicant Name: 0xpibblez (Blockworks Research)**\n\nHey everyone, I’m glad to see a re-election process for the accountability committee. As a quick intro, I have been a research analyst at Blockworks Research for the past two years and started the recent Uniswap community calls that we are now conducting on a monthly basis. It looks like the committee was quite busy over the last term, and it’s exciting to see such high demand for Uniswap deployments across many chains.\n\nI’m interested in joining the accountability committee to help oversee these potential new deployments, especially with v4 coming soon. It will be important to maintain momentum with new deployments and keep communication open and transparent across all parties. One way the committee can do this is to assign relationship leads within the committee and plot a firm cadence of communication to optimize the process. My role at Blockworks Research has enabled me to gain substantial experience in protocol relationship management. Our team is already connected with the majority of L1s and L2s and Blockworks tends to open a lot doors with key stakeholders at these companies. I would love the opportunity to contribute my skills to the accountability committee in any way possible to enhance positive outcomes for all stakeholders.\n\n**Applicant Name: @Frisson [Tally]**\n\nApplicant Summary: Hi Uniswap Delegates, I’m Frisson. My two primary roles are VP of Growth at Tally and Arbitrum DAO Delegate. I love Uniswap and have been looking for opportunities to contribute to the DAO. I’m excited to throw my hat in the ring for the Uniswap Deployment Accountability Committee! As VP of Growth, I manage the process of supporting new chains at Tally. I regularly evaluate new chain opportunities in terms of the market size and competitive environment, manage implementation, and drive business development/go-to-market. One area of focus I’m interested in bringing to the Uniswap Deployments Accountability Committee is testing a proactive go-to-market strategy. I’d like to help the Uniswap DAO do more to drive adoption of Uniswap on deployed chains. There is a competitive environment for AMM adoption on most chains, with Uniswap often competing against “native” products. Often, competitive products to Uniswap receive grants to incentivize adoption, while Uniswap does not. The original Uniswap Deployments Accountability Committee proposal suggests that we should “require that deployment proposals offer financial incentives to Uniswap”. I believe this approach is somewhat presumptuous and we would be better served by thoughtfully evaluating opportunities to partner with new chains to incentivize adoption. If appointed, I would implement a test go-to-market strategy for Uniswap on some deployed chains that is focused on identifying opportunities to incentivize adoption. I would document my efforts and measure success, then make a recommendation at the end of the six-month term on whether we should continue or expand such efforts.",

      "title": "[Temperature Check] Lower Onchain Proposal Threshold",
      "content": "Proposal Authors: [Abdullah Umar](https://twitter.com/abdullahbumar) (Michigan Blockchain) & [Cameron O'Donnell](https://twitter.com/Consensys) (Consensys)\n\nFor clear graphs and visuals, visit the original forum post at https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-lower-onchain-proposal-threshold/22429\n\n# Summary\n\nWe are proposing to lower the current proposal threshold (PT) from 2.5M UNI to 1M UNI with the intention of broadening the delegate base capable of submitting onchain proposals, thereby increasing delegate engagement. This request aligns with the increasing maturity and expanding influence of the Uniswap protocol.\n\n# Terminology\n\nProposal threshold and voting quorum are two vital parameters for ensuring that a DAO is functioning properly.\n\n* The quorum dictates how much friction is required to pass a proposal. This parameter conveys the *minimum number of votes required for a proposal to pass*. Quorum should NOT be easy to reach and ideally requires the participation of numerous large delegates. A high enough quorum ensures that malicious and/or ineffectual proposals do not pass. **Uniswap’s current quorum is 40M UNI. The quorum is a gauge for how difficult it is to pass a proposal.**\n\n* The PT serves a similar purpose to the quorum parameter. This number conveys the *minimum amount of $UNI that a delegate must hold in order to create a proposal onchain.* **Uniswap’s current proposal threshold is 2.5M UNI.** The friction point here is that a wallet must either purchase or be delegated enough governance tokens to reach this threshold, otherwise, they cannot put a vote onchain. A high PT prevents a DAO from freely posting proposals, subjecting it to centralization risk, while a low PT can lead to vote spamming. **The PT is a gauge for determining how freely people are allowed to create proposals.**\n\nIt’s important to put quorum and PT in the context of the governance token’s circulating and total supply, allowing us to normalize parameters across multiple DAOs.\n\n* **Circulating Supply (CS):** The total number of tokens currently available and active in the market, excluding those held in reserve or otherwise not in circulation. **Uniswap’s current CS is ~754M UNI.**\n\n* **Total Supply (TS):** The complete count of tokens created, including those in circulation, held in reserve, or locked for various purposes, representing the maximum potential supply. **Uniswap’s TS is 1B UNI.**\n\n# Motivation\n\nAt inception, Uniswap DAO’s governance framework required that “[1% of all UNI must be cast in favor to submit a proposal, and 4% in order to pass a vote.](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/governance/guide-to-voting)” In terms of tokens, this meant that the proposal threshold was 10M UNI, and the quorum was 40M UNI. These percentages use the *total supply* of UNI (1B), not the *circulating supply*, as the denominator. Acknowledging the restrictive nature of this parameter, the proposal threshold was quickly [reduced from 10M UNI to 2.5M UNI](https://boardroom.io/uniswap/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6dW5pc3dhcDphcmNoaXZlOjQ=). This alteration took place **over two years ago**.\n\nSince then, we have seen Uniswap governance mature and onboard new delegates. And of the current delegate cohort, ~33 have the ability to post onchain proposals. Unfortunately, many of the entities with enough voting power are scarcely involved in DAO forums and votes. Lowering the PT will help reduce the proposal creation barrier for delegates who are actually active in the DAO. This, in concert with [recent initiatives to increase active delegates’ voting power](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-delegation-of-uni-to-active-but-underrepresented-delegates/22238), will aid in further decentralizing Uniswap decision making.\n\n# Rationale for Reducing the PT to 1M UNI\n### **New DAOs Require High Thresholds**\nMost DAOs set decentralization as a north star metric that’s achieved over time. Initially, protocols tend to start out more centralized, and their governance parameters are indicative of their degree of maturity. A less mature protocol should start off with a high PT, for example. Core contributors and a circle of trusted entities should primarily be involved in proposal creation to ensure that the protocol grows legs. At this time, the token value tends to be lower as well, along with a relatively insignificant treasury. Therefore, the respective PT and quorum should be high enough to prevent nefarious actors from depleting reserves and collapsing the protocol before it reaches any sort of prominence. Responsibilities and workloads should, however, become dispersed across more and more contributors as the protocol grows.\n\n### **As a Protocol Grows, the PT Economic Cost Also Increases**\nA growing protocol typically correlates with an increasing token price. So, the economic cost of creating proposals and reaching quorum simultaneously increases. This means that the DAO must over time reduce such parameters. When Uniswap lowered its PT to 2.5M, the economic cost of putting a vote onchain was still upwards of $50M. At that time, the UNI token was less than a year old, and governance was extremely nascent, so caution remained the best policy. \n\nIn the past year, the UNI token went as low as ~$3.50. With a PT of 2.5M, the economic cost of putting a vote onchain hit ~$8.75M. And yet, the DAO wasn’t spammed with votes. It’s therefore clear that we should not be worried about an influx of useless proposals upon a reduction of the PT. Plus, as Uniswap v4, X, and perhaps a fee switch are introduced, along with a turn in economic conditions, the token value will likely increase. Hence, a reduction of the PT seems to be inevitable. It’s a matter of when–not if.\n\n### **If You Have 1M UNI, You Are Likely a Trusted Actor**\nWe are proposing to reduce the PT to 1M UNI. That is in and of itself not an insignificant amount. If an entity is able to purchase that much UNI or attain an equivalent amount via delegation, it’s likely that they are a trusted and competent party. Okay, perhaps that’s too optimistic. *So let’s ask–if the entity is nefarious, what’s the worst that can happen?* Answer: you get a bad proposal that never reaches quorum. If a nefarious proposal does reach quorum, we’ve got other problems. But it’s unlikely due to the massive capital requirement.\n\n**At the end of the day, Uniswap’s 40M quorum is enough to prevent malice, regardless of how low the PT is.** Again, the quorum is a gauge for how difficult it is to pass a proposal, and the PT is a gauge for determining how freely people are allowed to create proposals. **Suppressing the latter is counterproductive to growing and decentralizing the DAO.**\n\n### **We Should Increases the DAO’s Autonomy**\nAs of today, ~33 delegates are able to cross the 2.5M PT. Decreasing the PT to 1M increases that number to ~47 (again, with a small margin of error). This is effectively a centralization choke point, where proposers must turn to a select few delegates who may or may not be in support of sponsoring a proposal. \n\n| Wallet                                     | Delegated UNI  | Entity   | Active?   | % Vote | Proposals Posted |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------|----------|-----------|--------|------------------|\n| 0x683a4f9915d6216f73d6df50151725036bd26c02 |  7,501,052.07  | Gauntlet | Yes       | 90%    | 1                |\n| 0x553f674dd7d102ad79c644103974a1cc53b62ac2 |  5,000,184.21  | Teemu    | Yes       | 80%    | 1                |\n| 0xa2bf1b0a7e079767b4701b5a1d9d5700eb42d1d1 |  5,000,021.65  | Ken (UF) | No        | 0%     | 1                |\n| 0x13bdae8c5f0fc40231f0e6a4ad70196f59138548 |  3,851,337.13  | Michigan | Yes       | 100%   | 6                |\n| 0x070341aa5ed571f0fb2c4a5641409b1a46b4961b |  3,000,601.96  | Penn     | Yes       | 80%    | 2                |\n| 0xa6e8772af29b29b9202a073f8e36f447689beef6 |  2,502,935.57  | GFX Labs | Yes       | 90%    | 5                |\n| 0xed11e5ea95a5a3440fbaadc4cc404c56d0a5bb04 |  2,500,839.08  | she256   | Yes       | 80%    | 2                |\n| 0x5d8908afee1df9f7f0830105f8be828f97ce9e68 |  2,500,667.32  | Argent   | No        | 10%    | 1                |\n| 0x7ae109a63ff4dc852e063a673b40bed85d22e585 |  2,500,030.00  | Berkely  | No        | 20%    | 1                |\n| 0xdc1f98682f4f8a5c6d54f345f448437b83f5e432 |  2,500,010.00  | Columbia | Sometimes | 60%    | 1                |\n| 0xb7771f70633c7e54e61dd38d01c26da0e86be1a5 |  2,500,000.00  | Chicago  | No        | 10%    | 1                |\n\n*The above table shows the number of proposals created by delegates with large amounts of voting power today. This does not include proposals posted by wallets who received temporary delegation. “% vote” is participation in the past 10 onchain votes. Proposals posted is the number of proposals created onchain since the Governor Bravo upgrade (i.e. since Q3 2021).*\n\nIf the few delegates who have enough voting power are disinterested in a proposal, it may never go onchain, even if the proposal passes the temperature check phase. One option that proposers currently have is the ability to turn to the Uniswap Foundation, who can then delegate the proposer 2.5M UNI–however, that creates a reliance on the Foundation. \n\n# Ethereum DAO Comparables\nComparing governance parameters and token ratios between DAOs is a tough exercise since most DAOs are not mature and have different objectives. The reality is that Uniswap sits in a position to set standards for other DAOs, and we certainly don’t have all of the answers, so the best that we can do is experiment. Regardless, below are some data illustrating where the Uniswap DAO sits compared to the industry.\n\n*The [forum post contains graphs](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-lower-onchain-proposal-threshold/22429) comparing the Proposal Threshold (PT), Total Supply (TS), Circulating Supply (CS), and Quorum (Q) ratios of 7 DAOs on Ethereum.*\n\nUniswap currently has the highest Q/TS ratio, along with Compound, from the given sample. It’s also on the higher end when looking at Q/CS. This means that relative to other DAOs, it takes more votes to pass a proposal. **Since we are not proposing to lower the quorum, we can rest assured that the barrier for a vote to pass remains high enough to prevent security issues.** \n\nThe PT/TS and PT/CS ratios, however, are on average lower for Uniswap relative to the sample. **So, relatively speaking, proposal creation is already easier for Uniswap, and the PT reduction to 1M will make it even easier.** This may simply indicate that DAOs overall are too constrictive. But a relative comparison here doesn’t tell the whole story. Even though the PT/TS and PT/CS are lower for Uni DAO, the absolute dollar amount that it takes to post a proposal is by far still the highest for Uniswap. The below table shows that the PT in dollar terms is $15.6M, with Aave coming in second at $7.2M and Compound third with only $1.3M. **The dollar cost for creating a proposal on Uniswap is ~4.5 times higher when compared to the sample.** \n\n| Protocol          | Economic Cost of PT | FDV                  | Mcap                | Quorum            | Treasury            |\n|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| Uniswap           |  $15,575,000.00     |  $6,230,000,000.00   |  $4,695,966,335.41  |  $249,200,000.00  |  $2,100,000,000.00  |\n| Aave              |  $7,200,000.00      |  $1,440,000,000.00   |  $1,317,033,360.00  |  $28,800,000.00   |  $134,000,000.00    |\n| Compound          |  $1,275,000.00      |  $510,000,000.00     |  $349,660,335.00    |  $20,400,000.00   |  $114,000,000.00    |\n| ENS               |  $890,000.00        |  $890,000,000.00     |  $229,470,773.70    |  $8,900,000.00    |  $597,000,000.00    |\n| Hop               |  $50,000.00         |  $50,000,000.00      |  $3,761,124.15      |  $150,000.00      |  $25,800,000.00     |\n| Arbitrum Core     |  $1,070,000.00      |  $10,700,000,000.00  |  $1,364,250,000.00  |  $130,465,100.00  |  $-                 |\n| Arbitrum Treasury |  $1,070,000.00      |  $10,700,000,000.00  |  $1,364,250,000.00  |  $78,281,200.00   |  $3,900,000,000.00  |\n| Gitcoin           |  $1,090,000.00      |  $109,000,000.00     |  $66,341,074.39     |  $2,725,000.00    |  $64,300,000.00     |\n\n*Above are the PT, TS, CS, and Quorum in dollar terms (with prices as of December 11, 2023)*\n\n# A New Model Going Forward\nToday, the role of a delegate is pretty passive. All that’s required is voting yes, no, or abstain on proposals–unfortunately, many delegates don’t even fulfill that responsibility. Some delegates may take it a step further and contribute to discussions. And a select few with enough voting power may also create onchain proposals. The ability to post a vote onchain on behalf of another entity is currently a job that’s not given enough weight. Let’s categorize this relationship further.\n\n**Delegate**: an entity with delegated voting power\n\n**Proposer**: the entity that authors/initiates a proposal\n\n**Sponsor**: the facilitator of the governance process, taking a proposal from early-stage to onchain execution. Delegates with enough voting power to meet the PT are considered sponsors\n\nAn ideal DAO ecosystem is one where we have a handful of entities with the ability to sponsor proposals. A rolodex of sponsors should enable proposers to pick and choose which sponsors to approach for facilitating the governance process. Ideally, the proposer seeks to team up with a sponsor who holds similar values so that both parties are motivated to see the proposal through. Sponsors can also help co-author proposals, depending on how involved they’d like to get. A variety of sponsors, each with their own biases and areas of focus, allows for healthy debate and diversity of opinion. The sponsors should therefore be stewards of the DAO and not merely wallets who happen to have a bunch of voting power. An interconnected system like this is also superior to simply asking the Uniswap Foundation for temporary delegation as it’s less communal than that of sponsor–proposer partnerships.\n\nBeyond the collectivistic aspect, sponsors, if they so choose, can take their proposals from RFC to onchain vote independently. This autonomy is something that’s currently scarce, which may be a contributing factor behind a lack of development in DAOs. \n\nReducing the PT certainly helps lower friction in the mentioned areas, ideally leading to a more democratized and active Uniswap DAO.\n\n| Protocol | Proposal Threshold | Total Supply       | Circulating Supply | Quorum          | PT/TS  | PT/CS  | PT/Q   | Q/TS   | Q/CS   |\n|----------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Uniswap  |  1,000,000.00      |  1,000,000,000.00  |  753,766,667.00    |  40,000,000.00  | 0.100% | 0.133% | 2.500% | 4.000% | 5.307% |\n\n*Above would be the new ratios upon lowering the PT to 1M*",

      "content": "For the full proposal on the forums, please visit https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-on-rootstock-bitcoin-sidechain/22466\n\n# Proposal Motivation\n\nWe [Michigan Blockchain](https://twitter.com/UMichBlockchain) are submitting this proposal to facilitate the integration of Uniswap V3 on Rootstock (RSK), the first Bitcoin sidechain. Rootstock combines the security of Bitcoin and the functionality of Ethereum. This amalgam is enabled by RSK’s implementation of a merged mining architecture and an EVM-compatible execution environment. Unlike most deployments during the bear market, RSK has doubled-down on this initiative, allocating a total of $3 million for bootstrapping liquidity across various pools.\n\nWhat’s more is that the [IOV Labs](https://www.iovlabs.org/) team (the research and development group behind RSK) has been closely collaborating with both [GFX Labs](https://twitter.com/labsGFX) and [Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/) to ensure that this deployment is completed seamlessly. They have taken all of the necessary technical steps to be eligible for finalizing this deployment. The relevant v3 contracts are now deployed on RSK (see “Deployment Details”), along with pools for trading RBTC (1:1 with $BTC), RIF, and wETH, all accessible using the [Oku Trade front-end](https://oku.trade/app/rootstock/pool/0xd2ffe51ab4e622a411abbe634832a19d919e9c55?utm_source=uniswap&utm_medium=forum&utm_campaign=rootstocktemp). This deployment has already aggregated over [$1.1M of TVL](https://oku.trade/info/rootstock/overview?utm_source=uniswap&utm_medium=forum&utm_campaign=rootstocktemp) and is seeing[ upwards of $540k in daily volume](https://oku.trade/info/rootstock/overview?utm_source=uniswap&utm_medium=forum&utm_campaign=rootstocktemp) over the past two weeks. Plus, the Wormhole integration is in place to facilitate any cross-chain governance messaging. The final hurdle is to officiate this proposal through the Uniswap governance process, and recognize this as the canonical v3 deployment on RSK.\n\n### Introducing Uniswap to the Bitcoin Space\n\nWe’ve been in contact with the IOV Labs for the past couple of months regarding this deployment. Our teams have had back and forth conversations regarding the merits and drawbacks of bringing Uniswap to a Bitcoin sidechain, which, admittedly, has limited mindshare among DeFi users across other EVM chains. Currently, there are two divergent user profiles when it comes to Bitcoin. The first is the staunch Bitcoin Maxi. This person views $BTC as the one and true cryptocurrency, with a notable preference for highly secure and isolated systems. Conversely, we have the DeFi users. Most of their activity takes place on the EVM, and their objective is financial gain using various onchain instruments–staking, liquidity provision, borrowing/lending, yield farming, perpetuals, etc. Security is important to everyone, at least idealistically speaking, but users’ actions often indicate a preference for profiteering in the face of taking a degree of risk.\n\nHowever, we think that there may be a market in between these two that Uniswap–and DeFi protocols in general–could help service. It could very well be the case that users who want to conduct DeFi transactions using $BTC will do so through dapps launched on RSK. The security guarantees using the merged-mining setup make interacting with $BTC on RSK ($RBTC) more secure than using $BTC on alternative smart contract platforms. Although it may be a reaching assumption that users will have the motivation to prioritize security to such an extent, easy access to RSK via wallets like Metamask make it frictionless for users to jump between ETH and RSK. The potential concern here, however, is liquidity fragmentation. That is, unless, a certain market of users exclusively uses RSK for all things BTC.\n\n# A Primer on Rootstock\n\n### Bringing the EVM to Bitcoin\n\nLaunched in 2018, RSK is the first Bitcoin sidechain. Generally speaking, a sidechain is an independent blockchain that’s fettered to a parent blockchain. In this case, Bitcoin is the parent chain, while RSK is the sidechain. The sidechain extension typically features aspects that the primary chain cannot support–Ethereum folk are very familiar with functionality separation nowadays due to the multichain and modular nature of EVM-based systems. Bitcoin is naturally more isolated, with a particular focus on sustaining the so-to-speak sanctity of its chain. However, the bare bones nature of Bitcoin means that it cannot support complex applications due to limitations around programmability. So how can this system be improved? Well, Bitcoin itself ideally stays untouched. Its usage as a ledger for an incorruptible store of value is therefore preserved, but it can be complemented with a sidechain like RSK.\n\n**RSK is an EVM-compatible Bitcoin sidechain**, meaning that it is Turing complete and enables developers to construct a robust ecosystem with close proximity to the Bitcoin blockchain. Specifically, the chain uses the [RSK Virtual Machine (RVM)](https://dev.rootstock.io/rsk/architecture/), which is compatible with the EVM at the op-code level. This is precisely why Uniswap, and alike Ethereum dapps, have the ability to seamlessly deploy on RSK without significant smart contract modifications. Core Ethereum infrastructure, wallets, and tooling (Hardhat, Truffle, Ether.js, Web3.js, etc) also support RSK–so devs can easily migrate to and build on RSK while a user can simply [add RSK](https://chainlist.org/chain/30) to their already running list of chains on Metamask. But a shared execution environment is not enough of a value add. That’s where we must consider RSK’s true value proposition: shared security with Bitcoin.\n\n### Security Before All Else–Merged Mining\n\nUnlike most other blockchains, RSK employs a consensus mechanism known as merged mining, allowing miners to simultaneously secure both Bitcoin and RSK at no extra cost. This results in RSK benefiting from the formidable security and stability touted by Bitcoin. Approximately[ 50% of the current Bitcoin hashrate is involved in securing RSK](https://stats.rsk.co/). In other words, many of the same miners that provide security to Bitcoin are also securing RSK using the same hardware and energy inputs. Some of the largest Bitcoin mining pools like Antpool, Luxor, Braiins, F2Pool, and Binance Pool, have all opted into the merged mining setup.\n\n**What about previous failures surrounding merged mining like CoiledCoin?**\n* Rootstock doesn’t implement the traditional merge-mining mechanism used by CoiledCoin–but a more modern protocol with additional security guarantees. This is explained by RSK’s Chief Scientist [here. ](https://medium.com/iovlabs-innovation-stories/modern-merge-mining-f294e45101a0)An in-depth analysis can be found in the Consensus section [here](https://medium.com/iovlabs-innovation-stories/measuring-rsk-security-d169ac03b181). The infamous CoiledCoin attack was performed by a single individual (LukeJr) who could control more than 51% of the blockchain hashrate, which is impossible on Rootstock, and was ideologically motivated because CoiledCoin competed with Bitcoin, something Rootstock does not do. On the contrary, Rootstock provides additional value to Bitcoin. Rootstock talks have been given at Bitcon [conferences](https://baltichoneybadger.com/) without opposition of any kind. The same individual that attacked CoiledCoin has a positive opinion regarding Rootstock and a neutral opinion on the sidechain’s hashrate escrows.\n\n### Two-way Proof of Work Peg (PoWPeg)\n\nRootstock does not have its own token nor inflation-based incentives. The way Bitcoin and RSK are connected is via a two-way peg using $BTC. A user deposits their $BTC in the RSK bridge, which, in turn, mints the rBTC on the RSK network. Both assets will always have a 1:1 ratio, and the max amount of mintable rBTC is the same as the max BTC supply of 21M. Hence, the main asset that the entire RSK ecosystem relies on is, at the end of the day, $BTC. RSK mining rewards are paid out to miners solely through transaction fees in the form of $rBTC.\n\nTypically, if a PoW chain relies solely on rewarding its miners with txn fees, and if that chain has low volume, it would be subject to a 51% attack. This issue, however, is subverted under a shared security system like merged mining. No matter how low the volume falls, the network will remain steady because the reliance is entirely on the security of Bitcoin. Sure, one could argue Bitcoin itself could face fragility if txn fees and incentives simultaneously become too low–however, it is an unlikely case since the adoption of $BTC is so pervasive that many large parties are incentivized to secure the system even if it's at a capital loss. Plus, innovations like [inscriptions continue to sustain momentum for Bitcoin’s usage](https://messari.io/report/bitcoin-brief-runes-grayscale-and-microstrategy?referrer=research-reports).\n\n# Bitcoin Ecosystem Catalysts\n\nIf we analyze the previous points about the robust security and EVM compatibility of RSK, it’s clear how there may be an untapped market here for Uniswap to enter. Bitcoin, relative to the rest of the crypto market, is to a degree, isolated. The adoption of Bitcoin has been far more prominent around the world relative to other cryptocurrencies, even becoming [legal tender in countries like El Salvador](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/financial-services/pdf/el-salvadors-law-a-meaningful-test-for-bitcoin.pdf). The US regulatory environment, though constrictive to most cryptocurrencies, [has been significantly more amenable to Bitcoin](https://watcher.guru/news/secs-gary-gensler-says-bitcoin-is-not-a-security).\n\nIn the past year alone, Bitcoin has taken tremendous mindshare among both investors and users. A series of BTC Spot ETF filings were released in July as [Blackrock led the pack](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/spot-bitcoin-etf/). And August saw [Grayscale secure a vital victory against the SEC](https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-wins-sec-lawsuit), as the appeals court denied the SEC’s attempt to deny GBTC’s conversion to an ETF. On the user side, inscriptions dominated the Bitcoin landscape, bringing another creative use case to the seemingly latent chain. Although ordinal (non-fungible) & BRC-20 (fungible) inscription volume peaked earlier in the year, they have since sustained a large degree of their momentum, with [average daily inscription mints increasing by 48.1% in Q3](https://messari.io/report/state-of-bitcoin-q3-2023). The large Bitcoin fee uptrend can also be attributed the inscriptions rush.\n\nRSK is also taking advantage of these advancing narratives. Through [RSKIP-387](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP387.md), Bitcoin ordinals and inscriptions are looking to become available on RSK using the Powpeg bridge. In terms of projects, IOV Labs is [funding](https://rootstock.io/grants/) more than 5 ordinals-based projects that came out of the HackerEarth Ideathon + Hackathon.\n\n# Liquidity Bootstrapping\n\nRootstock will commit $3M Rootstock-based tokens in Uniswap-specific liquidity. The tokens will be deployed on Uniswap through the Rootstock integration with Oku, the funds will be provided by IOV Labs. They will work to deploy the funds as follows:\n\n* 1st Phase - Deployment: up to $400k into four liquidity pools for the following:\n  * $100k in RIF/RBTC\n  * $100k in RIF/rUSDT\n  * $100k in RBTC/rUSDT\n  * $100k in RIF/wETH\n\n* 2nd Phase - Growth: up to $1M to be distributed in the previous four liquidity pools created in the 1st Phase.\n  * The amount to be added into the liquidity pools will be decided according to the trading volume growth in a period of 3 months for each pool.\n\n* 3rd Phase - Expansion: up to $2M to be used in order to create new liquidity pools and token pairs.\n  * IOV labs will create new liquidity pools according to market demand. These new liquidity pools will be a minimum amount of $100k.\n\nThe goal is to deploy the $3M within 12 months in several phases. While the proposed limit is $3M, IOV Labs may increase this amount based on the outcome and success of this initiative.\n\nTrack active pools, TVL, volume, and fee metrics via [Oku’s RSK analytics page](https://oku.trade/info/rootstock/overview?utm_source=uniswap&utm_medium=forum&utm_campaign=rootstocktemp).\n\n# Success Criteria\n\nOverall, we propose the transparent measurement of this project’s success through the following success criteria and long-term goals:\n\n* At least a 30% increase in TVL across all initial pools during 2024, excluding the liquidity provided by IOV Labs\n* At least a 100% increase in average RSK DEX trading volume across all initial pools in the first six months after the onchain proposal\n* Successful adoption of Uniswap by the Rootstock community, aiming for a >20% increase in the number of active users by end of Q1 2024\n* Continuous and sustainable maintenance of the Uniswap-RSK integration contract, ensuring optimal operation and long-term security\n\n# Deployment Details\n\nThe approval of this proposal by Uniswap governance will lead the below Uniswap v3 contracts to be deemed as the canonical deployment on RSK. As is the case with all canonical v3 deployments, this deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3-deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended to include the reference to the stated v3 contracts on RSK.\n\n**Below are the deployed contracts:**\n\n| Contract                           | Address                                    |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| [v3CoreFactory](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0xAf37Ec98A00fD63689cF3060Bf3b6784e00CaD82)                      | 0xaF37EC98A00FD63689CF3060BF3B6784E00caD82 |\n| [nftDescriptor](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0xA231609cF5EE20B3Ff9BD8BbfD1928737e6e6264)                      | 0xA231609CF5ee20b3FF9bd8bBfD1928737E6e6264 |\n| [nonfungibleTokenPositionDescriptor](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0x1519aB9C0bf7c8F261acA6c58d59A152c95B3eBc) | 0x1519ab9C0bF7C8f261aCa6c58d59A152C95B3Ebc |\n| [nonfungibleTokenPositionManager](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0x9d9386C042f194B460ec424a1e57ACde25F5c4B1)    | 0x9d9386c042F194B460Ec424a1e57ACDE25f5C4b1 |\n| [v3Migrator](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0x16678977cA4eC3dAD5Efc7b15780295fe5F56162)                         | 0x16678977CA4ec3DAD5efc7b15780295FE5f56162 |\n| [Multicall2](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0x996a9858cdFa45aD68E47C9a30A7201E29c6A386)                         | 0x996a9858cDfa45Ad68E47c9A30a7201E29c6a386 |\n| [proxyAdmin](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0xe6c623E32eD33f29b4D7c002c01Debda629E4604)                         | 0xE6c623e32eD33f29b4D7C002C01DebDA629e4604 |\n| [tickLens](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0x55b9df5BF68ADE972191a91980459f48ECA16AFC)                           | 0x55B9dF5bF68ADe972191a91980459f48ecA16afC |\n| ​​[descriptorProxy](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0x2aeCBEE0Dc58E3419a52eEAF6ea16c498bAeE24f)                  | 0x2AECbeE0dc58e3419A52EEaF6Ea16C498BAeE24F |\n| [v3Staker](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0x96481062bFAA29AdAAEBfc5fa6f46D9556F0150c)                           | 0x96481062BfAA29AdaaeBfC5FA6F46d9556F0150c |\n| [quoterV2](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0xb51727C996c68E60f598a923A5006853Cd2fEB31)                           | 0xb51727c996C68E60F598A923a5006853cd2fEB31 |\n| [swapRouter02](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0x0B14ff67F0014046b4b99057Aec4509640b3947A)                       | 0x0B14ff67f0014046b4b99057Aec4509640b3947A |\n| [Permit2](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0xfcF5986450e4a014FFe7ad4aE24921b589D039b5)                            | 0xFcf5986450E4A014fFE7ad4Ae24921B589D039b5 |\n| [Universal Router](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0x244f68E77357f86A8522323EbF80B5FC2f814d3E)                   | 0x244f68e77357f86a8522323eBF80b5FC2F814d3E |\n| [Message Sender](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0xf5F4496219F31CDCBA6130b5402873624585615a)                     | 0xf5F4496219F31CDCBa6130B5402873624585615a |\n| [Message Receiver](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/address/0x38aE7de6f9C51e17f49cf5730dD5f2d29FA20758)                   | 0x38aE7De6f9c51e17f49cF5730DD5F2d29fa20758 |\n\n# Timeline\nThe onchain vote for this proposal will commence on the week of the 22nd, given this snapshot passes.",

      "content": "## **Summary**\n\nDespite being one of the most prominent DeFi protocols, Uniswap’s outstanding voting power does not necessarily translate into active governance participation. In fact, many top delegates with considerable voting power have less than 50% vote participation rate, and some even as low as 10% or 0%. While there have been previous [campaigns ](https://x.com/UniswapFND/status/1653077861706739714?s=20)to encourage delegation by large UNI holders, we have seen that further delegate accountability is needed as many of those who received large delegations barely participated, if at all.\n\nIn healthy governance environments, proactive delegates wield significant voting power, ensuring malicious votes are prevented and quorum requirements are met. Therefore, this proposal requests the Uniswap Foundation delegate in total 10 million UNI to 7 active yet underrepresented delegates. To ensure further accountability, each delegate must maintain a 80% participation rate at a minimum (as explained further in Participation Requirements) or is subject to undelegation via the Franchiser contract explained below. In addition, there will be a 1 year term so the community can revisit for improvements and lessons learned. And if a received delegate is removed without filling this 1 year term, the role won’t be filled.\n\n**Landscape of Uniswap Governance**\n\n![Landscape of Uniswap Governance](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/0/0b0097177837a4c734c55b0b6c6f691d3dd1c519_2_1035x684.png)\n\n*Source: Butter*\n\nDespite numerous improvements to Uniswap’s governance, there are still several areas that require further improvement. One prominent area is governance participation, which has witnessed a downward trend compared to late 2022 and early 2023.\n\nAnother issue is many large delegates are now inactive, and the delegators who entrusted them with delegation are either unaware about this inactivity or simply do not care. For example, there is currently several delegates with more than 2.5 million UNI delegated who never even voted onchain according to Tally, see the screenshot below.\n\n###\n\n![Uniswap Tally Participation](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/2/2005bd787ad5d8ce527d0d47035aaad7d6234a5f_2_1035x652.png)\n\n*Source: Tally*\n\nTherefore, further distributing governance power to active but underrepresented delegates is a positive step forward ensuring governance is more active, resilient, and robust.\n\n## **Proposal History**\n\nThe Temperature Check regarding “Delegation of UNI to Active but Underrepresented Delegates” has [passed](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x14aa7becb547ccb8fdcfc69054bda1557a90f1ebe3ac45569f049b5e29e98d76), and there was a 5-day period where delegates that met the application criteria posted their application to be considered for delegation. There were 7 qualified delegates, and there was a forum poll to decide on the UNI delegation distribution method, where a majority of qualified delegates voted for “Top 4 Delegates will get delegation till 2.5 M is achieved. The rest of UNI (out of 10 M) will be split among the rest proportional to their votes won.” Then the [Snapshot poll](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x73753f8ccab7747563b9c17a0bc746e6207991561278d7cadfaa1a7be12b081a**) to determine such distribution amount was launched.\n\n## **Proposal Details**\n\nCalculation for needed delegation amount for each and their addresses has been completed.\n\n| # | Name                  | Votes Won | Voting Power (at the time of the snapshot voting) | Needed Delegation (UNI) | Total Delegated (UNI) | Address (where UNI will be delegated to)   |\n| - | --------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |\n| 1 | 404 DAO               | 5786355   | 250000                                            | 2250000                 | 2500000               | 0xE93D59CC0bcECFD4ac204827eF67c5266079E2b5 |\n| 2 | Wintermute Governance | 5643733   | 600000                                            | 1900000                 | 2500000               | 0xB933AEe47C438f22DE0747D57fc239FE37878Dd1 |\n| 3 | PGov                  | 4744613   | 250000                                            | 2250000                 | 2500000               | 0x3fb19771947072629c8eee7995a2ef23b72d4c8a |\n| 4 | StableLab             | 4489610   | 142                                               | 2499858                 | 2500000               | 0xECC2a9240268BC7a26386ecB49E1Befca2706AC9 |\n| 5 | Keyrock               | 3252294   | 10000                                             | 493972                  | 503971.7015           | 0x1855f41B8A86e701E33199DE7C25d3e3830698ba |\n| 6 | Karpatkey             | 2980075   | 467000                                            | 452626                  | 919625.9675           | 0x8787FC2De4De95c53e5E3a4e5459247D9773ea52 |\n| 7 | atiselsts.eth         | 1010931   | 250000                                            | 153544                  | 403544.3309           | 0xAac35d953Ef23aE2E61a866ab93deA6eC0050bcD |\n\nCalculation method shared [here. 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XSsipph7GTBMS9hHFWMZxCQVyE0bZhAeADxxIDPKcpg/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## **Participation Requirements**\n\nTo ensure further accountability, each delegate must maintain a 80% participation rate at a minimum or is subject to undelegation via the Franchiser contract explained below. In addition, there will 1 year term when UNI from this initiative is delegated. so the community can revisit for improvements and lessons learned. And if a received delegate is removed without filling this 1 year term, the role won’t be filled.\n\nTo further clarify, each delegate must vote on 80% (or more) of proposals (minus the proposals that were canceled) over the last 3 months continuously. This includes both Snapshot and Onchain proposals (such as Tally or Agora).\n\n## **Technical Implementation**\n\nIn terms of technical implementation, as Erin Koen has suggested, “it will be one function call on the FranchiserFactory contract [here ](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf754A7E347F81cFdc70AF9FbCCe9Df3D826360FA). The Timelock will call the [`fundMany`](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser/blob/962079a092f4db1142473658e1650855831886c5/src/FranchiserFactory.sol#L77) function, and pass it two arrays of calldata. The first will be `[delegatees]` and the second will be `[amounts]`. The address at index 0 of the `delegatee` array receives the amount of votes at index 0 of the `amounts` array. The result of that function call will be an individual [`Franchiser`](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser/blob/main/src/Franchiser.sol) contract deployed for each delegate funded by the amount of tokens defined”\n\n“The Timelock will be the `owner` of all Franchiser contracts deployed from this vote, and can recall the tokens by calling the `recall` function (via a subsequent on-chain vote) on each contract at any time.”\n\n## **Qualified Delegates**\n\n**404 DAO**\n\n-404 DAO is a non-profit born out of Blockchain at Georgia Tech. Our team encompasses a wide range of both technical and non-technical backgrounds, from analytics and business development to cybersecurity and MEV. We seek to support the development of new applications in the Uniswap ecosystem, expanding the range of users, and accumulating value to the holders of the Uniswap governance token and relevant stakeholders. We look forward to increasing our involvement in the Uniswap DAO and are ready to take on the necessary commitment that additional voting power entails.\n\n404 DAO is also an active delegate for Arbitrum, Optimism, and dYdX. Our team is committed to transparency - our decision process, core principles, and previous work in other protocols can be found on our [governance page ](https://404-dao.notion.site/404-DAO-Governance-519af67dccd84df7b1d9dc50312fd813).\n\n**Wintermute Governance**\n\n-Ever since launching our delegate profile in January, our mission has been to actively contribute to Uniswap’s governance efficiency and growth. We’ve maintained a 100% participation rate for on-chain votes (pass all participation requirements) since our delegate launch, deployed Uni V2 on Boba and Gnosis Chain, launched [WinterGov ](https://dune.com/wintermuteresearch/wintergov), and actively provided feedback to Uniswap proposals. We’d love to continue supporting the growth of Uniswap by contributing to governance efficiency, contributing to more deployments, and would be honoured if the DAO were to empower us with greater voting power!\n\n**PGov**\n\n-As a long time Uniswap Community member of over two years, I’ve watched Uniswap governance grow into a robust and thriving ecosystem. Currently, I help with two community led initiatives here being the Uniswap-Arbitrum delegate program where we help steward the DAO’s $ARB airdrop in Arbitrum governance and the Deployment Accountability Committee.\n\nThis delegation would severely help my work on the Deployment Accountability Committee as often the question of how to submit an ecosystem’s Uniswap deployment on-chain is posed. Of course, with >2.5m delegation, we can easily propose and skip that burdensome step. Being full time now at PGov, and having led the FranklinDAO platform where I utilized our delegation to propose multiple on-chain votes, I understand how important this delegation is and will promise the community to diligently represent these votes. Thanks for your consideration!\n\n**StableLab**\n\n-StableLab is a professional delegate and governance services firm, contributing to over 20 protocols and ecosystems with exceptional diligence and participation metrics. StableLab helps DAOs scale sustainably through lean and efficient governance. We have been actively participating in Uniswap governance both via voting, forum posts, Uniswap Deployments Accountability Committee, and UNI-ARB Grant Program. And we believe that with greater governance power, we will be able to support the protocol even further by helping to encourage more accountability and discussions.\n\n**Keyrock**\n\n-As a power user of Uniswap, we’re fully aligned with Uniswap’s best interest such as multi-chain expansion and improving a fair and distributed governance participation. There is a clear miss-match of voting power and participation for some delegates so we believe this initiative will not only push the less active participants to be active but also enable more initiatives by the recipients of this delegation. If we receive this delegation, we are committed to always contribute and be active within the forums while providing our perspective and expertise in matters such as liquidity provision.\n\n**Karpatkey**\n\n-karpatkey is a DeFi-native organisation specialising in professional treasury development through industry-leading research and tooling since 2020.

My voting record demonstrates a willingness to cast dissenting votes and challenge the consensus—on occasion, I have been the sole significant negative voter, as I believe entertaining contrarian arguments are essential for sound governance.

      "title": "Delegation of UNI to Active but Underrepresented Delegates",
      "content": "**Summary**\nDespite being one of the most prominent DeFi protocols, Uniswap’s outstanding voting power does not necessarily translate into active governance participation. In fact, many top delegates with considerable voting power have less than 50% vote participation rate, and some even as low as 10% or 0%. While there have been previous [campaigns ](https://x.com/UniswapFND/status/1653077861706739714?s=20)to encourage delegation by large UNI holders, we have seen that further delegate accountability is needed as many of those who received large delegations barely participated, if at all.\n\nIn healthy governance environments, proactive delegates wield significant voting power, ensuring malicious votes are prevented and quorum requirements are met. Therefore, this proposal requests the Uniswap Foundation delegate in total 10 million UNI to 7 active yet underrepresented delegates. To ensure further accountability, each delegate must maintain a 80% participation rate at a minimum (as explained further in Participation Requirements) or is subject to undelegation via the Franchiser contract explained below. In addition, there will be a 1 year term so the community can revisit for improvements and lessons learned. And if a received delegate is removed without filling this 1 year term, the role won’t be filled.\n\n**Landscape of Uniswap Governance**\n\n[<img height=\"456\" width=\"690\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/0/0b0097177837a4c734c55b0b6c6f691d3dd1c519_2_690x456.png\" />1361×901 36.9 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/0/0b0097177837a4c734c55b0b6c6f691d3dd1c519.png)\n\n*Source: Butter*\n\nDespite numerous improvements to Uniswap’s governance, there are still several areas that require further improvement. One prominent area is governance participation, which has witnessed a downward trend compared to late 2022 and early 2023.\n\nAnother issue is many large delegates are now inactive, and the delegators who entrusted them with delegation are either unaware about this inactivity or simply do not care. For example, there is currently several delegates with more than 2.5 million UNI delegated who never even voted onchain according to Tally, see the screenshot below.\n\n###\n\n[<img height=\"435\" width=\"690\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/optimized/2X/2/2005bd787ad5d8ce527d0d47035aaad7d6234a5f_2_690x435.png\" />1600×1009 232 KB](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/2/2005bd787ad5d8ce527d0d47035aaad7d6234a5f.png)\n\n*Source: Tally*\n\nTherefore, further distributing governance power to active but underrepresented delegates is a positive step forward ensuring governance is more active, resilient, and robust.\n\n**Proposal History**\n\nThe Temperature Check regarding “Delegation of UNI to Active but Underrepresented Delegates” has [passed](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x14aa7becb547ccb8fdcfc69054bda1557a90f1ebe3ac45569f049b5e29e98d76), and there was a 5-day period where delegates that met the application criteria posted their application to be considered for delegation. There were 7 qualified delegates, and there was a forum poll to decide on the UNI delegation distribution method, where a majority of qualified delegates voted for “Top 4 Delegates will get delegation till 2.5 M is achieved. The rest of UNI (out of 10 M) will be split among the rest proportional to their votes won.” Then the [Snapshot poll](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x73753f8ccab7747563b9c17a0bc746e6207991561278d7cadfaa1a7be12b081a**) to determine such distribution amount was launched.\n\n**Proposal Details**\n\nCalculation for needed delegation amount for each and their addresses has been completed.\n\n\\#NameVotes WonVoting Power (at the time of the snapshot voting)Needed Delegation (UNI)Total Delegated (UNI)Address (where UNI will be delegated to)1404 DAO5786355250000225000025000000xE93D59CC0bcECFD4ac204827eF67c5266079E2b52Wintermute Governance5643733600000190000025000000xB933AEe47C438f22DE0747D57fc239FE37878Dd13PGov4744613250000225000025000000x3fb19771947072629c8eee7995a2ef23b72d4c8a4StableLab4489610142249985825000000xECC2a9240268BC7a26386ecB49E1Befca2706AC95Keyrock325229410000493972503971.70150x1855f41B8A86e701E33199DE7C25d3e3830698ba6Karpatkey2980075467000452626919625.96750x8787FC2De4De95c53e5E3a4e5459247D9773ea527atiselsts.eth1010931250000153544403544.33090xAac35d953Ef23aE2E61a866ab93deA6eC0050bcD\n\nCalculation method shared [here. 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XSsipph7GTBMS9hHFWMZxCQVyE0bZhAeADxxIDPKcpg/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Participation Requirements**\n\nTo ensure further accountability, each delegate must maintain a 80% participation rate at a minimum or is subject to undelegation via the Franchiser contract explained below. In addition, there will 1 year term when UNI from this initiative is delegated. so the community can revisit for improvements and lessons learned. And if a received delegate is removed without filling this 1 year term, the role won’t be filled.\n\nTo further clarify, each delegate must vote on 80% (or more) of proposals (minus the proposals that were canceled) over the last 3 months continuously. This includes both Snapshot and Onchain proposals (such as Tally or Agora).\n\n**Technical Implementation**\n\nIn terms of technical implementation, as Erin Koen has suggested, “it will be one function call on the FranchiserFactory contract [here ](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf754A7E347F81cFdc70AF9FbCCe9Df3D826360FA). The Timelock will call the [`fundMany`](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser/blob/962079a092f4db1142473658e1650855831886c5/src/FranchiserFactory.sol#L77) function, and pass it two arrays of calldata. The first will be `[delegatees]` and the second will be `[amounts]`. The address at index 0 of the `delegatee` array receives the amount of votes at index 0 of the `amounts` array. The result of that function call will be an individual [`Franchiser`](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser/blob/main/src/Franchiser.sol) contract deployed for each delegate funded by the amount of tokens defined”\n\n“The Timelock will be the `owner` of all Franchiser contracts deployed from this vote, and can recall the tokens by calling the `recall` function (via a subsequent on-chain vote) on each contract at any time.”\n\n**Qualified Delegates**\n\n**404 DAO**\n\n-404 DAO is a non-profit born out of Blockchain at Georgia Tech.

      "title": "After a Successful DAO Vote, Uniswap decided to Launch the Phase 1 of the $gUNI (Uniswap Gold) Distribution",
      "content": "Background\n- Uniswap's DAO governance is considering altering Uniswap Gold allocation rate. On December 1st, 2023, a newly approved function was implemented where 5% of swap volume fees are converted to $gUNI. $gUNI has the potential to increase swap transaction volume and reward holders, but will $UNI face market cap reduction if a derivative token supply is increased, or will the increase in bridge volume contribute to greater value for users. \n\nProposal\n- Increase $gUNI from 5% of swap fees to 7.5% swap fees to further incentive swap usage and reward the Uniswap community. Maintain $gUNI biannual rewards distribution timeline to incentive swap prioritization and bolster market sentiment. Currently, for every $1M of swap fees generated, $50,000 will be allocated to the $gUNI treasury. This proposal is suggesting to contribute $75,000 to $gUNI for every $1M of swap fees, which will later be distributed to DEX users based on wallet activity. A majority vote of 51% or greater is required for the protocol to implement this new addition. \n\nWhat is $gUNI and when is the first distribution?\n- Uniswap DAO has voted to implement $gUNI rewards for the first distribution which is live for users from December 1, 2023 to December 15, 2023. Each $UNI holder is eligibility if their wallet is older than 7 days and they have made a txn with $UNI. $gUNI distribution rate will be based on wallet solvency levels and bridge volume. \n\nIf you haven't already, check [HERE](https://uniswap-gold.org) if you are eligibility for the Phase 1 $gUNI Rewards Distribution. \n\nExecution\n- If this proposal receives a majority vote of 51% of greater, $gUNI treasury allocation rate will be increase from 5% to 7.5% to further reward swap users and hopefully increase overall swap volume. \n\nIf the new rewards allocation rate is accepted it will be implement in the 2024 Q2 distribution. \n\nDon't forget to check if you are eligible for the Phase 1 $gUNI distribution if you have been an active $UNI trader and DEX user.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeihmddsjmj4vzdl5grqdypu5lcabcljukjx6midcikwcqb6nndrifa)",

      "title": "[Temperature Check]: Competition of Delegation of UNI to Active but Underrepresented Delegates",
      "content": "*Summary*\n\nThe Temperature Check regarding “Delegation of UNI to Active but Underrepresented Delegates” has [passed](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x14aa7becb547ccb8fdcfc69054bda1557a90f1ebe3ac45569f049b5e29e98d76), and there was a 5-day period where delegates that met the application criteria posted their application to be considered for delegation.\n\nThere were 7 qualified delegates. This snapshot voting will be a voting weight poll where a delegate can distribute their voting power among qualified delegates.\n\nTop 4 Delegates will get delegation till 2.5 M is achieved. The rest of UNI (out of 10 M) will be split among the rest proportional to their votes won.\n\nDetailed example has been shared [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-delegation-of-uni-to-active-but-underrepresented-delegates/22238/21?u=doo_stablelab).\n\n-----\n\n*Qualified Delegates* (Order of when the application was posted)\n\n***Wintermute Governance***\n\n-Ever since launching our delegate profile in January, our mission has been to actively contribute to Uniswap’s governance efficiency and growth. We’ve maintained a 100% participation rate for on-chain votes (pass all participation requirements) since our delegate launch, deployed Uni V2 on Boba and Gnosis Chain, launched [WinterGov ](https://dune.com/wintermuteresearch/wintergov), and actively provided feedback to Uniswap proposals. We’d love to continue supporting the growth of Uniswap by contributing to governance efficiency, contributing to more deployments, and would be honoured if the DAO were to empower us with greater voting power!\n\n***Keyrock***\n\n-As a power user of Uniswap, we’re fully aligned with Uniswap’s best interest such as multi-chain expansion and improving a fair and distributed governance participation. There is a clear miss-match of voting power and participation for some delegates so we believe this initiative will not only push the less active participants to be active but also enable more initiatives by the recipients of this delegation. If we receive this delegation, we are committed to always contribute and be active within the forums while providing our perspective and expertise in matters such as liquidity provision.\n\n***StableLab***\n\n-StableLab is a professional delegate and governance services firm, contributing to over 20 protocols and ecosystems with exceptional diligence and participation metrics. StableLab helps DAOs scale sustainably through lean and efficient governance. We have been actively participating in Uniswap governance both via voting, forum posts, Uniswap Deployments Accountability Committee, and UNI-ARB Grant Program. And we believe that with greater governance power, we will be able to support the protocol even further by helping to encourage more accountability and discussions.\n\n***atiselsts.eth***\n\n-As an expert in Uniswap’s technical details and someone with real-world governance experience, I am well-positioned to contribute to the DAO. Without a doubt, Uniswap is among the most significant DeFi protocols, and it’s a privilege to participate in making decisions about its future. I’ve been seriously involved in DeFi governance only recently, since the delegate race this spring, but I have quickly developed a strong affinity for it, and have participated with diligence. My voting record demonstrates a willingness to cast dissenting votes and challenge the consensus—on occasion, I have been the sole significant negative voter, as I believe entertaining contrarian arguments are essential for sound governance. If I receive the support, I will increase my participation in the forums by also regularly sharing rationale for my votes in the delegate platform thread.\n\n***PGov***\n\n-As a long time Uniswap Community member of over two years, I’ve watched Uniswap governance grow into a robust and thriving ecosystem. Currently, I help with two community led initiatives here being the Uniswap-Arbitrum delegate program where we help steward the DAO’s $ARB airdrop in Arbitrum governance and the Deployment Accountability Committee.\n\nThis delegation would severely help my work on the Deployment Accountability Committee as often the question of how to submit an ecosystem’s Uniswap deployment on-chain is posed. Of course, with >2.5m delegation, we can easily propose and skip that burdensome step. Being full time now at PGov, and having led the FranklinDAO platform where I utilized our delegation to propose multiple on-chain votes, I understand how important this delegation is and will promise the community to diligently represent these votes. Thanks for your consideration!\n\n***404 DAO***\n\n-404 DAO is a non-profit born out of Blockchain at Georgia Tech. Our team encompasses a wide range of both technical and non-technical backgrounds, from analytics and business development to cybersecurity and MEV. We seek to support the development of new applications in the Uniswap ecosystem, expanding the range of users, and accumulating value to the holders of the Uniswap governance token and relevant stakeholders. We look forward to increasing our involvement in the Uniswap DAO and are ready to take on the necessary commitment that additional voting power entails.\n\n404 DAO is also an active delegate for Arbitrum, Optimism, and dYdX. Our team is committed to transparency - our decision process, core principles, and previous work in other protocols can be found on our [governance page ](https://404-dao.notion.site/404-DAO-Governance-519af67dccd84df7b1d9dc50312fd813).\n\n***Karpatkey***\n\n-karpatkey is a DeFi-native organisation specialising in professional treasury development through industry-leading research and tooling since 2020. We work with DAOs such as [GnosisDAO ](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkeys-weekly-report-on-gnosisdao-farms/6219), [Balancer](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/karpatkey-s-weekly-report-on-balancerdao-farms/4386), [ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-weekly-reports/16665), [CoW Protocol](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cow-treasury-report-for-march-2023/1624https://forum.cow.fi/t/cow-treasury-report-for-march-2023/1624), and [Lido](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xac31f800288c68e32d1eb3cea7a525022faae3eb3bf805d1b3d248cda5375a13) to diversify their treasuries into sustainable portfolios of DeFi investments designed to support the DAOs in their missions.\n\nWe launched our delegate platform on Uniswap in August 2023, and have been thoughtfully participating in voting and discussions over the past three month. We are also proud to have participated in the inaugural [Blessing](https://twitter.com/devinawalsh/status/1704910042028503044) sponsored by the Uniswap Foundation and focused on the Uniswap ecosystem and governance.\n\n\n----\n\n*Next Steps*\n\nAfter this proposal is concluded, each delegate's delegation from this program will be calculated, and it will eventually proceed to an onchain vote.",

      "title": "Deploy Uniswap V3 on Scroll",
      "content": "After a successful temperature check as well as deployments of Uniswap\nV3 on both our Alpha and Sepolia testnets, Scroll looks to move towards a final\ngovernance proposal to officially approve Scroll’s Uniswap V3 deployment on its newly\nlaunched mainnet.\n\nThe [temperature check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xc874c15656ac985df2f34d4438f8d074226f10408dd74f08295227974179b2c1) passed with 28M (100%) YES votes in August.\n\n**Point of Contact:** \\[Shahryar Hasnani, E-mail: shahryar@scroll.io]\n\n## **Proposal Overview**\n\nWe propose that the Uniswap DAO recognizes Scroll’s mainnet deployment of Uniswap\nV3 as the official - canonical deployment. Uniswap V3 has already been deployed and\nhighly utilized on Scroll’s Alpha and Sepolia testnets, with the router contract having\nprocessed over 1.8M and 450K transactions on each testnet, respectively. A brief\noverview of Scroll:\n\n* Scroll is a bytecode-compatible zk-rollup, a native zkEVM scaling solution for Ethereum.\n* Scroll is an open-source project developed in collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation Privacy and Scaling Explorations organization. It was built [with the community, for the community.](https://github.com/scroll-tech)\n* [Our community ethos and vision](https://scroll.io/story) are aligned with Ethereum. We are committed to a secure, decentralized, censorship-resistant, and efficient future that Ethereum offers through our plans to decentralize Scroll sequencers and provers.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nWe believe that Uniswap being deployed on multiple Ethereum L2s is integral for encouraging competition and diversity of technical solutions to scale Ethereum. Furthermore, we believe that Uniswap’s community and the ecosystem that Scroll strives for are closely aligned. Both projects are building trustless, decentralized, and secure financial infrastructure that is accessible to anyone, regardless of merit or location. Deploying to Scroll offers many benefits, including significant user savings, an expanded user base, capturing the zkEVM market, and fostering L2 native innovation. The endgame of Ethereum and its L2s will be fundamentally underpinned by ZK— this deployment puts Uniswap in the best position to capitalize on the future of the EVM ecosystem by integrating with the most Ethereum-aligned and future-proof L2. Uniswap on Scroll will integrate closely with Scroll’s rapidly growing ecosystem. Dozens of projects have committed to deploying on our mainnet, and over 150 have deployed on our testnets, including AAVE, Lens, the Graph, Covalent, Safe, and Etherscan to name a few. Given the excitement around Scroll and current usage of our testnet, we expect hundreds of projects to deploy on our mainnet post-launch. Importantly, Uniswap on Scroll will propel L2 DEX innovation. We are on the brink of uncovering L2 native use cases that have not been feasible on Ethereum L1. Scroll will bring new developers and ecosystem integrations to Uniswap.\n\n## **Partner Details**\n\n**Scroll**\n\nThis proposal and the deployment of Uniswap contracts will be performed by the Scroll\nFoundation, a foundation registered in the Republic of Seychelles.\n\n**Delegate Sponsor**\n\nIn addition, Scroll is working with the [Michigan Blockchain](https://twitter.com/UMichBlockchain), which will act as the\ndelegate sponsor for this proposal.\n\n* ***Proposers:*** Scroll Foundation\n* ***Proposal Sponsor:*** Michigan Blockchain\n* ***Deployer:*** Scroll Foundation\n* ***Bridge Provider:*** Scroll Native Bridge\n\n**Conflict of Interest Declaration**\n\nThere are no existing financial or contractual relationships between Scroll and any of Uniswap’s legal entities, including Uniswap Labs, UNI DAO & Foundation, nor investments of Uniswap Labs Ventures.\n\n## **Additional information for cross-chain deployments**\n\nOur focus has always been on providing the best possible experience for developers, and we have successfully delivered on this promise on our testnet, which we will continue to do on mainnet. We are proud to say that we are bytecode-compatible, meaning that migrating dapps from any EVM chain is easy and hassle-free.\n\n**EVM-equivalent:** Scroll uses a forked version of Geth, enabling seamless infrastructure migration. Any application can be migrated to Scroll without code changes and additional audits.\n\n**Developer friendly:** Scroll will support all existing development tools, including debuggers. Developers can work with a familiar development environment. No bytecode re-audits will be required minimizing the risk surface tremendously.\n\n**Security:** Scroll inherits most of EVM’s features and security, which is by far the most battle-tested smart contract infrastructure in the entire space.\n\n**Decentralization:** Scroll is leading the way in developing a decentralized prover network and has already committed to outsourcing proving. By decentralizing proof generation to the community, Scroll can achieve efficient proof generation and establish a more robust ecosystem.\n\nWe have always been committed to building in the open, starting from our collaboration with EF’s PSE team, and we remain closely connected to the Ethereum community—in fact, our team has contributed [~50% of the upstream PSE zkEVM codebase over the past two years](https://twitter.com/pseudotheos/status/1664249089998077960). Furthermore, we have been open source from day 1, have a strong in- house security team paired with rigorous audits, and are aiming to have third-party provers upon our mainnet genesis block and a gradual decentralization of our sequencer network.\n\nThe Scroll community has been testing the Uniswap V3 deployment on [Scroll’s testnets](https://sepolia-blockscout.scroll.io/) for months, often exceeding 200,000 transactions per day - more than many other L2s. In fact, our testnet community has successfully processed over 1.8M transactions through the Uniswap V3 router on our Alpha Testnet over 450k transactions on our Sepolia Testnet already.\n\n## Protocol Security\n\nZK-Rollups are currently the most secure Layer 2 scaling solution. On the premise of inheriting the security of Ethereum, it relies exclusively on cryptography rather than unreliable crypto-economics.\n\nScroll has a trustless Layer 1 <> Layer 2 canonical bridge, which supports arbitrary message delivery. The bridge is part of the roll-up mechanism, verified by the smart contract and the zkEVM, which is much more secure than relayer-based bridges.\n\nSecurity is the first priority for us. Scroll implements the EVM, which is well-specified and battle-tested, as well as the well-established and researched Halo2 cryptographic library. [Additionally, we have zkEVM circuit audits from Trail of Bits, Zellic, and KALOS; Bridge and rollup contracts audits from OpenZeppelin and Zellic; and Node implementation audits from Trail of Bits. We also have a bug bounty on ImmuneFi with a maximum reward of $1M.](https://scroll.io/blog/scrolls-security-measures) And finally, we have an in-house security team that continuously reviews our codebase.\n\nWe are launching with a timelock delay for contract and admin upgrades, and soon plan to establish a security council to control privileged functions and contract upgrades.\n\nFinally, in a continuous process after mainnet launch, we will be working on developing decentralized sequencers and provers in an effort to secure and reduce the trust assumptions of using the network.\n\n## **Success Criteria**\n\nDeployment of Uniswap on Scroll will:\n\n* Increase Uniswap TVL\n* Grow Uniswap order volume\n* Enable listing of new assets on Uniswap that are unique to Scroll\n* Allow Uniswap to benefit from exposure to cutting-edge ZK technology and applications on Scroll (e.g., potential new functionality, projects to provide grants to, etc.)\n\nThe best way to measure success for Uniswap on Scroll is to focus on TVL and transaction volumes; however, there are a variety of other benefits Scroll will bring, such as onboarding its dedicated and expanding developer community to Uniswap, thereby boosting the growth of Uniswap’s developer community—this is also a critical success criteria.\n\n## Deployment Details\n\nThe approval of this proposal by Uniswap governance will lead the stated Uniswap v3 contracts to be deemed as the canonical deployment on Scroll. As is the case with all canonical v3 deployments, this deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. \n\n**Main Contracts**\n\n* [Core Factory 2](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x70c62c8b8e801124a4aa81ce07b637a3e83cb919): `0x70C62C8b8e801124A4Aa81ce07b637A3e83cb919`\n* [NFT Position Manager](https://scrollscan.com/address/0xb39002e4033b162fac607fc3471e205fa2ae5967): `0xB39002E4033b162fAc607fc3471E205FA2aE5967`\n* [Router 2](https://scrollscan.com/address/0xfc30937f5cDe93Df8d48aCAF7e6f5D8D8A31F636): `0xfc30937f5cDe93Df8d48aCAF7e6f5D8D8A31F636`\n\n**Additional Contracts**\n\n* [multicall2Address](https://scrollscan.com/address/0xC1D2e074C38FdD5CA965000668420C80316F0915): `0xC1D2e074C38FdD5CA965000668420C80316F0915`\n* [proxyAdminAddress](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x1E6dcAb806A42055098f23E2B3ac72D6E195F967): `0x1E6dcAb806A42055098f23E2B3ac72D6E195F967`\n* [tickLensAddress](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x85780e12e90D2a684eB8E7404c985b5B5c8ce7E9): `0x85780e12e90D2a684eB8E7404c985b5B5c8ce7E9`\n* [nftDescriptorLibraryAddressV1\\_3\\_0](https://scrollscan.com/address/0xAeE9c206ba89F3DA25EEe4636208519e0B86965B): `0xAeE9c206ba89F3DA25EEe4636208519e0B86965B`\n* [nonfungibleTokenPositionDescriptorAddressV1\\_3\\_0 1](https://scrollscan.com/address/0xaccf12204b7591b2eccefe737440b0f53748b191): `0xACcf12204b7591B2ECCEFe737440B0f53748B191`\n* [descriptorProxyAddress 1](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x675DD953225D296A44790dC1390a1E7eF378f464): `0x675DD953225D296A44790dC1390a1E7eF378f464`\n* [v3MigratorAddress](https://scrollscan.com/address/0xF00577B5Dd0DA227298E954Ed11356F264Cf93d4): `0xF00577B5Dd0DA227298E954Ed11356F264Cf93d4`\n* [v3StakerAddress 1](https://scrollscan.com/address/0xfdfbe973c9ecb036ecfb7af697fcace789d3f928): `0xFdFbE973c9ecB036Ecfb7af697FcACe789D3f928`\n* [quoterV2Address 1](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x2566e082Cb1656d22BCbe5644F5b997D194b5299): `0x2566e082Cb1656d22BCbe5644F5b997D194b5299`\n\n## Timeline\n\nThe temperature check has passed, and the relevant Uniswap v3 contracts have been deployed on Scroll.

While there have been previous [campaigns ](https://x.com/UniswapFND/status/1653077861706739714?s=20) to encourage delegation by large UNI holders, we have seen that further delegate accountability is needed as many of those who received large delegations barely participated, if at all.\n\nIn healthy governance environments, proactive delegates wield significant voting power, ensuring malicious votes are prevented and quorum requirements are met.\n\nTherefore, this proposal requests the Uniswap Foundation delegate 2.5 million UNI to each of 4 active yet underrepresented delegates selected based on the criteria outlined below. To ensure further accountability, each delegate must maintain a 80% participation rate at a minimum (as explained further in Participation Requirements) or is subject to undelegation via the Franchiser contract explained below.

Unlike any other traditional bank, we have completely abandoned servers, with all banking logics run by smart contracts, and our clients being identified via their Fiat24 NFT. You might imagine us as an additional fiat layer for DEXs, such as Uniswap. In fact, clients can not only top-up their Swiss bank accounts via international money transfer, but also by selling their crypto assets. All crypto tokens go through Uniswap and are converted to stabelcoins before arriving in our treasury, meaning that Uniswap is our liquidity provider.\n\nWe are directly connected with the Swiss National Bank, European Central Bank, and Visa Payment Network, and all real-world payment data, which is all booked on Arbitrum. Since we are a bank that is fully run by protocols, you can easily access your Swiss e-banking portal directly inside your non-custodial crypto wallet (such as MetaMask or Uniswap Wallet) by using this link http://www.fiat24.com\n\n**Motivation & Benefits to Uniswap Community & Growth**\n\nAccording to DeFi Llama the daily trading volume of Uniswap is more than 600M. That is a huge number, but compared to the daily trading volume of global Forex (7.5 trillion), it is still low. In fact, Uniswap will have much more potential if it could be involved in mainstream, traditional finance transactions. We can imagine that, one day, there won’t only be ETH/USDT pools on Uniswap, but also real USD/Japanese Yen pools.\n\nFiat24 can contribute and help take a small step in this direction.\n\nFiat24 is a Swiss licensed financial institution and we open Swiss offshore bank accounts for our clients. The account can be topped up not only via international money transfer, but also by selling cryptos. However, any cryptocurrency goes through Uniswap and is then converted into USDC. We also issue a Visa debit card. All card transactions are booked on the blockchain (Arbitrum).\n\nSince day one of Fiat24, Uniswap has been our sole liquidity provider. We are not connected to any centralized liquidity providers (such as Kraken, Coinbase, Bitstamp, etc.), but rather rely fully on Uniswap. In this way, Uniswap is a strategic and indispensable part of our entire infrastructure. To this effect, we plan to issue a co-branded Visa card with the Uniswap community in order to show our appreciation.\n\n\n**Specifications**\n\nThe Visa card is available for residents of 27 European Union countries, but we are expanding our geographical coverage. By the time this is approved, we expect to be able to serve also South East Asian and Latin American countries.\n\nThe card is denominated in Euros, and can be added into Apple Pay and Google Pay. It can be used for online and real-world purchases.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\n\nThere is no effort or cost for the Uniswap DAO. We cover all the labor and related costs.\n\nOnce the proposal has been approved, we would appreciate an official announcement from the Uniswap DAO (e.g. X).\n\n**Timeline**\n\nAs soon as this proposal has successfully passed all the necessary steps and been approved by the community, we will be able to make the Uniswap Visa debit card available within 2 weeks.\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/fiat24account\nhttps://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-issue-a-visa-card-with-uniswap-logo/22125",

      "content": "# Governance Proposal Updates\n\n- As discussed below, we are requesting $46.2M of UNI. Using a 30 day TWAP price of UNI of $4.32342, this equates to a request for 10,685,984.71 UNI. \n- Simulated results of this proposal passing will be available [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/governance-seatbelt/actions) by navigating to the latest successful Governance Check workflow and downloading the Uniswap artifact at the bottom of the page.\n\n# Temp Check Updates\n\n**Temp Check Snapshot [here](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xae0ff2f4cb4c1d292f7bf7c4c4bf7f4046be89518a0c7cbce65d658f2d36f20f)**\n\nLast Wednesday we posted in the [forum](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-complete-initial-funding-of-the-uniswap-foundation/21956) to complete the initial funding of the UF. Since then we’ve been having really great, thorough discussions with delegates -- hearing your comments, answering questions, and receiving feedback.\n\nBased on that feedback, we are making a few changes to our proposal. These are covered in the bullets below, and updated throughout our proposal.\n\n1. We have adjusted our request to reflect 2 years of operating and grants runway, with the 10% buffer to mitigate price risk. Our request is now **$46.2M**.\n\n* We break down how this funding will be used in the post below.\n* With this runway we anticipate we will return to governance for additional funding when we have approximately 1 year of runway left, in Q4 2024/ Q1 2025.\n\n2. We will **retain** the need to receive governance approval via an off-chain vote for grants larger than $2M.\n3. We have also heard feedback around the governance process being followed with this proposal. In our initial proposal, we had stated that, after approval, we would [move directly to an on-chain vote](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17499#fund-disbursements-12) for our receipt of our second tranche of funding. However, we have heard a desire from the community for the UF to follow the [complete governance process](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/community-governance-process-update-jan-2023/19976) here. We are happy to do that, particularly considering these additional changes.\n\n* We will consider last week’s post to be our [RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-complete-initial-funding-of-the-uniswap-foundation/21956/15).\n* This post will be our Temperature Check. The Temp Check Snapshot is [here](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xae0ff2f4cb4c1d292f7bf7c4c4bf7f4046be89518a0c7cbce65d658f2d36f20f). \n* Once the Temperature Check has been completed, we will kick off the final governance vote next week.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Our vision is for Uniswap to be the liquidity layer of a self-sovereign Internet, a permissionless alternative to the gated, intermediary-owned exchanges of traditional finance. To get there, the UF is building and supporting **a robust ecosystem to grow, improve, and sustain the Uniswap Protocol for the long term.**\n* Last year, Uniswap governance [approved](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17499#fund-disbursements-12) the creation and initial funding of the Uniswap Foundation. Today we are requesting the remainder of our initial funding to support our next 2 years of work ($46.2M).\n* We hosted a Twitter Spaces to discuss our RFC and answer questions on Monday, October 2 (link [here](https://twitter.com/UniswapFND/status/1708873305808044142)).\n* In this post we’re also providing the community with:\n  * A review of the UF’s progress over the last year: the team we have built, the grants we have disbursed and programs we’ve run, and their impact.\n  * A look to the future: what is our vision for the UF, and what is coming next?\n* We are kicking off our Temperature Check vote today, and will kick off our on-chain governance vote next week.\n\n# UF Vision\n\nUniswap is critical infrastructure for a self-sovereign Internet, providing the liquidity layer for a flourishing world of tokens representing governance participation, community membership, the ability to participate in protocols, “real world” assets and more. It is critical financial infrastructure - providing a permissionless, credibly neutral alternative to the NYSE or SWIFT. It is an enabler of entrepreneurship, providing a liquidity platform for builders creating protocols and applications around the world.\n\nWe founded the Uniswap Foundation because we want to ensure that Uniswap is accessible for anyone in the world to leverage as permissionless financial and technological infrastructure for a long time.\n\nHow do we make that happen? **A robust, diverse, and values-aligned ecosystem.**\n\n**A strong ecosystem is a competitive edge.** It expands a Protocol’s accessibility, increases its resiliency, and enables it to thrive in the face of ruthless competitive and market environments. It means more product and engineering talent driving the Protocol forward, into new markets with better user experience. It means values-aligned delegates who are able to thoughtfully weigh the tradeoffs of governance proposals. It means more serendipity, collaboration, and inspiration.\n\nLooking across the crypto landscape it’s easy to see ecosystem strength as a competitive advantage. Ethereum is probably the best example. If Consensys and Ethereum’s earliest contributors were still the only teams building on and for Ethereum, it is easy to see a world where almost none of us would be here. Instead, Ethereum is one of the best places to build blockchain-based protocols and applications.\n\n**The UF is building the Uniswap ecosystem.**\n\n**How are we doing that exactly?**\n\n**1. Growing core Protocol metrics, specifically driving net new order flow to strengthen the Protocol flywheel.**\n\n* Over the next year, this looks like the development of a robust hooks development platform which broadens the pipeline of developers onto Uniswap and diversifies the kinds of things Uniswap is able to do.\n* In the long term, this is 100ks+ of hook and application developers speaking to different use cases (crypto-native to RWA, building new financial primitives) and users globally, all while being able to generate a return for themselves.\n\n**2. Building a pipeline for innovation on the Protocol, with the goal of enhancing the experience of swappers and LPs.**\n\n * Over the next year, this means launching the [TL;DR Fellowship](https://www.tldresear.ch/) and Conference, and creating working groups to apply cutting-edge research across MEV and other relevant areas directly to Uniswap.\n * In the long term, this means Uniswap is the default home for the world’s top crypto/DeFi researchers and academics to build POCs and iterate upon mechanisms to improve the experience of key DeFi stakeholders.\n\n**3. Aligning incentives for stakeholders with long-term interests of the Protocol, turning Uniswap into a cockroach.**\n\n * Over the short term, this means two things: the development of realistic mechanisms to effectively capture Protocol value created and distribute it to stakeholders, and bringing stakeholders together to build trust and context IRL.\n * In the long term, this means the alignment of long-term interests of core stakeholder teams with the Protocol to weather future volatility and competition.\n\nThis approach will serve to increase Uniswap’s moat over time while ensuring it can adapt as tides change.\n\nBelow, we discuss what we’ve done so far, and how we plan to accomplish our goals in the future. Thank you for your support, as always. We wouldn’t be here without you. We’re grateful to have the opportunity to work with you in the coming years.\n\n# Update: One Year In\n\nBelow, we provide a summary of what the UF Grants program and our team directly has accomplished over the last year.\n\n## Grants\n\n**Growth**\n\n* Launch of [Oku Trade](https://oku.trade/) alongside Oku [API](https://oku.trade/api): a pro-trader interface accompanied by an API providing comprehensive real-time historical data across pools, swaps, positions, and more. [Oku Analytics](https://twitter.com/getty_hill/status/1702054215630078266), which will offer truly-real-time data across all chains it supports, will be launching soon.\n  * Since launching in July, Oku Trade has had 3k unique wallet connections, and 56k unique site visitors.\n  * Two projects, [Unispark](https://unispark.metacrypt.org/) and [UniChat](https://unichat.fn03.xyz/), have launched on top of the Oku API thus far.\n  * Oku also plays a key role in Uniswap Protocol’s multi-chain expansion. By the end of the year they plan to support 10 chains. This includes chains like Boba and Moonbeam which otherwise would not have interface support.\n* Partnership with [Gauntlet](https://twitter.com/gauntlet_xyz): UF’s year-long engagement with Gauntlet is focused on R&D into approaches to optimize incentive programs and fee design. We highlight some of their most interesting work [here](https://twitter.com/UniswapFND/status/1703837131163197479). They are building a Dynamic Incentive Optimization engine for community use to be released later this year.\n* Hackathon sponsorship: We’ve partnered with ETHGlobal, Binance, and Arrakis to sponsor 3 hackathons (and 1 Hookathon) which have brought 150+ new projects and 200+ new developers into the ecosystem.\n* Launch of the [Developer Ambassadors Program](https://uniswapfoundation.mirror.xyz/CfBq3TFcJG638hySx0ttu_HRDcNS7BMkQ2oQ0JrXqII): Our Ambassadors have started a [podcast](https://twitter.com/adamtj_eth/status/1683579698192826368) and deployed [UniChat](https://twitter.com/aiden0x4/status/1676992842152177664), a tool which leverages the Oku API and OpenAI to allow users to search Uniswap data using plain text.\n* Enhancements to Uniswap v3 SDK - [Koray](https://twitter.com/koraykoska) and Florian are enhancing the SDK for a broader swath of developers and use cases, and making the code for liquidity management easier to use. They are on track to finish their work in November 2023.\n* Support for new tools and research for Liquidity Providers, including the development of [Chaos Labs Strategy Simulator](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/uniswap/lp-strategy-calculator) and the [Messari LP Portal](https://messari.io/data-apps/uniswap-v3-lp-tool), as well as research on Advanced LP Strategies for Uniswap v3 conducted by [Atis Elsts](https://atise.medium.com/liquidity-provider-strategies-for-uniswap-v3-table-of-contents-64725c6c0b10) and [Vasily Tolstikov](https://medium.com/@med456789d).\n* [Uniswap v3 Development Course](https://uniswapv3book.com/): a free, open-source Uniswap v3 Development Course that serves as a fundamental guide for developers, attracting 12,000 monthly visitors..\n\n**Innovation**\n\n* Launch of [TL;DR Research Institute](https://www.tldresear.ch/): a first of its kind DeFi-focused Research Institute led by a council of Defi’s leading researchers. The Institute will fund grants to and provide mentorship for fellows studying MEV, mechanism design, ZK, and more, and result in a DeFi Research Conference in the Spring. For its first fellowship, starting in October 2023, TL;DR received 107 applications from around the world.\n* Industry-leading research on [Cross-chain MEV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04159) -- which has led in turn to a specification for a [Proof of Concept (POC) MEV protection hook](https://ethresear.ch/t/lvr-minimization-in-uniswap-v4/15900)\n* Novel research and implementations across a number of areas, including [Lanturn](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1338.pdf) (Measuring Economic Security of Smart Contracts through Adaptive Learning), [Chaos Labs TWAP Market Risk application](https://chaoslabs.xyz/posts/chaos-labs-uniswap-v3-twap-market-risk), [Axiom’s Checkpoint-free TWAP oracles](https://www.axiom.xyz/blog/uniswap), and research on [Pricing Nontoxic Orderflow](https://mirror.xyz/xenophonlabs.eth/EmgwRVmCc8Utvu6DmacS7dVGSl8ufkCss644z31z87I).\n\n**Governance & Community**\n\n* [Uniswap Agora](https://vote.uniswapfoundation.org/) and the Uniswap Delegate Race - [over 65 new delegates](https://twitter.com/UniswapFND/status/1665052818934251520) made new profiles (to compare, only 35 delegates have posted statement to the governance forum in the last 3 years)\n* [Uniswap Cross-chain Bridge Report](https://uniswap.notion.site/Bridge-Assessment-Report-0c8477afadce425abac9c0bd175ca382) - A team of 8 produced a comprehensive analysis into the cross-chain requirements for Uniswap’s cross-chain governance use case, and an accompanying assessment of 9 bridges.\n\n## UF Team\n\nFirst, we want to provide an overview of our team:\n\n[Devin Walsh](https://twitter.com/devinawalsh), Executive Director & UF Co-Founder\n\n[Ken Ng](https://twitter.com/nkennethk), Applied Research & UF Co-Founder\n\n[Elika Mahdavi](https://twitter.com/ElikaMahdavi), COO\n\n[Raphaela Sapire](https://twitter.com/RaffiSapire), Head of Growth\n\n[Tyllen Bicakcic](https://twitter.com/0xTyllen), Head of Developer Relations\n\n[Erin Koen](https://twitter.com/eek637), Head of Governance\n\n[Federico Landini](https://twitter.com/fedeebasta), Grants Manager\n\nWe’re also grateful to work with a number of contributors who are making an outsized impact.\n\n[Ben Basche](https://twitter.com/basche42), Hooks Strategy\n\n[Bethany Crystal](https://twitter.com/bethanymarz), Grants Strategy\n\n[YJ](https://twitter.com/yj_alt), Grants Committee\n\n[Leander Capuozzo](https://twitter.com/leandercapuozzo), Brand Experience\n\nJuliet Chung, Grants Administration\n\nBelow I want to summarize some of the work our team has done outside of grants:\n\n**Growth & Innovation**\n\n* Interviews with dozens of builders within the Uniswap ecosystem to develop a strategy to create and support a strong Hooks ecosystem for v4. Thus far we’ve also kicked off and are moderating an active Hook Dojo Telegram chat for 150+ hook developers, have hosted a [Hookathon](https://twitter.com/UniswapFND/status/1683983199872122881) at ETHcc, [Tacklebox Talks](https://twitter.com/devinawalsh/status/1705627482815148183) at ETHNYC, and are building v4 [documentation](https://docs.uniswapfoundation.org/hooks/dev-resources), with the community’s support.\n* Building the [TL;DR Research Council](https://www.tldresear.ch/), and designing the Fellowship based on their unique insights. Over the coming months, our team will coordinate and run the first TL;DR Conference.\n* Our team has coordinated and ran multiple hackathons, providing hands-on support to 100s of hackers.\n\n**Governance**\n\n* Organizing the Delegate Race with Agora and our first [Blessing](https://twitter.com/eek637/status/1705328971892539575), a governance-focused event for delegates to build knowledge, context, and community.\n* Assist in the governance process from writing forum posts, to educating delegates and rallying votes, to writing the code, sometimes debugging the code, and validating the proposal outcome.\n* In our original proposal, we [requested](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17499#governance-participation-13) that Uniswap Governance delegate 2.5M UNI to the UF so that we could re-delegate to community members without enough UNI to submit a governance proposal. Since then we have delegated UNI to several individuals (or used it ourselves) to post the following proposals:\n\n1. [Bharat.eth](https://twitter.com/bharat_eth), [Fix the Cross Chain Messaging Bridge on Arbitrum](https://vote.uniswapfoundation.org/proposals/29)\n2. [0XPlasma.eth](https://twitter.com/0xPlasma), [Deploy Uniswap V3 on BNB Chain](https://vote.uniswapfoundation.org/proposals/31)\n3.

We will fund high leverage hooks, including MEV mitigation hooks and hooks which increase LP profitability and experience. We’re also looking to accelerate the hook discovery and routing stack; create a hook launch playbook, and more. (Some of these grants may come in 2024). We’re also sponsoring more hackathons with hooks-related educational events for ETH Istanbul/Devconnect.\n* **Launch the TL;DR Fellowship in October 2023.**\n* **Continue IRL Delegate events and build more digital ways to connect.** We will host a second Blessing event at ETH Istanbul/Devconnect, and are working towards creating more ways for delegates to connect and educate themselves.\n* Lay the groundwork for some of the big programs we’re excited to launch in 2024.\n\n**Into 2024 and beyond, we want to offer insight into how we’re thinking about achieving our big goals.**\n\n1. **In the realm of growth, we’re building an ecosystem of 100ks+ of hook and application developers speaking to different use cases and users globally.** This includes:\n\n*  **Driving adoption of v4 as we continue to build the hooks platform.** Supporting liquidity migration to v4, the addition of net new liquidity and volume through novel hook development, continuing to fund hook developer content and tooling, and sponsor hookathons.\n* **Broadening our pipeline of contributing teams through partnerships and multi-milestone grants with industry-leading organizations.** This might include curriculum development and hackathons to upskill new devs, or web3 onboarding for web2 engineers.\n * **Expanding our grantee support system** through more dedicated grantee relationship management and marketing support.\n * **Creating a studio** to incubate early founders building novel interfaces and applications.\n\n2. **In the realm of innovation, we’re building a pipeline for the world’s top crypto/DeFi researchers to build POCs and iterate upon mechanisms to improve the experience of key DeFi stakeholders on Uniswap.**\n\n* **Launching the TL;DR Conference in Q2 2024** and continuing to support the Institute’s growth.\n*  **Building working groups of researchers and engineers** to ideate upon and build novel POCs to mitigate some of the protocol’s most pressing challenges and expand the protocol surface area, for instance redistribution of MEV profits and on-chain RFQ systems.\n\n3. **In the realm of governance, we’re working towards an alignment of interests between stakeholders and the Protocol, turning Uniswap into a cockroach.**\n\n* **Continuing to support digital and IRL governance platforms** and events to support delegates in building community and context.\n * **Supporting initiatives to create and distribute Protocol value to stakeholders** with community-led teams designing and implementing new ways to accrue and capture value for the Protocol, as well as mechanisms for value distribution.\n\n# Request Breakdown\n\nWe are requesting **$46.2M** in funds today.\n\nThis funding will last provide the UF with 2 years of runway. In total, $28.33M will go towards grants, and $13.6M ($11.4M and 508k UNI) will be spent on operations over this timeframe. We have added a 10% buffer to mitigate price volatility. On the day we post the governance proposal, we will request our funds in UNI, using 30-day-TWAP to convert our request.\n\n# Financials\n\n## Historical\n\nGrants\n\n* Over the last year, the UF awarded $4.8M in grants across 5 categories, with the majority of grants being awarded to the Protocol Growth and R&D categories. We awarded our largest grant of $1.6M, to Oku Trade & API, shortly after UF launch. In our most recent quarter, we slowed down grant-making after the Uniswap v4 announcement. We shifted focus from making grants to Uniswap v3-focused projects to building our GTM and funding strategy for v4.\n* Note that in addition to the $4.8M in grants commitments by the UF, the UF also inherited $886k of active UGP grants, which the UF disbursed over the last year. Total grants commitments including both UF and UGP grants totaled ~$5.7M.\n\n![|662x211](upload://1oEyyVmt3a42jrVKMSbCjweIa83.png)\n\n![|665x67](upload://r5eNzpGRt4CQJ84q9g7tDe1ubfV.png)\n\n**Operations**\n\n* Over the last year, we spent $3.15M on operations. This is on target with the [$3.24M we predicted](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17358#budget-11) we would require for our first year of Operations in our initial proposal, with the following caveats:\n  * We note that the $289K cost of the [Uniswap Cross-chain Bridge Assessment Process](https://uniswapfoundation.mirror.xyz/RM7VRw1TLrZPio0G7QgiS2q-kooo8D65zNihK_2NlDc), the outputs of which were published to the public, was covered by our Ops budget due to the urgent nature of this work in Q1 and Q2 2023.\n  * Our first employees hit their cliffs for UNI vesting in July. We disburse vesting on a quarterly basis, so the first disbursement will occur on October 1st.\n* Our largest expenses were Payroll and Legal costs. Over the last year our Legal fees included costs to setup and receive our 501(c)(4) status; costs of defense in the [Risley class action lawsuit](https://decrypt.co/154312/uniswap-lawsuit-dismissed-defi-crypto-exchange-not-liable-for-scam-tokens); advisory work for team on how to effectively operate in an unstable regulatory environment; and advisory work to guide the UF’s work in supporting the Uniswap community, for example in our work to provide education and guidance related to the protocol fee switch.\n\n![|650x183](upload://kMLQZaFwxU4FhcIkm1Q8PCRoQ4Y.png)\n\n## Forecast\n\n**Grants**\n\nWith the addition of funds, the UF will have **$30M** outstanding in grants capital remaining to disburse.\n\n* We plan to disburse $10-$15M per year, with the amount disbursed per year increasing over time. We note that we are allocating a portion of the Innovation budget (up to $9M) towards designing and testing novel incentive mechanisms. We note this because it’s likely these funds will be disbursed all at once in an MVP of a program.\n* We’ve recalibrated our grants categories and allocation budgets to focus on Grantee stakeholder groups.\n\n![|616x197](upload://wZfSIeEtlojEzJDqiqfNESYo2IL.png)\n\n**Projected Team Growth**\n\nOver the next year, we plan to grow our Growth & Research, Grants, and Technology teams in order to realize our goals. Specifically, we plan to:\n\n* Hire 2 individuals in Growth & Research to support our ongoing efforts, and to grow our expertise in the R&D efforts we are funding.\n* Hire 2 individuals on our Grants Team, including a Grants Lead.\n* Hire 2 individuals on our Technology team, one to support ongoing Product development grants and one to support Developer Relations.\n* Hire an Executive Assistant to support our teams’ internal operations.\n* In FY2025, we anticipate hiring up to 2 additional team members.\n\n![|343x143](upload://1HSkSiBPrvoiLarjrnHLYC9Ooqk.png)\n\n**Operations**\n\n* For the next two years, including funds on hand, we will have $13.6M and 961,364 UNI remaining to spend on Ops moving forward ($17.9M total at current UNI prices) through Q4 2025.\n* Because we are now planning for the next 2 years, we are adding an additional $1M in buffer to cover unexpected legal costs.\n\n![|574x235](upload://dOqJItUB64K8G2WmaQrTstMwMj6.png)\n\n**Additional Notes**\n\nOver the last year, the UF has spent $3.15M on ops and $5.4M in grants. We offer a few comments on these amounts below:\n\n* Over the last quarter, we slowed down grant-making activities purposefully in order to build a strategy for grant-making for v4. We expect grants to double or triple to $10-$15M in grants committed per year. Over the next year, our annual operational spend is projected to increase by only ~20%. Over time as we scale we expect the ratio of grants-to-ops spend to continue to increase.\n* That being said we also want to note the multitude of activities that our team takes on outside of vanilla grant-making. Many of our team members spend their time incubating and coordinating novel grant-making programs, like the TL;DR Research Institute. And, approximately 50% of our teams’ time over the last year was focused outside of grant-making, including on event/hackathon coordination, hands-on support, marketing & comms, and legal/regulatory work.\n\nThe UF will retain the need to receive governance approval via an off-chain vote for grants larger than $2M. For that vote, we will use the terms set for the Temperature Check -- a 5-day Snapshot poll with 10M quorum.\n\n**Tranche 1 Review**\n\nLast year in our Tranche 1 of funding, we requested 2,547,002 UNI with the goal of receiving $20M. However the price of UNI decreased over the 11 days between our request and when it hit our wallet, decreasing the UNI’s value to $17.3M.\n\n* We priced this at the 30-day TWAP of $8.14 on the day we kicked off the governance vote August 17 2022. At this price, 2,547,002 UNI equates to $20M.\n* When we received the funds on August 25, the UNI price had fallen 13.7% to $7.05, meaning that $17.3M worth of UNI hit our multi-sig. We use this number, $17.3M, to calculate the remainder of capital owed to the UF.\n\n## Treasury Diversification\n\nOur Treasury Diversification policy is designed to prioritize capital preservation and risk mitigation. We also maintain a portion of our assets in UNI to offer as part of a compensation package to our employees, to align interests with that of the Uniswap ecosystem.\n\nFunds will be split between Operations and Grants. Below we detail our methodology for diversifying our assets within these two categories.\n\nFor Operational funds, we will:\n\n1. Set aside UNI tokens to be used in employee compensation packages.\n2. Maintain 6 months runway in cash in an FDIC-insured bank account.\n3. Invest the remainder of our funds in a low-risk yield bearing asset.\n\nFor Grants funds, we will:\n\n1. Maintain a portion of funds in stablecoins.\n2. Maintain 6 months of anticipated grants funding in an FDIC-insured bank account.\n3. Invest the remainder of our funds in a low-risk yield bearing asset.\n\nThis plan aligns our financial strategy with our core objectives, minimizing risk from market volatility to safeguard the foundation’s operations and grant-making commitments.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nWe are kicking off our Temperature Check vote today - you can vote [here](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xae0ff2f4cb4c1d292f7bf7c4c4bf7f4046be89518a0c7cbce65d658f2d36f20f). This vote will last for 5 days. We will kick off our on-chain governance vote next week.\n\n# Appendix\n\nTo get a more comprehensive review on our work thus far, take a look at the blog posts we’ve written over the last year:\n\n* [UF Update to the Community - 7 Months In](https://uniswapfoundation.mirror.xyz/tr5WYuu4CSrWOXhFS8zJNL1i2gp9Z8kJxIddJM4R2V8)\n* [Strengthening Uniswap Governance](https://uniswapfoundation.mirror.xyz/2P07K6h6kEIie2BIpvxGy3usVSHGAQ51lDhOxLmmtMA).\n* To review the complete list of grants we have disbursed, check out our [Wave 1](https://mirror.xyz/devi731.eth/Dy705L0V2MufftJ-x4zgAhfILw2yE18RY0lNsVN3mEA), [Wave 2](https://uniswapfoundation.mirror.xyz/h3bNWvussGBX5wm2oAuvS9RP8BTPgD6d80A_eL5lltU), and [Wave 3](https://uniswapfoundation.mirror.xyz/RM7VRw1TLrZPio0G7QgiS2q-kooo8D65zNihK_2NlDc) write-ups.\n\n*Thank you to Jesse Walden, Hart Lambur, Alexis Gauba, and Julia Rosenberg for their support as advisors and multi-sig signers over the last year.*",

      "title": "Deploy Uniswap V3 on Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM)",
      "content": "## Summary\nWe [Michigan Blockchain](https://twitter.com/UMichBlockchain) are submitting this proposal to deploy Uniswap v3 on the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), a programmable EMV-compatible environment built over the Filecoin blockchain and its robust system of decentrally stored data. The [temperature check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x36a17f6c311f3d910bc11cb4cd55891a7e6c71facd04e7bffcfb267fdd88c45b) for this proposal passed with **28M (~99.9%) YES** votes and **4.6k (~0.01%) NO votes**–the proposal stakeholders were agreed upon via the RFC.\n\n## Proposal Motivation\nConsidering Filecoin is the de facto storage provider in the blockchain space, it is valuable for Uniswap to attain market share in its data economy early on. We therefore believe that an FVM deployment is an opportune manner by which Uniswap’s multichain vision is furthered. \n\n### Uniswap’s Ability to Enhance the Decentralized Data Economy\nOne of the reasons that peer to peer storage systems like IPFS are difficult to maintain is because the parties involved in the network are not incentivized to expend resources to maintain the integrity of the stored data. Decentralization is not an inherent method for providing a superior storage product. That is why Filecoin was created. The Filecoin blockchain’s economic incentive structure between storage providers (SPs) and users creates a market for SPs to store and maintain data integrity over time. However, the robustness of that data economy must also be high for sustaining data storage in the long run. If SPs, for instance, do not have access to creatively expand their service provision business or efficiently put their capital to work, then their incentive to partake in the Filecoin/IPFS system is reduced.\n\nThe FVM’s launch on March 14, 2023 effectively made Filecoin programmable through the introduction of smart contracts. Programmability allows for the creation of dapps that work in tandem with the stored data. If an ecosystem of, say, DeFi applications can be built on the FVM to supplement the efforts of SPs, then the data economy is strengthened many fold. Invariably, DEXs are a rudimentary building block of a crypto economy, and just as they enable higher degrees of liquidity for numerous L1s, they will be able to provide a similar facility for Filecoin’s data economy. Uniswap would, for instance, grant SPs the ability to swap between $FIL tokens that they earn as a reward for providing their services. More DeFi use cases are mentioned in the “How the FVM is Enabling a Data Economy” section.\n\n## Proposal Stakeholders\nThe following list of stakeholders is present to transparently communicate which entities and individuals are involved in proposal creation and implementation.\n\n**Proposer:** [Michigan Blockchain](https://twitter.com/umichblockchain?lang=en)\n* This entity is responsible for authoring the proposal & managing the governance process\n\n**Deployer:** [Axelar](https://axelar.network/)\n* This entity is responsible for the technical deployment of the contracts on the target chain\n\n**Bridge Provider:** [Axelar](https://axelar.network/)\n* This is the cross-chain messaging solution selected for this deployment\n\n**Target Chain:** [Filecoin](https://fvm.filecoin.io/) (specifically, the FVM)\n* This is the chain that v3 contracts have been deployed on\n\n**Proposal Sponsor:** Michigan Blockchain\n* This entity has >2.5M UNI and is therefore eligible for administering the onchain vote\n\n## A Primer on Filecoin\n\n### Filecoin, IPFS, and Storage Helpers\nFilecoin is the premier decentralized storage protocol built on top of the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). The two entities are distinct but often incorrectly conflated as one. Although Protocol Labs founded–and continues to aid in the development of–both Filecoin and IPFS, the two systems serve distinct purposes. IPFS is not a blockchain but a set of modular data addressing and networking protocols. Using IPFS, files are fragmented, hashed, and distributed amongst numerous nodes. Data distribution in a network of SPs around the world makes the system more secure than a centralized cloud storage system. Centralized servers reduce the control an individual has over their data and increases the surface area for information exploits. The hashed nature of the data allows for a secure manner of locating files using a technique known as content-addressing, which differs from the traditional location-addressing method (HTTP) used by most of the Internet. Even though data on IPFS are stored off-chain (i.e. on hardware devices), they are secure due to the combination of content-addressing and a verifiable zk-proof system present on Filecoin.\n\nIPFS’ system allows for enterprise data centers to pledge their idle network resources like bandwidth and disk drive to secure others’ data. Such a storage system, however, does not function effectively without an incentive structure in place. Monetarily rewarding the entities involved in the file storage and retrieval processes enables the creation of a micro economy, where storage providers (SPs) are paid by users to store their data. Filecoin is the blockchain-based economic layer built on top of IPFS that allows for the exchange of $FIL tokens between SPs and users. Without Filecoin’s incentive structure, the storage provision capabilities of IPFS would not function or scale. Filecoin also allows for the development of a competitive data storage market, where storage prices are more attractive than those issued by incumbent centralized SPs like AWS or Microsoft Azure. By tapping the long tail of data centers, costs for storage, compute, and retrieval can be brought dramatically below the cloud incumbents\n\nData storage and retrieval is also simplified through the help of third-party storage helpers. These entities aid in abstracting away much of the protocol’s dealmaking complexities between SPs and users. Instead of interacting directly with Filecoin and IPFS, developers can leverage storage helpers’ API services. Dapps can therefore receive decentralized storage benefits without much hassle. This is one of the reasons why the active number of deals, including those from [Filecoin Plus](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/how-storage-works/filecoin-plus/), rose from [~16M to ~33M](https://observablehq.com/@starboard/chart-daily-active-deal-count-statistics) in 2023 alone. A notable storage helper called NFT.storage allows anybody using NFTs to decentrally store and retrieve their NFT metadata and images on IPFS and Filecoin. Used by platforms like OpenSea and Magic Eden, the helper has experienced over [122M total uploads, accounting for 304.13 TB of data on Filecoin](https://nft.storage/stats/).\n\n### Proof of Storage\nSPs are only paid when they submit two types of cryptographic proofs to the Filecoin protocol: Proof of Replication (PoRep) & Proof of Spacetime (PoSt). Collectively, these two proofs can be thought of as a means by which storage is proved. PoRep is initially conducted upon the SP receiving the users data, and it requires the SP to generate a public proof signifying that the hashed data is securely stored and replicated on a hardware device. It is a way to make sure that SP does not lie about the fact that they are storing the given data. PoSt is a process that occurs every 24 hours–it requires SPs to prove that a designated parcel of data is still stored (space) and able to be retrieved by the user whenever they desire (time). Daily spacetime proofs allow for the protocol to ensure data continuity. Currently, the network maintains [12.11 EiBs ](https://dashboard.starboard.ventures/capacity-services) of storage space, provided by [over 4,000 SPs](https://medium.com/tldrfilecoin/state-and-direction-of-filecoin-summarized-4b90c59e3cca).\n\nMere storage provision, however, is not a useful metric in and of itself because there must be demand present for the supplied storage. Although Q1 saw a decline in total storage provided, there was a 105% increase in the utilization rate, which is a more significant figure for displaying network activity.\n\nEvery SP has to collateralize a bond of $FIL tokens. Malicious and reckless SP behavior is thwarted by subjecting the bond to slashing; block rewards are also slashed in similar circumstances. Inability to generate a PoSt proof therefore has monetary consequences. The current stake that Filecoin SPs have put forth as collateral amounts to ~ 144M FIL tokens.\n\nThe other side of the Filecoin data economy is the retrieval system. Users must pay retrieval providers using $FIL to retrieve their data from the storage providers. Current systems like [Filecoin Saturn](https://saturn.tech/#contact) enable a decentralized Content Delivery Network (CDN) for data retrieval. This process is continually being iterated to be made more efficient.\n\n## The Filecoin Virtual Machine\n\n### How the FVM is Enabling a Data Economy\n\nDue to the V18 Hygge Filecoin network upgrade in March 2023, smart contract programmability was introduced to the Filecoin blockchain. The FVM is a WASM-based execution environment that has the potential to enable programmable markets for storage, retrieval, compute, and Filecoin subnets, each catering to a new custom service. Foreign runtimes like the EVM are able to function on top of the FVM, allowing for developers to seamlessly program applications on Filecoin. Over time, multiple runtime environments will be introduced to the FVM, but the primary runtime that is currently available is the EVM. Solidity programmers can therefore utilize familiar tools like Hardhat, Foundry, Truffle, and Metamask to create EVM-based dapps on Filecoin, with the Filecoin complexities being abstracted from the developers’ purview. And so, with the incorporation of smart contracts, Filecoin is addressing the L1 market from the vantage point of actually being able to store users’ data; most other blockchains simply do not have the simultaneous storage capabilities and programmability.\n\nSupport for numerous VMs will enable FVM to better interact with alternative L1s and increase liquidity transmission between previously siloed chains. Programs deployed on the EVM, MoveVM, JS/SES, or any other VMs will be able to fork onto the FVM. This proposal seeks to create a fork of the Uniswap v3 code and deploy it on the FEVM.\n\n**The FVM’s goal is to harbor a robust data economy, and this can be accomplished by launching various services, enabled by smart contract development. Below are some examples:**\n\n***Perpetual Storage:*** Applications that allow for the automatic renewal of a deal between a client and the SPs, allowing for a continuous, long-term storage agreement that requires minimal manual intervention on behalf of the client.\n\n***Data DAOs:*** The FVM does not have direct access to the underlying data, but it does allow for that data to be governed. DAOs can be created around a dataset, accessible by a consortium of individuals as opposed to a single entity. Token-gated structures can also allow for better dataset access controls, like determining which entities can read, write, or read+write to a dataset.\n\n***Data Monetization:*** Data can also be tokenized, where certain tokens stand for a portion of a dataset, prescribing a market-determined value to the data underlying the respective tokens. This way, data itself can be collateralized and traded. Users of certain applications can also monetize their data by selling their profile NFTs, which give access to underlying consumer data, to marketing or analytics agencies.\n\n***DeFi:*** A crypto economy is not complete without basic financial applications like DEXs and lending protocols. The “Proposal Motivation” section underscores why DEXs like Uniswap are important. Below are more examples of DeFi initiatives in the crypto data economy. Each of these has the ability to further enhance Uniswap’s position on Filecoin by routing liquidity between these various applications.\n\nOne example of a DeFi function is staking. Just like Lido and Rocket Pool allow ETH holders to secure the Ethereum blockchain without running a validator node with high computational and economic fixed costs, a similar model can be applied to Filecoin. A liquid staking protocol on FVM can therefore establish a profit-sharing system between SPs and $FIL holders. An alternative means for SPs to gather more $FIL for collateral purposes is by borrowing the $FIL from a lending protocol–of course, such dapps can also be built on the FVM. Token-gated features on lending dapps can also be enabled to allow for cost-effective $FIL borrowing. If an SP, for instance, has built a track record of reliable data storage with no slashing history, they can be issued an NFT by the lending protocol that gives the SP access to undercollateralized $FIL loans. Since larger amounts of data and longer storage periods require more $FIL, it is important to have seamless access to the token. This example illustrates the utilization of both DeFi and identity on the FVM.\n\nLending platforms and staking protocols are simply incomplete without a DEX like Uniswap. So, to provide actors in the Filecoin ecosystem with a place to easily swap between assets like $FIL and $stFIL (this asset doesn’t exist yet–just an example), there must be an AMM present. Other creative applications can also be built using Uniswap in the backend for automated asset swaps; the opportunities are very expansive.\n\n### Ecosystem Development\n\nSince storage is a vital part of every project, Filecoin has attracted clients of all colors from both the crypto native and web2 world. [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), a public repository of data from documents and websites to movies and songs, utilizes Filecoin to safeguard its information. The [USC Shoah Foundation](https://sfi.usc.edu/about) also leverages Filecoin to store important historical accounts about genocides like the Holocaust. As for other blockchains, Filecoin is used by various L1s and L2s for data storage, largely through storage helpers like NFT.storage.\n\nAs of Q1 2023, the Filecoin ecosystem has [484 projects](https://messari.io/report/state-of-filecoin-q1-2023), with a trend of initiatives surpassing the initial project phase and into the accelerator stage and beyond. The Filecoin Foundation recently hosted a hackathon called [Space Warp](https://spacewarp.fvm.dev/#ie) containing over $400k of prizes and accelerator grants for promising projects building on the FVM. This was one of the initiatives to bootstrap the FVM ecosystem. Nearly two months after the FEVM’s launch, there have been [808 contracts deployed](https://dashboard.starboard.ventures/fvm) with over [130k transactions](https://dashboard.starboard.ventures/fvm) on the platform. Active contract users have also increased [184.5%](https://dashboard.starboard.ventures/fvm) since April 1st. Such activity is revitalizing the condition of Filecoin from a stance of developer interest. Over the next few months smart contract deployment is projected to increase heavily, a large shift from the past two years, during which the Filecoin [active developer count fell by 11%](http://developerreport.com/).\n\nOverall, it is evident that the Filecoin Foundation, Protocols Labs, and their partners are aggregating resources to attract more users to the FVM. The growth thus far has been strong–but it is too early to call it a success. This Uniswap deployment, however, will certainly be another method to attract both developers and users to the FVM.\n\n## Deployment Details\n\nThe approval of this proposal by Uniswap governance will lead the stated Uniswap v3 contracts to be deemed as the canonical deployment on the FVM. As is the case with all canonical v3 deployments, this deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3-deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended to include the reference to the stated v3 contracts on the FVM.\n\n**Uniswal V3 contracts have been deployed on Filecoin at the following addresses:**\n\n[UniswapV3Factory](https://filfox.info/en/address/0xB4C47eD546Fc31E26470a186eC2C5F19eF09BA41) | `0xB4C47eD546Fc31E26470a186eC2C5F19eF09BA41` \n\n[Multicall2](https://filfox.info/en/address/0xffd927d6F17495B28635DD49d24638e97BD8c8b8) | `0xffd927d6F17495B28635DD49d24638e97BD8c8b8`\n\n[ProxyAdmin](https://filfox.info/en/address/0xe9901ae78efB4386B1132009E310d08bCB445Bf5) | `0xe9901ae78efB4386B1132009E310d08bCB445Bf5`\n\n[TickLens](https://filfox.info/en/address/0x76c001ad9E527FEfA8Fa822a987Ad44ce720BAeD) | `0x76c001ad9E527FEfA8Fa822a987Ad44ce720BAeD`\n\n[NFTDescriptor ](https://filfox.info/en/address/0xe909B0cAE57EE7EFF56A5Ca7fc4b66CF4F7C2D38) | `0xe909B0cAE57EE7EFF56A5Ca7fc4b66CF4F7C2D38`\n\n[NonfungibleTokenPositionDescriptor](https://filfox.info/en/address/0x22850a17032F40778C0C0a3fDd96905950a39f89) | `0x22850a17032F40778C0C0a3fDd96905950a39f89`\n\n[DescriptorProxy](https://filfox.info/en/address/0xf0198aAa4a8792e2a4a6e6Fb3039e4B1C71f15bB) | `0xf0198aAa4a8792e2a4a6e6Fb3039e4B1C71f15bB`\n\n[NonfungibleTokenPositionManager](https://filfox.info/en/address/0x4cd986dD509fbB6A695aE971d5C56c8795f640ee) | `0x4cd986dD509fbB6A695aE971d5C56c8795f640ee`\n\n[V3Migrator](https://filfox.info/en/address/0x409af45457D4779828BFBCbe7aA653C38Edb9Ed9) | `0x409af45457D4779828BFBCbe7aA653C38Edb9Ed9`\n\n[V3Staker](https://filfox.info/en/address/0x915362b5450acbBc9F8044191aE7E35c86F2fE51) | `0x915362b5450acbBc9F8044191aE7E35c86F2fE51`\n\n[QuoterV2](https://filfox.info/en/address/0xE45C06922228A33fFf1ED54638A0db78f69F9780) | `0xE45C06922228A33fFf1ED54638A0db78f69F9780`\n\n[SwapRouter02](https://filfox.info/en/address/0xcAb04058e60020d65D18D4B3DFF2cA1445D7099f) | `0xcAb04058e60020d65D18D4B3DFF2cA1445D7099f`\n\n**Axelar Interchain Governance Executor is deployed at the following address:**\n\n[InterchainProposalSender (Mainnet)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1f8A4d195B647647c7dD45650CBd553FD33cCAA6) | `0x1f8A4d195B647647c7dD45650CBd553FD33cCAA6`\n\n[InterchainProposalExecutor (Filecoin)](https://filfox.info/en/address/0xFf3b2DA1379cc67cc2755194604713f10b820b0E) | `0xFf3b2DA1379cc67cc2755194604713f10b820b0E`\n\n\n\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal has passed the RFC and temperature check phases.

      "title": "Deploy Friendly Fork of Uniswap V3; ZERO Protocol on Polygon zkEVM",
      "content": "## Proposal summary\nIn light of the Uniswap DAO’s vote to deploy on the Polygon zkEVM (Tally | Uniswap Proposal 10), we propose a partnership between the Uniswap DAO and Zero Protocol. This collaboration centers on the concept of a “friendly fork.”\n\nA friendly fork refers to the creation of a new version of an existing protocol that retains a cooperative and synergistic relationship with the original. Unlike contentious forks, which often lead to competitive divergence, a friendly fork seeks to align with the parent protocol.\n\nIn this context, the below proposal will outline how the partnership entails integrating Zero Protocol as a friendly fork of Uniswap on the Polygon zkEVM chain. Zero Protocol will utilize Uniswap’s established backend infrastructure as its foundational engine and be granted access to ecosystem funded tooling. To align interests, the DAO will benefit from the open R&D taking place and receive a 10% token allocation detailed below. This approach resonates with Uniswap V2’s historical challenges of dealing with competitive forks and this scenario into an opportunity.\n\n# Overview of proposal\n## Description:\n\nWe propose a visionary partnership between the Uniswap DAO and Zero Protocol, focusing on the integration of Zero Protocol as a friendly fork of Uniswap on the Polygon zkEVM chain. This collaboration draws inspiration from Uniswap V2’s history and aims to transform past challenges into future opportunities. By leveraging this partnership, Uniswap can harness the advantages of Zero Protocol while ensuring that both projects benefit mutually and contribute to the evolving DeFi landscape.\n\n## What is Zero:\nZero Protocol introduces an innovative ve(3,3) decentralized exchange (DEX) concept that aims to optimize the efficiency and sustainability of liquidity for protocols and liquidity providers on Polygon zkEVM. Utilizing Uniswap V3 as its core trading engine, Zero Protocol distinguishes itself by building unique infrastructure and features around this foundation.\n\nZero is a direct fork of the existing Retro project on Polygon POS, which already relies on Uniswap V3 for trading. Using Angle Lab’s Merkl SaaS, we have been able to create a unique emissions distribution system which allows integration of multiple Active Liquidity Managers via Zero’s ALM Marketplace for liquidity management, a first in the DeFi space.\n\nZero has recently recieved a grant from Polygon to help bootstrap liquidity on the chain.\n\n## Since Retro’s launch on July 27th:\n\nTVL is at an ATH of ~$15M\nVolume from most recent epoch ~$40M\nAverage voter APR for veRETRO holders - ~150%\n$RETRO market cap has more than tripled from $2M at launch to over $7M today\nA straight 1:1 fork of UniV3 will also be the engine behind Zero Protocol (with fee changes made)\n\nRetro is currently the most advanced version of any ve(3,3) AMM in the entire DeFi space.\n\nRetro has grown very quickly into the third-largest fork of Uniswap V3, as measured by Defillama, underscoring the potential impact of Zero and showcasing its relevance within a new up-and-coming chain like Polygon zkEVM, which has already passed a vote by the Uniswap DAO.\n\n## What is a friendly fork?\nA friendly fork refers to a situation in which a protocol is duplicated, creating a new version that maintains a positive and collaborative relationship with the original project. Unlike contentious forks that often result in divergent and competitive paths, a friendly fork aims to work in harmony with the parent project, often for the purpose of introducing improvements, innovations, or addressing specific use cases. The intention behind a friendly fork is to foster collaboration, open-source development, and a sense of shared goals, rather than creating a rift or competition between the two versions.\n\nExamples of friendly forks formed previously in DeFi ecosystem:\n\nBalancer <> BeethovenX\n\nLiquity <> Gravita\n\nPlatypus <> Hummus\n\nThena <> Retro\n\nWhile a friendly fork prioritizes collaboration and shared success, it does not fall under Uniswap DAO and its governance.\n\n## Tokenomics\n\n1600×900 106 KB\nContext and Learning from Uniswap V2:\nUniswap V2’s success and widespread adoption led to numerous forks without providing significant returns to Uniswap or its community. The expiration of Uniswap V3’s business license presents a unique opportunity to learn from this history and establish a more rewarding framework. Our proposal envisions a symbiotic approach where Uniswap V3 and Zero Protocol can share in the successes of their joint ventures, ensuring that value is generated for both parties.\n\n## Revenue Generation and Token Allocation:\n\nTo cement the mutually beneficial nature of this partnership, we propose that Uniswap receives a percentage of the initial token allocation of Zero Protocol. This enables Uniswap to participate in governance decisions and generate revenue through voting, ensuring active engagement and sustained collaboration. This aligns with the spirit of reciprocity and incentivizes both projects to contribute to each other’s growth.\n\n## Timeline:\n\nWe suggest a structured proposal timeline spanning 3 weeks to ensure transparency, community engagement, and thoughtful decision-making. The timeline would be broken into 3 phases:\n\nPhase 1 Forum Post (Done)\n\nPhase 2 Temperature Check (Passed)\n\nPhase 3 Onchain Vote\n\nWe plan on launching Zero on Polygon zkEVM with Polygon’s support at the beginning of October.\n\n## Motivation for Uniswap\nUniswap V2 undeniably emerged as a groundbreaking protocol within the DeFi space, a sentiment echoed by the surge in its adoption and the remarkable number of forks that it has catalyzed over the last few years. The resilience and appeal of Uniswap V2’s technology are evidenced by the fact that it continues to maintain the highest Total Value Locked (TVL) combined across all forked categories. This achievement underscores its robustness and adaptability, with numerous projects leveraging its core mechanics to create innovative variations within the decentralized exchange landscape.\n\nHowever, despite the proliferation of Uniswap V2 forks and their significant TVL, there has been a missed opportunity for the Uniswap community and UNI token holders to capitalize on this phenomenon. While the DeFi ecosystem has witnessed a multitude of derivative projects utilizing Uniswap’s core technology, there has been a lack of active engagement from Uniswap and its stakeholders in reaping the benefits of these forks.\n\nThis narrative presents a pivotal juncture as Uniswap V3 takes center stage with the business license expired. By learning from the past and recognizing the value inherent in its technology, the Uniswap DAO has the potential to revolutionize its approach to forks. Rather than allowing forks to flourish independently, there is a strategic avenue for Uniswap V3 to foster a symbiotic relationship with these derivatives. Through the introduction of a friendly fork status, the Uniswap DAO can transform forks into partners, encouraging them to contribute to the Uniswap ecosystem while simultaneously capitalizing on value capture allowing for independent forks to collectively reap rewards.\n\nBy strategically collaborating with these forks, Uniswap V3 can capture value from the derivatives built on its technology while fostering a stronger sense of community and collaboration within the DeFi landscape. This proactive approach aligns with the vision of maximizing the potential of Uniswap’s technology and positioning it as a trailblazer in the evolution of decentralized exchanges. Ultimately, taking this transformative step can lead to a more dynamic and prosperous future for Uniswap and its stakeholders.\n\n## Partner Details\nAbout:\n\nStabl Labs FZE. \n4Stabl Labs is the parent organization of\n\nRetro Finance\n\nretro.finance\nRetro 3\nTrade your favourite tokens with low-slippage and efficient pricing.

O. Box No. 42944\n\nSharjah, UAE\n\n## Delegate Sponsor\n“GFX Labs is sponsoring the proposal because we believe it is a strong opportunity for the DAO to solidify a process for friendly forks and continue Uniswap’s multi-chain expansion.”\n\nAdditional information for cross-chain deployments\nWe believe this is the right moment for ZERO (UniV3 friendly fork) to deploy on Polygon zkEVM. ZERO will be the liquidity layer for Polygon zkEVM, bootstrapping liquidity for new and existing projects on chain or migrating to zkEVM.\n\nThe friendly fork to Polygon zkEVM would not only capitalize on the compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts but also benefit from the scalability features offered by Polygon’s zkEVM. Polygon zkEVM, an open-source ZK-Rollup, delivers a hassle-free user experience with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. It flawlessly integrates with pre-existing smart contracts, developer tools, and wallets. Leveraging the strength of ZK proofs, Polygon zkEVM significantly reduces transaction expenses and substantially boosts transaction speed, while also adopting Ethereum’s robust security. As previously mentioned, a proposal has already been passed 10 signaling intent to move to this chain.\n\n## Benefits:\n\nLaunching Zero, a direct fork of Retro, on Polygon zkEVM grants additional exposure and credibility to both protocols - allowing the total to be greater than the sum of its parts.\nUsing a proven, successful ve(3,3) model on zkEVM at this early stage of the chain’s lifetime allows Zero Protocol to capture a significant portion of liquidity and volume on the chain.\n## Engagement Terms\nUniswap DAO acknowledges Zero Protocol on Polygon zkEVM as “friendly fork” of Uniswap v3 and as such is considered an auxiliary member of the Uniswap Ecosystem. Zero Protocol would be afforded access to all existing and future tooling for Uniswap v3 which has been granted by UF previously; i.e OkuTrade, Seedle.finance and Uniswap.fish.\n\nIn return for the cooperation and exclusive friendly fork status on Polygon zkEVM, Zero will allocate 10% of the initial token allocation to the Uniswap DAO.\n\n-10% of initial supply will be streamed to the Uniswap treasury address upon launch as a veZERO veNFT locked for 2 years (5,000,000 veZERO). This includes a 30% veZERO rebase for the first 90 days, and a 15% rebase thereafter to avoid dilution of the veZERO position.\n\n## Project Financing\nZero Protocol’s commitment and intention is to embark on this partnership without seeking any funding from Uniswap. Zero Protocol’s willingness to bear all the costs associated with the launch and operation on zkEVM showcases the dedication and belief in the potential of this collaboration.\n\nThis self-sufficient approach not only underscores the sincerity of their engagement but also emphasizes their long-term vision for building a thriving ecosystem on Polygon zkEVM. Such an approach aligns with the spirit of mutual growth and innovation, setting a strong foundation for a partnership that places collaboration and shared success at the forefront.\n\n## Risk Profile\nZero will be a fork of retro which has an Open Zeppelin audit\n\n\n[blog.openzeppelin.com](blog.openzeppelin.com)\nRetro/Thena Audit\nThe scope of this audit relates to a collaborative work between two protocols from different chains: Retro (Polygon) and Thena (BNB Chain).

      "content": "In light of the Uniswap DAO’s vote to deploy on the Polygon zkEVM (Tally | Uniswap Proposal 10), we propose a partnership between the Uniswap DAO and Zero Protocol. This collaboration centers on the concept of a “friendly fork.”\n\nA friendly fork refers to the creation of a new version of an existing protocol that retains a cooperative and synergistic relationship with the original. Unlike contentious forks, which often lead to competitive divergence, a friendly fork seeks to align with the parent protocol.\n\nIn this context, the below proposal will outline how the partnership entails integrating Zero Protocol as a friendly fork of Uniswap on the Polygon zkEVM chain. Zero Protocol will utilize Uniswap’s established backend infrastructure as its foundational engine and be granted access to ecosystem funded tooling. To align interests, the DAO will benefit from the open R&D taking place and receive a 10% token allocation detailed below. This approach resonates with Uniswap V2’s historical challenges of dealing with competitive forks and this scenario into an opportunity.\n\n# Overview of proposal\n## Description:\n\nWe propose a visionary partnership between the Uniswap DAO and Zero Protocol, focusing on the integration of Zero Protocol as a friendly fork of Uniswap on the Polygon zkEVM chain. This collaboration draws inspiration from Uniswap V2’s history and aims to transform past challenges into future opportunities. By leveraging this partnership, Uniswap can harness the advantages of Zero Protocol while ensuring that both projects benefit mutually and contribute to the evolving DeFi landscape.\n\n## What is Zero:\nZero Protocol introduces an innovative ve(3,3) decentralized exchange (DEX) concept that aims to optimize the efficiency and sustainability of liquidity for protocols and liquidity providers on Polygon zkEVM. Utilizing Uniswap V3 as its core trading engine, Zero Protocol distinguishes itself by building unique infrastructure and features around this foundation.\n\nZero is a direct fork of the existing Retro project on Polygon POS, which already relies on Uniswap V3 for trading. Using Angle Lab’s Merkl SaaS, we have been able to create a unique emissions distribution system which allows integration of multiple Active Liquidity Managers via Zero’s ALM Marketplace for liquidity management, a first in the DeFi space.\n\nZero has recently recieved a grant from Polygon to help bootstrap liquidity on the chain.\n\n## Since Retro’s launch on July 27th:\n\nTVL is at an ATH of ~$15M\nVolume from most recent epoch ~$40M\nAverage voter APR for veRETRO holders - ~150%\n$RETRO market cap has more than tripled from $2M at launch to over $7M today\nA straight 1:1 fork of UniV3 will also be the engine behind Zero Protocol (with fee changes made)\n\nRetro is currently the most advanced version of any ve(3,3) AMM in the entire DeFi space.\n\nRetro has grown very quickly into the third-largest fork of Uniswap V3, as measured by Defillama, underscoring the potential impact of Zero and showcasing its relevance within a new up-and-coming chain like Polygon zkEVM, which has already passed a vote by the Uniswap DAO.\n\n## What is a friendly fork?\nA friendly fork refers to a situation in which a protocol is duplicated, creating a new version that maintains a positive and collaborative relationship with the original project. Unlike contentious forks that often result in divergent and competitive paths, a friendly fork aims to work in harmony with the parent project, often for the purpose of introducing improvements, innovations, or addressing specific use cases. The intention behind a friendly fork is to foster collaboration, open-source development, and a sense of shared goals, rather than creating a rift or competition between the two versions.\n\nExamples of friendly forks formed previously in DeFi ecosystem:\n\nBalancer <> BeethovenX\n\nLiquity <> Gravita\n\nPlatypus <> Hummus\n\nThena <> Retro\n\nWhile a friendly fork prioritizes collaboration and shared success, it does not fall under Uniswap DAO and its governance.\n\n## Tokenomics\n\n1600×900 106 KB\nContext and Learning from Uniswap V2:\nUniswap V2’s success and widespread adoption led to numerous forks without providing significant returns to Uniswap or its community. The expiration of Uniswap V3’s business license presents a unique opportunity to learn from this history and establish a more rewarding framework. Our proposal envisions a symbiotic approach where Uniswap V3 and Zero Protocol can share in the successes of their joint ventures, ensuring that value is generated for both parties.\n\n## Revenue Generation and Token Allocation:\n\nTo cement the mutually beneficial nature of this partnership, we propose that Uniswap receives a percentage of the initial token allocation of Zero Protocol. This enables Uniswap to participate in governance decisions and generate revenue through voting, ensuring active engagement and sustained collaboration. This aligns with the spirit of reciprocity and incentivizes both projects to contribute to each other’s growth.\n\n## Timeline:\n\nWe suggest a structured proposal timeline spanning 3 weeks to ensure transparency, community engagement, and thoughtful decision-making. The timeline would be broken into 3 phases:\n\nPhase 1 Forum Post (Done)\n\nPhase 2 Temperature Check (Passed)\n\nPhase 3 Onchain Vote\n\nWe plan on launching Zero on Polygon zkEVM with Polygon’s support at the beginning of October.\n\n## Motivation for Uniswap\nUniswap V2 undeniably emerged as a groundbreaking protocol within the DeFi space, a sentiment echoed by the surge in its adoption and the remarkable number of forks that it has catalyzed over the last few years. The resilience and appeal of Uniswap V2’s technology are evidenced by the fact that it continues to maintain the highest Total Value Locked (TVL) combined across all forked categories. This achievement underscores its robustness and adaptability, with numerous projects leveraging its core mechanics to create innovative variations within the decentralized exchange landscape.\n\nHowever, despite the proliferation of Uniswap V2 forks and their significant TVL, there has been a missed opportunity for the Uniswap community and UNI token holders to capitalize on this phenomenon. While the DeFi ecosystem has witnessed a multitude of derivative projects utilizing Uniswap’s core technology, there has been a lack of active engagement from Uniswap and its stakeholders in reaping the benefits of these forks.\n\nThis narrative presents a pivotal juncture as Uniswap V3 takes center stage with the business license expired. By learning from the past and recognizing the value inherent in its technology, the Uniswap DAO has the potential to revolutionize its approach to forks. Rather than allowing forks to flourish independently, there is a strategic avenue for Uniswap V3 to foster a symbiotic relationship with these derivatives. Through the introduction of a friendly fork status, the Uniswap DAO can transform forks into partners, encouraging them to contribute to the Uniswap ecosystem while simultaneously capitalizing on value capture allowing for independent forks to collectively reap rewards.\n\nBy strategically collaborating with these forks, Uniswap V3 can capture value from the derivatives built on its technology while fostering a stronger sense of community and collaboration within the DeFi landscape. This proactive approach aligns with the vision of maximizing the potential of Uniswap’s technology and positioning it as a trailblazer in the evolution of decentralized exchanges. Ultimately, taking this transformative step can lead to a more dynamic and prosperous future for Uniswap and its stakeholders.\n\n## Partner Details\nAbout:\n\nStabl Labs FZE. \n4Stabl Labs is the parent organization of\n\nRetro Finance\n\nretro.finance\nRetro 3\nTrade your favourite tokens with low-slippage and efficient pricing.

O. Box No. 42944\n\nSharjah, UAE\n\n## Delegate Sponsor\n“GFX Labs is sponsoring the proposal because we believe it is a strong opportunity for the DAO to solidify a process for friendly forks and continue Uniswap’s multi-chain expansion.”\n\nAdditional information for cross-chain deployments\nWe believe this is the right moment for ZERO (UniV3 friendly fork) to deploy on Polygon zkEVM. ZERO will be the liquidity layer for Polygon zkEVM, bootstrapping liquidity for new and existing projects on chain or migrating to zkEVM.\n\nThe friendly fork to Polygon zkEVM would not only capitalize on the compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts but also benefit from the scalability features offered by Polygon’s zkEVM. Polygon zkEVM, an open-source ZK-Rollup, delivers a hassle-free user experience with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. It flawlessly integrates with pre-existing smart contracts, developer tools, and wallets. Leveraging the strength of ZK proofs, Polygon zkEVM significantly reduces transaction expenses and substantially boosts transaction speed, while also adopting Ethereum’s robust security. As previously mentioned, a proposal has already been passed 10 signaling intent to move to this chain.\n\n## Benefits:\n\nLaunching Zero, a direct fork of Retro, on Polygon zkEVM grants additional exposure and credibility to both protocols - allowing the total to be greater than the sum of its parts.\nUsing a proven, successful ve(3,3) model on zkEVM at this early stage of the chain’s lifetime allows Zero Protocol to capture a significant portion of liquidity and volume on the chain.\n## Engagement Terms\nUniswap DAO acknowledges Zero Protocol on Polygon zkEVM as “friendly fork” of Uniswap v3 and as such is considered an auxiliary member of the Uniswap Ecosystem. Zero Protocol would be afforded access to all existing and future tooling for Uniswap v3 which has been granted by UF previously; i.e OkuTrade, Seedle.finance and Uniswap.fish.\n\nIn return for the cooperation and exclusive friendly fork status on Polygon zkEVM, Zero will allocate 10% of the initial token allocation to the Uniswap DAO.\n\n-10% of initial supply will be streamed to the Uniswap treasury address upon launch as a veZERO veNFT locked for 2 years (5,000,000 veZERO). This includes a 30% veZERO rebase for the first 90 days, and a 15% rebase thereafter to avoid dilution of the veZERO position.\n\n## Project Financing\nZero Protocol’s commitment and intention is to embark on this partnership without seeking any funding from Uniswap. Zero Protocol’s willingness to bear all the costs associated with the launch and operation on zkEVM showcases the dedication and belief in the potential of this collaboration.\n\nThis self-sufficient approach not only underscores the sincerity of their engagement but also emphasizes their long-term vision for building a thriving ecosystem on Polygon zkEVM. Such an approach aligns with the spirit of mutual growth and innovation, setting a strong foundation for a partnership that places collaboration and shared success at the forefront.\n\n## Risk Profile\nZero will be a fork of retro which has an Open Zeppelin audit\n\n\n[blog.openzeppelin.com](blog.openzeppelin.com)\nRetro/Thena Audit\nThe scope of this audit relates to a collaborative work between two protocols from different chains: Retro (Polygon) and Thena (BNB Chain).

      "title": "Create a UNI-ARB Grant Program (UAGP) and Protocol Delegate Program",
      "content": "Thanks to everyone who has taken the time to read and help iterate our proposal for the UNI-ARB Grant Program (UAGP) and Protocol Delegate Program! Talking with you all has made us even more excited about how the Uniswap DAO can strengthen both the Uniswap / Arbitrum ecosystems.\n\nAs outlined in the[ temperature check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temp-check-create-a-uni-arb-working-group/21583/1), the proposal suggests the creation of the UAGP and Protocol Delegate Program, utilizing a significant allocation of 2.2m $ARB tokens to enhance the Uniswap ecosystem on the Arbitrum Protocol.\n\nAfter an 8-week research sprint and iterations with delegates in our capacity as Working Group Zero (WG0), we've fine-tuned the structure for both the UAGP and Protocol Delegate Program. \n\nNow it is time to vote on the funding of both of these programs with parts of the received $ARB airdrop. Following a successful onchain proposal, WG0 will lead a nomination and election process to fill the UAGP and Protocol Delegate Program with more members. As initiators of the programs, we have an ambition to be part of the mentioned programs and would feel privileged to help drive these forward. \n\n\n**Working Group Zero (WG0) members:**\n\n- web3 Studios (Crypto-native advisory) [@bernard](https://gov.uniswap.org/u/bernard)\n- Alastor (Crypto-native advisory) [@Stastny](https://gov.uniswap.org/u/stastny)\n- Doo Wan Nam (StableLab, Uniswap Deployment Accountability Committee) [@Doo\\_Stablelab](https://gov.uniswap.org/u/doo_stablelab)\n- Jun Sun (Uniswap Deployment Accountability Committee, Delegate) [@Juanbug](https://gov.uniswap.org/u/juanbug)\n\nHelpful links for context: [Temp Check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temp-check-create-a-uni-arb-working-group/21583/1), [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x86ded24b11c4714e0f4f2b6e4ca489f60dc33e6f2f4ababa5575bf5ab973a005), [RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-alastor-w3s-create-a-uni-arb-working-group/21376), [UAGP Research](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nIi5ujPa_-7PtDFtR3QBqxL7nl861Ry1/view?usp=sharing), [Delegate Program Research](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Idp35yZmHIPMDVg9OGpbWyTDtf7-ko1l/view?usp=sharing)\n\n\n## Background\n\nThe ARB airdrop provides the Uniswap community with an opportunity to enhance its presence within the Arbitrum ecosystem, thus nurturing growth. \n\n**The UNI-ARB Working Group Zero aims to unify various governance initiatives into a single, coherent system. This helps us align with Uniswap's vision and positions us to take advantage of future allocation opportunities.**\n\nTherefore, we proposed the establishment of a Working Group 0 that had the task to structure the UNI-ARB Grant Program and Protocol Delegate Program and get to an on-chain vote:\n\n1. **Grant Program: 1.1 million (25% of the total airdrop) ARB tokens for UNI-ARB Grants -** Supporting growth and development of projects exclusively within the Uniswap-Arbitrum ecosystem, with a focus on long-term benefits.\n2. **Protocol Delegate Program: 1.1 million (25% of the total airdrop) ARB tokens for Governance -** Empowering the committee to actively participate in Arbitrum governance and influence strategic decisions. \n\n\n# 1. UNI/ARB Grant Program (UAGP)\n\nAfter an extensive 8-week research phase with the WG0–researching leading Grant Programs, expert interviews, and iterations with Uni delegates–we're excited to introduce a best-in-class Grant Program designed to become a pacesetter for future Uniswap grant initiatives.  \n\n\n## Summary\n- This proposal outlines a **framework for funding Uniswap and Arbitrum ecosystem development with grants** from the Arbitrum Airdrop.\n- Concentrating on **fewer but more impactful initiatives, the committee will focus on grants from 50 - 250k $ ARB** (vs. a large number of grants to smaller projects) and administer a budget capped at $1 million ARB for the initial 6 months. \n- To manage the manual nature of grants administration, we propose a *committee of 5 members — one operating lead and five reviewers (incl. operating lead) — to efficiently allocate funds without necessitating community votes on each application.\n- **Monthly reports will update the community** on decisions taken and each funded project's status.\n\n\n\n## Mission\n\nThe UNI/ARB Grant Program (UAGP) aims to:\n\n- **Fund High-Impact Projects:** The program allocates grants specifically to projects that demonstrate the potential for substantial positive impact on the Uniswap and Arbitrum ecosystems.\n- **Strengthen the Uniswap and Arbitrum Ecosystems:** The UNI/ARB Grant Program (UAGP) aims to strengthen the ties and facilitate exchange between the Uniswap and Arbitrum ecosystems.\n- **Ensure Transparency and Community Input:** The program mandates regular progress reports and seeks community feedback to influence the direction of funded projects.\n\n\n## Grant Program Design & Approach\n\nSetting up a best-in-class Grant Program is a multifaceted task. We broke it down into its key components, aligned with a grantee's journey, to effectively solve the typical challenges of grant programs. \n\nWith our WG0, we took 8 weeks to do research on the leading Grant programs from other protocols (UGP, Aave, Metamask, Synthetix), conduct expert interviews with Grant Program leads from multiple ecosystems, and iteration sessions with 8 larger Uni delegates (voting power of ≥2.5M UNI). \n\nFind detailed research here: [UAGP Research](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nIi5ujPa_-7PtDFtR3QBqxL7nl861Ry1/view?usp=sharing)\n\n\n## Exec view\n\n- **$1 million ARB allocated across impactful grants**, with allocation sizes between **$50-250k per project**.\n- **5-member committee** responsible for selection and oversight, led by an operating lead.\n- A **transparent nomination and election process for additional committee members**, emphasizing a blend of technical and investment expertise.\n- Our objective is to **distribute the grant funds within the initial 6-month period**.\n- We aim for **close alignment with Uniswap Foundation** to receive continuous feedback on priorities while generally operating independently to avoid overlaps..\n\n\n\n## Key Pillars\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/IIZzhe2CAndLBcYoNo9hdGDBA8c92fcvjeFoip3M-C5uvV7AMczraibWPPxxnGdkHsc9IgrQpWfv8ogKxrb8J_9zW4qJL2QrjwyEBzpItYKo0BcwLBFlWyGmU9htg7M02lf08eg9G08Cu7IR)\n\n### (A) **Grant Program Objectives and Criteria**\n\n**Objectives**\n\nFor an extensive description of our objectives, please refer to the mission statement above. The program focuses on three key areas:\n\n- **Fund High-Impact Projects**\n- **Strengthen the Uniswap and Arbitrum Ecosystems**\n- **Ensure Transparency and Community Input**\n\n\n**RFP-based Program vs. Open**\n\nRather than solely relying on inbound applications for grant distribution, we decided for an RFP-based approach to align with high-impact themes that we defined and got feedback on by a range of delegates, the Uniswap Foundation, and active community members. \n\nTo gather these ideas, we carefully selected an initial list of RFPs for funding, with a priority on projects offering the highest potential value for Uniswap. These initial themes are designed to remain adaptable, allowing for continuous adjustments to meet the evolving needs of the ecosystem. This process merged what we identified as valuable contributions within Working Group 0 with valuable guidance and feedback from both delegates and UF.\n\n1. **Liquidity Management and Derivative Protocols**:\\\n   _The development of derivative and liquidity management protocols interacting with Uniswap can pave the way for more sophisticated instruments and strategies on Arbitrum, seeing new increases in transaction volumes and TVL._\n\n2. **Arbitrum testnet with EIP-1153 enabled**:\\\n   _Currently, developers aiming to test Uniswap v4 face a cumbersome and convoluted procedure. This process, which needs to be executed locally, is far from straightforward. The lack of a streamlined approach poses challenges and inefficiencies for these developers. There's a pressing need for a more intuitive and efficient testing environment or system to simplify this procedure for Uniswap v4._\n\n3. **Uniswap v4 Infrastructure Dev Tools**:\\\n   _The intricacies of Uniswap v4 are difficult for present-day development tools to manage, often resulting in less-than-smooth implementations. From this perspective, it underscores the necessity for a new or improved toolset that specifically adds value to the Uniswap-Arbitrum ecosystem. To prevent overlap with UF in the context of this particular RFC, which focuses on general Uniswap v4 development, we will closely coordinate our inbound with UF._\n\n4. **Uniswap on Arbitrum Ecosystem tools or products**:\\\n   _Tools or products for the ecosystem that aim to strengthen the protocol, elevate user engagement, and capture attention from new users and outside parties. This category is kept broad intentionally to allow for a broad range of contributions and targeting and tech tool or product fulfilling the aforementioned target._\n   \n5. **Open Contribution**: \n   _A variety of initiatives and applications, not necessarily aligning with the previous four categories, are welcomed by the Grant Program. This flexibility allows for the embrace of a wide range of contributions from our community, promoting growth and innovation within the Uniswap-Arbitrum ecosystem._\n\n\n\n### (B) Application Process\n\nTo efficiently handle the anticipated surge in applications, we've implemented a streamlined process that initially screens applications using RFPs and team requirements. These applications will be submitted through Airtable and published in Notion. Following this, we will manually review all projects to identify those warranting further due diligence in a structured process: \n\n- **Initial Screening & RFP/Open Submission:** Applicants complete an online form, choosing to either address a specific Request for Proposals (RFP) or opt for an open submission. This step serves as our first layer of manual screening.\n- **In-Depth Review & Feedback:** Projects that pass the initial screening will undergo a review DD by our committee, including interviews and constructive feedback. This process is conducted on a rolling basis, ensuring ongoing evaluation and an even distribution of workload throughout the entire term.   \n- **Award & Monitoring:** Once approved, projects receive funding and kick off their work, with periodic check-ins and a concluding evaluation to measure impact and success. \n\n\n\n### ( C) Due Diligence\n\nOur due diligence process aims to be a robust evaluation system that combines the rigor of early-stage investing with strategic alignment to Uniswap's goals. After the initial screening, we will focus on the following elements: \n\n- **Team Assessment:** We evaluate the project's team, considering qualifications, experience, and track record to gauge their ability to execute their vision effectively.\n- **Impact Assessment:** We evaluate the potential impact of the project on the Uniswap and Arbitrum ecosystems, ensuring alignment with our grant program's values. Here we consider the technological potential of the project, as well as its potential application areas. \n- **Risk Assessment:** We identify and assess various risks, including market, technology, and execution risks, to gauge the project's risk mitigation strategies effectively. \n\nFollowing the evaluation using the aforementioned dimensions, projects proceed through the subsequent internal governance procedure:\n\n- **Final Approval by Reviewer Committee:** The committee uses a form to give a 'yes' or 'no' to each grant application, requesting references as part of the assessment.\n- **Strategic Funding Focus:** Our grants are aimed at projects that have a substantive impact on the protocol's growth and effectiveness (vs. wide range of small grants). \n- **Ask for continuous feedback from UF:** To prevent breaking points in communication and objectives, we aim to get continuous feedback on our funding decisions from the Uniswap Foundation.\n\n\n\n### (D) Selection Process & Reporting\n\nTransparency and continuous dialogue form the backbone of our selection and reporting process, ensuring that each grantee remains aligned with program expectations.\n\n- **Monthly Reports**: We will provide monthly updates on our selections and updates on funded projects. These updates will include general project trajectory and progress toward milestones. To create the reports we will set regular monthly check-in dates where grantees fill a template/slide in order to give the key info about the project’s status, such as:\n  - Summary of Achievements for the Month\n  - Funds Utilized \n  - Milestones Reached\n  - Challenges Faced\n  - Upcoming Goals\n \n\n- **Output Metrics:** With the initial priorities in mind, some effective measures for meaningful output will look as follows:\n\n  - **Number of Grants Distributed:** Number of grants that were awarded during a defined time period (3m, 6m).\n  - **Total Funds Allocated:** Cumulative sum of funds distributed over a particular time frame, showcasing the program's financial impact.\n  - **Milestone Completion Rate:** Calculated as the number of successfully achieved project milestones divided by the total number of milestones, multiplied by 100, to evaluate the effectiveness of grant-supported initiatives.\n\n- **Outcome Metrics:** Depending on the final portfolio of funded projects, we will gauge the success rate of grantees through specific outcome metrics. While these metrics can be influenced by a wide range of external factors, such as market conditions and individual decisions on project level, we are committed to supporting and funding the most promising projects to the best of our ability. Metrics include:\n   - **Community Satisfaction Score:** An average score ranging from 1 to 10, gathered from community feedback surveys.\n   - **Protocol Integrations:** The number of blockchain protocols or projects that successfully integrate with Uniswap on Arbitrum as a result of the grants program.\n   - **Usage of Tools funded:** Measuring the adoption and usage of tools and infrastructure funded by the grants program. This could include metrics such as the number of developers using these tools or the volume of transactions processed through them.\n   - **Net New Liquidity Providers (LPs):** Tracking the increase in the number of liquidity providers within the Uniswap on Arbitrum ecosystem. This metric reflects the program's impact on attracting new participants to contribute liquidity.\n\n\n\n### (E) Project Allocation & Support\n\nOur approach to grant allocation focuses on achieving high impact, which we believe comes from bigger, more substantial projects:\n\n- **Focus on $50-250k High-Impact Projects:** Our grant allocation strategy prioritizes projects with the potential for significant impact. We concentrate our financial support in the $50,000 to $250,000 ARB range.\n- **Providing Non-financial Support:** Offer more than just funding by assisting selected projects with selective strategic guidance,  and other key areas that contribute to long-term success.\n- **Discord Support Channel:** We aim to establish a dedicated Discord channel for project to project exchange and bi-monthly office hours for direct support interactions.\n\n\n### (F) Team Set-up\n\nOur committee aims to create an efficient and predictable grant application and decision process.\n\n- **5 committee members:** 1 operational lead and 5 reviewers (incl. ops lead)\n- **Terms and Renewal:** Committee members serve for 6-month terms, requiring a renewal process overseen by UNI governance.\n- **Nomination and Election Process:** When this proposal has passed, the 2 week nomination and election process for the remaining members will be kicked off. \n\nThe **Grant Program’s initial team** will be made up of the following individuals:\n\n- **Operational Lead -** [**@bernard**](https://gov.uniswap.org/u/bernard) **(web3 Studios - Crypto-native advisory)** \\\n  Experience: Ex-McKinsey Consultant and Founder of w3s.

Participation in an Accountability Working Group that shipped [Proposal Template 2.0 - Upgrade for Deployments & Agreements](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-template-2-0-upgrade-for-deployments-agreements/19936)\n\nOnce this proposal is approved, the 2-week voting period will be initiated to fill the remaining 3 spots, where individuals interested in becoming reviewers can nominate themselves by responding to the Election Forum post (will be created separately).\n\n\n### (G) Governance\n\nThe UAGP governance aims for transparency, efficiency, and broad community involvement. It outlines mechanisms to ensure fair and balanced decision-making for all stakeholders.\n\n- **Multi-sig:** Committee functions as a 4 of 5 multi-sig\n- **Term Limits and Renewals:** Each committee member serves a term of two quarters (6 months). At the end of each term, the effectiveness and impact of the UAGP will be reviewed by UNI governance.\n- **Grant Allocation:** Proposals to allocate Grants can be initiated by any committee member and will be shared internally to vote on. \n\n\n## Budget and Compensation\n\n**1.1 million (25% of the total airdrop) $ARB tokens are requested for UNI-ARB Grants.** While the vast majority of the funds will be allocated to grants, some operations costs need to be addressed.\n\nAfter reviewing other best-known Grant Programs like [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-aave-grants-dao-renewal/11289) and the [UGP](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17358), we decided to propose the following compensation package for core members:\n\n- Operational Lead: 100 $ARB/hr, capped at 25 hrs/week\n- Review committee: 100 $ARB/hr, capped at 10 hrs/week\n\nBelow, we put down a budget estimation for the next 6 months, considering 3 budget categories: grants itself, compensation and maintenance costs.\n\n**Budget (6 months)**\n\n|                                                         |                  |\n| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |\n| **Category**                                            | **Amount (ARB)** |\n| Expected Grants to Award                                | 924,000          |\n| **Grants Total Budgeted Cost**                          | **924,000**      |\n| Max Compensation                                        | 156,000          |\n| Budget for tooling, subscriptions, and misc             | 20,000           |\n| **Operations Max Budgeted Cost**                        | **176,000**      |\n| **Total UAGP Budget**                                   | **1,100,000**    |\n\n\nWe recognize that workload varies across different phases of the cycle. For instance, the selection phase may require peak capacity, while other stages could be less demanding. As a result, we've estimated an average commitment of 25 hours per week for the operational lead and 10 hours per week for the review committee \n\n## Case studies:\n\nTo better articulate the scope and focus of the UAGP, we've incorporated case studies in response to feedback received from Uni delegates during our iterative process. These case studies aim to make our target projects more tangible and offer insights into what we mean by projects that strengthen the Uniswap-Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n1. ### Li.Fi (Uni RFC [link](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-li-fi-mma-infrastructure-development-for-uniswap/21444))\n\n   1. <ins>Project description</ins>\n\n      1. Advancement of MMA. The Multi-Messaging Aggregation is a bridge-agnostic solution designed for Uniswap to securely relay governance messages from Ethereum to other chains.\\\n         Instead of relying on a single bridge, MMA combines multiple selected bridges into a unified cross-chain framework. A governance message is sent from Ethereum to the destination chain via all these bridges and is deemed valid only if a quorum of these bridges relayed the same message;\n      2.

Protocol Delegate Program\n\nIn our effort to create a well-defined delegate program, we at took a systematic approach. Our initial step involved breaking down the Delegate Program into basic components to better understand its core ideas. Subsequently, we closely examined other successful Delegate Programs like Arbitrum, Optimism, Synthetix Ambassador Council, Rari, and Stader to identify effective strategies.\n\nTo gain deeper insights, we engaged with 6 experts in delegate programs. This allowed us to learn more and incorporate the best industry practices. This collaborative and iterative research led us to develop a robust UNI-ARB Delegate Program.  \n\n\n## Summary\n\n- **Remaining ~1.1 million (25% of the total airdrop) ARB tokens is requested for Governance -** Empowering the committee to actively participate in Arbitrum governance and influence strategic decisions.\n- To ensure effective representation, a **committee of 2 members** will serve as dedicated representatives of the Uniswap community’s interests\n- The **success of the program will be evaluated based on how satisfied the community is, how much the delegates participate in decision-making, and if their choices match Uniswap's values**.\n\n\n## Program Format\n\nTo secure adequate representation, a committee comprising 2 members is instituted to act as committed proponents of the Uniswap community's interests. This committee's sole responsibility is to advocate for Uniswap, guaranteeing unbiased decision-making. The primary aim is to actively participate in Arbitrum governance, enabling the Uniswap community to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of the ecosystem.\n\n\n## Delegate Program Design & Approach\n\nAs previously highlighted, a parallel methodology was employed to ascertain the optimal Program structure. Comprising five fundamental pillars, the primary framework encompasses the entirety of the core process. Find detailed research here [Delegate Program Research](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Idp35yZmHIPMDVg9OGpbWyTDtf7-ko1l/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThese pillars are represented on the following image:\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/bENLJqXuYi_Fch9K1CYSitzoCM_MRll-Ukx1Aa5LNmogiR_Ha1pbPSdzH9XtmJ7L5jUHXHUAOYyIMvkLn7KwS821tJnoF5vD6lfXr5s5FrGt_rzOE7A-oIH0i_Q-OiC25vd7OdIJMQpLkdKf)\n\n\n### (A) Objectives and Criteria\n\nThe Uni-Arb Delegate Working Group will transparently and accountability represent the Uniswap community’s interests in the Arbitrum DAO. Potential responsibilities will include:\n\n- Participation in voting discussions\n- Voting participation through multi-sig\n- Attendance at bi-weekly community calls\n\n\n### (B) Delegates Application Process\n\nThe program holds elections on a semiannual basis. During this time, the community members who participate in Uniswap governance vote to select the delegates who will represent them for the next 6 months.\n\nOne of the WG0 members has been selected based on the criteria listed below, but we invite community members to nominate themselves below to fill the rest of the total multi-sig spots. Self-nomination will happen on this forum post, and the UF will host a Snapshot vote to determine these 2 members.\n\nProspective delegates submit various information about themselves based on the following criteria:\n\n- Strong familiarity and prior experience with DAO governance structures and processes.\n- A demonstrated understanding of both the Uniswap protocol and the Arbitrum protocol, showcasing a comprehensive grasp of the technical aspects.\n- A commitment to being an engaged and participatory delegate, aligned with the declared availability and bandwidth to fulfil the responsibilities effectively.\n- Eligibility requires not currently having any existing delegations within the Arbitrum ecosystem. This ensures a diverse range of perspectives and prevents the concentration of influence.\n\nOnce the proposal is approved and a specific nomination process post is created, members will be asked to make use of the[ official Delegate Statement Template](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-statement-template/31) to fill out the application and post their response on the forum. \n\n**Current committee (part of WG0)**\n\n- **Jun Sun (Uniswap Deployment Accountability Committee, Delegate)** [**@Juanbug**](https://gov.uniswap.org/u/juanbug) Experience: On current Uniswap Deployment Accountability Committee, Led Penn Blockchain governance for 2 years, Delegate at Uniswap, Compound, Optimism, etc; Helped draft, steward, and submit various cross-chain deployment proposals, Co-authored a research paper Deep Diving into Uniswap’s Governance with recommendations on reinvigorating governance activity.\n\n\n### ( C) Election/Voting Process\n\nOnce this proposal is approved, the 2-week voting period will be initiated, where individuals interested in becoming delegates can nominate themselves by following the application process outlined above.\n\n1. Community members then have the opportunity to select their preferred delegate through the Uniswap Governance platform.\n2. Upon successful selection, candidates are obligated to fulfil KYC requirements to proceed with their delegate responsibilities.\n\n\n### (D) Governance\n\n- The commitment to Arbitrum governance spans six months.\n- Full participation in voting discussions is a mandatory expectation for each participant.\n- Maintaining 100% voting participation via multi-signature is a core requirement.\n- The rationale behind the committee's voting decisions will be openly shared through communication threads for both Arbitrum and Uniswap delegates.\n- Active engagement involves attendance at bi-weekly community calls, jointly organised by fellow Arbitrum delegates.\n- Specific details outlining expectations will be communicated directly with committee members subsequent to the conclusion of the voting phase.\n\nThe UADP governance likewise aims for transparency, efficiency, and broad community involvement. It outlines mechanisms to ensure fair and balanced decision-making for all stakeholders.\n\n- **Multi-sig:** Delegate Program functions as a 2 of 3 multi-sig. 2 of the signers will be the 2 delegates and the other will be the grants program operational lead. The operational lead will be there for operational and transition support, and the 2 delegates will be tasked with consistently submitting the votes.\n- **Term Limits and Renewals:** Each committee member serves a term of two quarters (6 months) before being put up for reconsideration.\n\n\n### (E) Voting Record Reflection\n\nWhen it comes to tracking how delegates vote, the current approach, used by different DAOs, involves looking at their voting history during specific times linked to their election cycle. This helps the community decide if they should be re-elected based on how they've voted. However, it can be tough to figure out if their voting really matches the program's main goals, especially when things aren't clear-cut.\n\nTo address this, the UNI-ARB Delegate Program will hold elections twice a year to check if delegates are doing what's expected of them regularly. This way, we can prevent problems and give the community chances to set new expectations over time. The evaluation will be based on how satisfied the community is, how much the delegates participate in making decisions, and if their choices match Uniswap's values.\n\n\n## Budget and Compensation\n\nLike the UNI-ARB grants program, ~1.1 million (25% of the total airdrop) $ARB tokens are requested for the UNI-ARB Delegate program. Due to the nature of delegation technically, the remaining funds in the Arbitrum community wallet will be delegated in an all or nothing transaction. These funds will be delegated to the Delegate Program wallet and will stay in the community wallet; some operational costs will be addressed. Similar to the grant program, we have capped each delegate to a maximum of 10 hrs/week for a 6 month maximum total of $48k, which translates to just under ~50k $ARB. In reality, the final amount should be less. A small portion will also be earmarked as a reserve fund in case legal and similar expenses arise. Please note that until ARB is used as an expense, our goal is to have all of the ARB be self-delegated.\n\n**Budget (6 months)**\n\nBelow, we put down a similar “budget” estimation for the next 6 months. \n\n|                                                                                                                                         |                  |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |\n| **Category**                                                                                                                            | **Amount (ARB)** |\n| ARB left in community wallet for self-delegation (~1 million)                                                                             | 0                |\n| Max Compensation (Will be self-delegated whilst sitting idle)                                                                           | 50,000           |\n| Reserve: Legal expenses if applicable, gas reimbursements, delegation smart contract, etc. (Will be self-delegated whilst sitting idle) | 50,000           |\n| **Total UADP Budget**                                                                                                               | **100,000**    |\n\n\n## End of WG0 Phase 1 and compensation\n\nAs previously agreed upon in the Snapshot vote, our Working Group Zero (WG0) will receive a compensation of $20,000 ARB for their efforts over the last 8-week sprint that will be split equally by its 4 members. This amount will be subtracted from the program's overall budget and will serve as the compensation for the four WG0 members.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThanks to invaluable delegate feedback, our program is aligned to fund projects that strengthen the Uniswap-Arbitrum ecosystem. \n\nUpon successful approval of this proposal, UAGP and the Protocol Delegate Program will initiate a 2-week nomination and election process.\n\nWe're excited to kick this off and sincerely believe that, with the involvement of our delegates, we can set a precedent for streamlined, effective grant programs that make a significant difference.\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- Upon approval of the on-chain vote, funds will be transferred to a multi-sig wallet, co-managed by the named parties and Erin from the UF, to cover contributor compensation.\n- The fund allocation is 2.2 million $ARB, equally divided between Protocol Delegates and the Grants Program Sub-Working Groups.\n- A sum of 20,000 ARB will be reserved for compensating the 8-week time commitment of the WG0 members.\n- Two separate elections will launch after the vote to populate contributor roles in both the Protocol Delegates and Grants Program.\n- The terms for each subgroup will kick off upon election conclusion.\n",

      "title": "Declare canonical deployments of V2",
      "content": "This proposal will add references to canonical implementations of Uniswap V2 to text records on a new subdomain on uniswap.eth.\n\nIf passed and executed, this proposal will call two functions:\n- the first creates the `v2deployments` subdomain by calling `setSubnodeRecord` on the ENS Registry contract and passing it hashed values of the uniswap.eth name and v2deployments subname, as well as the timelock's address and the address of the resolver linked to uniswap.eth\n- the second populates text records by passing the encoded hex data representing 10 separate `setText` calls to a `multicall` function on the resolver. Each `setText` call specifies the network ID of the chain in question as the key and the bridge sender and destination v2Factory contract addresses as the values, separated by a comma (e.g.\n`{\"10\": addr1, addr2}` )\n\nThe code used to derive these values can be found in a Github repo [here](https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/governance-seatbelt/blob/main/sims/v2-subdomain.sim.ts).\n\nA full list of deployment addresses can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I2viBd0SbYs8M83bC3HKvYh_zh8i2_CjMMbMfP9bPSk/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nSimulations of this proposal's successful execution can be found by navigating [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/governance-seatbelt/actions), clicking on the latest successful workflow run and downloading the Uniswap artifact at the bottom of the page.\n\nThe forum discussion around this proposal can be found [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-deploy-uniswap-v2-on-all-chains-with-v3/21799) and has been copied below as well.\n\n## TL;DR\n* The only canonical deployment of Uniswap V2 is on Ethereum mainnet.\n* There is demand for V2-style AMMs on non-Ethereum chains and many V2 forks have been deployed with varying degrees of modification.\n* To the extent that these forks have been modified, they may prove unsafe for users.\n* To the extent that these forks have liquidity, that liquidity could likely have accrued to Uniswap V2.\n* The combination of Uniswap V2 and Uniswap V3 can often provide better execution for small-volume swappers via the Universal Router.\n\n## Introduction\nWhen Uniswap V3’s [Business Source License](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/LICENSE) expired and the code’s license transitioned to [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html), the DAO [created a process](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-post-bsl-cross-chain-deployment-process-creation-of-new-uniswap-eth-subdomain/20961) by which it would declare canonical deployments of the contracts. This process serves to identify instances of the V3 code that are a) not modified and b) owned and controlled by the Uniswap governance contracts. These assurances are meant to provide developers and users with comfort that the code they’re using is safe and any changes to it (to the extent that changes are even possible) will be telegraphed long in advance.\n\nUniswap V2 is governed by the same permissive GPL license but has not been subject to the same DAO-run multi-chain expansion as V3. Instead, it has been forked and deployed under different brand names and across many chains almost continuously since Sushi’s vampire attack in the summer of 2020. These forks may contain modifications to the code, and their ownership structure can range from DAO governance contracts to single-signature wallets. Nevertheless, forks of V2 can garner [significant liquidity and volume](https://defillama.com/protocols/dexes/Base) relative to other AMMs.\n\n## Proposal\nDeploy Uniswap V2 on all chains where there is there is a canonical instance of V3.\n\n## Rationale\nThere are at least three compelling arguments to move forward with this proposal.\n\nFirst, V2 forks have been plagued by hacks that have caused the loss of user funds. The Uniswap V2 contracts have been deployed on mainnet since [May 4, 2020](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc31d7e7e85cab1d38ce1b8ac17e821ccd47dbde00f9d57f2bd8613bff9428396) with no loss of user funds; they can be considered among the most battle-hardened contracts on Ethereum. Canonical versions of the Uniswap contracts can provide DEX users on new chains - swappers, liquidity providers, and developers - with the safety and security for which the protocol is known.\n\nSecond, there is demand for traditional, full-range AMMs on new chains. Uniswap should be in a place to service this demand and continue to grow our user base and brand equity across multiple ecosystems.\n\nThird, integrating Uniswap V2 pools into the Universal Router will help incrementally improve execution quality for applications that already use the Router to allow their users to swap.",

      "title": "Merge with 1 inch exchange, an unstoppable Defi Force",
      "content": "Using 1inch’s new aggregator saves gas over using Uniswap or other DEXs directly.\n26994 Total views\n68 Total shares\nListen to article\n2:31\nNew version of 1inch’s DEX aggregator makes it cheaper than Uniswap\nNews\nJoin us on social networks\n\nThe 1inch team has released the third iteration of its Aggregation Protocol, a tool that routes trade orders across all decentralized exchanges on Ethereum and, as of recently, Binance Smart Chain.\nAdvertisement\nClaim your wallet ID and do crypto on/off-ramp, effortlessly. Ready, set, XGo!\n\nThe Aggregation Protocol calculates the most profitable trade for a given token and size of the order, potentially splitting a large order into several chunks across several decentralized exchanges. Previously, the tool was mostly useful for wealthy traders for whom slippage was an important factor when trading in decentralized finance. The system consumed more gas than using a DEX protocol directly, which meant that the product was unattractive for smaller traders.\n\nThe V3 release introduces gas optimizations that the team claims make the protocol cheaper than using either Uniswap or 0x directly. In tests conducted by the team, the 1inch V3 aggregator was about 10% cheaper in terms of gas than the same trades done via Uniswap, and about 5% cheaper than on 0x. Compared with 1inch V2, gas costs decreased by up to 30%.\nGas cost comparison for a variety of trades, courtesy of the 1inch team.\n\nAnton Bukov, chief technology officer of 1inch, told Cointelegraph that Uniswap is the cheapest protocol to use in terms of gas fees. This resulted in many copycats appearing on Ethereum and other blockchains, the most notable of which is SushiSwap. However, it appears that Uniswap’s trade router is not as efficient as it could be, with Bukov noting:\n\n    “Our router is more effective than theirs. The same goes for SushiSwap and other forks.”\n\nThus, 1inch's router merely replaces Uniswap's while using the same pools, which explains how an aggregator can be cheaper than direct use. The higher effectiveness on Uniswap has been the result of targeted optimizations, Bukov said. Sergej Kunz, CEO of 1inch, added: “We just optimize where we can, sweeping the dust, so to speak, after the other DeFi guys.” This wouldn’t be the first time that 1inch targeted Uniswap in its actions, having recently launched a “vampire airdrop” for active Uniswap users. In this case, however, the targeting makes the most technical sense. Since Uniswap’s codebase is so popular, optimizing for it gives the best return and the most liquidity.\n\nThe new V3 has been already deployed, and it has replaced the previous iteration, which will remain available for use. Switching platforms would require setting new token allowances, which would cost gas. Nonetheless, it appears that the migration could quickly pay for itself.",

      "title": "[Temperature Check] Deploy Friendly Fork of Uniswap V3; ZERO Protocol on Polygon zkEVM",
      "content": "## Proposal summary\nIn light of the Uniswap DAO’s vote to deploy on the Polygon zkEVM (Tally | Uniswap Proposal 10), we propose a partnership between the Uniswap DAO and Zero Protocol. This collaboration centers on the concept of a “friendly fork.”\n\nA friendly fork refers to the creation of a new version of an existing protocol that retains a cooperative and synergistic relationship with the original. Unlike contentious forks, which often lead to competitive divergence, a friendly fork seeks to align with the parent protocol.\n\nIn this context, the below proposal will outline how the partnership entails integrating Zero Protocol as a friendly fork of Uniswap on the Polygon zkEVM chain. Zero Protocol will utilize Uniswap’s established backend infrastructure as its foundational engine and be granted access to ecosystem funded tooling. To align interests, the DAO will benefit from the open R&D taking place and receive a 10% token allocation detailed below. This approach resonates with Uniswap V2’s historical challenges of dealing with competitive forks and this scenario into an opportunity.\n\n# Overview of proposal\n## Description:\n\nWe propose a visionary partnership between the Uniswap DAO and Zero Protocol, focusing on the integration of Zero Protocol as a friendly fork of Uniswap on the Polygon zkEVM chain. This collaboration draws inspiration from Uniswap V2’s history and aims to transform past challenges into future opportunities. By leveraging this partnership, Uniswap can harness the advantages of Zero Protocol while ensuring that both projects benefit mutually and contribute to the evolving DeFi landscape.\n\n## What is Zero:\nZero Protocol introduces an innovative ve(3,3) decentralized exchange (DEX) concept that aims to optimize the efficiency and sustainability of liquidity for protocols and liquidity providers on Polygon zkEVM. Utilizing Uniswap V3 as its core trading engine, Zero Protocol distinguishes itself by building unique infrastructure and features around this foundation.\n\nZero is a direct fork of the existing Retro project on Polygon POS, which already relies on Uniswap V3 for trading. Using Angle Lab’s Merkl SaaS, we have been able to create a unique emissions distribution system which allows integration of multiple Active Liquidity Managers via Zero’s ALM Marketplace for liquidity management, a first in the DeFi space.\n\n## Since Retro’s launch on July 27th:\n\nTVL is at an ATH of ~$15M\nVolume from most recent epoch ~$20M\nAverage voter APR for veRETRO holders - ~150%\n$RETRO market cap has more than tripled from $2M at launch to over $7M today\nA straight 1:1 fork of UniV3 will also be the engine behind Zero Protocol (with fee changes made)\n\nRetro is currently the most advanced version of any ve(3,3) AMM in the entire DeFi space.\n\nRetro has grown very quickly into the third-largest fork of Uniswap V3, as measured by Defillama, underscoring the potential impact of Zero and showcasing its relevance within a new up-and-coming chain like Polygon zkEVM, which has already passed a vote by the Uniswap DAO.\n\n## What is a friendly fork?\nA friendly fork refers to a situation in which a protocol is duplicated, creating a new version that maintains a positive and collaborative relationship with the original project. Unlike contentious forks that often result in divergent and competitive paths, a friendly fork aims to work in harmony with the parent project, often for the purpose of introducing improvements, innovations, or addressing specific use cases. The intention behind a friendly fork is to foster collaboration, open-source development, and a sense of shared goals, rather than creating a rift or competition between the two versions.\n\nExamples of friendly forks formed previously in DeFi ecosystem:\n\nBalancer <> BeethovenX\n\nLiquity <> Gravita\n\nPlatypus <> Hummus\n\nThena <> Retro\n\nWhile a friendly fork prioritizes collaboration and shared success, it does not fall under Uniswap DAO and its governance.\n\n## Tokenomics\n\n1600×900 106 KB\nContext and Learning from Uniswap V2:\nUniswap V2’s success and widespread adoption led to numerous forks without providing significant returns to Uniswap or its community. The expiration of Uniswap V3’s business license presents a unique opportunity to learn from this history and establish a more rewarding framework. Our proposal envisions a symbiotic approach where Uniswap V3 and Zero Protocol can share in the successes of their joint ventures, ensuring that value is generated for both parties.\n\n## Revenue Generation and Token Allocation:\n\nTo cement the mutually beneficial nature of this partnership, we propose that Uniswap receives a percentage of the initial token allocation of Zero Protocol. This enables Uniswap to participate in governance decisions and generate revenue through voting, ensuring active engagement and sustained collaboration. This aligns with the spirit of reciprocity and incentivizes both projects to contribute to each other’s growth.\n\n## Timeline:\n\nWe suggest a structured proposal timeline spanning 3 weeks to ensure transparency, community engagement, and thoughtful decision-making. The timeline would be broken into 3 phases:\n\nPhase 1 Forum Post\n\nPhase 2 Temperature Check\n\nPhase 3 Onchain Vote\n\nWe plan on launching Zero on Polygon zkEVM with Polygon’s support at the end of September.\n\nMotivation for Uniswap\nUniswap V2 undeniably emerged as a groundbreaking protocol within the DeFi space, a sentiment echoed by the surge in its adoption and the remarkable number of forks that it has catalyzed over the last few years. The resilience and appeal of Uniswap V2’s technology are evidenced by the fact that it continues to maintain the highest Total Value Locked (TVL) combined across all forked categories. This achievement underscores its robustness and adaptability, with numerous projects leveraging its core mechanics to create innovative variations within the decentralized exchange landscape.\n\nHowever, despite the proliferation of Uniswap V2 forks and their significant TVL, there has been a missed opportunity for the Uniswap community and UNI token holders to capitalize on this phenomenon. While the DeFi ecosystem has witnessed a multitude of derivative projects utilizing Uniswap’s core technology, there has been a lack of active engagement from Uniswap and its stakeholders in reaping the benefits of these forks.\n\nThis narrative presents a pivotal juncture as Uniswap V3 takes center stage with the business license expired. By learning from the past and recognizing the value inherent in its technology, the Uniswap DAO has the potential to revolutionize its approach to forks. Rather than allowing forks to flourish independently, there is a strategic avenue for Uniswap V3 to foster a symbiotic relationship with these derivatives. Through the introduction of a friendly fork status, the Uniswap DAO can transform forks into partners, encouraging them to contribute to the Uniswap ecosystem while simultaneously capitalizing on value capture allowing for independent forks to collectively reap rewards.\n\nBy strategically collaborating with these forks, Uniswap V3 can capture value from the derivatives built on its technology while fostering a stronger sense of community and collaboration within the DeFi landscape. This proactive approach aligns with the vision of maximizing the potential of Uniswap’s technology and positioning it as a trailblazer in the evolution of decentralized exchanges. Ultimately, taking this transformative step can lead to a more dynamic and prosperous future for Uniswap and its stakeholders.\n\n## Partner Details\nAbout:\n\nStabl Labs FZE. \n4Stabl Labs is the parent organization of\n\nRetro Finance\n\nretro.finance\nRetro 3\nTrade your favourite tokens with low-slippage and efficient pricing.

O. Box No. 42944\n\nSharjah, UAE\n\n## Delegate Sponsor\n“GFX Labs is sponsoring the proposal because we believe it is a strong opportunity for the DAO to solidify a process for friendly forks and continue Uniswap’s multi-chain expansion.”\n\nAdditional information for cross-chain deployments\nWe believe this is the right moment for ZERO (UniV3 friendly fork) to deploy on Polygon zkEVM. ZERO will be the liquidity layer for Polygon zkEVM, bootstrapping liquidity for new and existing projects on chain or migrating to zkEVM.\n\nThe friendly fork to Polygon zkEVM would not only capitalize on the compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts but also benefit from the scalability features offered by Polygon’s zkEVM. Polygon zkEVM, an open-source ZK-Rollup, delivers a hassle-free user experience with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. It flawlessly integrates with pre-existing smart contracts, developer tools, and wallets. Leveraging the strength of ZK proofs, Polygon zkEVM significantly reduces transaction expenses and substantially boosts transaction speed, while also adopting Ethereum’s robust security. As previously mentioned, a proposal has already been passed 10 signaling intent to move to this chain.\n\n## Benefits:\n\nLaunching Zero, a direct fork of Retro, on Polygon zkEVM grants additional exposure and credibility to both protocols - allowing the total to be greater than the sum of its parts.\nUsing a proven, successful ve(3,3) model on zkEVM at this early stage of the chain’s lifetime allows Zero Protocol to capture a significant portion of liquidity and volume on the chain.\n## Engagement Terms\nUniswap DAO acknowledges Zero Protocol on Polygon zkEVM as “friendly fork” of Uniswap v3 and as such is considered an auxiliary member of the Uniswap Ecosystem. Zero Protocol would be afforded access to all existing and future tooling for Uniswap v3 which has been granted by UF previously; i.e OkuTrade, Seedle.finance and Uniswap.fish.\n\nIn return for the cooperation and exclusive friendly fork status on Polygon zkEVM, Zero will allocate 10% of the initial token allocation to the Uniswap DAO.\n\n-10% of initial supply will be sent to the Uniswap treasury address upon launch as a veZERO veNFT locked for 2 years (5,000,000 veZERO). This includes a 30% veZERO rebase for the first 90 days, and a 15% rebase thereafter to avoid dilution of the veZERO position.\n\n## Project Financing\nZero Protocol’s commitment and intention is to embark on this partnership without seeking any funding from Uniswap. Zero Protocol’s willingness to bear all the costs associated with the launch and operation on zkEVM showcases the dedication and belief in the potential of this collaboration.\n\nThis self-sufficient approach not only underscores the sincerity of their engagement but also emphasizes their long-term vision for building a thriving ecosystem on Polygon zkEVM. Such an approach aligns with the spirit of mutual growth and innovation, setting a strong foundation for a partnership that places collaboration and shared success at the forefront.\n\n## Risk Profile\nZero will be a fork of retro which has an Open Zeppelin audit\n\n\n[blog.openzeppelin.com](blog.openzeppelin.com)\nRetro/Thena Audit\nThe scope of this audit relates to a collaborative work between two protocols from different chains: Retro (Polygon) and Thena (BNB Chain).

      "content": "## Summary\nThis [joint proposal](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temp-check-combined-liquidity-incentivization-proposal/21545) combines the [Gauntlet](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-gauntlet-dynamic-incentive-optimization-for-uniswap-v3-on-arbitrum/21426) and [Gamma Strategies’](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-gamma-strategies-distribute-at-least-1-3-of-arb-airdrop-as-liquidity-incentives/21345) responses to an [RFP published in May 2023](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/request-for-proposals-arb-distribution/21287). It was written with input from the Angle, Arrakis, Open Block Labs, and 0xPlasma teams; the DefiEdge and BrincX teams have reviewed and approved and will join as liquidity managers. All active liquidity management protocols are welcome to review and participate.\n\nBroadly speaking, Gauntlet will perform the analysis to determine which pools receive how much $ARB rewards and for what duration. Angle Protocol will use its Merkl root solution to distribute those incentives to all liquidity providers, including those who provide to an LP NFT or to active liquidity managers.\n\n## Proposal Details\nThis proposal passes three messages through the Arbitrum Delayed Inbox, each of which calls the transfer function on the ARB token.\n\n- 15,000 ARB will be sent to OpenBlock Labs for work described below\n- 150,000 ARB will be sent to Gauntlet for work described below\n- 1,835,000 ARB will be sent to a 3/4 multisig for distribution of rewards via Angle's Merkl contracts, as described below.\n\nSigners on that multisig include:\n\n- [Erin Koen](https://twitter.com/eek637), [Uniswap Foundation](https://twitter.com/uniswapfnd)\n- [BP](https://twitter.com/BP_Gamma), [Gamma Strategies](https://twitter.com/gammastrategies)\n- [Matt Dobel](https://twitter.com/mattdobel), [Gauntlet](https://twitter.com/gauntlet_xyz)\n- [Pablo Veyrat](https://twitter.com/pablo_veyrat), [Angle Protocol](https://twitter.com/AngleProtocol)\n\nA description of the Delayed Inbox can be found [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging). A more human-readable description of the functions called in this proposal can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/erin-koen/7c87d5ed66a627f67b08ec824846fea9). Simulated results of this proposal passing will be available [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/governance-seatbelt/actions) by navigating to the latest successful Governance Check workflow and downloading the Uniswap artifact at the bottom of the page.\n\n## Methodology\nGauntlet has built an optimization engine which takes in both on and off-chain data to generate recommendations for incentive distributions which aims to generate long-term benefits to the incentivizing protocol. In the case of Uniswap, it will aim to choose parameters which will maximize expected future protocol benefit per $ of incentive spent. Market data used for their models include historical price trajectories, competitor data, and user level cohort data.\n\nAngle Protocol developed Merkl which is based on an off-chain script that computes the rewards for all LPs of these pools according to specific preferences. The script aggregates onchain LP NFTs and active manager LP positions and records eligible rewards based on a uniform criteria. It then compresses this information into a Merkl root and posts on-chain allowing LPs to claim their rewards.\n\nARB held in the multisig will be used to fund a Merkl contract for distribution to eligible liquidity providers on a cadence determined by Gauntlet's recommendations. For in-depth discussions on Gauntlet's methodology and the Merkle distribution solution please see the proposals linked above.\n\n## Liquidity Manager Analytics\nAdditionally, OpenBlock Labs will leverage their data intelligence platform to deliver comprehensive analytics for the liquidity management protocols participating in Uniswap’s incentive management program on Arbitrum. These analytics will offer detailed insights into the user base of each liquidity manager, assessing the distribution of their liquidity providers (LPs) and capturing important attributes regarding their behavior. The analysis will further evaluate the stickiness of these LPs, thereby gauging the effectiveness of the rewards system. Armed with this data, liquidity management protocols could tweak their parameters to increase their efficacy.\n\n## Details\nDistribution amount: 2M $ARB   \nGauntlet Fee: 150k ARB  \nOpenBlock Fee: 15k ARB  \nAngle Merkle Fee: 3% of distributed ARB   \nTotal ARB used for liquidity incentives: (2m -150k - 15k * .97) = 1,779,950  \nLiquidity Manager fees: Vary, charged to depositors Duration: 8 months",

Canonical versions of the Uniswap contracts can provide DEX users on new chains - swappers, liquidity providers, and developers - with the safety and security for which the protocol is known.\n\nSecond, there is demand for traditional, full-range AMMs on new chains. Uniswap should be in a place to service this demand and continue to grow our user base and brand equity across multiple ecosystems.\n\nThird, integrating Uniswap V2 pools into the Universal Router will help incrementally improve execution quality for applications that already use the Router to allow their users to swap.\n\nProcess\nThis process will be very similar to the first vote to [declare V3 canonical implementations](https://vote.uniswapfoundation.org/proposals/38).

Angle Protocol will use its Merkl root solution to distribute those incentives to all liquidity providers, including those who provide to an LP NFT or to active liquidity managers.\n\n## Proposal Details\nThis proposal passes three messages through the [Arbitrum Delayed Inbox](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4dbd4fc535ac27206064b68ffcf827b0a60bab3f), each of which calls the transfer function on the ARB token.\n- 15,000 ARB will be sent to OpenBlock Labs for work described below   \n- 150,000 ARB will be sent to Gauntlet for work described below   \n- 1,835,000 ARB will be sent to a 3/4 multisig for distribution of rewards via Angle's Merkl contracts, as described below. \n  \n\nSigners on that multisig include:  \n\n- [Erin Koen](https://twitter.com/eek637), [Uniswap Foundation](https://twitter.com/UniswapFND) \n- [BP](https://twitter.com/BP_Gamma), [Gamma Strategies](https://twitter.com/GammaStrategies) \n- [Matt Dobel](https://twitter.com/mattdobel), [Gauntlet](https://twitter.com/gauntlet_xyz) \n- [Pablo Veyrat](https://twitter.com/pablo_veyrat), [Angle Protocol](https://twitter.com/AngleProtocol)\n\nA description of the Delayed Inbox can be found [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging). A more human-readable description of the functions called in this proposal can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/erin-koen/7c87d5ed66a627f67b08ec824846fea9). Simulated results of this proposal passing will be available [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/governance-seatbelt/actions) by navigating to the latest successful Governance Check workflow and downloading the Uniswap artifact at the bottom of the page.\n\n## Methodology\nGauntlet has built an optimization engine which takes in both on and off-chain data to generate recommendations for incentive distributions which aims to generate long-term benefits to the incentivizing protocol. In the case of Uniswap, it will aim to choose parameters which will maximize expected future protocol benefit per $ of incentive spent. Market data used for their models include historical price trajectories, competitor data, and user level cohort data.\n\nAngle Protocol developed Merkl which is based on an off-chain script that computes the rewards for all LPs of these pools according to specific preferences. The script aggregates onchain LP NFTs and active manager LP positions and records eligible rewards based on a uniform criteria. It then compresses this information into a Merkl root and posts on-chain allowing LPs to claim their rewards.\n\nARB held in the multisig will be used to fund a Merkl contract for distribution to eligible liquidity providers on a cadence determined by Gauntlet's recommendations. For in-depth discussions on Gauntlet's methodology and the Merkle distribution solution please see the proposals linked above.\n\n## Liquidity Manager Analytics\nAdditionally, OpenBlock Labs will leverage their data intelligence platform to deliver comprehensive analytics for the liquidity management protocols participating in Uniswap’s incentive management program on Arbitrum. These analytics will offer detailed insights into the user base of each liquidity manager, assessing the distribution of their liquidity providers (LPs) and capturing important attributes regarding their behavior. The analysis will further evaluate the stickiness of these LPs, thereby gauging the effectiveness of the rewards system. Armed with this data, liquidity management protocols could tweak their parameters to increase their efficacy.\n\n## Details\n- Distribution amount: 2M $ARB \n- Gauntlet Fee: 150k ARB \n- OpenBlock Fee: 15k ARB \n- Angle Merkle Fee: 3% of distributed ARB Total ARB used for liquidity incentives: (2m -150k - 15k * .97) = 1,779,950 Liquidity \n- Manager fees: Vary, charged to depositors Duration: 8 months",

      "content": "[Link to snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x2a122241d608b92e605e3e2ece355e97c5691ac0448da5653025e2c929628625)\n\n# Background\nThe Celo deployment of the Uniswap Protocol is currently connected to the mainnet governance contracts via Optics. The Optics bridge is not currently approved by the Uniswap Bridge Assessment Committee and is not on a path to be approved. To that end, we put forward this proposal to change the cross-chain messaging protocol used to interact with the Celo deployment of Uniswap from Optics to Wormhole.\n\n# Process\nDeploy a new Wormhole bridge receiver contract on Celo. This contract 9 was deployed on July 5th, 2023 and its configuration was verified by the Wormhole team and the Uniswap Foundation. Change the owner of the UniswapV3Factory contract on Celo from the existing Optics bridge receiver to the new Wormhole bridge receiver A governance vote will be required to make this change. Per the normal governance process, this RFC will remain open for a week and the Celo and Wormhole teams will answer any questions that arise. After a week, a Snapshot poll will be posted. Pending a successful Snapshot, an on-chain vote will be instantiated.\n\nUpon completion of this procedure, subsequent governance messages destined for Celo will be transmitted via the UniswapWormholeMessageSender [0xf5F4496219F31CDCBa6130B5402873624585615a](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf5F4496219F31CDCBa6130B5402873624585615a) and received on Celo by the wormholeReceiverContract [0x0Eb863541278308c3A64F8E908BC646e27BFD071](https://celoscan.io/address/0x0Eb863541278308c3A64F8E908BC646e27BFD071).\n\n# Conclusion\nIn alignment with the standards endorsed by the Uniswap DAO’s cross-chain bridge assessment team, this proposal recommends migrating the Celo UniswapV3Factory contract owner from the Optics bridge to the Wormhole bridge. This shift will make use of the existing Optics governance bridge to implement the transition and ensure that the cross-chain governance mechanism aligns with the assessment team’s recognized structure.\n\n# Update: Celo as a Layer Two\nWe recognize Celo’s move to an L2 on Ethereum. However, given Optics’ impending phase-out before Celo completes this transition, it’s important we proceed with the proposed switch to the Wormhole bridge rather than postponing until after the transition and then proposing a bridge migration. After Celo’s transition to an L2, we may reassess and propose a further migration to the canonical bridge.\n\n# Proposer\n0x39762F8AF694666Ed5e8123eF655F8B0CdeEB365",

      "title": "[Temperature Check] Deploy Uniswap V3 on Scroll",
      "content": "## Proposal Summary\n\nFollowing Uniswap’s successful deployment on the Scroll testnet, the Scroll team is proposing that the Uniswap DAO recognizes Scroll's upcoming mainnet deployment of Uniswap V3 as the official deployment.\n\nPoint of Contact: [ Lea Schmitt, E-mail: lea@scroll.io]\n\n## Overview of our Proposal\n\nWe propose that the Uniswap DAO recognizes Scroll's upcoming mainnet deployment of Uniswap V3 as the official, canonical deployment. Uniswap V3 has already been deployed to Scroll’s testnet, and the Uniswap router has processed over 1.8M transactions there.\n\n* Scroll is a bytecode equivalent zk-rollup, a native zkEVM scaling solution for Ethereum.\n* Scroll is an open-source project developed in collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation Privacy and Scaling Explorations organization. It was built with the community, for the community.\n* Our community ethos and vision are aligned with Ethereum. We are committed to a secure, decentralized, censorship-resistant, and efficient future that Ethereum offers through our plans to decentralize Scroll sequencers and provers.\n\nWe propose that Uniswap will showcase this by integrating Scroll into its user interface.\n\n## Motivation\n\nUniswap being deployed on multiple Ethereum L2s is integral for encouraging competition and diversity of technical solutions to scale Ethereum. We believe that Uniswap's community and the ecosystem that Scroll strives for are closely aligned. Both projects are building trustless, decentralized, and secure financial infrastructure that is accessible to anyone, regardless of merit or location. Deploying to Scroll offers many benefits, including significant user savings, an expanded user base, capturing the zkEVM market, and fostering L2 native innovation.\n\n* This deployment positions Uniswap as an early mover and captures a rapidly growing market as the Ethereum ecosystem gradually shifts to zkEVMs.\n\n* Uniswap on Scroll will integrate closely with Scroll's rapidly growing ecosystem. Dozens of projects have committed to deploying on our mainnet, and many are deployed on our testnet: AAVE, Lens, the Graph, Covalent, Safe, and Etherscan to name a few. Given the excitement around Scroll and current usage of our testnet, we expect hundreds of projects to deploy on our mainnet post-launch.\n\n* Importantly, Uniswap on Scroll will propel L2 DEX innovation. We are on the brink of uncovering L2 native use cases that have not been feasible on Ethereum L1. Scroll will bring new developers and ecosystem integrations to Uniswap.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nDeployment of Uniswap on Scroll will:\n* Increase Uniswap TVL, targeting $100M within two months of deployment Grow * Uniswap order volume\n* Enable listing of new assets on Uniswap that are unique to Scroll\n\nMoreover, Scroll will bring its dedicated and expanding developer community to Uniswap, thereby boosting the growth of Uniswap's developer community.\n\nThe best way to measure success for Uniswap on Scroll is to focus on TVL and transaction volumes. We think that Scroll can deliver an additional $100M of TVL to Uniswap within two months of launch.\n\n## Protocol Security\n\nZK-Rollup is currently the most secure Layer 2 scaling solution. On the premise of inheriting the security of Ethereum, it relies exclusively on cryptography rather than unreliable crypto-economics.\n\nScroll has a trustless Layer 1 <> Layer 2 canonical bridge, which supports arbitrary message delivery. The bridge is part of the roll-up mechanism, verified by the smart contract and the zkEVM, which is much more secure than relayer-based bridges.\n\nSecurity is the first priority for us. Scroll implements the EVM, which is well-specified and battle-tested. Additionally, we are working with two external auditing companies to audit our bridge code, and we have an in-house security team that continuously reviews our codebase. \n\nWe plan to launch with a timelock delay and a security council to control privileged functions and contract upgrades. Finally, shortly after launch, we will introduce distributed sequencer operators.\n\n## Deployment\n\nAfter the Temperature Check, we will move forward with deploying Uniswap V3 on our Scroll mainnet, following which we will submit the Governance Proposal with the addition of the deployed contract addresses. Since we are fully compatible with EVM, it is effortless to deploy on Scroll. We expect the full deployment will take a few hours.\n\nThe approval of this proposal by Uniswap governance will lead the following Uniswap v3 contracts [to be filled in after deployment] to be deemed as the canonical Uniswap deployment on Scroll. This deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3-deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended to reference the Uniswap v3 Factory contract on Scroll following the process outlined here: [Post-BSL Cross-chain Deployment Process & New Uniswap.eth Subdomain](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-post-bsl-cross-chain-deployment-process-new-uniswap-eth-subdomain/20878).\n\n## Timeline\n\n* July 2023 - Request for Comment (RFC) - https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-deploy-uniswap-v3-on-scroll/21651\n* August 2023 - Temperature Check\n* September 2023 - UniV3 Contract Deployment\n* September 2023 - Bridge Deployment\n* September 2023 - Governance Proposal",

      "title": "Deploy Uniswap V3 on Linea",
      "content": "Due to the unforeseen movement in delegation, the original proposal was unexpectedly cancelled. However, this current proposal is presented with no changes to its content, objectives, and outcomes.\n\n## Point of Contact:\nConsensys\nGFX Labs\n\n## Proposal Overview\nConsensys is seeking a Uniswap V3 deployment for Linea’s mainnet launch, looking to further integrate Uniswap with the Consensys product ecosystem (MetaMask, Infura, Linea, et. al). A key aspect of Linea’s value proposition is its synergistic relationship with ConsenSys products. Establishing Uniswap as a dominant DEX on Linea would encourage more trading volume for the protocol and strengthen ties to current Consensys product users.\n\n### Motivation\nLinea’s testnet has impressively handled more than 47 million transactions. Many of these transactions are part of the Linea Voyage quest, a crucial initiative designed to help stress-test the network. This exercise aids in identifying potential issues and performance impediments before transitioning to Linea mainnet.\n\nMoreover, Linea is aligned with developers throughout the broader ecosystem via our relationships with MetaMask, Infura, and Truffle, emphasizing our commitment in serving developers, protocols, and builders.\n\n\nUsers will conveniently find Linea natively supported in the MetaMask network dropdown list, and it will support the full range of MetaMask curated experiences. These experiences include On/Off Ramp, MetaBridge, MetaMask Swaps, Portfolio dApp, and MetaMask SDK - all of which could leverage the Uniswap protocol.\n\n## About Linea\nLinea aims to be a Type 2 zkEVM 1 and achieve EVM-equivalence, handling native EVM bytecode for proving and verification. This allows for the execution of Solidity smart contracts and enables developers to build while using familiar tools and infrastructure at extremely low switching costs. The network does not use transpilers or custom compilers on bytecode. By taking the compiled bytecode directly from solidity, we significantly reduce the surface area risk for bugs and hacks.\n\nLinea seeks innovation, pushing the boundaries of the Web3 space while maintaining top security and full EVM compatibility as top priorities. One (of the many) things worth mentioning is Linea’s full support of EIP-4337 (Account Abstraction). Working with key stakeholders, the network already uses the single-entry-point contract and runs multiple networks of bundlers and paymasters services.\n\n### Vortex - Lattice-Based SNARKs\nWhat is particularly exciting about Linea is its ability to consolidate transactions and submit proofs to the Ethereum mainnet using a novel prover mechanism. This process enhances throughput and minimizes transaction fees while maintaining the inherent security of the Ethereum network.\n\nVortex , a cryptographic primitive under development at ConsenSys, aims to increase the performance of Linea. It leverages a novel type of zkProof called a recursive aggregation proof. This is based on Ring-SIS, a well-known premise from lattice-based cryptography. This proofing system enables the batching of transactions to increase the network’s throughput while reducing fees. Linea also employs zk circuits to conduct computations. These cryptographic circuits facilitate secure and efficient computations.\n\n\n## Market Adoption\nSince the inception of Ethereum, ConsenSys was established to become the most potent proponent of decentralization worldwide. We believe that networks such as Ethereum can empower humanity to reach greater heights. With our experience handling web3 infrastructure, wallets, developer tools, public goods, and more, we are confident in our ability to steward Linea to complete decentralization and openness.\n\nLinea is the result of more than 20 months of R&D from our award-winning research team that has released and maintains successful projects in the zk space like the GNARK library. Linea represents advancements in the zkEVM realm and the general field of cryptography. With the Linea network being incubated via Consensys, adoption will be encouraged through existing Consensys products and partnerships.\n\n\n\nSome of these integrations include but are not limited to:\n\n- MetaMask - Largest Web3 wallet, easy user onboarding with default integration.\n- Infura - Simplified deployment lets developers ship faster and scale with the confidence of 99.9% uptime.\n- Truffle - Build, test, debug, and deploy Solidity smart contracts with tools like Truffle, Hardhat, and more.\n- Besu - Optimized execution for zkEVM transactions using Ethereum battle-tested components.\n- Lastly, nearly all EVM-specific development tools are Linea compatible.\n\n### Decentralization Roadmap\nLinea is committed to actively pursuing decentralization. Over the following year, the Linea team plans to implement decentralizing features. Examples include introducing a DAO, decentralized sequencers and prover systems.\n\n## Benefits for Uniswap\nThere are many benefits to a Uniswap deployment on Linea. In the following sections, we highlight our top three…\n\n- Early Establishment in the Linea AMM Market\n- Increased Volume through MetaMask Swaps Integration\n- Cross Promotion\n\n\n### Early Establishment in the Linea AMM Market\nObserving Uniswap market share across crucial Layer 2 solutions reveals that the protocol enjoys several advantages x-chain. These include a strong community, brand recognition, and, most importantly, the first-mover advantage.\n\nTotal value locked (TVL) of Uniswap across significant roll-up ecosystems:\n\n- Arbitrum - 316.12M\n- Optimism - 82.5M\n\nWe anticipate that Uniswap will replicate its success in capturing market share on Linea, and we also hope that this deployment will serve as a model for the DAO on how Uniswap will perform with all upcoming L2/zkEVM launches over the next 6-8 months.\n\n### Increased Volume through Swaps Integration\nMetaMask Swaps is an aggregation product built natively into MetaMask. Across all integrated chains, as of last week, Swaps had an average weekly volume of ~$133M. Uniswap is consistently the largest leveraged dex of this weekly volume, executing ~58%, or $77.1M of trades.\n\nMost of this volume is directed through Ethereum; however, observing comparable L2 deployments shows that Swaps contributed nearly 100M of volume to Arbitrum since integration.\n\nProducts like Swaps leverage many service providers, and only a few of them will be deployed on Linea day 1, providing Uniswap the opportunity to capture an even bigger market share of L2 volume produced from the product.\n\n### Cross Promotion\nAnother benefit for the protocol is the cross-promotion between Consensys and Uniswap, and to double down on the shared mission of contributing to the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem. The team plans to promote the network’s usage and the protocols that operate on it. This, combined with utilizing a recognized deployment of Uniswap, will aid in establishing Uniswap on Linea and in the greater ecosystem.\n\n## Additional Information\n### Costs and Incentives\nConsensys will cover all deployment costs, and is willing to contribute any engineering resources required for the deployment.\n\n### Cross Chain Messaging\nThe Linea team operates and maintains a canonical Open Messaging Service (OMS). The OMS allows for messages to pass to and from Ethereum & Linea. The Ethereum network verifies smart contracts on the L1 that enforce a valid state on Linea.\n\n### Security Considerations\nThe OMS will be operated in-house. The design implements a relayer and leverages the rollup to maintain state/security.\n\n\n### Success Criteria\nAlthough it is difficult to quantify success criteria, we can confidently state that establishing Uniswap as an early, dominant DEX is a priority.\n\nThe overarching success of the Uniswap deployment will be determined through increasing key DeFi metrics that include TVL, Volume, Users, and Swaps. Upon deployment, we will provide a dashboard to monitor Uniswap’s progress and assess market performance.\n\n### Proposer Details\nConsenSys is a leading Ethereum and decentralized protocols software company.

      "title": "Uniswap v3 on Base",
      "content": "Proposal Motivation\n-------------------\n\nWe at [she256](https://twitter.com/she_256) are submitting this proposal to create community agreement on a canonical deployment of Uniswap v3 on Base. The [temperature check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xb643c2ccb468812901c9490dbb31c5aada0140e83d0f6ce30e04fc7a237748e8) for this proposal passed with **49M UNI (100%) YES** votes and **95 UNI (0%) NO** votes. The proposal stakeholders were agreed upon in the RFC.\n\nBase is an open-source, developer-friendly L2 EVM blockchain, built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack. Base is being incubated inside of Coinbase and will serve as both a home for Coinbase's onchain products and an open ecosystem for permissionless development. Coinbase has partnered with Optimism throughout the inception and launching of Base to help realize the[  Optimism superchain vision](https://app.optimism.io/superchain). Base mainnet is currently [open for developer access](https://base.mirror.xyz/hwNwqXHVoLlO8s4DZppog4DfGvM34tigaDjOWuEJQfY), with docs available at[  docs.base.org](https://docs.base.org/), and will be available for general access in early August.\n\nBase is aiming to have day-one support for Uniswap v3. We believe there is strong potential for Base to generate high TVL and mobilize an influx of new users to Uniswap because of (1) Base's plan to natively integrate with Coinbase products, which have tens of millions of users, (2) the 50+ dapps/protocols that have committed to deploying on Base, and (3) good signal around initial usage of the Base testnet.\n\nBase, Optimism, and How Uniswap Benefits\n----------------------------------------\n\n### Optimism and The Superchain Thesis\n\nOptimism is the [second largest Ethereum L2 by virtue of TVL and volume](https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvl), created with the purpose of helping Ethereum scale. Built using the OP Stack, Optimism relies on a fraud-proof scheme to reliably submit batched transactions to Ethereum L1. For the past ~two years, Ethereum's modular structure has [gained tremendous traction](https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvl) from users due to more favorable txn speed and lower network costs. However, L2s are in and of themselves silos. The limitations of cross-chain interactions between different monolithic chains are apparent--but such issues, albeit to a lesser degree, are still present on rollups. For instance, the execution layers for the most popular L2s remain separate, with the shared aspect being a common layer for consensus, settlement, and data availability, the Ethereum L1. This is where the [Superchain](https://www.optimism.io/superchain) thesis comes into play, aiming to create a standardized architecture for L2 development.\n\nThe OP Stack is currently undergoing a significant scalability improvement by introducing the concept of a Superchain. This new system will create a network of chains that share various features such as bridging, upgrades, decentralized governance, and a communication layer, all of which will be built on the existing OP Stack. The goal of this new system is to merge the current Optimism Mainnet and other chains--built using the OP Stack--into a single unified network of OP Chains, thereby taking a significant step towards bringing scalable and decentralized compute to the world. The Superchain currently stands as an ideal in the development phase, not a materialized product. Developing a robust system of OP Chains is likely to take a couple of years.\n\nAs the Superchain vision takes hold, it will strive to integrate siloed L2s into an interoperable and composable system, allowing for seamless communication between individual chains built using the OP Stack as well as a simplistic process for developing L2s, with the backend complexities being abstracted from developers' purview. Commoditizing the nature of L2s frees builders to concentrate on perfecting the specific value proposition of their chain as opposed to meddling with the overhead that arises with constructing blockchains from scratch. The OP Stack enables for a more plug-and-play system where builders can incorporate specific \"modules\" for customizing their chains. Individual OP Chains will have the ability to select their customized data availability module, while simultaneously remaining connected to the other swath of OP Chains which may have opted in for an alternative data availability module. Hence, the Superchain is a healthy blend between a shared, standardized development architecture and a robust set of individualizing modules for the specific aspirations of individual OP Chains.\n\n### Coinbase and The Rise of Base\n\n[Coinbase has joined](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/2jk3D1Y8-hid8YOCUUa6yXmsyzNCYYyFJP0Nhaey9x0) as both a core developer of the OP Stack and a new L2 chain built on the OP codebase through its deployment of Base. As a core developer, Coinbase will collaborate with OP Labs in contributing to the Optimism Collective's mission of extending the OP Stack as a public good. Moreover, as a chain, Base will commit a portion of its transaction fee revenue to the Optimism Collective treasury.\n\nThe collaboration's immediate goal is to upgrade Optimism Mainnet, Base, and other L2s to an initial Superchain structure with shared bridging and sequencing. In the long term, the shared vision is for the Superchain to become a vast network that maximizes interoperability, shares decentralized protocols, standardizes core primitives, and funds the public goods that make it all possible. \n\nBase is an Ethereum L2 network striving to offer a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly environment for building onchain dapps, using the open-source OP Optimism stack. In pursuit of this goal, Base will serve as both a home for Coinbase's onchain products as well as an open platform for any developers to permissionlessly contribute towards. Development on Base in general will require a source for liquidity provision, and as is the case with the other L2s, Uniswap composes the largest portion of that market. \n\n[Four key principles](https://base.mirror.xyz/jjQnUq_UNTQOk7psnGBFOsShi7FlrRp8xevQUipG_Gk) have shaped Base that will also continue to guide its approach:\n\n1.  **Bridges > Islands.** Base is being designed to facilitate easy and secure access to Ethereum L1, other L2s, and other L1 ecosystems such as Bitcoin, Solana, and Cosmos. As a bridge for users into the cryptoeconomy, it will provide an easy-to-use, default onchain experience with access to products on other chains. Coinbase intends to initiate Base to be interoperable with other chains while continuing to support as many chains as possible across the Coinbase product suite.\n\n2.  **Open-source.** As Base is built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack, it is freely available and fully open source. Coinbase is joining as the second core dev team working on the OP Stack, ensuring it is a public good available to everyone. This toolkit is an open platform that anyone can contribute to, fork, and extend to help the cryptoeconomy scale.\n\n3.  **Decentralization.** Decentralization is essential for the cryptoeconomy to remain open, global, and accessible to everyone. With the increased resources that Coinbase brings to the OP Stack, Base is expected to progress from a [Stage 0 to Stage 1](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1609209529706872833?s=20) rollup in 2023--and to a [Stage 2 rollup](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571) in 2024.\n\n4.  **Robust.** Base aims to be an open ecosystem initially bootstrapped with Coinbase products, users, and assets. Coinbase is working with the broader community to bring the chain to life, and counts a significant group of Day 0 builders and projects that will contribute to making Base a robust ecosystem.\n\nAs highlighted in the [Mulitchain Uniswap](https://blog.uniswap.org/multichain-uniswap) blog post, we share the belief that users \"should access Web3 on chains with properties that are important to them.\" Since Base's core goal is to provide a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly L2 environment for building onchain dapps we feel it fitting for Uniswap to be live from day-one. The potential for Uniswap to capture the inflow of new users from the off-chain world is a promising opportunity for the DEX to reach a new audience. As of December 2023, Coinbase had nearly [$80B of assets under custody, 80% higher](https://messari.io/report/pump-up-the-base) than the onchain TVL at the time. Across v2 and v3, Uniswap only has [$4B in TVL](https://defillama.com/protocol/uniswap). \n\n### Developers and Ecosystem\n\nThere has been strong initial engagement with developers on Base, as seen below with the preliminary list of partners and metrics. In addition, an unofficial Base ecosystem account has mapped out the Base ecosystem in [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/UniverseOnBase/status/1655594580870578176).\n\nIn its first week, Base saw [18K developers deploy 55K smart contracts](https://base.mirror.xyz/rA5v_0BTc5AwmZdnui7ku82FzF1aTE6TJ_3vds9ymBc) on testnet. Since the Base testnet launch on 2.23.23, metrics show [2M accounts created and 17.5M transactions](https://base-goerli.blockscout.com/stats), and over 1 million addresses holding a[  Base Builder NFT](https://goerli.basescan.org/token/0xAC6564F3718837CaAdd42Eed742d75c12b90a052) for participating in[  Base Quests](https://quests.base.org/).\n\nIn addition, Base has seen impressive retention, with the highest number of unique wallet users ([~70,000](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/hess/base-retention-BUjJWB)) returning to the Base chain for subsequent transactions within one day, representing [43% of the total users](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/hess/base-retention-BUjJWB). The users, in this case, are likely mostly developers, given that these metrics are from a testnet, which gives a promising outlook for the activity that will be seen on Base mainnet. \n\nSuccess Criteria\n----------------\n\nA successful deployment of Uniswap on Base would result in Uniswap becoming the de facto DEX for Base upon launching. Some specific indicators of success include the following:\n\n-   **Increased TVL:** Base aims to integrate seamlessly into the Coinbase ecosystem (products + users), which creates an opportunity to introduce many net new users to Uniswap, in addition to existing users who utilize Uniswap on other chains.\n\n-   **Security and Scalability:** Base leverages the underlying security of Ethereum to enable confident on-ramps onto Base from Coinbase, Ethereum L1, and other interoperable chains.\n\n-   **Developer Empowerment and Integration:** Base has focused on [its builder community](https://base.mirror.xyz/rA5v_0BTc5AwmZdnui7ku82FzF1aTE6TJ_3vds9ymBc), which will ideally include Uniswap.  Developers are also better enabled to join the Coinbase ecosystem, with seamless Coinbase product integrations, easy fiat onramps, and powerful acquisition tools. Because of these offerings, we believe Base will attract a wide range of dapp developers. Many of these dapps may utilize Uniswap or bring more users into the ecosystem, who may then use Uniswap. For this reason, we believe that adding a new chain that is focused on developers will grow the pie and be a net positive for the ecosystem and Uniswap.\n\n-   **Efficiency and Cost:** Base offers full EVM compatibility at a fraction of the cost of Ethereum mainnet and is committed to pushing forward the developer platform with features including gasless transactions for dapps, simple developer APIs for account abstraction, and secure build environments for multichain applications. This should help create a Uniswap user experience and developer opportunity that is not possible on Ethereum L1.\n\n-   **Values Alignment:** Base is open source, built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack. It aims to contribute toward the vision of creating a standard, modular, rollup agnostic Superchain[  powered by Optimism](https://base.mirror.xyz/H_KPwV31M7OJT-THUnU7wYjOF16Sy7aWvaEr5cgHi8I). Thus driving greater accessibility, efficiency, and transparency in the ecosystem in alignment with Uniswap Foundation core initiatives.\n\nConflict of Interest Declaration\n--------------------------------\n\n-   Anika (member of she256) works on the Base engineering team at Coinbase. She will abstain from voting on this proposal in her role at she256.\n\n-   Kendra (member of she256) is on the Uniswap Accountability Committee for Deployments. She will recuse herself from any Committee actions relating to this proposal.\n\nDeployment Details\n------------------\n\nThe approval of this proposal by Uniswap governance will lead the stated Uniswap v3 contracts to be deemed as the canonical deployment on Base. As is the case with all canonical v3 deployments, this deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended to include the reference to the stated v3 contracts on Base.\n\n**Deployed Contracts Information (completed by GFX Labs):**\n\n[v3CoreFactoryAddress](https://basescan.org/address/0x33128a8fC17869897dcE68Ed026d694621f6FDfD#code)\n\n[multicall2Address](https://basescan.org/address/0x091e99cb1C49331a94dD62755D168E941AbD0693#code)\n\n[proxyAdminAddress](https://basescan.org/address/0x3334d83e224aF5ef9C2E7DDA7c7C98Efd9621fA9#code)\n\n[tickLensAddress](https://basescan.org/address/0x0CdeE061c75D43c82520eD998C23ac2991c9ac6d#code)\n\n[nftDescriptorLibraryAddressV1_3_0](https://basescan.org/address/0xF9d1077fd35670d4ACbD27af82652a8d84577d9F#code)\n\n[nonfungibleTokenPositionDescriptorAddressV1_3_0](https://basescan.org/address/0x4f225937EDc33EFD6109c4ceF7b560B2D6401009#code)\n\n[descriptorProxyAddress](https://basescan.org/address/0x4615C383F85D0a2BbED973d83ccecf5CB7121463#code)\n\n[nonfungibleTokenPositionManagerAddress](https://basescan.org/address/0x03a520b32C04BF3bEEf7BEb72E919cf822Ed34f1#code)\n\n[v3MigratorAddress](https://basescan.org/address/0x23cF10b1ee3AdfCA73B0eF17C07F7577e7ACd2d7#code)\n\n[v3StakerAddress](https://basescan.org/address/0x42bE4D6527829FeFA1493e1fb9F3676d2425C3C1#code)\n\n[quoterV2Address](https://basescan.org/address/0x3d4e44Eb1374240CE5F1B871ab261CD16335B76a#code) \n\n[swapRouter02](https://basescan.org/address/0x2626664c2603336E57B271c5C0b26F421741e481#code)\n\nTimeline\n--------\n\nThis proposal has passed the RFC and temperature check phases. The relevant Uniswap v3 contracts have also been deployed on the Base chain. If this onchain vote passes, this deployment will be officially recognized as a canonical v3 deployment through an amendment to the v3deployments.uniswap.eth subdomain. Thereafter, Uniswap Labs is left with the task of handling the front-end integration updates and including Base to the auto router--this final step is not subject to the DAO's discretion and is handled entirely by Uniswap Labs, a separate entity from DAO.",

      "title": "[Temperature Check] Deploy Uniswap v3 on Fantom",
      "content": "**Proposal Summary**\nBlockchain@Columbia, in conjunction with the Fantom and Axelar Team, are proposing to deploy Uniswap V3 on Fantom Chain. Given the BSL expiry, it is crucial for Uniswap to establish market share in other ecosystems. Deployment on Fantom would be beneficial to both Uniswap and Fantom. \n\n**Overview of Fantom**\nFantom Chain is a highly scalable and secure smart-contract platform designed to enable rapid deployment of dApps. Powered by its unique Directed Acyclic Graph framework and an advanced consensus mechanism, Fantom offers fast, secure, and low-cost transactions. Its innovative architecture has attracted numerous projects and developers.\n\n**Motivation**\nAs an industry leader, Uniswap has established a strong presence in the DeFi space. In order to maintain its competitive edge, Uniswap must continue to adapt and expand its reach to other blockchain networks. This strategic move will capitalize on current market opportunities and strengthen Uniswap's position in the DeFi landscape.\nAxelar is chosen for a number of reasons:\n1. The Axelar Network boasts a decentralized Proof of Stake protocol, multiple layers of security features, and the ability to further customize security for Uniswap, if needed. This ensures a robust and secure bridge solution for Uniswap governance.\n2. Axelar Network is reliable and has capacity to handle large-scale projects. The Axelar Network has been live for over a year, integrating more than 30 chains with 70 validators through its stack, processing over $1.8 billion in volume, and integrating with major DEXs, wallets, L1/L2, stablecoins, and other projects in the industry.\n3. Axelar offers customization options for Uniswap, such as non-upgradable contracts, or contracts governed by Uniswap delegates or UNI token holders. Additionally, Axelar's network can be upgraded following delegated proof-of-stake consensus, ensuring continuous improvements and adaptability.\n4. Axelar's General Message Passing capability enables developers building on one chain to call any function on any other connected chain, ensuring complete composability across Web3.\n5. Axelar's security model combines a decentralized permissionless network, engineering best practices, and application-level security add-ons to offer robust security for Uniswap's deployment on Fantom.\n\n**Outlook**\n\tWhile Fantom’s time in the spotlight has somewhat passed since “DeFi Summer”, the ecosystem still boasts a significant amount of TVL, hovering around $450 million for the majority of the past year with steady growth (DeFiLlama). There is a clear demand for decentralized exchanges on Fantom as four of the top ten protocols are decentralized exchanges, so there’s no doubt that Uniswap will be the leading DEX while also facilitating swaps for currently unavailable pairs. \n\tAdditionally, the Fantom Foundation has consistently worked to reduce the staking requirements for validators from 3.175m FTM in 2021 to 500,000 FTM. As the requirements needed to validate the network decreases, more users will be able to participate in the validation process.\n\tFantom Chain's dedication to the Ethereum ecosystem is evident in its interoperability efforts, developer resources, and focus on driving the growth of decentralized finance. The Fantom team is also committed to fostering collaboration with Ethereum through Axelar Network to enable smooth asset transfers within the two ecosystems. We are convinced that deploying Uniswap on Fantom Chain offers numerous advantages to both Uniswap Labs and its users. \n\tWe estimate that 30% of the current DEX volume on Fantom would be routed to Uniswap should deployment occur. DEX volume on Fantom is available on DeFiLlama. Uniswap would receive an estimated $30-40 million in volume per week based on the data above as well as deployment on an highly-compatible, low cost chain to test new products and attract users.  \n\n**Engagement Terms**\nThe deployment and its costs will be borne by the Fantom Foundation and Axelar. As such, no grants or subsidies will be offered to Uniswap. Axelar and Fantom will handle the backend deployment of the smart contracts; however, Uniswap will need to handle the frontend. \n\n**Bridge Security**\n\n_Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing?_\n-Yes, arbitrary message passing was described in the Axelar white paper in January 2021, and Axelar released its General Message Passing (GMP) capability to mainnet in April 2022. For example, GMP enables developers building on one chain to call any function on any other connected chain. (We use the word “function” to encompass both smart contracts at the application layer and functions built at the protocol layer, as in Cosmos, for example.) That means complete composability across Web3.\n-Like all Axelar functions, General Message Passing relies on a permissionless validator set (delegated proof-of-stake) for security and a decentralized protocol that handles routing and translation.\n\n_Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?_\nRobust security comes from (a) the right design, (b) engineering practices, and (c) application-level security add-ons:\n\n(A) The Design: A decentralized permissionless network with a many-to-many communication model. The decentralized and permissionless model has the best practical security guarantees as it encourages diverse validator deployments, incentivizes validators to guard their keys, promotes good behavior, and punishes bad behavior.\n-Axelar is the full-stack decentralized transport layer. At the core, it is powered by delegated proof-of-stake consensus to validate cross-chain messages. Applications can instantiate additional validation logic across connected paths 3 that may be governed by the application token, permissioned set, light-client, zk proofs, or other available technologies. Our approach is to:\n(a) Offer the best-in-class security via decentralization as the default that solves most use cases for developers.\n(b) Allow developers to customize security as needed.\n-The Axelar network itself comprises a validator set responsible for maintaining the network and executing transactions, running the Cross-Chain Gateway Protocol, a multi-party cryptography overlay that sits on top of a Layer-1 blockchain. \n-Axelar Gateways are effectively smart contracts that connect the Axelar network to its interconnected external chains. Validators monitor Gateways for incoming transactions, which the validators READ. They then reach a consensus on the validity of that transaction and, once agreed, WRITE to the destination chain’s Gateway to execute the cross-chain transaction.\n-The validators and Gateways compose the core infrastructure layer. It’s important to note that relaying across Axelar and its interconnected networks is completely permissionless. This guarantees that no one can censor user transactions and delivers 100% liveness guarantees (assuming the interconnected networks and the Axelar network are running). If relayers are down, the user or anyone else can post transactions, themselves. If one of the interconnected networks is halted or undergoing an upgrade, the packets are just queued up at the network layer and can subsequently be posted (or re-posted) when the networks are back up.\n-Proof-of-stake decentralized design at the core - Axelar is built using battle-tested delegated proof-of-stake consensus with a diverse and dynamic validator set that is open to all.\n-To further decentralize the network, cross-chain messages are approved if they’re authorized via the quadratic voting rule. That is, the voting power of each validator is equivalent to the square root of their stake. A threshold of validators (currently 60%), weighted by the square root of the stakes, must collectively co-authorize every cross-chain request. With quadratic voting, as validators accumulate stake, it gets harder for them to accumulate voting power.\n-Amplify stake security - With Interchain Security available in the Cosmos ecosystem in the coming months, one network can “borrow” the security of other networks. This would allow it to increase the stake used for validation on the network, making any economic attack much more difficult. We also have plans to allow ETH holders to contribute to Axelar’s security, via the restaking model that Eigenlayer introduced recently.\n\n(B) Engineering and Operational Practices\n-Key rotations on the network - Validators of the Axelar network maintain keys that allow them to co-authorize cross-chain requests, similarly to how they co-authorize every block on the blockchain. \n-Continuous unit tests & end-to-end tests through the stack - Continuous unit tests and end-to-end tests help discover vulnerabilities and bugs early in the pipeline.\n-Audits and bug bounties (see above).\n\n(C) Application-Level Security Add-Ons\n-Customize security - Additional paths can be secured by deploying additional validator sets, light-clients, and/or zero-knowledge proofs when available. We think this will be the best instantiation for the Uniswap community: leverage the robust Axelar network for all default traffic. If there is a highly valuable/sensitive transaction, utilize the additional UNI elected validator set for co-signing. See the Appendix for more details on how we propose customizing security for Uniswap.\n-Rate limits - The Gateways and the Axelar network have a rate-limiting function, which limits how much of each asset can be transferred in a given time interval.\n\nSitting atop the validators and Gateways are Axelar services and APIs that enable developers to access the tools and infrastructure enabled by those validators and Gateways. These services and APIs do not add any security assumptions.\n\n_Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?_\nA majority of Axelar validators attest to messages that pass from Ethereum to a destination chain. The voting threshold is 60%, based on the validator’s quadratic stake (current stake distribution: Validators | Axelarscan). An adversary who can corrupt 60% of voting power can pass fraudulent messages. The adversary could try to corrupt enough servers to do this, but mechanisms such as key rotations & rate limits minimize the potential of these attacks.\n\n_What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?_\n-Axelar validators get slashed on the Cosmos SDK level, the same way that validators of any other Cosmos chains get slashed for misbehavior.\n-There is a penalty for validators who don’t maintain sufficient uptime. When a validator doesn’t vote on enough cross-chain events, they’re penalized with a loss of stake and rewards.\n-Validators who misbehave significantly (double signing blocks, not participating for a long period of time) get jailed.\n\nWithin the TM consensus rewards, rewards slashing rules are set as follows:\n-Validators will lose the TM Consensus rewards if they lose liveness and get jailed if they don’t participate for a longer duration.\n-Validators need to sign 50% of the blocks in every 35,000-block window.\n-Given a block time of five seconds, this corresponds to maintaining total liveness for at least one day in every two-day window.\n-They lose 0.01% of rewards per block for downtime and 2% for double signing blocks.\n\nIf the validators lose liveness for more than 50% of the window, then they are locked (“jailed” in Cosmos terminology, forbidden from rejoining the validator set) for two hours (about 1,440 blocks), after which they would need to unlock themselves. Axelar network implements an unbonding period of seven days.\n\n_Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?_\n-Yes, the Axelar network code has been audited over 30 times and continues to go through continuous and rigorous audits. \n-There is also a $2.25 million bug bounty program on Immunefi.\n-Axelar network and contracts are all open-source to encourage white-hat revisions\n\n**Future Alterations**\nOnce a cross-chain deployment method is finalized in the future, we wholeheartedly support changing current deployment mechanisms to fit the new process. However, given the urgency of this proposal, we believe that the currently proposed deployment with Axelar is needed. \n\n**Timeline**\nAfter the completion of the on-chain vote, Axelar will handle Uniswap V3 smart contract deployments on Fantom while Uniswap Labs handles the front-end integration. This is estimated to take ~4-6 weeks with audits.",

      "title": "[Temperature Check] Deploy Uniswap v3 on Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM)",
      "content": "## Proposal Motivation\n\nWe [Michigan Blockchain](https://twitter.com/UMichBlockchain) are submitting this proposal to initiate the deployment of Uniswap v3 onto the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), a programmable EMV-compatible environment built over the Filecoin blockchain and its robust system of decentrally stored data. Considering Filecoin is the de facto storage provider in the blockchain space, it is valuable for Uniswap to attain market share in its data economy early on. We therefore believe that an FVM deployment is an opportune manner by which Uniswap’s multichain vision is furthered.\n\nOne of the reasons that peer to peer storage systems like IPFS are difficult to maintain is because the parties involved in the network are not incentivized to expend resources to maintain the integrity of the stored data. Decentralization is not an inherent method for providing a superior storage product. That is why Filecoin was created. The Filecoin blockchain’s economic incentive structure between storage providers (SPs) and users creates a market for SPs to store and maintain data integrity over time. However, the robustness of that data economy must also be high for sustaining data storage in the long run. If SPs, for instance, do not have access to creatively expand their service provision business or efficiently put their capital to work, then their incentive to partake in the Filecoin/IPFS system is reduced. \n\nThe FVM’s launch on March 14, 2023 effectively made Filecoin programmable through the introduction of smart contracts. Programmability allows for the creation of dapps that work in tandem with the stored data. If an ecosystem of, say, DeFi applications can be built on the FVM to supplement the efforts of SPs, then the data economy is strengthened many fold. Invariably, DEXs are a rudimentary building block of a crypto economy, and just as they enable higher degrees of liquidity for numerous L1s, they will be able to provide a similar facility for Filecoin’s data economy. Uniswap would, for instance, grant SPs the ability to swap between $FIL tokens that they earn as a reward for providing their services.\n\n## A Primer on Filecoin\n\n### Filecoin, IPFS, and Storage Helpers\n\nFilecoin is the premier decentralized storage protocol built on top of the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). The two entities are distinct but often incorrectly conflated as one. Although Protocol Labs founded–and continues to aid in the development of–both Filecoin and IPFS, the two systems serve distinct purposes. IPFS is not a blockchain but a set of modular data addressing and networking protocols. Using IPFS, files are fragmented, hashed, and distributed amongst numerous nodes. Data distribution in a network of SPs around the world makes the system more secure than a centralized cloud storage system. Centralized servers reduce the control an individual has over their data and increases the surface area for information exploits. The hashed nature of the data allows for a secure manner of locating files using a technique known as content-addressing, which differs from the traditional location-addressing method (HTTP) used by most of the Internet. Even though data on IPFS are stored off-chain (i.e. on hardware devices), they are secure due to the combination of content-addressing and a verifiable zk-proof system present on Filecoin.\n\nIPFS’ system allows for enterprise data centers to pledge their idle network resources like bandwidth and disk drive to secure others’ data. Such a storage system, however, does not function effectively without an incentive structure in place. Monetarily rewarding the entities involved in the file storage and retrieval processes enables the creation of a micro economy, where storage providers (SPs) are paid by users to store their data. Filecoin is the blockchain-based economic layer built on top of IPFS that allows for the exchange of $FIL tokens between SPs and users. Without Filecoin’s incentive structure, the storage provision capabilities of IPFS would not function or scale. Filecoin also allows for the development of a competitive data storage market, where storage prices are more attractive than those issued by incumbent centralized SPs like AWS or Microsoft Azure. By tapping the long tail of data centers, costs for storage, compute, and retrieval can be brought dramatically below the cloud incumbents.\n\nData storage and retrieval is also simplified through the help of third-party storage helpers. These entities aid in abstracting away much of the protocol’s dealmaking complexities between SPs and users. Instead of interacting directly with Filecoin and IPFS, developers can leverage storage helpers’ API services. Dapps can therefore receive decentralized storage benefits without much hassle. This is one of the reasons why the active number of deals, including those from [Filecoin Plus](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/how-storage-works/filecoin-plus/), rose from [~16M to ~33M](https://observablehq.com/@starboard/chart-daily-active-deal-count-statistics) in 2023 alone. A notable storage helper called NFT.storage allows anybody using NFTs to decentrally store and retrieve their NFT metadata and images on IPFS and Filecoin. Used by platforms like OpenSea and Magic Eden, the helper has experienced over [122M total uploads, accounting for 304.13 TB of data on Filecoin](https://nft.storage/stats/).\n\n### Proof of Storage\n\nSPs are only paid when they submit two types of cryptographic proofs to the Filecoin protocol: Proof of Replication (PoRep) & Proof of Spacetime (PoSt). Collectively, these two proofs can be thought of as a means by which storage is proved. PoRep is initially conducted upon the SP receiving the users data, and it requires the SP to generate a public proof signifying that the hashed data is securely stored and replicated on a hardware device. It is a way to make sure that SP does not lie about the fact that they are storing the given data. PoSt is a process that occurs every 24 hours–it requires SPs to prove that a designated parcel of data is still stored (space) and able to be retrieved by the user whenever they desire (time). Daily spacetime proofs allow for the protocol to ensure data continuity. Currently, the network maintains [12.11 EiBs](https://dashboard.starboard.ventures/capacity-services) of storage space, provided by [over 4,000 SPs](https://medium.com/tldrfilecoin/state-and-direction-of-filecoin-summarized-4b90c59e3cca).\n\n## The Filecoin Virtual Machine\n\n### How the FVM is Enabling a Data Economy\n\nDue to the V18 Hygge Filecoin network upgrade in March 2023, smart contract programmability was introduced to the Filecoin blockchain. The FVM is a WASM-based execution environment that has the potential to enable programmable markets for storage, retrieval, compute, and Filecoin subnets, each catering to a new custom service. Foreign runtimes like the EVM are able to function on top of the FVM, allowing for developers to seamlessly program applications on Filecoin. Over time, multiple runtime environments will be introduced to the FVM, but the primary runtime that is currently available is the EVM. Solidity programmers can therefore utilize familiar tools like Hardhat, Foundry, Truffle, and Metamask to create EVM-based dapps on Filecoin, with the Filecoin complexities being abstracted from the developers’ purview. And so, with the incorporation of smart contracts, Filecoin is addressing the L1 market from the vantage point of actually being able to store users’ data; most other blockchains simply do not have the simultaneous storage capabilities and programmability.\n\nSupport for numerous VMs will enable FVM to better interact with alternative L1s and increase liquidity transmission between previously siloed chains. Programs deployed on the EVM, MoveVM, JS/SES, or any other VMs will be able to fork onto the FVM. This proposal seeks to create a fork of the Uniswap v3 code and deploy it on the FEVM.\n\nThe FVM’s goal is to harbor a robust data economy, and this can be accomplished by launching various services, enabled by smart contract development. Below are some examples: \n\n***Perpetual Storage:*** Applications that allow for the automatic renewal of a deal between a client and the SPs, allowing for a continuous, long-term storage agreement that requires minimal manual intervention on behalf of the client. \n\n***Data DAOs:*** The FVM does not have direct access to the underlying data, but it does allow for that data to be governed. DAOs can be created around a dataset, accessible by a consortium of individuals as opposed to a single entity. Token-gated structures can also allow for better dataset access controls, like determining which entities can read, write, or read+write to a dataset. \n\n***Data Monetization:*** Data can also be tokenized, where certain tokens stand for a portion of a dataset, prescribing a market-determined value to the data underlying the respective tokens. This way, data itself can be collateralized and traded. Users of certain applications can also monetize their data by selling their profile NFTs, which give access to underlying consumer data, to marketing or analytics agencies.\n\n***DeFi:*** A crypto economy is not complete without basic financial applications like DEXs and lending protocols. The “Proposal Motivation” section underscores why DEXs like Uniswap are important. Below are more examples of DeFi initiatives in the crypto data economy. Each of these has the ability to further enhance Uniswap’s position on Filecoin by routing liquidity between these various applications.\n\nOne example of a DeFi function is staking. Just like Lido and Rocket Pool allow ETH holders to secure the Ethereum blockchain without running a validator node with high computational and economic fixed costs, a similar model can be applied to Filecoin. A liquid staking protocol on FVM can therefore establish a profit-sharing system between SPs and $FIL holders. An alternative means for SPs to gather more $FIL for collateral purposes is by borrowing the $FIL from a lending protocol–of course, such dapps can also be built on the FVM. Token-gated features on lending dapps can also be enabled to allow for cost-effective $FIL borrowing. If an SP, for instance, has built a track record of reliable data storage with no slashing history, they can be issued an NFT by the lending protocol that gives the SP access to undercollateralized $FIL loans. Since larger amounts of data and longer storage periods require more $FIL, it is important to have seamless access to the token. This example illustrates the utilization of both DeFi and identity on the FVM.\n\nLending platforms and staking protocols are simply incomplete without a DEX like Uniswap. So, to provide actors in the Filecoin ecosystem with a place to easily swap between assets like $FIL and $stFIL (this asset doesn’t exist yet–just an example), there must be an AMM present. Other creative applications can also be built using Uniswap in the backend for automated asset swaps; the opportunities are very expansive.\n\n### Ecosystem Development\n\nSince storage is a vital part of every project, Filecoin has attracted clients of all colors from both the crypto native and web2 world. [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), a public repository of data from documents and websites to movies and songs, utilizes Filecoin to safeguard its information. The [USC Shoah Foundation](https://sfi.usc.edu/about) also leverages Filecoin to store important historical accounts about genocides like the Holocaust. As for other blockchains, Filecoin is used by various L1s and L2s for data storage, largely through storage helpers like NFT.storage.\n\nAs of Q1 2023, the Filecoin ecosystem has [484 projects](https://messari.io/report/state-of-filecoin-q1-2023), with a trend of initiatives surpassing the initial project phase and into the accelerator stage and beyond. The Filecoin Foundation recently hosted a hackathon called [Space Warp](https://spacewarp.fvm.dev/#ie) containing over $400k of prizes and accelerator grants for promising projects building on the FVM. This was one of the initiatives to bootstrap the FVM ecosystem. Nearly two months after the FEVM’s launch, there have been [808 contracts deployed](https://dashboard.starboard.ventures/fvm) with over [130k transactions](https://dashboard.starboard.ventures/fvm) on the platform. Active contract users have also increased [184.5%](https://dashboard.starboard.ventures/fvm) since April 1st. Such activity is revitalizing the condition of Filecoin from a stance of developer interest. Over the next few months smart contract deployment is projected to increase heavily, a large shift from the past two years, during which the Filecoin [active developer count fell by 11%](http://developerreport.com).\n\nOverall, it is evident that the Filecoin Foundation, Protocols Labs, and their partners are aggregating resources to attract more users to the FVM. The growth thus far has been strong–but it is too early to call it a success. This Uniswap deployment, however, will certainly be another method to attract both developers and users to the FVM.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal has passed the RFC phase without contention. The current temperature check is purposed for assessing the DAO’s desire to deploy on the FVM. If this Snapshot passes, we will commence the finalization of the relevant stakeholders mentioned in the RFC. The temp check is only measuring the community's desire to deploy on the FVM--it is not a vote on the stakeholder list. Stakeholder debates are to take place here on the Uniswap Forums. After the community is content with the stakeholders and has shown a desire to deploy on the FVM (decided by the temp check), the v3 contracts will be deployed on the destination chain. Thereafter, an onchain vote will commence as soon as the contracts have been audited.",

      "title": "[Temperature Check] Deploy Uniswap v3 on Base",
      "content": "## **Proposal Motivation**\n\nWe at [she256](https://twitter.com/she_256) are submitting this proposal to the community for the deployment of Uniswap v3 on Base, upon Base mainnet launch.\n\nBase is an open-source, developer-friendly L2 EVM blockchain, built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack. Base is being incubated inside of Coinbase and will serve as both a home for Coinbase's onchain products and an open ecosystem for permissionless development. Coinbase has partnered with Optimism throughout the inception and launching of Base to help realize the [Optimism superchain vision](https://app.optimism.io/superchain). Base testnet is currently live, with docs available at [docs.base.org](https://docs.base.org/), and the mainnet launch is tentatively scheduled for summer 2023.\n\nBase is aiming to have day-one support for Uniswap v3. We believe there is strong potential for Base to generate high TVL and mobilize an influx of new users to Uniswap because of (1) Base's plan to natively integrate with Coinbase products, which have tens of millions of users, (2) the 50+ dapps/protocols that have committed to deploying on Base, and (3) good signal around initial usage of the Base testnet.\n\n## **Base, Optimism, and How Uniswap Benefits**\n\n### **Optimism and The Superchain Thesis**\n\nOptimism is the [second largest Ethereum L2 by virtue of TVL and volume](https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvl), created with the purpose of helping Ethereum scale. Built using the OP Stack, Optimism relies on a fraud-proof scheme to reliably submit batched transactions to Ethereum L1. For the past ~two years, Ethereum's modular structure has gained tremendous traction from users due to more favorable txn speed and lower network costs. However, L2s are in and of themselves silos. The limitations of cross-chain interactions between different monolithic chains are apparent–but such issues, albeit to a lesser degree, are still present on rollups. For instance, the execution layers for the most popular L2s remain separate, with the shared aspect being a common layer for consensus, settlement, and data availability, the Ethereum L1. This is where the [Superchain](https://www.optimism.io/superchain) thesis comes into play, aiming to create a standardized architecture for L2 development.\n\nThe OP Stack is currently undergoing a significant scalability improvement by introducing the concept of a Superchain. This new system will create a network of chains that share various features such as bridging, upgrades, decentralized governance, and a communication layer, all of which will be built on the existing OP Stack. The goal of this new system is to merge the current Optimism Mainnet and other chains–built using the OP Stack–into a single unified network of OP Chains, thereby taking a significant step towards bringing scalable and decentralized compute to the world. The Superchain currently stands as an ideal in the development phase, not a materialized product. Developing a robust system of OP Chains is likely to take a couple of years.\n\nAs the Superchain vision takes hold, it will strive to integrate siloed L2s into an interoperable and composable system, allowing for seamless communication between individual chains built using the OP Stack as well as a simplistic process for developing L2s, with the backend complexities being abstracted from developers' purview. Commoditizing the nature of L2s frees builders to concentrate on perfecting the specific value proposition of their chain as opposed to meddling with the overhead that arises with constructing blockchains from scratch. The OP Stack enables for a more plug-and-play system where builders can incorporate specific \"modules\" for customizing their chains. Individual OP Chains will have the ability to select their customized data availability module, while simultaneously remaining connected to the other swath of OP Chains which may have opted in for an alternative data availability module. Hence, the Superchain is a healthy blend between a shared, standardized development architecture and a robust set of individualizing modules for the specific aspirations of individual OP Chains.\n\n### **Coinbase and The Rise of Base**\n\n[Coinbase has joined](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/2jk3D1Y8-hid8YOCUUa6yXmsyzNCYYyFJP0Nhaey9x0) as both a core developer of the OP Stack and a new L2 chain built on the OP codebase through its deployment of Base. As a core developer, Coinbase will collaborate with OP Labs in contributing to the Optimism Collective's mission of extending the OP Stack as a public good. Moreover, as a chain, Base will commit a portion of its transaction fee revenue to the Optimism Collective treasury.\n\nThe collaboration's immediate goal is to upgrade Optimism Mainnet, Base, and other L2s to an initial Superchain structure with shared bridging and sequencing. In the long term, the shared vision is for the Superchain to become a vast network that maximizes interoperability, shares decentralized protocols, standardizes core primitives, and funds the public goods that make it all possible.\n\nBase is an Ethereum L2 network striving to offer a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly environment for building onchain dapps, using the open-source OP Optimism stack. In pursuit of this goal, Base will serve as both a home for Coinbase's onchain products as well as an open platform for any developers to permissionlessly contribute towards. Development on Base in general will require a source for liquidity provision, and as is the case with the other L2s, Uniswap composes the largest portion of that market.\n\n[Four key principles](https://base.mirror.xyz/jjQnUq_UNTQOk7psnGBFOsShi7FlrRp8xevQUipG_Gk) have shaped Base that will also continue to guide its approach:\n\n1. **Bridges \\> Islands.** Base is being designed to facilitate easy and secure access to Ethereum L1, other L2s, and other L1 ecosystems such as Bitcoin, Solana, and Cosmos. As a bridge for users into the cryptoeconomy, it will provide an easy-to-use, default onchain experience with access to products on other chains. Coinbase intends to initiate Base to be interoperable with other chains while continuing to support as many chains as possible across the Coinbase product suite.\n\n2. **Open-source.** As Base is built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack, it is freely available and fully open source. Coinbase is joining as the second core dev team working on the OP Stack, ensuring it is a public good available to everyone. This toolkit is an open platform that anyone can contribute to, fork, and extend to help the cryptoeconomy scale.\n\n3. **Decentralization**. Decentralization is essential for the cryptoeconomy to remain open, global, and accessible to everyone. With the increased resources that Coinbase brings to the OP Stack, Base is expected to progress from a [Stage 0 to Stage 1](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1609209529706872833?s=20) rollup in 2023–and to a [Stage 2 rollup](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571) in 2024.\n\n4. **Robust.** Base aims to be an open ecosystem initially bootstrapped with Coinbase products, users, and assets. Coinbase is working with the broader community to bring the chain to life, and counts a significant group of Day 0 builders and projects that will contribute to making Base a robust ecosystem.\n\nAs highlighted in the [Mulitchain Uniswap](https://blog.uniswap.org/multichain-uniswap) blog post, we share the belief that users \"should access Web3 on chains with properties that are important to them.\" Since Base's core goal is to provide a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly L2 environment for building onchain dapps we feel it fitting for Uniswap to be live from day-one. The potential for Uniswap to capture the inflow of new users from the off-chain world is a promising opportunity for the DEX to reach a new audience. As of December 2023, Coinbase had nearly [$80B of assets under custody, 80% higher](https://messari.io/report/pump-up-the-base) than the onchain TVL at the time. Across v2 and v3, Uniswap only has [$4B in TVL](https://defillama.com/protocol/uniswap).\n\n### Developers and Ecosystem\n\nThere has been strong initial engagement with developers on Base. In its first week, Base saw [18K developers deploy 55K smart contracts](https://base.mirror.xyz/rA5v_0BTc5AwmZdnui7ku82FzF1aTE6TJ_3vds9ymBc) on testnet. Since the Base testnet launch on 2.23.23, metrics show [2M accounts created and 17.5M transactions](https://base-goerli.blockscout.com/stats), and over 1 million addresses holding a [Base Builder NFT](https://goerli.basescan.org/token/0xAC6564F3718837CaAdd42Eed742d75c12b90a052) for participating in [Base Quests](https://quests.base.org/). An unofficial Base ecosystem account has mapped out the Base ecosystem in [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/UniverseOnBase/status/1655594580870578176).\n\nIn addition, Base has seen impressive retention, with the highest number of unique wallet users ([~70,000](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/hess/base-retention-BUjJWB)) returning to the Base chain for subsequent transactions within one day, representing [43% of the total users](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/hess/base-retention-BUjJWB). The users, in this case, are likely mostly developers, given that these metrics are from a testnet, which gives a promising outlook for the activity that will be seen on Base mainnet.\n\n## **Success Criteria**\n\nA successful deployment of Uniswap on Base would result in Uniswap becoming the de facto DEX for Base upon launching. Some specific indicators of success include the following:\n\n- **Increased TVL**: Base aims to integrate seamlessly into the Coinbase ecosystem (products + users), which creates an opportunity to introduce many net new users to Uniswap, in addition to existing users who utilize Uniswap on other chains.\n- **Security and Scalability:** Base leverages the underlying security of Ethereum to enable confident on-ramps onto Base from Coinbase, Ethereum L1, and other interoperable chains.\n- **Developer Empowerment and Integration:** Base has focused on [its builder community](https://base.mirror.xyz/rA5v_0BTc5AwmZdnui7ku82FzF1aTE6TJ_3vds9ymBc), which will ideally include Uniswap. Developers are also better enabled to join the Coinbase ecosystem, with seamless Coinbase product integrations, easy fiat onramps, and powerful acquisition tools. Because of these offerings, we believe Base will attract a wide range of dapp developers. Many of these dapps may utilize Uniswap or bring more users into the ecosystem, who may then use Uniswap. For this reason, we believe that adding a new chain that is focused on developers will grow the pie and be a net positive for the ecosystem and Uniswap.\n- **Efficiency and Cost:** Base offers full EVM compatibility at a fraction of the cost of Ethereum mainnet and is committed to pushing forward the developer platform with features including gasless transactions for dapps, simple developer APIs for account abstraction, and secure build environments for multichain applications. This should help create a Uniswap user experience and developer opportunity that is not possible on Ethereum L1.\n- **Values Alignment:** Base is open source, built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack. It aims to contribute toward the vision of creating a standard, modular, rollup agnostic Superchain [powered by Optimism](https://base.mirror.xyz/H_KPwV31M7OJT-THUnU7wYjOF16Sy7aWvaEr5cgHi8I). Thus driving greater accessibility, efficiency, and transparency in the ecosystem in alignment with Uniswap Foundation core initiatives.\n\n## **Conflict of Interest Declaration**\n\n- Anika (member of she256) works on the Base engineering team at Coinbase. She will abstain from voting on this proposal in her role at she256.\n- Kendra (member of she256) is on the Uniswap Accountability Committee for Deployments. She has recused herself from any Committee actions relating to this proposal.\n\n## **Timeline**\n\nThe proposal has passed the RFC phase without contention. This temperature check will indicate the community's desire to deploy on Base. Note that it is not a vote on the stakeholder list - this can be discussed in the forums. If the current temperature check passes, and there is no further feedback on stakeholders, then the stakeholders mentioned in the RFC will move forward with the deployment.\n\nOf course, the deployment can only occur once Base mainnet is live, which is tentatively scheduled for summer 2023. The goal would be to deploy Uniswap v3 on Base mainnet on day-one of the launch. A final onchain vote would happen after Base mainnet is live and the contracts have been deployed, to recognize this deployment as the canonical Uniswap v3 deployment.\n",

      "title": "Deploy UniswapV3 on Linea",
      "content": "## Proposal Summary\n\nConsenSys is proposing a recognized Uniswap V3 deployment for its incubated zkEVM, Linea.\n\n## Proposal Overview\n\nConsensys is seeking a Uniswap V3 deployment for Linea’s mainnet launch, looking to further integrate Uniswap with the Consensys product ecosystem (MetaMask, Infura, Linea, et. al). A key aspect of Linea's value proposition is its synergistic relationship with ConsenSys products. Establishing Uniswap as a dominant DEX on Linea would encourage more trading volume for the protocol and strengthen ties to current Consensys product users.\n\n## Motivation\n\nLinea's testnet has impressively handled more than 12 million transactions. Many of these transactions are part of the ongoing Voyage quest, a crucial initiative designed to help stress-test the network. This exercise aids in identifying potential issues and performance impediments before transitioning to Linea mainnet.\n\nMoreover, Linea is aligned with developers throughout the broader ecosystem via our relationships with MetaMask, Infura, and Truffle, emphasizing our commitment in serving developers, protocols, and builders.\n\nUsers will conveniently find Linea natively supported in the MetaMask network dropdown list, and it will support the full range of MetaMask curated experiences. These experiences include On/Off Ramp, MetaBridge, MetaMask Swaps, Portfolio dApp, and MetaMask SDK - all of which could leverage the Uniswap protocol.\n\n## About Linea\n\nLinea aims to be a [Type 2 zkEVM](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html) and achieve EVM-equivalence, handling native EVM bytecode for proving and verification. This allows for the execution of Solidity smart contracts and enables developers to build while using familiar tools and infrastructure at extremely low switching costs. The network does not use transpilers or custom compilers on bytecode. By taking the compiled bytecode directly from solidity, we significantly reduce the surface area risk for bugs and hacks.\n\nLinea seeks innovation, pushing the boundaries of the Web3 space while maintaining top security and full EVM compatibility as top priorities. One (of the many) things worth mentioning is Linea’s full support of EIP-4337 (Account Abstraction). Working with key stakeholders, the network already uses the single-entry-point contract and runs multiple networks of bundlers and paymasters services.\n\n## Vortex - Lattice-Based SNARKs\n\nWhat is particularly exciting about Linea is its ability to consolidate transactions and submit proofs to the Ethereum mainnet using a novel prover mechanism. This process enhances throughput and minimizes transaction fees while maintaining the inherent security of the Ethereum network.\n\n[Vortex](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1633), a cryptographic primitive under development at ConsenSys, aims to increase the performance of Linea. It leverages a novel type of zkProof called a recursive aggregation proof. This is based on Ring-SIS, a well-known premise from lattice-based cryptography. This proofing system enables the batching of transactions to increase the network's throughput while reducing fees. Linea also employs zk circuits to conduct computations. These cryptographic circuits facilitate secure and efficient computations.\n\n## Market Adoption\n\nSince the inception of Ethereum, ConsenSys was established to become the most potent proponent of decentralization worldwide. We believe that networks such as Ethereum can empower humanity to reach greater heights. With our experience handling web3 infrastructure, wallets, developer tools, public goods, and more, we are confident in our ability to steward Linea to complete decentralization and openness.\n\nLinea is the result of more than 20 months of R&D from our award-winning research team that has released and maintains successful projects in the zk space like the GNARK library. Linea represents advancements in the zkEVM realm and the general field of cryptography. With the Linea network being incubated via Consensys, adoption will be encouraged through existing Consensys products and partnerships.\n\nSome of these integrations include but are not limited to:\n\n* **MetaMask** - Largest Web3 wallet, easy user onboarding with default integration.\n* **Infura** - Simplified deployment lets developers ship faster and scale with the confidence of 99.9% uptime.\n* **Truffle** - Build, test, debug, and deploy Solidity smart contracts with tools like Truffle, Hardhat, and more.\n* **Besu** - Optimized execution for zkEVM transactions using Ethereum battle-tested components.\n* **Lastly**, nearly all EVM-specific development tools are Linea compatible.\n\n## Decentralization Roadmap\n\nLinea is committed to actively pursuing decentralization. Over the following year, the Linea team plans to implement decentralizing features. Examples include introducing a DAO, decentralized sequencers and prover systems.\n\n# Benefits for Uniswap\n\nThere are many benefits to a Uniswap deployment on Linea. In the following sections, we highlight our top three…\n\n1. Early Establishment in the Linea AMM Market\n2. Increased Volume through MetaMask Swaps Integration\n3. Cross Promotion\n\n## Early Establishment in the Linea AMM Market\n\nObserving Uniswap market share across crucial Layer 2 solutions reveals that the protocol enjoys several advantages x-chain. These include a strong community, brand recognition, and, most importantly, the first-mover advantage.\n\nTotal value locked (TVL) of Uniswap across significant roll-up ecosystems:\n\n* Arbitrum - 316.12M\n* Optimism - 82.5M\n\nWe anticipate that Uniswap will replicate its success in capturing market share on Linea, and we also hope that this deployment will serve as a model for the DAO on how Uniswap will perform with all upcoming L2/zkEVM launches over the next 6-8 months.\n\n## Increased Volume through Swaps Integration\n\nMetaMask Swaps is an aggregation product built natively into MetaMask. Across all integrated chains, as of last week, Swaps had an average weekly volume of ~$133M. Uniswap is consistently the largest leveraged dex of this weekly volume, executing ~58%, or $77.1M of trades.\n\nMost of this volume is directed through Ethereum; however, observing comparable L2 deployments shows that Swaps contributed nearly 100M of volume to Arbitrum since integration.\n\nProducts like Swaps leverage many service providers, and only a few of them will be deployed on Linea day 1, providing Uniswap the opportunity to capture an even bigger market share of L2 volume produced from the product.\n\n## Cross Promotion\n\nAnother benefit for the protocol is the cross-promotion between Consensys and Uniswap, and to double down on the shared mission of contributing to the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem. The team plans to promote the network's usage and the protocols that operate on it. This, combined with utilizing a recognized deployment of Uniswap, will aid in establishing Uniswap on Linea and in the greater ecosystem.\n\n# Additional Information\n\n## Costs and Incentives\n\nConsensys will cover all deployment costs, and is willing to contribute any engineering resources required for the deployment.\n\n## Cross Chain Messaging\n\nThe Linea team operates and maintains a canonical Open Messaging Service (OMS). The OMS allows for messages to pass to and from Ethereum & Linea. The Ethereum network verifies smart contracts on the L1 that enforce a valid state on Linea.\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nThe OMS will be operated in-house. The design implements a relayer and leverages the rollup to maintain state/security.\n\n## Example Walk-Through of Cross-Chain Message Passing\n\nA technical walk-through of the future-state, cross-chain governance on mainnet is as follows:\n\n1. The Uniswap Governor Bravo Contract will send a message to the L1 bridge contract (implementing the IBridge.sol interface) by calling the `dispatchMessage` method.\n2. The L1 bridge contract emits a `MessageDispatched` event.\n3. The roll-up relayer catches the event and sends an L2 transaction to the L2 bridge contract by calling the `deliverMessage` function.\n4. The L2 contract calls the contract defined in the `to` field. The L2 contract should authenticate the call by calling the `sender()` method on the L2 bridge upon reception of the `deliverMessage` call, verifying that this corresponds to a known L1 address.\n5. The L1 bridge contract verifies the message execution and emits an event `MessageConfirmed`, once the next L2 block is finalized and the zk proof is verified.\n\n**Source:** [Modified from Linea Documentation](https://docs.linea.build/developers/use-message-bridge#l1-to-l2) (links in documentation)\n\n## Success Criteria \n\nAlthough it is difficult to quantify success criteria, we can confidently state that establishing Uniswap as an early, dominant DEX from Day 1 is a priority.\n\nThe overarching success of the Uniswap deployment will be determined through increasing key DeFi metrics that include TVL, Volume, Users, and Swaps. Upon deployment, we will provide a dashboard to monitor Uniswap’s progress and assess market performance.\n\n# Proposer Details\n\n## Proposer Details\n\nConsenSys is a leading Ethereum and decentralized protocols software company. We enable developers, enterprises, and people worldwide to build next-generation web3 applications, launch modern financial infrastructure, and access the decentralized web. Our product suite, composed of MetaMask, Infura, Truffle, Diligence, and CNFT, serves millions of users. ConsenSys has the technical expertise to deploy Uniswap.\n\n## Conflict of Interest\n\nConsenSys is an active delegate and provides software services to Uniswap Labs. However, these developments and contractual relationships do not impact the organization's independence.\n\n## Proposal Stakeholders\n\n**Proposer:** Consensys\n**Deployer:** Consensys\n**Bridge Provider:** Linea Native Bridge\n**Target Chain:** Linea\n**Proposal Sponsor:** Consensys\n\n# Engagement Terms\n\n## Linea Mainnet Timeline\n\nLinea mainnet aims to launch in the month of July. We understand that deployment relies on mainnet, and we will proceed with the on-chain portion of this proposal at the appropriate time.\n\nAs for now, and as outlined [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-post-bsl-cross-chain-deployment-process-creation-of-new-uniswap-eth-subdomain/20961), the timing of the official recognition will occur after deployment.\n\n## Deployment Process/Timeline\n\n1. The request for comment will be at least seven days.\n2. After, a temperature check will be made on Snapshot and remain live for five days.\n*(The temperature check solely assesses the DAO's desire to deploy on linea.)*\n3.  If 10m votes support the proposal, ConsenSys and the Linea team will prepare an on-chain proposal.\n\n4. Under appropriate conditions, we will move to an on-chain vote that lasts ~11 days (7-day voting window).\n\n## Source: \n\n[Forum Post](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-on-linea/21261/1)",

      "title": "Deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam (2023)",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nWe [Michigan Blockchain](https://twitter.com/UMichBlockchain) are submitting this proposal to reinstate the deployment of Uniswap v3 on Polkadot’s EVM-compatible parachain, Moonbeam. The temperature check for this proposal passed with **26M (~100%) YES** votes and **169 (~0%) NO** votes–the proposal stakeholders were agreed upon via the RFC.\n\n## Proposal Motivation\n\nLast spring, the Uniswap DAO voted on this exact topic. The proposal advanced through Uni’s governance rails, receiving positive [feedback from the community](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-deploy-uniswap-v3-on-moonbeam/16759), progressing past the [temperate check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/QmaG6nJYW3xLeQwAa6xxhpbuYS8h6PVQpbx1vfqpqxAtik), and eventually passing with a near unanimous YES decision during the [onchain vote](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/19). Nomad was the designated contract deployer and the appointed cross-chain messaging solution for that proposal. Illusory Systems (Nomad) received the Additional Use Grant, which can be seen on the [v3-core-license-grants.uniswap.eth ENS subdomain](https://app.ens.domains/name/v3-core-license-grants.uniswap.eth/details). Although Nomad obtained the license exemption in May 2022, they never began v3 contract deployment on Moonbeam. This can generally be seen as fortuitous from Uniswap’s vantage point as the hiatus allowed Uniswap to avoid exposure to the [Nomad bridge exploit](https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1554252024723546112?s=20) on August 1, 2022.\n\nRecently, both the [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-deploy-uniswap-v3-on-moonbeam/16759/12?u=abdullahumar) and [Moonbeam](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/continue-the-uniswap-v3-deployment-on-moonbeam-with-different-bridge-provider/20831) communities have voiced interest in reinstating the previous proposal. As a result, we have conversed with key members of the Moonbeam ecosystem to formulate a reformed proposal with modifications to the previous proposal. This new proposal will contain updates regarding the architecture and activity on both Polkadot and Moonbeam. The previous $2.5M commitment by the Moonbeam foundation to the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) has been omitted due to difficult market conditions, but there are liquidity incentives available through [Moonbeam Foundation’s Level 3](https://forum.moonbeam.foundation/t/referendum-87-revised-grant-program/399) grant process. This has the potential to qualify for the mentioned grant over the course of the next few months, allowing for more seamless liquidity bootstrapping on Moonbeam.\n\n## Proposal Stakeholders\n\nThe following list of stakeholders is present to transparently communicate which entities and individuals are involved in proposal creation and implementation.\n\n**Proposer: [Michigan Blockchain](https://twitter.com/umichblockchain?lang=en)**\n* This entity is responsible for authoring the proposal & managing the governance process\n\n**Deployer: [GFX Labs](https://gfx.xyz/)**\n* This entity is responsible for the technical deployment of the contracts on the target chain\n\n**Bridge Provider: [Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/)**\n* This is the cross-chain messaging solution selected for this deployment\n\n**Target Chain: [Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network/) (a Polkadot parachain)**\n* This is the chain that v3 contracts have been deployed on\n\n**Proposal Sponsor: Michigan Blockchain**\n* This entity has >2.5M UNI and is therefore eligible for administering the onchain vote\n\n## Moonbeam, Polkadot, and How Uniswap Benefits\n\nOne of the key selling points for Uniswap’s deployment onto Moonbeam is the potential for the DEX to attain market share in the broader Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n### The Polkadot Relay Chain\n\nAt the heart of Polkadot lies the Relay Chain, a layer-0 blockchain with limited bells and whistles, lacking native support for smart contracts. The purpose of the Relay Chain is to serve as a simplistic centerpiece into which other blockchains integrate. Layer-1 blockchains that connect to the Relay Chain are called parachains. Each parachain has autonomy over its architecture with a native token, collator set (collators are just validators for a parachain), and governance system. The Polkadot Relay Chain uses Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) consensus, making it responsible for the crucial task of handling the ecosystem’s security. The chain’s [staking ratio currently sits at 47%](https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/polkadot/metrics/) (~$4B DOT out of $7.6B DOT mcap) which indicates that nearly half of the token supply is involved in securing Polkadot. Parachain collators aren’t directly responsible for security but are vital for aggregating parachain txns into a block candidate, along with a respective state transition proof, for the Relay Chain to validate. Offloading consensus responsibilities to the Relay Chain liberates parachains and lets them divert their resources and efforts to designing and maintaining specialized L1s like Moonbeam.\n\n### Moonbeam: Polkadot’s Go-to EVM-Compatible Parachain\n\nMoonbeam was inaugurated as Polkadot’s second parachain after it [won a parachain slot auction](https://moonbeam.foundation/moonbeam-crowdloan/) in Q4 2021. Parachain slots are the limited number of seats present on the Relay Chain. Each slot is occupied by a particular project for a lease period of two years. Currently, [43](https://polkadot.subscan.io/parachain) out of the [100 maximum slots](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains-faq#is-100-a-hard-limit-on-the-number-of-parachains-that-can-be-supported) are filled. In order for a parachain slot to become occupied, a project must win a slot auction: a 7-day bidding process during which multiple projects compete to attain a seat on the Relay Chain. The project that bids the most DOT tokens bonds (locks up) the bidded tokens for the duration of slot lease. Bonded tokens are returned post lease expiration. To ease the financial burden of self-funding large bids, projects vie for DOT holders’ contributions to crowdfund their bid. Moonbeam received a total of [35,759,931 DOT from ~200k contributors](https://moonbeam.foundation/moonbeam-crowdloan/), the highest number of tokens committed for any parachain auction. As a reward, DOT contributors received Glimmer ($GLMR), the native Moonbeam token responsible for rewarding collators, network txn fees, and governance. The sheer number of contributors made GLMR’s distribution decentralized.\n\n### XCM & Interoperability\n\nAlong with security, the second core function of the Relay Chain is providing trustless interoperability between parachains. The sharing of state and validation logic enables a trustless ecosystem. Individual parachains do not have a reliance on trusting other parachains and can instead depend on the Relay Chain. The specific railway for sending assets and messages to parachains via the Relay Chain is called XCMP, which utilizes a standardized communication format called XCM. This is Polkadot’s way of enabling a versatile cross-chain environment, as XCM is not only limited to parachains but can also be utilized by non-Substrate chains. XCM went live May 2022, the same month that the previous Moonbeam RFC was released. It has since [relayed ~235k messages](https://polkadot.subscan.io/xcm_dashboard). Parity Technologies is constantly iterating on XCM’s functionalities, with [XCM v3 launching soon](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm).\n\nMoonbeam currently [leads all other parachains](https://polkadot.subscan.io/xcm_channel) in terms of cross-parachain txns via XCM channels. Over 2/3 of the top XCM channels involve transfers either to or from Moonbeam, illustrating the parachain’s high usage in the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nMoonbeam also leveraged XCM to create the XC-20 token standard. XC-20 tokens are essentially Substrate assets that conform to the ERC-20 interface. This is a game changer for Uniswap. Since Uni uses ERC-20 tokens, the DEX struggles to accommodate non-ERC-20 tokens like Substrate native tokens. If a user wants to create a DOT/ETH pool, for instance, this is not possible due to DOT’s incompatibility with Uniswap’s ERC-20 requirement. Utilizing xcDOT, the XC-20 version of DOT, fixes this issue.\n\nThis interoperability between parachains will expose Uniswap to the entire Polkadot ecosystem. Uniswap’s presence on Moonbeam will likely become a beacon for users and developers to access liquidity more seamlessly. The transfer of assets and data from Ethereum to Moonbeam to other parachains–and vice versa–would facilitate the overall growth of Polkadot and Uniswap.\n\n### Developers and Ecosystem\n\nAs of Q4 2022, Polkadot saw its [full-time developer count](https://www.developerreport.com/) increase to 752, trailing only behind Ethereum. This is in part due to the ease of using the Substrate framework. The rate of growth was on par with Ethereum but lagged behind competing chains like Cosmos and Solana. A more holistic measure of growth would also include the activity present on Polkadot’s canary chain, Kusama, which saw a 21% increase in full-time developers. Prior to launching on Polkadot, projects tend to launch a version of their chain on Kusama–which is not a testnet but a fully sovereign chain–to battle test their product. Kusama hosts a very similar Relay Chain-Parachain architecture to mimic the conditions of Polkadot. Moonbeam’s sister chain on Kusama is called Moonriver. Moonbeam itself saw a full-time developer growth rate of 39%.\n\nMoonbeam is only second to Acala in terms of parachain TVL, with $46.5M spread across 44 different protocols. Due to the ease with which Ethereum developers can launch their EVM dapps onto the parachain, Moonbeam boasts the largest quantity of applications in the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nThe DEX market on Moonbeam is largely uncontested, with StellaSwap absorbing most of the parachain’s TVL. With capital efficient liquidity pools and strong brand recognition, Uniswap’s expansion into the Moonbeam ecosystem will very likely enable it to capture market share from StellaSwap and also attract new users–the goal is not for this to be a zero-sum game.\n\n## Deployment Details\n\nThe approval of this proposal by Uniswap governance will lead the stated Uniswap v3 contracts to be deemed as the canonical deployment on Moonbeam. As is the case with all canonical v3 deployments, this deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended to include the reference to the stated v3 contracts on Moonbeam.\n\n**Deployed Contracts Information (completed by GFX Labs):**\n\n[Message Sender](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf5f4496219f31cdcba6130b5402873624585615a#code)\n\n[Message Receiver](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/address/0xB2af16D6c7074228fC487F17929De830303E6531#code)\n\n[v3CoreFactoryAddress](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/address/0x28f1158795A3585CaAA3cD6469CD65382b89BB70#code)\n\n[multicall2Address](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/address/0xcefe54c7a797199ab4e7e9ebb0885f1ece4aa544#code)\n\n[proxyAdminAddress](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/address/0x401908E5E38D2F285425bafc1795eA900D030dEa#code)\n\n[tickLensAddress](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/address/0x1f4F7b041895D9eB1A79be0896AF3E68e4160010#code)\n\n[nftDescriptorLibraryAddressV1_3_0](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/address/0x041b81cb4d223d8e70ac96c0d103f8a956ed4514#code)\n\n[nonfungibleTokenPositionDescriptorAddressV1_3_0](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/address/0x921c55AE486e63D16dbfbE216573A21aeB684c02#code)\n\n[descriptorProxyAddress](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/address/0x974841BD5aea2aac749Ff581d02E27B5D986c654#code)\n\n[nonfungibleTokenPositionManagerAddress](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/address/0x9036D0DcB5a059C9371B05D508f0072Df773854e#code)\n\n[v3MigratorAddress](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/address/0x76776b10d782a1d194fBFC92d4b01db1cE1eEB4B#code)\n\n[v3StakerAddress](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/address/0x74E9C28a9E62d8B559347f569d05e493EAd9703D#code)\n\n[quoterV2Address](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/address/0x48aF91cDcad8FfdD7a8d4CdF73c16CB0632D3D17#code)\n\n[swapRouter02](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/address/0xc507E22BA3140dc0A79fDF27e03c98aa20f3ee66#code)\n\n## Bootstrapping Liquidity\n\nDue to tumultuous market conditions, promises of liquidity bootstrapping have been temporarily excised. However, there are still alternative methods to help procure initial Uni v3 liquidity on Moonbeam post deployment. Michigan Blockchain is currently exploring writing a proposal on the Moonbeam forums via the [Moonbeam Foundation’s Level 3](https://forum.moonbeam.foundation/t/referendum-87-revised-grant-program/399) grant process. We are open to community feedback here, but the plan is for our team to apply for a Moonbeam grant on behalf of the DAO.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal has passed the RFC and temperature check phases. The relevant Uniswap v3 contracts have also been deployed on the Moonbeam chain. If this onchain vote passes, this deployment will be officially recognized as a canonical v3 deployment through an amendment to the v3deployments.uniswap.eth subdomain. Thereafter, Uniswap Labs is left with the task of handling the front-end integration updates and including Moonbeam to the auto router–this final step is not subject to the DAO’s discretion and is handled entirely by Uniswap Labs, a separate entity from DAO.",

      "title": "Create v3deployments.uniswap.eth subdomain and populate its text fields",
      "content": "## Rationale\nPer the discussion in the governance forums [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-post-bsl-cross-chain-deployment-process-new-uniswap-eth-subdomain/20878) and [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-post-bsl-cross-chain-deployment-process-creation-of-new-uniswap-eth-subdomain/20961), and the Snapshot poll [here](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x0f8a85d90759acf3a6fdc018e20b991f3562847122a8142c4e166c71d0e755e3), canonical deployments of Uniswap v3 will be recorded in a new subdomain. This proposal seeks to create that subdomain (`v3deployments.uniswap.eth`) and populate its text records with all deployments that were granted business source license exemptions and those that have passed governance votes since the license's expiry.\n\nOne thing to note - both [zkSync](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/2/25) and [Polygon zkEVM](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/2/34) have passed governance votes and will be added to the subdomain at a date in the future when their deployments are complete. \n\n## Process\nIf executed, this governance proposal will make 9 function calls. At a high level, the first transaction creates the new subdomain and the next 8 add text records to it. The text records are formatted such that the key is the [network number](https://chainlist.org) of the chain in question and the value is a string with the address of the bridge sender contract on mainnet associated with the deployment followed by the UniswapV3Factory address on the destination chain, separated by a space and a comma. Note that this is a slight departure from what was suggested in the forums; after discussing with various members of the governance community it became apparent that including the factory address would be a valuable addition.\n\nWe describe the function calls in more detail below, and a detailed simulation of the transaction's execution will be available shortly after this proposal goes live by downloading the Uniswap artifact at the bottom of this [page](https://github.com/Uniswap/governance-seatbelt/actions).\n\n1. Creates the new subdomain by calling the `setSubnodeRecord` on the ENS Registry and passing it the name hash for `uniswap.eth`, the label hash for `v3deployments`, the timelock's address, and the ENS public resolver's address.\n\n2. Creates a new text record on `v3deployments.uniswap.eth` by calling `setText` on the subdomain and passing it the name hash for the subdomain, the key `42161` for Arbitrum and value `0x4Dbd4fc535Ac27206064B68FfCf827b0A60BAB3f, 0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984`\n\n3. Creates a new text record on `v3deployments.uniswap.eth` by calling `setText` on the subdomain and passing it the name hash for the subdomain, the key `10` for Optimism and value `0x25ace71c97B33Cc4729CF772ae268934F7ab5fA1, 0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984`\n\n4. Creates a new text record on `v3deployments.uniswap.eth` by calling `setText` on the subdomain and passing it the name hash for the subdomain, the key `137` for Polygon and value `0xfe5e5D361b2ad62c541bAb87C45a0B9B018389a2, 0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984`\n\n5. Creates a new text record on `v3deployments.uniswap.eth` by calling `setText` on the subdomain and passing it the name hash for the subdomain, the key `42220` for Celo and value `0xf7e46b233abd1edaad8dbbbda12129b97b071025, 0xAfE208a311B21f13EF87E33A90049fC17A7acDEc`\n\n6. Creates a new text record on `v3deployments.uniswap.eth` by calling `setText` on the subdomain and passing it the name hash for the subdomain, the key `56`  for Binance Smart Chain and value `0xf5F4496219F31CDCBa6130B5402873624585615a, 0xdB1d10011AD0Ff90774D0C6Bb92e5C5c8b4461F7`\n\n7. Creates a new text record on `v3deployments.uniswap.eth` by calling `setText` on the subdomain and passing it the name hash for the subdomain, the key `100` for Gnosis and value `0xf5f4496219f31cdcba6130b5402873624585615a, 0xe32F7dD7e3f098D518ff19A22d5f028e076489B1`\n\n8. Creates a new text record on `v3deployments.uniswap.eth` by calling `setText` on the subdomain and passing it the name hash for the subdomain, the key `43114` Avalanche and value `0xeb0BCF27D1Fb4b25e708fBB815c421Aeb51eA9fc, 0x740b1c1de25031C31FF4fC9A62f554A55cdC1baD`\n\n9.

      "title": "[Temperature Check] Deploy Uniswap v3 on Moonbeam (2023)",
      "content": "## Proposal Motivation\n\nWe [Michigan Blockchain](https://twitter.com/UMichBlockchain) are submitting this proposal to reinstate the deployment of Uniswap v3 on Polkadot’s EVM-compatible parachain, Moonbeam.\n\nLast spring, the Uniswap DAO voted on this exact topic. The proposal advanced through Uni’s governance rails, receiving positive [feedback from the community](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-deploy-uniswap-v3-on-moonbeam/16759), progressing past the [temperate check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/QmaG6nJYW3xLeQwAa6xxhpbuYS8h6PVQpbx1vfqpqxAtik), and eventually passing with a near unanimous YES decision during the [onchain vote](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/19). Nomad was the designated contract deployer and the appointed cross-chain messaging solution for that proposal. Illusory Systems (Nomad) received the Additional Use Grant, which can be seen on the [v3-core-license-grants.uniswap.eth ENS subdomain](https://app.ens.domains/name/v3-core-license-grants.uniswap.eth/details). Although Nomad obtained the license exemption in May 2022, they never began v3 contract deployment on Moonbeam. This can generally be seen as fortuitous from Uniswap’s vantage point as the hiatus allowed Uniswap to avoid exposure to the [Nomad bridge exploit](https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1554252024723546112?s=20) on August 1, 2022.\n\nRecently, both the [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-deploy-uniswap-v3-on-moonbeam/16759/12?u=abdullahumar) and [Moonbeam](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/continue-the-uniswap-v3-deployment-on-moonbeam-with-different-bridge-provider/20831) communities have voiced interest in reinstating the previous proposal. As a result, we have conversed with key members of the Moonbeam ecosystem to formulate a reformed proposal with a couple of modifications to the previous proposal. This new proposal will contain updates regarding the architecture and activity on both Polkadot and Moonbeam. The previous $2.5M commitment by the Moonbeam foundation to the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) has been omitted due to difficult market conditions, but there are liquidity incentives available through [Moonbeam Foundation’s Level 3](https://forum.moonbeam.foundation/t/referendum-87-revised-grant-program/399) grant process. This has the potential to qualify for the mentioned grant over the course of the next few months, allowing for more seamless liquidity bootstrapping on Moonbeam. \n\n## Moonbeam, Polkadot, and How Uniswap Benefits\n\nOne of the key selling points for Uniswap’s deployment onto Moonbeam is the potential for the DEX to attain market share in the broader Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n### The Polkadot Relay Chain\n\nAt the heart of Polkadot lies the Relay Chain, a layer-0 blockchain with limited bells and whistles, lacking native support for smart contracts. The purpose of the Relay Chain is to serve as a simplistic centerpiece into which other blockchains integrate. Layer-1 blockchains that connect to the Relay Chain are called parachains. Each parachain has autonomy over its architecture with a native token, collator set (collators are just validators for a parachain), and governance system. The Polkadot Relay Chain uses Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) consensus, making it responsible for the crucial task of handling the ecosystem’s security. The chain’s [staking ratio currently sits at 47%](https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/polkadot/metrics/) (~$4B DOT out of $7.6B DOT mcap) which indicates that nearly half of the token supply is involved in securing Polkadot. Parachain collators aren’t directly responsible for security but are vital for aggregating parachain txns into a block candidate, along with a respective state transition proof, for the Relay Chain to validate. Offloading consensus responsibilities to the Relay Chain liberates parachains and lets them divert their resources and efforts to designing and maintaining specialized L1s like Moonbeam.\n\n### Moonbeam: Polkadot’s Go-to EVM-Compatible Parachain\n\nMoonbeam was inaugurated as Polkadot’s second parachain after it [won a parachain slot auction](https://moonbeam.foundation/moonbeam-crowdloan/) in Q4 2021. Parachain slots are the limited number of seats present on the Relay Chain. Each slot is occupied by a particular project for a lease period of two years. Currently, [43](https://polkadot.subscan.io/parachain) out of the [100 maximum slots](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains-faq#is-100-a-hard-limit-on-the-number-of-parachains-that-can-be-supported) are filled. In order for a parachain slot to become occupied, a project must win a slot auction: a 7-day bidding process during which multiple projects compete to attain a seat on the Relay Chain. The project that bids the most DOT tokens bonds (locks up) the bidded tokens for the duration of slot lease. Bonded tokens are returned post lease expiration. To ease the financial burden of self-funding large bids, projects vie for DOT holders’ contributions to crowdfund their bid. Moonbeam received a total of [35,759,931 DOT from ~200k contributors](https://moonbeam.foundation/moonbeam-crowdloan/), the highest number of tokens committed for any parachain auction. As a reward, DOT contributors received Glimmer ($GLMR), the native Moonbeam token responsible for rewarding collators, network txn fees, and governance. The sheer number of contributors made GLMR’s distribution decentralized.\n\n### XCM & Interoperability\n\nAlong with security, the second core function of the Relay Chain is providing trustless interoperability between parachains. The sharing of state and validation logic enables a trustless ecosystem. Individual parachains do not have a reliance on trusting other parachains and can instead depend on the Relay Chain. The specific railway for sending assets and messages to parachains via the Relay Chain is called XCMP, which utilizes a standardized communication format called XCM. This is Polkadot’s way of enabling a versatile cross-chain environment, as XCM is not only limited to parachains but can also be utilized by non-Substrate chains. XCM went live May 2022, the same month that the previous Moonbeam RFC was released. It has since [relayed ~235k messages](https://polkadot.subscan.io/xcm_dashboard). Parity Technologies is constantly iterating on XCM’s functionalities, with [XCM v3 launching soon](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm).\n\nMoonbeam currently [leads all other parachains](https://polkadot.subscan.io/xcm_channel) in terms of cross-parachain txns via XCM channels. Over 2/3 of the top XCM channels involve transfers either to or from Moonbeam, illustrating the parachain’s high usage in the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nMoonbeam also leveraged XCM to create the XC-20 token standard. XC-20 tokens are essentially Substrate assets that conform to the ERC-20 interface. This is a game changer for Uniswap. Since Uni uses ERC-20 tokens, the DEX struggles to accommodate non-ERC-20 tokens like Substrate native tokens. If a user wants to create a DOT/ETH pool, for instance, this is not possible due to DOT’s incompatibility with Uniswap’s ERC-20 requirement. Utilizing xcDOT, the XC-20 version of DOT, fixes this issue.\n\nThis interoperability between parachains will expose Uniswap to the entire Polkadot ecosystem. Uniswap’s presence on Moonbeam will likely become a beacon for users and developers to access liquidity more seamlessly. The transfer of assets and data from Ethereum to Moonbeam to other parachains–and vice versa–would facilitate the overall growth of Polkadot and Uniswap.\n\n### Developers and Ecosystem\n\nAs of Q4 2022, Polkadot saw its [full-time developer count](https://www.developerreport.com/) increase to 752, trailing only behind Ethereum. This is in part due to the ease of using the Substrate framework. The rate of growth was on par with Ethereum but lagged behind competing chains like Cosmos and Solana. A more holistic measure of growth would also include the activity present on Polkadot’s canary chain, Kusama, which saw a 21% increase in full-time developers. Prior to launching on Polkadot, projects tend to launch a version of their chain on Kusama–which is not a testnet but a fully sovereign chain–to battle test their product. Kusama hosts a very similar Relay Chain-Parachain architecture to mimic the conditions of Polkadot. Moonbeam’s sister chain on Kusama is called Moonriver. Moonbeam itself saw a full-time developer growth rate of 39%.\n\nMoonbeam is only second to Acala in terms of parachain TVL, with $46.5M spread across 44 different protocols. Due to the ease with which Ethereum developers can launch their EVM dapps onto the parachain, Moonbeam boasts the largest quantity of applications in the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nThe DEX market on Moonbeam is largely uncontested, with StellaSwap absorbing most of the parachain’s TVL. With capital efficient liquidity pools and strong brand recognition, Uniswap’s expansion into the Moonbeam ecosystem will very likely enable it to capture market share from StellaSwap and also attract new users–the goal is not for this to be a zero-sum game. \n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal has passed the RFC phase without contention. The current temperature check is purposed for assessing the DAO’s desire to deploy on Moonbeam. If this Snapshot passes, then we will commence the finalization of the relevant stakeholders mentioned in the RFC. Again, this temp check is only measuring the community's desire to deploy on Moonbeam--it's not a vote on the stakeholder list. Stakeholder debates are to take place in the Uniswap Forums. After the community is content with the stakeholders (decided in forums) AND has shown a desire to deploy on Moonbeam (decided by this temp check), an onchain vote will begin. If the onchain vote passes, Uniswap Labs will handle the front-end integration updates and include Moonbeam to the auto router.",

      "title": "Uniswap Deployments Accountability Committee",
      "content": "This post follows the [RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-accountability-committee-proposal/20316/16) and approved [Temperature Check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-accountability-committee-proposal/20579/6) for the creation of an **Accountability Committee for Deployments** for Uniswap DAO.  \n\nThe main changes from the previous proposal are:\n\n- The committee’s **Operating Policies** and **Conflict of Interest Policy** are listed below.\n- Cameron O’Donnell (Consensys) has stepped down from the committee, and Rafael Solari (Tally) has stepped up to replace him.\n- The proposal overview is updated to account for the committee’s role following the expiry of the Business Source License.\n\n### Proposal Overview\n\nWe propose the creation of an **Accountability Committee for Deployments** tasked with overseeing the operational development of deployments of Uniswap V3 on other chains. \n\nLicensure and deployments are the areas that have generated the most governance activity. The continued launch of new chains and platforms will require ongoing oversight and attention.\n\n************************************License Expiry & the Accountability Committee************************************\n\nWith the expiry of Uniswap’s BSL on April 1, 2023, prospective deployers will no longer require license exemptions voted on by Uniswap Governance. Teams wishing to utilize parts of Uniswap V3 may deploy at their own will. However, in order to be considered a part of Uniswap ecosystem, some projects will seek to obtain the “official” blessing and management of Uniswap Governance.\n\nThe initial purview of the proposed Committee will be to liaise with projects seeking to deploy Uniswap; ensure deploying projects are correctly configured; and providing a recommendation to the community on whether to approve certain deployments.\n\n\n### Overview\n\nOver the past year, several projects have requested Additional Use Grants to the Uniswap community and/or requested permission to deploy Uniswap protocol to alternative chains (including L2s and alternative L1s). Often such proposals offered financial incentives for Uniswap. However, the delivery of funds has been in some cases delayed or implemented according to mechanisms that weren’t part of the agreement terms. \n\nIn order to mitigate this issue and facilitate stronger accountability practices in Uniswap, we propose the formation of an Accountability Committee tasked with the following functions:\n\n- Be responsible for the evaluation of proposals during the first two phases of the governance process (RFC and Temperature Check).\n- Verify that proposals comply with the requirements of the [Uniswap DAO Proposal Template](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-template-2-0-upgrade-for-deployments-agreements/19936).\n- Implement and manage an on-chain commitment mechanism for Uniswap DAO.\n- Require that deployment proposals offering financial incentives to Uniswap (including but not limited to grants for Uniswap community, liquidity mining, or metagovernance incentives) may not proceed forward to the last stage of the governance process without depositing a % of the promised funds into the commitment contract or other holding mechanisms.\n- If the proposal does not follow the approval process, the committee will formally and publicly object to it.\n- Provide last-mile QA and technical guidance for deployment configuration.\n- Keeping track of commitments, disbursements, and project milestones.\n- Report quarterly to Uniswap DAO on activities.\n\nFor each proposal that advances to the on-chain Governance Proposal phase, the Committee will engage in the following activities:\n\n- Ensuring deployments are properly configured\n- Liaising with the proposer team\n- Facilitate delegate discussion around quality and credibility of the project\n- Co-editing the final proposal with the proposer team \n\n  \n### Committee Duration\n\nThe initial Committee will have ******************5 members****************** and a duration of **6 months** to allow committee members to begin developing practices and processes that may meaningfully carry forward into future iterations of the committee. \n\nWith the expiration of BSL on April 1, 2023, the Committee’s core focus will be correct configuration of deployment and providing recommendation to governance on deployments that may be managed by Uniswap Governance. At the end of the term the Committee will be subjected to review by the community to discuss areas of improvement and potential expansion of its scope to other kinds of partnerships beyond deployments.\n\nWe believe that there is plenty of scope for the committee to keep providing value to Uniswap community after the expiration of the BSL:\n\n- Cross-chain governance will continue to be an issue after April 1 and the committee will be in a position to provide expert guidance and recommendations in the process, while gathering community feedback, guaranteeing compliance to the [Cross-chain Assessment Bridge Process](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/cross-chain-bridge-assessment-process/20148), and overseeing its implementation.\n- Lastly, we believe future versions of Uniswap core protocol are likely to launch with a BSL.\n\n \n### Compensation\n\nWe propose that Committee members are compensated with a retainer of $3,500 per 6-month term and a fee of $6,500 for each evaluated project, paid at the end of each 6-month period. We propose a minimum of 2 committee members’ involvement in each agreement proposal.\n\nWe also propose an ad-hoc / discretionary budget of $1,000 per committee member to support any legal fees incurred by the team.\n\nAssuming the Committee will review 2 proposals each term, the **maximum estimated budget** for the first iteration of the Accountability committee is $87,500 for the first 6 months, and $170,000 for a year. \n\n### Motivation\n\nThe need for an Accountability role in Uniswap DAO was crystalized in the first **Uniswap Delegate Forum** that Uniswap Foundation and Other Internet hosted in October 2022, following the publication of OI’s [accountability report](https://otherinter.net/research/uniswap-accountability/) for Uniswap, which explored at length the legal, social and on-chain accountability mechanisms available to Uniswap. The Forum led to the creation of a dedicated **Accountability Working Group** to address Uniswap DAO’s accountability challenges.\n\nAs observed in the report, at present Uniswap’s strongest accountability measure in the context of licensing and partnership agreements is the Business Source License, which however has limited application toward enforcing the terms of an agreement and the delivery of promised funds after a proposal has been executed. \n\nEstablishing and formalizing an accountability role within Uniswap, with a clear mandate and responsibilities, will greatly **improve accountability toward the DAO, avoid repeating past episodes of missing or delayed funds, and overall facilitate the operational autonomy of the DAO** going forward. We also plan to leverage work on the cross-chain bridge assessment group and liaise with them in security assessments.\n\n### Selection Process\n\nWe initially proposed 5 committee members that were participants in the accountability working group that Other Internet ran at the beginning of the year. Following the feedback from the community, we supported Uniswap DAO contributors and delegates nominating themselves for a position on the committee. The committee size is capped at 5 members, at least for the duration of the trial period. The goal of the cap is to keep the costs in check, scale manageable, and committee members accountable.\n\nDesired criteria for committee membership include:\n\n- Context on the history of accountability challenges faced by Uniswap and DAOs in general.\n- Demonstrated commitment and active participation in Uniswap governance decisions.\n- Understanding and context on prior Uniswap deployment processes.\n- Experience managing and negotiating partnerships and agreements.\n- Clear understanding of technical architecture of Uniswap v3 and governance.\n\n### Selected Members\n\nThe committee was ratified by the Uniswap community in the Temperature Check phase of this proposal using Approval Voting. One of the selected delegates had to step down and has been replaced by Raf Solari. Uniswap’s first Accountability Committee is composed by the following delegates:\n\n- *Doo Wan Nam (COO at StableLab) **[@Doo_Stablelab](https://gov.uniswap.org/u/doo_stablelab)***\n    \n    ********************Experience:******************** Professional delegate at StableNode across major DeFi protocols, including MakerDAO, Optimism, Aave, 1inch, Balancer, Element, InstaDapp, Hop.

      "title": "Uniswap v3 Gnosis",
      "content": "Blockchain@Columbia and the Gnosis team are submitting an on-chain proposal to deploy Uniswap V3 to Gnosis Chain. With Uniswap V3's BSL expired on April 1st, deployment of Uniswap V3 on alt-L1's is crucial for Uniswap to establish market share post license expiry. After consultation with both the Gnosis and Wormhole teams, we think that it's crucial to deploy Uni V3 on Gnosis chain now as a step towards a multichain future.\n\nThe [temperature check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x63f6c44e4245e5b90a0f30ebb6932506879f68b149a5f78fd2186125c9144535) passed with 20M (100%) YES votes and 508 UNI (0%) NO votes.\n\n## Proposal Motivation\n\nThis proposal has already been in discussion since April 2022, where it has passed both a snapshot check and temperature check with overwhelming support. Unfortunately, due to the Nomad bridge incident, deployment was put on hold. The Gnosis team has continued to work and push this proposal throughout this time and we believe that it's fair for their work to come into fruition after a year.\n\nWith the recent BSL expiry, this proposal comes at a crucial time. Expectedly, protocols will harp on this opportunity and use the same V3 design to extract value in ecosystems where Uniswap is absent. As such, we believe that it is important for Uniswap to capture this opportunity prior to the license expiration date before forks (which may or may not be safe) arise.\n\nAdditionally, Uniswap deployment on GC will be mutually beneficial for a number of reasons:\n\n1. With Uniswap v3 as a cornerstone DeFi engine, various protocols will have the opportunity to interact within the ecosystem, further promoting growth. Perpetual Protocol, the flagship protocol on Gnosis Chanin, relies on Uniswap v3 and this deployment will enable Perpetual to continue to flourish on Gnosis Chain. Other bluechip deployments including Curve, Balancer, and Sushi have also chosen Gnosis as their home bases and shown steady growth in TVL. Complete metrics of Gnosis Chain are available at <https://defillama.com/chain/Gnosis>. Many new protocols will soon be deployed on Gnosis and we believe that Uniswap can be at the forefront of the next wave of DeFi on GC.\n\n2. Gnosis Chain's ability to offer stable, low-cost transactions are directly beneficial to Uniswap users. With low gas costs that don't impact swaps and trades, GC can offer users the ability to deploy efficient strategies at a higher volume, generating more fees -- an opportunity not available on Ethereum mainnet.\n\n3. Gnosis can provide an iterative environment where Uniswap Labs can experiment with new functionalities and front-run new features. Unlike a test environment, a real value environment like GC allows for a more accurate evaluation of the platform's capabilities. This also provides an opportunity for uniswap to identify and address any potential issues stemming from important Ethereum updates before their mainnet activation. With optimized slot and epoch times, Uniswap can ensure faster iteration and improve the overall efficiency of the platform.\n\n4. Deploying Uniswap on Gnosis Chain ensures tight compatibility with Ethereum. GC currently supports various tools, resources, projects, and protocols that are already supported by Ethereum, with more being onboarded regularly. A full list of protocols on GC is available at <https://gnosischain.world/>. Many existing projects are using Gnosis Safe for their daily operations. The Gnosis team is also working on a [trustless bridge architecture](https://hackmd.io/g8TK7IzYQjClTTaor-ypIQ) that will connect Ethereum and GC, providing seamless interoperability between the two chains. The [Gnosis Beacon Chain validator set](https://beacon.gnosischain.com/) is expanding rapidly with 113,665 active validators at the moment, bringing massive decentralization to the chain. While the GBC shares many similarities with the Ethereum Beacon Chain, there are some notable differences. Notably, GBC has 5-second blocks and < 2-min epochs, which allow for faster transactions and has a lower gas target of $.01 per 100k gas, providing stable transactions. The validator set is economically and geographically diverse, ensuring greater decentralization with lower-stakes, lower-TVL environment.\n\n5. The Gnosis Chain's unique characteristics such as stable, low-cost transactions offer significant advantages to Uniswap users. With predictable and low gas costs, traders can explore new strategies and approaches that may not be feasible on other chains with variable and high fees, such as the Ethereum mainnet. This presents an opportunity for Uniswap users to optimize their trades and maximize their returns, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience.\n\n6. Gnosis Chain is committed to increasing their user base and on-chain activity by providing user incentives. To achieve this goal, GC has established an ecosystem fund that is strategically allocated from the GnosisDAO treasury to promote adoption. As part of our joint proposal, we suggest utilizing a portion of these funds to promote Uniswap v3 adoption. This initiative will encourage users to trade and stake their assets, ultimately promoting greater liquidity and activity on the platform. Through this program, we aim to attract more users and establish Uniswap as a leading DeFi protocol on the platform.\n\n## Security & Bridges\n\nThis section is from 0xPlasma Labs' [proposal](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/2/31) regarding Uniswap V3 deployment on BNB chain. As Wormhole is our bridge provider of choice for Gnosis deployment, their analysis is of utmost relevance for this proposal. Given that Wormhole has been chosen for BNB deployment, they already have the necessary resources to make deployment on Gnosis chain fast and efficient.\n\n1. Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing? Yes, Wormhole is one of the first and longest-serving arbitrary messaging protocols. Since launching on mainnet in August 2021, 185 million messages have been transmitted, with 2 million messages currently generated daily between asset transfers and messaging through organic usage.\n\n2. Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi-sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes? Wormhole is secured by 19 validators (aka: Guardians) who jointly attest to messages. Each message must be attested by at least 13 of the 19 Guardians. Our Guardian set comprises the leading PoS validators, including Staked, Figment, Chorus One, P2P, and more. The complete set of current validators can be found [here](https://wormhole.com/network/). As mentioned above Wormhole is making significant progress in developing ZK-based light clients to facilitate completely trustless message-passing.\n\n3. Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is the security provided by another third-party entity? Wormhole message security waits for both consensuses to be reached on the source chain as well as additional safety features provided by the bridge. Additionally, Guardians run full nodes to protect the protocol against consensus-level exploits in the connected chains and further reduce contagion risk.\n\n4. Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms? All messages passing through Wormhole require a minimum of observation and signing by a majority of the Wormhole Guardian set (13 of 19). While there is currently no out-of-the-box recall mechanism for messages, a minority (7 of 19) Guardians may refuse to sign a fraudulent message and thwart an attack. Simple yet customized message recall functions can be built by individual integrators. An integrator would build \"edge contracts\" to introduce a time delay on message acceptance, providing an integrator with an opportunity to recall the message before it becomes effective.\n\n5. What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor? Wormhole's Guardians are leading PoS validators and some of the most respected names within the validator community. They collectively represent tens of billions in value staked and carry valuable reputations in the communities where they serve. Should they act maliciously (such as a sign or forge fraudulent messages), they risk reputational consequences, external PoS businesses, and ejection from the Wormhole Guardian set. There is little incentive for an individual Guardian to act maliciously. Even if a Guardian were to succeed in forging a fraudulent message, it would not affect the network state because a single signature isn't enough to establish the super-majority required to gain a quorum. Finally, a fraudulent message would be immediately attributable to the offending Guardian to the rest of the Guardian network.\n\n6. Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied? The bridge has been audited 25+ times by leading audit firms, including Certik, Trail of Bits, and OtterSec, and the cohort of auditors continues to grow. You can see the complete list of auditors and publicized findings [here](https://wormhole.com/security/). Those 25 audits are in addition to Wormhole's already rigorous internal auditing standards, where a team of 6 experienced security engineers regularly perform reviews of the protocol's security.\n\n## Future Bridge Alterations\n\nBlockchain@Columbia and the Gnosis team support changes to this setup. When a more efficient design is finalized, multi-chain deployment design should be altered with said solution through governance.\n\n## Timeline\n\nGranted that the on-chain vote is approved, Uniswap V3 deployment on Gnosis chain will be ready for deployment through Wormhole's cross-chain messaging service. We estimate that the backend of the deployment can be completed within a few days.\n\n## Proposer\n\n0xdC1F98682F4F8a5c6d54F345F448437b83f5E432",

      "title": "Uniswap v3 Gnosis",
      "content": "Blockchain@Columbia and the Gnosis team are submitting an on-chain proposal to deploy Uniswap V3 to Gnosis Chain. With Uniswap V3's BSL expired on April 1st, deployment of Uniswap V3 on alt-L1's is crucial for Uniswap to establish market share post license expiry. After consultation with both the Gnosis and Wormhole teams, we think that it's crucial to deploy Uni V3 on Gnosis chain now as a step towards a multichain future.\n\nThe [temperature check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x63f6c44e4245e5b90a0f30ebb6932506879f68b149a5f78fd2186125c9144535) passed with 20M (100%) YES votes and 508 UNI (0%) NO votes.\n\n## Proposal Motivation\n\nThis proposal has already been in discussion since April 2022, where it has passed both a snapshot check and temperature check with overwhelming support. Unfortunately, due to the Nomad bridge incident, deployment was put on hold. The Gnosis team has continued to work and push this proposal throughout this time and we believe that it's fair for their work to come into fruition after a year.\n\nWith the recent BSL expiry, this proposal comes at a crucial time. Expectedly, protocols will harp on this opportunity and use the same V3 design to extract value in ecosystems where Uniswap is absent. As such, we believe that it is important for Uniswap to capture this opportunity prior to the license expiration date before forks (which may or may not be safe) arise.\n\nAdditionally, Uniswap deployment on GC will be mutually beneficial for a number of reasons:\n\n1. With Uniswap v3 as a cornerstone DeFi engine, various protocols will have the opportunity to interact within the ecosystem, further promoting growth. Perpetual Protocol, the flagship protocol on Gnosis Chanin, relies on Uniswap v3 and this deployment will enable Perpetual to continue to flourish on Gnosis Chain. Other bluechip deployments including Curve, Balancer, and Sushi have also chosen Gnosis as their home bases and shown steady growth in TVL. Complete metrics of Gnosis Chain are available at <https://defillama.com/chain/Gnosis>. Many new protocols will soon be deployed on Gnosis and we believe that Uniswap can be at the forefront of the next wave of DeFi on GC.\n\n2. Gnosis Chain's ability to offer stable, low-cost transactions are directly beneficial to Uniswap users. With low gas costs that don't impact swaps and trades, GC can offer users the ability to deploy efficient strategies at a higher volume, generating more fees -- an opportunity not available on Ethereum mainnet.\n\n3. Gnosis can provide an iterative environment where Uniswap Labs can experiment with new functionalities and front-run new features. Unlike a test environment, a real value environment like GC allows for a more accurate evaluation of the platform's capabilities. This also provides an opportunity for uniswap to identify and address any potential issues stemming from important Ethereum updates before their mainnet activation. With optimized slot and epoch times, Uniswap can ensure faster iteration and improve the overall efficiency of the platform.\n\n4. Deploying Uniswap on Gnosis Chain ensures tight compatibility with Ethereum. GC currently supports various tools, resources, projects, and protocols that are already supported by Ethereum, with more being onboarded regularly. A full list of protocols on GC is available at <https://gnosischain.world/>. Many existing projects are using Gnosis Safe for their daily operations. The Gnosis team is also working on a [trustless bridge architecture](https://hackmd.io/g8TK7IzYQjClTTaor-ypIQ) that will connect Ethereum and GC, providing seamless interoperability between the two chains. The [Gnosis Beacon Chain validator set](https://beacon.gnosischain.com/) is expanding rapidly with 113,665 active validators at the moment, bringing massive decentralization to the chain. While the GBC shares many similarities with the Ethereum Beacon Chain, there are some notable differences. Notably, GBC has 5-second blocks and < 2-min epochs, which allow for faster transactions and has a lower gas target of $.01 per 100k gas, providing stable transactions. The validator set is economically and geographically diverse, ensuring greater decentralization with lower-stakes, lower-TVL environment.\n\n5. The Gnosis Chain's unique characteristics such as stable, low-cost transactions offer significant advantages to Uniswap users. With predictable and low gas costs, traders can explore new strategies and approaches that may not be feasible on other chains with variable and high fees, such as the Ethereum mainnet. This presents an opportunity for Uniswap users to optimize their trades and maximize their returns, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience.\n\n6. Gnosis Chain is committed to increasing their user base and on-chain activity by providing user incentives. To achieve this goal, GC has established an ecosystem fund that is strategically allocated from the GnosisDAO treasury to promote adoption. As part of our joint proposal, we suggest utilizing a portion of these funds to promote Uniswap v3 adoption. This initiative will encourage users to trade and stake their assets, ultimately promoting greater liquidity and activity on the platform. Through this program, we aim to attract more users and establish Uniswap as a leading DeFi protocol on the platform.\n\n## Security & Bridges\n\nThis section is from 0xPlasma Labs' [proposal](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/2/31) regarding Uniswap V3 deployment on BNB chain. As Wormhole is our bridge provider of choice for Gnosis deployment, their analysis is of utmost relevance for this proposal. Given that Wormhole has been chosen for BNB deployment, they already have the necessary resources to make deployment on Gnosis chain fast and efficient.\n\n1. Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing? Yes, Wormhole is one of the first and longest-serving arbitrary messaging protocols. Since launching on mainnet in August 2021, 185 million messages have been transmitted, with 2 million messages currently generated daily between asset transfers and messaging through organic usage.\n\n2. Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi-sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes? Wormhole is secured by 19 validators (aka: Guardians) who jointly attest to messages. Each message must be attested by at least 13 of the 19 Guardians. Our Guardian set comprises the leading PoS validators, including Staked, Figment, Chorus One, P2P, and more. The complete set of current validators can be found [here](https://wormhole.com/network/). As mentioned above Wormhole is making significant progress in developing ZK-based light clients to facilitate completely trustless message-passing.\n\n3. Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is the security provided by another third-party entity? Wormhole message security waits for both consensuses to be reached on the source chain as well as additional safety features provided by the bridge. Additionally, Guardians run full nodes to protect the protocol against consensus-level exploits in the connected chains and further reduce contagion risk.\n\n4. Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms? All messages passing through Wormhole require a minimum of observation and signing by a majority of the Wormhole Guardian set (13 of 19). While there is currently no out-of-the-box recall mechanism for messages, a minority (7 of 19) Guardians may refuse to sign a fraudulent message and thwart an attack. Simple yet customized message recall functions can be built by individual integrators. An integrator would build \"edge contracts\" to introduce a time delay on message acceptance, providing an integrator with an opportunity to recall the message before it becomes effective.\n\n5. What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor? Wormhole's Guardians are leading PoS validators and some of the most respected names within the validator community. They collectively represent tens of billions in value staked and carry valuable reputations in the communities where they serve. Should they act maliciously (such as a sign or forge fraudulent messages), they risk reputational consequences, external PoS businesses, and ejection from the Wormhole Guardian set. There is little incentive for an individual Guardian to act maliciously. Even if a Guardian were to succeed in forging a fraudulent message, it would not affect the network state because a single signature isn't enough to establish the super-majority required to gain a quorum. Finally, a fraudulent message would be immediately attributable to the offending Guardian to the rest of the Guardian network.\n\n6. Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied? The bridge has been audited 25+ times by leading audit firms, including Certik, Trail of Bits, and OtterSec, and the cohort of auditors continues to grow. You can see the complete list of auditors and publicized findings [here](https://wormhole.com/security/). Those 25 audits are in addition to Wormhole's already rigorous internal auditing standards, where a team of 6 experienced security engineers regularly perform reviews of the protocol's security.\n\n## Future Bridge Alterations\n\nBlockchain@Columbia and the Gnosis team support changes to this setup. When a more efficient design is finalized, multi-chain deployment design should be altered with said solution through governance.\n\n## Timeline\n\nGranted that the on-chain vote is approved, Uniswap V3 deployment on Gnosis chain will be ready for deployment through Wormhole's cross-chain messaging service. We estimate that the backend of the deployment can be completed within a few days.\n\n## Proposer\n\n0xdC1F98682F4F8a5c6d54F345F448437b83f5E432",

      "title": "Governance Proposal - Uniswap V3 Launch on zkEVM",
      "content": "Point of Contact: Jack Melnick, \nTG: jackmelnick, email: jmelnick@polygon.technology\n\n# Proposal summary\n## Uniswap V3 launch on Polygon zkEVM.\n\n### Overview of proposal\nWe propose to authorize Polygon Labs to deploy Uniswap’s protocol to the Polygon Zero Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine rollup known as “zkEVM” on behalf of the community.\n\nWe believe this is the right moment for Uniswap v3 to deploy on Polygon zkEVM, for several major reasons:\n\n* Polygon zkEVM is a new zk-rollup that provides Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence (opcode-level compatibility) for a transparent user experience and existing Ethereum ecosystem and tooling compatibility.\n* An Ethereum L2 scalability solution utilizing cryptographic zero-knowledge technology to provide validation and fast finality of off-chain transaction computations.\n* A new set of tools and technologies were created and engineered and are contained in this organization, to address the required recreation of all EVM opcodes for transparent deployment and transactions with existing Ethereum smart contracts.\n* Polygon is aligned with Ethereum and its values.\n\n### About Polygon Labs\n\nPolygon Labs is the leading platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development. It is rapidly building a suite of protocols that will offer developers easy access to all major scaling and infrastructure solutions:\n\n- L2 solutions/Rollups (Polygon Hermez 2, Polygon Miden 2);\n- Sidechains, stand-alone and enterprise chains (Polygon SDK 1);\n- Hybrid solutions (Polygon PoS);\n- Data availability solutions (Polygon Avail 2) and more.\n\nThe Polygon network is by far the most adopted scaling effort in the Ethereum ecosystem, with 3,000+ applications hosted, 1B+ transactions processed, 100M+ unique user addresses and ~$5B+ in assets secured.\n\n### Motivation\nThere’s significant value in Uniswap being available on an EVM compatible ZK rollup. Deploying early on zkEVM helps solidify Uniswap’s place as the number one DEX and a thought leader.\n\nImportantly, it will help grow a large list of projects that can be built on Uniswap V3. Additionally, given the community and user uptake Uniswap has seen on Polygon PoS, it’s only natural to make its deployment on Polygon zkEVM a priority.\n\n## Partner Details\n### Polygon Labs\n\nThis proposal is being made by Jack Melnick, DeFi BD Lead, an employee of Polygon Labs. Polygon Labs is a legal entity focused on the ecosystem growth and maintenance of the suite of Polygon Networks.\n\n### Partner Legal\n\nThe legal entity that is supporting this proposal is Polygon Labs Services (Switzerland) AG, a Swiss corporation known as “Polygon Labs”.\n\n### Delegate Sponsor\n\nThere is no delegate co-authoring or sponsoring this proposal. Instead, this is a proposal submitted by Jack Melnick of Polygon Labs to support the growth of Polygon as part of the overall Polygon community.\n\n### Conflict of Interest Declaration\n\nThere are no existing financial or contractual relationships between Polygon Labs and any of Uniswap’s legal entities, including Uniswap Labs, UNI tokens, nor investments of Uniswap Labs Ventures.\n\n## KPI & Success Criteria\n\n### Target KPIs\nThere are generally 2 forms of projects:\n\n1) Growth-driven projects: on-chain, trackable metrics preferred here.\n \n![a7f2d31aea283aae96a2e18a8c30badeba702d6f.png](ipfs://bafkreic7vtw65gqmqgrs46pbhdh4n6bbvd6kusbj77jz3cfsuwq4inj2mm)\n    \n2) Strategic Initiatives: that targets a specific goal (e.g. Uniswap Foundation core initiatives). These are more completion based.\n\n![cb3bb480aa0a9ae1b520f73a0e0c16654f8f9e33.png](ipfs://bafkreidivzmticu723vvql57p6suqwurkd3lekjmfsbspy3h72pjn4ul6u)\n \n### What does success look like?\n\nSuccess Criteria: A successful zkEVM deployment will, in an organic and sustained manner, grow Uniswap’s Total Addressable Market across TVL, unique interacting wallet, volumes, and integration with partner dApps. As demand for zk-blockchains and proximity to Ethereum rises, users and builders will increasingly look to zkEVM solutions to build and trade.\n\n### What potential risks are there for this project’s success? How could they be mitigated?\n\nRisk Profile: Deploying on zkEVM should pose minimal risks, relative to deploying on alternate blockchains. As an Ethereum Layer Two, it uses Zero Knowledge proofs to inherit Ethereum’s core safety, while allowing developers to easily deploy existing EVM codebases. \n\nThe bridge has been disintermediated, and Uniswap can expect reputable Oracle providers to be available as data providers from Day One. Polygon’s zkEVM testnet has been running for the past six months, and has accumulated over 84,000 wallets, 75,000 ZK proofs, and 300,000 blocks. Additionally, the deployment has been audited multiple times, by auditors including Spearbit and Hexens. \n\nPrimary risks, as always, include still unforeseen vectors, which can be mitigated through close work with Polygon developer support (whenever needed) and gradual deployment of liquidity on the new chain.\n\n### Protocol security\nPlease address the following questions if you’re proposing a cross-chain deployment:\n\n**Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing?** Yes\n\n**Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?** No trusted entity, multi-sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes, only L1 and L2 security. Pure smart contract interactions only.\n\n**Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is security provided by another third party entity?** All based on L1 and L2. L2 security is based on the L1.\n\n**Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?** There are two ways to use the bridge:\n- Native supported messages: Allow only bridging of ERC-20 and ETH. Here there is nothing someone can do other than that.\n- Custom Messages: Custom receiver logic on the other side of the bridge. When you send a message the message needs to be received by a smart contract, so you have to build the receiver smart contract, which is specific to the logic of that smart contract. Here the security is up to the person building the receiver smart contract. These custom messages do not take custody of any funds. All we guarantee is that the message will pass the bridge if implemented correctly. We are just the message carrier.\n\n**What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?** Here we assume no possibility for fraud.\n\n**Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?** There is an ongoing audit process by a third party. We will not go to Mainnet without the results from the audit and vulnerabilities remedied.",

      "title": "[Temperature Check] Post-BSL cross-chain deployment process and creation of new uniswap.eth subdomain",
      "content": "\nTL;DR\nUniswap v3’s BSL expired Saturday, April 1, 2023.\nPost BSL-expiry, it will be beneficial to identify one official Uniswap v3 deployment per chain in order to provide safety & security for users, focused support to ecosystem participants, and clarity to Uniswap governance. This deployment would be recognized in future Uniswap governance actions, by the UF for hackathons, by the ecosystem for liquidity mining campaigns, etc. \nIn the post below we recommend the following in order to determine and track official Uniswap v3 deployments: \n\nA governance process which mostly remains the same, with some updates to allow for the fact that deployments can now be recognized as official after they have been deployed. \nCreation of a new subdomain v3-deployments.uniswap.eth that will be used to track official deployments. \nThe creation of the new v3-deployments.uniswap.eth subdomain requires a governance vote. We are kicking that off here with an RFC, and we will gather feedback on this proposal as a whole as we go through the governance process. \n\nAs many of you know, the BSL is set to expire later this week on Saturday, April 1. Once it expires, it will be possible for any person or team to deploy the Uniswap v3 code for production or commercial use (more on the BSL here). We assume that there will be multiple deployments of Uniswap v3 across other chains. \n\nHowever, after the BSL expires, it will still be important for the Uniswap DAO to determine which deployment, of many potential deployments, on another chain should be recognized as the Uniswap DAO’s official deployment. \n\nIt will be important, and beneficial to both the DAO and Uniswap users, to identify one official deployment per chain for many reasons:\n\nCode Verification: this official deployment will have been verified as equivalent to the source code by the DAO. In other words, the DAO will have verified that no one has altered the deployment code in a malicious or unintentionally harmful manner. If for some reason the code has been altered, for instance to be deployed on StarkNet in Cairo or in another language on another chain, those changes would be vetted by the DAO prior to an on-chain vote. \nEcosystem Clarity & Support: Some Uniswap ecosystem developers may want to focus their efforts on integrating with one designated Uniswap deployment per L1 or L2. Ecosystem or Foundation funded liquidity mining campaigns and hackathons will similarly look to support the official deployment. \nUniswap Governance Control: Only the official deployment will be updated and maintained by Uniswap governance (ie., to add fee tiers or turn on fees).\n\nBelow we lay out the process we recommend that Uniswap governance adopts to identify these official deployments. Some of the thinking around these steps were inspired by a post written by @devenmatthews a few days ago, which you might also want to read here. \n\nThe governance process will remain mostly the same, with some specific changes being recommended to: \nTakes into account the fact that deployments may now be done prior to the Uniswap governance process being completed to identify it an official deployment. \nAllows the proposer to change the deployer team if they are unable to fulfill their responsibilities in a timely manner, or to change a bridge if the chosen bridge is hacked, prior to the final on-chain vote. \nStill allow for the Uniswap DAO to review and approve specific details, such as the deployment team and bridge, prior to voting a deployment to be official. \nAllow for the governance process to track official deployments in a newly created Uniswap.eth subdomain, v3-deployments.uniswap.eth. The on-chain vote will update this subdomain with the relevant deployment information \n\nAn on-chain vote is itself required to create the new subdomain v3-deployments.uniswap.eth, which will track official deployments of Uniswap v3 on other chains. This RFC is kicking off the governance process to do that. \nList of Actors in a Deployment\nFirst we want to review and clarify the types of stakeholders who participate in a cross-chain deployment. This review may be helpful in understanding not only the recommendation below but the mechanics of these types of proposals as a whole. It’s possible for one entity or person to serve as multiple stakeholders at once – for instance, a proposer can also be a deployer, and a deployer can be a bridge provider. \n\nProposer: entity or individual that creates the proposal on forum, and manages the governance process \n\nDeployer: entity that handles the deployment of Uniswap v3 contracts on other chains or L2s\n\nBridge Provider: cross-chain messaging solution selected from the Bridge Assessment Committee’s recommendations\n\nL1 or L2 team: target chain for deployment\n\nProposal Sponsor: entity that has enough UNI to sponsor the final on-chain vote. The Uniswap Foundation is typically able to serve as the sponsor for these proposals. \nRecommended Process \nThe governance process (defined here) will remain the same in terms of time frame, platform (forum, Snapshot, on-chain vote), and quorum requirements, with specific adjustments being made to the process for ascribing a Uniswap v3 deployment as “official”.\n\nPrior to an on-chain vote, Uniswap v3 should be deployed. During the vote, delegates should assess all components of the proposal and deployment including but not limited to a deployment’s equivalency to source code (potentially leveraging the help of more technical network stakeholders), and whether a bridge or bridging solution is included in the Bridge Assessment Committee’s set of recommendations. \n\nDeployments which pass this governance process will receive support as the official Uniswap deployment on the L1 or L2 from the Uniswap Foundation, DAO, and ecosystem. \n\nRFC: \nMinimum 7 days. Post your proposal on the governance forum to allow the community to review and ask questions. Keep the proposal in the forum, responding to questions and iterating upon the proposal based on feedback for at least 7 days prior to moving to the next phase.\nProposal is for an official deployment on the L1 or L2, with the rationale for deploying Uni v3 on that chain. \nAt this point, the deployment may already be completed. If so, include links to relevant contracts, and include a description of the deployment team and bridge used. \nIf the deployment has not already been completed, the proposal might reference the deployer and bridge which are intended to be used, but this is neither binding nor required. \nIf the deployment has not been completed already, the proposer should converse with teams interested in aiding with contract deployment. Deployers can also comment on the RFC, communicating their willingness and technical capabilities to handle deployment. \n\nTemperature Check: \n5 days. Create an off-chain Snapshot Poll to ensure community sentiment is in favor of your proposal. A majority of votes in favor, with a quorum of 10M UNI votes, is required to move forward to the last phase.\nA Temperature Check is done, assessing Uniswap DAO’s desire to have the deployment done on the L1 or L2. Again, at this point, a deployer and bridge might be determined already, but it’s neither binding nor required. \nIf and when the Temp Check passes, the deployers will have confidence in Uniswap governance interest in supporting a deployment on the L1 or L2. \n\nDeployment is completed\nIf a deployment has not already been completed, it should be done following a successful Temperature Check. The proposing team can work with the deployer to execute the contract deployments. Details of the deployment, including contract addresses and messaging infrastructure, should be added to the forum in the proposal for the on-chain vote. \n\nGovernance Vote: \n11 days (7 day voting period). An on-chain vote is proposed and executed. If successful, the vote would add the new deployment information to the newly created v3-deployments.uniswap.eth subdomain. \nThe benefits of this process are as follows: \nThe proposer is not bound to a specific deployment team, if for some reason the original deployment team is unable to deploy in a timely manner prior to the on-chain vote. \nThe proposer is not bound to a specific bridge if a bridge is hacked between the RFC and deployment. A bridge or agnostic solution should ideally be chosen based on the recommendations from the Bridge Assessment Committee. \nUniswap governance still has final approval of the deployer and bridge used through the final on-chain vote. \nCreation of v3-deployments.uniswap.eth subdomain\nAs we note above, and in alignment with the governance process we recommend after the BSL expires, the UF proposes to create a new ENS subdomain v3-deployments.uniswap.eth to track official deployments of Uniswap v3 on L1s and L2s. This Temperature Check is the second step in that process. \nUpdates to Proposal from RFC\nThanks to everyone who provided feedback on the Request for Comment. We wanted to call out a couple specific points from the conversation:\n\nNaming Convention\nWe should settle a single name for the deployments that are the subject of successful governance votes. We recommend “canonical”. E.g. the recent Avalanche deployment will be referred to as the canonical Uniswap v3 deployment on Avalanche. \n\nNon-EVM Deployments\nFor non-EVM deployments, @deven’s Starknet post is a good starting point. There has been some conversation around conventions for audit requirements and we hope that continues. This proposal is not meant to define the exact process by which those deployments will happen, but I do think that audits from a reputable firm (or firms) that are familiar with the Solidity codebase would be a signal that a given deployment should be taken seriously (and a lack of those audits should be a symbol as well).\n\nVerification of Deployments\nFor EVM deployments, a standardized verification process that can be performed by anyone and the results of which can be found publicly (and be interpreted by a variety of audiences) should absolutely be the norm. Much like the audit process mentioned above, the presence or absence of these test results will be a valuable signal to delegates when they vote on a deployment. I joined the Foundation 36 hours ago but this topic has already come up in several discussions and I’m excited to help move it forward.\nNext Steps\nCode\nPending a successful Snapshot vote, we will move forward with an on-chain vote that:\nCreates a new subdomain (`v3-deployments.uniswap.eth`)\nEdits the text record of that subdomain to the protocol name and bridge sender contract address of all deployments that were granted BSL licenses\n\nOther Output\nFollowing a successful onchain vote, we will update the forum guidelines for posting with the recommendations contained here. \n",

      "title": "Uniswap V3 Launch on zkEVM",
      "content": "Point of Contact: Jack Melnick, \nTG: jackmelnick, email: jmelnick@polygon.technology\n\n# Proposal summary\n## Uniswap V3 launch on Polygon zkEVM.\n\n### Overview of proposal\nWe propose to authorize Uniswap Labs to deploy Uniswap’s protocol to the Polygon Zero Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine rollup known as “zkEVM” on behalf of the community.\n\nWe believe this is the right moment for Uniswap v3 to deploy on Polygon zkEVM, for several major reasons:\n\n* Polygon zkEVM is a new zk-rollup that provides Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence (opcode-level compatibility) for a transparent user experience and existing Ethereum ecosystem and tooling compatibility.\n* An Ethereum L2 scalability solution utilizing cryptographic zero-knowledge technology to provide validation and fast finality of off-chain transaction computations.\n* A new set of tools and technologies were created and engineered and are contained in this organization, to address the required recreation of all EVM opcodes for transparent deployment and transactions with existing Ethereum smart contracts.\n* Polygon is aligned with Ethereum and its values.\n\n### About Polygon Labs\n\nPolygon Labs is the leading platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development. It is rapidly building a suite of protocols that will offer developers easy access to all major scaling and infrastructure solutions:\n\n- L2 solutions/Rollups (Polygon Hermez 2, Polygon Miden 2);\n- Sidechains, stand-alone and enterprise chains (Polygon SDK 1);\n- Hybrid solutions (Polygon PoS);\n- Data availability solutions (Polygon Avail 2) and more.\n\nThe Polygon network is by far the most adopted scaling effort in the Ethereum ecosystem, with 3,000+ applications hosted, 1B+ transactions processed, 100M+ unique user addresses and ~$5B+ in assets secured.\n\n### Motivation\nThere’s significant value in Uniswap being available on an EVM compatible ZK rollup. Deploying early on zkEVM helps solidify Uniswap’s place as the number one DEX and a thought leader.\n\nImportantly, it will help grow a large list of projects that can be built on Uniswap V3. Additionally, given the community and user uptake Uniswap has seen on Polygon PoS, it’s only natural to make its deployment on Polygon zkEVM a priority.\n\n## Partner Details\n### Polygon Labs\n\nThis proposal is being made by Jack Melnick, DeFi BD Lead, an employee of Polygon Labs. Polygon Labs is a legal entity focused on the ecosystem growth and maintenance of the suite of Polygon Networks.\n\n### Partner Legal\n\nThe legal entity that is supporting this proposal is Polygon Labs Services (Switzerland) AG, a Swiss corporation known as “Polygon Labs”.\n\n### Delegate Sponsor\n\nThere is no delegate co-authoring or sponsoring this proposal. Instead, this is a proposal submitted by Jack Melnick of Polygon Labs to support the growth of Polygon as part of the overall Polygon community.\n\n### Conflict of Interest Declaration\n\nThere are no existing financial or contractual relationships between Polygon Labs and any of Uniswap’s legal entities, including Uniswap Labs, UNI tokens, nor investments of Uniswap Labs Ventures.\n\n## KPI & Success Criteria\n\n### Target KPIs\nThere are generally 2 forms of projects:\n\n1) Growth-driven projects: on-chain, trackable metrics preferred here.\n \n![a7f2d31aea283aae96a2e18a8c30badeba702d6f.png](ipfs://bafkreic7vtw65gqmqgrs46pbhdh4n6bbvd6kusbj77jz3cfsuwq4inj2mm)\n    \n2) Strategic Initiatives: that targets a specific goal (e.g. Uniswap Foundation core initiatives). These are more completion based.\n\n![cb3bb480aa0a9ae1b520f73a0e0c16654f8f9e33.png](ipfs://bafkreidivzmticu723vvql57p6suqwurkd3lekjmfsbspy3h72pjn4ul6u)\n \n### What does success look like?\n\nSuccess Criteria: A successful zkEVM deployment will, in an organic and sustained manner, grow Uniswap’s Total Addressable Market across TVL, unique interacting wallet, volumes, and integration with partner dApps. As demand for zk-blockchains and proximity to Ethereum rises, users and builders will increasingly look to zkEVM solutions to build and trade.\n\n### What potential risks are there for this project’s success? How could they be mitigated?\n\nRisk Profile: Deploying on zkEVM should pose minimal risks, relative to deploying on alternate blockchains. As an Ethereum Layer Two, it uses Zero Knowledge proofs to inherit Ethereum’s core safety, while allowing developers to easily deploy existing EVM codebases. \n\nThe bridge has been disintermediated, and Uniswap can expect reputable Oracle providers to be available as data providers from Day One. Polygon’s zkEVM testnet has been running for the past six months, and has accumulated over 84,000 wallets, 75,000 ZK proofs, and 300,000 blocks. Additionally, the deployment has been audited multiple times, by auditors including Spearbit and Hexens. \n\nPrimary risks, as always, include still unforeseen vectors, which can be mitigated through close work with Polygon developer support (whenever needed) and gradual deployment of liquidity on the new chain.\n\n### Protocol security\nPlease address the following questions if you’re proposing a cross-chain deployment:\n\n**Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing?** Yes\n\n**Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?** No trusted entity, multi-sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes, only L1 and L2 security. Pure smart contract interactions only.\n\n**Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is security provided by another third party entity?** All based on L1 and L2. L2 security is based on the L1.\n\n**Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?** There are two ways to use the bridge:\n- Native supported messages: Allow only bridging of ERC-20 and ETH. Here there is nothing someone can do other than that.\n- Custom Messages: Custom receiver logic on the other side of the bridge. When you send a message the message needs to be received by a smart contract, so you have to build the receiver smart contract, which is specific to the logic of that smart contract. Here the security is up to the person building the receiver smart contract. These custom messages do not take custody of any funds. All we guarantee is that the message will pass the bridge if implemented correctly. We are just the message carrier.\n\n**What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?** Here we assume no possibility for fraud.\n\n**Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?** There is an ongoing audit process by a third party. We will not go to Mainnet without the results from the audit and vulnerabilities remedied.",

      "title": "[Temperature Check] Deploy Uniswap V3 on Gnosis Chain",
      "content": "Blockchain@Columbia, in conjunction with the Gnosis Team, are proposing to deploy Uniswap V3 to Gnosis Chain. \n\nOverview of Gnosis Chain\nFormerly known as the xDai Chain, Gnosis has been in development since 2018 and has continued to build and grow throughout the years. Gnosis includes a beacon chain framework, rollups, and other features that enable faster blocks and epochs, low-cost transactions, and the ability to construct trustless bridges. \n\nThe Gnosis Chain team has demonstrated their dedication towards the growth and adoption of the Ethereum ecosystem. Gnosis Chain's objective is to expedite the advancement of Ethereum and expand its reach. We are convinced that deploying Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain will offer various advantages to both Uniswap Labs and its users. \n\nWith Uniswap v3 as a cornerstone DeFi engine, various protocols will have the opportunity to interact within the ecosystem, further promoting growth. Perpetual Protocol, the flagship protocol on Gnosis Chanin, relies on Uniswap v3 and this deployment will enable Perpetual to continue to flourish on Gnosis Chain. Other bluechip deployments including Curve, Balancer, and Sushi have also chosen Gnosis as their home bases and shown steady growth in TVL. Complete metrics of Gnosis Chain are available at https://defillama.com/chain/Gnosis. Many new protocols will soon be deployed on Gnosis and we believe that Uniswap can be at the forefront of the next wave of DeFi on GC. \nGnosis Chain’s ability to offer stable, low-cost transactions are directly beneficial to Uniswap users. With low gas costs that don’t impact swaps and trades, GC can offer users the ability to deploy efficient strategies at a higher volume, generating more fees – an opportunity not available on Ethereum mainnet. \nGnosis can provide an iterative environment where Uniswap Labs can experiment with new functionalities and front-run new features. Unlike a test environment, a real value environment like GC allows for a more accurate evaluation of the platform’s capabilities. This also provides an opportunity for uniswap to identify and address any potential issues stemming from important Ethereum updates before their mainnet activation. With optimized slot and epoch times, Uniswap can ensure faster iteration and improve the overall efficiency of the platform.\nDeploying Uniswap on Gnosis Chain ensures tight compatibility with Ethereum. GC currently supports various tools, resources, projects, and protocols that are already supported by Ethereum, with more being onboarded regularly. A full list of protocols on GC is available at https://gnosischain.world/. Many existing projects are using Gnosis Safe for their daily operations. The Gnosis team is also working on a trustless bridge architecture that will connect Ethereum and GC, providing seamless interoperability between the two chains. The Gnosis Beacon Chain validator set is expanding rapidly with 113,665 active validators at the moment, bringing massive decentralization to the chain. While the GBC shares many similarities with the Ethereum Beacon Chain, there are some notable differences. Notably, GBC has 5-second blocks and < 2-min epochs, which allow for faster transactions and has a lower gas target of $.01 per 100k gas, providing stable transactions. The validator set is economically and geographically diverse, ensuring greater decentralization with lower-stakes, lower-TVL environment.\nThe Gnosis Chain’s unique characteristics such as stable, low-cost transactions offer significant advantages to Uniswap users. With predictable and low gas costs, traders can explore new strategies and approaches that may not be feasible on other chains with variable and high fees, such as the Ethereum mainnet. This presents an opportunity for Uniswap users to optimize their trades and maximize their returns, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience.\nGnosis Chain is committed to increasing their user base and on-chain activity by providing user incentives. To achieve this goal, GC has established an ecosystem fund that is strategically allocated from the GnosisDAO treasury to promote adoption. As part of our joint proposal, we suggest utilizing a portion of these funds to promote Uniswap v3 adoption. This initiative will encourage users to trade and stake their assets, ultimately promoting greater liquidity and activity on the platform. Through this program, we aim to attract more users and establish Uniswap as a leading DeFi protocol on the platform.\n\nProposal \nThis proposal has already been in discussion since April 2022, where it has passed both a snapshot check and temperature check with overwhelming support. Unfortunately, due to the Nomad bridge incident, deployment was put on hold. The Gnosis team has continued to work and push this proposal throughout this time and we believe that it’s fair for their work to come into fruition after a year. \nThis proposal comes at a crucial time as Uniswap’s V3 license is expiring soon. Expectedly, protocols will harp on this opportunity and use the same V3 design to extract value in ecosystems where Uniswap is absent. As such, we believe that it is important for Uniswap to capture this opportunity prior to the license expiration date before forks (which may or may not be safe) arise. \nEchoing the post made by the Gnosis team, Blockchain@Columbia supports Uniswap deployment on Gnosis with Wormhole as the bridge provider for a number of reasons. \nWormhole was recently voted-in as the bridge provider for Uniswap deployment on BSC. With this in mind, Wormhole has the necessary tools to facilitate deployment on Gnosis Chain due to the already developed mechanisms needed for BSC deployment. \nWhile we understand that security is a concern, the extent of Uniswap design that Wormhole will be responsible for are protocol parameters such as fees. \nWe are aware that there is an on-going discussion on using a multi-bridge design; however, it is expected to take months with a high likelihood of delays. On the other hand, deployment on GC is expected to be ready within a week or two after governance approval. \nNote that we are not against changing this design through governance later on should a more secure and efficient method arise. \n\nFinal Thoughts\nAs we stated in our post previously, there is a tradeoff between choosing the most efficient bridge provider and the urgency of deployment. With the bridge assessment committee’s findings expected to be released far later than the license expiry, it’s more pressing to cement Uniswap’s presence on these chains. \nEmphasis should be placed on the primary purpose to execute proposals governing this deployment. This ensures that Uniswap’s decentralized governance model stays robust and responsive to the evolving needs of the ecosystem, regardless of the underlying chain.\nWe believe that when a more efficient design is finalized, multi-chain deployment design should be altered with said solution. \n",

      "title": "Deploy Uniswap V3 on Avalanche",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nWe [Blockchain at Michigan](https://twitter.com/UMichBlockchain) are submitting this [proposal](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-on-avalanche/20587) for initiating Uniswap v3 deployment on the Avalanche blockchain. With the BSL expiring on April 1st, the Uniswap Foundation has [stated](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/cross-chain-deployment-guide/19988?u=gfxlabs) the importance of Uniswap v3 expansion to popular EVM chains. Establishing Uniswap on alt L1s–and not just on Ethereum L2s–is vital for establishing a robust, multichain future. After consulting with the Ava Labs team, we believe that this is a crucial and opportune time for Uniswap to expand to Avalanche’s growing ecosystem.\n\nThe [temperature check passed](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xa47404722b9c8a6fb850cf5de79e8a95f073f06393290949644a627bfe85bced) with **26M (91.26%) YES** votes and **2.5M (8.74%) NO** votes.\n\n## Proposal Motivation\n\nThe primary urgency behind this proposal is the upcoming BSL expiration on April 1st. As soon as the license expires, all entities will have the legal right to duplicate Uniswap v3 and utilize the forked code for commercial purposes. Invariably, large chains like Avalanche will see a rapid influx of v3 copycats, which will dilute the markets on those respective chains. It is therefore imperative for Uniswap v3 to get ahead of the competitors by launching on large chains before duplicates arise. Trader Joe v2, the current leading DEX on Avalanche, did [$92.45M](https://defillama.com/dexs/chains/avalanche) of volume in the past 24 hours (Feb 23)–indicative of the demand for a concentrated liquidity AMM. Due to the continual growth of the Avalanche ecosystem, along with the liquidity present on the platform, we believe that this proposal be enacted as soon as possible to ensure that Uniswap establishes a foothold in the Avalanche DEX market.\n\nWe realize that beyond the chain of deployment, the community must also consider the required cross-chain messaging protocol. Although the DAO previously coalesced to utilize [Wormhole for the BNB Chain deployment](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x6b8df360fdf73085b21fdf5eef9f85916fbde95621a3d454cb20fbe545ffc852), we believe that such a decision should not set a precedent for bridge selection. A vendor lock-in model would prevent the further testing of equally renowned messaging protocols like LayerZero. A handful of delegates and tokenholders have also pioneered a more novel approach to governance messaging, where cross-chain governance relies not on a single bridge but simultaneously on a handful of bridges. Although we see the merits of a [multi-bridge system](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/cross-chain-bridge-assessment-process/20148/1), it will take time for this approach to garner attention and be fully vetted. The DAO can decide to opt into a multi bridge system in the future–but for an agile deployment that can be implemented in the present, we believe that LayerZero is the best solution.\n\n## Current State of Avalanche\nAvalanche is a blockchain platform that utilizes three separate blockchains, the Platform Chain (P-Chain), Contract Chain (C-Chain), and Exchange Chain (X-Chain), to improve scalability and interoperability. These three chains compose a consortium of validators called the Primary Network, which is responsible for Avalanche’s security.\n\nAvalanche operates with the Avalanche consensus algorithm, which is designed to be more efficient than alternative consensus mechanisms and enables EVM-compatibility. The consensus mechanism checks validators’ transaction confirmations randomly by allowing all nodes to work in parallel, increasing the probability that a transaction is valid. The C-Chain leverages the Snowman consensus protocol, which mimics Avalanche consensus but is optimized for smart contract integration. Therefore, most Avalanche dAPP activity currently transpires on the C-chain. \n\nIn comparison to other smart contract platforms, Avalanche touts 2-second time-to-finality, faster than any of its peers (ex. Ethereum finality is 10 minutes). Uniswap on Avalanche would thereby enhance the user experience for both application users and liquidity providers. \n\nAvalanche also allows for an unbounded number of validators without sacrificing block time. This allows for an increasing degree of decentralization over time. In Q4 2022, the platform’s [Nakamoto coefficient increased from 30 to 32](https://nakaflow.io/)–surpassing most other L1s–and is poised to continue in an upward direction. Currently, there are [1,228 validators](https://www.avax.network/validators) and over [233M AVAX tokens staked](https://www.avax.network/validators). The expanding validator set and staked AVAX tokens exemplify a robust L1.\n\nThe Avalanche architecture permits a high degree of scalability through its ecosystem of subnets. Similar to Ethereum’s L2s, subnets allow for outsourcing blockspace from the Primary Network to alternative blockchains. Application-specific blockchains can be launched under customized subnets, granting builders control over their development stack (subnets specify their own execution logic, fee regime, state, networking, and security). Large protocols that initially relied on the C-Chain, like DFK and StepNetwork, are now migrating to their individualized subnets. The increase in subnets furthers the security of Avalanche since each subnet’s validators must simultaneously secure the Primary Network.\n\nIncreased application activity on the C-Chain and subnets presents Avalanche as an expanding ecosystem. At the time of writing, according to [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/chains), Avalanche holds over $950M of TVL across 281 different protocols.\n\nSince launching in Q3 2020, Avalanche’s txn count has cumulatively increased to nearly [700M](https://avascan.info/). Messari reported that between Nov 2021 - Nov 2022 alone, the network experienced [YoY txn growth of 1,507%](https://research.nansen.ai/article/529/avalanche-scaling-with-subnets). Although [daily active users remained relatively steady since Summer 2022](https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/avalanche), average daily transactions increased from ~1M to ~3M, indicating the emergence of power users. A reliable user base is imperative for a properly functioning Uniswap protocol. The presence of long-term liquidity provision would aid in bootstrapping individual subnets as well as making the C-Chain more robust.\n\nPost deployment, the most fierce competitor for Uni v3 will be Trader Joe. Since Trader Joe recently released a Uni v3-like, [capital efficient AMM](https://docs.traderjoexyz.com/), Uniswap has an incentive to capture as much of Avalanche’s DEX market prior to Trader Joe v2 locking in a concrete user base. Plus, after the BSL expires in April, numerous Uni v3 forks will invariably launch on Avalanche. Therefore, to minimize Uniswap’s dilution in the Avalanche ecosystem, the DAO is incentivized to launch v3 as soon as possible.\n\nDue to Uniswap’s strong brand, it has the ability to capture market share from existing DEXs and attract liquidity from new users. A notable historical anecdote is Polygon. Once Uni v3 launched on Polygon, it quickly acquired market share from both Quickswap and Sushiswap. Although this experiment is yet to be tested on an alt L1, it is likely that a similar pattern will surface on Avalanche–although Trader Joe may present a higher degree of friction. Nonetheless, it is not necessary that the DEX competition will result in a zero-sum game and can favor both Trader Joe and Uniswap simultaneously. \n\nApart from DeFi developments, Avalanche has also made strides in other sectors like gaming, NFTs, and user adoption. Further facilitation of each of these categories is enabled by a DEX like Uniswap. And in turn, Uniswap liquidity providers–and maybe token holders–will attain economic value from the protocol’s increased usage. \n\n## Safety and Cross-Chain Governance\n\n### LayerZero Overview\nWe propose using LayerZero, an omnichain bridging solution, to facilitate cross-chain message passing between Ethereum and Avalanche. LayerZero has pre-existing support for both Avalanche and Ethereum.\n\nThe [first use case of Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) transfer](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/layerzero-aims-to-create-one-unified-experience-for-btc-b-339eb4d23672) has been active for nearly 4 months on Avalanche. LayerZero allows Avalanche BTC (BTC.b) bridging between all LayerZero-supported chains, creating a composable, unified liquidity system for BTC. From the 25+ supported chains, two, DFK and Swimmer, are run as their own subnets. Apart from cross-chain asset transferring, LayerZero also supports arbitrary message passing–which includes governance communication between Uniswap on Ethereum to Avalanche.\n\nLayerZero is backed by the likes of a16z, Sequoia, Uniswap Labs, Coinbase, and numerous others–it is supported by thousands of cross-chain builders with over 2,000 contracts deployed on mainnet, ~700 unique applications, ~2M total messages, ~$5B transactional volume, and billions of dollars in TVL.\n\n**Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?**\nLayerZero endpoints rely on an architecture leveraging Ultra Light Nodes and two off-chain entities called oracles and relayers to securely relay messages between endpoints on a source and destination chain. The oracle is responsible for relaying block headers, and with the default LayerZero setup, will be handled by Chainlink. A transaction proof is sent using the relayer; the default relayer is operated by LayerZero. Hence, the security of the system relies on 2 entities. The primary assumption behind this setup is that the oracle and relayer remain independent at all times. Collusion between the entities would lead to a compromised system. Uniswap will have the option to operate one or both of these entities which would decrease the possibility of collusion.\n\n**Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?**\nLayerZero leverages direct MPT validation construction of the source transaction and verifies the merkle inclusion proof directly on the destination chain via the protocol’s novel Ultra Light Node (ULN).\n\n**Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?**\nMalicious message transmission is a possibility if there is a compromise of both the oracle and relayer sets. Both entities would have to agree to approve a fraudulent message together and against the same application. For example, the decentralized Chainlink DON would have to actively collude with the LayerZero Labs relayer at the same time to enable passing of a malicious message. If the application selects multiple oracles and multiple relayers, thereby pricing its security higher, fraudulent message passing would require more independent parties to be simultaneously compromised.\n\n**What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?**\nUnlike some other bridges, LayerZero does not pose an economic stake or bond to punish malicious actors via a slashing mechanism. Instead, if the default oracle-relayer configuration is compromised, then there is a reputational backlash that would beset LayerZero and Chainlink–since they are the entities responsible for the relayer and oracle, respectively. However, if Uniswap decides to control the messaging stack by running either the oracle or relayer, then Uniswap itself will have to answer for its shortcomings if there happens to be malicious activity.\n\nLayerZero is also designed to be censorship resistant. Oracles and Relayers cannot censor messages without censoring all messages due to the sequential nonce ordered enforcement on the receiving chain. As a result, if an attacker obtained control of the Uniswap-selected Oracles or Relayers, and succeeded in censoring a message, every subsequent message would also be censored and the vote would stop. Uniswap could then expediently resolve the issue by updating configurations and messaging would resume.\n\n**Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?**\nImmutability is part and parcel to LayerZero’s infrastructure. Its smart contracts are not upgradable and therefore aren’t prone to bugs due to smart contract updates. Smart contract bugs is the predominant historical cause for bridge exploits, as was the case with Wormhole’s $300M and Nomad’s $190M hack in 2022. To ensure that the current LayerZero contracts are reliable enough to be set in stone and entirely independent from LayerZero Labs’ future involvements, the protocol has been [audited 35+ times](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/Audits) and reviewed at least 3+ times by the LayerZero Labs team.\n\nLayerZero is the only major cross-chain messaging protocol to have secured significant transaction volume (~$5B) over time without any exploit, compromise of key infrastructure, or loss of user funds. Additionally, LayerZero has the [largest live bug bounty across the industry at up to $15M](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/layerzero-security-update-april-2022-4c27a22380b4).\n\n### Future Bridge Alterations\nFollowing deployment, if Uniswap governance would like to switch to a different bridge setup, the DAO can do so with a future proposal. There are current ruminations regarding a multi bridge messaging setup–but that is too early to implement for this proposal. Much like the recent BNB Chain deployment proposal, we recommend utilizing a single bridge for the time being and integrating a more novel system later on after the BSL expiration. \n\n## License Exemption\nWe are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow LayerZero to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Avalanche, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap v3 will be deployed on Avalanche by LayerZero Labs through the “[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script](https://github.com/Uniswap/deploy-v3#deploy-uniswap-v3-script)”. LayerZero Labs would be permitted to use subcontractors to do this work.\n\n## Timeline\nOnce the on-chain governance proposal is completed, LayerZero Labs will deploy the Uniswap v3 smart contracts on the Avalanche C-Chain. Uniswap Labs will handle the front-end integration updates and include Avalanche to the auto router. Altogether, this deployment will take ~5 weeks to complete.",

      "title": "[Temperature Check] Deploy Uniswap v3 onto Kava EVM Network",
      "content": "\nFranklinDAO Governance (previously PennBlockchain) and Kava Labs are submitting this proposal to deploy Uniswap v3 on Kava Network.\n\nKava Labs: @tommykavalabs\n\nSummary\n\nWe believe Kava’s co-chain architecture will be highly beneficial to the Uniswap ecosystem. Furthermore, Kava’s programs and newly implemented multi-chain Ethereum bridge positions the Kava Network for extraordinary growth in the next coming years. Through this deployment, both Uniswap and Kava can mutually benefit from operating within one another’s ecosystems.\n\nWe welcome feedback from the community on the proposal, including suggestions on how it can be improved.\n\nAbout Kava\n\nKava Chain is a L1 blockchain built with Cosmos SDK that implements a co-chain infrastructure that leverages the capabilities of both Cosmos and Ethereum. The Cosmos co-chain is highly scalable and allows Kava to connect to the over 35 chains and over $60B within the Cosmos ecosystem through its Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. It is optimized for Cosmos SDK developers and incorporates Cosmos’ security and speed in Kava’s infrastructure. The Ethereum co-chain supports EVM smart contract compatibility that enables Kava to execute the majority of current smart contracts. The Kava translator module allows both of these co-chains to operate and communicate with each other seamlessly, enabling developers to develop projects in their choice of execution environment.\n\nKava Labs is the developer team responsible for launching and maintaining Kava’s native protocols. These protocols are the following:\n\nKava Mint: Kava Mint is a CDP protocol that allows users to deposit tokens as collateral and receive the Kava native stablecoin USDX. This loan usually has interest rates hovering between 0-5%. USDX can be used in the Kava DeFi ecosystem to earn rewards.\n\nKava Lend: Kava Lend is the borrowing and lending platform on Kava where users can supply or borrow tokens accepted by the network. Supply or borrowing tokens gives users the opportunity to earn APY.\n\nKava Swap: Kava Swap is a DEX protocol that allows users to swap tokens accepted by the network. Providing liquidity in these pools gives users the chance to earn extra APY.\n\nKava Earn: Kava Earn is a protocol that allows users to invest in complex DeFi strategies with a simplified supply/withdrawal system.\n\nKava’s latest updates are Kava 11 and Kava 12, which both add additional improvements to growth incentives and network security. In terms of growth, Kava is launching Kava Liquid, which will be its first fully convertible staking protocol. Kava Liquid will unlock all staked bKAVA for use in DeFi protocols that operate on the Kava Network. This will be further supported by new protocol Kava Boost which will let users “supercharge” their Kava rewards with bKAVA. In terms of security, the Kava Network is forming the Kava Foundation to enhance network security and aid in critical infrastructure development. The Kava Foundation will determine how to use the Kava community pool to improve critical infrastructure on the network.\n\nProposal\n\nUniswap’s deployment on Kava would be immensely beneficial to the Uniswap Foundation, becoming an early pillar in the core infrastructure of a rapidly growing network. As a proven L1 network with a highly active user-base, the Kava network provides many benefits currently unrealized to the Uniswap network. Below are some critical improvements that Uniswap deployment on Kava would bring:\n\nDeveloper Incentive Programs: In early 2022, Kava launched its Kava Rise program, a $750M on-chain developer incentive program. The program funding model distributes rewards to developers building on Kava’s Ethereum co-chain and Cosmos co-chain. The top 100 DeFi protocols on Kava receive pro-rata rewards distributions every month based on user activity on that protocol. Uniswap’s deployment on Kava would allow Uniswap projects to acquire a significant amount of this $750M allocation. Becoming active on the Kava Network early in this program’s lifespan would enable Uniswap based projects to thrive on this rapidly growing network.\n\nEntry into Cosmos Ecosystem: Uniswap’s deployment on Kava would also enable access to the Cosmos project ecosystem. Cosmos is one of the most widely utilized execution environments, with Kava’s use of its IBC protocol allowing access to the 35+ chains and $60B on the Cosmos ecosystem. Uniswap would gain access to this wide range of users and projects to improve its own ecosystem.\n\nUnlocking Liquidity: The recent Kava 11 update launched Kava Liquid, which establishes a foundation for unlocking all staked bKAVA on the network for use in protocols. Converting staked KAVA to bKAVA and supplying bKAVA to new protocols to boost APY improves the performance of all protocols on the Kava network. By deploying Uniswap on Kava, Uniswap protocols can take advantage of these new features to boost their own returns and increase their user activity.\n\nReinforces Ethos: Kava 11 and 12 recently launched new initiatives that encourage Uniswap’s ethos of decentralization and security. Kava Liquid allows users to select validators and retain voting power even while staking. This ensures that users are still decentralized and possess their own voting rights. Kava 12 also announced its implementation of Cosmos DAO technology to assist in emission control for the Kava Community Pool. The community pool will be utilized to address critical infrastructure needs as the network continues to scale. Both of these elements support key characteristics of Uniswap’s DAO ethos.\n\nSecurity\n\nGiven all the discussion and somewhat ambiguity around the bridging solution, we would like to proceed with first a snapshot check on the deployment onto Kava Chain itself, followed by that respective on-chain vote. Then, if this passes, we will have a snapshot vote to finalize what bridging solution will be used. Below, we highlight Axelar bridge, a solution proposed and recommended by the team. However, to be clear, this bridge will be voted on after (if) the deployment vote itself passes and then, incorporating community feedback, a snapshot vote will happen to finalize this.\n\nAxelar: Axelar is a decentralized interchain protocol implemented in Byzantine systems like that used in Kava. It contains a dynamic validator set that connects across a diverse set of consensus mechanisms with arbitrary payloads. Some of the core features of Axelar include:\n\nA permissionless set of 60 validators based on delegated proof-of-stake consensus on the Cosmos SDK.\nSecurity policies for validators like mandatory key rotations and network suspension function in the case of malicious activity.\nCompletion of over 20 audits and bug bounties to ensure the network is at its most secure.\nAxelar also provides a wide variety of other functions that serve interoperability needs. These include token transfers that allow the sending and retrieving of tokens across chains. It additionally includes general messaging passing that enables any function to be called on EVM chains from within dApps. Axelar also supports gas services that assist in prepaying the estimated cost for any generally messaging passing action.\n\nDetails for Incentivized Adoption\n\nUpon deployment, Uniswap would be enrolled into the $750M Kava Rise incentive program. This is a TVL based liquidity mining program, where each protocol on the Kava chain receives incentives in proportion to the amount of TVL on the chain. Current reward distribution is 1M Kava/month. The reward distribution amount will also increase as the ecosystem grows, based on governance vote. Rewards are distributed monthly, usually by the second half of the following month.\n\nBecause of this important deployment, the team is allocating at least $3M over the next 3 years to these Uniswap pools, from the Kava Rise incentive program. We expect the real allocation to be much higher over the year, depending on how much market share Uniswap attracts.\n\nAs an example, DefiLlama currently reports Uniswap v3 to have $66.94M TVL on Optimism.\n\nIf Uniswap had the same amount of TVL on Kava, we can do the math:\n\n($66.94M/$305.39M - total Kava TVL) =21.91% of total TVL on Kava\n\nUniswap would essentially be getting 21.91% of monthly rewards for that month, which is 1M Kava *21.91% = 219,100 Kava that month.\n\nThese rewards are paid out every single month, and the Kava Rise program is planned to run for several years. A weighted average of TVL reported by DefiLlama is used for calculation of rewards. There are no lock ups for the rewards. Rewards will be administered by the Kava Labs team.\n\nLicense Exemption\n\nWe are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow Kava Labs to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Kava provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on Kava by Kava Labs]through the “Deploy Uniswap V3 Script 21” albeit we may need to modify the compilation step with approval from the Uniswap Labs team.\n\nTimeline\n\nAfter passing the initial Snapshot Check to deploy to Kava EVM, we are looking forward to an on-chain vote, and granted that is passed, we will then have a snapshot vote to determine and finalize what bridging solution we will be using. Then we will be ready to deploy Uniswap v3 onto the Kava EVM network.",

      "title": "[Temperature Check] Deploy Uniswap v3 on Avalanche ",
      "content": "We [Blockchain at Michigan](https://twitter.com/UMichBlockchain) are submitting this proposal for initiating Uniswap v3 deployment on the Avalanche blockchain. With the BSL expiring on April 1st, the Uniswap Foundation has [stated](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/cross-chain-deployment-guide/19988?u=gfxlabs) the importance of Uniswap v3 expansion to popular EVM chains. Establishing Uniswap on alt L1s–and not just on Ethereum L2s–is vital for establishing a robust, multichain future. After consulting with the Ava Labs team, we believe that this is a crucial and opportune time for Uniswap to expand to Avalanche’s growing ecosystem.\n\n## Proposal Motivation\n\nThe primary urgency behind this proposal is the upcoming BSL expiration on April 1st. As soon as the license expires, all entities will have the legal right to duplicate Uniswap v3 and utilize the forked code for commercial purposes. Invariably, large chains like Avalanche will see a rapid influx of v3 copycats, which will dilute the markets on those respective chains. It is therefore imperative for Uniswap v3 to get ahead of the competitors by launching on large chains before duplicates arise. Trader Joe v2, the current leading DEX on Avalanche, did [$92.45M](https://defillama.com/dexs/chains/avalanche) of volume in the past 24 hours (Feb 23)–indicative of the demand for a concentrated liquidity AMM. Due to the continual growth of the Avalanche ecosystem, along with the liquidity present on the platform, we believe that this proposal be enacted as soon as possible to ensure that Uniswap establishes a foothold in the Avalanche DEX market.\n\nWe realize that beyond the chain of deployment, the community must also consider the required cross-chain messaging protocol. Although the DAO previously coalesced to utilize [Wormhole for the BNB Chain deployment](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x6b8df360fdf73085b21fdf5eef9f85916fbde95621a3d454cb20fbe545ffc852), we believe that such a decision should not set a precedent for bridge selection. A vendor lock-in model would prevent the further testing of equally renowned messaging protocols like LayerZero. A handful of delegates and tokenholders have also pioneered a more novel approach to governance messaging, where cross-chain governance relies not on a single bridge but simultaneously on a handful of bridges. Although we see the merits of a [multi-bridge system](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/cross-chain-bridge-assessment-process/20148/1), it will take time for this approach to garner attention and be fully vetted. The DAO can decide to opt into a multi bridge system in the future–but for an agile deployment that can be implemented in the present, we believe that LayerZero is the best solution.\n\n## Current State of Avalanche\nAvalanche is a blockchain platform that utilizes three separate blockchains, the Platform Chain (P-Chain), Contract Chain (C-Chain), and Exchange Chain (X-Chain), to improve scalability and interoperability. These three chains compose a consortium of validators called the Primary Network, which is responsible for Avalanche’s security.\n\nAvalanche operates with the Avalanche consensus algorithm, which is designed to be more efficient than alternative consensus mechanisms and enables EVM-compatibility. The consensus mechanism checks validators’ transaction confirmations randomly by allowing all nodes to work in parallel, increasing the probability that a transaction is valid. The C-Chain leverages the Snowman consensus protocol, which mimics Avalanche consensus but is optimized for smart contract integration. Therefore, most Avalanche dAPP activity currently transpires on the C-chain. \n\nIn comparison to other smart contract platforms, Avalanche touts 2-second time-to-finality, faster than any of its peers (ex. Ethereum finality is 10 minutes). Uniswap on Avalanche would thereby enhance the user experience for both application users and liquidity providers. \n\nAvalanche also allows for an unbounded number of validators without sacrificing block time. This allows for an increasing degree of decentralization over time. In Q4 2022, the platform’s [Nakamoto coefficient increased from 30 to 32](https://nakaflow.io/)–surpassing most other L1s–and is poised to continue in an upward direction. Currently, there are [1,228 validators](https://www.avax.network/validators) and over [233M AVAX tokens staked](https://www.avax.network/validators). The expanding validator set and staked AVAX tokens exemplify a robust L1.\n\nThe Avalanche architecture permits a high degree of scalability through its ecosystem of subnets. Similar to Ethereum’s L2s, subnets allow for outsourcing blockspace from the Primary Network to alternative blockchains. Application-specific blockchains can be launched under customized subnets, granting builders control over their development stack (subnets specify their own execution logic, fee regime, state, networking, and security). Large protocols that initially relied on the C-Chain, like DFK and StepNetwork, are now migrating to their individualized subnets. The increase in subnets furthers the security of Avalanche since each subnet’s validators must simultaneously secure the Primary Network.\n\nIncreased application activity on the C-Chain and subnets presents Avalanche as an expanding ecosystem. At the time of writing, according to [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/chains), Avalanche holds over $950M of TVL across 281 different protocols.\n\nSince launching in Q3 2020, Avalanche’s txn count has cumulatively increased to nearly [700M](https://avascan.info/). Messari reported that between Nov 2021 - Nov 2022 alone, the network experienced [YoY txn growth of 1,507%](https://research.nansen.ai/article/529/avalanche-scaling-with-subnets). Although [daily active users remained relatively steady since Summer 2022](https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/avalanche), average daily transactions increased from ~1M to ~3M, indicating the emergence of power users. A reliable user base is imperative for a properly functioning Uniswap protocol. The presence of long-term liquidity provision would aid in bootstrapping individual subnets as well as making the C-Chain more robust.\n\nPost deployment, the most fierce competitor for Uni v3 will be Trader Joe. Since Trader Joe recently released a Uni v3-like, [capital efficient AMM](https://docs.traderjoexyz.com/), Uniswap has an incentive to capture as much of Avalanche’s DEX market prior to Trader Joe v2 locking in a concrete user base. Plus, after the BSL expires in April, numerous Uni v3 forks will invariably launch on Avalanche. Therefore, to minimize Uniswap’s dilution in the Avalanche ecosystem, the DAO is incentivized to launch v3 as soon as possible.\n\nDue to Uniswap’s strong brand, it has the ability to capture market share from existing DEXs and attract liquidity from new users. A notable historical anecdote is Polygon. Once Uni v3 launched on Polygon, it quickly acquired market share from both Quickswap and Sushiswap. Although this experiment is yet to be tested on an alt L1, it is likely that a similar pattern will surface on Avalanche–although Trader Joe may present a higher degree of friction. Nonetheless, it is not necessary that the DEX competition will result in a zero-sum game and can favor both Trader Joe and Uniswap simultaneously. \n\nApart from DeFi developments, Avalanche has also made strides in other sectors like gaming, NFTs, and user adoption. Further facilitation of each of these categories is enabled by a DEX like Uniswap. And in turn, Uniswap liquidity providers–and maybe token holders–will attain economic value from the protocol’s increased usage. \n\n## Safety and Cross-Chain Governance\n\n### LayerZero Overview\nWe propose using LayerZero, an omnichain bridging solution, to facilitate cross-chain message passing between Ethereum and Avalanche. LayerZero has pre-existing support for both Avalanche and Ethereum.\n\nThe [first use case of Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) transfer](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/layerzero-aims-to-create-one-unified-experience-for-btc-b-339eb4d23672) has been active for nearly 4 months on Avalanche. LayerZero allows Avalanche BTC (BTC.b) bridging between all LayerZero-supported chains, creating a composable, unified liquidity system for BTC. From the 25+ supported chains, two, DFK and Swimmer, are run as their own subnets. Apart from cross-chain asset transferring, LayerZero also supports arbitrary message passing–which includes governance communication between Uniswap on Ethereum to Avalanche.\n\nLayerZero is backed by the likes of a16z, Sequoia, Uniswap Labs, Coinbase, and numerous others–it is supported by thousands of cross-chain builders with over 2,000 contracts deployed on mainnet, ~700 unique applications, ~2M total messages, ~$5B transactional volume, and billions of dollars in TVL.\n\n**Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?**\n\nLayerZero endpoints rely on an architecture leveraging Ultra Light Nodes and two off-chain entities called oracles and relayers to securely relay messages between endpoints on a source and destination chain. The oracle is responsible for relaying block headers, and with the default LayerZero setup, will be handled by Chainlink. A transaction proof is sent using the relayer; the default relayer is operated by LayerZero. Hence, the security of the system relies on 2 entities. The primary assumption behind this setup is that the oracle and relayer remain independent at all times. Collusion between the entities would lead to a compromised system. Uniswap will have the option to operate one or both of these entities which would decrease the possibility of collusion.\n\n**Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?**\n\nLayerZero leverages direct MPT validation construction of the source transaction and verifies the merkle inclusion proof directly on the destination chain via the protocol’s novel Ultra Light Node (ULN).\n\n**Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?**\n\nMalicious message transmission is a possibility if there is a compromise of both the oracle and relayer sets. Both entities would have to agree to approve a fraudulent message together and against the same application. For example, the decentralized Chainlink DON would have to actively collude with the LayerZero Labs relayer at the same time to enable passing of a malicious message. If the application selects multiple oracles and multiple relayers, thereby pricing its security higher, fraudulent message passing would require more independent parties to be simultaneously compromised.\n\n**What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?**\n\nUnlike some other bridges, LayerZero does not pose an economic stake or bond to punish malicious actors via a slashing mechanism. Instead, if the default oracle-relayer configuration is compromised, then there is a reputational backlash that would beset LayerZero and Chainlink–since they are the entities responsible for the relayer and oracle, respectively. However, if Uniswap decides to control the messaging stack by running either the oracle or relayer, then Uniswap itself will have to answer for its shortcomings if there happens to be malicious activity.\n\nLayerZero is also designed to be censorship resistant. Oracles and Relayers cannot censor messages without censoring all messages due to the sequential nonce ordered enforcement on the receiving chain. As a result, if an attacker obtained control of the Uniswap-selected Oracles or Relayers, and succeeded in censoring a message, every subsequent message would also be censored and the vote would stop. Uniswap could then expediently resolve the issue by updating configurations and messaging would resume.\n\n**Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?**\n\nImmutability is part and parcel to LayerZero’s infrastructure. Its smart contracts are not upgradable and therefore aren’t prone to bugs due to smart contract updates. Smart contract bugs is the predominant historical cause for bridge exploits, as was the case with Wormhole’s $300M and Nomad’s $190M hack in 2022. To ensure that the current LayerZero contracts are reliable enough to be set in stone and entirely independent from LayerZero Labs’ future involvements, the protocol has been [audited 35+ times](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/Audits) and reviewed at least 3+ times by the LayerZero Labs team.\n\nLayerZero is the only major cross-chain messaging protocol to have secured significant transaction volume (~$5B) over time without any exploit, compromise of key infrastructure, or loss of user funds. Additionally, LayerZero has the [largest live bug bounty across the industry at up to $15M](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/layerzero-security-update-april-2022-4c27a22380b4).\n\n### Future Bridge Alterations\nFollowing deployment, if Uniswap governance would like to switch to a different bridge setup, the DAO can do so with a future proposal. There are current ruminations regarding a multi bridge messaging setup–but that is too early to implement for this proposal. Much like the recent BNB Chain deployment proposal, we recommend utilizing a single bridge for the time being and integrating a more novel system later on after the BSL expiration. \n\n## License Exemption\nWe are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow LayerZero to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Avalanche, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap v3 will be deployed on Avalanche by LayerZero Labs through the “[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script](https://github.com/Uniswap/deploy-v3#deploy-uniswap-v3-script)”. LayerZero Labs would be permitted to use subcontractors to do this work.\n\n## Timeline\nOnce the on-chain governance proposal is completed, LayerZero Labs will deploy the Uniswap v3 smart contracts on the Avalanche C-Chain. Uniswap Labs will handle the front-end integration updates and include Avalanche to the auto router. Altogether, this deployment will take ~5 weeks to complete.",

      "title": "Enable 1bp Fee Tier for UniswapV3 on Arbitrum",
      "content": "**By GFX Labs & ConsenSys**\n## Rationale:\n\nThis proposal seeks to deploy a 1bp fee tier for UniswapV3 on Arbitrum. This will allow users to trade with lower fees, making it more accessible and competitive with other decentralized exchanges. The optionality of a 1bp fee tier is useful for stable-to-stable swapping and can often be found among the top ten liquidity pools on each of Uniswap’s respective deployments. \n\nSince the launch of the 1bp fee tier on mainnet, [Polygon](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/polygon-1bp-fee-tier/16488), and [Optimism](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-a-1bp-fee-tier-to-uniswapv3-on-optimism/16930), the 1bp fee tier has directly led to growth in Uniswap’s DEX market share and directly competes with stablecoin DEX protocols. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1EjR5t3j.png)\n[Source](https://dune.com/1a1/DEX-Market-Share-for-Stablecoins)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJYsRqF2o.png)\n[Source](https://dune.com/1a1/DEX-Market-Share-for-Stablecoins)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByTsRqY3s.png)\n[Source](https://dune.com/1a1/DEX-Market-Share-for-Stablecoins)\n\nBenefits:\n* Lower fee tiers increase competitiveness and incentivize more user activity.\n* As liquidity is more concentrated, 1bp pools are more capital efficient, especially for stable-to-stable swaps.\n* Lower fee tiers can also lead to increased volume and earnings for liquidity providers.\n## Why Arbitrum:\nFavorable outcomes from deploying the 1bp fee tier on all other existing Uniswap v3 deployments make this an uncontroversial upgrade of the Arbitrum deployment.\n\nArbitrum has a thriving ecosystem of DeFi dapps that will benefit from less stable-to-stable friction. The Uniswap deployment on Arbitrum currently has [~200M of TVL and ~160M of volume](https://info.uniswap.org/#/arbitrum/). With Curve’s liquidity bribing mechanism losing efficiency, Uniswap is in a strong position to compete for traders’ flow and LPs’ liquidity by providing more competitive fee tiers. \n\nOutlined from the [discussion](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-enable-a-1bp-fee-tier-for-uniswapv3-on-arbitrum/20116) + additions.\n## Proposal\nTarget: [Arbitrum Delayed Inbox](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4dbd4fc535ac27206064b68ffcf827b0a60bab3f#code)\nFunction: createRetryableTicket\n* To: [Arbitrum UniswapV3 Factory](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984)\n* l2CallValue: 0\n* maxSubmissionCost: 300000000000000\n* excessFeeRefundAddress: Uniswap Timelock\n* callValueRefundAddress: Uniswap Timelock\n* gasLimt: 200000\n* maxFeePerGas: 1000000000\n* Data: 0x8a7c195f00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000640000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001",

      "title": "Deploy Uniswap V3 on BNB Chain",
      "content": "# Description\n**0xPlasma Labs** is submitting a Governance Proposal to deploy Uniswap v3 to BNB Chain on behalf of the Uniswap Community. The [temperature check](URL:https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xa3c7247632d3a08e4e73a63867908d0cd4402f48fa673945f93e3197dee5450a) passed with **20M (80.28%) YES** votes and 4.9M (19.72%) NO votes. Here is a link to the [Proposal Discussion](URL:https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-update-deploy-uniswap-v3-1-0-3-0-05-0-01-on-bnb-chain-binance/19734) on Uniswap Governance Forum.\n\n# Proposal\nThis proposal will authorize [0xPlasma Labs](URL:http://plasma.finance/) to deploy the [Uniswap v3 protocol](URL:https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core) to the BNB PoS Chain on behalf of the community. We believe this is the best moment for Uniswap v3 to deploy on BNB PoS Chain, for many reasons (one of them is License expiration).\n\n## About BNB Chain\n[BNB Chain](URL:https://bnbchain.org/) is a decentralized, public blockchain that operates using a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. It is designed to support the development and deployment of decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and is powered by the Binance Coin (BNB) token. BNB Chain is operated by Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange and blockchain technology company, but is open to participation and contributions from a global community of developers, users, and stakeholders.\n\n1. BNB Chain has a large and growing user base, providing a potential new market for Uniswap v3.\n2. BNB Chain offers high transaction speeds and low fees, making it a suitable platform for Uniswap’s decentralized exchange services.\n3. Deploying to BNB Chain could help Uniswap to tap into the growing popularity of DeFi in the Binance ecosystem.\n4. BNB Chain offers unique features such as staking and cross-chain support that could enhance Uniswap v3’s functionality.\n5. BNB Chain’s strong governance model and active community could provide valuable support and feedback for the development of Uniswap v3.\n6. Binance, the company behind BNB Chain, has a strong track record of supporting and promoting high-quality projects, potentially providing valuable exposure for Uniswap v3.\n7. Binance has a global presence and a strong brand, which could help increase awareness and adoption of Uniswap v3 among retail and institutional investors.\n8. Binance offers a range of products and services that could be integrated with Uniswap v3, such as the Binance Smart Chain and Binance DEX.\n9. Deploying to BNB Chain could provide opportunities for collaboration and partnerships with other projects on the Binance ecosystem.\n10. BNB Chain strongly focuses on security and compliance, providing a safe and trusted environment for Uniswap v3 to operate.\n11. BNB Chain has a robust ecosystem of dApps and DeFi projects, providing potential opportunities for collaboration and co-development.\n12. BNB Chain’s support for on-chain governance could enable Uniswap v3 to adopt a more decentralized and community-driven development model.\n13. BNB Chain’s support for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) could enable Uniswap v3 to adopt a more decentralized and community-driven business model.\n14. BNB Chain’s strong emphasis on community engagement and participation could provide valuable support and feedback for Uniswap v3.\n15. BNB Chain’s commitment to regulatory compliance could provide valuable support for Uniswap v3 as it seeks to expand into new markets and jurisdictions.\n16. BNB Chain’s support for tokenization and digital asset management could enable Uniswap v3 to offer new services and features for users.\n17. BNB Chain’s a fast-developing ecosystem of decentralized finance dapps and assets.\n\n> [DeFi Llama](URL:https://defillama.com/) has the overall TVL of DeFi at $49B, of which **$29B** is on Ethereum. The second largest is [BSC](URL:https://defillama.com/chain/BSC) at **$5B**. Pancake Swap has $2.35B in TVL. Dune reports BSC as having 753k weekly users. It is a significant number of users Uniswap should be pursuing.\n\n## Security & Bridges\nSince the [Temperature Check](URL:https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xa3c7247632d3a08e4e73a63867908d0cd4402f48fa673945f93e3197dee5450a), we have discussed with stakeholders within the Uniswap ecosystem, who have expressed a desire to see trust-minimized bridges used for governance for the new Uniswap v3 deployment on BNB Chain. On the [Governance Forum](URL:https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-update-deploy-uniswap-v3-1-0-3-0-05-0-01-on-bnb-chain-binance/19734), teams presented several bridge solutions: [DeBridge](URL:https://debridge.finance/), [Celer](URL:https://www.celer.network/), [Wormhole](URL:https://wormhole.com/), [Layer Zero](URL:https://layerzero.network/). Based on the technical assessment of presented bridges by 0xPlasma Labs, GFXLabs, Uniswap Foundation and Uniswap community discussion, we've decided to move forward with another [Temperature Check](URL:https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x6b8df360fdf73085b21fdf5eef9f85916fbde95621a3d454cb20fbe545ffc852) regarding Bridge Infrastructure for BNB Chain, where we listed all four candidates.\n\nAs a result of a very [complex discussion](URL:https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-update-deploy-uniswap-v3-1-0-3-0-05-0-01-on-bnb-chain-binance/19734) and voting on the [Snapshot](URL:https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x6b8df360fdf73085b21fdf5eef9f85916fbde95621a3d454cb20fbe545ffc852), the community chose the [Wormhole](URL:https://wormhole.com/) bridge for the Uniswap v3 deployment on BNB Chain (**with 28M votes**), the second place in the vote was taken by the solution from the Layer Zero team (**17M votes**).\n\n**Here is some major security characteristic of Wormhole bridge:**\n\n1. **Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing?** Yes, Wormhole is one of the first and longest-serving arbitrary messaging protocols. Since launching on mainnet in August 2021, 185 million messages have been transmitted, with [2 million messages](URL:https://wormhole.com/stats/) currently generated daily between asset transfers and messaging through organic usage.\n2. **Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi-sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?** Wormhole is secured by 19 validators (aka: Guardians) who jointly attest to messages. Each message must be attested by at least 13 of the 19 Guardians. Our Guardian set comprises the leading PoS validators, including Staked, Figment, Chorus One, P2P, and more. The complete set of current validators can be found [here](URL:https://wormhole.com/network/). As mentioned above Wormhole is making significant progress in developing ZK-based light clients to facilitate completely trustless message-passing.\n3. **Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is the security provided by another third-party entity?** Wormhole message security waits for both consensuses to be reached on the source chain as well as additional safety features provided by the bridge. Additionally, Guardians run full nodes to protect the protocol against consensus-level exploits in the connected chains and further reduce contagion risk.\n4. **Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?** All messages passing through Wormhole require a minimum of observation and signing by a majority of the Wormhole Guardian set (13 of 19). While there is currently no out-of-the-box recall mechanism for messages, a minority (7 of 19) Guardians may refuse to sign a fraudulent message and thwart an attack. Simple yet customized message recall functions can be built by individual integrators. An integrator would build “edge contracts” to introduce a time delay on message acceptance, providing an integrator with an opportunity to recall the message before it becomes effective.\n5. **What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?** Wormhole’s Guardians are leading [PoS validators](URL:https://wormhole.com/network/) and some of the most respected names within the validator community. They collectively represent tens of billions in value staked and carry valuable reputations in the communities where they serve. Should they act maliciously (such as a sign or forge fraudulent messages), they risk reputational consequences, external PoS businesses, and ejection from the Wormhole Guardian set. There is little incentive for an individual Guardian to act maliciously. Even if a Guardian were to succeed in forging a fraudulent message, it would not affect the network state because a single signature isn’t enough to establish the super-majority required to gain a quorum. Finally, a fraudulent message would be immediately attributable to the offending Guardian to the rest of the Guardian network.\n6. **Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?** The bridge has been audited 25+ times by leading audit firms, including Certik, Trail of Bits, and OtterSec, and the cohort of auditors continues to grow. You can see the complete list of auditors and publicized findings [here](URL:https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/SECURITY.md#3rd-Party-Security-Audits). Those 25 audits are in addition to Wormhole’s already rigorous internal auditing standards, where a team of 6 experienced security engineers regularly perform reviews of the protocol’s security.\n\nBridge Infrastructure has a significant part in the multi-chain future of Uniswap v3. We received multiple offers from the biggest bridge providers during the proposal discussion. Uniswap Foundation launched a [discussion topic](URL:https://gov.uniswap.org/t/cross-chain-bridge-assessment-process/20148) on the forum for technical bridge assessments (The tentative deadline to provide feedback on the process below is **Friday, February 17th.**), while Celer Team has developed and provided a [multi-bridge contract](URL:https://gov.uniswap.org/t/cross-chain-bridge-assessment-process/20148/4?u=ilia_0x) with the support of multiple bridges (Celer, [DeBridge](URL:https://gov.uniswap.org/t/cross-chain-bridge-assessment-process/20148/9?u=ilia_0x), Wormhole). The [summary](URL:https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-update-deploy-uniswap-v3-1-0-3-0-05-0-01-on-bnb-chain-binance/19734/86?u=ilia_0x) of the current governance proposal progress.\n\n> After the current Governance Proposal passes the voting and deployment on BNB Chain, we plan to continue our research and bridge assessment. As we will find out a new solution we will start a new proposal for updating the current bridge infrastructure.\n\n## License Exemption\nWe are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow the 0xPlasma Labs to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on BNB Chain, a layer 1 EVM compatible blockchain, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on BNB Chain by the 0xPlasma Labs through the “[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script](URL:https://github.com/Uniswap/deploy-v3#deploy-uniswap-v3-script)” 0xPlasma Labs would be permitted to use subcontractors to do this work.\n\n## Timeline\nFollowing the Governance Proposal, [0xPlasma Labs](URL:https://plasma.finance/) will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap V3 deployment on BNB Chain immediately, using Wormhole bridge infrastructure for cross-chain governance messaging.",

      "title": " [Temperature Check] Enable 1bp Fee Tier for UniswapV3 on Arbitrum",
      "content": "\n**By GFX Labs & ConsenSys**\n## Rationale:\n\nThis proposal seeks to deploy a 1bp fee tier for UniswapV3 on Arbitrum. This will allow users to trade with lower fees, making it more accessible and competitive with other decentralized exchanges. The optionality of a 1bp fee tier is useful for stable-to-stable swapping and can often be found among the top ten liquidity pools on each of Uniswap’s respective deployments. \n\nSince the launch of the 1bp fee tier on mainnet, [Polygon](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/polygon-1bp-fee-tier/16488), and [Optimism](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-a-1bp-fee-tier-to-uniswapv3-on-optimism/16930), the 1bp fee tier has directly led to growth in Uniswap’s DEX market share and directly competes with stablecoin DEX protocols. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1EjR5t3j.png)\n[Source](https://dune.com/1a1/DEX-Market-Share-for-Stablecoins)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJYsRqF2o.png)\n[Source](https://dune.com/1a1/DEX-Market-Share-for-Stablecoins)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByTsRqY3s.png)\n[Source](https://dune.com/1a1/DEX-Market-Share-for-Stablecoins)\n\nBenefits:\n* Lower fee tiers increase competitiveness and incentivize more user activity.\n* As liquidity is more concentrated, 1bp pools are more capital efficient, especially for stable-to-stable swaps.\n* Lower fee tiers can also lead to increased volume and earnings for liquidity providers.\n## Why Arbitrum:\nFavorable outcomes from deploying the 1bp fee tier on all other existing Uniswap v3 deployments make this an uncontroversial upgrade of the Arbitrum deployment.\n\nArbitrum has a thriving ecosystem of DeFi dapps that will benefit from less stable-to-stable friction. The Uniswap deployment on Arbitrum currently has [~200M of TVL and ~160M of volume](https://info.uniswap.org/#/arbitrum/). With Curve’s liquidity bribing mechanism losing efficiency, Uniswap is in a strong position to compete for traders’ flow and LPs’ liquidity by providing more competitive fee tiers. \n\nOutlined from the [discussion](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-enable-a-1bp-fee-tier-for-uniswapv3-on-arbitrum/20116) + additions.\n## Proposal\nTarget: [Arbitrum Delayed Inbox](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4dbd4fc535ac27206064b68ffcf827b0a60bab3f#code)\nFunction: createRetryableTicket\n* To: [Arbitrum UniswapV3 Factory](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984)\n* l2CallValue: 0\n* maxSubmissionCost: 300000000000000\n* excessFeeRefundAddress: Uniswap Timelock\n* callValueRefundAddress: Uniswap Timelock\n* gasLimt: 200000\n* maxFeePerGas: 1000000000\n* Data: 0x8a7c195f00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000640000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001",

      "title": "Deploy Uniswap V3 to Boba Network",
      "content": "[Governance Proposal]\n\n## Summary\nThe Boba Foundation is granted an additional use grant to use the Uniswap V3 Core software code (which is made available to the Boba Foundation subject to license available [here ](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/LICENSE)(the “Uniswap Code”)).\n\nAs part of this additional use grant, the Boba Foundation receives license to use the Uniswap Code for the purposes of a full deployment of the Uniswap Protocol v3 onto the Boba Network L2 on Ethereum blockchain. The Boba Foundation is permitted to use subcontractors to do this work. This license is conditional on the Boba Foundation complying with the terms of the Business Source License 1.1, made available at https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/LICENSE.\n\nThe Boba Foundation and FranklinDAO (Prev. Penn Blockchain) are submitting this proposal to Deploy Uniswap v3 on Boba Network.\n\n## Past Voting Links\n[Temperature Check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x5387b0756442268d283d4ac7f3f4bc4cc0204c5e47b9708e5128fcbdea2d0cd1): Passed with 15M Yes Votes\n\n[Consensus Check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xe523d31000db5ecb16b002efd2ee984b958928b01cee140212eefc3ed5bcdfcd): Passed with 17.5M Yes Votes\n\n[Governance Forum Post](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-to-boba-network/18018)\n\n## Summary\nIn cooperation with DMA Labs (a major contributor to [ICHI’s](https://www.ichi.org/) Uniswap v3 management protocols) and support of furthering the vision of Multichain Uniswap 15, the Boba Foundation is proposing that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap v3 to Boba Network.\n\nBoba Network is a blockchain Layer 2 scaling solution and [Hybrid Compute](https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2022/07/boba-networks-hybrid-compute-why-it-will-unlock-blockchains-true-potential) platform offering lightning fast transactions and fees anywhere from 40-100x less than the respective Layer 1. Boba’s Hybrid Compute brings the power of Web2 on-chain, with smarter smart contracts that allow developers and creators to leverage off-chain compute and real-world data to offer an enriched experience unlike anything else on the market today.\n\nIn addition, Boba Network is the first and only [multichain ](https://www.theblock.co/post/149837/ethereum-layer-2-boba-network-integrates-with-fantom-and-moonbeam)Layer 2, deploying on leading Layer 1 chains such as Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB and Moonbeam. Deploying on Boba will expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Boba multichain ecosystem, helping Uniswap on its journey to become a leading product in the multichain world.\n\nThe timeline for deployment will be approximately 3-4 weeks following the Governance Proposal, with contract deployment being handled by the Boba Foundation.\n\n## Proposal\nThere are many benefits for the Uniswap Protocol, some of which include:\n\nEthereum equivalence. Developer tools, resources, projects, and protocols supported by Ethereum are already supported on the Boba Network. A trustless bridge architecture to bridge assets from Ethereum to the Boba Network L2 has been in place since mainnet launch, with many bridging partners extending bridge capabilities, such as Across.to, Synapse, Multichain and Layerswap.\n\nLow cost transactions with high security. As an Ethereum L2, Boba Network relies on Ethereum’s strong base layer security while providing very low cost transactions, with fees anywhere from 40-100x less than Ethereum.\n\n## Details for Incentivized Adoption of Uniswap v3\nBoba Foundation will provide $1M $BOBA tokens to foster the usage of Uniswap v3 on Boba Network. The tokens will be sent to a multisig wallet co-owned by the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) and Boba Foundation, who will work to deploy the funds as follows:\n\nThe incentives should be designed together with other projects which are operating on top of Uniswap v3 such as ICHI, Perpetual Protocol, Paraswap, or 1inch. $BOBA can be used to incentivize liquidity but should not be limited to this use case. Anything increasing the usage of Uniswap v3 on Boba Network, including building new applications on top of Uniswap v3, should be supported. The goal is to deploy the $1M in the time period of one year. Funds not used after two years would go back to the Boba Foundation. The spending is limited to $1M - the transferred amount of $BOBA as part of the proposal. The Boba Foundation may increase this amount based on the outcome of this initiative. In addition to this, the Boba Foundation has already contributed more than $4M of liquidity on Uniswap v3 to bootstrap the initial success of Uniswap v3 on the Boba Network.\n\n## Security\nBoba Network is designed so that users can send arbitrary messages between smart contracts on L2 and L1. Users can relay messages themselves. The security of the messages passed is secured within the rollup protocol. Bridging and sequencing transactions is based on Optimism’s [Optimistic Rollup](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) codebase. From L1 to L2, users need to trigger the CanonicalTransactionChain contract on L1 to create a new block on Boba Network. The Sequencer is then forced to include the transaction on L2. From L2 to L1: Making provable statements about the state of Boba requires a cryptographic commitment in the form of the root of the Boba’s state trie to a smart contract on L1 called the StateCommitmentChain. Updates of the state trie are regularly published. With Merkle tree proofs of the commitments, users can use these proofs to make verifiable statements about the data within the storage of any contract on Boba at a specific block height. This can then be used to enable contracts on Boba L2 to send messages to contracts on L1.\n\nThe bridge uses the security of the source chain (L1). In an Optimistic Rollup design, state commitments are published to L1 without any direct proof of the validity of these commitments. Instead, these commitments are considered pending for a period of time (called the “challenge window”). In the challenge window the commitment could be invalidated through a fraud proof. Fraud proof challenges are not enabled and there’s a single sequencer design currently in production. In the event of fraud, the malicious actor and the prover of fraud will (in the future) play out an interactive challenge game and the malicious actor will be slashed.\n\nThe Boba Network codebase and Optimism’s codebase have undergone multiple audits, with no outstanding vulnerabilities.\n\n## Governance\nTo enable Ethereum’s Uniswap deployment to govern the Boba Network Ethereum L2 instance, Boba Network's Native Bridge will be used to transmit governance decisions from Ethereum L1 to the Boba Network Ethereum L2 instance of Uniswap V3. The Boba Foundation and community would like to thank the GFX Labs team for their attention and guidance through the process.\n\n## License Exemption\nThe Boba Foundation is requesting an exemption that will allow the Licensed Work to be deployed on the Boba Network, a Layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control.\n\n**For - Deploy Uniswap v3 to Boba Network**\n\n**Against - Make no change**",

Additionally, two new bridges – Wormhole and Layer Zero – have raised their hands to be the provider for the BNB deployment (in addition to deBridge, the initial bridge selected prior to Celer).\n\nFor cross-chain deployment proposals, we believe it is most important to optimize for protocol security — specifically, for community members to be able to make informed decisions based on all available information on risks to bridge security. Secondary to that is clarity of process for all governance stakeholders. In order to satisfy both of those conditions, we propose the following next steps for this BNB proposal:\n\n1. **For this BNB proposal only**, we have an additional Temperature Check for the community to vote on the four bridges which have been discussed in the forum or this proposal: deBridge, Celer, Wormhole, and LayerZero.\n\n2.

BNB Chain’s commitment to regulatory compliance could provide valuable support for Uniswap v3 as it seeks to expand into new markets and jurisdictions.\n16. BNB Chain’s support for tokenization and digital asset management could enable Uniswap v3 to offer new services and features for users.\n17. BNB Chain’s a fast-developing ecosystem of decentralized finance dapps and assets.\n\n## Why BNB DeFi ecosystem needs Uniswap v3\n\n* BNB Chain has a big DeFi development community that needs a more advanced DEX ecosystem to boost the general DeFi ecosystem development\n* Bridge supports BNB Chain needs a better liquidity source with less slippage\n* Assets need more reliable DEX infrastructure to provide their users with a better trading experience\n* We need to educate all BNB community about what is real DeFi and yield using Uniswap v3 as a reference.\n\n## What can Uniswap Ecosystem get from BNB chain deployment?\n\n* Additional $1B of TVL + huge trading volume + earned fees for LPs\n* 1-2M new users + UNI holders\n* Huge respect and appreciation from DeFi devs\n* More adoption for Uniswap NFT Platform (as BNB chain has a weak infra for NFTs)\n\n## Financial Incentives for Liquidity\n\nWe can consider a launch of Liquidity Farming and [Quadrat Protocol ](https://plasma.finance/quadrat) for Uniswap v3 on BNB Chain, to attract more liquidity and incentives from BNB protocols and users.\n\n## Security and Governance Bridge\n\n0xPlasma Labs would like to propose using [Celer Bridge](https://www.celer.network/) for the Governance cross-chain messaging.\n\nHere is a piece of information about the Celer Bridge provided by @modong \n\n#### A quick introduction to Celer:\n\nCeler is a generalized blockchain interoperability protocol enabling a one-click user experience accessing tokens, DeFi, GameFi, NFTs, governance, and more across multiple chains. Developers can build inter-chain-native dApps using the Celer Inter-chain Message (IM) SDK 1 to gain access to efficient liquidity utilization, coherent application logic, and shared states. There are 10+ cross-chain applications live today that are built with Celer IM on various use cases including governance and liquidity network protocols. cBridge, a cross-chain asset bridge solution, has processed $12.2b transaction volume across 31 chains for 200K users.\n\n#### How to build Uniswap’s cross-chain governance (with a focus on security models)\n\nCeler IM based cross-chain governance is already live in production with [FutureSwap](https://twitter.com/CelerNetwork/status/1518791556169306113) since the end of April 2022 and has been operating flawlessly since. The reference implementation of cross-chain governance is very straightforward and we describe the high level flow here based on the [application design pattern](https://im-docs.celer.network/developer/celer-im-design-patterns#cross-chain-logic-execution-without-fund-transfer).\n\nWhen a governance decision is made on Ethereum, the governance contract will call [sendMessage](https://github.com/celer-network/sgn-v2-contracts/blob/d879d4cf1a3b69d8cc7c56bb9512a6a493c5be0d/contracts/message/framework/MessageSenderApp.sol#L24) of a “send box” contract which takes in the destination chain ids, message to be passed and destination contract addresses. The message will contain the serialized bytes of the governance decision.\n\nThis message will be synced with State Guardian Network, which is a Cosmos SDK based blockchain. Validators in SGN will witness the message and reach consensus on the Cosmos layer that this message indeeded exists and generate a stake-weighted multisignature attestation that is stored on the chain.\n\nA message executor (can be run by Uniswap or run by validators of Celer Network) will collect this message and call [executeMessage](https://github.com/celer-network/sgn-v2-contracts/blob/d879d4cf1a3b69d8cc7c56bb9512a6a493c5be0d/contracts/message/framework/MessageReceiverApp.sol#L71) of a “receive box” contract. After necessary on-chain validation of the message, the message will be eventually relayed to the destination contract.\n\nThe validation, except for the generic checking of the validity of the signatures, also has two security models available to determine when the target contract will receive the message. The first security model is to directly pass the message on and rely fully on PoS security of the Cosmos chain.\n\nHowever, in the case of low-frequency applications like cross-chain governance, we recommend using the **second security model**: an optimistic rollup-like security model. In this security model, every message that is passed onto the destination chain will be first put into a “quarantine zone” for a configurable period of time. During that quarantine period, every single validator in the SGN and the application executor (collectively, App Guardians) can monitor and cross-check the message arrived on the destination chain vs sent on the source chain. If there is any mismatch, the message path will be cut off immediately and the message will not be executed. This changes the security assumption from “trust majority stake” to “trust any” with app developers capable of running one of the “any” App Guardians themselves. This is how FutureSwap implemented their cross-chain governance module.\n\nOnce the quarantine clock times out, the message will be executed by calling a standard interface on the destination governance contract. This will complete the cross-chain governance process.\n\nNext, we answer the questions raised in the post.\n\n#### Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing?\n\nOf course, this is the core of Celer, and all the cross-chain applications are built on top of this functionality. Celer currently supports arbitrary message passing on all EVM-based chains. For non-EVM chains, Celer supports Aptos, Sui, Flow and Cosmos-based blockchains.\n\n#### Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?\n\nThis is briefly discussed in the previous walkthrough. Here, we provide a more detailed description.\n\nAs discussed above, Celer’s generalized message cross-chain solution comes with two security models and we recommend using the optimistic rollup solution here. More context on Celer’s security models:\n\nCeler comes with two security models that each app and users are free to choose from on a per-tx basis.\n\n1. Cosmos-consensus Security Model\n\nBy default, inter-chain dApps rely on the security of the State Guardian Network (a Cosmos Chain) by processing messages routed from another chain without delay. The SGN offers L1-blockchain level security just like Cosmos or Polygon with it being a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain built on Tendermint with CELR as the staking asset. If a guardian acts maliciously, its staked CELR will be slashed by the consensus protocol. This level of economic security is something that grows with the staked CELR’s value and is simply not available in simple Multi-signature or MPC/PoA-based solutions.\n\n2. Optimistic-rollup-style delay buffer Security Model ( **what should be used in this case** )\n\n![](upload://8uf1PmN8Xra57O4ORLU5SjzZ2AW)\n\nSo, what happens if more than two thirds (in staked value) of the validators behave maliciously in the State Guardian Network? Although this is highly unlikely given the economical security and distributed nature of the validators in Celer Network, Celer does have a second security model, inspired by the Optimistic Rollup design, that works securely even under this worst-case scenario.\n\nInstead of instantly processing a message routed by the SGN, a two-phase commit-confirm pattern is used to process any inter-chain message. Before any application consumes the message, the message has to be “committed” to the blockchain by SGN into a “quarantine zone” for a period of time. Only after the delay has passed, can this message be “confirmed” and pushed to the final destination application.\n\nDuring this delay buffer, a dApp can run an App Guardian service to double-validate the message on the source chain and check the authenticity of the message committed in the quarantine zone. If the App Guardian detects any inconsistency, it can prevent the message from being processed before the time buffer expires. For application developers who cannot run an App Guardian themselves, they can commission the SGN nodes to undertake the task of an App Guardian. In that case, the security model is strengthened to a trust-any model for the SGN. Therefore, even under the worst-case scenario of the SGN consensus failure, inter-chain dApps built on top of Celer’s construct will still maintain safety property without any concern.\n\n#### Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is security provided by another third party entity?\n\nWhen operating in the model of Optimistic-rollup-style model, the security is dependent on the source chain and on the “trust-any” model as described in the security model section. It does not depend on any single third-party entity or a majority of decentralized parties. As long as one single app guardian is still working in a trustworthy way, the system is secure.\n\n#### Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?\n\nWhen operating in the model of Optimistic-rollup-style model, as long as there is still one app guardian that is trustworthy, it is not possible to have any fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain.\n\nThis is very different from other models where when a majority (often 2/3) of validators/MPC signers are compromised, a fraudulent message can be passed to the destination chain.\n\n#### What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?\n\nTheir CELR stake will be slashed.\n\n#### Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?\n\nCeler was audited by Certik, Slowmist and Peckshield. No vulnerabilities were identified in any of the audits. We also have a $2M standing bug bounty on Immunefi that is not claimed yet. Celer is the only cross-chain system that has processed more than $1b with no vulnerability exploited or identified.\n\n## License Exemption\n\nWe are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow the 0xPlasma Labs to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on BNB Chain, a layer 1 EVM compatible blockchain, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on BNB Chain by the 0xPlasma Labs through the “[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script. ](https://github.com/Uniswap/deploy-v3#deploy-uniswap-v3-script)” 0xPlasma Labs would be permitted to use subcontractors to do this work.",

      "title": "Fix the Cross Chain Messaging Bridge on Arbitrum",
      "content": "## Background:\n\nOn Ethereum, Uniswap Labs governance consists of a suite of smart contracts. However, in addition to its original deployment on Ethereum L1 mainnet, Uniswap contracts are also deployed on four additional domains - Polygon, Optimism, Celo, and Arbitrum.\n\nUniswap deployments on these domains do not have native access to the on-chain governance system, nor the UNI tokens which grant voting power in this system on Ethereum mainnet; in order for the existing Uniswap governance system to execute proposals governing these deployments, there must be some method of passing governance decisions from Ethereum mainnet to other domains.\n\nPresently, this method has been implemented differently for each of the four chains. The system governing Optimism and Polygon follow similar design principles, and should be functional for passing proposals.\n\n***The system governing the Arbitrum deployment was mis-configured due to a mis-communication between developers, and will require more involved intervention to repair.***\n\n## Problem:\n\nArbitrum was initially going to allow L1 addresses to pass calls directly to L2 with msg.sender preserved. After realizing security issues with this approach, Arbitrum team instead shifted their approach to use aliasing (this method transforms L1 addresses to be a different address when represented on an L2):\n\nUniswap Labs was not made aware of this change in approach before deploying on Arbitrum. The Uniswap Factory was deployed with the owner set to the same, unaliased address of the L1 Uniswap Timelock contract.\nTo verify, see: owner address https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc set at https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984#readContract\nThis address on Arbitrum is an EOA (not a contract) which nobody has the private key to control\nThe governance deployer key on Arbitrum has burned the nonce that could deploy a contract to this address, verifiable here: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x41653c7d61609d856f29355e404f310ec4142cfb\nTherefore, nobody can execute governance proposals on Arbitrum in the current state\n\n## Solution:\n\nTo fix the cross chain messaging bridge, Arbitrum proposes the following:\n\n1. Final governance vote kicks off (after Temperature and Consensus checks pass).\n2. Before the vote passes, Arbitrum will add a temporary exception to disable address-aliasing for messages from the L1 TimeLock contract, 0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc. Arbitrum will notify the Uniswap community via the Uniswap governance forum once this is done.\n3. Once the final on-chain governance vote passes, the Uniswap governance contract will send a cross-chain message from the L1 Timelock contract to call setOwner on the L2 Uniswap factory, setting the owner to the L1 Timelock’s address alias, 0x2BAD8182C09F50c8318d769245beA52C32Be46CD.\n\n* <em>This is the L1 Timelock address + the alias offset: 0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc + 0x111\n1000000000000000000000000000000001111 as described further at https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing</em>\n\n4. We will be able to see when this is completed on-chain. Arbitrum will re-enable aliasing for the L1 Timelock contract address. Once this is complete, cross-chain governance between Uniswap and Arbitrum will be fully functional.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUniswap is currently the leading decentralized exchange by TVL on Arbitrum, and if this proposal passes the temperature check and continues along the governance process, it will strengthen the current relationship between the two projects. \n\n\nLink to snapshot: https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x31c3409c09f5561d6aff1e0adeee6c83a5e73768a5d5c3e01b2a48a3894eda54",

The Boba Network are permitted to use subcontractors to do this work. This license is conditional on the Boba Network complying with the terms of the Business Source License 1.1, made available at https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/LICENSE.\n\nBoba Network and FranklinDAO (Prev.

Boba’s Hybrid Compute brings the power of Web2 on-chain, with smarter smart contracts that allow developers and creators to leverage off-chain compute and real-world data to offer an enriched experience unlike anything else on the market today.\n\nIn addition, Boba Network is the first and only [multichain ](https://www.theblock.co/post/149837/ethereum-layer-2-boba-network-integrates-with-fantom-and-moonbeam)Layer 2, deploying on leading Layer 1 chains such as Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB and Moonbeam. Deploying on Boba will expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Boba multichain ecosystem, helping Uniswap on its journey to become a leading product in the multichain world.\n\nThe timeline for deployment will be approximately 3-4 weeks following the Governance Proposal, with contract deployment being handled by the Boba Network team .\n\n## Proposal\nWe believe there are many benefits for the Uniswap Protocol, some of which include:\n\nEthereum equivalence. Developer tools, resources, projects, and protocols supported by Ethereum are already supported on Boba Network. A trustless bridge architecture to bridge assets from Ethereum to the Boba Network L2 has been in place since mainnet launch, with many bridging partners extending our bridge capabilities, such as Across.to, Synapse, Multichain and Layerswap.\n\nLow cost transactions with high security. As an Ethereum L2, Boba Network relies on Ethereum’s strong base layer security while providing very low cost transactions, with fees anywhere from 40-100x less than Ethereum.\n\n## Details for Incentivized Adoption of Uniswap v3\nBoba Network will provide $1M $BOBA tokens to foster the usage of Uniswap v3 on Boba Network. The tokens will be sent to a multisig wallet co-owned by the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) and Boba Network, who will work to deploy the funds as follows:\n\nThe incentives should be designed together with other projects which are operating on top of Uniswap v3 such as ICHI, Perpetual Protocol, Paraswap, or 1inch. The $BOBA can be used to incentivize liquidity but should not be limited to this use case. Anything increasing the usage of Uniswap v3 on Boba Network, including building new applications on top of Uniswap v3, should be supported. The goal is to deploy the $1M in the time period of one year. Funds not used after two years would go back to Boba. The spending is limited to $1M - the transferred amount of $BOBA as part of the proposal. Boba Network can decide to increase this amount based on the outcome of this initiative. In addition to this, Boba Network has already contributed more than $4M of liquidity on Uniswap v3 to bootstrap the initial success of Uniswap v3 on the Boba Network.\n\n## Security\nBoba Network is designed so that users can send arbitrary messages between smart contracts on L2 and L1. Users can relay messages themselves. The security of the messages passed is secured within the rollup protocol. Bridging and sequencing transactions is based on Optimism’s [Optimistic Rollup](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) codebase. From L1 to L2, users need to trigger the CanonicalTransactionChain contract on L1 to create a new block on Boba Network. Our Sequencer is then forced to include the transaction on L2. From L2 to L1: Making provable statements about the state of Boba requires a cryptographic commitment in the form of the root of the Boba’s state trie to a smart contract on L1 called the StateCommitmentChain. We regularly publish updates of the state trie. With Merkle tree proofs of the commitments, users can use these proofs to make verifiable statements about the data within the storage of any contract on Boba at a specific block height. This can then be used to enable contracts on Boba L2 to send messages to contracts on L1.\n\nThe bridge uses the security of the source chain (L1). In an Optimistic Rollup design, state commitments are published to L1 without any direct proof of the validity of these commitments. Instead, these commitments are considered pending for a period of time (called the “challenge window”). In the challenge window the commitment could be invalidated through a fraud proof. Fraud proof challenges are not enabled and there’s a single sequencer design currently in production. In the event of fraud, the malicious actor and the prover of fraud will (in the future) play out an interactive challenge game and the malicious actor will be slashed.\n\nThe Boba Network codebase and Optimism’s codebase have undergone multiple audits, with no outstanding vulnerabilities.\n\nMore details about Boba Network can be found on our [engineering roadmap](https://boba.network/engineering-roadmap-2022-2023/).\n\n## License Exemption\nWe are requesting an exemption that will allow Boba Network to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Boba Network, a Layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control.\n\n**For - Deploy Uniswap v3 to Boba**\n\n**Against - Make no change**\n\n## Conclusion\nBoba Network is primed for substantial growth in the coming year. We have implemented an aggressive developer acquisition program for projects building on not just our Ethereum L2, but also on top of Boba L2s for other chains like Avalanche, BNB, and Moonbeam. Our approach will bring in many new projects, and we feel Uniswap v3 is an essential component that will serve as a foundational layer for this growth.\n\nWe welcome any [questions and comments](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-to-boba-network/18018) and are happy to provide any clarifications as needed. We are excited to submit this proposal to the Uniswap community and look forward to your feedback! Thank you.\n\n",

      "title": "Community Governance Process Changes",
      "content": "Post: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-update-community-governance-process-changes/19718\n\n~~~\nOn November 21st, we posted a Request for Comment 5 on a series of proposed changes to the Uniswap community governance process. Thank you to everyone who has provided their comments! Based on community feedback and discussion, we are making some adjustments to our proposal. We will keep this proposal outstanding until next Wednesday December 14th, at which point we will post a Snapshot poll on the changes.\n\nThe changes to the RFC based on feedback are as follows:\n\nRevisions and updates to RFC\n\nIncrease the new “Request for Comment” process to be a minimum of 7 days rather than our originally proposed 3 days. We agree with Alana Levin 2, GFX Labs 1, and others that a minimum of 1 week ensures that the community will have adequate time to digest each proposal, ask questions, and provide feedback.\nIncrease the quorum for the new Temperature Check, the remaining off-chain Snapshot poll, to 10M UNI rather than the originally proposed 5M UNI. As pointed out by Deven Matthews 1 from Blockchain at Berkeley, 37 delegates meet the 2.5mm threshold – proposers would only need to garner support from 2 of these delegates to move to the last governance vote with a 5M quorum. Increasing quorum to 10M UNI increases the effectiveness of this phase as a signal of community support.\nWe highlight two suggestion from Toby from Other Internet to 1) standardize Snapshot language, particularly by formalizing the use of “No change” rather than other more biased language in Snapshot polls, and 2) reach out to popular governance platforms where the governance process is listed to update it, if the vote passes.\nWe are now planning to post a Snapshot Poll to vote on Wednesday, December 14th. The voting parameters will be 7 days and a 40M UNI quorum.\nIn addition to the above changes, we also pose the following question to the community. We originally proposed that changes to the off-chain components of the community governance process be votes on through an off-chain vote on Snapshot. GFX Labs 1 brought up the point that custodians do not allow voting off-chain - which means many voters may not be able to participate in those votes. Should these changes be voted on on- or off-chain? Particularly if you keep your UNI at a custodian, please opine!\n\nBelow, we provide an updated version of our original post.\n\nTL;DR\n\nOne of the goals of the Uniswap Foundation 1 is to reduce the amount of friction in the community governance process. In that spirit, today we are proposing changes to that process to improve its efficiency and efficacy.\n\nWe propose the following changes to the community governance process:\n\nRemove the first off-chain Snapshot poll, and replace it with a “Request for Comment” post. The first phase of the governance process should allow the community to digest a proposal, comment, and ask questions. We also believe two off-chain votes introduces unnecessary friction.\nIncrease quorum for the remaining off-chain Snapshot poll in the second phase to 10M UNI. The purpose of this off-chain vote is to gauge community sentiment prior to the governance vote. We believe the 10 million UNI quorum will act as a better signal than the lower quorum requirements in the current process.\nWe also propose to formalize a process for future changes to the off-chain components of the community governance process, like the changes discussed in this proposal. As mentioned above, we are now welcoming feedback from the community on whether these changes should be voted on through an on- or off-chain vote. If you keep your UNI at a custodian, opine below!\nSummary\n\nUniswap’s governance process is a core input to the community’s ability to steward its ongoing maintenance and growth in a fair and transparent manner. The design of the process should optimize for the dissemination of information throughout the community, for thoughtful iterations on proposals, and for signaling from the community prior to on-chain votes. While the governance process put in place today has, for the most part, been successful in achieving those goals, we believe improvements can be made to reduce overhead and to enhance off-chain signaling prior to the final governance vote.\n\nThese process enhancements were previously discussed in the forum here, but the simplifications were never implemented. We have decided to bring them back with minor changes.\n\nBelow we lay out the suggested changes, alongside our rationale. We are excited to hear and incorporate your feedback into this process change.\n\n\n1297×842 65.2 KB\nCurrent Process\n\nA detailed outline of the current process can be found here 1.\n\nTemperature Check: A temperature check is accompanied by a 3-day snapshot poll that requires a majority vote of 25K UNI yes-vote threshold.\nConsensus Check: A consensus check is accompanied by a 5-day snapshot poll that requires a majority vote of 50K UNI yes-vote threshold.\nGovernance Proposal: The on-chain proposal and vote is the final phase of the governance process. The proposer must have a minimum of 2.5M UNI delegated to their address.\nProposed changes to community governance process\n\nPhase 1: Request for Comment\n\nRename: Temperature Check → Request for Comment\nRemoval of Snapshot off-chain vote requirement\nA minimum of 7 days before moving forward\nWe believe the first phase of the governance process should allow the community to digest a proposal, comment, and ask questions – and not require going through the friction of one of two off-chain votes. The RFC Phase should last for at least 7 days to give the community ample time to formulate opinions on the proposal and provide feedback.\n\nPhase 2: Temperature Check\n\nIncrease the required quorum from 50K to 10M UNI\nFor this phase to better serve as a signaling tool, we suggest increasing the Snapshot poll yes-vote threshold to 10 million UNI. This threshold should be high enough to prevent lower quality proposals from moving to the final phase, while being low enough for higher quality proposals to garner enough support and move on to the final phase.\n\nAs suggested by Toby, we also strongly suggest the standard usage of a “No change” option in these Snapshot polls.\n\nPhase 3: On-chain Governance Vote\n\nNo changes\nProposed formalization of process changes to off-chain components of governance process\n\nAs mentioned above, we are looking for more community feedback on this topic\n\nIn her original post on the community governance process, Ashleigh states “On-chain voting is not necessary to make updates to off-chain processes.” An on-chain vote is unnecessary and requires users to pay gas, so should not be required for off-chain process changes. However, we do believe that community support and acceptance is important for process changes to have legitimacy. We thus originally proposed that changes to off-chain processes be voted on through off-chain votes on Snapshot with a 7-day voting period and 40M UNI quorum (original RFC here 5).\n\nHowever, GFX Labs 1 made the point that custodians do not allow UNI holders to vote off-chain, which may mean some UNI is precluded from voting on those changes. We would like more community feedback on whether these kinds of changes should be voted on on- or off-chain. Particularly if you keep your UNI at a custodian, please opine!\n\nConclusion and Next Steps\n\nIf no new serious changes to the proposal are required, we plan to post a Snapshot Poll on Wednesday, December 14th for the community to vote on these changes. If the Snapshot receives a quorum of 40M UNI votes, the community is indicating they are in favor of these changes.\n\nThe UF will update relevant documentation on the forum and work with other platforms where the Uniswap governance process is defined to make updates as well.",

      "content": "## Background:\n\nOn Ethereum, Uniswap Labs governance consists of a suite of smart contracts. However, in addition to its original deployment on Ethereum L1 mainnet, Uniswap contracts are also deployed on four additional domains - Polygon, Optimism, Celo, and Arbitrum.\n\nUniswap deployments on these domains do not have native access to the on-chain governance system, nor the UNI tokens which grant voting power in this system on Ethereum mainnet; in order for the existing Uniswap governance system to execute proposals governing these deployments, there must be some method of passing governance decisions from Ethereum mainnet to other domains.\n\nPresently, this method has been implemented differently for each of the four chains. The system governing Optimism and Polygon follow similar design principles, and should be functional for passing proposals.\n\n***The system governing the Arbitrum deployment was mis-configured due to a mis-communication between developers, and will require more involved intervention to repair.***\n\n## Problem:\n\nArbitrum was initially going to allow L1 addresses to pass calls directly to L2 with msg.sender preserved. After realizing security issues with this approach, Arbitrum team instead shifted their approach to use aliasing (this method transforms L1 addresses to be a different address when represented on an L2):\n\nUniswap Labs was not made aware of this change in approach before deploying on Arbitrum. The Uniswap Factory was deployed with the owner set to the same, unaliased address of the L1 Uniswap Timelock contract.\nTo verify, see: owner address https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc set at https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984#readContract\nThis address on Arbitrum is an EOA (not a contract) which nobody has the private key to control\nThe governance deployer key on Arbitrum has burned the nonce that could deploy a contract to this address, verifiable here: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x41653c7d61609d856f29355e404f310ec4142cfb\nTherefore, nobody can execute governance proposals on Arbitrum in the current state\n\n## Solution:\n\nTo fix the cross chain messaging bridge, Arbitrum proposes the following:\n\n1. Final governance vote kicks off (after Temperature and Consensus checks pass).\n2. Before the vote passes, Arbitrum will add a temporary exception to disable address-aliasing for messages from the L1 TimeLock contract, 0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc. Arbitrum will notify the Uniswap community via the Uniswap governance forum once this is done.\n3. Once the final on-chain governance vote passes, the Uniswap governance contract will send a cross-chain message from the L1 Timelock contract to call setOwner on the L2 Uniswap factory, setting the owner to the L1 Timelock’s address alias, 0x2BAD8182C09F50c8318d769245beA52C32Be46CD.\n\n* <em>This is the L1 Timelock address + the alias offset: 0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc + 0x111\n1000000000000000000000000000000001111 as described further at https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing</em>\n\n4. We will be able to see when this is completed on-chain. Arbitrum will re-enable aliasing for the L1 Timelock contract address. Once this is complete, cross-chain governance between Uniswap and Arbitrum will be fully functional.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUniswap is currently the leading decentralized exchange by TVL on Arbitrum, and if this proposal passes the temperature check and continues along the governance process, it will strengthen the current relationship between the two projects. \n\nSnapshot Polls:\n\n[Temperature Check: ](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xa4a21c808b28a61562c6b4ebf5b71c0cd37ee2d630bcbdf91ffaf5f683cc650f)\n[Consensus Check: ](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x31c3409c09f5561d6aff1e0adeee6c83a5e73768a5d5c3e01b2a48a3894eda54)\n",

      "title": "[Temperature Check] Deploy Uniswap V3 on Scroll testnet",
      "content": "\n\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal is created to further support the mission of a Multichain Uniswap. We propose to the Uniswap community to authorize the deployment of Uniswap V3 on Scroll testnet.\n\n* Scroll is an EVM equivalent zk-Rollup, a native zkEVM scaling solution for Ethereum. Similarly to Uniswap, Scroll started out working closely with the Ethereum Foundation - built with the community, for the community!\n* Deploying to Scroll bears many benefits, such as significant savings for users, user base growth, capturing the zkEVM market in advance, and fostering L2 native innovation.\n* We are aligned with Ethereum in our community ethos and vision. We are committed to Ethereum’s decentralized, censorship-resistant and efficient future.\n\nGenerally, we believe that Uniswap’s community and the ecosystem Scroll is striving for are closely aligned: both projects are building towards trustless and decentralized (financial) infrastructure that is accessible to anyone regardless of merit and location. In the following we detail Scroll’s architecture and mission. We look forward to receiving feedback and are happy to answer the community’s questions.\n\n## About Scroll\nScroll is a native zkEVM Layer 2 solution for Ethereum. We are committed to building an EVM equivalent ZK-rollup to help Ethereum become more scalable without sacrificing security.\n\nWe have been building in the open from day one, and collaborating on the zkEVM with the PSE (Privacy and Scaling Explorations) group at the Ethereum Foundation. Scroll is aiming at building the best possible solution to scale Ethereum Layer 1.\n\nScroll is compatible with Ethereum at the bytecode level, which is a major breakthrough in Layer 2 technology and brings huge benefits to the entire Ethereum community:\n\n* EVM equivalent: Scroll reuses Geth, enabling seamless migration of infrastructure. Any application can be migrated to Scroll without code changes and additional audits.\n* Developer friendly: Scroll will support all existing development tools, including debuggers. Developers can work with a familiar development environment. No bytecode re-audits will be required minimizing the risk surface tremendously.\n* Security: Scroll inherits all the features and security of EVM which is by far the most battle-tested smart contract infrastructure in the entire space.\n* Decentralization: Scroll is pioneering a decentralized prover network and is the only L2 that has committed to outsource proving before launching on mainnet. By decentralizing proof generation to the community, Scroll will also have efficient proof generation and a more robust ecosystem.\n* Advance Ethereum’s ultimate goal: zkEVM will not only be limited to Layer 2, it will also be used to scale Layer 1. Construction and testing of Scroll will further advance Ethereum’s ultimate goal of “zkSNARK Everything”. Contribute to building a decentralized and efficient future for Ethereum!\nZK-Rollups are widely considered to be the Holy Grail of Ethereum scaling - a best-in-class Layer 2 scaling solution that is very cheap and secure. Scroll’s vision is to build a fully EVM-compatible zk-Rollup that any existing Ethereum application can easily migrate to, thereby helping Ethereum scale without affecting the developer experience. We are live on testnet and will be launching on mainnet once our rapidly growing community of users, developers and auditors battle test the network.\n\n## Proposal\nBy launching on testnet, Uniswap has the opportunity to be part of this battle testing process and get a head start in the zk-Rollup ecosystem. In addition, many protocols (dapps) who are looking to launch on Scroll have asked for integration with an AMM. This is an opportunity for Uniswap to be a strong consideration for these applications.\n\nUniswap’s multi-chain mission can be facilitated and accelerated by deploying on Scroll in the most seamless way currently possible on Ethereum. Uniswap is a uniquely important DEX in the Ethereum ecosystem and pioneers how the ecosystem and user behavior evolves and can continue to do so by benefiting from the explosion of potential use cases that an L2 affords.\n\nUniswap on Scroll will:\n\n* Be able to offer high throughput, tps and low gas fees to cater to financial applications which are latency-sensitive such as Uniswap.\nConsolidate the project’s position as an early mover and capture a rapidly growing market in advance as the Ethereum ecosystem gradually shifts to a zkEVM focus.\n* Integrate closely with Scroll’s rapidly growing ecosystem. Dozens of projects have committed to begin deployment within weeks of our initial testnet launch. Projects include Lens, theGraph, Covalent, Empiric, Blockwallet, Ledger, Safe, Orbiter and many more. Based on the excitement around Scroll and zkRollups broadly, we expect over a hundred projects to deploy on our permissionless testnet.\n* Propel L2 DEX innovation. We are only at the brink of uncovering L2 native use cases that have not been feasible on Ethereum Layer 1 as of now. Scroll is incentivizing developers globally to break frontiers by funding research grants, hosting educational workshops and continuously making cutting edge research publicly available.\n* Help foster an ecosystem fueled by creativity. Applications (Games, DeFi and more) that have not been seen till now will be deploying on Scroll and having  Uniswap on Scroll is mutually beneficial as novel use-cases will use swaps and liquidity pools. Everything from in-game economies to zk-dapps with swap features will have the opportunity to integrate with Uniswap, leading to a new era for application-layer innovation.\n\n## Bridge Security\nZK-Rollup is currently the most secure Layer 2 scaling solution. On the premise of inheriting the security of Ethereum, it relies exclusively on cryptography, rather than unreliable crypto-economics.\n\nCurrently, Scroll has a trustless Layer 1 <> Layer 2 bridge, which supports arbitrary message delivery. The bridge is part of the rollup mechanism, verified by the smart contract and the zkEVM, which is much more secure than classical relayer-based bridges.\n\nSecurity is the first priority for us. Scroll implements the EVM which is well-specified and battle-tested. Additionally, we have an in-house security team working with 10+ external auditors who keep a close eye on the security of our codebase.\n\nLast but not least, Scroll is built on a completely open source basis. This includes the ZK circuits, the proving system, and the verifier smart contract. Its code security is closely monitored by community developers from projects such as Zcash, 0xPARC, Ethereum Foundation and Filecoin. We firmly believe that using such community standards is the most solid way to maintain the security of the codebase and the security of the entire system.\n\n## Timeline\nAfter passing the Temperature Check we will move forward with deploying Uniswap V3 on our Scroll testnet. The current testnet already supports the deployment of contracts. Since we are fully compatible with EVM, it is very easy to deploy on Scroll. We expect the full deployment will take 2-3 weeks.\n\nIt is important to us to be closely in touch with the Uniswap community from the start and want to ensure that everything runs smoothly before starting the full governance process for the mainnet deployment.",

The Uniswap Factory was deployed with the owner set to the same, unaliased address of the L1 Uniswap Timelock contract.\nTo verify, see: owner address https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc set at https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984#readContract\nThis address on Arbitrum is an EOA (not a contract) which nobody has the private key to control\nThe governance deployer key on Arbitrum has burned the nonce that could deploy a contract to this address, verifiable here: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x41653c7d61609d856f29355e404f310ec4142cfb\nTherefore, nobody can execute governance proposals on Arbitrum in the current state\n\n\n## Solution:\n\nTo fix the cross chain messaging bridge, Arbitrum proposes the following:\n\n1. Final governance vote kicks off (after Temperature and Consensus checks pass).\n\n2. Before the vote passes, Arbitrum will add a temporary exception to disable address-aliasing for messages from the L1 TimeLock contract, 0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc. Arbitrum will notify the Uniswap community via the Uniswap governance forum once this is done.\n\n3. Once the final on-chain governance vote passes, the Uniswap governance contract will send a cross-chain message from the L1 Timelock contract to call setOwner on the L2 Uniswap factory, setting the owner to the L1 Timelock’s address alias, 0x2BAD8182C09F50c8318d769245beA52C32Be46CD. \n\n- *This is the L1 Timelock address + the alias offset: 0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc + 0x111\n1000000000000000000000000000000001111 as described further at https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing*\n\n4. We will be able to see when this is completed on-chain. Arbitrum will re-enable aliasing for the L1 Timelock contract address. Once this is complete, cross-chain governance between Uniswap and Arbitrum will be fully functional.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUniswap is currently the leading decentralized exchange by TVL on Arbitrum, and if this proposal passes the temperature check and continues along the governance process, it will strengthen the current relationship between the two projects. \n",

      "title": "[Consensus Check] Deploy Uniswap V3 to Boba Network",
      "content": "Boba Network and Franklin DAO (Prev. Penn Blockchain) are submitting this proposal to Deploy Uniswap v3 on Boba Network.\n\nSummary\nIn cooperation with DMA Labs (a major contributor to ICHI’s Uniswap v3 management protocols (https://www.ichi.org/)) and support of furthering the vision of Multichain Uniswap 15, we propose that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap v3 to Boba Network.\nBoba Network is a blockchain Layer 2 scaling solution and Hybrid Compute (https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2022/07/boba-networks-hybrid-compute-why-it-will-unlock-blockchains-true-potential) platform offering lightning fast transactions and fees anywhere from 40-100x less than the respective Layer 1. Boba’s Hybrid Compute brings the power of Web2 on-chain, with smarter smart contracts that allow developers and creators to leverage off-chain compute and real-world data to offer an enriched experience unlike anything else on the market today.\nIn addition, Boba Network is the first and only multichain (https://www.theblock.co/post/149837/ethereum-layer-2-boba-network-integrates-with-fantom-and-moonbeam) Layer 2, deploying on leading Layer 1 chains such as Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB and Moonbeam. Deploying on Boba will expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Boba multichain ecosystem, helping Uniswap on its journey to become a leading product in the multichain world.\nThe timeline for deployment will be approximately 3-4 weeks following the Governance Proposal, with contract deployment being handled by the Boba Network team.\n\nProposal\nWe believe there are many benefits for the Uniswap Protocol, some of which include:\nEthereum equivalence. Developer tools, resources, projects, and protocols supported by Ethereum are already supported on Boba Network. A trustless bridge architecture to bridge assets from Ethereum to the Boba Network L2 has been in place since mainnet launch, with many bridging partners extending our bridge capabilities, such as Across.to, Synapse, Multichain and Layerswap.\n\nLow cost transactions with high security. As an Ethereum L2, Boba Network relies on Ethereum’s strong base layer security while providing very low cost transactions, with fees anywhere from 40-100x less than Ethereum.\n\nDetails for incentivized Adoption of Uniswap v3\nBoba Network will provide $1M $BOBA tokens to foster the usage of Uniswap v3 on Boba Network. The tokens will be sent to a multisig wallet co-owned by the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) and Boba Network, who will work to deploy the funds as follows:\nThe incentives should be designed together with other projects which are operating on top of Uniswap v3 such as ICHI, Perpetual Protocol, Paraswap, or 1inch. The $BOBA can be used to incentivize liquidity but should not be limited to this use case. Anything increasing the usage of Uniswap v3 on Boba Network, including building new applications on top of Uniswap v3, should be supported. The goal is to deploy the $1M in the time period of one year. Funds not used after two years would go back to Boba. The spending is limited to $1M - the transferred amount of $BOBA as part of the proposal. Boba Network can decide to increase this amount based on the outcome of this initiative. In addition to this, Boba Network has already contributed more than $4M of liquidity on Uniswap v3 to bootstrap the initial success of Uniswap v3 on the Boba Network.\n\nSecurity\nBoba Network is designed so that users can send arbitrary messages between smart contracts on L2 and L1. Users can relay messages themselves. The security of the messages passed is secured within the rollup protocol. Bridging and sequencing transactions is based on Optimism’s Optimistic Rollup codebase. From L1 to L2, users need to trigger the CanonicalTransactionChain contract on L1 to create a new block on Boba Network. Our Sequencer is then forced to include the transaction on L2. From L2 to L1: Making provable statements about the state of Boba requires a cryptographic commitment in the form of the root of the Boba's state trie to a smart contract on L1 called the StateCommitmentChain. We regularly publish updates of the state trie. With Merkle tree proofs of the commitments, users can use these proofs to make verifiable statements about the data within the storage of any contract on Boba at a specific block height. This can then be used to enable contracts on Boba L2 to send messages to contracts on L1.\nThe bridge uses the security of the source chain (L1). In an Optimistic Rollup design, state commitments are published to L1 without any direct proof of the validity of these commitments. Instead, these commitments are considered pending for a period of time (called the “challenge window”). In the challenge window the commitment could be invalidated through a fraud proof. Fraud proof challenges are not enabled and there’s a single sequencer design currently in production. In the event of fraud, the malicious actor and the prover of fraud will (in the future) play out an interactive challenge game and the malicious actor will be slashed.\nThe Boba Network codebase and Optimism’s codebase have undergone multiple audits, with no outstanding vulnerabilities.\nMore details about Boba Network can be found on our engineering roadmap.\n\nLicense Exemption\nWe are requesting an exemption that will allow Boba Network to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Boba Network, a Layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control.\n\nTimeline\nAfter passing the Temperature Check with 25k UNI voting yes to deploy to Boba Network, we are excited to move forward to the Consensus Check phase to collect further feedback in advance of an on-chain vote.\nFollowing the Consensus Check phase, we will submit this proposal shortly after to an on-chain vote. Provided that the proposal passes both steps, and all governance systems have been built and audited, we will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap v3 deployment on Boba Network.\n\nYes - Deploy Uniswap v3 to Boba\nNo - Make no Change\n\nConclusion\nBoba Network is primed for substantial growth in the coming year. We have implemented an aggressive developer acquisition program for projects building on not just our Ethereum L2, but also on top of Boba L2s for other chains like Avalanche, BNB, and Moonbeam. Our approach will bring in many new projects, and we feel Uniswap v3 is an essential component that will serve as a foundational layer for this growth.\nWe welcome any questions and comments and are happy to provide any clarifications as needed. We are excited to submit this proposal to the Uniswap community and look forward to your feedback! Thank you.",

      "content": "Matter Labs: @zkSync\n\n**Proposal History**\n\nThe [consensus check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xe6ad2033b04559b3db6be7fa9993f05ee68f43f1061c632382c88e367e76bfb1) passed with 24M (~100%) YES votes. The [temperature check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xab1dbb6e3486073b81cc64b81d15d24a7bf82efcfc94e533de0779250df06ba9) passed with 15M (~100%) YES votes.\n\n**Summary**\n\nTo support Uniswap's multichain mission and expand cross-chain experiences, we propose the deployment of Uniswap V3 to zkSync 2.0 on behalf of the community.\n\n-   zkSync ecosystem has over [100 projects](https://ecosystem.zksync.io/) committed to launching on mainnet, including top DeFi protocols, infrastructure, on/off ramps, etc.\n\n-   Deploying on zkSync will onboard new users & increase user activity on Uniswap by decreasing costs compared to Ethereum without security degradation\n\n-   zkSync shares Ethereum's ethos as a free open-source project with a commitment to personal sovereignty, decentralization and community ownership\n\nWe welcome feedback from the community on the proposal, including suggestions on how it can be improved.\n\n**About zkSync**\n\nzkSync 2.0 is a [ZK rollup](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/) that supports generalized EVM compatibility for the Ethereum blockchain. The primary benefit of zkSync 2.0 is that developers who have created EVM dApps can port to zkSync 2.0 effortlessly and realize significantly lower gas fees and more transactions per second without compromising on security.\n\nzkSync 2.0 is a significant leap forward in Layer 2 technologies with long awaited improvements and benefits for Ethereum developers:\n\n-   EVM Compatible - supporting generalized EVM smart contracts on a ZK rollup making it easy to deploy existing dApps \n\n-   ToolChain Compatible - able to port smart contracts with existing tools\n\n-   Ethos Compatible - aligned with the ethos of decentralization and open-source\n\n-   Certainty - using zero knowledge proofs offering certainty of security not probability \n\n-   Future Proof - ecosystem partners that adopt zkSync 2.0 now will enjoy all future improvements without the need to change their code\n\nThere is broad consensus that ZK rollups are the endgame for scaling Ethereum. zkSync's EVM compatibility, ease of use, and composability will accelerate developer and retail adoption. Top researchers including [Vitalik Buterin](https://youtu.be/XW0QZmtbjvs) recognize ZK rollups as the long term scaling solution.\n\n**Security & Bridges**\n\nZK rollups are the most secure scalability solution available today as they rely purely on math to fully inherit the security of Ethereum. There is a general L1<>L2 communication bridge which will support arbitrary message passing and secured by validity proof and Ethereum consensus.\n\nBridge validators can't pass an incorrect message or change the content, the worst case would be to censor everyone. Importantly, we'll be building out additional safety functionality and monitoring off & on-chain activity.\n\n[Security is top of mind](https://docs.zksync.io/dev/security/approach/#_1-security-by-correctness) for zkSync. We are currently working with tier-1 auditors for zkSync 2.0 and specifically in the review process for the bridge code. Audits will be conducted before each major upgrade. Besides audits, we offer a substantial [bug bounty program](https://docs.zksync.io/dev/security/bug-bounty/).\n\n**Proposal**\n\nThere's significant value in Uniswap being available on an EVM compatible ZK rollup. Deploying early on zkSync helps solidify Uniswap's place as the number one DEX and a thought leader.\n\nImportantly, it will help grow a large list of projects that can be built on Uniswap V3. Established projects like Argent, Curve, and Yearn have committed to launch along with [over 100 more projects](https://ecosystem.zksync.io/) and big infrastructure players like Chainlink, The Graph, Gnosis are supporting the ecosystem. Growing the public smart contract libraries interfacing and using Uniswap v3 codebase will solidify Uniswap's influence in the Ethereum ecosystem which is moving on to ZK rollups.\n\nWhile the zkSync ecosystem is already experiencing very fast growth, the team is planning  programs to attract and fund innovative projects and research partners to accelerate the network's adoption and in turn, Uniswap's usage.\n\n**License Exemption**\n\nWe are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow Matter Labs to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on zkSync provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on zkSync by Matter Labs through the \"[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script](https://github.com/Uniswap/deploy-v3#deploy-uniswap-v3-script)\" albeit we may need to modify the compilation step with approval from the Uniswap Labs team.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nFollowing the Governance Proposal we will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap V3 deployment on zkSync.zkSync has been on testnet since February 2022 and plans to launch mainnet [early October](https://blog.matter-labs.io/100-days-to-mainnet-6f230893bd73). A timely assessment of the deployment of Uniswap v3 code to zkSync is important: while deploying on zkSync is fast and easy because it's fully EVM compatible, we estimate the full effort will take 4-6 weeks given Uniswap's relevance. This allows for proper testing, communication to the community and engagement with the broader zkSync ecosystem.",

      "title": "Should we deploy Uniswap v3 on Aurora?",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal is created on behalf of Blockchain at Michigan, and in partnership with [Proximity Labs](https://www.proximity.dev/). We propose to deploy Uniswap v3 on Aurora through an additional grant license and ask the Uniswap community to consider and discuss this proposal.\n\nUniswap will expand access to decentralized and permissionless trading of tokens on Aurora, and aligns with the community’s multichain vision to bring trustless liquidity to all chains and position itself as a de facto DeFi hub in the space.\n\nOur proposal will include a $5m amount allocated for financial incentives to Uniswap users on Aurora and a commitment to actively engage with the Uniswap community to further support its growth through grant programs and funding for protocol-related development.\n\nProximity Labs will coordinate with the community and governance participants to distribute these funds and will support future developments and allocations to projects leveraging Uniswap and DeFi’s ecosystem participants on Aurora.\n\n## About Aurora\n\n[Aurora ](http://aurora.dev)is an EVM-compatible execution environment running on top of [NEAR](http://near.org), a proof-of-stake layer 1 chain, and takes advantage of its unique features, including sharding and developer gas fee remuneration. Our long-term vision is to provide a user-friendly platform for developers and users to build fast and highly-scalable decentralized applications offering seamless integrations with NEAR’s native chain as well as different L1s and L2 networks.\n\nTransaction costs on Aurora are among the lowest while ensuring a high throughput, scalability, and security. Aurora's SputnikVM is a highly optimized EVM that can execute transactions at high speeds while maintaining full compatibility with Ethereum's VM. This makes Aurora the perfect platform for applications that require high transaction throughput without incurring high costs.\n\nThere are a total of 100 active NEAR nodes acting as Aurora Relayers. The transaction finality happens on NEAR when a new block is minted, right after it’s wrapped in a NEAR transaction and broadcasted to the nodes through one of the relayers. Since the launch of Aurora in May 2021, the average block time has hovered around 1 second, the chain boosts almost instant transaction finality at ~2 secs and a near-zero transaction cost of ~$0.02 on average per tx.\n\n## Proposal\n\nThe Aurora ecosystem has been growing tremendously with very talented builders and founders joining our sides and leveraging Aurora’s exceptional low fees and fast-finality transactions. New integrations and exciting announcements from major protocols and DeFi players such as Curve, Lido,.. have made Aurora one of the fastest growing chains out in the space with an ever-growing number of new people joining and interacting with our dApps. Our network consists of a wide array of platforms, from decentralized exchanges, lending protocols and cross-chain bridges. Our flagship protocols include Bastion Protocol, a lending protocol with more than $340M worth of assets deposited; Trisolaris, a decentralized exchange which secures more than $230M in liquidity; and the Rainbow Bridge, [with over $900M in volume](https://app.uniwhales.io/near/bridge-tracker) bridged across NEAR, Aurora, and Ethereum.\n\n[Aurora’s TVL](https://defillama.com/chain/Aurora) sits at $500M, with highs at around $2.64B, demonstrating an overall increasing engagement with our ecosystem and a tremendously growing base of native supporters. There are more than 2.5 mil unique addresses with around 200k new unique addresses per day and we count around 200k transactions daily.\n\n### Uniswap on Aurora\n\nAurora has a long history of supporting cross-chain protocol deployment and has been eagerly assisting developers and founders all across various chains and spaces to expand and reach new communities and tap into new ecosystems...\n\nMajor DeFi protocols such as The Graph, Flux Protocol, and Gnosis have already deployed on Aurora, and other blue chips such as Chainlink and Curve have committed to launching soon. We’re aware Uniswap has deployed on major chains such as Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Celo, with successful proposals to deploy on Moonbeam and Gnosis Chain. Deploying Uniswap would be the next big step to take to add to the already-growing DeFi hub on Aurora and will undoubtedly position itself as a premier AMM, and a major liquidity hub for Near, offering a seamless trading experience and allowing defi users to take advantage of its concentrated liquidity mechanism.\n\nThis opportunity will allow Uniswap to gain more exposure within the NEAR community as it positions itself as a primary decentralized exchange hub as we’re headed towards a multi-chain economy, and will undoubtedly bring a massive stream of revenue for Liquidity Providers.\n\n### Incentives\n\nOur proposal comes with financial and non-financial incentives to promote long-term protocol development, developer activity and innovation\n\nWe plan on offering $5m from our ecosystem growth fund to the Uniswap community in the form of Liquidity Mining incentives and Developer Grants to support DeFi applications leveraging Uniswap on Aurora and building on top of it:\n\n* Commit up to $2.5M for a liquidity mining campaign targeting the top liquid pairs to support the overall adoption of Uniswap V3\n* Allocate a $2.5M fund to support long-term protocol development by funding developers, designers, and community members building on top of Uniswap and driving Aurora’s growth.\n* Promote and increase Uniswap’s visibility within our ecosystem and to new projects, as well as showcase in Aurora’s marketing campaigns and Near/Aurora hacker houses and hackathons.\n\n### Rainbow Bridge\n\nRainbow Bridge is the official decentralized bridge for transferring tokens between Ethereum, NEAR and the Aurora networks. At a high level, Rainbow Bridge works through:\n\n1. LiteNodes (a lightweight node implemented as a smart contract that stores block headers. One deployed on the Ethereum network, which stores NEAR block headers, and one deployed on NEAR which stores Ethereum block headers.)\n2. Relayers (scripts running on virtual servers, that periodically read blocks from one blockchain, and communicate them to the LiteNode running on the other.)\n3. Connectors (smart contracts responsible for all of the logic associated with the cross-chain management of a given asset type).\n\nProximity Labs and Aurora will build a connector following the community vote to make the bridge compatible with general messaging functionality. This connector will be deployed on both Ethereum and Near and will be responsible for transferring governance votes/messages between both chains. One of the advantages of Rainbow Bridge is its malleability. Any asset or data can be transferred across the Rainbow Bridge if relevant Connectors exist.\n\n#### Bridge Security\n\n* Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing?\n  * Yes, once the relevant connector will be deployed\n* Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi-sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?\n  * The bridge is secured by multi-sig. Security is provided by implementing light-clients of both networks on the counterpart network: Ethereum light client on NEAR and NEAR light client on Ethereum.\n* Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is the security provided by another third-party entity?\n  * Rainbow bridge leverages both chains’ security (Ethereum and Near) through the use of Provers on both chains: EthOnNearProver NEAR contract in Rust and NearOnEthProver Ethereum contract in Solidity to verify Ethereum events and Near contract execution results. On Near, trust relies that at no time, 2/3 of the validators stake are honest. Not only the bridge, but also all other applications on NEAR operate under this assumption.\n* Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?\n  * The rainbow bridge is based on trustless assumptions with no selected middleman to transfer messages or assets between chains. Because of this, anyone can interact with its smart contracts. When players with bad intentions submit bad information, it would be challenged by independent Watchdogs watching the Near blockchain.

Uniswap V3 will be deployed on Aurora by Proximity Labs or Aurora through the “[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script 15](https://github.com/Uniswap/deploy-v3#deploy-uniswap-v3-script).” Proximity Labs or Aurora would be permitted to use subcontractors to do this work.\n\n### Timeline\n\nFollowing the vote on the proposal by the Uniswap community, our team will be ready to start working on the deployment of Uniswap V3 on Aurora.\n\nWe anticipate a few extra steps that will prelude the full deployment such as:\n\n* Developing the general message connector on top of Rainbow Bridge\n* Deploying Uniswap V3 smart contracts on Aurora\n\nWe expected the full deployment to take anywhere around 4-5 weeks.",

      "title": "[Temperature Check] Deploy Uniswap V3 to zkSync",
      "content": "Penn Blockchain (FranklinDAO) is creating this proposal in partnership with Matter Labs to Deploy Uniswap V3 on zkSync.\n\nDeploy Uniswap V3 to zkSync\n\nSummary\n\nTo support Uniswap’s multichain mission and expand cross-chain experiences, we propose the deployment of Uniswap V3 to zkSync 2.0 on behalf of the community.\n\nzkSync ecosystem has over 100 projects committed to launching on mainnet, including top DeFi protocols, infrastructure, on/off ramps, etc.\nDeploying on zkSync will onboard new users & increase user activity on Uniswap by decreasing costs compared to Ethereum without security degradation\nzkSync shares Ethereum’s ethos as a free open-source project with a commitment to personal sovereignty, decentralization and community ownership\n\nWe welcome feedback from the community on the proposal, including suggestions on how it can be improved. \n\nAbout zkSync\n\nzkSync 2.0 is a ZK rollup (https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups) that supports generalized EVM compatibility for the Ethereum blockchain. The primary benefit of zkSync 2.0 is that developers who have created EVM dApps can port to zkSync 2.0 effortlessly and realize significantly lower gas fees and more transactions per second without compromising on security.\n\nzkSync 2.0 is a significant leap forward in Layer 2 technologies with long awaited improvements and benefits for Ethereum developers:\n\nEVM Compatible - supporting generalized EVM smart contracts on a ZK rollup making it easy to deploy existing dApps \nToolChain Compatible - able to port smart contracts with existing tools\nEthos Compatible - aligned with the ethos of decentralization and open-source\nCertainty - using zero knowledge proofs offering certainty of security not probability \nFuture Proof - ecosystem partners that adopt zkSync 2.0 now will enjoy all future improvements without the need to change their code  \n\nThere is broad consensus that ZK rollups are the endgame for scaling Ethereum. zkSync’s EVM compatibility, ease of use, and composability will accelerate developer and retail adoption. Top researchers including Vitalik Buterin recognize ZK rollups as the long term scaling solution.\n\nSecurity & Bridges\n\nZK rollups are the most secure scalability solution available today as they rely purely on math to fully inherit the security of Ethereum.\n\nWhile developers are free to build their own bridge for any token, zkSync 2.0 has two default trustless bridges (one for ETH and one for ERC20 tokens).\n\nThe bridges support arbitrary message passing and are secured by validity proof and Ethereum consensus. Fraudulent messages are not possible. The only actions a malicious actor could take is to censor messages, confirm inclusion in a block and then discard the state change. \n\nSecurity is top of mind for zkSync (https://docs.zksync.io/dev/security/approach/#_1-security-by-correctness). We are currently working with tier-1 auditors for zkSync 2.0 and specifically in the review process for the bridge code. Audits will be conducted before each major upgrade. Besides audits, we offer a substantial bug bounty program (https://docs.zksync.io/dev/security/bug-bounty).\n\nProposal\n\nThere’s significant value in Uniswap being available on an EVM compatible ZK rollup. Deploying early on zkSync helps solidify Uniswap’s place as the number one DEX and a thought leader. \n\nImportantly, it will help grow a large list of projects that can be built on Uniswap V3. Established projects like Argent, Curve, and Yearn have committed to launch along with over 100 more projects and big infrastructure players like Chainlink, The Graph, Gnosis are supporting the ecosystem (https://ecosystem.zksync.io/). Growing the public smart contract libraries interfacing and using Uniswap v3 codebase will solidify Uniswap’s influence in the Ethereum ecosystem which is moving on to ZK rollups.\n\nWhile the zkSync ecosystem is already experiencing very fast growth, the team is planning  programs to attract and fund innovative projects and research partners to accelerate the network’s adoption and in turn, Uniswap’s usage. \n\nLicense Exemption\n\nUniswap V3 will be deployed on zkSync by Matter Labs contingent upon approval by the Uniswap community for a license exemption. Governance at deployment will be subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control facilitated by the messaging bridge (https://v2-docs.zksync.io/dev/guide/cross-chain-tutorial.html#reading-the-counter-value).\n\nTimeline\n\nFollowing the Temperature Check, Consensus Check, and Governance Proposal we will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap V3 deployment on zkSync. \n\nzkSync has been on testnet since February 2022 and plans to launch mainnet early October (https://blog.matter-labs.io/100-days-to-mainnet-6f230893bd73). A timely assessment of the deployment of Uniswap v3 code to zkSync is important: while deploying on zkSync is fast and easy because it’s fully EVM compatible, we estimate the full effort will take 4-6 weeks given Uniswap’s relevance. This allows for proper testing, communication to the community and engagement with the broader zkSync ecosystem. ",

Our conversations with you have energized us even more about the opportunity for the UF to positively impact the Uniswap ecosystem.\n\nWe have added additional information about the UGP and other topics discussed in the Temp Check forum to the addendum of the proposal. For the final governance proposal, we have also added the multisig addresses to the Addendum. \n\nLink to Temperature Check governance forum post: [Temperature Check: Create the Uniswap Foundation ](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17358)\nLink to Temperature Check snapshot poll: [Snapshot ](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xee4851601143b1e9655be7168ca2d0f119fba31afadf2a7f808ea12b7bb4e9df)\nLink to Consensus Check governance forum post: [Consensus Check: Create the Uniswap Foundation ](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17457)\nLink to Consensus Check snapshot poll: [Snapshot ](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xd70b3e84db501c2633bc8189fcfc335726fce90584a3c37f6155580369f11023)\n\n# Uniswap Foundation: Preamble\n\n**Uniswap has already changed the world.**\n\nIn only 3 years, the world’s first automated market maker has pioneered DeFi primitives, supported more than [$1T ](https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1529102980296867842)in cumulative volume, and served [millions of users ](https://dune.com/rchen8/defi-users-over-time)worldwide. Its daily volume today is [on par with Coinbase ](https://twitter.com/Clara_Medalie/status/1549048362489741313).\n\nOwnership of the protocol was [transferred to the community ](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni)in 2020 and since then the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) has demonstrated the potential for community-funded initiatives to make a positive impact. Over 1.5 years, UGP [has funded 120+ grantees ](https://mirror.xyz/kennethng.eth/0WHWvyE4Fzz50aORNg3ixZMlvFjZ7frkqxnY4UIfZxo) improving governance, and developing new interfaces and developer tooling.\n\nHowever, there is still work to do to help Uniswap reach its full potential. The governance process has too much friction, the ecosystem is too difficult to navigate, and UGP in its current form is not able to fund the most ambitious and impactful projects.\n\n**We want to change that.**\n\nToday, we are excited to propose the creation of the **Uniswap Foundation**, which has the mission to support the decentralized growth and sustainability of the Uniswap Protocol and its supporting ecosystem and community.\n\nIn other words, the goal of the Uniswap Foundation is to support **you**.\n\nUniswap’s community is expansive, encompassing the universe of individuals and organizations which build on and benefit from decentralized protocols. Your contributions have already made Uniswap a success, but we want to help you accomplish much more.\n\nThe Uniswap Foundation (UF) will provide grants to builders, researchers, organizers, academics, analysts, and more to grow the Protocol and plan for its future.\n\nIt will make it easier to govern the protocol and community treasury, and to navigate the broader ecosystem.\n\nIt will help you make an impact – to reduce friction, and amplify your efforts.\n\n**We believe that Uniswap will be the value exchange layer of the Internet.**\n\nIt brought the automated market maker to the masses.\n\nIt has led the way in the evolution and growth of DeFi and web3.\n\nIt is censorship resistant, permissionless, decentralized, and secure – constituting a set of properties which we believe should define our world’s financial infrastructure.\n\nBut there is still a long way to go for Uniswap to reach its full potential.\n\nWe’re excited to work with all of you to make that happen.\n\nIf you’re excited too, please read our proposal, comment, reach out to chat (our DMs - [@devinawalsh ](https://twitter.com/devinawalsh) and [@nkennethk ](https://twitter.com/nkennethk) are open!), and spread the word.\n\n# Uniswap Foundation Proposal\n\nThis proposal is being put forth by the Uniswap Foundation, a Delaware corporation formed by Uniswap community members [Devin Walsh ](https://twitter.com/devinawalsh) and [Ken Ng ](https://twitter.com/nkennethk) to facilitate the steps outlined in this proposal.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Today, we are thrilled to propose the creation of the **Uniswap Foundation (UF)**.\n* **Scope:** The UF, the first Foundation of a major protocol to go through the community governance process, will support the Protocol’s decentralized growth, reinvigorate governance, and serve as a Protocol advocate.\n* **Team:** Devin Walsh will serve as the Executive Director, Ken Ng will serve as Head of Operations, and they will build out a team of 12.\n* **Budget:** To fund these efforts, we are requesting:\n  * A **$14M** Operating budget to cover a full team for 3 years\n  * A **$60M** expanded Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) budget to cover 3+ years\n  * We are requesting **$74M** total, which will be broken into two disbursements, with a first disbursement of **$20M**.\n* **Governance Participation:** We are also requesting **2.5M UNI** to participate in governance, primarily through delegation. Through usage of a new smart contract primitive [The Franchiser ](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser), this UNI will be revocable by the DAO at any time, and cannot be used for any purpose outside of governance.\n\n# Uniswap Foundation\n\n## Mission\n\nIn pursuit of a more open and fair financial system, the Uniswap Foundation supports the decentralized growth and sustainability of the Uniswap Protocol and its supporting ecosystem.\n\n## Key Activities and OKRs\n\nWe have listed our starting OKRs below. It’s possible these OKRs will have to change in the future. If they do change in a meaningful way, we will communicate that to the community.\n\n**Growth:** Promoting Decentralization & Growth of the Protocol and Ecosystem\n\n![OKR 1](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/6/619bc0745412b267da6d9b54787fc42bbd325493.png)\n\n**Governance:** Reinvigorating the Uniswap Community Governance Process\n\n![OKR 2](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/c/c8b88b9477f9c2c81ab5457cca4e9552781b3bf6.png)\n\n**Advocacy:** Advocating for the Protocol and amplifying its positive social impact\n\n![OKR 3](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/1/140c46d1c2e79f9e6dab44fbfb65826e578e3a59.png)\n\n*Optimism Phase 0 token distribution link [here ](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/gov-fund/)*\n\n## Year 1 Roadmap\n\nOur roadmap for the first year of operations includes but is not limited to the following activities:\n\n![Year 1](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/0/0b9a3fb2b8ad0bb2eb400d0cdb1d391ee5ef9f06.png)\n\n*Optimism Collective community Constitution link [here ](https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55)*\n\n## Team\n\n**[Devin Walsh ](https://twitter.com/devinawalsh), Executive Director (ED)**\n\nAs ED, Devin will be responsible for setting UF’s strategic vision alongside the Board and driving execution to achieve that vision.\n\nDevin has been in crypto since 2016. She has conducted independent research for MIT’s [Digital Currency Initiative ](https://dci.mit.edu/), worked on decentralized identity at [uPort](https://www.uport.me/) (ConsenSys), and led protocol and venture investments at [CoinFund](https://www.coinfund.io/). She has consulted with [Edge & Node](https://edgeandnode.com/) and [cLabs ](https://clabs.co/), and led [MIRA ](https://miraimaging.com/), a seed stage startup at the intersection of fine art and NFTs. She recently resigned as Chief of Staff at Uniswap Labs in order to propose the creation of the UF.\n\n**[Ken Ng ](https://twitter.com/nkennethk), Head of Operations**\n\nAs Head of Operations, Ken will build and scale processes to maximize the UF’s impact.\n\nKen has served the Uniswap ecosystem as Lead of the [Uniswap Grants Program ](https://www.unigrants.org/)for the past 1.5 years. He has helped run the Ethereum Foundation [Ecosystem Support Program ](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/), which gave Hayden his [initial grant ](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/08/17/ethereum-foundation-grants-update-wave-3/)to build Uniswap. He served as COO of [Slingshot Finance ](https://slingshot.finance/)and cofounder of his nonprofit [eduDAO ](https://www.edudao.org/), which helps raise funds for students and teachers in the Bronx.\n\nThe needs, and thus the makeup, of our team may change over time. However, today we aim to hire for following roles, with a focus on filling the Grants and Governance roles first:\n\n![Team|643x388](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/1/10a71f01254ea0ca59761b54934103bd60eb0400.png)\n\nApplications are open today! Check out job descriptions [here ](https://jobs.lever.co/uniswapfoundation).\n\nAs noted by [Other Internet ](https://otherinter.net/research/uniswap-governance-findings/), there is also a need for new structures to “facilitate coordination across the complex web of stakeholders” within the Uniswap ecosystem. To provide this much needed coordination, the UF will be committed to working with a variety of independent parties (freelancers, development teams, research fellows, analysts, and more) to achieve many of its objectives.\n\n## Advisors\n\nThe Foundation’s initial advisory team will be made up of the following individuals:\n\n1. [Jesse Walden ](https://twitter.com/jessewldn), Founder and GP, [Variant](https://variant.fund/)\n2. [Julia Rosenberg ](https://twitter.com/JulzRoze), Co-Founder, [Orca Protocol ](https://www.orcaprotocol.org/)\n3. [Alexis Gauba ](https://twitter.com/AlexisGauba), Co-Founder, [Opyn ](https://www.opyn.co/); Co-Founder, [she256](https://she256.org/)\n4. [Hart Lambur ](https://twitter.com/hal2001), Co-Founder of [UMA ](https://umaproject.org/)\n\nIn addition to advising UF on strategy and roadmap, this group will, alongside the Executive Director (ED) and Head of Operations,\n\n1. Provide input on UF’s initial hiring decisions. This may include interviewing potential candidates and sharing feedback with the Committee as it determines its first hires, including its third Board member and at least next three team members.\n2. Become temporary signers of the UF multi-sig, which will hold UF funds if and when the proposal is passed, for the sole purpose of executing approved proposals as instructed. This responsibility will be transitioned to UF team members once they are hired.\n\n## Board\n\nDevin Walsh and Ken Ng will serve as the first two Board members of the UF. Alongside the UF’s Advisors, they will interview and target to hire a third Board member in the first 3 months of operations.\n\n## Budget\n\nWe are requesting $74M in UNI. This funding would be broken down into the following buckets:\n\n* **$60M for Uniswap Grants Program**\n\nGrants spending will be broken down into the below categories. We will revisit and readjust these categories as needed to ensure we continue to deploy resources where they are most impactful.\n\nWe are proud of the work done by UGP thus far (memorialized in this [retrospective ](https://mirror.xyz/kennethng.eth/0WHWvyE4Fzz50aORNg3ixZMlvFjZ7frkqxnY4UIfZxo)), and are incredibly excited to expand the scope of its work.\n\n![Grants|491x419](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/7/76a8eaaca3579fafc751e294cefef2897875997d.png)\n\nWe are already in the process of assessing several high impact grant proposals which UGP would be excited to fund, if and when this proposal is passed. Two examples are:\n\n1. A version of Uniswap v3 written in Cairo, to be deployed on Starknet\n2. A prototype of an MEV estimation tool leveraging machine learning techniques built by respected academics in the space\n\nWe are also excited to continue funding ongoing work by existing grantees funded by UGP v0.1, including governance experiments and analyses from Other Internet, customer support from Serv.eth, and ETHGlobal hackathons.\n\nTo ensure community alignment with larger grants disbursements, the UF will put forth an off-chain Snapshot to the community for proposed grants larger than $2M.\n\nWe believe that this Grants budget will last approximately 3 years but this is subject to change depending upon the number and quality of applicants. We plan to approach the Treasury for additional Grants funds when there are ~6 months of funds remaining.\n\n* **$14M operating budget** to build out a full team of 12 over the next two years.\n\nIn order to provide stability to our employees and to sustain the Foundation, we may make a request to the community for additional funding for further out than 3 years when we return to the Treasury at 6-12 months of operations (read more below).\n\nBudget estimate looking forward three years is below.\n\n![Budget|641x292](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/1/18d2d1d5195b8baff08044fcfe21186a85926cc8.png)\n\n**Inclusive of UNI vesting. In order to incentivize a highly qualified team, the UF will offer competitive compensation packages including both fiat and long-term vesting UNI. To provide full transparency, we will disclose UF financials later this year.*\n\n***The UF will allocate an additional $2M in funds to cover legal fees in the case of unexpected future litigation.*\n\n## Fund Disbursements\n\nAn approval of this proposal is an approval for the full **$74M** budget requested.\n\nWe are requesting the funds in two disbursements:\n\n1. **$20M** now to cover operating expenses for the next 2 years and grants for 1 year. Assuming a UNI price of $8.14*, this initial request totals to **2,457,002 UNI.**\n2. **$54M**, to be disbursed by the Uniswap Treasury in 6-12 months once the UF has completed the establishment of its legal entity. The UF will publish a post on the forum notifying the community a week prior to putting forth a formal governance proposal for the remaining funds. In other words, because this proposal approves the full amount of funding, we will not go through an additional the Temperature Check and Consensus Check steps to receive this second disbursement.\n\n**To calculate our final UNI request we will use the 30 day TWAP on the day we put forth our Governance Proposal. $8.14 is approximately the 30 day TWAP as of 8/15/2022.*\n\n## Governance Participation\n\nThe UF is also requesting **2.5M UNI** to participate in governance.\n\nThese tokens will be delegated to the UF by the Uniswap DAO through a new smart contract design, [The Franchiser ](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser), which ensures the tokens are only used for delegation, and allows the DAO to claw back the tokens at any time. The UF plans to use these tokens primarily for delegation to community members without the requisite 2.5M UNI to submit a governance proposal, however the UF may also self-delegate the UNI to vote, and to put up its own proposals.\n\nThe Franchiser was developed by [Noah Zinsmeister ](https://twitter.com/NoahZinsmeister)and was audited by [Trail of Bits ](https://www.trailofbits.com/).\n\n# Next Steps\n\nWe are excited to discuss this proposal with the broader community as it passes through the Request for Comment phase. Should sentiment be positive, a Temperature Check Snapshot poll will be set up on Mon., August 8. If the Temperature Check poll passes, additional feedback will be incorporated before moving forward to the Consensus Check.\n\nAdditionally, to discuss the proposal and answer your questions, we plan to attend the Uniswap Community call at 4 PM EST on Wed., August 10, and to host a Twitter Spaces on @uniswapgrants at 11 AM EST on Tues., August 16.\n\n## Addendum\n\n### What is UF’s relationship with other ecosystem entities?\n\nThe goal of the UF is to be one of ***many*** organizations supporting the Protocol. UF’s overarching focus will be on seeding and growing an ecosystem of entities supporting the Protocol.\n\n### What is UF’s relationship with Uniswap Labs?\n\nThe UF is an independent entity whose mandate will be to grow Uniswap’s usage, reinvigorate the governance process, and advocate for the protocol and community. To achieve those goals, it will build its own lean team, and provide grants to, support, and/or work alongside a number of existing and new values- and mission-aligned organizations.\n\nUniswap Labs is one of many organizations in the Uniswap ecosystem. It built, deployed, and, alongside many other teams, will continue to contribute to and build on the Protocol in the future.\n\nAs a commitment to the proper decentralization of the protocol, Uniswap Labs had previously provided a royalty free perpetual license for V3 and related trademarks to the Uniswap Grants Program and selected grantees at UGP’s discretion. To succeed, the UF will require the ability to grant v3 BSL license exemptions, to maintain the governance forum, [Sybil.org ](http://sybil.org/), and Protocol-related developer docs, and to help facilitate protocol development across many teams. Labs has given their blessing to this preliminary proposal for asset transition.\n\n### What kind of legal entity will UF be?\n\nCurrently, this proposal is being made by the Uniswap Foundation, a pre-existing Delaware corporation formed by Uniswap community members Devin Walsh and Ken Ng. However, the UF team is conducting extensive research to determine the type of legal entity which best matches our ambitions, including our mission to make a positive social impact. The entity should also give the UF the ability to enter into contracts, open a bank account, and hire employees. Given these requirements, we are contemplating a US-based entity that would seek tax-exempt status. As there is no guarantee that tax-exempt status will be secured, we may make modifications to UF’s structure and operations in the future. We will share more about our path forward with the community as soon as we are able to.\n\n### What will happen to the $UNI after it’s sent to the UF?\n\nIf the proposal passes, funds will be sent to the UF multi-sig, which is custodied by the ED, Head of Operations, and UF Advisors.\n\nTo provide runway for our team and grantees, we intend to convert all $20M of the initial UNI disbursement to stablecoins and fiat over the first month of operation. We have established relationships with multiple brokers, are also exploring private sale options, and plan to pursue an approach which will minimize UNI price impact.\n\nWe similarly plan to diversify the remainder of funds in the second disbursement. At least one month prior to transfer, the UF will publish a Foundation Treasury Diversification report for this UNI. In the report, we will detail the amount we plan to diversify, which broker we plan to use, and how we plan to price the UNI sold.\n\n### How does UF’s Budget compare with the budgets of similar organizations across web3?\n\nThe **$74M** budget represents **~1.05%** of the total UNI supply. This is a relatively small percentage of UNI supply compared to the percentage of tokens allocated to Foundation and Grant programs by other protocol teams.\n\n* 45% of OP tokens have been allocated to an Optimism Ecosystem Fund (25%) and Retroactive public goods funding (20%) ([here ](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/allocations/#allocations-at-a-glance))\n* An unpublished portion of ~22% of dYdX were allocated to current and future employees and consultants of the Foundation ([here ](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/start-here/dydx-allocations))\n* ~26% of GRT was allocated to The Graph Foundation, educational programs, and grants ([here ](https://thegraph.com/blog/announcing-the-graphs-grt-sale))\n* 25% of CELO was allocated to Community and Operational Grants ([here ](https://medium.com/celoorg/understanding-cgld-allocation-estimated-circulating-supply-over-time-f08a063a23ad))\n* 12.5% of SOL was allocated to the Solana Foundation ([here ](https://messari.io/asset/solana/profile/launch-and-initial-token-distribution))\n* The Ethereum Foundation holds a treasury of $1.6B ([here ](https://ethereum.foundation/report-2022-04.pdf))\n\n### What happens to UGP and the UGP Subcommittees?\n\nTo start, UGP will continue operations as it exists today with the existing Allocation Committee. Once the Grants Lead is hired, they will lead all grants funding decisions and require final approval from either Devin or Ken (⅔ approval required from Grants Lead, Ken, and Devin).\n\nUF plans to continue to fund the existing UGP subcommittees as separate, supportive entities. [The Stable ](https://www.notion.so/3430a00270ea4d79be5c70d4ca99680a?v=b7b7697e1ff44055b87a6bd3480a3b2d&p=ed5d138f443d4c13997bf1572cfbd2e7)subcommittee will continue to be made up of Ken and [Boris ](https://twitter.com/B0R444). The UGP Community Analytics subcommittees will continue to be made up of [Yj ](https://twitter.com/uniyj1), [Fede](https://twitter.com/Fly_Ams), [RantumBits ](https://twitter.com/RantumBits), [Annamira ](https://twitter.com/annamirajo), TZM, and [Trea Qura](https://twitter.com/Treaqura).\n\n### How does the UF plan on being sustainable over time?\n\nThis proposal would fund UF operations for at least 3 years. In the future, we plan to return to the community to increase our operating budget when we approach 18 months of runway.\n\nWe also predict our grants budget will last approximately 3 years. In the future, we plan to return to the community to increase our grants budget when we approach 6 months of funds remaining.\n\n### What is UGP, and how do I find out more about it?\n\nThe Uniswap Grants Program started after going through a [governance vote](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-grants-program-v0-1/9081) in December 2020 for an allocation of $1.5M in UNI intended to last 6 months. While the initial set of priorities for UGP was narrowly scoped as an MVP to seed the ecosystem of developers, it has since grown to encompass more, including governance research, community building and education, and core protocol work. Due to the crypto market bull run we were able to give $7M in grants over 18 months.\n\nGrants researcher [@sovereignsignal ](https://twitter.com/sovereignsignal)also recently put together a fantastic (independent) write-up on the history of the UGP [here](https://sovereignsignal.substack.com/p/breaking-down-the-uniswap-grants).\n\nFor more information on UGP’s past work and grantees check out the following links:\n\n* [UGP Homepage ](https://www.notion.so/Welcome-to-UNI-Grants-6e3e84967a984a5fb127ae749649ddc9) (still accepting applications!)\n* [UGP Twitter](https://twitter.com/uniswapgrants)\n* [UGP Process Outline](https://www.notion.so/5b34ef6b77964960844a86daeb4d9a26)\n* [UGP RFPs & Challenges](https://www.notion.so/RFPs-Challenges-3be614ba4e504b5caeee7b0159e64a42)\n* [UGP Grantees ](https://www.notion.so/8e8ba8344967488a85106309d48a4a3a)(h/t [@sovereignsignal ](https://twitter.com/sovereignsignal))\n* UGP Subcommittees (delegated resource allocators for targeted grants focused within a specific category)\n  * [The Stable](https://www.notion.so/The-Stable-the-first-30-days-b3826f0cae964b1aa3a02e3188e2cd4f) led by [b0r4](https://twitter.com/B0R444)\n  * [UGP Community Analytics](https://www.notion.so/b09bbb16579d4a569b7e2d393afc4459) led by [Yj](https://twitter.com/uniyj1), [Fede](https://twitter.com/Fly_Ams), [RantumBits](https://twitter.com/RantumBits), [Annamira ](https://twitter.com/annamirajo), TZM, and [Trea Qura](https://twitter.com/Treaqura)\n\n### What does a successful UGP grant look like? What are some UGP success stories?\n\nGrantees have done some incredible work over the past 1.5 years - for more information, check out our recent [retrospective ](https://mirror.xyz/kennethng.eth/0WHWvyE4Fzz50aORNg3ixZMlvFjZ7frkqxnY4UIfZxo) on UGP v0.1.\n\nHowever, most UGP grantees are less than a year old. Just like with any product, it may take some time and several iterations for grant projects to develop traction and see adoption. The first version of Uniswap only worked for a single LP and ETH/ERC20 pair, and looked much different than the Uniswap we know and love today (still live [here ](https://haydenadams.github.io/uniswap-retro/)!). [Hardat ](https://hardhat.org/), too, took time to become what it is today - Nomic Labs received its first grant in 2018.\n\nWith that being said, not every grant will have the same outcome as a Uniswap or Hardhat. Not every grant will have runaway adoption, just like with any startup. Even when a project does not have the expected or intended impact, it can still have a positive impact on the ecosystem, bringing in new developers, users, and ideas.\n\nGrantee success can be a range of impactful outcomes and, although we can’t pick favorites, some notable highlights are:\n\n* [Serv.eth](https://serveth.support/) Discord support - a globally distributed team of 10 supporting the Uniswap Discord server all hours of every day. They have resolved over 15,000 community support tickets (and counting!), from helping users set up their first wallet and making their first trades, to identifying scammers and helping others retrieve funds.\n* [GFX labs](https://gfx.xyz/) cross-chain governance research - The GFX team have been active Uniswap contributors since the beginning — they were one of the first LPs on v3! Their UGP-funded research led to the the Protocol’s first cross-chain governance proposal, the deployment of the [1bps fee tier](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/2/14?chain=mainnet) on Polygon.\n* [Chaos Labs](https://chaoslabs.xyz/) [TWAP hardhat plugin](https://github.com/ChaosLabsInc/uniswap-v3-oracle-cli) - One of Uniswap’s most under-appreciated innovations is the [TWAP oracle](https://chaoslabs.xyz/posts/chaos-labs-uniswap-v3-twap-deep-dive-pt-1), a core but admittedly complex DeFi primitive. Chaos Labs recognized the need for more robust tooling and documentation to make integrating TWAPs more accessible. They created a Hardhat plugin so anyone can leverage its robust security and accurate price reporting.\n* [Scopelift](https://www.scopelift.co/) Seatbelt & Flexible Voting- Scopelift productionised [Seatbelt](https://github.com/Uniswap/governance-seatbelt) for governance testing. This test suite not only protects against unverified contracts, but also simulates proposals locally to ensure they deploy results properly. Additionally, their initial work on [Flexible Voting](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-upgrading-to-a-flexible-voting-enabled-governor/17098) would enable governance tokens locked in other protocols (for example, cUNI) to be leveraged for cross-protocol governance voting.\n* [OmniAnalytics](https://omnianalytics.org/) [uniswappeR](https://github.com/Omni-Analytics-Group/uniswappeR) - The first R package created to interact with, quickly query, and trade on Uniswap, opening the door for more advanced data analyses. The Omni team went above and beyond their grant scope to deliver video [tutorials](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GpWZLMB2lvM), extensive [documentation](https://github.com/Omni-Analytics-Group/uniswappeR), and an easy [dashboard generator ](https://github.com/Omni-Analytics-Group/uniswappeR-dashboarding)for in-depth exploration of trade history, LP and price simulations under infinitely customizable conditions including slippage and liquidity depth.\n* [TechEducators](https://techeducators.co.uk/) Solidity Bootcamp - As an established web2 bootcamp, the team behind ETHAnglia have built an open source Solidity Bootcamp to better usher web2 developers into web3 with a focus on building secure Ethereum dApps. Their target demographic reaches to underserved populations in the UK, offering scholarships and free mentorships. Through this work, they have received recognition and further support from the UK government through the Department for Works and Pensions.\n\n### How will UGP be improved within the UF?\n\nEven with the success cases listed above, there are a number of ways that we’re excited to improve UGP for the benefit of the ecosystem.\n\n* **Provide grants to universities and research institutions:** Today, UGP is a multisig without a legal entity so we are unable sign contracts with or award grants to universities and academic research institutions, among others. As a legal entity, the UF would allow us to work with these organizations.\n* **Diversify assets:** No legal entity also means UGP could not diversify its assets out of UNI due to a lack of clarity around tax liability. This has made it impossible to scope out and provide larger and longer-term grants due to UNI price risk. The ability to diversify our assets will allow us to award these kinds of grants, for more ambitious and impactful projects.\n* **Full-time well-compensated team:** UGP v0.1 was able to pay its small group of contributors part-time (≤30 hours per week). With an entity and full budget, the UF will be able to hire a full-time and well-compensated team. We also want to recognize the fact that a few UGP team members would still work 40+ hour weeks and weekends, uncompensated, due to a love for this work!\n* **Upscale all of UGP:** With a formal entity, larger budget, and a full-time team, we would be able to improve our internal processes, from the applicant pipeline through feedback cycles, decisions, disbursements, and ongoing grantee management. We can do more in proactive outreach to fill our pipeline with fresh ideas and new teams. We could shine more of a spotlight on the impact grantees have had on the community. We will also be able to scale up our legal and accounting capabilities required for a more comprehensive grants program.\n* **More communication:** With a larger team and a Comms/Social Media Lead, the UF would be able to more frequently highlight the work of grantees, as well as its own processes, decision-making frameworks, and operations to the community.\n\n### What are the UF's multisig addresses? \nThe UF Custody multisig is: 0xe571dC7A558bb6D68FfE264c3d7BB98B0C6C73fC\nThe UF Governance multisig is: 0xA37131410A76791f4A0210e91EDD554d85aFb4d4\n\n*Linking to comments in Temp check for outstanding questions, we hit the character limit!*\n\n### What kinds of Grants would an expanded UGP be able to provide?\n\n[https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17358/37](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17358/37)\n\n### What types of candidates are you seeking for 3rd board member?\n\n[https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17358/33](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17358/33)\n\n### Can you provide more information about the Grants funding allocation for novel incentive mechanisms?\n\n[https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17358/33](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17358/33)\n\n### How did you decide to set OKRs the way they are set in this proposal?\n\n[https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17358/23](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17358/23)\n\n### How does the fee switch play into the UF’s roadmap?\n\n[https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17358/16](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17358/16)\n\n*If this proposal is passed, we and the Foundation shall undertake our work abiding by the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.*\n\n*It is the Foundation’s current intent to use the disbursement in accordance with the terms of, and achieve the results described in, this Proposal.

      "content": "[Read the full proposal here: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17358]\n\nUniswap Foundation: Preamble\nUniswap has already changed the world.\n\nIn only 3 years, the world’s first automated market maker has pioneered DeFi primitives, supported more than $1T 7 in cumulative volume, and served millions of users 4 worldwide. Its daily volume today is on par with Coinbase 10.\n\nOwnership of the protocol was transferred to the community 12 in 2020 and since then the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) has demonstrated the potential for community-funded initiatives to make a positive impact. Over 1.5 years, UGP has funded 120+ grantees 22 improving governance, and developing new interfaces and developer tooling.\n\nHowever, there is still work to do to help Uniswap reach its full potential. The governance process has too much friction, the ecosystem is too difficult to navigate, and UGP in its current form is not able to fund the most ambitious and impactful projects.\n\nWe want to change that.\n\nToday, we are excited to propose the creation of the Uniswap Foundation, which has the mission to support the decentralized growth and sustainability of the Uniswap Protocol and its supporting ecosystem and community.\n\nIn other words, the goal of the Uniswap Foundation is to support you.\n\nUniswap’s community is expansive, encompassing the universe of individuals and organizations which build on and benefit from decentralized protocols. Your contributions have already made Uniswap a success, but we want to help you accomplish much more.\n\nThe Uniswap Foundation (UF) will provide grants to builders, researchers, organizers, academics, analysts, and more to grow the Protocol and plan for its future.\n\nIt will make it easier to govern the protocol and community treasury, and to navigate the broader ecosystem.\n\nIt will help you make an impact – to reduce friction, and amplify your efforts.\n\nWe believe that Uniswap will be the value exchange layer of the Internet.\n\nIt brought the automated market maker to the masses.\n\nIt has led the way in the evolution and growth of DeFi and web3.\n\nIt is censorship resistant, permissionless, decentralized, and secure – constituting a set of properties which we believe should define our world’s financial infrastructure.\n\nBut there is still a long way to go for Uniswap to reach its full potential.\n\nWe’re excited to work with all of you to make that happen.\n\nIf you’re excited too, please read our proposal, comment, reach out to chat (our DMs - @devinawalsh and @nkennethk are open!), and spread the word.\n\nUniswap Foundation Proposal\nThis proposal is being put forth by the Uniswap Foundation, a Delaware corporation formed by Uniswap community members Devin Walsh and Ken Ng to facilitate the steps outlined in this proposal.\n\nTL;DR\nToday, we are thrilled to propose the creation of the Uniswap Foundation (UF).\nScope: The UF, the first Foundation of a major protocol to go through the community governance process, will support the Protocol’s decentralized growth, reinvigorate governance, and serve as a Protocol advocate.\nTeam: Devin Walsh will serve as the Executive Director, Ken Ng will serve as Head of Operations, and they will build out a team of 12.\nBudget: To fund these efforts, we are requesting:\nA $14M Operating budget to cover a full team for 3 years\nA $60M expanded Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) budget to cover 3+ years\nWe are requesting $74M total, which will be broken into two disbursements, with a first disbursement of $20M.\nGovernance Participation: We are also requesting 2.5M UNI to participate in governance, primarily through delegation. Through usage of a new smart contract primitive The Franchiser 40, this UNI will be revocable by the DAO at any time, and cannot be used for any purpose outside of governance.\nUniswap Foundation\nMission\nIn pursuit of a more open and fair financial system, the Uniswap Foundation supports the decentralized growth and sustainability of the Uniswap Protocol and its supporting ecosystem.\n\nKey Activities and OKRs\nWe have listed our starting OKRs below. It’s possible these OKRs will have to change in the future. If they do change in a meaningful way, we will communicate that to the community.\n\nGrowth: Promoting Decentralization & Growth of the Protocol and Ecosystem\n \n![OKR 1.png](ipfs://bafkreibefwld5zfnkhfrilv7wiotjszoq3k6jyd6hmdv35dc3l56xgldtq)\n    \n\nGovernance: Reinvigorating the Uniswap Community Governance Process\n \n![OKR 2.png](ipfs://bafkreictfkmisbuahzumwmvlol4nl3sx4qnemfryeg4oc5fe36cqnhayoi)\n    \n\nAdvocacy: Advocating for the Protocol and amplifying its positive social impact\n \n![OKR 3.png](ipfs://bafkreiaoplgtuug6tkpthgnnzwn4a6gq6av4dvrqpfddajtjtdbmcexoby)\n    \n\nOptimism Phase 0 token distribution link here 6\n\nYear 1 Roadmap\nOur roadmap for the first year of operations includes but is not limited to the following activities:\n \n![Year 1.png](ipfs://bafkreigbddie5gfbetvp5lny5gvun7x3umpfqlqk7hhkcbtzz3mqj4itam)\n    \n\nOptimism Collective community Constitution link here \n\nTeam\nDevin Walsh 108, Executive Director (ED)\n\nAs ED, Devin will be responsible for setting UF’s strategic vision alongside the Board and driving execution to achieve that vision.\n\nDevin has been in crypto since 2016. She has conducted independent research for MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, worked on decentralized identity at uPort (ConsenSys), and led protocol and venture investments at CoinFund. She has consulted with Edge & Node and cLabs, and led MIRA, a seed stage startup at the intersection of fine art and NFTs. She recently resigned as Chief of Staff at Uniswap Labs in order to propose the creation of the UF.\n\nKen Ng 69, Head of Operations\n\nAs Head of Operations, Ken will build and scale processes to maximize the UF’s impact.\n\nKen has served the Uniswap ecosystem as Lead of the Uniswap Grants Program 1 for the past 1.5 years. He has helped run the Ethereum Foundation Ecosystem Support Program, which gave Hayden his initial grant 7 to build Uniswap. He served as COO of Slingshot Finance and cofounder of his nonprofit eduDAO, which helps raise funds for students and teachers in the Bronx.\n\nThe needs, and thus the makeup, of our team may change over time. However, today we aim to hire for following roles, with a focus on filling the Grants and Governance roles first:\n\n \n![Team.png](ipfs://bafkreib2uwfespzdr3p2c4tdcpi3ndznqjig55edrigkrfcgq2zqjdtn6y)\n    \n\nApplications are open today! Check out job descriptions here.\n\nAs noted by Other Internet 4, there is also a need for new structures to “facilitate coordination across the complex web of stakeholders” within the Uniswap ecosystem. To provide this much needed coordination, the UF will be committed to working with a variety of independent parties (freelancers, development teams, research fellows, analysts, and more) to achieve many of its objectives.\n\nAdvisors\nThe Foundation’s initial advisory team will be made up of the following individuals:\n\nJesse Walden, Founder and GP, Variant\nJulia Rosenberg, Co-Founder, Orca Protocol\nAlexis Gauba, Co-Founder, Opyn; Co-Founder, she256\nHart Lambur, Co-Founder of UMA\nIn addition to advising UF on strategy and roadmap, this group will, alongside the Executive Director (ED) and Head of Operations,\n\nProvide input on UF’s initial hiring decisions. This may include interviewing potential candidates and sharing feedback with the Committee as it determines its first hires, including its third Board member and at least next three team members.\nBecome temporary signers of the UF multi-sig, which will hold UF funds if and when the proposal is passed, for the sole purpose of executing approved proposals as instructed. This responsibility will be transitioned to UF team members once they are hired.\nBoard\nDevin Walsh and Ken Ng will serve as the first two Board members of the UF. Alongside the UF’s Advisors, they will interview and target to hire a third Board member in the first 3 months of operations.\n\nBudget\nWe are requesting $74M in UNI. This funding would be broken down into the following buckets:\n\n$60M for Uniswap Grants Program\nGrants spending will be broken down into the below categories. We will revisit and readjust these categories as needed to ensure we continue to deploy resources where they are most impactful.\n\nWe are proud of the work done by UGP thus far (memorialized in this retrospective 22), and are incredibly excited to expand the scope of its work.\n\n \n![Grants.png](ipfs://bafkreibtxk4n6pjqrccg2weocvjnqpoeuceje2sagxbgokqucfjombefjy)\n    \n\nWe are already in the process of assessing several high impact grant proposals which UGP would be excited to fund, if and when this proposal is passed. Two examples are:\n\nA version of Uniswap v3 written in Cairo, to be deployed on Starknet\nA prototype of an MEV estimation tool leveraging machine learning techniques built by respected academics in the space\nWe are also excited to continue funding ongoing work by existing grantees funded by UGP v0.1, including governance experiments and analyses from Other Internet, customer support from Serv.eth, and ETHGlobal hackathons.\n\nTo ensure community alignment with larger grants disbursements, the UF will put forth an off-chain Snapshot to the community for proposed grants larger than $2M.\n\nWe believe that this Grants budget will last approximately 3 years but this is subject to change depending upon the number and quality of applicants. We plan to approach the Treasury for additional Grants funds when there are ~6 months of funds remaining.\n\n$14M operating budget to build out a full team of 12 over the next two years.\nIn order to provide stability to our employees and to sustain the Foundation, we may make a request to the community for additional funding for further out than 3 years when we return to the Treasury at 6-12 months of operations (read more below).\n\nBudget estimate looking forward three years is below.\n \n![Budget.png](ipfs://bafkreiel3fzdoeharssfyzclubtlyk667p5skcnwkfinrus7b6za5tiuwi)\n    \n\n*Inclusive of UNI vesting. In order to incentivize a highly qualified team, the UF will offer competitive compensation packages including both fiat and long-term vesting UNI. To provide full transparency, we will disclose UF financials later this year.\n\n**The UF will allocate an additional $2M in funds to cover legal fees in the case of unexpected future litigation.\n\nFund Disbursements\nAn approval of this proposal is an approval for the full $74M budget requested.\n\nWe are requesting the funds in two disbursements:\n\n$20M now to cover operating expenses for the next 2 years and grants for 1 year. Assuming a UNI price of $7.04*, this initial request totals to 2,840,909 UNI.\n$54M, to be disbursed by the Uniswap Treasury in 6-12 months once the UF has completed the establishment of its legal entity. The UF will publish a post on the forum notifying the community a week prior to putting forth a formal governance proposal for the remaining funds. In other words, because this proposal approves the full amount of funding, we will not go through an additional the Temperature Check and Consensus Check steps to receive this second disbursement.\n*To calculate our final UNI request we will use the 30 day TWAP on the day we put forth our Governance Proposal. $7.04 is approximately the 30 day TWAP as of 8/3/2022.\n\nGovernance Participation\nThe UF is also requesting 2.5M UNI to participate in governance.\n\nThese tokens will be delegated to the UF by the Uniswap DAO through a new smart contract design, The Franchiser, which ensures the tokens are only used for delegation, and allows the DAO to claw back the tokens at any time. The UF plans to use these tokens primarily for delegation to community members without the requisite 2.5M UNI to submit a governance proposal, however the UF may also self-delegate the UNI to vote, and to put up its own proposals.\n\nThe Franchiser was developed by Noah Zinsmeister and was audited by Trail of Bits.\n\nNext Steps\nWe are excited to discuss this proposal with the broader community as it passes through the Request for Comment phase. Should sentiment be positive, a Temperature Check Snapshot poll will be set up on Mon., August 8. If the Temperature Check poll passes, additional feedback will be incorporated before moving forward to the Consensus Check.\n\nAdditionally, to discuss the proposal and answer your questions, we plan to attend the Uniswap Community call at 4 PM EST on Wed., August 10, and to host a Twitter Spaces on @uniswapgrants at 11 AM EST on Mon., August 15.\n\n[Read the full Proposal and Addendum here: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17358]",

      "title": "Should Uniswap provide Rage Trade with an additional use grant?",
      "content": "Authors: [Noodles](https://twitter.com/crypto_noodles) + [Crema](https://twitter.com/0xCrema) + [Vertex](https://twitter.com/0xVertex) \n\nRelated Discussion: Our proposal is similar to [Voltz Additional Use Grant](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/should-uniswap-provide-voltz-with-v3-additional-use-grant/15669)\n\n### What is Rage Trade?\n\n[Rage Trade](https://rage.trade) is a new perpetual swap  protocol built using Uniswap v3. Many on-chain perpetuals currently use Uniswap v2 style vAMMs. However, traders and LPs benefit from v3’s concentrated liquidity so we opted to build on v3 to design the most capital efficient perp.\n\n### Why do we need an additional use grant?\n\nOur proposal is most similar to the proposal by Voltz Protocol. Unlike Voltz we have not forked UNI v3’s code but instead we have built on top of it. Think of Uniswap as our matching engine, and on top we have built a risk engine to enable leverage trading. We have wrapped the following on top of Uniswap’s core: leverage trading, leverage LPing, cross-margin, liquidations, and real time funding rates. \n\n### What changes have we made that require additional use?\n\nWe have built libraries to enable leverage trading, leverage LPing, and real-time funding rates. Each of the libraries below makes use of Uniswap’s BUSL protect code (that we require an additional grants use for):\n\n- [SimulateSwap](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/SimulateSwap.sol): This library is used to simulate a swap on Rage. It makes use of Uniswap’s TickBitMap and SwapMath libraries.\n- [TickBitmapExtended](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/TickBitmapExtended.sol): This library is a slightly modified version of Uniswap's TickBitmap, required in SimulateSwap for using tick data from UniswapV3Pool contract.\n- [TickExtended](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/TickExtended.sol): This library is used to enable realtime funding payments on Rage Trade. They borrow from Tick libraries of Uniswap v3.\n- [LiquidityPosition](https://github.com/RageTrade/core/blob/ea881f6204f1bf7f065bd9a4b11ee792592c7230/contracts/libraries/LiquidityPosition.sol#L5): This library enables leverage liquidity providing (and the accompanying margin logic). It utilises the Uniswap SqrtPriceMath library to do so.\n\n\n ### How will approving this proposal benefit Uniswap?\n\n1. Onchain Perps bring new liquidity to UNI v3: Since we are strictly built on top of UNI v3 (not a fork) all additional TVL + trading volume is strictly additive to UNI v3.\n\n2. Rage Trade will spend significant R&D resources on designing efficient v3 LP strategie: Rage has already designed a new LP strategy known as the 80-20 strategy that composes with Curve’s tricrypto.\n\n3. Liquid & composable on-chain perpetuals enable a whole new world of Uniswap spot strategies: Using perps, Uniswap v3 users can mitigate impermanent loss on Uni v3 via delta hedging. Additionally multi-collateral perps open new avenues and payoffs that are currently not possible on the spot market. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nRage Trade stands to benefit Uniswap in many ways and strictly adds to Uniswap’s value as a protocol. We look forward to discussing our proposal with the Uniswap community and answering questions in the comments below.\n",

      "content": "Sponsored by GFX Labs for MiLLie\n\n## Description\n\nSince the original proposal to introduce a 1bp fee tier last fall [Discussion Adding 1 Basis Point Fee Pools in v3](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/discussion-adding-1-basis-point-fee-pools-in-v3/14216), there has been overwhelming data produced supporting the effectiveness of a 1bp fee tier in increasing swap volume on Uniswap.\n\nCurrently, the Uniswap 1bp fee tier is only available on Ethereum and Polygon ([Polygon 1bp Fee Tier 1](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/polygon-1bp-fee-tier/16488)), but I believe there is logic to deploying the fee tier to every chain that Uniswap is deployed to, given how impactful it is on stable swap volume. Optimism makes for an excellent candidate to deploy the 1bp fee tier to next, given the recent spike in activity.\n\nSince this result of the proposal will be executed on Optimism, the executing action needs to be forwarded to the proper target. To do that, [Timelock](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc) will send the transaction to [OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger](https://etherscan.io/address/0x25ace71c97B33Cc4729CF772ae268934F7ab5fA1#code) (Optimism mechanism to forward transactions from L1 to L2).\n\nThe transaction will then be sent via Optimism contracts to Uniswap’s [CrossChainAccount](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xa1dd330d602c32622aa270ea73d078b803cb3518#code), that is the privileged contract that can execute administrative tasks on protected contracts on L2 Optimism, and CrossChainAccount will forward the transaction, if it has the right origin, to the target Contract, in this case to [UniswapV3Factory](https://kovan-optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x1f98431c8ad98523631ae4a59f267346ea31f984).\n\nThis proposal has been already been executed on Kovan as a test.\n[Kovan Proposal](https://kovan.etherscan.io/tx/0x18013fbc91c6d7beff8b7d5eb576e2fb2c03d266fdaa83e47c34ec6e09fa3644#eventlog)\n[Kovan Optimism Execution](https://kovan-optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x21e372a4b907461e002f38f8da59d3e2e221a50f717a2852df743a8b283c91e4)\n\n\nMore info can be found on the [consensus check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-enable-1bp-fee-tier-on-uniswapv3-optimism-l2/16995) forum thread.

      "content": "**Summary**:\n\nEnable a 1bp, 1tick fee tier on optimism (L2).\n\nThe rationale and initial temperature check for this proposal can be found here: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-a-1bp-fee-tier-to-uniswapv3-on-optimism/16930\n\n**Process**:\n\nThe complete process is described in Uniswap’s Governance Reference here 4 and can be summarized as:\n\n• A proposal is posted in GovernorBravo on Mainnet (GovernorAlpha for Kovan)\n\n• The proposal is voted, queued and executed via Timelock.\n\n• When all the conditions are meet and is executed, Timelock contract, which is authorized to execute administrative actions on the protected contracts, will execute \nthe requested actions in the proposal.\n\nSince this proposal needs to be executed on a different network, in this case L2 Optimism, the executing action needs to be forwarded to the proper target. In order to do that, Timelock will send the transaction to OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger (Optimism mechanism to forward transactions from L1 to L2).\n\nThe transaction will then be sent via Optimism contracts to Uniswap’s CrossChainAccount, that is the privileged contract that can execute administrative tasks on protected contracts on L2 Optimism, and CrossChainAccount will forward the transaction, if it has the right origin, to the target Contract, in this case to UniswapV3Factory.\nThe sequence of contract interactions is the following:\n\n• GovernorBravo.propose(targets, values, signatures, calldatas, description)\n    ◦ where targets are the address of the contracts to interact with,\n    ◦ calldatas the calldatas to execute on those contracts, and\n    ◦ description, the description of the proposal (or name)\n\n• OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage(target, calldata, gas)\n    ◦ where target is the address of the contracts to interact with on L2,\n    ◦ calldata the calldata to execute on that contract, and\n    ◦ gas, the gas to be used on that transaction\n\n• CrossChainAccount.forward(target, calldata)\n    ◦ where target is the address of the Uniswap contracts to interact with on L2, and\n    ◦ calldata the calldata to execute on that contract\n\n• UniswapV3Factory.enableFeeAmount(fee,tickSpacing)\n    ◦ where fee is the fee to enable (in hundredths of a bip), and\n    ◦ tickSpacing the spacing between ticks\n\nCompiling all the calls together it can be seen as:\n\nGovernorBravo.propose(\n[OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger address],\n[ 0 ],\n[ “” ],\n[ encodedCalldata(\nOVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage(\nCrossChainAccount address,\nencodedCalldata(CrossChainAccount.forward(\nUniswapV3Factory

      "content": "*ChicagoDAO is partnering with Protocol Guild to bring this proposal to the Uniswap community! ChicagoDAO is a student group at the University of Chicago focused on pioneering a new model for decentralized organizations and building a community on the foundation of research, education, and development.*\n\n*Find us on Twitter at [@ChicagoDAO_io](https://twitter.com/chicagodao_io)!* \n\n—---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAuthors: [Trent](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps) (PG Member), [Tim](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko) (PG Member)\n\n\n### Abstract\n\nThis is a proposal for the Uniswap community to support important Ethereum Public Goods through the Protocol Guild: a vested split contract which goes to 110 core protocol contributors.\n\nWe propose that 500k UNI (~$2.5mm @ $5.19 UNI) be allocated to support the ongoing work of these core contributors in the initial Protocol Guild Pilot.\n\nParticipating in the 1 year Pilot allows guild members to engage with Uniswap in a way that is values- and incentive-aligned. Simultaneously, it will allow them to continue the important work of scaling our shared infrastructure and making it as resilient as possible for the applications on top of it.\n\n### Useful links\n\n* [Protocol Guild Docs](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)\n* [1 Year Vesting Contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/)\n* [Initial Announcement - Dec 2021](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/mEDvFXGCKdDhR-N320KRtsq60Y2OPk8rHcHBCFVryXY)\n* [List of Members](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html)\n* [PG twitter account](https://twitter.com/ProtocolGuild)\n\n### Context\n\n1. As a credibly neutral, maximally uncapturable infrastructure with no block reward, the Ethereum base protocol doesn’t offer the same token incentives to contributors as applications or L2s can. However, the protocol still needs to attract and retain talent to continue to evolve. As the broader ecosystem continues to grow, competition for talented individuals will only increase. This isn’t to fault individuals for rationally weighting financial incentives, or protocols for leveraging the power of tokens - this is just the reality of the current context. We also acknowledge that financial motivations aren’t the only or best motivator for people, it’s just one tool in our toolset that is currently underleveraged.\n2. Existing public goods funding solutions tend to be either too narrow or broad in scope, fail to exclusively target core protocol contributors, or depend on an intermediating institution, which often leads to organizations, and not individuals, being recipients of funds.\n3. The Protocol benefits from contributor continuity. Transferring institutional knowledge between cohorts is more likely to happen successfully the more overlap there is.\n\nHere’s a longer exploration of the [project rationale](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1-proposal-rationale.html).\n\nIf we believe what we are building is important, then we should structure the incentives to attract more smart people to work on it. After all - “Ethereum is an unprecedented arena for playing cooperative games”; we should try to manifest the novel possibilities made possible by this arena. ([Griffith, 2019](https://medium.com/@virgilgr/ethereum-is-game-changing-technology-literally-d67e01a01cf8))\n\n### What is the Protocol Guild?\n\nThe Protocol Guild aims to address the challenges mentioned above with a simple tool: a weighted split contract that includes vesting. Members will solicit sponsorships in the form of tokens from applications & protocols that build on Ethereum, which gives core contributors exposure to success at the application layer:\n\n* current contributors are rewarded for past work through [time-based weighting](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/6-guidelines-for-regular-operation.html#weighting)\n* current contributors contribute for longer periods, resulting in less contributor churn, better institutional knowledge transfer, and more stable core infrastructure\n* new contributors are incentivized to join core protocol work, protocol evolution and maintenance is more robust\n\nTo date, the membership includes over 110 Ethereum protocol contributors, including researchers, client maintainers, upgrade coordinators, and more, all self-curated (member list [here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html)). This is a broad-based ecosystem effort: members come from 22 different teams and 9 organizations. Only 30% of members are directly employed by the EF. The membership is continuously curated and there are quarterly updates to the split contract.\n\nThe Guild contracts will act as an autonomous value routing mechanism, operated independently from any existing institution, purpose-built for incentivizing long-term core protocol work. At no point does PG take custody of funds on behalf of members, it is all handled trustlessly.\n\n### PG Pilot\n\nSince starting the project in Nov 2021, we’ve built norms around member onboarding, refined the splitting and vesting mechanisms, and have created extensive documentation on how PG operates. At this point, we’re ready to test the mechanism’s efficacy with a 1 year / $10-20mm Pilot. We want to make sure the mechanism operates smoothly before graduating to a larger round with longer vesting periods. We are currently outreaching to 5-10 prominent Ethereum-based projects to get commitments for this important first milestone. We want to ensure there is a healthy diversity of contributing protocols both in terms of USD value as well as domain (eg. DeFi, staking, etc). The first commitment is from Lido to contribute [2,000,000 LDO](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-protocol-guild-pilot-via-a-lido-grant/2016/1), and the [vote](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xe07284156fb063d5fba6b9fed50cc74fad36ea02c2ede0207434db476884104b) ([forum post](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep13-executable-support-the-protocol-guild-pilot/12877/50)) to contribute 200k ENS will conclude in the next few days.\n\nThe funds for the Pilot would be vested directly to Guild members over one year: see the [Pilot vesting contract here](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/). Note that funds would not replace salaries for core contributors, and each recipient would be making an independent decision about how to use their tokens once vested.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe are inviting the Uniswap community to be part of this inaugural Pilot in the form of a 500k UNI transfer to the Protocol Guild’s vesting contract. We think this is an appropriate amount which balances between the current size of the treasury ([$1.2b as of May 16, 2022](https://openorgs.info/)), the number of beneficiaries, and the scope and intent of the Pilot.\n\nThere are a few reasons why supporting the Protocol Guild benefits the Uniswap community:\n\n* Uniswap’s long-term success is tightly coupled with the continued evolution and maintenance of the Ethereum protocol. These are projects that often have multi-year timelines. Contributing to the Pilot meaningfully increases the incentive to contribute to the core protocol, including:\n  * [The Merge](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Merge/mainnet-readiness.md): moving from PoW to PoS, increasing security and sustainability\n  * EVM improvements: new functionality for developers like [EOF](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ipsilon/evm-object-format-overview)\n  * [Statelessness](https://notes.ethereum.org/@gballet/Sy-a6T5St): sustainable management for state growth\n  * Supporting L2 scaling: [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844), [EIP-4488](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488)\n  * [Proposer Builder Separation](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/pbs_censorship_resistance): reducing centralizing incentives for consensus participants\n  * Continuous client maintenance: improving sync, exploring new database types, researching modular clients\n  * Coordinating network upgrades: making sure the community helps to shape and is aware of network upgrades\n* Having exposure to UNI allows protocol contributors to engage more with Uniswap governance. Members will be encouraged (but not obligated) to use the vested tokens in their respective governance framework.\n* Uniswap should be among the protocols maximally aligned with the Public Goods of the largest ecosystem it operates in. Pilot participation maintains and expands the Uniswap community’s existing reputation for funding Public Goods.\n* Diverse funding sources from the community further decentralizes protocol governance and prevents influence from pooling with any single entity.\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "Authors: [Trent](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps) (PG Member), [Tim](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko) (PG Member)\n\n### Abstract\n\nThis is a proposal for the Uniswap community to support important Ethereum Public Goods through the Protocol Guild: a vested split contract which goes to 110 core protocol contributors.\n\nWe propose that 500k UNI (~$2.5mm @ $5.19 UNI) be allocated to support the ongoing work of these core contributors in the initial Protocol Guild Pilot.\n\nParticipating in the 1 year Pilot allows guild members to engage with Uniswap in a way that is values- and incentive-aligned. Simultaneously, it will allow them to continue the important work of scaling our shared infrastructure and making it as resilient as possible for the applications on top of it.\n\n### Useful links\n\n* [Protocol Guild Docs](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#)\n* [1 Year Vesting Contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/)\n* [Initial Announcement - Dec 2021](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/mEDvFXGCKdDhR-N320KRtsq60Y2OPk8rHcHBCFVryXY)\n* [List of Members](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html)\n* [PG twitter account](https://twitter.com/ProtocolGuild)\n\n### Context\n\n1. As a credibly neutral, maximally uncapturable infrastructure with no block reward, the Ethereum base protocol doesn’t offer the same token incentives to contributors as applications or L2s can. However, the protocol still needs to attract and retain talent to continue to evolve. As the broader ecosystem continues to grow, competition for talented individuals will only increase. This isn’t to fault individuals for rationally weighting financial incentives, or protocols for leveraging the power of tokens - this is just the reality of the current context. We also acknowledge that financial motivations aren’t the only or best motivator for people, it’s just one tool in our toolset that is currently underleveraged.\n2. Existing public goods funding solutions tend to be either too narrow or broad in scope, fail to exclusively target core protocol contributors, or depend on an intermediating institution, which often leads to organizations, and not individuals, being recipients of funds.\n3. The Protocol benefits from contributor continuity. Transferring institutional knowledge between cohorts is more likely to happen successfully the more overlap there is.\n\nHere’s a longer exploration of the [project rationale](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1-proposal-rationale.html).\n\nIf we believe what we are building is important, then we should structure the incentives to attract more smart people to work on it. After all - “Ethereum is an unprecedented arena for playing cooperative games”; we should try to manifest the novel possibilities made possible by this arena. ([Griffith, 2019](https://medium.com/@virgilgr/ethereum-is-game-changing-technology-literally-d67e01a01cf8))\n\n### What is the Protocol Guild?\n\nThe Protocol Guild aims to address the challenges mentioned above with a simple tool: a weighted split contract that includes vesting. Members will solicit sponsorships in the form of tokens from applications & protocols that build on Ethereum, which gives core contributors exposure to success at the application layer:\n\n* current contributors are rewarded for past work through [time-based weighting](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/6-guidelines-for-regular-operation.html#weighting)\n* current contributors contribute for longer periods, resulting in less contributor churn, better institutional knowledge transfer, and more stable core infrastructure\n* new contributors are incentivized to join core protocol work, protocol evolution and maintenance is more robust\n\nTo date, the membership includes over 110 Ethereum protocol contributors, including researchers, client maintainers, upgrade coordinators, and more, all self-curated (member list [here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html)). This is a broad-based ecosystem effort: members come from 22 different teams and 9 organizations. Only 30% of members are directly employed by the EF. The membership is continuously curated and there are quarterly updates to the split contract.\n\nThe Guild contracts will act as an autonomous value routing mechanism, operated independently from any existing institution, purpose-built for incentivizing long-term core protocol work. At no point does PG take custody of funds on behalf of members, it is all handled trustlessly. The diagram below and the [docs](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3-smart-contract.html) have more information.\n\n \n![0xsplits horizontal.png](ipfs://QmdpmizBcNGuVV5FZR4zLUz3wsYTTdfNpVZsywMC7Utpdo)\n    \n\n### PG Pilot\n\nSince starting the project in Nov 2021, we’ve built norms around member onboarding, refined the splitting and vesting mechanisms, and have created extensive documentation on how PG operates. At this point, we’re ready to test the mechanism’s efficacy with a 1 year / $10-20mm Pilot. We want to make sure the mechanism operates smoothly before graduating to a larger round with longer vesting periods. We are currently outreaching to 5-10 prominent Ethereum-based projects to get commitments for this important first milestone. We want to ensure there is a healthy diversity of contributing protocols both in terms of USD value as well as domain (eg. DeFi, staking, etc). The first commitment is from Lido to contribute [2,000,000 LDO](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-protocol-guild-pilot-via-a-lido-grant/2016/1), and the [vote](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xe07284156fb063d5fba6b9fed50cc74fad36ea02c2ede0207434db476884104b) ([forum post](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep13-executable-support-the-protocol-guild-pilot/12877/50)) to contribute 200k ENS will conclude in the next few days.\n\nThe funds for the Pilot would be vested directly to Guild members over one year: see the [Pilot vesting contract here](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/). Note that funds would not replace salaries for core contributors, and each recipient would be making an independent decision about how to use their tokens once vested.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe are inviting the Uniswap community to be part of this inaugural Pilot in the form of a 500k UNI transfer to the Protocol Guild’s vesting contract. We think this is an appropriate amount which balances between the current size of the treasury ([$1.2b as of May 16, 2022](https://openorgs.info/)), the number of beneficiaries, and the scope and intent of the Pilot.\n\nThere are a few reasons why supporting the Protocol Guild benefits the Uniswap community:\n\n* Uniswap’s long-term success is tightly coupled with the continued evolution and maintenance of the Ethereum protocol.

      "title": "Deploy Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain",
      "content": "Context\n-------\n\nAfter passing the [Temperature Check vote](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xb328c7583c0f1ea85f8a273dd36977c95e47c3713744caf7143e68b65efcc8a5) with 7M UNI voting in favor of deploying Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain (GC), and [Consensus Check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x729c19f1cafab8ed884914549e147ef401532cf6680e340a1aa0c8cc65f35f09) with 14M UNI voting, we are now posting this proposal as an on-chain governance proposal. To ensure the proposal executes as expected, we have provided [a simulation of hte transactions](https://github.com/gnosis/uniswap_proposal_simulation).\n\nHere is a link to the [Consensus Check Discussion](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-should-uniswap-v3-be-deployed-to-gnosis-chain/16663).\n\nAbout Gnosis Chain\n------------------\n\nIn production since 2018 (as the xDai Chain), the rebranded [Gnosis Chain](https://www.gnosischain.com/) is rapidly evolving with a new focus and mission. Gnosis Chain (GC) provides a real-world value chain that closely mirrors the Ethereum 2.0 ecosystem. This includes a beacon chain framework, rollups, and other vital functionality. GC will serve in a front-running capacity for important Ethereum 2.0 updates.\n\nTuned parameters on Gnosis Chain enable faster blocks and epochs, low-cost stable transactions, and the opportunity to construct trustless bridges and conduct seamless transfers between GC and the Ethereum 2.0 mainnet.\n\nProposal\n--------\n\nThe Gnosis Chain team is committed to ecosystem development, adoption, and growth as the Eth2.0 landscape comes into focus. With a mission to \"accelerate Ethereum,\" Gnosis Chain is poised for expansion. With this in mind, we propose a Uniswap v3 deployment to Gnosis Chain. We believe there are many benefits for both Uniswap Labs and Uniswap users, some of which include:\n\n1.  A DeFi ecosystem primed for growth. Once deployed, Uniswap would become a cornerstone DeFi engine for protocols using and interacting within the ecosystem. Perpetual Protocol is a flagship protocol on GC that relies on Uniswap v3. This deployment will enable Perpetual to continue to flourish on the Gnosis Chain. Additional bluechip app deployments with growing TVL include Curve, Sushiswap, and Tornado Cash, with many new and promising DeFi projects choosing Gnosis Chain as their home base. A list of current projects is available at [https://gnosischain.world/](gnosischain.world)\n\n2.  An iterative environment. Uniswap Labs can experiment with new functionality and alpha test new features in a real-value environment (which differs from a test environment in that users behave differently with value on the line, token supply is limited, real adversaries exist, etc). Uniswap can spot and remediate any final potential issues stemming from important Ethereum updates prior to mainnet activation and take advantage of optimized slot and epoch times for faster iteration.\n\n3.  Tight Ethereum compatibility. Tools, resources, projects, and protocols supported by Ethereum are already supported on Gnosis Chain, with more onboarding regularly. Gnosis Safe is facilitating daily operations for many existing projects. [A trustless bridge architecture designed to connect Ethereum and Gnosis Chain is in the works](https://hackmd.io/g8TK7IzYQjClTTaor-ypIQ). The [Gnosis Beacon Chain validator set](https://beacon.gnosischain.com/) is expanding rapidly bringing massive decentralization to the chain.\\\n    The primary differences separating the GBC from the Ethereum Beacon chain include 5-second blocks and < 2-minute epochs, stable transactions with a max target of $.01 per 100K gas, and an economically and geographically diverse validator set, and a lower-stakes, lower-TVL environment.\n\n4.  Unique chain characteristics. Stable, low-cost transactions provide unique opportunities for Uniswap users. When gas costs are known and have a low impact on trade decisions, new strategies and approaches emerge which are currently untenable on the Ethereum mainnet or other chains with wide-ranging fee variability.\n\n5.  User incentives. A large directive for the Gnosis Chain is to increase the user base and on-chain activity by strategically allocating funds from the GnosisDAO treasury to promote adoption. An ecosystem fund has been created for this purpose, and we propose to use a portion of these funds to promote Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain. We propose providing up to $10M to incentivize the adoption of Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain.\n\nDetails for incentivized Adoption of Uniswap v3\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe $10M will be provided in GNO to foster the usage of Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain. The incentives should be designed together with other projects, which are operating on top of Uniswap v3 such as Perpetual Protocol, Gelato, or Stakewise. This should allow for more sustainable utilization of Uniswap as Gnosis Chain doesn't have a team dedicated to Uniswap v3. The GNO can be used to incentivize liquidity but should not be limited to this use case. Anything increasing usage of Uniswap v3, including building new applications on top of Uniswap v3 should be supported. The goal is to spend the $10M in the time period of 2 years. Funds not used after two years would go back to GnosisDAO. The spending is limited to $10M and the transferred amount of GNO as part of the proposal. GnosisDAO can decide to top up this amount based on the outcome of this initiative.\n\nCross-Chain Governance with Nomad\n---------------------------------\n\nSince the Temperature Check, we have discussed with stakeholders within the Uniswap ecosystem, who have expressed a desire to see trust-minimized bridges used for governance for new Uniswap v3 deployments. In addition, we've also seen the [Nomad](http://nomad.xyz/) team's proposal to [deploy v3 on Moonbeam](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-deploy-uniswap-v3-to-moonbeam/16624), which includes a section addressing this, as well as documenting the current fragmented approach to governance across various v3 deployments.\n\nIn the interest of taking a standardized approach to cross-chain governance of v3 deployments moving forward, we've partnered with the Nomad team to leverage the Nomad generalized message passing channels to manage the governance of the Uniswap v3 deployment on Gnosis Chain.\n\nWe believe that Nomad is the best solution for cross-chain governance, as it:\n\n-   [Supports generalized messages](https://docs.nomad.xyz/) between chains\n-   Does not rely on a multi-sig or validator set, but rather leverages an optimistic mechanism that allows bad messages to be challenged via fraud proofs\n\nNomad will be deployed on Gnosis Chain shortly and will leverage [Gnosis Zodiac Modules](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac) as part of its governance stack.\n\nWe are excited about partnering with Nomad to create a trust-minimized governance stack that can offer a standard for the Uniswap ecosystem.\n\nLicense Exemption\n-----------------\n\nWe are requesting an exemption that will allow Gnosis Ltd. to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Gnosis Chain, a layer 1 blockchain with deep connections to Ethereum, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control.\n\nTimeline\n--------\n\nFollowing the Consensus Check phase, we will submit this proposal shortly after to an on-chain vote. Provided that the proposal passes both steps, and all governance systems have been built and audited, we will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap v3 deployment on Gnosis Chain.\n\nProposal Acceptance and Execution\n---------------------------------\n\nAs the proposal funding has to come from GnosisDAO, this proposal has to be accepted by both: UNI and GNO token holders. The execution of this proposal is dependent also on the acceptance of the proposal by GnosisDAO. The GnosisDAO proposal has to include the setup of the multi-sig and the allocation of GNO and would be executed once it is accepted by GNO token holders. Two singers from the Uniswap community and two singers from the GnosisDAO community should be selected to participate in the multisig wallet.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nThe Gnosis Chain is preparing for substantial growth in the coming year. We have implemented an aggressive infrastructure grants program including large grants to Nethermind, Lighthouse and Erigon client teams to support base-layer functionality and security. The [ecosystem fund](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-16-gnosis-chain-xdai-gnosis-merge/1904) will bring in many new projects, and we feel Uniswap v3 is an essential component that will serve as a foundational layer for this growth.\n\nWe welcome any questions and comments and are happy to provide any clarifications as needed. We are excited to submit this proposal to the Uniswap community and look forward to your feedback! Thank you.",

      "title": "Deploy Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain",
      "content": "Context\n-------\n\nAfter passing the [Temperature Check vote](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xb328c7583c0f1ea85f8a273dd36977c95e47c3713744caf7143e68b65efcc8a5) with 7M UNI voting in favor of deploying Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain (GC), and [Consensus Check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x729c19f1cafab8ed884914549e147ef401532cf6680e340a1aa0c8cc65f35f09) with 14M UNI voting, we are now posting this proposal as an on-chain governance proposal. To ensure the proposal executes as expected, we have provided [a simulation of the transactions](https://github.com/gnosis/uniswap_proposal_simulation).\n\nHere is a link to the [Consensus Check Discussion](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-should-uniswap-v3-be-deployed-to-gnosis-chain/16663).\n\nAbout Gnosis Chain\n------------------\n\nIn production since 2018 (as the xDai Chain), the rebranded [Gnosis Chain](https://www.gnosischain.com/) is rapidly evolving with a new focus and mission. Gnosis Chain (GC) provides a real-world value chain that closely mirrors the Ethereum 2.0 ecosystem. This includes a beacon chain framework, rollups, and other vital functionality. GC will serve in a front-running capacity for important Ethereum 2.0 updates.\n\nTuned parameters on Gnosis Chain enable faster blocks and epochs, low-cost stable transactions, and the opportunity to construct trustless bridges and conduct seamless transfers between GC and the Ethereum 2.0 mainnet.\n\nProposal\n--------\n\nThe Gnosis Chain team is committed to ecosystem development, adoption, and growth as the Eth2.0 landscape comes into focus. With a mission to \"accelerate Ethereum,\" Gnosis Chain is poised for expansion. With this in mind, we propose a Uniswap v3 deployment to Gnosis Chain. We believe there are many benefits for both Uniswap Labs and Uniswap users, some of which include:\n\n1.  A DeFi ecosystem primed for growth. Once deployed, Uniswap would become a cornerstone DeFi engine for protocols using and interacting within the ecosystem. Perpetual Protocol is a flagship protocol on GC that relies on Uniswap v3. This deployment will enable Perpetual to continue to flourish on the Gnosis Chain. Additional bluechip app deployments with growing TVL include Curve, Sushiswap, and Tornado Cash, with many new and promising DeFi projects choosing Gnosis Chain as their home base. A list of current projects is available at [https://gnosischain.world/](gnosischain.world)\n\n2.  An iterative environment. Uniswap Labs can experiment with new functionality and alpha test new features in a real-value environment (which differs from a test environment in that users behave differently with value on the line, token supply is limited, real adversaries exist, etc). Uniswap can spot and remediate any final potential issues stemming from important Ethereum updates prior to mainnet activation and take advantage of optimized slot and epoch times for faster iteration.\n\n3.  Tight Ethereum compatibility. Tools, resources, projects, and protocols supported by Ethereum are already supported on Gnosis Chain, with more onboarding regularly. Gnosis Safe is facilitating daily operations for many existing projects. [A trustless bridge architecture designed to connect Ethereum and Gnosis Chain is in the works](https://hackmd.io/g8TK7IzYQjClTTaor-ypIQ). The [Gnosis Beacon Chain validator set](https://beacon.gnosischain.com/) is expanding rapidly bringing massive decentralization to the chain.\\\n    The primary differences separating the GBC from the Ethereum Beacon chain include 5-second blocks and < 2-minute epochs, stable transactions with a max target of $.01 per 100K gas, and an economically and geographically diverse validator set, and a lower-stakes, lower-TVL environment.\n\n4.  Unique chain characteristics. Stable, low-cost transactions provide unique opportunities for Uniswap users. When gas costs are known and have a low impact on trade decisions, new strategies and approaches emerge which are currently untenable on the Ethereum mainnet or other chains with wide-ranging fee variability.\n\n5.  User incentives. A large directive for the Gnosis Chain is to increase the user base and on-chain activity by strategically allocating funds from the GnosisDAO treasury to promote adoption. An ecosystem fund has been created for this purpose, and we propose to use a portion of these funds to promote Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain. We propose providing up to $10M to incentivize the adoption of Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain.\n\nDetails for incentivized Adoption of Uniswap v3\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe $10M will be provided in GNO to foster the usage of Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain. The incentives should be designed together with other projects, which are operating on top of Uniswap v3 such as Perpetual Protocol, Gelato, or Stakewise. This should allow for more sustainable utilization of Uniswap as Gnosis Chain doesn't have a team dedicated to Uniswap v3. The GNO can be used to incentivize liquidity but should not be limited to this use case. Anything increasing usage of Uniswap v3, including building new applications on top of Uniswap v3 should be supported. The goal is to spend the $10M in the time period of 2 years. Funds not used after two years would go back to GnosisDAO. The spending is limited to $10M and the transferred amount of GNO as part of the proposal. GnosisDAO can decide to top up this amount based on the outcome of this initiative.\n\nCross-Chain Governance with Nomad\n---------------------------------\n\nSince the Temperature Check, we have discussed with stakeholders within the Uniswap ecosystem, who have expressed a desire to see trust-minimized bridges used for governance for new Uniswap v3 deployments. In addition, we've also seen the [Nomad](http://nomad.xyz/) team's proposal to [deploy v3 on Moonbeam](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-deploy-uniswap-v3-to-moonbeam/16624), which includes a section addressing this, as well as documenting the current fragmented approach to governance across various v3 deployments.\n\nIn the interest of taking a standardized approach to cross-chain governance of v3 deployments moving forward, we've partnered with the Nomad team to leverage the Nomad generalized message passing channels to manage the governance of the Uniswap v3 deployment on Gnosis Chain.\n\nWe believe that Nomad is the best solution for cross-chain governance, as it:\n\n-   [Supports generalized messages](https://docs.nomad.xyz/) between chains\n-   Does not rely on a multi-sig or validator set, but rather leverages an optimistic mechanism that allows bad messages to be challenged via fraud proofs\n\nNomad will be deployed on Gnosis Chain shortly and will leverage [Gnosis Zodiac Modules](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac) as part of its governance stack.\n\nWe are excited about partnering with Nomad to create a trust-minimized governance stack that can offer a standard for the Uniswap ecosystem.\n\nLicense Exemption\n-----------------\n\nWe are requesting an exemption that will allow Gnosis Ltd. to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Gnosis Chain, a layer 1 blockchain with deep connections to Ethereum, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control.\n\nTimeline\n--------\n\nFollowing the Consensus Check phase, we will submit this proposal shortly after to an on-chain vote. Provided that the proposal passes both steps, and all governance systems have been built and audited, we will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap v3 deployment on Gnosis Chain.\n\nProposal Acceptance and Execution\n---------------------------------\n\nAs the proposal funding has to come from GnosisDAO, this proposal has to be accepted by both: UNI and GNO token holders. The execution of this proposal is dependent also on the acceptance of the proposal by GnosisDAO. The GnosisDAO proposal has to include the setup of the multi-sig and the allocation of GNO and would be executed once it is accepted by GNO token holders. Two singers from the Uniswap community and two singers from the GnosisDAO community should be selected to participate in the multisig wallet.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nThe Gnosis Chain is preparing for substantial growth in the coming year. We have implemented an aggressive infrastructure grants program including large grants to Nethermind, Lighthouse and Erigon client teams to support base-layer functionality and security. The [ecosystem fund](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-16-gnosis-chain-xdai-gnosis-merge/1904) will bring in many new projects, and we feel Uniswap v3 is an essential component that will serve as a foundational layer for this growth.\n\nWe welcome any questions and comments and are happy to provide any clarifications as needed. We are excited to submit this proposal to the Uniswap community and look forward to your feedback! Thank you.",

      "content": "Dear Uniswap community, \n  \n  A few weeks ago we (Blockchain at Michigan in partnership with the [Celo Foundation](https://celo.org/) and the [Celo Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/)) submitted a proposal to deploy Uniswap V3 on Celo to launch “Green Asset” Liquidity Pools and expand access to Uniswap to the 6B smartphone users around the world.\n  \n  We initiated the [Temperature Check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x4fdc5d5c87669d3c99072541e1c775f8dee9b906241b2ce22203737b608c8e55) and [Consensus Check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xa5b0e54358d8a0bff4b90461873cd4bec83e57d7b87f2e18b9a4ff81539b21ca)  on Snapshot, where the proposal received strong support from the Uniswap community (~100%) voted yes for the proposal. Before putting forth the formal on-chain governance proposal, we wanted to ensure we worked closely with Uniswap Labs and the Uniswap community to put forth clear documentation on the cross-chain governance bridging. We believe this proposal is a first step in a long and fruitful collaboration between the Celo and Uniswap communities—a journey we are particularly excited to embark on.\n  \n  We’re excited to initiate the formal governance proposal. We’d love to receive your support in this proposal. The proposal discussion can be found [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-deploy-uniswap-v3-on-celo/16686)\n  \n  ## Description\n  In partnership with the Celo Foundation and the Celo Climate Collective, we propose to authorize the deployment of the Uniswap protocol to Celo on behalf of the community.\n  \n  Celo is a mobile-first, carbon-negative, EVM-compatible blockchain. Specifically, we propose launching Uniswap on the Celo platform to:\n  * Increase Uniswap’s presence through $10M in financial incentives to Uniswap users, as well as  additional grant funding provided by the Celo Foundation to utilize Uniswap as a financial building block \n  * Bring Uniswap V3’s increased capital efficiency to the 6B smartphone users around the world\n  * Create green asset liquidity pools with natural capital backed assets such as tokenized carbon credits (e.g. MCO2, TCO2, and GNT) and future nature backed assets issued on Celo like land and forests\n  * Use Uniswap as a decentralized mechanism to rebalance the Celo Reserve with nature backed assets rather than relying on centralized exchanges\n  * Foster pathways for future green use cases on Uniswap\n  \n  Overall, we believe the Uniswap community’s mission of creating a trustless and decentralized financial infrastructure accessible to anyone aligns with Celo’s vision of tackling climate change and achieving prosperity for all.

      "title": "[Consensus Check] Should Uniswap v3 be deployed to Gnosis Chain?",
      "content": "## Context\n\nAfter passing the [Temperature Check vote](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xb328c7583c0f1ea85f8a273dd36977c95e47c3713744caf7143e68b65efcc8a5) with 7M UNI voting in favor of deploying Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain (GC), we are creating this post to move forward into the Consensus Check stage.\n\nComments on [the previous post](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-should-uniswap-v3-be-deployed-to-gnosis-chain/16513) expressed support for v3 deployment on GC, but also suggested more clarity on the following topics:\n\n* The team that will be deploying Uniswap v3 on GC\n* The bridge used to facilitate cross-chain governance for Uniswap v3 on GC\n* The details of liquidity incentives provided, including timelines and logistics for transferring funds\n\nWe have updated this post accordingly and provided more details on each of these items.\n\n## About Gnosis Chain\n\nIn production since 2018 (as the xDai Chain), the rebranded [Gnosis Chain](https://www.gnosischain.com/) is rapidly evolving with a new focus and mission. Gnosis Chain (GC) provides a real-world value chain that closely mirrors the Ethereum 2.0 ecosystem. This includes a beacon chain framework, rollups, and other vital functionality. GC will serve in a front-running capacity for important Ethereum 2.0 updates.\n\nTuned parameters on Gnosis Chain enable faster blocks and epochs, low-cost stable transactions, and the opportunity to construct trustless bridges and conduct seamless transfers between GC and the Ethereum 2.0 mainnet.\n\n## Proposal\n\nThe Gnosis Chain team is committed to ecosystem development, adoption, and growth as the Eth2.0 landscape comes into focus. With a mission to “accelerate Ethereum,” Gnosis Chain is poised for expansion. With this in mind, we propose a Uniswap v3 deployment to Gnosis Chain. We believe there are many benefits for both Uniswap Labs and Uniswap users, some of which include:\n\n1. A DeFi ecosystem primed for growth. Once deployed, Uniswap would become a cornerstone DeFi engine for protocols using and interacting within the ecosystem. Perpetual Protocol is a flagship protocol on GC that relies on Uniswap v3. This deployment will enable Perpetual to continue to flourish on the Gnosis Chain. Additional bluechip app deployments with growing TVL include Curve, Sushiswap, and Tornado Cash, with many new and promising DeFi projects choosing Gnosis Chain as their home base. A list of current projects is available at [https://gnosischain.world/\n](https://gnosischain.world/)\n2. An iterative environment. Uniswap Labs can experiment with new functionality and alpha test new features in a real-value environment (which differs from a test environment in that users behave differently with value on the line, token supply is limited, real adversaries exist, etc). Uniswap can spot and remediate any final potential issues stemming from important Ethereum updates prior to mainnet activation and take advantage of optimized slot and epoch times for faster iteration.\n\n3. Tight Ethereum compatibility. Tools, resources, projects, and protocols supported by Ethereum are already supported on Gnosis Chain, with more onboarding regularly. Gnosis Safe is facilitating daily operations for many existing projects. [A trustless bridge architecture designed to connect Ethereum and Gnosis Chain is in the works](https://hackmd.io/g8TK7IzYQjClTTaor-ypIQ). The [Gnosis Beacon Chain validator set](https://beacon.gnosischain.com/) is expanding rapidly bringing massive decentralization to the chain.\nThe primary differences separating the GBC from the Ethereum Beacon chain include 5-second blocks and < 2-minute epochs, stable transactions with a max target of $.01 per 100K gas, and an economically and geographically diverse validator set, and a lower-stakes, lower-TVL environment.\n\n4. Unique chain characteristics. Stable, low-cost transactions provide unique opportunities for Uniswap users. When gas costs are known and have a low impact on trade decisions, new strategies and approaches emerge which are currently untenable on the Ethereum mainnet or other chains with wide-ranging fee variability.\n\n5. User incentives. A large directive for the Gnosis Chain is to increase the user base and on-chain activity by strategically allocating funds from the GnosisDAO treasury to promote adoption. An ecosystem fund has been created for this purpose, and we propose to use a portion of these funds to promote Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain. We propose providing up to $10M to incentivize the adoption of Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain.\n\n## Details for incentivized Adoption of Uniswap v3\n\nThe $10M will be provided in GNO to foster the usage of Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain. The incentives should be designed together with other projects, which are operating on top of Uniswap v3 such as Perpetual Protocol, Gelato, or Stakewise. This should allow for more sustainable utilization of Uniswap as Gnosis Chain doesn’t have a team dedicated to Uniswap v3. The GNO can be used to incentivize liquidity but should not be limited to this use case. Anything increasing usage of Uniswap v3, including building new applications on top of Uniswap v3 should be supported. The goal is to spend the $10M in the time period of 2 years. Funds not used after two years would go back to GnosisDAO. The spending is limited to $10M and the transferred amount of GNO as part of the proposal. GnosisDAO can decide to top up this amount based on the outcome of this initiative.\n\n## Cross-Chain Governance with Nomad\n\nSince the Temperature Check, we have discussed with stakeholders within the Uniswap ecosystem, who have expressed a desire to see trust-minimized bridges used for governance for new Uniswap v3 deployments. In addition, we’ve also seen the [Nomad](http://nomad.xyz) team’s proposal to [deploy v3 on Moonbeam](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-deploy-uniswap-v3-to-moonbeam/16624), which includes a section addressing this, as well as documenting the current fragmented approach to governance across various v3 deployments.\n\nIn the interest of taking a standardized approach to cross-chain governance of v3 deployments moving forward, we’ve partnered with the Nomad team to leverage the Nomad generalized message passing channels to manage the governance of the Uniswap v3 deployment on Gnosis Chain.\n\nWe believe that Nomad is the best solution for cross-chain governance, as it:\n\n* [Supports generalized messages](https://docs.nomad.xyz/) between chains\n* Does not rely on a multi-sig or validator set, but rather leverages an optimistic mechanism that allows bad messages to be challenged via fraud proofs\n\nNomad will be deployed on Gnosis Chain shortly and will leverage [Gnosis Zodiac Modules](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac) as part of its governance stack.\n\nWe are excited about partnering with Nomad to create a trust-minimized governance stack that can offer a standard for the Uniswap ecosystem.\n\n## License Exemption\n\nWe are requesting an exemption that will allow Gnosis Ltd. to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Gnosis Chain, a layer 1 blockchain with deep connections to Ethereum, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control.\n\n## Timeline\n\nFollowing the Consensus Check phase, we will submit this proposal shortly after to an on-chain vote. Provided that the proposal passes both steps, and all governance systems have been built and audited, we will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap v3 deployment on Gnosis Chain.\n\n## Proposal Acceptance and Execution\n\nAs the proposal funding has to come from GnosisDAO, this proposal has to be accepted by both: UNI and GNO token holders. The execution of this proposal is dependent also on the acceptance of the proposal by GnosisDAO. The GnosisDAO proposal has to include the setup of the multi-sig and the allocation of GNO and would be executed once it is accepted by GNO token holders. Two singers from the Uniswap community and two singers from the GnosisDAO community should be selected to participate in the multisig wallet.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Gnosis Chain is preparing for substantial growth in the coming year. We have implemented an aggressive infrastructure grants program including large grants to Nethermind, Lighthouse and Erigon client teams to support base-layer functionality and security. The [ecosystem fund](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-16-gnosis-chain-xdai-gnosis-merge/1904) will bring in many new projects, and we feel Uniswap v3 is an essential component that will serve as a foundational layer for this growth.\n\nWe welcome any questions and comments and are happy to provide any clarifications as needed. We are excited to submit this proposal to the Uniswap community and look forward to your feedback! Thank you.",

      "content": "## Description\n\nTo date, Uniswap has four deployments: Ethereum, Abritrum, Optimism, and Polygon. In addition to these deployments, there are proposals to deploy Uniswap on Harmony, Celo, and more chains expected soon. The protocol should continue to deploy to new markets, but as the protocol continues to grow, it is vital the protocol learns to manage each of the deployments. With each new chain, there is new infrastructure that needs to be adapted to so that UNI on Ethereum can govern all of these deployments.\n\nGFX Labs has been researching the various deployments and has prepared the first Uniswap cross-chain proposal to demonstrate how mainnet UNI can manage deployments on other chains.\n\nPolygon has a messaging mechanism between Ethereum and Polygon called the [Fx-Portal](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/l1-l2-communication/fx-portal/). The portal functions via three contracts: FxRoot, State Sender, & FxChild. Messages can be sent from Ethereum to Polygon by calling the sendMessageToChild(address, bytes) at the FxRoot contract on Ethereum, which calls the State Sender contract. The [validators](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/validate/polygon-basics/who-is-validator/) monitor the State Sender contract and relay messages to the FxChild on Polygon. Upon successful relay to the FxChild, the message is executed on Polygon by the validators.\n\nThe owner of the Uniswap v3 contracts on Polygon is the [Ethereum Proxy contract](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8a1b966ac46f42275860f905dbc75efbfdc12374#code). The proxy contract will only process transactions that originate from the [Timelock contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc#code) on Ethereum and are delivered by the [FxChild](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8397259c983751daf40400790063935a11afa28a). Every governance proposal targeting a change on Polygon should set the [FxRoot](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfe5e5d361b2ad62c541bab87c45a0b9b018389a2#code) on Ethereum as the target and send the message (parameter change) via the contract. The message passed through the FxRoot must contain the target(s) contract on Polygon, the function(s) to call, the call data(s), similar to the proposal system.\n\nFor the pilot of cross-chain governance, we are implementing the 1 basis point/1 tick fee tier on Polygon. The 1bp pools on Ethereum have been incredibly successful and increased Uniswap’s market share significantly since GFX Labs’ successful proposal in November 2021.\n\n[![|624x281](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/nkHPN-akEVdPkIr3P7Tya8wvZMBftJryqVfsnwKaSp5mowgmcCq_aYEPkvKdIW8I20tPa6clkSUrCA78yTtebtf6iYfsgqHYt9x1Fg4lZaRhCgkvO2rbszg2wB1aJsWcIxLgHbLU)](https://dune.xyz/queries/150801)\n\nBecause governance has already approved it on Ethereum, the content of this proposal should not be controversial and puts the focus on the research and implementation.\n\n# Proposal\n\nGFX Labs has already tested the governance proposal on Goerli & Mumbai.\n\nTo build the proposal–[Uniswap Governor Alpha](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x5e4be8bc9637f0eaa1a755019e06a68ce081d58f#writeContract): propose()\n\n1.

      "title": "[Consensus Check] Deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam",
      "content": "## Proposal Topic\n\n[Blockchain at Berkeley](https://blockchain.berkeley.edu) is creating this proposal in partnership with [Nomad](https://www.docs.nomad.xyz/) to Deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam.\n\n\n## Process Update\n\nThe [Temperature Check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-deploy-uniswap-v3-on-moonbeam/16572) for this proposal passed with 8.3M UNI voting Yes on the [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/QmaG6nJYW3xLeQwAa6xxhpbuYS8h6PVQpbx1vfqpqxAtik). We now move to the Consensus Check phase to collect further feedback in advance of an on-chain vote.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn support of furthering the vision of [Multichain Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/blog/multichain-uniswap), we propose that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam. We hope this proposal will serve as an example to create a generalizable, trust-minimized approach to cross-chain deployments, with the goal of supporting a multichain Uniswap ecosystem.\n\nMoonbeam is a Polkadot parachain which features EVM-compatibility, allowing it to serve as a port-of-entry for Ethereum-native apps to participate in the greater Polkadot ecosystem. Deploying on Moonbeam will expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Polkadot ecosystem, helping Uniswap on its journey to become a leading product in the multichain world.\n\nMoonbeam is a reputable chain which has enjoyed high stability and considerable activity since its launch in January, making it a great fit for Uniswap’s trusted brand.\n\n## About Moonbeam\n\nMoonbeam is an EVM-compatible smart contract parachain of the Polkadot network; it is optimized for cross-chain use cases and natively interoperable applications. EVM compatibility and a comprehensive tool suite of integrations like Etherscan, The Graph, Chainlink, and more, allow developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and apps to Moonbeam with minimal changes. Moonbeam also extends the EVM with native cross-chain integrations powered by [Polkadot’s XCM](https://polkadot.network/blog/xcm-the-cross-consensus-message-format/), allowing Moonbeam apps to interact with assets and services from other chains in the Polkadot ecosystem in a trust-minimized way.\n\nMoonbeam was the first parachain to go live on the Polkadot network, launching on January 11 this year. Like Moonriver, its sister parachain on Kusama, Moonbeam is expected to accumulate developer and user activity from the [100+ projects](https://moonbeam.network/community/projects/) building DApps and protocols on the network.\n\n## Expanding Uniswap to Moonbeam\n\nWe believe that the timing is perfect for Uniswap V3 to deploy on Moonbeam. \n\nUniswap has been deployed on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism, giving it great coverage within Ethereum and its most popular L2s. However, Uniswap has not yet expanded beyond the greater Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nUnlike the other deployment targets, Moonbeam represents a much larger target market — Polkadot users. The growth potential of the Polkadot ecosystem is reflected in part by the fact that Polkadot consistently ranks in the top ecosystems for developer activity, despite having just enabled parachains auctions in December 2021. The Polkadot community has grown in parallel with the Ethereum community, and shares many of the same values — decentralization, censorship resistance, open access to finance, to name a few. However, the two communities have largely been discrete, and deploying Uniswap on Moonbeam brings them together in a meaningful way.\n\nMoonbeam is the de facto DeFi hub for Polkadot. Blue chip DeFi projects have deployed or committed to deploying to Moonbeam, including Sushiswap, Lido, Curve, Chainlink and Covalent. As the ecosystem develops, we believe that deploying Uniswap V3 will position it to become a premier AMM on Moonbeam, and, more broadly, a large liquidity hub for the entire Polkadot ecosystem. This represents a massive opportunity to capture this untapped market, which could mean significant fee revenue for LPs and UNI token holders.\n\nThe Nomad team has worked on this proposal because [Nomad and Connext](https://medium.com/connext/connext-has-partnered-with-nomad-e20cd8e62e31) have already been deployed as Moonbeam’s main bridging solutions, and have begun to drive cross-chain liquidity from Ethereum into Moonbeam. By deploying Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam, Nomad would be able to route even more liquidity into Uniswap pools and additionally facilitate cross-chain communication for Uniswap governance.\n\n## Trust-Minimized Bridging and Cross-Chain Governance\n\nDecentralized cross-chain governance is a topic we are excited about working on within the Uniswap ecosystem. As Uniswap Labs highlighted in their post about [Multichain Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/blog/multichain-uniswap), it is important that new chains have a trust-minimized arbitrary message passing solution to facilitate secure, decentralized governance of a deployment of Uniswap. The Moonbeam community already uses [Nomad](https://docs.nomad.xyz/) and [Connext](https://www.connext.network/) to bridge ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum; despite Moonbeam having only been live for two months, $35M TVL is currently bridged to Moonbeam via Nomad, with over $250M in total volume since deployment. However, Nomad is more than just a protocol for token bridging; at its core, Nomad is a protocol for trust-minimized arbitrary message passing, and Uniswap V3 deployed on Moonbeam can leverage Nomad for governance.\n\nWe have worked with developers at Uniswap Labs to research, understand, and document the current state of [cross-chain governance for Uniswap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CQWXCXdA5to7RKfVPozI8vEcw_QJrRQMP9HiQ8nbOu0/edit#heading=h.708hyjg41wlu) deployments. It became clear that, currently, cross-chain governance solutions have been patched together differently for all three of the chains that Uniswap is deployed on, leading to significant complexity and overhead for governance participants who wish to execute proposals governing deployments on other chains. This problem will multiply as Uniswap is deployed to more chains.\n\nNomad can provide an out-of-the-box solution for this problem. Nomad’s own contracts are governed by a decentralized cross-chain [governance app](https://github.com/nomad-xyz/monorepo/blob/main/packages/contracts-core/contracts/governance/GovernanceRouter.sol) built on its arbitrary message passing rails. This application can be [tailored](https://github.com/nomad-xyz/monorepo/pull/95) for the purpose of governing Uniswap deployments on chains other than Ethereum mainnet. Rather than attempting to introduce this change on all chains at once, however, we can demonstrate the value of this solution in a de-risked manner by leveraging it first for a new deployment, Moonbeam.\n\n\n## Rewards and Grants\n\nAs part of this proposal, Nomad, via a grant from the Moonbeam Foundation, will commit $2,500,000 to the Uniswap Grants Program to help grow the Multichain Uniswap ecosystem.\n\nThrough collaborative discussions with members of the Uniswap community, we learned that there were likely higher-leverage ways to enrich the Uniswap community than just providing liquidity mining rewards. As Uniswap develops into a multi-chain ecosystem, we want to support developers working to create high-quality multichain apps building on-top of Uniswap, and better multichain experiences for Uniswap users. These grants will promote long-term protocol development, developer activity and innovation towards this goal.\n\nTo borrow language from the [Uniswap Grants + Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/blog/case-study-uniswap-grants/#:~:text=Uniswap%20Grants%20gained%20access%20to,Gitcoin%20was%20founded%20in%202017) announcement, we hope for this initiative to fund “bounties, hackathons, and grants” for “developers, designers, community organizers and other web3 builders” working on multi-chain projects which improve, extend, promote or build upon Unsiwap in a cross-chain manner.\n\n\nExamples of projects that could be funded with this grant include: \n- Building a cross-chain application which allows Uniswap LPs to close a position on Ethereum and open one atomically on Moonbeam\n- Improving open-source wallet softwares to create better multi-chain user experiences for Uniswap users\n- Building a frontend application which allows governance participants to more easily construct cross-chain governance proposals for Uniswap\n- Leveraging Substrate’s native interoperability protocol, XCM, to build an application which composes Uniswap on Moonbeam with another substrate chain\nFunding office hours to educate new users about multichain crypto experiences\n\nWe are so excited to see what members of the Uniswap community come up with to leverage this grant!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe are excited about the possibility of the Uniswap community entering the Polkadot ecosystem via a V3 deployment on Moonbeam. To reiterate, we feel that this is a fantastic opportunity for the following reasons:\n\n- **Expansion into Polkadot**: Uniswap will be able to tap into a brand new market and all the community members in the Polkadot ecosystem. Moonbeam’s EVM-compatibility makes it simple to deploy existing Solidity code, while simultaneously providing access to other parachains using XCM. By leveraging XCM and Moonbeam’s position as the DeFi hub for Polkadot, Uniswap has the opportunity to become the premier AMM across Polkadot. \n- **Trust-minimized Governance**: Per Uniswap’s goal of becoming a multi-chain protocol while remaining trust-minimized, we propose using Nomad’s trust-minimized channels to deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam. This can serve as an opportunity to test this improved decentralized governance application within a safe container, with the potential of rolling it out to other V3 deployments in the future.\n- **Rewards for Uniswap Grants Program**: Instead of simply offering liquidity mining incentives, we want to fund community members working to develop and enrich multichain experiences built with Uniswap. We will commit $2.5M to the Uniswap Grants Program to fund cross-chain development deployed within the Uniswap ecosystem, in order to further expand Uniswap’s multi-chain presence.\n\nWe are excited to engage with the Uniswap community and governance process to discuss more around bringing Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam. Please let us know any and all feedback and criticism, so that we can improve this proposal and expand Uniswap into Moonbeam and Polkadot!",

      "content": "## Proposal Discussion Topic\n\n[Blockchain at Berkeley](https://blockchain.berkeley.edu) is creating this proposal in partnership with [Nomad](https://www.docs.nomad.xyz/) to Deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn support of furthering the vision of [Multichain Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/blog/multichain-uniswap), we propose that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap V3 to Moonbeam. We hope this proposal will serve as an example to create a generalizable, trust-minimized approach to cross-chain deployments, with the goal of supporting a multichain Uniswap ecosystem.\n\nMoonbeam is a Polkadot parachain which features EVM-compatibility, allowing it to serve as a port-of-entry for Ethereum-native apps to participate in the greater Polkadot ecosystem. Deploying on Moonbeam will expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Polkadot ecosystem, helping Uniswap on its journey to become a leading product in the multichain world.\n\nMoonbeam is a reputable chain which has enjoyed high stability and considerable activity since its launch in January, making it a great fit for Uniswap’s trusted brand.\n\n## About Moonbeam\n\nMoonbeam is an EVM-compatible smart contract parachain of the Polkadot network; it is optimized for cross-chain use cases and natively interoperable applications. EVM compatibility and a comprehensive tool suite of integrations like Etherscan, The Graph, Chainlink, and more, allow developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and apps to Moonbeam with minimal changes. Moonbeam also extends the EVM with native cross-chain integrations powered by [Polkadot’s XCM](https://polkadot.network/blog/xcm-the-cross-consensus-message-format/), allowing Moonbeam apps to interact with assets and services from other chains in the Polkadot ecosystem in a trust-minimized way.\n\nMoonbeam was the first parachain to go live on the Polkadot network, launching on January 11 this year. Like Moonriver, its sister parachain on Kusama, Moonbeam is expected to accumulate developer and user activity from the [100+ projects](https://moonbeam.network/community/projects/) building DApps and protocols on the network.\n\n## Expanding Uniswap to Moonbeam\n\nWe believe that the timing is perfect for Uniswap V3 to deploy on Moonbeam. \n\nUniswap has been deployed on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism, giving it great coverage within Ethereum and its most popular L2s.

      "content": "## **Summary**\n- Nomic Labs, the team behind Hardhat, has become the Nomic Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to Ethereum. Our mission is to empower developers to decentralize the world.\n- The Nomic Foundation’s work will be focused on Ethereum’s developer platform with the objective of achieving a world-class developer experience, and generally improving Ethereum’s public goods support structures.\n- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is the de facto standard developer tool used to build Ethereum software, with more than 23000 Github repositories using it and tens of thousands of active users. Prominent teams relying on it include ENS, Uniswap, Optimism, OpenZeppelin, Aave, Balancer, Chainlink, Synthetix, and many more leading teams.\n- The new foundation will expand the Hardhat suite of tools and, most importantly, build long-term infrastructure to catalyze organic growth in the Ethereum tooling ecosystem, decreasing Ethereum’s dependence on any one organization to build and maintain core development platform components.\n- Seeking $30m in total funding from the ecosystem. Donations of $15M already secured by the Ethereum Foundation, Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, a16z, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, a16z, and Kaszek Ventures.\n- **We’re proposing to Uniswap Governance to make a contribution of $5m to the Nomic Foundation to support its mission.**\n\n## **Funding**\nThe Nomic Foundation aims to benefit the entire Ethereum ecosystem, which is why we’re fundraising across multiple organizations and individuals within it.\nThe Ethereum Foundation is leading this round of contributions with $8M, alongside contributions from Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, Consensys, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, Gnosis, a16z, a_capital, and Kaszek Ventures. These donors make up $15M, and we’re aiming to raise $15M more.\n\n## **Why Uniswap?**\nGenerally, we think that allocating capital to the Nomic Foundation makes strategic sense for any protocol treasury that is aligned long term with the growth of Ethereum, and we’ve approached and will continue approaching several protocols. Currently, [Uniswap is built using Hardhat](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts). While this is a signal of Hardhat’s value, the projects that the Nomic Foundation will deliver will create more value not just for Uniswap, but for the entire ecosystem. We’ll provide services to the Ethereum community that will:\n\n1. Continue the maintenance of critical infrastructure used to build most protocols (Hardhat).\n2. Increase developer productivity for every team in the ecosystem.\n3. Accelerate developer onboarding to Ethereum, increasing the size of the experienced engineering hiring pool and making time-to-productivity shorter for new hires.\n4. Accelerate the pace of innovation and the number of products being built.\n5. Increase market volume driven by new users and new products.\n\nWe believe this grows the market for everyone, including Uniswap, and we’d love to have the Uniswap DAO contribute $5m in funding to this community effort .\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "## **Summary**\n\n* Nomic Labs, the team behind Hardhat, has become the Nomic Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to Ethereum. Our mission is to empower developers to decentralize the world.\n* The Nomic Foundation’s work will be focused on Ethereum’s developer platform with the objective of achieving a world-class developer experience, and generally improving Ethereum’s public goods support structures.\n* [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is the de facto standard developer tool used to build Ethereum software, with more than 23000 Github repositories using it and tens of thousands of active users. Prominent teams relying on it include ENS, Uniswap, Optimism, OpenZeppelin, Aave, Balancer, Chainlink, Synthetix, and many more leading teams.\n* The new foundation will expand the Hardhat suite of tools and, most importantly, build long-term infrastructure to catalyze organic growth in the Ethereum tooling ecosystem, decreasing Ethereum’s dependence on any one organization to build and maintain core development platform components.\n* Seeking $30m in total funding from the ecosystem. Donations of $15M already secured by the Ethereum Foundation, Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, a16z, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, a16z, and Kaszek Ventures.\n* **We’re proposing to Uniswap Governance to make a contribution of $5m to the Nomic Foundation to support its mission.**\n\n## **Funding**\n\nThe Nomic Foundation aims to benefit the entire Ethereum ecosystem, which is why we’re fundraising across multiple organizations and individuals within it.\nThe Ethereum Foundation is leading this round of contributions with $8M, alongside contributions from Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, Consensys, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, Gnosis, a16z, a_capital, and Kaszek Ventures. These donors make up $15M, and we’re aiming to raise $15M more.\n\n## **Why Uniswap?**\n\nGenerally, we think that allocating capital to the Nomic Foundation makes strategic sense for any protocol treasury that is aligned long term with the growth of Ethereum, and we’ve approached and will continue approaching several protocols.\nCurrently, Uniswap [is built using Hardhat](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts). While this is a signal of Hardhat’s value, the projects that the Nomic Foundation will deliver will create more value not just for Uniswap, but for the entire ecosystem. We’ll provide services to the Ethereum community that will:\n\n1. Continue the maintenance of critical infrastructure used to build most protocols (Hardhat).\n2. Increase developer productivity for every team in the ecosystem.\n3. Accelerate developer onboarding to Ethereum, increasing the size of the experienced engineering hiring pool and making time-to-productivity shorter for new hires.\n4. Accelerate the pace of innovation and the number of products being built.\n5. Increase market volume driven by new users and new products.\n\nWe believe this grows the market for everyone, including Uniswap, and we’d love to have the **Uniswap DAO contribute $5m in funding to this community effort** .\n",

      "title": "Temperature Check - Should Uniswap v3 be deployed to Gnosis Chain?",
      "content": "\n#### Deploy Uni V3 to Gnosis Chain\n\nIn production since 2018 (as the xDai Chain), the rebranded Gnosis Chain is rapidly evolving with a new focus and mission. Gnosis Chain (GC) provides a real-world value chain that closely mirrors the Ethereum 2.0 ecosystem. This includes a beacon chain framework, rollups, and other vital functionality. GC will serve in a front-running capacity for important Ethereum 2.0 updates,\n\nTuned parameters on the Gnosis Chain enable faster blocks and epochs, low-cost stable transactions, and the opportunity to construct trustless bridges and conduct seamless transfers between GC and the Ethereum 2.0 mainnet.\n\nThe Gnosis Chain team is committed to ecosystem development, adoption, and growth as the Eth2.0 landscape comes into focus. With a mission to “accelerate Ethereum,” Gnosis Chain is poised for expansion. With this in mind, we propose a Uniswap v3 deployment to the Gnosis Chain. We believe there are many benefits for both Uniswap Labs and Uniswap users, some of which include:\n\n1. **A DeFi ecosystem primed for growth.** Once deployed, Uniswap would become a cornerstone DeFi engine for protocols using and interacting within the ecosystem. Perpetual Protocol is a flagship protocol on GC that relies on Uniswap v3. This deployment will enable Perpetual to continue to flourish on the Gnosis Chain. Additional bluechip deployments with growing TVL include Curve, Sushiswap, and Tornado, with many new and promising DeFi projects choosing Gnosis Chain as their homebase. A list of current projects is available at https://gnosischain.world/\n\n\n2. **An iterative environment.** Uniswap Labs can experiment with new functionality and front-run new features in a real-value environment (which differs from a test environment in that users behave differently with value on the line, token supply is limited, real adversaries exist, etc). Uniswap can spot and remediate any final potential issues stemming from important Ethereum updates prior to mainnet activation and take advantage of optimized slot and epoch times for faster iteration.\n\n\n3. **Tight Ethereum compatibility.** Tools, resources, projects, and protocols supported by Ethereum are already supported by the Gnosis Chain, with more onboarding regularly. Gnosis Safe is facilitating daily operations for many existing projects. A trustless bridge architecture designed to connect Ethereum and Gnosis Chain is in the works. The Gnosis Beacon Chain validator set is expanding rapidly bringing massive decentralization to the chain.\n\nThe primary differences separating the GBC from the Ethereum Beacon chain include 5-second blocks and < 2-minute epochs, stable transactions with a max target of $.01 per 100K gas, an economically and geographically diverse validator set, and a lower-stakes, lower-TVL environment.\n\n\nUnique chain characteristics. Stable, low-cost transactions provide unique opportunities for Uniswap users. When gas costs are known and have a low impact on trade decisions, new strategies and approaches emerge which are currently untenable on the Ethereum mainnet or other chains with wide-ranging fee variability.\n\n\nUser incentives. A large directive for the Gnosis Chain is to increase the user base and on-chain activity by strategically allocating funds from the GnosisDAO treasury to promote adoption. An ecosystem fund has been created for this purpose, and we propose to use a portion of these funds to promote Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain.  We propose providing up to $10M for a tailored liquidity mining program.\nThe Gnosis Chain is preparing for substantial growth in the coming year. We have implemented an aggressive infrastructure grants program including large grants to Nethermind, Lighthouse and Erigon client teams to support base-layer functionality and security. The ecosystem fund will bring in many new projects, and we feel Uniswap v3 is an essential component that will serve as a foundational layer for this growth. \n\nWe welcome any questions and comments and are happy to provide any clarifications as needed. We are excited to submit this proposal to the Uniswap community and look forward to your feedback! Thank you.\n",

      "title": "Governance Proposal - Should Uniswap governance contribute funding to the Nomic Foundation?",
      "content": "## **Summary**\n* Nomic Labs, the team behind Hardhat, has become the Nomic Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to Ethereum. Our mission is to empower developers to decentralize the world.\n* The Nomic Foundation’s work will be focused on Ethereum’s developer platform with the objective of achieving a world-class developer experience, and generally improving Ethereum’s public goods support structures.\n* [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is the de facto standard developer tool used to build Ethereum software, with more than 23000 Github repositories using it and tens of thousands of active users. Prominent teams relying on it include ENS, Uniswap, Optimism, OpenZeppelin, Aave, Balancer, Chainlink, Synthetix, and many more leading teams.\n* The new foundation will expand the Hardhat suite of tools and, most importantly, build long-term infrastructure to catalyze organic growth in the Ethereum tooling ecosystem, decreasing Ethereum’s dependence on any one organization to build and maintain core development platform components.\n* Seeking $30m in total funding from the ecosystem. Donations of $15M already secured by the Ethereum Foundation, Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, a16z, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, a16z, and Kaszek Ventures.\n* **We’re proposing to Uniswap Governance to make a contribution of $5m to the Nomic Foundation to support its mission.**\n\n## **Funding**\nThe Nomic Foundation aims to benefit the entire Ethereum ecosystem, which is why we’re fundraising across multiple organizations and individuals within it.\nThe Ethereum Foundation is leading this round of contributions with $8M, alongside contributions from Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, Consensys, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, Gnosis, a16z, a_capital, and Kaszek Ventures. These donors make up $15M, and we’re aiming to raise $15M more.\n\n## **Why Uniswap?**\nGenerally, we think that allocating capital to the Nomic Foundation makes strategic sense for any protocol treasury that is aligned long term with the growth of Ethereum, and we’ve approached and will continue approaching several protocols.\nCurrently, Uniswap [is built using Hardhat](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts). While this is a signal of Hardhat’s value, the projects that the Nomic Foundation will deliver will create more value not just for Uniswap, but for the entire ecosystem. We’ll provide services to the Ethereum community that will:\n1. Continue the maintenance of critical infrastructure used to build most protocols (Hardhat).\n2. Increase developer productivity for every team in the ecosystem.\n3. Accelerate developer onboarding to Ethereum, increasing the size of the experienced engineering hiring pool and making time-to-productivity shorter for new hires.\n4. Accelerate the pace of innovation and the number of products being built.\n5. Increase market volume driven by new users and new products.\n\nWe believe this grows the market for everyone, including Uniswap, and we’d love to have the **Uniswap DAO contribute $5m in funding to this community effort** .",

      "title": "[Consensus Check] Should we deploy Uniswap V3 on Celo?",
      "content": "### Summary:\n\nDear Uniswap community,\n\nAbout a week ago we (the Blockchain at Michigan in partnership with the [Celo Foundation](https://celo.org/) and the [Celo Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/)) submitted a proposal to deploy Uniswap V3 on Celo to launch “Green Asset” Liquidity Pools and expand access to Uniswap to the 6B smartphone users around the world.\n\nWe initiated the [Temperature Check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x4fdc5d5c87669d3c99072541e1c775f8dee9b906241b2ce22203737b608c8e55) on Snapshot, where the proposal received strong support from the Uniswap community. 12M UNI (~100%) voted yes for the proposal.\n\nWe’re excited to initiate the Consensus Check phase. We’d love to receive your support in this proposal.\n\nNOTE: Based on community feedback we’re also adding the following items to provide more information on a few items:\n\n* Approximately one-third of the $10M of financial incentives to Uniswap users for green asset pools will be placed in a multisig with the Celo Foundation and 2-4 key members of the Uniswap community, including both individuals and institutions. This is to serve as a good faith deposit and demonstrate the Celo Foundation’s commitment to the Uniswap community, while also ensuring financial flexibility for the Celo Foundation. In the past, the Celo Foundation has ensured that promised rewards have been paid out (e.g. Sushi) and the plan is to continue doing so.\n* Uniswap V3 will be deployed on Celo by the Celo community through the “[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script](https://github.com/Uniswap/deploy-v3#deploy-uniswap-v3-script).” contingent upon approval by the Uniswap community via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth).\n* Governance at deployment will be facilitated by messaging bridge [Optics](https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/optics)\n* Robert Leifke and Kyle Scott, members of Blockchain at Michigan, are co-founders of Mobius, a Celo stableswap protocol. To avoid any conflicts of interest, they have had no involvement in this partnership between Blockchain at Michigan and the Celo Foundation.\n\n[Temperature check discussion](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-uniswap-x-celo-green-pool-for-treasury-proposal/16428/4)\n\n### Updated Proposal discussion Topic:\n\nDeploy Uniswap V3 on Celo to Launch “Green Asset” Liquidity Pools and expand access to Uniswap to the 6B smartphone users around the world\n\n### Description:\n\nIn partnership with the Celo Foundation and the [Celo Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/), we propose to authorize the deployment of the Uniswap protocol to Celo on behalf of the community.\n\nCelo is a mobile-first, carbon-negative, EVM-compatible blockchain. Specifically, we propose launching Uniswap on the Celo platform to:\n\n* Increase Uniswap’s influence through $10M in financial incentives to Uniswap users, as well as additional grant funding provided by the Celo Foundation to utilize Uniswap as a financial building block\n* Bring Uniswap V3’s increased capital efficiency to the 6B smartphone users around the world\n* Create green asset liquidity pools with natural capital backed assets such as tokenized carbon credits (e.g. MCO2 and TCO2) and future nature backed assets issued on Celo like land and forests\n* Use Uniswap as a decentralized mechanism to rebalance the Celo Reserve with nature backed assets rather than relying on centralized exchanges\n* Foster pathways for future green use cases on Uniswap\n\nOverall, we believe the Uniswap community’s mission of creating a trustless and decentralized financial infrastructure accessible to anyone aligns with Celo’s vision of tackling climate change and achieving prosperity for all.\n\n### About Celo:\n\nCelo’s mission is to build an open financial system that creates the conditions of prosperity for all. To execute this mission, Celo’s technology features include:\n\n* A mobile-first EVM-compatible layer 1 blockchain that is accessible to anyone with a smartphone\n* Carbon negative by allocating 0.1% of epoch rewards to offset carbon—to date, [2,942](https://www.wren.co/profile/celo) tons of carbon has been offset, [which is over 8 times Celo’s carbon footprint](https://medium.com/celoorg/a-carbon-negative-blockchain-its-here-and-it-s-celo-60228de36490)\n* Algorithmic Celo stablecoins (currently cUSD, cEUR, and cREAL) with a smart-contract based expansion and contraction platform called Mento\n* An overcollateralized basket of crypto assets called the [Celo reserve](https://celoreserve.org/), currently made up of CELO, the network’s native asset, as well as BTC, ETH, DAI, and MCO2\n\nCelo is one of the fastest growing DeFi ecosystems with 2.6[M addresses, up to 1.1M daily transactions, and over 103M transactions](https://thecelo.com/). Additionally, Celo [has been chosen by Kickstarter](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/08/kickstarter-to-start-blockchain-based-crowdfunding-project-report/) for its upcoming decentralized product (to date, Kickstarter has successfully supported over[ 214,000 projects with over $6B in funding and 20M backers](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats)) which will attract new users to the ecosystem\n\nThe Celo Reserve includes almost $1M of MCO2 tokens, and Celo community members have proposed to add more natural capital assets moving forward as part of the [Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/). By including more natural capital assets, the Celo community has the vision of creating natural capital backed currencies. If, as a society, we were to denominate our economic activity in natural capital backed currencies, any economic growth—increase in money circulation—would lead to a growth in preserved natural resources. Celo aims to be the layer 1 blockchain for natural capital assets, and Uniswap can be the natural capital DEX for these assets on Celo.\n\n### Proposal\n\nBlockchain technology can help address limit greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable practices by tokenizing carbon-sequestering assets such as rainforests. Those tokenized assets can then be purchased by individuals and businesses to democratize carbon offsetting and increase funding for environmental protection projects. We believe that together, Uniswap and Celo can lead the path to growing natural capital assets.\n\nUniswap on the Celo platform will:\n\n* Allow for the launch of green asset liquidity pools: With the launch of the [Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/), Celo community members proposed to allocate up to 40% of the reserve over time towards natural capital backed assets. A natural capital backed asset (also known as “green” or “regenerative finance” asset) is a tokenized representation of natural assets in the “real” world. An example of a green asset is a non-fungible carbon-negative initiative quantified in terms of fungible CO2 sequestered (e.g. tokenized carbon credits).\n* Advance the use of natural capital backed currencies: The Celo Reserve grows as demand for Celo stable currencies grows. And as the reserve grows, so does the allocation towards green assets. This creates a feedback mechanism: with increased adoption of Celo stable currencies the reserve programmatically generates demand for additional green assets, preserving rainforests, and other carbon-sequestering assets.\n* Use Uniswap as a decentralized mechanism to rebalance the reserve: The Celo reserve will not only need to rebalance its BTC, ETH, etc. holdings but also a variety of natural capital backed assets, such as tokenized land, forests, and carbon credits. If approved by Celo’s community governance, a 40% allocation at current reserve values would correspond to natural capital assets worth 200M USD held by the reserve alone, requiring an efficient and liquid trading counterpart. Currently, the reserve rebalances via centralized exchanges. Green assets are not held by centralized exchanges, and so a decentralized exchange is needed in order to rebalance the Celo reserve as demand for stable currencies increases.\n* Increase capital efficiency: Uniswap v3’s concentrated liquidity mechanism will be especially important for Celo’s stablecoins that trade within a small price range.\n* Create pathways for future green use cases: Market participants are actively exploring other use cases on Celo. A list of current projects is available on https://climatecollective.org/.\n\nThe Celo Foundation will commit $10M of CELO in Uniswap-specific user incentives & grants on Celo. The Celo Foundation has successfully delivered committed rewards in the past (e.g. Sushi) and intends to do so in this instance as well. As a good faith deposit, approximately one-third of the $10M of financial incentives to Uniswap users for green asset pools will be placed in a multisig with the Celo Foundation and 2-4 key members of the Uniswap community, including both individuals and institutions. The $10M of financial incentives to Uniswap users for green asset pools will be placed in a multisig with the Celo Foundation and 2-4 key and active members of the Uniswap community including both individuals and institutions. In addition to the $10M in financial incentives for Uniswap specifically, the Celo Foundation will also focus on broader adoption of natural capital backed currencies and link this to ongoing efforts to making DeFi and crypto more accessible to the 6B smartphone users around the world through the following:\n\n* Promote the development of a mobile-first ecosystem through developer programs such as hackathons with Uniswap as a financial building block\n\n* Lead pilots and users research to help make Uniswap more accessible, especially in markets that lack access to basic financial tools and services.\n* Co-grant program to support projects that are launching and driving the growth of “green assets”\n\nUniswap V3 will be deployed on Celo by cLabs through the “[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script](https://github.com/Uniswap/deploy-v3#deploy-uniswap-v3-script).” contingent upon approval by the Uniswap community via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth). Governance at deployment will be facilitated by the messaging bridge [Optics](https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/optics).\n\nWe propose a transparent measurement of this project's success through the following success criteria and long-term goals:\n\n* % of Celo Reserve allocated to green assets: 40% of the Celo Reserve (at current Celo Reserve levels this would correspond to $200M USD in green assets)\n* $ total TVL and TVL of associated green assets: 10x of Celo Reserve green asset holdings in circulation as LP\n* Impact of green assets in Celo Reserve: 17M tons of CO2 avoided or removed from the atmosphere (assuming an average price of $12 per ton and current Celo Reserve levels) , including all associated benefits (e.g. increase in biodiversity through protection of forests). This corresponds roughly to the annual absorption capacity of 1.7M hectares of forest area, or roughly the amount of [forest area lost in Brazil in 2020](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-research/global-tree-cover-loss-data-2020/).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCelo and Uniswap together can serve as the foundation for the proliferation of natural capital assets across Web3. We believe that the vision to advance climate and regenerative finance on Celo aligns with the Uniswap community. Thank you for your consideration and we welcome questions and suggestions.\n\n[Temperature check discussion](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-uniswap-x-celo-green-pool-for-treasury-proposal/16428/4)\n[Temperature check snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x4fdc5d5c87669d3c99072541e1c775f8dee9b906241b2ce22203737b608c8e55)",

Green assets are not held by centralized exchanges, and so a decentralized exchange is needed in order to rebalance the Celo reserve as demand for stable currencies increases.\n* Increase capital efficiency: Uniswap v3’s concentrated liquidity mechanism will be especially important for Celo’s stablecoins that trade within a small price range.\n* Create pathways for future green use cases: Market participants are actively exploring other use cases on Celo. A list of current projects is available on https://climatecollective.org/.\n\nThe Celo Foundation will commit $10M of CELO in Uniswap-specific user incentives & grants on Celo. In addition to the $10M in financial incentives for Uniswap specifically, the Celo Foundation will also focus on broader adoption of natural capital backed currencies and link this to ongoing efforts to making DeFi and crypto more accessible to the 6B smartphone users around the world through the following:\n\n* Promote the development of a mobile-first ecosystem through developer programs such as hackathons with Uniswap as a financial building block\n\n* Lead pilots and users research to help make Uniswap more accessible, especially in markets that lack access to basic financial tools and services.\n* Co-grant program to support projects that are launching and driving the growth of “green assets”\n\nWe propose a transparent measurement of this project's success through the following success criteria and long-term goals:\n\n* % of Celo Reserve allocated to green assets: 40% of the Celo Reserve (at current Celo Reserve levels this would correspond to $200M USD in green assets)\n* $ total TVL and TVL of associated green assets: 10x of Celo Reserve green asset holdings in circulation as LP\n* Impact of green assets in Celo Reserve: 17M tons of CO2 avoided or removed from the atmosphere (assuming an average price of $12 per ton and current Celo Reserve levels) , including all associated benefits (e.g. increase in biodiversity through protection of forests). This corresponds roughly to the annual absorption capacity of 1.7M hectares of forest area, or roughly the amount of [forest area lost in Brazil in 2020](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-research/global-tree-cover-loss-data-2020/).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCelo and Uniswap together can serve as the foundation for the proliferation of natural capital assets across Web3. We believe that the vision to advance climate and regenerative finance on Celo aligns with the Uniswap community. Thank you for your consideration and we welcome questions and suggestions. ",

      "content": "## **Summary**\n\n* Nomic Labs, the team behind Hardhat, has become the Nomic Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to Ethereum.

Donations of $15M already secured by the Ethereum Foundation, Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, a16z, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, a16z, and Kaszek Ventures.\n* **We’re proposing to Uniswap Governance to make a contribution of $5m to the Nomic Foundation to support its mission.**\n\n## **Nomic Foundation**\n\nNomic Labs has been fully dedicated to Ethereum developer experience since 2019, and we’re [now pivoting](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/introducing-the-nomic-foundation-an-ethereum-public-goods-organization-31012af67df9) to a non-profit foundation formally dedicated to Ethereum. We’re aiming to build a long-lasting organization that makes Ethereum’s public goods support structures stronger by contributing to the Ethereum Foundation’s existing efforts, and reducing the ecosystem’s reliance on any one organization for development platform components.\n\n### **Roadmap**\n\nGiven the size and innovation pace of the ecosystem, there’s no way to foresee exactly what needs developers are going to have as things scale. However, we do know what engineering foundations the ecosystem will need in order to build its own solutions.\n\nOur overarching engineering strategy is to empower the ecosystem to build its own specialized tools. This plan is based on four strategic pillars of the stack, each of which offers an opportunity to leverage a platform to empower the ecosystem to keep building open-source infrastructure.\n\nFor each of these pillars, we will build a platform. The four ecosystem pillars and platform opportunities we’ve identified are:\n\n1. Solidity\n2. EVM tooling\n3. Local development environment\n4. Ethereum connector library\n\n## **The projects**\n\n### **Slang & Rethnet**\n\nOver the long term, these are our most important projects. Targeting the Solidity and EVM tooling pillars, Slang and Rethnet will serve as core infrastructure for the ecosystem to build new tools faster, cheaper, and better. We’re essentially building the tools that would have let us build Hardhat a lot faster. We previously published a [Medium post](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/slang-rethnet-2ad465fd7880) with high-level descriptions of how both projects will complement each other.\n\n**Slang**\n\nA Solidity compiler designed as a platform for tooling development, an approach also known as compiler as a service. Its top priority will be servicing tools through domain-specific APIs. Much like .Net’s Roslyn, it will feature a compilation pipeline made of distinct reusable components with standalone APIs. A completely modular design guarantees that others can build on top of it by replacing the part of functionality they need to, and reusing everything else:\n\n1. Parser that is only concerned with producing trees from code. Usable on its own, for example, to create third-party formatters like Prettier plugins.\n2. Semantic analysis (binding) is concerned only with building a type system and validating the produced trees. Usable on its own, to implement third-party type checking, security/threat models, and more advanced third-party linting.\n3. Code generation. By replacing just this isolated part, the compiler can compile for different targets (e.g. non-EVM L2s).\n4. Language services. These will receive an immutable representation of the above (syntax trees, bound trees, codegen settings), and will only be tasked with answering questions. Usable on its own to expose in different IDEs (same service for VSCode, IntelliJ, Vim, etc). Reusable to extend the functionality of other editor features (task runners, testing, deployment, CI, debugging).\n5. Runtime observation APIs to support Rethnet.\n\nAll of this will be reusable to create entirely new EVM programming languages, since by replacing the parser and type system, one can get an entire high-quality toolchain working from the get-go.\n\n**Rethnet**\n\nTo provide a simulated environment where developers can build and test their Ethereum software, tools need to replicate many of the components that make up a full Ethereum node implementation. This is a significant engineering effort, which given the complexity of Ethereum, represents a barrier to entry to tooling development given the depth of knowledge that is required.\n\nRethnet aims to make this easier by offering a native, flexible, extensible, fast, and language-agnostic EVM local development network, distributed as a Rust library, that is designed to be the underlying core in tools that provide debugging information to developers (like Hardhat, Foundry, Remix, Truffle, DappTools, etc). It will be a Rust library made to be consumed from other languages like TypeScript, Go, Python, etc as a native dependency. It will implement the baseline of essential functionality every tool should have like Solidity console.log, stack traces, and descriptive error messages, as well as implement code coverage, gas profiling, and a step debugger. At its core, it’s an implementation of an Ethereum node with a layer of EVM runtime observation to provide development features.\n\nBuilding a new Hardhat, Truffle, Remix, or DappTools using Rethnet will be a much more manageable project, and Rethnet will be completely reusable for any EVM language through adapters.\n\n### **Hardhat**\n\nOur flagship project targets the local development environment pillar, and it’s currently at an advanced level of progress and adoption. While Slang and Rethnet mature and catalyze organic growth in the tooling space, developers still have needs to be met, positioning Hardhat as our immediate-term solution to empower developers to keep decentralizing the world.\n\nHardhat is an Ethereum development environment that developers use to compile, deploy, test, and debug Ethereum software. Most importantly, it’s highly flexible, extensible, and designed to empower the community to build their own solutions. This strategy has been successful, and there’s already [a valuable ecosystem of reusable plugins](https://hardhat.org/plugins/).\n\nHardhat’s roadmap is focused on becoming an extensible development environment with deep integrations across components in key areas of the tooling stack:\n\n* [Hardhat VSCode](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/hardhat-vscode-9de29467fc26) — programming editor\n* [Hardhat Ignition](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/hardhat-ignition-5a34a4e3d2de) — contract deployment\n* [Hardhat Network](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/) — local development network\n* [Hardhat Runner](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/#overview) — build/testing workflow\n\nThis roadmap leads to developers being well equipped to build powerful extensions to their workflow that increase their productivity according to their exact needs, and to then share them with the ecosystem in the form of plugins.\n\nHardhat will also eventually migrate to using Rethnet and Slang, increasing its feature richness, speed, and stability while enabling dogfooding at scale for our brand new building blocks.\n\n### **Web3.js as a frontend platform**\n\nThe OG Ethereum connector library, Web3.js, is being revitalized into a high-value project. By focusing on community and ecosystem growth, supported by an extensible architecture, it can become a great source of value, much like React represents in the front-end world, but for dapps. A website hub connecting community spaces, support spaces, educational resources, extensions, and related projects, combined with an active ecodev effort (workshops, talks, contests, and incentives), will create a source of leverage for the ecosystem. This will provide better troubleshooting, faster developer training, more reusable code, and, most importantly, the possibility of extending the library. This effort is currently spearheaded by the ChainSafe team.\n\n## **Funding**\n\nThe Nomic Foundation aims to benefit the entire Ethereum ecosystem, which is why we’re fundraising across multiple organizations and individuals within it.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation is leading this round of contributions with $8M, alongside contributions from Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, Consensys, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, Gnosis, a16z, a_capital, and Kaszek Ventures. These donors make up $15M, and we’re aiming to raise $15M more.\n\n## **Why Uniswap?**\n\nGenerally, we think that allocating capital to the Nomic Foundation makes strategic sense for any protocol treasury that is aligned long term with the growth of Ethereum, and we’ve approached and will continue approaching several protocols.\n\nCurrently, Uniswap [is built using Hardhat](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts). While this is a signal of Hardhat’s value, the projects that the Nomic Foundation will deliver will create more value not just for Uniswap, but for the entire ecosystem. We’ll provide services to the Ethereum community that will:\n\n1. Continue the maintenance of critical infrastructure used to build most protocols (Hardhat).\n2. Increase developer productivity for every team in the ecosystem.\n3. Accelerate developer onboarding to Ethereum, increasing the size of the experienced engineering hiring pool and making time-to-productivity shorter for new hires.\n4. Accelerate the pace of innovation and the number of products being built.\n5. Increase market volume driven by new users and new products.\n\nWe believe this grows the market for everyone, including Uniswap, and we’d love to have the **Uniswap DAO contribute $5m in funding to this community effort** .",

This is achieved through a variety of mechanisms, including the use of concentrated liquidity pioneered in Uniswap v3. However, since Uniswap v3 is subject to a Business Source License, Voltz is requesting an “Additional Use Grant” that would allow Voltz to use aspects of the v3 code within its codebase.\n\nGiven the significant R&D that went into v3, Voltz is offering 1% of Voltz future tokens alongside a number of non-financial benefits.\n\nBeyond the financial benefit for Uniswap token holders, if approved, this will also represent a first for DeFi and set precedent for future Additional Use Grant requests.\n\n## On-chain voting\nWe are now initiating the 3rd and final governance vote. \n\nSince license changes must be executed via the [ENS](https://ens.domains/) domain uniswap.eth (controlled by Uniswap Governance), the governance can link arbitrary text with any subdomain of the form: X.uniswap.eth. The details of how this is done can be found in the following repo (under the Licensing section), the full simulation of the proposal is done in [here](https://github.com/Voltz-Protocol/uniswap_proposal_simulation).\n\nIf passed, Voltz will be provided with an Additional Use Grant as per the terms of the Business Source License. 1% of Voltz Tokens will be provided to Uniswap Treasury following the Voltz Token Generation Event.\n\n## Details\n\n```\nENS_REGISTRY_ADDRESS.setSubnodeRecord(\n0xec9ec573cf97ad1c270be71ac1de3b382790cb346036130c7d7ff844bf8f4974, 0x15ff9b5bd7642701a10e5ea8fb29c957ffda4854cd028e9f6218506e6b509af2, 0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc, 0x4976fb03c32e5b8cfe2b6ccb31c09ba78ebaba41, \n0)\n\n```\nwhere\n```\nnode=\"0xec9ec573cf97ad1c270be71ac1de3b382790cb346036130c7d7ff844bf8f4974\"=namehash(\"uniswap.eth\")\n```\n\nand\n\n```\nlabel=\"0x15ff9b5bd7642701a10e5ea8fb29c957ffda4854cd028e9f6218506e6b509af2\"=keccak256(utils.toUtf8Bytes(\"v3-core-license-grants\"))\n```\n\n```\nPUBLIC_ENS_RESOLVER_ADDRESS.setText(\n0xa35d592ec6e5289a387cba1d5f82be794f495bd5a361a1fb314687c6aefea1f4,\n“Voltz Uni v3 Additional Use Grant”,\n\"Voltz Labs Technology Limited (“Voltz”) is granted an additional use grant to allow the Voltz DAO to use the Uniswap V3 Core software code (which is made available to Voltz subject to license available at https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/LICENSE (the “Uniswap Code”)).

Ecosystem growth requires more developers to build more software on top of Ethereum. Developer adoption and learning speed, core contributors to this growth, are critically affected by developer experience.\n\nThe rate at which the ecosystem innovates, coming up with new creations and solving difficult problems, both at the dapp layer and EVM/Solidity/Vyper layer, is also directly affected by developer productivity.\n\nSoftware development platforms aren't new, and playbooks established by the great developer experience success stories (Rust, .Net, TypeScript, etc) prove that achieving a quality developer experience requires a specialized approach paired with a long-term, big-picture strategy. The potential impact in executing a dedicated effort for Ethereum would increase the ecosystem’s pace of innovation and growth, building a powerful compounding effect over the long term for the entire industry.\n\nThe inspiration for our vision came from our experience building Hardhat, which allowed us to see how deeply challenging it is to build sophisticated Ethereum tooling. **These challenges must be alleviated to bring about organic ecosystem-led improvement of developer experience that achieves world-class quality.**\n\n## **Nomic Foundation**\n\nNomic Labs has been fully dedicated to Ethereum developer experience since 2019, and we're [now pivoting](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/introducing-the-nomic-foundation-an-ethereum-public-goods-organization-31012af67df9) to a non-profit foundation formally dedicated to Ethereum. We're aiming to build a long-lasting organization that makes Ethereum's public goods support structures stronger by contributing to the Ethereum Foundation's existing efforts, and reducing the ecosystem's reliance on any one organization for development platform components.\n\n### **Roadmap**\n\nGiven the size and innovation pace of the ecosystem, there's no way to foresee exactly what needs developers are going to have as things scale. However, we do know what engineering foundations the ecosystem will need in order to build its own solutions.\n\nOur overarching engineering strategy is to empower the ecosystem to build its own specialized tools. This plan is based on four strategic pillars of the stack, each of which offers an opportunity to leverage a platform to empower the ecosystem to keep building open-source infrastructure.\n\nFor each of these pillars, we will build a platform. The four ecosystem pillars and platform opportunities we've identified are:\n\n1. Solidity\n2. EVM tooling\n3. Local development environment\n4. Ethereum connector library\n\n## **The projects**\n\n### **Slang & Rethnet**\n\nOver the long term, these are our most important projects. Targeting the Solidity and EVM tooling pillars, Slang and Rethnet will serve as core infrastructure for the ecosystem to build new tools faster, cheaper, and better. We're essentially building the tools that would have let us build Hardhat a lot faster. We previously published a [Medium post](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/slang-rethnet-2ad465fd7880) with high-level descriptions of how both projects will complement each other.\n\n**Slang**\n\nA Solidity compiler designed as a platform for tooling development, an approach also known as compiler as a service. Its top priority will be servicing tools through domain-specific APIs. Much like .Net's Roslyn, it will feature a compilation pipeline made of distinct reusable components with standalone APIs. A completely modular design guarantees that others can build on top of it by replacing the part of functionality they need to, and reusing everything else:\n\n1. Parser that is only concerned with producing trees from code. Usable on its own, for example, to create third-party formatters like Prettier plugins.\n2. Semantic analysis (binding) is concerned only with building a type system and validating the produced trees. Usable on its own, to implement third-party type checking, security/threat models, and more advanced third-party linting.\n3. Code generation. By replacing just this isolated part, the compiler can compile for different targets (e.g. non-EVM L2s).\n4. Language services. These will receive an immutable representation of the above (syntax trees, bound trees, codegen settings), and will only be tasked with answering questions. Usable on its own to expose in different IDEs (same service for VSCode, IntelliJ, Vim, etc). Reusable to extend the functionality of other editor features (task runners, testing, deployment, CI, debugging).\n5. Runtime observation APIs to support Rethnet.\n\nAll of this will be reusable to create entirely new EVM programming languages, since by replacing the parser and type system, one can get an entire high-quality toolchain working from the get-go.\n\n**Rethnet**\n\nTo provide a simulated environment where developers can build and test their Ethereum software, tools need to replicate many of the components that make up a full Ethereum node implementation. This is a significant engineering effort, which given the complexity of Ethereum, represents a barrier to entry to tooling development given the depth of knowledge that is required.\n\nRethnet aims to make this easier by offering a native, flexible, extensible, fast, and language-agnostic EVM local development network, distributed as a Rust library, that is designed to be the underlying core in tools that provide debugging information to developers (like Hardhat, Foundry, Remix, Truffle, DappTools, etc). It will be a Rust library made to be consumed from other languages like TypeScript, Go, Python, etc as a native dependency. It will implement the baseline of essential functionality every tool should have like Solidity console.log, stack traces, and descriptive error messages, as well as implement code coverage, gas profiling, and a step debugger. At its core, it's an implementation of an Ethereum node with a layer of EVM runtime observation to provide development features.\n\nBuilding a new Hardhat, Truffle, Remix, or DappTools using Rethnet will be a much more manageable project, and Rethnet will be completely reusable for any EVM language through adapters.\n\n### **Hardhat**\n\nOur flagship project targets the local development environment pillar, and it's currently at an advanced level of progress and adoption. While Slang and Rethnet mature and catalyze organic growth in the tooling space, developers still have needs to be met, positioning Hardhat as our immediate-term solution to empower developers to keep decentralizing the world.\n\nHardhat is an Ethereum development environment that developers use to compile, deploy, test, and debug Ethereum software. Most importantly, it's highly flexible, extensible, and designed to empower the community to build their own solutions. This strategy has been successful, and there's already [a valuable ecosystem of reusable plugins](https://hardhat.org/plugins/).\n\nHardhat's roadmap is focused on becoming an extensible development environment with deep integrations across components in key areas of the tooling stack:\n\n- [Hardhat VSCode](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/hardhat-vscode-9de29467fc26) — programming editor\n- [Hardhat Ignition](https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/hardhat-ignition-5a34a4e3d2de) — contract deployment\n- [Hardhat Network](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/) — local development network\n- [Hardhat Runner](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/#overview) — build/testing workflow\n\nThis roadmap leads to developers being well equipped to build powerful extensions to their workflow that increase their productivity according to their exact needs, and to then share them with the ecosystem in the form of plugins.\n\nHardhat will also eventually migrate to using Rethnet and Slang, increasing its feature richness, speed, and stability while enabling dogfooding at scale for our brand new building blocks.\n\n### **Web3.js as a frontend platform**\n\nThe OG Ethereum connector library, Web3.js, is being revitalized into a high-value project. By focusing on community and ecosystem growth, supported by an extensible architecture, it can become a great source of value, much like React represents in the front-end world, but for dapps. A website hub connecting community spaces, support spaces, educational resources, extensions, and related projects, combined with an active ecodev effort (workshops, talks, contests, and incentives), will create a source of leverage for the ecosystem. This will provide better troubleshooting, faster developer training, more reusable code, and, most importantly, the possibility of extending the library. This effort is currently spearheaded by the ChainSafe team.\n\n## **Funding**\n\nThe Nomic Foundation aims to benefit the entire Ethereum ecosystem, which is why we’re fundraising across multiple organizations and individuals within it.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation is leading this round of contributions with $8M, alongside contributions from Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, Consensys, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, Gnosis, a16z, a_capital, and Kaszek Ventures. These donors make up $15M, and we're aiming to raise $15M more.\n\n## **Why Uniswap?**\n\nGenerally, we think that allocating capital to the Nomic Foundation makes strategic sense for any protocol treasury that is aligned long term with the growth of Ethereum, and we've approached and will continue approaching several protocols.\n\nCurrently, Uniswap [is built using Hardhat](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts). While this is a signal of Hardhat’s value, the projects that the Nomic Foundation will deliver will create more value not just for Uniswap, but for the entire ecosystem. We’ll provide services to the Ethereum community that will:\n\n1. Continue the maintenance of critical infrastructure used to build most protocols (Hardhat).\n2. Increase developer productivity for every team in the ecosystem.\n3. Accelerate developer onboarding to Ethereum, increasing the size of the experienced engineering hiring pool and making time-to-productivity shorter for new hires.\n4. Accelerate the pace of innovation and the number of products being built.\n5. Increase market volume driven by new users and new products.\n\nWe believe this grows the market for everyone, including Uniswap, and we’d love to have the **Uniswap DAO contribute $5m in funding to this community effort**.",

If you check the unicode adoption website adopting a character can only be done via credit card. This means funds we raise need to be converted to FIAT and only then a payment can be made.\n\nApproaches we discussed are:\n\n1) Someone we trust in the community creates an address and everyone in the community can donate to that address. That person will then make a donation using credit card and they will be reimbursed with crypto assets we raise.\n\n2) Several members create a multisig and process is pretty much the same as 1)\n\n3) We utilize a PartyDAO (https://www.partybid.app/)  where either individual or several members put up an NFT for sale. If we reach a target and NFT is sold that funds can then be used in similar way as 1) and 2)\n\n4) Trusted member of the community makes a grant proposal to the UGP (https://www.unigrants.org/)\n\nDuring the community call it was agreed that BOR4 (myself) will make this vote on snapshot.\n\nPS if you don't have UNI delegated to you but you are still interested in participating you can also leave a comment on gov forum and we will take this feedback also in the account.

And we’re excited to make this happen and set a precedent for DeFi! \n\n\n**Voltz TL;DR**\n\nVoltz is a new DeFi primitive, bringing interest rate swaps to DeFi in a manner that is up to 3000x more capital efficient than alternative models. Voltz, therefore, is not a competitor to Uniswap but instead is complementary; interest rate swaps are a core pillar of well-functioning financial systems - so as Voltz grows it should help DeFi grow, which in turn should have second order benefits to Uniswap.\n",

      "content": "Dear Uniswap Community,\n\nThe Voltz Labs team recently submitted a proposal to request for an “Additional Use Grant” from Uniswap governance. This would allow Voltz to use aspects of the Uniswap v3 code that is subject to the “Business Source License”.\n\nVoltz is a new DeFi primitive, bringing interest rate swaps to DeFi in a manner that is up to 3000x more capital efficient than alternative models. Voltz, therefore, is not a competitor to Uniswap but instead is complementary; interest rate swaps are a core pillar of well-functioning financial systems - so as Voltz grows it should help DeFi grow, which in turn should have second order benefits to Uniswap.\n\nThat said, the Voltz Labs team recognise the significant R&D that went into v3 and as a result are offering Uniswap governance 1% of Voltz future tokens alongside a number of additional non-financial benefits. The full proposal, and discussion, can be found here: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/should-uniswap-provide-voltz-with-v3-additional-use-grant/15669?u=simonj\n\nFollowing positive feedback, including the discussion with the Voltz Labs founders on the Uniswap discord community call last week, we are now initiating the Temperate Check with the Uniswap community.\n\nWe’re excited to see how the community votes. And excited about the opportunity to make this happen and set a precedent for DeFi!\n",

Although the proposal already exceeded the 40m quorum threshold during the consensus check, the Uniswap community feels it is important to allow all UNI holders the opportunity to cast a vote. One important argument in favor of this decision is that Snapshot is not supported by custody providers like Coinbase, Anchorage, etc., smart contract wallets like Argent/Gnosis safe, or meta governance layers like Index & Compound. \n\nGovernor Bravo requires at least one on-chain action, so the proposal includes a transfer of 0 UNI to satisfy the requirement.\n\nIf the proposal passes this phase, the Uniswap Labs can deploy Uniswap on Polygon on behalf of the Uniswap community.",

      "title": "Add 1 Basis Point Fee Tier ",
      "content": "TLDR: Uniswap should add a 1bps fee tier with 1 tick spacing. This change is straightforward from a technical perspective and would help Uniswap compete in stablecoin <> stablecoin pairs, where the majority of the market share is taken by Curve and DODO.  ## Background on pool fees Uniswap v3 allows for the creation of new pools via calls to the [factory contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984). In order to keep liquidity for pairs consolidated, only a few fee options are allowed–currently, 5, 30, and 100 basis points are supported (10, 60, 200 tick spacing).  Governance should add a 1 basis point fee option for the following reasons: * Curve’s stablecoin markets have 3-4 bps fees. * Dodo’s stablecoin markets have a 1 bps fee. * FTX’s fees for retail are 2/7bps fees and for whales 0/4bps.  However, we recognize there are some potential counterarguments to adding this fee tier: * Adding too many fee tiers can fragment liquidity. * Liquidity providers may earn less in fees.  ### We discuss each of these points in greater detail below This will allow for the creation of much more competitive stablecoin<>stablecoin pools.  Offering low slippage on stablecoin<>stablecoin pairs in AMMs is generally easier than other pairs due to their relatively low price volatility.  As such, the determining factor in driving volume is trading fees. Pouring more capital into a 5 bps fee pool won’t necessarily make Uniswap v3’s pricing more attractive, as lower cost pools exist such as [Curve’s 3pool](https://curve.fi/3pool) (3 bps fees) and [DODO’s USDC-USDT](https://app.dodoex.io/liquidity?network=mainnet) pool (1 bps fees). Indeed, [most USDC-USDT volume from 1inch is routed to DODO](https://dune.xyz/queries/135498). Very little of it is routed to Uniswap v3.  [In the DEX market as a whole](https://dune.xyz/queries/150801) (not just 1inch), DODO and Curve still take the majority of the market share (60-70%) in USDC-USDT trading. Uniswap v3’s concentrated liquidity helped increase market share, but lower fees can help it grab more.  The data tells a similar story for DAI-USDC (see [1inch exported volume](https://dune.xyz/queries/152001) and [overall market share](https://dune.xyz/queries/151999)), though in the case of DAI-USDC, DODO is less active. While the case is compelling just from competition in the DEX space, Uniswap also competes with centralized exchanges.  Many centralized exchanges offer lower than 5 basis point taker fees for high volume traders ([Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/fee/schedule) offers < 5 basis point fees above 40K BTC in 30-day volume, [FTX](https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024479432-Fees) above $25M in 30-day volume, etc.). Lower fees could increase the DEX volume pie by comparing favorably to spot markets on centralized exchanges and drawing volume from large players. ### The change is a very light touch. The change requires just one function call–[`enableFeeAmount(100)`](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/b2c5555d696428c40c4b236069b3528b2317f3c1/contracts/interfaces/IUniswapV3Factory.sol#L77)–on the factory contract. Governance controls this contract, so a simple proposal could make this change.  The enableFeeAmount function takes as parameters  1. Fee: the fee amount denominated in 100ths of a basis point. 2. `tickSpacing`: the granularity one may specify a liquidity range (see the Uniswap v3 Core [whitepaper](https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-v3.pdf) for more details)  To add a 1 basis point fee option, fee would be 100.  `tickSpacing` requires some consideration. On the one hand, too high of a value restricts LPs’ ability to set granular prices, since initializable price ticks would be roughly [`tickSpacing`] basis points apart. On the other hand, too low of a value could entail liquidity being too low in each tick, meaning that larger orders may need to cross multiple ticks to fill, entailing extra gas cost for each additional tick.  We suggest that a value of 1 for `tickSpacing` would be reasonable for 1 basis point fee pools, allowing LPs to set prices with precision in positions that span ~1 basis point between initializable ticks.  For a stablecoin market like USDC-USDT, we expect most of the liquidity to reside in 6 ticks. Orders <$1m will like only require 1 tick and larger orders may require a second or third tick. For each tick used it adds about 15k-20k gas costs.  ### Too many fee tiers can fragment liquidity  The downside of adding too many fee tier possibilities is that liquidity is then fragmented across pools. However, we believe that LPs will naturally settle over time into the fee tier that is most appropriate for the volatility of the pair.  Pairs with particularly low volatility, like stablecoin<>stablecoin pairs, will likely have a liquidity migration to the 1 bps tier, as the required return to capital should be low in equilibrium given the low risk of impermanent loss.  ### LPs may earn less in fees  Assuming overall volume stays stable (although it’s worth mentioning more competitive fees should grow the pie), total fees paid will go down (volume would have to 5X for fees paid to LPs to stay the same).  However, LPs are not the only constituency to take into consideration–takers will be paying lower fees in aggregate. Growing Uniswap’s market share and being the best place to trade across many pairs is important. These pools could become more enticing to large traders looking to swap stablecoins, for instance.  ## Concluding Thoughts  We believe this simple change could boost Uniswap’s competitiveness in low volatility pairs, and the change presents minimal risk for Uniswap.",

      "title": "Should the DEF move its assets to a custodial wallet viewable on chain?",
      "content": "The DeFi Education Fund (DEF) proposes to move the organization's assets to a custodial wallet viewable on chain. Here is the governance forum thread debating this idea: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/moving-defs-assets-to-an-on-chain-custodial-wallet-to-bolster-security/14328\n\nThis is the right move for the organization for several reasons:\n1. The governance proposal that funded the DEF envisioned the implementation of a security-enhancing product like Tally's Safeguard onto the multisig, but it's not ready for implementation. Safeguard would give UNI governance the ability to (i) stop any multisig transaction from taking place, and (ii) request funds sitting in the multisig to be sent back to the Community Treasury. These features would significantly enhance the security of the multisig against unauthorized/coerced/ etc. transactions.\n2. Moving to a custodial wallet likely will present fewer risks to the fund's assets than relying on a four of seven multisig controlled by the committee's publicly-identified committee members, each being effectively 1/4 of a $22M bearer asset.\n3. The DEF would only onboard with a custodian that would support an individual wallet for the DEF's assets, meaning it would offer the same level of transparency as a multisig. \n\nOther details: \n1. Custodian criteria: Security, transparency, and cost. How the custodial wallet would be visible on chain is probably the factor with the most variance across custodians. For example, some use omnibus wallets for multiple clients’ assets, some create a new wallet every time a transaction is completed, etc. A dedicated wallet would be an absolute must in order for the DEF’s funds to be viewable/verifiable on chain, and ideally the wallet wouldn’t change every time there was a transaction in and out of the wallet because that would make viewing/verifying the assets a hassle for the community. When moving assets to the centralized custodian, the DEF would incur a fee based on the dollar value of the assets, which is typically in the range of 25-50 basis points per year. If the DEF moves forward with this proposal, the hope is to work with a custodian sympathetic to the organization's mission who could offer the DEF a \"deal\" on cost. \n2. The DEF would directly on-board with a custodian, and the DEF would continue to pre-announce and explain withdrawals from the custodial wallet on its blog. The DEF would only use a custodian that wouldn’t move any of the assets unless four of the seven committee members validate a transaction to vindicate the four of seven requirement of the current multisig. In other words, only consensus among four of the seven committee members would have the power to validate an outgoing transaction.\n3. There has been no security issue to date motivating this proposal.\n4. The DEF initiated this snapshot but will not vote on it. \n\nThanks all",

The goal of this proposal is to loan $UNI to the $oneUNI contract so that the minting ratio may be lowered from 98% to 80%. This means users will begin depositing $0.20 of $UNI and $0.80 of $USDC to mint each $oneUNI.\n\n**Proposal: How much $UNI will be used to mint Stable UNI ($oneUNI) by 11/30/2021?**\n\nIf you don’t want Uniswap to loan any $UNI, pick option 1 ‘Make no change’.\nIf you want Uniswap to support this effort, pick options 2-7. The actual requested loan amount will be the $UNI-weighted average of these selections. Every $UNI counts!\nWhy isn’t this a single yes vote? Vitalik proposed a ‘skin in the game’ solution to break the ‘tragedy of commons’ problem in token voting. As a first step, our idea is to make the voters focus on predicting the desired outcome of supporting Stable UNI. If this vote passes ‘Temperature Check’, we would like to discuss a potential reward for most accurate voters as part of the ‘Consensus Check’ process.\n\nThe full proposal is at: https://gov.uniswap.org/\n",

[On-Chain Proposal]() ## Summary and Motivation: *Co-written with [Getty Hill](https://twitter.com/getty_hill) (@Getty), [Eddy Lee ](https://twitter.com/yesimeddy) (@elee), [Yuan Han Li ](https://twitter.com/yuan_han_li) (@yuan-han-li), [John Wang ](https://twitter.com/j0hnwang) (@johnwang), and [Ali Khambati ](https://twitter.com/alikhambati1) (@alikhambati)* Governor Alpha, the current governance contract used, was a great start, but in light of Compound's and other protocols upgrade to Governor Bravo, Uniswap should migrate given Bravo's additional safety benefits and upgradability. 1. **Native upgradeability:** Under Governor Alpha, changes to governance parameters require deploying a new contract and completely migrating to a new address. This is particularly damaging to governance participation as it introduces downtime and asynchronicity. Many governance tools and custodians use factory contracts which point to a specific contract address, meaning parties must manually upgrade their infrastructure every time governance parameters are changed under Governor Alpha. This includes tools for creating autonomous proposals like [fish.vote ](https://www.fish.vote/); front-ends such as [Tally ](https://www.withtally.com/), [Sybil](https://sybil.org/#/delegates/uniswap), and [Boardroom ](https://app.boardroom.info/) which aggregate and display governance results for various protocols; and professional custodians which are used by large token holders, delegates, and community members. Enabling a static contract address that has proxy upgradability patterns is paramount for maximizing participation, and maintaining an open and secure governance process. 2. **Voting reason string:** Governor Bravo gives voters the opportunity to add free-form comments (text strings) along with their on-chain votes. Not only does this increase the transparency around the rationale people have behind their votes, but it also facilitates more in-depth and nuanced discussion. 3. **New ���abstain' voting option:** Governor Bravo enables voters to formally abstain rather than forcing them to choose between voting yes/no or not voting at all. This will give voters more flexibility and also increase transparency into delegate behavior. 4. **Proposal numbers won't reset:** Under Governor Alpha, any upgrades to the contract resets the proposal number schema. Notice that [���Proposal 0.4'](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/0/4) (which resulted in deployment and migration to a new Governor Alpha contract due to modifying the proposal submission threshold parameter) caused the following on-chain proposal from @HarvardLawBFI to be numbered [���Proposal 1.1' ](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/1/1). Under Governor Bravo, this would not be an issue and proposal numbers would be continuous because the contract would be maintained at a single address. 5. **Proposal Cancellation:** Bravo allows user-directed cancellations enabling erroneous proposals to be canceled if need be (rather than forcing people to vote no/abstain). 6. **Review Period:** Governor Bravo allows governance to include a review/analysis period. Currently, Compound uses a 13140 block (~2-day) review period that allows holders to review the proposal. This means that users will have 2-days to prepare for voting (e.g., remove UNI from Aave), unlike Governor Alpha which instantly snapshots users' voting power. A review period substantially improves the accessibility and safety of the governance process. ## Implementation: After speaking with the OpenZeppelin team about their reimplementation of Governor Bravo, we think using Compound's Governor Bravo contract instead makes the most sense at this stage. Although Open Zeppelin's Governor contract takes a simpler approach that can include all Bravo functionality, it does not do so by default. The contract uses similar logic, but the code is new. It has gone through an internal audit and review process but still needs to go through an external audit. For the safety and simplicity of Uniswap, we think using Compound's Governor Bravo contract is the best decision for the time being. Compound's Governor contract has already undergone an [audit](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-governor-bravo-audit/) by OpenZeppelin and has been widely used. We can always change/upgrade to Open Zeppelin Governor contract at a future date if their contract introduces new features/functionality the community is interested in. More details on OpenZeppelin's code can be found here: [Github](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/contracts/governance) [Docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/governance) [More info](https://openzeppelin.notion.site/Comparing-Compound-Governor-to-OpenZeppelin-Governor-2-10d0fdcf61ba476fae492b295822ee13) As mentioned in the previous Consensus Check, we have deployed the contract on the Ropsten test net for the community to review our code: [Governor Bravo Delegator](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x15df15caad12adaa03949014ba5cc49a84803d0f#code) [Governor Bravo Delegate](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xD8bf60dfC5115F6cB99bb50502346E7b863800f1#code) [Github for contracts](https://github.com/gettty/uniswap-gov) *NB: The `_initiate` function has been slightly modified to take an initial proposal number as an input rather than pulling it from Governor Alpha. This way Uniswap can resume proper proposal numbering.* ## Resource links: 1.

Establishes a “No Negative Net UNI” ethos, whereby the initial grant amount is maintained\n2.  Uses Uniswap’s own yield mechanisms to sustainably self-fund the program\n\nThese two items enable a much more substantive value-alignment mechanism.  It ensures assets remain close to the ecosystem itself, and can be monitored directly.  It also sets up the long-term capacity for the program to fund itself.\n\nIn addition, we have structured the proposal to include an Oversight Committee, whose sole responsibility is to ensure the program delivers value.  In the event it is deemed ineffective, the Oversight Committee may return the initial grant to the governance process for reassignment to other opportunities.\n\n## **Grant Request - $15M Year 1, $10M Year 2**\n\nWith community member feedback, we have updated our $25M recommendation to a $15M grant in year 1, with a $10M additional grant triggered at the first anniversary with program success.  With $15M of UNI the model can be proven at near-break even; if successful, the remaining $10M will allow for a longer-term commitment.  Note that all commitments must be reviewed for efficacy at the 3 year mark by the Oversight Committee [the Committee can call for a review at any time].\n\nAssuming a 30% yield target is achieved, the $15M will generate approximately $2,250,000 in yield each year, or $187,500 per month. The application of the $187,500 will look as follows:\n\n**50% of this will be delivered to ecosystem community members as bounties ($93,750 per month)**\n\nFlipside’s value proposition begins with analytics, **but its true purpose is to drive ecosystem acquisition and retention:**\n\n*Ecosystem acquisition:*\n\nUtilizing a series of educational programs (see [Terra scavenger hunt](https://www.notion.so/teamflipside/Terra-Explorer-Hunt-7d77cf0c41be475daf1cdec34354fbc4), [SQL training solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jYqYcB7e1s)), and a hands-on community and analytics team, we activate new members into the ecosystem.  This teaches new users how to actually use a complex protocol, how to think about the underlying mechanics, and even how to start becoming adept at using SQL to build queries and public-facing outcomes.\n\nFor our pilot Uniswap program, 69% of bounty recipients had never held UNI before (37 / 54).\n\n**Using this baseline data, this larger scale program will continue to deliver new participants to the Uniswap ecosystem at a projected rate of more than 900 per year [out of 1300 total].**\n\n*Ecosystem retention:*\n\nThe guiding metric for bounty flows is the percent of distributed tokens that are not sold or swapped after they are received. This reflects a traditional retention metric: the community member has chosen to remain involved in and supportive of the ecosystem.\n\nAcross our pilot program for Uniswap, 77% of the bountied UNI remained within the ecosystem (2,026 / 2,631).\n\n**Using this baseline data, this larger scale program will retain $900K UNI [50K Tokens] out of $1.125M UNI [64K Tokens] bountied per year.**\n\nOf the $93,750 in bounties per month, $25-$50k would be utilized to drive acquisition and $40k-$75k to motivate sophisticated analysts to drive substantive outcomes.  This latter portion is critical as historically speaking, “power users’' of analytics have kept the most impactful insights to themselves.  Enabling sophisticated solutions to enter the public domain - like the [Uniswap V3 Fee Calculator](http://uniswapv3.flipsidecrypto.com) - enables ecosystem health and growth.\n\nAll bounties are delivered through weekly programs:  Flipside sources questions from the Community and Uniswap Labs, prepares a bounty construct, releases to the community, QAs all results, and distributes bounties to the most effective outcomes.  This is a complex and very time consuming process, but the return is significant:  extremely directed results that serve community needs with immediacy.  Bounties range from $40 to $650 each, determined by the complexity of the request.\n\n*Bounties for Flipside + Dune Analytics, TheGraph and others*\n\nAnother significant clarification from our initial proposal is that bounties may be constructed for engagement of analysts across other analytics platforms such as Dune Analytics, The Graph and others.  We believe strongly in the overall analytics ecosystem.  We are excited to contribute to effective analysis wherever it may occur.  We will deliver a variety of programs that emphasize the ultimate development of results wherever users are interested in congregating.\n\nAs it relates to the Uniswap Grant Program, these bounties would be focused solely on analytics solutions, while the UGP would provide grants for a broader array of opportunities.\n\n*Year 1 Program Expectations:*\n\nGiven the pilot program data, the expected results from a year of bounties would be as follows:\n-   ~ 900 new community members [acquisition]*\n-   ~ 49,500 UNI retained in ecosystem [retention]\n-   ~ 350+ dashboards and visualizations [+premium interactive solutions]\n\n*recognizing that the entire program is funded by yield, there is a $0 CAC on the acquisition. If you use the yield rate, the CAC is ~$1,250 per analyst.\n\n**The other 50% ($93,750 per month) is Flipside’s Fee To Operate the Program:**\n\nAgain, this fee is paid by the yield, not by the grant itself.  This aligns with Flipside’s belief that the grant is meant to support the community, and the assets are the community’s tokens.   In that way, Flipside’s role is to hold these assets on behalf of the DAO and to distribute the yield to the community, per the terms of the Program.\n\nProgram costs are approximately $100k-$115k per month, excluding taxes.  This includes:\n\nSalaries:\n-   One Data Engineer (100%)\n-   One Data Scientists (100%)\n-   One Full Stack Engineer (100%)\n-   One Business Intelligence Analyst (100%)\n-   One Community Manager (100%)\n-   One Marketing Manager (100%)\n-   One Content Manager (100%)\n-   One Designer (50%)\n-   One Product Manager (10%)\n-   Head of Engineering (10%)\n-   Head of Marketing (10%)\n-   Head of Data Science (10%)\n-   Head of Finance (10%)\n-   Financial Controller (10%)\n\n*Tech Infrastructure*\n\nAdditionally, our cost estimates conservatively include a 10% allocation of our projected infrastructure costs, inclusive of node management (ETH), compute / storage needs (AWS), data warehousing (Snowflake) needs and a variety of other software / architecture tooling requirements to sustain and make the Flipside Velocity database freely available to analysts of all levels.\n\n*Taxes on Yield*\n\nNote that Flipside will also be covering 30% tax rate on all yield, which also impacts the final margin.\n\n*It Does Not Include*\n\nAny fee for the IP developed to provide historical state-ready analytics.\n\nAlso note that no general G&A costs are included in this (ie: human resources, operations, employee benefits).\n\n*Margin*\n\nAt the $15M grant level, Flipside is operating at a near BE margin.  We are willing to operate at this level to prove the model in year 1 (note that we expect to compound our fees to generate additional yield, which should help us to mitigate margin pressure).\n\nIn year 2, with a $10M additional grant, Flipside’s margin would be able to increase to 18%.\n\n## Automated Investment Strategy\n\nWe outlined an approach in our [temperature check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-larger-grant-program-construct-community-enabled-analytics-no-negative-net-uni/13044) that will generate perpetual yield for a continuous CEA program while mitigating negative effects on the UNI token. Based on feedback from key community participants, we have made slight revisions to our strategy, and recommend the following:\n\n-   100% of the UNI be deposited into AAVE protocol as collateral\n-   Borrow against 50% of the collateral in the form of ETH\n-   A DeFi Saver Smart Wallet will be used to manage the position\n-   50% of the borrowed ETH to be swapped into UNI, and both assets will be deposited as liquidity in the WETH-UNI 0.3% pool symmetrically\n-   A custom Visor vault developed with Gamma Strategies will be used to manage the liquidity position\n\nTo optimize yield and minimize risk, we will partner with [Gamma Strategies](https://github.com/gammastrategies) and [Visor Finance](http://visor.finance/) to automatically manage our position in the Uniswap V3 pool. Automated position management ensures we can optimally realize & compound rewards to maximize yield for the program, while minimizing risks of human error.\n\nEach time that the LP position is rebalanced, 50% of the accrued fees will be distributed to a wallet designated for bounties, while the other 50% (due to Flipside) will be compounded back into the LP for the first year.  This will result in additional yield generation for the program over the course of time through the power of compounding.\n\nConcurrently, we will be utilizing [DefiSaver](https://defisaver.com/) to automatically manage our leveraged position on AAVE.   In the event of meaningful divergence between UNI and ETH prices, DefiSaver will minimize any risks of liquidation by optimizing for collateralization via programmatic debt paydown using AAVE’s flash loans.  Any fees incurred for utilizing flash loans will be more than offset with the yield generated from the LP.\n\nWhile the overall yield generated through the use of collateralization is less than investing the entire grant position outright directly into the LP, we believe there are numerous benefits to this approach:\n\n-   No requirement to sell UNI, since we will be borrowing ETH against the UNI collateral.  In light of recent events, we believe this is a desirable outcome for the community\n-   Deepens the liquidity of UNI on AAVE, a major DeFi protocol\n\nFinally, the risk of obtaining the most effective yield - and the bounties for participants and fees for Flipside - are entirely the responsibility of Flipside.  In the event the yield contribution is below expectations, the fees and bounties will reduce symmetrically.  In the event there is consistent reduction, the Allocation Committee (as noted below) will be able to evaluate other investment strategies for consideration, and approve changes.\n\n## Fiduciary Responsibility and Accountability to the DAO\n\nIt’s critical that assets are managed effectively and are delivering value to the ecosystem. In the event the assets are not delivering value, they should be repurposed for other initiatives to enable ecosystem stability and growth. [Full details on oversight in the Consensus Check.](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-uniswap-funds-community-enabled-analytics-via-yield-generating-investment-strategies/13220/1)\n\nThree components provide effective checks and balances to ensure maximum accountability to the Uniswap ecosystem:\n\n**Allocation Committee:** whose purpose is to oversee fund execution strategy utilizing Gnosis Safe’s industry standard multi-sig technology to ensure both effective management and protection/safety of funds (longer-term, we would aim to migrate to Tally’s Failsafe solution once enabled, which is built on top of Gnosis).\n\nThe 7-member Allocation Committee will be comprised of:\n-   [Will Price](https://twitter.com/will__price?lang=en) / DeFi Citizen; Data Scientist\n-   [Nathan Howard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-howard-a5565756/), Index Coop\n-   2 Individuals from University Blockchain Orgs.  To be Identified and Announced Post On-Chain Vote so as to not influence voting.\n-   3 Members of Flipside’s Team\n\n**Oversight Committee:** whose purpose is to ensure that the grant proceeds are applied in a manner consistent with its design.\n\nThe Committee will meet and take a vote annually to evaluate the continuation of the program.\n\nOn the first anniversary of the program, the Committee may take a vote to remove the trigger of the second $10M grant.  The $10M grant will reside in the Gnosis Safe address where funds are delivered following governance execution, and will require requisite approval to facilitate a transfer of the assets into the contemplated strategies. Funds will be redirected towards other uses through the standard governance process should the program prove unsuccessful.\n\nIn the event the Oversight Committee determines the program to be ineffective, at any voting junction, the $25M grant would be submitted as a proposal to Uniswap Governance to be evaluated and re-assigned to other programs.\n\nThe 3-member Oversight Committee will be comprised of:\n-   [Nic Carter](https://twitter.com/nic__carter), Supreme Being\n-   [Boris Stanic,](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/boris-stanic-bor4-community-first/12667) Uniswap/TheStable\n-   [Dave Balter,](https://twitter.com/davebalter?lang=en) CEO Flipside\n\n**Transparency Dashboard:** Tracking fund performance and transaction activities will be broadcast live via a custom dashboard for the Uniswap community.\n\n## Summary:  Community-Enabled Analytics for Uniswap\n\nThe purpose of the grant is to utilize yield to acquire and retain new community members, by funding a sophisticated education and analytics platform. [Full details in the temperature check.](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-larger-grant-program-construct-community-enabled-analytics-no-negative-net-uni/13044)\n\n-   Provides free historical state-ready, transformed Uniswap v3 data for SQL analytics - as well as visualization and API solutions.\n-   Produces educational content for analysts of all levels to activate within the Uniswap ecosystem.  Beginners can learn SQL, advanced users can optimize results to deliver sophisticated solutions like the [Uniswap v3 Fee Calculator](http://uniswapv3.flipsidecrypto.com).\n-   Sources analytics requirements from Uniswap Labs as well as the community, and turns them into bountyable requests, which may be offered on multiple platforms including Flipside, Dune, The Graph or others.\n-   Runs structured bounty programs activating analysts to produce outcomes. Includes quality control of results to ensure the data is effective and correct.\n-   Delivers bounties rewards (in UNI tokens) into the hands of community members, activating new members and retaining participation.\n\nAll of this is funded through yield generation, maintaining the initial grant and ultimately delivering no negative net UNI.\n",

Continuation of the program will require an additional governance vote. Upon renewal of the program, each of the three initiatives can be broken out into separate proposals.\n\nThe program will aim to bootstrap liquidity across three different initiatives:\n\n* Stablecoin pairs\n* Mid-tail pairs (e.g DeFi governance tokens)\n* Deposit receipt tokens (i.e. cTokens, aTokens)\n\nNote that this is just the beginning of the Uniswap Liquidity Program (v0.1). We want to start simple and evaluate the program's effectiveness before we expand it. We will provide periodic updates on ULP to Uniswap governance and seek community feedback.\n\n# Vote\n\nShould we begin Uniswap Liquidity Program v0.1?\n* Yes\n* No",

      "title": "Create a CAPITAL PROTECTION Tool for v3!! ",
      "content": "Would you like to have 100% protection against volatility for your crypto?? This could be done using the new Concentrated Liquidity of v3 by just changing or adding a few things! \n\nImagine adding liquidity to the ETH/USDC pair for example (50% of each), and in case the ETH price drops and gets out of your range, your capital is turned 100% into USDC!! This way you would be 100% PROTECTED against LOSSES! And in case the ETH price goes up again and completely crosses your range in an upward direction, your capital would be automatically swaped 100% into ETH!!\n\nYou could even manually FOLLOW or TRAIL the ETH price every time it goes up, by removing and adding a new liquidity range at a higher price, and this could help you MAXIMIZE YOUR PROFITS!! You could very efficiently trade tops like this! Just imagine trading perfectly the ETH TOP of this Bull market! Either if it is 10k, 15k, or 20k, you could just follow it and trade it perfectly!! And after it drops, you can continue to follow the price, GROWING YOUR CAPITAL thanks to a high yield from fees, and volatility itself! Knowing your capital is always completely PROTECTED against ANY LOSSES!!\n\nThe problem now is that the direction of the swaps inside a liquidity range are exactly the opposite as they should be... Using the same example, if the ETH price drops out of your range, your capital is swaped 100% into ETH, and if the price goes up and gets out of the range, your capital is 100% swaped into USDC... It should be the exact opposite!\n\nSo this is a PROPOSAL to change the direction the swaps are made inside a liquidity range to the exact opposite they are now, or to at least let the users choose the direction of the swaps when they add liquidity to the pools or create ranged orders.\n\nIf we make this change, it would be DISRUPTIVE and Uniswap will completely BREAK all other DEXs and CEXs!! People would LOOSE the FEAR of loosing their money because of volatility!! This would easily help with crypto's mass adoption!! And it will definitely drive more LPs to v3!! Please think about it and support this proposal! Thanks!! ",

      "content": "#### (Previously known as: DeFi Political Defense Fund)\n\nPast discussion:\n\n[Temperature Check ](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-funding-a-political-defense-of-defi/12557)| [Snapshot ](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/QmVXXEXJJKjFJtwXyy4Xx3gBckhz6TvorZoLgX3yiB7Hki)\n\n[Consensus Check Thread 1](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-uni-should-fund-a-political-defense-organization-for-decentralized-finance/12700) | [Consensus Check Thread 2](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-uni-should-fund-a-political-defense-organization-for-decentralized-finance-copy/12717) | [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/QmaUPBYqkiKnwkaVNVrUDpD6fk5EXXTqJjn71qHNYW4YQn)\n\nProposal to allocate one million UNI to create and fund the “DeFi Education Fund,” a 501(c)(4) nonprofit entity based in the United States to provide grants for political, educational, and legal engagement. This proposal has passed the temperature and consensus checks with **[massive supermajorities](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/QmaUPBYqkiKnwkaVNVrUDpD6fk5EXXTqJjn71qHNYW4YQn)** after a month of healthy, spirited debate. Since the Temperature Check posted, the need for this fund has become even more apparent. We have incorporated much of the constructive feedback to balance transparency, effectiveness, and speed to further this entity’s important mission for the community.\n\nThe 501(c)(4) will fund education and advocacy through both existing advocacy organizations and potentially new ones. The funding will have the goals of 1) pushing back against misguided regulatory, legal, or political threats to decentralized finance; 2) achieving regulatory clarity for decentralized finance and related activity; 3) advancing laws that support decentralized finance and decentralized governance; and 4) spurring other DeFi protocols’ governance bodies to contribute to the effort (through this entity or their own). The entity will be nonpartisan and global in approach and orientation.\n\n#### The DeFi Education Fund will fund all of the following:\n\n* Policy-maker education: we need more people directly educating legislative and regulatory policymakers about DeFi and advocating for policy positions that favor DeFi and its participants;\n* Thought leadership and research: we need more written and video content explaining DeFi and its benefits in a medium that positively impacts the public perception of DeFi;\n* Legal firepower: we need to develop a strong bench of legal advocates in multiple jurisdictions and venues;\n* Messaging: we need to better formulate ideas, prepare spokespeople, and communicate to policymakers and the general public on the benefits and promise of DeFi;\n* Grassroots advocacy: we need to make it easy for individuals who already care about DeFi to voice their opinions to policymakers globally alongside organized efforts; and\n* Best practices: we need more analysis and legal models for all DeFi projects to benefit from collectively.\n\nThis entity will not replicate the great work of existing organizations such as Coin Center, Fight for the Future, the Blockchain Association, the Crypto Council for Innovation, the Defi Alliance, Blockchain for Europe, or others. Rather, among other things, it will help to fund these and other organizations to expand their capabilities to more effectively advocate for and advance DeFi protocols.\n\nFurther, this entity will extend its monetary impact by conditioning some of its grants with matching by other governance treasuries, crypto foundations, or crowd-matching.\n\nGrants administration for advocacy is a subjective process that cannot be easily automated, and thus we propose a grants committee overseen by an accountable entity. This committee will hire a grants-making leader or staff and create an efficient, predictable process for applicants.\n\nWe propose the following as the initial committee members, with a subset of them serving as the entity’s board of directors. All have expressed their willingness to join the committee:\n\n1. Larry Sukernik, co-founder, Reverie.\n2. Rebecca Rettig, General Counsel, Aave Companies.\n3. Jake Chervinsky, General Counsel, Compound Labs & Strategic Advisor, Variant Fund.\n4. Marc Boiron, General Counsel, dYdX Trading.\n5. Katie Biber, Chief Legal Officer of Brex, Board of Directors of Anchorage.\n6. Sheila Warren, World Economic Forum, Executive Committee (Cryptocurrency Lead).\n7. Marvin Ammori, Chief Legal Officer, Uniswap Labs.\n\nDue to the dynamic and somewhat unpredictable state of global policy proposals, we believe the grant-making committee should have considerable discretion to allow for flexibility and speed, subject to the necessary disclosure of its activities on a regular basis. We expect many members to serve pro bono and total compensation across the committee to be less than $150,000 annually.\n\nThe following changes have been incorporated due to community feedback:\n\n* The name will focus on education rather than defense–the DeFi Education Fund.\n* The scope is broadened to include the funding of organizations working to promote best regulatory practices among those in the DeFi ecosystem.\n* Beyond the considerable disclosure required for a 501(c)(4), the entity will publicly post monthly community updates on progress, grant allocation, tactics, etc. These updates will not only ensure trust but will also keep the community informed on when and how they can lend their voice to the policy process. When there are surprises, as there so often have been in the policy space, the Committee will report why and how funds will be reallocated to address them.\n* The 501(c)(4) will promptly hire at least one full-time staffer to manage the day-to-day operations of the organization with oversight from the board of directors and who will serve as the primary point of contact for the governance community.\n* The 501(c)(4) will issue a detailed budget within 90 days of the proposal passing. Note that budgets, projections, and 5-year plans often must be revised and amended.\n\n##### Multisig wallet address: 0x1C95930Dfc1139381265ce45B5f480F1EFae09A1\n---\n### A Word About Trust and the Multisig Wallet:\n\nWhile we are thrilled the Consensus Check passed with [strong approval](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/QmaUPBYqkiKnwkaVNVrUDpD6fk5EXXTqJjn71qHNYW4YQn) (73% for, 27% against), it’s important to us that we operate this initiative in a way that even those who voted against can get behind.\n\nIn particular, there was feedback that the proposal asked for a lot of money upfront with little in the way of checks and balances. We believe that the structure does provide a lot in the way of checks and balances. Nonetheless, we detail some of the steps we took to add even more checks in the design of the proposal.\n\nTo safely and transparently hold the funds, a 4/7 multisig consisting of the seven committee members was created at the following address: 0x1C95930Dfc1139381265ce45B5f480F1EFae09A1. To be even more precise, here are the names and addresses of the seven multisig members:\n\n* Jake Chervinsky | 0xdC856762b024814F6B5dc28e97e514e001D6820C | o/b/o Defi Education Fund\n* Larry Sukernik | 0x773EE93E36bAaFa7F73B41ccC6800126829d3589 | o/b/o Defi Education Fund\n* Rebecca Rettig | 0xcF8C946C6819dafE62f82803E01eB27Ea232825C | o/b/o Defi Education Fund\n* Marc Boiron | 0x2132bEADc4D7b196249c1A746B8eeA91099bb1cE | o/b/o Defi Education Fund\n* Marvin Ammori | 0xea067C58367D022a1c58354fE544C542c68587ec | o/b/o Defi Education Fund\n* Katie Biber | 0xcB598f253818398f3d91595f22D897096e240Ae3 | o/b/o Defi Education Fund\n* Sheila Warren | 0xbcAD071A51896666c3B48fC5Fd5A872981FB254E | o/b/o Defi Education Fund\n\nWhile a multisig wallet goes a long way towards trustlessly holding funds, we think Tally’s new open-source product, [Failsafe](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-uni-should-fund-a-political-defense-organization-for-decentralized-finance/12700/67), would be helpful (fun fact: Failsafe was funded by the Uniswap Grants Program).\n\nSimply put, Failsafe is an additional safety mechanism built on top of the multisig wallet that allows Uniswap tokenholders to (i) stop any multisig transaction from taking place, and (ii) request funds sitting in the multisig to be sent back to Uniswap’s treasury. We think this is a powerful product that all multisigs should use in the future.\n\nAlthough we want to use Failsafe as soon as possible, the product is just entering its trial phase with the Uniswap Grants Committee and is in the process of receiving code audits. While that means we can’t use Failsafe from the get-go, the good news is Failsafe can be deployed on top of the multisig wallet after the fact. Once audited, we’d like to integrate it to allow UNI tokenholders to have the ultimate say over the funds.\n\nThe Committee plans to put roughly half of the total grant into the Failsafe, and begin disbursing half immediately. It will seek the Failsafe funds on a quarterly or annual basis when those funds need to be accessed. However, because the Failsafe is not ready yet, you should cast your votes as though you are approving all 1M upfront.\n",

      "content": "### Author: Feddas@Yam.Finance\n### Forum Post: https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-should-we-be-managing-systemic-risk-in-uniswaps-community-treasury-using-kpi-options/12624\n\n# Summary\n\n## Problem\n\nUniswap's governance treasury will retain 43% of $UNI supply vested over 4 years, currently allocated 113 million in $UNI. Current value ~ ****$2.724 Billion USD. Max drawdown starting on May 3 2021, in 20 days $UNI lost 71% of it's value, a loss of ~ **$3.616 Billion USD.**\nWe need to manage this systemic risk and volatility for the long term success of the community treasury. \n\n## Solution\n\nPartial divestment of Uniswap governance treasury by using UMA Synthetic KPI Options to create a win for the treasury, a win for the protocol and a win for the stakeholders. Long term goal would be to put together an actively managed portfolio for the treasury aka uniHOUSE.\n\nTVL Metric is only an example. There have been suggestions on using other metrics to measure the KPI for this option. It is currently an open issue which  we can delve into more after the temperature check.\n\n### TLDR:\n\n![https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/be190280-346d-46c8-beac-5d2827c06bf8/Untitled.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/be190280-346d-46c8-beac-5d2827c06bf8/Untitled.png)\n\n# Background\n\n## Yam.Finance\n\n[Yam.finance](http://yam.finance) has been leading the charge on treasury management for DAOs via our project DAO House: [https://yamfinance.medium.com/yam-finance-presents-dao-house-86625f9bae5a](https://yamfinance.medium.com/yam-finance-presents-dao-house-86625f9bae5a)\n\nWe've realized that there are significant systemic risks for DAO's treasuries. During the bear market of 2017 multiple projects were forced to sell their treasury at historically low values, which ultimately caused many of them to disband and shutter. \n\nTreasury management is mission critical for DAOs, yet the challenges and complexities are formidable. Sushi realized this systemic issue and collaborated with [Yam.Finance](http://yam.Finance) to build a custom treasury management solution called sushiHOUSE: [https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushihouse-a-treasury-management-proposal/3106](https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushihouse-a-treasury-management-proposal/3106)\n\nThe most difficult part of a treasury management solution for a DAO as large as UNI, is the first part, the treasury protocol token divestment. I present a novel solution that will benefit the treasury, the long term success of the protocol and also all stakeholders. \n\n## UMA Synthetics\n\nA quick primer on UMA: [https://docs.umaproject.org/getting-started/how-uma-works](https://docs.umaproject.org/getting-started/how-uma-works)\n\nBy using UMA's platform, we are able to use battle tested UMA financial contracts to create KPI options. Here are some examples of current KPI options that are already deployed and distributed.\n\n[https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-kpi-options-and-airdrop-bae86be16ce4](https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-kpi-options-and-airdrop-bae86be16ce4)\n\n[https://medium.com/uma-project/badgerdaos-rebase-mining-kicks-off-now-using-uma-s-kpi-options-cd75f71dc1fa](https://medium.com/uma-project/badgerdaos-rebase-mining-kicks-off-now-using-uma-s-kpi-options-cd75f71dc1fa)\n\n# KPI Options\n\n## How do KPI Options work?\n\nKPI options can be created by using UMA's battle tested UMA financial contracts. \n\n1. Determine KPI metric for the synthetic. For example, KPI metric is Total Value Locked (TVL), currently ~$1.5b. KPI Metric could be many different things like volume, total fees generated over 30 days ect. \n2. Determine target for KPI, value and expiry date. For example, we want to target 2x TVL start, $3b and want the option to expire end of 2021.\n3. Mint KPI option by depositing collateral to be used at settlement. For example, collateralize 1 $UNI token for 1 KPI option. \n4. For our example above:\n    1. TVL option starts at a value of .5 $UNI because current TVL is $1.5b\n    2. If TVL > $3b before the end of 2021, the TVL option can be settled for 1 $UNI after it expires at the end of 2021. \n    3. If TVL < $3b at expiry it will be worth a fraction of 1 $UNI. For example at expiry TVL is $2b, the value of the synth expires to 2/3 $UNI = .667 $UNI.\n    4. Synth is unliquidatable and fully collateralized. \n\n## How do KPI Options divest UNI's community treasury?\n\nFrom example above, KPI Option is created by:\n\n1. Collateralizing 1 $UNI token \n2. KPI metric tracked is TVL, starting at $1.5b\n3. Target is $3b TVL by the end of the year. If it reaches $3b TVL anytime before expiry  \n\nUNI's community treasury is able to utilize its treasury full of UNI tokens to create these KPI options. \n\n1. KPI Options would be minted by treasury and sold for stable coins via a gnosis auction or by various other means. Implied value of the option is .5 UNI (current TVL is $1.5b with target of $3b). \n2. The sale would fund the treasury with stablecoins which could then be used to create a secondary market for the KPI Options by using Uniswap's AMM pools. \n3. At expiry all KPI options could be settled and stablecoins withdrawn from LP positions. \n4. Treasury now has stable coins = WIN!\n5. UNI stake holders have incentives to increase TVL = WIN!\n6. Stablecoins are the cornerstone of long term success for UNI protocol = WIN!\n\nWin - Win - Win\n\n# Additional Details\n\n[Yam.finance](http://yam.finance) has extensive knowledge on building synthetics on UMA's platform via our development of [degenerative.finance](http://degenerative.finance), V2 of site to be launched soon. Combined with our experience in DAO treasury management, it allows us to have a unique perspective to create this proposal. \n\n### Links:\n\n[https://claim.umaproject.org/](https://claim.umaproject.org/)\n\n[https://medium.com/uma-project/the-uma-kpi-options-airdrop-is-now-claimable-and-the-super-uman-campaign-is-live-7e9baa5c1669](https://medium.com/uma-project/the-uma-kpi-options-airdrop-is-now-claimable-and-the-super-uman-campaign-is-live-7e9baa5c1669)\n\n[https://medium.com/uma-project/badgerdaos-rebase-mining-kicks-off-now-using-uma-s-kpi-options-cd75f71dc1fa](https://medium.com/uma-project/badgerdaos-rebase-mining-kicks-off-now-using-uma-s-kpi-options-cd75f71dc1fa)\n\n[https://forum.sushi.com/t/build-kpi-options-with-uma-to-speed-kashi-adoption/3940](https://forum.sushi.com/t/build-kpi-options-with-uma-to-speed-kashi-adoption/3940)\n\n[https://etherscan.io/token/0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F984?a=0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F984?a=0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc)c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc",

      "title": "Reduce the UNI proposal submission threshold to 2.5M",
      "content": "This proposal lowers the UNI proposal submission threshold from 10M UNI to 2.5M UNI.\n\nUniswap’s governance system currently has a high threshold of 10M votes for proposal submission.  As mentioned in Dharma's [earlier proposal](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/1), there have been  [discussions](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-reduce-amount-of-unis-required-to-submit-governance-proposal/3320)  on  [lowering thresholds](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-reduce-amount-of-unis-required-to-submit-governance-proposal/3320/29)  to make governance more accessible.\n\nSince that original proposal, the number of delegated votes has increased from ~80M to ~170M, making it much easier to reach the quorum threshold of 40M votes. However, the UNI token price increase over the past 6 months has made the proposal submission threshold extremely difficult to achieve for one individual.\n\nThe Fish.vote team has prepared a new proposal in line with Dharma's original motivations: making governance more accessible, while still ensuring that Uniswap governance is not subject to unilateral deleterious actors.  _We propose a threshold of 2.5m UNI for proposal submission, and keeping the existing 40M quorum threshold._ Though this proposal threshold is still quite high, we believe in making small, conservative changes in the right direction.\n\nIn order to reduce these thresholds, a new  `GovernorAlpha` contract is required. We have chosen to use the same smart contract code from Dharma's original proposal with these new values. To that end, we have [deployed a new contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc4e172459f1e7939d522503b81afaac1014ce6f6#code) which contains the following changes:\n\n-   `proposalThreshold`  has been modified from  `10_000_000e18`  to  `2_500_000e18`, i.e. from 1% to 0.25%.\n-   a public  `__acceptAdmin()`  function has been added, allowing the contract to claim ownership over the  `Timelock`  contract once  `setPendingAdmin`  has been executed.\n-   `timelock`  and  `uni`  are now declared as  `constant`  instead of via assignment to storage slots during contract construction, as their values are not modifiable after deployment (and use of  `immutable`  would necessitate a major Solidity version bump and corresponding refactor of already well-audited code).\n\nWe believe this proposal is a conservative step in the right direction for UNI governance, and one that creates a more accessible governance ecosystem. We hope this is the first of many improvements that Fish.vote can be a part of.",

During the bear market of 2017 multiple projects were forced to sell their treasury at historically low values, which ultimately caused many of them to disband and shutter. \n\nTreasury management is mission critical for DAOs, yet the challenges and complexities are formidable. Sushi realized this systemic issue and collaborated with [Yam.Finance](http://yam.Finance) to build a custom treasury management solution called sushiHOUSE: [https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushihouse-a-treasury-management-proposal/3106](https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushihouse-a-treasury-management-proposal/3106)\n\nThe most difficult part of a treasury management solution for a DAO as large as UNI, is the first part, the treasury protocol token divestment. I present a novel solution that will benefit the treasury, the long term success of the protocol and also all stakeholders. \n\n## UMA Synthetics\n\nA quick primer on UMA: [https://docs.umaproject.org/getting-started/how-uma-works](https://docs.umaproject.org/getting-started/how-uma-works)\n\nBy using UMA's platform, we are able to use battle tested UMA financial contracts to create KPI options. Here are some examples of current KPI options that are already deployed and distributed.\n\n[https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-kpi-options-and-airdrop-bae86be16ce4](https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-kpi-options-and-airdrop-bae86be16ce4)\n\n[https://medium.com/uma-project/badgerdaos-rebase-mining-kicks-off-now-using-uma-s-kpi-options-cd75f71dc1fa](https://medium.com/uma-project/badgerdaos-rebase-mining-kicks-off-now-using-uma-s-kpi-options-cd75f71dc1fa)\n\n# KPI Options\n\n## How do KPI Options work?\n\nKPI options can be created by using UMA's battle tested UMA financial contracts. \n\n1. Determine KPI metric for the synthetic. For example, KPI metric is Total Value Locked (TVL), currently ~$1.5b. KPI Metric could be many different things like volume, total fees generated over 30 days ect. \n2. Determine target for KPI, value and expiry date. For example, we want to target 2x TVL start, $3b and want the option to expire end of 2021.\n3. Mint KPI option by depositing collateral to be used at settlement. For example, collateralize 1 $UNI token for 1 KPI option. \n4. For our example above:\n    1. TVL option starts at a value of .5 $UNI because current TVL is $1.5b\n    2. If TVL > $3b before the end of 2021, the TVL option can be settled for 1 $UNI after it expires at the end of 2021. \n    3. If TVL < $3b at expiry it will be worth a fraction of 1 $UNI. For example at expiry TVL is $2b, the value of the synth expires to 2/3 $UNI = .667 $UNI.\n    4. Synth is unliquidatable and fully collateralized. \n\n## How do KPI Options divest UNI's community treasury?\n\nFrom example above, KPI Option is created by:\n\n1. Collateralizing 1 $UNI token \n2. KPI metric tracked is TVL, starting at $1.5b\n3. Target is $3b TVL by the end of the year. If it reaches $3b TVL anytime before expiry  \n\nUNI's community treasury is able to utilize its treasury full of UNI tokens to create these KPI options. \n\n1. KPI Options would be minted by treasury and sold for stable coins via a gnosis auction or by various other means. Implied value of the option is .5 UNI (current TVL is $1.5b with target of $3b). \n2. The sale would fund the treasury with stablecoins which could then be used to create a secondary market for the KPI Options by using Uniswap's AMM pools. \n3. At expiry all KPI options could be settled and stablecoins withdrawn from LP positions. \n4. Treasury now has stable coins = WIN!\n5. UNI stake holders have incentives to increase TVL = WIN!\n6. Stablecoins are the cornerstone of long term success for UNI protocol = WIN!\n\nWin - Win - Win\n\n# Additional Details\n\n[Yam.finance](http://yam.finance) has extensive knowledge on building synthetics on UMA's platform via our development of [degenerative.finance](http://degenerative.finance), V2 of site to be launched soon. Combined with our experience in DAO treasury management, it allows us to have a unique perspective to create this proposal. \n\n### Links:\n\n[https://claim.umaproject.org/](https://claim.umaproject.org/)\n\n[https://medium.com/uma-project/the-uma-kpi-options-airdrop-is-now-claimable-and-the-super-uman-campaign-is-live-7e9baa5c1669](https://medium.com/uma-project/the-uma-kpi-options-airdrop-is-now-claimable-and-the-super-uman-campaign-is-live-7e9baa5c1669)\n\n[https://medium.com/uma-project/badgerdaos-rebase-mining-kicks-off-now-using-uma-s-kpi-options-cd75f71dc1fa](https://medium.com/uma-project/badgerdaos-rebase-mining-kicks-off-now-using-uma-s-kpi-options-cd75f71dc1fa)\n\n[https://forum.sushi.com/t/build-kpi-options-with-uma-to-speed-kashi-adoption/3940](https://forum.sushi.com/t/build-kpi-options-with-uma-to-speed-kashi-adoption/3940)\n\n[https://etherscan.io/token/0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F984?a=0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F984?a=0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc)\n\nManaging Systemic Risk in Uniswap's Community Treasury using KPI Options",

Since there is no liquidity mining, it is hard to make the case that multiple deployments will segment liquidity, and long term if this is an issue governance can flip the switch on liquidity incentives for the chains it desires deepest liquidity. In the meantime, not deploying to new and growing networks like Arbitrum and Matic just allows for other exchanges to come in and fill that spot. This could potentially eat into fees earned by governance in the future.\n\nAlongside this, it will help to grow the potential list of projects that can be built on Uniswap v3. Growing the public smart contract libraries interfacing with and using the v3 codebase will only expedite Uniswap adoption on all chains as the code and integrations become more battle tested.\n\nArbitrum launches later this week on May 28th. I think it would be best to start a discussion ASAP around deploying the Uniswap v3 code to Arbitrum network.\n\n### Next Steps\nIndicate your interest for Uniswap moving forward with a deployment of Uniswap v3 on Arbitrum, by (1) opening the Uniswap v3 license to include code deployed on Arbitrum, (2) allowing community developers to implement Uniswap v3 on Arbitrum.\n",

      "content": "A proposal for funding Uniswap ecosystem development with up grants from the UNI treasury.\n\nThe mission of the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) is to provide valuable resources to help grow the Uniswap ecosystem. \n\nA grants program is a by definition a subjective process that cannot be easily automated. \n\nSo the proposal calls for a small committee of 6 members—1 lead and 5 reviewers—to deliver an efficient, predictable process to applicants.\n\nThe budget proposed is:\n\n- $750K (of UNI) per quarter\n- Over 2 quarters\n\nThe assumption is that $1.5M worth of UNI seems appropriate for an MVP, especially relative to the size of the treasury that UNI token holders are entrusted with allocating. \n\nMore details and an explanation of the methodology that got us here are live on Discourse, and we are polling consensus before putting this to a governance vote — as soon as next week!\n\nShould UNI gov create a committee for grant funding?\n\nPlease show your opinions!",

      "content": "Authors: @monet-supply @coopahtroopa \n\n### Background: \nUniswap’s [genesis liquidity incentive program](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/) ended on Nov 17. The program distributed 20 million UNI to LPs over 2 months, split evenly between the WBTC/ETH, USDC/ETH, USDT/ETH, and DAI/ETH pools. This worked out to 2.5 million UNI per pool, per month.\n\n#### Benefits of UNI distribution to LPs:\nOngoing incentives allows UNI to be distributed to those providing value in the form of liquidity\nThe incentivized pools are likely to remain the most liquid DEX pair on Ethereum, providing a venue to trade against ETH at virtually any size with zero slippage.\nReduced incentives prevents UNI from being distributed ‘too fast’, marked by all tokens being distributed before the Foundation’s four year vesting has passed.\n\n#### Drawbacks of UNI distribution to LPs:\nOngoing incentives result in UNI largely being ‘farmed and dumped’ to earn yield. See ETH USD Yield Farm, Pickle, Harvest and Alpha.\nReduced incentives means UNI is distributed slower.\nIncentivizing the same pools can be seen as choosing ‘winners’ by selecting WBTC as THE Bitcoin on Ethereum and favoring certain stablecoins over others.\n\n### Proposed new distribution: \nDistribute UNI for an additional 2 months from the time this proposal is adopted and executed by governance, but at half the rate of the previous distribution (5 million UNI per month instead of 10 million UNI per month). \n\n**Note that pool distributions were adjusted slightly from the previous [temperature check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-should-uniswap-distribute-uni-to-liquidity-providers/8591) process**. Reasoning behind this adjustment can be found [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/discussion-uniswap-liquidity-incentive-plan/8590/68). \n\nUNI will be distributed to the following 4 pools:\nWBTC/ETH - 1.67 million UNI per month, ⅓ of total\nUSDC/ETH - 1.25 million UNI per month, ¼ of total\nUSDT/ETH - 1.25 million UNI per month, ¼ of total\nDAI/ETH - 0.83 million UNI per month, ⅙ of total\n\nPlease see the liquidity incentive [governance plan document](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/discussion-uniswap-liquidity-incentive-plan/8590) for full details and timelines. \n\n### Consensus check question:\n\nShould Uniswap distribute UNI to liquidity providers per the specifications outlined above?\n\n### Next steps:\nThe previous [temperature check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-should-uniswap-distribute-uni-to-liquidity-providers/8591) process passed with sufficient support of UNI voters. The following consensus check poll is the second phase of Uniswap’s [governance process](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/community-governance-process/7732).\n\nThe snapshot poll will be live for 5 days. If the poll passes with a minimum of 50,000 UNI in support, this initiative will move forward as a formal governance proposal. \n\nConsensus check forum post can be found [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-should-uniswap-distribute-uni-to-liquidity-providers/8878).",

      "content": "## Context\n\n- Why: [Retroactive Airdrop Excludes Proxy Contract Users)](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/retroactive-airdrop-excludes-proxy-contract-users-e-g-dharma-matcha-etc/1222)\n- How: [Application For Retroactive Proxy Contract Airdrop [For Projects / Apps]](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/application-for-retroactive-proxy-contract-airdrop-for-projects-apps/3221)\n- Phase 1 Details: [[Proposal] Excluded Proxy Contract Airdrop — Phase 1](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-excluded-proxy-contract-airdrop-phase-1/)\n- Intention-to-Submit Announcement: [Announcing Dharma’s Intention to Propose the Retroactive UNI Distribution](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/announcing-dharmas-intention-to-propose-the-retroactive-uni-distribution/7450)\n- Code: [https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/excluded-uni-airdrop-users](https://github.com/dharmaprotocol/excluded-uni-airdrop-users)\n- Contract: [RetroactiveMerkleDistributorPhaseOne](https://etherscan.io/address/0x967f2c0826af779a09e42eff7bfadad7618b55e5#code)\n- Merkle Root and claims: [phase-one-merkle-root-and-claims.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dharmaprotocol/excluded-uni-airdrop-users/master/merkle-roots-and-claims/phase-one-merkle-root-and-claims.json)\n\n## Description\n\nThis proposal brings to a formal vote the Retroactive Distribution, discussed at length in the above links.\n\nThis proposal retroactively distributes 400 UNI to 12,619 distinct addresses who interacted with Uniswap via a proxy contract. These 12,619 users are \"Phase 1\" of the Retroactive Distribution, encompassing users of application-integrations. All of these 12,619 addresses were excluded from the original airdrop.\n\nThe Phase determination was made based on how easy it is to programmatically hook a trading bot into them, as this is a proxy for what portion of these cohorts risk representing multiple addresses per end-user. Phase 1 is the less programmatically accessible cohort, indicating a lower likelihood of multiple addresses per end-user.\n\nSpecifically, this proposal transfers 5,047,600 UNI to a new MerkleDistributor contract, which will then allow for 400 UNI to be claimed by each of the 12,619 accounts held by users of the following projects:\n\n| Project    | Accounts | % of total |\n|------------|----------|------------|\n| Argent     | 3418     | 27.09%     |\n| DeFi Saver | 890      | 7.05%      |\n| Dharma     | 2833     | 22.45%     |\n| eidoo      | 301      | 2.39%      |\n| FURUCOMBO  | 57       | 0.45%      |\n| MEW        | 4278     | 33.90%     |\n| Monolith   | 19       | 0.15%      |\n| Nuo        | 740      | 5.86%      |\n| Opyn       | 79       | 0.63%      |\n| rebalance  | 4        | 0.03%      |\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n### 1. No Repeat Retroactive Airdrop Proposals\n\nDharma is committed to carrying out the Retroactive Airdrop proposal. This includes proposing Phase 1, and, if Phase 1 passes, proposing Phase 2.\n\nIf either Phase fails, we will accept that as the final determination of the Uniswap community. Should both Phases pass, we will not vote in favor of any further retroactive airdops.\n\n### 2. Dharma's Commitment to Uniswap Governance\n\nDharma is committed to being an active, engaged member of Uniswap governance, just as we have been in the Compound community.\n\nAs a signal of this commitment, if this proposal passes, we will commit to:\n- Giving Dharma users the ability to delegate their UNI holdings for voting, as well as to vote directly with their UNI holdings.\n- Participating in the development of a Uniswap Improvement Proposal (UIP) Process in collaboration with other engaged community members.",

      "title": "Reduce UNI Governance Proposal & Quorum Thresholds",
      "content": "Uniswap's governance system currently has high thresholds for proposal submission and quorum relative to total delegated UNI. Since the launch of the governance system, there have been [discussions](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-reduce-amount-of-unis-required-to-submit-governance-proposal/3320) on [lowering these thresholds](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-reduce-amount-of-unis-required-to-submit-governance-proposal/3320/29) to make governance more accessible.\n\nHaving followed these discussions from the beginning, Dharma has prepared a proposal that we think achieves the goal of making governance more accessible, while still ensuring that Uniswap governance is not subject to unilateral deleterious actors.  _We propose a threshold of 3m UNI for proposal submission, and 30m UNI as quorum._\n\nIn order to achieve this reduction in thresholds, a new `GovernorAlpha` contract is required. To that end, we have [deployed a new contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xeca491e162d157760f167c4dd92b45ae6e5cf0f1#code) which contains the following changes:\n- `quorumVotes` has been changed from `40_000_000e18` to `30_000_000e18`, i.e. from 4% to 3%.\n- `proposalThreshold` has been modified from `10_000_000e18` to `3_000_000e18`, i.e. from 1% to 0.3%.\n- a public `__acceptAdmin()` function has been added, allowing the contract to claim ownership over the `Timelock` contract once `setPendingAdmin` has been executed.\n- `timelock` and `uni` are now declared as `constant` instead of via assignment to storage slots during contract construction, as their values are not modifiable after deployment (and use of `immutable` would necessitate a major Solidity version bump and corresponding refactor of already well-audited code).\n\nWe believe this proposal will help foster a vibrant Uniswap governance process, and we are excited to participate in these governance decisions.",
