FWB FEST is the premier launching pad for crypto ecosystems and onchain products.\n\n### New Team Structure → Greater Organizational Efficiency\n\nAt the end of 2023 through the first two quarters of 2024, our community has continued to push for more transparency, greater output, and reduced expenditures.\n\nEach quarter, we have pushed the organization to get leaner to understand our core operating efficiency. Hiring a CMO and restructuring FEST-related roles to contractor work has improved our ability to execute on new projects and manage cash flow.\n\n### Financials\n\nOur team continues to push towards long-term sustainability and recurring revenue through strategic ongoing partnerships and FEST. Despite its scale, FEST maintains its profitability through careful management with an experienced team.\n\nSince the beginning of 2023, we have reduced our core monthly operating expenses by 71%.\n\nSince 2022, we have increased our revenue by 148%. Three quarters into 2024, we have already grown our total revenue by 36% since last year.\n\n### Token Migration\n\nIn June, our community approved a [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/0x8ad8cb4cd5b45699407c574055a0207f0712c0cb7b123a53164f34f6f1616cf6) to update our token ecosystem with the migration of $FWB to Base and the launch of a new arcade token $Benefits. This was the second most voted on proposal in the DAO’s history.\n\nWe worked with Squad and Hacken to develop an audited smart-contract and front-end to handle the $FWB to Base migration.\n\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeJ1_koG_ZJkoGLODWmYXINEnNhdt9F1BqB33-Ovb7cYAHWzXRPWGMZBBe2oW9CZnrTAiOZldpTTkCfNLewAgdW8tSyg8NNslAusnn8WTNIyFRjiwn6b86Vfmke9QbZ77NaANnstaBaY9PJd7k0i-lFYzN9?key=EidrVPuhNePD8IlxKQrRzw)![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe62Uttwa0Cjl-cOzu03NG0u1anOlEX-IZnnnsCVX9GJGaYSo4KjLoRegpqESUAmXtxO7PDfOWSeK4mDGXdR7qFwkCCP0Om35XpgGJsD2kG8maddsHmaKZI2yb8sLuhXMkZ-mM95gnoOAEnsgFN9g-p8MGI?key=EidrVPuhNePD8IlxKQrRzw)\n\n#### ✴ LP & PartyDAO\n\n\nA critical component of migrating $FWB to Base is deepening our liquidity. We have successfully crowdfunded [100 ETH on PartyDAO](https://base.party.app/party/0x8b557d73607328138f0bbcef1017949b7ab484cd) to support the migration. Contributors to the Party will receive a proportional amount of $Benefits.\n\n#### ✴ $Benefits\n\n\nWe see $Benefits as the cultural arcade token across existing onchain communities and brands entering their onchain era. We are exploring new use cases and rewards mechanisms for our community and beyond:\n\n  \n\n-   Permissionless rewards with Stack for members, onchain actors, and adjacent communities\n    \n-   A Towns  community for $Benefits holders and $Benefits powered communities\n    \n-   Friendslist, is a Craigslist-like classifieds dApp, powered with $Benefits and $FWB\n    \n\n#### ✴ Timeline\n\n  \n\nMid October 2024\n\nTown Hall on token migration process and $Benefits launch\n\n  \n\nLaunch of $Benefits and first $100M tranche deployed across Party contributors, proposal voters, FEST onchain actors, and $FWB token migrators\n\nLate October 2024\n\nLaunch of $FWB on Base and migration front-end\n\nEstablish LP\n\n \nWhile the audited smart-contracts for $FWB on Base and $Benefits along with the front-end to handle the $FWB to Base migration are ready to go, our timeline for the migration has been delayed in determining the best process and strategy for setting up a new LP.\n\n  \n\nAt this time, we ask that FWB members and holders sit tight as we get through the final pieces of launching the migration. We will share wider communications about the token migration in Discord, across our social channels, and in TL;DR as soon as possible. At this time, we plan to keep the token migration process open indefinitely to ensure that as many successful migrations of $FWB (ETH) to $FWB (Base).\n\n### FEST24\n\n  \n\nOur annual tentpole festival was a massive success with guests composed of crypto natives, creatives, and builders. FEST continues to work by capturing the broader cultural zeitgeist and blending it with integrated onchain partner activations that look and feel seamless (i.e. Zack Fox DJing while you buy a drink with Bend for preferred pricing.) Take our FEST24 survey [here](https://fwbfest.deform.cc/fest24survey).\n\nThe first year of BaseCamp added new energy to FEST, introducing 300+ Base ecosystem builders to our community and reified Base’s L2 launch at FEST23.\n\n\n    \n\n✴ Partners & Integrated Activations \n\nWe connected even more players in the ecosystem this year with 30+ onchain and cultural partners including: Base, ECO, Lukso, Uniswap, Worldcoin, Stellar Development Foundation, Lens, Livepeer, Metastreet, D3, SIC, Ace Hotel, Refraction, Optimism, IYK, Boys Club, Club Chess, Dirt, Creature World, and more.\n\n  \n\nWe are especially proud of our partner’s integrated activations at FEST. Highlights include Bend powered payments, SIC chat and notifications via Mesh, Lens aura photography booth, Stellar hammocks, Worldcoin gallery exhibit, Livepeer powered stream, and the IYK x OP scavenger hunt.\n\n#### ✴ Launchpad\n\n  \n\nFEST24 proved to be fertile ground for launching consumer-facing dApps and driving onchain actions.\n\n  \n\n-   SIC, our sister company, launched Mesh with 65% adoption and 100%  usage  for users onboarded.\n    \n\n  \n\n-   Bend by ECO powered payments across FEST with over 78% of all purchases made onchain. We worked closely with Bend before and during FEST to ensure vendors and guests felt comfortable with their product.\n    \n\n  \n\n-   The IYK x OP scavenger hunt drove 2,500+ onchain actions and the distribution of 10,000 OP to 35+ winners.\n    \n\n### Life After FEST\n\n  \n\n✴ Membership & Rebranding\n\nOur two major focuses in Q4 will be (1) refining the FWB membership flow with a move towards quarterly applications and (2) aligning our external brand with who we are now. Take our membership survey [here](https://app.deform.cc/form/5d59bda4-0d70-4e3b-8242-066b39b02a75/?page_number=0).\n\n  \n\nThese two work streams move hand in hand as we make our core offerings to our community and partners more explicit and clear. We are looking to expand member benefits and tap into the network of portfolio companies that may be interested in working with us.\n\n### Partnerships\n\n  \n\nWe have several key partnerships in the works through Q4 and into 2025:\n\n  \n\n-   A joint venture with Publicis Group to co-own self-service onchain tooling and co-develop a tech stack pipeline\n    \n-   4th iteration of our international gallery show with Worldcoin at Aleph in Argentina\n    \n-   Official FWB TLD domain + token buybacks incentives with D3\n    \n-   Artist-in-residence  program with Ace Hotel, Superchief, Zora, and Base\n    \n-   Official onchain community and partner for SCOPE Miami with dedicated main stage programming and an exhibition space to offer our partners (similar to how we activated at Consensus)\n    \n-   Showcase at Token2049 with Refraction and other partners\n    \n\n-   TWAMM Hook implementation for $FWB in collaboration with Uniswap\n    \n\n## Q4 Takeaways\n\n### Growth Focus\n\n  \n\nAs we continue to grow FWB as the cultural arm for web3, our focus on where we apply our efforts continues to sharpen. Our extensive research into the space has led us to conclude that FWB is uniquely positioned to solve the cold start problem for many protocols and dApps in the space. As such, we are refining the types of projects & partnerships we will be working on in the coming months ahead of FEST.\n\n  \n\n-   Special Projects: working with industry leaders, emergent protocols and companies, FWB will build bespoke projects and incubators to highlight key features, PMF & use cases while providing opportunities for our members to gain first access, alpha & benefits.\n    \n-   TL;DR: We’re developing ad inventory for TL;DR as a source of ongoing revenue in addition to providing 1) a low stakes entry point for new partners, and 2) an additional offering for existing partners. [View the sales deck here](https://pitch.com/v/fwb-tldr-izhz8i).\n    \n\n#### Operations and Financials\n\n  \n\n-   As of Q4 2024, FWB has approximately 18 months of runway.\n    \n\n-   One important factor here is the 30% dip in ETH since the beginning of Q3 2024.\n    \n\n-   Core has reduced its overall operating budget by 13% and recurring contributor expenses by 7.6%.\n    \n-   Core projects roughly $75K in additional gross partnership revenue for Q4 as there will be a shift to lining up new projects for Q1 ‘25 and internal projects through the end of the year.\n    \n-   Core will monitor profitability as the end of the year approaches for considerations around tax liability, remove Kyler W. As administer and make Administrator Solutions our Registered Agent, and have ability to move funds from DAO multi-sig to C-Corp multi-sig\n\n## **_Proposal adapted here due to character limit.

      "title": "Love Fest at Fest 2024, an impact activations constellation",
      "content": "#### Abstract\nLove Fest at FWB Fest 2024 includes an Impact Fund, to be distributed to a philanthropic organization, chosen by the FWB community, and an Impact Session, with discussions around ways to improve how we actually do the work to improve people’s lives.\n\n### Authors\n**Bruxa**: Dedicated to wine, Earth Healing, and reciprocity, Bruxa currently produces programming and education for Endaoment.org and co-created Thirsty Thirsty, a food & wine DAO. She is the child of her ancestors, and deeply informed by her Tupinambá heritage.  \n  \n**BorrowLucid**: While raising her son in the Wild West, Christina is building Chones and nurturing the Infinite Garden.\n\n  \n\n### Motivation\n\n  \n\n-   Demonstrate how impact can be woven into everything we do and make.\n    \n-   Cross-pollinate intentionally, so that it’s easy for the community to bring together knowledge and experience to improve how we care for humanity.\n    \n-   Fest is so ripe with connection, imagine what we could do together when we focus on impact.\n    \n-   Fundraise for community selected orgs in an innovative, onchain way that facilitates genuine impact (aka money) for nonprofits\n   \n### Impact on FWB Community\n\n  \n\nWith an Impact Fund integrated in Fest, FWB will be able to demonstrate valuable metrics on how the community is genuinely giving back and acting with the highest intentions.\n\nWith Impact sessions during Fest, experts in the impact and public goods space will bring their knowledge and experience into conversations throughout the entire festival, giving meaningful perspective to FWB members.\n\nSince FWB has demonstrated more success with fulfillment than some of the impact communities have, when FWB members choose to collaborate with impact initiatives, it is expected that these initiatives will see more success, of which metrics the DAO can use as validation when potential partners are considering sponsorship ROI.\n\n### Overview\nLove Fest is a combination of an Impact Fund and a collection of Impact Sessions. The Impact Fund will come from a percentage of ticket sales and will be distributed to a non profit of the DAO’s choosing and facilitated onchain by Endaoment. The Impact Session will include topics around public goods, impact and intention, and will occur in a similar setting as Required Reading.\n\nIf you would like to contribute to Love Fest, please message in the forum thread in FWB Discord.\n\n  \n\n### Details\n\n  \n\nImpact Fund:\n\n  \n\n1.  $5,000 from Fest ticket sales will go into a fund.\n    \n2.  The fund will be donated to [Nour Charitable Society](https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/210cd923-47dd-b302-e1cf-b682b352139e) - Founded in 2015 in the West Bank, NCS works to rehabilitate disabled Palestinian women and children. Due to the current crisis, their work has shifted to civilian medical aid.\n    \n\n  \n\n### Impact Session:\n\n  \n\n**Title**: Love Fest: Gather for Good\n\n **Description**: A panel discussion about harnessing the power of gathering together to remedy that intent does not equal impact. Gathering is the highest form of coordination. Hear from builders engaging onchain tooling to generate tangible results for IRL communities.\n\n  **Speakers**: \n\nLauNaMu](https://x.com/0xyNaMu): Zuzalu and Optimism, Founder of MetricsGarden Labs and Wagmi Latam\n\n*Status: confirmed*  \n  \n\n[Bruxa](https://x.com/0xbruxa): Dedicated to wine, Earth Healing, and reciprocity, Bruxa currently produces programming and education for Endaoment.org and co-created Thirsty Thirsty, a food & wine DAO. She is the child of her ancestors, and deeply informed by her Tupinambá heritage.\n\n*Status: confirmed*\n\n  \n\n[Robbie Heeger](https://x.com/robbieheeger): President and CEO of Endaoment, the first 501(c)3 nonprofit and Community Foundation to be entirely powered by blockchain. Heeger is a self-taught software engineer who created Endaoment after spending seven years working for Apple's media products division.\n\n*Status: confirmed*\n\n  \n\nJosh Phelps: FWB Council, World Central Kitchen and other NGOs\n\n*Status: tbd*  \n  \nModerator: [BorrowLucid](https://warpcast.com/borrowlucid.eth): while raising her son in the Wild West, Christina is building Chones, writing freelance and nurturing the infinite garden.\n\n*Status: confirmed*\n\n  \n\n### Discussion\n\n  \n\nFest is this amazing experience for a lot of people to connect and celebrate, but it's missing this very important piece that we need to always consider as members of humanity on our planet.\n\nAdding an impact session is not an enormous cost, especially since the infrastructure is already there and so are the voices. It’s about coordination. It also adds a bit more validity to Fest, to ensure it's not just a party or a shill fest. Fest stretches beyond pay to play. The more we bring innovators, in power and access, together with those who are doing the grassroots work, or have the relationships on the ground, the sooner we can arrive at meaningful systems. We want to move beyond intention and generate actual impact.\n\n  \n\n### Outcomes & Success Measurements\n\n  \n\n-   Donation amount\n    \n-   Number of organizations present at Fest and participating in Love Fest\n    \n-   Number of new collaborations between FWB and impact initiatives\n    \n\n  \n\n### Looking Forward\n\nIdeally, there is an Impact Fund and Sessions at every Fest. We can review this first iteration, consider whether it is worth repeating and make improvements for subsequent years.\n\n  \n\n### Timeline\n\n  \n\n**May 2024**\n\n-   Open discussion for potential non profit organizations to receive donations.\n    \n-   Coordinate speakers for Impact session\n    \n-   Coordinate space with Fest team for Impact session and fund\n    \n\n**June 2024**\n\n-   FWB members signal vote on which organization will receive the donations\n    \n-   Confirm speakers for Impact session\n    \n\n**July 2024**\n\n-   Coordinate with non profit organization, including non profit status, ability to receive crypto and participation in an Impact session.\n    \n\n-   Note: NCS attendance is unlikely, considering a lack of time to arrive in Idyllwild and the urgency of their mission where they are located.\n    \n\n-   Final coordination for Impact session\n    \n\n**August 2024**\n\n-   Fest!\n    \n-   Distribute Impact fund to non profit organization\n    \n-   Impact Session\n    \n-   Collect and review data",

      "title": "Updating FWB Token Ecosystem",
      "content": "**Focus**: $FWB L2 Migration and $Benefits Token Launch\n\n**Author**: Greg Bresnitz & Jose Meija\n\n**Objective**: This proposal details the strategic migration of the $FWB token from the Ethereum Mainnet to Base Layer 2 and the introduction of a new token, $Benefits, which will serve as a utility-focused arcade coin within the FWB ecosystem.\n\n**Rationale**: Evolve the FWB ecosystem by migrating to a trusted L2 that offers more affordable transactions, easier onboarding, and strategic alignment with the future of how consumers will interact with blockchains. Introduce a new token into the FWB ecosystem that serves as a medium of exchange between ecosystem participants.\n\n**Timeline**: The migration process is scheduled to begin at the end of Q2 2024, with preliminary steps to be initiated immediately following approval.\n**Conflicts of Interest**: None identified thus far.\n\n**Objective**\nThis proposal outlines the strategic migration of the $FWB token from Ethereum Mainnet to Base Layer 2, coupled with the introduction of a new token, $Benefits. The focus of this proposal is on enhancing utility, reducing costs, and expanding capabilities within the FWB ecosystem.\n\n **Goals**\n1.  $FWB Migration to Base: The migration is designed to future-proof the token within the evolving blockchain landscape, maintaining its role as a governance token. Transitioning $FWB to Base L2 will capitalize on lower transaction fees and improved scalability.    \n2.  New $Benefits Token: Introducing the $Benefits token for use within the FWB ecosystem. As an arcade token (see Appendix A), $Benefits facilitates transactions within the FWB universe, such as exchange of goods, accessing services, and participating in community events, thereby enhancing the vibrancy and engagement of the FWB community.\n \n**Technical Approach**\nFWB will work with [Squad](https://squadtalent.xyz/) to build the smart contract for migrating the existing $FWB token from Ethereum Mainnet to Base L2 and launch the new $Benefits token.\n\nSee Appendix B for overview.\n\n*Smart Contract Migration*\n    \n1.  Develop new smart contracts compatible with the Base environment.\n2.  Implement comprehensive testing to ensure functionality and security on Base.\n\n*Token Swap Mechanism*    \n1.  Create a seamless token swap mechanism for holders to convert their Ethereum-based $FWB tokens to Base L2 $FWB tokens.\n2.  This will involve a one-time swap event where users send their Ethereum L1 $FWB tokens to a designated smart contract that will then issue the equivalent amount of recapped Base L2 $FWB tokens.\n\n*Smart Contract for New Token*\n1.  Develop a smart contract that allows for minting of the new $Benefits token, with no cap, on Base.\n2.  Creation of a multi-sig that will allow tokens to be minted & distributed at regular intervals.\n  \n *Infrastructure and Security*\n1.  Set up the necessary infrastructure on Base L2 to support the new token’s operations.\n2.  Conduct a full-scale security audit of new smart contracts to ensure the safety and integrity of the migration process.\n\n*Community Engagement and Support*\n1.  Launch an informational campaign to educate the community about the benefits and procedures involved in the migration & new token.\n2.  Set up a dedicated support channel to assist users during the migration process & launch process.\n    \n*Post-Migration Monitoring*\n1.  Monitor the migration process closely to handle any issues promptly.\n2.  Ensure continuous engagement with the community to gather feedback and provide updates on post-migration improvements.\n    \n**Why Base?**\nMigrating the $FWB token to Base Layer 2 offers significant advantages by addressing critical challenges associated with the Ethereum Mainnet. Primarily, this transition will dramatically reduce transaction fees and enhance processing speeds, making participation in the FWB ecosystem more cost-effective and efficient for all holders.\n\nOur decision to migrate $FWB to Base is not motivated by direct incentives but by a strategic and beneficial partnership. Base has been a steadfast ally to FWB, deeply aligning with our vision and consistently supporting our community engagement efforts. This existing relationship brings a level of ease and familiarity to the transition, making Base a natural choice for our needs.\nFurthermore, Base not only matches our technical requirements but also resonates with our community's ethos and long-term goals. Their commitment to fostering blockchain adoption and creating an accessible, user-friendly environment aligns with our ambition to see widespread, mainstream use.\nPartnering with Base offers the potential for retroactive funding through initiatives such as Optimism’s (OP), which could provide significant financial support for further development. This opportunity enhances our capability to innovate and expand within the FWB ecosystem, underscoring the strategic benefits of our collaboration with Base.\n\n**Bridging vs Migration**\nThe decision against implementing a standard bridging solution for the $FWB token migration stems from our conviction that the future of consumer-facing applications and ecosystems will predominantly reside on L2 solutions. We anticipate that all significant activity and value exchanges will occur on L2s, negating the need to maintain a presence or use case for $FWB on the Ethereum mainnet. This strategic choice ensures that resources and community focus are streamlined and fully transitioned to the more efficient and scalable L2 environment.\n\n### $FWB Recapitalization\nSupply recapitalization to 10M.\n\n **History**\nThe original $FWB token was launched as a 10M supply token via smart contracts created by the platform Roll. The Roll contracts were hacked, leading to the creation of a new $FWB token that was issued with a max supply of 1M. The shift from 10M tokens to 1M tokens at that time had interesting implications for FWB DAO – a tighter supply of tokens meant that gaining access to the community was, theoretically, even more scarce than it had been before, so long as the community continued to operate under the meta of seasonal updates to the token gating requirement for the Discord server. The 1M cap also represented a distinction from other common social token projects from the same era that FWB launched within, most of which operated under the assumption that 10M tokens was the prevailing ‘correct’ approach for supply.\n\n**Recapping Benefits**\nReturning to the original supply cap of 10 million $FWB tokens is pivotal for fostering inclusivity and engagement within the FWB ecosystem. A controlled supply recap facilitates this by ensuring the tokens are accessible and actively circulated, thereby encouraging new memberships and enhancing participation in the DAO's governance.\n\n**Membership**\nMembership will move to 750 L2 $FWB. Q3 will be a major focus for the future of membership and this will be discussed & reviewed along with bigger visions.\n\n**Discord Access**\nStarting with migration, both L1 $FWB & L2 $FWB will grant access to discord. On October 15th, 2024 FWB Discord access will only be for L2 $FWB. There will be an extensive marketing campaign around this.\n\n**Indefinite Migration**\nThe migration will be open indefinitely allowing token holders to swap at any time.\n\n**$Benefits Token: Driving Innovation in the FWB Ecosystem**\nThe creation of the $Benefits token represents a strategic expansion within the FWB ecosystem, designed to complement the existing $FWB token. As an arcade token (see Appendix A), $Benefits facilitates transactions within the FWB ecosystem, such as exchange of goods, accessing services, and participating in community events, thereby enhancing the vibrancy and engagement of the FWB community.\n\nDistribution of this new token will be governed by $FWB holders, ensuring that its evolution is in line with the community's interests. The introduction of $Benefits serves to diversify the activities within the FWB ecosystem, creating a more interactive environment that encourages both current members and new participants to engage more deeply with community-aligned projects and initiatives.\n\n-   Decentralized Governance: Governed by $FWB holders, decisions about the distribution of $Benefits reflect community interests, ensuring alignment with the ecosystem’s values and growth objectives.\n    \n-   Incentives for Innovation: Developers and users creating dApps for discovering new uses for $Benefits could be eligible to receive retroactive rewards, encouraging significant contributions and ongoing development.\n    \n-   Ecosystem Use Cases: Applicable across various activities including SIC products, community participation, and event attendance.\n \n$Benefits is explicitly designed for use solely within the FWB ecosystem, with no intended external market. It serves to reward member contributions, facilitating access and participation within the community.\n\n## ***Proposal adapted here due to character limit.

      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThe updated Road to FEST:NYC (with new venue and reduced budget) aims to channel the energy and experience of FEST into a special event in July for the benefit of our New York City-based members (& friends).\n\n### Goals:\n\n-   Throw a highly curated, FEST-inspired party with outstanding talent and a unique venue for FWB members to gather and celebrate the music, ideas, and company of our community members and friends and get everyone excited to reunite in the mountains.\n    \n-   Introduce FWB to potential members, with the added benefit of increasing awareness of FEST, which is still unknown to many.\n    \n\n-   Note: This is NOT intended to be simply a FEST marketing tool– the synergistic branding reflects the inspiration behind the creative direction/programming; any value/attention driven to FEST is a secondary benefit, but not the primary goal.\n    \n\n### Why isn’t this an Event Key? (Quick recap):\n\nA larger-scale version of this event at a bigger venue was initially submitted as an Event Key, but the budget was too high for the program. Based on advice from the community council and core team, it was adapted and put to vote as a proposal to use funds from the event key program and Treasury, which did not pass due to a few members' opposition to the size of budget being asked of the Treasury.\n\n  \n\nFollowing community feedback, a new, more intimate venue has been secured, which has drastically reduced the budget/upfront costs, and the event was re-submitted as an event key. However, the Community Council decided that because the previous version of this event was put forward as a proposal, this updated event-key size version should also be put to vote as a proposal as well.\n\n  \n\nTo the members collaborating with me and supporting this labor of love, you have my sincerest gratitude, and look forward to partying with you!\n\n### Logistics:\n\n**UPDATED Where:  [Dead Letter no. 9](https://www.deadletterno9.com/)\n**UPDATED When:  July 13, from 7pm-4 am\n\nWho: Up to 250-350 attendees including FWB members and non-members\n\nHow: Public, ticketed / free for FWB Members\n\n  \n\nWho is proposing this: NYC-based artist/DJ, event promoter, and 2xFEST attendee Brendan Donovan (@brendandonovan / Brendan-Bastion) with the support and guidance from FWB core & FEST teams, the Community Council, and member-collaborators including Nia antisocialite, Senaerya, JHarmony43, Paul Devro, izgnzlz, jzstern, etc.\n\n  \n\nBrendan has produced a number of events at NYC clubs and is close with promoters who can support the marketing and media efforts alongside the artist/DJs, venue, partner orgs, local newsletters, and potential sponsors (tbc).\n\n### Key Features of Road to Fest:NYC\n\n#### **NEW LOCATION:  [Dead Letter No.9](https://www.deadletterno9.com/) (300 cap).\n\nA new “conversation parlor” with back room dancefloor equipped with an excellent sound system. Features immersive rooms designed to feel like you’re camping outdoors, on a cabin porch, etc, designed by creative director of Sleep No More, the long-running immersive theater show. It is conveniently located in Williamsburg near the Bedford Ave L train stop.\n\n  \n\nThe immersive “scenic environment” rooms provide a clear and intentional connection to the vibe of FEST– Members can get down on the dancefloor, wander into the next room and “touch grass” under a starry night sky.\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/PQ6pMdMp5BpinHxB4Azeg_omdSiY4qwpO8bMkXBlicG1ojEWwBYPn64ijyd7c7B61-zTRT_LYcRhi-bs8EYBTEEpH379yeQ1ueModN11JMrxz5xV7vlqG3fnRvpqibglhYmBZoao6ZlmUo4otllArH4)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/kc6anosNRq516NyoCheo6u4EnxBWmGEkoSGy55-tcoTVON19wsDOz9urjAUtvjdFCrURsz_1X6MKWSgdi00YoJ0LyHtYIKhQNWt0YL3KcDNE-DJXLZRnIizpqV_0_W88BJa-Sv3nrfVGbagVFD12NsY)\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/V7BZOXyC4Hoz7ZQkiyQ84CAqd4eR_dlGCTSg-NaXHSdo64XuohvtIQiYr1K2PWu24e-0IXjjKv-XKZHUZXlbZWDmVHOT-9TSzYujEGSpow1vJKaDQXy4m-FsJsTgGn6YmfqPmVqXxnOFmv0_pPUU2DY)\n\n  \n\n### Programming\n\nSchedule (subject to change, but not by much)\n\n7pm Doors/mingling\n\n7:30pm Panel curated by New Internet City (Nia)\n\n8:30ish Panel ends, mingling & music\n\n10pm DJ sets (official, ticketed event starts)\n\n4am close\n\n  \n\nProgramming will feature FWB members and prioritize diversity and inclusion across all programming.\n\n#### Panel Discussion curated by New Internet City Nia (@anti.socialite)\n\nPlanned topic: Designing productions for digital communities\n\nLogistics: As it stands, in order to boost attendance & bar sales, we plan for the Panel to be free to attend and will be curated in collaboration with Nia (@anti.socialite)’s New Internet City. We hope to feature some of our local members and the projects they’re building. Members & ticket holders will receive a wristband at the door. Non-members without tickets will have to buy a ticket or leave before 10pm (this is the current plan but is subject to change).\n\n#### Music\n\nDJ sets will include opening sets by FWB DJs and two “headline” artists one might expect to see near the top of a FEST lineup. We will aim to book at least 50% women/non-binary/POC artists across the music lineup and among the headliners.\n\n  \n\nMusic Programming (subject to change)\n\nJubilee, *Paul Devro, *Bastion, *Senaerya, *JHarmony, etc\n\nOther DJs: Arielle NYC (Heads Know), Hai Life (Femme House)\n\n  \n\n*=FWB member\n\n### **UPDATED** Budget for Road to Fest:NYC\n\nThe total funding requested for this event is $3,000,  funded by the Events Key Program.\n\n  \n\nHigh level budget breakdown:\n\n$6,100 Talent booking total\n\n$250 Door person\n\n$500 Misc Expendables (event photography, flyer design/print, talent riders)\n\n  \n\n**Upfront Costs/Deposits\n\n$2,250 Talent booking upfront deposits\n\n$250 Door person\n\n$500 Misc Expendables (event photography, flyer design/print, hospitality/talent riders)\n\n  \n\nTotal Upfront Costs: $3,000\n\n-   Funded by Events Key program\n    \n-   I will assume any additional upfront costs myself.\n    \n-   will be seeking sponsors, but do not need them.\n    \n\nRemaining Costs: $3,850\n\n-   Paid out from ticket revenue\n    \n\n#### **UPDATED Payout Terms:\n\nImmediate delivery of total requested funds ($3,000) to Brendan Donovan (Event Organizer) to help cover the upfront costs. Funds may be sent in USDC, or USD (zelle/venmo). Any conversion or transfer fees will be paid for by the sender, i.e. Event Organizer must receive the full amount requested.\n\nVenue Deal structure:\n\nVenue guaranteed minimum bar sales: $6,500  (remainder taken from ticket sales if not reached)\n\nVenue takes 20% of ticket sales above $6,000\n\nPromoter takes 20% of bar sales above $6,500 (assuming zero)\n\nAssuming we reach bar minimum & sell 250 tickets\n\nEstimated gross revenue after venue take (ticket sales only): $7,480\n\nEstimated Net profit:  $3,630\n\n-   Subject to change based on actual revenue and any additional costs incurred\n    \n\n**UPDATED  Profit sharing: Profit from this event will be shared among the Organizers to compensate for their time and labor. By removing guaranteed compensation, we have reduced the upfront budget and further incentivized the organizers to pull off a successful event.\n\nEvent Organizer will provide a PnL report to the DAO, the timing of which depends upon venue payout for percentage of bar sales (if any). This report will provide useful data to other members who wish to organize events of their own.\n\n### Event Schedule & Other Details\n\n(Exact timing subject to change)\n\n7pm  - doors, digital art gallery, mingling\n\n7:30pm - Panel / Discussion\n\n8:30pm - Panel ends, more mingling & time to grab dinner before music.\n\n9:30pm - DJ sets\n\n4am - close\n\n  \n\nTickets will be priced in 3 tiers, with most tickets sold between $30-40. FWB members get free RSVP (no +1s). There will be a limited number of guest list spots for artists and any sponsors.\n\n### Expectations of Core Team:\n\n-   referrals to potential partners, as needed, and at their discretion\n    \n-   Typical Event Key marketing support including a normal amount of posts on FWB socials & newsletter\n\n \n![Screenshot 2024-05-27 at 2.27.51 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreiadh6qpwdpmjsj2izeows4pgktwmryzvdy4qzahcf6kbwejmiacva)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUPDATED** The Community Council has left this up to the community to decide because a previous, larger-scale version of this event was previously put forward as a proposal.\n\nThis new and improved Proposal will not cost the Treasury anything outside of what has already been allocated to the Event Key program for events exactly like this.**\n\nRoad to FEST:NYC is a member-led initiative that will provide value to NYC-based members and friends and to reestablish FWB as the premiere social DAO in NYC through an exceptional, thoughtfully curated event inspired by FEST. It will also help expand our reach and awareness by inviting non-members.\n\nThis event will get everyone excited to reunite in the mountains of Idyllwild, ease the FOMO of those who can’t attend FEST, and remind everyone why FWB is such a valuable community. It will also establish a new ally/host for future FWB events at Dead Letter No.9.\n\nThank you for supporting this initiative, and I hope to see you on the Road to FEST (and/or FEST itself)!",

      "content": "### Abstract\n\nThe unanimous passing of [FWB FEST ‘24 Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/0x67ecfbec887f75df83594ac2c7fc52850dd44723823f4b878436a396601f088a) reestablished FEST as core to our identity as a collective and the most pure expression of our values, talents, and mission as a community and drivers of culture.\n\n  \nRoad to FEST:NYC aims to channel the energy and experience of FEST into a nine hours long multimedia event in one of our main hubs: New York City.\n\n#### The goals of this event are threefold:\n\n-   First, to provide a curated space for FWB members to gather and celebrate the art, ideas, and company of our community members and friends.\n    \n-   Second, to introduce and welcome newcomers into the FWB community.\n    \n-   Third, to support the marketing efforts of FEST24.\n    \n\n  \n\n#### Why a standalone proposal:\n\nThis event was originally proposed as an Event Key and reviewed by the Community Council; but the scope/budget surpassed the Event Key limit, so after consulting with the Council and Mayor Greg Bresnitz, it was determined that this should be put to the community as a standalone governance proposal to gain permission to use treasury funds to cover the remainder of the budget beyond the Event Keys program limit.\n\n  \n\ni.e. Funds from the Event Keys Program up to $3,000 will be put towards this event (as they normally would for an event of smaller scope), and the remainder (about $7,500) will be borrowed from the FWB Treasury, with an expectation of recouping from ticket sales. Find more on the budget below.\n\n### Logistics:\n\nWhere:  [H0l0](https://h0l0.nyc/)\n\nWhen: Friday, June 28, from 7pm-4am\n\nWho: Up to 450 attendees including FWB members and non-members\n\nHow: Free with RSVP for FWB Members (no +1s), ticketed for non-members\n\n  \n\nWho is proposing this: NYC-based FWB member, artist/DJ, event promoter, and 2xFEST attendee Brendan Donovan (brendandonovan or Brendan-Bastion on Discord) with support from the FWB Community Council, FWB core & FEST teams, and fellow member/volunteers including Senaerya, Justin Harmony, Cherie Hu, etc. Brendan has produced a number of events at NYC clubs in the past and is close with a number of promoter crews who can provide marketing and media support for this event. He will operate transparently in all matters and will continue to work closely with the core team to help ensure the success of this event.\n\nThis is a member-led initiative. DAO magic in action!\n\n### Key Focuses of Road to Fest:NYC\n\nThis event aims to channel the core elements that make FEST so special & successful:\n\n#### Location\n\nNestled between the culturally vibrant Bushwick (Brooklyn) and the diverse Latin-x neighborhood of Ridgewood (Queens), H0l0 strikes a perfect balance between convenience and “destination” for a venue. It’s two blocks away from the Halsey L train stop– easy to reach, yet a respectable distance from Work Island (Manhattan). Being close to the cultural heart of the city (Brooklyn) helps to attract a more diverse and like-minded audience.\n\n  \n\nH0l0 is an excellent venue with 2 rooms, an outdoor courtyard, and a hipster-italian restaurant located above it. The main room is designed for “boiler-room style” DJ sets with the crowd surrounding the booth and excellent sound no matter where you stand. The side room has cushioned seating and a sound system of its own.\n\n#### Programming\n\nProgramming will include a pop-up digital art gallery, an intimate panel/discussion, and DJ sets until 4am. We will prioritize featuring FWB members and diversity and inclusion across all programming.\n\n##### Digital Art Gallery\n\nThe art gallery can feature digital (and perhaps physical) works by artists in FWB and other artists exploring web3 and emerging tech. We are exploring working with partners who could support the production and curation of the gallery.\n\n#### Panel Discussion\n\nThe panel will be free to attend and focus on a theme at the intersection of tech and culture, and will be organized and curated in collaboration with one or two partner organizations, including Nia (@anti.socialite)’s New Internet City, in which case the discussion may focus on designing products for digital communities, which would allow us to feature some of our local members building exciting projects.\n\n##### Music\n\nDJ sets will include opening sets by FWB DJs and two “headline” artists one might expect to see near the top of a FEST lineup. We will aim to book at least 50% women/non-binary/POC artists across the music lineup and among the headliners.\n\n#### People\n\nOne of the best things about FEST is the people it brings together. We will encourage FWB member attendance by tapping into our talented membership for programming and by offering free attendance for FWB members. All programming and marketing efforts for the event will be carefully curated and designed to reach and attract like-minded individuals who will appreciate and contribute to the “FEST-like” vibe.\n\n### Proposed Budget for Road to Fest:NYC\n\nThe total proposed budget for this event is $11,500. Funding is to be provided as follows:\n\n-   $3,000 from Event Keys program\n    \n-   $7,500 from FWB Treasury\n    \n\n  \n\nWe expect to recoup the $7,500 provided by the Treasury  primarily from ticket sales & merch.\n\nAll revenue will be returned to the Treasury minus a 10% fee on profit after FWB Treasury recoups to compensate member organizers & volunteers for their time & effort.\n\n  \n\nHigh level budget breakdown:\n\nTalent: $4,950\n\nVenue Staff Fee: $3,000\n\nContingency/cushion for bar guarantee: $2,000\n\n-   (Venue bar guarantee: $6,000)\n    \n\nCompensation for organizers for time spent pulling this together: $1,000\n\nMerch creation/shipping: $300\n\n  \n  \n\nEstimated total revenue: $16,050\n\nEstimated net profit for FWB Treasury (after recoup & fee): $7,695\n\n\n### Event Schedule & Other Details\n\n(Exact timing subject to change)\n\n7pm  - doors, digital art gallery, mingling (Full venue, mainly courtyard, 1 bar open)\n\n7:30pm - Partner Panel / Discussion (Side or Main room)\n\n8:30pm - Panel ends, more mingling & time to grab dinner before music.\n\n9:30pm - DJ sets begin in the main room (Side room available to hang out & chat.)\n\n4am - close\n\n  \n\nTickets will be priced in 3 tiers, with most tickets sold between $30-40. FWB members & organizers get free RSVP (no +1s). There will be a limited number of guest list spots for partner orgs.\n\n  \n\n### Expectations of Core Team:\n\n-   Referrals to potential partners, as needed, and at their discretion\n    \n-   Marketing support including a normal amount of posts on FWB socials & newsletter\n    \n-   Delivery of treasury funds (per the above). Transfer method and timing TBD.\n    \n-   Exploration/assistance offering discount tickets for FEST for attendees\n![Screenshot 2024-05-17 at 08.07.02.png](ipfs://bafkreids252b3s4hdmz2y5kfj7kuky3eofudqm32qdn67r2xrz2ytf43h4)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nRoad to FEST:NYC is a member-led initiative to reestablish FWB as the premiere social DAO in NYC through a dynamic and exceptional event that channels the magic and cultural relevance of FEST that will also encourage FEST attendance as well.\n\nRoad to FEST:NYC will provide value to NYC-based members and friends by bringing together local artist, tech, and nightlife communities and offer a proper (re)introduction to our community for our friends and newcomers.\n\n\nAnyone who attends FEST understands how special and unique it is. Road to FEST:NYC will stand above a typical club night, gallery, or panel by combining the best of all 3; it will remind everyone why FWB is such a valuable community and hopefully establish a new ally/host for future FWB programming at H0l0.\n\nThank you for supporting this member-led initiative, and we’ll see you on the Road to FEST!! :)",

      "title": "We Them Media @ETHDenver        ",
      "content": "Authors: Maceo, Sirsu\n\nPast work: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@Wetheminthe3d) | [Zora](https://zora.co/wethemniggas.eth) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WeThemNMedia)\n\n### The Problem\n\nMany people of color in finance and technology find these industries inaccessible. In a world where individuals often feel commodified, the need to highlight the contributions and perspectives of people of color in web3 is pressing. Despite increased representation, their work is often overlooked, and finding supportive communities can be challenging. Our initiative aims to bridge this gap by showcasing individuals at ETHDenver 2024 during Black History Month. We aim to inform people of color in web3 about supportive communities like ours, amplifying their voices and connecting them with wider audiences.\n\n\n### Solution\nOur solution involves leveraging our platform to spotlight the contributions of people of color at ETHDenver 2024. Through collaboration with 40 Acres DAO and FWB, we will document and amplify the stories of black builders and other marginalized individuals, providing them with visibility and recognition within the web3 space. By showcasing these voices, we aim to empower individuals, educate wider audiences, and foster greater diversity and inclusion within the industry.\n\n### Objective\n\nMy goal at ETHDenver is to present ETHDenver to my audience through the perspective of black folx by doing interviews with black attendees. Further being that Sirsu’s expertise in esports and mine is more in meta-labeling, we'll provide valuable insights for FWB's editorial content while highlighting black builders and FWB-related events. We'll also support 40 Acres DAO by documenting the hacker house Russell, Co-Founder of 40Acres DAO, is programming for the NEAR Blockchain. I will be doing interviews with black developers at this hacker house during the potluck and brunch Russell is organizing there. Additionally, the event Russell is organizing there is called [Vibe Check](https://partiful.com/e/ppbYTnAUF897Mjr0rBoD).\n\n  \n  \n\n### Production Schedule\n\n  \n\nFebruary 28-March 3:\n\n-   Record 10 - 12 interviews on the ground at events throughout conference weekend. These interviews will be 15-20 minutes long and provide a small overview of how different black people found their way into web3, what made them decide to come to ETHDenver 2024, and a core memory on their crypto journey.\n    \n-   Additionally, I will be documenting the 40 Acres potluck on 2/29 at 7pm and completing interviews with 40 Acres Community Members and Black Devs Here.\n    \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n**10 Interviewees Confirmed**: Russ (Cofounder of 40 Acres), Ugo (40 Acres Member), Sance (Educator in 40 Acres DAO), Julian (Camera man on this trip and We Them Media Community Moderator), Trav (Founder of Webbie), Stefen Delevaux, Sirsu+Maceo (together), Carlos, Elo(40 Acres), Triplea (Afropolitan Citizen) & more still pending confirmation.\n\n  \n\n**Planned Deliverables**: April 30th with one week turn around for public release\n\n1.  10-12 interviews with black people at ETH Denver sharing about their experience in web3.\n    \n2.  A written article highlighting these interviews, events we attended and overarching themes of our trip for Mirror and FWB editorial.\n    \n3.  NFT Collection with photos and videos from the trip like Behind the Scenes Content\n    \n\n  \n\n**Post Production Timeline**\n\n1.  Denver Blog post drafted by March 12th.\n    \n2.  Reviewing Branding on demo content by Linda on March 12th.\n    \n3.  Post Production Completed by April 12th.\n    \n4.  Copy for all Content Generated by April 19th.\n    \n5.  Blog Post Finalized April 30th.\n    \n\n**Marketing Timeline**\n\n1.  Content Available on Zora May 6th.\n    \n2.  Article Minted April 6th.\n    \n3.  Interviews are live on Youtube by April 6th.\n    \n4.  Twitter Space April 6th noon est to Celebrate the release!\n    \n5.  FWB Discord Presentation Week of April 6th.\n    \n6.  Reels promoting the project are posted 2x a week(Wednesday & Friday) on instagram & tik-tok.\n    \n7.  BTS Content posted on instagram every monday.\n    \n\n  \n  \n\n**Validation for the Team**\n\nOur deep-rooted connections with 40 Acres DAO and experience in media production make us the ideal candidates for this initiative. With a proven track record of amplifying voices within web3, we're equipped to effectively showcase the contributions of people of color at ETHDenver. As such, we are proposing to partner with 40 Acres, a growing community focused on creating self-sustaining communities of color using blockchain in which I am deeply involved, as well as FWB to document the voices, faces and stories of people of color at ETHDenver.\n\n  \n\n**Team Members**\n\nMaceo: Project Lead and Interviewer 1\nSirsu: Interviewer 2 and Subject Matter Expert\nJulian: Camera Man\nLinda: Interview Video Editor\n\n\n[Budget Proposal:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14_tfxjiJTPpe6dTjWSDv9E0uW_efIRVeaM6kF3MQGuI/edit?usp=sharing) $8650\n\nIf the proposal is approved, half of the requested funds will be disbursed on the designated FwB payment day, which usually falls on either the 15th or the last day of the month, thus the next payment date being February 28th. The remaining 50% will be allocated upon the successful completion and delivery of the content or specified deliverables.\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/tTZNSTZtAFY0P4b2neaiUfVw9_NnoCz1u4TxRVHFSqiDXVTOU3I0HQwjEZxlGNmnR5iPQYFWnp2Uq2pv3LzJUJIORG5x1eECm6dlmyyYMJZFnkJknZoISYQGVBKbptns_hkzAXn9eg3LUybskLlbXS4)\n\n  Funds to cover this proposal's budget will be transferred from the DAO wallet to the C-Corp tax wallet for liability and compliance purposes.\n\n  \n  **Value to DAO**\n\n- Creation of content from ETHDenver spotlighting Black Builders for Black History Month\n\n- Content highlighting community members on the ground at ETHDenver, promoting fest\n\n- FWB reaffirms its commitment to diversity by amplifying We Them Media's platforming of Black Builders at ETHDenver 2024\n\n- Publication of an article documenting insights and reflections for editorial purposes\n\n- Discord Presentation or otherwise of the Final product for FWB community \n\n- Distribution of POAPs to interviewees, generating wallet addresses for content airdrops\n\n  \n\n**Additional Note:**\n\nThis proposal serves as a trial for our expanded involvement in media for FWB at FEST, conducting interviews with thinkers and performing artists.",

      "title": "FWB Event Keys v4",
      "content": "## Event Keys v4 (February - December 2024)\n\n## Overview\nThroughout the Event Keys program, FWB members have hosted 70+ events in 29 cities across 4 continents, making this a very successful way to get involved and build community amongst members and non-members alike. The program also expands the reach of FWB across a vast, diverse array of places and spaces.\n\nAs a vehicle for online and offline decentralization, we hope to continue offering Event Keys in partnership with our member hosts and partner communities.\n\nIn the spirit of continuing this success, we are proposing Events Keys v4 for the year 2024, resulting in a sample framework below and a budget of 45,500 USD this season:\n\n1.  Up to 11 Event Keys: medium-large scale events like parties, art shows, partnerships with other organizations, etc.\n    \n2.  Up to 6 Digital Keys: URL-based events like Discord radio shows, broadcasts, etc.\n    \n3.  Up to 16 Lite Keys: small-medium scale events like dinners, happy hours, etc.\n    \n\n### Lessons Learned\n\n-   Event Keys have had 3 versions already, each one with different iterations and learnings. A compilation of events and their results can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z37SnFUOBPDioMmsEnjdY7nBGmc7HPsj/view?usp=sharing).\n    \n-   V3 OnBoarding [SOP here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HjYRJqa38JZr7IPPrRrnwqsU5cjYaPwk_4Xpj_eIarU). Will be updated to reflect any v4 approved changes.\n    \n\n  \n\n### Revisions to the Program\n\n-   Geographic diversity matters. In contrast to the v3 proposal, we’ve found that events haven’t been concentrated in major cities like NY, LA, SF, and London as expected. Most Event Keys and Lite Keys have been held outside of these cities, and we want to continue to encourage geographic diversity in this new round of Event Keys.\n    \n\n-   We will encourage more events to be held in Europe, which is the least active region with only 10% of the total Event Keys.\n    \n-   We will also encourage members to keep hosting events in cities with a good track record like Tokyo, Mexico City, Berlin, and Singapore.\n    \n\n  \n\n-   Digital Events: only 3 Digital Keys were held in the last round of Event Keys, although it was budgeted to have 2 Digital Keys per month.\n    \n\nWe believe that FWB's digital presence is and has been core to the DAO experience, so we aim to have 6 Digital Keys in 2024. The execution of Digital Keys will be encouraged as they can reach wider and more diverse audiences without geographical constraints.\n\n  \n\n-   Keep the things that we are good at: SOPs, quick response, templates, brand awareness guidelines, reports, Lite Key first, documentation, etc.\n    \n\n  \n\n-   Regarding Event Keys operations, the review of applications, communications with hosts, reception of event reports, and overall maintenance of documentation and processes will be executed by two council members. The production of payables reports and reimbursements will be executed by FWB’s Core Team.  \n    In the case of a stalemate in review by the two council members, the other three council members will be asked to weigh in which will result in a passing or not-passing vote as there are five members.\n    \n\n  \n\n-   Improve using the data from the in-depth review of the feedback provided by Event Key hosts:\n    \n\n-   Hosts have consistently considered that FWB should offer stronger marketing support. Because of this, we will work with internal marketing to amplify Event Keys v4 through social media, newsletters, and other channels to expand the reach of the events to the FWB following depending on the type of event and at FWB marketing discretion.\n    \n\n-   Hosts should not rely on FWB to ensure their event is successful; marketing can amplify & drive awareness but the Host needs to ensure they can bring their own audience\n    \n\n-   Member engagement: we expect hosts to be active members of the wider web3 community, with the ability to draw in current members or recruit new members. We may ask that new members apply and join leading up to attending an event.\n    \n-   RSVP/Attendance conversion: Review of applications will consider the applying member’s networks. While attrition is to be expected to be from 45%-55%, members awarded keys are expected to utilize their own networks and common event attendance tools to ensure attendance.\n    \n\n-   FWB's home-grown events platform, Gatekeeper, is expected to be used for all events. In the event that Gatekeeper is not a viable option for whatever reason, please confirm that any third-party platform used allows the collection and export of attendee email addresses in order to facilitate post-event outreach from FWB.\n    \n\n-   Expenditure: in line with the budget reductions for the year 2024, we’ve considered a 75% reduction in the cost of the program. This includes offering fewer Keys and having two council members in charge of reviewing and approving applications as well as reviewing Key reports. This results in largely reduced expenditure on Event Keys personnel and attempts to ensure quality of event productions over quantity.\n    \n\n### Projected Schedule\n\n**Key Dates**\n| Date       | Action                                                  |\n| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1/25/2024  | Event Keys v4 proposal up for vote on Snapshot          |\n| 2/1/2024   | Open Event Keys v4 applications and start granting Keys |\n| 12/21/2024  | Event Keys v4 end                                       |\n| Jan 2025   | Event Keys v4 retrospect published                      |\n\n### Budget\nFunds to cover the the Event Key v4 proposal budget will be transferred from the DAO wallet to the C-Corp tax wallet for liability and compliance purposes. \n\n| Type             | Expense     | #  | Unit Cost | Total       |\n| ---------------- | ----------- | -- | --------- | ----------- |\n| Event production | Event Key   | 11 | $3,000    | $33,000     |\n| Event production | Lite Key    | 16 | $250      | $4,000      |\n| Event production | Digital Key | 6  | $500      | $3,000      |\n| Personnel        | Reviewer    | 2  | $250      | $5,500      |\n|                  |             |    | **Total** | **$45,500** |",

      "content": "FEST 2024 Proposal\n\n## Abstract\n\nCurated and produced by Friends With Benefits, FEST is a yearly convening of new-internet communities in the mountains of Idyllwild, CA. Conceived of as a temporary network city where all attendees can engage with culture while exploring groundbreaking new ideas, FEST has now successfully gathered proponents of the web3 space for two consecutive years. Now, we’re coming back to the FWB community with a plan to do it all again, with several key upgrades and a bit of strategic reenvisioning. Vote “yes” on this proposal and help make an even more pluralist and collaborative FEST happen from August 1-4, 2024.\n\n“FEST is a grand symphony of gatherings,\n\nwith each experience intricately woven into the collective tapestry—\n\nepitomizing the zenith of networked potential.”\n\n— Greg Bresnitz, FWB Head of Events and Partnerships\n\n## History of FWB FEST\n\n2022: Inaugural FWB FEST\n\nFor our first-ever FEST, our team sought to create an alternative, emergent kind of festival where FWB members could convene alongside artists and creatives, and everyone would feel at home. We wanted to merge our team’s talent for cultural event curation and production with our position at the cutting edge of technology and crypto to create a truly hybridized festival experience where we could collectively imagine, debate, and define the future of the new internet. What transpired was undeniably even better than we imagined, which led the FWB community to vote enthusiastically in favor of building on the promise of FEST by hosting another weekend-long gathering in 2023.\n\nFEST 2022 by the Numbers:\n\n-   17 speakers\n    \n-   12 discussion and workshop facilitators\n    \n-   30 musicians\n    \n-   3 Partners\n    \n-   Loss of $443,702\n    \n\n  \n\nAfter FEST 2022, we knew that we’d need to have open discussions with the DAO about what worked and what didn’t before making plans to do it again. Thanks to great feedback from the FWB community, the [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XQLwj9ngwfpuntjTePhlOasyQc8KSdXszGErgCU6m1k/edit) to bring back FEST in 2023 was passed with strong support, and we couldn’t wait to try again.\n\n**2023: FWB FEST as a Gathering of New-Internet Communities**\n\nThis past August, our DAO pushed FEST to new heights, selling out all tickets and reaching a break-even revenue point—something which is quite rare for a second-year festival. We believe the success of FEST can primarily be attributed to how we leaned into our mission of being “the social convening point for the individuals, squads, and institutions using decentralized technology to build a better internet.” By bringing in 36 aligned and strategic collaborating partners to help program and populate the event, we were able to push FEST beyond our core community into a pluralist gathering where “[almost the entire web3 space](https://www.fwb.help/editorial/fest-collaborators)” was present. In retrospect, bringing together the new-internet community as co-curators of FEST was a pivotal decision that produced groundbreaking outcomes, and we believe this approach represents the best way forward.\n\n  \n\nIn addition to this framing, we took a hard look at our missteps from the previous year from an operational & budget perspective and were continually iterating on best practices to ensure that our epic weekend in the woods was also a fiscally responsible one. By leaning into partner support, we realized that there is a larger vision for FEST in the future with multiple companies invested in its success.\n\n  \n\nFEST 2023 by the Numbers:\n\n-   Sold Out\n-   36 Partners/Collaborators\n-   32 mainstage speakers\n    \n-   40 discussion and workshop facilitators\n    \n-   39 musicians\n    \n-   Estimated loss of $23,322 (94% reduction in our net loss on FEST Year over Year)\n    \n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/GpdES5VDe8VKlALQV5EGkvnSSbSSW3G7tBS41w_nDuR2V6gUy6XsVelbyOSlrpIhIgtocISlKd0wkEqrETfMWp8_FamtScNnhlK8hC0LZgfZohXgQOJRVoamQ9qcayOGC_NTkGPr6hSRmIr9EKRLllk)\n\nThis is a materially correct P&L, we still have a few minor open items that will require reconciliation in the coming months. These changes will not have more than a 5% effect on the P&L in either direction.\n\n  \n\nIn addition to the Base sponsorship dollars that went directly towards FEST, our conversation with the Base team led directly to our involvement with Onchain Summer, which resulted in 89 ETH (~$160,000) of revenue for the DAO.\n\n  \n\n2024: FWB FEST is Web3’s Major Cultural Moment—Powered by $FWB\n\n  \n\nIn 2024, we propose focusing on FEST’s propensity to be a truly foundational event in web3 by making the gathering even more pluralist—in other words, by expanding the stakeholdership and ownership to other value-aligned brands and organizations to take on more of the planning in a decentralized capacity. This should both enhance the event’s viability as a social convening point for the web3 community at large, while making FEST more financially sustainable and achievable for our lean operational team, without giving up our prominent role managing the event’s attendees, plan, budget, program, and overall vibe. Additionally, by pushing ticket sales in $FWB for the first time ever, and exploring other use cases, we aim to introduce new examples for our community token as a vital form of cultural currency within and around the event. (More on this below.)\n\n## Key Focuses for FEST ‘24\n\nAs we move FEST forward, we aim to retain much of the existing model, including:\n\n-   Engaging FWB members to collaboratively shape the event\n    \n-   Having the Idyllwild Arts Academy in Idyllwild, CA as our venue\n    \n-   Enlisting aligned partners and sponsors to help fund, curate, and populate FEST\n    \n-   Booking an eclectic mix of creative talent for unforgettable performances, workshops, and activations\n    \n-   Programming big-brain talks from experts across web3-adjacent cultures and industries\n    \n-   Ensuring attendees are empowered to meet each other and forge lasting friendships\n    \n\n  \n\nAdditionally, this year we aim to focus on the below key objectives to take FEST ‘24 to the next level:\n\n  \n\n**Double Down on FEST as a Pluralist Festival**\n\n  \n\nIt’s time to signal that FEST goes far and beyond the FWB community. We propose to position FEST as an inclusive cultural platform for all web3-aligned individuals, squads, brands, and organizations—not just for those who already orbit the FWB community.\n\n  \n\nIn 2024, FEST will serve as a testament to the collective cultural ambition of the web3 space and decentralized technology at large. By converging values-driven organizations and communities, FEST aims to paint a vivid picture of our shared aspirations for the digital future—all without compromising our vision or the intimate, DIY nature of the event.\n\n  \n\nIn order to ensure FWB remains at the heart of FEST, and for SEO purposes, we will keep the name “FWB FEST.” However, we will colloquially refer to our event as just “FEST” moving forward, in order to signal the weekend’s broader relevance and importance in the space.\n\n  \n\n**Continue Pursuing Meaningful Partner Activations**\n\n  \n\nOver 80% of the revenue for FEST ‘23 was generated via strategic partnerships, and we anticipate a 50% renewal rate of last year’s partnerships. Moving forward, we plan to offer values-aligned brands an unparalleled avenue to unveil important projects, orchestrate immersive retreats, engage in meaningful dialogues with their core audiences, and interact with a diverse spectrum of influential figures.\n\n  \n\nRecognizing the importance of meticulous planning, we will work to initiate sponsor engagements well in advance, providing ample time to craft and refine all partner collaborations so that they feel perfectly attuned to the FEST experience, while simultaneously accomplishing our sponsors' strategic goals.\n\n  \n\n**Integrating FWB’s New Community Council**\n\n  \n\nFWB’s new 5-seat Community Council will play an important role in listening to and advocating for our community’s FEST-related wants and needs. They will be involved in monthly FEST check-ins with the FWB Mayor and Core Team to stay fully aligned on FEST-related project plans, milestones, blockers, tactics, partners, etc. They will support communication with the FWB community to ensure that members and $FWB holders can weigh in on important FEST decisions, and be a collaborative force in the programming and curating of next year’s event.\n\n  \n\n**Using $FWB as FEST’s Cultural Currency**\n\n  \n\nIn order to draw more connectivity to $FWB and increase use cases for our community token, FEST passes will be available for purchase in $FWB for the first time ever—at a 15% discount for anyone who purchases in $FWB vs. fiat.\n\n  \n\nAdditionally, from now until the moment the FEST ‘24 proposal goes up for vote, anyone can purchase the [FEST 2024 Winamp Pass](https://mint.fwbfest.xyz/) for the steeply discounted price of 55 $FWB. This pass will give all holders boosted voting power on the FEST ‘24 vote (or, if they’re not already an $FWB holder, it will bestow voting privileges upon them), as well as voting privileges on future FEST-related governance votes open only to pass holders. We see this as a way for our most avid FEST enthusiasts to secure their pass early, while signaling their desire for FEST to come back in 2024. So far, more than 85 Winamp passes have already been minted.\n\n  \n\n**Core Team, Core Commitments**\n\n  \n\nIn 2024, reflecting on the DAO's evolution, it's undeniable that FEST is central to FWB’s core mission. This event has set in stone our commitment to the web3 community, and has functioned as a beacon that illuminates our core values and objectives. As FEST grows in stature, becoming \"the social convening point of web3,\" we are adding its production, curation, and marketing as an official part of the FWB core team's annual suite of responsibilities.\n\n## FEST ‘24 Areas for Improvement\n\n  \n\nAfter FEST ‘23, we surveyed attendees to capture valuable insights on their experiences. While the resounding feedback was positive, we did identify several key areas of improvement that we will focus on for FEST 2024:\n\n  \n\n**Increasing On-Site $FWB Holder + Member Benefits**\n\n  \n\nIn line with our commitment to the FWB community, we plan to introduce token-enabled member benefits at next year’s FEST. Recognizing the invaluable contributions of our members, we believe in offering them thoughtfully curated perks throughout the weekend to add an extra layer of exclusivity and appreciation. From daily complimentary coffee to special members-only hangs, we aim to sprinkle in moments of delight for our squad so that all FWB members feel the extra touch of recognition and gratitude they deserve during their festival experience. This objective will be achieved through collaboration with the Community Council, to ensure that our members have the ability to weigh in on what kinds of benefits and special programming they’d like to see at FEST. Additionally, we will once again host Member’s Day on the Thursday preceding FEST weekend, and hope to plan the day’s proceedings alongside our Community Council.\n\n  \n\n**Upgrading our Food & Beverage Program**\n\n  \n\nAs one of our key areas of improvement from FEST ‘23, we will be changing our food and beverage offerings to cater to the diverse palates of the FWB community. For 2024, we’ll prioritize offering a wider and healthier variety of foods on-site, and we’ll work hand-in-hand with our beverage partners to review all pricing and options in order to keep costs as low as possible. Recognizing the community’s feedback, we’ll also work to increase the availability of snacks and water stations throughout campus.\n\n  \n\n**Making FEST More Accessible**\n\n  \n\nWe are committed to improving physical accessibility on our festival grounds, and are working through methods to help facilitate movement up and down the hill to ensure ease of access for all attendees. We also propose to offer a more central source of accessibility-related communication during the festival, so that all attendees have a dedicated way to request information and/or accessibility-related transportation.\n\n  \n\n**Improving On-Site Communication and Wayfinding**\n\n  \n\nWe are committed to enhancing the digital connectivity at FEST. Next year, a dedicated and secure Wi-Fi will ensure uninterrupted internet access for all attendees. To facilitate seamless navigation, strategically placed printed signs will help with wayfinding around campus, and will include a detailed event schedule so that attendees can easily reference what’s going on, and where. We'll also refine our approach to a dedicated communications channel that features more real-time updates and allows for community interaction. Attendees can anticipate timely announcements, ensuring they remain informed and engaged throughout the FEST experience.\n\n  \n\n**Emphasis on a Multifaceted Cultural Lineup**\n\n  \n\nFor FEST ‘24, we want to double down on our community’s multifaceted cultural interests by balancing our incredible musical lineup with more heavy-hitting visual art activations. For the FEST ‘24 soundscape, we propose to curate a lineup that leans into experimental producers. We've also heard the call for more art representation, and plan to expand our visual art program by including interactive installations and captivating dance performances peppered throughout FEST.\n\n  \n\n**Focusing on 1:1 Connections**\n\n  \n\nMany FEST ‘23 attendees noted that they truly enjoyed the more hands-on, collaborative workshop offerings this past year. Whether making pasta as a group, collaborating on a digital artwork, co-editing a zine, or playing music together, the programs that enabled FEST attendees to get to know each other in a more intimate and creative setting forged lasting bonds and enabled a deeper sense of connection. For next year’s FEST, we will help our community get to know each other better by programming more experiences that promote interest-aligned networking, 1:1 creative collaboration, and an overall sense of shared camaraderie.\n\n## Proposed FEST ‘24 Budget\n\nProjected 2024 FWB Fest P&L\n \n![Screenshot 2024-01-08 at 12.45.08.png](ipfs://bafkreie6nmomxsblxyutkftdvaak7jkvpddh4fgoyftyx6omtbu5lypk6a)\n    \n\n## Proposed FEST ‘24 Timeline\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/TMeIaPG0EozoHaJlSzqwEfYgqdiTlyOfop3pjHnIpluufY1-iGRBqmvULXAh42e6BHJbPcX2CEGKP_E9Apa6GKObaoQLziusEciH0N_OuE9oLihO16bL5i_dkEAJWwecyCEwQCiAsYp1f3NW7gEpD8w)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs everyone who’s attended knows, FEST is a truly special event. There’s really nothing else like it, and we are excited to keep building on the model with the FWB community—and with the web3 community at large. To keep pushing the new internet forward, we need more spaces and dedicated moments where we can convene, share insights, forge lasting friendships, and bask in the warm, innovative culture we’re all working so hard to build. We hope that FEST ‘24, and all the connections we make leading up to it, will help uplift our decentralized corner of the internet to ever-higher heights. So, in conclusion: Vote Yes and LFG!!!!!!!!",

      "title": "FWB at Mexico City Art Week",
      "content": "Authors: Joshua Phelps, Lia Godoy, Alex Zhang, Greg Bresnitz, Paul Tao\n\n### Abstract\n\nFriends With Benefits aims to pioneer a new event series at the renowned Mexico City Art Week, encompassing Zona Maco, Feria Material, and Salón Acme art fairs and much more from nearly every gallery in the city. The Casa FWB initiative will introduce a 1-2 day conference experience focused on the convergence of art, digital culture, and web3. Our vision is to bridge the traditional art world with emerging crypto-native creators and communities through activations like site-specific art installations, digital displays, artist talks, and more.\n\n### Motivation\n\nMexico City Art Week, often referred to as Mexico City’s Art Basel, attracts over 80,000 attendees globally. There's a growing appetite for understanding how art and digital culture can co-exist and thrive in crypto. With FWB's track record of curating influential conversations, this event will serve as a platform to redefine digital art beyond digital displays and PFPs and also allow FWB to plant its flag at a relevant moment that is less crowded with competing web3 culture organizations.\n\n  \n\nAdditionally, by creating another flagship event for FWB besides FWB Fest, we introduce an opportunity to create a more well rounded and holistic offering to our global partners.\n\n### Impact on Community\n\n1.  Offer established LATAM artists, members and adjacent communities a curated space to showcase their art and connect.\n    \n2.  Establish a new in-person convening point for FWB members in a more geographically diverse region.\n    \n3.  Create another revenue driving opportunity and brand activation in addition to FWB Fest.\n    \n4.  Increase FWB’s visibility in traditional art spaces.\n    \n\n### Ways to be Involved\n\n1.  Exhibition Sponsorship: Partners can co-present and become title sponsors for the digital and physical sculpture exhibition. This includes branding on all digital platforms, signage, and the main entrance.\n    \n2.  Event Hosting: Organizations can co-host branded cafe and happy hours, expanding their invitation list to engage stakeholders and community members.\n    \n3.  Co-curating Programs: Engage in co-curating programming inside the venue to exhibit expertise and position in front of a creatively and technologically advanced audience.\n    \n\n### Description\n\nVenues are still in early exploration mode, but we have identified a few options in the heart of Mexico City and will be working with local production teams to ensure high production value. FWB members would have a private area only available to members and contributing partners.\n\n  \n\nSample Schedule:\n\nAll day - coffee and snacks\n\n12:00 – Venue & Exhibition Opens\n\n14:00 – Programming, Talks, Music\n\n17:00 – Cocktail Hour\n\n22:00 – Ticketed Party\n\n  \n\n-   Gallery & Exhibition Potential\n    \n\n-   FWB to transform an old-world venue into a new world experience – featuring best in class digital art alongside physical sculpture.\n    \n-   Our aim is to contextualize digital art in a new capacity, demonstrating that it has more to offer than PFPs on Samsung screens.\n    \n\n-   Programming\n    \n\n-   Robust programming on where art and technology intersect, and its purported future, will anchor the multi day experience.\n    \n-   FWB has a history of curating and producing seminal conversations at its annual FWB FEST, and bringing this into a more global context is incredibly exciting.\n    \n\n-   Cocktail and Cafe Hours\n    \n\n-   Key community moments like cocktail hours and will converge bright minds and creative artists for focused conversation and moments of connection.\n    \n\n-   Ticketed Parties\n    \n\n-   FWB will partner with established fairs and galleries to include access to the best nightlife during the week.\n    \n-   We are well positioned to partner their signature, nighttime events and anniversaries as an added benefit to FWB members, contributing artists and attendees of FWB programming/Casa FWB,.\n    \n\nWe are also well positioned to partner with established fairs on their signature, nighttime events as an added benefit to FWB members, contributing artists and attendees of FWB programming/Casa FWB\n\n### Success Metrics & KPIs\n\n1.  Secure at least $30,000 in sponsorship revenue to produce.\n    \n2.  Collaborate with Mexican and other LATAM artists, partners, and vendors or local communities in programming.\n    \n3.  Secure a minimum of 500 RSVPs to FWB’s programming at Mexico City Art Week that will run through Gatekeeper\n    \n4.  Generate new opportunities for contributing artists to expand their network and generate commissioned artworks.\n    \n5.  Achieve a 25% increase in awareness and engagement on FWB's digital platforms during and post-event.\n    \n\n### Key Considerations\n\n1.  Strategic Partnerships: Lock in relevant partnerships before moving forward with any production.\n    \n2.  Cultural Sensitivity: Ensure the event respects and celebrates Mexico's rich cultural heritage and legacy.\n    \n3.  Logistics and Infrastructure: Collaborate closely with local entities to ensure smooth logistics, especially with the transformation of traditional venues into digital realms.\n    \n\n### Budget\nRevenue (no funds from FWB Treasury) \n \n![Screenshot 2023-12-05 at 11.21.19.png](ipfs://bafkreicquke7jv26b6lgtrrtw2722ivwspjuozwbgf5xu4gzs2h3l6qboa)\n    ",

      "title": "FWB Q4 '23 Budget + Q3 '23 Report Back",
      "content": "FWB experienced one of its strongest financial periods in Q3, 2023. The success was primarily driven by strategic, community driven partnerships through FWB Fest. In addition to creating a unique and exceptional experience for our community, as covered by [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/08/10/crypto-clubs-throwing-summer-parties-inside-the-friends-with-benefits-dao-festival/?sh=2b3ca9c635f4) and [Document Journal](https://www.documentjournal.com/2023/08/friends-with-benefits-fest-idyllwild/), the team executed 20 partnerships with major leading brands and protocols, as well as a highly integrated NFT drop to kick off Coinbase’s new L2 Base, with Cozimo de Medici and Deekay.\n\n![Screenshot 2023-10-24 at 14.43.35.png](ipfs://bafkreic5z4zr3c6gaalozetpkrrxlp5h6rsw56lzcp7sjksoclw5ngxbdu)\n    \n**Key Takeaways from Q3**\n\n-   Q3 marks the first positive cash flow quarter in FWB’s history.\n    \n-   FWB has generated $849,000 in partnership revenue to-date and anticipates an additional $300K by year-end. \n    \n-   FWB collaborated with Coinbase to launch Base with an inaugural NFT drop, curated by FWB, with Cozimo de Medici and Deekay, generating ~75,000 mints.\n- Recurring compensation and expenses have been cut from $167,000 in April to an estimated $70,000 in July, reflecting approximately a 58% reduction in expenses. This is primarily driven by further decentralization of the team and the recent proposal to launch a separate entity in FWB Labs.\n\n![567d7851-ea2b-4272-a28a-fbb98562b1ec_1592x1158.jpg](ipfs://bafybeie7asn2s4vepaxvilvduz4vapz4i4g6sxmzes6w553iy46zj77wpa)\n    \n-   Operational overhead expenses have been minimized to essential necessities, including external legal and accounting services.\n- **Here’s a [report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ucBN3s30riS4E_peCvonKjDjppq7bRbno-MMB0upXsE/edit#gid=411914816) back on our Q3 actuals.**\n\n**Q4 Proposed Budget**\n\nConsidering the above and incorporating community feedback we have received, below is an overview of the resources we’ll need from the FWB treasury to continue progressing in Q4:\n  \n![Screenshot 2023-10-24 at 14.56.49.png](ipfs://bafkreib2m52pgqy5hpgduwlstxhmdktkhki6tr6rn6nd36l66n5lvralcq)\n    \n\n[Here’s](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZvQ4Mtg3oqlI6uFdV8hTg5RVvtN3T4F7pb4pfl1QC1k/edit#gid=2085060237) the Q4 budget with additional details, key takeaways, a revenue summary, compensation by team, the partnerships commission model, and Q4 KPIs. \n    \n**Key Takeaways from Q4**\n\n1.  20% budget reduction in November and December after community feedback to v1 of the Q4 '23 budget proposal shared in early October, \n\n2. Expected runway of 21 months beginning Q4, 2023.\n    \n3.  Partnerships on track to meet annual revenue goal of $1.2M. Total partnerships revenue to date is $849K with a $340K Q4 projection. On average, FWB executes roughly 2x partnerships/month.\n    \n4.  New Mayor and council to reset and re-establish KPIs across the entire core team in mid-November.\n    \n5.  Introduction of a Partnerships Commission model using margin-based incentives to tie commission to profitability of a deal, rather than its gross value. (Existing partnership contributors have not received any commissions this year-to-date.)\n    \n6.  Several contributor roles consolidated or reduced in scope due to future anticipated needs and resourcing.\n    \n7.  Product rolling off to Labs in successful fundraise scenario (target date: 11/1/23).\n\n8. Introduced a proposal to allocate a percentage of projected revenue generated by FWB to routinely buy $FWB tokens off the open market in order to replenish the treasury with our native token.\n \n\n**KPIs**\n\nThe evolution of FWB is paramount to its success, and with the imminent inauguration of our new mayor and newly elected community council, we recognize the need for adaptive leadership. To align with this new chapter and ensure efficiency, transparency, and responsiveness to our community's needs, the core team's KPIs will undergo a thorough re-evaluation with the new Mayor and council. This will not only optimize our operational effectiveness but also reaffirm our commitment to a dynamic and community-centric DAO.\n\n**Partnerships & Events**\n\n1.  Revenue Generation: $1.2M in partnerships revenue in 2023.\n    \n2.  Lead Generation: Generate 10 new qualified leads per month.\n    \n3.  Brand Awareness and Exposure: Increase in brand visibility and recognition through partnership and joint marketing efforts.\n    \n4.  Events Engagement: See [Event Keys v3](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/0xe56d7611bce263812eb9bbc3561e16f0788b44217a94bf79eb61b99f9a689a2a) and [FEST23](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/0x263facf9dc0019d86e182e0573c1239ed7fd1ecb0060abab4835c0ac1a26d1e9) proposals.\n    \n**Operations & Treasury**\n\n1.  Forecast Accuracy: Minimize variation between forecasted and actual cash balances and budget.\n    \n2.  Comprehensive Due Diligence: Appropriately source smart contract review, liability or legal assessments, and competitive analysis beneficial to DAO.\n    \n3.  Optimize Systems Efficiency: Minimize manual labor and overhead expenses associated with operational and treasury management by implementing best practices and tooling (i.e. implement new payroll and accounting systems, automate compliance filings.)\n    \n4.  Regulatory Compliance: Ensure compliance fillings, taxes, and accounting procedures are completed on time with full adherence to applicable requirements.\n    \n\n**Marketing**\n - From a holistic perspective, marketing KPIs are to be reset with the new mayor and council in mid-November.\n\n**Summary**\n\nAs close out the year and look towards 2024, the team is closely focused on the following activities from a revenue-generating perspective:\n\n1.  Continue to develop engaging partnerships with start-ups, institutions, and projects within and outside of the crypto ecosystem.\n    \n2.  Collaborate with emerging artists on open edition NFT mints and other creative project that drive revenue and more opportunities to the DAO.\n    \n3.  Successfully launch and capitalize FWB Labs software arm to create more software enabled $FWB use cases.\n    \n4.  Work closely with the new Mayor and elected community council to strengthen member relations and improve new member leads.",

      "title": "$FWB Restock Protocol Proposal",
      "content": "Authors: Treasury Team\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal outlines a process for FWB Protocol (“FWB”) to allocate a percentage of projected revenue generated by FWB DAO to routinely buy $FWB tokens off the open market in order to replenish the treasury with our native token. This has been reviewed by our legal counsel and approved as a compliant approach to restocking the treasury.\n\n  \n## Why\n\nIt’s important for us to buy $FWB tokens for a few reasons:\n\n  \n-   The DAO/UNA has been restricted in its activities due to a low amount of $FWB tokens in the treasury\n    \n-   Buying $FWB tokens will facilitate the initiation of new experiments by the Council and community members to develop new use cases\n    \n\n\n## How\n\nFWB DAO is proposing to allocate an initial 2.5% of all revenue generated by FWB DAO, on a quarterly basis, to this restock protocol. Revenue from FWB has historically been generated from partnerships, events, and NFT drops.\n\n  \n\nIn 2023, FWB is projected to generate $800k from partnership revenue. Had this proposal been implemented at the start of the year with 2.5% committed to restocking the treasury, it would have resulted in a $20k $FWB token purchase over the year sufficient to explore a few different experiments.\n\n  \n\n## Timeline & Details\n\n  \nUpon this proposal passing, a smart contract will be developed which will be responsible for purchasing $FWB tokens on a regular basis, depending on the volume of $ETH supplied to the contract. This smart contract will leverage an off chain randomness generator to purchase $FWB tokens from the open market using a portion of the $ETH available in the smart contract.\n\n  \n\nUpon execution, invoicing, and receipt of proceeds from future partnerships, a percentage of the proceeds will be transferred to the smart contract in the form of $ETH. The exact percentage will be determined by the Treasury Lead at that time.\n\n  \n\nThe percentage of contribution is up to the discretion of the Treasury Lead to decide based on operational needs and priorities. Treasury Lead has the ability to change this percentage on a maximum of once per quarter.\n\n  \n\n## Looking Forward\n\n  \n\nThe goal of the program is to operate indefinitely, with a corresponding outflow of $FWB tokens for the implementation of new use cases and programs devised by the Council and community members.\n\n \n\nThe program can be suspended or terminated through the approval of a new proposal.",

      "content": "FWB had one of its most successful financial periods in Q3 of 2023. Our success can be primarily attributed to the strategic, community-driven partnerships we generated through FWB FEST. In addition to creating a unique and exceptional experience for our community, as covered by [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/08/10/crypto-clubs-throwing-summer-parties-inside-the-friends-with-benefits-dao-festival/?sh=2b3ca9c635f4) and [Document Journal](https://www.documentjournal.com/2023/08/friends-with-benefits-fest-idyllwild/), the team executed **20 partnerships** with major leading brands and protocols, as well as a highly integrated NFT drop to kick off Coinbase’s new L2 Base, with Cozimo de Medici and Deekay.\n\n**Total partnership revenue generated by FWB in 2023 to-date is $849,000.**\n\n## Q3 Summary \n_Key Takeaways from Q3 Actuals_\n-   **Q3 '23 marks FWB's first positive cash flow quarter. .**\n-   FWB has generated  **$849,000 in partnerships revenue to date** and anticipates an additional  **$350,000 by year end**. This significantly surpasses our initial goal of $850,000 in partnership revenue for 2023.\n- Recurring compensation and expenses have been cut from $167,000 in April to an estimated $70,000 in July,  **reflecting a roughly 58% reduction in operating expenses.** This is primarily driven by further decentralization of the team and the recent proposal to launch a separate entity in FWB Labs.\n-   Operational overhead expenses have been minimized to essential necessities, including external legal and accounting services.\n-   FWB collaborated with Coinbase to launch Base with an inaugural NFT drop, curated by FWB, with Cozimo de Medici and Deekay, generating ~75,000 mints.\n\t- _Spindl data shows that anotherblock and FWB were the biggest drivers of Base adoption. The Friends With Benefits (FWB) mint on On Chain Summer was particularly good at driving Base users to other dapps, with a Base retention rate of 38%._\n\n \n![Screenshot 2023-09-27 at 10.40.01.png](ipfs://bafkreig3o46zx2hatxccmtlyxvofpjlo6kfrnkkjmnmg4b6x72nkfhehlu)\n    \n\n**Here’s the  [report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ucBN3s30riS4E_peCvonKjDjppq7bRbno-MMB0upXsE/edit#gid=411914816)  back on our Q3 actuals.**\n\n## Q4 Proposed Budget\n\nConsidering the above, below is an overview of the resources we’ll need from the FWB treasury to continue progressing in Q4:\n\n_Key Takeaways for Q4 Proposed Budget_\n\n-   **Expected runway of 18 months beginning Q4 '23.**\n-   Heading into Q4, we are operating even leaner as a core team. We expect to have 3 full-time contributors, 6 part-time contributors, and 5 Community Council members by the end of Q4.\n-   While we remain conservative about announcing future partnerships that are yet to be executed, we have high confidence that we will generate an additional $350,000 in revenue across sponsorships and future NFT mints.\n-   Operational overhead costs are now mostly limited to professional services and servicing.\n-   Sharing a proposal to allocate a percentage of projected revenue generated by FWB to routinely buy $FWB tokens off the open market in order to replenish the treasury with our native token.\n-   Our long-term goal is to be generating enough monthly revenue such that it meets our current monthly cash burn of approximately $82,250.\n \n![Screenshot 2023-09-27 at 10.40.14.png](ipfs://bafkreibn6byu4ndofkg5pbgh23ifomf5iak2xxi5vjnjx3uojo2cq4abae)\n    \nHere’s a report of our  [Q4 budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11KvrIaJhZr2DEGduDoZS89BYlnWsAthSPpMw43WYliE/edit#gid=2085060237)  with additional details.\n\n## Summary\n\nAs we close out the year and look towards 2024, the team is primarily focused on the following activities from a revenue-generating perspective:\n\n1.  Continue to develop engaging partnerships with start-ups, institutions, and projects within and outside of the crypto ecosystem.\n2.  Collaborate with emerging artists on open edition NFT mints and other creative projects that drive revenue and more opportunities to the DAO.\n3.  Successfully launch and capitalize the FWB Labs software arm to create more software-enabled $FWB use cases.\n4.

      "title": "Leadership Transition: Mayor & Council",
      "content": "**Abstract**\nThis proposal outlines a process and framework for upgrading FWB DAO’s leadership structure under the new [FWB UNA](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/0xafa547561557544ad47627bce76c4fe0454f2b3d064488954a25c230c72fcdac) by introducing a Community Council made up of qualified FWB members to collaborate with and provide guidance to FWB’s Mayor and Core Team.\n\n**Background**\nAs the first full-time contributor role at FWB, the Mayor has been responsible for developing FWB into a cohesive community-led organization. Prior to any legal formation or capitalization, the Mayor’s directive was to lead the Founding Team in establishing a vision for FWB, and to hire, organize, and inspire talent from within the DAO to execute that vision.\n\nIn order to further decentralize the organization as an UNA, the time has come to establish a new, flatter leadership structure with a council of community members elected by other constituent members. This council will provide guidance, input, and accountability to FWB’s operating Mayor and Core Team.\n\nAfter thoughtful discussion with the community and Core Team, the first Leadership Transition proposal—which recommended a three-seat Council instead of a Mayor—failed to pass. Nearly 59% of community members who voted felt that the proposed iteration of a three-seat leadership council was not an adequate way to structure the DAO’s leadership.\n\nThis proposal puts forward a promising new option that emerged during governance discussions. It merges the pros of a single Mayor (one highly qualified, full-time leader dedicating 100% of their energy to furthering the DAO’s mission and sustainability) with the benefits of a more decentralized leadership council (a guiding body of 5 diverse community members who are compensated for their time working to shape and oversee FWB’s future).\n\n**Overview**\nThis proposal establishes a Community Council that collaborates with a singular Mayor. The domain and responsibility of the Community Council would be (1) to represent the diversity of the DAO’s interests and (2) to collaborate with the Mayor on establishing a unified vision and strategy for the future of FWB DAO. This leadership structure is designed to drive community alignment with the Mayor and Core Team’s future goals, such as increasing developer and creator activity within the FWB ecosystem. The Community Council would also be responsible for reviewing, refining, and stewarding proposals within the DAO and shaping how proposals from the Core Team are co-created and shared with the community.\n\nGiven that the Community Council would exist within the context of FWB as an Unincorporated Nonprofit Association, it is essential that the roles evolve within the context of the association agreement where decision-making authority for the organization lies with the members through validly enacted governance proposals (which are essential to maintaining decentralized governance), and not through wide grants of authority to individual members (as found in typically centralized operations).\n\n  \n**Overview of DAO Functions** \n \n![Screenshot 2023-09-20 at 12.52.58.png](ipfs://bafkreieo4mayg7rbidyke45ebrkwlxavhgxdwr7cv3j7p2wbhnko2u6gpm)\n\n**Community Council Role Description**\n-   Operate as a community board of advisors that helps steward long term FWB direction.\n    \n-   Define FWB DAO’s community initiatives through listening and understanding in order to stimulate strong community participation, high morale, and strategic projects with successful outcomes.\n    \n-   Engage the FWB community in ways that surface the DAO’s collective vision and desires; collaborate with the Mayor and Core Team to design strategies and programs that bring the DAO’s collective vision to life.\n    \n-   Vote to approve or reject a Mayoral candidate nominated by the Core Team. Note that Core Team will conduct a rigorous interview process (on par with CEO-level candidate screenings) before bringing them to the Community Council to vote. Community Council will also be provided the opportunity to interface with the Mayoral candidate prior to voting.\n    \n-   Maintain, improve, and evolve FWB governance to encourage more community proposals and voter engagement.\n    \n-   Steward Code of Conduct committee and process. \n    \n**Community Council Responsibilities**\n-   Participate in all governance discussions and votes. (Pending extenuating circumstances.)\n    \n-   Actively engage with the community by organizing and hosting a minimum of 1 community call per month to discuss proposals, projects, and new initiatives.\n    \n-   Collaborate with Core Team to communicate about and promote community initiatives.\n    \n-   Report back to the Core Team on a bi-weekly cadence on community issues, feedback, and discussions.\n    \n*Failure to participate in responsibilities without adequate messaging will result in a warning issued by the Mayor and/or Core Team.*\n\n If council members collect three warnings through CoC submissions, they may be removed at the discretion of the Core Team, who will nominate a replacement within one month. Replacement candidates will then need to be approved by the remaining Community Council members with a majority vote.\n\n  \n\n**Community Council Compensation**\n\n-   5 members paid 500 $USDC monthly\n-   Minimum time commitment of 2-3 hrs/week\n    \n**Community Council Election Process**\nThe 5 seat FWB Community Council election process will involve the following:\n\n1.  Candidate submissions open to anyone who is an FWB member that submits an application\n    \n2.  Core Team will use a codified rubric to approve Community Council candidates (*See below section, “Community Council Member Qualifications”)*\n    \n3.  4 council members will be elected by the DAO community via a 1-wallet 1-vote ranked-choice Snapshot vote\n    \n4.  1 council member selected by Core Team based on an approved rubric \n    \n1.  Core Team will use a codified rubric to approve Community Council candidates *(See below section, “Community Council Member Qualifications”)*\n    \n6.  Once the Council is in place, the existing Core Team puts forth a mayoral candidate that the Community Council votes on. To be approved as Mayor, a majority of the Community Council must vote in the candidate’s favor (at least a 3-2 vote).\n    \n7.

      "title": "Leadership Transition",
      "content": "**Abstract**\nThis proposal outlines a process and framework for FWB DAO’s leadership process from a mayor and operating team into a new community-led model as we transition formally to an UNA. It includes a role overview, considerations (singular Mayor role vs. Leadership Council), target timeline, and process that should lay the foundation for future elections.\n\n**Background**\n\nAs the first full-time contributor role at FWB, the Mayor has been responsible for developing FWB into a cohesive community-run organization. Prior to any legal formation or capitalization, the Mayor’s directive was to lead the founding team in establishing a vision for FWB, and to hire, organize, and inspire talent from within the DAO to execute that vision.\n\nAfter the passing of the recent [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/0xafa547561557544ad47627bce76c4fe0454f2b3d064488954a25c230c72fcdac) that established FWB as an UNA, FWB is officially two symbiotic organizations: FWB DAO as an UNA (Unincorporated Nonprofit Association) and our newly formed software-focused C-corp (which is named “Scene Infrastructure Co.”).\n\n**Overview**\n\nFWB DAO, under its new mandate as an UNA, will operate in a more decentralized way with no explicit leader or unilateral decision maker.\n\nAs the future of the Mayor role has been discussed in our governance channels, a question has been raised as to whether a singular role is the best path forward, or if it should evolve into a Leadership Council which would allow for more voices around the table as well as more fluid leadership if someone deems the role no longer a fit.\n\nThis proposal establishes a three seat Leadership Council. The domain and responsibility of the Leadership Council would be focused on the FWB DAO and its community, increasing developer and creator activity, and use cases for FWB including events, content, software, and tools.\n\nThe Leadership Council would exist within the context of FWB as an Unincorporated Nonprofit Association. It is essential that the roles evolve within the context of the association agreement where decision-making authority for the organization lies with the members through validly enacted governance proposals (essential to maintaining decentralized governance) and not through wide grants of authority to individual members (as found in typically centralized operations).\n\n**FWB Council Role Description**\n\nThe FWB DAO’s Leadership Council would have the following responsibilities:\n\n-   Steward, refine, and execute FWB DAO’s vision of being the convening point for creatives, artists, and technologists in web3 who believe in the promise of a better internet.\n    \n-   Increase creator and developer activity being built for FWB\n    \n-   Maintain, improve, and evolve FWB governance to encourage more community proposals\n    \n-   Interface with FWB’s software entity SIC as an liaison and advocate for the DAO and community\n    \n-   Lead and define FWB DAO’s community initiatives through listening and understanding in order to stimulate strong community participation, high morale, and ambitious projects with successful outcomes\n    \n-   Identify new opportunities to help grow and expand the DAO’s influence and reach\n    \n**Role Target Qualifications**\n\n-   Member of the FWB community for 1+ year\n    \n-   Leadership of an small to medium size organization for at least 2+ years\n    \n-   Experience in crypto native ecosystem development\n    \n-   Strong independent, self-starting work ethic\n    \n-   Strong communication and collaboration skills\n    \n**Election Process**\n\nThe FWB Council election process will involve the following:\n\n1.  Candidate submissions will be open and anyone who is an FWB member can submit an application\n    \n2.  Existing core team to review submission under a community-approved rubric that is used to quantitatively and qualitatively assess applications and prepare most qualified 3-5 applicants.\n    \n3.  Candidates will be notified of their selection, and have 2 weeks to campaign\n\ta. Campaign Rules include\n\t\ti. No aggressive spamming\n\t\tii. No smear campaigns against other candidates\n\tb. Campaign moments include, but are not limited to:\n\t\ti. Town Hall\n\t\tii. Editorial Piece highlighting candidate’s backgrounds\n4.  Election to take place via Snapshot\n    \n**Additional Details**\n\n-   As a member of the FWB Treasury League, the Leadership Council will have access to external advisors to help navigate the complexities of being public facing thought leaders in a decentralized community.\n   \n-   Term limits will apply to all council members following an election. Additional amendments and suggestions are encouraged but will be ratified through a governance vote.\n    \n-   Compensation for the Leadership Council will be $40,000 USDC per Council seat annually with commensurate $FWB token vests.\n    \n-   We propose that 1 existing core team member transfers over to the Council to ensure seamless transition of existing processes and institutional knowledge. We propose IzzyB who is currently leading operations and has sat across treasury, compensation, marketing, governance, legal, FEST, and the Event Keys program. They worked under FWB’s previous Operations Lead and with existing advisors.\n    \n**Transition Timeline**\n\nTarget transition date will be the end of Q3/beginning of Q4.\n\n**[Proposed Application Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BfW9WgRBiz_vsZdif2Tt28g_LPfpW9d5U53I-vjTGTw/edit)**",

      "title": "FWB Summer 2023 Vision & Budget",
      "content": "In the first half of 2023, we successfully reconfigured FWB’s operational model. _Here’s where we’re going next, and how we’re getting there._\n\nFWB is making great strides toward creating a sustainable operational model while meaningfully decentralizing. Last quarter our contributing team worked alongside our community to vote on fundamental proposals that have already changed how FWB operates. By implementing a suite of “[System Upgrades](https://www.fwb.help/editorial/overview-fwb-system-upgrades)”—including updating FWB’s membership mechanics, forming a separate software c-corp, and creating a legal wrapper for the DAO in an UNA—we are in a prime position to further our work and grow our community, all while navigating the larger market.\n\nOver the past few months, we reduced the DAO’s average monthly burn by 77% and implemented a highly effective partnership strategy, putting us on pace to generate $980,000 in revenue this year. Together, these wins have given us a much more comfortable runway. With our second-ever  [FWB FEST](https://fest.fwb.help/)  right around the corner, we can’t wait to gather our community from all corners of the world and celebrate the next chapter of FWB.\n\n![enter image description here](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/muknps09/production/548a8aab48a4b361d40b4b9a1fdac45b4b9e5ea3-1928x1088.png)\n\nHeading into the summer of 2023, our contributing team’s focus will be on implementing all of the approved System Upgrade initiatives, producing and marketing FEST, and working with the community to introduce new proposals aimed at further decentralizing FWB. From opening up more partnership and revenue-generating opportunities to electing a new mayor, our work over the next three months should position FWB to move towards a fully community-driven model that enables emergent initiatives to drive the DAO forward in a sustainable, equitable way.\n\nRead on for a comprehensive overview of what we accomplished over the spring, and for a deep-dive into the DAO’s focus, strategy, and proposed budget for the summer of 2023.\n\n### **SYSTEM UPGRADE UPDATES**\n\nOver the past several months, we developed and voted on three major System Upgrade proposals, which you can find outlined in our  [Q2 Budget + Strategy](https://www.fwb.help/editorial/overview-fwb-system-upgrades). Below we’ve summarized how each initiative will be moving forward over the next three months.\n\n### **MEMBERSHIP MECHANICS**\n\nWith the passing of the updated  [Membership Mechanics proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/0x4421dddc830355b7e3f5290fb9583ded426e61450fe0bd2742722b3d87db288f)  in April, the Product and Membership teams have started to map out the plan for transitioning from token-based membership to NFT-based membership. The target timeline is to complete the transition process by the end of July, in anticipation of FWB FEST. Work on the smart contracts for the NFT-based membership has already kicked off, and we’ll be making announcements for how existing members can claim their Membership NFT in the coming weeks.\n\n### **ESTABLISHING A SOFTWARE C-CORP**\n\nSince the passing of the  [software C-Corp proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/0x814c9eb836a69ae5afe5396e1e719a3a242203e5464093bb710a4711bc054ea3), FWB’s Product team has been talking to existing, vision-aligned FWB investors about participating in the new company’s seed round, which is being led by a16z crypto. More updates about this will be released in the coming weeks.\n\n### **UNA FRAMEWORK**\n\nAs the last System Upgrade proposal to go to vote, the  [UNA proposal has officially been approved by the community](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/0xafa547561557544ad47627bce76c4fe0454f2b3d064488954a25c230c72fcdac)!\n\nBy forming an Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (“UNA”) around the FWB DAO, our organization will be formally and legally recognized. Becoming an UNA will also enable us to pay taxes in a more straightforward way, will limit the liability of DAO members, and will open up the door for our community to seek tax-exempt status. Forming an UNA is a necessary next step for FWB to become more decentralized, and aligns with our vision to operate as a community-owned network.\n\nThe UNA association agreement can be read in its entirety  [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nbaylJ6M1prgQS6pxI0qoj82HjOlYiIj/view).\n\n![enter image description here](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/muknps09/production/52ec297575bbd72296dd40f7f76fe4047c284504-9168x6133.jpg)\n\n### UPDATES AND NEXT STEPS FOR ONGOING INITIATIVES\n\nBeyond our work on the System Upgrade initiatives, we've been hard at work producing experiences, events, and partnerships to push our community forward. Here's what's next for a few of our largest ongoing initiatives: The FWB App, FWB FEST, Event Keys, and Partnerships.\n\n### **FWB APP**\n\nThe FWB app was released in February of this year as a new kind of members-only social software, built by and for our community. With around 50% of eligible FWB members now onboarded, the FWB App has maintained an impressive average monthly retention rate of ~60%. These promising figures demonstrate that the FWB App has the potential to become one of the primary ways (if not  _the_  primary way) that members connect with each other, keep up to date on all things FWB, and make their voices heard.\n\nAs our Product team continues to improve the app’s user experience, they are now focused on refining the social feed to encourage more meaningful conversations, introducing end-to-end encrypted DMs between individual users and groups, and integrating in-app governance.\n\nNot on the app yet? Members holding $75 FWB can get it  [here](https://app.fwb.help/).\n\n### **FWB FEST ‘23**\n\nAt the beginning of this year, our community voted (nearly unanimously!) to bring back FEST as FWB’s annual community pilgrimage to Idyllwild, CA. Over the past few months, we successfully launched this year’s festival and announced an unprecedented lineup of speakers, performers, collaborators, and partners. As we count down to August, we are laser focused on marketing and producing the festival.\n\nFEST is a destination gathering of new-internet communities and a temporary network city for creating culture and exploring new ideas. Conceived as equal parts Woodstock, Black Mountain College, and 1964 Hacker’s Conference, FEST is about bringing together 𝓪𝓵𝓵 𝓸𝓯 𝓽𝓱𝓮 𝓼𝓺𝓾𝓪𝓭𝓼 of the new internet to combine forces and come together as one community, in one place, for one weekend only. Read more about the thinking behind FEST in our  [MANI.FEST.O.](https://www.fwb.help/editorial/mani-fest-o)  \n\n**Key FEST23 highlights:**\n\n-   $735,000+ in expected partnership revenue from partners including Uniswap, OpenSea, Seed Club, Highlight, and more to be announced.\n-   10+ collaborator communities including Zora Zine, Refraction, Metalabel, and Rhizome.\n-   50+ confirmed speakers, performers, and community contributors.\n\n### **EVENT KEYS**\n\nIn December of 2022, the FWB community voted to fund  [V3 of our global decentralized events program](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/0xe56d7611bce263812eb9bbc3561e16f0788b44217a94bf79eb61b99f9a689a2a)  known as Event Keys. Since the beginning of 2023, FWB members have pushed this proposal forward by hosting 25+ events both online (shoutout Urbit) and in physical locations around the world (in some cities for the first time ever, shoutout Helsinki). Together, these member-hosted events have garnered nearly a thousand RSVPs from our community. To take Event Keys even further, in May we introduced FWB’s  [Decentralized Dinner series](https://www.fwb.help/decentralized-dinners)  as a way to encourage more members to host local gatherings, and so far this has led to hundreds of participants dining together in locations all over the globe.\n\nThis summer, we encourage more members to think outside the box about new ways to connect with one another IRL and URL. Lite Key and Event Key  [applications](https://discord.com/channels/@me/1105498664505442375/1120473323516739604)  are  _still_  open. And, of course, stay tuned for our next round of prompt-driven events.\n\n### **PARTNERSHIPS**\n\nFWB is on pace to bring in $980,000 through partnerships by the end of Q3—far surpassing our initial goal of bringing in $850,000 by the end of the year. We’ve found the most success centering our partnerships around onboarding web2 brands into the web3 space, and introducing legacy brands to our community through FWB-produced events. Over the course of the next few months, FWB will be focused on bringing community members more directly into the partnership-cultivation process, enabling us to scale up our efforts and overall footprint.\n\n### WHAT'S NEXT: NEW INITIATIVES TO FURTHER DECENTRALIZE FWB\n\nAs a community-owned social network, putting the \"decentralization\" back into \"DAO\" has been at the core of crafting a future for FWB. We want to empower all members to have a sense of ownership and control over the future of the organization, and aim to break away from traditional top-down models where power and decision-making rest in the hands of the few. We are progressively working to distribute authority, empowering all members to have a say in shaping where we're heading.\n\nThis means running elections for future roles and turning previously centralized initiatives into community-led ones. Here are a few of the ways in which the next season will be emphasizing a new level of decentralization for our squad.\n\n### **FWB MAYORAL ELECTION**\n\nHistorically, the FWB Mayor has been tasked with developing FWB into a cohesive community-run organization, leading the founding team in establishing a vision for FWB, and hiring, organizing, and inspiring talent from within the DAO to develop and execute various strategic initiatives. Since FWB’s early days, Alex Zhang has been the DAO’s Mayor, but with the passing of the UNA and as FWB continues to further decentralize, the role of Mayor will evolve to operate as a leader who collaborates directly with the operational team and the community at large. This initiative will include developing an equitable electoral process—including defining the role, outlining the candidate nomination process, and deciding on term limits—and is also established within the association agreement for the UNA. Stay tuned for the proposal discussion to go live in Q3.\n\n### **RELAUNCHING FWB FELLOWSHIPS**\n\nOver the last few months, a team of dedicated FWB members has put forth a proposal to relaunch FWB’s fellowships program. Driven by a desire from the #social-impact channel to take actionable steps to proliferate the knowledge and impact of the DAO, we arrived at  [a proposal to bring a new cohort of 25 fellows into the FWB ecosystem](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/0xb9f515f854f14490b1bd0cdffec0fe58ee0dfe52e0cc272a10bb04348219ccb5), which the community voted in favor of.\n\nWhile the inaugural Fellowships program focused on bringing artists into the DAO to realize creative projects, the next generation of fellows will be a wide-ranging group of creative thinkers and makers working on impact-driven projects.\n\nThe target date for Fellowship applications to open is  **June 30.**\n\n### **COMMUNITY PROPOSAL FUNDING IS AVAILABLE!**\n\nAs we work to further decentralize, it’s important for our community members to play a key role in proposing initiatives that help to determine our organization’s overall roadmap. If you have an idea for an initiative that aligns with FWB’s mission of being the social convening point for the individuals, squads, and institutions using decentralized technology to build a better internet, then be sure to drop a line in  [#governance-general](https://discord.com/channels/749418486874243212/796840302069022730).\n\n### **Q3 PROPOSED BUDGET**\n\nWith the above in mind, below is an overview of the resources we’ll need from the FWB treasury to bring our vision to life.\n\n**Q3 Budget Key Takeaways:**\n\n-   Heading into Q3, we are operating as a lean Contributing Team.

      "title": "FWB Fellowships v2",
      "content": "Author(s): KD, Sinikiwe, Phelps, Renata, Filiberto, Renny, Kiru, Shannon, Nicholas, Ronin, Lia, Leanne + Social Impact channel\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks to re-establish the FWB Fellowships program, with a new cohort of 25 artists, builders, and thinkers interested in broadening their understanding of web3 and making an impact in wider communities. The cohort and educational program will encourage diverse (socioeconomically, racially, gender, and geographically) candidates with a myriad of skill sets to apply. We look to embolden this cohort to take on projects that impact (trans)local communities within and outside of FWB.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThough market conditions have significantly changed since [the first FWB Fellowships proposal passed](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/QmPfJGmtcQKRXjZxJTEbYvmeWByRkpVZ9pRy1dQAdcqZ9e), there is still a financial barrier to entry for many that prohibits joining the FWB community. With [the proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/0xd78fdde0334355a21c65656538f39de326b97f8023dcd1927b10b58ddeab1e34) ratified last year to phase out the Local tier of membership, there is additional need to create meaningful on-ramps for people looking to join FWB and the web3 space at large.\n\nWe believe that FWB can extend the knowledge of the DAO and its members to wider communities, and can engage this opportunity by encouraging fellows to complete projects that foster cross-community collaboration.\n\n## Impact on FWB community\n\nIn line with the update to FWB’s [Mission, Vision and Values](https://snapshot.org/?utm_source=Klaviyo&utm_medium=campaign&_kx=8K-4JtR7couTlf0vVarRO6SctvjeaZ23l-oqwR4iGamNzGygw1NaP0D2cfW5lXjA.SLTiGV#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/0x1f17238ba3b55b00c8b73e84d22d403d04325247ecbf0e57cd95f83452326142), the Fellowships program provides an opportunity for the DAO to welcome new members and communities to convene and build a vision of a better internet. The program embodies several of FWB’s core principles, most notably our commitment to collective effort, being good neighbors, and using web3 tools to engage civically.\n\nThe Fellowship program stands to benefit the FWB community by onboarding a diverse (socioeconomically, racially, gender, and geographically) group of candidates into the DAO, bringing in fresh voices, opinions, and points of view. The Fellowship cohort is intended to act as a container, onboarding Fellows into the FWB community as a peer-group. Past FWB fellows have contributed to the DAO in meaningful ways as core contributors on the Operations, Membership and Editorial teams.\n\nAs this proposed Fellowship program seeks to encourage projects not just of the artistic variety, we hope these projects will also benefit the DAO by increasing visibility to new communities and creative thinkers.\n\n### Testimonial from V1 Fellowships participant\n\n*“The inaugural FWB Fellowships program was my onboarding ramp to the wild world of Web3, and with an almost full year under my belt since “graduation”, I can clearly see the invaluable impact it’s had on my recent trajectory. A web2 vocal artist for over a decade, I minted my first music NFT on Catalog as part of the Fellowships collection. It ended up being snagged by @C.Y. - @cxy, introducing us to each other and opening the floodgates for our epic collaborations. To this day, we’re passionately prototyping important story-telling tools for artists utilizing web3 tech. With weekly mints since fall 2022, and a museum-before-NFT-giftshop on the way, I have never felt so self-aware and confident as an artist. Feel free to check out the evolving narrative here, noting the emphasis on: ✰ collection optional ✰ ☑︎ enjoyment encouraged ☑︎ [https://zez.am/forrestmortifeeNFTs](https://zez.am/forrestmortifeeNFTs) All this is to say, I simply wouldn’t have had the means of entry (nor the push I needed!) to access these levels of alignment, abundance, and adventure this past year without the FWB Fellowships program. 10/10 would recommend to any artist just entering the space! ” - Forrest Mortifee#8565*\n\n## Program Summary\n\nFWB Fellowships v2 seeks to fund a 25-person fellowship cohort, taking place in the Fall of 2023. The Fellowship program will comprise an educational syllabus to onboard the cohort into web3 and the DAO, featuring a speaker series with leading voices in the space and office hours to discuss projects and challenges with the cohort and wider community. Successful completion of the program will also require fellows to complete an impact-minded project, extending the knowledge of the DAO + fellows to wider and broader communities.\n\n### Process: Application, Selection and Program\n\n#### Application\n\nThe program will be open for all non-members and previous Local members to apply, and we will encourage the 400 applicants from the inaugural fellowship program to apply to the cohort. We enthusiastically open this fellowship to artists, builders, and thinkers interested in broadening their understanding of web3. Our desired candidate is inquisitive, seeks to contribute to our community, and because of extenuating circumstances, may otherwise not be able to join our DAO.\n\n#### Selection\n\nApplicants will be selected on the basis of need, merit and skill - as defined below.\n\n-   Need: One of the core motivations for Fellowships is to provide opportunities for candidates who may come from a less advantageous socioeconomic position.\n    \n-   Merit: Those who have a penchant for creativity, a desire to make a thing, and a propensity to develop into tomorrow’s thought leaders.\n  \n-   Skill: Those with who are keen to utilize their present skill set to create projects which will have an impact on the FWB and broader communities.\n    \nA committee of self-nominated FWB members (including the authors of this document, membership Host Committee, and other members interested in participating) will select a 25-person shortlist, which will be brought to the wider membership group for final selection in a Snapshot vote.\n\n#### Program\n\nThe 25 selected candidates will take part in a 3 month fellowship cohort. The cohort will complete an educational program of synchronous and asynchronous material, including introductions to web3, wallet safety, and the speaker series, as well as an impact-minded project.\n\nEach cohort will also have access to a current FWB member who will act as a guide and lead “Studio” channels in the Discord, which will break the cohort into smaller pods for discussion and questions. To complement the Discord studios, bi-weekly office hours will be held in the voice chat to discuss projects with the FWB community.\n\nTo demarcate the beginning and end of the Fellowship cohort, and to establish rituals within the group and DAO, commencement and “graduation” events will be planned in the voice chat and on Twitter Spaces.\n\nAlongside completion of the education program, Fellows will be required to use their skills on an impact-based project, either within or outside of the FWB ecosystem. This could be hosting an event, participating in a local community project, creating an art piece, or another initiative relevant to the Fellow. The project will need to be completed by the end of the cohort cycle in November 2023.\n\n## Roadmap\n\n**May 2023**\n-   Proposal is brought to community for feedback and discussion\n    \n-   Insights from feedback round integrated into proposal and brought to vote on Snapshot\n\n**June 2023**\n-   Fellowships [application](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SQYWgD_y4aiNTQBbciYK3RDecmanHVOf5sDJmE_4aMo/edit?usp=sharing) developed, with consideration of inaugural Fellowship [application](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SQYWgD_y4aiNTQBbciYK3RDecmanHVOf5sDJmE_4aMo/edit?usp=sharing)\n    \n-   Open call for Fellowships Selection Committee and Fellowships Guides within FWB\n\n**July 2023**\n\n-   Fellowship applications open for 4 weeks\n    \n-   Education syllabus developed\n    \n\n**August 2023**\n\n-   Speaker series confirmed\n    \n-   Fellows selected by fellowship committee\n    \n-   Fellows notified and prompted to mint non-transferable NFT\n    \n**September 2023**\n\n-   Fellowships program begins, kicking off with commencement voice chat with the DAO\n    \n-   Weekly speaker series\n    \n-   Bi-weekly Office Hours in the voice chat, all members encouraged to join to meet and follow Fellows journey\n    \n**October 2023**\n\n-   Fellowships program continues, projects are confirmed and production work begins\n    \n-   Weekly speaker series continues\n    \n-   Bi-weekly Office Hours continues   \n\n**November 2023**\n\n-   Cohort completion, projects are finished and presented to the community in the Discord voice chat and Twitter Spaces\n    \n## Outcomes\n\n-   Fellows will be required to use their skills on an impact-based project, either within or outside of the FWB ecosystem. This could be hosting an event, participating in a local community project, creating an art piece, or another initiative relevant to the Fellow\n    \n-   Fellows will be granted a membership NFT to join FWB\n    \n-   Fellows will gain working knowledge of the Web3 ecosystem\n  \n\n### Looking forward\n\nIdeally, the Fellowships will become an evergreen program in FWB, taking place twice per year and constantly growing and incorporating feedback from previous cohorts. To iterate on the program, program facilitators, number of fellowships awarded, and budget, proposals will be brought to the community each year.\n\n## Resourcing and budget\n\n#### Operations Requirements\n\n\n***Fellowship Coordinator - Sinikiwe Stephanie Dhliwayo***\n\n\nThe Fellowships Coordinator for 6 months (June- November 2023) will be responsible for overseeing the fellowships program.

From making the proper introductions where possible to providing logistical support.\n\n\nThe Fellowships Coordinator will book and coordinate all the biweekly fellowships meetings, including booking speakers and facilitating those sessions.\n\n  \n\nThe Fellowships Coordinator will also champion the mental and physical well-being of the fellows. The pace of web3 is often fast moving and not forgiving when it pertains to taking time to step away. The fellowships coordinator will ensure that the fellows feel supported in the process of the fellowships program.\n\n  \n\nThe coordinator will be remunerated @ 0.75 ETH/month (part-time) for 3 months, for a total of 2.25 ETH from the Fellowships treasury.\n\n  \n\nDuring the active months of the Fellowship cohort, the coordinator will be remunerated @ 3000$ USD/month (full-time) for 3 months, for a total of $9000 from FWB treasury.\n\n  \n\n***Fellowship Facilitators - KD + FWB member TBC***\n\n  \n\nTwo fellowship facilitators will assist the Fellowship Coordinator in developing the Fellowships curriculum, stewarding the application process, onboarding fellows and seeing projects through to completion.\n\n  \n\nThe 2 facilitators will each be remunerated @ 20 $FWB/month for 6 months (June-November 2023), for a total of 240 $FWB from Fellowships treasury.\n\n  \n  \n\n***Fellowship Committee - Host Committee + FWB members TBC***\n\n  \n\nFollowing the application period, the Fellowship Committee will determine the short-list of Fellows for the wider FWB community to vote on. The Committee will be composed of current Host Committee members and self-nominated FWB members.\n\n  \n\nThe 20 committee members will be remunerated 10 $FWB (1 time, August 2023), for a total of 200 $FWB from Fellowships treasury.\n\n  \n\n***Fellowship Guides - FWB members TBC***\n\n  \n\nThe Fellowship Guides will lead Discord “studio” channels, engaging with Fellows in onboarding to FWB and questions about the DAO and web3 at large.\n\n  \n\n5 guides will be remunerated @ 10 $FWB/month for 3 months (September-November 2023), totalling 150 $FWB from Fellowships treasury.\n\n  \n\n***Fellowship speakers - TBC***\n\n  \n\nAs part of the Fellowships curriculum, 5 speakers will be invited to engage with the cohort and discuss their professional journeys.\n\n  \n\n5 speakers will be remunerated @ 10 $FWB, totalling 50 $FWB from Fellowships treasury.\n\n  \n\n***Fellowship NFTs***\n\n  \n\nThis proposal asks for 25 transferable membership NFTs to be minted by the DAO and transferred to Fellows, with gas fees to be covered by the DAO.\n\n  \n  \n\n\n#### Budget\n\nFellowships [treasury](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0xAdaa224be0779aF13C3820F67a8FF28E894A917F)\n\n| Fellowships v2 Budget             |       |   \n|-----------------------------------|-------|\n| Total ETH (Fellowships Treasury)  | 2.25  | \n| Total USDC (FWB Treasury)         | 9,000 |   \n| Total $FWB (Fellowships Treausry) | 640   |   \n\n---\n\n| **Fellowships budget**                | **Jun-23** | **July-23** | **Aug-23** | **Sept-23** | **Oct-23** | **Nov-23** | **Total** |\n|---------------------------------------|------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------|------------|-----------|\n| Fellowships Coordinator (ETH)         | 0.75       | 0.75        | 0.75       | 0           | 0          | 0          | 2.25      |\n| Fellowships Coordinator (USDC)        | 0          | 0           | 0          | 3,000       | 3,000      | 3,000      | 9,000     |\n| Fellowships Facilititator (x2) ($FWB) | 40         | 40          | 40         | 40          | 40         | 40         | 240       |\n| Fellowships Committee (x20) ($FWB)    | 0          | 0           | 200        | 0           | 0          | 0          | 200       |\n| Fellowship Guides (x5) ($FWB)         | 0          | 0           | 0          | 50          | 50         | 50         | 150       |\n| Fellowship Speakers (x5) ($FWB)       | 0          | 0           | 0          | 0           | 0          | 50         | 50        |\n\n\n#### Discussion Call \n[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12mru6duM6Sdoub5YcRdx9Ij_wNmsxaJq/view?usp=sharing) is a link to the recording of the Fellowships v2 proposal discussion call.",

Future headlines could include “FWB member @sisterjam improved morale once again by turning shakedown street into more of a minor league baseball game atmosphere. Allowing friends to pay him to shoot their friends with food wrapped inside of a limited edition bootleg t-shirt.” I also want this to be an example for our decentralized future in terms of voting on proposals submitted from our community.\n\n## Overview\n\nVOTE YES - T Shirt Cannon Secured - See u at fest.\n\n## Details\n\nFWB OG SISTERJAM IMPROVES MORALE.\n\n## Discussion\n\nAfter community input, I have decided to purchase a less expensive model. The prices of renting vs owning this model are similar. I think we might as well own it.\n\n## Outcomes & success measures\n\nSick pics on IG, meeting cool FWB type peeps IRL.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nJust trying to step it up every year forever.\n\n## Budget requested\n\n$3,500 USD  \n$1K for hot dog/t shirt cannon  \n$1.5K for merch to put into cannon  \n$250 for free food to put in cannon  \n$750 - transportation/logistics/shirt design\n\n## Timeline\n\n1.

      "title": "System Upgrade: Establishing A Software Company",
      "content": "*Authors: Jose Mejia, Mike Bodge, Hirad Sab, Dexter Tortoriello*\n\n### **Summary**\n\nCurrently, FWB exists as one entity in which all of our emergent activities are housed—including product, membership, events, partnerships, marketing, etc. While these various initiatives are symbiotic in nature, we’ve realized that some of them require different organizational structures, levels of centralization, governing frameworks, and operational strategies to thrive.\n\nThis proposal would be the first step of a two-step process (outlined below) to upgrade FWB’s organizational and legal structures:\n\n\n\n1. Establish a new Software C-Corp that strives to create expanded use cases for the $FWB token.\n2. Wrap the FWB Community DAO in an Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (“UNA”) that serves as the parent entity of the FWB ecosystem (note that this will be brought to vote in a separate proposal). \n\nWe see establishing a Software C-Corp as a necessary next step for properly resourcing FWB’s software initiatives, reducing the DAO’s overall burn rate, and allowing the DAO to focus on an increasingly decentralized operational structure oriented around serving the interests of the FWB community. \n\n**Key benefits of this restructuring:**\n\n\n\n* Enable the C-Corp to raise capital from outside investors so they can appropriately staff the team\n* Give the C-Corp more operational freedom, so they can build better products for FWB members more efficiently\n* Create an opportunity for a focused team to work more effectively at expanding the utility of the $FWB token\n* Reduce FWB’s treasury burn by 41% per month, increasing the DAO’s overall runway \n* Free the DAO from the risks and volatility associated with product development\n* Allow the DAO to focus on further decentralization, and on community needs and interests\n\n\n### **Full Background**\n\nFriends With Benefits began as a tokenized community experiment before the concept of a DAO became popular. Over time, it has grown into a unique entity made up of a variety of interrelated components that all live under one umbrella. While you can think of FWB as a network of 4,000+ members and core contributors who share ideas and gather together all over the globe, it is also a producer of an arts & culture festival, and the developer of several software products designed to make interacting with web3 communities more fun and exciting.\n\nWhen you evaluate the needs of the FWB community against the needs of FWB’s software team, major points of tension become apparent. In its current state, these facets of FWB hamper one another from flourishing properly:\n\n\n\n1. The Product Team’s burn impairs the DAO’s runway significantly\n2. Conversely, the fact that the Product Team can’t scale to hire more engineers constrains the ability to ship better software faster\n3. The organizational needs of both sides create tension; the community would benefit from further decentralization and proposal-driven decision-making, while the software team requires agile and opinionated work from full-time builders.\n\nTo put it another way, while the DAO needs to focus on creating a community-controlled pathway towards sustainable revenue generation, the software entity needs more centralization and increased resources to deliver on its ambitious vision. When forced to exist under the same umbrella, each activity limits the ability of the other to be truly successful.\n\nFor the benefit of the entirety of FWB as an entity, we propose to restructure the DAO into two separate legal entities: \n\n\n\n\n1. An Unincorporated Nonprofit Association, the most legally sound wrapper for the DAO’s range of community-focused activities\n2. A venture-backed Software C-Corp that focuses on developing products used by the FWB membership base and the DAO’s surrounding ecosystem\n\nThe key reasons for this restructuring are: \n\n\n\n\n1. A UNA is the most legally sound wrapper for the DAO, protecting all members from legal liability while allowing for the DAO to progressively decentralize over time\n    1. A separate proposal for approving the DAO’s formation of the UNA will be published for discussion following this proposal\n2. A venture-backed C-Corp is a proven vehicle for accelerating the software development process and delivering world-class products for FWB members to use and benefit from\n3. Restructuring in this way will extend the DAOs runway from 12.7 to 20.7 months\n4. FWB DAO is generating significant revenue ($1.1M in 2022) but not enough to sustain both the community initiatives and a team of in-house engineers\n5. The FWB DAO has only approximately 134,197 $FWB tokens in its treasury (13% of supply) which renders a token sale as a fundraising mechanic via the DAO impractical\n\n\n### **Software C-Corp Details**\n\n**Mission** \n\n\nThe venture-backed software-focused C-Corp would focus primarily on building best-in-class software used by FWB DAO and its members. From FWB.app to Gatekeeper and beyond, the C-Corp strives to create an expanded set of use cases for the $FWB token and make participating in the FWB ecosystem easier and more rewarding.\n\n**Ownership Structure**\n\nThe FWB DAO will own 25% of the C-Corp upon incorporation. The founding team (currently the FWB Product team) will retain 56% ownership of the C-Corp, vesting over the course of four years. 19% of the shares would be held in an options pool for future hires.\n\nThe founding team’s ownership stake is an incentive mechanism to reward them for their commitment to building the C-Corp into a valuable extension of FWB DAO that enhances the experience of FWB DAO members, while the vesting mechanism ensures that this ownership stake is earned. The options pool, similarly, will be used to create competitive compensation packages to attract the best possible talent to the team.\n\nInitial Ownership Structure:\n\n- FWB DAO: 25%\n- Founding Team: 56%\n- Options Pool: 19%\n\n\n**Capitalization**\n\nThe C-Corp would, pending approval of this proposal, raise $5M at a $20M valuation. Capital would be raised from investors who participated in the previous FWB DAO fundraise in order to maximize incentive alignment, instead of introducing new investors into the FWB ecosystem who do not already have a vested interest in FWB’s overall vision and success.\n\n**Key Provisions**\n\nIn order for the DAO and C-Corp to be successful, they need to operate symbiotically yet interdependently. In order to do so, we’re proposing that the C-Corp and DAO enter into a legally binding agreement containing the following terms and conditions:\n\n\n\n* The C-Corp will exist to create software products that expand the use case of the $FWB token\n* One of the C-Corp’s board seats would be occupied by the FWB DAO mayor position, representing the interests of the FWB DAO directly\n* The C-Corp, once capitalized, will complete a series of purchases of $FWB tokens. Those tokens will be held on the C-Corp’s balance sheet in order to further align the new C-Corp with the FWB DAO, using those tokens primarily as part of compensation packages for future employees.\n\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe intent of this proposal is to begin the process of restructuring FWB into a more efficient and well-defined set of organizational units.\n\nThe best possible path forward for FWB is one in which the DAO can operate in a leaner, more decentralized and proposal-driven capacity, with the aim of becoming financially sustainable without the need to take on additional venture capital. Meanwhile, the new C-Corp can focus solely on delivering best-in-class software for FWB DAO members and the FWB ecosystem.\n\nThe vision of FWB becoming a new kind of collective social network experience is ambitious and daunting, but meaningful and one worth pursuing.  We believe this establishes a framework for future home-grown products and experiences that gain enough traction to be established and grown in an incentive-aligned way that ultimately drives value back to the FWB DAO.",

      "title": "Membership Mechanic Upgrade",
      "content": "\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to upgrade FWB's membership system by introducing a non-transferrable NFT to represent community membership. This new NFT will exist alongside the $FWB token, which will continue to represent FWB governance and ownership.\n\nAs FWB continues to evolve, it has become clear that a multi-token model is needed, as the current single-token system poses a number of challenges. Under the current system, the purchase of membership tokens generates no meaningful revenue for the DAO treasury. Additionally, relying solely on $FWB makes it difficult for us to push the DAO towards a more decentralized, egalitarian form of governance.\n\nThis proposal offers a solution to these issues, all while advancing FWB's economic design and increasing the utility of the $FWB token. We believe approving this proposal will also help the organization move toward a more progressive and decentralized structure, with a more egalitarian form of community-driven governance.\n\n## Core Objectives\n\nBelow are the four core objectives we hope to accomplish with this proposal, along with some of the changes this will entail for the DAO.\n\n**1. Establish a sustainable revenue-generating model for the community treasury.**\n\nNow: Currently, approved new members enter the DAO by obtaining $FWB tokens from Uniswap's AMM protocol. This means that the funds members are spending to join FWB aren’t being captured by the FWB treasury.\n\nFuture: An NFT-based membership model will allow FWB to generate direct revenue through the sale of membership NFT passes, contributing to the community-controlled treasury.\n\n**2. Introduce membership entry mechanics that are accessible and sustainable over time.**\n\nNow: Fluctuations in the $FWB token value have made entry cost volatile and unequal for members, meaning that a member who joins one year may pay more or less than someone who onboards later.\n\nFuture: By pivoting to a fixed-price membership NFT pass, we will ensure that membership costs stay stable, making the FWB community more accessible. \n\n  \n\n\n**3. Establish a more egalitarian governance model by employing a dual NFT + $FWB token voting system.**\n\nNow: Our current $FWB-based voting system skews governance outcomes heavily towards the interests of large holders, meaning that people who hold hundreds or even thousands of $FWB have much more of a voice in the voting process than members who possess only the requisite 75 $FWB needed to join.  \n\nFuture: Through a new NFT + governance token voting structure whereby the NFT is tied to a membership application and account, voting would become more egalitarian and ultimately more consistent with the values of the DAO. \n\n**4. Expand non-member use cases of the $FWB token.**\n\nNow: Currently, the utility of the $FWB token is mostly tied to membership and governance. Individuals who want additional access, depth, or interaction with the FWB community or FWB software currently do not have ways to meaningfully do so. \n\nFuture: Non-members who hold $FWB will be able to access events, content, and experiences by holding various amounts of $FWB, broadening who can engage with FWB's expanding range of touchpoints and channels. This could include access to events,  content (for example, token-gated guides and resources), and other opportunities.\n\n## FWB Citizenship: Membership NFT\n\nPending this proposal passing, FWB membership will be denoted by an official non-transferrable NFT that is unique to each member, and which represents a member’s access, governance rights, and identity inside of the FWB ecosystem.\n\nNew members who wish to join FWB will need to apply, and then upon acceptance, purchase an FWB membership for a fixed price via an FWB secured smart contract. The fixed price will be denominated in USDC and payable in both USDC or an equivalent amount of ETH.\n\nUpon purchasing their FWB membership, each new member will receive two kinds of tokens:\n\n1. A single, non-transferable “soulbound” NFT, representing their membership\n2. $FWB tokens (worth 50% of membership cost), representing their ownership in the network, staked for 3 months\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/t0vvOSkCLjn-TEB52KDPKZCPC0csKWZ1DfEuPGsY7xuOBtN6d8Dr4k47uhQ49Ii-iIQnuYua1sDM1uT7k2l29Cx_FJbRFLEneuRO1dX0pQ-LVSzgzRDTKHxHOUCglzNsr9Z6TizIQFAz3vA35FvPa_A)\n\nProceeds generated from membership sales will be routed in two ways:\n\n- 50% to FWB DAO Treasury\n- 50% to $FWB token buy\n\nThis achieves several goals: \n\n1. Generates revenue for the FWB DAO\n2. Introduces an identity NFT for all members for more egalitarian governance\n3. Ties member growth to the $FWB token\n4. Allows each member to own $FWB, the community currency, ensuring incentives are aligned across the network.\n\n## Migration: How Existing Members Will Migrate to NFT Membership\n\n**Full Members**\n\nAs of February 9th, 2023, **existing members** who hold 75 $FWB are able to claim a non-transferable NFT and onboard onto the FWB app.\n\nPending this proposal passing, on July 31st, 2023, FWB membership will confer to the Member NFT. In order to experience uninterrupted access to the FWB Discord/gain access to the FWB app, members will need to claim their NFT by that date. Failing to claim the NFT by that date will result in losing access to the Discord until the NFT is claimed.\n\n**Local Members**\n\nLocal Members will be given an extension date on their FWB full membership trial. They will now have access to the full Discord server until July 31st, 2023. \n\nFor a limited time, local members will be given the opportunity to purchase full FWB membership at a discounted rate. Locals buying full membership at the discounted price will follow the same process outlined above of paying a fixed fee in exchange for their Membership NFT and being able to claim their escrowed $FWB tokens after 3 months.\n\n## Updated Governance Model \n\nIn this NFT-based membership model, the FWB DAO will be able to experiment with more egalitarian, sybil-resistant voting mechanisms that ensure every member’s voice is heard, and that promote more community-driven proposals. \n\n\n## **Features of the new voting system:**\n\nFor Members\n\n  - The membership NFT will allow you to submit a proposal directly to the treasury\n\n  - The membership NFT will equal 1 vote\n\n  - Additional FWB tokens, when paired with the NFT, will add weight to your vote but without aggressively skewing the results\n\n    - The additional weighting will be similar to that of a [quadratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting) voting system, where a token-holder’s marginal voting power decreases with each additional token. This limits whales’ power, while still rewarding those who hold extra tokens in more moderate amounts.![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Xds09ok28Eh6rN8m4YeHA5723YXYCBO_DXYG384lm0kwzviEJzFVyfM5SNt3ZYvbBWHx2MrG8EJj2xPsFwxoO8QMGoWgFShiv3BJcpo0CKBJEvZUjMPEV7mgzGWk-5huq_acGya9aEwpYnNnlPPGPsM)\n    \n   For Non-Members\n   \n   -   Without the NFT but with $FWB tokens, your voting power will be:![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/VKo8uZ0bvsv903x1J3M3hIca_IAgh6B24TrrVtayq9nZT2e_ZD4OXf4ppfiGc_3HaQnnOTCtvgQmAVovrRNrVXKiupBD9BHFdveOXFNZjme17ZCrEC-H5HIK6l_d7RQiprdimj_n_-dfHtCk5csjJgA)\n\nIf this proposal passes, we will use the current token-weighted strategy until July 31st, 2023, when membership is conferred to the NFT. On that date, we will shift to the NFT + token-boost model outlined above.\n\n**Advantages of This Proposal:**\n\n1. FWB DAO gains a revenue stream through new entrants\n2. FWB can further decentralize and shift to a more proposal-based model with the introduction of a more egalitarian voting system\n3. Upgradable model that isn’t irreversible and destructive to FWB economic design\n4. Allows for future $FWB token use case design that isn’t tied to membership resulting in gating future members out \n5. Membership growth can be controlled by the community\n\n**Disadvantages of This Proposal:**\n\n1. The membership and governance models may become more complex\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSince the inception of FWB, the DAO has embraced continued experimentation and iteration, often charting new paths forward as _a community that uses crypto_—not a crypto community. \n\nUpdating the membership mechanics is a significant step in helping FWB achieve its [long-term vision](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/0x1f17238ba3b55b00c8b73e84d22d403d04325247ecbf0e57cd95f83452326142) of becoming a new kind of social network. This proposal also addresses core issues around revenue, accessibility, and community-driven governance while creating future opportunities for the community to build upon the $FWB token. \n\n**Note: All dates listed above are subject to change and remain pending the approval of the proposal by the community.**\n",

      "title": "FWB Q2 Strategy & Budget",
      "content": "FWB is gearing up for a busy next three months, full of system upgrades that are intended to set us up for long-term success. In order to make these upgrades happen, the Q2 budget needs to be approved.\n\nBased on our community’s feedback that budget votes need to include more context, this time we’re trying a new format: releasing an overall Q2 strategy plan alongside the proposed Q2 budget.\n\nThe following overview should provide a holistic view of the contributing team’s strategy for the next 90 days—including the initiatives and proposals that we’re working on producing, how they’ll benefit you as a member, how much they’ll cost to execute, and how you can help shape them. This should make it clear what you’re voting for or against with respect to the Q2 budget. \n\n## A Look Back at Q1\n\nAt the end of last year, [we collectively voted on a revised vision](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/0x1f17238ba3b55b00c8b73e84d22d403d04325247ecbf0e57cd95f83452326142) for the direction of FWB. As we defined it, “FWB believes in the promise of a better internet—one where communities and authentic connections thrive, where creativity is valued, and where the future can be collaboratively built.” In action, this has meant leaning into FWB as “a new kind of social network” that values intimacy over scale, that is collectively governed, and that produces meaningful digital and physical experiences.\n \nIn Q1, we took a major step towards realizing our outlined vision by launching the FWB app. As a still-evolving digital infrastructure, it gets us much closer to becoming the new kind of social network we want to be. Since the app’s launch in early February, we’re proud to have onboarded 34% of our members, with a 75% retention rate—combined with a meaningful boost in new membership applications, with 230 people applying in February, more than December and January combined. This is hopefully just the beginning of what our community can accomplish with our own social software powering our collective energy.\n\nHere’s what community members have to say about the app:\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/wWE7fWSSgTfSmoTCXAr9U4DpK_g5jo2oZ_0DuVDJr4Fs_EljpHctf7fzBH0ZV1-llXMZt45S-7yTweXJefEkSzcGOMiiztSr3JsLQo31xjVlNL-_ZnlBeePMMz4vbHaXXi6g3kCEEY-zTwuIpdGlOUg)\nA few more 2023 Q1 highlights:\n\n-   We hosted flagship FWB events in Mexico, Denver, and Austin\n    \n-   Community members hosted 13 local FWB events in nine different cities\n    \n-   We passed the proposal to bring FWB FEST back in 2023. This year’s community’s festival and conference will take place August 3-6 in Idyllwild, CA.\n    \n-   We introduced a major discussion around updating FWB’s membership mechanics through the introduction of an NFT-based membership pass.\n    \n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qvpq7Y-KOrQ6sQRgZ0JoNeYIX6LZ2NuF0TZtAU5jzLDw1mxLAfNSveOeebLi97e9JmokicMgexhHbbpt4NFMkygfGfijmMUjxmRrMhwvPNNWZWFCbERAgjTRlS2G9qMlq5otxHvrF38v4qCYahUvFiU)\n\n## Strategic Vision for Q2\n\nOver the next 90 days, our core goal is to pilot a sustainable revenue model for the FWB DAO, while making some major system upgrades that will set FWB up for long-term success. \n\nBelow is an outline of the key proposals and initiatives that make up the bulk of FWB’s Q2 strategy. **Note that if the Q2 budget passes, the proposals outlined below will each have their own discussion period, and will be voted on individually. This means that the details and nuances of each proposal can be sussed out then, once the overall Q2 strategy and budget are approved.**\n\n### System Upgrade Proposal 1: Membership Mechanics\n\nThis proposal will introduce an NFT-based membership pass as the primary marker of FWB membership, instead of holding 75 $FWB. The idea is that upon a new member’s application being approved, they would need to purchase a membership NFT—either as a cohort with other members joining at the same time, or on the secondary NFT market. Additionally, this proposal creates new use cases for the $FWB token, such as community software licensing capabilities, guest access to various FWB properties, and more.\n\n ### System Upgrade Proposal 2: Establishing a Software C-Corp for FWB\n\nThis proposal will call for the formation of a new software-focused C-Corp that will be partially owned by FWB. We see this as a necessary next step to properly resource FWB’s burgeoning product initiatives, while also ensuring the FWB DAO’s long-term sustainability. The proposal outlines key reasons why this restructuring is necessary, and shares a vision for ensuring the FWB DAO and software C-Corp will function in a way that is mutually beneficial and aligned—giving both organizations the best chance to flourish.\n\n ### System Upgrade Proposal 3: Establishing FWB DAO as an UNA\n\nThis proposal calls for the formation of an Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (“UNA”) around the FWB DAO to ensure long-term compliance and sustainability. Additionally, this proposal highlights the long-term objectives of the FWB DAO, including our aim to operate under a cash-flow generating, break-even model with a progressively decentralized contributing team that is proposal-based, and focuses on the proliferation of the $FWB token.\n\n ### Launch 2023 FWB FEST\n\nWith the near-unanimous vote of pursuing FWB FEST 2023, our Events and Marketing team has been pushing full-steam ahead on the festival launch, which is currently slated for March 21, 2023. FWB Fest will take place August 3-6, 2023, at the same venue as last year, but with a whole new lineup of performers, speakers, vendors, and more. Existing members will receive discounted pricing, as well as the ability to extend their discount to a friend. We are projecting roughly $179,500 of revenue from the community sale, which will go back to the community treasury with a total projection of $ 879,000 of revenue on the entire event through ticket sales and partnerships.\n\n### FWB App Development\n\nNow that the FWB App is in the hands of our community, our focus is on continued community onboarding. Our Q1 goal was to have 25% of the community onboarded after launch, which we easily achieved. We are now at 38% of total eligible members onboarded. We currently have major product releases in the works, all of which have been shaped based on community input—from distinct channels to peer messaging and profiles, all of which are slated to come out in Q2.\n\n### Leveraging Partnerships\n\nTo date, FWB has excelled at forging partnerships with other brands and communities in the ecosystem who want to collaborate with our community. During Q2, we will capitalize on important groundwork we laid in Q1, with a meaningful percentage of our annual projected $800,000 coming to the FWB treasury in partnership value—most of which will be produced through FWB Events and FWB Fest.\n\n### Shifting Membership to a Cohort Model\n\nTo better welcome incoming members and retain current members, the Membership team is preparing a cohort onboarding model. Cohorts will have dedicated Discord channels, FWB App identifiers, and digital events programming. In addition to cohorts, we’re also looking to support an upcoming Fellowships proposal to further assist in onboarding new members, and extend the knowledge and impact of the DAO. And for day dot members, keep your eyes peeled for new projects and content in-app—from member profiles to city guides.\n\n**![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6nz-Va_BRW8q_uodAh805-z9_PcLv1oVosZWXfdQHmd-B54yQaOICCnXnSB1aim5LPal4vIfuFnOXS4LbG2F1rJG2c9rQNQ0A-PMwehEn7Mbcp9pNNU2LICn2VsfAjSHGqfeHokUuJ4pwfDuFHlU-1w)**\n\n## Q2 Budget Proposal\n\n To execute the above initiatives, the FWB ops team is proposing the following budget for Q2 (April–June, 2023). During this time, the core focus for FWB DAO will be on cash conservation to extend our runway until a predictable revenue model is in place. The full Q2 Financial Package can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xpdxov6Ws0BJViOdqRdPbN2YdwCq-Q0n/view?usp=share_link), and a summary is below.\n\n**Q2 Budget Key Takeaways: How We're Reducing Burn**\n\n - Select core contributors are switching from full-time to part-time roles.\n - The Marketing and Editorial team are winding down to focus on member communications.\n -  Pending the FWB Software C-Corp Proposal, the Product team will be shifting off the FWB DAO payroll in June.\n -  Recurring payroll spends will continue to decrease over the quarter according to transition policies.\n - In addition to reduced burn, we have a strong partnership pipeline in Q2.\n\n **Overall, FWB’s primary goal this quarter is to extend runway to *20.71* months and launch a sustainable revenue stream through membership.**\n  ![enter image description here](https://uc477fb1231bf8b0b3d1fbb918b1.previews.dropboxusercontent.com/p/thumb/AB1Pi_2102IIdODvSheZvP7rZ9KvXVrhkvBPT00r2l5VETmQNzFMqhh3J9J3PCeZ4cJf_zemJEZC4S3SzMJ8cWUY-E76CZ7nSF1NxIWdXGhJCZKM-9fyuubkUrojB2mkI8HJoYiUfp-dlJQ5NaIqJuOasdy-Mn26YhDK01FejIVTSZeOHXQEwOO2tJA0dHOUnj9sjuaewV4-KDi2Uo4RjenSWOdf2wK0ln40TDLPc1dkb6I8dw0AsQV1i-eudLryxj5hM-ZYbfMb_l2ujbMsOQu5nukgReQSnVO8QgTf_oh2BqyZXY4mt8nuWHOquNsn3NAkgo5Mcyz9Pi6xNVHHLPe5NAftDrdDdbLEr36-SUgP1aehIA2aswKN8vk0_P-Jp9sulWAeUz3s1EsFO2yT-0Lv1e-mOnKGiRHR1bj-mxodzg/p.png)\n\n### Q2 Budget Details\n\n - Detail breakout of request approvals/expenses may be found here: **[Q2 2023 Operating Budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bsrVfda_Zogm2-Vnkyw9O3S0mgVRbahL1tsw9lTD-QU/edit#gid=663667867)**\n - Summary of community-approved Snapshot proposals and their corresponding payouts may be found here: **[Q2 2023 Approved Snapshots Budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kZfRuj1VbTeOaWgx9TisUZDle-lZ-Q5UoZki8_Kn7KA/edit#gid=0)**\n - Breakdown of the Q1 Actuals can be found here: **[Q1 2023 Summary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b5qrN7rgns6u3GU9AKHOBNUcsSq0T6yE0i1YDF7MJM0/edit#gid=667303478)**\n\n### 2023 Q2 KPIs\n\nIf our Q2 strategy is properly executed, we believe we will see the following results:\n\n - FWB Fest will drive ticket sale revenue of $179,500.\n - Our new NFT-based membership model will begin driving revenue through new entrants. \n - We'll have the ability to properly resource the software C-Corp\n   through venture capital investments.\n   We'll see a membership conversion improvement from 56% to 70%.\n\n### Get Involved\n\nTo help ensure FWB gets where it needs to go, we encourage all members to be as active and engaged as possible over the next 90 days. Here's how:\n\n - Participate in the live community discussion call happening on **March 23, 2023 at 1pm EST.**\n - **Attend upcoming new member hangouts and community calls.** Check the events schedule in the app and the #governance channel for updates.\n - **Share your feedback on the app.** How can we evolve it to better suit your needs as a community member? Let our Product team know via the #canary-mine channel.\n - **Participate in upcoming governance discussions.** New proposals are always dropped in the [#live-proposal-discussions channel](https://discord.com/channels/749418486874243212/871132840744607745), and in the app’s Official feed. With several System Upgrade proposals going live soon, be sure to jump into the Discord chat to see the questions other members are asking or to ask your own.\n - **Organize an event in your city, or online.** Read the proposal outlining our Event Keys strategy [here](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/0xe56d7611bce263812eb9bbc3561e16f0788b44217a94bf79eb61b99f9a689a2a), and apply to host an event [here](https://airtable.com/shrc5EUz38bCrtxax).\n - **Attend FWB events!** The full roster is always available at fwb.help/events, and via the app’s Events tab.\n\n### Looking to the Future\n\nWhen FWB originated in 2020, proven frameworks didn’t yet exist for running a DAO. It’s been our privilege and challenge to be a pioneering organization in this space. We’ve collectively made meaningful strides with our governance and income models, launched our own social app, developed our own cultural festival, created a fully decentralized events programming model, and built a solid brand and thriving community from scratch—just to name a few of our accomplishments.\n\nWe’ve also had setbacks, and some of our experiments and initiatives haven’t hit the mark. But given everything we’ve learned over the past two years, FWB is well positioned to make these upgrades and we want to thank everyone for their patience and understanding as we navigate and learn together.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we hope to reach a place where the majority of members and token holders feel excited about the Q2 strategy. Then we’ll be able to make the system upgrades happen, move forward in a sustainable manner, and refocus our energy on creating meaningful experiences for and with the community.",

Below is a summary of those changes along with details on other initiatives that will be rolled out in the coming weeks and months.\n\n1.  **Progressive Decentralization**: With the ultimate goal of making FWB truly decentralized, the core team began transitioning its payroll strategy from full time / part time employees into more proposal based. To accomplish this, FWB engaged in deep cuts across payroll and other costs. Our average monthly spend in Season 7 was $305,460, while our average monthly spend in Season 8 will be $196,951, which translates to a 35% reduction in costs. This results in a lower monthly burn, but also hands over more decision making power from individuals back to the community.\n    \n2.  **Revenue**: The core team’s primary focus in 2023 will be solidifying and amplifying our existing revenue streams. We anticipate revenue from multiple sources, including partnerships, Fest and entry fees from the implementation of the new membership model. In 2022, FWB generated approximately $1.13m in revenue.\n    \n3.  **Runway**: If we are able to meet our conservative goal of $800,000 in revenue in 2023, across partnerships, membership and Fest, then our model suggests we have an estimated 17 months of runway. Our restructuring and reductions in costs has positioned us well as we progress into 2023 and look to become even more financially sustainable in 2024.\n    \n4.  **Labs**: An important future reduction in cost that will occur in Q2, 2023 will be the transition of the product team from recurring payroll into its own entity, to be determined via a proposal.\n    \n### Conclusion\nThe proposed Season 8 Operating Budget totals approximately $202,101 in expenditures per month. Additionally, the Snapshot proposals budget previously approved by the FWB community averages approximately $28,938 in expenditures per month.

      "content": "\nAuthors: Greg Bresnitz, Paul Tao, Zach Tetreault, Alex Zhang\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis proposal is to decide as a community on whether or not we host and produce FWB FEST 2023 this August 10 - 13, 2023.\n\nIt outlines a vision for how FWB FEST cements itself as the recurring annual gathering point for our community, along with a business model, budget request, and a review of FWB FEST 2022 and last year’s P&L. \n\n**Background – FWBFEST22**\n\nOn August 10-12, 2022, the FWB community hosted FWB FEST 2022,  a three-day festival and conference that brought our digital city to life roughly 500 members from the FWB community together in one place for the first time.\n\nThe venue was the Idyllwild Arts Academy, an 80-acre arts campus in the mountains of Idyllwild, California. We utilized the existing lecture halls for discourse and talks, amphitheaters for musical performances, and the surrounding woods and campus grounds for workshops, outdoor recreation, and experiences. \n\nThe event, which featured performances and talks from James Blake, Pussy Riot’s Nadya Tolokonnikova, Oneohtrix Point Never, JPEG Mafia, Telefon Tel Aviv, Uniswap founder Hayden Adams, and Other Internet’s Toby Shorin, drove significant public engagement on social media and drew coverage from major media publications. Headlines ranged from “Inside ‘crypto Woodstock,’ where technologists plot a utopian future” (The Washington Post) to “[FWB FEST proved that the blockchain doesn’t have to be boring](https://theface.com/music/friends-with-benefits-festival-dao-web3-blockchain-crypto-nft-music-califorinia-discord)” (The Face)  to “[A Weekend in the Woods With Crypto’s Cool Kids](https://www.elle.com/life-love/a41002433/friends-with-benefits-fest-crypto/)” (Elle).\n\nYou can view a video recap of the festival [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmifS5T0yt0).\n\n**Festival P&L**\n\nHistorically, few festivals break even during their first year, although most of them are hesitant to make that public. This is especially true for festivals as small and intimate as FWB FEST, which is why our goal for year one was to establish a core event for FWB that we could build upon in the future. \n\nFWB FEST 2022 generated roughly $569,712 in revenue, from sources ranging from ticket sales to partnerships. Expenses for the event were roughly $1,013,415 with a majority going toward talent and production. The event was also conceived, planned, and announced under completely different crypto market conditions, with tickets going on sale in Q4 of 2021, right as the market began to crater. Tickets were also sold in ETH, with ETH’s price dropping significantly since the point of sale. Ultimately, FWB FEST 2022 ended up costing the DAO’s treasury around  $443,702. \n\n\n|FEST P&L|  |\n|--|--|\n| **Revenue**\n| Sponsorships | $ 205,000 |\n| Ticket Sales | $ 363,362\n| Merch Sales | $ 1,350\n| **Total Revenue** | $ 569,712\n| Expenses\n| CA Sales Tax | $ 22,501\n| Talent | $ 329,730\n| Production/Operations | $ 246,459\n| Marketing  | $ 28,337\n| F&B | $ 192,634\n| Admin/Staff | $ 187,753\n| $FWB Payment to Speakers |$ 6,000\n| **Total Expenses** | $ 1,013,415\n| **Net Loss** | $ (443,702)\n\n**Notes:**\nTalent: Musical talent, speaking talent, artist hospitality, artist relations team\nProduction/Operations: Venue fee, backline, signage, restrooms, credentials, medics, vans, waste management, A/V, backline, radios, gas, etc.\nMarketing: Photos, videos, PR\nF&B: Meals, snacks, bars\nAdmin/staff: Insurance, security, general operations personnel\n\nAs a first-year festival, we accomplished a lot. But we also have a lot of room for improvement.  Based on community feedback both public and private, we have developed an overarching strategy for FWB FEST 2023 and identified a number of steps we can take to increase profitability and deliver the most value to members of our community. The following outline is not exhaustive and is meant to be a jumping off point for community discussion. We are using this feedback session to take in suggestions from DAO members so we can continue to refine it. \n\n**Vision: FWB FEST 2023 and Beyond**\n\nFWB FEST 2022 made us realize the importance that a routine mass gathering plays in our community. If FWB’s future is to act as a new kind of social network, we believe FWB FEST has the potential to be our flagship event as a community and our north star — a time and place where we can come together to celebrate the community's latest achievements and communicate our aspirations.\n\nFor FWB FEST to realize this vision and for this to be a viable and sustainable operation, we believe there are a number of values we must hold true. Operating indie, micro-festivals is challenging, but by abiding by the below principles, we believe we have a path forward. \n\n1) Community-driven programming\n2) Financially accessible attendance \n3) Decentralized participation\n4) Break-Even Financials \n\n**Strategy: FWB FEST 23** \n\n**Business Model**\n\nFWB FEST 2023 will make a few primary adjustments from 2022 that will allow it to become more sustainable while fostering the same quality of experience.\n\n**1) Increase community programming & Decrease booked talent**\n\n\nOne of the biggest draws for FWB FEST 2022 was the community itself. Rather than running from stage to stage to catch every performance or talk, a lot of attendees voiced an interest in more down time with other attendees.\n\nSimultaneously, we plan to double down on community driven discussions and talks, which were a huge hit at FWB FEST 2022. These in-the-round sessions hosted in the library by community members created a more informal setting that often led to a higher sense of engagement and discourse.  \n\nWe will find more robust ways to drive community programming using a submission-based format as well as creating more impromptu community moments at the festival. This creates the opportunity to reduce cost from outside higher priced talent and focus those budgets on more decentralized programming, ultimately reducing programming costs by nearly 40%.\n\n**2) Shift food and beverage to à la carte**\n\nOne of the easier ways to cut costs to the DAO is to streamline the food program. While last year was epic, no other festivals take on the burden of feeding attendees. Moving forward, we will adhere to the standard festival model, with simple affordable options, with the exception of Thursday when food will be free to all FWB Day attendees (see below).\n\n**3) Shifts tickets to fiat & stable coin** \n\nTo reduce the impact of market dynamics on the FEST P&L, pricing tickets in fiat and stablecoin will make financial planning easier while incurring less transaction costs in paying vendors and talent.\n\nAdditionally, this allows us to sell tickets to prospective FWB members as well as friends & family of FWB members.\n\nFWB members will be able to purchase tickets for $399 and non-members will be able to purchase for $499.\n\n**4) Add an FWB day only for members, denominated in $FWB**\n\nIn addition to our Friday-Sunday schedule,  we will be adding a bonus day of programming on Thursday that only community members can attend through a separate ticket, about the future of FWB. This FWB early access day will allow for members to have early on-site arrival as well as create a dedicated space to connect with other OG members as well as discuss the future of the FWB DAO. Programming will include discussions led by contributors, major initiatives and projects in the works, a Town Hall, and more. Tickets for this early access day will be only available for FWB members, at an additional $FWB price.\n\n**5) Create a clear way to transact in $FWB token**\n\nIn order to create more on-site utility for the FWB token, we will be creating an FWB flea-market where community members can sell wares to each other, denominated in both $FWB and FIAT. FWB will charge vendor fees in $FWB.\n\n**Key Takeaways & Improvements** \n\nWith this strategy in mind, we will be applying our learnings from FWB FEST 2022 to implement the following improvements in 2023: \n\n**Ticket sales**\n\n1) Tickets will be sold with a 5-month lead time at minimum.\n2) Capacity will be increased to 1000 tickets, compared to 500 in 2022, which will help with profitability due to largely stable production and operation costs.\n3) Tickets will be priced in USD, USDC, and ETH, creating multiple purchasing options for more accessible entry.\n4) We will introduce premium tickets that include housing, including RV housing options for people who want to stay on-site.\n5) We will launch an early arrival day (Thursday), exclusive for FWB members and priced in $FWB, allowing for early check-in, community-focused conversation, and entertainment.\n6) We will explore on-campus housing at the dorms as a potential lower-cost option. \n\n**Budget**\n\n7) Budget to be shared with community before FEST, along with contingency plans that will be put up to vote \n8) We will lower overall musical talent budget and costs by 25 percent, through decreasing volume of acts and implementing more community programming \n9) Like at FWB FEST 2022, food and beverage will be complementary on Thursday, but  for sale on Friday and Saturday\n\n**Marketing**\n\n10) Better communicate that this is a destination festival in advance, so attendees have time to make plans\n\n**Opportunities for community involvement** \n\n11) Build more thorough pipeline for all FWB members to contribute music and educational programming\n12) Create opportunities for FWB members to assist with on-site production or facilitation in exchange for a FEST ticket\n13) Create a “Community Flea Market” that allows community members to sell products to each other \n\n**2023 Festival P&L**\n\nWe project higher revenue in 2023, due to increased capacity, increased partnership interest (due to increased attendance as well as heavy press and social presence from year 1), and adjusted models for food & beverage and merchandise.\n\nTickets will be $399 for members, $499 for non-members. Members who want to attend early access day on August 10th can purchase separate tickets in $FWB.\n\nBelow are three potential P&Ls based on three different ticket sales benchmarks: 1000 tickets, 1500 tickets, and 2000 tickets.\n\n| Projected FEST P&L - 1000 tix |  |\n|--|--|\n| **Revenue** |  |\n| Sponsorships | $ 350,000\n| Ticket Sales (1000) | $ 503,980\n| F&B, Merch Sales | $ 25,000\n|**Total Revenue** |$ 878,980\n|**Expenses**\n| CA Sales Tax | $ 50,000\n|Talent | $ 200,000\n| Production/Operations | $ 385,000\n| Marketing | $ 30,000\n| F&B | $ 20,000\n| Admin/Staff | $ 130,000\n| **Total Expenses** | $815,000\n| **Projected Net Profit** | $ 63,980\n|\n| **Projected FEST P&L - 1500 tix** |  |\n|**Revenue**\n| Sponsorships | $ 350,000\n| Ticket Sales (1500) | $ 713,480\n| F&B, Merch Sales | $ 37,500\n| **Total Revenue** |$ 1,100,980\n| **Expenses**\n| CA Sales Tax | $ 50,000\n| Talent | $ 225,000\n| Production/Operations | $ 385,000\n| Marketing | $ 30,000\n| F&B | $ 20,000\n| Admin/Staff | $ 130,000\n| **Total Expenses** | $840,000\n| Projected Net Profit | $ 285,980\n|\n|**Projected FEST P&L - 2000 tix**\n| **Revenue**\n| Sponsorships | $ 350,000\n| Ticket Sales (2000) | $ 580,000\n| F&B, Merch Sales | $ 50,000\n| **Total Revenue** | $ 1,337,980\n| **Expenses**\n| CA Sales Tax | $ 50,000\n| Talent | $ 225,000\n| Production/Operations | $ 385,000\n| Marketing | $ 30,000\n| F&B | $ 20,000\n| Admin/Staff | $ 130,000\n| **Total Expenses** | $840,000\n| **Projected Net Profit** | $ 522,980\n\n**Timeline & Marketing Schedule**\n\n**Go-To-Market Strategy**\n\nOur goal is to use our community and marketing assets from last year to build real demand around FEST as the “web3 cultural event of the year.” Our multi-pronged marketing approach will include press, owned social channels, Discord, FWBApp, and partner communities. In addition to our own network, we will be leveraging our connections in the wider world of music and web3, so that we have number of like-minded communities helping us spread the word from the moment tickets go on sale. \n\n**Timeline**\n![](https://i.ibb.co/RQnjHPK/Clean-Shot-2023-02-07-at-12-01-38-2x.png)\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nFWB FEST 2022 showed us the power that a routine mass gathering can play inside of the FWB ecosystem. It was revitalizing for the community, created a stronger sense of purpose for members and contributors alike, and contextualized FWB as being beyond “a crypto Discord”.\n\nThe capacity to evolve FWB FEST into a sustainable experience that brings us together once a year, despite a member’s level of engagement digitally, feels important and the opportunity for FWB FEST to drive FWB’s expansion into cultural markets is sizable. \n\nThis being said, we do not propose this lightly: events are a massive draw on resources, in terms of time, money, and personnel. Especially in a bear market, we cannot guarantee that FEST will do well financially, and there is a possibility that it could cut into our treasury. \n\nWe feel confident that despite the potential downside, the upside far outweighs the negative. Still, this is a major decision for the DAO, and one we must collectively agree upon as a group. The writers of this proposal invite members of FWB to voice their opinions and concerns, so we can address each of them  constructively and together. Our goal is to open up the process and level up FEST so that each participant can feel proud of what we have accomplished.",

      "title": "FWB Event Keys V3",
      "content": "Authors: gregbresnitz#9919, izzyb#3703, zoenrogers#6096\n\n### Overview \n\nFWB is leaning hard into events as our calling card. It is one of our defining strengths and with our community led model, one of the best ways for our members to get involved. With the upcoming app, we want to be sure we have a diverse amount of ongoing programming to keep people engaged and FWB on the cutting edge. \n\nFWB's events program facilitates meaningful connection and collaboration online and offline. Overall, the feedback from community members and Event Key hosts has been overwhelmingly positive and we recognize that there is more desire than ever for our DAO to offer global events. \n\nAfter two successful iterations of Event Keys, we propose expanding into an annual program to  ensure there are continuous events for community members. This will afford us the flexibility and adaptability of running rolling applications while engaging new keys as we close out others. \n\nIn addition to our two existing keys, we propose one new key: Digital Events. \n\n### Lessons Learned\n\nBetween V1 and V2 of the Event Key program, we have 40+ events worth of takeaways, learnings, and refinements for v3. Our learnings have been compiled into a document for review [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-A2o_WQE3tVwGwr2cCVXs6bmh1SMvsqnR54IIhCHeCw/edit?usp=sharing).  \n\n### Major Takeaways\n\n- Geography Matters\n\n   - FWB membership is concentrated in four core cities: New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and London. Event and Lite Keys in these cities had consistently high attendance rates. ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/eN71Hp2lO28oRl68nBbEGS34FdBgryoNT4V8pzqrh9LRQ5k5ZyHqDKZ35F7C-j12XDmcSmaHtnIVlau4mVLS39yo4A3abIpg47hAI115PxRaFMD_gdCEXmW2N7xytChhH0LfKG_LNwMzTbspOoI8pISZplIwu_YPygOXSJRHnDAP060eVbQE6VT0IX0Fag)\n\n   - In cities with lower FWB membership, attendance was more unpredictable or inconsistent. \n\n- New Standards\n\n   - The Event Key team stewards event hosts towards success with guidance and recommendations for consistency and quality across events. The team will formalize the following:\n\n      - References for hero images, event titles, and event descriptions. \n\n      - New questions in application flow and FAQs in onboarding documentation on sponsorships, partnerships, conflicts of interest, and host commitment and expectations to execute Event Key. \n\n      - Host Toast SOP on how to properly activate FWB brand awareness at Event Keys. \n\n      - A schedule for reviewing, responding to, and confirming Lite Keys to maintain a rolling rhythm. \n\n- Deeper Cross-Department Collaboration \n\n   - The Marketing and Product Team help drive the success of the Event Keys: \n\n      - The development of flyer templates and a schedule for event amplification during V2 brought higher visibility and awareness to Event Keys.\n\n      - The redesign of the Events page on the website elevates the experience of finding, contextualizing and RSVPing to events. \n\n### Revisions to Program \n\n1.  Core & Edge Approach \n\n- To address the high density of membership in 4 core cities and service smaller cities, we will use a 70 / 30 geographic split each month: 70% of Event Keys will take place in core cities and 30% in less dense cities. \n\n- Smaller cities will be actively encouraged to apply for Lite Keys to engage existing membership and strengthen connections. \n\n2.  Lite Key First\n\n- Event Keys will now only be available to members who have previously and successfully hosted a Lite Key event. This practice ensures that (1) members who are solely motivated by connection and community are rewarded and (2) substantial event budgets are awarded based on proof-of-work.\n\n3.  Digital Event Keys\n\n- Digital Events have been a core part of the FWB experience since its inception. We are building out processes for hosting these digital events using the Event Key infrastructure to improve the quality of the programming and the experience for hosts and participants.\n\n- Budget\n\n   - Similar to the Lite Keys, when applying for a Digital Event Key, applicants will indicate need for a budget. For the most part, you can think of hosting a digital event like hosting a show on a college radio station; you do it for the love of the game, or in this case for the love of FWB. There will be a small budget available for larger events that require staff for production or compensation for guests. \n\n   - The maximum budget available for each digital event will be $500 and 20 $FWB of OurCred/FairShare to reward hosts for building vibes. \n\n      - This budget must be allocated to expenditures directly related to the Digital Event Key event, including host compensation, production cost, guest compensation, etc.  While we pilot this, we will aim to have up to two compensated digital events per month.\n\n4.  Official Co-Brand\n\n- Our community continues to want opportunities to create \"official\" co-branded events. Co-branding carries a lot of significance within and beyond the DAO. FWB members are jazzed about being about to communicate to others in the space that they are part of our community. Currently, we do not have a good system in place to make this easy for digital events. \n\n5.  Access to FWB marketing\n\n- The Digital Events program will have similar marketing materials, amplification, and timelines to the Lite Key. This will be coordinated in advance with the Marketing Team. \n\n6.  Application & Planning\n\n- The Digital Event Key application will be adapted from the existing version of the Event and Lite Key applications.  includes a description of the event, a description of the team behind the event, date/time/place, and any flier associated with the event.\n\n- Digital Event Key applications will occur on a rolling basis. For uncompensated events, submissions must be received a week prior to the event. For compensated events, we'll need a 4 week lead time to green light and plan the event.\n\n7. Post-Event Reporting\n\n- Within 72 hours of the event, the event hosts must submit their post-event report. This includes estimated attendance, self-evaluation, and a link to a recording to be posted to the archive (the recording is totally optional). For compensated events, we will need a detailed record of fund allocation. \n\n### Projected Schedule \n\nKey Dates\n| Date | Action |\n| --- | --- |\n| 11/16/22 | Final Event Key of V2           |\n|  12/5/22 | Snapshot Vote                   |\n|  1/4/23  | Begin to award v3 Event Keys*   |\n|  1/15/23 | Publish WIP                     |\n|  4/18/23 | Open v4 Event Key applications  |\n|  5/4/23  | Begin to award v4 Event Keys*   |\n\n### Budget\n\n```\n|       Type       |        Expense       | Per Month |    Cost    |   Monthly  |    Annual    |\n|:----------------:|:--------------------:|:---------:|:----------:|:----------:|:------------:|\n| Event Production |       Event Key      |     4     |  $3,000.00 | $12,000.00 | $120,000.00* |\n| Event Production | Lite Key (w/ Budget) |     8     |   $250.00  |  $2,000.00 |  $20,000.00  |\n| Event Production | Lite Key (No budget) |     0     |    $0.00   |    $0.00   |     $0.00    |\n| Event Production |      Digital Key     |     2     |   $500.00  |  $1,000.00 |  $10,000.00  |\n|     Host Cred    |      FWB Tokens      |     80    |   $12.00   |   $960.00  |   $9,600.00  |\n|     Personnel    |         Lead         |     1     |  $6,250.00 |  $6,250.00 |  $75,000.00  |\n|     Personnel    |   Special Projects   |     1     |  $3,000.00 |  $3,000.00 |  $36,000.00  |\n|     Personnel    |    Digital Events    |     1     |  $3,000.00 |  $3,000.00 |  $36,000.00  |\n|                  |                      |   Total   | $10,012.00 | $22,210.00 |  $306,600.00 |\n```\n\n(*) 10 months of Event Keys not 12",

      "title": "FWB x LIST3N",
      "content": "Author: \n\n## Abstract\n--------\n\nThis proposal will see the creation of an FWB-built DAO to provide grant funding for musicians entering web3. The funds will be raised by an NFT drop of 444 tokens serving as DAO membership passes. Half of the funds will cover operational expenses and the other half will provide a budget for artist grants + acquiring music NFTs. This budget will provide a minimum roadmap of 9 months but has the potential to be extended by way of revenue from secondary sales and additional fundraising efforts.\n\n## Motivation\n----------\n\nAcross the traditional music industry landscape there are various funding bodies that artists can turn to for financial assistance in creating their art, however none of these institutions offer any ongoing value proposition for either side. LIST3N attempts to re-imagine that framework by creating a community-led system that rewards artists and funders alike, while simultaneously signaling the value of music NFTs to the broader ecosystem. \n\n## Ask from FWB\n------------\n\nI am proposing a 4ETH investment from FWB as well as help with promotion of the project via email and Discord channels. In addition to that, I would ask that FWB be comfortable being positioned as a primary partner in the project alongside Zora, which will help present legitimacy and instill confidence during the current bear market.\\\nFWB's 4ETH investment will be immediately recouped from mint proceeds. [See budget for more details.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/106sljKodV4ti3EkaJ7dGPxx784NzyAqFApK4y3KNQpk/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## Impact on FWB community \n------------------------\n\nThere are a large number of FWB members who are active participants in the music industry. LIST3N is an opportunity to signal FWB's commitment to nurturing talent and our belief in web3 as a tool which can be used to build a more equitable music industry. In exchange for FWB's initial investment in this project (which will be recouped from mint proceeds) FWB will receive a portion of secondary royalties on the project as well as full credit as one of the primary supporting partners alongside Zora. The ongoing success of the LIST3N project will serve to strengthen the FWB brand by placing it at the forefront of web3 x music development. FWB members who are interested in minting this project will also have access to the mintlist via raffle.\n\n## Overview\n--------\n\nThe goal with this proposal is to create an FWB-adjacent DAO focused on supporting emerging artists in the web3 music space. While FWB doesn't explicitly exist to provide funding for talent, this is a low-risk way for our community to build a program which will do just that, benefiting people well beyond the scope of our membership base. As LIST3N grows and evolves, so will FWB's influence on music projects across the web3 ecosystem.\n\n## Details\n-------\n\nThis is an FWB-adjacent project, but I think it's important to our success that the initial membership mint be accessible to all people across other web3 x music communities. With a combination of community outreach, grass-roots marketing, and promotion within traditional music industry channels, I think we can build a buzz-worthy project that will have a high chance of selling out and generating a healthy volume of secondary sales (by bear market standards, at least).\n\nOnce the LIST3N pass has minted and artist submissions are open, the majority of this project will exist on a custom-built website which will allow holders to connect their wallet to vote on artist submissions using a heart-rating system. In addition to that, holders will be able to propose music NFT purchases for the DAO treasury. At the conclusion of each season, votes will be tallied in both categories, and one artist will be awarded 1Ξ. At the same time, the DAO will spend 1Ξ on the agreed upon music NFTs. In addition to that, the DAO will mint a 1/1 music NFT to commemorates LIST3N's early support of the winning artist. This NFT will be held by the treasury. \n\nThis process will repeat on a monthly basis. \n\nProceeds from mint will provide nine months of funding these operations, but as previously mentioned it's entirely possible that this timeline will be extended by way of revenue from secondary sales, as well as fundraising efforts. For music-adjacent companies in the web3 space, providing a season's worth of funding for a reputable FWB-backed community-based arts funding program should be an attractive proposition. Targets for fundraising include but are not limited to Soundxyz, Omgkirby DAO, HedsDAO, Dreams Never Die, Coop Records, Hifi Labs, Water & Music, Seed Club, CPG Pop, Secret Garden and more. \n\n### Timeline: \n\nWeeks 1-2\n\n-   Launch landing page for the project with allowlist sign-up\n\n-   Begin community outreach, marketing, promotion.\n\n-   Artwork creation for Mint Pass\n\nWeek 3-6\n\n-   Comprehensive site build\n\n-   Build out Discord\n\nWeek 7\n\n-   Launch token on testnet, de-bug holder backend, test submission forms\n\nWeek 8\n\n-   Project Minting\n\n-   Artist submissions open\n\nWeek 9-11\n\n-   Artist submissions close\n\n-   DAO members vote on season one winner\n\n-   DAO begins accepting proposals for music NFTs to acquire, community discussion\n\nWeek 12\n\n-   Season one grant winner announced\n\n-   Season one music NFTs purchased by DAO\n\n-   Ongoing\n\n-   On a monthly basis, the process repeats\n\n### Roadmap\n\nHow it works:\n\n-LIST3N begins with an NFT launch. A collection of 444 NFTs with top-tier art. All holders of this NFT will become DAO members.\n\n-50% of mint proceeds will go directly to the DAO Treasury. This will be the seed fund used to support emerging artists and build value for holders. 50% will be held for operational expenses. \n\n-Upon mint completion, artist submissions will open for Season One. In tandem, community proposals will be open for DAO members to discuss the purchase of music NFTs.\n\n-DAO members will vote on artist submissions + music NFT purchase proposals throughout the season (one season = one month)\n\n-At the conclusion of each season the DAO will award one artist with a 1Ξ grant, and simultaneously spend appx 1Ξ on music NFTs as agreed upon by DAO members.\n\n### Outcomes & success measures\n\nThis project will be considered a success if we sell at least 200 of the 444 NFTs. At this sale level we will have covered all upfront expenses and provided a 3 month runway for the project.  Other success targets will be measured as outlined below: \n\n#### Pre-mint: \n\n-High volume of wallet submissions for allowlist mint (using premint.xyz tool)\n\n-Twitter growth\n\n##### Mint: \n\n-Successful mint on the technical side, minimum sales of 200 NFTs at 0.08Ξ each\n\n#### Post-mint + Launch: \n\n-High volume of artist submissions once grant program launches\n\n-High volume of proposals within LIST3N DAO for the purchase of music NFTs\n\n-High incidence of DAO members voting on artist submissions\n\n-Timely execution of artist awards each season\n\n-Post-award success of artists within web3 space (eg. an artist who was given a grant by LIST3N goes on to launch a successful web3 music project)\n\n### Looking forward\n\nThere is a ton of room for this idea to grow and evolve into something more than just a web3 granting system, if the community is wanting to do it. What if one month instead of investing in music NFTs, the DAO decides to allocate that same funding towards releasing a song by one of the winning artists through traditional platforms? Or what if after six months of granting artists, we decide to use DAO funds to host an IRL showcase for the artists we've supported? A SXSW showcase maybe? What if someone in the DAO works at a radio station and can carve us out an hour of programming, we pre-tape a show every week, call it LIST3N-FM and play only music from across the web3 music ecosystem? Those are just a few examples of ways that LIST3N could scale and grow if the desire exists within the community. I'm really excited to begin iterating on what the future might look like for this project. \n\n### Budget\n\nBudget draft: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/106sljKodV4ti3EkaJ7dGPxx784NzyAqFApK4y3KNQpk/edit?usp=sharing>\n\n### Timeline\n\nIf approved, building would start right away.\\\nWe are setting a realistic goal of launching this project in Q1 2023.",

      "title": "Update to FWB Mission, Vision, Strategy, and Principles",
      "content": "Proposal Authors: Contributing Team\n\n## Abstract\n\nIf passed, this proposal will define FWB's vision, mission, core principles, and strategic approaches for the foreseeable future (until another revision is deemed necessary by the community). The aim is to align the DAO around a set of common values and objectives so we can collectively do a better job in allocating resources, setting priorities, holding ourselves accountable, and evolving towards a shared \"North Star.\"\n\n## Background\n\nIn response to the FWB Leadership Vision & Results [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/0xeeb981497b9e8614b596eb7a29cd3d47d7799a048a16642fcc269295ae2f5edd) that was passed on July 13, 2022, the FWB DAO contributing team has put forth an update to our overarching vision and principles that was [first established](https://app.pitch.com/app/presentation/1e1e5a3b-e9be-44ab-9701-11185cf5cc83/860c5c60-ce04-42d3-a700-f4fd76255f46/8145922b-ef5b-4323-8485-3f6e6311955c) on January 23, 2022. We have also added additional points of clarity to our core principles and strategies for accomplishing our mission.\n\nThe process of authoring these updates to our vision, mission, principles, and strategies involved a community-wide [Census](https://fwb.mirror.xyz/1-n3WaN_BBM7n3wVhY2HhI5UnIWhuKVcttuv-X6Njko) that surveyed 454 community members, a contributor retreat, and a series of contributor [workshops](https://www.figma.com/file/1DnkRNmf01QVHzgQLyqBQb/FWB-Vision-%26-Principles?node-id=0%3A1). Our collective learnings from the last year about FWB and the many roles we play were also taken into consideration.\n\nAdditionally, a community discussion about these directional updates took place on September 28th at a DAO-wide Town Hall. Members were invited to review the drafted vision, mission, principles, and strategies, and to weigh in with comments and suggestions over the last 45 days.\n\n## Caveats\n\nThe proposed vision, mission, principles, and strategic approaches are not meant to be overly prescriptive for our emergent network. Rather, they aim to offer a framework as well as a set of tools that should give contributors and the community a clear sense of direction.\n\nAs we evolve, FWB will continue to be a homebase for creatives and builders across disciplines and industries where we can collectively learn, support each other, and form organic friendships. As the technologies and capabilities of web3 advance, we'll continue to use decentralized tools to articulate and enact our community's principles, and to produce meaningful events, collaborations, and connections that align our shared priorities.\n\n## Proposed Vision\n\nWhat is the future world we want to live in? Why does FWB exist?\n\nWe believe in the promise of a better internet---one where communities and authentic connections thrive, where creativity is valued, and where the future can be collaboratively built.\n\n## Proposed Mission\n\nWhat do we want to accomplish every day that helps us actualize that vision?\n\nFWB is the social convening point for the individuals, squads, and institutions using decentralized technology to build a better internet. As a community, we aim to push culture forward while elevating and amplifying each other in the process.\n\n## Proposed Strategic Approaches\n\nHow do we accomplish our mission, and work towards our vision?\n\nThe FWB community accomplishes our mission by acting as a new kind of social network---one that values intimacy over scale, governs and sustains itself, and seamlessly blurs the lines between meaningful digital and physical experiences.\n\nWe currently use Discord as a 24/7 chat room that functions like a virtual city.\n\nWe come together once a year to collaboratively produce an event known as FWB FEST,  where our digital city temporarily comes to physical life. We also organize in-person events around the world, hosted by and for our community, that serve as local neighborhoods.\n\nWe build and operate our own social software---a set of tools that aligns us and uniquely serves the needs of our community. (e.g. fwb.app, gatekeeper, FairShare)\n\nWe produce and publish our own essays, news, and stories to contribute new ideas while amplifying and uplifting one another across this network.\n\nWe collectively maintain, evolve, and improve our community through member-driven proposals that spur economic and social activity, and deepen connections.\n\nAll of this aims to collectively push this format of what a social network is and can be---one that is operated, governed, and attributed to its \"users.\"\n\nIn this regard, FWB can be thought of as a city that does not exist in a singular physical place, but is instead fluid, emergent, and collectively defined by the creativity and interdependence of its people.\n\n## Proposed Core Principles\n\nWhat behaviors or patterns do we as a community embody in order to accomplish our mission and work towards our vision?\n\n### Collective Effort\n\nWe believe in cooperation and collaboration. FigJam over Notes. It takes a village.\n\n### Good Neighbors\n\nWe all have a stake in making our shared home great. Be friendly, be inclusive, be a good host, and if you see trash, pick it up.\n\n### Culture Over Crypto\n\nWe're not a crypto community, we're a community that uses crypto. Let's set a new tone for this new internet.\n\n### Open Experimentation\n\nRemix, remodel. Emergence over instructions. The only \"right way\" to do things is through radical creativity.\n\n### Civic Engagement\n\nWe have a responsibility to show how decentralized technology can benefit the public, and to use our influence as a force for good.\n\n### Give Before You Get\n\nOffer your support without expecting something in return. Credibility is built through authentic, caring connections.\n\n### Have Fun\n\nWe don't take ourselves too seriously, and we don't have all the answers -- but that's what makes this worth doing.\n\n## Reporting\nWithin 2 weeks of each season ending, team leads will be required to share an update with the community on the status of KPIs. This will begin the season after this proposal has been approved.\n\n## Relevant Resources\n\nAdditional resources and documentation relevant to the communication and implementation of FWB's Vision, Mission, Strategy, and Principles\n\n-   [Presentation](https://app.pitch.com/app/presentation/1e1e5a3b-e9be-44ab-9701-11185cf5cc83/e4ff2aea-ebb3-4143-be00-19f90e3d0946/95f645fa-d3d0-4417-90e8-45808a186a47)\n\n-   [Objectives & Key Results ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwo3Z9AS8WYLf-OfusPkhyrz4coeWGgmcScjBvNN3DQ/edit#)\n\n-   [Analogous Reference Points](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CI20nh1jXV4tJBKxRFE6vSqmZJhKWtQwdlPNyh5e-fw/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "title": "Moving FWB to a Single Membership Tier",
      "content": "Author: Proposal initiated by Drew Coffman; Refined by Willa Koerner, HYP TV, Brendan Donovan, Kaitlyn Davies\n\n### Abstract\n\nIf passed, this proposal would streamline FWB membership into one group at the 75 $FWB level---meaning all DAO members would have access to the full spectrum of FWB benefits. At the same time, it would enable anyone holding any amount of $FWB to access a selection of the DAO's offerings, detailed below. While this proposal would eliminate the \"Local\" 5 $FWB membership tier, the intention is to transition into a future where we do a better job supporting all members, while simultaneously opening up points of access to those who want to participate without officially joining.\n\n### Background\n\nThe Local membership tier was [initially proposed](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/QmbTDzk6DdH8wB32o2RkTGXNKpZtQhgeBGpXwBwLdWwq9Q) as a way to make FWB's in-person events more accessible. In addition to granting entry to IRL events, the Local tier also included access to a small set of city-based Discord channels. Over time, Local members' Discord access was expanded---which inadvertently has blurred the lines between what it means to be a \"Full\" (or \"Global\") member versus a Local member. At this point, it's worth evaluating the challenges posed by the two-tiered membership approach, and exploring whether there are better ways to steward the DAO's core community into the future.\n\n### Challenges this Proposal Aims to Solve:\n\n#### Local members are having a subpar experience.\n\nWhile it was originally intended as an access point for FWB events and location-based networking, over time the Local membership tier has become perceived as a way for people to \"sample\" the FWB membership experience. However, it was never designed to serve this purpose---meaning many Local members who expect a lightweight version of FWB membership are having a subpar experience.\n\n#### Having two types of members makes FWB more confusing, and less cohesive.\n\nBy having two tiers, we have inadvertently created confusion instead of cohesion---resulting in a poorer ultimate experience for both member groups. For example, because Local members don't know what Discord channels they're missing out on, there is consistent misuse of the channels they do have access to (such as posting classifieds info in #General, etc). Additionally, Local members who aren't in major cities (Los Angeles, New York, or London) don't really have access to anything beyond a small selection of Discord channels, which can make them question why they joined. Lastly, having two different membership tiers has resulted in two different sets of application standards, which doesn't seem fair.\n\n#### The new FWB mobile app can't easily support a two-tiered membership model.\n\nWe are working towards the launch of fwb.app, a mobile app that revolves around a unique identity NFT that will be airdropped to each member granting entry into the FWB ecosystem (you can demo the fwb.app [here](https://youtu.be/E9sgKLykv_M)). We hope this new app will serve as a home base for our membership, and that it will provide more utility and organization than the Discord is able to. However, developing the app to suit our current two-tiered membership model would significantly complicate the user experience, and be much more costly to build out---making now an opportune time to transition away from the Local membership tier, in favor of another accessible point of entry into the FWB community.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nEffective January 15, 2023, this proposal would:\n\n#### Merge the Local and Global tiers into one official FWB membership tier. \n\nAs of the merge, to be an official FWB member you must hold at least 75 $FWB. Prospective new members must go through the existing application process.\n\n#### Make select FWB content, products, and events open to anyone holding $FWB.\n\nTo offer broader access to our community---and as a way to \"sample\" the FWB experience ---FWB will begin to make select offerings available to anyone holding various amounts of $FWB. This would include free access to TL;DR, our digital events archive, and read-only access to the FWB Intranet app. IRL and local events would also be accessible to $FWB token holders.\n\n#### Honor existing Local members for 90 days---and most-active Local members forever.\n\nLocal members who were already a part of FWB at the time of this proposal passing will be given access to full membership benefits for a 90 day period. This includes access to all Discord channels and events, as well as entry into the FWB app once it’s launched. Additionally, the 25 most active existing Local members will be given enough $FWB tokens to upgrade their membership to the 75 $FWB level on behalf of the community. (Activity will be determined based on Discord usage and event participation.)\n\n#### $FWB-Holder Access vs. Membership Access\n\n|                        | $FWB Token Access |           Full Membership: 75 $FWB          | \n|------------------------|:-----------------:|:-------------------------------------------:|\n| Application required   |         No        |                     Yes                     | \n| IRL events             |        Yes        |                 Yes, Plus 1                 | \n| Digital events         |         No        |                     Yes                     | \n| Discord                |         No        |                     Yes                     | \n| TL;DR                  |        Yes        |                     Yes                     | \n| Digital events archive |        Yes        |                     Yes                     | \n| FWB App                |     Read Only     | Full Access: Profiles, Identity, Authorship |  \n\n\n### Potential Proposal Benefits\n\n-   Consolidating membership into a single, streamlined experience would make it easier to design, implement, and communicate member benefits.\n\n-   Enabling anyone holding any amount of $FWB to access a selection of FWB content and products without applying will make \"sampling\" FWB frictionless---without taking away from the full membership experience. \n\n-   Having one single membership level will allow for smoother migration and onboarding into the fwb.app, where access to the FWB ecosystem will be granted by an identity NFT.\n\n-   The Discord will be less confusing, as everyone will have access to the same channels.\n\n### Potential Proposal Drawbacks\n\n-   Becoming an FWB member would be much less affordable, which will make official entry into our member community less accessible---which could result in less overall diversity\n\n-   If Local members don't upgrade their membership, there may be fewer members overall, and less activity in the Discord.\n\n-   Community members Brendan Donovan, Ally Norton, and HYP wrote a document compiling a longer list of counterpoints to this proposal. [Read it here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QmlWi7FtAD1DZfoRFNyEKNHL0Eh1WzC8UmW5scTXFCs/edit).\n\n### Additional Voting Information\n\nThis vote will be executed via Snapshot. Because this vote more heavily impacts Local members (who likely hold only 5 $FWB), we will be using a quadratic voting strategy requiring a quorum of 40K tokens. [Quadratic voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting) limits whales' power to sway a vote while lifting up the voices of those with smaller holdings.\n\n#### Proposal FAQs\n\n#### Q: If Local membership is eliminated, how can we make FWB membership more accessible?\n\nA: The current proposal seeks to upgrade the 25 most active Local members based on Discord usage and event attendance. However, the intention is to have a larger discussion around accessibility initiatives once there is consensus around moving to a single tier. Community member Alarke Alarke has also proposed a scholarship fund, and discussion has been started around utilizing our Fellowship program to onboard more members.\n\n#### Q: What will people who hold 5 $FWB still be able to access? And what will they lose access to?\n\nA: Existing Local members who continue to hold 5 $FWB after this proposal is enacted would no longer have access to the Discord, digital events, or to the full offerings of the in-development FWB app—but would still be able to use their $FWB to attend local events, and will still have access to a limited selection of FWB content and products. Local members who were already a part of FWB at the time of this proposal passing will be given access to full membership benefits for a 90 day period. This includes access to all Discord channels and events, as well as entry into the FWB app once it’s launched. Local members who join after this proposal passes will not receive access to this 90 day period.\n\n#### Q: How many Local members will this impact?\n\nA: While there are currently ~1,200 Local members, many of them do not participate on a regular basis. While it's difficult to gauge how many of these members are active at IRL events, Discord data shows that of the 1,300 messages posted on average every day, only ~30 are posted by Local members---meaning that just 2% of posts come from Local members.\n\n#### Q: What channels can't locals see?\n\nA: Local members can see approximately 50% of FWB's channels. Full members have access to a variety of channels including classifieds, creative channels for filmmakers and musicians, learning channels about DAOs, crypto, and social tokens, lifestyle channels including health-and-wellness, music, plants-and-animals, and selfies-and-fits, an NFT category including the most active channel in the entire discord, trading crypto channels, and more.\n\n#### Q: Why keep the main tier at 75 $FWB? Can we take this opportunity to reimagine what FWB membership looks like?\n\nThis proposal is not intended to completely overhaul FWB membership; instead, it's intended as a way to solve a few current challenges, and put us on a more sustainable path. This proposal to move to a singular tier will make it easier for us to further reimagine what FWB membership can be, holistically. Think of this as a first step.\n\n#### Q: How will we generate more interest and value for the 75 $FWB membership?\n\nA: Through the roll-out of the fwb.app, we hope to offer FWB's first meaningful \"Post-Discord\" product that brings deeper connection and conversation to the FWB ecosystem. Additionally, we hope that having a dedicated, FWB-owned distribution channel will improve member communications, governance notifications, and more. Additionally, through the levelsetting of FWB membership into one tier, we will be able to experiment with more egalitarian voting structures, such as one member one vote, that should boost economic activity and innovation within the FWB ecosystem.",

      "title": "FWB x thEM Partnership",
      "content": "## ABSTRACT\n\nThis proposal seeks to form a partnership between Early Majority (thEM), an outdoor community that makes gear for its members and empowers them to enjoy it, and FWB.\n\nThe partnership includes:\n\n-   FWB will support the design and creation of an FWB badge that can be worn with Early Majority gear \n\n-   FWB members will receive early, discounted [allowlist access](https://www.premint.xyz/early-majority-x-fwb-allowlist/) to Early Majority's membership mint\n\n-   thEM and FWB will continue to partner on event experiences via city keys to further integrate our communities\n\n-   thEM will contribute a small % of tokens to the FWB Treasury.\n\n## BACKGROUND\n\nIn the history of any community, sometimes the moments that inexorably shape its trajectory are obvious (Fest), but other times they're subtle and only obvious in hindsight. When it comes to the community I founded with my friends, Early Majority, my low-key interactions with FWB have turned out to be momentous.\n\nIn early '21, I was pilled by Paul Tao, who inspired us to write one of our first newsletters, [NFTease](https://earlymajority.substack.com/p/issue-no3?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy). Then I met Alex and Trevor in Paris, who opened my eyes to the possibility of using the tools of Web3 to transform culture. After Alex pushed me to apply to Seed Club, I locked myself in the dining room on Christmas Eve, recorded a hot take of a pitch video, and emerged just in time to play Santa.\n\nNow I come bearing gifts for FWB and a proposal.\n\nFor those I haven't met, I'm Joy. I build the brands that most brands want to be--- with the help of wonderful people around me. I reignited Patagonia after decades of dormancy, sparking a media frenzy around the brand by launching Worn Wear and the New Localism (campaign to defend public lands). Before Patagonia, I led marketing for Converse All-Star, where I launched the Chuck '70 and iconic collaborations with Warhol and Margiela. Since leaving Patagonia, I've worked in the venture-backed world of technology, preparing Sonos for IPO and taking Lyft public. At Sonos, I launched experiential retail & partnered with the likes of RTJ and Kraftwerk, Anthony Bourdain and Danny Bowien, to IKEA, Hay and Sade. I was named one of the world's most influential CMOs by Forbes in 2020 before starting Early Majority.\n\nWe're a pre-token outdoor community that makes gear for its members and empowers them to enjoy it.  We're using the tools of Web3 to transform the environmentally destructive apparel industry and share ownership with our community, and we want to start with those who have helped us along the way, like you.\n\n## MOTIVATION\n\nthEM sees this partnership as a way for FWB to support projects developed by community members while contributing technical and cultural capability to their efforts.  The outdoor industry and Web2 apparel brands have been sorely devoid of diversity and inclusion, and Web3 offers us an opportunity to change that forever--- making space for ourselves and each other.\n\n## DETAILS\n\n### Mint perks\n\nEarly Majority will grant 100 FWB members early [allowlist](https://www.premint.xyz/early-majority-x-fwb-allowlist/) access to mint our member token for .333ETH on 8 September. The public mints at .358ETH on 9 September, and existing members minting free badges will only be allowed to do so after the public mint has closed. In exchange, FWB will support the mint, publicize its badge and support co-branded events on its social and publishing platforms.\n\nEveryone minting will receive a piece of Early Majority apparel, which is guaranteed for life and stands toe to toe with ANY outdoor apparel on the market. For more details and to understand the real-world utility of the tokens deliver, check out our [announcement](https://www.earlymajority.com/articles/mint-details-reveal). Member access to our [e-commerce site](https://www.earlymajority.com/collection/apparel) may be unlocked with our token from the moment you mint it. All technical outerwear ships in September.\n\n### The Badge\n\nFWB will provide artwork for an NFT-enabled FWB badge, based on the recent FWB Fest creative designs.  Early Majority will manufacture the badge, which will be shipped for free along with the apparel claimed by minters.\n\n### Events\n\nEarly Majority has already partnered with FWB for the SWIM PARIS and HIKE PARIS events during EthCC.  We hope to extend our partnership through more thEM x FWB events bringing our communities together in the great outdoors. We've also been awarded an event key for Boston, to plant the seeds for a series of events called Natural Capitals, where we explore and celebrate the world's greenest cities.\n\nLong term alignment \n\nIn exchange for the FWB community's support and aligning us for the long term, Early Majority will contribute .5% of our tokens to the FWB treasury, subject to a one-year lock-up.\n\n## IMPACT\n\nCreate a proof-point of FWB's ability to nurture projects from within its community--- especially allowing historically under-represented founders resources and access.  Early Majority has built a subscriber base of several thousand adventurers globally who are leaning out, supporting gender equality, and sustaining nature.  We're friends supporting friends, creating new business models, and pioneering new ways of connecting experiences and goods for the common good.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS\n\n#### Objective 1: Expand the awareness of and affection for FWB among outdoor communities in Early Majority's network \nKey Result 1: Feature FWB artwork on Early Majority platforms and increase applications from these groups.\n\n\n#### Objective 2: Increase participation in Early Majority's membership mint \nKey Result 2: 100% sell-through of all 100 allowlist spots allocated to FWB\n\n\n#### Objective 3: Have fun & feel good\nKey Result 3: 80+ NPS score on the mint experience among participants",

      "title": "FWB Wiki",
      "content": "Team: @kd, @naomi (among many others)\n\n## Abstract\n--------\n\nThe FWB Wiki started as a community led knowledge base for all things FWB, providing a static place for important member information. With this proposal we want to refresh the Wiki to make it up to date, assign internal team members to keep it that way, and establish a seasonal contributor team to help maintain the FWB and field questions from the greater community to determine what else would be beneficial to add. \n\nThe goals are:\n\n1.  Update the existing Wiki (see: <https://fwb-wiki.vercel.app/>) to become a hub for FWB documentation and FAQs \n\n2.  Establish a method for seasonal contribution and internal team maintenance, with the internal team owners updating their relevant sections with the most up to date information\n\n3.  Set a schedule to keep Wiki relevant as the DAO evolves \n\n4.  Relaunch the Wiki with this proposal and have establish funding to support it staying updated for 4 seasons\n\n## Motivation\n----------\n\nCommunity value is built through community knowledge. But with Discord as the main information hub, key information is hard to find.![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Vst3juoVsQulXDC3lEHlX3340-krK0M7iVXDHdAt0w4gR2H2w-ti9qfFfKy4LzAWhct0Q7wlXqH2QlA16UQZCFnVZoVSR8ptrnH27Id5rwolOEI-AuzFvq5IO9LWbHCi5aP-QPRFJ9eUJiOAFuPdJds)\n\nThat is why a team of FWB community members began to work on the FWB Wiki last year. After this initial launch, we realized a need to formalize it through this proposal to keep it updated as a relevant source of information for members. \n\nThis proposal aims to set up a sustainable method for the Wiki to remain updated and to provide an access point for members to help add to and amend the wiki. \n\n## Impact on FWB community\n-----------------------\n\nOur aspiration with this proposal is that the wiki serves as a useful tool for both new and existing members, that it's a 'source of truth' where anyone can find up to date information allowing the ease of understanding and  navigating the DAO.\n\nIn establishing a method for maintenance, we would also be creating a low bar of participation for FWB members to get involved and contribute to the maintenance and growth of the wiki. Knowing how things work at FWB increases new member participation and contribution to ongoing initiatives.\n\n## Overview\n--------\n\nIn mid-2021, a team of 7 FWB members got together to build the current wiki page. It was built on Notion with onboarding members as the target audience. The team set about collecting information, writing content, and formatting it into a knowledge base.\n\nSeveral opportunities arose during that process:\n\n1.  Maintenance --- Some of the content would need to be regularly maintained in order to be accurate and, other than manually, we didn't have a system in place for that (for example, the Seasons page)\n\n2.  Expansion --- There was plenty of content to capture and room to continue to grow this wiki to be a valuable asset to the DAO. As a starting point, we stuck to content that would be most helpful to new members onboarding.\n\n3.  Fact checking --- In order to maintain accuracy, we needed fact checkers. The initial group of members were able to check each other's work ad hoc, but having a formalized process to ensure accuracy and solid proofreading was lacking.\n\nWe migrated the wiki to Gitbook - where it currently lives.  \n\n## Details\n-------\n\n### Discussion\n\nImportance: organization, growth, enabling a good experience for the community\n\nFWB has heaps of valuable information, but our main information hub is Discord, which is not the greatest place to find the right information in a useful format. A dedicated knowledge base such as the FWB wiki will enable growth, result in more organization within the DAO, and a better experience for the community. \n\nFor the wiki to remain useful, information needs to be maintained and updated over time. By establishing a way for contributors to add to the wiki, members can have an avenue to ask questions and for the main wiki team to be able to monitor and synthesize these ad hoc questions to determine what would be best to add to the greater wiki. The contributors for this proposal were selected based on their involvement in the inception of the initial wiki and their contributions to push it forward to the stage of this proposal. \n\nWe want to create a public works channel for the wiki to be a general place for everyone to ask questions, and for the core wiki team to know what needs to be updated or added to the wiki to maximize its benefit for community members. Every season there will be a group of contributors who will be tasked with monitoring this channel, deciding what will be added to the FAQ section in the wiki, and what to flag to FWB staff to update on their ends of the Wiki. \n\nRoadmap\n\n1.  Migrate the current Wiki to FWB Github \n\n2.  Establish a seasonal budget for contributors \n\n3.  Establish a method for ownership of maintaining content between contributors and FWB team\n\n4.  Internal team & contributor team do a full refresh of their owned Wiki sections (See breakdown below for ownership division) \n\n5.  Token-gate the Wiki for all members (currently 5+ FWB)\n\n6.  Set up a public works channel  \n\n7.  Relaunch the FWB Wiki \n\n### Wiki Refresh Structure & Ownership\n\nGetting Started **Membership/Brand\n\nCode of Conduct *Justice\n\nDiscord Channels Navigating*Membership/Brand\n\n-   Overview *REMOVE\n\n-   Discord Bots *REMOVE\n\n-   Voice Chat Channels *REMOVE\n\nProducts and Programs *Product/Governance/Events/Membership\n\n-   Overview *REMOVE\n\n-   Co-Pilots *REMOVE\n\n-   *ADD Membership (within page detail Host Committee, Co-Pilots, Category Leads) \n\n-   Fellowships *REMOVE\n\n-   Hackathons *Change to Garage + detail programme\n\n-   *ADD Event Keys \n\n-   *ADD Gatekeeper\n\n-   *ADD Member Directory \n\n-   *ADD Digital Events\n\nGeneral FAQs *Community maintained\n\n-   About FWB\n\n-   Becoming a member\n\n-   Application process\n\n-   Getting started\n\n-   Onboarding\n\n-   Governance\n\nEvents Calendar *REMOVE\n\nVoice Chat Archives *REMOVE\n\nGlossary *MOVE TO FAQ\n\nGovernance *Governance \n\nProposals *MOVE to subheading under governance\n\nSeasons *Brand\n\n-   Current season\n\n-   Season history\n\nFWB Cities *REMOVE\n\nOrg Chart *REMOVE\n\nTeams FAQ *REMOVE\\\nAbove is proposed structure and ownership, might shift slightly as Wiki gets reworked and we find new ways to organize/add to this base.\n\n### Looking forward\n\nOur aspiration is to create a robust, constantly evolving and growing Knowledge Base for Friends With Benefits that is a foundation for all the DAO's information.  Our aim is to activate contributors to keep information relevant and up-to-date and add new pages over time.\n\n## Outcomes & Success Metrics\n--------------------------\n\nWe will enable page view count tracking and bounce rate metrics for the wiki and each of its sections. At the end of each season of this proposal, we will draft a breakdown of where members (and non members once token gating is determined) visited the wiki and what sections seemed to garner the most traffic overall. We will use these learnings between the first and second season of this wiki proposal to refine what we should add or amend from our first wiki iteration.\n\n### Budget for 2 Seasons \n\nRetroactive payments for Migration Work\n\n-   5 FWB for Baumaus for Nextra Install and migration of Wiki content to Gitbook\n\nManagement & Maintenance Contributor Budget\n\n-   15 FWB per season, per contributor (max 3 contributors per season) \n\n-   Total: 90 FWB\n\n### Timeline\n\nWeeks 1-4\n\n-   Migrating the existing Wiki for FWB owned github\n\n-   Assigning sections to be updated by internal team \n\n-   Complete first draft of updated sections\n\n\nWeek 4-5\n\n-   Review and edit wiki sections\n\n-   Contributors finalize initial FAQ contents \n\n\nWeek 6-7\n\n-   Create public works channel for wiki \n\n-   Implement Wiki token gating for new version \n\n-   Relaunch the wiki in discord and through a general marketing campaign \n\n-   Ongoing\n\n-   Seasonal updates by FWB Team \n\n-   Monitoring of public works channel by contributor team, and regular updates of FAQ section",

      "title": "FWB Leadership Vision + Results",
      "content": "Team: brian mark#7846\n\n## Summary\n-------\n\nSupporting this proposal will require FWB DAO Leadership (Mayor, Brand Lead, Operations, and Staff) to provide a long-term vision for the organization and a list of one-year KPIs within 60 days, and to provide quarterly KPI updates to the community in a public forum.\n\n## Audience & scope\n----------------\n\nThis proposal impacts all FWB community members and token holders.\n\n## Overview\n--------\n\nFWB's runway is limited, and our path to long-term viability is unclear to members. While operating in a centralized way (relying on a core, salaried team for day to day operations and strategic direction) has advantages, this also means that the core team needs to ensure that holders of the token have a faith in the vision leadership sets forth and clarity on the steps being taken to achieve long-term goals.\n\nThis proposal will ensure that members have a clear understanding of leadership's vision for the organization and the steps being taken to bring about this future state. This increased accountability will create a more engaged membership, increased confidence in leadership, and a better-performing DAO.\n\nThe proposal includes two phases:\n\n-   Within sixty days: DAO leadership (Mayor, Ops, Brand, Staff) will deliver a long-term vision for the organization to the community, and OKRs by team for the next 12 months defining the steps to be taken to bring about that vision.\n\n-   Quarterly: DAO leadership to provide an update on tracking to OKRs and a revised 12 month plan for execution to the community for review.\n\nSnapshot vote will be quadratic.\n\n## Details\n-------\n\nExpectations of framework for deliverables:\n\nVision: Provide a long-term view that explains clearly how current leadership team wants to build value for community members. What will the results be of our long-term efforts as an organization? While this can be presented via slides, the core deliverable is a maximum of one page written that defines the vision of leadership for FWB future. This may be sourced from the community, or created by a core team and reviewed with the community.\n\nTwelve-month OKRs: Define the [objectives and key results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) for each role in leadership in bringing about the vision. These updates should be provided at minimum on a per-department basis, but ideally each team member receiving recurring compensation should work towards OKRs, either their own or their manager's. Objectives should be clearly defined, significant and concrete, and results should be measurable. Essentially, help the community understand what leadership and their respective teams are executing in order to bring about the vision, and track the performance towards those objectives. This can be maintained in a community-accessible Notion or in another format.\n\nQuarterly updates: Provide an update to the community at the beginning/end of each season regarding progress made against OKRs, any adjustments made to the twelve-month plan, and an update on progress towards the longer-term vision. This can include a peer performance review process to improve overall team performance.\n\n## Discussion\n\nFWB's leadership currently operates with limited community oversight and transparency. Key salaried decision makers are empowered to own their functions and execute against their job descriptions, but there's no oversight regarding their performance in their roles, no community input on matters of hiring/firing/performance, and no requirement of reporting out on in-role performance to leadership or to the community. Ultimately, $FWB is a governance token, and the people leading FWB are accountable to the holders of FWB. The leadership team is paid from our collectively-managed treasury, and the work being done benefits our organization. However, the current lack of transparency leaves the average community member with limited understanding of daily operation of the organization, let alone long-term vision for the organization.\n\nLeadership roles in an organization like FWB need to operate with a high degree of autonomy to be successful. The objective of this proposal is not death by process or consensus-based decision making. Instead, it seeks to provide FWB's non-elected leadership the opportunity to share their vision of the organization's future and a framework for keeping the community informed of progress towards that vision, and to provide the community increased visibility to the excellent work being delivered by leadership and the opportunity to understand the long-term vision and action plans of core contributor teams. Increased transparency will result in increased community buy-in, increased mutual accountability, and is critical to the continued success of FWB. \n\n## Roadmap\n\n-   60 days from proposal passing: Leadership to deliver vision + 12mo OKRs.\n\n-   Beginning/end of each season: Leadership to present OKR updates + 12mo plans.\n\n-   After 12mo, review process and iterate.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nManagement of this process will be the responsibility of leadership. We should create space for community discussion, questions, and feedback at and after each seasonal update. We should also plan to standardize the templates used for this process. \n\nBudget Overview:  No cost to the community.\n\n## Timeline\n\n60 days from proposal passing. Seasonally afterwards.",

Projects are meant to benefit the FWB community by aligning with one of three categories: Friends, Benefits, or Wildcard. The community has submitted 50+ proposals, now it's time for all of us to vote on our favorites!\n\nAs a reminder of how this process will work:\n   - $20K max is allotted per category (this is to ensure that a diverse range of projects receive grants)\n   - $50K in total will be distributed this season.\n   - Find the table  with details for every proposal [here](https://airtable.com/shrnldv7AfmZn2Np4) - when you  go to a row you can click the two diagonal blue arrows to expand the row details\n   - The entire community can vote on their favorite proposals via Snapshot (that's this!)\n   - Voting is set up such that you can place a vote for any number of projects that you are excited by. The projects with the most votes will be selected for funding (with max of $20k per category). This is not ranked choice. As such, it would be best to select projects such that you don't go over $20k per category, but it's up to you.\n\nRemember, there’s no “right” answer here, projects should align with the FWB vibe, mission, and/or community. That leaves things pretty open!",

With a dedicated core team, we threw art crawls, dinner parties, dj nights, lectures, thrift shopping & more in London, New York & Los Angeles. After ironing out the kinks, we systemized the entire department with a library of SOPs that could teach any member the how's & why's of what we did. The foundation for a global decentralized events program was in place.\n\nOriginally, Cities intended to expand events into more markets, but we realized that our global reach had a density drop off that did not necessitate additional leads stewarding regularly occurring events across the world. While our core Cities marched on, we revisited our original intention to expand but through Event Keys V1. The program was a way to test new markets for an audience and leadership and growth opportunities while building intentionally. Event Keys V1 was a success with 10 new cities programming & producing member-driven global events.\n\nNow matured, the Cities program has the opportunity to evolve by diversifying event programming and the FWB IRL experience for more members on a global scale through the redistribution of existing Cities budget. \n\n### Timeline\n\n| Date  | Objective  |\n| --- | --- |\n| July 7 - 14, 2022 | Applications Open |\n| July 18, 2022 | Community Votes |\n| July 20, 2022 | Announce Keys |\n| July 26, 2022 | Onboarding |\n| August 15, 2022 | Announce Lite & Event Keys |\n| Sept/Oct/Nov 2022 | Event Activations & Reports |\n| December 2022 | Program Analysis |\n| January 2023 | Launch V3 |\n\n### Motivation\n----------\n\nFollowing the launch of the core Cities program followed by Event Keys V1, there's been an increasing appetite for community-driven events: local and global members are asking \"wen city.\" Our goal is to replicate the success and distribute the momentum of the incredible programming in NY, London, and LA in other cities. We believe decentralized event programming invites emergent leadership, friendship, and culture-building. We also want to uphold FWB's core values and the standards set out in the Cities SOPs expertly laid out by City Leads with an Event Key process that provides enough guide rails for new event programmers to succeed.\n\n#### Keys Expansion\nAfter our MVP, we identified the need for a \"lighter\" key in addition to our prototype key to solve for feedback (see below) from the community and V1 participants.\n\n#### Lite Key  -- Small Scale\nOur members are proud to be part of FWB.  There have been ongoing requests to make the smaller meetups that already organically happen \"official\". The Lite key gives members a path to get the official FWB co-sign for ongoing intimate events with a small budget to boost.\n\n#### Official Co-Brand\nIt might not seem significant at first, but the community wants opportunities to create \"official\" co-branded events. Co-branding carries a lot of significance within and beyond the DAO. FWB members are jazzed about being about to communicate to others in the space that they are part of our community. Currently, we do not have a good system in place to make this easy for the community at large.\n\n#### Access to FWB marketing\nWe are building an SOP in tandem with Marketing to outline a cohesive amplification experience for Lite and Event Keys which includes templates for flyers, procedures for having an event shared on socials, etc.\n\n#### Earn OurCred / FairShare\nIn addition to amplification, we are working to include OurCred / FairShare so members doing these events will earn FWB. If you do a hike every month for the community, you should receive FWB for building vibes.\n\n#### Budget Thoughts\nThe initial idea for Lite Keys was that it didn't require a budget so we could do Lite Keys at scale (hikes, book clubs, art crawls) with rolling applications that would not pull on the treasury. Ultimately, we decided on a middle ground solution that offers applicants the option to request up to $250 in budgetary support if necessary.\n\nOn the application, there is an option to indicate the need for budgetary support. This budget must be allocated to expenditures directly related to the Lite Key event, including drinks, movie tickets, parking, etc.\n\n### Event Key --  Medium Scale\nThink [Event Key V1](https://app.pitch.com/app/presentation/1e1e5a3b-e9be-44ab-9701-11185cf5cc83/efedd86c-d1ad-46f3-adaa-168297f93c08/0f2c1da1-42d4-4e89-8a9d-b32164b1e786) with an expanded budget!\n\n|  | Lite Key | Event Key |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | ≤  $250/event | $3,500/event |\n| Member Compensation | Our Cred TBD | Our Cred TBD |\n| Lead Time | ≥ 4 weeks | Chosen July 2022 |\n| Cadence | Rolling & repeatable after 1 successful event & recap | 5 per month in Sept/Oct/Nov |\n| # per city | Unlimited | 1  per city in Sep/Oct/Nov |\n| Audience | FWB members + new member recruits | FWB members + new member recruits |\n| Sponsorship | In-kind contributions only | In-kind contributions only |\n| FWB Branding | Yes -- Co-branding | Yes - Co-Branding |\n| Example | Hikes, coffee hang, gallery visit | Event Key V1 & Cities SOPs |\n| Application | [Link](https://airtable.com/shrZ0htAja4G222zz) | [Link](https://airtable.com/shrZ0htAja4G222zz) |\n\n### Budget \n-   The original Cities budget was $133,125 per season (3 months). \n\n-   The Lite Key has a total budget of $2,000 per month. Applicants can apply for up to $250 of funding per key or indicate that they do not need budgetary support from FWB on the application. \n\n-   Each Event Key has a budget of $3,500 provided by FWB with a total of 5 Event Keys per month from September through November for a total expense of $52,500. \n\n-   The City Team personnel budget is $9,250 per month to steward the program and support successful applicants with the execution of their events. \n\n   -   In August, the City Team will onboard new keys with Cities SOPs and Pattern Language guides. \n\n   -   From September through November, the City Team will support keys with realizing their events through marketing, Discord channel coordination, Gatekeeper, etc. \n\n   -   In December, the City Team will wrap up v2 of the events program after reviewing final reporting from all key applicants. \n\n   -   The City Team will iterate on the structure of the program based on feedback to present v3 to the community in January. \n\n-   FairShare Compensation \n\n   -   Event Keys will allow community members to earn points\n\n   -   Being awarded a key\n\n   -   Attendees check in through GateKeeper\n\n   -   Recap Report\n\n   -   More details to come with FairShare V1\n\n| Spend | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Jan. | Total |\n| --- |  --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Team | $9,250 | $9,250 | $9,250 | $9,250 | $9,250 | $9,250 | $55,500 |\n| Event Key | $0 | $17,500 | $17,500 | $17,500 | $0 | $0 | $52,500 |\n| Lite Key | $0 | $2,000 | $2,000 | $2,000 | $0 | $0 | $6,000 |\n| Total | $9,250 | $28,750 | $28,750 | $28,750 | $9,250 | $9,250 | $114,000 |\n\n### FWB Event Key Process\n\n#### Application\nThe Event Keys application can be found [here](https://airtable.com/shrZ0htAja4G222zz). Beyond providing basic contact information, it requires applicants to:\n\n-   Identify which event key they are applying for \n\n-   Account for a budget or sponsorship (if necessary) \n\n-   Describe their event, goals, and production experience \n\n-   Agree to follow FWB's Manifesto, Code of Conduct, Event Pattern Language \n\n-   Agree to use Gatekeeper & the Event Key report \n\n-   Additional Criteria\n\n     -   1 season minimum as an FWB member   \n\n     -   Years in Event Key city or specific relationship to city \n\n     -   Active level within FWB Discord  \n\n     -   Previous experience in event or cultural programming\n\n-   Local & Global member can apply \n\n#### Approval \n1.  Cities Team: completes initial once-over to confirm application has been completed correctly and base criteria have been met \n\n2.  City Leads & former Event Key programmers: vote on future events and applications in #city-keys public works channel \n\n3.  Cities Team: connects with all applicants to confirm status of application post-vote & begins onboarding for accepted events\n\n#### FWB Event Key Reporting\nEvent Key reporting is the mechanism that enables (1) the program to iterate responsively and meaningfully to community needs, (2) the programmers to deliver on application/goals, and (3) FWB to share assets that tell the story of an event.\n\nAll reports must be completed within 72 hours of an event to ensure most relevant info in real time + assets for marketing or editorial recaps.\n\nEvent Key reporting requires event programs to provide: (1) an in-depth recap of their event, (2) an evaluation of what went well and what could be improved, (3) estimated attendance, (4) any assets generated (i.e. POAP, flyer, photos, video), and (5) receipts to confirm budget allocation (if necessary.) \n\n### Impact on FWB community \n------------------------\n\nApproving Event Keys V2 would provide the following benefits and opportunities for the community:\n\n1.  Key Holder Network: One of the benefits from the core Cities team was a 10 person working group that relied on each other as resources, passing leads and the fren connection vibes. We witnessed a similar form of collaboration from Event Key V1 organizers. We can deepen the squad vibes introducing new benefits each season that communicate belonging and signal expertise: \n\n       -  Access to Event Key organizer Discord Channel for voting and resource-sharing\n\n       -  Member directory badges \n\n       -  New role after Event Key activation\n\n2.  Expanding FWB Official Footprint: While it was necessary to have a core team to build a strong foundation, the rest of the community did not get to participate in official FWB events. We can interrupt the narrative that FWB is primarily focused on three core cities by inviting more members to iterate on how FWB's vision and values manifests in their cities. This progression allows for more culturally-relevant global activations.\n\n3.  New Connections: Events are one of the best tools for recruiting new members and deepening existing relations around shared interests & values. Our rolling events & decentralized events will give more opportunities for people to meet, join the squad, and stay engaged URL.\n\n4.  Identify New Leaders: DAOs are fluid and we are always in need of new voices & excitement to keep vibes high. Through more decentralized hosting and community participation, global leaders will emerge.\n\n### Success Metrics\n\nTo assess impact of Event Key V2, FWB will review the following objectives and KPIs: \n\n#### Objective: Strengthen global membership and engagement to build density for FWB across cities\n#### KPIs\n-   New local or global member applications that mention Event Keys leaders or collaborators, event programming, or Cities \n\n-   Identify emergent leadership in new Cities to steward recurring Public or Private Keys \n\n-   Communicate FWB's ongoing commitment to culture through event content capture and social shares \n\n-   Award OurCred for Cities channel engagement\n\n#### Objective: Build out complete infrastructure to support Lite Key\n#### KPIs\n-   Application & SOP \n\n-   Necessary support staff to ensure >80% success \n\n-   Determination of FairShare framework for completed activations\n\n#### Objective: Systemize the process for fully decentralized event programming\n#### KPIs\n-   Create SOP for event key promotion and messaging with marketing \n\n    -   Create easy to use Canva templates \n\n-   Create Event Key specific SOP around brand and cultural partnerships in collaboration with Partnerships \n\n    -   This is for local partnerships like venues, drinks, etc to help with event costs. \n\n-   Coordinate with Treasury/Ops for a Utopia process with greater visibility or payment approvals process or tighter deadlines for requesting advances\n\n    -   Expand budget to compensate organizers, potential overages, and broader programming.\n\n### Considerations\n\nThis is V2 of the Event Keys program so the focus is to scale for quality not quantity. We want to expand our vision stepwise and stress test for robustness so that V3 can be even more ambitious. \n\n-   Communication: As FWB transitions away from core City Leads, there may need to be additional messaging around the how and why of Event Keys across Cities channels. \n\n-   Cities x Partnership: The Cities program is not currently revenue positive; however, this is being explored with the Partnerships team to create a working model. Possible ideas are underwriting programs & smaller Event Key series funded by brands. \n\n-   Rolling Events: Based on the success of Lite Keys, we want to have a team in place that can approve all levels of budget as the opportunities arise.",

      "title": "FWB x Hennessy Partnership",
      "content": "### ABSTRACT \nOver 257 years, the Hennessy brand built an unparalleled legacy in spirits. Core to its success was a reverential embrace of culture, forming priceless bonds with communities of the arts, entertainment, hospitality, and beyond.\n\nAs Web3 technologies enable new community experiences, Hennessy has enthusiastically pursued FWB as a strategic partner for developing new concepts with inspired digital innovation.\n\nWithin this proposed partnership, Friends With Benefits will co-present ‘Cafe 11’ – a first of its kind creative and experiential project accessible to FWB Members and holders of a co-created, Hennessy branded NFT.\n\n\n### MOTIVATION\nFWB Partnerships recognizes the significance of aligning with cultural and commercial global brand leaders for revenue and positioning. This trailblazing collaboration will empower talented members of the DAO to work with influential brands and retain value within the FWB ecosystem now and in the future.\n\nThe motivation is to create revenue opportunities for the FWB Treasury that bring value to the $FWB token while developing Benefit programs, attracting audiences to the FWB community, and further establishing FWB as a thought leader in the Web3 space.\n\n\n### THE \"CAFE 11\" CONCEPT\n‘Cafe 11’ is the title and theme inspired by the Jazz Age and Café Society of early 20th century France. The French appreciation for craft and conviviality was a fertile ground for a creative culture to emerge in the cafes, bars, and social spaces of Paris and Montmartre at the time.\n\nToday, creative communities are similarly exiting the limiting constructs of centralized media platforms and building sovereign creative spaces in Web3 like FWB.\n\nWith Cafe 11, FWB & Hennessy will recreate the energy of those physical gathering places of 100 years ago, serving a spirit of art and alchemy for creatives who never settle.\n\n\n### DETAILS\nThe concept and events will premiere in LA and NYC in Q4 2022. \n\nCafe 11 will be a multi-day experience with a world class bar program as a backdrop for programming, dining, and entertainment.\n\nThe curation for Cafe 11 will be developed in the new Public Works channel in the FWB server. The channel will allow FWB members to participate in the project by proposing and collectively curating elements of the exhibition.\n\nThe physical speakeasy will be accessed through Gatekeeper for holders of $FWB and the Cafe 11 NFT, designed by an FWB community artist. This NFT will additionally grant buyers early and privileged access to future Hennessy Web3 projects and cultural experiences.\n\n(2022) total supply of Cafe 11 NFTs will be available. 1765 will go to public sale, 257 will be allocated for the FWB community. \n\nThe FWB Public Works team will airdrop the 257 NFTs to members participating in the project. FWB members who do not participate to claim the free mint will have early access to purchase the NFT, prior to the public sale.\n\n\n##### SCOPE \nFWB contributors will be responsible for developing the concept and executing the creation of the NFT. FWB contributors will also lead the production on Cafe 11 events including curation, booking, and coordination.\n\nHennessy will drive marketing efforts  and media opportunities for the NFT drop across all brand channels, and support the budget for the Cafe 11 Activation.\n\n\n##### PRICING \n1765 NFTs will be priced at $450 (transacted in ETH) for a total of $794,250 in revenue. FWB will additionally capture 5% of secondary market sales that will be split per the return of capital schedule. \n\n\n##### RETURN OF CAPITAL \nHennessy will receive 66% of gross sales (est. $524,025)\nFWB will receive 34% of the gross sales (est. $270,045)\n\n\n##### BUDGET\nFWB and Hennessy maintain the same 66% / 34% principle in expenditure. FWB specifically, will allocate the following budget against the above revenue:\n\n| Category | Spend |\n| --- | --- |\n| FWB Revenue | 270,045 |\n| Art and Technology (NFTs) | (65,000) |\n| Staffing and Operations | (65,000) |\n| Travel + Expenses | (5,000) |\n| Total Profit | 135,045 |\n| % margin | 50% |\n\nHennessy will allocate their commensurate portion primarily toward the production categories of the activation, with an ongoing accounting reconciled at the completion of the events.\n\n\n### IMPACT ON THE FWB COMMUNITY\nExecuting on the above opportunity would provide the following benefits and opportunities for the community.\n\n1.  Events and Benefits Innovation: Establishing lasting value propositions for the membership in the form of profitable events and scalable IP, from and for FWB.\n\n2.  Meaningful Creative Projects: “Cafe 11” will generate culturally and financially meaningful opportunities for participating FWB members. This FWB x Hennessy collaboration will surface artists, organizers, and professionals from the community to collaborate with the brand icon. Subsequently, it will attract creatives in radius to join FWB, while providing a roadmap for future collaboration pursuits.\n\n3.  Escalating IRL Experiences: Hennessy is a premium global spirits brand with 250+ years of history working in culture, hospitality and entertainment. The collaboration will take FWB hospitality experiences to a whole new level for FWB token holders to enjoy.\n\n4.  Financial Return: The project is projected to create a six figure revenue return that exceeds any prior partnership profits to date.\n\n5.  FWB Visibility: Leveraging the reach and brand recognition status of Hennessy as a partner brings a significant escalation of global cultural cache to the FWB brand, work, and community.\n\n6.  Partnership Playbook: This collaboration would allow FWB to iterate on and formalize a playbook for DAO partnerships. It maintains the position of FWB as a thought leader in the DAO space and offers a templatized playbook for future collaborations.\n\n\n### WAYS TO BE INVOLVED\nBeyond the benefits, FWB membership will have opportunities to materially participate in partnership projects. Below are some of those options:\n\n1.  TEAM: Members can apply for compensated roles within the partnership as they pertain to professional and creative services. The intention is to build a model for talented community members to engage in the project, flex expertise, and receive compensation.\n\n2.  CONTRIBUTOR: Any FWB member who wishes to participate in the Cafe 11 creative experience can do so in a new Public Works channel. Up to 257 members who participate will receive a free mint of the Cafe 11 Hennessy NFT.\n\n3.  GUEST: FWB token holders will have access to the Cafe 11 experience in LA and NY taking place in Q4 2022, with future dates to be announced pending project success.\n\n\n### SUCCESS METRICS\nTo assess the impact of the partnership, FWB will review the following results:\n\n#### Objective 1: Involve FWB membership in the co-creation, compensation, collaboration, and collection of the efforts to bring an experience to market.\n\nKPIs:\n-   Identify and engage capable FWB members in professional co-creation of the project  \n-   Generate original IP alongside the FWB membership\n-   Drive organic conversation around the project as it develops in the go-to-market period\n\n#### Objective 2: Create financial returns for the FWB Treasury and drive value to the $FWB Token\n\nKPIs:\n-   Provide timely and transparent accounting made available to Public Works Channel\n-   Net-positive profit after costs of first phase of project execution in Q4 2022\n-   Native integration and utility of $FWB within the project\n\n#### Objective 3: Drive FWB brand and benefit value to the membership by increasing visibility, creating new experiences, and welcoming new audiences to FWB.\n\nKPIs:\n-   Measurable / rankable earned media in lifestyle, spirits, arts and culture press as well as social media outside of the FWB community that names the partnership, concept, and activation\n-   Organic user generated social media (including FWB Discord) content with positive sentiment toward the execution / experience of an event\n-   New member applications that mention Hennessy, related categories (a la spirits, hospitality, food and beverage, arts and culture), visible collaborators of the project, or press mentions\n\n\n### CONSIDERATIONS\nFWB is confident in the success of this project and its benefits for the FWB membership, after discussing and considering the below:\n\n1.  Event Radius: The initial Cafe11 activation will be physically limited to participants in the LA and NY markets.\n\n2.  Volatile Market: Given recent market volatility there is some uncertainty in transacting in ETH and selling an NFT asset.\n\n3.  Age Restriction: Event attendance will be limited to individuals 21+ in age, perhaps excluding a small portion of the FWB membership.",

      "title": "FWB Liquidity Improvement Plan",
      "content": "### Friends with Benefits - Liquidity Improvement Plan \nFWB Treasury Team - May 13, 2022\n\n#### Goal \nImprove the liquidity pool of the FWB token by  launching an active liquidity management program.\n\n#### Rationale \nA healthy liquidity pool is crucial for the infrastructure and growth of FWB. A well-functioning liquidity pool should facilitate the transfer of tokens and accommodate spikes in volatility. \n\nTo date, most liquidity has been provided by FWB token holders with an eagerness to create a strong foundation for the community. However, in recent months, liquidity has declined on the existing pool due to the expiration of token-based incentives. This is expected as liquidity based on incentive schemes are highly unstable. As a result, swaps of a material size (over 100 $FWB) have significantly impacted the token value in both directions.This pool is currently provided by a few wallets, which also poses a risk. Ultimately, the current liquidity pool is not doing its job to facilitate the smooth and efficient transfer of tokens or the on-and-off boarding of community members.   \n\n#### Solution \nTo improve and deepen the liquidity pool, the FWB Treasury team, in conjunction with Llama and Gamma Strategies, propose a new solution. This approach utilizes the capital efficiency offered by Uniswap's V3 upgrade. The V3 upgrade allows liquidity to be concentrated around certain ranges, which can improve the swapping experience for the user by causing less slippage. In addition, fewer tokens are required for optimal liquidity, due to the increased token pair concentration. With these improvements, the V3 platform is extremely complex and time consuming, even for advanced DeFi users. An Active Liquidity Management (ALM) program can address this. \n\nALM strategies actively adjust the parameters of a position on behalf of the liquidity pool. As an ALM program, Gamma's smart contracts automatically manage the token ranges, rebalance assets, and manage the fees earned for optimal yields.\n\n#### Specifics \n1.  The team at Llama will develop an escrow contract that will hold $ETH and $FWB. For the initial trial, up to 50 $ETH and the equivalent amount of $FWB will be loaned by the community treasury.  After the successful launch of the initial trial, this proposal gives the FWB treasury team the option to loan another allocation of up to 50 ETH and the equivalent amount of $FWB to the contract, if required by the team.  \n\n2.  The escrow contract will be designed so only the FWB DAO can withdraw from it, via the established multisig setup. As such, Llama will only be able to direct the liquidity to an ALM manager like Gamma. \n\n3.  Given the complexity and time consuming nature of liquidity management, Llama will work with Gamma's smart contracts to facilitate the strategy.\n\n4.  At any time, the community can vote to remove the tokens from the escrow contract.\n\n#### Risks\nThere are three primary risks associated with this program:\n\n1.  Impermanent loss: a primary risk with liquidity on AMMs. Impermanent loss occurs when the price of assets deposited in a liquidity pool changes relative to when the user originally deposited them. One could realize a loss if they withdraw their position at a lower dollar value than when they deposited. Gamma's smart contracts utilize machine learning techniques to minimize impermanent loss and optimize for fees. (A backtest of the past 100 days has shown the projected impermanent loss is less than 0.5%).\n\n2.  Token custody: the tokens could get compromised by one of the other entities (Llama or Gamma) involved in this program. This risk is mitigated by the limited escrow contract functionalities with Llama (no withdrawal allowance). Gamma does not have power to withdraw funds either, but given some of the inherent flexibility of the ALM contracts, this can be a risk. Additional reading on Gamma's structure can be found [here](https://docs.gamma.xyz/gamma/). \n\n3.  Smart contract risk: the program will rely on both an escrow smart contract and Gamma's smart contracts. Only Llama and FWB's multisig can interact with these contracts. The escrow contract developed by Llama will be a simple structure, with clearly defined deposit and withdrawal functionalities. It will also be vetted by our technical community members before implementation. Gamma's smart contracts have been audited by Arbitrary Execution, Consensys Diligence, and CertiK. Although Gamma suffered an exploit of its staking contract (unrelated to the liquidity management contract) in the past, the issue has since been remedied and audited by Arbitrary Execution and ConsenSys Diligence. Moreover, the private liquidity management contracts are further protected by a whitelist which limits who can deposit to and withdraw from the Gamma position. The whitelist protections implemented by Gamma offer the strongest protection against flashloan exploit risk as no other party aside from Llama and FWB would be able to deposit or withdraw from the Gamma position manager contract.\n\n#### Success metrics \n-   Reduced volatility in token value (both up and down) relative to the natural volatility of the overall crypto market \n\n-   Slippage for the average token swap of 75 FWB remains under 2% \n\n-   More durable and sustainable approach to liquidity, without dilutive or circular incentive programs \n\n#### Costs \nIf successful, the ALM program will be a cost effective method of pool support, as it does not rely on native token incentives. In the past, these incentive programs have been costly for the DAO. In order to implement this program, the service providers' fees (Llama and Gamma) will be the primary cost rather than native token incentives (FWB). Overall, we believe that the cost of this program will be significantly lower than previous approaches.\n\nLlama will be responsible for setting up the escrow contract, coordinating with Gamma's smart contracts, and managing the ongoing position and reporting. This will require a total cost of $30,000, paid over a 6 month period ($10k upfront, $4k per month for 5 months).  \n\nGamma strategy smart contracts take 10% of the fees generated from the liquidity pool. In addition, when a rebalance occurs, the gas fees are charged to the DAO. According to the Gamma team, gas fees will range from about $200-600 per rebalance. And it's roughly estimated that 15-20 rebalances will occur over a year, though this number can vary higher or lower. Gas costs will be an ongoing metric which Llama, Gamma, and the FWB treasury team will monitor. In total, FWB can expect to incur approximately $30k or more in the first year.\n\n#### Additional reading\nFor additional information and analysis, please see the [detailed liquidity report from Gamma Strategies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14A3I6g06vxSI8jBV2Ry6HQ0HvycG8tHsK9QATGdLbO8/edit), which outlines how their smart contracts can improve FWB liquidity. \n\nA community call will be held with the Llama, Gamma, and FWB treasury team to discuss the details of this proposal and answer any questions.\n\n#### Background on Llama\n-   Llama builds economic infrastructure for DAOs. We are an opinionated layer on top of DeFi protocols that helps DAOs take treasury actions including treasury diversification, liquidity provisioning, token swaps, and more.\n\n-   Llama has worked with Aave, Uniswap, Gitcoin, PoolTogether, Fei Protocol, dYdX, Radicle, Index Coop, FWB, and Harvest Finance, among others. We've developed treasury strategies, designed liquidity programs, constructed on-chain indices, and built dashboards and financial reports.\n\n-   Llama has worked with FWB in the past, has been a signer on the FWB multi-sig in its earliest days, and helped with initial Treasury accounting, financial reporting, and treasury diversification strategy.",

      "title": "Season 6 Digital Events",
      "content": "### Title: Season 6 Digital Events Proposal\n\nTeam: Brian Mark, Digital Events Manager, Zoe Rogers, Digital Production Manager\n\nLinks:\n\n-   Snapshot format proposal\n\n-   [Proposed Budget Detail](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16tY8dPGxPCvf5vXlLYEPNPmmO_kihIINbYQwNz8bKo8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n-   [Show Programming Detail](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IR8S0umiAHDC2SZnpfxczOq5LPTknTBFhXqYdRouNa8/edit)\n\n-   [Tech Needs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iL0SQ9ydR9w33mtJHuMexKpAk4ic1kH27g3lIWEMYk4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n#### Description:\nThis proposal will fund FWB Digital Events programming for Season Six (May-June 2022). This season, we'll continue to focus on polishing our overall quality, adding new layers of distribution, and honing our outreach and marketing strategy to reach a broader audience with our core programming.\n\nImpact on broader FWB community: Our live digital events are focused on adding immediate value for FWB members, providing opportunities for entertainment, community connection, and education. Digital events are how we connect virtually as an FWB community in real time, but they can do more. In Season 6, we'll create evergreen access to our content and programming via the Archive, ensuring that what we're creating delivers not only immediate benefit for the community but also a legacy of consumable content. Investing in world-class content that's tailored to the interests of this community fuels engagement, education and visibility for FWB.\n\n#### Details: \nOur priorities for Season Six are as follows.\n\n-   Standardizing compensation for shows and clarifying roles and requirements for show hosts and producers.\n\n-   Improving audio + production quality\n\n-   Implementing simple rails for content distribution, for the community and non-members\n\n-   Work on tooling and infrastructure to streamline broadcasting processes.\n\n-   Reintroduction of one-off events. \n\nOur Discord-only content is important to the community and drives significant value for members, but we need to have a wider reach and improve engagement. We'll strike a balance between stellar, members-only community conversations and creating incredible content to share with the world. \n\n#### FWB Core Show Lineup:\nWe will be narrowing our lineup and focusing on existing shows for season six. See full show details [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IR8S0umiAHDC2SZnpfxczOq5LPTknTBFhXqYdRouNa8/edit). We are focusing on a smaller subset of shows this season, and planning to dedicate more time to marketing and supporting to make these shows the best they can be. We are also standardizing comp for Digital Events this season to create a consistent and more equitable system. Compensation available per episode is as follows:\n\nHosts: $500, divisible as desired between hosts\nProducers: $250, as needed\nGuests: 5 FWB each, max two guests per episode.\n\n-   NFT Pirate Radio. Fridays @ 12PM PST. Hosts will rotate and include @yuri_beats, @nopattern and @drewcoffman. The platform for the NFT Curatorial Team to discuss NFT Projects and interview important developers and artists in the space.\n\n-   Collective: Breath. Monthly. Host; @yanasosna, Millana Snow and @boreta. Monthly wellness + mindfulness session focused on community safety and well-being.\n\n-   Coffee Time: Weds 1-2PM PST. Host Derek Taylor. Producer Jesse Boykins. Weekly live conversations Wednesdays at 1pm PST around creation, emotional intelligence, inspiration, and intention.\n\n-   Web3 Security: Monthly. Host Kyle Thornton. Covers the ins and outs of web3 security.\n\n-   New Member Hangs: Monthly. Hosts @brian mark + @kd. Drive new member engagement and community sentiment.\n\n-   Jerome's Niece. Episodes delivered monthly. Music + web3. Hosts: Max Alcabes + Kyle Sutton.\n\n#### ADDING SHOWS:\nNew shows will be added to the lineup through the FWB Garage proposal program. New shows should submit proposals to fund a pilot run of episodes, funded at the same standard rate as above. Shows that find success based on the \"Live Show Expectations\" below will be considered for addition to the recurring roster for next season.\n\n#### ONE-OFF DIGITAL EVENTS:\nSome of our most well-attended and celebrated events in Seasons Four and Five were not a part of our regularly scheduled programming. We'll increase our focus on delivering one or two high-profile, innovative digital events for the community on a monthly basis. We may tap recurring hosts to support this, or may recruit other members to host. \n\n#### QUALITY:\nThis season, we'll continue to undertake a number of efforts to ensure we're delivering world-class content that represents the values and quality of the FWB Community.\n\n-   Show Marketing: Will partner with show hosts and the FWB brand and marketing teams to create promotional materials, logos, and audio identities/bumpers for all permanent shows.\n\n-   Audio Quality: Ensure hosts have the tools required to record premium audio, including hardware and software as needed.\n\n#### CONTENT DISTRIBUTION:\nProviding additional routes for content consumption ensures maximum community value for our global member base, and allows us to explore monetization of content.\n\n-   We are working to deliver a FWB.Archive (aka FWB.AMP), our token-gated audio archive, for all FWB members. Timeline is currently uncertain due to engineering resources. This part of the proposal doesn't require any new funding.\n\n#### Live Show Expectations:\nFor hosts whose content is produced live in the Discord, expectations are as follows:\n\n-   Consistent well thought out shows and reliability.\n\n-   Help drive attendance. Share description/guests/topics minimum 48hrs before air time, and ideally by Thurs of the week prior so we can get it in tl;dr.\n\n-   Strive for a minimum attendance of 2% of the active FWB community, and track show attendance.\n\n-   Record and share recordings after the show.\n\n-   Engage with the editorial team and community for show promotion.\n\nShow performance will be evaluated on the below metrics, and all shows will be reviewed and renewed on a monthly basis.\n\n-   Attendance. People showing up for live events is the best metric for success.\n\n    -   Enabler: Bot to record attendance in voice/live channels.\n\n-   Consumption. Listens/downloads of events after the fact shows broader demand for async consumption.\n\n    -   Enabler: Archive solution should have a listen/view counter included\n\n#### Amplifying Content:\n\n-   Partner with Editorial for digital event coverage, help ensure events are pre/post-covered in digest/editorial where it makes sense\n\n-   Partner with Social Media to amplify key moments + content\n\n-   Identify key events/sessions we may want to open up to a broader non-member audience.\n\n#### Looking forward:\nIn season six, we want to refine the process for adding \"Channel Chats\" (member-led affinity group conversations) to the calendar, as well as a process for proposing one-off digital events for future seasons. We'll also execute a community digital events survey during season six to guide programming and planning for season seven.\n\n| | MAY | JUNE | TOTAL |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BUDGET (USDC) | $18,500 | $18,500 | $37,000 |\n| BUDGET (FWB) | 125 | 125 | 250 |\n\n#### Budget Overview:\nHost to be paid in $USDC equivalent. Permanent hosts to be paid on the 1st of each month. Pilot hosts to be paid monthly. Payment can be sent in $FWB but will be converted at market rate at time of payment pegged to $USDC as noted above.

      "title": "FWB Discord Maintenance - Season 6",
      "content": "Author(s):  KD, Alex Zhang, Lindsay Howard, CJ Webber + FWB Community\n\nAbstract\n--------\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to introduce a series of core adjustments to our Discord to help new and existing members connect, contribute, and get to know each other better by improving its accessibility and transparency.\n\nDiscord has been our home base since day one, and has been where FWB members from around the world can connect and come together as a community. As we've grown, so have the complexities of how we interact with each other in the chat, and this Season, we want to make significant improvements to how the Discord is organized and facilitated. \n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nWe've heard from community members that FWB's Discord can be overwhelming --- especially for newcomers --- which ultimately discourages people from participating in discussions, supporting initiatives, and finding ways to get involved. Even existing members often don't know where to start in terms of contributing to conversations and initiatives, which can lead to stagnation or a lack of participation. \n\nOverview\n--------\n\nThis proposal centers around three substantial improvements to the current Discord:\n\n1.  New Member Onboarding. To improve the first 30 day experience of a new FWB member by helping them ease their way into the Discord, help them identify which channels and programs they might connect with best, and ultimately ensure a stronger Member experience. \n\n2.  FWB Public Works. To create clearer ways for the community to contribute and add a level of transparency and accountability to contributor work streams, that is accessible to all approved members, both Local and Global. \n\n3.  Channel Leads. Uplevel the amount of activity, community, and benefits across key Categories in the Discord including Creative (#art, #music-industry, #photography), Learning (#daos, #taxes, #social-tokens), Trading (#defi, #degen, #trading-crypto), Lifestyle (#selfies-n-fits, #plants-and-animals, #food) and NFTs (#nft-general-chat, #alpha-alert).\n\nImplementation\n--------------\n\n#### New Member Discord Onboarding\n\nWhat do the first 30 minutes of a new member's experience within the FWB Discord look like?\n\nInstead of overwhelming new members with all of the channels, we want to productize a drip-fed approach so they have a customized entry to the community.\n\nAfter acceptance and successful wallet connection, we propose the following:\n\nNew members land on the #welcome channel, which includes:\n\n-   #start-here (a high-level overview of FWB, the core team, how to get involved, a call-to-action to post in #introductions, and a link out to the FWB Knowledge Base (coming soon!))\n\n-   #rules\n\n-   #introductions\n\n-   #help\n\n-   #wallet-security\n\n-   #code-of-conduct\n\n-   #notifications\n\nOnce a new member shares a bit about themselves in #introductions, they are prompted to select one of two options:\n\n-   \"Do you want us to curate some channels for you?\" \n\n-   They will be guided to join three channels that have active Channel Leads, based on the interests they identified in their application process\n\nAfter seven days of getting to know the community through these curated channels, they will then have access to the entire Discord\n\n-   \"Do you want access to the entire Discord?\"\n\n-   The full server opens up immediately \n\nSoon after posting their introduction, new members will receive a reply in the #introductions channel from a Membership Co-Pilot focused on introducing them to other members with similar interests, making them aware of projects, and suggesting other ways to get involved.\n\nWe'll also open up #fwb-general-chat to all members and archive the current #fwb-town-square to create a space where all members can participate in conversation.\n\n#### FWB-Public-Works\n\nNow that we have 30+ contributors collaborating across a dozen different work streams, more visibility is needed into our progress, decision making, and roadmaps. Active and appropriate contributor-led projects will move into a public work stream format so community members can find roles and opportunities, participate in discussions, and have a better sense of what the DAO is prioritizing. We hope that FWB Public Works will become the new onramp for contributor activity, but the current contributor application flow will remain in place for the duration of Season 6. \n\nWith a combination of read-only and read/write channels, FWB-Public-Works will provide status updates and work-in-public streams for active FWB projects and initiatives, and be accessible to both Local and Global members. \n\n-   The read-only channels will host status updates from project leads, with all members able to submit public feedback on the updates (to be populated in #feedback channel) \n\n-   The read/write channels will host public workstreams for wider community initiatives\n\nThe channels will initially be populated by: \n\n-   Read-Only Status Updates\n\n-   our-cred\n\n-   works-in-progress\n\n-   product\n\n-   fellowships\n\n-   digital-events\n\n-   partnerships\n\n-   Read/Write Community Initiatives\n\n-   member-directory\n\n-   fwb-fest\n\n-   hop-louie\n\n-   artists-in-residence\n\n-   A #feedback channel where the core team and wider membership can engage with feedback.\n\n#### Channel Leads\n\nChannel Leads will act as designated community stewards tasked with connecting people, stirring conversation, and coming up with benefits on a channel-specific basis so everyone feels welcome in the Discord. Initially, Channel Leads will be selected by the Membership team based on past channel activity, as well as by peer and self-nomination to ensure it's a diverse and inclusive group. Note that due to the current structure and permissions of the Discord, you will need to be a Global member to become a Channel Lead.\n\nChannel Leads will be responsible for:\n\n-   Maintaining a lively, fun environment in their channels\n\n-   Ideating and producing 2-3 benefits and impromptu community experiences for the DAO that are relevant to those channel categories\n\n-   These could be out-of-the-box ideas, including product discounts, guest list spots, specialized digital events, gift exchanges, synchronous channel calls, etc.\n\n-   Sharing news about their channels' members for TL;DR and other marketing efforts\n\n-   Empowered to schedule and host community-led chats on a recurring basis if they want to (like the currently ongoing social impact call, music call, etc)\n\nThe Channel Leads will maintain communication with each other to share best practices, and meet on a monthly basis with the Membership team. They will be compensated through a combination of OurCred and 20 $FWB tokens per month.\n\nOutcomes & Success Metrics\n--------------------------\n\nAs we implement this plan, we'll track how many new members go through the entire onboarding flow (and where they get stuck), engagement on the server, and also increased diversity --- which means more voices in more channels, and more members involved with more projects. We'll also engage directly with members via feedback sessions to gauge how the changes are impacting member activity in the server. \n\nWe'll provide seasonal updates to the community with qualitative and quantitative progress on these goals, and will conclude Season 6 with findings and recommendations from the outcomes of this proposal. \n\nBudget\n------\n\nMembership Co-Pilots (responsible for new member #introductions in the Discord) and Channel Leads (heading up their respective \"neighborhood\" channel categories) are an important part of this proposal, and will require treasury budget allocation.\n\n-   5 Co-Pilots x 5 $FWB x 3 months (one season)\n\n-   75 $FWB (at time of proposal equal to approx $3400 USD) \n\n-   10-15 Channel Leads x 20 $FWB x 3 months (one season)\n\n-   600-900 $FWB (at time of proposal equal to approx $28K-$40K USD)\n\nSEASON TOTAL:  675-975 $FWB (or $31K-$43K USD)\n\nDuring Season 6, OurCred will be expanded to become a more robust contributor compensation tool. After the initial pilot season of these programs, the intention is to shift these fixed amounts to an appropriately weighted OurCred compensation payout. \n\nTimeline\n--------\n\nIf the vote is successful, these improvements will be implemented immediately.",

      "title": "FWB Garage Season 6",
      "content": "Author(s):  Emerson Kirk (Emo - @emolikememo), Alex Zhang (Zhang - @alexxzzhang)\n\nAbstract\n--------\n\nFWB Garage™ is a grants program of $50,0000 ( ~800 $FWB today) for Season 6. The grants program will allow any approved FWB member to request up to $10k for a specific project or initiative where the community will collectively decide which projects are funded for the season.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nFWB has incredible talent bursting with ideas to make FWB (and web3) a better place to live. \n\nHowever, we have noticed four challenges when it comes to the efficacy of community-led proposals, including:\n\n1.  Potential applicants aren't familiar with what types of proposals would be most additive to the DAO, so likely don't submit when their ideas and skills could be helpful.\n\n2.  Proposals are developed separately from the existing roadmap, and can lead to conflicts or very similar projects receiving funds.\n\n3.  Funded projects don't receive the same level of visibility, marketing, and integration because they are developed independently from the rest of the DAO.\n\n4.  Voters are shown the proposal budget but aren't given enough context into related costs within the DAO or adjacent projects, leading to less informed voting.\n\nImpact on FWB Community \n------------------------\n\nGrants will enable the community to more easily experiment in a way that expands upon our current programs, products, and initiatives. Our hope is that the grants program will enable FWB members to experiment with new ideas and approaches, which may lead to the development of projects that become core to FWB and our mission.\n\n### Overview\n\nWe believe the current challenges faced by community-led proposals can be improved upon by the introduction of a more formalized, prompted, and overarching FWB grants program. \n\nGarage™ will seek to provide $50,000 ( ~800 $FWB today) in grant capital to fund creative, experimental projects on a seasonal, three-month basis starting with Season 6 (which runs April-June 2022). \n\nFor Garage Cohort 1, we are doing an open call for projects that seek inspiration from FWB's theme while also addressing these below prompts and operate generally within these existing categories of operations. \n\nWe are looking for projects that may address the following prompts:\n\n-   FWB's core values include agency, convergence, advocacy, and ownership. What do these terms mean to you, and how can we expand on that in our programming?\n\n-   As Web3 has become a household name, it's also become an entire industry, and unimaginable amounts of capital, talent and attention have flown into the space. What is gained through that process, and what's lost that we want to actively hold onto?\n\n-   FWB is designed to be non-hierarchical and exploratory, breaking with traditional models of the past. What is a traditional model of a past industry that FWB could champion or push forward?\n\n-   Through open, shared discussions across the DAO, we're collaboratively building what we want and need, and allowing new forms of connection to emerge. It's about autonomy, following one's gut instincts, and being an active, fully-alive participant. How can we encourage involvement as new members join the DAO?\n\nGarage™ is designed to support FWB members in developing new products, experiences, content, or any experiment that makes FWB a better city to live in. This is NOT limited to just technical products or artworks but any small, creative endeavor that may resonate with other community members that falls within this Season's core categories.\n\nCommunity -- Events, City Initiatives, Public Discourse\n\nTooling -- Products, Features, Discord Bots\n\nContent -- Stories, Narratives, Visuals, Videos, Explainer Guides\n\nArt -- Public Art, Music\n\nOther -- 😈 \n\nThis is an open-ended grants program that supports community driven initiatives financially as well as providing support by situating the grantee in the larger FWB organization if necessary. \n\nPractically, here are some types of projects that Contributing teams would be keen on integrating\n\n-   Long form investigative research piece on WIP [Content]\n\n-   Public art project [Cities]\n\n-   and many more!\n\n### Process\n\nFWB Garage is structured to allow grant recipients a meaningful amount of time (one season) to create an impactful version of their project while also ensuring its success in adoption, marketing, and distribution by attaching it to an existing Contributor Team vertical. \n\n1.  Application period will run for two weeks at the start of each season. \n\n2.  The Governance Team will review, format, and prep proposals for community vote.\n\n3.  The community can allocate up to $50k to projects with a cap of $10k max per project with guidance from the Governance Team. \n\n4.  Once grants are approved, the recipients will attend biweekly meetings with an associated contributor team to track the project's progress and receive support. \n\n5.  At the end of the season, the Governance Team will prepare a document outlining the outcome of the projects, including wins, lessons learned, and successfully integrated projects. We'll also share a proposal for the next season's budget to either increase or decrease based on the current Season's success.\n\n### Outcomes & Success Metrics\n\nAt the end of Season 6, we'd ideally like to see at least two projects from FWB Garage become fully integrated into the DAO, so that we can provide resources to build them out in full. For example, this could be an MVP that we build into the website or an article we design a program around, etc.\n\nFWB Garage is envisioned as the experimental arm of FWB, where community members can test new ideas that improve our community---and web3---for the better. \n\nWe're also excited to offer continued funding to projects that show exceptional promise, which means we'll be able to support new products, departments, and events that showcase the best of web3.\n\nIf the program is successful, we can also explore increasing the budget through strategic sponsorships, similar to how we've funded hackathons in the past.\n\nBenefits\n\n-   Increase community experimentation and participation in making FWB a more interesting place to live\n\n-   Ability to fund projects that show exceptional promise and implement them into core work streams of the DAO\n\n-   FWB is distributed to creatives, builders, and contributors\n\nDrawbacks\n\n-   There is not clear output/impact of the large sum of money that we are putting towards these projects\n\n-   Hackathon will be deprioritized for Season 6\n\n### Budget\n\nWe'll allocate $50k of the treasury in FWB tokens towards FWB Garage, with each project receiving no more than $10k. A portion of the funding will be allocated from the hackathon budget, which will be replaced by FWB Garage. Our intent is to provide grant applicants with a longer timeline to create projects, and to engage the community more broadly in the process.",

      "title": "FWB Radio",
      "content": "Team: Raihan Anwar, Naomi Menezes\n\nAbstract: Greenlight launch of 2 Seasons (24 Editions) of FWB Radio for $105,000 total (USDC + FWB blended). \n\nDescription: This proposal will focus on scoping out FWB Radio. A new iteration of radio built on community and collaboration. It will focus on high quality content, and be artist led and curated with partners. Its key components will be mix-style audio and a product/website built to support its unique distribution.\n\nImpact on broader FWB community: FWB's earliest community growth has spawned from music. The community is home to artists, influential tastemakers and more --- many of whom are looking for ways to give back to the community, and bring in other cultural icons. The successful launch of the radio vertical gives us the opportunity to:\n\n-   engage existing members\n-   invite new artists for collaboration\n-   build rails for the best practices in the web3 music space. \n\nA native radio station format gives the FWB community as well as potential new members an easy touchpoint to understand and texturize our community's unique culture. It will generate an archive of evergreen content, be a meaningful way to reach out to cultural figures for collaboration and form a tangible benefit for existing token holders while driving awareness to new members. There is a lot of flexibility for partnership explorations within this format which could be used as promotional and revenue tools for FWB. Additionally, FWB Radio will sync with existing FWB properties (Works In Progress, Gatekeeper) and web3 partners at large (Metalabel, SoundXYZ, Catalog) to provide further cultural resonance.\n\nDetails: \nFWB Radio will contain three components to start, with the ability to iterate and build on top of. \n\nIn brief, these steps will be: \n\n1.  Radio Product: A web3 native website built to support live streaming audio and house the archive of shows. The product will emphasize the quality of mix vs 24/7 availability of music. We will go in depth to the product functionality later in this proposal. \n\n2.  Curatorial Line-Up: The radio will not have residents; but rotating curators for set amounts of time. Once the product is built, we can work the cadence of curators on top of this. \n\n3.  IRL Events: We will work with the schedule of already planned events and activations to book our existing FWB Radio curators into our IRL events. \n\nThese are the core functions of the Radio on its own, and it can be amplified with existing editorial, design, product and social support FWB has. \n\nRADIO PRODUCT\nWe want to rethink the delivery of traditional radio for our owned product, with a focus on highly curated, quality mixes as opposed to 24/7 on-air programming. This approach will make the radio station function like a magazine versus a traditional station -- with monthly themes rotating curators assigned for set schedules. We can explore the ideas of 'seasons' within the radio brand, as we do with the DAO as a whole. \n\nA key part of this will be in the delivery of the mixes. Every week a new 4 hour mix will be available for public consumption on a loop, building a habit with our listeners and ensuring these mixes become listenable and a manageable part of their day. The mixes will be archived into a token-gated section to access for asynchronous play after this. \n\nIn order to emphasize the thought and quality curation behind this, we would want to build 'liner notes' within the player. Where the DJ can write notes and thoughts behind their selections at the timestamps versus voicing them over on the mix. Think of how the SoundCloud comments section function currently. \n\nIn addition to liner notes, each mix will push visual and aesthetic boundaries on how a traditional mixed set can be consumed with compiled imagery, photos, sounds that the curators select to further create textures to these individual sets. Verified community members will also have the ability to post notes/comments on mixes. \n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/e034MDNxKqth2nUB6lhqOWd7GQ_DOKxXYAtuDKFxGk_nngo4ks3b8F3V1d98NH0Sjnwu2m9AMiFmAOljTt-T-B7WhEyvZC6exDUAvuMQJ7NQJJz3h8gqYXxDcoExyoRu-QEtYiUH)\n\nSELECTORS/DJs\nFWB comprises many subcultures, and it makes sense to tap adjacent communities to curate the daily mixes. \n\nOur first cohort of artists will be community members, from established musical creatives (Jacques Greene, Latasha, Rowan Spencer [Public Records NYC]) to adjacent community tastemakers (Ishan's metal hour. Eric Hu overdubbing mechanical keyboard noises to jazz.)\n\nFrom there, our goal is to establish monthly residencies with culture makers from party promoters like Hot Mass to non-music focused creatives like Martine Syms, and cultural institutions such as 032c. We want residencies to feel like an expression of their music taste and community from a personal standpoint, and will give these lead curators a budget to work with their friends and partners to bring their own mixes and stories to the monthly set up. We have the chance to really tap into promotional cycles with this approach -- offering an artist with a new release to use this as a promotional channel or maybe partnering with a movie's music supervisors ahead of a release for a deep dive on the sounds of their film.\n\nIRL EVENTS \nThere is a natural transition between this virtual curation to an IRL event. We can have a party with a relevant partner when their monthly mix series drops in one of our DAO cities, or book featured artists within the lineups for one of our tentpole events. This can always be an additional value proposition when talking to partners. \n\nPARTNERSHIPS\nPartnership opportunities exist between Initiatives within FWB as well as outside brands and partners.\n\nWIP x FWB Radio \nAs a part of the FWB Editorial arm, Works In Progress has quickly established itself as a unique voice in the Web3 space that is driven by thoughtful exploration of what's possible. In collaboration with FWB Radio, WIP will collaborate on editorial aspects of the project. Possible avenues for this collaboration include assisting with defining overarching curatorial themes, identifying opportunities for crossover between FWB Radio themes and WIP pieces, and assisting with the editorial components for the mixes themselves. \n\nFWB Radio introduces yet another way to contextualize the FWB community to outside brands and partners who are values aligned with our community, similar to our Digital Events or Editorial streams.\n\nTREASURY FRAMEWORK:\n-   The entire listening experience will be token gated to 5 $FWB, driving token velocity and another touch point for our community.\n-   Select components of FWB RADIO sets will be available to purchase as NFTs with splits to contributing parties.\n-   Curators compensated in $FWB to ensure continued propagation of FWB token to cultural creators and maintainers.\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lbGqC4Ca2RZMeO1Efe2AQyHbxR9fryMN191Uwv4to6S8th6f0Zyw_acgOqbqj5CiKAOtUk10WJK-Y0Dyyv5ACXHAisNOFXhNLd4PjZqtnn34K3FRmnnVhcFmproI7gW65iRTwj9E)\n\nBudget Overview: Selectors to be paid in $FWB.

      "title": "S5 FWB Friends with Beans",
      "content": "Author(s):  #COFFEE Thread, drafted by derekgtaylor#7693, raihan#8888, brian mark#7846, greg bresnitz#9919.\n\nAbstract\n--------\n\nIf successful, this proposal will fund a pilot run of the Friends With Beans program, which is a subscription coffee service for the FWB member community, committed to delivering the best coffee experience to our membership at fair and transparent prices. There's ample appetite from the community for great coffee, and we have the ability to deliver. We'll pilot this in a limited way for S5, and will expand our offering in S6 and beyond if successful.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nCoffee is important to the culture of FWB. We've got a number of members currently or formerly working in the coffee trade, and even more members who are passionate coffee brewers and drinkers. We want to ensure that our members have access to incredible beans wherever they live, and see an opportunity to deepen community connection through shared coffee ritual experiences.\n\nImpact on FWB community \n------------------------\n\nThe FWBeans program will connect members passionate about coffee with great coffee, and with one another. It will create activity/utility on the FWB token, will allow us to test an owned DTC product offering, and will either be revenue positive. It will also ensure that the membership is drinking only the finest coffee.\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nThis proposal will approve a five shipment pilot run of our NFT-powered subscription coffee service. We'll list 100 NFTs for sale on ZORA at ~5 $FWB mint price, each of which will be redeemable for a ten-week (five shipment) subscription. Every two weeks, members will receive 12oz of mind-blowing coffee plus exclusive coffee gear, FWB swag, and virtual experiences. If successful, we'll expand the offering in Season 6 to include dedicated internal resources, additional geographies, and a broader product offering.\n\nDetails\n-------\n\n-   Team recruits a designer to create NFT, packaging, and collateral designs.\n\n-   Team lists NFTs on Zora at the cost of ~5FWB each. Fifty each of the WILD and MILD NFT, which will have distinct art.\n\n-   Members will redeem their NFTs on a dedicated site, where they'll connect their wallets and enter their shipping details. For S5, this program is available to CONUS addresses only.\n\n-   Orders will be transmitted to supplier for fulfillment. \n\n-   Subscribers will receive a package every two weeks, which will include 12oz of incredible coffee, plus exclusive coffee swag. Current plans include a members-only diner mug, elite brewing tools, and virtual cuppings.\n\n-   We'll collect subscriber feedback to inform S6 proposal, and will use the results of the final cupping to dictate coffee choices for S6.\n\nExisting relationships and infrastructure make this initial pilot easy to execute. As such, the team executing requests only one mint each in exchange for coordination and project management (four mints total).\n\nAdditional details:\n\n-   Mint week of 2/14, first shipment week of 2/21.\n\n-   Max quantity of 100 sign-ups. If it doesn't sell out within three days, we can either burn the remaining NFTs or open them up to the public.\n\n-   If not all NFT sales are claimed for subscriptions, any unspent funds will return to treasury.\n\n-   Costs assume super-high quality beans. All prices listed are wholesale price with no markup. Wildly transparent.\n\n-   Coffee curated by Raihan and Derek, who both have hefty coffee bona fides.\n\n### Discussion\n\nWhile there are other coffee subscriptions available, we believe we're uniquely positioned to add value to the community by delivering stellar coffee plus compelling FWB community connection. \n\n### Roadmap\n\nInclude the next steps to accomplish the initial end-state. Can be as detailed or as high-level as you like to start with --- this is not a project plan, it's just a way to explain what you're planning.\n\n1.  Source the beans & determining MVP for first Season \n\n2.  Add any additional schwag costs\n\n3.  Coffee Thread Feedback + Proposal Update + Snapshot\n\n4.  Design label + NFT \n\n5.  Set up logistics with Cat & Cloud\n\n6.  Post on Zora\n\n7.  GTM Sales\n\n8.  Redeem NFT \n\n9.  Ship Coffee\n\n### Outcomes & success measures\n\n1.  Sell through all 100 NFT w/ 80%+ redemption \n\n2.  Waitlist for next drop \n\n3.  Social media chatter around coffee \n\n4.  Increase NFT sales for season 6\n\n5.  Stronger bond for Food / Coffee channels \n\n6.  FOMOOB - Fear Of Missing Out On Beans\n\n### Looking forward\n\nFriends With Beans becomes a steady revenue stream for FWB DAO. Healthy annual sales + merch drops & special collabs that allow us to build a retail presence using squad knowledge. Able to introduce other verticals (tea) to the audience. \n\nPotential for $500,000 in sales in one year.  \n\n### Budget\n\nWe want FWBeans to be treasury-neutral or -positive in S5, offering incredible value to members while also positively impacting our treasury. Total costs are relatively fixed, and we do not expect much divergence from plan here. Anticipated revenue would fluctuate based on token price and whether or not we sell out 100 units as planned.\n\nTotal Costs: $20,500\\\nAnticipated Revenue: $24,000\\\nNet Contribution To Treasury: $3,500",

      "title": "FWB Cities - FWB Event Key Proposal ",
      "content": "FWB Cities - FWB Event Key _aka_ **FWB Key to your City**\n_Author: Greg Bresnitz_\n\n# Abstract\n\nCurrently FWB has 3 Cities subDAOs (LDN, NYC, LA), that currently oversee Governance + Programming and create consistent community events IRL. \n\nThere is building demand to open up more subDAOs but we do not want to prematurely scale if the market and processes are not in place to create consistent & meaningful events for the community. \n\nThe FWB Event Key program is a way to test various markets to see if we have an audience, leadership and growth opportunities all the while building in a consistent controlled manner.\n\nBy applying to get a FWB Event Key to a city, the applicant is agreeing to the Event Pattern Language while still having room to create something authentic and localized. \n\nAfter the first 10 events are completed, we will review each event & city to see what the best next steps will be and take it to the FWB community on how we want to grow.  \n\nThis proposal is requesting $35,250 USD as the inaugural FWB Cities Keys’ budget to distribute to across 10 event keys for Season 5.\n\n# Motivation\nWith the successful launch of the first three FWB Cities, the larger FWB community is asking “when city” for their local cities at an increasing rate. The goal is to empower more cities to participate in the FWB Cities program. \n\nEqually, we want to make sure that the community members have freedom to do different types of activities while the core FWB values and framing are consistently upheld. There are three main documents that need to be read and agreed upon before submitting.\n1. [FWB Manifesto](https://www.fwb.help/manifesto)\n2. [FWB Code of Conduct](https://github.com/friends-with-benefits/codeofconduct/blob/main/code.md)\n3. [FWB Cities - Event Pattern Language ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EamPvpq7cu4ItkyY_72tic1Jrldkh7Zj/view?usp=sharing)\n\n# Impact on FWB community \n\n* Expand to new cities without the cost full fledged city DAO\n* Creating the IRL events in new parts of the world\n* Recruiting tool for new members \n* Identify leaders\n\n# Specification\n## Overview\nThis proposal outlines the MVP of the FWB Event Key program to create a contained ten-event series for szn 5 to measure the success and prove the concept. \n## Discussion\nAs the FWB Cities subDAO expands, we are realizing there is a great desire from the community to host their own events. There needs to be a plan for other FWB Cities to participate in IRL programming. In true decentralized fashion, if we do not give a roadmap, people will build their own. \n\nOne issue with scaling events is keeping a cohesive vibe across events, with a bottle neck occurring at the approval phase. In order to circumvent those issues, we have written out a toolkit for FWB Event Key holders that ensures the events align with the FWB culture and vision.\n\nFWB Event Keys will not be fully fledged FWB parties that have exorbitant costs, but more along the lines of meetups, payable direct dinners, art crawls, etc things that are on the onus of the group to source. These will be trial runs where the main goal is more community building and less over the top event. \n## Budget \n* For szn 5: 10 FWB Event Keys in 10 new cities for 10 events. \n* Each FWB Event Key is worth $2,000 in $USDC\n* Community members awarded FWB Event Keys receive 5 $FWB\n* Community members awarded FWB Event Keys receive NFKey\n* Total cost of program: USD$35,250\n\nFor an itemised budget breakdown, including compensation for Event and Program coordinators, see the budget linked in the FWB Event Key Discord thread.\n\n## FWB Event Key Application + Criteria \n### Application judges\nPanel consisting of:\n* FWB Cities team members\n* 2 Community Members from each active FWB Cities\n\n### General \n\n* FWB Event Key Application can only come from existing FWB Cities Discord Channel\n* Submitted by FWB member, City or Full can apply\n* Multiple members can apply for one key\n* FWB Event Key will not be given to existing FWB Cities\n* One FWB Event Key will be awarded per city for MVP\n\n### Application \n\n* Name / Discord handle \n* City\n* Event Overview: Date, Location, Activity\n* Event Goals: What does success look like?\n* Attendance expectations\n* Relevant experience/qualifications\n\n## FWB Event Key Reporting \n\n* Event Name \n* City\n* Date \n* Flyer / POAP \n* Description / Type of Event  \n* Event Goals \n* Attendance \n* FWB Members / Non\n* 3 Things That Went Well\n* 3 Things Could Improve upon \n* Photos \n* Social Media Links + Media (if any)\n## Roadmap\n\nThis is a MVP for SZN 5 to see if this program can be successful. If a success - another proposal will be written and submitted to the community. \n\n1. By Jan 19th\n    1. Write FWB Cities Event Pattern Language \n    1. Create Airtable for Key applications\n    1. Design Key NFT or Token \n    1. Create FWB Event Key Report  \n    1. Develop Social Media Tools + Plan  \n    1.

      "title": "Proposal: FWBAMP",
      "content": "# Abstract\nFWBAMP is the way you consume digital events, Town Halls, and other FWB happenings after they have happened. You no longer need to show up in real time to catch all of the great interviews and content that FWB has to offer. FWBAMP will also act as a token gated entry point for outsiders to get a glimpse of all of the great content that FWB has to offer.\n\n# Motivation\nWe are inspired by and engaged in all of the great chats that happen daily in the FWB Discord, but we know that many members can’t join in real time. We need a way to streamline the process of consuming archived events. Currently, Adam and Zoë are manning the archive manually: recording using GarageBand (or Craig when available) and uploading to Google Drive, then pasting a link in a private Google Sheet, then pasting the link back on the Events page on Discord. \n\nWe are excited to make the first version of this product, and know that it will unlock future opportunities for revenue generation and increased community engagement.\n\n# Impact on FWB Community\nThis would benefit the FWB community by allowing more members to consume events that they may not be able to attend in real time. This may in turn increase community engagement. Want to get involved in the social-impact initiatives but haven’t been able to make it to any of their chats? No problem! Take a listen to the archived talks and decide if you want to dive in. Having an archive will ultimately enable FWB to replay shows at different times, repurpose great content into podcasts and get sponsors for these podcasts to generate revenue. There are also opportunities to give lower tier FWB holders access to the archives as an incentive to ante in at the local level or something similar. Finally, having things like the Product meetings and different governance meetings recorded will give us a **historical record of FWB** to look back on as we grow!\n\n# Details\n## Overview\nThe goal of the FWBAMP project is to automate the recording and storage of digital events, increase the quality of those recordings, and provide a great user facing experience for playback of those recordings. This proposal is for the first iteration, which is a bit more hands on, while we flesh out the technical requirements for a fully automated solution. There is also an aspect of this project that involves an archivist writing show notes for each event, and when we do this, we begin to build a historical record of FWB that can be revisited in perpetuity.\n\n1.  **Website**: We already have some mocks for this, but a sleek web interface that is searchable, filterable, and token-gated where people can go to look for archived shows is a must!  \n\n2.  **Uploading**: Uploading will be done using a CMS that Product is creating. Files will be uploaded to a central repository with the relevant metadata (date, name, show description). The user facing website will then point to these audio files and they will play in-browser.\n    \n3.  **Recording**: For the time being, we have a solution for this: using the new WireTap bot, show hosts will be able to record their shows. Adam and Zoe will continue to support as needed for recording as well, but the goal is to have this be a show host responsibility as soon as possible.  \n      \n4.  **Discord Integration**: In the events channel, or perhaps in a dedicated channel, would be great to automate the posting of links to recently archived shows.\n    \n5.  **Future State** *(Not currently in scope)*: As we scale, there will be a need for an automated workflow for recording all digital events taking place on the FWB Discord that are on the calendar. We should also make sure that members continue to be able to trigger recordings in real time for chats that aren’t prescheduled.\n\t- Make sure that the recording bot has all notifications muted in its user profile\n\t- Start recording 5 mins before and end 5 mins after each event.\n\t- Bonus points if we can figure out how to capture the video or screen share.\n    \n## Roadmap\n\n1.  Make the website. Even though we are working from google docs, if we could get the website going it would improve the community wide experience and it is pretty low hanging fruit. Website will also include a counter to give us deeper insights into listenership.\n    \n2.  Make the CMS. This will be the place that archivists and show hosts can upload recordings and edit the metadata that will display on the website.\n    \n3.  Hook website and CMS up to the new file storage solution.\n    \n4.  Optimize use of MEE6 (WireTap bot) for audio recording while we explore automation options for the future.\n\n## Outcomes and Success Measures\nLuckily it is pretty easy to measure success here. The first goalpost is to streamline the way to get events recorded and uploaded to a server. The second goalpost is to get the website up and running so that people can play things from the archive. We want to see that, with the archive site, listenership for discord events and town halls increases from that observed in real time. That spells success! Before we decide what to tackle next, we will see how people engage with this MVP and then start to build out more functionality.\n\n## Looking forward\nWe think that there are tons of things you could do with this in the future:\n-   Create RSS feeds of content for people\n-   Make a custom player where users can cue in the shows they want to catch up on\n-   Improved automation of recording and uploading\n-   Archiving other media types (videos, rich content from irl events, tl;dr, other editorial products).\n    \nThis archive project is just the first step toward getting a more dynamic events schedule in place. I think that you can use the analogy of college radio here. We could have a full program guide, maybe even 24/7 where people tune in and something is always on. The archive could be used to fill “dead air” and events can be replayed in those slots. There are other proposals floating around like FWB Radio, but that feels like just part of what this could be. We can have music programming, interview programming, current events shows, etc. Having an archive gives us a huge boost toward experimenting with other parts of this. We could open up show proposals more widely and build a full schedule of programming ultimately that showcases the interests of more FWBers and foster an even stronger sense of community. Digital events provide real time places for conversation and community building, but archiving, syndicating and distribution will allow sustained engagement and provide a historical record of how we grow as a community and how far we have come.\n\n## Budget\n**Budget is $19k**\n\n- **Design**: “Consider that part already done,” Bodge. $0\n- **Development**: Product estimates this phase to cost $10k to develop the CMS and website.\n- **Project Management**: Zoe (@zoenrogers#6096) will be in charge of project management and will take on half of the recording and uploading burden. ~ part-time, $1500/month. (Jan, Feb, March)\n- **Archivist**: Adam (@bartadamley#7554) will be in charge of writing show descriptions for each recorded event (Editorial) and will take on half of the recording and uploading burden. ~ part-time, $1500/month. (Jan, Feb, March)\n\n## Timeline\nWe have already unofficially started with this project in the world of google docs and google sheets, we should start making it better as soon as possible. We have the goal of getting the recording and uploading dialed in by end of Season 4/early Season 5. We hope to get the website and CMS up and running early in Season 5. We are targeting the end of March as the end of this project.",

      "title": "Proposal: FWB Gatekeeper",
      "content": "# Abstract\nEstablish FWB Gatekeeper as a dedicated flagship product within FWB’s ecosystem to expand its reach as a token-gated ticketing product. \n\n# Motivation\nGatekeeper makes it simple to create token-enabled experiences. \n\nGatekeeper has become a core tool both for FWB and for several partners during NFT NYC to run their own events. We now want to support the existing momentum behind Gatekeeper, establishing a dedicated team to take it to the next level. \n### Vision\nGatekeeper will create the tools for any community to facilitate access to token-enabled experiences, both physical and digital.\n\n### History\nGatekeeper is one of FWB’s first home grown products, born directly from the community in response to the lack of web3 native token-gated tooling. This product (Gatekeeper IRL) has largely been used internally at FWB, with a few partnerships done manually for NFT NYC. To date, Gatekeeper has recorded 6,400 RSVPs across 3 internal and 4 partner events in a span of 2 months. \n\nSince then, a small team has been working on a digital counterpart to the IRL product which we will call Gatekeeper URL. Gatekeeper URL will allow for token-enabled digital experiences and is set to launch by mid December 2021. Use case examples include ERC20 or ERC721 gated newsletters, articles, web experiences, and more. The core team working on this version is Gabe Q (PM and comms), Bodge, Iain and Breck (engineering), Gabe F (design), and Hendisco (advisor). Note: the initial scope and budget for the URL team has already been finalized with the product team through season 4 and does not affect this proposal. \n\n# Specification\n\n\n### Strategy and Roadmap\n##### Phase 1: Public Release of Gatekeeper \n_Timeline: January - February 2022_\n\nDuring this phase, we will release v1 of both Gatekeeper URL and IRL under one umbrella Gatekeeper brand. This means that anyone will be able to access a FWB-hosted Gatekeeper marketing site and either build a gated RSVP page and issue tickets for their IRL event OR use our admin panel and documentation to gate digital content (websites, docs, newsletters etc).\n\nThis release will coincide with an established v1 revenue model behind Gatekeeper.\n\n##### Phase 2: Staffing and Infrastructure \n_Timeline: Season 5-6_\n\nLearning from v1 product feedback, the Gatekeeper team will iterate on the product and revenue model released in Phase 1 (above). Together with the community, the Gatekeeper team will set the future product strategy, roadmap, and revenue model.\n\nGatekeeper will staff additional roles including designers, engineers, and sales / account managers. **If you’d like to contribute or apply, please reach out to contribute@fwb.help or DM Gabe Q.**\n\nGatekeeper will still lean on the FWB DAO infrastructure during this phase, tapping into benefits such as payroll, product resources, editorial etc. The Gatekeeper team will work closely with FWB leadership for the future expansion of this project.. \n\n##### Phase 3: Gatekeeper subDAO\n_Timeline: Season 7 onward_\n\nThe future Gatekeeper team will work toward establishing its own subDAO infrastructure and explore additional tokenization and incentive mechanisms to exist as its own stand alone entity.\n\nThrough this process, a portion of the Gatekeeper token supply will be owned by the FWB DAO.\n \n### Success Measures\nSuccess will be measured by the following objectives and results. \n\n##### Season 5: Create and launch the first public facing FWB product that anyone in the web3 space can use. \n* **Result 1:** Engineer a functional MVP of Gatekeeper URL (along with supporting documentation) by EOY 2021.\n* **Result 2:** Create a marketing site and public facing Gatekeeper IRL product. Have a live site in which users can access both Gatekeeper products by early Season 5. \n* **Result 3:** Write a launch post that explains what we are building and announces it publicly. Use that momentum to acquire 6 target DAOs or organizers within 30 days of launch. \n\n##### Season 6: Achieve community market fit with Gatekeeper\n* **Result 1:** Establish lean staffing budget and bring on additional contributors \n* **Result 2:** Grow RSVPs MoM by 20% from launch\n* **Result 3:** Launch v2 of Gatekeeper product based on iterations from previous launch and improve NPS. \n\n##### Season 7: Launch Gatekeeper sub-DAO\n* **Result 1:** Create future product roadmap and share publicly  \n* **Result 2:** Launch crowdfund of Gatekeeper sub-DAO  \n* **Result 3:** Establish legal frameworks needed to operate as a separate entity \n* **Result 4:** Airdrop tokens to FWB DAO, Gatekeeper team, and crowdfund participants and launch new discord to begin the standalone Gatekeeper sub-DAO. \n\n### Budget \nThe Gatekeeper team will cost ~ $26,000 monthly. Should this proposal be approved, the FWB treasury would support this burn rate for 6-9 months as we work through the three phases outlined above. After these months, the FWB DAO would receive a portion of the initial token allocation for the Gatekeeper subDAO. \n\nA detailed budget including roles and remuneration is available linked from the discussion thread for this proposal in the FWB discord.\n\nNote that this burn and budget do not take into account any revenue brought in by Gatekeeper or the future ownership that FWB DAO will have in the Gatekeeper subDAO. We expect this initial investment to incubate the team will pay off considerably. \n\n# Benefits\n* **Access:** As we saw at NFT NYC, FWB members got access to additional, quality experiences organized by other DAOS as Gatekeeper powered their events. We see a world where Gatekeeper becomes a widely used tool and FWB becomes the ultimate cultural membership that opens doors to numerous parallel experiences. \n* **Brand building:** Building open source tools for the larger web3 ecosystem builds the FWB brand reputation externally and attracts more members to our DAO. \n* **Revenue generation:** As Gatekeeper expands we will begin capturing on-chain revenue for the FWB treasury. The FWB DAO will also own a portion of the Gatekeeper subDAO. \n* **Opportunities for personal compensation:** Funding this team will create opportunities for builders and engineers within FWB to be compensated for building the future of Gatekeeper. \n\n# Considerations\n* A subDAO could create a subdivision of the FWB community.\n* Funding this team would increase FWBs current burn rate.",

      "content": "\n**Status:** Discussion, Round 2\n**Author:** Greg Bresnitz, Laura Jamarillo, Chuck Anderson, Alex Zhang, Yuri Rybak\n**Date:** December 14, 2021\n\n# Background:\nWe’ve collectively voted down the previous proposal around these benefits to focus on some granular distinctions flagged by the community. The following benefits are currently underway:\n\n## FWB Birds 3D Sculpture Raffle\n**Snapshot:** December 8, 2021 \nEight wallets will be randomly selected to receive first ever FWB Bird sculptures, mailed to an address of your choice.\n\n## FWB NFT Guest List Access\n**Snapshot:** January 1, 2021 \nHolders of all 8 during this Snapshot will receive 2022 green-list access to future FWB.art native edition & FWB curated drops. This access will primarily be delivered through the #NFT-General-Chat.\n\n*For clarity, ‘green-list’ is a synonym with ‘white-list’, a term we are trying to phase out due to its problematic connotations* \n\nThe subject of this proposal will be the nature of **NFT Channel Access** afforded 8/8 holders.\n\n# NFT Channel Access:\nThis vote is to determine the nature of access, granted to holders of all 8/8 [FWB.ART MIAMI NFTs](https://opensea.io/collection/fwb-art-miami-basel-2021), with specific regards to privileges within the #NFT-General-Chat. At this juncture, the community has discussed and concluded that all ‘8/8 holders’ should be granted access to this channel. The main issue currently under discussion is whether this access should be ‘Read Only’ or ‘Read & Write’ in nature. \n\n# Read Only Access: \n8/8 holders will be invited to participate in an onboarding process which will include a review of our code of conduct and conclude with a claimable erc-1155 token which will confer ‘Read Only Access’ to the #NFT-General-Chat. These holders will be able to drop emojis but will otherwise be unable to write in this channel. Access will be limited to the #NFT-General-Chat & #Alpha-Leaks channels, the latter of which is read only to the entire community by default. \n\n# Read & Write Access:\n8/8 holders will be invited to participate in an onboarding process which will include a review of our code of conduct and conclude with a claimable erc-1155 token which will confer unencumbered access to the #NFT-General-Chat. These holders will be able to fully participate in this channel just like any other member of FWB. Notably, this will include the permission to post messages and replies. Access will be limited to the #NFT-General-Chat & #Alpha-Leaks channels, the latter of which is read only to the entire community by default. \n\n# NFT Channel Access: \n**Snapshot:** January 1, 2022\n\n## ‘Read Only Access’ Benefits:\n‘Read Only Access’ seeks to maintain the current vibe of the #NFT-General-Chat.\n## ‘Read Only Access’ Drawbacks:\n‘Read Only Access’ is less aligned with the way these benefits were originally messaged\n‘Read Only Access’ creates tiers of participation that may adversely impact the nuanced dynamics of the #NFT-General-Chat\n## ‘Read & Write Access’ Benefits:\n‘Read & Write Access’ allows this group of holders to actively participate and contribute to the #NFT-General-Chat\n## ‘Read & Write Access’ Drawbacks:\n‘Read & Write Access’ has the potential to adversely impact token price in the short term\n\n \nVote:\n**‘Read Only Access’**, 8/8 holders will be invited to participate in the #NFT-General-Chat with ‘Read Only Access’. These holders will be able to drop emojis but will otherwise be unable to write in this channel.\n**‘Read & Write Access’**, 8/8 holders will be invited to participate in the #NFT-General-Chat with the same privileges as any other member of FWB.

      "content": "**Status:** In Progress _(Discussed in #live-proposals)_\n**Authors:** Jackson Dame & raihan_\n**Date:** December 16, 2021\n\n## Abstract\nRecently, a fun shitpost from FWB community member Jackson Dame evolved into crypto Twitter virality, with strong demand from that community for next steps. \n\nThis proposal is a response to continue that momentum by creating a temporary, fun, and partnered experience between these two internet groups.  \n\nHow we respond to unpredictable cultural moments as a community will define our community. \n\nKeep your Friends close; keep your Enemies closer. \n\n## Summary\nOn December 10th 2021, FWB community member Jackson Dame posted the following on Twitter ([link](https://twitter.com/jacksondame/status/1469489930426621958)): \n![A tweet from user @jacksondame reading \"starting a new social DAO called Enemies With Benefits, drop ur address\" dated December 10th 2021 at 6:11 pm sent from Twitter for iPhone](https://i.imgur.com/0plroNK.png)\n\nAs of December 12th 2021, the shitpost received over 4,000 addresses excited for an !airdrop.\n\nThe !airdrop participant list ranges from existing FWB members to friends of friends as well as other CT participants. \n\nIn the spirit of cooperation and belief that communities are stronger together, EWB would like to propose a collaboration with FWB by creating a temporary channel in the main FWB server to continue the party and act as a pop up community space for all those who responded to this cultural moment on the internet.\n\n## Details\n\nEligible EWB recipients will be those who responded to Jackson Dame’s tweet with a valid address from the windows of December 10th, 6:11pm PST to December 12, 6pm PST. \n\nEligible EWB recipients will receive a POAP designed and finalized by Jackson Dame.\n\nPer this proposal, holders of the EWB POAP will gain access to a temporary EWB channel inside of the FWB server. \n\nNo other FWB channels will be granted to EWB holders.   \n\nThe proposed channels will be: \n* #ewb-lobby (for wallet connection)\n* #ewb-gen-chat (general chat for all holders)\n\nTentative Channel Dates: 12/24/21-1/14/22. After channel dates are over, EWB + FWB moderators will decide based on activity and vibes if the channel should continue to exist by another proposal or to wind down the channel. \n\nFWB will create a subsection on the server and audit the onboarding flow to ensure a strong experience for existing FWB and EWB holders alike. FWB will also have a light touch of community management to make sure there aren’t any negative externalities or griefers within this subsection.\n\nThe joining process for the POAP route in a way that doesn’t disrupt the main FWB onboarding flow (cf. Collabland, applications, etc)\n\n## Impact on the Broader FWB Community:\nTo reiterate, EWB POAP holders will not have access to other FWB channels, only the two proposed temporary channels above for a defined period of time. \n\nExisting FWB holders will need to opt-in to the new role/channels by holding an EWB POAP.\n\nThe term “enemies”, while traditionally negative in connotation, is only tongue-in-cheek and does not imply any ill will or intent on behalf of the EWB community. Rather, Dame sees this as a fun and inclusive spinoff that would compliment FWB. That being said, EWB is currently a distributed group of several thousand people without a centralized meeting place or formally agreed upon principles. While Dame is currently leading EWB from a brand perspective, there is no formal governance or plans of action.\n\n## Budget: \nN/A, Any POAP creation/sales/funds will operate independently of FWB, unless decided otherwise by Dame.\n\n## Benefits\n* Respond to this cultural moment by being welcoming and inclusive vs. ignoring or dampening. \n* Introduce a couple thousand new participants to the FWB brand and potentially convert a swath of individuals to apply and join FWB\n* This movement is happening regardless, either FWB can participate in it and help steward it or ignore it which feels more risky.  \n* Demonstrate FWB doesn’t take itself _TOO_ seriously\n\n## Drawbacks\n* Potential negative unmoderated energy in the channels and opening “Pandora’s Box” with this experimental channel",

      "title": "FWB Treasury Diversification Proposal",
      "content": "# FWB Treasury Diversification\n \n \n**Authors:** Evan Fisher, Cooper Turley, Amit Mukherjee, Holyn Kanake\n\n\n## Summary\nAllocate 1.5M USDC from the FWB treasury into the aUSDC Aave Curve pool.\n\n## Abstract\nFWB has ~10M USDC in its treasury, which is meaningfully more than its monthly working capital needs ($427K in October and $338K in September).\n\nThis proposal looks to a) create a FWB vault on Enzyme Finance, and b) allocate $1.5M of the idle stablecoins to aUSDC in Aave Curve pools.\n\nEarnings from these saving instruments will be added to FWB treasury as working capital within approved departments and reinvested back into the DAO.\n\n## Motivation\nIdle stablecoins carry an opportunity cost. Optimizing the FWB capital structure would provide the community with additional financial resources to reinvest into the DAO.\n\nYield farming with Treasury funds demonstrates that FWB is active across the wider DeFi ecosystem, and provides confidence to members that funds are always being put to use in the best place possible.\n\nThis proposal aims to a) set up the infrastructure needed to invest stablecoins and, b) set an initial investment strategy for the community.\n\nBased on current APYs, the recommended allocation in this proposal is expected to generate an additional ~$120K of USDC over the next year.\n\nIt is recommended that the community re-evaluates its investment allocations and strategy as APYs shift and new protocols emerge.\n\nWe believe in community governance, and we hope this sets the precedent for future proposals to continue deploying the FWB treasury.\n\n## Specifications\nIf successful, this proposal will allow the Gnosis Multisig operators to establish a FWB vault on Enzyme. Enzyme is non-custodial, decentralized asset management infrastructure. The platform gives access to a range of DeFi products in one place, which simplifies tracking of assets and performance reporting to the community. Through the newly created vault, the multisig can execute treasury management strategies on behalf of the DAO. Any adjustment of allocations beyond this proposal must be voted on by the community.\n\nAdditionally, if successful, this proposal will allocate $1.5M of stablecoins to the Aave Curve pool within Enzyme. Aave is a non-custodial protocol to borrow and lend assets with stable or variable interest rates. The current APY on its USDC pool is 7.5-8%.\n\n## Benefits\n- Create an additional source of cash to the DAO to fund operations\n- Improve capital efficiency of treasury (idle USDC has an opportunity cost)\n- Demonstrate FWB’s leadership in DAO resource management\n- Set up infrastructure and process for additional treasury diversification proposals\n\n## Considerations\n- Smart contract failure risk (Mitigant: All protocols used have been audited and are supported by a strong investor base)\n- Working capital management (Mitigant: $8.5M of USDC remaining in FWB’s Gnosis will cover 1-2 years of runway)\n- Operational security (Mitigant: Control remains with the multisig)\n\n## Vote\n- Yes - Approve proposed treasury diversification plan\n- No - Do not approve\n",

The minting portals (wheatpasted artworks) were distributed around the city with a specific QR code to unlock access to an NFT mint with limited edition pieces. This project was designed to bridge the gap between FWB’s IRL events and their emerging NFT initiatives.\n\nThe following artists have reimagined the FWB birds:\n\n- Domingo Beta (Medellín, Colombia)\n- Harm van den Dorpel (Berlin, Germany)\n- Huntrezz Janos (Los Angeles and Budapest) \n- Liz Meyer (New York, USA) \n- Nic Hamilton (Australia)\n- Shawna X (New York)\n- Simon Denny (Auckland, New Zealand) \n- Zombie Zoo Keeper (Tokyo, Japan)\n\n## NFT Collection Benefits:\nThe following Benefits for holding all 8/8 FWB.ART NFTs will unlock in multi-weekly intervals, tracked by who is holding 8 at the time of the recurring Snapshots.\n \n \n### FWB Birds 3D Sculpture Raffle\nSnapshot: December 8, 2021 \nEight wallets will be randomly selected to receive first ever FWB Bird sculptures, mailed to an address of your choice. \n\n\n### FWB NFT Guest List Access\nSnapshot: December 15, 2021 \nHolders of all 8 at this Snapshot period will receive annual guest list access to future FWB.ART native edition based drops. That wallet address attached to the Snapshot will be the one listed.\n\n\n### NFT Channel Access \nSnapshot: January 1, 2022\nREAD ONLY for 2022. Holders of all 8 NFT at the time of the Snapshot will be granted Discord access to the NFT General Chat & Alpha Leaks Channels. Given they are read-only, they will not need to apply through the membership committee. They will need to agree to our terms and conditions. This access will be tied to a non-transferrable claimable ERC-1155 token.\n\n\n \n## Project Statistics: \n(2:53pm EST 12/7)\nTotal Master Set Holders: 110\nMaster Set Holders NOT already in the community: 65  https://gist.github.com/mannynotfound/3f0bfd9920fd7bf6c6db83813783a283 \nTotal FWB Payout: 32.23500 ETH \nTotal Artist Payout Each: 8.05875 ETH \nPublic Sales Total: 2144/2216 (97%) \n \n \n## Benefits:\n- Begin to experiment with meaningful perks that tie FWB.ART projects with the larger FWB ecosystem\n- By granting roughly 65 non-Members read-only access to a set of NFT channels for one season, we can introduce them to our community that may lead to potential future good fits, conversion, and membership.  \n- We make good on the commitment made to the buyers and maintain reputation\n\n## Drawbacks:\n\n- Allocating read only access to our NFT channels may introduce nuanced, negative community sentiment within FWB NFT community\n\n",

This includes support of the final development steps for the program submission and voting portal, artist stipends, three new shows per month (FAiR Artist Talks), the end of season “Residency Release Party”, and general program coordination.\n\n## Impact on broader FWB community:\nThe Friends with Benefits Artists in Residence (FAiR) program will provide both short term and long term positive impact on the FWB community.  In FWB Season 5, the FAiR program will strengthen FWB’s position as the ultimate cultural membership by giving community members the opportunity to select artists and fund their living expenses, allowing them to focus on creating.\n\nThe FAiR program will also add value for community members in the form of live shows held three times each month, where each resident will join the FAiR Content Host to discuss how their art and their process is intersecting with Web3, answer questions from the community, or speak about whatever subject matter they’re most passionate about.  The three-month residency will culminate in a live “Residency Release Party”, where artists will share their work with the rest of FWB.\n\nIn the long term, the FAiR program will help FWB position itself as a hub for culture and creativity.  With the addition of the #artist-residency-alum channel, past, present, and future FAiR alum will be able to connect.  As FWB becomes a space known for facilitating new partnerships, friendships, and interdisciplinary collaborations, the community will become even more attractive to the growing Web3 creator class.\n\n## Details:\nMore details about the FAiR program can be found in the [long form proposal document here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UUQBSZdFogbVDkCxzrPU9O3y2mFKsSweCWE_MGv9xEo/edit?usp=sharing ).\n\nProgram application and voting ballot forthcoming.\n\nFor this pilot season of FAiR, applications will only be open to current FWB members.\n\n## Timeline: \nThe dates provided in the document below outline the important deadlines that we must meet in order to welcome the first cohort of residents alongside the start of FWB Season 5.\n\n[The timeline may be viewed here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gDszgr3zeiN5cB06RgGFNZgKMVA6xwUjs7b0Dzwhvs8/edit) \n\n## FAiR Team Roles and Responsibilities:\nThe roles listed below are initially filled by the FAiR Hackathon team members to ensure the smooth roll-out of the FAiR program.  In future seasons, these roles may look different, and be filled by other community members who are passionate about improving the program. Any shared roles will split their funding allocation seen in the budget section of this proposal.\n\nA full list of roles can be found in the [long form proposal document here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UUQBSZdFogbVDkCxzrPU9O3y2mFKsSweCWE_MGv9xEo/edit?usp=sharing )\n\n## Budget\n###One Time FAiR Set Up Costs \n\n| **Expense** | **Detail** | **Cost-USDC** | **Total USDC** |\n------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------\n| Dev Team | Application / Voting site | 2,000 | 2,000 | \n\n### FAiR Cohort #1 ( FWB Season 5) Monthly Funding \n\n| **Expense** | **Detail** | **Cost-USDC** | **Total USDC** |\n------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------\n| Living Expenses | Artist 1 | 2000 | 2000 | \n| Living Expenses | Artist 2 | 2000 | 2000 | \n| Living Expenses | Artist 3 | 2000 | 2000 | \n| **** | **TOTAL** | **6000** | **6000** |\n\n| **Expense** | **Detail** | **Cost-USDC** | **Total USDC** |\n------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------\n| Staff Role | Program Lead | 1800 | 1800 | \n| Staff Role | Content Host | 1800 | 1800 | \n| Staff Role | Technical Lead | 1800 | 1800 | \n| **** | **TOTAL** | **5600** | **5600** |\n\n### Cost Summary FAiR Season 5 \n\n| **Set Up** | **January** | **February** | **March** | **TOTAL** |\n------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------\n| $2000 | $11,400 | $11,400 | $11,400 | $36,200 | \n\nA full budget overview, ideal outcomes, future ideas, and a summary can be found in the long form proposal document here. \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1UUQBSZdFogbVDkCxzrPU9O3y2mFKsSweCWE_MGv9xEo/edit?usp=sharing ",

      "title": "FWB x Taika Partnership Proposal: Club Mate but make it Web3",
      "content": "## Abstract \nThis proposal will approve and fund the working process to create and promote a new mate beverage alongside our friends at Taika. FWB will purchase a number of cases of the new product and receive a profit share on all cases sold. \n\n## Motivation \nAfter years of buying club mate by the case, we thought it was time to make our own. Not only is a FWB spin on club mate well aligned with our community (from Discord to dance floor), creating a physical product will allow us to build the playbook for DAO x physical product collaborations going forward. \n\n## Details \n[Taika](https://taika.co/about/) is an innovative beverage company with a special brand and ethos. First focused on coffee, the team has recently expanded into Matcha. Taika beverages are ready to drink, adaptogen-infused, and focus on the “destination” i.e. how the drinks make you feel. \n\nWithin this partnership, Taika will be responsible for the food science (R&D), production, logistics, and co-marketing efforts. We will lean on their expertise to develop, source, price, and deliver the beverage.  \n\nFWB will be responsible for co creating the design and marketing efforts around the launch. In order for us to leverage this opportunity, we will be coordinating the launch across multiple platforms (in-person, social, thought leadership etc.) and will be determining that in tandem with Taika and the nominated working group. \n\nAs an FWB member, you will have two avenues through which you can get involved with this partnership. You will be able to either:\n\n- Apply to be part of a paid **working group**. This will be a smaller group of more active contributors creating designs and marketing collateral. \n\n- OR opt-in to a volunteer **focus group** which will be equally significant. As part of the focus group, you will commit less time to the project but still participate in product tastings, providing direction on taste and feel of the beverage. You will also vote on the work created by the working group, having a say in the end product design, marketing etc. \n\n## Benefits for the FWB community\n- **Brand building:** We expect to create a cultural \"moment\" through this initiative, further elevating FWB as a pioneer in the space. This will  generate more cultural capital for members of the community and FWB at large.\n- **Financial:** Generate financial returns from a product partnership. \nStrategic: Develop a blueprint for future product collaborations (e.g. apparel). \n- **Internal Value:** Create a product which will be available to FWB members and at gatherings.\n- **Internal Opportunity Value:** Create more opportunities for FWB members to creatively contribute and benefit financially to internal and external projects.\n\n## Terms\nThis will not be a standard partnership in which FWB charges Taika a fee for our involvement. Instead, the partnership will be set up on a profit share agreement. The initial goal will be to produce two runs of the beverage, a pilot and first production run. \n\n[Here is a financial model with an overview of the financials of the partnership.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PyGfxf0-vj4tUquBvk0ONL3KtsH2i2zpmLA53S9_820/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## Budget \nBeyond the terms above, this project will establish a compensation pool allocated for the working group. There will be a total of $10,000 available for working group members which will be allocated by each individual’s scope on the project. This cost will be split 50/50, with both Taika and FWB contributing $5,000. \n\nBetween FWBs contribution to the compensation pool as well as our purchases of the product and shipping costs, this partnership will require an investment of $18,530 from the DAO. \n\n## Revenue\nWith this investment, FWB will acquire ~495 cases of the beverage at cost that we can resell at FWB events and experiences (should we decide to do so).  We will also earn an 18% profit share on Taika’s subsequent sales of the beverage. Therefore, we expect this investment to generate a return as we sell the beverage and produce additional runs.  \n\n## Success Measurement\nWe will measure the efficacy of this partnership using the same categories listed in the benefits section above. The success of this collaboration will be determined by:\n- Attracting meaningful media and social attention to our drop and partnerships strategy \n- Generating a financial return that at least offsets our initial investment \n- Defining a playbook for physical product collaborations that we can reproduce \n- Creating paid working opportunities for FWB members to contribute \n- Providing a novel and fun experience for any FWB members who participate in the co-creation of the beverage.   \n## Timeline\nUpon approval this partnership would launch immediately and continue into Season 5. \n",

      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal asks the Friends With Benefits community to ratify the Code of Conduct that has been iterated and refined through dialogue with the community over the past few months.\n\n## Abstract\n\nAs part of a commitment to continuous improvement and evolution, and recognition of the FWB community’s increasing complexity, discussion regarding establishing a simple and flexible code of conduct for the community arose during Season 3. In particular, isolated incidents of unwelcome communication and misdirected attention-seeking in public channels sparked discussion about how to codify the examples of positive community engagement and set guardrails for minimizing situations where members are put into uncomfortable scenarios.\n\nOver the course of several months, a self-started committee of FWB members drafted the Code of Conduct, soliciting opinions from members experienced in community management both online and offline. An initial draft of the Code of Conduct was then opened for community comments via Google Docs, and a Town Hall meeting was held to discuss some of the commentary. \n\nComments regarding clarifying language and the moderation process were incorporated. Where possible, concerns voiced by members of the community who prefer looser guidelines were heard and incorporated as best possible.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe purpose of the Code of Conduct is to provide a simple and flexible framework for ensuring that every member of FWB has a positive experience interacting with their fellow community members. The Code of Conduct is meant to encompass both digital interactions and those that increasingly take place in the physical world, as FWB continues to expand its footprint.\n\nCare was taken to write rules that are open-ended enough to preserve the character of the community without sanitizing its countercultural streak while maintaining with firmness that certain types of behavior have no place whatsoever in our community.\n\n## Outcomes\n\nIf ratified, this proposal will lead to the adoption of the Code of Conduct by the FWB community. The [full text of the FWB Code of Conduct is available here](https://github.com/friends-with-benefits/codeofconduct/blob/main/code.md) and is being released under CC0-1.0 license for use by other Web3 communities to help reinforce their community’s values.\n\n## Vote\n\nSelect from one of the two options below:\n",

      "title": "Proposal: FWB Partnerships Team",
      "content": "**Author:** Gabe Quintela \n\n## Abstract\nWe propose establishing an FWB Partnerships team dedicated to designing & managing strategic relationships with third-party communities & brands in order to drive value for FWB members as well as FWB’s treasury. \n\n## Motivation\nWe’ve seen a significant opportunity for partnerships at FWB, demonstrated by the volume of community recommendations, inbound interest, and experiences that we’ve already been able to produce with partners.\n\nFormalizing an FWB Partnerships team would allow us to operationalize the interest we’re receiving from third parties while further exploring the unique benefits that we can create for FWB members through creative partnerships.\n\n## Strategy\nOur highest priority with any partnership will always be to provide value to members while protecting the brand & culture of FWB. Therefore, we view revenue as a trailing indicator. A reward that occurs when we partner with those who do right by our community.  \n\nWith that perspective in mind, the partnership team will oversee three partnership activation programs:\n\n- **Cultural Activations** - partner with brands for co-utility. No upfront cash, focused on utility, experience, and brand building. \n- **Access** - FWB members will receive exclusive/early access or discounts to products and services. Most likely activated at the FWB channel level (i.e., skincare, mental health, food, gaming etc.).\n- **Revenue Driving** - partners pay FWB to co-create valuable opportunities for FWB members.\n\n\n## Existing Pipeline\nTo demonstrate the opportunity behind activating an FWB partnerships team, our (thus far part-time & volunteer) team has already developed a strong pipeline of 9 potential deals for a possible $600,000+ of new revenue. An overview of the deals in the pipeline, including a community-facing proposal for each, is available for FWB members upon request. Please contact Gabe Q.#2254 on Discord for more information. \n\n## Budget\nThis proposal is for the FWB treasury to fund a FWB Partnerships team for two seasons (4 and 5). The monthly burn rate will be $16,900. This burn includes legal fees for structuring contracts on specific partnerships as well as a small travel & entertainment budget for negotiating deals. However, this burn rate doesn’t take into account the offsetting revenue that partnerships can and will bring in. While revenue is not the priority with these deals, we expect to more than offset monthly burn with revenue-generating partnerships. \n \nThe Season 4 budget would be back paid to contributors for work done thus far. [Full budget breakdown can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m7Xr2FSr1hmn6U-77mWSx9UXoVWkpGkkBNZcNEdhGbI/edit). \n\n## Outcomes and Success Measures \nThe nuance in determining what success looks like for our team is that we are not treating revenue as the leading priority in our partnerships. While many of the partnerships that we do will bring revenue to FWB, we hope to be a bit different from a traditional partnerships team in that we are equally interested in brand building, and providing unique experiences to our community. \n\nTherefore, we will be measuring success via the following objectives and results:\n\n#### Objective 1: Achieve (at least) breakeven, offsetting team cost with new partnership revenue by end of Season 5. \n- Result: Secure at least $55,000 in partnership revenue in season 5. \n- Result: Keep team burn below incoming revenue in season 5.\n\n#### Objective 2: Generate access to novel experiences for the FWB community \n- Result: Secure partnerships that create at least 3 new experiences (IRL events, dinners, pop-ups, digital programming etc) that FWB members can access per season.\n\n#### Objective 3: Create new opportunities for FWB members to be compensated for their creative work \n- Result: Secure at least 2 partnerships per season that generate working opportunities for FWB members to be paid for engaging with said partner. \n\n#### Objective 4: Establish FWB as a thought leader on what DAO partnerships can look like \n- Result: FWB is referenced in at least 2 organic press pieces for unique partnerships that we create. \n\n## Benefits \n- Provides exclusive opportunities & benefits to FWB members.\n- Drives revenue to grow & improve our operations.\n- Co-creates opportunities to support the creative class.\n- FWB further cements its position as a thought leader by co-creating first of their kind programs and activations.\n\n## Drawbacks\n- In some cases partnerships will place additional demand on FWB team leads’ time, at an opportunity cost of internal projects.\n- Partnering with different brands could subject FWB to potential PR mishaps or other issues that may arise on the partner’s side.\n",

      "title": "Proposal: FWB NFT",
      "content": "**Author:** Nic H, Raihan, Yuri, Alex Zhang, Cooper Turley, Metasebia Yoseph, Brian Mark\n**Date:** 11/12/21\n \n## Abstract:\nThe FWB NFT General Chat is a dynamic space for lively conversation about digital art in Web3. This proposal will establish a team to build on this conversation and develop an NFT program to serve the FWB community and beyond. \n \n## Purpose:\n\nFWB believes that NFTs offer a meaningful opportunity to experiment at the intersection of creation, curation, and commerce. The FWB NFT Team will provide a curatorial perspective and elevate NFT culture.\n\n## Mission:\n \nFWB NFT will focus on creating tools, services, and opportunities for members to navigate this emerging territory while pushing the boundary forward on quality artistic experiences.\n \n## Strategy:\n\n#### 1. Custom Tools\n\nFWB NFT will evolve the NFT category to create better architecture and resource pools for artists, while increasing accessibility to the NFT space. \n\nFWB will prioritize a Web3 Open Source software approach, similar to that of Redhat, MongoDB, and Discourse with revenue derived from hosting and support as a service. \n\n#### 2. FWB Curatorial Team \n\nFWB Curatorial Team will be platform agnostic, giving us flexibility while allowing us to capture value across realms.  The FWB Curatorial Team will also steward the [FWB Gallery](https://gallery.fwb.help/) as one of the go-to-market options for artists. \n \nThe FWB NFT Team will prioritize diverse voices through three primary outlets. A) The Curatorial team will feature two curators to start, selected by the FWB DAO, that will be balanced in gender, race, and perspective. These roles will have an annual term limit, with ability to renew upon community vote if other candidates should choose to campaign. B) The FWB Curatorial team will form an Advisory Board featuring more diverse voices for contributors who may not have the time to curate but whose input, perspective, and background would be of value. C) The FWB Curatorial team will establish a process by which anyone in the community can submit curatorial projects for review by the community and the Curatorial Team. \n\nThis department will be one of FWB NFT’s primary revenue lines through ownership percentages or percentage fees of NFT projects that are auctioned, commissioned, or sold. FWB NFT would aim to take anywhere from 1 - 10% with possibility to scale higher depending on level of involvement.\n \n## Plan / Process:\n \n#### Phase 1: Staffing and Infrastructure | 6 MONTHS - 1 YEAR\n\nFWB DAO to establish an initial FWB NFT workstream led by two functions: \n \n(1) Operations \n(2) Curatorial \n\nOperations will drive day to day ops of the FWB NFT department, help execute NFT projects, build access points for the community to contribute, lead development of FWB NFT tooling, and manage processes and payroll.\n \nCuratorial will be responsible for curating NFT projects, managing the FWB Gallery, collaborating with future NFT investing functions, and interfacing with artists and creators within FWB.\n \nFor Phase 1, this department will work within the FWB DAO and with its current leadership to utilize operational processes such as payroll, KPIs, goals, and other FWB DAO resources such as Product Team and Editorial Team. \n \nThe FWB DAO will work with active stakeholders and community members in #nft-general-chat to staff the team for the first term and then will transition to elected upon roles once the roadmap is established.  If you’d like to contribute or apply, please reach out to contribute@fwb.help.\n \n#### Phase 2: $FWB-NFT DAO + Token\nThe future FWB NFT Team will work toward establishing its own DAO infrastructure and explore additional tokenization and incentive mechanisms to exist as its own stand alone entity, with a portion of the total supply being owned by the FWB DAO.\n \n## Budget:\nFWB DAO to fund FWB NFT for one year of runway.\n \nProposed Year 1 staffing budget is 250,000 USDC which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fRuQSO2FCChqWT2tEAUw6phDw3grocRFrFOaRayfTEk/edit?usp=sharing), at a monthly burn rate of $20,833. Team members have the ability to receive compensation in FWB or USDC but for budgeting processes, we budget in USDC. \n \n## Benefits:\n \n- Capitalize and support an existing sub community of highly engaged NFT collectors, artists and builders within the FWB ranks. \n- Creates more inclusive opportunities for FWB members at large to participate in the NFT discussion.\n- Generate meaningful on-chain revenue through the commissioning and auctioning of NFT projects. \n\n## Drawbacks:\n \n- Creates fragmentation of community efforts\n- Not a good current allocation of funding \n",

      "title": "Proposal: FWB Local",
      "content": "**Status:** Pending\n**Author:** Alex Zhang\n**Date:** 9/28/21\n\n# Summary\n\nCombine FWB Events and FWB Cities into a new 5 $FWB tier called FWB Local.\n \nThis tier aims to capture qualified inbound interest and drive high quality engagement into our newest initiatives (Events and Cities), while fostering diversity by broadening accessibility for potential new members.\n \nA link out to the full proposal may be found here: [Proposal: FWB Local](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gyU0XTfiWLKq2WZ1g9pbMNEITZkzO2plkcJchMatQHM/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe long-term sustainability of the FWB community and the $FWB token relies on our ability to diversify our token-gated products and access points. \n \nAt the start of every Season, the community votes to increase the threshold by a certain tier, as seen here. Given that the current price of the $FWB token makes the cost of membership prohibitive for many, we are proposing this new diversification strategy to introduce alternative onramps. \n \nBy introducing a more accessible tier for FWB Events and Cities, we will open a new gateway for people to experience the community before making the leap to our current core membership threshold of 75 $FWB.\n\n\n# Specifications\n\nIntroducing FWB Local as a new token tier at 5 $FWB to engage members in FWB Events and Cities\n \nFurther discussion will be had with newly elected City team leadership to determine if specific events will require membership application approval or not. \n \n# Events\n \n **IRL Events**:\n-   FWB DAO organized meetups, parties, events, conferences, and physical experiences shouldn’t be limited to just those who hold 75 $FWB and would benefit all around from more diversity of participants. \n \n-   FWB Events serve as a more ideal onramp to help bring in new members by interacting and participating in local community experiences. \n \n-   Events will strive to operate at a breakeven business model through either pooling of capital through city community members, sponsorship subsidy, or additional forms of revenue. \n \n**Digital Events**:\n\n-   Digital Events also serve as another great access point for members at the Local level. Digital events include Coffee Time, Seed Club’s talk, and many more educational experiences that occur on the FWB Discord. This will also grant access to the FWB chat-text channels that run alongside digital programming but only if they are qualified members via application approval. \n\n# Cities\n \nFWB has established three Cities— London, New York, and Los Angeles —as the originating sub-DAOs within the FWB ecosystem. \n \nCities will host in-person experiences from happy hours, gallery tours, and listening parties to local partnerships with restaurants and pop-up community meeting spaces. We believe the strongest onramp into FWB is through participating in local community and governance. \n \nFWB Local will grant access to all FWB #city-channels.\n \n# Channel Architecture\n \nThe Local threshold tier will include, but not limited to, the following channels within the Discord: \n \n**Welcome Category**\n-   Announcements\n-   Welcome\n-   Get-Involved\n-   All Cities General Chat\n \n**Cities**\n\nFWB CITY DAOS / FWB LA\n-   la-general\n-   la-events\n\nFWB CITY DAOS / FWB NYC\n-   nyc-general\n-   nyc-events\n\nFWB CITY DAOS / FWB LONDON\n-   ldn-general\n-   ldn-events\n\nFWB CITIES*\n-   BERLIN \n-   MIAMI\n-   SF\n-   ETC\n \n \n*These singular city channels will expand out once official CityDAO infrastructure is rolled out upon enough demand and expressed leadership. \n \n# Benefits:\n-   Drives engagement into our FWB City channels, which is our core Season 4 focus.\n-   Improving diversity and quantity of desired members,\n-   Lowering financial barriers to participate in events and IRL experiences. \n# Drawbacks:\n-   Huge surge of new applicants and need to staff up the membership committee to handle applications.  \n-   Potentially introducing a two tier class system into FWB.\n-   A sense of FOMO for those who hold 5 and can’t afford 75.\n\n# Season 3 POAP Claim\n\nAnd to all those who were along for the ride for Season 3, and to thank you for voting on this proposal, claim your official Season 3 POAP after you submit your vote.   \n\nS3’s POAP was designed by artist, designer, and creative Eric Hu in anticipation of his upcoming generative NFT series dropping October 7th, in which FWB members have been automatically registered in the presale.

      "content": "# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish the FWB Fellowship Trust.\n\nDeeper discussion around this proposal can be found in the #temp-fellowships channel on Discord.\n\n\n# Abstract\n\nTo help preserve our future as the intersection of culture and crypto, the Membership Team seeks to establish the FWB Fellowship Trust, locking in place a substantial number of tokens to ensure that despite a fluctuating token price, creatives, people of color, the underserved/under-represented, women, and LGBTQ(+) will have access to FWB to launch their respective journeys into web3. \n\nTo foster community involvement in the future disbursement of these fellowships, a companion proposal will be presented that includes a mechanism for community donations, community voting, and the ability to personally sponsor future FWB members for Fellowships.\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nFWB originated from a place of creativity and discovery. Artists, writers, musicians, thinkers, and dreamers have been at the very heart of our community’s growth since its inception.\n\nTo ensure that FWB remains a space that is diverse and where creativity and innovation can flourish, the Membership team is proposing that the FWB community establishes a trust to lock up tokens to preserve fellowships for the next two to three years. This allows FWB to remain true to its stated mission, and a home for all without any concern of financial barriers to entry.\n\nMany artists have limited resources when embarking on their careers, and as the FWB token price increases it becomes more challenging for them to onboard.\n\nFurther, preserving a vesting trust of tokens to welcome diverse creatives as members will help to assure that FWB remains a place we all want to continue to contribute to.\n\nIt is of utmost importance that the vibrant fabric of this community continues in the same spirit of its founders.\n\n\n# Specifications\n\nAllocate the allotted number of $FWB tokens to a [4/7 Gnosis Safe multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xAdaa224be0779aF13C3820F67a8FF28E894A917F/balances) governed by:\n\n-Pat Lok\n-Patti Hauseman\n-Alex Zhang\n-Cooper Turley\n-Jose Mejia\n-Alex Hooven\n-Jake McEvoy (Kid Hastings)\n\nAll distributions of tokens will come from the Fellowship Treasury.\n\nThese multisig signers were selected based on their involvement in forming this initiative, with a majority rotating out every two seasons to ensure new Membership Committee members have a chance to participate in Fellowships. \n\nAt the one year mark, the Host Committee will have the option to call for a vote by FWB DAO members as to whether the Fellowships program will proceed on its existing course, or is placed on hold with the remaining token trust returned to the FWB Treasury.\n\n\n\n# Benefits:\n\nLeans into the founding mission of FWB\n\nDiverse Community\n\nEnsures Creativity \n\n# Drawbacks:\n\nTokens may be needed for other community initiatives\n\n\n# Vote\n\nChoose to allocate 18,000 $FWB to the FWB Trust. Tokens will be used over the course of 24 months, correlating to ~21 grants per season or 180 total grants at an average threshold 100 FWB tokens or take no action.\n\nYes - Allocate 18,000 $FWB tokens to the Trust\nNo - Take No Action\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We are proposing a shift toward budgeting in USD value, and then allowing contributors to decide their payment in mixed USDC + FWB. This simplifies the budgeting process and should allow for increased stability and better accuracy calculating our future spends.\n\n# Benefits\n\n- Continuity in compensation for contributors\n- Clarity in budgeting for FWB\n- Additional stability in FWB budgeting\n\n# Drawbacks\n- $FWB is native token of the community.\n- Less $FWB compensation is less ‘skin in the game’ for contributors\n\n# Vote\n\nYes - Approve new Team Compensation structure and approve September budget\nNo - Do not Approve new Team Compensation structure and approve September budget",

We expect this proposal to widen the breadth of where members can contribute, and allocate sufficient budget towards more time and energy invested into FWB.\n\nViewing FWB as a digital city, **this proposal is our way of growing its suburbs.**\n\n## Specification\n\nSwap 100,000 FWB from the FWB DAO (fwbdao.eth) for 10,000,000 USDC as detailed below. \n\n**Logistics**\n\nToken Price: 100 USDC/FWB\nAmount Swapped: 10,000,000 USDC\nTotal FWB: 100,000 (10% of total supply)\n\n**Partners**\n\na16z (@cdixon) - 50,000 FWB\nPace Capital (@fakepixels) - 19,000 FWB\nKindred Ventures (@stevejang) - 15,000 FWB\nSpark Capital (@bwats) - 15,000 FWB\nLi Jin (@ljin18) - 1,000 FWB\n\nThis allocation breakdown was discussed over the last few weeks between staff and corresponding points of contact at these funds - leading to an optimal incentive for collaboration from all parties.\n\n**Vesting**\n\nAll FWB swapped in this proposal will be subject to a four year vest with a one year cliff.\n\n**This means the full amount will be liquid at the end of four years from the passing of this proposal.**\n\nAt the one year cliff, 25,000 FWB (25%) will unlock, followed by 6,250 FWB (6.25%) each quarter for the remaining three years.\n\n**Breakdown**\n\nAll USDC will be sent directly to the FWB treasury (fwbdao.eth).\n\nThe community will look to facilitate a private allocation in which whitelisted members can participate in a bespoke offering.\n\nGiven the fluctuation in FWB, the exact breakdown of the Community Swap will be finalized within two weeks of the passing of this proposal.\n\n**Delegation**\n\nParticipating firms will delegate 50% of their votes to empower more distributed voting from members.\n\nThese votes will be delegated to either FWB Fellows or to Team Leads.\n\nWe will work closely with these partners to sort out delegation preferences and ensure that all funds are allocated to suitable candidates.\n\n**Closing Thoughts**\n\nThis proposal marks a pivotal moment for FWB.\n\nAs we extend this offering to the community, we etch into the fabric of society a model in which a community of internet strangers can come together to redefine the way in which we curate and fund culture.\n\nTo those who have been with us since day one, let this blood oath mark the beginning of a sector-defining chapter.\n\nGrab your snacks, and let your voice be heard.\n\nWAGMI.",

Actual spend was the USD equivalent of $86,000 based on the July 28th token value.\n\n- **Areas of overage:**\n**Membership:** The membership contributor pool was inadvertently excluded from the August budget.\n**Membership:** A missed payment for the Team Lead from June. \n**Events:** A new initiative to explore future IRL events for FWB members. \n**Product:** An invoice from an outside partner paid on an irregular schedule.\n\n-   Moving forward a new protocol will be in place working closely with the team leads and community to deliver a more accurate budget estimate.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAugust’s actual expenses add up to 2,515 FWB and $46,646 USDC. According to the FWB Pro price as of August 28, this is $449,994. \n\n**Important to note:** At the end of July when the August budget was created $FWB was trading for $15.82 per token. The discrepancy in the USD equivalent total is due to the token increasing in value at an unanticipated rate. Over the next few months we aim to build more reliable budget models relying on USDC as the core compensation for full time and part time contributors. \n\n\n# Vote\n\nYes - Distribute July actual expenses and approve August budget\nNo - Do not distribute July actual expenses and do not approve August budget",

      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to ratify the amount of FWB tokens required to access Friends with Benefits for Season Three.\n\nDeeper discussion around this proposal can be found in the #governance channel on Discord.\n\n## Abstract\n\nGoing into our third Season, Friends with Benefits has now gone through two iterations of raising the price to join by 5 FWB.\n\nThe original level to join Friends with Benefits was 50 FWB. This means every member held at least 50 FWB to access the token-permissioned Discord.\n\nSeason One was 55 FWB.\n\nSeason Two was 60 FWB.\n\nThis proposal looks to ratify the access level for Season Three - starting in early July.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFour different options have been presented below. The goal of this proposal should be to assess how much (if at all) the membership access should change heading into Season Three.\n\nIncreased thresholds had the positive effect of requiring inactive members to top up their balance to retain membership. Historically, the most active members have earned more FWB than the increased threshold through SoucreCred, events or committees - meaning those typically affected by the change were inactive members.\n\nThis proposal looks to explore wider steps between the new membership threshold, with the intent to create more demand for FWB by requiring new and inactive members to obtain more FWB to join.\n\nAs outlined in the Evolution of FWB DAO, Season Three will provide the most opportunities to earn FWB to date, meaning all active members should have no issues retaining membership and growing their stake within the community.\n\n## Specification\n\nDecide between the following options for Season 3 membership access.\n\n*60 FWB (+0)*\n\nNo change. Keep the membership at the same level as Season Two.\n\n*65 FWB (+5)*\n\nSame change. Increase membership by the same amount as the past two Seasons.\n\n*75 FWB (+15)*\n\nExplore a slightly larger step to drive demand among the existing community from inactive members. \n\n*100 FWB (+40)*\n\nExplore a large step to create meaningful demand for FWB from most members for the start of Season 3.\n\n## Benefits\n\n- Higher membership thresholds encourages more demand for FWB while requiring a higher degree of skin in the game.\n- More circulating supply is being retained by active members of the community, rather than by speculators.\n- Establish a precedent for membership thresholds to be decided each Season through governance, rather than programmatically at a fixed rate.\n\n## Drawbacks\n\n- Larger expenditures from members to remain a part of the community.\n- Certain members may have to purchase additional tokens if they’ve not earned enough from SourceCred, events and committees.\n- High likelihood of a dropoff of inactive members not aware of the change in membership access.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal looks to cover retroactive expenses for April as well as a monthly budget for May to the various working groups in the FWB community.\n\n## Abstract\n\nProvide the following compensation to various FWB contributors. \n\n**April Expenses Actuals | (Retroactive)**\n\n- FWB Onboarding Explainer Video (2) - 100 FWB \n- Events & Programming (14) - 515 FWB\n- Host Committee (12) - 600 FWB\n- SourceCred Reimbursement (1)  - 815 FWB\n- February + March Coffee Time Reimbursement (2) - 900 FWB\n- Friends.With.Rats Vault Reimbursement (1) - 0.5 ETH\n- Gas Reimbursement (3) - 11.5 ETH\n\n**May Expenses Budgeted | (Recurring Operating Expenses)**\n\n- Governance Committee (3) - 150 FWB\n- Scholarships (3) - 180 FWB\n- Events & Programming (14) - 565 FWB\n- Host Committee (12) - 600 FWB\n- Operations Lead (1) - 7500 USDC\n\nIn total, this proposal looks to allocate **4425 FWB, 7500 USDC and 12 ETH to 32 unique FWB contributors.**\n\nThe number listed next to each bucket defines the amount of contributors the allocations will be shared between.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFWB should continually empower those actively contributing to the community by going above and beyond participation in Discord.\n\nEach of the line items described above is being applied retroactively, meaning all of the recipients of these allocations are based on past work already done for the community.\n\nMoving forward, FWB should expect to vote on a monthly budget allocation at the beginning of each month - used to reimburse and compensate those for work from the month prior.\n\nSince the treasury has diversification, FWB has access to a diverse pool of assets best used to engage and align core contributors.\n\nSpecific items - like committees - are expected to be a recurring allocation until stated otherwise.\n\n## Specification\n\n**Distribute 4425 FWB, 7500 USDC and 12 ETH to 32 unique FWB contributors.**\n\nThe breakdown of the various allocations is summarized as follows: \n\n**Host Committee (12) - 600 FWB (monthly)**\n\nThe host committee contains 12 FWB members who filter, review, and approve all applicants in FWB. Additionally, the host committee are FWB’s eyes and ears for welcoming new community members, helping anyone with technical or wallet connecting issues, and also ensuring FWB is a fun and inclusive space. \n\n**Events & Program Hosts (14) - 515 FWB (monthly)**\n\nOver the last month, we’ve experimented with a series of FWB Clubs & Talks, from MAX PAIN, a weekly jam on market recaps and convictions with a degenerate/optimistic stock investor lens to FOOD WITH BEVERAGE, weekly culinary show educating members on the art behind food. We’d like to continue to empower hosts to bring ideas, experiment, try programmatic concepts within the Discord and outside the Discord. This FWB is the monthly reward for over 15 hosts and DJs to thank them for their support.\n\n**Gas Reimbursement (3) - 11.5 ETH (one time)**\n\nEthereum gas is expensive. These costs are an aggregate of all transactions used to deploy FWB Pro contracts, distribute the airdrop, set up Gnosis Safe multisigs for Treasury Diversification and distribute SourceCred rewards. A full breakdown of these transactions will be shared in the Discord.\n\n**Friends.With.Rats Vault Reimbursement (1) - 0.5 ETH**\n\nDistributed to the Friends.With.Rats for deployment costs of the FWA Vault.\n\n**SourceCred Distribution (1)  - 815 FWB (one time)**\n\nReimbursement to Staff for the Season One’s FWB Pro SoureCred distributions. This allocation is expected to be budgeted once per season.\n\n**February + March Coffee Time Reimbursement (2) - 900 FWB**\n\nReimbursement to the Coffee Time crew for hosting budget and allocations distributed to guests. Moving forward, Coffee Time allocations will be slotted into the “Events & Programming” bucket.\n\n**FWB Onboarding Explainer Video (2) - 100 FWB** \n\nAllocated to two community members for producing an FWB explainer video to ease with FWB onboarding, expected to go live in the coming weeks.\n\n**Governance Committee (3) - 150 FWB (monthly)**\n\nOur newest committee, the Governance committee, will help build the governance roadmap that governs the FWB community. Made up of partial staff and partial members, the Governance committee will review proposals, craft proposals (like this one), educate members and enhance a sense of citizenry. Only non-staff members will earn a recurring FWB allocation.\n\n**Staff Salaries (1) - 7500 USDC**\n\nStarting May 1st, FWB will be bringing on a full time staff member to lead product development, community engagement, and overall strategy in collaboration with existing staff, the various committees, and the DAO at large as we mature from 7 part time vigilantes into a fully functioning team with a community driven roadmap that we can execute against.\n\nThe candidate filling that role is zhang - @alexxzzhang who’s been advising the FWB Staff for the last 2 months and comes from over 7 years in community building experiences. Most notably for the last 4 years, he was the Creative Director, President, and a Partner at Summit, a community company that hosted global events around the world for a community of 20,000 people as well as owners of Powder Mountain, a crowd funded ski resort development project. More about him here: alexzhang.world\n\n## Benefits\n\n- Compensate core contributors for ongoing work to the community\n- Create a cadence for monthly budget allocations\n- Utilize the community treasury to further activate committee members and key contributors\n- Utilize DAO treasury management tools like Llama and Parcel to keep track of monthly outflows\n\n## Drawbacks\n\n- This specific breakdown buckets together many expenses into one proposal. Moving forward, FWB will look to categorize expenses more granularly and look to limit the number of miscellaneous expenses.\nGas reimbursements are priced in ETH, which has appreciated in value since the time of the transactions\n- Gnosis Safe currently does not support multisender transactions, requiring the usage of new platforms and/or manual Metamask distributions. \n\n## Vote\n\nYes - Distribute FWB April Expenses and Approve May Budget\nNo - Do not distribute FWB April Expenses and Do Not Approve May Budget\n",

      "content": "## Summary\n\nSwap 10,000 FWB (1% of the total supply) in exchange for 3,500 WHALE directly to and from each respective community treasury.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal looks to further diversify the FWB community treasury by swapping FWB tokens for a leading social token - WHALE. More information on the project can be found at whale.me.\n\nThe proposed amount was earmarked as a $100k swap as of March 19th. FWB is earmarked at $10/token while WHALE is earmarked at $28.50/token.\n\nWHALE is the social token underpinning Whaleshark Pro and the WHALE Vault.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Whale Vault is estimated to have ~$50M worth of assets and over 10k Discord members.\n\n**Whaleshark has approved the swap, and the final decision to proceed rests in the hands of the FWB community.**\n\n## Motivation\n\nSocial token communities offer overlap and parallels that are best shared in collaboration with one another.\n\nThe WHALE community has long been seen as a leader in the space, thanks in high part to the key role WhaleShark Pro has played in creating a high-value NFT Vault governed by the WHALE social token.\n\nThis proposal sets a precedent for FWB to be a curator in the wider social token community, looking to acquire and partner with communities growing the sector in good faith.\n\nWhaleshark has become a prolific member of the crypto community, and even stepped up to support FWB in its time of need as a liquidity provider. He is now active in the FWB Discord, along with numerous other members of the WHALE community.\n\nThis proposal starts simply as a swap of tokens, and allows the two communities to work in collaboration with one another to explore partner programs and channels in each other's communities.\n\n## Specification\n\nAllow the community treasury - fwbdao.eth - to transfer 10,000 FWB directly to the WHALE Vault - 0xE7079Eec020DDfC3F1c0abe1D946C55E6Ed30eB3 - in exchange for 3,500 WHALE.\n\nThis is estimated to be 1% of the total FWB supply, or 3.5% of the community treasury.\n\nFWB will not be subject to an enforced vesting contract, but will be held under the social contract that each community will hold the tokens in their treasury or distribute them to community members.\n\nThis proposal puts full faith in the WHALE community to hold and use FWB in a productive and value-added manner.\n\n## Benefits\n\n- Diversify the treasury with a leading social token - WHALE\n- Show strong alignment with the WHALE community\n- Open a door to explore cross-coordination with a market leader.\n- Put ~$100k worth of WHALE in the FWB DAO.\n\n## Drawbacks\n\n- Allocate FWB at below market value.\n- Swapped tokens will not have any enforced vesting.\n\n## Vote\n\n- Yes: Swap 10k FWB for 3.5k WHALE\n- No: Do not swap FWB for WHALE",

      "content": "## Summary\n\nExchange 7% of the FWB Pro supply to strategic partners in exchange for $700k USD. \n\nAll tokens will be transferred directly to and from the community treasury. \n\n## Abstract\n\nFriends with Benefits is looking to expand its team of core contributors heading into Season Two. \n\nWe propose exchanging 7% of FWB Pro, or ~21.4% of the community treasury, in exchange for a mix of ETH and USDC from strategic partners including leading crypto investors and builders. \n\n**FWB Pro is slotted at a spot price of $10/token with one year vesting schedule.**\n\nTokens are subject to a six month cliff, followed by six month vesting. This means half of the allocation unlocks at six months from the passing of this proposal, while the remaining half unlocks monthly for the remaining six months when the cliff is reached.\n\nThe community treasury will be used to empower contributors in a more formal capacity and be used to build out deeper community tooling.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe community treasury - fwbdao.eth - currently holds ~35% of the FWB supply. While this treasury is great on paper, it’s important that contributors be paid in tokens other than FWB.\n\nDiversifying the treasury with exogenous assets such as ETH and USDC allows Friends with Benefits to be more flexible in the partners it engages — without having to worry about exchanging FWB on the open market.\n\nThis exchange also welcomes the most respected web3 funds into FWB’s orbit, a strong signal in alignment with the FWB community and social tokens as a whole.\n\nAll funds have agreed to the amounts and terms described in this proposal, should the community agree to move forward with the exchange.\n\n## Specification\n\nAllow the staff to facilitate exchanges with each of the following funds directly from the community treasury.\n\n- Divergence\n- Variant \n- Collab+Currency\n- Nascent \n- GPs of Polychain\n- The LAO\n- MetaCartel Ventures\n- Galaxy Interactive\n\nMany of these investors are already active members of the FWB community including @cjliu49, @jessewldn, @delitzer, @pridesai and @galaxyRTK. This exchange looks to bring additional investors into the fold and carve out a pocket for their expertise to be shared with the FWB community.\n\nEach of the above groups is contributing between $50k-$100k.\n\nThe staff will create a Gnosis Safe multisig to act as an escrow for each allocation. FWB Pro will be transferred to the escrow wallets to enforce vesting, and all partners will send their allocation directly to the treasury - fwbdao.eth - should the proposal pass.\n\nAll distributions will come directly from the community treasury.\n\nThis proposal will run for 72 hours. All discussions around the proposal will be held in the #governance channel in the FWB Discord.\n\n## Benefits\n\n- Seed working capital for community contributions\n- Align FWB Pro with the strongest partners in the web3 space\n- Be a leader in DAO treasury management for social communities\n\n## Drawbacks\n\n- Exchange a sizable portion of the community treasury (21.4%)\n- Shorter vesting schedule (1 year) to account for nascent nature of social tokens\n\n## Vote\n\n**Yes - Distribute 7% for $700k**\n**No - Do not exchange tokens**",
