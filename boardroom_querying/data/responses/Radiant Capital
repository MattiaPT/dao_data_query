      "title": "RFP-46: Accelerating RDNT Vesting to Boost Emissions Reserve and RIZ APRs",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks to accelerate the vesting schedule for 200 million RDNT tokens allocated to the Emissions Reserve, reducing the vesting period from three years to two. This change is intended to increase token emissions to support higher APRs and attract additional liquidity to Radiant Innovation Zone (RIZ) markets. By providing more competitive APRs, this adjustment seeks to expand liquidity and drive the growth of RIZ across multiple chains.\n\n## Motivation\n\n### v3 Update\n\nSince Radiant’s expansion to Base on July 31, 2024, the protocol has introduced 10 v3 RIZ isolated market collaterals, in addition to the 32 blue chip and stablecoin collaterals already available across Arbitrum, Base, Ethereum, and BNB Chain.\n\n-   v2 launched on Base  as the fourth supported blockchain (July 31, 2024).\n    \n-   v3 RIZ isolated markets  went live on Arbitrum with ZRO, rsETH, and ezETH (September 13, 2024).\n    \n-   v3 RIZ isolated markets launched on Base with ZRO, AERO, and MAVIA (August 26, 2024).\n    \n-   PT-wstETH was added to RIZ on Arbitrum (August 30, 2024).\n    \n-   GMX, gmARB, and USDY were added to RIZ on Arbitrum (September 5, 2024).\n    \n-   As of this writing, v3 RIZ deployment to BNB Chain is imminent.\n    \n\n### v3 Impact\n\nBefore examining the impact of the initial v3 feature pack, led by the RIZ isolated markets, it's important to note that the v2 expansion to Base delivered significant returns, making Base the top Radiant chain with 48% of global TVL ($124.77M of $260.65M) within just 5 weeks, peaking on September 10, 2024.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdi1y7lklB59G0PJ4QNndpaYOPEuQR37hQnPJHgYupoQ7M1JOx3nMUK4OTuv_hVtOYRoVy137cA0T261b9r5ikXlnLmhi5qau1rR9nObcWRtvFMgBZTZG--3tR-KUespBE5rCiw25n5ETvlFSKg6PnR6KEV?key=MlBaMj45L-jF4Q3rH1w7ug)\n\nv3 launched on Arbitrum on August 13, 2024 (ZRO, rsETH, ezETH), followed by Base two weeks later on August 26, 2024 (ZRO, AERO, MAVIA). Additional RIZ collaterals were introduced on Arbitrum over the next two weeks (PT-wstETH added on August 10, 2024; GMX gmARB and USDY added on September 5, 2024).\n\nWith just a modest set of 10 RIZ collaterals gradually introduced over a 4-week period, the global TVL peaked at $266 million, up from $223 million pre-v3 (RIZ). This represents an increase of $43 million (+19.3%).\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcw0fAx19UQvJx5NXPXMXOUhNgu8tp-1eeF0HuUgZHMmjgpWOocMKJKfy30jfwBtC00jZCrIXJ0-YQogjGawT_MpwuACl0KPjVWfmCfD9zGCo7X0yBhMH3CoDkX5xG01ooF-4hWvrEiroMdYMv8nCBX6Ufa?key=MlBaMj45L-jF4Q3rH1w7ug)\n\n### Adapting to Market Conditions\n\nThe current vesting schedule for RDNT tokens was designed when the token price was $0.30. However, as of this proposal, the price has dropped to $0.072 for various reasons, including the overall market downtrend. This decline has had a direct impact on emissions APRs, making them less competitive and reducing Radiant’s ability to attract liquidity. The Radiant Innovation Zone (RIZ), which was launched to provide high-risk, high-reward isolated markets for trending altcoins, relies heavily on competitive APRs to attract users and liquidity.\n\n  \n\nThe introduction of RIZ markets has shown early promise, with notable growth in Total Value Locked (TVL). However, the suppressed APRs have led to stagnation in growth. As the RIZ markets aim to expand further, both in the number of collaterals and across additional chains, maintaining attractive APRs is crucial for customer acquisition. Accelerating the vesting schedule of RDNT tokens to the Emissions Reserve would provide a boost in emissions, helping to stabilize and grow APRs, which in turn supports liquidity depth and the overall success of RIZ.\n\n  \n\nThis adjustment aligns with feedback from the community and is intended to ensure that the protocol can remain competitive in the current market environment.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n-   Furo Stream: A linear vesting stream mechanism used to distribute RDNT tokens over time, managed through smart contracts.\n    \n-   Radiant Innovation Zone (RIZ): A series of isolated markets launched by Radiant to support altcoins and high-risk assets, aiming to attract liquidity by offering competitive APRs.\n    \n\n## Specifications\n\n1.  **Current Vesting Schedule**: Under [RFP-33](https://l.radiant.capital/RFP33), 40% of the 500 million newly minted RDNT tokens (200 million tokens) were allocated to the Emissions Reserve with a three-year linear vesting schedule, set to conclude on May 22, 2027. These tokens were intended to support APRs for future chain launches and Radiant Innovation Zone (RIZ) initiatives.\n    \n\n  \n\n2.  **Proposed Adjustment**: This proposal seeks to modify the vesting schedule for the 200 million tokens allocated to the Emissions Reserve, shortening the vesting period from three years to two years. The vesting will now conclude on May 22, 2026.\n    \n\n  \n\n3.  **Emission Impact**: By accelerating the vesting, an additional 66.6 million tokens (one-third of the total allocated to the Emissions Reserve) will be made available during the second year. This is expected to raise emissions to the RIZ markets, improving APRs and enhancing the protocol’s ability to attract liquidity.\n    \n\n  \n\n4.  **Total Allocation**: The acceleration of the vesting will not affect the overall allocation of RDNT tokens. The 200 million tokens earmarked for the Emissions Reserve will remain unchanged, and both vesting streams—60% to the DAO Reserve and 40% to the Emissions Reserve—will now conclude on the same date, May 22, 2026.\n    \n\n  \n\n5.  **Dilution Consideration**: The acceleration of emissions will result in more tokens entering circulation earlier than initially planned. This may have a dilutive effect on the RDNT token price, but it is expected that the increase in APRs will counteract this by attracting more liquidity to the protocol.\n    \n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n1.  **Modification of Vesting Stream**: Within 7 days of proposal ratification, the existing three-year linear vesting stream for the 200 million RDNT tokens allocated to the Emissions Reserve will be modified to a two-year linear vesting schedule. This will require updating the Furo stream to reflect a new end date of May 22, 2026.\n    \n2.  **Notification of Change**: Once the vesting schedule is updated, a community notification will be issued within 24 hours, informing all DAO members of the change.\n    \n3.  **Documentation Update**: Within 14 days of proposal ratification, relevant public-facing documents, including the tokenomics overview, FAQ, and any associated governance resources, will be updated to reflect the new vesting schedule.\n\n\n4.  **Emissions Adjustment**: The emissions rate to the RIZ markets and associated vaults will be adjusted as necessary to align with the newly accelerated vesting schedule. This adjustment will ensure that APRs remain competitive but sustainable, given the increased availability of tokens.\n    \n\n## Timeline\n\n-  **Proposal Ratification**: The proposal will take effect immediately upon successful ratification through governance voting.\n\n-   **Modification of Vesting Stream**: The  adjustment to the vesting schedule will be completed within 7 days of ratification. This will involve modifying the Furo stream to reflect the new vesting end date of May 22, 2026.\n    \n\n-   **Community Notification**: A notification regarding the vesting modification will be issued within 24 hours after the vesting stream is updated.\n\n\n-   **Documentation Update**: All relevant public-facing documentation, including tokenomics information and FAQs, will be updated within 14 days of proposal ratification to ensure consistency and transparency.\n    \n\n\n-  **Emissions Adjustment**: Emissions to RIZ markets and vaults will be adjusted within 14 days of ratification, aligning with the accelerated vesting schedule to ensure sustainable yet competitive APRs.\n    \n\n## Overall Cost/Impact\n\nThis proposal does not require additional budget allocation, as it leverages the existing RDNT token supply that was previously minted and allocated under RFP-33. The modification to the vesting schedule will primarily affect the timing of token emissions, rather than introducing new costs to the protocol.\n\n### Operational Impact\n\nIncludes minor adjustments to the vesting stream and updates to public-facing documentation, which fall within the scope of existing development and communication resources. No new hires or services are required to implement this proposal.\n\n### Market Impact\n\nThe accelerated vesting schedule will result in more RDNT tokens being emitted over a shorter period. While this may increase the circulating supply, the improved APRs and potential growth in liquidity from RIZ markets are expected to provide positive incentives for token demand, supporting the protocol’s overall market positioning.\n\n## Voting\n\n**In Favor**: Support the implementation of RFP-46, agreeing with the proposed changes to accelerate the vesting schedule of RDNT tokens to the Emissions Reserve from three years to two years, with the goal of enhancing APRs and liquidity in RIZ markets.\n\n**Against**: Oppose the implementation of RFP-46, rejecting the proposed changes to the RDNT vesting schedule.\n\n**Abstain**: Undecided, but contributing to quorum.",

      "content": "## Abstract\n\nRFP-45 proposes integrating cbBTC (Coinbase Bitcoin wrapper) as a full collateral and borrow market within Radiant Capital's Base deployment.\n\n## Motivation\n\nRadiant Capital aims to provide a decentralized platform for lending and borrowing cryptocurrencies, offering users an efficient and secure means to access financing and generate yields. As the DeFi market evolves, expanding the platform's offerings by incorporating new, high-quality assets as collateral and borrowing options is essential.\n\nThis new asset will diversify the options available for Bitcoin holders looking to participate in DeFi activities on Radiant. Introducing cbBTC to Radiant will give users more choices for utilizing their Bitcoin holdings, increasing liquidity and engagement within the protocol.\n\nThis governance proposal seeks approval to integrate cbBTC as an accepted form of collateral and as a borrowing market within Radiant Capital's Base deployment. This expansion aligns with Radiant Capital's vision of offering its users a comprehensive and diverse set of assets.\n\n\n\n## Key Terms\n\n-   **cbBTC** - Coinbase wrapped Bitcoin\n    \n-   **Max LTV** - The Maximum LTV ratio represents the maximum borrowing power of a specific collateral. For example, if a collateral has an LTV of 75%, the user can borrow up to 0.75 worth of ETH in the principal currency for every 1 ETH worth of collateral.\n    \n-   **Liquidation Threshold** - This represents the threshold at which a borrow position will be considered undercollateralized and subject to liquidation for each collateral. For example, if a collateral has a liquidation threshold of 80%, it means that the position will be liquidated when the debt value is worth 80% of the collateral value.\n    \n\n## Specifications\n\n-   Add cbBTC as a full collateral and borrow market on Base\n    \n-   Chaos Labs will provide risk parameters as soon as possible.\n    \n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n-   **Chainlink Integration**: To list cbBTC, a Chainlink feed for cbBTC must be integrated. This feed will provide accurate, real-time data for the cbBTC token.\n    \n-   **Smart Contract Implementation**: Based on the defined parameters, the Radiant team will implement the necessary updates to enable the integration of cbBTC as a collateral and borrow market. This implementation will involve coding and testing the smart contracts to ensure their functionality and security.\n    \n-   **User Interface Update**: The Radiant Capital user interface will be updated to reflect the addition of cbBTC as a collateral and borrow market. This includes providing users with the option to select cbBTC as collateral and borrow assets and displaying relevant information such as cbBTC exchange rates, available loan options, and associated risks.\n    \n\n## Overall Cost/Impact\n\nMinimal.\n\n## Timeline\n\nIntegration is expected to occur swiftly, subject to the following stages:\n\n-   Local Testing: The Radiant team will conduct thorough testing of the implementation in a local environment to ensure its functionality, security, and compatibility within the Base ecosystem.\n    \n-   Staging: Following Chainlink Feed integration, the implementation will proceed to a staging phase, where further testing will verify the integrity and functionality of the cbBTC collateral and borrow market.\n    \n\n## Voting\n\n-   **In Favor**: Supportive of RFP-45, adding cbBTC to the Base deployment of Radiant\n    \n-   **Against**: Against implementation of the RFP-45 proposal\n    \n-   **Abstain**: Undecided, but contributing to quorum",

      "title": "RFP-44: Strategic Adjustment to Emission Schedule from RFP-35",
      "content": "## **Abstract**\n\nThis proposal builds on the objectives outlined in [RFP-33](https://dao.radiant.capital/\\#/proposal/0x1045e5e770599ac2ed44b727e4c47e8a0b13589082dcac138f8edde3bd86e249), which focused on adjusting the RDNT token supply and included a plan to distribute additional emissions to dLP lockers to incentivize long-term commitment. While [RFP-35](https://dao.radiant.capital/\\#/proposal/0x24b1f54270c005d3a4fea1cd755cea8435d2f6bf6d14135423b5d2a9cc9448f5), was intended to outline the mechanics of this airdrop, RFP-44 refines and amends the approach, addressing logistical challenges in tracking cross-chain dLP compositions and introducing a more robust mechanism for emission distribution, forfeiture management, and reward streaming.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nTo achieve the goal set in RFP-33 of allocating 25% of the newly-minted token supply to dLP lockers, this proposal refines the distribution strategy originally introduced in RFP-35. It implements a chain-agnostic approach to tracking locked RDNT and introduces a weekly rebalance and streaming mechanism to ensure fair and continuous emissions distribution.\n\nRFP-35 initially set a linear emission schedule for distributing the earmarked **125,000,000 RDNT** over **two years** to eligible dLP lockers. However, due to differences in dLP composition across Radiant’s supported chains, this amendment proposes moving away from using qLP as the basis for distribution. Instead, it seeks to reference the total amount of locked RDNT in a user’s cross-chain portfolio (**qRDNT**) as the new metric for determining airdrop allocation.\n\nAdditionally, a 24-hour grace period will be introduced for users to relock expired dLP positions, allowing them to maintain their qRDNT before forfeiture is applied.\n\n**Errata Notice:** It should be noted that a line in RFP-33, stating \"50% of all DAO Reserve tokens will be vesting linearly over two years,\" was a typographical error carried over from an earlier RFP draft. The correct allocation for the anti-dilution airdrop remains as 125 million RDNT, representing 41.667% of the total 300 million DAO Reserve tokens. This clarification aligns with the consistent public communication regarding the 125 million RDNT allocation across RFP-33 and both iterations of RFP-35.\n\n**Key Terms**\n\n* **qRDNT (Qualifying RDNT)**: Total RDNT within a user's locked dLP positions across supported chains.\n\n* **Initial Snapshot**: A record taken three months (90 days) post-ratification of RFP-35 and after initial successful workflow checks, capturing the total RDNT in each user's locked dLP positions to determine qRDNT. Initial snapshot date is set for **2024-09-05 0000 GMT**, pending successful testing.\n\n## **Specifications**\n\n1. **Incentivization Structure**: RDNT allocated to dLP lockers will be distributed over two years (104 weeks). The distribution amounts will be recalculated weekly based on each user's proportional qRDNT. These rewards will be streamed weekly, with each stream vesting over a 90-day period to promote continuous engagement and reduce the risk of large-scale sell-offs.\n\n2. **dLP → qRDNT Conversion**: At the time of the initial snapshot, each user's total RDNT locked in dLP positions across all supported chains will determine their qRDNT. This amount will either stay constant or decrease, depending on whether the user unlocks any portion of their dLP.\n\n3. **Weekly Rebalance**: A cross-chain DuneSQL query will run every week to calculate the total qRDNT held by all users. If any user’s dLP has expired or been withdrawn, reducing their qRDNT, the forfeited proportion will be redistributed among the remaining qRDNT holders for the next weekly cycle.\n\n4. **24-Hour Grace Period**: When a user's locked dLP position expires, they will have a 24-hour grace period to relock their dLP. If the dLP is not relocked within this period, the associated RDNT will be forfeited and deducted from the user's qRDNT calculation for the following week’s distribution. Note that this grace period is only relevant when a user has the `auto-relock` option disabled in the **dLP Overview** section of the [Manage Radiant](https://app.radiant.capital/#/manage-radiant) tab. Enabling `auto-relock` will prevent any unintended forfeitures due to early exits.\n\n5. **Streaming Rewards**: The reward distributions will use Merkle streaming, with no fee, facilitated through Angle. Users will receive **mtwRDNT**, which, upon claiming, gets burnt, and the equivalent RDNT is vested over a 90-day period. The qRDNT query will run on a weekly schedule and be available via an API endpoint. The DAO multisig will utilize the JSON output from this query to fund the weekly Angle campaign.\n\n6. **User Interface**: The Radiant app will be updated to show qRDNT balances, alert users about upcoming relock deadlines, and provide clear information about how weekly rebalances affect their reward entitlements.\n\n## **Steps to Implement**\n\n### **Initial Setup & Launch**:\n\n1. Conduct the **initial snapshot** once the following checks have been passed:\n\n   * Three months (90d) post-ratification of [RFP-35 (Resubmission)](https://dao.radiant.capital/\\#/proposal/0x24b1f54270c005d3a4fea1cd755cea8435d2f6bf6d14135423b5d2a9cc9448f5).\n\n   * Successful end-to-end testing of the entire workflow that integrates the SQL query, API endpoint, DAO multisig execution, and the Angle streaming mechanism.\n\n### **System Development**:\n\n* **Backend**: Implement the necessary infrastructure to automate the tracking of qRDNT, manage weekly balance recalculations, and interface with the Angle streaming system for distributing rewards. Surface an API endpoint via Dune Analytics to run the weekly qRDNT query.\n\n* **Frontend**: Update the Radiant app's user interface to display qRDNT balances, notify users about relock opportunities, and visualize changes in rewards resulting from weekly rebalances.\n\n## **Timeline**\n\nInitial snapshot date is set for **2024-09-05 0000 UTC**, pending successful testing, with weekly distributions to follow over the subsequent 104 week period.\n\n## **Overall Cost/Impact**\n\nThere will be no additional costs beyond Radiant's regular operational expenses, as the implementation will use existing resources and infrastructure to maintain cost-efficiency.\n\n## **Voting**\n\n**In Favor**: Support the implementation of RFP-44, agreeing with the proposed changes to establish a dynamic emission schedule based on qRDNT and the updated mechanisms for reward distribution.\n\n**Against**: Oppose the implementation of RFP-44, rejecting the proposed changes.\n\n**Abstain**: Undecided, but contributing to quorum.",

      "title": "RFP-43: Formal Retirement of Radiant v1",
      "content": "## Abstract\nThe Radiant v1 lending protocol was launched on Arbitrum in July 2022. With the introduction of v2 on March 18, 2023, we initiated a transition process for users to seamlessly migrate from v1 to v2. During this transition, v1 continued to operate without support, allowing users sufficient time to fully vest their RDNT and assess v2's performance and stability without penalties.\n\nInitially, a definitive sunset date for v1 was not set in order to facilitate a smooth and thoughtful transition. This RFP proposes to formalize the closure of v1 and submit the plan to the DAO for ratification.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal to discontinue v1 is motivated by the following factors:\n\n1. **Successful migration to v2**: Since its launch in March 2023, Radiant v2 has effectively transitioned the user base from v1. The market size of v1 has decreased significantly, from $328 million to just $0.59 million, representing a reduction to 0.18% of its original size. This indicates that 99.82% of v1 positions have either migrated to v2 or have been resolved. As a result, there are currently zero balances in Pool2 and RDNT staking contracts.\n\n2. **Resource Optimization**: Retiring v1 enables Radiant to reallocate operational and maintenance resources towards more active and growth-oriented initiatives. \n\nBy discontinuing v1, this proposal aims to streamline Radiant’s operations and concentrate efforts on developing and enhancing functionalities that deliver greater impact and value to our users.\n\n## Steps to Implement & Timeline\n\n1. **Proposal ratification (T+0)**: Initial announcement of the decision to deprecate v1 on Arbitrum to the Radiant community.\n\n2. **+2 weeks (T+2w)**: **Cease funding for the 1:1 RDNT migration contract.** Beyond this point, migration of v1 RDNT v1 tokens to v2 RDNT using the Radiant app’s migration wizard will not be possible once the contract is fully depleted.\n3. **+2 weeks (T+4w)**: **Restrict the money market operations.** After an additional two weeks from above, restrict money market operations to withdrawals only, discontinuing any new deposits. Send monthly reminders to facilitate reducing the total money market to zero.\n4. **+2 weeks (T+6w)**: **Disable v1 accessibility via the frontend interface.** Any subsequent withdrawals will need to be executed directly through smart contracts.\n5. **+4 weeks (T+10w)**: **Officially sunset v1 contracts.** Ten weeks from ratification. Any remaining deposits and borrows will be liquidated with a 15% fee, in line with the existing [liquidation policy](https://docs.radiant.capital/radiant/project-info/borrow/liquidations).\n\n## Overall Cost/Impact\n\n### User Impact\nThe impact on users is expected to be minimal as 99.8% of the v1 market has already transitioned to v2.\n\n### System Impact\nThere will be no adverse effects on the current v2 dApp as a result of sunsetting v1.\n\n### Cost\nCost outlay associated with this transition is minimal, primarily encompassing internal resources allocated for communication and necessary technical updates. Additionally, there is potential upside, as resources will no longer be required to perpetually fund the v1 migration contract.\n\n## Voting\n**In Favor**: In support of RFP-43, agreeing with the decision to sunset v1 on Arbitrum, as described above.\n\n**Against**: In opposition of RFP-43 regarding the sunsetting of v1 in the manner described above.\n\n**Abstain**: Undecided, but contributing to quorum.",

      "title": "RFP-42: Onboard rsETH on Arbitrum",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nRFP-42 proposes integrating rsETH ([Kelp DAO](https://kelpdao.xyz/) Liquid Restaking Token) as a full collateral and borrow market within Radiant Capital's Arbitrum deployment.\n\n## Motivation\n\nRadiant Capital aims to provide a decentralized platform for lending and borrowing cryptocurrencies, offering users an efficient and secure means to access financing and generate yields. As the DeFi market evolves, expanding the platform's offerings by incorporating new, high-quality assets as collateral and borrowing options is essential.\n\nrsETH represents a liquid restaking derivative token that mirrors the value of staked ETH and its associated rewards. This token was created by Kelp DAO, which provides users with the opportunity to participate in ETH staking rewards from the Ethereum network. Wrapped tokens, such as rsETH, enable the utilization of cryptocurrencies on different blockchains while remaining backed by the underlying asset.\n\nThis governance proposal seeks approval to integrate rsETH as an accepted form of collateral and as a borrowing market within Radiant Capital's Arbitrum deployment. This expansion aligns with Radiant Capital's vision of offering its users a comprehensive and diverse set of assets. The onboarding of rsETH will consequently create increased rsETH demand and increased fees for both Radiant and Kelp DAO, whilst also bolstering the liquidity and peg stability of rsETH.\n\nThe Risk Committee has evaluated rsETH and recommended the parameters for its integration into the platform, which will be outlined below.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n-   **rsETH** - Kelp DAO Restaked ETH\n    \n-   **Max LTV** - The Maximum LTV ratio represents the maximum borrowing power of a specific collateral. For example, if a collateral has an LTV of 75%, the user can borrow up to 0.75 worth of ETH in the principal currency for every 1 ETH worth of collateral.\n    \n-   **Liquidation Threshold** - This represents the threshold at which a borrow position will be considered undercollateralized and subject to liquidation for each collateral. For example, if a collateral has a liquidation threshold of 80%, it means that the position will be liquidated when the debt value is worth 80% of the collateral value.\n    \n\n## Specifications\n\n-   **Add rsETH as a full collateral and borrow market**\n \n| Parameter            | Value      |\n|----------------------|------------|\n| Enable Borrowing     | Yes        |\n| LTV                  | 70.00%     |\n| LT                   | 73.00%     |\n| Liquidation Bonus    | 7.50%      |\n| Supply Cap           | 1,200      |\n| Borrow Cap           | 120        |\n| U-Optimal            | 45%        |\n| Slope1               | 10.00%     |\n| Slope2               | 300.00%    |\n| Reserve Factor       | 25.00%     |\n\n-   Scale allocation points (incentive emissions) for lend and borrow markets as deposits grow for a two-week period, at which point AP will be stabilized\n    \n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n-   **Chainlink Integration**: To list rsETH, a Chainlink feed for the rsETH/ETH exchange ratio must be integrated. This feed will provide accurate, real-time exchange rate data for the rsETH token.\n\n- **rsETH/ETH chainlink feed**: 0x8f1dF6D7F2db73eECE86a18b4381F4707b918FB1 \n    \n-   **Smart Contract Implementation**: Based on the defined parameters, the Radiant team will implement the necessary updates to enable the integration of rsETH as a collateral and borrow market with the parameters as laid out above. This implementation will involve coding and testing the smart contracts to ensure their functionality and security.\n    \n-   **User Interface Update**: The Radiant Capital user interface will be updated to reflect the addition of rsETH as a collateral and borrow market. This includes providing users with the option to select rsETH as collateral and borrow assets, as well as displaying relevant information such as rsETH exchange rates, available loan options, and associated risks.\n    \n\n## Overall Cost/Impact\n\nMinimal.\n\n## Timeline\n\nIntegration is expected to occur swiftly, subject to the following stages:\n\n-   **Local Testing**: The Radiant team will conduct thorough testing of the implementation in a local environment to ensure its functionality, security, and compatibility within the EArbitrum ecosystem.\n    \n-   **Staging**: Following Chainlink Feed integration, the implementation will proceed to a staging phase, where further testing will verify the integrity and functionality of the rsETH collateral and borrow market.\n    \n\n## Voting\n\n-   **In Favor**: Supportive of RFP-42, adding rsETH to the Arbitrum deployment of Radiant\n    \n-   **Against**: Against implementation of the RFP-42 proposal\n    \n-   **Abstain**: Undecided, but contributing to quorum",

USDe is a Layer Zero omnifungible token (OFT) and fits well within Radiant’s omnichain mission.\n\nThis governance proposal seeks approval to integrate USDe as an accepted form of collateral and as a borrowing market within Radiant Capital's Ethereum and Arbitrum deployment. This expansion aligns with Radiant Capital's vision of offering its users a comprehensive and diverse set of assets.\n\nThe Risk Committee has evaluated USDe and recommended the parameters for its integration into the platform, which will be outlined below.\n\n##   \n\n## Key Terms\n\n-   **USDe** - Ethena’s synthetic dollar token\n    \n-   **Max LTV** - The Maximum LTV ratio represents the maximum borrowing power of a specific collateral. For example, if a collateral has an LTV of 75%, the user can borrow up to 0.75 worth of ETH in the principal currency for every 1 ETH worth of collateral.\n    \n-   **Liquidation Threshold** - This represents the threshold at which a borrow position will be considered undercollateralized and subject to liquidation for each collateral. For example, if a collateral has a liquidation threshold of 80%, it means that the position will be liquidated when the debt value is worth 80% of the collateral value.\n    \n\n## Specifications\n\n-   **Add USDe as a full collateral and borrow market on Ethereum**\n\n| Parameter            | Value        |\n|----------------------|--------------|\n| Enable Borrowing     | Yes          |\n| LTV                  | 72.00%       |\n| LT                   | 75.00%       |\n| Liquidation Bonus    | 8.50%        |\n| Supply Cap (USDe)    | 65,000,000   |\n| Borrow Cap (USDe)    | 52,000,000   |\n| U-Optimal            | 80%          |\n| Slope1               | 9.00%        |\n| Slope2               | 75.00%       |\n\n\n  ##\n\n-   **Add USDe as a full collateral and borrow market on Arbitrum**\n   \n\n| Parameter            | Value        |\n|----------------------|--------------|\n| Enable Borrowing     | Yes          |\n| LTV                  | 69.00%       |\n| LT                   | 72.00%       |\n| Liquidation Bonus    | 8.50%        |\n| Supply Cap (USDe)    | 5,700,000    |\n| Borrow Cap (USDe)    | 4,900,000    |\n| U-Optimal            | 80%          |\n| Slope1               | 9.00%        |\n| Slope2               | 75.00%       |\n\n##\n\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n-   **Chainlink Integration**: To list USDe, a Chainlink feed for the USDe must be integrated. This feed will provide accurate, real-time data for the USDe token.\n\n- **Arbitrum USDe chainlink feed**: 0x88AC7Bca36567525A866138F03a6F6844868E0Bc\n\n- **Ethereum USDe chainlink feed**: 0xa569d910839Ae8865Da8F8e70FfFb0cBA869F961 \n    \n-   **Smart Contract Implementation**: Based on the defined parameters, the Radiant team will implement the necessary updates to enable the integration of USDe as a collateral and borrow market with the parameters as laid out above. This implementation will involve coding and testing the smart contracts to ensure their functionality and security.\n    \n-  **User Interface Update**: The Radiant Capital user interface will be updated to reflect the addition of USDe as a collateral and borrow market. This includes providing users with the option to select USDe as collateral and borrow assets and displaying relevant information such as USDe exchange rates, available loan options, and associated risks.\n    \n\n## Overall Cost/Impact\n\nMinimal.\n\n## Timeline\n\nIntegration is expected to occur swiftly, subject to the following stages:\n\n-   **Local Testing**: The Radiant team will conduct thorough testing of the implementation in a local environment to ensure its functionality, security, and compatibility within the Ethereum and Arbitrum ecosystems.\n    \n-   **Staging**: Following Chainlink Feed integration, the implementation will proceed to a staging phase, where further testing will verify the integrity and functionality of the USDe collateral and borrow market.\n    \n\n## Voting\n\n-   **In Favor**: Supportive of RFP-40, adding USDe to the Ethereum and Arbitrum deployments of Radiant\n    \n-   **Against**: Against implementation of the RFP-40 proposal\n    \n-   **Abstain**: Undecided, but contributing to quorum",

      "title": "RFP-38: New Revenue Management with Fewer Reward Assets",
      "content": "This proposal seeks approval to designate fewer chain-specific default reward assets that an increasingly large reward basket can be converted into to improve the user experience and reduce gas fees.\n\n## Abstract\n\nA standout aspect of Radiant’s value proposition as a next-gen lending protocol is the revenue sharing of real yields (in blue chip assets and stablecoins) with users of the platform who supply locked liquidity, with  **$33.5 million in protocol fees paid out over the past 2 years**. As the Radiant dApp extends support for more and more collaterals,  **especially by adding dozens more Radiant Innovation Zone (RIZ) isolated altcoin markets**, the process of claiming dozens of collaterals will be getting even more unwieldy and less capital-efficient than it has already been with recently added main unified markets collaterals such as wbETH and weETH.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nBased on the supported chain, users can claim 7 to 9 assets in the pending reward basket at a time, an all-or-nothing affair. However, due to the number of assets as well as status checks on each of them prior to execution, these sizable transaction bundles typically are gas-intensive and costly, despite extensive past efforts to optimize gas fees. The user experience (UX) has also been less than ideal. Introducing a revenue management feature that economically auto-converts the pending reward basket into a smaller set of popular blue-chip assets will vastly improve the UX and overall economics. This feature has also been a popular community enhancement request\n\n## Key Terms\n\n**RIZ**:  **Radiant Innovation Zone**  is an imminently available v3 feature that will support popular altcoins representing this bull run’s hot narratives (**dePIN**,  **RWA**,  **LRT**,  **AI**,  **Gaming**,  **NFT**,  **Meme**… etc) in isolated markets.\n\n## Specifications\n\nBased on utility and economics, the following approach is recommended:\n\n1.  **Low gas cost chains**:  **BTC + gas token**  (ETH or other)  **+ stable**\n2.  **High gas cost chains**:  **Gas token**  (ETH or other).\n\nSpecifically, these assets are recommended for each of the following chains:\n\n-   **Ethereum**:  **ETH**\n-   **Arbitrum**:  **WBTC**,  **ETH**,  **USDC**\n-   **BNB Chain**:  **WBTC**,  **BNB**,  **USDC**\n-   **Base**:  **WBTC**,  **ETH**,  **USDC**\n\nOnce the new revenue management feature is implemented, the new rewards will accumulate and be evenly divided between only those newly designated assets, not the full complement of what is in the money markets.\n\nDuring the transition period, previous accumulated rewards will still be shown in the pending reward basket until claimed. After legacy rewards have been claimed, those legacy asset types will be removed from the reward section. The exception is that new rewards do get stacked with previous asset types (do not get removed) if they have been identified as new revenue management assets on that chain, such as BTC, ETH, or USDC…\n\n## Timeline\n\nWithin 30 days of ratification.\n\n## Overall Cost/Impact\n\n-   **User Impact:**  There will be a significant improvement in the claiming workflow for users. This has been one of the most popular enhancement requests, and it will finally be delivered.\n-   **System Impact**: Minimal to none, as it is a discrete feature enhancement.\n-   **Legal & Compliance Considerations**: N/A.\n-   **Costs**: Minimal.\n\n## Voting\n\n-   **In Favor**: In support of proposed steps to designate default reward assets per supported chain.\n-   **Against**: Against implementation of RFP-38\n-   **Abstain**: Undecided, but contributing to quorum",

      "title": "RFP-35 (Resubmission): Establishing a Dynamic Emission Schedule for dLP Lockers",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis proposal is a resubmission of the original RFP-35, which was not ratified. It is a strategic extension to RFP-33 by introducing a dynamic anti-dilution emission schedule to dLP lockers as per RFP-33. **Two (2) key changes from the original submission include the linear schedule for the anti-dilution emission and ensuring 100% of the forfeited RDNT tokens remain in the qLP pool to be redistributed to only qLP**.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBuilding on the foundation laid by RFP-33, which sought to enhance Radiant's emissions runway and increase utilization rates, RFP-35 is crafted to further leverage these efforts by prioritizing the contributions of those who have committed to locking their dLP within the Radiant protocol.\n\nRFP-33 earmarked **125,000,000 RDNT** for the purpose of streaming additional rewards to eligible dLPs over a two-year period. RFP-35 introduces a linear  emission schedule designed to reward long-term commitment among these eligible dLP lockers, thereby ensuring sustained engagement and enhanced liquidity. This phased approach to distributing rewards aligns with the gradual dilution expected from the supply adjustment terms as laid out in RFP-33, ensuring that the incentives remain effective and stabilize token value as the supply increases. By doing so, RFP-35 aims to bolster the community's investment in the protocol's success, aligning the community with Radiant’s strategic goals.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n* **qLP (Quantum dLP):**  Dynamic Liquidity Provider (dLP) tokens that have been locked prior to the initial snapshot of the two-year incentives program. qLP represents a user’s proportional share of the two-year allocation. These tokens are identical in value, benefits, and function to standard dLP tokens on-chain, but are logged and tracked separately within the Radiant protocol to facilitate the allocation of additional incentive rewards.\n* **Initial snapshot:** A designated on-chain record taken three months **(90d) after the ratification of RFP-35 or when the anti-dilution drip mechanism has passed the security audit and is fully implemented, whichever is later**. This snapshot captures and locks the quantity of dLP tokens held by each user, determining their eligibility and proportional share as qLP for the two-year incentives program.\n\n## Specifications\n\n1. **Incentivization Structure**: RDNT allocated to dLP lockers will be distributed linearly over an accelerated two-year term compared to the parallel three-year increased emission schedule and will be paid out in 6-month tranches following the qLP snapshot.  These incentive tranches will be dripped out (airdropped) using the new dripping mechanism and will be immediately claimable. :\n\n![Screenshot 2024-05-27 at 12.45.29.png](ipfs://bafkreihhcr3zu7ndtde56ei5hlpcte65qveitjmdbvwbwl5vbc6cgfu344)\n    \n2. **dLP → qLP :** Upon initiation of the snapshot, **each dLP currently locked within Radiant will be considered as a qLP**, regardless of its lock duration. A user’s qLP total represents their proportional share of the total RDNT allocation pool.\n\n3. **Allocation to qLP and new dLP during the 3+ month transition period:**  During the transition period between RFP-35 ratification and the qLP snapshot, the anti-dilution emission will be split 85/15 with 85% to qLP and 15% toward incentivizing new dLP, especially for an additional chain launch that is anticipated during this transition period.\n4. **Partial Forfeiture for Early Exit:** If a locker decides to unlock any portion of their qLP during the term, they will forfeit that corresponding proportion of potential emissions. Their remaining qLP balance will continue to remain eligible for incentives as the term progresses. The later in the term the exit occurs, the lesser the penalty, with the most substantial forfeitures occurring within the first 12 months.  **To track the early exits, random monthly snapshots will be made to track any drop from the previous month’s qLP total.** \n\n\tBy enabling “**Auto relock**” on the “Manage” page within the Radiant app users can **ensure that their qLP positions remain uninterrupted, safeguarding their full eligibility throughout the term**.\t  In the event qLP is unlocked but hasn’t been claimed/withdrawn from their pools (displayed in redeemable or dLP overview section) and before the random monthly snapshot is taken, the UI will prompt the user to relock as qLP or explicitly withdraw/exit.  **If the monthly snapshot is taken without them being relocked prior, they will be counted as early exits, and previously allocated tokens forfeited**.\n5. **No New Entries Post-Snapshot:** Post the initial snapshot, **no additional qLP can be created**. This ensures that the benefit is reserved exclusively for those who are part of the ecosystem at the time of the snapshot. Future incentives will be structured differently to accommodate new community members.\n6. **Reclamation of Forfeited RDNT:** RDNT forfeited by early exits will remain in the qLP reward pool, and **100% of the accumulated total will be redistributed to the remaining qLP at the end of the 2-year term, over the following six (6) months**.\n\n### Example of Early Withdrawal Impact on Incentives\n\nConsider a user, Alice, who has 100 dLP locked at the time of the opening snapshot. Those 100 dLP are now treated as 100 qLP. For these examples, let’s assume that her 100 qLP represents 1% of the total qLP pool:\n \n![Screenshot 2024-05-27 at 13.50.07.png](ipfs://bafkreidus7srt7ymzodwkkwckfibuf7slh3vj4kmkdk7he72j34jbo4zei)\n    \n**RDNT Received at Point:** The total RDNT received by Alice up to the point of withdrawal or check-in, calculated based on the linear emission schedule at the specific timeframe.\n\n**Remaining Eligibility:** vFor partial withdrawals, this column shows how much more RDNT Alice would continue to receive until the end of the term if she maintains the remaining qLP.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n### Initial Setup & Launch\n\n1. Conduct an on-chain snapshot of all dLP lockers three months (90d) from the proposal ratification date to determine initial eligibility and each qualified user’s proportional share of the incentives program. This will establish which dLP tokens are converted into qLP for the duration of the emission period.\n\n2. Begin the RDNT distribution following the linear emission schedule immediately after the snapshot validation.\n\n### Frontend\n\n1. Update the Radiant app’s user interface to display each holder's qLP balance distinctly from their standard dLP holdings.\n\n2. Implement a visualization of distribution progress and status, allowing users to see the amount of RDNT they have received and the expected future distributions based on the linear schedule.\n3. Provide information on the timing of future distributions and emission schedules.\n4. Allow users to easily understand the implications of early exits or additional locks after the snapshot, emphasizing that new locks will not qualify as qLP.\n\n### Backend\n\n1. Implement a database schema to tag and track dLP tokens that qualify as qLP at the time of the snapshot. This involves marking eligible tokens in the database and ensuring they are distinguishable from regular dLP tokens.\n\n2. At the time of the snapshot, run a script that scans all dLP holdings. For each dLP token held by a user, if the token is locked, update the database to set **is_qLP** to **true**.\n3. Implement a monitoring system that continuously checks the state of qLP tokens. If a user unlocks some or all of their qLP tokens, the system should update the database to reflect these changes, recalculating the remaining RDNT entitlement based on the linear schedule.\n4. Develop a dedicated module within the existing backend architecture that handles the logic for RDNT distribution from the DAO Reserve, along with an automated distribution stream.\n\n## Timeline\n\n* **T-0 (Ratification Date):** Official announcement of the emission schedule to the Radiant community. The snapshot for determining eligible dLP lockers called quantum LP (qLP) is scheduled. Development of backend database schema and frontend UI/UX integration commences.\n\n* **T+ ~3m** (see snapshot in Key Terms section)**:** The **snapshot is taken**, locking in the eligibility and the amount of RDNT each qLP will potentially receive. This marks the closure of new entries into the qLP category. From this point, the emission schedule begins.\n* **Snapshot - month 6:** Initial tranche of anti-dilution emissions with 25% of the total 125,000,000 RDNT distributed at the end of period.\n* **Months 7-12:** Second trance of anti-dilution emissions with 25% distributed at the end of period.\n* **Months 13-18:** Third trance of anti-dilution emissions with 25% distributed at the end of period..\n* **Months 19-24:** Forth and final trance of anti-dilution emissions with 25% distributed at the end of period..\n* **End of Year 2 (T+ ~27 Months):** Completion of the RFP-35 emissions program. **Forfeited RDNT from early exits will be redistributed to remaining qLP over the folowing 6 months**.  \n\n## Overall Impact\n\n**User Impact:** By implementing a linear emission schedule, this proposal strongly incentivizes long-term commitment and enhances user engagement with the Radiant ecosystem.\n**System Impact:** Increases protocol stability and locked liquidity.\n\n### Cost\n\n* **Development:** The development efforts required for this proposal will be handled by our existing salaried development team, incurring no additional charges.\n* **Operational Expenses:** There are no new outlays for services or operational expenditures anticipated, ensuring the implementation is cost-efficient and leverages our current resource allocation effectively.\n\n## Voting\n\n**In Favor:** Agree with establishing a dynamic emission schedule as described.\n\n**Against:** Oppose the dynamic emission schedule proposal.\n\n**Abstain:** Remain neutral, contributing to the quorum without endorsing or opposing the change.",

      "title": "RFP-37:  Redistribution of the First LayerZero Airdrop for Radiant",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nRFP-37 aims to redistribute the first LayerZero airdrop allocation, denominated in LayerZero's forthcoming token, **ZRO**, to Radiant Capital's community and contributors. LayerZero's token generation event, along with potential future protocol airdrops, allows projects that have deployed OApp, OFT, or ONFT contracts before LayerZero's first snapshot (11:59:59 PM, May 1, 2024) to submit proposals detailing their redistribution plans. This proposal outlines the Radiant DAO's strategy to incentivize its contributors, ensuring alignment with the community and supporting the long-term growth of the project.\n\nAdditionally, [Stargate is likely to allocate 18% of its LayerZero airdrop](https://l.radiant.capital/T2JA) to reward partners like Radiant for activities that include cross-chain borrows. This will be factored into Radiant’s overall redistribution strategy as detailed below, pending final approval.\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcRfyaLUGsxvAnyKQzZYJKRGVyXLevdccAa56FdOvyUqb0x2hndkmeFwLQU6hnSm8YGbN9mZYBUTpj56cB9eqn_Jwgq4AKDOMw77clb1ItV7X26YyOTSDIxulW9POoFasNss41JBtaPrfe6Lt7g3vxmQ-vi?key=AjGH9Gwr77xkZxqok6X4-g)\n\n## Motivation\n\nSince adopting LayerZero with the initial v1 launch in July 2022 and OFT capability in March 2023 with v2, Radiant has a long history of active support and integration with the LayerZero omnichain ecosystem. This airdrop provides an opportunity to acknowledge and incentivize dedicated contributors for their past participation, driving further engagement, collaboration, and long-term growth.\n\nDynamic Liquidity Provisioning (dLP) is central to Radiant’s value proposition, representing long-term liquidity that secures the protocol and supports a stable growth trajectory. Given its critical impact on Radiant’s economics, dLP will receive the majority of Radiant’s ZRO allocation.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n-   **Stargate Foundation RFP**: An internal Stargate proposal that allocates 18% of its LayerZero airdrop to reward partner protocols, including Radiant, for activities such as cross-chain borrow transactions.\n    \n-   **Radiant's Stargate Partner Allocation**: Radiant’s portion of the 18% allocation from Stargate's LayerZero airdrop, based on cross-chain borrow transactions performed on Radiant’s platform.\n    \n-   **dLP Allocation Formula**: A formula used to calculate individual Dynamic Liquidity Provisioning (dLP) allocations in the airdrop, taking into account both time-served and whether the dLP was withdrawn.\n    \n-   **Withdrawn dLP**: Dynamic Liquidity Provisioning (dLP) that has been withdrawn or exited prior to 11:59:59 PM UTC on May 1, 2024.\n    \n-   **OFT-RDNT Bridge Activity**: The process of transferring RDNT tokens across Radiant’s supported blockchains using LayerZero's OFT technology.\n    \n## Specifications\n\nThe Radiant DAO has identified the following categories and options for redistributing the airdrop, which include Radiant's potential share from Stargate's partner airdrop allocation and the direct allocation from LayerZero.\n\n### Allocation Breakdown\n\n**1.  Stargate Partner Allocation**\n    \n-   Radiant’s share of Stargate’s 18% partner airdrop will be distributed to all past cross-chain borrow activities up to 11:59:59 PM UTC on May 1, 2024.\n\n**2.  Direct Allocation from LayerZero**\n\n-   **10%** of Radiant’s allocation will go to the development team, as per LayerZero’s guidance, to cover salaries and expenses.\n    \n-   **90%** of Radiant’s allocation will be redistributed based on the following options, which will be determined by community voting:\n    \n\n### Redistribution Options\n\n**Option 1:**\n\n-   **15%** to all past OFT-RDNT cross-chain bridge activities up to 11:59:59 PM UTC on May 1, 2024\n    \n-   **75%** to dLPs\n    \n**Option 2:**\n\n-   **10%** to all past OFT-RDNT cross-chain bridge activities up to 11:59:59 PM UTC on May 1, 2024\n    \n-   **80%** to dLPs\n    \n### Allocation for OFT-RDNT Cross-Chain Bridge Activities\n\nThe allocation for past OFT-RDNT cross-chain bridge activities will be calculated as:\n\n***Bridge Allocation = (Total Individual RDNT Bridged / Total RDNT Bridged) * Allocation for Bridge Activities***\n\nWhere:\n\n-   **Total Individual RDNT Bridged** is the amount of RDNT bridged by an individual.\n    \n-   **Total RDNT Bridged** is the total amount of RDNT bridged by all users.\n    \n-   **Allocation for Bridge Activities** is either 15% or 10% of the total direct allocation from LayerZero, depending on the selected option.\n\n### Formula for dLP Allocation\n\nThe allocation to individual dLPs will be calculated using the following formula:\n\n***dLP Allocation = (Total Individual dLP / Total dLP) * Time-Served Multiplier * Status Multiplier***\n\nWhere:\n\n-   **Time-Served Multiplier** = (Duration of Individual dLP / Maximum Possible Duration).\n    \n-   **Maximum Possible Duration** is the full period of time between Radiant’s v2 launch up to 11:59:59 PM UTC on May 1, 2024.\n    \n-   **Status Multiplier** differentiates between active and withdrawn dLP and is subject to community voting.\n\n### Status Multiplier Voting Options\n\nFurthermore, the DAO will vote to determine the Status Multiplier for withdrawn dLP. A lower multiplier assigns less weight for users who have locked dLP at any given point during the Maximum Possible Duration but have subsequently withdrawn it:\n\n| Option       | Active dLP (still locked) | Withdrawn dLP |\n|--------------|---------------------------|---------------|\n| **Option 1** | 1                         | 0             |\n| **Option 2** | 1                         | 0.1           |\n| **Option 3** | 1                         | 0.25          |\n\n## Timeline\n\nAddresses and allocation data will be submitted to LayerZero by **May 31, 2024**, and to Stargate by **June 5, 2024**. Radiant will follow LayerZero and Stargate's plans for the timing of the airdrop and redistribution.\n\n## Overall Cost/Impact\n\n-   **User Impact**: No changes to the application are required.\n    \n-   **Costs**: Minimal development involvement required.\n\n## Voting\n\nThe community will vote on the following **seven** options, each combining a specific allocation split between OFT-RDNT bridge activities and dLP, and a status multiplier for withdrawn dLP:\n\n| Option                     | Split                           | Withdrawn Multiplier | Summary                                             |\n|----------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| **A) 15%/75%, 0x Withdrawn** | 15% to OFT-RDNT, 75% to dLP     | 0                    | Higher allocation for bridge activities, no allocation for withdrawn dLP |\n| **B) 15%/75%, 0.1x Withdrawn** | 15% to OFT-RDNT, 75% to dLP     | 0.1                 | Higher allocation for bridge activities, low allocation for withdrawn dLP |\n| **C) 15%/75%, 0.25x Withdrawn** | 15% to OFT-RDNT, 75% to dLP     | 0.25                  | Higher allocation for bridge activities, moderate allocation for withdrawn dLP |\n| **D) 10%/80%, 0x Withdrawn** | 10% to OFT-RDNT, 80% to dLP     | 0                    | Higher allocation for locked dLP, no allocation for withdrawn dLP |\n| **E) 10%/80%, 0.1x Withdrawn** | 10% to OFT-RDNT, 80% to dLP     | 0.1                 | Higher allocation for locked dLP, low allocation for withdrawn dLP |\n| **F) 10%/80%, 0.25x Withdrawn** | 10% to OFT-RDNT, 80% to dLP     | 0.25                  | Higher allocation for locked dLP, moderate allocation for withdrawn dLP |\n| **G) Abstain**              | -                             | -                  | Undecided, but contributing to quorum      |",

      "title": "RFP-36: Radiant Expansion & Deployment to Base",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nBased on a [chain expansion survey](https://l.radiant.capital/oRF1) conducted within the Radiant community in May 2024, [Base](https://l.radiant.capital/GRwi) emerged as the top choice with 48% of the votes, followed by Linea, Avalanche, Optimism, and other options (Mode, Solana) at around 10% each.\n\nNote: Certain components of the Radiant tech stack, namely The Graph Protocol, Snapshot.org and Stargate Bridge, still do not support a few chains for at least another few months. This includes Mantle (The Graph), Blast (Snapshot), and Solana (Stargate, The Graph, and Snapshot).\n\nRFP-36 seeks to secure approval from Radiant DAO stakeholders to deploy the Radiant protocol on Base.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Radiant community has chosen Base as the next expansion step to further drive the  overall [network effect](https://l.radiant.capital/ht2v)  on Radiant’s user base and increase the financial value and influence of the network. With the addition of numerous altcoin collaterals to the v3 Radiant Innovation Zone (RIZ) isolated markets and supported chains in the coming months, the network effect is expected to reach an explosive phase in Radiant’s short 2-year history. These altcoins, aligned with current market trends (such as dePIN, RWA, LRT, AI, NFTs and Memecoins), will enhance curb appeal and attract more users and dormant altcoin capital, seeking additional yield opportunities.\n\nSpecifically, enabling Base on Radiant creates unique fee-generating and user-acquisition opportunities for Radiant, capturing the growth and interest of users on the Coinbase platform. Base allows Radiant to instantly leverage Coinbase’s products and distribution: seamless Coinbase integrations, fiat onramps, and access to 73M+ users and $80B in assets within the Coinbase ecosystem.\n\nIn the first week of Base, 18k developers deployed 55k smart contracts on testnet. This sustained activity since the network's announcement has the potential to introduce new, valuable users to DeFi and Radiant.\n\nSince Base's testnet launch on 02/23/2023, metrics illustrate strong activity:\n\n-   73,000,000 unique addresses as of May 18, 2024.\n    \n-   Average of 2,500,000 transactions per day for the first half of May 2024.\n    \n-   1,000,000+ addresses holding a Base Builder NFT for participating in Quests.\n    \n-   In addition, Base has shown impressive retention for a blockchain, with ~70,000 unique wallets returning to Base for subsequent transactions within one day. The users–likely early developers–paint a promising outlook for the activity that may be seen on mainnet.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n-   dLP: Dynamic Liquidity Providers within the Radiant protocol.\n    \n-   Interest rate curve: A model by which Radiant determines how interest rates change in response to different utilizations.\n    \n## Specifications\n\nIf RFP-36 passes, the Radiant DAO will begin development and operational efforts to prepare for the Base launch.\n\nIt is important to note that the RDNT token supply adjustment specified in [RFP-33](https://l.radiant.capital/0Shl) was minted on BASE due to a technical limitation preventing additional minting on currently supported chains. [This minting](https://l.radiant.capital/PnhZ) was performed on BASE and then [bridged to Arbitrum](https://l.radiant.capital/jfwE). However, this mint is unrelated to the operational deployment of Radiant on the BASE chain, which RFP-36 aims to address.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n-   Deploy the RDNT token on Base\n    \n-   Initialize Radiant smart contracts on Base\n    \n-   Update app.radiant.capital front end to reflect the addition of Base Chain\n    \n-   Update vote power within the governance system to reflect the addition a fourth chain\n    \n\n## Overall Cost/Impact\n\nAuditing Costs: To ensure the security of the protocol, comprehensive audits are required. There may be some additional ad-hoc auditing costs, in addition to the over $1,000,000 already spent on audits.\n\nDevelopment Resources: Given the existing work already completed and under review from OpenZeppelin, this has been scoped as a “medium” effort project. Deployment on Base would include allocating resources for front and back developers, system architects, project managers, and testing, as well as any modifications required for compatibility with Base and implementation of notes from auditors.\n\n## Timeline\n\nQ2 2024 launch\n\n## Voting\n\nIn favor: Support the implementation of RFP-36, agreeing with the decision for the DAO to deploy the Radiant protocol on Base.\n\nAgainst: Oppose the implementation of RFP-36, preventing the DAO from deploying the Radiant protocol on Base.\n\nAbstain: Undecided, but contributing to quorum.",

      "title": "RFP Idea-35: Establishing a Dynamic Emission Schedule for dLP Lockers",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nRFP-35 proposes a strategic extension to [RFP-33](https://l.radiant.capital/SKl9)  by introducing a dynamic emission schedule for dLP lockers, enhancing the incentivization mechanism for RDNT distribution.\n\nTo strengthen the outcomes of the increased token supply approved in RFP-33 and encouraging long-term participation, this proposal focuses on incentivizing dLP lockers who sustain their positions, this schedule allocates emissions over a two-year period with increased benefits accruing in the latter half.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBuilding on the foundation laid by RFP-33, RFP-35 optimizes the emission runway and utilization rates by prioritizing the contributions of those who have committed to locking their dLP.\n\n**RFP-33 earmarked 125,000,000 RDNT** for the purpose of streaming additional rewards to **eligible dLPs over a two-year period**. RFP-35 introduces a back-weighted emission schedule designed to reward long-term commitment among these eligible dLP lockers, thereby ensuring sustained engagement and enhanced liquidity. This phased approach to distributing rewards aligns with the gradual dilution expected from the supply adjustment terms as laid out in RFP-33, ensuring that the incentives remain effective and stabilize token value as the supply increases. By doing so, RFP-35 aims to bolster the community's investment in the protocol's success, aligning the community with Radiant’s strategic goals.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n-   **qLP (Quantum dLP)**:  Dynamic Liquidity Provider (dLP) tokens that have been **locked prior to the initial snapshot** of the two-year incentives program. qLP represent a user’s proportional share of the two-year allocation. These tokens are identical in value, benefits and function to standard dLP tokens on-chain, but are logged and tracked separately within the Radiant protocol to facilitate the allocation of additional incentive rewards.\n    \n-   **Initial snapshot**: A designated on-chain record **taken three months (90d) after the ratification of RFP-35 or when the  anti-dilution drip mechanism has passed the security audit and is fully implemented, whichever is later**. This snapshot captures and locks the quantity of dLP tokens held by each user, determining their eligibility and proportional share as qLP for the two-year incentives program.\n\n## Specifications\n\n**1.  Incentivization Structure**:  RDNT allocated to dLP lockers will be distributed over an accelerated two-year term compared to the parallel three-year increased emission schedule but is back-weighted and continuously increasing as it progresses over its own two-year term duration. This structure increases the relative reward for lockers who remain committed throughout the term and is preferable to a linear schedule as it fosters more stability of liquidity and protocol resilience. The schedule is designed as follows:\n   \n![table.png](ipfs://bafkreidoaianmradaae2phq2iemewodetm5rfyjojhr2anpvpm6ueeeewy)\n\n**2.  dLP → qLP** : Upon initiation of the snapshot, each dLP currently locked within Radiant will be considered as a qLP, regardless of its lock duration. A user’s qLP total represents their proportional share of the total RDNT allocation pool.\n    \n**3.  Allocation to qLP and new dLP during the 3+ month transition period**:  During the transition period between RFP-35 ratification and the qLP snapshot, the anti-dilution emission will be split 85/15 with 85% to qLP and 15% toward incentivizing new dLP, especially for an additional chain launch that is anticipated during this transition period.\n    \n**4.  Partial Forfeiture for Early Exit**:  If a locker decides to unlock any portion of their qLP during the term, they will forfeit that corresponding proportion of potential emissions. Their remaining qLP balance will continue to remain eligible for incentives as the term progresses. The later in the term the exit occurs, the lesser the penalty, with the most substantial forfeitures occurring within the first 12 months. To track the early exits, random monthly snapshots will be made to track any drop from the previous month’s qLP total.  \n\nBy enabling “**Auto relock**” on the “Manage” page within the Radiant app users can **ensure that their qLP positions remain uninterrupted**, safeguarding their full eligibility throughout the term.\n    \n**5.  No New Entries Post-Snapshot**: Post the initial snapshot, no additional qLP can be created. This ensures that the benefit is reserved exclusively for those who are part of the ecosystem at the time of the snapshot. Future incentives will be structured differently to accommodate new community members.\n    \n**6.  Reclamation of Forfeited RDNT**: RDNT forfeited by early exits will remain in the qLP reward pool, and 100% of the accumulated total will be redirected to dLP providers via future initiatives at the end of the 2-year term. Implementation details will be proposed by the community for DAO approval via a future proposal.\n    \n### Example of Early Withdrawal Impact on Incentives\n\nConsider a user, Alice, who has 100 dLP locked at the time of the opening snapshot. Those 100 dLP are now treated as 100 qLP. For these examples, let’s assume that her 100 qLP represent 1% of the total qLP pool:\n \n![table2.png](ipfs://bafkreie35vjdowibptv6bzx4jkwfv367eix5psob63642jylxzfdpqqzqm)\n\n**RDNT Received at Point**:  The total RDNT received by Alice up to the point of withdrawal or check-in, calculated based on the back-weighted emission schedule at the specific timeframe.\n\n**Remaining Eligibility**: For partial withdrawals, this column shows how much more RDNT Alice would continue to receive until the end of the term if she maintains the remaining qLP.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n### Initial Setup & Launch\n\n1.  Conduct an on-chain snapshot of all dLP lockers three months (90d) from the proposal ratification date to determine initial eligibility and each qualified user’s proportional share of the incentives program. This will establish which dLP tokens are converted into qLP for the duration of the emission period.\n    \n2.  Begin the RDNT distribution following the back-weighted emission schedule immediately after the snapshot validation.\n    \n### Frontend\n\n1.  Update the Radiant app’s user interface to display each holder's qLP balance distinctly from their standard dLP holdings.\n    \n2.  Implement a visualization of distribution progress and status, allowing users to see the amount of RDNT they have received and the expected future distributions based on the back-weighted schedule.\n    \n3.  Provide information on the timing of future distributions and emission schedule.\n    \n4.  Allow users to easily understand the implications of early exits or additional locks after the snapshot, emphasizing that new locks will not qualify as qLP.\n    \n### Backend\n\n1.  Implement a database schema to tag and track dLP tokens that qualify as qLP at the time of the snapshot. This involves marking eligible tokens in the database and ensuring they are distinguishable from regular dLP tokens.\n    \n2.  At the time of the snapshot, run a script that scans all dLP holdings. For each dLP token held by a user, if the token is locked, update the database to set is_qLP to true.\n    \n3.  Implement a monitoring system that continuously checks the state of qLP tokens. If a user unlocks some or all of their qLP tokens, the system should update the database to reflect these changes, recalculating the remaining RDNT entitlement based on the back-weighted schedule.\n    \n4.  Develop a dedicated module within the existing backend architecture that handles the logic for RDNT distribution from the DAO Reserve, along with an automated distribution stream.\n    \n## Timeline\n\n-   T-0 (Ratification Date): Official announcement of the emission schedule to the Radiant community. The snapshot for determining eligible dLP lockers called quantum LP (qLP) is scheduled. Development of backend database schema and frontend UI/UX integration commences.\n    \n-   T+X  (see snapshot in Key Terms section): The snapshot is taken, locking in the eligibility and the amount of RDNT each qLP will potentially receive. This marks the closure of new entries into the qLP category. From this point, the emission schedule begins.\n    \n-   Months 1-6: Initial phase of emissions with 10% of the total 125,000,000 RDNT distributed at the end of this 6-month period..\n    \n-   Months 7-12:  The second phase sees an increase, with 22.5% of the total RDNT distributed at the end of this six-month period.\n    \n-   Months 13-18:  Distribution increases significantly, with 30.5% of the RDNT allocated during this period. Distributed at the end of this 6-month period.\n    \n-   Months 19-24:  The final and most incentivized phase, with 37% of the RDNT distributed, rewarding those who remain locked. Distributed at the end of this 6-month period.\n    \n-   End of Year 2 (T+27 Months):  Completion of the RFP-35 emissions program. Evaluation of the program’s impact on liquidity and community engagement. Preparation of a final report on the outcomes and potential adjustments for future incentive structures.\n    \n## Overall Impact\n\n**User Impact**:  By implementing a back-weighted emission schedule, this proposal incentivizes long-term commitment.\n\n**System Impact**: Increases protocol stability and locked liquidity.\n\n### Cost\n\n-   **Development**:  The development efforts required for this proposal will be handled by our existing salaried development team, incurring no additional charges.\n    \n-   **Operational Expenses**:  There are no new outlays for services or operational expenditures anticipated, ensuring the implementation is cost-efficient and leverages our current resource allocation effectively.\n\n## Voting\n\n**In Favor**: Agree with establishing a dynamic emission schedule as described.\n\n**Against**:  Oppose the dynamic emission schedule proposal.\n\n**Abstain**:  Remain neutral, contributing to the quorum without endorsing or opposing the change.",

      "title": "RFP-34: Onboard weETH on Ethereum & Arbitrum",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nRFP-34 proposes integrating weETH ([Ether.Fi](http://ether.fi) Liquid Restaking Token) as a full collateral and borrow market within Radiant Capital's Ethereum and Arbitrum deployments.\n\n## Motivation\n\nRadiant Capital aims to provide a decentralized platform for lending and borrowing cryptocurrencies, offering users an efficient and secure means to access financing and generate yields. As the DeFi market evolves, expanding the platform's offerings by incorporating new, high-quality assets as collateral and borrowing options is essential.\n\nweETH represents a liquid restaking derivative token that mirrors the value of staked ETH and its associated rewards. This token was created by EtherFi, which provides users with the opportunity to participate in ETH staking rewards from the Ethereum network. Wrapped tokens, such as weETH, enable the utilization of cryptocurrencies on different blockchains while remaining backed by the underlying asset.\n\nThis governance proposal seeks approval to integrate weETH as an accepted form of collateral and as a borrowing market within Radiant Capital's Ethereum and Arbitrum deployment. This expansion aligns with Radiant Capital's vision of offering its users a comprehensive and diverse set of assets.\n\nThe Risk Committee has evaluated weETH and recommended the parameters for its integration into the platform, which will be outlined below.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n-   **weETH** - Wrapped EtherFi ETH\n    \n-   **Max LTV** - The Maximum LTV ratio represents the maximum borrowing power of a specific collateral. For example, if a collateral has an LTV of 75%, the user can borrow up to 0.75 worth of ETH in the principal currency for every 1 ETH worth of collateral.\n    \n-   **Liquidation Threshold** - This represents the threshold at which a borrow position will be considered undercollateralized and subject to liquidation for each collateral. For example, if a collateral has a liquidation threshold of 80%, it means that the position will be liquidated when the debt value is worth 80% of the collateral value.\n    \n\n## Specifications\n\n-   Add weETH as a full collateral and borrow market\n    \n-   Max LTV: 72.5%\n    \n-   Liquidation Threshold: 75%\n\n-   Liquidation Bonus: 15%\n     \n-   Scale allocation points (incentive emissions) for lend and borrow markets as deposits grow for a two-week period, at which point AP will be stabilized\n    \n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n-   **Chainlink Integration:**  To list weETH, a Chainlink feed for the weETH/eETH exchange ratio must be integrated. This feed will provide accurate, real-time exchange rate data for the weETH token. You can find a similar implementation on Arbitrum through the following link:  [Chainlink Arbitrum Feed](https://data.chain.link/feeds/arbitrum/mainnet/weeth-eeth-exchange-rate), and for Ethereum: [Chainlink Ethereum Feed](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/weeth-eth).\n    \n-   **Smart Contract Implementation:** Based on the defined parameters, the Radiant team will implement the necessary updates to enable the integration of weETH as a collateral and borrow market with the parameters as laid out above. This implementation will involve coding and testing the smart contracts to ensure their functionality and security.\n    \n-   **User Interface Update:** The Radiant Capital user interface will be updated to reflect the addition of weETH as a collateral and borrow market. This includes providing users with the option to select weETH as collateral and borrow assets, as well as displaying relevant information such as weETH exchange rates, available loan options, and associated risks.\n\n## Overall Cost/Impact\n\nMinimal.\n\n## Timeline\n\nIntegration is expected to occur swiftly, subject to the following stages:\n\n-   Local Testing: The Radiant team will conduct thorough testing of the implementation in a local environment to ensure its functionality, security, and compatibility within the Ethereum and Arbitrum ecosystems.\n    \n-   Staging: Following Chainlink Feed integration, the implementation will proceed to a staging phase, where further testing will verify the integrity and functionality of the weETH collateral and borrow market.\n    \n\n## Voting\n\n-   In Favor: Supportive of RFP-34, adding weETH to the Ethereum and Arbitrum deployments of Radiant\n    \n-   Against: Against implementation of the RFP-34 proposal\n    \n-   Abstain: Undecided, but contributing to quorum",

      "content": "## Abstract\nAs Radiant Capital approaches its two-year anniversary and gears up for the launch of [Radiant v3](http://l.radiant.capital/tccS), it is important that the DAO is adequately capitalized to incentivize the introduction of dozens of new assets and facilitate expansion across additional networks.\n\n“_Situazione vantaggiosa per tutti_” is a traditional Italian phrase that translates to a “win-win situation.” \n\nAs this proposal is designed to present a beneficial scenario for all involved parties within the Radiant ecosystem, the DAO believes that this concept perfectly encapsulates the essence of RFP-33.\n\nRFP-33 seeks a strategic adjustment to the maximum RDNT token supply in response to the evolving DeFi landscape and the need for competitive yields ahead of Radiant’s v3 launch and expansion. It outlines a plan for a **potential supply increase of 50%** over the next three years, alongside the option to maintain the current supply.\n\nTo mitigate the dilutive effects from increased supply, **25% of the new tokens will be allocated to all current dLP lockers**, pending ratification. Details of the distribution mechanism and eligibility will be specified in a follow-up proposal (RFP-34).\n\nRadiant dLPs are the foundation of the protocol, providing long-term liquidity vital for its success. This measure targets compensation for currently locked dLPs, with a proposed period for users with liquid RDNT to lock in and qualify for the snapshot.\n\nWith this supply increase, **eligible dLPs would receive a stream of 125,000,000 RDNT**.\n\nThis strategy aims to boost Radiant's emissions framework for v3, support expansion across new chains, enhance opportunities for dLP lockers, and foster business development and community engagement.\n## Motivation\nThe initial one billion max supply and distribution strategy were crucial for Radiant’s rapid adoption and foundational stability. However, recognizing the dynamic nature of the DeFi landscape and the imperative to adapt, this proposal seeks to extend Radiant’s capabilities beyond the initial scope envisioned two years ago. \n\nThe decision to propose this strategic adjustment is not taken lightly and was the result of thorough deliberation among key Radiant stakeholders and advisors. The points below detail the critical factors that underscored these discussions, highlighting the need for a recalibrated approach to emissions, market responsiveness, and expansion strategies.\n### Insufficient Emissions Runway Due to Lack of Exit Penalties\n[RFP-8](http://l.radiant.capital/5MIM) was designed to extend Radiant Capital's emissions runway from two to five years by lowering monthly inflation and depending on exit fees from early RDNT withdrawals, boosting the DAO Reserve. In v1, exit fees were a key component of emissions sustainability.\n \nHowever, the introduction of a scaling exit penalty in [RFP-5](http://l.radiant.capital/lTy5) and the option to zap vesting RDNT into dLP as per [RFP-19](http://l.radiant.capital/qTLz) significantly altered user behavior, reducing exit fees to nearly zero.\n\nThe result has been a dramatic shortfall, with only 193,584 RDNT recaptured in exit fees, much less than expected, underscoring the urgent need to recalibrate to maintain emission sustainability and support expansions.\n### Increase in the “Risk-Free Rate” During Bull Markets\nDuring the v2 launch, Radiant Protocol's money market yields were highly competitive, spurring significant asset reserve growth through Q3 2023.\n\nHowever, a broader crypto market rally, including the rise of memecoins, has shifted user interest towards higher-risk investments, away from the passive income strategies offered by money markets and lending. This shift is evident in the decline in asset reserves across all chains.\n\n![](https://l.radiant.capital/tObh \"Radiant Capital reserve assets - TVL\")\n\nAdditionally, stablecoin market utilization rates have soared as users leverage on-chain, putting pressure on liquidity. To strengthen liquidity management, the DAO engaged [Chaos Labs](https://chaoslabs.xyz/) [(RFP-29)](https://l.radiant.capital/c3oz), aiming to enhance protocol resilience.\n\n_% of Time with utilizationAction > utilizationOptimal_\n\n![](https://l.radiant.capital/YjzU \"Asset Utilization Rates\")\n\n\nThis shift in market dynamics is widespread, with DeFi lending protocols across all chains experiencing similar trends. The combination of soaring asset prices, frequent airdrops, and memecoin popularity has driven the “risk-free” rate higher, challenging Radiant’s strategy of aligning emissions with a five-year plan.\n### Radiant v3 and Further Multi-Chain Expansion\nThe proliferation of Layer 2 and non-EVM platforms is expanding the DeFi ecosystem and attracting more users. To capitalize on this growth, Radiant aims to extend its reach to these emerging platforms.\n\nStrategic deployments across new chains and the support of established assets with strong risk management will draw new users, motivating them to participate in the protocol by locking dLP, lending, borrowing, and engaging in DAO governance.\n\nInitially, Radiant’s emissions plan targeted a select number of additional chains, understanding that expansion might reduce yields on existing deployments. However, with user growth now surging predominantly on platforms beyond Radiant's initial scope, maintaining competitive yields and seizing business development opportunities is crucial for ongoing relevance and success.\n### Metrics\nThe dLP mechanism stands out as **one of DeFi’s most effective incentive systems**, securing over $100M in locked LP token value, which not only benefits user-protocol interactions but also supports anticipated liquidity increases through future expansions. These efforts boost Radiant’s interoperability and accessibility across the crypto sector.\n\nCurrently, **216M RDNT tokens are locked in dLPs across three chains, amounting to nearly 50% of the circulating supply of 480M**—a consistent figure since the protocol's inception. With the potential supply increase, it's expected that no more than 50% of the total supply will be in circulation at any given time.\n\nWith the upcoming launch of Radiant v3 and further expansions, including new chains and strategic partnerships, the stability of this locking ratio is crucial for sustaining the protocol's growth and relevance.\n### Prioritizing Dynamic Liquidity Providers\nDynamic Liquidity Providers (dLPs) have been pivotal to the success of Radiant Capital since the launch of v2 in March 2023. It is essential to continue providing strong incentives for their contributions.\n\nThe initial ARB allocation from the Arbitrum DAO to Radiant was directed entirely towards dLPs, either via airdrops or streamed as platform fees.\n\nFurthermore, a significant 1.8M ARB airdrop from [Radiant’s STIP proposal](https://l.radiant.capital/Se6j) to the Arbitrum DAO specifically targeted Arbitrum dLPs, with plans for a second STIP proposal to further support dLP lockers.\n\nAmidst speculation on a [potential LayerZero airdrop](https://l.radiant.capital/eD7o), RFP-33 proposes mitigating dilution effects from increased supply by streaming 25% of any new supply to eligible dLPs over two years.\n\nShould the supply increase by **50% (500M)**, this would channel **125,000,000 RDNT** to eligible dLPs.\n## Steps to Implement\nRFP-33 proposes minting additional RDNT tokens into the RDNT DAO Reserve with a clear distribution methodology:\n### **Intended Uses:**\n   * Support RDNT emissions for launches on future chains.\n    \n    * Fund RDNT emissions for assets within the [Radiant Innovation Zone (RIZ)](https://l.radiant.capital/GsMQ) across all chains.\n    * Facilitate RDNT streams to eligible dLPs on all chains, with specifics to be defined in a follow-up RFP.\n    * Enhance incentive programs with partner protocols.\n### **Distribution Strategy:**\n   * Allocate **40%** of minted tokens to the RDNT Emissions Reserve for future chain launches and RIZ initiatives, vesting linearly over three years.\n    \n    * Allocate **60%** to the DAO Reserve for two years of RDNT streams to dLP providers, supporting future contributors, liquidity expansion, and various partner incentive programs. From this supply, eligible dLPs would receive a stream of 125,000,000 RDNT. 50% of all DAO Reserve tokens will be vesting linearly over two years. Details on the distribution mechanism, dLP locking time window, and other qualifications will be clarified in a subsequent RFP. \n    * Reserve flexibility to allocate additional tokens from the DAO Reserve for emissions, as needed, to support further deployments.\n## Cost\nThe development costs associated with the new features coming in Radiant v3 were ratified in [RFP-28](https://l.radiant.capital/MtuV). Therefore, the developmental cost to implement RFP-33 will be minimal.\n## Timeline\nRFP-33 will be implemented immediately upon ratification, enabling Radiant to accelerate new chain launches by Q3 2024.\n\nPending ratification, a tandem RFP will be initiated, proposing terms for dLP lockers to receive their share of the newly minted RDNT. This subsequent proposal (RFP-34) will detail the exact distribution mechanism, establish eligibility criteria, and define the locking period necessary for dLP lockers to qualify for their allocation. \n## Voting\n\n**In Favor:** Support a 50% increase in token supply, endorsing a strategic expansion.\n\n**Against:** Oppose any increase, favoring the retention of the current supply limit.\n\n**Abstain:** Remain neutral, contributing to the quorum without endorsing or opposing the change.",

We've collaborated with notable names in the industry, such as Aave, GMX, Benqi, dYdX, Uniswap, Maker, and many more. Discover more about our work in our [Research](https://chaoslabs.xyz/research) and [Blog](https://chaoslabs.xyz/blog) sections.\n\n- [Quantitative Interest Rate Optimization Methodology](https://chaoslabs.xyz/resources/chaos_labs_v0_quantitative_interest_rate_parameter_framework.pdf) (April ’23)\n- [Aave Stablecoin IR Curves Updates](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-stablecoin-ir-curves-updates/15838)\n- [Venus IR Curve Recommendations](https://community.venus.io/t/chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-11-14-2023/3900)\n\n### Chaos Labs & Radiant Collaboration\n\nIn [July 2023](https://community.radiant.capital/t/rfp-idea-risk-monitoring-alerting-from-chaos-labs/1012), Chaos Labs introduced the [Radiant Risk Monitoring and Alerting platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/radiant/ccar/overview).\n\nThis platform, now supporting Arbitrum, BNB, and Ethereum deployments, provides comprehensive analytics and risk assessments of the Radiant protocol. It's a vital tool for strategic decision-making, offering insights into asset distributions and usage trends.\n\n- A full video tutorial of the platform can be found [here](https://www.loom.com/share/91e130b71c3f4768be7ca8a99ae066a9?sid=5c3b482c-7ebe-4de9-a65c-45e0489d6987).\n- A product run-through can be found in our blog post [here](https://chaoslabs.xyz/posts/radiant-risk-monitoring-and-alerting-platform).\n\n![Untitled - 2024-01-09T212620.173](https://community.radiant.capital/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2720e0848eac01f70cefa2b71e2cf288aeaac64f.png)\n*Radiant Risk Hub view of Overview page*\n\n## Motivation\n\nProactive interest rate curve adjustments are essential for the robustness and success of DeFi lending and borrowing protocols. In the volatile DeFi markets, characterized by rapid and unpredictable shifts, the ability to swiftly and strategically modify interest rates is crucial. For protocols like Radiant, this adaptability is key to remaining competitive and effective in an ever-evolving environment.\n\nFrom a performance standpoint, proactive interest rate management is a significant factor in increasing a protocol's TVL and revenue. By optimizing utilization rates, it not only improves capital efficiency for suppliers but also encourages borrowing activities, contributing to the protocol’s financial growth. Additionally, these updates help Radiant to respond effectively to external market factors, keeping it in tune with the broader financial ecosystem. This ability to respond to market dynamics is critical for maintaining the protocol's appeal and competitive edge.\n\nIn essence, proactive interest rate curve updates are not just a strategic move; they are a fundamental necessity for the protocol's sustainability, competitiveness, and growth. They represent a commitment to adaptability, balance, and informed decision-making, all of which are indispensable in the fast-paced DeFi space.\n\n### Addressing the Core Challenges in Interest Rate Modeling\n\nThe current landscape of Interest Rate modeling in DeFi faces several critical challenges that our collaboration seeks to address:\n\n1. **Generic Methodologies vs. Tailored Solutions**: The prevalent use of one-size-fits-all methodologies for all assets, alongside ad-hoc solutions for specific cases, often fails to meet the diverse needs of different market segments.\n2. **Theoretical Models vs. Real-World Variability**: While existing solutions are often mathematically and logically sound, they frequently fall short in accounting for the unpredictability and variability inherent in real-life market behaviors.\n3. **Adaptability to Rapid Market Changes**: The dynamic nature of DeFi markets necessitates a more agile approach, as current models exhibit a limited ability to identify and adapt to swift changes within the industry.\n\n## Specification\n\nChaos Labs proposes a collaboration focused on proactive interest rate optimization for the Radiant protocol. Our collaborative effort is grounded in three fundamental pillars that set our approach apart:\n\n1. **Asset-Specialized Methodology for Interest Rate Modeling**: We advocate for a more nuanced and asset-specific methodology, favoring tailored models that better align with the unique characteristics of various asset classes. As an example, stablecoins are highly sensitive to interest rate changes and are influenced by market conditions similar to traditional finance. Their rate adjustments significantly affect the dynamics of other cryptocurrencies. In contrast, LSTs show minimal interest rate sensitivity due to infrequent borrowing but have a notable impact on the borrowing rates of the underlying assets they collateralize. Therefore, a standardized approach to setting interest rates for all asset classes is not effective. Instead, a more nuanced approach is essential for optimal interest rate curve configuration.\n2. **State-of-the-Art Simulation Engine**: Our partnership leverages the best-in-class simulation engine, designed to accurately model and predict market dynamics, offering a more reliable foundation for decision-making. When evaluating changes in financial parameters, it's crucial to consider their impact across various potential futures. Simulation modeling, which leverages historical data, market trends, and user behavior, is key for predicting financial market reactions and aiding risk managers in making informed decisions. Chaos Labs employs cloud simulations to conduct extensive scenario analyses that mimic on-chain behavior, providing insights into how different circumstances might affect a protocol. This approach, ensuring scalability and up-to-date data, is vital for understanding and navigating the complexities of volatile financial environments.\n   \n   ![Untitled - 2024-01-09T212624.815](https://community.radiant.capital/uploads/default/original/2X/5/562ed98d6f0624ef89ec665a9558fc608ad02f95.jpeg)\n*Simulation results for Aave market on Arbitrum, balancing usage and minimizing bad debt.*\n    \n   ![Untitled - 2024-01-09T212627.565](https://community.radiant.capital/uploads/default/original/2X/6/627c5617a3a5628a8af4a66a5c242cd2bdcee4ef.jpeg)\n*Experiment view showing detailed metrics of simulations run to better understand the risk boundaries of different alternatives.*\n    \n3. **Industry Leading Monitoring and Observability Tools**: To ensure continuous performance and adaptability, we integrate top-tier monitoring and observability tools, enabling real-time insights and proactive responses to market fluctuations. We propose expanding the existing Chaos Radiant Multi-Chain Risk Portal to support IR optimization.\n    \n![Untitled - 2024-01-09T212631.437](https://community.radiant.capital/uploads/default/original/2X/5/57c003238f5d6160bda6200a2527b229aa40cf2b.jpeg)\n *Radiant Risk Hub current view of Interest Rates and borrower distribution*\n    \n\n## Engagement Scope\n\n- **In-depth Analysis of Historical IR Data and Market Comparisons**:\n    - Rigorously research historical interest rate data across Radiant's deployments, coupled with a comprehensive competitive analysis in the market. This involves scrutinizing past interest rate trends and market responses and comparing them with competitors to identify best practices and areas for improvement.\n    - Scrutinize the existing state and recent trends within the lending markets on various Radiant deployments. Pinpoint the primary drivers of growth and articulate specific objectives for IR optimization on each deployment. This entails recognizing distinctive asset traits, user behaviors, and their influence on TVL and protocol revenue.\n- **Ongoing IR Recommendations**\n    - Chaos Labs will provide regular, data-driven recommendations for interest rate adjustments, ensuring they align with market conditions, changes in user behavior, and the protocol's strategic objectives.\n    - As our recommendations are dynamically shaped based on market conditions and protocol activity, we do not establish a predetermined schedule for updates.\n\n## Timeline\n\nAt Chaos Labs, we are dedicated to forging lasting partnerships with premier DeFi protocols. In line with this commitment, we propose a 12-month partnership with Radiant for the above scope.\n\n\n## Cost\nThe total annual cost is set at $200,000, with payment options available in either stablecoins or RDNT tokens. \n\nPayments to be made in equal quarterly installments, with each installment paid at the start of the quarter.\n\n## Voting\n**In Favor**: Support the collaboration with Chaos Labs for optimizing and decentralizing interest rate curves within the Radiant protocol.\n\n**Against**: Oppose the collaboration with Chaos Labs for this initiative.\n\n**Abstain**: Neutral or undecided, contributing to the quorum nonetheless.",

      "title": "RFP-28: Introducing Radiant v3 - Next-Gen DeFi via Radiant Innovation Zone, Enhanced Trading & More",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis proposal introduces a framework for **Radiant v3**, a collection of community-submitted proposals and ideas aimed at accelerating Radiant's growth. The vision for Radiant v3 is to achieve a potential 10x in DAUs (Daily Active Users), enhance user engagement, secure more  value within the platform, improve protocol efficiency, expand business collaborations, and elevate the overall user experience. \n\nRadiant v3 aims to revolutionize the current model by enhancing current omnichain functionality and introducing innovative features. These include the Radiant Innovation Zone for exploring more asset markets, advanced trading options like longing/shorting assets through looping, an auto-convert mechanism for protocol fees to dynamic liquidity (dLP), dual emissions in borrowing/lending markets, and dynamic protocol fee distribution during high utilization periods. \n\nFurthermore, the advanced integration of LayerZero capabilities will facilitate cross-chain loan repayments, liquidations, and streamline access to cross-chain yield opportunities.\n\nEach feature in Radiant v3 is designed to contribute uniquely to the platform's growth, solidifying Radiant's position as a more robust and user-friendly ecosystem.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe protocol optimizations and innovations introduced in Radiant v2 heralded a new era for Radiant, leading to: \n\n* 10x the number of RDNT token holders and protocol users.\n\n* #2 money market on Arbitrum in terms of TVL and #1 in DAUs.\n* #2 money market on BNB Chain and maintaining #1 in DAUs.\n* Over $85M in dLP locked between Arbitrum, Ethereum, and BNB Chain deployments with the total market size peaking at $750M.\n* More than $25M in protocol fees generated since inception.\n* Consistently ranking in the top 3 for protocol revenue across all lending protocols on all chains, despite operating on only three chains.\n\nThese milestones have strengthened the DAO’s foundation and highlighted a clear direction for future growth. Radiant v3 seeks to leverage this momentum. The introduction of innovative features outlined in this proposal is envisioned to catalyze another leap in growth. \n\nThe objective is clear: to significantly increase DAUs, expand the token holder base, boost protocol fees, and enhance the overall sustainability and appeal of the platform.\n\n## Specifications\n\n1. **Radiant Innovation Zone (RIZ) / Isolated Risk Markets**\n    * Expands token listings to include a wide range of dynamic and emerging assets, such as LSDs, RWAs, NFTs, AI, and trending memecoins. This enables users to make more calculated decisions about risk of specific assets, mitigating the broader oracle and liquidity risks inherent in a fully cross-margined protocol.\n    \n    * RIZ allows for more nuanced risk assessments in isolated pools, compared to the fully-cross margined model of Radiant v2.\n    * Offers higher yield opportunities within RIZ markets, tailored for users seeking higher returns, albeit with increased risks.\n    * Radiant will move quickly to approve and deploy new RIZ markets, thus providing first-to-market collateral and leverage opportunities for each narrative-specific asset, opening doors for **endless business development.**\n    * RIZ markets will be yield-incentivized, creating new opportunities for dLP growth and protocol fee generation. \n\n\n\n2. **Simple 1-click Long/Short Strategies via Money Market Looping**\n\n    * Facilitates native on-chain long/short positions on all Radiant assets, including those in the RIZ, through innovative use of lending market mechanics and liquidity that exists on Radiant across all chains.\n   \n    * Provides a user-friendly mechanism for complex strategies, exemplified by the “Long ETH” approach: Users can deposit ETH, borrow USDC, use the borrowed USDC to purchase more ETH, rinse and repeat. This effectively creates a leveraged 'long' position on ETH in a streamlined manner.\n    * Leverages interest rate differentials across chains, offering users the ability to capitalize on the most cost-effective opportunities.\n    * This enhances the native utility of the protocol, potentially driving significant protocol fees generation. This approach adds value to the protocol without depending solely on emissions.\n\n![alt_text](https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/uOyd6LVFAY7e.png)\n_Source: Contango Protocol_\n\n3. **Solution to RDNT Inflation & Gas-Intensive Protocol Fee Claiming**\n\n    * Radiant has generated over $25M in protocol fees to date, ranking it among the top 25 fee-generating DeFi protocols globally. However, the current user experience for claiming protocol fees on Radiant is suboptimal. It involves claiming each asset individually and withdrawing from each lending separately – a gas-intensive process that can cost hundreds of dollars on ETH Mainnet.\n    \n    * With the approval of RFP-28 and the expansion of RIZ, the number and variety of assets generating protocol fees will increase significantly, making the claiming process untenable.\n    * This proposal suggests that in the short-term, auto-compound is enabled for all users by default in order to streamline the fee claiming process. This will save users gas, allowing the protocol to batch claim fees and convert them into dLP vs. the sub-optimal experience of dealing with small amounts of individual assets. Both from a UX and cost perspective, there is an improvement to the user. \n\n\t\t_NOTE: users can easily disable the auto-compound feature with a single click._\n\n\t* This is a technically simple solution to implement, as auto-compounding is already an existing, audited feature of the protocol.\n\n   * Users will have the flexibility to auto-compound protocol fees into dLP for 3, 6, and 12-month lock periods. More details about dLP can be found [here](https://docs.radiant.capital/radiant/project-info/dlp).\n    * Additionally, RFP-28 encourages the emergence of a new, community-generated proposal to innovate and shape the future of Radiant’s fee claiming process.\n5. **Dual Emissions**\n\t * Allows Radiant to maintain competitive yields while continuing to reduce emissions. To supplement emissions reduction, the protocol can utilize secondary tokens such as ARB, token pools acquired from business development, incentives from new chain launches, and grants.\n   \n\t* Dual emissions are designed to enhance the attractiveness of the money market, striking a balance between reducing emissions and providing compelling user incentives.\n6. **Dynamic Protocol Fee Distributions**\n\t* Radiant, like many other lending protocols, experiences fluctuations in market utilization due to various factors, such as when Binance holds Launchpools, or when users are looking to take additional loans for various reasons.\n\n\t* The current mechanism of raising borrow and lending interest to normalize rates has been insufficient in attracting new lenders, partly because dLP receives 60% of the lending fees.\n\t* A novel suggestion proposed by a community member involves making the protocol fee distribution more dynamic. In high utilization periods, this approach would shift more protocol fees to the base lender pool, effectively raising lending interest rates and restoring market balance. This dynamic shift could also attract a new cohort of users who are unfamiliar with Radiant Capital, enhancing liquidity in stablecoin markets during peak demand times. \n\t* Approving RFP-28 would not put this strategy into effect - it will simply kickstart in-depth brainstorming and lead to a new proposal detailing specific mechanisms and formulas for this strategy. \n\nThe implementation of these features has the potential to significantly increase protocol fees, foster business development opportunities, and boost DAUs. Additionally, it offers a strategic approach to counteracting inflation through RDNT buybacks. \n\nThe introduction of the Radiant Innovation Zone (RIZ) is particularly impactful, as it allows the protocol to diversify its collateral assets significantly mitigating asset-specific risks for the broader user base.\n\nAs with all Radiant initiatives, this proposal remains open to further innovative contributions from the community in [Discourse](https://community.radiant.capital/). \n\n\n## Key Terms\n\n\n\n* **dLP**: Dynamic Liquidity Providers within Radiant’s ecosystem.\n* **Dual Emissions:** Implementing additional incentives for borrowing and lending activities.\n* **Long/Short Trading:** Simplified trading strategies via looping within the borrowing/lending market.\n* **Radiant Innovation Zone (RIZ):** A platform for launching isolated risk markets for new and emerging narratives in DeFi.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n1. **Develop and Approve RIZ Markets:** Establish a technical framework through DAO process for rapidly approving and deploying new RIZ markets, with a focus on various emerging narratives.\n\n3. **Implement Trading Mechanics:** Enhance the borrowing/lending market to support long/short trading using innovative on-chain mechanics.\n4. **Optimize Protocol Fee UX:** Streamline the fee claiming process by transitioning from claims on multiple assets to a simplified distribution in dLP tokens.\n5. **Integrate Dual Emissions:** Develop and implement a dual emission system, supplementing RDNT with secondary tokens.\n\n## Cost\n\n1. **Development Costs:** Resources will be allocated for designing, developing, and integrating RIZ markets, trading enhancements, and protocol fee optimizations. This includes manpower and technology costs.\n\n3. **Auditing Costs:** Essential for ensuring the security and reliability of new features like RIZ and trading mechanics.\n4. **Operational Costs:** Ongoing expenses associated with platform maintenance and upgrades.\n5. **Business Development Costs:** Expenses related to acquiring secondary tokens for dual emissions and establishing new partnerships.\n\nGiven the scope and complexity of these implementations, the estimated cost ranges from $250K - $1M. These costs are expected to be offset by the anticipated increase in protocol fees, user engagement, and overall platform growth. \n\n## Timeline \n\nMove swiftly to begin releasing v3 features in Q1 2023.\n\n## **Voting**\n\n**In favor:** Supportive of RFP-28, endorsing the decision for the DAO to implement the four protocol changes detailed in this proposal.\n\n**Against:** Opposed to the implementation of RFP-28, preventing the DAO from deploying the proposed changes.\n\n**Abstain:** Undecided, but contributing to quorum.",

      "content": "## Abstract\n\nRFP-27 seeks consensus from Radiant DAO stakeholders regarding the strategy and timeline for recapitalizing the Arbitrum lending market and repaying the excess debt in the WETH market, following the January 2nd exploit. \n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\n### Context\n\nRadiant Capital was subject to a flash loan exploit on January 2nd at 06:53:29 PM +UTC, shortly after launching the native USDC market on Arbitrum. This incident resulted in the accumulation of bad debt totaling 1,902.5927 wETH in the WETH market. In response, the Radiant DAO Council invoked the emergency administrative controls, pausing all markets on Arbitrum to mitigate any further damage. \n\nTo ensure the protocol's safety and guarantee unrestricted access to deposits for all users, **it is imperative to recapitalize the protocol and fully reimburse the bad debt**. This proposal presents various approaches to achieve this, balancing the need for financial flexibility to accelerate DAO development with the imperative of restoring complete confidence in the Arbitrum lending market.\n\n\n#### Current Treasury Balances and Assets (at current prices):\n\n\tDAO Treasury:\t\t$4,018,265\n\tARB OpEx:\t\t\t$759,987 \n\tBNB OpEx:\t\t\t$377,823\n\tETH OpEx:\t\t\t$81,921\n\tTotal:\t\t\t\t$5,237,996\n\n\n### Option 1 – Repay Bad Debt With Liquid DAO Funds & OpEx \n\n\nRadiant DAO Treasury currently holds approximately $5,236,996 in non-RDNT assets, excluding ARB tokens allocated via previous RFPs. Of this, $4,018,265 in stablecoins are deposited into Radiant to stabilize the utilization rates in USDC.e and USDT markets on Arbitrum and Ethereum deployments. Without any redemptions of rTokens, $1,219,731 remains liquid, with about $1M readily available.\n\nThe breakdown of the remaining $4,018,265 worth of stablecoins that are deposited into Radiant is as follows:\n\n\tUSDC.e (Arbitrum)\t$1,404,186 \n\tUSDT (Arbitrum)\t\t$2,008,262\n\tUSDT (Mainnet)\t\t$605,817\n\tTotal:\t\t\t\t$4,018,265\n\nUSDC.e on Arbitrum is **92.29%** utilized with **$1.03m** in available liquidity. \n\nUSDT on Arbitrum is **88.01%** utilized with **$943.17K** in available liquidity.\n\nUSDT on Mainnet is **83.9%** utilized with **$874.44K** in available liquidity.\n\nIf the DAO were to liquidate each position and bring all three markets to 100% utilization, that would free up $2,578,987.\n\nHowever, it is the opinion of advisors and community members that a lending protocol should avoid scenarios where multiple stablecoin markets are 100% utilized, as this is highly detrimental to the protocol’s financial health. To mitigate this, **Option 1 proposes to use $1M from the DAO’s treasury combined with $1M in OpEx funds for the immediate purchase of approximately 50% of the 1,900 ETH loss**.\n\nShould utilization rates fall below 80% again, the DAO will continue to withdraw additional stablecoins and convert them into ETH, further reducing the bad debt.\n\n\nCurrently, Radiant generates roughly $500,000 USD per month in protocol fees, equivalent to approximately 200 ETH at current prices. This option proposes that Radiant allocates 80% of its monthly OpEx towards covering the remaining bad debt. This repayment is estimated to take about two months at the current ETH price and protocol fee generation rate, and includes provisions for the potential withdrawal of more stablecoins in the future.\n\n\n### Option 2 – Same as Option 1 With DAO Reimbursement Through RDNT Token Sales Over One Year\n\n\nThis option mirrors Option 1's actions but includes **reimbursing the DAO Treasury with ETH obtained from selling RDNT tokens over a 1-year period**.\n\nGiven the exploit value of 1,902 ETH (valued at $4,300,000 at the time of writing), this would involve the DAO selling approximately $360K of RDNT tokens per month over a 12-month period. For context, the RDNT token did approximately ~$1.3bn in total volume over the last 30 days, of which $360K would represent a mere 0.02% of total trading volume on a monthly basis.\n\nOption 2 aims to ensure the Radiant DAO’s continued growth and ability to expand its core contributors, aligning with its vision of becoming the leading cross-chain money market in DeFi.\n\nMost vendors, employees, contractors and partners require payment in stablecoins. The benefit of Option 2 is that it maintains a healthy stablecoin reserve for the DAO, facilitating continued expansion.\n\n\n### Option 3 - Abstain & Return to Drawing Board\n\n**Option 3 is for DAO community members who disagree with the proposed solutions and prefer to explore alternative strategies.** A subsequent proposal would be brought forth within 48 hours after discussion on both [Discourse](https://community.radiant.capital/) and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/radiantcapital).\n\n\n## Key Terms\n\n* **Bad debt:** Refers to a situation where a loan cannot be repaid because the value of the collateral securing the loan has fallen below the amount owed.\n\n* **dLP:** Dynamic Liquidity Providers within the Radiant ecosystem.\n* **Flash loan:** An uncollateralized loan in decentralized finance (DeFi) that must be issued and repaid within the same transaction block on a blockchain. \n* **OpEx:** Short for Operating Expenses, this term refers to the ongoing costs associated with running a business on a day-to-day basis. \n\n\n## Specifications\n\n**Debt Repayment Amounts:** This section details the exact amounts of WETH to be repurchased monthly for debt repayment.\n\n**Treasury Allocation:** A breakdown of the treasury assets to be utilized for the purpose of debt repayment.\n\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n\n### Options 1 & 2:\n\n\n\n* Liquidate necessary treasury assets to purchase WETH.\n\n* Execute block WETH trades on Ethereum to minimize slippage and MEV.\n* Distribute Repayment Funds to `0x789145aB5C5FAF652094A4B0BC6B639E150330d1` (Repayment MultiSig).\n* Allocate 80% of monthly OPEX towards remaining bad debt repayment.\n* Implement team salary adjustments accordingly.\n* Execute RepayBehalf function for excess debt on user `0x826d5f4d8084980366f975e10db6c4cf1f9dde6d` until 1,902.5927 WETH is repaid.\n\nFor Option 2, schedule monthly RDNT token sales through an OTC counterpart and manage ETH reimbursements.\n\n\n### Option 3:\n\n* Gather community feedback for new proposals.\n\n* Develop and present alternative strategies based on member input.\n\n\n## Overall Cost/Impact\n\n1,902.59 ETH, or USD equivalent.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\n### For Option 1 - Immediate Repayment With Liquid DAO Funds & OPEX\n\n\n\n* **Jan 10, 2024:** Commence the first debt repayment phase by liquidating $2,000,000 in stablecoins to purchase 880 ETH, covering 46% of the bad debt.\n\n* **Feb 2024 to Apr 2024:** Over the next 3 months, allocate 80% of monthly OPEX (~200 ETH per month) towards the remaining bad debt.\n* **Accelerated Excess Debt Repayment Potential:** Should additional liquidity enter the USDC.e and USDT markets on Radiant, increased withdrawals of stablecoins will be possible, enabling a swifter repayment of the outstanding debt.\n\n\n### For Option 2 - DAO Reimbursement Through RDNT Token Sales\n\n* **Jan 10, 2024:** Begin the first phase of debt repayment similarly to Option 1.\n\n* **Feb 2024 to Jan 2025:** Implement RDNT token sales to reimburse the DAO treasury. Approximately $360K of RDNT tokens will be sold each month over a 12-month period.\n\n* **Monthly Review:** Continuously monitor and adjust the token sale strategy to ensure minimal market impact and optimal replenishment of DAO funds.\n\n\n### For Option 3 - Abstain & Return to Drawing Board\n\n* **Immediate Action:** If Option 3 is chosen, promptly initiate a community feedback phase to explore new solutions.\n\n* **Proposal Development:** Aim to present alternative strategies within 48 hours, based on community input and discussions.\n\n\n### General Notes\n\n* **Market Conditions:** The timeline is subject to change based on market conditions, liquidity, and unforeseen issues related to the execution of the repayment plan.\n\n* **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring and adjustment of the plan will be essential to ensure effective debt repayment while maintaining the operational stability of the DAO.\n\n\n## Voting\n\n**Option 1:** Use existing DAO assets for a swift debt repayment process.\n\n**Option 2:** Same as Option 1, but also in support of replenishing the DAO's treasury through a structured sale of RDNT tokens.\n\n**Option 3:** Abstain and revisit within 48 hours upon conclusion of RFP-27 vote process.",

      "title": "RFP-26: Adding Native USDC & Sunsetting USDC.e",
      "content": "This proposal seeks approval to add native USDC as collateral in the Radiant money market, alongside USDC.e until the option to sunset USDC.e is available, contingent on Stargate's support for native USDC.\n\n## Abstract\n\nWith [Gauntlet’s](https://www.gauntlet.xyz/) leadership and guidance, the Arbitrum community seeks to transition its USDC.e stablecoin usage into USDC. It aims to deprecate bridged tokens in favor of native tokens.  The Radiant Capital protocol is currently employing Stargate to support its omnichain use cases, so there is a dependency on Stargate’s support native USDC. Stargate doesn’t currently support native USDC and will likely need to go through its DAO governance to garner support to swap out USDC.e. Since sunsetting USDC.e from the Radiant money market in favor of native USDC isn’t an available option at this point, this proposal seeks approval from the Radiant DAO to add native USDC as an alternative option to USDC.e.  \n\nThis proposal seeks approval for two sequential phases:\n\n\n\n* **Phase 1:  Adding native USDC alongside USDC.e in the money market**\n* **Phase 2:  Sunsetting USDC.e when the option is available (contingent on Stargate supporting native USDC)**\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nNative tokens offer reduced dependencies compared to bridged tokens like USDC.e, which rely on the dynamics of bridges and other chains. Unlike USDC.e, which is [deployed by the Arbitrum Foundation](https://arbiscan.io/token/0xff970a61a04b1ca14834a43f5de4533ebddb5cc8#tokenInfo), native USDC is deployed by CENTRE and depends solely on Circle's management of reserves.\n\nBridged assets, as demonstrated by incidents like the Multichain MPC bridge hack, carry technical and security risks. These incidents underscore the importance of not only robust security measures but also comprehensive risk management in the migration process. As Circle and Gauntlet transition to native USDC, leading to reduced USDC.e liquidity, there's a growing imperative for money markets that support USDC.e to adapt.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis proposal aligns with Radiant’s objectives to add omnichain utility for protocol assets and unify cross-chain liquidity, while addressing these relevant risks:\n\n\n\n1. **Price**: Risk of asset prices moving unfavorably.\n2. **Liquidity**: Risk of being unable to buy/sell assets in an expected fashion.\n3. **Volatility**: Risk of unexpected price changes.\n4. **Flow**: Risk associated with asset flow and redemption requests.\n5. **Credit**: Risk of counterparty failure.\n\n\n## Key Terms \n\n**Native USDC**:  Circle’s dollar-backed stablecoin, now cross-chain enabled, supported by CCTP.\n\n**USDC.e**:  Unofficial, bridged versions of USDC utilized across the blockchain ecosystem.  Circle products do not support USDC.e.\n\n**CCTP**:  Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), a permissionless on-chain utility that facilitates USDC transfers securely between blockchains via native burning and minting. This enables USDC to flow natively across blockchains – unifying liquidity in Web3 and simplifying the user experience.\n\n**Max LTV:**  The maximum loan-to-value ratio indicating the highest possible borrowing power of a specific collateral. For example, if a collateral has an LTV of 75%, the user can borrow up to 0.75 worth of ETH in the principal currency for every 1 ETH worth of collateral.\n\n**Liquidation Threshold (LT):**  The threshold at which a borrow position will be considered undercollateralized and subject to liquidation for each collateral. For example, if a collateral has a liquidation threshold of 80%, the position will be liquidated when the debt value is worth 80% of the collateral value.\n\n\n## Specifications\n\nThese specifications lay the groundwork for an orderly transition, ensuring that Radiant's response is aligned with industry standards and protects user interests.\n\n\n### **Phase 1:  Add native USDC within 30 days of ratification**\n\n\n\n* Secure a Chainlink price feed for native USDC\n* Add native USDC as full collateral and borrow market\n* **Max LTV: 80%**\n* **Liquidation Threshold: 85%**\n* Scale allocation points (incentive emissions) for lend and borrow markets as deposits grow for a two-week period, at which point AP will be stabilized\n\n\n### **Phase 2:  Sunset USDC.e within 60 days from the date of Stargate native USDC support**\n\n\n\n* **Initial actions for USDC.e market:**\n    * **Tuning Allocation Points**: Reduce allocation points to zero.\n    * **Withdrawal Only**: Set the USDC.e market to a \"withdraw only\" state on the user interface, effective sixty (60) days after the date of Stargate native USDC support..\n    * **Cease Borrowing**: Ensure that no further borrowing of USDC.e is permitted.\n    * **Freezing the Market**: Implement necessary contract changes to prevent additional collateralization using USDC.e.\n* **Wind down USDC.e**\n    * **Communication and Notifications**: Develop and disseminate clear communication to users about the status of USDC.e, including the timeline and instructions for withdrawal.\n    * **Emissions**: Terminate RDNT emissions for all USDC.e positions.\n* **Final removal of USDC.e**\n* **Removal from Supported Assets**: Complete the removal of USDC.e from the list of supported assets within Radiant's frontend.\n* **UI Adjustment for USDC.e Withdrawal**: After removal from the main markets page, modify the user interface to add a distinct section where users can withdraw their remaining USDC.e funds. This area will facilitate continued access to withdrawal, separate from the main markets interface.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n\n\n**Phase 1:**\n1. Add native USDC as collateral within 30 days of ratification.\n\n**Phase 2:**\n1. **Short-term action**: Upon ratification, tune allocation points down to 0 for USDC.e, following a seven (7) day grace period.\n\n2. **Sixty (60) days after ratification**: Set USDC.e to \"withdraw only\" status on the Radiant UI.\n3. **Final removal:** Coordinate the removal of USDC.e from supported assets in compliance with the wind-down plan.\n\n\n## Overall Cost/Impact\n\n\n\n* **User Impact:** Guidance is required for users with USDC.e positions.\n* **System Impact**: Modifications to Radiant's protocols and interfaces.\n* **Legal & Compliance Considerations**: Alignment with [recommendations from Gauntlet](https://community.radiant.capital/t/proposal-gauntlet-usdc-e-migration-parameter-adjustment-recommendation/1478?u=gauntlet), who is advising the Arbitrum DAO in the overall USDC.e transition strategy.\n* **Costs**: Minimal, primarily internal resource allocation for technical implementation and communication.\n\n\n## Voting\n\n\n\n* **In Favor:** In support of proposed steps to add native USDC & sunset USDC.e\n* **Against:** Against implementation of RFP-26\n* **Abstain:** Undecided, but contributing to quorum",

      "title": "RFP-25: Equitable Utilization of Strategic ARB Reserve for Incentives Across Mainnet and Arbitrum",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nAcknowledging that [RFP-24](https://dao.radiant.capital/#/proposal/0xc6096060290a19c6e7a7c1460fced93160318b46ddb860808412eb1439030be1) did not reach consensus within the Radiant DAO, this revised proposal aims to address the feedback received from the community. \n\nFor clarity, **this proposal is unrelated to Radiant’s recent qualification for the Arbitrum Foundation's Short Term Incentives Program**, and focuses on utilizing the remaining portion of the initial ARB grant received in March 2023.\n\nRFP-25 serves as an extension of [RFP-18](https://dao.radiant.capital/#/proposal/0x098762ed9d2d959596d642ea3180243fa7cb6ae7a85a58145e296c16d559351d) and aims to further stabilize and grow the Radiant protocol’s liquidity pools. RFP-18 codified the Radiant DAO’s plan for the initial allocation of 3,348,026 ARB tokens granted to Radiant by the Arbitrum Foundation. As per the ratified terms: \n\n\n\n* 40% was successfully allocated to Starfleet Season 1, an airdrop period for new dLP lockers.\n\n* 30% was earmarked for distribution to all Arbitrum lockers as token incentives via the MFD over a 52-week period. This distribution was implemented into the protocol and is [currently ongoing](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x8bd411c68412ed0864c4ccd7f45eed6bf2bdf99004d5aebb0772d169284e6734).\n* 30% of the original ARB allocation (amounting to 1,004,408 tokens) was earmarked for strategic future use. The application of this strategic reserve is what is currently under discussion.\n\nThis proposal aims to leverage the Radiant DAO’s remaining strategic ARB reserve to balance rewards between attracting new dLP lockers and rewarding existing contributors, thereby fostering both short-term and long-term protocol vitality.\n\n## Feedback Summary and Response\n\nThe DAO community expressed various concerns about RFP-24, primarily focusing on equitable distribution and allocation. \n\nSpecific feedback highlighted that the proposal was skewed in favor of new dLP lockers and did not adequately reward existing contributors. There was also concern about using Arbitrum-related incentives disproportionately for Mainnet. \n\nIn response, **RFP-25 aims to strike a balance by introducing a 50/50 split**: half of the Strategic ARB Reserve will incentivize new Mainnet locks, and the other half will be streamed as platform fees to all Arbitrum dLP lockers over the next 52 weeks. Given the current high gas costs on Mainnet, the first portion of the split also serves as an implicit gas reimbursement incentive for users locking assets on Mainnet.\n\n\n##  Motivation\n\nThe successful implementation of Starfleet Season 1 saw substantial growth in new dLP lockers, especially for 6-month and 1-year locks. \n\nFollowing the ratification of [RFP-19](https://dao.radiant.capital/#/proposal/0xe1fb6cf6462394ba0002e2c64eb7f645862a22595faef78f35ede71f3f4579ab), Radiant is in the final stages of deploying the protocol to Mainnet. With this in mind, the DAO has the opportunity to further incentivize long-term commitments by utilizing the final 30% of the initial ARB allocation standing by in the strategic reserve.\n\nThe DAO should consider the value of rewarding existing users of Radiant while concurrently attracting whitespace users, bootstrapping the expansion by incentivizing dLP liquidity and TVL.\n\nRFP-25 proposes to utilize the 1,004,408 ARB tokens earmarked for the strategic reserve as follows:\n* **50% (502,204 tokens) - Long-term Incentives:** To be distributed as platform fees to all Arbitrum dLP lockers over the next 52 weeks, following the usual multiplier rates based on locking length.\n\n* **50% - Starfleet Season 2**: Extend the Starfleet initiative to new lockers who commit to long-term dLP locks on Mainnet, thereby harmonizing with the previously passed RFP-18. In accordance with our branding and prior initiative, this will be referred to as Starfleet Season 2. This action is proposed to fortify our Mainnet presence and capture more long-term value for the Radiant ecosystem.\n\n\n## Key Terms\n\n\n\n* **ARB:** The governance token of the Arbitrum Foundation.\n* **dLP:** Dynamic Liquidity Providers within Radiant’s ecosystem.\n* **Snapshot window:** A specific time period determined by block height for measuring on-chain activities. Please note, this term is not to be confused with “[snapshot.org](http://snapshot.org/),” the on-chain governance system.\n* **Starfleet:** Term used to identify a group of users that the DAO aims to incentivize due to their commitment and vested interest in Radiant’s long-term performance. Not directly tied to the Discord “Starfleet” role in economic terms.\n* **Starfleet Season 2:** An extension of the original Starfleet initiative. The proposed designated timeframe following Radiant’s launch, designed to incentivize long-term dLP locks on Ethereum Mainnet.\n\n\n## Specifications\n\n\n### Long-term Incentives\n\n50% of the remaining strategic reserve (502,204 ARB) to be distributed to all Arbitrum dLP lockers over the next 52 weeks. This will be executed via the protocol’s MultiFeeDistributor contract, the same mechanism used to distribute all other token incentives.\n\n### Starfleet Season 2\n\n50% of the remaining strategic reserve (502,204 ARB) to be utilized for Starfleet Season 2, an airdrop period designed to incentivize long-term dLP locks on Ethereum Mainnet.\n\n\n#### Snapshot Window\n\n* The snapshot is targeted to commence immediately upon Radiant’s launch on Mainnet, with a contingency window of up to 72 hours for unforeseen circumstances. The start time will be publicly announced.\n\n* The snapshot window will conclude within 30 to 60 days from opening.\n* In order to prevent manipulation, the exact duration of the snapshot window will remain undisclosed until it ends.\n\n\n#### Qualifying Wallets\n\n* All wallets which lock or relock dLP on Mainnet within the snapshot window will be eligible for the airdrop.\n\n* Like Season 1, only 12-month and 6-month dLP locks will qualify for Season 2.\n* Only dLP locked directly via the Radiant protocol will be eligible. dLP locked through a third-party yield aggregator will not directly qualify. The distribution of ARB to dLP locked through third parties is left to the discretion of those protocols.\n\n\n#### Distribution\n* The strategic reserve of ARB tokens in the RDNT DAO Treasury (502,204 tokens) to be allocated to Starfleet Season 2.\n\n* The airdrop distribution ratio will be implemented in the same manner as the DAO-approved airdrop distribution specifications for Starfleet Season 1.\n    * As per [RFP-21](https://dao.radiant.capital/#/proposal/0x3ce311fafd8e5db5f8d055515eea17d3bc8c8312440e039effca885c0e9380da), the allocation ratio for 12-month locks will be three times that of 6-month locks. This option rewards long-term commitment to the protocol.\n* Eligibility for the window is specific to Ethereum Mainnet lock events, but the qualifying ARB airdrop can only be claimed on Arbitrum.\n\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n**For ARB distributed linearly over the next year to all Arbitrum dLP lockers:**\n\nIn addition to the 19,315 ARB tokens already being distributed weekly to the MultiFeeDistributor as per RFP-18, the DAO will commence a new 52-week period in which an additional 9,657.77 ARB tokens are allocated per week. This amount represents 1/52 of the 50% split of the strategic reserve.\n\nThe MultiFeeDistributor will then disburse the ARB tokens in the same manner as it currently distributes protocol fees.\n\n**For Starfleet Season 2:**\n\n1. Snapshot window will commence as per terms outlined above\n\n2. The snapshot window will conclude within 30 to 60 days from opening\n3. A list of eligible wallets will be pulled, accounting for:\n    * 6-month & 12-month lockers from within the qualifying block range\n    * Total amount locked per duration\n    * Applied allocation weighting\n4. Integration of the Starfleet Season 2 airdrop into Radiant’s frontend\n\n\n## Overall Cost/Impact\n\nDevelopmental costs and effort are relatively minimal, given that the framework for the Season 1 airdrop, redistribution approach and claim page is already in place.\n\nAnticipated impact includes stabilizing and growing Radiant’s Mainnet liquidity, while enhancing the protocol’s overall ecosystem vitality across all supported chains, through the utilization of the DAO’s strategic ARB reserve.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n1. Upon ratification, a new 52-week cycle will commence in which an additional 9,657.77 ARB per week will be linearly distributed via the MFD.\n\n2. Starfleet Season 2 will be coordinated to commence with Radiant’s launch on Mainnet, with the snapshot period opening no later than 72 hours after launch.\n3. The snapshot window will conclude within 30 to 60 days from opening.\n4. Upon closing, the eligible block window will be announced retroactively.\n5. The Radiant app will be updated to allow users to check their Season 2 eligibility.\n6. The ARB airdrop will subsequently be distributed to all eligible wallets in the same manner as Season 1.\n\n\n## **Voting**\n\n* **In Favor:** Supportive of, agreeing to use the Radiant DAO’s strategic ARB reserve as proposed\n* **Against:** Against implementation of RFP-25\n* **Abstain:** Undecided, but contributing to quorum",

      "title": "RFP-24: Incentivizing Long-Term dLP Locks on Mainnet Using Strategic ARB Reserve",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\n[RFP-18](https://dao.radiant.capital/#/proposal/0x098762ed9d2d959596d642ea3180243fa7cb6ae7a85a58145e296c16d559351d) codified the Radiant DAO’s plan for the ARB tokens granted to Radiant by the Arbitrum Foundation. As per the ratified terms, 30% of the original ARB allocation (amounting to 1,004,408 tokens) was earmarked for strategic use.\n\nThis proposal aims to leverage the Radiant DAO's remaining strategic ARB reserve to incentivize additional long-term dLP locks on Ethereum Mainnet. This is an extension of RFP-18 and aims to further stabilize and grow the Radiant protocol's liquidity pools.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe successful implementation of RFP-18, saw substantial growth in new dLP lockers, especially for 6-month and 1-year locks. Now, with a significant amount of ARB standing by in the strategic reserve, the DAO has the opportunity to further incentivize long-term commitments.\n\nFollowing the ratification of [RFP-19](https://dao.radiant.capital/#/proposal/0xe1fb6cf6462394ba0002e2c64eb7f645862a22595faef78f35ede71f3f4579ab), Radiant is in the final stages of deploying the protocol to Mainnet. The DAO should consider the strategic value of attracting whitespace users, bootstrapping the expansion by incentivizing dLP liquidity and TVL.\n\nRFP-24 proposes to extend the Starfleet initiative to new lockers who commit to long-term dLP locks on Mainnet, thereby harmonizing with the previously passed RFP-18. In accordance with our branding and prior initiative, this will be referred to as **Starfleet Season 2**. This action is proposed to fortify our Mainnet presence and capture more long-term value for the Radiant ecosystem.\n\n## Key Terms\n* **ARB**: The governance token of the Arbitrum Foundation.\n* **dLP**: Dynamic Liquidity Providers within Radiant’s ecosystem.\n* **Snapshot window**: A specific time period determined by block height for measuring on-chain activities. Please note, this term is not to be confused with \"snapshot.org,\" the on-chain governance system.\n* **Starfleet**: Term used to identify a group of users that the DAO aims to incentivize due to their commitment and vested interest in Radiant’s long-term performance. Not directly tied to the Discord “Starfleet” role in economic terms.\n* **Starfleet Season 2**: An extension of the original Starfleet initiative. The proposed designated timeframe following Radiant's launch, designed to incentivize long-term dLP locks on Ethereum Mainnet.\n\n## Specifications\n### Snapshot Window\n* The snapshot is targeted to commence immediately upon Radiant's launch on Ethereum Mainnet, with a contingency window of up to 72 hours for unforeseen circumstances. The start time will be publicly announced.\n\n* The snapshot window will conclude within 30 to 60 days from opening.\n\n* In order to prevent manipulation, the exact duration of the snapshot window will remain undisclosed until it ends.\n\n### Qualifying Wallets\n\n* All wallets which lock or relock dLP on Ethereum Mainnet within the snapshot window will be eligible for the airdrop.\n\n* Like Season 1, only 12-month and 6-month dLP locks will qualify for Season 2.\n\n* Only dLP locked directly via the Radiant protocol will be eligible. dLP locked through a third-party yield aggregator will not directly qualify.

This option rewards long-term commitment to the protocol.\n \n* Eligibility for the window is specific to Ethereum Mainnet lock events, but the qualifying ARB airdrop can only be claimed on Arbitrum.\n\n\n## Steps to Implement\n1.

Starfleet Season 2 snapshot window to commence alongside Radiant's Mainnet launch, with a contingency window of up to 72 hours; start time to be publicly announced.\n\n2. The snapshot window will conclude within 30 to 60 days from opening.\n\n3. Upon closing, the eligible block window will be announced retroactively.\n\n4.

      "title": "RFP-23: Delisting BUSD as a Supported Asset",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nRFP-23 seeks to obtain approval from Radiant DAO stakeholders for the planned removal of BUSD (Binance USD) as a supported asset in Radiant's money market on the BNB Chain. This proposal comes in response to the forthcoming wind-down of BUSD as announced by Binance and Paxos.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs Paxos has [halted the creation](https://cointelegraph.com/news/paxos-to-stop-minting-busd-stablecoins-for-binance) of new BUSD tokens, the circulating supply of BUSD will progressively decline to zero. This will be further influenced by an expected wind-down state by February 2024, during which Paxos has confirmed that BUSD redemptions will be honored. \n\nRecognizing this trajectory, Binance has advised lending protocols, including Radiant, to begin the gradual delisting of BUSD. This includes stopping borrowing, freezing the market, and ceasing liquidity mining on the market. RFP-23 is designed to proactively prepare the Radiant DAO for the impending wind-down of BUSD, aligning our strategy with the broader industry response.\n\n\n## Key Terms\n\n\n\n* **Allocation points**: Parameters that determine asset distribution and rewards within the Radiant protocol.\n* **BUSD**: Binance USD, a stablecoin issued and managed by Paxos.\n\n\n## Specifications\n\n\n### Short-Term Actions for BUSD Market\n\n\n\n* **Tuning Allocation Points:** Reduce allocation points to zero.\n* **Withdrawal Only:** Set the BUSD market to a \"withdraw only\" state on the user interface, effective thirty (30) days after ratification.\n* **Cease Borrowing:** Ensure that no further borrowing of BUSD is permitted.\n* **Freezing the Market:** Implement necessary contract changes to prevent additional collateralization using BUSD.\n\n\n### Transition to Wind-Down Phase\n* **Communication and Notifications:** Develop and disseminate clear communication to users about the status of BUSD, including the timeline and instructions for withdrawal.\n* **Emissions:** Terminate RDNT emissions for all BUSD positions. \n\n\n### Final Removal\n* **Removal from Supported Assets:** Complete the removal of BUSD from the list of supported assets within Radiant's front end.\n* **UI Adjustment for BUSD Withdrawal:** After removal from the main markets page, modify the user interface to add a distinct section where users can withdraw their remaining BUSD funds. This area will facilitate continued access to withdrawal, separate from the main markets interface.\n\nThese specifications lay the groundwork for an orderly transition, ensuring that Radiant's response is aligned with industry standards and protects user interests.\n\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n\n1. **Short-term action:** Upon ratification, tune allocation points down to 0 for BUSD, following a seven (7) day grace period.\n2. **Thirty (30) days after ratification**: Set BUSD to \"withdraw only\" status on the Radiant UI.\n3. **Final removal:** Coordinate the removal of BUSD from supported assets with compliance to Binance's broader wind-down plan.\n\n\n## Overall Cost/Impact\n\n\n\n* User Impact: Guidance required for users with BUSD positions.\n* System Impact: Modifications to Radiant's protocols and interfaces.\n* Legal & Compliance Considerations: Alignment with Binance's recommendations and legal requirements.\n* Costs: Minimal, primarily internal resource allocation for technical implementation and communication.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\nImplementation of allocation points adjustment no sooner than seven (7) days after ratification, followed by a withdrawal-only phase to be implemented no sooner than thirty (30) days after ratification, leading to final removal.\n\n\n## Voting\n\n**In Favor:** Supportive of RFP-23, agreeing to sunset BUSD as a supported asset on BNB Chain.\n\n**Against:** Against the implementation of RFP-23, opposing the removal of BUSD.\n\n**Abstain:** Undecided, but contributing to quorum.",

      "title": "RFP-22: Radiant Token Gating for Governance Consensus",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nRFP-22 seeks to obtain an updated consensus from the Radiant DAO on the token gating thresholds for Discourse governance workflow.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe governance process of the Radiant DAO consists of two stages: Discourse and Snapshot. While our Snapshot vote strategy has been successfully updated to reflect the token balance of users within the Radiant v2 ecosystem, the Discourse side of the workflow was held up by a required overhaul to our token gating mechanism in order to accurately calculate vote power based on the updated system.\n\nTo address this issue, the Radiant team has explored different approaches and has successfully pivoted to using SIWE (Sign-In With Ethereum) architecture, which allows for the reinstatement of token gating on the Discourse platform.\n\nThis proposal aims to seek consensus on whether to maintain the original fixed RDNT amount for token gating or to recalibrate to a new fixed-point based on $100 USD value. The cutoff for DAO Membership, which remains at 1 RDNT, will not be affected. \n \nThe DAO should balance the goal of inclusivity with the need for proposals to come from individuals who have a meaningful stake in the Radiant ecosystem. The DAO will need to carefully weigh the pros and cons of both approaches to determine the most suitable token gating mechanism for the future of Radiant's governance.\n\n\n## Key Terms\n\n\n\n* **DAO Author**: Users who hold a predetermined amount of tokens (to be defined in this proposal) within the Radiant ecosystem and have verified their wallet on Discourse, granting them the ability to submit new RFP drafts for DAO consideration.\n* **DAO Member**: Users who hold at least 1 RDNT token and have verified their wallet, granting them permission to comment and propose feedback on active RFP drafts.\n* **Simple Moving Average (SMA):** A calculation of the average of a range of prices by the number of periods within that range.\n* **Sign in with Ethereum (SIWE):** A decentralized authentication method where users can access services or applications by connecting their Ethereum wallet, enabling secure and user-controlled identity verification on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe DAO Snapshot strategy currently calculates a user’s actionable vote weight based on the summed total amount of user’s _realized_ RDNT throughout the v2 ecosystem.\n\n**Included:**\n\n* Loose RDNT\n* Fully-vested RDNT which has not yet been claimed\n* The RDNT portion of loose dLP \n* The RDNT portion of dLP locked within the Radiant protocol\n\n**Not included:**\n\n* Currently vesting (unrealized) v2 RDNT\n* dLP staked in third-party contracts\n* v1 RDNT\n\nThe Discourse token gating strategy has been retooled to reflect this system. What remains to be determined is the actual cutoff threshold for community-led RFP authorship.\n\n**Maintain Original Fixed RDNT Amount:** Uphold the requirement of at least **2500 RDNT** tokens for RFP authorship.\n\n\n**Recalibrate to Original Value:** Set the RFP authorship requirement to a RDNT value of $100 USD, calculated based on a simple 30-day average of the RDNT token closing price leading up to this proposal. As of 24-July 2023, the 30-day simple moving average price of RDNT is $0.29. The token cutoff would be 344.83 RDNT tokens, equivalent to $100 USD in value. \n\nFor simplicity, this proposal option will be rounded to a **345 RDNT** token cutoff. \n\nThis is a *fixed-point amount*, to remain in effect until readdressed via subsequent RFPs.\n\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nIf RFP-22 passes, the Radiant team will update the token gating mechanism on the Discourse platform based on the consensus reached by the DAO. This will involve modifying the authentication system and ensuring the accurate calculation of token balances.\n\n\n## Overall Cost/Impact\n\nThe implementation of RFP-22 is a low-effort task, as the necessary groundwork for custom Snapshot strategy and the transition to SIWE authentication have already been completed. The impact of this proposal lies in the potential increase in the number of RFP authors and the reduction of the barrier to submission for RFPs, which may require additional resources from the Radiant team to handle any potential influx of proposals.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\nTo be implemented upon ratification.\n\n\n## Voting\n\n**Uphold Original Token Gate:** Uphold the requirement of at least **2500 RDNT** tokens for DAO authorship.\n\n**Recalibrate Token Gate:** Adjust the RFP authorship requirement to at least **345 RDNT** tokens for DAO authorship.\n\n**Abstain:** Undecided, but contributing to quorum.",

      "title": "RFP-21: Distribution Strategy for ARB Allocation",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nRFP-21 seeks consensus from Radiant DAO stakeholders on the airdrop distribution mechanics between 6-month and 12-month locks for the ARB allocation received through RFP-18. \n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\n### Context\n\nAs per [RFP-18](https://dao.radiant.capital/#/proposal/0x098762ed9d2d959596d642ea3180243fa7cb6ae7a85a58145e296c16d559351d), the ARB allocation of 3,348,026 tokens received by the Radiant DAO treasury was earmarked to incentivize engagement and liquidity within the Radiant ecosystem. The proposal ratified allocating up to 40% of these tokens as an airdrop to new 6-month and 12-month dLP lockers.\n\nTo enact this, an airdrop window was implemented between **May 17 17:00 UTC** and **July 17 18:00 UTC**. The block range is as follows:\n\n \n\n**ARB**: [#91675675](https://arbiscan.io/block/91675675) - [#112210150](https://arbiscan.io/block/112210150)\n\n**BNB**: [#28294775](https://www.bscscan.com/block/28294775) - [#30048350](https://www.bscscan.com/block/30048350)\n\n### Qualifying Wallets\n\nAll wallets which locked or relocked dLP within the block heights above on either Arbitrum & BNB Chain are initially eligible for the airdrop.\n\nTo further refine the allocation strategy, RFP-21 aims to determine:\n\n1. Distribution ratio between 6-month and 12-month locks\n\n2. Appropriate airdrop cutoffs for dLP locked within the eligible airdrop window\n\n\n## Key Terms\n\n\n\n* **Airdrop window:** The period of time between **May 17 2023, 17:00 UTC** and **July 17 2023, 18:00 UTC**.\n* **ARB:** The governance token of the Arbitrum Foundation.\n* **dLP:** Dynamic Liquidity Providers within the Radiant ecosystem.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Weight Options\n\n**2.5x weight:** The airdrop allocation to 12-month locks would be **2.5 times** that of 6-month locks. This is in line with the current APR multiplier weight respective to 6-month and 12-month locks.\n\n**3x weight:** The airdrop allocation to 12-month locks would be **three times** that of 6-month locks. This option rewards long-term commitment to the protocol. \n\n### Airdrop Claim\nAll qualifying locks on Arbitrum and BNB Chain networks are eligible, but please note that the airdrop will only be claimable on Arbitrum.\n\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n* _(completed)_ Airdrop UI\n* _(completed)_ User addresses sortable by:\n    * List of lockers on both chains\n    * Amount locked per duration for each chain\n* Apply allocation weight from RFP-21\n* Parse into final userlist for smart contract linkup\n* Testing & deployment\n\n\n## Overall Cost/Impact\n\nMinimal. ARB allocation has already been earmarked by the DAO.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\n**21-Jul – 27-Jul:** Create smart contract with placeholder weighting formula & ARB values\n\n**24-Jul – 29-Jul:** RFP-21 to determine airdrop weighting\n\n**29-Jul – 30-Jul:** Apply final weighting and formula to userlist; testing & staging \n\n**30-Jul:** Deploy\n\n_Note: timeline is estimated and subject to change based on any unforeseen issues._\n\n\n## Voting\n\n**A:** In favor of **2.5x** weight between 6 month and 12 month eligible locks\n\n**B:** In favor of **3x** weight between 6 month and 12 month eligible locks\n\n**Against:** Against implementation of all options proposed in RFP-21\n\n**Abstain:** Undecided, but contributing to quorum.",

      "title": "RFP-20: Addition of wbETH as a Lend/Borrow Market to Arbitrum",
      "content": "## **Abstract**\n\nRFP-20 proposes the integration of wbETH (Wrapped Beacon ETH) as a full collateral and borrow market within the BNB Smart Chain deployment of Radiant Capital.\n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nRadiant Capital aims to provide a decentralized platform for lending and borrowing cryptocurrencies, offering users an efficient and secure means to access financing and generate yields. As the DeFi market evolves, it is essential to expand the platform's offerings by incorporating new, high-quality assets as collateral and borrowing options.\n\n**Wrapped Beacon Ethereum (wbETH)** represents a liquid staking derivative token that mirrors the value of staked ETH and its associated rewards. This token is created by Binance Earn, providing users with the opportunity to participate in ETH staking rewards from the Ethereum network. Wrapped tokens, such as wbETH, enable the utilization of cryptocurrencies on different blockchains while remaining backed by the underlying asset.\n\nTo learn more about wbETH, please [visit the following link.](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/what-is-wbeth-e252366155174ba6887f6b32e3798273)\n\nTo learn more about Binance ETH Staking, [visit the following link.](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/binance-eth-2-0-staking-eecd04618b5042c79f2a5b07f895c498)\n\n**The objective** of this governance proposal is to seek approval for the integration of wbETH as an accepted form of collateral and as a borrow market within the Binance Smart Chain deployment of Radiant Capital. This expansion aligns with Radiant Capital's vision of offering a comprehensive and diverse set of assets to its users.\n\nThe Risk Committee has evaluated wbETH and recommended the parameters for its integration into the platform, which will be outlined below.\n\n\n## **Key Terms**\n\n\n\n* **wbETH** - Wrapped Beacon Ethereum from Binance\n\n* **Max LTV** - The Maximum LTV ratio represents the maximum borrowing power of a specific collateral. For example, if a collateral has an LTV of 75%, the user can borrow up to 0.75 worth of ETH in the principal currency for every 1 ETH worth of collateral.\n* **Liquidation Threshold** - This represents the threshold at which a borrow position will be considered undercollateralized and subject to liquidation for each collateral. For example, if a collateral has a liquidation threshold of 80%, it means that the position will be liquidated when the debt value is worth 80% of the collateral value. \n\n\n## **Specifications**\n\n\n\n* Add wbETH as a full collateral and borrow market\n\n* Max LTV: 70% \n* Liquidation Threshold: 80%\n* Scale allocation points (incentive emissions) for lend and borrow markets as deposits grow for a two-week period, at which point AP will be stabilized\n\n\n## **Steps to Implement**\n\n\n\n* **Chainlink Integration:** In order to list wbETH, the integration of a Chainlink feed for the wbETH/bETH exchange ratio is necessary. This feed will provide accurate and real-time exchange rate data for the wbETH token. A similar implementation can be observed on Arbitrum through the following link: [Chainlink Arbitrum Feed](https://data.chain.link/arbitrum/mainnet/crypto-eth/wsteth-steth%20exchangerate).\n\n* **Alternative:** The Radiant team is actively engaging with both Chainlink and Binance teams to explore an alternative workaround option. This solution involves utilizing the bETH/ETH-USD ratio for determining the wbETH exchange rate. Discussions are ongoing to ensure the availability of reliable and accurate exchange rate data for wbETH.\n* **Smart Contract Implementation:** Based on the defined parameters, the Radiant team will implement the necessary updates to enable the integration of wbETH as a collateral and borrow market with parameters as laid out above. This implementation will involve coding and testing the smart contracts to ensure their functionality and security.\n* **User Interface Update:** The Radiant Capital user interface will be updated to reflect the addition of wbETH as a collateral and borrow market. This includes providing users with the option to select wbETH as collateral and borrow assets, as well as displaying relevant information such as wbETH exchange rates, available loan options, and associated risks.\n\n\n## **Overall Cost/Impact**\n\nMinimal.\n\n## **Timeline**\n\nIntegration is expected to occur swiftly, subject to the following stages:\n\n\n\n* **Local Testing:** The Radiant team will conduct thorough testing of the implementation in a local environment to ensure its functionality, security, and compatibility with the BNB Smart Chain ecosystem.\n\n* **Staging:** Following Chainlink Feed integration, the implementation will proceed to a staging phase, where further testing to verify the integrity and functionality of the wbETH collateral and borrow market will take place.\n\n\n## **Voting**\n\n\n\n* **In Favor:** Supportive of RFP-20, adding wbETH to the Binance Smart Chain deployment of Radiant \n* **Against:** Against implementation of the RFP-20 proposal\n* **Abstain:** Undecided, but contributing to quorum",

      "title": "RFP-19: Radiant Expansion & Deployment to Ethereum Mainnet",
      "content": "## **Abstract**\n\nRFP-19 seeks to secure approval from Radiant DAO stakeholders to deploy the Radiant protocol on Ethereum Mainnet.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nNow that the Radiant v2 model has been successfully demonstrated on both Arbitrum and BNB Chain, the time has come for Radiant to pursue further expansion opportunities.\n\nAs Radiant approaches its first anniversary, the DAO has seen significant growth over the course of 2023:\n\n* **10x** the number of RDNT token holders and protocol users\n* **#1** money market on Arbitrum in terms of TVL and DAUs\n* **#2** money market on BNB Chain and #1 in terms of DAUs\n* **Over $60M** in dLP locked between Arbitrum and BNB Chain deployments and Total Market Size briefly exceeding $700M\n* **More than $10M** in protocol fees generated since inception\n* **Regularly ranked #1** in terms of protocol revenue across all lending protocols on all chains, despite only having Arbitrum and BNB chain deployments\n\nSignificant effort went into making Radiant v2 easily composable for all EVM chains. In addition, for the past two months, the DAO has been engaged in a comprehensive audit with OpenZeppelin. This audit serves as a necessary prerequisite for implementing major gas and protocol optimizations. \n\n**The next phase of Radiant Protocol’s growth should be driven by a deployment to Ethereum Mainnet.**\n\n\n### Why ETH Mainnet?\n\n**1. Largest Market** \n\n![alt_text](https://images2.imgbox.com/07/ec/JQToRwXR_o.png \"Chain Overview\")\n  \nDespite the growth of Layer 2 solutions in 2023, Mainnet still holds $26B in Total Value Locked (TVL), which is *five times* the combined value of Arbitrum and BNB Chain. There are $70B worth of stablecoins on Ethereum, many of which are not being utilized to generate yield or are producing minimal yield.\n\n**2. Ripe Opportunity in DeFi**\n\n![alt_text](https://images2.imgbox.com/ec/a6/HVpjYZuS_o.png \"Protocol Rankings\")\n\n\nETH Mainnet presents the most complex competitive landscape for a new entrant in the DeFi space, but there is significant opportunity for an improved incentive model to grab market share:\n\n**Staked ETH (Lido wstETH, Coinbase cbETH)**\n\n* The biggest opportunity in DeFi right now, with Staked ETH on Lido reaching almost $14B.\n\n* There is $2.5B of wstETH (Wrapped Staked ETH with Lido) on Aave earning **0%** or **0.01%** as a base yield, and **0%** as an incentivized yield.\n\n* In contrast, on Radiant’s Arbitrum deployment, lenders of wstETH are receiving **0.48%** base yield and **3.11%** incentivized yield in RDNT tokens, **3.5%** in total on top of the staking yield.\n* With a directed program of incentives (in collaboration with Lido Finance), and a different approach to collateral parameters, Radiant believes that it can capture some of the staked ETH market share. This alone could surpass the total TVL of the Arbitrum and BNB Chain deployments.\n\n**Stablecoins**\n\n* There are $70B in stablecoins, with the vast majority earning meaningfully less than US treasuries, or the “risk free rate” (around 2.5%), or worse.\n\n* Billions of dollars in ETH and wBTC are currently earning near-zero percent returns.\n* This is not taking into account the additional risk of protocol insolvency (see: current bad debt concerns), smart contact risk, or hacking risk. Users should be adequately compensated for this risk.\n* Some members of the DAO believe that by adopting a different strategy for interest rate curves, collateral parameters, and incentives exclusively to those who provide value back to the protocol in the form of dLP, users can potentially achieve significantly improved yields.\n* _Context: Current Radiant stablecoin yields at time of writing @ ~6% (2-2.5% base yield and 3.5-4.5% incentivized yield)._\n\n**LP Tokens**\n\n* LP Tokens have presented an interesting challenge for lending markets in the past, often the source of protocol hacks due to easier manipulation of the LP token price. We believe that there is an opportunity to tap into stable LP pools (e.g., 3Pool) with the right approach to oracle parameters, though this is still in investigation via the research and protocol risk teams.\n\n* Despite the work and auditing required to safely add support for the billions in TVL across Uniswap and Curve LP tokens, the DAO believes that this strategic move will potentially generate significant dLP locking and propel Radiant into the forefront as the premier money market in DeFi.\n\nGiven the requirement for lenders to supply a minimum of 5% dLP ([RFP-4](https://dao.radiant.capital/#/proposal/0x058ea8db46ec92bfec2a36691aba75f671f04e99c6ffa7141768e3760d8bf584)) in order to unlock incentivized emissions, this proposal suggests that introducing collateral support for any or all of the aforementioned assets could generate substantial growth in both TVL and dLP for the protocol.\n\n\n## **Key Terms**\n\n* dLP - Dynamic Liquidity Providers within the Radiant protocol\n* Interest rate curves - Model by which Radiant determines how interest rates change in response to different utilizations\n\n\n## **Specifications**\n\n* Deploy the RDNT token on Ethereum Mainnet \n* Initialize Radiant smart contracts on Ethereum Mainnet\n* Update app.radiant.capital to reflect the addition of a third chain\n* Update governance system to reflect the addition of a third chain\n\n\n## **Steps to Implement**\n\nIf RFP-19 passes, the Radiant DAO will begin development and operational efforts to prepare for an ETH Mainnet launch.\n\n\n## **Overall Cost/Impact**\n\n\n\n* **Auditing Costs:** To ensure the security of the protocol, comprehensive audits are required.

      "title": "RFP-18: Strategic Application of $ARB Allocation from Radiant DAO Treasury",
      "content": "## **Abstract**\n\nThis proposal details a strategic allocation plan for utilizing the 3,348,026 $ARB tokens granted to the Radiant DAO treasury. \n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\n\n### $ARB Allocation\n\nAs Radiant prepares to expand to other chains, we are proactively undergoing an important audit of our v2 protocol by OpenZeppelin. This audit represents Radiant's third formal review and underscores our commitment to security and reliability. Simultaneously, we are conducting miscellaneous gas and protocol optimizations that are expected to continue for at least another month. \n\n[RFP-16](https://dao.radiant.capital/#/proposal/0x3ddf7c759cb0633cccdaf7a579ba22f9852ef2a0af8804a49cb2f6e3f2f23b93)'s approval enabled the DAO to use these 3,348,026 $ARB tokens allocated by the Arbitrum Foundation, optimally positioning Radiant to solidify liquidity conditions for the protocol.\n\nIn this context, it has been noted by our community that Radiant finds itself in a unique position to leverage the DAO’s $ARB allocation. These tokens could be utilized as incentives to stimulate growth, promote engagement, and attract new users. Importantly, the implementation of this strategy would not necessitate any additional inflation of $RDNT tokens.\n\n \n\n\n\n### Starfleet\nIn accordance with [RFP-11](https://dao.radiant.capital/#/proposal/0xd3e5c5fac34f40232b31477a841897e40893351bab0e5d92ee2bcd1b5c243ff6), the Radiant DAO approved the establishment of a leaderboard mechanism, known as **Starfleet**, which aims to incentivize users who contribute long-term value to the protocol.\n\nStarfleet was initially designed to allocate 10% of exit penalty fees to provide treasury incentives for the program. However, the “early-exit loophole” (subsequently fixed last week via [RFP-17](https://dao.radiant.capital/#/proposal/0x9709a7abb33bb058e966124872d43e4d5b5039f3ece8732f65b50192ed647d3f)) allowed many people to bypass these fees, effectively starving the Starfleet initiative of the necessary funds it would require to operate in any meaningful capacity.\n\n**Proposed Allocation** \n \nIn light of the above, RFP-18 proposes to utilize a significant portion of the $ARB token allocation as an airdrop to all new lockers within a specified period. This proposal aligns with the ethos of Starfleet’s “seasons” mechanics, and would enable the DAO to continue with the Starfleet initiative.\n \nThe proposed allocation is outlined as follows:\n\n\n\n1. **Starfleet Season 1** - Up to **40%** of $ARB tokens (1,339,210 $ARB) will be distributed through an airdrop to all **new** 6-month and 1-year dLP lockers. These locks must be initiated between two points: the first snapshot, which is scheduled to be taken shortly after this proposal is approved (should it pass), and a second randomized snapshot, which will be taken between 30-60 days after the first snapshot. To prevent potential manipulation, the precise timing for the snapshots will be disclosed only after the conclusion of the specified period.\n     - If RFP-18 passes, the specific airdrop formula weighting and mechanics will be discussed in a follow-up proposal. (*For example: if a $2M threshold in new locked dLP is met within the snapshot window, 100% of the airdrop allocation will be released.*)\n    \n    -  dLP lockers on both Arbitrum and BNB Chain will be eligible for the airdrop (note that BNB users will need to claim the airdrop on Arbitrum). \n    \n2. **Long-term Incentives** - **30%** of $ARB tokens will be distributed to all Arbitrum dLP lockers over the course of the next year, following the usual multiplier rates based on locking length.\n\n3. **Strategic Reserve** - The remaining **30%** ARB will be reserved for future use by the DAO.\n\nRadiant DAO's motivation to allocate 40% of the $ARB tokens to new 6-month and 1-year dLP lockers is a strategic move aimed at encouraging fresh engagement with the Radiant protocol, while also consolidating liquidity for the year ahead. This approach, an alternative to dual emissions, is designed to attract new users. \n\nFurthermore, the distribution of 30% of tokens via the MultiFeeDistributor (MFD) to current dLP lockers offers a compelling incentive for these key community members to re-lock their tokens, thereby promoting their ongoing involvement in the Radiant ecosystem.\n\nReserving 30% of the $ARB tokens for future use ensures that the Radiant DAO retains the flexibility to adapt and respond to future needs and opportunities. This balanced approach underscores the DAO’s commitment to immediate growth objectives and long-term thinking.\n\nBy adopting RFP-18, the Radiant DAO is not just aiming for an increase in protocol usage and user engagement, but also setting the foundation for a dynamic and prosperous community. This DAO is poised to continue thriving even as we await the completion of the OpenZeppelin audit and anticipate the promising expansions it will enable.\n\n\n## **Key Terms**\n\n\n\n* **$ARB:** The governance token of the Arbitrum Foundation.\n* **dLP:** Dynamic Liquidity Providers within the Radiant ecosystem.\n* **Exit penalty:** A linear protocol fee incurred (in $RDNT) for early-exit vests which have not reached 90-day maturation.\n* **Snapshot window:** This refers to a predetermined time frame, defined by block height, during which specific on-chain activities can be measured. *Please note, this term is not to be confused with \"Snapshot.org,\" the on-chain governance system.*\n\n\n## **Specifications**\n\nUpon ratification, the following steps will be enacted: \n\n1. 40% of $ARB tokens in the RDNT DAO Treasury (equivalent to 1,339,210 tokens) to be allocated to **Starfleet Season 1.**\n\n    - The snapshot window will commence within 72 hours of RFP-18 approval.\n    - The snapshot window will conclude within 30 to 60 days from opening.\n    - In order to prevent manipulation, the exact duration of the snapshot window will remain undisclosed until it ends.\n    - Specific details concerning the Starfleet Season 1 airdrop, such as the distribution ratio between 6-month and 1-year locks, and airdrop caps, will be addressed in a subsequent proposal.\n3. 30% of $ARB (amounting to 1,004,408 tokens) to be distributed to **all** Arbitrum dLP lockers over the next 52 weeks. This will be executed  via the protocol’s MultiFeeDistributor contract, the same mechanism used to distribute all other token incentives. \n4. 30% of $ARB tokens to be reserved for future use.\n\n\n## **Steps to Implement**\n\n\n* **For the airdrop:** two random snapshots will be taken within the next 60 days for Starfleet Season 1. The airdrop distribution will be based on consensus to be determined in a follow-up proposal.\n\n* **For ARB distributed linearly over the next year to Arbitrum dLP lockers:** A technical scoping process and a testing environment will be established to ensure the DAO's capability to distribute 19,315.53 $ARB tokens weekly. This amount represents 1/52 of 30% of the total 3,348,026 $ARB allocation to the MultiFeeDistributor. The MultiFeeDistributor will then disburse the $ARB tokens in the same manner as it currently distributes protocol fees.\n\n\n## **Overall Cost/Impact**\n\nWhile the development costs associated with constructing, auditing, and implementing dual-emissions are still to be fully determined, initial estimates suggest a \"low/medium\" level of effort. This estimation is based on the possibility to leverage tried-and-tested code, which should streamline the process.\n\n\n## **Timeline**\n\nShould RFP-18 be approved, the process of technical scoping and testing would commence immediately. This stage involves verifying that the DAO can effectively transfer $ARB tokens into the MFD contract, which would then emit the tokens along with all other protocol fees over the 7-day distribution period. This verification process is anticipated to take a maximum of 1-2 weeks. Upon successful verification, $ARB tokens from the DAO are expected to start linearly streaming to all dLP lockers without delay.\n\nThe process of capturing snapshots for the Starfleet Season 1 airdrop is projected to take between 35-65 days to complete, factoring in setup and snapshot window duration. There will be a subsequent governance proposal to follow RFP-18 concerning the precise formula used to determine the weighted airdrop to new dLP lockers.\n\n\n## **Voting**\n\n\n\n* **In Favor:** Supportive of, agreeing to use 70% of ARB tokens to incentivize dLP lockers\n* **Against:** Against implementation of RFP-18\n* **Abstain:** Undecided, but contributing to quorum",

      "title": "RFP-17: Optimizing Minimum Zap Length in Vesting Process",
      "content": "## **Abstract**\n\nRFP-17 aims to synchronize the minimum lock time for Zaps from vesting $RDNT to align with the emission $RDNT vesting period of 90 days.\n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nTypically, the vesting schedule of $RDNT reward tokens via emissions matures over a 90 day period. During this vesting process, a user can choose to exit a vest early for a linear penalty, with the exit penalty being redistributed back to the Radiant DAO Reserve (per [RFP-11](https://snapshot.org/#/radiantcapital.eth/proposal/0xd3e5c5fac34f40232b31477a841897e40893351bab0e5d92ee2bcd1b5c243ff6)). \n \nAs part of the v2 deployment, Radiant introduced a feature by which users with vesting $RDNT tokens can “Zap into dLP”. This mechanism bypasses the penalty typically incurred when triggering an early exit and provides users with the option of locking the newly-formed dLP for 1, 3, 6 or 12 months. \n\nWhen conducting an analysis of the use of this feature to date, a community member highlighted that this function has  a “loophole” whereby users can bypass the typical vesting duration for incentivized $RDNT (90 days) and be able to redeem the entire reward amount after locking the tokens for 30 days, vs. a 90-day vest. This is not a true loophole, as the user then needs to put up ETH/BNB for the dLP, as well as take on some IL risk.\n\nHowever, in the analysis conducted, almost 90% of the users using the “Zap into dLP” feature are locking for only 1 month, whereas the normal distribution of locking length amongst users is quite different, with the majority of users locking for 1 year. This would indicate that users are using this feature as a way to accelerate vesting through the back door, rather than its intended function which was to help provide more long-term on-chain liquidity.\n\nThe recommendation is to remove the 30-day option for the “Zap vesting $RDNT into dLP” mechanism and adjust the minimum lock length to 90 days in alignment with the standard vesting schedule.\n\nThis will have the net effect of reducing inflation into the protocol and extending the runway for emissions, which will promote further longevity and affords more flexibility to the Radiant DAO’s plan to expand to more chains in the future.\n\nGiven the analysis showed that this dLP that resulted from vesting $RDNT Zaps was not sticky (with most users unwinding dLP within 24h of the locks expiring), it’s not predicted to have a meaningful impact on average on-chain liquidity levels as well\n\nThis update will only address the “Zap from vesting $RDNT” function and will not in any way impact any of the other timelocked features within the Radiant protocol. Users will still have the option to Zap fully-vested $RDNT tokens into dLP for 1 month if they so choose. Furthermore, should it pass, **this RFP will not retroactively apply to existing locks**. \n\n\n## **Key Terms**\n\n\n\n* Vesting $RDNT -  The process of distributing incentive emissions to users over time\n* dLP - Dynamic Liquidity Providers within the Radiant protocol\n* Lock duration - The period during which dLP remains locked in the Radiant protocol\n\n\n## **Specifications**\n\n\n\n* Discontinue 1-month Zap option for vesting $RDNT into dLP; 3, 6, and 12-month options remain\n* No impact on in-flight locks; applies to future locks only\n\n\n## **Steps to Implement**\n\n\n\n* Scoping is currently underway\n* Auditing of the feature\n* Implementation into smart contract\n* Implementation into front end\n\n\n## **Overall Cost/Impact**\n\n\n\nMinimal costs relating to upgrade of the Zap vesting $RDNT into dLP contract calls \n\n\n## **Timeline**\n\n\n\nUpon successful testing and audit feedback, feature would be implemented into Arbitrum, BNB Chain and all subsequent network deployments\n\n\n## **Voting**\n\n\n\n* **In favor:** Endorses RFP-17, advocating for alignment of \"Zap vesting $RDNT to dLP\" with standard emissions vesting duration\n* **Against:** Against implementation of the RFP-17 proposal\n* **Abstain:** Undecided, but contributing to quorum",

As a result, the Radiant DAO has received 3,348,026 $ARB tokens, one of the [largest allocations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSSAzkIIJqw4WGKCF9gXFUkQojTt6weQTExZYmp3YRIR2TUjir9N8nh8xg7gQ2wuPA8mJKL2neL--to/pubhtml) made by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nThere have been discussions in [Discourse](https://community.radiant.capital/t/rfp-idea-arb-incentives-for-radiant-arbitrum-stakeholders/974) and amongst the community regarding the usage of this allocation. This proposal aims to obtain consensus on how best to utilize these tokens.\n \nSome of the community’s discussed objectives include:\n\n\n\n\n* Act as a key steward in the [future governance](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/arbitrum-dao) of the Arbitrum Foundation. As Radiant is one of the largest on-chain governance-directed protocols on Arbitrum, the Radiant DAO could potentially become a significant policy maker within this network.\n\n* Facilitate a future flywheel by attracting new users to the Radiant protocol and Arbitrum network through the use of $ARB tokens as incentives to Radiant users.\n* Help extend the runway of the protocol for future operating expense needs such as audits, development costs, and future hiring.\n* Incentivize behavior within the protocol from existing users that will help increase the stability, liquidity, and future success of Radiant’s deployment broadly and on Arbitrum.\n* Enable Radiant to reduce future inflation levels by using already allocated $ARB as a complement to existing $RDNT rewards.\n\nThis proposal serves as an indicator of the community's interest in distributing $ARB through incentives. Following proposals will detail the specific allocations, outlining the amount of $ARB designated for various groups such as dLP lockers, lenders, borrowers, Starfleet, and re-lockers.\n\n[This discussion](https://community.radiant.capital/t/rfp-idea-arb-incentives-for-radiant-arbitrum-stakeholders/974) provided some initial thoughts on why the $ARB airdrop should primarily be used for incentives. This proposal lays out the idea that $ARB should be used in a mix of incentives towards:\n\n\n\n\n* dLP lockers → Providing value in the form of on-chain locked liquidity.\n* Borrowers → Providing additional protocol fees, which help improve the flywheel of onboarding new users without having to use additional $RDNT via inflation.\n* Lenders → Top-of-the-funnel new user acquisition and existing lenders who enable the protocol to function.\n* Starfleet → Allocating a portion to the most engaged users, with a future scoring mechanism to establish the “Starfleet Leaderboard” to be determined at a later stage.\n* Long-term lockers → Long-term lockers ensure future on-chain liquidity availability, which in turn encourages new users to confidently adopt and use the Radiant protocol.\n\n\n[RFP-15](https://snapshot.org/#/radiantcapital.eth/proposal/0xeef2590850b2815a2ebc9e09cda33df705f27b3c0aa1e7b56939a9f7e4615b95) recently passed and was successfully implemented, allowing users who earn incentives in $ARB to utilize that $ARB as collateral, thereby increasing their cross-chain borrowing power.\n\nIf RFP-16 is approved, it will initiate the necessary development work to enable dual-emissions, allowing both $RDNT and $ARB to be distributed to lenders and borrowers.\n\nThis proposal recommends taking multiple snapshots of dLP users over the coming months in order to set up an airdrop of $ARB to long-term and consistent dLP holders, in addition to the incentives laid out above (dLP lockers directly of all durations, lenders, borrowers). \n\nThis approach allows the current cohort of dLP lockers to extend their lock durations while also rewarding initial long-term lockers. Those who have liquid LP tokens (in Balancer, TraderJoe, PancakeSwap, or Uniswap) would not be eligible for this portion of the incentives. A community member suggested this method in order to assuage concerns regarding the “unlocks” of short-term locked dLP.\n\n\n## **Key Terms**\n\n\n\n* $ARB - The governance token of the Arbitrum Foundation\n* dLP - Dynamic Liquidity Providers within the Radiant protocol\n* Starfleet - Defined in [RFP-11](https://snapshot.org/#/radiantcapital.eth/proposal/0xd3e5c5fac34f40232b31477a841897e40893351bab0e5d92ee2bcd1b5c243ff6) \n* Dual Emissions - Both $RDNT and a second token issued concurrently to lenders and borrowers\n\n\n## **Specifications**\n\nThere are no on-chain executable parameters with this proposal, as it is meant to set-up a future proposal on the weighting of $ARB to various incentive categories.\n\n\n## **Steps to Implement**\n\n\n\n* There are several work-tracks which would be initiated if RFP-16 passes. Firstly, it would necessitate  technical efforts to scope, audit, and implement dual-emissions. Some of the initial work has been done here on a spec, and this would go into Radiant’s upcoming audit with OpenZeppelin.\n\n* Set-up randomized snapshots over the coming months to compile a list of addresses that have consistently been a dLP from v2 launch until the snapshot end dates, effectively excluding “liquid LP providers.”\n\n\n## **Overall Cost/Impact**\n\nDevelopment costs relating to building, auditing and implementing dual-emissions are to be scoped out, but initial estimates have come back as a “low/medium” level of effort given the ability to use battle-tested code.\n\n\n## **Timeline**\n\nIf RFP-16 passes, a subsequent discussion and vote(s) would be set up regarding the distribution of $ARB rewards to the dLP users, lenders, borrowers and long-term lockers.\n\n\n## **Voting**\n\n\n\n* **In favor:** Supportive of RFP-16, agreeing to use some portion of $ARB tokens to Radiant stakeholders in the categories listed above\n* **Against:** Against implementation of the RFP-16 proposal, which would not use $ARB to incentivize stakeholders\n* **Abstain:** Undecided, but contributing to quorum",

      "content": "## Abstract\n\nRFP-15 looks to add $ARB (Arbitrum Governance Token) from the Arbitrum Foundation as a full collateral and borrow market to the Arbitrum deployment of Radiant Capital.\n\n[https://arbitrum.foundation/](https://arbitrum.foundation/)\n\n## Motivation\n\nRadiant Capital aims to provide a decentralized platform for lending and borrowing cryptocurrencies, offering users an efficient and secure means to access financing and generate yields. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, it is essential to expand the platform's offerings by incorporating new, high-quality assets as collateral and borrowing options.\n\n  \n\nThe objective of this governance proposal is to seek approval for the integration of ARB as an accepted form of collateral and as a borrow market within the Arbitrum deployment of Radiant Capital.\n\n  \n\nThe ARB token launched in March and will be the governing token for the Arbitrum ecosystem. As the #1 TVL money market deployed on Arbitrum, Radiant is a natural venue for lending and borrowing of ARB. We commend the Arbitrum Foundation’s commitment to work towards entirely on-chain executed governance, and are supportive of the vision that they look to achieve.\n\n  \n\nARB is currently undergoing evaluation from the Risk Committee. Given ARB does not exist on highly liquid money markets yet, and given its volatile profile, it will launch with conservative parameters (Max LTV, Liquidation threshold) and will evolve as the market matures.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n-   ARB - Arbitrum Token ([https://arbitrum.foundation/](https://arbitrum.foundation/))\n    \n-   Max LTV - The Maximum LTV ratio represents the maximum borrowing power of a specific collateral. For example, if a collateral has an LTV of 75%, the user can borrow up to 0.75 worth of ETH in the principal currency for every 1 ETH worth of collateral.\n    \n-   Liquidation Threshold: This represents the threshold at which a borrow position will be considered undercollateralized and subject to liquidation for each collateral. For example, if a collateral has a liquidation threshold of 80%, it means that the position will be liquidated when the debt value is worth 80% of the collateral value.\n    \n\n## Specifications\n\n-   Add ARB as a full collateral and borrow market (ERC-20)\n    \n-   Max LTV: Pending Risk Committee Review\n    \n-   Liquidation Threshold: Pending Risk Committee Review\n    \n-   Scale allocation points (incentive emissions) for lend and borrow markets depending on demand over a two-week period, at which point AP will be stabilized\n    \n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n-   Add ARB as a collateral and borrow market with parameters determined by the Radiant Risk Committee\n    \n\n## Overall Cost/Impact\n\n-   Minimal\n    \n\n## Timeline\n\n-   Immediate effect, pending local testing success\n    \n\n## Voting\n\n-   In Favor: Supportive of RFP-15, adding ARB to the Arbitrum deployment of Radiant, pending review from Risk Committee on parameters\n    \n-   Against: Against implementation of the RFP-15 proposal\n    \n-   Abstain: Undecided, but contributing to quorum\n\n",

      "title": "RFP-14: Authorizing $RDNT Tokens for Prospective Investors",
      "content": "\n## Abstract\n\nRFP-14 looks to authorize the Radiant DAO to issue RDNT tokens to future prospective investors.\n\n## Motivation\n\nSince inception, Radiant Protocol has raised $0 of Venture Capital or outside funding, and the initial team bootstrapped the protocol development entirely with their own funds, spending over $3M USD to date, with $700,000 spent on audits and security alone. While this allowed the team to operate more quickly rather than spending time fundraising, it has also served as a limitation, given the growing needs for hiring and spending to achieve the full omni-chain vision of the protocol.\n\n  \n\nRadiant Capital has had some great success over the past 8 months, growing to the number #1 money market on Arbitrum and quickly growing to Top 10 in overall TVL on BNB Chain within a week of launch. There is an incredibly ambitious roadmap ahead, and achieving that roadmap will require ramping up hiring significantly relative to the headcount currently on the team.\n\n  \n\n[RFP-7](https://snapshot.org/#/radiantcapital.eth/proposal/0x42a7eb77bcb3bf5a4aea4a95c52b26df61eb60d2fbbb5dfa53cfd9b28c492570) created the RDNT DAO Treasury, which allocates 15% of protocol fees in order to serve future needs of hiring, salaries, audits, marketing, and business development needs. That said, this treasury will accrue value slowly (as protocol fees come in) and wouldn’t help with the immediate needs to both support current salaries and expand to new ones. These salaries and fees for contractors need to be paid in stablecoins, and many of which up-front.\n\n  \n\nOver the last couple months, Radiant has received inbound interest from prospective VC investors looking to inject capital into the protocol to help support the growth ambitions. While these conversations were all put on hold as 100% of energy was put towards the v2 launch, it would be in the best interest of the protocol to open these conversations again. In terms of the specific benefits it could bring Radiant users and DAO members:\n\n-   Additional hiring in all functions: Engineering, Ops, Marketing, Product Management\n    \n-   Accelerating protocol development: This could bring forward the timeline to additional Radiant deployments on new chains as well as future projects that have been put on hold because of resource constraints\n    \n-   Attract top-tier developer talent: As a largely Anon team with no VC funding, it’s been difficult to attain the level of talent that will make the Radiant ecosystem thrive for years to come. VC funding from the right strategic partners can help with credibility, in addition to tapping new networks for talents that these partners can provide\n    \n\n  \n\nThis proposal is to authorize up to a maximum of 17.5% of the RDNT token supply (175M tokens) to be issued to prospective future investors into Radiant Protocol. In terms of the requirements of prospective investors:\n\n-   Multi-year vesting schedules: To align with the long-term ambitions, any investor would be required to have multi-year vesting of RDNT tokens\n    \n-   Strategic value add: Any partners brought into the ecosystem should be able to add significant value “over and above the check”, meaning they can help Radiant DAO achieve its vision in ways that go beyond the money. This may be with hiring, BD, marketing, development, and helping RDNT achieve its vision.\n    \n\n  \n\nIn terms of benchmarks from other protocols, a 17.5% allocation to investors is in line with projects such as:\n\n-   Stargate / STG (17.5%)\n    \n-   Arbitrum/ARB (17.5%)\n    \n-   Optimism/OP (17.5%)\n    \n-   Starknet (17%)\n    \n\n  \n\nGiven confidentiality requirements, similar to the private deals done on the aforementioned protocols, these deals would be privately negotiated with potential VC or strategic partners. If the partner sought to do PR post-investment, The Radiant DAO would evaluate this on a case-by-case basis.\n\n  \n\nIn terms of where the RDNT tokens will come from, the proposal is such that they would come out of the RDNT DAO Reserve ([RFP-2](https://snapshot.org/#/radiantcapital.eth/proposal/0xbdf3daeda12219b9d19acdbbb6a2b0be3faa741573c1b8ae325b3737e76e9d95)). The RDNT balance of the Reserve will continue to accrue more tokens as users exit vests early ([RFP-5](https://snapshot.org/#/radiantcapital.eth/proposal/0xec57cd4bb4d567bfdf6ccdb2eac6ca347e6f9d3a0220117cdfa960aad82690a4)). If at the time of investment more tokens were required, these would come out of the RDNT Emissions reserve, slightly reducing the amount of tokens emitted in years 4 and 5 to lenders and borrowers. Based on simulations done internally, the assumption is that no tokens would need to be drawn from the emissions reserve.\n\n  \n\n**In summary:** RFP-14 is crucial for Radiant to achieve its ultimate vision of becoming the dominant omnichain money market, bridging the billions in fragmented liquidity on all chains with support for hundreds of assets. To realize this goal, Radiant needs to overcome its current limitations, such as a limited stablecoin treasury (outside of RDNT), and the inability to attract top-tier talent. By authorizing the issuance of up to a maximum of 17.5% of the RDNT token supply (similar to STG, ARB, OP & Starknet) to prospective investors, Radiant aims to secure the necessary capital to significantly ramp up hiring, accelerate protocol development, and access the networks and credibility provided by top tier strategic partners. This additional funding and support will enable Radiant to execute its ambitious roadmap and assist in realizing its vision.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n-   N/A\n    \n\n## Specifications\n\n-   Authorize the RDNT DAO Reserve to issue up to 17.5% of the total token supply (175M tokens) to prospective investors, under the condition that any investor would be subject to a multi-year vesting schedule and cliff with no tokens available immediately\n    \n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n-   N/A\n    \n\n## Overall Cost/Impact\n\n-   No impact expected given the mechanics of RFP-5. If more tokens were required, this would lead to a marginal reduction in RDNT emitted to lenders/borrowers in Years 4 and 5 from protocol inception\n    \n\n## Timeline\n\nImmediate effect\n\n## Voting\n\n-   In Favor: Supportive of RFP-14, authorizing up to a maximum of 17.5% of the total RDNT token supply to be issued to prospective future investors\n    \n-   Against: Against implementation of the RFP-14 proposal\n    \n-   Abstain: Undecided, but contributing to quorum",

As the cryptocurrency market evolves, it is essential to expand the platform's offerings by incorporating new, high-quality assets as collateral and borrowing options.\n\n  \n\nThe objective of this governance proposal is to seek approval for the integration of wstETH (Wrapped Staked Ether) as an accepted form of collateral and as a borrow market within the Arbitrum deployment of Radiant Capital.\n\n  \n\nstETH represents the largest market cap of Liquid Staked Derivatives, and the DAO thinks that it could attract significant additional liquidity and users to Radiant Capital.\n\n  \n\nwstETH has already been evaluated by the Risk Committee and parameters have been recommended, given the initial plan was to create the dLP pair with RDNT-wstETH.

      "title": "RFP-12: Remove OpEx % of Protocol Fees During New Chain Launches [Protocol Mechanics]",
      "content": "## **Abstract**\n\nThe objective of RFP-12 is to improve incentives for Radiant users during new chain launches by eliminating the \"OpEx\" portion of protocol fees (currently set at 15% in [RFP-7](https://dao.radiant.capital/#/proposal/0x42a7eb77bcb3bf5a4aea4a95c52b26df61eb60d2fbbb5dfa53cfd9b28c492570)) and reallocating those fees to base lending interest and dLP lockers.\n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nUnder v1 of the Radiant protocol, Radiant lockers receive 50% of protocol fees. In v2, dLP lockers will receive a higher percentage of protocol fees (60% vs. 50%), but the base lending interest, which was originally derived from 50% of borrowing interest, will be reduced to 25% as specified in RFP-7.\n\nThe OpEx Treasury, which was created via RFP-7, is used to pay salaries and operational expenses that cannot be paid in RDNT (such as ongoing audits, hosting, software licenses, and market-making vendors).\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to temporarily redirect the OpEx Treasury percentage of protocol fees during the first two weeks of a new chain launch, in order to create an additional mechanism for incentivizing lenders, borrowers, and lockers, regardless of their eligibility for emissions.\n\nThe initial recommendation would be as follows:\n* 15% of protocol fees generated by USDC and ETH would be redirected to the Base Lending Interest (25% → 40% of protocol fees received)\n\n* 15% of protocol fees generated by all markets excluding USDC and ETH would be redirected to lockers of dLP (60% → 75% of protocol fees received)\n\nThe ideas behind this:\n\n* Due to the reserved incentivized emissions for dLP lockers, USDC, which has been Radiant's largest market on Arbitrum, will need to remain competitive with other lending protocols on the base yield alone. This will encourage passive liquidity providers to use Radiant regardless of their dLP status.\n\n* Allocating additional protocol fees to dLP lockers will provide extra incentives to account for the risks associated with LP tokens and locking liquidity into the protocol. Compared to v1, where lockers received 50% of protocol fees, this proposal allocates 50% more protocol fees to dLP lockers.\n\nWhile this would be a temporary measure, this community suggestion was a function of the idea that the first few weeks are critical for success and de-risking the future for Radiant.\n\n\n## **Key Terms**\n* **OpEx Treasury:** A treasury created in RFP-7 to be used to protocol operating expenses that need to be paid in currencies outside of RDNT\n* **dLP**: Dynamic Liquidity \n\n\n## **Specifications**\n\n\n\n* Adjust USDC parameter for base lending: 25% → 40% \n* Adjust all other asset parameters for protocol fees: 60% → 75%\n* Adjust OpEx treasury from 15% → 0% of protocol fees\n* At two weeks after launch, the parameters will return to the base state, meaning that the OpEx Treasury will receive the standard 15% of protocol fees.\n\n **Steps to Implement**\n\n* Update the `reserveRatio` and `protocolFee` parameters to reflect the above recommendations.\n\n\n## **Overall Cost/Impact**\n\nDuring launch periods, the OpEx Treasury sacrifices protocol fees in order to attract more new users.\n\n\n## **Timeline**\n\nThe proposed implementation will take effect upon the launch of v2 for Arbitrum and will continue for a period of two weeks post-deployment for Arbitrum and all future chains.\n\n\n## **Voting**\n\n\n\n* **In Favor:** Supportive of RFP-12, removing OpEx % of protocol fees during new chain launches\n* **Against:** Against implementation of the RFP-12 proposal\n* **Abstain:** Undecided, but contributing to quorum",

      "title": "RFP-11: Removal of Burn Component to Exit Penalty; Creation of Starfleet Leaderboard [Protocol Mechanics]",
      "content": "## **Abstract**\n\nRFP-11 aims to adjust the handling of exit penalties and create a better incentive framework for protocol participants through the creation of the “**Starfleet Leaderboard**.”\n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nThe Radiant DAO has taken numerous measures in order to reduce inflation to more sustainable levels, including [RFP-2](https://dao.radiant.capital/#/proposal/0xbdf3daeda12219b9d19acdbbb6a2b0be3faa741573c1b8ae325b3737e76e9d95) (reducing emissions), [RFP-5](https://dao.radiant.capital/#/proposal/0xec57cd4bb4d567bfdf6ccdb2eac6ca347e6f9d3a0220117cdfa960aad82690a4) (exit penalty treatment), and [RFP-8](https://dao.radiant.capital/#/proposal/0x3f10b46186a9327fd18ea2079c69337a8f01345de973b509e7371e829d887e4d) (extending the emissions runway).\n\nWhile most of the proposals in RFP-5 for adjusting exit penalties were strongly supported, such as redirecting 50% of exit penalty RDNT to the RDNT DAO Reserve and adjusting penalties by time vested, the idea of burning 10% of exit penalty tokens was criticized. This was due to the RDNT token's fixed supply of 1 billion tokens and the fact that a burn alone would offer little benefit to the protocol in its early days.\n\nToken burning could serve as a useful neutralizing mechanism if Radiant operated on an inflationary Proof-of-Stake (POS) model like Ethereum. However, given that Radiant does not utilize such a model, the token burn component would not offer significant benefits.\n\nThe second motivation behind the proposed incentive structure is to encourage users to take actions that promote the protocol's longevity, including longer locking times to ensure sustained on-chain liquidity and a higher percentage of dLP to increase gross liquidity flowing into the protocol. \n\nAlthough users with a higher percentage of dLP receive a larger share of protocol fees, a higher ratio of locked dLP to total assets deposited does not guarantee a higher percentage of emissions received. Consequently, users may have an incentive to lock their tokens close to the 5% threshold, which can result in unintended negative consequences such as becoming ineligible and losing access to emissions.\n\nA group of community members have collaborated on a proposal to repurpose the 10% of RDNT currently earmarked for token burning. This proposal, known as the **'Radiant Starfleet Leaderboard,**' aims to find a better way to utilize these funds.\n\nThis proposal for repurposing the 10% of exit penalties suggests rewarding users based on a 'weighted score' that considers factors like gross dLP locked, dLP ratio, locking length, and keeping 'Auto-Compound' enabled. This would incentivize users to take actions that promote the protocol's long-term sustainability and enhance cross-chain liquidity.\n\nThe precise details and weightings for the proposed reward system should be decided by the Radiant Capital DAO in a subsequent proposal. One suggestion is to introduce 'Seasons' with varying weighting parameters that can be adjusted over time.\n\n\n## **Key Terms**\n\n\n\n* **Exit Penalty:** RDNT emitted is vested over 90 days, and a user may claim this vesting RDNT by paying an exit penalty\n* **dLP**: Dynamic Liquidity\n\n\n## **Specifications**\n\n\n\n* Create the **Radiant Starfleet Treasury**, which will be a MultiSig that receives 10% of exit penalty RDNT upon the v2 launch.\n* Adjust the treatment of exit penalties upon the v2 launch: send 10% of exit penalty tokens, which were originally allocated for burning, to the Radiant Starfleet Treasury.\n\n **Steps to Implement**\n\n\n\n* Create a scoring mechanism to evaluate user actions, which has already been specified and will require development work after the v2 launch.\n* Implementation will occur after approval of a subsequent DAO proposal that specifies Starfleet Season timelines and the formula for calculating winners.\n\n\n## **Overall Cost/Impact**\n\nIt is expected that developing and testing the scoring mechanism, including a prototype with integrated front-end, will take approximately 2-3 weeks.\n\n\n## **Timeline**\n\nThe implementation of the proposal will begin with the launch of v2 and the new exit penalty parameters. The scoring mechanism, including a prototype with an integrated front-end, will follow after additional development work.\n\n\n## **Voting**\n\n\n\n* **In Favor:** Supportive of RFP-11, adjusting Exit Penalty treatment and creation of Starfleet Leaderboard\n* **Against:** Against implementation of the RFP-11 proposal\n* **Abstain:** Undecided, but contributing to quorum",

      "title": "RFP-9: Improve RDNT Liquidity and Expand POL - Protocol Mechanics",
      "content": "## **Abstract**\n\nRFP-9 proposes a request for RDNT tokens from the [RDNT DAO Reserve](https://docs.radiant.capital/radiant/contracts-and-security/dao-reserve) to expand Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) as well as expand liquidity on current and future centralized exchanges and Radiant Protocol omnichain deployments\n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nAt genesis of Radiant protocol, 30M tokens were minted to provide initial liquidity on Sushiswap, which served as the primary venue for obtaining RDNT, outside of emissions. 30M RDNT (3% of FDV) was the total amount initially allocated to liquidity in the genesis tokenomics, which did not leave sufficient RDNT for future launches on new chains (e.g., BNB Chain, Mainnet, Polygon) as well as liquidity for centralized exchanges, which all have their own liquidity requirements, ranging from $50K - $500K per venue.\n\nRDNT has significantly expanded the venues where it is available, including Uniswap and TraderJoe v2 on the DEX side. In addition, many centralized exchanges approached Radiant about listing the RDNT token, with several conversations leading to successful listings, such as Gate.io, MEXC, Bybit, Bitget, Bittrue, and Ascendex. There are additional venues in the pipeline that the protocol must also budget for in the future.\n\nThe Radiant DAO must also plan for its imminent expansion onto BNB Chain, Eth Mainnet, and future EVM Radiant deployments. All of these chains will require the protocol to seed liquidity using POL.\n\nBeyond requiring additional tokens for new chain launches and additional exchanges, many members of the community have raised the point around Radiant Capital expanding its POL (Protocol Owned Liquidity) and diversifying its treasury to add ETH, BNB, and stablecoins - all required to provide liquidity. This POL would be _permanent liquidity_ that is not subject to retail LP movements and would guarantee liquidity conditions, thus improving the profile for prospective new users of Radiant.\n\nThere have been considerable discussions in the Radiant Discourse regarding expanding POL by community members. In particular, using Arrakis and Gamma Strategies:\n\n[Arrakis Finance Discussion](https://community.radiant.capital/t/rfp-idea-uniswap-v3-protocol-owned-liquidity-pol-with-arrakis-v2-palm/577) \n\n[Gamma Strategies POL Discussion](https://community.radiant.capital/t/rfp-idea-protocol-owned-liquidity-on-uniswap-v3-utilizing-gamma-strategies/477/17)\n\nRegarding selecting a protocol to work with, a follow-up RFP will outline the various options between working with Arrakis, Gamma, or both protocols for Liquidity / POL Bootstrapping. \n\n\n## **Key Terms**\n\n\n\n* **POL:** Protocol Owned Liquidity, or liquidity not owned by any individual team member and is directed by the Radiant DAO\n* **CEX:** A Centralized Exchange, such as Coinbase or Binance\n* **DEX**: A Decentralized Exchange, such as Uniswap or Pancakeswap\n\n\n## **Specifications**\n\n**Request 30M RDNT tokens (3% of FDV) from the RDNT DAO Reserve**. These tokens would be used exclusively for the following purposes:\n\n\n\n* POL bootstrapping via Arrakis (PALM Product) or Gamma Strategies\n* Providing POL on new DEX venues (BNB Chain, Mainnet, Polygon, etc.)\n* Maintaining liquidity requirements of centralized exchanges (both current and future exchanges in the pipeline) via existing and potential new market makers\n\nThis request would provide Radiant Capital with the liquidity needed to support the multi-year omnichain vision and bring Radiant to a global audience via centralized exchanges.\n\n **Steps to Implement**\n\n\n\n* Issue 30M vested RDNT tokens from the [Radiant DAO reserve](https://docs.radiant.capital/radiant/contracts-and-security/dao-reserve) to the [Radiant Liquidity Multisig](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x56abd0528fef95149ba98b1b7f8d34e1ed7b5141)\n* Create a follow-up proposal that will lay out Radiant’s POL bootstrapping strategy with Arrakis and/or Gamma Strategies\n\n\n## **Overall Cost/Impact**\n\nArrakis and Gamma have their own fee structures which are laid out in these discussion topics\n\n[Arrakis Finance Discussion](https://community.radiant.capital/t/rfp-idea-uniswap-v3-protocol-owned-liquidity-pol-with-arrakis-v2-palm/577) \n\n[Gamma Strategies POL Discussion](https://community.radiant.capital/t/rfp-idea-protocol-owned-liquidity-on-uniswap-v3-utilizing-gamma-strategies/477/17)\n\n\n## **Timeline**\n\nImplementation would go into effect upon completion of the vote\n\n\n## **Voting**\n\n\n\n* **In Favor:** Supportive of RFP-9, improving RDNT liquidity and expanding POL\n* **Against:** Against implementation of the RFP-8 proposal\n* **Abstain:** Undecided, but contributing to quorum",

      "title": "RFP-8: Extending the Emissions Runway - Protocol Mechanics",
      "content": "## **Abstract**\n\nRFP-8 proposes changes to tokenomics in order to extend the emissions runway and handle the allocation of RDNT emissions across multiple chains.\n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nTwo years--the original runway for RDNT lender and borrower emissions--does not provide Radiant Capital with sufficient time to achieve its cross-chain vision. When looking at some of the successful DeFi protocols that achieved product market fit (Uniswap, Aave, Compound), these protocols took years to achieve the current scale. It’s important for Radiant to have sufficient incentives in its reserves to use for a significantly longer timeframe.\n\n\n## **Key Terms**\n\n* **Runway:** the period of time over which emissions will last.\n* **Longtermism:** an [ethical stance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longtermism) that gives priority to improving the long-term future of a system.\n\n\n## **Specifications**\n\nAs discussed in previous RFPs, with respect to extending the runway of Lending/Borrowing emissions, the following protocol changes are being proposed for v2:\n\n### **Extending Emissions Runway**\n\n**Radiant v1 Design:**\n\nLending and Borrowing emissions would last **24 months**, concluding in **July 2024**.\n\n**Proposed v2 Design:**\n\n_Scheduled_ emissions to Lenders and Borrowers will last for a total of **60 months** since inception,  extending the scheduled emissions schedule to **July 2027** (5 years total).\n\nThis is described as a *minimum* of 5 years because there will also be the Radiant DAO Reserve, which is the recipient of exit penalty RDNT (per [RFP-5](https://snapshot.org/#/radiantcapital.eth/proposal/0xec57cd4bb4d567bfdf6ccdb2eac6ca347e6f9d3a0220117cdfa960aad82690a4)) and the reduction in emissions executed in [RFP-2](https://snapshot.org/#/radiantcapital.eth/proposal/0xbdf3daeda12219b9d19acdbbb6a2b0be3faa741573c1b8ae325b3737e76e9d95). This proposal is recommending expanding the initial scope of the RDNT DAO Reserve (which was originally only to be used for lenders/borrowers) in that it should be used more at the discretion of the Radiant DAO to do things such as:\n\n\n\n* Extend emissions runway beyond the scheduled 5 years\n* “Top up” chains that have successful Radiant deployments with additional RDNT in order to incentivize additional user onboarding\n* Additional initiatives to be voted on by the community TBD such as strategic partnerships and other business development/DAO swaps\n\nExtending the runway, combined with RFP-5, has the net effect of reducing net inflation per month to more sustainable levels, relative to the front-loaded emissions schedule originally designed in v1.\n\n### **Allocation of RDNT Emissions by Chain**\n\n**Radiant v1 Design:**\n\nAll emissions were directed to RDNT’s first deployment on Arbitrum.\n\n**Proposed v2 Design:**\n\nIt is difficult to know how many users and how much demand there will be across Radiant deployments as it moves cross-chain. While the second deployment will be on BNB Chain, the vision has always been to deploy Radiant Protocol across all major EVM chains.\n\nAs a result, it’s difficult to make a completely fixed emissions schedule for 5 years, and not be able to respond to the market and where users are going. The following idea has been proposed by a community member as an initial way to split emissions by chain, inspired by the LayerZero team’s cross-chain emissions allocations:\n\n\n\n* *Total Max Emissions represent the total number of emissions that can be allocated to all Radiant deployments combined in a given month; Total Max Emissions will operate on the proposed schedule ending in July 2027.*\n\n* *At the end of each month, the DAO will take a retrospective view of closing TVL on each chain, and allocate emissions accordingly for the subsequent month.*\n\n* *For example, at the end of March, If Arbitrum has 30% of Radiant TVL, BNB Chain 30% of TVL, and Eth Mainnet 20%, emissions should be allocated 30%/30%/20% for the subsequent month.*\n\n* *At launch, 100% of emissions will be directed to Arbitrum Radiant Markets; upon launch of BNB Chain, it is proposed that 50% of emissions be directed to BNB Chain for Month 1.*\n\nThis is a simplistic approach, and more sophisticated ideas (e.g., gauges per chain, per market, allocations based on protocol fees generated) should continue to be discussed and brought to subsequent proposals. _This portion of the RFP can be subject to update upon subsequent proposals generated by the DAO stakeholders_. That said, this is a predictable and formulaic approach that can give transparency in the short term.\n\n### **Breakdown of Token Distribution**\n\n**Radiant v1 Design**\n\n* Lenders and Borrowers: 50%\n* “Pool2”: 20%\n* Team: 20%\n* Advisors & Ecosystem: 7%\n* DEX and CEX Liquidity:3%\n\n**Radiant v2 Design**\n\n* Lenders and Borrowers, Community Allocation: 70%\n* Team: 20%\n* Advisors & Ecosystem: 7%\n* DEX and CEX Liquidity: 3%\n* RDNT DAO Reserve: No formal allocation\n\nThis is a re-allocation of emissions from “Pool2” to Lenders and Borrowers on the Radiant Platform. Given Radiant’s cross-chain ambitions, and the shift from single-sided lock to LP locking, this allows Radiant to more appropriately plan for the long-term future and allows for more chain deployments.\n\n### **Remaining Token Supply**\n\n**Radiant v1 Design**\n\n*Tokens were minted as they were emitted using MasterChef contracts.*\n\n**_Proposed v2 Design_**\n\nFollow LayerZero’s STG token design where the *remaining* tokens (1b total supply) are minted at “genesis” of v2, but remain locked and will follow the vesting schedule laid out above for Lenders and Borrowers. \n\nThis has no impact on inflation or market cap, but solves one of the pain points of v1: Radiant will need to be flexible in changing emissions rates per chain as the protocol matures. With the v1 contract structure, making these kinds of changes as the number of chains expands would be impossible. \n\nThis is in line with STG, which needs to adjust emissions rates by chain depending on TVL needs.\n\n\n## **Steps to Implement**\n\n* Creation of _Emissions Reserve_ MultiSigs for each chain where Radiant is deployed, which allows for more flexibility in adjusting emissions rates as directed by the Radiant DAO in the future.\n* Adjust lending/borrowing vesting schedule from ending in **July 2024** to **July 2027**.\n* Adjust Pool2 emissions rate down to **0 RDNTPerSecond** as per [RFP-3](https://snapshot.org/#/radiantcapital.eth/proposal/0x6d1af397fd5ca984694b29616364885620985980b21177991ddfa6c9a08c5940).\n\n\n## **Overall Cost/Impact**\n\nMinimal.\n\n## **Timeline**\n\nImplementation would go into effect upon the launch of v2, and would deploy on all subsequent Radiant chains (current & future).\n\n\n## **Voting**\n\n* **In Favor:** Supportive of the RFP-8 v2 tokenomics redesign proposals\n* **Against:** Against implementation of the RFP-8 v2 design proposals\n* **Abstain:** Undecided, but contributing to quorum",

      "title": "RFP-7: Protocol Fee Distribution in v2 - Protocol Mechanics",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nRFP-7 proposes to adjust the protocol fee distribution in Radiant v2 by splitting it into three distinct buckets. Furthermore, this proposal seeks to reapproach the protocol’s handling of RDNT token vesting fees.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nFor this DAO proposal, the primary aim is to provide a stronger utility proposition for liquidity providers in Radiant v2 by increasing their share of the protocol fee stream, while concurrently reducing the dilutionary impact of vesting RDNT. This will be done while keeping base borrowing fees competitive with all major lending protocols.\n\nIn addition, this proposal seeks to leverage a portion of fee distribution in order to create a formalized incentive structure for DAO participants to maintain continued contribution toward the development of Radiant.\n\n\n## Key Terms\n\n**OpEx:** Abbreviation for operational expenditure. Expenses a business incurs through its day-to-day operations. Operating expenses can include developmental costs, marketing, payroll, legal, step costs, and funds allocated for project reach and expansion.\n\n\n## **Specifications**\n\nThe following protocol mechanic changes are being proposed for Radiant v2:\n\n\n### Fee Distribution: Overall Split\n\n_v1 Design:_\n\n\n\n* 50% of protocol fees are streamed to RDNT lockers & vesters\n* 50% are given as the base APY to lenders\n\n_v2 Design Proposal:_\n\n\n\n* 60% of protocol fees are streamed to [Dynamic Liquidity](https://community.radiant.capital/t/v2-protocol-mechanics-part-1-of-2-dynamic-liquidity-provisioning-dlp/320) (dLP) lockers\n* 25% allocated as the base APY to lenders\n* 15% streamed to a DAO OpEx wallet which will pay for salaries, exchange listings, community-sourced bounties and marketing partnerships\n\n\n### Fee Distribution: Vesting RDNT Treatment\n\n_v1 Design:_ Both vesting RDNT and locked RDNT earn protocol fees.\n\n_v2 Design Proposal:_ Vesting RDNT will **not** earn protocol fees. Locked dLP will earn protocol fees with an **increased distribution share**.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\n\n### **Overall Split**\n\nThe additional outlay and risk associated with locking up LP tokens for an extended period (as compared to single-sided locking in v1) justifies the increase in fee share for dLP lockers.\n\nAdjustment to the base lending fees affords the protocol flexibility to incentivize dLP lockers while still maintaining competitive rates in line with all major lending platforms.\n\nThe OpEx allocation will mitigate pressure to use RDNT tokens to pay for operational initiatives. The initial team funded Radiant with no outside investment and over $1.5M spent. By earmarking an OpEx budget, the DAO can provide continued funding for future audits and exchange listings, pay the salaries of developers working on the project, and fund community-sourced work. \n\nThis aligns incentives through the DAO governance model, while ensuring that the project remains independent of external funding sources such as grants and VC investment.\n\n\n### Vesting RDNT Treatment\n\nVesting RDNT that continues to accrue protocol fees has the effect of significantly diluting the fee revenue pool at the expense of those who have committed via locking LP tokens.\n\nThis change will have the net effect of improving lock utility vs. Radiant v1 and reducing dilution in the pool, as it redistributes fees away from vesting addresses to those who provide real value through locked liquidity.\n\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n\n### Fee Distribution\n\n\n\n* Smart contract logic and UX/UI adjustments to be tested in a staging environment\n* Upon completion of beta testing, code would go to Peckshield to review\n* Upon completion of the audit, implementation would occur upon launch of Radiant v2\n\n\n### DAO OpEx Fund\n\nIf RFP-7 passes, a subsequent proposal will be brought forth to the DAO which will further outline the parameters of the OpEx fund. \n\nThis proposal will seek to define:\n* Types of expenses that require submission and approval from the DAO\n* Designated wallet address for OpEx fund\n\n## Overall Cost/Impact\n\n### Cost\nLikely some maintenance dev cost, no additional structured costs beyond existing time/resources spent in development.\n\n### Impact\n\nAnticipated shift towards “sticky” capital and protocol longevity.\n\n## Timeline\n\nImplementation of fee redistribution and changes to vesting would go into effect upon launch of v2, and would deploy on all subsequent Radiant chains (current & future).\n\n## Voting\n\n* **In Favor:** Supportive of the RFP-7 v2 design proposals\n* **Against:** Against implementation of the RFP-7 v2 design proposals\n* **Abstain:** Undecided, but contributing to quorum",

      "title": "RFP-6: v2 Vesting and Locking - Protocol Mechanics",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nRFP-6 proposes changes to the vesting and locking mechanisms.\n\n## Motivation\nFixed unlock periods create unnecessary FUD. Grouping unlock events into universal weekly epochs creates weird game theory dynamics which aren’t particularly helpful or useful.\n\nAs liquid tokens, expired locks should not receive the same treatment as locked RDNT tokens.\n\nIt is imperative that Radiant v2 rewards and encourages long-term support of the Radiant protocol in alignment with the Radiant DAO core value of **collective benefit**.\n\n\n## Key Terms\n\n\n\n* **Epoch:** a period of time used to mark specific events in the life of a blockchain network.\n* **Longtermism:** an ethical stance which gives priority to improving the long-term future of a system.\n\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe following protocol changes are being proposed for v2:\n\n\n### Vesting & Locking: Expired Locks Treatment (1 of 3)\n\n_v1 Design_\n\n* Expired locks continued to earn protocol fees\n\n_v2 Design Proposal_\n\n* Expired locks will be removed from the locking pool and no longer receive protocol fees\n* The proposed mechanism will utilize “searcher” bots that look for expired locks and remove them from the pool upon a successful check and contract call\n\n_Rationale_\n\nThe original v1 locking mechanism is flawed: there is no reason to continue earning locking fees on a token if the lock period has expired. This gives users free optionality by allowing them to keep their tokens in the lock pool and continuing to earn exit penalties and protocol fees—all while having access to their full balance at any time, even after lock expiry.\n\nUsers will now have to decide whether or not to re-lock their tokens upon expiration of the lock, as it should be designed.\n\n\n### Vesting and Locking: Removal of 7-Day Epochs (2 of 3)\n\n_v1 Design_\n\n* Vesting and locking periods are grouped into 7-day epochs which release all vests & locks at the same time. This has the adverse effect of creating a weekly cycle of “FUD unlock events”.\n\n_v2 Design Proposal_\n\n* Removal of the 7-day lock cycle. Tokens will vest based on a user’s individual vesting schedule, and locks will expire independently.\n\n_Rationale_\n\nThe \"epoch\" approach used by Geist Finance produced unintended adverse effects, including large amounts of tokens all unlocking simultaneously.\n\nThis grouping also incentivizes users to wait until the last possible second to lock their tokens, as locking them on day 1 vs. day 6 would bucket all of these into the same epoch—which is unfair to those who locked up earlier.\n\nThese _en masse_ unlocks created unnecessary FUD, and the batched nature of these unlocks resulted in misaligned incentives. It is more practical to distribute token unlocks over time in line with each individual's vesting schedule than in batches on a weekly basis.\n\n\n### Vesting and Locking: Duration of Vest and Lock (3 of 3)\n\n_V1 Design_\n\n* Vesting and locking periods are 28 days\n\n_V2 Design Proposal_\n\n* The vesting period for earned RDNT through emissions extends to **90 days**.\n* Protocol is currently exploring the technical feasibility of offering different locking lengths ranging from 1-12 months for different reward tiers. If feasible, a tiered structure will be implemented in v2, subject to community vote on weightings in a future RFP.\n\n_Rationale_\n\nMany users and advisors have noted that the protocol currently does not sufficiently reward longtermism vs. speculative short-term actions.\n\nThis extension of the vesting and locking period, coupled with the potential locking of LP tokens on each chain, will create more certainty about liquidity at any given time—and reduce potential risk for investors during \"black swan\" bank run scenarios.\n\nThe protocol should offer greater compensation to investors who choose extended lock periods, while not overlooking those who prefer shorter profiles. To be successful, the protocol must appeal to as broad a range of participants as possible.\n\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n* Smart contract and front end logic have been completed in a test environment\n* Upon completion of beta testing, code will go to PeckShield for review\n* Upon completion of the audit, implementation would take place immediately upon launch of Radiant v2\n\n\n## Overall Cost/Impact\n\nLikely some maintenance dev cost, no additional structured costs beyond existing time/resources spent in development.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\nImplementation would go into effect upon launch of v2, and would deploy on all subsequent Radiant chains (current & future).\n\n**Summary of RFP-6 v2 Design Proposals**\n\n1. Remove expired locks from protocol fee streaming\n2. Removal of universal seven-day unlock epochs for locking/vesting\n3. Change vesting and lock durations; implement variable lock lengths tailored to the individual user\n\n## Voting\n\n- **In Favor:** Supportive of the RFP-6 v2 design proposals\n- **Against:** Against implementation of the RFP-6 v2 design proposals\n- **Abstain:** Undecided, but contributing to quorum",

      "content": "## Abstract\n\n* RFP-5 proposes changes to **early exit penalties** in Radiant v2. \n* Early discussions around the changes proposed in RFP-5 are available [here](https://community.radiant.capital/t/v2-protocol-mechanics-part-1-of-3-dynamic-liquidity-provisioning-dlp/320?n=1671486230203).\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn **[RFP-4](https://dao.radiant.capital/#/proposal/0x058ea8db46ec92bfec2a36691aba75f671f04e99c6ffa7141768e3760d8bf584)**, we outlined why most protocols in DeFi 1.0 failed, and why the proposed upgrades to Radiant v2 will usher in a new, sustainable ecosystem that provides real cross-chain lending/borrowing utility to all Radiant ecosystem users.\n\nIn Radiant v1, community members voiced their concern over the harsh 50% exit penalty applied to vesting Radiant rewards, regardless of when a user exits their vest. A user could exit on day 1 or day 20 of their vesting period and pay the same penalty.\n\nIt was requested that the Radiant DAO dev team implement a “linear sliding scale” for exit penalties - depending on when a user exits their vest.\n\nAdditionally, in order to preserve the longevity of the protocol and keep RDNT scarce, early exit penalties would be returned to the DAO (90%) and burned (10%). \n\n## **Specifications**\n\nThe following **two** mechanic changes are being proposed for Radiant v2: \n\n#### 1. Exit Penalty: Static vs. Dynamic Penalty\n\n_v1 Design_\n\n* 50% exit penalty is applied to vesting Radiant, regardless of when a user exits the vest\n* Exit penalty RDNT tokens are distributed to lockers of RDNT\n\n_v2 Design Proposal_\n* Implement a linear sliding scale exit penalty, depending on when a user exits a vest\n* The penalty will start at **90%** and, in a linear fashion, decline to **25%** by the end of the vest\n\n_Rationale_\n* Users who exit a vest on day 1 vs. day 27 are currently penalized in the same way, which doesn’t make sense\n* This dynamic penalty will reward long-term users and penalize short-term liquidity providers who are just looking to “farm & dump” tokens\n* Makes the decision less binary about whether to exit or vest\n\n#### 2. Exit Penalty - Token Distribution\n\n_v1 Design_\nExit penalty tokens are distributed to RDNT lockers and are “fully liquid” in the market.\n\n_v2 Design Proposal_\nExit penalty tokens are split in the following ways:\n* 90% of the “Exit Penalty tokens” will return to the RDNT DAO reserve to be used for future emissions and community initiatives\n\n* 10% of tokens are burned from circulation\n\n_Rationale_\nThis change has the net effect of significantly **slowing the rate of inflation** and also **extending the runway** of the RDNT DAO Reserve, given that emissions can be re-circulated at a later date from users who do not wait until the end of their vesting periods.\n\nThis distribution helps solve one of the core issues--given the percentage of early exits observed--that the inflation into the market was too high, relative to protocol fees generated.\n\nBurning a portion from circulation serves as a deflationary mechanism in what is otherwise an inflationary schedule, akin to an EIP-1559 for ETH.\n\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n* Smart contract and front-end logic have been completed\n* Upon completion of beta testing, code would go to PeckShield to review\n* Upon completion of the audit, implementation would occur upon launch of Radiant v2\n\n## Overall Cost/Impact\n\n* Maintenance dev cost\n* No additional structured costs beyond existing time/resources spent in development\n\n\n## Timeline\n\nImplementation would go into effect upon launch of v2, and would deploy on all subsequent Radiant chains (current & future).\n\n## Summary of RFP-5 v2 Design Proposals\n\n1. Update the current 50% early exit penalty (triggered regardless of when a user exits in 28-day vest period) with a **linear sliding scale**, in which exit penalties are dependent on when a user exits their vest (ranging from 90%-25%). \n \n2. Update current structure in which 100% of exit penalties go to lockers with:\n    * 90% of the exit penalty tokens will return to the RDNT DAO Reserve to be used for future emissions and community initiatives\n    * 10% of tokens are burned from circulation\n\n## Voting\n- **In Favor:** Supportive of the RFP-5 v2 Design Proposals\n- **Against:** Against implementation of the RFP-5 v2 Design Proposals\n- **Abstain:** Undecided, but contributing to quorum",

      "title": "RFP-4: Dynamic Liquidity Provisioning - Core: Principles",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\n-   RFP-4 proposes the implementation of **Dynamic Liquidity** for Radiant v2, in which users who lock up a certain percentage of their LP tokens (relative to the size of their deposit) will receive RDNT emissions as lenders or borrowers.\n\n-   The proposed initial threshold for eligibility is 5% of the USD value of deposits. This would mean that for $100 in USD equivalent deposits, a user would need to have $5 equivalent of LP tokens to earn RDNT emissions.    \n\n-   This threshold will be reviewed quarterly (at minimum), based on the market conditions and preferences of the RDNT DAO.    \n\n-   Discussion around changes to v2 mechanics is available [here](https://community.radiant.capital/t/v2-protocol-mechanics-part-1-of-3-dynamic-liquidity-provisioning-dlp/320?n=1671486230203).\n    \n\n## Motivation\n\nDeFi 1.0 is laden with copycat protocols with limited utility and governance tokens that are used in high-burn emissions programs.\n\nExisting emissions models have failed to retain value over time. For example, the chart shown in the Discourse link shared above tracks DPI, the “DeFi pulse index” of DeFi 1.0 tokens against ETH over time. A vast majority of these protocols have been farmed into the ground.\n\nThis trend occurred for several reasons:\n\n1.  The tokens did not provide sufficient utility, and “governance-only” tokens were appropriately priced over time relative to the value of governance for that protocol\n    \n2.  A low barrier exists to earning DeFi tokens for mercenary liquidity providers. LPs could deposit tokens, earn yield, sell off tokens, and then move on once yields compressed. This pattern was seen time and time again with many DeFi protocols.\n    \nSince the launch several months ago, Radiant Capital contributors have spent significant time strategizing with community members and advisors about how to address these problems via **Radiant V2**.\n\nRadiant V2 includes changes to core protocol mechanics, emissions, utility, and deeper cross-chain functionality.\n\nHere is a summary of takeaways from conversations with community members and advisors:  \n \n1.  **Initial emissions were unsustainable and led to too much inflation.** While this sparked an early surge in the total value of deposits (peaking at around $500M), mercenary liquidity was not “sticky” and did not further the protocol's capabilities. This emissions model prompted band-aid solutions such as [RFP-2](https://dao.radiant.capital/#/proposal/0xbdf3daeda12219b9d19acdbbb6a2b0be3faa741573c1b8ae325b3737e76e9d95) to reduce emissions.\n    \n2.  **Insufficient runway.** The original tokenomics detailed how lender/borrower emissions would expire after 24 months, which is insufficient to achieve the long-term cross-chain vision\n    \n3.  **A low incentive to provide liquidity to the protocol.** Single-sided staking gave users utility in the form of protocol fees, even with reward tokens distributed at high rates for RDNT LPs\n    \n4.  **Exit penalties were not optimally designed.** A user who exits on the final day of a vest shouldn’t be penalized in the same way as someone who exits within the first minute of a vest. This system forces users into a suboptimal binary decision (exit or fully vest). Consequently, this led to a high exit rate in the early days and further highlighted the need for inert liquidity.\n    \n5.  **Fixed unlock periods create unnecessary FUD.** Grouping unlock events into universal weekly epochs creates weird game theory dynamics which aren’t particularly helpful or useful.\n    \n6.  **Mercenary capital is incentivized.** This is not exclusive to Radiant, but there is a general trend in decentralized finance toward mercenary capital—investors who [extract as much value from the protocol as possible](https://www.wonderlandforum.xyz/t/tmp-10-deploy-stablecoins-on-radiant-capital/20064), and move on when yields compress.\n    \n7.  **Proposed shift from single-sided locks to LP locks present additional IL risks.** Good discussion around this concept lives in Discourse, but given concerns about IL, there is a push from users to provide additional utility to LP lockers.\n \nDiscussions with community members and advisors centered around a similar idea: *How does a future version of Radiant create a better utility exchange between lenders/ borrowers and the protocol?* What should users have to do to earn emissions?\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Introducing “Dynamic Liquidity” - Rewarding Long-Term Investors\nPer discussions with community members, a new mechanism is proposed: **Dynamic Liquidity Provisioning**. This proposal would mean that only a subset of users would be “eligible” for emissions at any given time based on the value they provide to the protocol.  \n\nThis is part one in a series of posts originally shared by community members in Discourse outlining various strategies to solve some of Radiant’s initial constraints while ushering in a new ecosystem which our community has colloquially labeled as “DeFi 3.0”.\n\nAn ecosystem focused on:\n-   Sustainable \"real yields”    \n-   Legitimate value accrual leading to positive PNLs for the DAO (Profit & Loss statements)\n-   Higher barrier to entry to earn emissions\n-   Use cases with real utility for the future and longevity of DeFi (seamless cross-chain borrowing within minutes)\n\nSo: how does Dynamic Liquidity Provisioning solve some of DeFi 1.0’s pain points?  \n\n*TL;DR:*  \n1) Users that provide value to protocol unlock the ability to earn incentivized (RDNT) emissions.\n\n2) Users that simply deposit but don't add value to the protocol will continue to earn natural market rates, but won’t earn RDNT emissions.\n\nUsers will need to provide a minimum of __5% of locked LP tokens relative to the size of their deposits__ (in USD terms) to the protocol in order to unlock RDNT emissions on deposits & borrows.\n\n  \nUser 1: Puts 1M USDC on Radiant and has $0 of LP tokens locked. The user would earn a base deposit APY but **would NOT** earn incentivized emissions.\n\nUser 2: Puts 1M USDC on Radiant and has $50,000 of RDNT/BNB dLP locked. This user **would** be eligible for RDNT emissions (assuming the minimum 5% threshold is met).\n\n[The first discussion](https://community.radiant.capital/t/improve-rdnt-on-chain-liquidity-for-v2/174?n=1670609630376) around shifting from a single-sided lock to an LP lock will have the impact of improving on-chain liquidity across-chains. The hope is that this will be an additional incentive, given some of the fair points mentioned by community members regarding IL risk\n\n**This dichotomy fosters a healthy flywheel of value capture & new game mechanics.** Farmers will be attracted to the higher yields, since only a few participants will initially qualify for the dLP-boosted emissions threshold. This could, in turn, drive demand for dLP.\n\nAs demand for dLP increases, the market cap rises. Thus, emissions for eligible RDNT yield farmers will rise, driving additional demand to meet the dLP requirement.\n\nA fun potential game mechanic can emerge where selling pressure is met by natural buyers who wish to remain eligible for RDNT emissions by defending their 5% eligibility threshold.\n\nIn this model, an ecosystem emerges where distributions (company expenses) only grow as “value to protocol” (liquidity, borrowing & buying) grows.\n\n*Here is how the proposed mechanism would function:*\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uXmKG_d8ivpilEI3Ij1tvU-5B3fiPdjazUwVp9vCUjowm-sKz8OvVyxwINq-PdHI7L1NH1By0yzIlKM3kmBoJIFCFWdzcPDu-SP2kcAhOrtRcIwG_dIuUuoD7utVOps21YnTus9-M5M4wDgntwnDJYac-svmmbUCtQ2sefzY1VjfVwRKY872p-pFIroI0Q)\n\n**What is the net effect of this?**\nWhen we looked at the existing lenders/borrowers on v1 of RDNT, most of the largest lenders and borrowers had 0 RDNT locked. Therefore, in v1, most TVL would be “ineligible” for reward emissions.\n\nThis change means eligible users would receive meaningfully higher emissions, assuming the same number of RDNT emitted per second. So there becomes an exciting feedback loop that can be constructive in helping to attract long-term liquidity and rewarding those most aligned with the long-term success of the protocol.\n\n**What happens if LP tokens reduce in value or deposits increase in value, thus taking a user from “eligible” to “ineligible”?**  \nThis is part of the equation that a user needs to consider– how close to the threshold they will be, relative to the total value of their deposits. If the LP value / total value deposited falls below the threshold, then emissions will cease to that user, and are redistributed to all eligible users. This reallocation would happen dynamically.\n\n**Won’t TVL decrease?**  \nMercenary TVL adds little value to the protocol in the form of larger markets, does not promote long-termism, and this type of capital is fleeting.  \n  \nUsers who wish to deposit collateral with zero exposure to RDNT, can earn market rates (paid in the deposited asset). However, if this same user wishes to borrow USDT to invest in an NFT project on AVAX, they can still do so while paying market borrow rates (just like a bank).\n  \nThe protocol is better suited for long-term liquidity providers and those looking to add value to the protocol. Also, if TVL leaves, the APR for the remaining eligible lenders and borrowers will proportionally increase. This will have the net effect of attracting new lenders/borrowers again–but this time, users who are comfortable with adding liquidity to the protocol through LP on a DEX.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n-   Smart contract logic for Dynamic Liquidity has been developed and beta tested\n-   Code will need to be reviewed by PeckShield \n-   Upon successful audit, RFP-4 would be part of the v2 Radiant deployment\n    \n\n## Overall Cost/Impact\n\n-   Likely some maintenance dev cost, no additional structured costs beyond existing time/resources spent in development\n \n## Timeline\n-   Implementation would go into effect upon launch of v2, and would deploy on all Radiant Protocol chains (current + future)\n\n## Voting\n- **In Favor**: In Favor of implementing Dynamic Liquidity for v2 with 5% initial threshold\n- **Against**: Against implementation of Dynamic Liquidity\n- **Abstain**: Undecided, but contributing to quorum",

      "title": "RFP-3: Improve RDNT On-Chain Liquidity for v2 - Fund Allocation",
      "content": "**Abstract** \nOne of the issues facing the Radiant protocol in the early days has been the need for a deep on-chain liquidity pool for the RDNT token, with current total liquidity on-chain currently at ~$1M. While the liquidity pool is sufficient for small buys and sells, it is prohibitive for larger buyers and sellers. For example, a $25K buy of RDNT leads to a 4% price impact, which is not conducive to attracting funds and larger buyers and sellers.\n\nWhile the initial approach was to attract external LP through heavily incentivized emissions, that proved to be an inefficient method, as the incentivized emissions in RDNT only led to a marginal increase in LP liquidity. The feedback that the community gave on this could be summarized as follows:\n\n* It did not make sense to LP when the single-sided RDNT token locking provided a compelling value in terms of protocol fees\n* The 50-50 pool has too much impermanent loss given the volatility of the RDNT token, and thus is not attractive to potential outside LPs\n* Using a WETH pair prevents LPs from taking advantage of the staked ETH yield, which has shown to be very compelling\n\nWhile working on Radiant V2 architecture, critical community feedback discussed ways to improve liquidity, reduce slippage, and create a fairer exchange for users who provide value to the protocol.\n\n**Motivation**\nImproving on-chain liquidity would provide a more seamless experience for Radiant Protocol users as well as new entrants to Radiant across Arbitrum, BNB, and future chain deployments.\n\n**Specifications**\n\n1. **Shifting the current 50-50 Arbitrum RDNT-WETH pool (0.3% fee) on SushiSwap to an 80-20 RDNT-wstETH pool on Balancer Protocol (0.5% fee)**\n\n* This proposal will lead to meaningfully less IL than on a 50-50 pool, and the “ask” of LPs in terms of putting up ETH is meaningfully less than the 50-50 pool\n* While the price impact on 80-20 pools is greater than 50-50, the additional capital this will attract will more than offset the price impact changes and on a net basis, will improve liquidity and reduce slippage overall on-chain\n* Using an LSD (liquid staking derivative) on Balancer would make this eligible for one of Balancer’s core pools, which means that Balancer’s portion of the protocol fees (50%) would be refunded in the form of bribes to the LP pool\n* A slightly higher trading fee is also a disincentive mechanism for instantly dumping RDNT earned through emissions and is more in line with the volatility profile of the RDNT token\n* Changing the WETH pair to wstETH (wrapped staked ETH through Lido) allows LPs also to take advantage of staked ETH yield on top of the fees they are earning as an LP, removing the opportunity cost of becoming an LP with WETH\n* There isn’t an adequate Balancer-equivalent on BNB Chain, so that LP pool will need to be 50-50 RDNT-WBNB, or potentially a staked wBNB derivative\n\n2. **Radiant V2 Functionality - Requiring Locked LP tokens instead of single-sided RDNT to earn protocol fees on all chains**\n\n* Solely locking RDNT tokens does not improve liquidity of the protocol; rather it serves to delay tokens coming into the market. By requiring locking LP tokens instead of single sided RDNT, the liquidity profile will meaningfully improve for the RDNT token\n* The exchange of value here has been imbalanced, as it makes sense for those with “skin in the game” to be the ones that are the beneficiaries of protocol fees. These are the users that provide liquidity and enable the protocol to operate more seamlessly\n* This would apply to Arbitrum when re-launched with v2 functionality, BNB, and any additional chains the Radiant protocol deploys to\n* With LP tokens capturing all of the protocol fees, the feedback would be to eliminate Pool2 emissions entirely, as a way to further reduce RDNT inflation (LP staking emissions have already been reduced 85%)\n\n**Steps to Implement** \n\n* Upon launch of v2, move current Arbitrum 50-50 RDNT-WETH Sushi pool (0.3% fee) to an 80-20 RDNT-wstETH Balancer pool (0.5% fee)\n* Shift protocol fees from single sided staking RDNT lockers to locked LP tokens (Balancer Pool Tokens for Arbitrum, PCS for BNB, etc.) to earn protocol fees\n* Reduce “Pool2” emissions to 0\n\n**Timeline**\nThese changes would be put into effect upon the v2 launch of the protocol. Would do so gradually so there would be some overlap of 50/50 and 80/20 pools, but locking LP tokens would be implemented at launch of v2\n\n**Overall Cost**\nMinimal. This would be a shift of existing liquidity.",

      "title": "RFP-2: Emission Reductions - Core: Ecosystem Fund Allocation",
      "content": "![RFP-2](https://i.ibb.co/cN53bRN/RFP-2.png)\n\n## ABSTRACT\nThis proposal seeks to address the long-term success of the Radiant protocol by means of adjusting the rate of Arbitrum RDNT emissions to more sustainable levels.\n\n\n## MOTIVATION\nWhereas the front-loaded emissions structure was a tool used to promote utility for RDNT, Radiant Capital is currently “over-emitting” into the protocol, relative to the protocol fees being generated. Consequently, this emissions structure dilutes current RDNT in circulation at an unsustainable rate.\n\nIn order to achieve Radiant’s omnichain vision, we must earmark emissions for our forthcoming deployment on BNB Chain, as well as other networks that will be supported in succession. This change must be effected in order to attract new users while still maintaining competitive yields when compared to other DeFi money markets.\n\n\n## RATIONALE\nRFP-2 aligns with the Radiant DAO’s core principles of **Determination** and **Collective Benefit**. Long-term sustainability is imperative to the success of the protocol and subsequently, its community. It is important for the Radiant DAO to make critical adjustments such as these in order to ensure the best possible product.\n\nThe objectives of reducing emissions are as follows:\n* Reduce Arbitrum RDNT supply inflation to more sustainable levels.\n* Further enable community-driven governance for emissions through the creation of the **RDNT DAO Reserve**, a multisig wallet which will be tasked with emission management for new chain deployments as well as any major emissions allocations changes, governed by RDNT tokenholders.\n* Maintain competitiveness with the yields in our existing ecosystem, as well as for potential future deployments. \n* Make RDNT more scarce.\n\n\n## KEY TERMS\n* **Emission Rate** - The speed at which tokens are created and released into circulation. Emission rate determines–or limits–how quickly these coins will be released. Typically, when a cryptocurrency is relatively new, the emission rates are high. As time progresses, this rate gradually drops until the maximum supply is reached.\n* **Multisig** -  Shorthand for “multiple signature”. A specific type of digital signature or wallet that operates with multiple signatory addresses. A multisig wallet requires more than one private key to sign and authorize any given transaction.\n\n\n## SPECIFICATIONS\nGiven the immutability of the Radiant smart contracts, we can’t simply “dial down” emissions. Instead, we propose to direct RDNT emissions into a DAO-governed multisig wallet (the “**RDNT DAO Reserve**”). \n\nThe RDNT DAO Reserve will be governed by RDNT tokenholders and executed by a Council-directed _2-of-3_ multisig. It will be responsible for major emissions allocation changes, as well as for the routing of extant emissions across current and subsequent chain deployments. \n\nThe Council proposes the following percentage reductions to the current token emission structure::\n* Arbitrum Lending/Borrowing Emissions: -50%\n* Global Ecosystem/Core Contributor Emissions: -50%\n* Global Team Tokens: -50%\n\nBy doing a straight reduction of team emissions by 50% while keeping the total supply at 1B tokens, the original team allocation would effectively be reduced from 20% to 10% of the fully diluted supply.\n\nConsequently, this proposal recommends that the original team allocation remain at a 20% share of the _circulating_ token supply, such that if a future proposal were to recommend an allocation from the RDNT DAO reserve (e.g., for BNB emissions), the original team allocation of the circulating supply would remain equal to 20%.\n\nThis aligns with our initial vision and would prevent the Team from being issued too many or too few tokens relative to the total in circulation. Furthermore, it ensures that the Team’s total number of tokens will grow as the protocol expands, in accordance with the original emission schedule published at protocol genesis.\n\n\n## STEPS TO IMPLEMENT\n* Snapshot vote on RFP-2: Emissions Reduction\n* Establish RDNT DAO Reserve multisig\n* Implement adjustments to token allocations, as outlined\n    * Calculate adjusted Lend/Borrow Allocation Points\n    * Setup DAO Reserve as recipient of surplus emissions\n    * Execute changes via Timelock\n\n\n## TIMELINE\n* 23-September 2022 – RFP-2 Emission Reductions Proposal goes live, with 24h warmup and 24h vote window (ref. “Process – Procedural Exceptions” in RFP-1).\n* 25-September 2022 – Pursuant to quorum and majority “In favor” vote, RFP-2 is ratified and enters 48h timelock. RDNT DAO Reserve multisig formed; address shared to public via [https://docs.radiant.capital](https://docs.radiant.capital).\n* 26-27-September 2022 – Emission reductions instated\n\n\n## OVERALL COST/IMPACT\n\n\n### OUTLAY\nNo significant operational costs.\n\n\n### IMPACT\nIt is possible that we will see a decrease in Arbitrum TVL in the short term due to the lowering of yields. However, we believe that emissions will be better served by the RDNT DAO Reserve, and that they will likely be put to better use on subsequent chain deployments, relative to the current structure (with all emissions focused on Arbitrum). The belief is that this to be in the best long-term interest of the protocol, in order to achieve its omnichain vision.\n\nThe utility of Radiant will be enhanced because yields will remain competitive for lenders, even with the proposed emission reductions. Furthermore, the \"real yield\" earned from locking RDNT remains industry-leading (currently >150% in BTC/ETH/Stables), relative to competitive money markets. Consequently, while we can’t predict the future, we don't anticipate emission reductions as outlined in this proposal to induce significant retail migration to other yield platforms.",

      "content": "![RFP-1](https://i.ibb.co/zn8Vgtn/RFP-1.jpg)\n    \n## ATTENTION\nThis proposal (RFP-1) outlines the formation of the **Radiant DAO** including its criteria, composition and workflow. Should it pass, this proposal intends to serve as a reference point for all subsequent matters of governance.  \n  \nConsequently, it is a comprehensive document that extends far beyond Snapshot’s character limit. Certain sections will be outlined directly in this post, but **it is imperative for anyone who wishes to vote to read the entire proposal in full**.  \n  \nThe entirety of RFP-1 can be viewed [here](https://ipfs.radiant.capital/ipfs/QmNguYWcCLMGFtgdd1ye15mM463CBYqpH1KfGmG95CGR1F), or via the embedded “Discussion” link at the end of this proposal.\n\n## PROPOSAL\nThis document proposes the structure of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to be governed by community members who lock **RDNT**, a decentralized ERC-20 token that the community intends to serve as the primary token for governing the Radiant Protocol.\n\n## **PURPOSE**\nSupernova Holdings (the “**Foundation**”) will serve the **Radiant DAO** by fostering a community ethos of dialogue and innovation, and will provide the frameworks necessary for decentralized governance on both a granular and a macro level. \n\nTo achieve this, it is important to ensure that the processes of proposal submission and voting are restricted to Radiant DAO members. The sole requirement for membership in the DAO is to have any given amount of RDNT tokens held within Radiant’s MultiFeeDistribution smart contract (hereby referred to as “**locked RDNT**”). A user’s balance of locked RDNT will proportionally represent their voting weight on all proposals.\n\nIn alignment with the Foundation’s core value of transparency, all preliminary discussions, proposals, votes cast and outcomes will be publicly available to view.\n\n## **FOUNDATION & VALUES**\nThe **Foundation**, which will serve the Radiant DAO community and be governed by it, aims to be the executive arm of the protocol by implementing the consensus-driven will of the Radiant DAO.\n\nThe Radiant DAO community will have the power to submit proposals, vote on proposals, and bring those to fruition.\n\nThe Foundation adheres to four core values:\n1. **_Innovation_**: We focus on ways to think big and bold to accelerate innovation across ecosystems.\n2. **_Determination_**: We’d rather be iterating frequently than never trying. “Better a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without.”\n3. **_Collective Benefit_**: Solve for the customer–not just their happiness, but also their success.\n4. **_Transparency_**: “Sunlight is the best disinfectant.” -Louis Brandeis\n\nAs we grow, our processes and strategies may change, but these guiding values will remain the same.\n\n## **SPECIFICATIONS**\n* DAO Hub: The Foundation website ([radiant.capital](https://app.radiant.capital/)), which will provide an interface to educate DAO members on the governance process and provide easy access to the channels described below in order to streamline the DAO’s operation and enhance its utility.\n* Communication Channel: **Discourse - [community.radiant.capital](https://community.radiant.capital)**\n    * RDNT holders must go through a wallet authentication process to post ideas or give feedback to ideas via comments.\n    * RFP Idea posts must be approved by a moderator to ensure they meet all predetermined guidelines and template requirements.\n    * All posts and comments will be regularly monitored by both a team of moderators & administrators engaged by the Foundation and by the DAO community members themselves. There will be zero tolerance for hate speech anywhere on this platform.\n    * The Author of an idea via a post in community.radiant.capital cannot edit the original post. If the Author wants to propose changes to the original idea, the Author must do this via the comments.\n    * Seven (7) days after it has been posted, an RFP Idea is closed to community feedback and will be automatically locked by Discourse.\n* Process for Draft Submission via Template:\n    * Once an idea is approved in community.radiant.capital after the seven-day community feedback cycle, a moderator will contact the Author to provide the appropriate template.\n    * The Author should then submit an official RFP draft to the Intake Administrator using the template.\n    * The administrator may then continue communication with the Author to inform them of any incorrect or missing information that needs to be changed—or clarifications that need to be made— for the RFP Draft to move to the next step.\n    * If the Author does not respond to the Administrator’s request to change, update, or make clarifications on the RFP Draft within seven (7) days, the RFP Draft will be automatically rejected.\n* Platform where Live RFPs are Hosted: **Snapshot - [dao.radiant.capital](https://dao.radiant.capital)**\n    * RDNT holders must go through a wallet authentication process to vote on Snapshot.\n    * Council Members are the only ones allowed to launch RFPs on Snapshot as they must ensure each RFP has gone through the correct approval process.\n    * The voting mechanics shall be:\n        * Only locked RDNT will be eligible to vote.\n        * New proposals that meet the required guidelines will be launched in batches every Thursday at 9PM ET.\n        * User balance of locked RDNT will be referenced by block height at proposal launch.\n        * There will be a 24 hour “warm-up” period in order to allow a final review period for any superficial errors, as well as to encourage maximum voter engagement.\n        * The voting options for a Live RFP are “In favor”, “Against”, and “Abstain”. Voting “In favor” means the voter is in favor of implementing the RFP exactly as-is. Voting “Against” means the vote is against implementing the RFP exactly as-is – one may vote “Against” to encourage the Author to resubmit the RFP after making changes. Voting to “Abstain” means the vote is neither In Favor nor Against implementing the RFP, but the vote weight still will be counted towards quorum.\n        * The voting for each proposal in each weekly batch will be open for voting for five (5) days, closing at approximately 9PM ET on the following Wednesday.\n        * A vote must reach greater than 50% of votes cast “In favor” in order to pass.\n        * Furthermore, a vote must meet a quorum of 10% of circulating locked RDNT supply, to be determined at current block height when vote is initiated.\n        * Proposals that are approved by the holders of the requisite number of locked RDNT are moved to the Foundation for implementation.\n        * Only Administrators can post RFPs to Snapshot in order to ensure that each one has gone through the correct approvals process.\n* Procedural Exceptions\n    * For the sake of expediency and the long-term health of the protocol, RFP-1 (DAO Proposal) and RFP-2 (Emission Reduction Proposal) will be expedited according to the following process:\n        * RFP-1 and RFP-2 proposals will be submitted directly to Snapshot as “Approved to Vote” RFPs.\n        * RFP-1 and RFP-2 will undergo a 24 hour warm-up period, followed by a 24 hour vote window.\n        * In consideration of the expedited vote window, quorum will be adjusted to 2% of circulating locked RDNT supply, determined at block height when vote is initiated.\n\n\n## **IMPLEMENTATION**\n### TIMELINE \n_(Dated to EDT GMT-4)_\n* 14-September 2022 – Signing of Company Charter & Adoption Bylaws\n* 15-September 2022 – RFP-1: DAO Proposal\n* 17-September 2022 – DAO ratification (pending consensus)\n\n### PROCESSES\n1.
