This proposal outlines some initial changes to ROBOT tokenomics that will set the stage for a larger \"v2 tokenomics\" revamp in the future.\n\n### Current Metrics:\n- Circulating Supply: 220,525\n- Maximum Supply: 420,000\n\n\n### Primary proposed change to tokenomics:\n- End buyer rewards moving forward\n- Direct fiat revenue share with designers / brands to reduce ROBOT sell pressure",

Packages shouldn’t have more than a 3 day delay between the time when it is ordered and the time when it is shipped. Keep space well organized in a good working condition. Fulfill incoming orders as well as customer service requests.\n\nReview KPIs and budget after 3-months -- January 2023\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFull Forum Breakdown:\n\nhttps://gov.metafactory.ai/t/fulfillment-overhaul-progress-report-compensation-proposal/460",

Again, this by no means captures the full roster of contributors that are deserving. Many originally proposed have opted-out, due to compensation coming from scoped project budgets, etc. Amounts set conservatively to prevent an unsustainable burn-rate with current market conditions while we scale in new broader directions.\n\nOps Distributions per the Milestone Distribution Schedule is unaffected. Other paths to stable/$ROBOT compensation encouraged via scoped project/budget and working group proposals taken to snapshot, such as what [M3org has been doing](https://gov.metafactory.ai/t/proposal-vr-fashion-shoots/362) and the recent [Creative Consortium Proposal.](https://gov.metafactory.ai/t/proposal-creation-of-creative-consortium/433)\n\nShould also establish a future bounty budget allocation soon for quicker compensation to part-time and one-off contributors and as a means to onboard/rain $ROBOT on new talent and community members. Can explore wholistic adjustments to the current Distro Schedule if needed to account for this approach.",

A new homepage will be dynamically updating to feature our current drops & content.\n\nDeliverable – 1 month after approval of proposal, well in advance of NFT NYC in mid June\n\nFunding: $10,000 total\n\n$5,000 to web developer Clay Colonna [requests payment in either ETH or USDC to his coinbase account, or payment in dollars]\n$3,500 to front end web designer Ben (Milfdad)\n$1,500 set aside for creation of any additional assets (mostly 3D renders, animations, metaverse content, and diagrams). [Most likely partner with Fraemwork, Jin, Wes]\n\nContinued Support: Clay will remain available for updates after the homepage is live, in order to make quick updates to the static sections, as we continue to grow. Clay’s hourly rate is $125/hour and he works very efficiently.\n\n*See linked forum post for full details*",

      "title": "Proposal: NYC Fulfillment & Operating space",
      "content": "\n* Description: As the Metafactory DAO grows, its needs and functional requirements grow as well. With the goal of eventually owning all of our fulfillment, the need to master our logistics skill is apparent. A large step in the roadmap is coleasing a 2000sqft space with one of our production partners (Decode) in the Brooklyn Navy Yards. \n\n* Manifesto/Vision: The current supply chain ecosystem is fragmented. Items are made, put up for sale, with the hopes that 80% of them sell. This space would be MetaFactory’s way of stepping into the new age of an ecosystem and offering a solution to logistics. MetaFactory is more than a brand, it is an operational platform for all things production; to innovate in options that don’t exist we need space to play, grow, and experiment with everything available to us.\n\n* Problem: One of the largest problems that Metafactory has faced are logistical challenges caused by having to bring 3rd party logistics providers into our ecosystem to fulfill our order volume. Additionally we are currently not able to offer dynamic or customizable shipping experience for our customers. While 3PLs can offer ‘Kitting’, we won’t have the best solutions until we start to understand and build them in house.\n\n* Solution: While bringing on new 3PLs might be an offering for temporary solutions, if we intend to master our customer experience we need to build out a temporary internal logistics operation for MetaFactory. By partnering with Decode and sharing a production/ fulfillment space with them we can start to offer truly On Demand production and fulfillment operations. This would allow us to remove the option of heavy inventory and reduce deadstock dramatically.\n\n* Product: The MF X Decode space can offer the foundation for production for all of our open edition basics (+fulfillment) and be our option for higher end fulfillment. Additionally, partnering in a space with Decode can offer more creative and innovative options for Metafactory’s growth such as Fulfillment DAO, all products production process tracked via Kong Chips, Upcycling waste, customization and 1/1 dying, and many more.\n\n* Validation: The 3PL space in NYC is weak to say the best. To find a logistics solution for a Microfactory such as Decode has already brought interest from ½ a dozen parties. The ability to handle production and logistics locally in NYC brings a lot of value to new partners in the area.\n\n* Progress: We have been partnering with Decode previously and have a strong working relationship. They are heavily motivated to build not just a brand with Metafactory but a new standard for sustainable & transparent production. We are currently ready to sign a month to month lease with them in the next week ( depending on DAO VOTEs)\n\n* Differentiation: By bringing this process in house allows us to demonstrate an On Demand production and fulfillment operation. This is currently only being done in a few places across the country and nearly non-existent for fashion. Coupling this with the Zero Waste mission that Decode brings can allow us to have a stronger and more impactful story to tell anyone who’s interested in stopping by.\n\n* Team: DamagedGoods, Cptn Skelator, Decode, Anyone in the NYC space can work here.\n\n* Grant Request $: $2700 per month for rent + General rent expenses.\n",

      "content": "Dear Robots, in the previous ops distribution proposal I suggested an amendment and requested a grant to catch me up for work done above and beyond the scope of the current Robot Distribution. \n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/metafactory.eth/proposal/QmczN7Chj7mAwznVrqachMcm3TKZjBk2htqtF9ZJFrcgXN\n\nThe previous vote was in favor of my proposal, thank you for your support in the previous vote. To give us time to audit the SourceCred initiatives and to split out my grant request, the core team proposed to nullify the previous ops distribution vote. \n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/metafactory.eth/proposal/QmW1M6XJo63RnzKoowrQqPWcipJipy12wtuuaDFNvBBiz4 \n\nI would like to take this opportunity to formally suggest a grant process and also restate my previous grant request. I will also provide additional visibility and rational into my grant request. To establish the process I will set reason and steps to follow to define the grant process. The grant format will require several pieces of key information.\n\nA Grant request is a specific request for funds from the organization for goods or services. Typically grants will be for retainer for contributors, but may be retroactive for past considerations of things like expense reimbursement. These grants ensure core contributors are able to focus their attention on the MetaFactory project.\n\nGrantees will request a specific amount and state a clear purpose for their grant. All grant request are to be proposed to the community. If community sentiment is favorable a grant may be proposed on Snapshot for official voting. \n\n\nGrant request title: penguin 2020 Core Contributor Grant\nGrant request amount: 2000 Robot\nGrant description: penguin is requesting a 2000 Robot Grant for catch-up payments for services rendered from  November 2019 through December 2020. During this 13 month window before the current ops consideration, I was an active contributor actively earning for MetaFactory. I helped provide suggestion and edits for initial medium articles. During my services there were many tasks that I contributed such as doing initial QC of T6, I gathered the process documents and created the initial alpha run bomber jacket and was a technician for all of the initial masks. I generated preview images and established connections with early artists and supporters. I generated several one off garments for MetaFactory performing product R&D and for early partners requests (Such as Alotta-Money). I leveraged personal connections and recruited clients to MetaFactory and supported client and robot support questions. I have provided impeccable customer service and community support. I provide white glove service to clients from intake interview request, through designs, product selection. I help set up drops and support clients during and post drop. During the past year of service I lead and supported 22 clients. I have brought on and trained new designers and technicians and enhanced the MetaFactory brand through direct marketing, writing articles and making videos. During this time I was on several pod-casts, live streams and supported MetaFactory initiatives from inside other core communities which have been clients. My wife and I routinely create new graphical assets to support MetaFactory assets such as making the robot faces into svgs and client work. We created physical art such as the Wicked Sunday Club Coasters and have printed and set thousands of stickers.\n\nGrant Rational:\nI have done all these things and many more without any compensation or consideration for my time or services. I routinely asked about ops distribution and tried to resolve the issue before the current Ops distribution. I humbly ask for 2000 Robot. This amount is based on approximate previous Robots distributions awarded to contributors. I believe this to be the fair value of work that I created during the initial uncertain times of MetaFactory as I helped support us through our initial growth phase. This grant is a catch-up amount and is not consideration for future work. There are no other contributors that could make such a claim and frequent robot distributions will ensure that we will not have future unsupported contributors. \n\n\nVoter Guide:\nA Vote For penguin's grant proposal will earmark 2000 Robot from the ops distribution for contributor catch up grant request.\n\nA Vote Against penguin's grant proposal will reject the grant request\n\nA vote to Abstain will support the outcome of the vote without voting in favor or against the proposal\n\nA vote to Discuss further will cancel the grant request, but allow for amendment of the grant request.

      "content": "Forum Thread with all the details: https://gov.metafactory.ai/t/proposal-9-adopting-sourcecred/181\n\n## The MF Covenant\n\nThe following is a list of guidelines that I'm proposing we adopt when thinking about how we coordinate and govern ourselves now and in the future.\n\n1. We should measure the value of contributions, not contributors.\n2. Contributors should be rewarded proportional to the impact they have, not how many hours they work.\n3. We should minimize how much time and effort we spend on governance and decision making since they just a means to an end, our mission is to create / build dope stuff and realize our collective vision of a web3 cultural economy / metaverse, not play governance games.\n4. We shouldn't incentivize behaviour that is self-optimizing at the expense of our larger goal / community.\n5. Our rewards should be outcome based. Distribute tokens for actual work done, not the promise of future work.\n6. We move forward at rough consensus (all objections within reason are fully addressed, not necessarily solved. Coherence around long term vision is reestablished, so that we can improve, iteratively, without stalling). This is the framework: https://andytudhope.africa/essays/running-code\n7. We establish a building / collective dreaming multiplier: i.e. we spend 10-20x time on building & collective dreaming to 1x governance.\n\nIf we don't rely on an agreed-upon process / framework, we will be very inaccurate / inefficient / biased / game-able when it comes to token allocation and delivering it in the most sound / incentive aligned way.\n\n## Process / Structure / Rules\n\n1. Active contributors are allowed to add new contributions in the [contribution dashboard](https://metafactory.retool.com/embedded/public/3cdd1037-d8f5-4b16-b42f-064f9f78be4e)\n2. Active contributors, Headbots and Alphabots are allowed to rate contributions (could apply weighting multiplier based on role)\n3. Any contributions that have been \"flagged\" will not make it into SourceCred until any concerns raised have been addressed.\n4. The weight of each contribution will be set in proportion to the ratings given. Higher rating = higher weight. \n\nWeight of a single vote: \n\n| Rating  |  Weight |\n|---|---|\n| legendary | 18  |\n| epic  | 9 |\n| rare |  3 |\n| common |  1 |\n\n`Weight of a contribution = (MEAN(voteWeights) + SUM(voteWeights) / 10) * 2`\n\n\n5. Any exploitative behaviour will not be accepted (e.g. collusion / quid-pro-quo, rating only your own contributions high, sybil attacks). This can only be enforced at a cultural / social level. We should all be aligned that the process works best when everyone is playing honestly.\n6. Every 6-8 weeks the contributions will be added to SourceCred and we will distribute ROBOT proportional to the $ sales milestones.\n7. Any issues with the distribution should be dealt with at the contribution / rating level. The resulting numbers from SourceCred should not get changed through any other means besides changing the input to SourceCred.",

      "content": "Forum thread - https://gov.metafactory.ai/t/proposal-6-seed-gear-eth-liquidity/121\n\n### Summary\n\nRun experiment on Sushiswap to see the affects of GEAR/ETH vs ROBOT/ETH on GEAR pool. Seed pools with $25k GEAR from treasury + $25k of ETH bought with DAI from Wells Fargo business loan ($50k of liquidity in total).\n\n### Description\n\nSince we don’t really know what the effects of having GEAR liquidity will have on the market we’re going to reframe this as an experiment. First we will run this experiment with GEAR/ETH run it again with ROBOT/ETH and compare the results of distribution and volume.\n\n#### Experiment Parameters:\n\n- DAO will seed each liquidity pool with $50k for 1 month\n- First experiment liquidity pool is remove immediately after time period ends\n- 1 month wait between the two experiments to establish new control variables\n- First pool is GEAR/ETH, second pool is ROBOT/ETH\n- Both experiments will occur on Sushiswap\n\n#### Primary Hypothesis\n\nProviding liquidity on a tier 1 DEX will increase demand/distribution of ROBOT token\n\nComparison of token distribution of similarish new/small DAOs (feel free to propose others to look at):\n\n|DAO |\tLiquidity |\t# of Holders |\n|-|-|-|\n|ROBOT|\t$3.2M|\t651 |\n|GEAR|\t$0\t|56|\n|NFTX\t|$11M\t|5,005|\n|YAM|\t$3M|\t7,587|\n|HAUS|\t$563k\t|1469|\n\nAs you can see we have comparable liquidity but much lower distribution to other alt DAOs. This could very well be because of the high swap fees and higher slippage which we’ve intentionally placed but it could also be that we are the only token not listed on a a tier 1 DEX on their home chain (Honeyswap is the best on xDAI afaik).\n\nObviously we want to keep the vibe and all these new token holders might not be about the MetaFactory life. While this isn’t quantifiable for the experiment we probably want to factor in dopeness of new DAO members when evaluating results of this experiments.\n\nBy making wider distribution of GEAR the goal we are saying we want the DAO to sell off GEAR and accumulate ETH. We can use this to calculate the Customer Acquisition Cost which would be CAC = Impermanent Loss on GEAR + gas fees / # of new GEAR holders - 1 (exclude SLP). We could get fancy and incorporate the price increase of ROBOT and treasury balance over the course of experiment into CAC calculation to see if this is profitable move for the MetaFactory as well.\n\n__Goal: Increase total ROBOT holders by 50% over the course of the experiment__\n\n(GEAR holders are included in the total since they implicitly hold ROBOT)\n\n#### Secondary Hypothesis\n\nListing GEAR/ETH on Sushiswap will generate more volume for the GEAR pool than listing ROBOT/ETH on Sushiswap\n\nSince GEAR is mostly denominated in ROBOT there is an arbitrage opportunity between GEAR NAV and the price on Sushiswap. If the Primary Hypothesis is correct there should be higher prices for GEAR or ROBOT on Sushiswap that will need to get arbed providing swap fees to GEAR LPs. Current daily volume on GEAR is ~$75k 1 and we need $300k on the GEAR/ETH pool to get it listed on Onsen so we need a 300% more volume on the new GEAR/ETH pool than we have on GEAR today.\n\n__Goal: Average daily volume for last 7 days of experiment is 60% higher than 1 month before the experiment.__",

The community members proposed we adjust this to the following instead, taking effect for all sales after $400k:\n\n- **42% of your purchase value back in ROBOT**\n- **Value of ROBOT is determined as the average price of ROBOT over the last 4 weeks from the week you made your purchase**\n\nIf you voted \"Yes, but change parameters\" please comment on the forum post with how you think they should be changed.\n",

This covers social media management, newsletter design and creation, website maintenance and general design work. There may be additional expenses related to specific campaigns (new Reels, etc.), but any budget overruns resulting from extra work will be voted on separately. \n\nIn full disclosure, when Hammad and I initially proposed a partnership with FLOC*, we offered them a small stake in MF in return for ongoing brand management and design support. The $ROBOT allocation that they received was compensation for this agreement, but not for services rendered. They are a creative collective with many different resources engaged and a non-trivial amount of overhead. However, due to aligned incentives and their love for MF, their ongoing rate for services is incredibly low - especially when measured against value delivered.'\n\nIf passed, we will continue to pay FLOC* €1,500/month in exchange for general brand management and design support. \n ",

Anyone who hasn’t redeemed the pass must redeem it before getting their share of ROBOT.\n\nFor Ops/Gov (36k ROBOT total):\n\n- 19,250 ROBOT to @burningfiat for leading the project over the last 10+ months and risking ~$70k out of pocket as startup capital + time/effort. He was not paid anything from MF.\n- 8,430 ROBOT to @METADREAMER for also leading the project over last 10 months and acting as creative director + “CTO”. Over 600 hours + ~$5k out of pocket contribution. He was not paid anything from MF.\n- 3,000 ROBOT to the FLOC team (@esepuntoge and @nosoccomtothom) for leading the branding and visual design of MetaFactory, building our homepage, and continued involvement in developing our narrative, managing social channels, and assisting with product design / development. Disclaimer: FLOC was also paid in fiat to cover their operating expenses as a studio.\n- 1,000 ROBOT to @jamesyoung for helping develop and experiment with various DAO / token mechanics over the last 5-6 months and writing the contract for the ROBOT token. He was not paid anything from MF.\n- 597 ROBOT to the sudden death bidder who was the 42nd member and missed in the original distribution (0x706c3b381DE2326df0acaa3248471D4D097E56b2)\n- 403 ROBOT to @lex_node for doing all the legal engineering that MF has explored over the last 6-7 months, including writing the terms/conditions for WSC and Genesis Sale and helping us refine our ideas / legal structure. He was paid in fiat for the majority of his work, but a lot of that went to others on his team that he worked with, and he indicated that he’s willing to contribute more as a ROBOT holder.\n- 570 ROBOT to Felipe Duarte who has been helping manage our internal operations and building out our 3D rendering workflow as well as doing some community / partner engagement. He was paid in fiat for a lot of his work, but is forfeiting the last month’s payment in exchange for an allocation of ROBOT + a genesis member jacket that was refunded to a former member of the DAO (davidhq).\n- 500 ROBOT to the KONG cash team 1 for working with us to develop the secure chips embedded inside our Genesis products. They open sourced their iOS / Android app for us to rebrand / use. KONG was not paid by MF outside of the cost of hardware chips that we purchased from them. They are developing new form factors and updated versions of their chips, and will be an important part of our digiphysical future.\n- 250 ROBOT for each of the following:\n    - @Coopahtroopa for his contributions in refining our token economics\n    - James Waugh for his contributions in refining our sales mechanics + token economics and being one of the earliest people to get MF off the ground\n    - Ven Gist for his early contributions in refining our sales mechanics and being one of the earliest people helping to get MF off the ground\n    - Q for being one of the earliest contributors and helping develop the early branding + sales mechanics + auction mechanisms used in the Genesis sale.\n    - @jin for being our ambassador to the metaverse and modelling the MF Bomber as a VRM wearable for use in virtual worlds.\n    - @Sinkas for being our in-house voxel artist and creating the MF Bomber wearable and production line in CryptoVoxels\n    - BlockRocket team for writing our auction contracts + assisting with dapp development for both the WSC Season 1 sale and MF Genesis Auction.
