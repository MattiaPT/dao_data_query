We're building this through the use of Chainlink Keepers technology for automatic claims payouts, the first secondary market of its kind in which users can trade their risk exposure, gamified staking mechanisms, and a dynamic rewards system in which users can earn a yield through fees, premium payouts, liquidity mining and more.  In tandem with the protocol, we are creating the Risk Analysis Database (RAD), the most comprehensive aggregation of DeFi exploit and hack data points to date.\n\nSteady State is pre-launch Insurance Protocol development stage at the moment. We are beginning to raise funds this month and have been meeting with a number of strategic partners and investors that align with our long-term vision for the project.\n\nWe are backed and incubated by YIELD App with Tim Frost being a strategic partner in Steady State. We have also formed partnerships with EQIFI and who will be helping us develop the protocol and will be one of our first clients along with YIELD App. AuBit and Graham Doggart (CEO) are also key supporters and they will be assisting in building out the financial engineering models for our products. Chainlink Labs have also given us a community grant and David Post is actively involved. \n\nWe are currently in deep development phase working towards Testnet/Demo state, building alongside YIELD App, EQIFI, Chainlink Labs, AuBit, and a number of other partners. Looking to have a MVP product launch in Jan 2022, with full v1 out by March. IDO is tentatively scheduled for early Dec 2021.\"\n\n---- Tokenomics ----\nTeam lock is for 6 months and all Team tokens are vested over 30 months.\n\nThe FDV of comparative insurance protocols is much higher - Nexus Mutual FDV is $1.2 billion, Tidal Finance FDV is $207 million, InsurAce is $151 million. \n\n---- Sale details ----\n$0.05 for PreSeed at $20m FDV for $1m\n$0.07 for Seed at $28m FDV for $3m\n\nTotal raise is $4m\n\nPreSeed - total $1m - token price is $0.05 at $20m Fully Diluted Value\nStrategic - total $3m - token price is $0.07 at $28m Fully Diluted Value\n\nWorking with Chainlink Labs and Shima Capital to fill out the cap table\n\nHARVEST will be entered into the SEED round\n\nMVP product launch in Jan 2022* By March with testnet of product and further. Token launch will come post product laucnh to bolster our community.\n\n--- For Seed Round ---\nCurrent investors in preseed Rarestone capital, Yield.App, Equifi, Aubit,  Multiple angel investors with backgrounds ranging from Sequioa to more Defi Oriented backgrounds. All projects brought on board with Steady State will be looking at an advising product build to make sure it meets there needs as potential cleints. With Harvest.Finance coming on Board, SST will have over $1 Billion client valuation pre product with much more coming soon that will brought on board from investors in the seed round. Seed round is being organized by David Post (Chainlink labs) and Yida Gao, Who will be organizing many of their partners and LP's into the round. We also want to get early interested protocols as well in, Shima is excited to bring  Harvest.finance (and others alongside the round) to show proof of the ecosystem being built by Steady State.\n\nCompare to other insurance protocols: https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/insurance \n",

      "content": "After seeing the success of stock buybacks in the traditional equity markets, as well as a variety of token burns in projects such as FTT, BNB, XLM, CRO, (soon ETH), etc. it may make sense for Harvest to follow suit. \n\nBurning tokens may create an increased incentive to hold onto FARM received from farming as well as the dividends from the profit share.\n\n\"In many cases, burning tokens can help stabilize a coin’s value and curb potential price inflation. The stability gives investors a greater incentive to hold the coins and keeps prices at more favorable rates, which therefore keeps network uptime and bandwidth healthy. Token burns also project a sense of confidence and reliability, especially at early stages of a coin’s development.\"\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/explained/token-burning-explained\n\n\"In the public market, a buyback will always increase the stock’s value to the benefit of shareholders. However, investors should ask whether a company is merely using buybacks to prop up ratios, provide short-term relief to an ailing stock price, or to get out from under excessive dilution.\"\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/02/041702.asp#:~:text=In%20the%20public%20market%2C%20a,out%20from%20under%20excessive%20dilution.\n\nMy proposal would be to take a portion of the buybacks from the profit share and use it to burn FARM on a weekly or monthly basis, (to reduce gas costs) turning FARM into a deflationary token in the long term.\n\nOption 1:\nTake 10% of the profit share buybacks (3% of total revenue) and burn it periodically.\n\nOption 2:\nTake 20% of the profit share buybacks (6% of total revenue) and burn it periodically.\n\nOption 3:\nDo not implement a burn.\n\nIn conclusion:\nWhether a share buyback is good or bad from an individual investor's perspective is not a straightforward question. Variables like the share price at the time of purchase, whether more attractive investment options exist, and whether an investor prefers dividends all factor into the ultimate answer.",

Users will deposit FARM, and receive receipts for it. Those have the form of an ERC20 token called iFARM. The vault itself will have a strategy which will perform doHardWork and stake their FARM into the existing autostaking pool. All profit sharing incentives work exactly the same as currently. \n\nThe gas fee of the new vault is about half of the existing autostaking FARM pool. People can decide to use the current one or the new one. There is no need for users to migrate at all.\n\nCompounding in the new FARM vault existing alongside the current pool will be done by Harvest's doHardWork.\n\nBenefits:\n\n1. iFARM will be created, and the PS pool gets a substantial technical upgrade, so that it can be maintained easier in the future\n2. iFARM will enable staked FARM to be used as collateral on lending services without hitting the max portion of the interest rate curves due to high FARM staking rates\n3. iFARM will be a transferable asset. It can be passed from one address to another without the necessity of withdrawing FARM from the vault.\n4. iFARM opens the way to more innovation down the line\n\nTDLR:\nGas savings, no migration needed, autostaking FARM pool and the new pool exist alongside eachother, technical functionality is added enabling more innovation\n\n🍓Yes, deploy iFARM\n🍒 No, don't deploy iFARM\n\nPolls are open until Feb 12, 11pm UTC ~48 hours from now, giving ample time for everyone to vote.",

Only a necessary amount will be used for uniswap liquidity, the rest will go to buybacks.\n\nOne benchmark would be that we spend 0.7% of emissions on WETH and USDC, so this is something the protocol can sustain. And overall this makes sure there are less numbers to vote on, while preserving the core concept, which is buying GRAIN with FARM in Uniswap on a continuous basis. GRAIN buyback from emissions is used in order to simplify the smart contracts and simplify the calculation of FARM P/E ratio. For calculation-purposes, half a point of emissions is roughly equal in value to around a point of profit share, in dollar terms.\n\nThe main tradeoff to consider for FARM holders is the amount of relative emissions that can be sustained to buyback GRAIN and support its liquidity, below are some data points for how much emissions can support how much AUM.\n\nAs reference points: \nTBTC is 1.4% of total emissions and supports an AUM of 24.14M\nWETH is 0.7% of total emissions and supports an AUM of 31.69M, and \nUSDC is 0.7%of total emissions and supports an AUM of 9.85M\n\nPolls are open until Dec 4, 2:30am UTC ~48 hours from now, giving ample time for everyone to vote.",

      "content": "👨‍🌾 Calling all farmers, the tractor is up and running, work is going well on the claims portal, and currently we have a topic governance to vote on\n\n 🌴🌾 👨‍🌾 👩‍🌾 🌺 🌴\n\nPolls have passed in favor of creating a tradable IOU token, called 🌾 GRAIN for reparations for the 13.5% drawdown in stablecoins, with its own Uniswap market. The question is, what's the pair that 🌾 GRAIN will be traded against and incentivized by FARM emissions?\n\nThere are two options: 🥕 GRAIN/FARM and 🥭 GRAIN/USDC\n\nOption 🥕\nIncentivizing GRAIN/FARM would be beneficial because it would create a FARM supply sink, while at the same time giving GRAIN holders who also own FARM the ability to get more FARM emissions by staking in Uniswap. The main drawback of using FARM as the pair is that when GRAIN holders trade out, they'll first convert to FARM before their target asset. One potential benefit of this is some of the GRAIN holders may choose to stake their FARM in profit sharing to keep earning APYs\n\nOption 🥭\nIncentivizing GRAIN/USDC would be beneficial because it's a more direct path to a stablecoin for GRAIN holders, giving direct conversion to USDC. Unlike the GRAIN/FARM option, this wouldn't create an extra supply sink for FARM. So, the emissions used to incentivize GRAIN/USDC would serve less of a beneficial purpose for FARM holders.\n\n💴  In both cases, this gives a market value to GRAIN, by using some emissions to incentivize a liquid market. After much discussion with knowledgeable horticulturalists, creating a liquid market is the preferred option, because it allows GRAIN holders to trade with buyers that are interested in the APY of GRAIN farming, instead of only having the option to hold for many months or years.\n\n🥕 Note 🥭 A supplemental consideration for both options is the currency used to do buybacks into uniswap. In 🥕doHardWork would be routed to direct some FARM from buybacks to buy GRAIN. In the 🥭 case, doHardWork would be routed to sell some FARM to USDC first, which would then be used to buy GRAIN. Routing FARM is likely a bit more efficient, because it's already buying 30% of FARM with each harvest, and wouldn't need to split off a piece to buy USDC instead.\n\n🚜 Polls are open until Nov 8, 8pm UTC ~48 hours from now.",

      "content": "👨‍🌾 Calling all farmers, Harvest is in an era of prosperity, with peace and harmony for farmers.\n\n🐮 🐷 🌾 👨‍🌾 👩🏻‍🌾 🌺 🌴 🎑 \n\nThe chad agriculturalists of governance have put together a poll to provide 50k USD in grants to the ETH ecosystem. Harvest integrates with, and is built on top of ecosystem infrastructure that have come before us. There's value in supporting this so that projects that have positive ecosystem impact can continue to strive. A lot of the work that is somewhat crucial to the Ethereum ecosystem is not actually that well-paid.\n\n📸 This snapshot poll will help to allocate the grants. To even the playing field, gitcoin links have been removed, since about 40% of the nominees do not have gitcoin pages. For each grant that passes the voting threshold, our mods will contact the recipient and ask how they'd like to receive it, whether directly, or through gitcoin. \n\n🙋🏼‍♀️ Like usual, the snapshot vote is binding. Each recipient with more than 1% of the farm supply voted will receive a grant. Based on prior votes, that will make sure between 7-15 projects are funded. Since there are so many recipients, we will fully utilize the discord emoji poll as well. If the sentiment is evenly split, or really spread out, the discord poll will provide more detailed sentiment for grant-giving and help to split ties.\n\n🎨 One note: if your project is not on the list, that means there wasn't a governance nomination with a member to second that nomination for you. That's okay. If this grant process is smooth, we will do more in the future, and you will have a chance at that time. Likewise, not all the nominees could get a grant, and there's no way to know how the vote will go, and the vote is not in any way a reflection of your impact in the ecosystem. FARM holders will vote based on their individual preferences, so for the nominees, we appreciate your understanding in advance.\n\n✨ To summarize: \nMore than 1% of supply voted, get grant\nMore votes, higher grant\nLess votes, lower grant\nSnapshot: binding\nDiscord: get sentiment, split ties\n\nVotes are live. Polls are open until 3am UTC - 24 hours from now.",

      "content": "👩🏻‍🌾 Calling all farmers, we have a topic for a poll. It is about APRs and APYs displayed on the website.\n\nWe are about to get a little educational on the finer points of chad agriculture\n\nFor context:\nAPR is a linear / flat annual rate\nAPY is a rate that is compounded to some degree\n\n🌈 At the moment, the profit sharing pool does auto-compounding for you, and shows the APY because that is what you get. Other FARM reward pools like FARM-USDC LP don't do the auto-compounding for you (for now). Most people will check on their farm a few times a week, and compound it manually, which raises the true return from an APR closer to a weekly compounded APY.\n\n↔️ The FARM Profit Sharing pool is right next to the FARM-USDC Uniswap pool. People compare rates between the pools to decide what to do, which affects the distribution of assets between the pools.\n\n📈 Normally, when you go to a bank, the APR and APY are almost the same, because the rates are so low. However in DeFi, when the rates are high, the APR and APY can be very different. This is the case with the Uniswap pool. 250% APR equates to roughly 1,057% APY.\n\n🍉 APY is a bit more longterm, because it is achieved through compounding over a period of time, APR is a bit more short term, but easier to calculate.\n\n🎑 Therefore, although most people use APR and APY interchangeably in their normal lives, this trivial thing can have a material economic impact on the pool distribution between Profit Sharing and Uniswap.\n\n🙋🏼‍♀️ This is an important poll because there is a social contract with displaying these numbers. People want numbers that feel right, and checks out based on their mental model. This vote helps to establish what the social contract is.\n\nOption 🍓\nMake everything an APY, for manual farming use weekly compounding APY\n\nOption 🍍\nMake only the Profit Sharing an APY, and everything else an APR",

      "content": "👨‍🌾Calling all farmers, now that we have a lot more learnings on the finer points of chad agriculture from the last 4 weeks, it is time to consider whether the original 5M farmland supply plan still makes sense.\n\n🌈 After long hours of fruitful discussion on the cultivation of our fertile hectares, our farmers, lumberjacks, craftsmen, and farmhands have come out with two representative poll options to greatly increase the scarcity of farmland, and cut between 80-86% of future emissions, starting from Tuesday Sep 29th, at 7pm UTC.\n\n📈  While homesteaders stake out their claim in harvest's great expansion, the arable land is a limited resource that has access to the cashflows of harvest, this poll determines the guideline path for arable farmland going forward.\n\n🎑 Harvest works on emissions, slightly more emissions might give harvest future leeway to take advantage of opportunities, slightly less emissions might decrease some options, but increase the scarcity of farmland. The price of FARM has a lot of impact on how much emissions are required for Harvest to achieve its goals of becoming the go-to place for everyone to park their assets and become the largest globally accessible autonomous hedge fund.\n\nBoth plans are available here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11A0NPrm3rDtA11WqQGXKQ9bFlFSa6Zbb0Fng5jpM5L0/edit?usp=sharing\n\nOption 🍓\nMove to the 1M total supply plan\n\nOption 🍒\nMove to the 690,420 total supply plan",

The protocol uses Uniswap for FARM buybacks because the slippage is much less. 🍏 farmers believe that it's in the protocol's interest to move the emissions to incentivize AUM, and generate more profit sharing for FARM.\n\nOption 🍊: We want to diversify our sources of liquidity, and balancer is the second largest exchange, which allows for flexible splits. Not all farmers can take IL on a 50/50 pool, and some people prefer the 80/20 because it is less risk. 🍊 farmers believe that it's in the protocol's interest to keep it, as a way to distribute FARM to this type of liquidity provider.
