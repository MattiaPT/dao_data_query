      "title": "XIP 23: Expansion Punks Ownership and  Growth Proposal (New Horizons)",
      "content": "## Author:\nTheMajor.eth\n\n## Description:\nThis proposal posits that xPunks shift towards a gaming-centric future, led by new captain Keith Breseé (TheMajor.eth), while staying true to its community-first values. This move not only introduces fresh leadership but also a revamped marketing approach aimed at strengthening our NFT presence. As TheMajor takes the helm, he's committed to maintaining the community's financial security through measures like the multi-signature wallet, ensuring xPunks navigates towards an exciting web3 & gaming-oriented horizon.\n\n### Category: Category:\nProcess XIP\n\n### Status:\nNew\n\n## Details:\nFull Proposal exceeds Snapshot's 10K character limit. Please read the detailed breakdown (link below) of the assets included (and excluded) from this proposal. Importantly - the ExpansionPunks DAO Assets (sizeable treasury & Cryptopunk #2321) are EXCLUDED from this proposal - those remain in the community's control.\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1218290129651765258/1222225970602315957/Expansion_Punks_Ownership_and_Growth_Proposal_V2.0.pdf?ex=661571a3&is=6602fca3&hm=936f1ef0454fc62924a1014cb9738fad111a398ef9bddcf3d0f1a988b2f7b58f&\n![image](ipfs://bafkreihx3ujoahfpr45bkbk7cheagvnvu4imcq27ng54ml4lhcv7gni25e)\n\n## Motivation:\nxPunks is at a critical juncture, necessitating innovation to remain relevant in the rapidly evolving NFT landscape. This proposal aims to introduce gaming into the xPunks ecosystem, fostering community engagement through competitions & clans, alongside exploring merchandising avenues for immediate revenue generation. This strategic pivot is driven by a vision to expand xPunks' appeal & functionality, aligning with the broader web3 ethos of creativity & inclusion. Central to this vision is a deep appreciation for the pixel art that defines our community's aesthetic — an homage to the digital craftsmanship that connects us to the essence of (retro) gaming culture. While transitioning away from a strict DEI focus, we aim to maintain an environment that is welcoming & inclusive for all members.\n\n### Background:\nA little bit about me (Keith Breseé aka TheMajor.eth): I've been in digital marketing in the form of SEO & content marketing for over 12 years now. In that time, I have lead clients like Manscaped, Dave Ramsey, Dr Axe (Ancient Nutrition Supplements), Remax, ExP Realty, HCA (biggest healthcare company in the USA), Dollar General, Sumo.com (Noah Kagan) & ServPRO. Several of these websites have grown to 3 & 10 million monthly visitors & I've led many many product launches & book launches to massive successes. My superpowers are having a deep understanding of who my customers are & connecting dots from them to our products. This is what I intend on doing for the xPunks.\n\n## Details:\nDetailed breakdown included in full proposal previously linked, including summary, Arcade Gaming Model Enhancement, Marketing Strategy Expansion, & Enhancing Community Value.\n\n## Implementation:\nUpon this proposal's approval, our team will initiate a series of immediate actions to propel xPunks into its next evolutionary phase, emphasizing gaming integration & marketing revitalization. Here's a breakdown of our planned activities & timeline for execution:\n### Immediate Actions:\n ● **Financial Mobilization:** We will commence with the transfer of necessary funds from the DAO treasury to fuel development & marketing efforts pivotal to our project's expansion.\n ● **Merch Store Setup:** Concurrently, establishment of a merchandising store will be initiated, aiming to offer community-branded items that resonate with xPunks ethos.\n ● **Marketing Strategy Execution:** Rollout of our new marketing strategy begins forthwith, designed to broaden our reach & deepen our engagement within the NFT & gaming communities.\n ● **Comprehensive Development Launch:** Development on three cornerstone gaming projects, the NFT marketplace, blockchain advancements, & gaming launcher will start immediately, setting foundation for our gaming-centric future.\n### Strategic Partnerships & Outreach:\n ● Within first 2 months, we will aggressively pursue partnerships & collaborations essential for development & enhancement of our gaming platform, NFT marketplace, & blockchain infrastructure.\n\n## Timeline\nOutlined is an aggressive yet achievable timeline to kickstart the proposed initiatives, spanning initial hiring to the evaluation of implemented strategies.\n### Development Timeline:\n● **Months 1-2:** Outreach to secure initial partnerships & begin technical dev of the gaming platform, NFT marketplace, & blockchain enhancements. Merch store setup & marketing campaigns will also be launched during this phase.\n● **Months 3-6:** Continue & finish dev & refinement of our gaming titles, marketplace, & blockchain features. This period will focus on ensuring that our offerings are not only innovative but also aligned with highest standards of quality & user experience.\n### Ongoing Development & Evaluation:\nBeyond initial 6-month period, we will continuously evaluate theprogress & impact of our initiatives, adjusting our strategies as necessary to align with community feedback, market trends, & technological advancements. Our commitment is to foster a dynamic & inclusive environment that not only entertains but also adds value to our community members' experiences.\n### Ownership Vesting Milestones:\nThe ownership will not be fully vested until the following milestones are completed:\n● Completing the first two games to a playable state.\n● Launching a modest apparel line as a pilot marketing initiative.\n● Hosting community events (spaces and/or game nights) to boost engagement.\n\n## Cost:\nTo facilitate the development & expansion of our ecosystem, we've outlined the necessary expenses, converted into ETH for clarity & alignment with DAO Treasury processes. Our approach ensures costs are not only transparent but tied to specific milestones & timelines, allowing for a structured deployment of funds.\n*Note: Due to the markets ever changing prices, the following will be listed in USD & the MSW will convert to eth when making the transaction.*\n\n### Cost Breakdown (in ETH):\n● First 3 Games inspired by Galaga, Donkey Kong, Pacman: **Cost: ≈ $14,859**\n● Marketplace Development: **Cost: ≈ $4,680**\n● Blockchain Development: **Cost: ≈ $6,000**\n● Marketing: Website Rebuild: **Cost: ≈ $900**\n● Marketing: Web3 & Gaming Writer (9 articles): **Cost: ≈ $1,500**\n● Marketing: Assistant (for 3 months): **Cost: ≈$7,000**\n● Partnerships & Sponsorships: **Cost: ≈ $19,993**\n**Total Estimated Cost: ≈ $54,932**\n\nThese expenses are being requested from the DAO Treasury, meticulously calculated to ensure transparency & efficiency in fund utilization. The disbursement of funds will be strictly governed by the achievement of predefined milestones, ensuring that each phase of development is completed satisfactorily before proceeding to the next, & will be executed through ETH transactions from the Multi-Signature Wallet (MSW) as per DAO protocols.\n\n### Funding Distribution & Requirements:\nWith a total estimated cost of $54,932 for the project, the allocation is evenly distributed across three milestones. Funding for each milestone must be provided before proceeding to the next to ensure continuous & efficient progress.\nTo ensure quality & completion of milestones Jeremy & Florian (The ExpansionPunks two Co-Founders) will be the ones to approve said milestones, they have agreed to play this role.\nThis balanced funding approach helps the DAO ensure that financial resources are aligned with the project's needs, facilitating effective management & oversight. It underscores the commitment to achieving milestones while optimizing resource utilization for the success of the project.\n\n**Milestone 1: Project Kickoff & Initial Development**\n*Deliverables:*\n● Begin development of first game inspired by Galaga.\n● Start the initial setup for Marketplace & Blockchain Development.\n● Initiate Website Rebuild process.\n● Contract Web3 & Gaming Writer for first set of articles.\n*Associated Costs: ≈ $17,300\nFunding Release: Upon approval of this Proposal*\n\n**Milestone 2: Continued Development & Marketing Efforts**\n*Deliverables:*\n● Complete development of first game & commence second game.\n● Proceed with Marketplace & Blockchain Development.\n● Continue with website improvements.\n● Publish additional articles & hire Marketing Assistant for first month.\n● Start initial Partnerships & Sponsorships engagements.\n*Associated Costs: ≈ $17,300\nFunding Release: Upon completion of Milestone 1 Deliverables*\n\n**Milestone 3: Completion, Launch, & Expansion**\n*Deliverables:*\n● Finalize development of second & third games.\n● Complete Marketplace & Blockchain Development.\n● Publish final set of articles & extend marketing efforts.\n● Marketing Assistant engagement for remaining duration.\n● Further develop & solidify Partnerships & Sponsorships.\n*Associated Costs: ≈ $20,932\nFunding Release: Upon completion of Milestone 2 Deliverables*\n\n## Disclaimers & Final Notes:\nApproval by the xPunks DAO signifies community endorsement for the outlined direction & strategies. It's understood that the DAO retains the right to modify, halt, or redirect support based on evolving circumstances & community consensus. I will be hosting two Q&A spaces on X for anyone that has questions. :) Follow me on X (twitter) to see times: https://x.com/TheMajor_eth\n\n## Conclusion:\nThis proposal presents a clear, actionable plan for evolving xPunks into a gaming-centric ecosystem, underpinned by a robust marketing strategy aimed at fostering growth, engagement, & long-term sustainability. By embracing this new direction, xPunks can secure its legacy & thrive within the dynamic NFT landscape.",

      "title": " Infrastructure: IPFS",
      "content": "\n## Description\nWe are currently using Pinata as an IPFS pinning service, as well as for resolution. \nRecently something starts hammering Pinata with requests, which brings us over the monthly rate, which in turn disables the resolution towards end of each month. We are seeing around 150000 request per month, which is over the 100000 allowed.\n\nThe two options I see are:\n1) Switching to a higher plan at 100$/month, which would give us 1000000 requests per month and should provide a decent buffer.\n2) Switch to a free pinning and resolution service, which would come at no cost, but also at way lower resolution speed.\n\n### Category: | Treasury | Process \n### Status: New \n\n## Motivation\nThe current state regularly breaks our website and might lead to problem with other indexers, if they are not keeping cached versions of the nft data.\n\n### Key Terms / Background (optional)\nPinata, our current pinning / resolution service: https://www.pinata.cloud/\nNFTStorage, free pinning service: https://nft.storage/\nGateway services: https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipfs-gateway/\nPinning: The process of uploading a file to IPFS and having IPFS nodes store it on the network. https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/persistence/\nResolving: Reverse process of pinning, where we ask the network to find a file for us.\n\n\n## Details\nBoth approached come with their own set of pros and cons and route to implementation.\n1) Switching to a higher plan at 100$/month, which would give us 1000000 requests per month and should provide a decent buffer.\n    - Pros: \n        - We have a buffer \n        - We can keep using Pinatas fast resolution\n    - Cons:\n        - We are spending 100$/month on IPFS\n2) Implementing a free service\n    - Pros:\n        - We are not spending 100$/month on IPFS\n    - Cons:\n        - Requires some programming to make sure we keep the data intact. Bit of background: The ExpansionPunks nft consists of two files, the metadata and the image. The image is linked within the metadata using the Pinata gateway. Switching to a free gateway would require rewriting the metadata to point to the new gateway as well and reuploading both bucket of files. To make sure there are no discrepancies and errors introduced I would strongly favor having a data-pipeline that does that (contrary to a simple find/replace) and also does data-integrity checking.\n\n\n## Implementation\n1) DAO could buy the higher plan\n2) My estimate for the implementation of the data pipeline, validation, upload of the data and switching the contract would be around 2-3 days of work. I would be pretty comfortable to commit getting it done withing two weeks.\n\n## Timeline\n1) As soon as proposal passes\n2) 2 weeks, starting from the passing of the proposal\n\n## Cost\n1) 1200$ / year\n2) 0.7Eth (15hours * 60$/hour => 900$ at 1280$/Eth) once",

      "title": "Protocol and structure for future DAO payments",
      "content": "## Author\nfloar.eth#4492\n\n## Description\nThis proposal aims to set up a structure and protocols to use for future payments made from the DAO. It classifies three different situations and proposes a payment structure and protocol for each. \nThis should help the DAO making those decisions faster in the future, as well as implementing a certain protection around the treasury, given the anonymous nature of this space.\n\n### Category: Treasury\n### Status: New\n\n\n## Motivation\nCurrently payments from the DAO to collaborator's, paid members of the community and one time payments are decided on the fly. This proposal aims to unify it and provide a framework to execute on.\n\n### Key Terms / Background (optional)\nSablier: Real time payment protocol, see here for an in-depth description: https://discord.com/channels/864147158777462854/961505506202095636/1012441319194501193\n\n## Details\nThis proposal differentiates between three types of payments:\n1) Continuous payments, mostly tied to a time commitment. Examples are our monthly payments for CMO and mods, preparation for a workshop, holding weekly twitter spaces and so forth.\n2) One time payments, tied to deliverables and one-off actions. Examples are: Donations, purchase of tokens, fees for speakers etc.  \n3) Royalty based payments\n\nThe proposal is to use *Sablier* for all payments of category 1). With one time payments for a time based engagement we are in the pickle of timing it. Provide it at the end of the engagement is good for the DAO (Making sure the DAO actually received the deliverable) but bad for the receiver (Needs to go into concession). Paying at the beginning of the engagement reverts this problem, giving all the benefit to the receiver (as blockchain payments are final) and all the downsides to the DAO.\nSablier solves this problem by providing a continuous payment stream, starting from the beginning of the engagement. The receiver has the benefit of receiving value straight away and getting an exact idea of when funds will be available, the DAO enjoys the extra protection that a stream could be canceled, in case the situation demands for it.\nFor type 2) payments this proposal indicates that payment should be received on delivery, with an option to convert a small part into a streaming payment, in case prior work is needed / this makes sense. (Example, someone makes a proposal for a workshop for 1Eth, that gets accepted. They will be able to receive 25% (?) streamed beforehand for preparing the workshop, the rest will be received when the workshop is held.)\n\nWe only have a single type 3 payment, which is the %-share of royalties paid to the CMO. The proposal would be to implement a smart contract splitter, that would receive the royalties as an escrow and split them between receiving parties. If we feel like this makes sense there will most likely be a follow up for implementation of this.\n\n\n## Implementation\nIf passed future payments are to be aligned with this framework. Rules and guidance will be put into #✨│dao-overview \n\n## Timeline\n\n\n## Cost\nNone (excluding development and deployment of the splitter contract for now)",

      "content": "## Description\nThis is a proposal to approve a budget of 10ETH to be used across a 3 month period to build out and compensate a dedicated marketing team. Specific part time roles could include: Partnerships / Collaboration Manager, Social Media Manager, Graphic Designer and Spaces Host. \n\n### Category: Brand\n\n## Motivation\nAllocating specific marketing budget will allow for agility & scalability of the CMO's marketing efforts. By hiring specialists in these positions, we can provide value to the community through strategic partnerships & collaborations, increase our presence and awareness on Twitter and align all marketing collateral with the xPunks brand. This will help considerably with short term wins by providing value for the community and increase project awareness and community engagement. These additional team members will also free up CMO time to prioritise long term DAO strategy, operations and initiatives.\n\n### Key Terms / Background (optional)\nn/a\n\n## Details\nThe budget will be available for the CMO to allocate throughout the 3 month period. The CMO will be responsible for all hiring, onboarding & management of additional team members. Specific roles are indicative and could change based on priorities of the community.\n\n## Implementation\nThe marketing budget would be issued immediately to the CMO upon success of the snapshot vote. The marketing budget will be sent to a new Wallet Address for ease of bookkeeping. All marketing spends would be outlined in the existing Marketing Spend spreadsheet and the Marketing guild would be informed of proposed marketing budget allocation. Following the 3 month period there will be a quarterly review where the CMO will report on marketing activities and outcomes with the wider DAO, and an option to extend the budget and roles a further 3 months. \n\n## Timeline\nThe proposed marketing budget of 10ETH is to be allocated for use across the 3 month period. \n\n## Cost\n10 ETH",

Weekly progress notes from June 1 to July 30 can be found in the #pr-committee in the xPunks Discord.\n\nThe committee narrowed the search to eight (8) PR Agencies, and we were able to reach out to (4) with two responses; one from WE Communications (no availability) and the other from Coinbound (available). For a list of the agencies, please refer to the meeting notes in the #pr-committee channel.\n\n## Implementation\n\nWe are proposing two options for the xPunks community; \n(1) For (Move Forward) = hire Coinbound for three months with the agreed-upon deliverables sent to our committee and CMO. This would become a key focus for CMO, managing relationship with agency, briefing and strategy.\n\n(2)  Against (Postpone) = focus efforts on grassroots / community led PR efforts. \n\n## Timeline\nFor (Move Forward) = Within a week of passing, CMO will reach out to Coinbound.io and negotiate terms as the agency of record for the ExpansionPunks for a three (3) month trial period. A vote for Move Forward would end XIP 7 and trigger a future XIP vote for approval of payment structures to Coinbound for three (3) months. \n\nAgainst (Postpone) = delay hiring a trial PR agency of record. A vote for Postpone would effectively end XIP 7 and trigger no further action from the xPunks community. \n\n## Cost\nFor (Move Forward) = $5k–$10k per month (based on current ETH USD value) to Coinbound via a new XIP\n\nAgainst (Postpone) = No cost associated",

      "content": "## Description\nHire a compensated Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) role to drive the collection forward in the best interest of the community.\n\n### Category: Treasury\n\n### Status: New\n\n## Motivation\nUnlike other PFP NFT collections, ExpansionPunks is a fully-decentralized project – meaning there are no inherent “core team” members running the show. From the very beginning, this collection and community was designed to be community-led. All secondary royalties (5%) fund the ExpansionDAO Treasury wallet (200+ ETH in funds); the Founders do not receive any royalties. The community decides how that Treasury is spent (via DAO governance). This proposal is about using that Treasury to establish a sustainable role for ongoing community leadership.\n\n### Key Terms / Background (optional)\nSuperfluid: https://www.superfluid.finance/home\n\n## Details\nDetailed Job Description (PDF): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IE1i9mZAjrnOT6ZhyJbv5v3NEH5t9rJU/view?usp=sharing\n\n## Implementation\n1. Founders & Co-Mktg Leads to post the role in various forums, while also leveraging organic community connections to source potential candidates\n2. Founders to publish an application form to collect applicants\n3. Recieve applications via form\n4. Founders & Co-Mktg Leads to conduct interviews with potential candidates\n5. Founders & Co-Mktg Leads to select final candidate\n6. Final candidate presented to community for approval via DAO Governance (Snapshot vote)\n7. If candidate is community-approved > DAO Ops/MSW to configure Superfluid compensation (2 eth/mo) and establish 2% secondary royalty compensation process\n8. CMO to begin in role\n\n## Timeline\nApplication period (#3 in Implmenetation above) will be open as hiring for a role of this significance should not be forced to a timeline - we need the right candidate. This propsal expires if a CMO candidate has not been identified by end of calendar year 2022 (or if a subsequent XIP nullifies this one). Once hired, the CMO begins a 2-month duration guarantee for on-boarding. This is an important time for the CMO to establish operational processes and baselines for ongoing performance measurement. After this 2-month guarantee, the role is subject to the will of the community – i.e. community members can propose changes (including role termination) via DAO governance (snapshot proposals & community votes). Thus, it’s important the CMO establish clear communication and proof of impact (KPIs) to sustain the community’s favor.\n\n## Cost\nTo acknowledging the significance of this role, compensation is a mix of “fixed” and “variable” amounts to create incentive alignment through performance-focused compensation.\n\nFixed: 2 ETH/MO, distributed via Superfluid, an on-chain money streaming protocol that allows for automated, recurring, programmable cashflows\nPLUS\nVariable: 2% of all secondary gross sales on marketplaces that honor royalties (e.g. Opensea, LooksRare, etc.) during tenure in role, distributed monthly (excludes royalties from purchases by our own DAO funds, i.e. “floor sweeps”). This 2% of gross sales represents 40% of the royalties received by the DAO (5% collection royalty) – and serves to align the CMO’s incentives with those of the community. As the collection performs (e.g. greater sales volume, rising floor price), the CMO is compensated in kind.",

Here are three statements that I believe support this proposal\n1. Our origin story, purpose and mission are web0, web1, and web2 inspired, developed in a web2.5 world, with web3 technology.\n2. Our target market is not on NFT Twitter. We learned the hard way during the most difficult period of the 2021-22 surge. People were rug pulled, over leveraging, and had unrealistic expectations.\n3. Our growth market are the professionals and executives that are still resistance to what web3 can become.\n\n### Key Terms\nweb0 - pre Internet\nweb1 - Internet (Read only)\nweb2 - Social Media (Read & Write)\nweb2.5 - Discord, NFT Twitter, Opensea\nweb3 - blockchain, crypto, NFTs, DAOs\ndegen - loves NFTs, idk\n\n## Details\nThe committee will be made up of three community members:\nPosition 1: Industry Professional - experienced in PR, understands PR pricing models, structures, and the industry\nPosition 2: Industry Advisor - support executive engagements, facilitate professional opportunities\nPosition 3: Secretary - Note keeping, calendar planning, report backs to community\n\n## Implementation\nI (@vickwowo.eth#0330) will fill role 2 or 3, and I'll work with community to post the descriptions for the other two roles to be available for applications for a period of 14 days. All applications will be made available to MSW for audit purposes. Applications will be reviewed and selected by me (@vickwowo.eth#0330) to complete the 3-person PR Search Committee team. This committee will then execute a search for viable PR Agencies. At the end of duration, Committee will present 3 Agency candidates back to Community, with the final selection to be voted upon by the xPunks community (as a snapshot proposal).\n\nShould this proposal be approved, I (@vickwowo.eth#0330) will recuse myself from any approvals related to this proposal in the MSW.\n\n## Timeline\nThis proposal is for \"up to\" 2 months\n\n## Cost\nTotal: up to 3 ETH (over 2 months) - i.e. 0.5 ETH per month to each of 3 committee members.",

      "content": "\n## Description\nThe DAO will purchased 3 ETH worth of Expansion Punks from the Open Sea floor. 1 ETH a day on a given weekday or weekend for a three week period (as an example, three Saturdays in a row) for xPunks priced at or below 0.12 ETH. The xPunks purchased will be staked in the single stake vault at NFTX to generate yield.\n\n## Category: Treasury\n## Status: New\n\n## Motivation\nFor at least a one month period the only proposals submited in DAO Discussion that got serious discussion were focused on buying back xpunks. To honor that discussion and the time committment of the community and to provide a good test for DAO voting process, I believe this idea should be placed to a vote. I also believe the staking rewards from NFTX provide a means of sustainability to the project and/or provide the potential for outreach to underserved communities. I don't want to cloud this proposal with additional execution elements, but in the future the staking rewards from NFTX (XPUNK token) could be used to provide scholarships (gifting of xPunks) if that is voted on.\n\n*Personal Bias: \nI hold a large number of xpunks (100+), but I don't intend to sell any of them into these buybacks.\nI hold a majority of the current NFTX XPUNK staking pools. This proposal will decrease my yield and provides no obvious benefit to me as the vault provides no fees to existing holders when someone does single staking as proposed. It could increase awareness and use of the valuts which is only personal benefit I can see.*\n\n## Key Terms / Background (optional)\nNFTX vault: https://nftx.io/vault/0x1a84cb84603d045efc7c09c03c4a179145094927/info/\nDiscussion of our NFTX valut on Twitter Spaces: https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1MYxNnAjVEOxw?s=20\nOpen Sea Expansion Punk listings: https://opensea.io/collection/expansionpunks\nFloor: Lowest costs xPunks available\n\n## Details\nThis is all being done onchain which our existing leadership has shown a preference for. It could be done with our MSW wallet or an alternative MSW wallet for security purposes. There are no ongoing personel or maintence costs.\n\n## Timeline\nIf passed, the 1 ETH purchase would be made every seventh day (Example, three Saturdays). The staking could be done on the day of the last purchase.\n\n## Cost\n3.5 ETH. 3 ETH plus pressumed gas costs",

      "content": "## Author\nfloar.eth#4492\n\n## Description\nThis proposal gathers community sentiment on the proposed lauch mission statement, as well as a corresponding allocation of the treasury funds.\n\n### Category: Informational\n\n### Status: New \n\n## Motivation\nSince the inception of this project we have seen more and more large players enter the playing field and while this is great for crypto adoption I think we have a very unique position right now where we can shape boundaries, guard-rails and opportunities for this space going forward. Web3 is extremely young and suffers from bad user experience, tremendous need for technical understanding (on an individual level) and is abound with scams and grifters. The reality is that privileged individuals are better equipped to navigate this space and therefore it is way easier for them to position themselves in a favorable spot going forward. With the ExpansionDAO we are creating an entity that is well equipped to make an impact, while at the same time capturing more individual perspectives and voices. I think if deployed correctly it can be a decent force to at least level the playing field of web3.\n\n### Key Terms / Background (optional)\n\n## Details\nWe believe that a clear mission statement will help aligning the activity and direction of the ExpansionDAO and propose the following statement as an initial mission statement:\n\n*The ExpansionDAO will endeavor through service, charity and community to give 10K underrepresented humans a platform and a voice in the emerging web3 space.*\n\nTo accompany this statement we propose to strategically allocate the current treasury funds in the following way:\nCurrently we have 158 $Eth + 141000k $USDC in the treasury, with the USDC being de-risked and allocated to fulfill tax implication of the entity. \nThis proposal allocated ~2/3 of the remaining treasury towards the mission of ExpansionDAO (as stated above), intended to be used for spends that push boundaries and actively work towards diversity and inclusion of the web3 space. Those spends are not limited to any particular kind of proposals, as long as they pay into the overall mission. The remaining ~1/3 of the treasury would be allocated for expenses, maintenance costs and other proposals, that the community deems worthwhile, but that are not directly adding to the ExpansionDAOs mission.\n\n## Timeline\nWith the passing of this proposal the mission statement and treasury allocation will be used as one metric to evaluate the value and merit of proposals. \n\n## Cost\n-",

      "content": "## Author\nposvar.eth#8108 (a)\nPop Punk#2529 (b)\n\n## Category: Treasury\n## Status: New\n\n## Description:\nThe collection Roadmap indicates two substantial charitable donations (chosen by community) totaling 55 ETH:  25 ETH 50% mint milestone and 30 ETH 100% mint milestone. This proposal suggests breaking the 55 ETH into smaller charitable donations, still totaling 55 ETH.\n\n## Motivation A:\nBreaking the 55 ETH into 11 different charitable donations of 5 ETH each, still totaling 55 ETH, and spanning the next ~11 months (1 donation per month).\nEleven donation moments (5 ETH each) gives the collection/community more breadth of impact and longevity (~11 months) to work with versus 2 large donation moments.\n\n## Motivation B\nWhereas...\nThe collection roadmap had two large donations of 25 and 30 ETH going to charity.\nIt has been over five months since those milestones were accomplished.\nThose funds now sit with and are the responsibility of the DAO.\nThe community has been told it had an overall DAO treasury of 200+ ETH to work with, then 150+ after potential taxes and now have been told it is less than 100 ETH after these donations.\nThe ability of the DAO to be sustainable is a core element of us being able to give back to non-profits and the community over the coming years and decades.\nCommitting to giving greater than 1/3 of our treasury to two non-profits could be seen as irresponsible to our core mission.\nWe suggest that ...\nWe honor the spirit of the donations in the roadmap, but not place the DAO at risk by concentrating the donations into two donations immediately or even 11 in the first year as another proposal suggests, but rather we commit to doing 11 ETH in donations a year over a five year period with the community proposing the structure and amounts of these donations.\n\n## Details:\nIf approved - the next action will be to leverage community proposals to start identifying ETH donation opportunities/causes for DAO Governance.\n\n## Timeline:\nIf approved - community can commence immediately with charity identification, selection through proposal governance.\n\n## Cost:\nNone - this simply sets a new strategy for the 55 ETH in charitable donations already planned for in the Collection Roadmap.",
