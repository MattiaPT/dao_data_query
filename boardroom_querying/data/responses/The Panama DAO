      "title": "Retroactive Payment to Brandyn Hamilton for Financial Analysis Work",
      "content": "Hello DAO,\n\nMy name is Brandyn Hamilton (brandynham.eth) and I am writing this proposal to seek retroactive compensation for the work I have done for Panama DAO through the development of a Financial Dashboard, Staking Analysis Tool, and an analytical report. These tools provide Panama DAO with essential insights into its financial health, NFT market dynamics, and potential revenue from staking, ensuring informed decision-making and strategic planning.\n\n### I will also commit to 3 months of providing a financial status update for the DAO at DAO townhalls, starting with the June 2024 townhall.\n\n**Project Overview**\n\n- Financial Dashboard: An embeddable, dynamic tool hosted on Flipside, showcasing key financial health metrics such as cash runway and burn rate, real-time treasury and auction metrics, cash flow metrics, NFT market metrics, and more. The dashboard was future-proofed to incorporate secondary market NFT sales (opensea, etc) in key calculations. This dashboard should work indefinitely and can be built upon.\n    - https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/Brandyn/the-panama-dao-financial-dashboard-qFA7VI\n\n- Staking Analysis Tool: A Streamlit app that models potential revenue from staking a portion of Panama DAO's treasury assets, offering insights into enhancing financial performance.\n    - https://panamadao.streamlit.app/\n\n- Comprehensive Analysis Report: A detailed report summarizing findings and recommendations from the staking analysis, including comparative insights on auction revenue versus staking revenue.\n    - https://github.com/BrandynHamilton/panamadao/blob/master/panamadao.pdf\n\nThese contributions are designed to support Panama DAO's financial management and strategic planning.\n\n**Request for Compensation**\n\nConsidering the comprehensive nature of the work, including development, research, and the creation of an analytical report, a total of 20 hours was invested in this project. Given the complexity and the value provided to Panama DAO, as well as the staying power of the dashboard, retroactive compensation of 0.21 ETH (~$800 as of 05/25/2024) is requested. This compensation is reflective of the breadth of work and aligns with freelance development rates in the blockchain sector.\n\n**Justification**\n- The Financial Dashboard and Staking Analysis Tool offer Panama DAO unprecedented clarity on its financial status and future revenue potential.\n\n    - Cash runway metric informs the DAO how many days/months/years it can sustain its operations using only treasury assets.\n\n    - Burn rate metrics analyze monthly spending and compare it to a hypothetical sustainable spending ceiling.\n\n- The Flipside dashboard can be embedded into the Panama DAO website for ease of access.\n\n- The Comprehensive Analysis Report provides actionable insights and strategic recommendations, particularly highlighting the benefits of staking.\n\n- These tools collectively enhance Panama DAO's transparency, member engagement, and strategic decision-making capabilities.\n\n- The monthly financial status updates will help the community understand how to use and interpret the dashboards, and will provide valuable insights into the DAO's financial performance.  \n\n**Impact**\n- The deployment of these resources has positioned Panama DAO for sustained growth and financial health. By offering a holistic view of the DAO’s financial landscape and actionable insights for revenue optimization, these tools serve as a cornerstone for Panama DAO’s operational excellence and strategic planning.\n\n**My contact info and accounts**\n- [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandyn-hamilton/)\n- [Twitter](https://x.com/Bhami628)",

      "title": "Retroactive Payment to Brandyn Hamilton for Financial Analysis Work Done for Panama DAO",
      "content": "Hello DAO,\n\nMy name is Brandyn Hamilton (brandynham.eth) and I am writing this proposal to seek retroactive compensation for the work I have done for Panama DAO through the development of a Financial Dashboard, Staking Analysis Tool, and an analytical report. These tools provide Panama DAO with essential insights into its financial health, NFT market dynamics, and potential revenue from staking, ensuring informed decision-making and strategic planning.\n\n### Project Overview\n\n- Financial Dashboard: An embeddable, dynamic tool hosted on Flipside, showcasing key financial health metrics such as cash runway and burn rate, real-time treasury and auction metrics, cash flow metrics, NFT market metrics, and more.  The dashboard was future-proofed to incorporate secondary market NFT sales (opensea, etc) in key calculations.  This dashboard should work indefinitely and can be built upon.  \n\n    - https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/Brandyn/the-panama-dao-financial-dashboard-qFA7VI\n\n- Staking Analysis Tool: A Streamlit app that models potential revenue from staking a portion of Panama DAO's treasury assets, offering insights into enhancing financial performance.  \n\n    - https://panamadao.streamlit.app/\n\n- Comprehensive Analysis Report: A detailed report summarizing findings and recommendations from the staking analysis, including comparative insights on auction revenue versus staking revenue.\n\n    - https://github.com/BrandynHamilton/panamadao/blob/master/panamadao.pdf\n\nThese contributions are designed to support Panama DAO's financial management and strategic planning.\n\n### Request for Compensation\n\nConsidering the comprehensive nature of the work, including development, research, and the creation of an analytical report, a total of 20 hours was invested in this project. Given the complexity and the value provided to Panama DAO, as well as the staying power of the dashboard, retroactive compensation of 0.42 ETH (~$1,500 as of 03/26/2024) is requested. This compensation is reflective of the breadth of work and aligns with freelance development rates in the blockchain sector.\n\n### Justification\n\n- The Financial Dashboard and Staking Analysis Tool offer Panama DAO unprecedented clarity on its financial status and future revenue potential.\n\n    - Cash runway metric tells the DAO how many days/months/years it can sustain its operations using only treasury assets. \n\n    - Burn rate metrics analyze monthly spending and compare it to a hypothetical sustainable spending ceiling.    \n\n    - The flipside dashboard can be embedded into the Panama DAO website for ease of access. \n \n- The Comprehensive Analysis Report provides actionable insights and strategic recommendations, particularly highlighting the benefits of staking.\n\n- These tools collectively enhance Panama DAO's transparency, member engagement, and strategic decision-making capabilities.\n\n### Impact\nThe deployment of these resources has positioned Panama DAO for sustained growth and financial health. By offering a holistic view of the DAO’s financial landscape and actionable insights for revenue optimization, these tools serve as a cornerstone for Panama DAO’s operational excellence and strategic planning.\n\n### My contact info and accounts\n\n- [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandyn-hamilton/)\n\n- [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/Bhami628)\n \n",

      "title": "Extension of Project Manager Role in Panama DAO",
      "content": "Dear Pitiguays\n\nI hope this message finds you all in good spirits. I am writing to propose the extension of my role as the Project Manager for the Panama DAO for an additional six months.\n\n**Achievements Over the Past 6 Months:**\nIn the last half-year, I am proud to report that we have experienced substantial growth in our community. We've successfully managed and executed five proposals, organized and hosted monthly in-person and virtual meetups featuring engaging tech talks. Our Instagram account has seen remarkable growth, reaching 737 followers from scratch. Simultaneously, we've maintained an active presence on Crypto Twitter and Discord. Additionally, a WhatsApp group has been established, fostering a sense of community with over 30 members. We've successfully developed a distinct brand identity for the DAO.\n\n**Continuity and Consistency:**\nBuilding upon these achievements, continuity and consistency are vital for the sustained success of the Panama DAO. If entrusted with the role for another six months, I commit to:\n- **Community Growth:** Continuously expanding our community through networking, events, community outreach and socials.\n- **Event Organization:** Regularly organizing and hosting in-person meetups and tech talks, along with virtual townhall-style meetings to enhance exposure and confidence in the DAO.\n- **Financial Sustainability:** Actively seeking grants, sponsors, and partnerships to secure funding for the DAO and upcoming projects.\n\n**Budget Consideration:** \nTo ensure the effective continuation of the Project Manager role, I propose the same arrangement of $1500 fee per month for my services. This is why I´m asking for a payment of 3.96 ETH (includes a volatility margin) to cover for the 6 months. \n\n**Future Focus:**\nMy strategic vision for the next term is to secure grants and partnerships that will not only fund our ongoing projects but also contribute to the growth and sustainability of the DAO. Furthermore, I am committed to identifying the next impactful project that will garner attention and publicity, further establishing the Panama DAO as a force for positive change.\n\nI invite you to review the  proposal presentation [https://juicybitnina.my.canva.site/panama-dao-pm-proposal] I humbly request your support for the extension of my term as Project Manager. Together, we can continue building a stronger and more vibrant future for Panama through the Panama DAO.\n\nThank you for your consideration, and I am open to addressing any questions or concerns.\n\nKind regards,\n\nNina Herrera\n@juicybitnina\nProject Manager Panama DAO 🚀\n",

      "title": "Proposal for Gymnasium Floor Repair at Instituto Nacional",
      "content": "Requested Amount: 1.72 ETH (Approximately $2550)\n\nDear Pitiguays,\n\nWe present to you a meaningful proposal that resonates deeply with our commitment to community improvement and collaboration.\n\nPurpose:\nThe requested funds will be dedicated to a comprehensive repair of the gymnasium floor at Instituto Nacional, an initiative sparked by Abdiel, the current president of the graduating class. The project involves meticulous preparation of the floor before painting, ensuring a long-lasting solution for the benefit of the students.\n\nAllocation:\n- $800: Thorough preparation of the gymnasium floor\n- $1500: Purchase of high-quality, durable paint\n- $200: Additional materials necessary for the lasting repair\n\nBackground:\nAbdiel approached, Eduardo from Wash Panama, seeking assistance in cleaning and preparing the gymnasium for their graduation ceremony. Despite commendable cleaning efforts, the gymnasium remains unsuitable for various activities, one of them is having slippery floor. To provide a clearer picture, a video demonstrating the current state is available: https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSNXhrbyK/\n\nCollaboration with Wash Panama:\nEduardo from Wash Panama, an active contributor of our community, has collaborated with Abdiel and volunteers in cleaning up the gymnasium. This project aligns seamlessly with Wash Panama's commitment to community service.\n\nSchool Budget Constraints:\nInstituto Nacional, with its rich history spanning over a century, faces financial constraints, making it challenging to address necessary repairs with their limited yearly budget.\n\nLong-Lasting Impact:\nYour support for this initiative will not only cater to the immediate need for the graduation ceremony but will provide a lasting solution. The preparation of the floor before painting ensures the longevity of the improvement. The repaired gymnasium will benefit not only the 12th and 9th grades for their graduation ceremonies but will also enable students to use the space safely for various sports activities, addressing the current issue of a slippery floor. Instituto Nacional has over 2000 students.\n\nThe proposal is being submitted in Eduardo's name for your consideration and votes. We appreciate your ongoing support and look forward to your positive response.\n\n*Note: The requested amount is based on the current market value of ETH at the time of the proposal. We kindly request a $50 addition to cover potential fluctuations in gas fees. This ensures that the requested funds are sufficient to carry out the proposed floor repair. Thank you for understanding.*\n\nThank you for your dedication to making a positive impact in our community.\n\n\n",

The agreed compensation was $1,000, a sum that rightfully belongs to him for his exceptional work.</p><p>Due to logistical oversight and miscommunication, the payment was not promptly made. Oscar Montilla had not provided his wallet address for receiving the funds, and as a result, the agreed compensation has not been disbursed.</p><p>Resolution Plan:</p><p>The total owed amount of $1,050 will be transferred from the DAO treasury in ETH to the designated wallet provided by me, JuicyBit. I will then be responsible for converting the funds to the local currency (USD) and arranging for a bank transfer or deposit to Oscar Montilla's bank account.</p><p>This plan includes a slight increase of $50 from the originally agreed amount of $1,000 to accommodate potential fluctuations in ETH price and transaction fees during the process.</p><p>Any remainder from the conversion and transfer process will be promptly returned to the DAO treasury.</p><p>This plan is in the best interest of the DAO as it upholds our commitment to honoring our agreements and compensating individuals for their valuable contributions.</p><p>We kindly request your approval for this proposal to proceed with the necessary disbursement.</p><p>Thank you for your attention and support.</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>JuicyBit</p><p>Project Manager</p>",

Our additional contribution entails donating laptops to complement these installations, enhancing education and opportunities.\n\nBackground:\nIn Panama, 94,000 families lack access to electricity, impacting education and daily life, particularly for families with school-aged children.\n\nInitiative:\nSolar panels & batteries for clean energy.\nLaptops to empower education and connectivity.\nDonate 3 laptops to a school of over 200 kids, who only have 6/12 working computers.\nIf this brings enough awareness and funds to the DAO we could make a long term partnership to give 1 computer per family that gets solar panels installed. Thus creating a real world impact for many of the children involved.\n\nImpact:\nIlluminate lives through sustainable energy.\nEmpower children's learning with laptops.\nBridge technology gap for underserved families.\nFacilitate connectivity, fostering informed communities.\nCreate a flywheel for the DAO by bringing more awareness and more donations to further support this type of IRL initiatives.\n\nHere is a link to a video where you can see their work:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tv/CaajFgFATQg/?igshid=MTc4MmM1YmI2Ng==\n\nLet’s light up lives together!",

      "content": "Dear fellow Pitiguays,\n\nWe propose a heartfelt initiative to honor the memory of our beloved community member, Emmanuel Daza, who played an active role in the Panama crypto community. Emmanuel's passion for art, NFTs, and his dedication to teaching children from diverse backgrounds inspired us deeply.\n\nIn remembrance of Emmanuel, we aim to organize a meaningful event –  Taller de Arte \"Pandita\" a painting class for 15 kids. Our vision encompasses the following:\n\n🎨 **Painting Class:**\nPartnering with Emmanuel's mother, Isabel, a talented artist and educator, we aspire to arrange a painting class. This class will welcome children from varied walks of life, including Emmanuel's friends and those from less privileged communities.\n\n🖌️ **Logistics:**\nTo ensure a seamless and engaging experience, the DAO will fund art supplies, parking rental, and provisions for the event. Generously, Boris, a close friend of Emmanuel, has offered Il Giardino as the venue to host the class.\n\nThe budget of 0.22 ETH (approximately $400 USD) will be allocated as follows:\n- **Painting materials (approx. 0.12 ETH):**\n  - Canvas\n  - Palettes\n  - Aprons\n  - Brushes\n  - Watercolors\n\n- **Parking rental (approx. 0.08 ETH)**\n- **Food provisions (approx. 0.02 ETH)**\n  - Hot Dogs\n  - Juices\n\nBy providing an avenue for children to delve into art, we aim to carry forward Emmanuel's enthusiasm for creativity and education. This endeavor aligns with our commitment to fostering community growth, education, and the arts.\n\nWe firmly believe that this initiative encapsulates Emmanuel's legacy and mirrors our dedication to unity, inspiration, and growth. We invite your valuable thoughts and feedback to bring this concept to life and honor Emmanuel's spirit.\n\nLet's work collaboratively to ensure that this first public good shines bright and creates a positive impact in our community.\n\nThank you for your consideration!",

As you know, our NFT collection represents some of the most unique and valuable assets in the Panama DAO, and I believe that it is important for us to recognize and celebrate the individuals who have invested in our project.</p><p>The meet and greet event would provide an opportunity for NFT owners to come together and meet one another, as well as members of the Panama DAO team. The event could take place at a local venue, such as a restaurant or conference center, where attendees could enjoy food and drinks while getting to know one another.</p><p>In addition to being a social gathering, the meet and greet event could also serve as a platform for discussing the future of the Panama DAO and our NFT collection. NFT owners could share their ideas and feedback with the DAO team, and we could provide updates on our plans for the future.</p><p>Overall, I believe that a meet and greet event for our NFT owners would be a valuable and rewarding experience for everyone involved. It would help to strengthen our community and build a sense of camaraderie among our stakeholders.</p><p>Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal</p>",
