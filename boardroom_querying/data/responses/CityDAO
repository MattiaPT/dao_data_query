      "content": "Dear CityDAO Members,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. We have actively participated in a very important voting process over the past week, and it is clear that CIP212 has received overwhelming support from all of us. Immediately after the official results are announced (15.05.2024), the following projects mentioned below should be terminated, and the funds allocated should be returned to the CityDAO treasury and, naturally, to the citizens of CityDAO.\n\nTermination of the 3-Year Sponsorship Agreement for the RTM Project: The RTM project, which includes a three-year sponsorship agreement, should be terminated. (Approximately $10K)\n\nSince the CityDAO hack, we have not been able to find transparent information on the progress of the project from the date we regained control of Discord until now.\n\nRecovery of Funds Allocated to the t0wn Project: The funds allocated to the t0wn project should be recovered. (Approximately $70K)\n\nThe project Discord has been a platform where people greet each other since 04.07.2023. Additionally, the project’s X (Twitter) account posted its first and last tweet on 08.05.2023 and has shown no performance since then.\n\nhttps://discord.com/invite/M2m3qCh3\nhttps://twitter.com/T0WNorg/status/1633250591454396417\n\nTherefore, all “unspent” funds allocated to the projects mentioned above should be returned to the treasury and, as specified in CIP212, returned to CityDAO citizens. Additionally, if these reimbursements are not made, a lawyer will be retained on behalf of CityDAO to pursue the necessary legal processes, and investigations will be promptly initiated.\n\nProject Budget: $20,000: Legal payments will only be made if necessary. All required payments will be shared under this forum.\n\nNOTE : Proposal owner DO NOT ask one single cent of the budget for himself. The budget will ONLY be used for legal processes IF needed. The remaining part of the budget will be returned to the treasury without being touched.\n\nBest regards,\nsbalderson\n\nUpdate : Adjusted the language as “unspent” funds.\nUpdate : Adjusted the language for budget in the NOTE section.",

They will decide on an implementation mechanism and have a budget of $3,000 to develop and audit a smart contract as necessary and pay legal fees for any research needed into dissolution. \n\nThe most likely scenarios are either an airdrop to return the funds or a smart contract that lets Citizens claim their share of funds are options.\n\n### TImeline:\nUpon passage of the CIP, the Return of Funds task force will convene and develop a mechanism to return funds and initiate the process within 30 days.",

      "title": "CIP 208 – Sponsorship for Legal Qualification of DAOs Book",
      "content": "This CIP belongs to privatenf, sent to snapshot by simplepixellife\n\nCIP Author\n\nI’m an academician at a university in Türkiye who met CityDAO about a year ago. I met CityDAO because of my master’s thesis on DAOs. In my thesis, I analyzed the legal qualifications of DAOs. I first received Citizen NFT in CityDAO, where I participated as an observer to see how DAOs work technically and to be involved in this process, and then I started to actively participate in the work in the Turkish community. With this CIP, I would like to spread the name of CityDAO with my thesis on DAOs in Turkish. In fact, this proposal first came to me from @simpelpixellife, another CityDAO citizen.\n\nShort Summary of CIP\n\nThis CIP has been prepared to encourage CityDAO to sponsor my master thesis titled “The Legal Nature of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) on Blockchain Technology”. If this sponsorship offer is accepted, it is thought that CityDAO will spread the name of CityDAO among both Turkish academics and the Turkish blockchain ecosystem as a result of the gift of the book to leading academics and Web3 developers in the field, and thus the participation of people with high intellectual knowledge in our community will be ensured. The requested fee for this purpose is 3.500$ in total.\n\nHow CityDAO will benefit?\n\nIn the first phase with this CIP, when my thesis is published as a book, we want to show in Türkiye that CityDAO contributed to this book. CityDAO has found its place in many places in the book. When examples were given in the explanation of the subject, these examples were given through CityDAO.\n\nIn addition, CityDAO’s logo and the phrase “with CityDAO contributions” will be printed on the back cover of the book. If the text is prepared, we will add this short text written by CityDAO to the back cover of the book or as a preface.\n\nAfter the book is printed, it will be sent to the competent people in the blockchain and crypto ecosystem in Türkiye. In this way, CityDAO will be followed with more interest by the Turkish ecosystem and scientists, and the intellectual accumulation of our community will also develop.\n\nIf CIP is accepted, the following people and communities can be given as examples of the people in the ecosystem to whom the book will be gifted:\n\n-İsmail Hakkı Polat (https://tr.linkedin.com/in/ismailhpolat)\n\n-İTU Blockchain (https://www.itublockchain.com/)\n\n-ODTU Blockchain (https://tr.linkedin.com/company/odtublockchain)\n\n-Devrim Danyal (https://tr.linkedin.com/in/devrimdanyal)\n\n-Hale Cide Demir (https://tr.linkedin.com/in/halecidedemir)\n\nAs a result, if this CIP is accepted and fulfilled, a CIP will be prepared again for the second phase. In the second phase, the book published in Turkish will be translated into English and published by a major publishing house in Europe or the USA under the sponsorship of CityDAO.\n\nPurpose of the CIP\n\nWith this CIP, it is aimed that this book will contribute to build the Web3 city of the future within the scope of the vision of education guild and CityDAO universities, which are the activities of CityDAO. If this CIP is realized, a comprehensive scientific work on DAOs will be the first and only one in Türkiye. This is because there is no specific work on DAOs in Turkish law. This book is written in a simple manner to provide basic information on DAOs to people who are not competent in the field of law. Moreover, the book is quite comprehensive in terms of its volume.\n\nOne of the main objectives of CIP is to popularize the name CityDAO in Türkiye if the name CityDAO is mentioned together with such a work.\n\nCIP’s expenses\n\nFor the first stage I have described above, no money will be paid for publishing the book. In Türkiye, publishing houses do not charge for the first printing of the book, they print the book for free in exchange for publishing rights.\n\nIn the first phase, the author will only need a budget of 2,500 dollars for sponsorship and 1,000 dollars for the purchase and delivery of the book from the publisher to important people in the ecosystem.\n\nProcess\n\nIf the CIP is accepted, the sponsored book will be printed within 1 month at the latest from the date of acceptance.\n\nAfter the printing, gift books will be purchased from the publishing house and delivery will be made to the people to whom they will be sent.\n\nAll expenses will be documented.\n\nRisk factor\n\nThe potential risks are actually quite small. Because the book will be published with or without CityDAO sponsorship. In addition, the publisher will not be given the right to publish the book in English. This right will remain with the author. Therefore, the publishing house will not be able to create problems for the printing in the second phase.\n\nAdditional information and Links\n\nThe thesis version of the book is included in the thesis database of the Council of Higher Education, which is the guiding institution of the universities of the Republic of Türkiye.\n\nClick on the link https://tez.yok.gov.tr/UlusalTezMerkezi/ for the thesis. Then enter \" Blokzincir teknolojisi ile gerçekleştirilen merkeziyetsiz otonom organizasyonların (Dao’ların) hukuki niteliği \" in the “enter search term” section. Click on the pdf image of the result.\n\nThis is my Linkedln profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/salih-karadeniz-3691b122a?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=android_app",

      "title": "CIP 207: CityDAO Compute Cloud - Build a GPU Cluster in Wyoming",
      "content": "I propose we start the world’s first crowdfunded compute cluster in Wyoming to take part in the AI revolution and earn income for the DAO.\n\n### TLDR\nIt’s time to do something big to bring CityDAO back to the forefront of the conversation and bring new life and energy to the DAO, and we are uniquely positioned to pull off building a large cluster of GPUs in Wyoming.\n\nWe have capital, land, and a Wyoming-based legal entity. And at ~6 cents per kWh, Wyoming has just about the cheapest electricity in the states, making it the perfect place to do this.\n\n### Budget:\nTotal proposed budget: $600,000 USD\n\n- $500,000 - Purchase 300 Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090s (and potentially other GPU types)\n- $70,000 - Servers, equipment, other setup costs\n- $30,000 - Legal and misc expenses\n\n### Business Model\nI believe this could generate about $30k / mo for the DAO treasury. Here is the full breakdown of the unit economics 27.\n\nUpon passage of this proposal, Scott will lead implementation of the effort, setting up a fund with CityDAO LLC as the main limited partner and Scott (and potentially others at his discretion) as a General Partner. The DAO will spend $600k for shares in the new fund, and be paid quarterly dividends from the operation of the GPUs. The fund will have a standard 2/20 management fee model. The GPUs will earn revenue by being put on Runpod or a similar service.\n\n### Benefits to CityDAO\n- A consistent income source for the treasury. These GPUs have an estimated payback period of 12 months and after that generate mainly profit.\n- Status and reputation - the first cluster will be called the CityDAO Compute Cluster, and as the first crowdfunded compute cluster will be a hit on Twitter and a real contribution to the AI and crypto communities.\n- Compute - having a bunch of compute is cool - we can let citizens use it at a discount and even train our own models on it.\n\n### Benefits to Citizens\n- Access to a CityDAO Compute Cloud shared server Citizens can use to do things like host websites, run code, etc.\n- Potential for discounted or free compute allocation (depends on the economics and will be considered depending on how fast the GPUs are paying off)\n\n### Why should we do this?\n- Timing - This is the perfect time to start the world’s first crowdfunded GPU cluster.\n- New energy and purpose - CityDAO needs an ambitious new project to rally around. The DAO can build tooling and projects around the cluster. Maybe we can all go to Wyoming and visit!\n- Wyoming connections - We are uniquely already set up to operate in WY and I recently got connected with a Wyoming-based datacenter with just about the cheapest electricity anywhere - 6 cents per kWh that set up all the infrastructure to run GPUs.\n- Future of AI - Demand for compute is projected to increase a lot over the next decade.\n\n### Risks\n- I want to be transparent that it’s hard to predict the future and demand for compute or our specific GPU type could decrease.\n- One reason 4090s are so appealing is they are underpriced in the market because Nvidia’s terms of service require they be used by consumers, not in data centers. One large risk here is that they somehow start enforcing this provision.\n- AI may be in a bit of a bubble and demand for compute could decrease.\n\n### Updates - 2/13/24\n- I’m lowering the ask to $600k - still enough to start up the cluster and run the experiment and a much smaller percent of the DAO treasury\n- At the time the cluster goes live, Citizens will each get a free CityDAO Compute NFT to commemorate the moment.\n\n### Updates - 3/5/24\n- Location: Upon passage, we will do a search for the best data center with the cheapest electricity pricing instead of being tied to Wyoming. For example, states like Texas and Arizona might be better since they have more data center infrastructure already built out.\n- Marketing reel: We will take videos and create a marketing reel documenting the process to post on Discord and Twitter\n\n### Update - 3/8/24\n- Added Risks section\n- Added Citizen Benefits section\n- Diversify beyond 4090s and purchase other GPU types",

Lido currently controls over 30% of all Ethereum validators.\n\nRisk\nWe currently hold ETH and there is no additional ETH exposure risk.\nNo smart contract risk. By running our own validators, we don’t have any smart contract risk with a liquid staking token.\n\nSlashing risk. Validators will be run by a trusted Node Operator with historic experience.\n\nWithdrawals\nThe beaconchain now allows for withdrawals, when we need to sell ETH, we can withdraw validators in 32 ETH lots or all at once.\n\nThere is currently no exit queue to withdraw validators, but this could change in the future and we should plan for withdrawals ahead of them being required.\n\nNode Operator\nThe CityDAO Node will be operated by Reeves (proposal author) who has been running community validators for years. Reeves was a facilitator and Gnosis Signer of the CityDAO Dev guild when it existed, and worked on the Parcel-0 Land NFT.\n\nCosts\nInitial Hardware Costs: $1,500 USD to purchase dedicated hardware for CityDAO.\n\nCommision: 10% of income to the Node Operator to cover running costs (maintenance, power and internet). This is the same commision that is charged by Lido if we were to use stETH. Rocketpool has a 14% commision.",

      "title": "CIP-202: City Council 2.0 International v.2",
      "content": "TLDR\n\nThe purpose of this CIP is to create a more inclusive CityDAO Council and to fund the Community Team, which will make sure we have engagement across multiple communities. This CIP will last for 6 months, followed by democratic, open elections. The quorum for this CIP is 500 votes and the requested total budget is $107K. This CIP combines both a council CIP and the community team CIP, which is why the budget is high.\n\nWhy is this needed?\n\nFor the past year, CityDAO has had some very important problems that we cannot fix without authorization by the community through a CIP. The main problems can be explained in three categories: administrative, legal and taxes.\n\nAdministrative:\n\nOur multisig wallet has members who are no longer part of the DAO. This is not safe.\nOur quorums make it too easy to request large amounts of money and only require 51% approval from voters, no matter how much money is requested.\nOur voting allows for certain individuals to control the votes.\nOur international communities do not have enough representation.\nWe have no process for complaints and grievances, which has led to negative behavior on the discord. This destabilizes our community and makes it harder for citizens to get involved with CityDAO.\nHow to make sure that people who are paid to do work do not get paid unless they accomplish their work.\n\nLegal:\n\nWe don’t have clarity on what CityDAO can do to earn money as an American DAO LLC. Without this, we keep spending money without making any money.\nWe don’t have anyone who can legally sign contracts on behalf of CityDAO for our events, partnerships, or for when we hire independent contractors for work.\n\nTaxes:\n\nWe need to pay our taxes and send out the proper forms from the American IRS to anyone who gets paid more than $600 per year. We need a CPA (certified public accountant) to handle some of these tax issues.\n\nThe proposed City Council 2.0 would include the following seven people: Blackacres, David, Nico, Ming, Lupei, SimplePixel, Serkan\n\nBlackacres\nNorth American (NA) community communication\nAdvisory board communication lead\nHandling and filing taxes including CPA oversight and paperwork\nClarify the charter (GROUP)\nClarify how an NFT holder confirms their citizenship for forum likes\nClarify Snapshot voting to refine algorithmic quorums and/or implement quadratic voting\nHuman Resource Management (GROUP)\nComplaint and grievance process\n\nDavid\nWork with outside counsel to handle legal issues in CityDAO\nClarify who can sign contracts on behalf of CityDAO\nClarify the charter (GROUP)\nClarify how an NFT holder confirms their citizenship for forum likes\nClarify Snapshot voting to refine algorithmic quorums and/or implement quadratic voting\nHuman Resource Management (GROUP)\nComplaint and grievance process\nHiring and dismissal of independent contractors\nDismissal of council members and other DAO members from groups\nClarification on DAO tool access\n\nNico\nTaking notes on meetings\nSummarize round-ups\nKeeping things in check on that we’re on topic at meetings\nCommunity (GROUP)\nCross channel communication across communities\nHelp out with community calls, especially with NA and China areas.\nHosting Twitter (X) Spaces\nStrategic operations (GROUP)\nIf someone proposed something and didn’t follow through, should they still get paid? The work people say they’ll do and what they actually do should be documented and shared with the DAO.\nHow can we ensure accountabilities for passed CIPs\nAssist with strategic communications about the long term development for CityDAO - what are we building?\n\nMing\nCN community communication\nWechat group management and public account management\nIRL meetups in China\nTranslate newspapers and round-up into Chinese\nPartnerships and communication with other CN DAOs\nDAO TALK Twitter Space\nStrategic operations (GROUP)\nDevelop operational and marketing plans\nPlan CityDAO branding activities\n\nLupei\nThai community communication\nTranslation and content tailoring in Thai community\nIRL meetups in Thailand (as needed)\nCommunity operations (GROUP)\nMaking sure everyone in the DAO has the same information\nCommunity activities / projects management\nCityDAO contest organization\nPublishing newspaper\nTwitter(X) management/access.\n\nSimplePixel\nCo-lead Turkish community communication\nManagement of partnerships with Turkish DAO/web3 organizations\nIRL events in Turkey\nCommunity operations (GROUP)\nManagement of community activities and projects for overall DAO\nHosting TR Twitter spaces\nCityDAO contest organization\nStrategic operations (GROUP)\nClarifying the CIP process\nMaking a clear template for the creation of CIPs\nClarify the charter (GROUP)\nClarify how an NFT holder confirms their citizenship for forum likes\nClarify Snapshot voting to refine algorithmic quorums and/or implement quadratic voting\nMarketing / Events (GROUP)\nFigure out what upcoming events are happening globally and locally\nMake a CIP and work with others on an events budget\nSponsorship & event participation for Turkish Community\n\nSerkan\nCo-lead Turkish community communication\nCo-hosting biweekly Discord TR community calls\nTranslation of newspaper and round-up into Turkish\nCommunity (GROUP)\nRepresenting the First & Founding citizens\nConnecting and gathering info about active/passive citizens on Discord & Twitter\nStrategic operations (GROUP)\nResearch other DAOs about success / failure\n\nAdvisory / CityDAO Assembly (non voting): Anyone with more than 50 Citizen NFTs or any Founder NFTs. Being a member of the CityDAO Assembly provides streamlined access to the council and community team, which includes efficient feedback, communication, development of ideas and assistance in turning ideas into viable CIPs. This will be implemented after discussion and after main priorities are accomplished.\n\nIf any council member misses more than two meetings without explanation, they will be removed from the council. They will not be replaced until the next election. Voting on all issues within the council will require 4 of 7 votes to pass, except that choosing members of the multisig will require unanimous council approval. \n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n\nCity Council 2.0 is meant to accomplish very specific goals. Each of these goals is directly tied to the effectiveness of CityDAO. The planned goals are as follows:\n\nMonth 1-3\n\nHow to confirm citizenship for likes\nAdjusting quorums\nUpdate Charter\nOperations\nClarify the process of CIP creation → Forum → Snapshot\nMaking a clear template for the creation of CIPs\nClarify how an NFT holder confirms their citizenship\nEnsure that only verified citizens are able to “like” CIPs on the Discourse forum\nClarify Snapshot voting to refine quorums and/or implement quadratic voting\nWho posts Snapshot votes when the 20 like threshold is reached\nClarification of DAO tool access\nClarifying access process for Twitter & Discord\nTaxes and CPA relationship management and organization\nAppoint the 8-person multisig, remove non-participating members, and make clear rules\n\nMonth 3-6\n\nLegal\nEstablishing contact with outside council\nMaking sure there is a clear pipeline for legal questions to be answered\nWho can sign contracts\nCityDAO treasury payments from projects\nUsing NFTs as compensation to citizens\nMaintaining or hiring people to maintain the DAO tools including Discord, Discourse, Snapshot, Website, Notion, and Twitter\n\nHuman Resource Management\nMake rules for how members are removed in the future\nEstablishing and enforcing regulations for behavior on Discourse and Discord\nEstablishing a complaint and grievance process for CityDAO citizens\n\nBUDGET BREAKDOWN\n\nCouncil Members: $1500 per member per month ($63,000 total)\nLawyers, Accountants and Other Professionals: $12K total\nCouncil Fund (only used for bounties and hiring): $20K total\nCommunity Fund : $12K total",

Note that the expenses sought to be reimbursed from this CIP are for physical out-of-pocket expenses only. None of the funds requested for in this CIP are for his personal time as this was a volunteer based initiative.\n\nBackground\n\nCityDAO has participated at numerous major events in the past such as Permissionless, ETH Denver, DCentral, and more. Participating at these events provides benefits such as; potential recruitment of new contributors, credibility in the ecosystem, IRL meeting points for CityDAO Citizens to get to know each other better, in-person meeting and strategy sessions for Citizens, social media content, and more.\n\nMemeBrains used to have a small event production company from his early entrepreneurial career and produced approx 12 events for the Toronto small-business community ranging from 50ppl - 500ppl in size. He volunteered himself to carry out this initiative for CityDAO.",

The space will be collectively owned by CityDAO and available for Citizens to co-work in, serving as a home base for Citizens to build especially during ETH Denver.\n\nThe space can be opened up (or rented out) for events, hackathons, build weeks, and used as co-working to achieve a sustainable business model. This CIP allows for the acquisition of the property but does not force CityDAO to acquire one or operate any specific activities. \n\n## Potential Uses & Benefits\nOnce acquired, the following uses can be immediately considered:\n\n- Flexible co-working space for Citizens - the \"City Hall\" for CityDAO.\n- Community events, hackathons, and educational programs.\n- Develop local partnerships and sponsorships.\n- Any other community-led initiatives that align with CityDAO's values and objectives.\n- Citizen Benefits where permitted\n\nBy securing the property, this CIP provides CityDAO with the flexibility to explore various optional avenues for community engagement, innovation, and revenue generation, as deemed fit and approved by the DAO's governance mechanisms.\n\n\n## Budget:\n#### **Total Allocation:** $1,630,000\n- **Property Cost:** Up to $1.5M\nReleased by multisig upon final property selection\n- **Operating Expenses Reserve Fund:** $100k (property taxes, utilities, maintenance, other operating related expenses)\nReleased by multisig upon final property selection\n- **Project Budget:** $30k (travel, legal, brokers, furnishing, etc)\nReleased by multisig upon passage of this CIP\nIf we the full Property Cost is not spent, up to 10% of the extra funds may be allocated to the OpEx Reserve Fund\n\n**Flexible allocation**\nThe budget outlined is based on current estimates and while it will not exceed 1.63m, may be re-allocated within these categories based on actual needs and unforeseen circumstances. Upon approval from the CityDAO Multisig signatories, the team may redistribute funds between budget categories (Property Cost, Operating Expenses Reserve Fund, Project Budget) up to a limit of 10% of the total allocation without requiring an amendment to this CIP.\n\n## Project Team:\nThis project is fundamentally a DAO-driven initiative and CityDAO citizens retain the ultimate authority and responsibility for the project. While the DAO provides oversight and final approvals, a dedicated Project Team is in place to execute on the DAO's directives and manage day-to-day operations. The Project Team serves as an extension of CityDAO, carrying out the technical, operational, and strategic tasks necessary to bring the project to fruition.\n\n## Team Members:\n\n**Scott: Lead Coordinator**\nRoles: Property tours, broker liaison, contract management, and other necessary duties.\n\n**Lyons: Strategy & Operations**\nRoles: Community engagement, space utilization, and other necessary duties.\n\n**Specialists: Legal advisors, property managers, and architects**\nRoles: To be hired from the project budget as needed.\n\n**HQ Task Force: Community Liaisons**\nRoles: Real-time updates, property vetting, and community feedback\n\nNote: While the Project Team will endeavor to select and operate the best possible space, there are no guarantees concerning the quality of the space, revenue generation, or specific use of the space.\n\n## Property Selection:\n### Selection Criteria:\n- Convenient access from ETH Denver venues\n- Newer or remodeled construction that is low maintenance\n- Size and layout conducive for co-working and events\n- High quality space with good natural light\n\n### Selection Process:\n[Sample Property Selection Process and Criteria](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zm-CHIDEuCaotgDaPuS_eKvVN5E2vkywfTRN4sjIXrQ/edit#heading=h.irqkxbj3yys6) \n\nWhile the criteria and sample process outlined are designed to guide the property selection towards the most favorable outcome for CityDAO and its members, it is understood that unique opportunities and challenges may arise. Therefore, the Project Team reserves the right to adjust these parameters as deemed necessary for the benefit of the project and community. \n\n## Sample Properties\n\n[821 22nd St, Denver, CO 80205](https://www.loopnet.com/Listing/821-22nd-St-Denver-CO/28630217/)\n\n[1641 California St, Denver, CO 80202](https://www.loopnet.com/Listing/1641-California-St-Denver-CO/28556746/)\n\n[5134 W 29th Ave, Denver, CO 80212](https://www.loopnet.com/Listing/5134-W-29th-Ave-Denver-CO/28777792/)\n\n### 90 Day Plan - Tentative Sample\n**0-30 days**: After the CIP passes, a search will immediately begin for properties. Scott, Lyons, and other interested Citizens will fly out to Denver and tour properties to get a feel for the market and our options. The initial $30k will be converted to fiat for travel to Denver, broker fees, and in preparation for making a deposit. We'll start sharing our favorite properties with Citizens in Discord.\n**30-60 days**: Narrow down the list of properties. Record video tours of the properties, do diligence and put together a plan on the estimated costs and benefits of owning each of the properties. For each property, we will compile a report, video tour, and share them for feedback with the DAO.\n**60-90 days**: If a promising property is identified, we will present it to the DAO on a community call for feedback, questions, and comments. After identifying one we are excited about, we will ask the DAO to do an informal \"temp check\" vote on that property (not a CIP). If the vote passes, the multisig will offramp up to $1.5m for purchase of the property and transfer $100k in reserve funds to\n the Property Multisig.\n\n## Post-close\nAfter closing on the property, we will plan a CityDAO Build Week where we will invite citizens to come set up the space and help with furnishing, signage, and decorations. We will also try to involve remote Citizens who cannot attend in person for things like design and ideas for the space. Budget permitting, we can subsidize travel and lodging for interested Citizens.\n\n## Property Governance and Oversight Multisig\nAfter acquisition, the property will be overseen by a multisig consisting of Scott, Lyons, and one independent member appointed by the CityDAO Multisig or CityDAO Council if the CIP authorizing its creation passes. They will steward the reserve funding in the multisig, from which they will handle things like property management, taxes, and ops hires. Property Multisig shall make best efforts to ensure the property is well kept and managed. \n\n## Contingency Plans\nIf City Hall is unable to sustain ongoing operations due to lack of revenue, management conflict, or other unforeseen circumstances, then the property shall be sold and all funds returned to the CityDAO treasury.",

This proposal seeks $9,990 for a three-year sponsorship for RTM to create a Research Hub and the world’s first peer-reviewed, open access DAO-related journal (official name TBD). As a sponor, the benefit to CityDAO could be enormous – leading scholars, government think tanks and research institutions with huge communities around the world would be introduced to CityDAO. RTM will create and run the journal. We will benefit from its marketing and advertising CityDAO.\n\nHow would this benefit CityDAO?\n\nSimply put, this is the best form of marketing that CityDAO could possibly ask for when it comes to recruiting researchers and institutions. Establishing CityDAO as a sponsor for scholarship on DAOs opens us up to an enormous potential group of citizens and participants that we could not possibly find within the web3 ecosystem. The people reached by this project will be highly-educated adults and industry leaders, those with the funds and the understanding to make real contributions to CityDAO rather than those who are just motivated by the NFT prices and the hope of a quick profit. In addition, we can be assured of quality because this journal is being run by RTM, a group of well-published scholars and academic professors with over twenty years’ experience.\n\nWhat is a Peer-Reviewed Journal?\n\nIn the world of legitimate academic research, only peer-reviewed journals matter. This is a harsh but true statement. DAOs operate in a world of blogs, mirror articles, YouTube videos, Twitter posts and various centralized servers. While they serve a purpose, none of these have true validity in the world of scholarship, research and government funding. A peer-reviewed journal is the gold standard.\n\nPeer-reviewed journals publish studies that have been reviewed by academics, in order to create a body of knowledge that is accepted by professors, universities, and institutions around the world. While web3 has produced an endless waterfall of information, very little of it has been rigorously studied and published. As one of the most legitimate DAOs in existence, CityDAO is perfectly poised to sponsor a journal on DAOs. While there are very few journals devoted to blockchain and AI, there is nothing yet devoted to DAOs.\n\nIt is extremely complicated, bureaucratic, and time-consuming to create a peer-reviewed journal. It is similar to creating a university; it cannot be done by the average person, which is why this is such a tremendous opportunity. I have worked with RTM for over a year on DAO-related research and this opportunity would put us in contact with many of the most highly placed individuals who are studying DAOs. It would put CityDAO’s name into the minds of highly funded government and research institutions around the world.\n\nBut this isn’t web3, is it?\n\nMuch of the initial hype and notoriety regarding CityDAO was due to a single blogpost by Vitalik Buterin and the subsequent purchase of citizenship NFTs by a few celebrities. This was followed by news stories in traditional media sources, such as the Wall Street Journal, and a TED talk by CityDAO’s founder.\n\nSince then, despite two years of development, working on various projects, hosting events and contests, participating in conferences, teaching university courses, maintaining partnerships and collaborations, running a consistent podcast, publishing twitter posts and monthly newspapers, nothing has significantly drawn people to CityDAO. Our community has not strengthened. Our Discord server is not an exciting place.\n\nThe bear market could be blamed, and may have contributed, but a possible issue is that we have only targeted the web3 community. In web3, while some people care about ideals such as decentralization, transparency and disrupting traditional paradigms, many people only care about NFT prices. However, a focus on price without value will never flourish.\n\nOne thing we have learned is that people must be attracted to our ideas and to our community, or else no one will want to join or participate, whether we buy one office or twenty. RTM is presenting an opportunity to join forces with researchers from around the world who study DAOs, each of whom brings with them a wide audience. This is a one-time opportunity.\n\nBackground to RTM\n\nThe Institute for Research and Theory Methodologies (RTM) was founded in 2021 by Dr. Kara Vander Linden, who has been a research professor for 20 years, working at Saybrook University in California for almost 12 years. The purpose of her organization is to train, mentor, support and connect students, faculty and researchers worldwide. As a relatively new organization, RTM is willing to partner with a smaller organization like CityDAO to focus on research about the DAO space. I have personally worked with RTM and Kara for over a year (unpaid), and have found the organization to be well-organized and run.\n\nHow would the funds be used?\n\nJournal Fees: $1500 per year. For three years, that would be $4500.\nOperating Costs: $1000 per year. For three years, that would be $3000.\nHonorariums: (given to Editor-in-Chief, Assistant Editors, Copy Editors) $2990\n\nGiven that this is funding for a three-year project, this project may seek funding from other sources in addition to CityDAO.\n\nIf this passes, the funds will be transferred into a 3/5 multisig wallet controlled by two members of CityDAO and three members of RTM. All expenditures will be documented.\n\nSchedule\n\nFrom the time of this CIP passing, it will take approximately 6 months to get the research hub and journal platform set up, establish an ISBN number for the journal, handle administration, recruit and train peer reviewers. Then a call for articles will be put out, which will go through the peer review process. It would be approximately one year before the first edition is published, which will be properly ranked as an official academic journal. These steps are critical for the long-term success of this project.",

      "title": "CIP 182 - t0wn STAGE ONE funding allocation",
      "content": "TLDR: This proposal enables the t0wn team to reallocate the resources from [Stage 1 of the t0wn project](https://snapshot.org/#/daocity.eth/proposal/0xb97a8bcc02e6ee7bc72d8a2853afc98d74a1412eebebfbf5634fbacd0b03a9b8) toward **building two apps that will more immediately and concretely benefit the t0wn project and CityDAO as a whole.** The overall plan for t0wn has not changed. \n\n**This proposal asks for only $1 of additional funding** **to secure a quorum of 250 votes.** Other than that, we are merely asking for the ability to reallocate funds that have already been sent to our treasury. **We have removed our request for additional funding based on the responses in the forum**, which we take very seriously. To us, t0wn is a community made of its valued members, and compromise is the language of cooperation. \n\n**OVERVIEW**\n\nThe t0wn team has been meeting weekly for months. We’ve had several meetings with the [Próspera](https://prospera.hn/) team about possibly acquiring real estate in it’s first tower as a first physical hub for t0wn. Those discussions remain ongoing. We’ve had all sorts of contact, discussion and meetings with potential member DAOs. Our aim is to reallocate the remaining funds toward building apps that will help push this project forward. \n\nAs of today, a little over $54,000 remains in the t0wn treasury. Our initial CIP called for $32K in t0wn team compensation and $20K in discretionary funds. $1K compensation has been paid out per team member ($4k total) and no other money has been spent. Based on our internal weekly discussions, meetings with other DAOs and projects, Twitter spaces and independent research, we are clearer on how we think the discretionary funds should be spent.\n\n**FUNDING**\n\nWe would like the ability to reallocate the remaining funds toward: \n\n1. A dominant assurance smart contract\n2. A identity verification app that KYCs individuals to global banking standards and ties the verified individual to one and only one ETH address with a soulbound token. This app will consist of two components:\n    1. KYC functionality - for example, a custom front end that utilizes the API of a third party KYC service like Plaid.\n    2. A NFT smart contract, likely employing the ERC-5484 standard for soulbound tokens.\n3. Legal costs relating to analyzing the appropriate DAO structure\n\n**PROJECT DETAILS**\n\nAssurance contract: Our initial t0wn STAGE 1 plan was to have DAOs sign LOIs stating their intent to contribute to a t0wn treasury to buy land for a “DAO hub.” We decided it would not only benefit t0wn, but also CityDAO and the web3 community at large if we figured out how to program the essence of an LOI into a smart contract. Utilizing [Alex Tabarrok’s Dominant Assurance Contract](https://foresight.org/summary/dominant-assurance-contracts-alex-tabarrok-george-mason-university/)  idea, we will create a smart contract where entities can pledge money toward a public good (like t0wn). If the funding threshold is hit by a certain deadline (which is programmed into the smart contract when it is deployed), the project gets funded. If the threshold is not hit by the deadline, everyone gets their money back and those that contributed the earliest get a small monetary “prize” for having been the first movers / believers. Details around the prize mechanics will be sorted out during development, one key component being the prize is big enough to incentivize early contribution but small enough to disincentivize entities wanting the project to fail.\n\nBuilding a dominant assurance smart contract will not only be a boon to t0wn and CityDAO, but also to anyone who wants to fund a public good on the blockchain without using methods such as Juicebox that take a significant percentage of funds. \n\nIdentity Verification: Part of having a community is ensuring that people are not sybils, that identities can be verified. Rather than using a method such as NFT + Gitcoin Passport or Proof of Humanity, we would like to offer individuals the ability to KYC to global banking standards, verify ownership of a wallet address, and then marry the two with a soulbound token. We plan to use the ERC-5484 standard for soulbound tokens which allows both the issuer and the holder to burn the token - the former being necessary in case of identity fraud and the latter being necessary in case the holder wants to disconnect or move their identity to a different address.\n\n**RELATIONSHIP TO THE ORIGINAL t0wn CIP (IPFS #QmWXdW6)**\n\nThis proposal augments STAGE ONE of the original proposal by allowing additional uses of the funding allocated by that proposal. It also adds an additional potential STAGE TWO trigger—a deployed assurance contract that successfully raises at least $750k will automatically trigger STAGE TWO. The t0wn team will determine which avenue to pursue (ie signed LOIs or raising via assurance contract) following development of the latter.\n\n**BENEFITS TO CITYDAO CITIZENS**\n\n- All the benefits outlined in the [original t0wn proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/daocity.eth/proposal/0xb97a8bcc02e6ee7bc72d8a2853afc98d74a1412eebebfbf5634fbacd0b03a9b8) remain.\n- CityDAO Citizens will be able to use the app at cost for a period of one year after the app is launched, subject to reasonable volume of usage and our team’s ability to handle such volume. We will make best efforts to allow CityDAO Citizens to use the app at cost for longer than one year, again subject to reasonable volume of usage and our team’s ability to handle such volume.\n- Open use of the dominant assurance smart contract and the ERC-5484 soulbound token contract.\n\n**OWNERSHIP OF WORK PRODUCT**\n\n- The dominant assurance smart contract and the ERC-5484 soulbound token contract will be open source.\n- The rest of the KYC app will be owned by the Friends of Town Foundation corporation.",

      "title": "CIP-179: Retaining Pat Santiago for Enhanced Autonomy and Operational Excellence",
      "content": "NOTE: I am posting this CIP on behalf of Pat Santiago. \n\nSummary\nThis proposal aims to retain Pat Santiago as an advisor for three months to work on a project that will enhance the autonomy of CityDAO.\n\nBackground\nCityDAO has been actively working on expanding its reach and enhancing its operations. Pat Santiago is an experienced professional with a strong track record in the development and management of automated workflows. His expertise and insights can help CityDAO achieve a higher level of operational autonomy and efficiency.\n\nProposal\nPat Santiago will be retained for three months to work on the following key areas:\n\n1. Analyzing the current governance structure and providing recommendations on how to improve and optimize it to make CityDAO more autonomous.\n\n2. Identifying essential operational bottlenecks and proposing solutions to streamline the decision-making process.\n\n3. Developing a roadmap for integrating automated tools and systems that will reduce manual intervention in CityDAO’s daily operations.\n\n4. Conducting a thorough assessment of CityDAO’s technical infrastructure and providing recommendations for enhancements that will ensure robustness and autonomy.\n\n5. Collaborating with the community to design and implement innovative solutions for decentralizing power and enabling more effective collaboration among the DAO’s members.\n\nFinancials\nPat Santiago will be paid a fee of $2499/month for their service, for a total engagement cost of $7497 over three months. The payment will be made in Ethereum at the prevailing exchange rate at the time of payment, and in one lump sum payment on the day that this CIP passes. \n\nOutcomes\nAt the end of the three-month engagement, Pat Santiago will provide a comprehensive report detailing his findings, recommendations, and results achieved during this period. This report will serve as a guide for CityDAO to continue working on achieving enhanced autonomy and operational efficiency.\n\nWith this proposed CIP, CityDAO will benefit from Pat Santiago’s expertise in making the DAO more autonomous and operationally efficient. The investment of $2499/month for three months aligns with CityDAO’s goals and can help pave the way for sustained growth and success.\n\nTo ensure that Pat Santiago’s work effectively contributes to CityDAO’s progress toward autonomy and to address the community’s concerns, it is crucial to establish a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the work’s tangible outcomes and deliverables. The following KPIs are recommended:\n\n- Roadmap Completion Rate: Percentage of milestones outlined in the autonomy roadmap achieved within the specified timeline.\n\n- Risk Mitigation Success: Number of identified risks successfully mitigated or resolved during the consultancy period.\n\n- KPI Achievement Rate: Percentage of established KPIs reached or surpassed by the end of the consultancy period.\n\n- Community Engagement Index: Number of workshops and training sessions conducted for the CityDAO community members, with a focus on knowledge transfer and capacity building.\n\n- Collaboration Expansion: Number of partnerships and collaborations established with other parties and stakeholders during the consultancy period, working toward CityDAO’s autonomy.\n\n- To effectively track the progress of CityDAO’s autonomy and monitor the achievement of these KPIs, a progress tracking system can be implemented as follows:\n\n- Establish Baseline Metrics: Determine the initial values for each KPI at the beginning of the consultancy period.\n\n- Set Target Metrics: Define the desired outcomes for each KPI for the duration of the consultancy period.\n\n- Periodic Evaluation: Conduct regular evaluations (e.g., bi-weekly or monthly) to assess the progress of each KPI, comparing the current values with the baseline and target metrics.\n\n- Progress Reports: Pat Santiago will submit progress reports to the CityDAO community at predetermined intervals (e.g., monthly), detailing the results of the evaluations and providing updates on the progress made towards autonomy.\n\n- Continuous Improvement: Based on the progress reports and evaluations, identify areas that require improvement or adjustments, and implement the necessary changes to ensure the successful achievement of the KPIs and CityDAO’s autonomy objectives.\n\nBy establishing these KPIs and implementing a progress tracking system, CityDAO can effectively monitor and evaluate Pat Santiago’s work, guaranteeing that the consultancy period yields tangible outcomes and brings the organization closer to achieving its autonomy goals.\n\nAs a demonstration of his skills Pat created an autonomous GPT agent to write this CIP and respond to any comments on it.",

      "title": "CIP-151: Quorum and Elections",
      "content": "TLDR\n\nThis proposal has 3 main fuctions: \n1. Adjust Quorums\n2. Hold Elections for City Council\n3. Establish a Complaint Process\n\nCategory - Governance\nCriticalness - High\nImpact - High (All members of DAO will be affected)\nDuration - 6 months\nQuorum - 500 votes counted as 1 NFT = 1 vote\nBudget - 46,800 (+ bonuses up  to $18,000)\n\nThe three goals are explained in more detail below: \n \n--Adjust quorums--\n\nCurrently, the way votes are counted for quorum is 1 NFT = 1 vote. After a year of governance, CityDAO contributors have realized that it makes no sense for quorum to be the same for $11K and for $2 million, and it makes no sense that a non-financial vote has the same quorum as a CIP for $2 million. The new proposed system would still count 1 NFT as 1 vote for quorum with the following amendments:\n\n1 vote = 1 quadratically-counted NFT\nAn algorithm will be used to determine the quorum for different request amounts.\nAn algorithm will be used to determine the voter approval rating\n\nQuorum Algorithm: 50 + [1/2 * (sqrt $Ask)]\nVoter Approval Rating Algorithm: 66 + 24 ($ ask / treasury)\n\n* To amend the Charter will require a quorum of 200 counted quadratically. Currently, it takes 1000 votes counted non-quadratically to amend the Operating Agreement (OA). This CIP does not intend to alter or amend the OA. This includes NOT changing how votes are counted for altering or amending the OA. They will be counted non-quadratically as 1 NFT = 1 vote.\n\n--Hold Elections for City Council--\n\nThis CIP will create elections for seven (7) members of City Council. Within one week after elections are completed, the Council will choose one (1) individual from inside or outside the Council to serve as the Executive Facilitator (EF). If a member of the Council is chosen as the EF, then the remaining Council members will choose one additional member. \n\nThe EF will be a separate position and is not in the Council. The Council delegates the authority to the EF. The EF does not vote in the Council. The EF will be in charge of the day-to-day administration and operational  execution, while the City Council is in policy setting and strategic direction. The Council may determine the authorities of the EF. The Council may not interfere in the EF’s authorities except if the EF is incapacitated. The Council are the decisions makers and the EF handles implementation. \n\n The EF will have the following powers and authority:\n- Implementation of projects, including resource availability and oversight\n- Handle relationships with outside counsel\n- Handle mailing address, copyrights, trademarks, legal formalities\n- Handle relationships with CPAs for bookkeeping and taxes\n- Any powers and authorities delegated by a majority vote of the City Council\n\nThe City Council will have the following powers and authority: \n\n- Appointment of Executive Facilitator.\n- Possible hiring of an Ops Admin\n- Appointment of Multisig Signers.\n- Create advisory boards of citizens.\n- Policy setting and strategic direction. \n- Maintain or hire people to maintain the DAO tools\n- Adopt its own rules of procedure and set the time and place of its official meetings.\n- Provide for the prosecution and defense of legal causes on behalf of CityDAO and retain counsel and set their compensation.\n- Establish and enforce regulations for behavior.\n- Establish and enforce regulations for the resolution of disputes.\n- Enter into agreements with other DAOs or entities.\n- Levy and collect taxes, rents, lease fees and other sources of revenue. \n- Make investigations of CityDAO affairs; inquire into accounts, records, and transactions of any CityDAO department, office, or officer; and, for these purposes, require reports from any project and the production of official records.\n- Adopt rules and regulations necessary for the exercise of its powers and prescribe fines and penalties for the violation of ordinances in accordance with city law.\n- Place questions or propositions directly onto Snapshot, when agreed to by 5 of 7 of the total membership of the City Council.\n\nThe City Council will appoint the eight (8) multisig signers. The role of the multisig signers is transaction execution and transaction evaluation. All multisig signers will undergo proper training to fully grasp the implications and responsibilities of being on the multisig. The multisig signers are responsible to check transactions, to check where the funds are being sent, and to follow all the requirements for a proper transaction for the protection of CityDAO. The key aspect of the multisig is that the signers be trusted members of the DAO. \n\nOperations and Day-to-Day Administration\n\nThe City Council will help organize and delegate operational tasks, such as maintaining the meeting minutes, permissions, passwords, independent contractor agreements and contracts. The City Council will schedule weekly meetings at regular times, which will not be changed with less than 48 hours notice. Council members will each have the highest level of admin permissions on each of CityDAO’s tools, including but not limited to discord discourse, Twitter, Notion, Snapshot and Google Workspace. The Council will determine who else should hold any permissions or passwords. \n\nCIP Template Creation and Management\n\nIn addition to formatting a template for CIPs, the City Council will help problem-solve and request additional information where necessary, to make sure that proposals further the mission of the DAO. \n\nTransparency Dashboard\n\nThe City Council will require that, for quality, transparency and clarity, all CityDAO projects create a transparent and available document that provides all pertinent information on funding received, expenditures, milestones and benchmarks. This document will be written in plain English and will be available at all times to all citizens on the CityDAO website or Notion page. The Council will finalize the details of the process. This is not meant to punish people but to provide transparency. Project members must populate the dashboard in order to receive continued funding.\n\nElection Method\n\nIf this CIP passes, there will be open elections for seven (7) City Council members, all with six-month terms that begin on the day the election ends. Any citizen may run for any position. A citizen may be on the City Council and the multisig simultaneously. There will be no hierarchy of members on the City Council.\n\nTo be elected, candidates must put up a platform statement on Discourse. All candidates will take part in a series of two (2) public debates with questions submitted in advance by any citizen, moderated and run by the Community and Media Guilds together. After the debates, separate ranked choice votes will be put on Snapshot. All elected members of the multisig and the City Council must be willing to be KYC’d.\n\nElection Rules\n\n- The election may not be used as an excuse to disparage the character of another member of the DAO. \n- Candidates may not make pledges, promises, or commitments of any sort.\n\nCompensation and Budgets\n\nMultisig Compensation: The multisig signers will receive $100 per month each,  regardless of who actually signs the transactions. This is meant to incentivize all members to pay close attention to the transactions, their purpose, destination, suitability and potential liability to the DAO.\n\nCity Council Compensation: 3 Citizenship NFT per month per councilmember; City Council will have a fund of 5 NFTs total per month to bring in talented individuals to the DAO. 4 of 7 vote required to give an NFT. \n\nExecutive Facilitator: The EF will receive $3K per month in compensation + a potential bonus of up to $3K per month based on performance from the City Council, and will have a budget of $24K over six (6) months and the authority to execute agreements. \n\n* In an emergency event where CityDAO gets sued and is required to pay fees in excess of the funds in the City Council treasury, the City Council can put a CIP on Discourse and Snapshot concurrently, with no time limits required. Quorum will be however many people vote. \n\nRemoval\n\nThe multisig signers will have one week to sign or reject transactions. If a transaction is rejected, the signers must document reasons why and next steps within a reasonable time. If any of the multisig signers refuse to sign (2) or more transactions, they will be removed and the candidate who had the next highest vote will replace them. If there are no candidates left, a new election will be held for replacements or the City Council will choose replacements. The members of the multisig can vote off any member with a 5 of 8 vote. \n\nIf any of the City Council members miss more than three (3) meetings, they will be removed and replaced in the same manner as the multisig signers. The City Council can vote off any member with a 5 of 7 vote. The City Council can remove the EF at any time with a 5 of 7 vote. CityDAO Citizens can call for a removal or replacement of members of the multisig or the City Council or the Executive Facilitator with a CIP and a quorum of 50 votes. If a CIP is put up, it will be done with an anonymous “City Council” account so no one feels pressure to doxx. \n\n--Complaint Process--\n\nA complaint may subject the citizen to penalties up to and including a prohibition on offending parties from holding administrative positions at CityDAO or in CityDAO projects.\n\n- Substance - What Constitutes a Complaint?\n\nAn allegation of wrongdoing related to projects, behavior, transactions, or violations of the rules at CityDAO.\n\n- Process - How is a Complaint Dealt With?\n\nStep 1 - Mediation by an individual who is agreed-upon by both parties. \n\nBoth parties must agree on an individual, preferably (but not necessarily) a CityDAO Citizen, who will hear both sides of the argument and attempt to mediate between the two parties. \n\nStep 2 - Random jury (Randomocracy)\n\nComplaints that reach step 2 will be heard by a Kleros court. In case of failure, the City Council can choose to use a randomly selected group of six (6) CityDAO citizens using the Chainlink Verifiable Randomness Function (VRF). If either party is not satisfied with the decision, they may appeal to a Kleros appeals court. \n\nBoth parties must write a complaint document. This complaint of wrongdoing needs to be complete and make specific allegations along with any evidence. Payment for “jury duty” is $50 per person. This jury of 6 people will make a binding decision based on the facts presented. The Executive Facilitator will enforce the result by initiating a resolution that will go to the City Council to handle the dispute accordingly. \n",

      "title": "CIP145 - Elections for the CityDAO Multisig",
      "content": "TL/DR: This is a proposal that seeks to:\nEstablish a formal election process (“CityDAO Election Process”) to be used initially for the CityDAO Multisig (“Multisig Election”);\nEstablish compensation and limited authority for the Elected Multisig;\nEmpower Walter Clapp as the Election Facilitator (@wdclapp Discord handle) to administer the Multisig Election and all related aspects of the election process;\nCompensate Walter (and any team members, as may be determined by Walter in his discretion) for the efforts and undertakings relating to #1, 2, and 3 above.​ Total target compensation = $9,000 (the “Election Comp Pool”); which includes Walter’s compensation plus money available to compensate assistant(s) at Walter’s sole discretion.)\nSECTION 3.05 of the Operating Agreement states CityDAO’s purpose and mission as follows: \n“PURPOSE; POWERS. CityDAO was established for the purpose and mission of exploring decentralized governance mechanisms as well as establishing verification of physical asset ownership, such as real property, on the Ethereum Blockchain.”\nCityDAO has not spent adequate time or money on decentralized governance and this CIP aims to change that dynamic. The time for elections at CityDAO is here. Our First Election will be to Elect Members of the Multisig.\nAccording to Chat GPT, “Here are some reasons why DAOs might use elections:\nRepresentation: Elections allow DAO members to choose representatives who can make decisions on their behalf. This can help ensure that the decisions made by the DAO are aligned with the interests of its members.\n\nAccountability: Elections can hold representatives accountable to the DAO members. If representatives fail to perform their duties or act in a way that is not in the best interests of the DAO, they can be removed from their positions through a vote.\n\nTransparency: Elections can provide transparency in the decision-making process. All members have the opportunity to participate in the voting process and have a say in the direction of the DAO.\nEfficiency: Elections can help DAOs make decisions more efficiently. By delegating decision-making to elected representatives, the DAO can avoid delays and inefficiencies that might result from a more decentralized decision-making process.\n\nLegitimacy: Elections can help legitimize the decisions made by the DAO. When decisions are made through a transparent and democratic process, members are more likely to accept and support them.”\nCurrently - The “Multisig” is a body of eight (8) individuals who own private keys that own and control the CityDAO Main Safe Treasury. There are a few ways to manage a DAO Treasury and in the early days CityDAO chose the centralized manner of establishing a Multi-signature Smart Contract. Currently, 5 of 8 signers must sign a transaction to use money from the DAO’s treasury.\nThis CIP creates a Multisig election. Each seat will be paid $200 per month.\nThis CIP also confirms the Multisig authority to not sign transactions if they violate any act of governance (CIP, Charter, or OA), or violate US/Wyoming Law. \nWalter Clapp will oversee and implement the first election of the current 8 Multisig seats pursuant to this CIP. Walter makes sense as a licensed attorney, and his interest in reinvigorating the republic in America, including a vision for a Constitutional Convention. Walter is also a public candidate for President of the U.S. Walter can achieve the goal of getting CityDAO from the appointed Multisig of today to the Elected Multisig of CityDAO’s future.\nThe election is intended to be completed by July 1, 2023. Multisig members will be up for election every 1 year. July 2023 multisig members will be replaced in July 2024 and so on. Unless a new CIP is passed to amend this one, it will recur with automatic passage annually. Multisig members may serve a maximum of two terms.\nOnce this CIP passes, the CIP and election, to completion, will be publicized by the DAO to Twitter, the Website, Discord, Discourse, and via email. \nNominations will be open to be submitted via Forum (Discourse). Self-nominations are prohibited. Nominations will require the person nominating to provide proof of humanity via a photo of their face with the nominee’s name on a piece of paper held by the nominator. Nominations for individuals will be subject to open Q&A, as well as limited debates that may be hosted by Walter.\n\nEligibility: Nominees will be required to go through KYC and AML, and any other legal hurdles required by the US or Wyoming law, prior to the vote. \nNominations will open upon passage of this CIP and shall close on June 1, 2023. Walter will then compile a list of all qualified nominees for voting after the close of each round of nominations..\nA virtual synchronous election over a seven (7) day period will occur via a CityDAO Citizen token gated discord channel (or Snapshot) administered by Walter and other present admins. Each citizen will be asked to rank their top eight (8) votes for the multisig. All citizens may only vote one time. Walter will manually tabulate the winners pursuant to the rules of rank choice voting, and publish the results on Snapshot for certification. These new signers will be admitted to the Multisig within 24 hours of certification. The next four (4) highest votes will be alternates. In the event a Multisig member steps down, is removed, or otherwise unable to complete their role, they shall be replaced by the alternate with the next most votes from the election (and if they are not available, the second highest voted alternate would be appointed, and so on).\nAll 8 Multisig seats will begin receiving compensation the month after the first four new Multisignators are elected.\nAny tampering is expressly prohibited, including without limitation, Sybil Votes and use of Sybil Wallets. If tampering is discovered, the user(s) will be banned from multisig election voting for 1 year; and will be permanently banned from elected positions at CityDAO, or CityDAO positions with budget authority. Walter will work with current moderators and administrators to enforce these rules, publish ample advance notice of the nominations and election, and any updated rules of the election. Walter will publish a CIP to ratify the election and compensation within 24 hours of the election closing. If the elected are not ratified, this CIP will cease.\nMiscellaneous Terms of CIP-145\nTerm/Date of Completion no later than September 1, 2023 (note – anticipated ASAP but providing this outside date)\nThe Facilitator role for this Election is a non-replaceable role, meaning that the CIP is formally terminated if Walter is not physically able to complete the election. Only a new CIP can establish a different or alternate election procedure.\nAs stated above, the process will be finalized using a ratification CIP. Other CIPs relating to election considerations or compensation for elected Multisig members may follow depending on the nature of the process itself or its outcomes.\nWalter may use the assistance of others as he deems necessary, including the discretion to provide compensation from the Election Comp Pool in his discretion.\nAdjustments and amendments allowed by Proposer or Walter prior to Snapshot, will be tracked, and kept transparent in this Forum page.\nPayment of any amounts hereunder will be made from the Main Treasury within five (5) days of submission of Utopia payment request with reasonable supporting documentation as necessary.\n\n",

      "content": "CityDAO has continued to need basic support and business functions but unfortunately CityDAO did not properly plan for continuation of any responsibilities going into 2023. The need for these roles still exists, and Alex and Josh have continued to function in these roles informally due to their necessity and importance to DAO functioning. These contributors have continued to provide continuation services in their former roles in an unpaid capacity for the month of January 2023 and basic business operations are an ongoing function.\n\nTEAM:\n\nAlex (alexthims) – Bookkeeping & CPA Liaison\nJosh (j0sh I DAOvolution) – Compliance-Related Operations & Outside Counsel Liaison\n\nPROPOSAL:\n\n1. If a quorum of 250 is reached and this CIP is approved, the Team will use its best efforts to undertake the following “Basic” back-office business functions:\n\nThree (3) month term commencing retroactively to January 1, 2023 and ending March 31, 2023\nContinuation of Ongoing Compliance (Legal + Finance) Guild Responsibilities from Q4 2022\nMaintenance of the CityDAO PO Box in Cody, WY (including any related fees if necessary)\nServices provided to CityDAO for basic back-office operation (legal + finance), including but not limited to:\nSole Liaison with outside professional service providers (“PSP’s”)\nBasic bookkeeping record management\nGeneral filings, property taxes, authority and/or signatures for procuring insurance policies (or as otherwise legally required)\nSole Authority to manage the relationships with PSP’s, including any related/reasonable expenditures, with transparent backups supplied.\nCurrent PSP’s include: Lorenzo CPA, Montague Law (EthLaw), Burg Simpson (Parcel 0 and CityDAO agent) and Hathaway & Kunz\nOther PSP’s and software that may be necessary due to evolving nature of projects and DAO operations\nRetroactive compensation for the month of January 2023 - $1,650 USDC to each contributor\nOngoing compensation for February/March 2023 - $1,650 USDC to each contributor\nTotal Team Compensation: $9,900\n\n2. Should this proposal: (i) fail to achieve twenty (20) “likes” on this discourse page, (ii) fail to meet quorum, or (ii) fail to be approved:\n\nShould this CIP-142 not proceed for any reason other than withdrawal or abandonment by its proposers, it will be deemed to be a formal act of governance relieving Alex and Josh of their duties and assumed carry-over responsibilities from Q4 2022. Should this happen, the roles described herein will go unfilled, and the proposers will no longer be responsible for any of the above-mentioned responsibilities or any other responsibilities/duties with respect to the DAO. The proposers will be expressly released from any and all responsibility relating to the performance of these duties henceforth.\n\nMiscellaneous Terms of CIP-142:\n\nAll payments will be made from the Main Treasury: 0x60e7343205C9C88788a22C40030d35f9370d302D\n\nPayments initiated for or from this team will be queued to the Main Treasury using an appropriate method, including without limitation, a Utopia payment link including supporting documentation. The Multisig will execute such payments in a timely fashion, but in any event, no later than five (5) days after submission from the team.\n\nIf for any reason, the project Team must pay for a DAO-related expense, CityDAO will promptly reimburse such team member(s) for these expenses, including any related transaction fees or gas fees. If performance of duties hereunder requires a physical or digital signature, the team members are authorized to make it, and for the avoidance of doubt or ambiguity, the team members are the only people in the DAO who are expressly authorized to do so with respect to accounting or legal professionals on CityDAO’s behalf.\n\nThe project proposers may transition their responsibility to a suitable and adequately qualified CityDAO contributor, subject to CityDAO’s selection and/or approval of said replacement. The team may also resign from responsibility, at any time upon seven (7) days written notice given to CityDAO (in a manner deemed suitable to CityDAO). For the avoidance of ambiguity - This CIP-142 is not a contract for employment or otherwise.\n\nThis CIP-142 may be amended by the proposers at any time prior to Snapshot, subject to compliance with all other material terms contained herein.\n\nPerformance hereunder will be expressly subject to the indemnity rights afforded by the CityDAO Operating Agreement. Additionally, this team will not be liable to CityDAO or to any Citizen, or any other party for that matter, with respect to its performance hereunder, nor for any other types of damages, including without limitation, any incidental, indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages. CityDAO agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold the team harmless from any such claims, liabilities, or damages, including the team’s attorneys fees. Wyoming law governs this CIP and all related considerations. For the avoidance of doubt, these defense, indemnity and hold harmless obligations will extend from CityDAO in favor of the project team for any and all issues that may arise in the future due to a lack of accountability or responsibility-holder in the former roles in the event of #2 above, and this provision is a material term of this CIP-142. (for example, if a service provider sends CityDAO to collection, if services lapse, or if taxes are not paid - this team is EXPRESSLY NOT RESPONSIBLE if the conditions set out in #2 above should occur).

      "content": "# Proposal TLDR\n\n**Lyons800 is posting this proposal on behalf of Lupei and the rest of the community team.**\n\nThis is a proposal to reinstate the Community Team—whose members consist of most of the former Community Guild’s members: Lupei, simplepixellife, and Ming—to manage the communities of CityDAO again, in order to maintain and increase engagement both inside and outside of CityDAO Discord, ensuring a healthy community.\n\n# Why community?\n\nA point of argument which is often brought up is that we currently do not have enough city building experimentation progress to justify the need to put effort in community-building. However, we believe that community-building effort is important in every step of a project of our scale. By constantly building our community, not only can we generate more sales from our citizens NFT, we would also grow our network of human resources and open more doors for collaborations/partnerships that would benefit our city building effort.\n\n## Community Team’s past work in CityDAO:\n\n- The Journey of CityDAO: https://youtu.be/ns88NvDiHLk\n- CityDAO in Numbers: https://youtu.be/mUnHD3U0gTk\n- Dream City artwork: https://discord.com/channels/860356969521217536/861317513166192691/1057312073153003540\n- Korean blogs: https://brunch.co.kr/@38421dc645b2463\n- Turkish Twitter Spaces: https://twitter.com/CityDAO/status/1550541338420006913 (latest)\n- Saturday Game Nights\n- CityDAO Writing Contest (w/Media Guild)\n- Attendance in various irl events (Thai/Turkey/China) under CityDAO’s name\n- Past weekly newspapers: https://www.citydao.io/topic/weekly-news\n- Past Roundup articles: https://city.mirror.xyz/\n- Various translations in local community channels\n- Deleting bots and warding off scammers\n\n## Project Team and Responsibilities\n\nThe team consists of three of the former members of the Community Guild:\n\nLupei\n- Provide Thai translation on important matters\n- Write biweekly newspaper and bimonthly roundups\n- Manage community activities and marketing initiatives\n- Provide monthly reports of the team\n\nSimplepixellife\n- Provide Turkish translation on important matters\n- Organise Turkish CityDAO IRL events\n- Host Twitter Spaces\n- Manage community activities and marketing initiatives\n\nMing\n- Provide Chinese translation on important matters\n- Manage CityDAO WeChat Chinese community\n- Write Chinese CityDAO articles\n- Host Twitter Spaces\n\n## Proposal Budget\n\n- Each member will be compensated $1500 per month for 6 months.\n- The team will receive $6000 budget for community activities/visual content production. Any leftover at the end of 6 months will be returned to CityDAO treasury.\n\nTotal: $33000 (roughly 1.5% of treasury for 6 months of work)\n\nUpon approval, the $6000 activity budget will be transferred to the Community Team’s multisig. Team members will get compensated at the end of each month.\n\n## Timeline and Deliverables\n\nDuration: March to August\n\nAt the end of each month, Lupei will be providing a report on what the team has done for the month. Lupei and simplepixellife will be in charge of utilising the activity budget to organise community activities/producing visual content. We aim to have at least one activity or visual content per month, but those of larger scale may take longer. Most importantly, we will make sure that our activities and visual content are aligned with CityDAO’s missions and values.\n\nWhat to expect:\n- Weekly Newspaper\n- Roundups\n- Visual content (videos/artworks)\n- Casual Discord activities\n- Discord/Community Management\n- Blogs & articles in local languages\n- Twitter Spaces\n- Contests\n- IRL events\n- Translations\n- etc.\n\n## Risks\n\nThere may be legal issues with community activities that include “giveaways” of financial assets such as prizes for community contests, which could negatively affect CityDAO LLC. However, this issue can easily be averted. All activities that would contain giveaways will be consulted with the legal team first to make sure that there will be no legal problems.\n\n## Regulatory\n\nThere is no regulatory issue.",

      "title": " CIP-143: DAO Coalition Representative",
      "content": "TLDR\n\nThis is a non-financial proposal to make David (Da3vid#1983) the official DAO Coalition representative from CityDAO. There is no budget and no payment. The responsibilities would be to attend DAO Coalition calls and report back to CityDAO. When decisions are required, David will take direction from CityDAO. \n\nThe DAO Coalition is a group of approximately 30 DAOs and supporting organizations that seek to advocate on behalf of DAOs in the United States and globally. This coalition was started by Stuttgart on behalf of CityDAO, and therefore CityDAO has a significant place in the coalition. Each member of the coalition has been asked to formally select a representative. David  has been the unofficial representative to the DAO Coalition since its inception. \n\nCoalition Team\n\nThe DAO Coalition currently consists of 3OH DAO, Alliance DAO, ATX DAO, Aragon DAO, Bankless DAO, City3, CityDAO, Cohere, Data Union DAO, enDAOment, Governor DAO, Impact DAO, JournoDAO, Kali DAO, Klaytn, Krause House, KYC DAO, LegalDAO, LexDAO, Lobby3, Nemus, OtoCo DAO, PAC DAO, Polygon DAO, R3WIND DAO, Sapien Network, Sporos DAO, SuperRare DAO, SSV DAO and Standard DAO. Supporting organizations within the DAO Coalition include the Blockchain Association, COALA, NEAR, the DAO Research Collective, and the World Economic Fund.\n\nDetails\n\nDAOs are confronted with an uncertain legal landscape with pitfalls and obstacles. Our presence as a leader in lobbying efforts keeps CityDAO in an important position in the space. Working hand in hand with organizations like Bankless, Aragon, Polygon, the Blockchain Association, NEAR and the World Economic Fund helps us engage with the larger community.\n\nThe DAO Coalition has been holding monthly conference calls since its informal inception in summer, 2022. Stuttgart has helped to establish the DAO Coalition, but would transition his role to represent the DAO Coalition in DC as a lobbyist. Each DAO needs a representative, however, and David has been the unofficial representative of CityDAO since the inception of the coalition.\n\nResponsibilities of the Representative\n\nThe official representative has the responsibility to attend DAO Coalition calls and report back to CityDAO on the proceedings. When decisions are required, the representative will bring them to CityDAO and take direction from CityDAO on how to represent CityDAO to the coalition. This position is not paid.\n\nProposal Budget\n\nZero.\n\nTimeline and Deliverables\n\nThe DAO Coalition has formed a 501(c)(4) nonprofit entity and continues to engage important DAOs in the space for collective lobbying efforts. There are no specific timelines or deliverables at this time.\n\nRisks\n\nThere is a risk whenever anyone makes representations to the public. However, Da3vid would make no public statements. All communications would occur within the DAO Coalition.",

For his role in planning, we propose a $2k reward. Responsibilities include choosing locations, doing logistics like car rentals and airbnb bookings, and responsibly allocating funds to maximize value and fairness for Citizens. If for any reason Memebrains cannot continue in the role, scottfits shall appoint a new Planning lead.\n\nBudget\n\nTotal proposal requests $32k, $30k to go towards trip logistics, $2k to go to Memebrains upon successful completion and return from ETHDenver. The likely outcome is that things that many Citizens can benefit from (dinners, rental cars, an airbnb) can be subsidized, while individuals may still have to pay travel expenses.",

      "title": " CIP 129 - Grant for a Startup to create a Harberger Tax Inspired NFT Protocol & Marketplace",
      "content": "**Proposal:** Provide a Grant for a Startup to create a Harberger Tax Inspired NFT Protocol & Marketplace\n\n**Amount:** $250,000 USDC, spread out over 4 progress milestones (see below)\n\n**To Who:** @MemeBrains & @TheBossDragon\n\n**Intended outcome:**\n\n1. Resolve 3 of the primary pain points affecting the DAO and Gated Access Community ecosystem as a whole\n2. Replenish the CityDAO treasury\n3. Save developer costs from other CityDAO projects which need a Harberger Tax model as well\n\n**Prologue:**\n\nHello CityDAO!\n\nThis is my first proposal ever since proposing the CityDAO Podcast almost a year ago. Working with, supporting and advocating for CityDAO has been one of the most fulfilling experiences I’ve received in the Crypto world. This proposal takes things to a whole new level.\n\nIn 2018 I sold my last company in part because I felt the unshakable calling to plunge down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. Opportunities like this come once in a lifetime so I decided to go all-in and it’s been one of the most fulfilling decisions of my entire life. This journey led me to discover CityDAO and the principles of the Network State where I felt an equally strong calling to become involved. I believe that what Bitcoin is doing for global economics, the Network State is doing for global politics.\n\nBut everywhere I look, DAOs, NFT communities and nearly every single Gated Access Community I’ve come across run into the same 3 problems: Squatters, Flippers & Depleting Treasury.\n\n**Squatters** hold those community keys (NFTs, Tokens etc) but do not participate. This artificially inflates the price of those community keys/NFTs in the open market -such as on Opensea- while simultaneously lowering productivity for everyone involved. Squatters are usually well intended however the inactivity hurts the community.\n\n**Flippers** hold those community keys for future resale purposes and also do not participate, further inflating the community key prices and lowering community productivity. Flippers are also usually well intended however the hoarding and inflated floor pricing it creats hurts the community too.\n\n**Depleting Treasury** is like a ticking time bomb. Every startups nightmare…limited Runway threatens the end of any capital intensive initiative.\n\nThrough CityDAO I’ve discovered the principles of Harberger Taxes. At least 2 CityDAO projects that I know of have mentioned a desire to implement Harberger Taxes in their projects, yet no fully functional solution currently exists in the market to click the proverbial ‘on switch’ to try it out. Tweets and articles by notable people and thought leaders also demonstrate interest in bringing this idea to market.\n\nWithin the principles of Harberger Taxes, I along with many others I’ve spoken with see the seeds to solving all 3 of these major industry pain points with one single solution.\n\nThis proposal is to find out in an indisputable way if a Harberger Tax Marketplace for Gated Access Community Keys and Digital Land Ownership will indeed help change the world of online communities for the better, as we think it will.\n\n\n**Project Team:**\n\n**Eric Gilbert-Williams - CEO**\n\nEric is a lifelong entrepreneur across multiple industries. He bootstrapped his last company to a team size of 50+ people and several million in ARR then sold it in 2018. He has also been involved in event production, angel investing and startup consulting. He is the host of the CityDAO podcast, an active DAO enthusiast + contributor and is also the host of a Philanthropically motivated Mental Health Podcast. Eric brings experience in organizational leadership, stakeholder relationship building, B2B + B2C sales, team trainings and public speaking.\n\n\n**Bhargav Patel - CTO**\n\nBhargav is a serial entrepreneur in the technology space. In 2011, he founded Performance IQ, a data analytics and gamification software company for boutique fitness clubs. He grew the company to 3000+ locations & 20M+ users, prior to getting acquired by Battery Ventures in 2018. Since then, he has been involved with multiple ventures in retail, manufacturing, software & web3 space. He is an avid crypto investor, an early CityDAO citizen, and brings a ton of web3 development experience in smart contracts, NFTs & Defi protocols.\n\n**Budget:** $250,000 USDC over 4 milestones (see below)\n\n**Summary:** Launch a Harberger Tax Inspired NFT Protocol & Marketplace for CityDAO and other gated access communities to benefit from. This will allow communities to add customized functions and utility to their NFTs based on the specific needs and goals of their community. This project will develop the protocol MVP along with accompanying marketplace. Communities will be able to mint, distribute, manage and buy/sell their customized NFTs. Communities who select taxation features in their NFT will have those taxes sent directly to replenish their treasuries.\n\n**Pitch Deck PDF** with Project Overview here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_bmjqVkI4CnChvkv6_vkdAyu8Xe8uQjd/view?usp=sharing\n\n**Pitch Deck Video** Walkthrough here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obYXxQv2r0Q\n\n**Use of Funds:**\n\n1. Launch on mainnet & gain sufficient market traction to raise a $2M+ Seed round from Angels/VCs in 2023/24\n2. Core team wages & contractor payments\n3. Software & server costs\n\n\n**Benefits to CityDAO:**\n\n1. **$1 million in Royalties for CityDAO Treasury Replenishment:**\n**a)** As a separate agreement from the Grant, the venture proposed above would engage with CityDAO in an Incubation and Marketing agreement. The agreement would state that should the venture succeed in generating revenues then the CityDAO Treasury would be provided with a 20% royalty from those top line revenues until $250,000 has been sent to the CityDAO Treasury, and then a further 5% royalty for an additional $750,000 USD, equalling a combined total of $1 million USD or equivalent back to the CityDAO treasury.\n**b)** In exchange for giving this royalty to CityDAO, the venture will be formally supported by CityDAO for testing, marketing, feedback, discussions early distribution and be the ventures first live customer, establishing a true win-win environment for both parties.\n\n2. **Saved Costs:**\nOther CityDAO projects which require a functioning Harberger Tax inspired NFT protocol and marketplace would be able to leverage from this technology and no longer be required to develop it from scratch. This would save development costs on other CityDAO projects and initiatives.\n\n3. **Momentum for Treasury Replenishment initiatives:**\nThis would be the first active project within the CityDAO ecosystem to have an agreement in place geared towards treasury replenishment. This will hopefully inspire others to create projects and agreements which would also replenish the CityDAO treasury.\n\n4. **Branding & Market Presence**\nThis project would provide credit back to CityDAO on-going in various forms including the CityDAO logo, ‘CityDAO Incubated Project’ references, public facing credit towards the CityDAO community in media events, and more. People will know this project was inspired and supported first and foremost by CityDAO to continue building the CityDAO brand.\n\n**Timeline and Deliverables:**\n\nTo demonstrate our commitment and determination for this project, we have broken the project down into 4 milestones. Upon approval of this proposal, $250,000 USDC will be transferred to a gnosis based escrow wallet. Funding will be opened on a per milestone basis starting with the first milestone funding being released and used to complete the first milestones deliverables. Upon completion of the first milestone deliverables, funds will be unlocked then used from the second milestone to complete the second milestone deliverables, and so on.\n\n**Milestone 1**\n\n**Budget:**  $1\n\n**Deliverables:**\n* Project Discovery & Networking\n* 5+ DAO/Community Leader 1-on-1 interviews for feature development input & prioritization\n* Setup web survey for larger scale interviews with DAO/Community participants\n\n**Milestone 2**\n\n**Budget:**  $19,999\n\n**Deliverables:**\n* Completion of 30+ DAO/Community Leader 1-on-1 interviews for feature development input & prioritization.\n* Flow Charts based on market feedback from the interviews & surveys\n* Initial Branding / Creatives for the platform\n* Initial UI/UX Designs\n\n**Milestone 3**\n\n**Budget:** $50,000\n\n**Deliverables:**\n* MVP live on ETH/Polygon Testnet\n* Alpha Testing & Feedback Gathering\n* Generate interest from other communities\n\n**Milestone 4**\n\n**Budget:**  $180,000\n\n**Deliverables:**\n* Audited smart contracts by a third party\n* Live and operational product launch on ETH/Polygon Mainnet\n* Commencement of the Royalty on top line marketplace revenue back to CityDAO\n\n**Challenges & Questions:**\n\n1. **Will it work?**\nIt’s clear that between the Radical Markets book, the RadicalxChange foundation, tweets by Vitalik, Balaji and within other discussion forms, there is a sincere curiosity and belief by influential parties that a Harberger Tax model could revolutionize property ownership, memberships, NFTs and gated access communities everywhere. We can debate the theory until the cows come home…but there’s only one way to actually find out. This project aims to find out.\n\n2. **That’s not enough money to scale**\nCorrect, it’s not. But with this pre-seed funding and a live MVP, we will be able to confidently approach a Seed round in 2023 aiming for the $2mil - $5mil range with the appropriate Angel Investors & VCs. The Seed round will provide the hires needed to bring this product to market and gain the initial traction required to then approach a Series A round in the $20mil - $30mil range for market scalability.\n\n3. **That’s too much money!**\nPlease read #2 above.\n\n4. **I think Harberger Taxes will fail.**\nPlease read #1 above.\n\n5. **Why not do this inside CityDAO as a CityDAO fully owned project?**\n**a)** CityDAO does not have enough money to do this as a broad market solution in a long-term scalable way. It would simply be too risky for the treasury and bootstrapping this would require too much commitment from DAO members, distract from core CityDAO initiatives and severely limit this initiative's chances of success.\n**b)** This is a startup venture concept which is intended to live and grow on its own. Although connected to the same root system as CityDAO overall and connected with multipl CityDAO projects, this is an offspring of CityDAO, not part of the main/original tree.\n**c)** Lastly, legal liability is mitigated when this project is separated from the CityDAO LLC and visa versa.\n\n6. **How does this replenish the CityDAO Treasury?**\nPlease read ‘Benefits to CityDAO’ above.\n\n7. **Let’s debate, discuss and theorize about this for a year++ before deciding**\nNot an option for us. We have a window of opportunity here that will not remain open long. Either we do this or we don’t.\n\n8. **The Mob.**\nLook, our intentions here are to do something good, not only CityDAO, but for the market as a whole, and simultaneously help our entrepreneurial career. We really don’t want this to turn into something unpleasant for anyone involved. We are hoping CityDAO can rally around this project as a very positive thing.\n\n9. **I have more questions plz**\nWe will be hosting a daily AMA on this Proposal at 2pm PST on Thursday and Friday November 9th and 10th and daily from Monday November 14th until Friday November 18th. Come join and ask all your questions!\n\n10. **Is this Legal?**\nEverything within this proposal will be first passed through CityDAO legal council and any required changes will be made accordingly before finalized.\n\n**Legal Notice & Disclaimer: The entirety of the above proposal and any and all of its details, including but not limited to pitch deck and related details must be reviewed by and modified by CityDAO legal council and/or other legal council related to the venture or any of its stakeholders.**\n",

      "title": "DAO Coalition Funding",
      "content": "TLDR\n\nThe DAO Coalition is a group of approximately 30 DAOs and supporting organizations that seek to advocate on behalf of DAOs in the United States and globally. This coalition was started by Stuttgart on behalf of CityDAO, and therefore CityDAO has a significant place in the coalition. This CIP requests $9,999 as part of a fundraising effort among other DAOs in the coalition. The purpose of the fundraising is to provide funding to formalize the coalition as it relates to legal fees (incorporation, creation of bylaws) and website creation. Benefits to CityDAO would be a leadership role with the DAO Coalition as it advocates in Washington, D.C.\n\nPROJECT TEAM\n\nThe DAO Coalition currently consists of 3OH DAO, Alliance DAO, ATX DAO, Aragon DAO, Bankless DAO, City3, CityDAO, Cohere, Data Union DAO, enDAOment, Governor DAO, Impact DAO, JournoDAO, Kali DAO, Klaytn, Krause House, KYC DAO, LegalDAO, LexDAO, Lobby3, Nemus, OtoCo DAO, PAC DAO, Polygon DAO, R3WIND DAO, Sapien Network, Sporos DAO, SuperRare DAO, SSV DAO and Standard DAO.\n\nSupporting organizations within the DAO Coalition include the Blockchain Association, COALA, NEAR, the DAO Research Collective, and the World Economic Fund.\n\nDETAILS\n\nCityDAO has been leading an effort to establish a DAO Coalition for the purposes of advocating on behalf of CityDAO and all DAOs. DAOs face both risks and opportunities. It is critical that DAOs come together to speak with one voice on issues that impact the sector.\n\nAs it relates to risks, as a result of our relationship with the Blockchain Association, earlier this year we were made aware of interests in Washington, D.C., such as the Crowdfunding Professional Association, which have been advocating to the SEC with appeals that are directly averse to the existence of DAOs. More recently, we’ve seen the CFTC sue Ooki DAO on allegations that, as an unincorporated association, it violated federal laws.\n\nAs far as opportunities, this summer, Senators Gillibrand and Lummis introduced S. 4356, the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act, which, if enacted, would, for the first time, provide a federal framework for DAOs. This legislation would provide an opportunity for the DAO Coalition, on behalf of CityDAO and all DAOs, to provide a positive narrative to policymakers about the promise of DAOs.\n\nIt is in light of the aforementioned risks and opportunities that the DAO Coalition has been holding monthly conference calls since its informal inception this summer. DAOs are being formed every day and, according to DeepDAO, there are almost 5,000 DAOs in existence to date. The DAO Coalition aims to harness that collective voice, but requires a small contribution from representative DAOs to begin its operations. To this end, the DAO Coalition is requesting a contribution to assist with the coalition’s formal establishment.\n\nOther DAO representatives also are asking their respective DAOs for contributions and Lobby3 has secured its own $10,000 commitment. CityDAO’s $9,999 contribution would help ensure that CityDAO would play a leadership role as the DAO Coalition is formed.\n\nScottfits and Stuttgart currently are listed as CityDAO representatives within the DAO Coalition and this proposal would aim to have them represent CityDAO as Directors of the formal DAO Coalition. None of the CityDAO $10,000 contribution would go to Scott or Stuttgart. In the event that Scottfits is not available, David will take his role as CityDAO representative.\n\nPROPOSAL BUDGET\n\nThis proposal requests a one-time disbursement of $9,999 in USDC to the DAO Coalition treasury. Other DAOs also have been asked and may contribute money to this fund.\n\nTIMELINE AND DELIVERABLES\n\nOnce the DAO Coalition has secured the necessary funding, the coalition would aim to take the necessary steps to formalize in Q4 2022 or Q1 2023.\n\nRISKS\n\nThere is little risk to CityDAO from this contribution other than the coalition not being able to raise the sufficient amount of funds to formalize and we believe that given the number of other DAOs in the coalition we should be able to raise these funds. If the coalition is unsuccessful in raising necessary funding, the coalition would reimburse CityDAO.\n\nREGULATORY\n\nThe project would create a new legal entity outside of CityDAO, but would not create a new tax burden for CityDAO. Should CityDAO also wish to provide a small sustaining contribution for ongoing activities after the DAO Coalition has been established, a separate CIP would be requested. Given the number of DAOs already in the coalition, we would not anticipate that a request to DAO Coalition members for such sustaining funding would be more than $10,000 per year, per coalition member.\n\nBENEFITS TO CITYDAO\n\nThe first and most obvious benefit to CityDAO is the preservation of its existence. While CityDAO operates entirely within the law as an LLC, we are confronted with an uncertain legal landscape with pitfalls and obstacles. CityDAO seeks not only to exist but to collaborate with other DAOs and create IRL spaces for other DAOs to flourish. To that end, our presence as a leader in lobbying efforts keeps CityDAO in an important position in the DAO space.\n\nAnother key benefit comes from the collaborations and relationships with other DAOs that such a presence will foster. Working hand in hand with organizations like Bankless, Aragon, Polygon, the Blockchain Association, NEAR and the World Economic Fund has benefits that cannot be adequately measured in dollars or in the short term. For the $10K contribution this CIP seeks, it could benefit CityDAO immeasurably.\n\nA third benefit is the engagement with larger communities and increased awareness of CityDAO. Having our name associated with so many other DAOs, each of them with many thousands of members, all of whom are committed to the web3 and DAO space, being in a leadership position within the DAO Coalition could serve as wonderful, perpetual marketing.",

      "title": "t0wn",
      "content": "TL/DR: The Big Parcel Project will be rebranded as t0wn. Instead of buying thousands of acres and selling thousands of tokens to individuals to try to build a vast “city,” we will target only high-level DAOs (20-30) to sell high-priced tokens in order to create a “t0wn” governed entirely by DAOs rather than individuals. Think NATO, or UN, or Davos for DAOs. If CityDAO creates it, we will have a seat at the table, prestige, and governance in the new world order. \n\nThe project is in 3 stages, as is the budget, which serves to compensate the team, to hire people as needed, and pay for devs to create the token if we get to that point. The land to be purchased is not specifically designated at this stage of the process, and may range from a building in a distressed city or university campus to an exquisite lodge in a lush wooded area (see deck, linked below, for more details).\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nCityDAO will lay the foundation for the first ever town governed by a group of DAOs. After identifying and securing an appropriate property, CityDAO will create a low-supply, high cost token which will be purchased by a hand-selected group of DAOs in order to fund the acquisition of the property. These DAOs will become the founding members of t0wn, with CityDAO as its “founder.”\n\nHere is a deck that more completely and visually articulates our ambition: https://pitch.com/public/4a22922a-a2bc-4855-8a5b-1338e4a4432f\n\nt0wn will be carried out in three consecutive stages: (1) R&D, (2) Development, and (3) Execution. All stages will be executed entirely by the t0wn Team (defined below).\n\nSTAGE ONE (R&D) DETAILS\n\nIn Stage One, the t0wn team will: Identify viable properties; Call agents representing viable properties to understand parameters, timing of sales, etc; Host Twitter spaces to promote the t0wn project, generate interest from other DAOs and web3 orgs, and get feedback; Talk to DAO leaders one-on-one and get LOIs / commitments to be inaugural t0wn members; Consult with state and local officials in areas where we have identified viable properties; Begin to sort out legal implications of DAOs co-owning a property\n\nSTAGE ONE - TENTATIVE TIMELINE\n\nWEEKS: ACTION\n1 - 4: Identify viable properties\n2 - 6: Call real estate agents for viable properties to understand parameters, timing of sale, etc\n3 - 7: Host Twitter spaces to promote the t0wn project, get other DAOs interested, and get feedback\n4 - 8: Talk to DAO leaders one-on-one and get LOIs / commitments to be inaugural t0wn members\n4 - 8: Start to sort out legal implications of DAOs co-owning a property\n\nSTAGE ONE BUDGET\n\nFor stage one of this project (R&D), $58,000 USDC will be transferred to the Big Parcel multisig (to be rebranded as \"t0wn multisig\") immediately upon the passing of this CIP. This money will be allocated as follows:\n\nTeam compensation: $32,000 USDC (based on 8 weeks, 10 hrs/wk at $100 p/h x 4).\nDiscretionary expense budget: $20,000 USDC (to be added to what’s already in the Big Parcel multisig) for marketing, legal, etc.\nIf certain conditions are met (see below), stage two (Development) will be triggered.\n\nTRIGGER FOR STAGE TWO\n\nTen DAOs signing LOIs (Letters of Intent) stating their intention to become founding members of t0wn at a token price of greater than or equal to $75k will automatically trigger Stage Two, and its budget will be sent immediately to the Big Parcel/t0wn multisig. This trigger can also be met by any number of DAOs that commit via LOI a total of not less than $750,000.\n\nIf more time and/or funding is needed in Stage One to acquire the LOIs, the t0wn team may use funds from the discretionary fund to pay for up to four more weeks of work (including team comp) at the same rate as above. For clarity, should the Stage One tasks take longer than 12 weeks to complete, the team will receive no further compensation until/unless the project enters Stage Two.\n\nIf the t0wn Team wishes to proceed to Stage Two with a total financial commitment lower than $750k, this will be subject to the passing of a separate CIP.\n\nSTAGE TWO (DEVELOPMENT) DETAILS\n\nIn Stage Two, the t0wn team will: Manage token design and legal contract development; Continue to host Twitter Spaces and get LOIs from additional DAOs, with the intent of including 20-30 founding orgs; Keep tabs on all viable properties, set up legal entities and put all the logistical pieces in place so as soon as the project is funded, the property purchase can take place immediately.\n\nSTAGE TWO - TENTATIVE TIMELINE\n\nWEEKS: ACTION\n1 - 4: Select and engage token team\n1 - 4: Select and engage legal counsel to draft applicable contracts\n4 - 8: Manage token team\n4 - 8: Manage legal counsel\n1 - 8: Call real estate agents for viable properties to understand parameters, timing of sale, etc\n1 - 8: Continue to host Twitter spaces to promote the t0wn project, get other DAOs interested, and get feedback\n1 - 8: Continue to talk to DAO leaders one-on-one and get LOIs / commitments to be inaugural t0wn members\n\nSTAGE TWO BUDGET\n\nIf the Stage Two trigger is met, an additional $102,000 USDC will be transferred to the Big Parcel multisig immediately. This money will be allocated as follows:\n\n$25k for Dev and PM time, token design\n$25k for legal fees\n$32k team compensation (same rate as above, for 8 more weeks)\n$20k discretionary fund (in addition to whatever is already in the safe)\n\nSTAGE THREE (EXECUTION) DETAILS\n\nIn Stage Three, the t0wn team will: Distribute the token to the founding member DAOs; funds go to the Big Parcel multisig; t0wn team will use the funds to buy the property; t0wn begins!\n\nSTAGE THREE BUDGET\n\nTBD - It is too early to determine the appropriate budget for the Execution stage; therefore, the t0wn team will post a separate CIP for funding when the time comes.\n\nBENEFIT TO CITYDAO AND ITS CITIZENS\n\nIf t0wn is a success, CityDAO citizens stand to benefit considerably, in a number of ways: \n\nMembership Tokens: In return for funding the genesis of t0wn (i.e. Stages One and Two, $160k upfront spend) CityDAO will get either: Three (3) membership tokens, or a membership stake valued at $225k, whichever is greater.\n\nGovernance: CityDAO also gets the governance benefit of holding more membership tokens, which is likely to be the most powerful position in the collective unless another DAO opts to buy more than one membership token.\n\nCitizen Memberships: CityDAO Citizens will enjoy all the benefits of membership in t0wn, in many cases at a greater rate/quantity due to CityDAO’s larger membership stake in t0wn.\n\nBrand / Prestige: CityDAO will be branded / marketed as the “founder” of t0wn, while the initial member DAOs will be “founding members.”\n\nt0wn TEAM\n\nDa3vid: Vision and Legal\nDavid is an attorney licensed in New York since 2005, has a Masters and is now studying for his Ph.D. in Sociology related to DAOs and the metaverse. He has been teaching business law, management and organizational behavior at an international university for 15 years. He also ran the two largest improvisational theater companies in China for a decade (one in English, one in Chinese) with valuations in the millions of USD while also creating and running his own highly successful theater company, all in Chinese. \n\nDavid was on the CityDAO Council, helped to write the Charter and Operating Agreement, facilitated the Legal Guild, served on the first Mission Guild and is currently the facilitator of the Education & Research Guild, which he also founded.\n\nGugz: Vision and Project Management\nGugz has been producing film and television, everything from shorts and music videos to feature documentaries and big-budget TV, for more than a decade. He has taken dozens of projects from zero to scale. He helped start a management company a decade ago as its first employee and has developed ideas into global films and series. In one instance, he was part of a team of four producers who created an entirely independent, $70 million season of television, for which they built a TV studio from scratch, all in the name of creator ownership (THE FIRST, starring Sean Penn, on Hulu).\n\nGugz has served in various leadership positions at CityDAO over the past year, including writing its charter with a team of collaborators and founding its grants program. He is co-founder of R3WIND (formerly BlockbusterDAO), a decentralized media organization.\n\nTasafila: Marketing and Design\nTasafila has worked as a creative and growth strategist in B2B Tech, E-Commerce and Web3; building campaigns, LMS systems and go-to-market strategies for major brands such as IBM, Oracle, Reef, Whirlpool, Therabody, and more. He launched his self-funded vegan grocery startup in 2020 and shipped nationwide. He pulled interest from Shark Tank and an activation with American Airlines before exiting in 2021.\n\nIn early 2022, Tasafila launched BlockbusterDAO which garnered global media attention and formed one of the largest web3 grassroots communities in the world, without ever spending a dime on advertising or marketing.\n\nScottA: DAO Partnerships and Economics\nScott has worked for the government developing programs to end homelessness and alleviate poverty (Housing First Edmonton). He has taught university classes at the undergraduate and graduate levels in economics. He has a strong background in data analysis and various programming languages, such as R. He also has a background in music; he wrote and produced two full-length albums under the band “Making a Monster.”\n\nIn 2022, Scott completed a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Alberta with a focus on economic growth. He graduated with top marks and is set to publish two journal articles in reputable publications (Journal of Economic History and the Journal of Institutional Economics). He has taken an active role in CityDAO and organized successful initiatives such as the CityDAO Conference and Journal.\n\nMULTISIG\nFunds will be sent to the current Big Parcel multisig. Tasafila and ScottA will be added as signers, with Blackacres remaining on as an independent overseer, to make it a 3/5 multisig.\n\nFINE PRINT\nIn the spirit of fostering a more autonomous and project-based culture at CityDAO, the following will be effective immediately upon the passing of this CIP:\n\nUtilization of CityDAO Members: The t0wn project may opt to, but will in no way be obligated to, utilize any personnel or individuals employed by, receiving funds from or in any way affiliated with CityDAO. The decision of whom to work rests entirely upon the judgment of the t0wn Team.\n\nProcess of Work: Such that any CityDAO executive body, committee, guild or team is in place at the time this CIP passes (ex. the Planning Guild), this project will not be subject to its authority.\n\nSeparation of Authority: t0wn will be set in motion by the t0wn team on behalf of CityDAO, but the project, such that it exists, will ultimately be owned and governed by its member DAOs. The t0wn project will create its own operating agreement and will not be bound by the CityDAO operating agreement. t0wn may utilize any legal structure that is suitable, including but not limited to an LLC, non-profit, trust, UNA, etc. \n\nAccess to Twitter, Discord and Social Media: This project requires the use of the CityDAO Twitter and Discord accounts. If this CIP passes, the t0wn team will have the ability to post on the CityDAO Twitter, host Twitter Spaces, etc.\nWeb3 Funding: While the focus will be on DAOs, we will also consider funding from Web3 organizations that are not technically DAOs, for example, the Ethereum foundation. \n\n",

      "content": "# DAOLabs\nDAO Labs will be an innovation hub for aspiring and current Web3 enthusiasts, developers, engineers, designers and community members.\n\nCo-working spaces such as WeWork are expensive and adopt a corporate and formal culture, one that struggles to embrace and encourage innovation and creative thinking.\n\nDAOLabs aims to provide these creators and innovators with a new type of working model that seeks to be engaging, and fair and promotes building and innovation.\n\nDAOLabs does this in a number of ways;\n\n## The Launch\nThe launch of DAOLabs Denver will provide citizens with free access to the DAOLabs for the first 90 days of Launch. During this time, the DAOLabs team aims to finalise the development of the Partial Common Ownership business model and the future development of the project.\n\n## Future Benefits\n* Off-Peak free access to Citizens\n* xx hours worth of free access passes per month (To be determined)\n* Priority Booking during on-peak hours\n\n## Locations\nDAOLabs proposes Denver, Colorado as the initial location. This is due to a number of factors such as:\n\n* Reasonable lease prices: Lease prices in Denver are better valued than in some other researched states such as NY, TX, FL, CA, Etc\n* Denver’s Tech Community: Denver is known for its bustling tech and startup community.\n* ETHDenver: This is one of the largest crypto events and having a location where we can facilitate a space for people to build throughout the event, but also gain publicity through the event.\n* Central Location: Denver, CO is quite a central location to other states in the USA.\n* Denver is extremely close to both Parcel 0 and Parcel Blanca and can act as a hub/lab between the two.\n\n### Future Locations\nPending the success of DAOLabs Denver, DAOLabs aims to open a number of similar spaces to be used by citizens around the globe.\n\n## Upgrades\nDAOLabs aims to be community driven. Certain amounts of capital can be allocated by the community to upgrade the locations for their benefit and at their specification.\n\n## QV Funding\nDAOLabs will utilise QV Funding models to fund projects within the locations. The goal of this is to fund startups and projects in the DAOLabs space in a fair and efficient manner.\n\n## Sponsorship\nMembers of DAOLabs can earn sponsorship for themselves and their teams. This is done through our sponsors and aims to provide top projects and individuals with the opportunity to bootstrap their development.\n\n## Partial Common Ownership -Desk Lease\nPartial Common ownership (PCO) is a new form of ownership and of managing assets that is fairer and more efficient than those under capitalism or communism.\n\nIn PCO or Plural Property assets belong to no one and everyone. An asset’s current possessor must self-assess and declare its value. Based on the self-assessed value, they pay a fee, which can be used to fund public goods, or distributed as a social dividend. If somebody bids more for that asset, current possessors sell it for their self-assessed value, resulting in more benefits for the public.\n\nDAOLabs Inherits Mechanisms from PCO and Plural Property to create a unique ownership model for our builder Space.\n\nUsers of the space will have the ability to view all of the desks available each day.\n\nDesks may utilise a lease structure incorporating PCO to obtain the maximum economic benefit from each desk and location allowing DAOLabs to grow at an optimal rate.\n\n## Requirements\nCIP-111 proposes the following:\n\n* Full support from CityDAO for media assistance and coordination\n\n* $162,500 to cover the lease of the property for 1 year.\n\n* $47,500 to cover any other incurred expenses\n*Incurred expenses include design & development budget, travel costs, insurance, maintenance etc.\n\n* $20,000 Compensation to the team for execution and setup of the space\n\n## Timeframe\n1. Snapshot Completion Date: 22th October 2022\n\n2. Lease engagement: 23rd October - 23rd November 2022\n\n3. Lease Start Date: 23rd November 2022\n\n4. DAOLabs Opening: 24th November 2022\n\n5. DAOLabs Business Model and Software Refinement: 24th February 2023\n\n## Deliverables\nMilestone 1: Snapshot Completion\n\nMilestone 2: Space Lease and Organisation\n\nMilestone 3: Partners Onboarding\n\nMilestone 4: Space Launch and Citizen Introduction\n\n## Goals\nCIP-111 aims to deliver the following to CityDAO Community:\n\n* Business Opportunity\n* Space for citizens\n* Space to try real-life experiments\n\n## Partnership Opportunities\nDAOLabs will aim to establish partnerships with the following entities in technology and Web3.\n* Venture Capitalist Firms: To provide support and assistance to sponsor projects in DAOLabs\n* Technology Groups: To advance the adoption of web3 into web2 through DAOLabs projects\n* Major Blockchain Protocols: To provide support and assistance to sponsor projects in DAOLabs.\n\n## Team\n1. Oisin Lyons (Lyons800) - Lead on Space\n2. Konrad - Operations Assist\n3. Josh - Real estate\n4. A fourth Member may be brought on to assist\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Pass Snapshot Proposal\n2. Create CIP-111 Team Multi-sig with the member proposed\n3. Send $230,000 from the main treasury to the multisig\n4. Off-ramp funds if necessary for proof of funding requirements on lease.\n \n\n    ",

      "title": "CIP-124 Q4 Funding",
      "content": "SIMPLE SUMMARY\n\nQ4 is fast approaching and no budget or mechanism allocated to pay contributors during that period exists. Q3 included a lot of restructuring and clarity was gained via an approved vote a short 7 weeks ago (July 24). Planning Guild is working on Charter amendments to address future structure and budgets, but until those are in place and approved by the DAO, we risk some level of disorder on October 1st. Extending the Q3 Funding period, with some alterations below, appears to be a simple strategy to keep core functions and Guild projects ongoing, while limiting the amount of confusion associated with a more complex structure and budget for Q4.\n\nSPECIFICATION\n\nExtend the funding period included in the passed CIP-69 Q3 Guild Structure and Budget 6 to include the period from October 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 with the following alterations:\n\n1. Facilitators will continue to work in their current positions, unless they’ve stepped down from a role.\n2. The Planning and Operations Guild shall:\n        - Maintain operations functions related to communication channels.\n        - Revise and implement improved Charter and processes, with specific focus on clarifying and automating governance structures. The Charter should be posted and easily navigable once complete and approved by the DAO.\n        - Make efforts visible to the community, provide regular status updates and shall hold a weekly call.\n3. Discontinue the use of NFTs as Facilitator compensation.\n4. Guild Safes will utilize unused USDC and NFTs from Q3 for Q4 operational costs.\n5. USDC and NFT’s remaining in Guild Safes on January 1, 2023 will be used to credit Q1 2023 funding budgets for each guild, if any is proposed.\n6.

These parcels will be available for citizens to lease and use. One may be kept for CityDAO collectively as a town square.\n\n## Why this proposal?\nThis is technically an allowed action already under governance, but is a less traditional use of the funds. We wanted to check with the DAO. \n\n- A YES vote asks planning to use leftover funds to buy more baby parcels\n- a NO vote will ask the planning guild to return the funds to the main treasury\n\n",

      "title": " CIP-112: Parcel Zero Autonomization",
      "content": "Parcel Zero is CityDAO’s largest and most significant effort to date. It is a Wyoming DAO’s first land purchase. The NFT project was a monumental step towards putting land on chain. Of all our existing guilds/efforts/projects/etc. this is the only other one that has a separate NFT which controls access/governance/etc… Parcel Zero is our only project that has a separate entity which holds the land and through which Parcel Zero NFT holders interact, and “Parcel Zero, LLC” merits an arms length relationship.\n\nThe possibilities for Parcel Zero have not been fully realized. While there are significant limitations for what can be done with the land, there remains a great deal of potential within the related Parcel Zero effort. Which direction we go needs to be determined by Parcel Zero NFT holders through the governance granted to them. However, very little is possible with no funding available. Additionally, we have known expenses which will exist, and past expenses which have yet to be paid.\n\nTaking all of this into consideration, it is important that we recognize the Parcel Zero effort for the significance that it holds, and grant Parcel Zero NFT holders enough autonomy and funding to govern meaningfully. Without this a not insignificant amount of energy will be consumed making small asks along the way, and it will be that much more difficult to fully realize the value of holding a Parcel Zero NFT. This proposal provides a baseline foundation intended to prevent the project from languishing and maintain the current momentum.\n\nFUNDING\nThis CIP requests $73k for the following:\n\n~$5k (estimate) to support the Parcel Zero development team at the desired level. As part of the final monumental push to get the Parcel Zero Reveal across the line, many team members made contributions beyond what was expected to make the reveal and app amazing. The rollout was better than many professional organizations, and the near complete lack of concerns/issues post reveal is a testament to success of their efforts. This is a small buffer that grants the development team the ability to retroactively compensate those people for additional work performed. Distribution to be determined by the team who was responsible for delivering the Parcel Viewer app & Metadata Reveal.\n\n~$15k (estimate) to cover costs of minting and distributing the remaining ~900 unminted Parcel Zero NFT’s. Note that the entirety of these would be exclusively for Parcel Zero NFT holders to allocate (CityDAO has already been granted their share of 100), but in order to save on costs of a second transfer CityDAO will hold these in trust and distribute them as instructed by Parcel Zero governance. This is only to earmark the cash; there is no distribution schedule at this time. Parcel Zero NFT holders will determine how these are distributed through separate Parcel Zero Improvement Proposal(s) or similar governance process.\n\n~$20k (estimate per @fugyeah) to cover essential costs on the parcel for 10 years (taxes, insurance, and basic maintenance). Intended to remain in trust and cover expenses as incurred.\n\n~$33k to continue development and experiment with what is possible. This small seed would unburden Parcel Zero NFT holders from the need to justify spend from a separate entity. This commitment from the CityDAO community will create opportunity to explore what is possible related to Parcel Zero, at the discretion of Parcel Zero NFT holders.\n\nNote that many of these items are approximations. Although these best estimates are believed to be reasonable, some of the monies from the general fund may be necessary to cover under-estimated amounts, and for any category which is under-utilized, any remaining funds will become available for general development and experimentation related to Parcel Zero (i.e., contributing to or taking from the bucket above).\n\nDISCORD COMMUNITY\nA Parcel Zero NFT holder is deserving of the same rights and privilege that we grant to Citizenship holders, albeit through separate mechanisms. Additionally, we will have Parcel Zero NFT holders who do not hold a citizenship nor have interest in existing CityDAO activities.\n\nProposal is for a structure that looks very similar to the current guild approach. This provides continuity for the look and feel that citizens have come to expect over the last year, and creates a space which makes it easy for Parcel Zero NFT holders to focus time and attention in a familiar way:\n\nA new Discord Category for Parcel Zero similar to what we have for current guilds.\nA new self-selected Discord role for Parcel Zero, allowing users to self-select into discussions in #unlock-channels\nA new verification process for Parcel Zero NFT holders, similar to what we have for the current Citizenship NFT for locked channels\nWithin the new Discord category, we would expect to create access similar to what we have for our current guilds, including:\n\nGeneral Public\nCityDAO Citizenship NFT only\nParcel Zero NFT only\nBoth CityDAO Citizenship NFT and Parcel Zero NFT\netc.\nIt is initially proposed that DenverCitizen9 be granted full authority over the new Parcel Zero Discord category to set up, manage, and experiment with the layout of the channels, similar to the local authority that we currently grant to existing guilds. Note that this is in addition to, not in lieu of existing admin control, and there is no expectation that DenverCitizen9 will gain any type of facilitator role or additional privilege or recognition related to the Parcel Zero effort; the purpose is to unburden the current CityDAO team.\n\nGOVERNANCE\nWhile it may be reasonable to expect Parcel Zero NFT holders to initially follow a process similar to what was established for CityDAO, a separate Snapshot category will be necessary as governance rights are unrelated to the existing CityDAO citizenship. This may need to be tied to the Parcel Zero ENS (though it is not known who currently holds that).\n\nTREASURY MANAGEMENT\nIf this CIP passes, NFT holders are expected to voice opinions and make a determination for who has the ability to distribute related Parcel Zero funds. Ideally this would happen after a selection process and Parcel Zero NFT holder vote. A review of the LLC documentation would likely be necessary to understand what is possible and/or expected.",

      "title": " CIP-115: CityDAO Academic Conference and Journal",
      "content": "Summary\n\nThis CIP seeks funding for ScottA to continue to assist in planning the first annual CityDAO Academic Conference and to continue work with numerous authors on the CityDAO Journal. ScottA was previously bountied to work on these tasks, but as the Q3 Education & Research Guild budget has been reduced by 50%, his work is now being presented as an independent project. This CIP requests $1200 + 2 Citizenship NFTs per month for his work.\n\nBackground\n\nOne of the most exciting initiatives in the Education & Research Guild is the development of the first annual CityDAO Academic Conference, which will be held virtually from Sept 3-4, 2022. The event brings together various experts in different aspects of blockchain and web3 education. The ultimate goal is to start a positive feedback loop intertwining a cutting-edge web3 city with education. Education and cities induce powerful positive externalities. This dynamic has boot-strapped great cities in the past and is a model for doing so in the future.\n\nConnected with the conference is CityDAO Journal, which is a method to explore the ideas that will build web3 cities and establish CityDAO as a thought leader in this space. The Journal seeks to discuss vital concepts and to push them forward while at the same time producing content to attract people via thoughtful engagement.\n\nScottA recently finished a Ph.D. in economics and is currently set to publish two journal articles. He has a strong research background and is highly qualified to lead such a project.\n\nSUCCESSES\n\nScottA has helped to curate relationships with 45 student blockchain associations, 30 education-related DAOs, and numerous other potential contributors. Contact methods have included emailing, engaging on Twitter and discord, and via LinkedIn. Thus far, of the groups contacted, about 35% have replied, and 25% plan to participate in the conference.\n\nScottA has spent over 60 hours contacting, following up, and conversing with the above-noted groups. This will be valuable in numerous ways for CityDAO moving forward – building a city will require many partnerships and resources. We now have keynote speakers, 5 panel discussions and 2 roundtable discussions. He has additionally developed and maintained a detailed spreadsheet of all contacts, which is valuable to CityDAO.\n\nDuring this past quarter, ScottA has also helped to oversee the CityDAO Journal. This has produced content related to Quadratic Voting/Funding and Social Tokens. The articles have gained considerable readership using metrics such as twitter likes and retweets. One citizen stated that finding the articles was the reason they joined CityDAO. ScottA has spent over 45 hours writing, editing and developing others’ content, and doing research related to the articles.\n\nFinally, ScottA has contributed to initiatives such as the CityDAO book (currently writing multiple chapters), the Study Group (attended all the groups and led the discussion on 2 occasions), and broadly to the ultimate vision of CityDAO University.\n\nROADMAP AND DELIVERABLES\n\nSuccessful delivery of the CityDAO Academic Conference\n\nSuccess metrics will include the number of total citizens and non-citizens attending, satisfaction, and engagement. A metric will be derived called “key connections.” A “key connection” will be established if a participant attended the majority of the conference and, in a follow-up survey, indicated a desire to have further involvement with CityDAO.\n\nContinued Maintenance of the CityDAO Journal\n\nThe articles should be measured as successful if they attract traffic and encourage involvement in CityDAO. Metrics have not yet been established, but ScottA will work in partnership with the media guild to do so.\n\nThe articles produced will focus on quality over quantity. The goal would be 1-2 articles per month and should be highly aligned with topics in the Web3 space and CityDAO. This will include articles that may result from the CityDAO Academic Conference\n\nEstablish the CityDAO Think Tank\n\nOne key goal of the Education & Research Guild is to pivot from maintaining numerous independent initiatives to becoming a think tank for projects that are proposed by citizens. ScottA will work with David to develop a process for citizens who require research to be matched with key resources and for those resources to be properly overseen, evaluated, bountied and compensated to maximize quality and effectiveness.\n\nREQUEST FOR FUNDING\n\nDuring Q2, ScottA was bountied at 20 hours per week at $30 per hour. Given budgetary restrictions, this CIP proposes that his hours be reduced to 10 hours per week for a rate of $300 per week + 2 Citizenship NFTs per month.",

      "title": " CIP-114: Teach Anything! with Tippi Fifestarr",
      "content": "SUMMARY\n\nSince May 20th, Tippi has, for free and on his own, created and run a successful bi-monthly event within the Education & Research Guild called “Teach Anything!” This CIP explains the event’s success, creates deliverables for Q3 and asks for basic funding to continue this event. This CIP asks for $950 per month for the development of the event + 1 NFT for the quarter as retroactive comp for Tippi.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe foundation of a city is not land, it is community. The foundation of a community is people and culture. A strong culture requires four elements: ritual, storytelling, artifacts and language. CityDAO seeks to be a city. This necessitates a community that grows together. Events where people gather to share knowledge and stories provide critical elements of shared culture.\n\nIn May 2022, Tippi began an event called “Teach Anything!”, which is held twice a month. It consists of 4 presenters who speak on topics of interest. The purpose of this event is not only to show that anyone can teach, but also to help people share their stories and knowledge, and to help people improve their presentation skills.\n\nSUCCESSES\n\nUsing the metric of “citizen time”, Teach Anything! is one of the most successful initiatives in CityDAO. Over the past 3 months, it has generated over 55 hours of citizen engagement. At least 20 different citizens have attended overall, with a high rate of retention as measured by return attendance and requests to present again.\n\nIncluding Tippi, 8 unique citizens have presented. Only 2 presenters missed their slots in the 5 sessions, and both of them came to the next session and taught. Feedback from the citizens has been positive as measured by informal polls. There are almost no comparable initiatives that have been done for free by members of CityDAO, undertaken for the good of the community without compensation.\n\nHere is a list of topics that were presented:\n\nIntro to Teach Anything, Listening to the Audience, How to give Quality Feedback, How to Ask for Money, Web3 Acronyms, The Relevance of Fruit, Types of Fruits and Health Benefits of 20+ Different Fruits, Introduction to Marketing: What is Marketing (part 1), Introduction to Marketing: What is Marketing (season 1 part 2), Why I Love Design Thinking, From Dirt to Data (Deep dive on Plot 0), How to Write a Pitch Deck, What I Learned at Permissionless.\n\nThe variety of topics (Anything!) and the juxtaposition of quality (Anyone!) make this event novel and interesting and keep people coming back.\n\nROADMAP AND DELIVERABLES\n\nDevelopment of a feedback and evaluation process using established Human Resource Management (HRM) techniques, to be led by Tippi and guided by David. David has been a professor of HRM for over 5 years at an accredited undergraduate university.\nCharted qualitative and quantitative analyses of various key metrics, such as distributions of participants, satisfaction, effectiveness of training, quality of guidance, etc. These metrics form the basis of analyses that can be used across guilds.\nExperimenting with alternate times and meeting locations besides Discord, particularly Gather.Town, to host the Teach Anything! events.\nREQUEST FOR FUNDING\n\nSo far, Tippi has run this event for 3 months without any compensation or request for compensation. This demonstrates a commitment to the success of CityDAO and should be rewarded. This CIP would award 1 Citizenship NFT to Tippi retroactively for his contributions.\n\nFacilitating this event, analyzing the data and continually improving quality is believed to take approximately 5 hours per week. At $40 per hour, this would be $200 per week, or $800 per month. Additionally, $150 per month is requested for discretionary funds, which may be used to experiment with rewarding presenters, participants, survey takers and other metric providers. This $150 will not be used for compensation to Tippi.",

      "title": "CIP-69 Q3 Guild Structure and Budget",
      "content": "## Citizens, \n\nThe following is a proposal for the re-structuring of CityDAO Guilds and a new budget structure for 2022 Q3. \n\nCIP-69, if passed, will retroactively compensate contributors from the 11th July under the new budget Structure. CIP-69 will be for the quarter period July 1st to September 30th.\n\nEach Document can be found in this Google Drive Folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NxCXM-ihPwYwvq6G8Njjufhf5O3Cplb9?usp=sharing\n\n## Overview:\n\nThe CIP-69 Structure separates Guilds into two different Categories; Functional and Resource. This is done to assist with a leaner approach to execution and engagement, while at the same time, promoting a project based approach to CityDAO comp and deliverables. \n\n### Functional Guilds: \nThese are guilds designed to run the necessary operations of CityDAO so that it remains functional. These guilds will have the necessary manpower to execute things like: Financial Forecasting, Taxes, Salaries, legal work, compliance work, community management, discord, social media, marketing, events, media work, public affairs, grants, investments. etc. \n\nThese will not have onboarding flows and not have extra contributors. They are run specifically for functionality of Citydao. \n\n### Resource Guilds:   \n\nThese guilds are the talent and resources necessary for CityDAO to grow. These guilds will have onboarding flows and contributors that are encouraged to join and complete bounties. These guilds will have 1 (2 in rare cases) facilitators with the task of doing VERY administrative guild work and with the main focus being encouraging onboarding, helping with resource allocation, guidance on projects that have their guild involved. \n\n### Projects: ( Project Empowerment (CIP-65))\nProjects are ultimately what will push CityDAO forward. Projects will be proposed via CIP flow and managed by Planning & Operations. Management for these projects will be: Helping with the CIP flow, review of team and resources required, allocation of guild resources by working with the guild lead. Oversight of current CIPs and contact with leads for projects. \n\nProjects are designed to mainly use Resource Guilds as a talent pool for a project team to execute on something. Resource Guild Facilitators will be tasked with working with Planning & Operations to find talent within the guilds and assign them to the project team. \n\n### Implementation\nDraft 1 - 9th July\nDraft 2 - 10th July\nDraft 3 - 13th July\nFinal Draft  - 17th July\nSnapshot - 17th July\nCompletion - 25th July\nImplementation - 26th-31st July\n\n### City Court Structure - Q3\nThe CityDAO Court requires amendment to the charter and this document serves as an overview of the structure proposed.\n\nUntil an amended draft is completed and the CityDAO Court structure is complete, the CityDAO Mission Guild will remain intact. \n\n### New Guild Structure - Q3\nAuthorised until end of Q3 2022\n\n* Design Guild: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fNVJVrsSK7bS3pHedIuEuApeC4z2gXfO/view?usp=sharing\n\n* Legal and Finance Guild: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v78nMkJpkSpntYUBEVI9DYRWnlH16tuS/view?usp=sharing\n\n* Grants and Innovations Guild: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kDQtkjqaKIQPh5EfaXHVxPkF9TizNZTx/view?usp=sharing\n\n* Community Guild: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lJMh9Na6JJ_Cdlr8_HzJ5bph-KGuvYWK/view?usp=sharing\n\n* Education and Research Guild: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iiTZ55KHTRY5HX9je5432Ou8C1lcw7Ap/view?usp=sharing\n\n* Media Guild: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12ah723RAkZF9y4FjTIpjfpXS1qM1p5In/view?usp=sharing\n\n* Planning & Operations Guild: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FcEeOVEMUQ-hmUaUHwsLn4Lgy1hjFdvV/view?usp=sharing\n\n* Real Estate Guild: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zPldvUa4FSh8t_zTvV59uIUcOUELtsS2/view?usp=sharing\n\n* Development Guild: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J-9hQEtWZcnsQZWTmzeLnac6FjzxQ8vw/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n### Q3 Budget \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J8DHB2iFPf0tmNB8LrYCV0PUacDRVM22TtCO_6a_CyU/edit?usp=sharing\n\nAuthorised until end of Q3 2022 \n\nQUADRATIC SQUARE ROOT VOTING APPLIES TO THIS CIP.\nTHE RESULTS OF THIS CIP WILL BE DETERMINED BY RUNNING CHOICES THROUGH A QUADRATIC SOLVER.

      "title": " CIP-102: Acquire Baby Parcel for NFT Leases",
      "content": "## Proposal full text:\nhttps://forum.citydao.io/t/cip-102-acquire-baby-parcel-for-nft-leases/1625\n\n### Summary:\nThis proposal aims to acquire a small piece of land and authorizes off-ramping $9,999 for acquisition of the parcel that will be used for experimental NFT leases. The project will serve as a prototype for the Big Parcel project and leases will be made available to Citizens. The project team will research parcels and give the community a few parcel options to choose between.\n\n### We propose the Baby Parcel project, with 3 goals:\n- Purchasing a parcel of land and make NFT land leases available to CityDAO Citizens. This will be a breakthrough crypto primitive- the first NFTs that represent rights to visit, use, and potentially even build on land. It’s a step towards land ownership NFTs.\n- Serve as a prototype for the Big Parcel (CIP 66) project and test learnings on a smaller scale while a larger land purchase is scouted.\n- Serve as a logical next step to Parcel 0, adding more rights to the NFT land agreements.\n- We view this as the training wheels for learning how to ride the Big Parcel bike with NFT leases, land purchases outside of Wyoming, and more.\n\nSpecifically, we propose to purchase a vacant piece of land in the San Luis Valley of Colorado, where land is cheap, near tourist attractions such as Great Sand Dunes National Park, and where there are minimal HOAs or land use restrictions - for $9,999 or less - and to then experiment with subdivided leasehold interests for the holders of the NFTs. For example, CityDAO could purchase a 5 acre lot for around $5k, and “subdivide” the parcel into 10 half-acre parcels that would represent certain rights related to each sub-plot (Baby Parcel NFTs). We could also look at using Harberger mechanisms for rights transfers and additional value creation for CityDAO.\n\n### Project Facilitator Team:\n\nJosh - Project Lead, real estate transactions\nScott - real estate\nLyons - strategy\nKonrad - operations\nGugz - Big Parcel liaison and planning\nProject Team: facilitators will select and reward up to 6 Citizens who aid the project in dev, media, and design.\n\nProject Facilitator Rewards: $2,500 USDC + 3 Citizen NFTs each\n\nProject Team Rewards: $1,000 USDC + 1 Citizen NFT each\n\nAdditionally - CityDAO will retain one Baby Parcel NFT and the Project Facilitator and Project Team will collectively get the right to decide what to do with said NFT as a collective team.\n\nPlease Note - the rewards are an incentive for completion of the project. Upon successful launch of Baby Parcel NFTs as determined by the multisig holders, the multisig is authorized to transfer the comp.\n\n### Benefits for CityDAO / the Community:\nCommunity Engagement – The Baby Parcel will provide CityDAO with a project that is achievable in the short run. The community will have something to be executed about, and the “doers” can get back to work adding value to CityDAO in a meaningful way. Once news of the Baby Parcel breaks, CityDAO can expect an influx of interested and willing contributors to step forward.\n\nInnovating in NFTs and Real Estate: the Baby Parcel will provide a safe environment to be used as a proving ground for concepts that are relevant for Big Parcel execution (for example: land token experimentation, NFT transfer of property rights, potential Harberger experimentation, NFT design and execution, etc)\n\n“Tuition” - The Baby Parcel will be the most important learning experience yet for CityDAO. CityDAO will have the opportunity to obtain intel / insight into the overall process without creating a “bet the DAO” situation as will be the case by the time we wish to move forward with the Big Parcel. For a legitimately minimal expense, CityDAO can find out what does - and does not - work with respect to creating a land token standard and using NFTs to allocate property rights. Whatever CityDAO learns from the Baby Parcel, it will be money well spent for the collective direction of the DAO and our mission.\n\nFinancial Considerations - Treasury Impact. The project team requests $9,999 offramped to the CityDAO bank account upon passage of this proposal for Parcel acquisition and legal costs. Any unused funds will be returned. This represents around 0.4% of our treasury.\n\nProcess Flow/Community Touch Points:\na) This CIP-102 will be put up to Forum and then Snapshot for approval by the Community through governance.\n\nb) If approved, the Community will be asked for a temp check “taste and preferences” vote (through Discord or less formal means than Snapshot) from between 3-5 selected parcels around 5 acres (For example: https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/Ll-9th-St-Lot-10_Blanca_CO_81123_M90319-30673 7; https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/7-Sixth-St_Blanca_CO_81123_M91246-07855 1; https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/Estrella-Rd-Lot-11_Blanca_CO_81123_M93297-21676 4).\n\nc) After the vote, the Project Team will offramp fiat for the purchase, closing costs, and 10 years of approximate insurance and taxes, along with a budget provision for 10% of the purchase price to be used for other operating expenses (to be held in an interest-bearing account with the intent of finding ways to pay such expenses in crypto and potentially automate such processes)\n\nd) The Project Team will consummate the transaction using an appropriate legal mechanism, like a wholly-owned special purpose vehicle (“SPV”) incorporated and designed to handle the liabilities and related issues of purchase and subsequent operation. CityDAO will fund the SPV’s treasury with the funds needed to consummate the transaction.\n\ne) Once acquired, the Project Team would commence meetings with the Community to build momentum for how to use the Property in the short run. The intended short term goal will be to use NFTs and/or a token-land standard to transfer as many property rights to holders as possible without creating legal risk or running afoul of the law of course. We intend to prove-out concepts using an MVP model that will be instrumental to execution on the larger vision with the Big Parcel.\n",

      "content": "TL/DR: This proposal authorizes up to $650k for off-ramping from the CityDAO Main Treasury for the purchase of CityDAO Parcel Home, a multi-use property in Denver, Colorado. \n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION: Parcel Home can meet many of the desires for CityDAO’s next parcel and build upon what we learned acquiring Parcel 0. Our first piece of land had limited use but provided opportunity for Citizens to visit and experiment. The logical next step is acquiring a house! The idea here is that we can meaningfully expand our property rights allocations in light of actual use opportunities while enabling further community engagement and community value-add, while further allowing for experimentation around some of the radical concepts that have given CityDAO so much momentum.\n\nPROJECT TEAM: Q2 2022 CityDAO Real Estate Guild Facilitators - Scott / Josh\n\nPARCEL: A property in Denver with little or no Homeowners Association / “blockers”\n\nUSE: Mixed Use - Uses may include but are not limited to:\n\n-Space for CityDAO Citizens to co-work and stay (can use blockchain based reservation system and NFT entry, and other blockchain applications\n-Space for Community and Facilitator Meetups/Retreats\n-Rental Income (AirBNB/VRBO “Season” during high tourism months)\n-CityDAO Sponsored Hacker Houses\n-Co-Working “Season” – Invite other DAOs/Projects to come and collaborate/collide\n-Experimental “Season” where we test unique ideas relating to Quadratic Voting, Quadratic Funding, SALSA, and other unique ways to allocate property rights (but in experimental sandbox and without long-standing consequences)\n-Other Uses as may be proposed by the Community from time to time\n\nACQUISITION PROCESS:\n\n1) Pass this CIP-63\n2) Project Team selects property\n3) Project Team makes contingent “cash” offer\n4) CityDAO will pay earnest money and bring selected property under contract with immediate temperature-check Snapshot to confirm property acquisition\n(a) If confirmed – offramp fiat and close on transaction, and will request extra fiat to place into interest bearing account for purpose of “cushion” on operating expenses, taxes, insurance, etc\n(b) If not confirmed – the Project team will find another property\n\nCOMMUNITY BENEFITS: Place to stay for citizens, IRL collaboration and relationship building, useful during ETH Denver, engaging project for the community to rally around, experimentation, and other efforts leading to additional positive PR from influencers / meaningful public good outcomes\n\nFINANCIALS: Upon passage of this proposal, $650k from the treasury is authorized to be converted from ETH and off-ramped into fiat toward the purchase price, fees, taxes, and other costs related to acquiring Parcel Home. We propose moving the funds to fiat soon, in order to test the DAO’s new FTX off-ramp and to ensure CityDAO is positioned to make a cash offer.\n\nWe also point out that the funds are not \"lost\"; rather value is being stored in an alternative manner while creating a meaningful project that enables CityDAO to get back to building and collaborating - even in a down market.\n\nBUSINESS MODEL / OPERATING EXPENSES: There will be no initial monetization other than possible revenue relating to renting the property out (in which case we would consider the costs of cleaning and property management to the extent they cannot be brought in-house). CityDAO may (and should) also set aside a percentage of the purchase price in an interest-bearing account as a reserve for several years of insurance, taxes, property management, and related operating expenses. \n\nTEAM COMPENSATION: If Scott and Josh are able to execute on this Parcel Home proposal, they will be compensated with eight (8) CityDAO Citizen NFTs and $2500 USDC each, upon closing.\n\nEXAMPLE PROPERTIES:\n\nhttps://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/3431-E-29th-Ave_Denver_CO_80205_M21190-32305\n\nhttps://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/942-Kalamath-St_Denver_CO_80204_M17758-96953\n\nhttps://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/2130-N-Marion-St_Denver_CO_80205_M15630-33889\n\nhttps://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/1620-N-Humboldt-St_Denver_CO_80218_M26143-28871\n\nCOMMUNITY INPUT:\nDue to the fast pace of the current real estate market CityDAO may need to make several offers and will certainly have to move quickly - making it infeasible to vote on each property individually. This proposal authorizes the Project Team to make the final call on the acquisition of the property - however the Project Team may use Snapshot and/or Discord votes to evaluate community interest in the selected property/property location.",

      "title": "CIP 66: The Big Parcel",
      "content": "PROPOSAL OVERVIEW: With a “Parcel 1” proposal already up on the CityDAO Forum, we propose a concurrent “Parcel 2” project, hereinafter referred to as “The Big Parcel”. This is a proposal for CityDAO to start looking for a large parcel of land, hundreds of acres in size, in America, which could be used for various city building purposes. The purpose of this proposal is to gauge community interest before we spend time searching for and analyzing alternatives. This proposal is NOT a business plan, a feasibility report or a full explanation of a sustainable path forward nor is it a balance of costs and revenues, legal issues or actual use.\n\nCityDAO is a groundbreaking web3 project that seeks to create a city of the future. To realize this, CityDAO incorporated as an LLC, built a vibrant community of thousands of participants, and purchased Parcel 0. CityDAO then elected a council to create the City Charter. A guild structure was developed with eleven different teams, including finance, real estate, design, development, operations and education, all for the unified purpose of building a city. We are now ready for phase two of CityDAO - acquiring more parcels to scale our capabilities on all fronts, from revenue generation to experiments and more.\n\nMany Citizens view the future of CityDAO as a “network city,” a network of physical locations around the world owned and managed by our DAO. Within the context of this vision, The Big Parcel is intended to be the primary physical headquarters of the DAO, where large numbers of people can gather, work, and live. The Big Parcel must be a large piece of land, or a partnership with an existing city, that has structures currently ready for use. It must also be able to accommodate a much wider range of experimental initiatives than Parcel 1, including but not limited to:\n\nCo-living\nCo-working\nRetreats\nCity Building\nPublic Goods management and incentive structures\nExperimental ownership and governance schemes (i.e. Harberger Taxes/SALSA, QF, QV)\nConstruction and Development\nFractionalization / Tokenization\nAffordable Housing\nLocation for development / use of software integrations such as NFT keys to physical doors and gates, blockchain-based property mgmt, etc.\n\nTHE REQUIRED ELEMENTS OF THE BIG PARCEL ARE:\nMultiple existing structures that can be utilized immediately\nLots of acreage, ideally 500+\nReasonable proximity to an airport\nIdeologically aligned municipality / existing community\n\nTHE PREFERRED ELEMENTS OF THE BIG PARCEL ARE:\nLand that can easily be subdivided and / or there are processes in place on the local level that make it possible if you go through the motions\nFlexible zoning\nExisting legal precedent / statutory authority for creating / incorporating a true city\n\nPROJECT TEAM: The initial Big Parcel Team will be led by Gugz and David. Other team members and guilds will be brought on as needed. Bounties may be offered to citizens for assistance where needed.\n\nGUILDS INVOLVED: Planning & Operations, Legal, Real Estate, Finance, Design, Research, Public Affairs\n\nRESOURCES NEEDED: N/A\n\nBUDGET FOR PROJECT PROPOSAL: The discretionary budget for this proposal is $10,000, to be used only where needed for bounties or expenses. None of this money will go to either Gugz or David.\n\nBUDGET FOR THE PROJECT: TBD based on parcel chosen\n\nFUNDING RELEASE: N/A\n\nPROJECTED TIMELINE: The expected timeline to find The Big Parcel will be by the end of Q3 (end of August). This timeline may need to be adjusted as this is based on the availability of suitable parcels and potential unforeseen delays in government agencies replying to our inquiries.\n\nWeeks 1-3: Search for and find 3-10 suitable parcels that meet the “Required Elements” listed above. At least one of these should be in Wyoming. This will be done through online searches and real estate agents. Other citizens may be bountied to help with this task, so long as this is done immediately. During this time, the “Big Parcel Funding Team” will be established.\n\nWeeks 3-6: Each of these parcels shall receive a feasibility report, covering the legal, financial and public affairs assessments. Other guilds and facilitators will be tasked to help with relevant studies, such as notes on legal and financial feasibility.\n\nWeeks 6-9: These feasibility reports will be expanded into business plans.\n\nWeeks 9-12: The reports will be published to the community in a CIP for a one week discussion regarding preferences on parcels. It will be put to a Snapshot vote that the Big Parcel Team has the authority to make offers on the top 3 parcels. Offers will be made for the top 3 parcels. The offer that is accepted becomes the Big Parcel for CityDAO, our capital city.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION \nBig Parcel Funding Team: A Big Parcel Funding Team will be created, which may include citizens from Grants, Legal and other guilds to explore how CityDAO would raise funding via possible requests for donations, NFT fractionalization, sales to accredited investors, VC involvement or other possible mechanisms. An investor deck will be created and a report prepared for each investment method.\n\nTeam Compensation: Team compensation will be addressed at a later date, subject to another CIP, when the project is farther along and/or complete.",

      "title": "CIP 61 - Reimbursement for Parcel 0 Visit ",
      "content": "Introduction\n\nThis is a proposal to reimburse Guild Facilitators who went to Wyoming to work on CityDAO for one week, to visit possible parcels of land that CityDAO could purchase for building a city (Parcel 1) and to plant a flag on Parcel 0. This proposal was previously put on Snapshot, but was removed before a vote could be taken, due to procedural issues.\n\nBackground\n\nCityDAO began with a tweet from Scott Fitsimones on August 5th, 2021. In December 2021, the CityDAO City Council was formed through elections. They began work on a charter. The months from January to April were an exciting time, with numerous hours of city council meetings daily, and the eventual creation of the Charter, the Operating Agreement, and the Bundled Guild Proposal, all of which passed via a Snapshot vote. At no time had these council members, many of whom are now facilitators, met in person. \n\nOn April 26, 2022, Scott told the facilitators that he was going to Wyoming to visit Parcel 0 and to plant a flag. He invited them to join. It was a last minute decision but some members bought a ticket. The members who chose to attend were: David from the Legal and Education Guilds, Sytonikka (Nico) from the Design Guild, Pat from Events and Lyons from Operations. We met Josh (formerly DAOvolution) who lives in Wyoming, along with Wdclapp (Walt) from the Legal Guild and his brother kkopczyn (Konrad) from the Real Estate Guild, who were there. \n\nDeliverables\n\nRelationships: This trip proved to be extremely valuable. In terms of spending time together, everyday we ate breakfast, lunch and dinner together. When we weren’t seeing land or visiting Parcel 0, our days were spent sitting around a table at the Airbnb with our computers open, on calls with others in the DAO, discussing the mission, the vision, the values, and the future of CityDAO. When we had questions, we could just ask each other. The days were filled with very fruitful conversations about issues that could be discussed in person rather than over Discord. \n\nReal Estate: We were able to engage with local real estate agents in Wyoming and actually visit a number of properties for sale, including both unused land and land with structures, to get a better idea of prices, concerns of the local residents, availability of parcels and contacts that we could use in the future for seeing available land and making offers.\n\nLegal: We were able to meet in person with the local Wyoming representative of CityDAO who will handle legal filings, and who created the Parcel 0 LLC. Meeting with him in person allowed us to make an invaluable contact, another law firm that specializes in securities and who literally helped write the Wyoming DAO law. They are now serving as outside counsel for CityDAO and it is unlikely we ever would have met them had we not been there in person. \n\nParcel 0: We went to parcel 0 and planted a huge flag together. We were able to gauge the land, the driving, the conditions and to discuss more meaningfully how this land may be used viably. In addition, we were able to have a long conversation with the neighbors who live next to Parcel 0. They were extremely interested in who we are and what we represent. Despite living in a non-urban setting, they were very knowledgeable about both CityDAO and blockchain. This gave us valuable insights into the neighbors we may have if we decide to move forwards with a Parcel 1 purchase in Wyoming or similar areas.\n\n \n![ea726cf2c2bf71812264d9bbb2e779e69a4b15bb_2_634x844.jpeg](ipfs://QmV5JPRZVAu67YsrMnTD8M7sdkyFFgwoaLVF3Ye8yDjQM5)\n    \n\nConclusion\n\nThe value of this IRL meeting of the facilitators was high. It demonstrated that IRL meetings are an important part of CityDAO. Real connections were made with each other, with the guilds and with the land. We believe that IRL meetings between citizens, facilitators and guilds should be a part of our goal.  We would therefore like to establish a precedent that they be funded so that others, not only facilitators, but also citizens, may meet outside Discord and in real life. \n\nFor all airplane tickets, food, car rentals and expenses, the total cost for this trip was: $9005.27\nThe expense breakdown can be seen in this document: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19Q_NZbbkc_yX_899-COaEo_TKxvI1U33nTJaUfuYupY/edit?usp=sharing\n",

      "title": "CIP-48: CityDAO Conversion to partial Quadratic Voting (\"QV\")",
      "content": "Citizens,\n\nIt is proposed that we switch from the current One-Token One-Vote system to a version of Quadratic Voting (also known as \"QV\" or \"Plural Voting\").  \n\nIn the proposed version of QV, the number of votes a Citizen has would be equal to the square root of their Citizen token holdings.  For example, a Citizen with 9 tokens has 3 votes; under the current system she has 9.  Holdings that do not cleanly root get rounded down – 6 becomes 2 rather than 2.449.\n\nThis change is proposed because, in recent Snapshots, there have been many people who hold multiple citizen NFTs having a large impact on voting outcomes. It is acknowledged that this is not a perfect solution – someone could transfer Citizen tokens to another wallet that they control.\n\nThe Engineering Guild has commissioned a custom, open source CityDAO QV Snapshot Strategy which was reviewed by Snapshot's engineering team and merged into their codebase [here](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-strategies/commit/838662d7e31d34e61b80ee7f734df64a9f2fdcc9).  It has also been successfully tested by Scott and myself ([Will Holley](https://willholley.com)).\n\nOur version of QV is considered _partial_ because it does not use the [full specification of QV authored by Vitalik and RadicalxChange's Glen Weyl](https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/plural-voting/).  In full QV, each Citizen token is given multiple \"voting credits\" which can be spread out across multiple options and finally then counted by the square root. A full example can be found [here](https://forum.citydao.io/t/comments-on-parcel-1-real-estate-guild-winnowing-process/1392/11).\n\n The proposers believe that the switch from One-Token One-Vote will be shocking for some people and that we should first transition successfully to _partial_ before transitioning to _full_ QV; therefore CityDAO's custom  QV strategy is future-compatible to enable full Quadratic Voting when we're ready.",

For 19.5 ETH, CityDAO would purchase an XXL parcel, allowing us to display the CityDAO logo prominently on the Nemus parcel viewer while contributing to a great cause, and in return, Nemus will donate 125 parcels that the Real Estate Guild will distribute in a fair and transparent way to Citizens. \n\nDETAILS: About Nemus: https://nemus.earth/\n\nFunding Request:\nWe are formally requesting authorization on behalf of CityDAO for the amount of 19.44 ETH which will be used to purchase an XXL Genesis Drop Parcel (“Sponsor Parcel”) plus GAS fees adequate to cover the minting (market-driven). We estimate the total community investment for funding requested under this Proposal will be approximately 19.5 ETH. \n\nBenefits to CityDAO Citizens:\n125 Genesis Drop 1 Parcel NFTs as gifts to Citizens (7.5 ETH of Value Returned). These parcels will be distributed in a fair/transparent manner by the CityDAO Real Estate Guild. \nAdditionally, for future Seruini Parcel Drops (Drops 2-4) - Nemus will provide CityDAO citizens with up to 500 early access seats! \n\nBenefits to CityDAO:\n●\tProminent CityDAO LOGO on the Nemus Parcel Viewer \n●\t*Amazing* NFT for CityDAO Museum (Legendary Diamond Rarity by renowned artist Ben Kwok)\n●\tSupport for Conservation (We'll be conserving 81 Hectares of Rainforest!!! That's like 150 football fields!! Nemus estimates we will be helping lock up to 28,000 tons of carbon through our efforts as well!!)\n●\tEngagement between two lively and like-minded communities\n●\tInternational Community Engagement (CityDAO ops have been U.S. focused so far)\n●\tOpportunities for teams to collaborate further - office hours, collab jam sessions, events, AMAs, etc\n\nCityDAO Sponsors/Action Team:\n•\tThe CityDAO Real Estate Guild is sponsoring this Proposal and the Real Estate Guild will manage the NFT reward drop in conjunction with Dev Team reps: @Casey (handling the Legendary NFT for CityDAO Museum) & @Tuncay / @mayurmistry / @mdnatx (Citizen drop mechanics), and community support from @Syntonikka / @Chance with design / merch support from @PatSantiago.\n",

      "title": "CIP - 44 | Formation of the Events Guild",
      "content": "What is the mission of the Guild?\n\nWith expansion and membership growth being key factors in the future development of CityDAO, the Events Guild strives to create a professional presence at crypto events for the community. By creating this presence, CityDAO can further communicate with other potentially beneficial communities as well as attract top minds into CityDAO.\n\nWhy is the Guild needed in CityDAO?\n\nAs CityDAO evolves, and some problems arise, an influx of creative and talented individuals collaborating with current community members would promote solution-oriented advancement; many hands make light work. Due to the early stage of CityDAO, there is a necessity for innovative people to bring new perspectives and suggestions for solutions. Fortunately, crypto conferences/ hackathons are a unique opportunity to connect CityDAO with people who can in turn contribute to solutions. For Example: More than 12,000 people from 100 countries came to ETHDenver, with about 8,500 checking into the conference. This event alone connected CityDAO with thousands of like-minded individuals who have skills and personal networks themselves. Dozens of current CityDAO citizens participate and were victorious in hacking projects that will also benefit our community and exposed our community to Vitalik Buterin (who was a judge in the hacking competition) and other leaders in web3. Our presence also resulted in new citizens buying their first Citizen NFT to be part of our community.\n\nBy creating the Events Guild, a few thousand people at one event would multiply into a full network of support. Not only would CityDAO benefit from the intel brought by new citizens, but CityDAO would become an organization known by countless other web3 communities and organizers, potentially bringing in investment, support, and connections currently unavailable to us at the same extent. The public affairs guild would have new avenues to follow up on as a result of this networking.\n\nWhat would be the responsibilities of the Guild Facilitators?\n\nFinding crypto events across the country, or potentially globally, and planning which events CityDAO would attend each quarter.\nStrategising, planning and implementing CityDAOs involvement in these events in the form of booths, events, presence and networking.\nRecruiting ambassadors from within our citizens to attend, represent and work at these events.\nPlan and execute budgets to compensate the guild team and participants. Cover the costs of these events and the room and lodging for citizens that will represent CityDAO at these events.\nCreate content from the planning and participation at these events to keep our citizens informed and promote our mission to attract more citizens and potential partnership opportunities.\nCreating IRL CityDAO meetups such as “Hiking in Yosemite”, “CityDAO Burning Man Camp”, “NYC Social Mixer”, “LA Social Mixer” etc.\nFinding insurance policies to cover events\nWhy is this Guild Facilitator qualified for the position?\n\nPat has 5 years of sales experience and over 10 years of marketing experience, making him a qualified candidate for this position. His extensive experience in networking and social connectivity is precisely the skill set needed for a facilitator of the Events Guild. His previous roles in c-level positions gave him valuable understanding of networking and generating b2b relationships. In his time working in the solar industry he was able to generate partnerships with over 100 solar installation companies by attending events and making cold contacts with industry leaders.\n\nPat was chosen to be part of the inaugural CityDAO city council, which gives him an intimate understanding of our mission and our vision. Pat represented CityDAO at EthDenver and his team won the hacking competition that was judged by Vitalik Buterin. This energy and attitude would be used in planning and representing CityDAO in future events, and Pat would be an enthusiastic and professional facilitator.\n\nDoes the Guild already have members ready to join?\n\nYes! There are many citizens currently interested in joining the Events Guild.\n\nIncluding but not limited to: Pat, Lyons, Favian, Syntonika, Mayur, Bruno, Earl, Elmo, Valerie, and many more….\n\nWhat is the budget / what funding is needed?\n\nWe are requesting the following budget for team compensation for Season 1 (the spring quarter through July 1, 2022).\n\nGuild Facilitator - $3,000 + 2 Citizen NFTs/mo\n\n(Guild Facilitator is required to attend 6/6 events)\n\nCo-Facilitator - $1,500 + 1 Citizen NFT/mo\n\n(Co-Facilitator is required to attend 4/6 events)\n\nCitizen NFTs will be distributed for hitting performance goals set by guild members each month\n\nETH Global DAOHacks sponsorship\n\nSponsor Spot = $10,000\n\nPrizes = 4 Citizen NFTs s\n\n[https://dao.ethglobal.com/sponsorship.pdf ]\n\nBlockchain Expo NA\n\nSanta Clara, CA\n\nMay 11-12\n\nAll access tickets x 5 = $5,000\n\nAccommodations for 8 citizens & venue for networking events = $1,400\n\nExpenses (Dinner events, marketing materials,etc) = $2,000\n\n[Blockchain Expo North America 2022 | Technology Conference]\n\nPermissionless\n\nPalm Beach, FL\n\nMay 17-19\n\nTickets x 5 = $5,900\n\nAccommodations for 8 citizens & venue for networking events = $4,000\n\nExpenses (Dinner events, marketing materials,etc) = $5,000\n\n[Permissionless - Blockworks]\n\nConsensus\n\nAustin, TX\n\nJune 9-12\n\nGA tickets x5 = $5,000\n\nAccommodations for 8 citizens & venue for networking events = $4,800\n\nExpenses (Dinner events, marketing materials,etc) = $2,500\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/consensus2022]\n\nNFT NYC/ETH NYC\n\nNew York, NY\n\nJune 20-26\n\nAll access ticket = $1500\n\nGA tickets x 4 = $2400\n\nAccommodations for 8 citizens & venue for networking events = $11,500\n\nExpenses (Dinner events, marketing materials,etc) = $5000\n\n[https://nyc.ethglobal.co/]\n\nGross cost for this quarter = $65,100 +13 citizen NFTs\n\n$60,000 has already been allotted for attending events, we would bring these funds into the event guild budget.\n\nTotal quarterly budget request = $5,100 + 13 Citizen NFTs\n\nHow many multisig members will there be?

      "title": "Funding Proposal for CityDAO Podcast",
      "content": "\n**Recurring: $2,000/mth x 12mths to fund the following:**\n- All checklist items for production (scroll down below for details)\n- Weekly episodes on-going x 52 weeks\n- Audio editing\n- Written show notes and reference url's\n- Website updates + hosting + management\n- Guest sourcing, relations, organizing and hosting\n- Leadership for the show overall\n\n**One-time: 5 CitizenDAO NFT’s, for all work completed to date including:**\n- Website design, development, hosting and launch\n- 12 Episodes recording, editing, show notes\n- Guest sourcing, organizing and hosting\n- Leadership/management\n\n\n**Vision for the CityDAO Podcast & why it’s needed**\n\nThe CityDAO Podcast is a vehicle to initiate and engage with important conversations with political leaders across the globe in collaborative fashion at the proverbial round table. This is an opportunity to establish positive relationships with todays politicians to demystify DAO’s and help bridge the gap between traditional Politics and the new-age Web3 revolution.\n\nAdditionally, someday a physical city -as defined by current geographical boundaries & connected to our present political system- will opt to operate as a DAO & CityDAO should be there when it happens to help everyone involved.\n\nThere’s always a 1st for everything. Wyoming was the 1st US state to embrace DAO recognition, the Republic of The Marshal Islands was the first country to embrace DAO’s at the Federal level, El Salvador was the 1st county to embrace bitcoin as a national currency and Miami was the 1st city to launch an official City Coin. When the first City begins to operate as a DAO, CityDAO should be there well in advance of the announcement to assist with the transition.\n\nCityDAO is on the radar with important and powerful people across the globe including some of todays political leaders. The warm and welcomed reception I received when talking with the City of Miami and the Wyoming Senate clarified to me just how unique of a position CityDAO is in.\n\n\n**Background of the CityDAO Podcast**\n\nI volunteered to lead the CityDAO Podcast initiative via a Discord post in November 2021 which received unanimous positive feedback at the time. Since then the Podcast has been coming to life and taking shape. I have personally paid for any and all podcast related costs to date 100% and not received nor requested for any back compensation prior to this proposal being sent forth to you, the CityDAO community.\n\n\nProgress to date:\n1. Website design is completed and live\n2. Hosting site is completed and live\n3. Systems & processes have been established for; audio editing, time stamped show notes, reference URL’s, and pushing live to hosting and website\n4. 11 Episodes are currently live right now including;\n- 8x Citizens Series\n- 1x External Guests\n- 1x AMA & perhaps most importantly;\n- 1x Notable Political figure from the City of Miami\n5. 3 more episodes are finished recording and in for editing right now and will be live within the next 10 days\n6. 4 more episodes are currently scheduled to be recorded between now and end of March including Senator Rothfuss from the State of Wyoming, Chairman of the Blockchain Council that passed Bill-38 to recognize DAO’s\n7. 495 podcast unique listens have occurred as of todays date\n27 different countries have tuned in\n91% is a Male audience so far and most listeners ie 41% are ages 28-34\n\n\n**Current Job Description and Responsibilities**\n\nAs with any project, the CityDAO Podcast has a checklist of tasks and responsibilities that needs to be completed on-going generally as well as for every episode. Here is the checklist as it stands today:\n\n\n**PRE-LAUNCH (completed)**\n\n1. Prep, design & maintain the WP website @ podcast.citydao.io 1\n2. Prep & setup the podcasting hosting site @ anchor.fm\n3. Google drive organization for raw files, edited files, photo’s, notes, episode names & organization\n4. Set up basic recording room for audio & visual recordings. Currently using a blue yeti mic, audacity for host audio, zoom for guest audio & zoom video both video. For video background imagery so I’ve chosen two art pieces which I felt reflect the spirit of what we’re doing here at CityDAO. I’ve been looking into having a 3D print made of the CityDAO logo as well which I think would look pretty dank when done\n5. Source out and pay for intro music, trial and error to get it to sound good\n\n\n**LAUNCH (also completed)**\n\n1. **Source out/locate & schedule guests.** Sometimes is quite easy as with Citizens series, other times takes work such as locating contact info and back and forth emails explaining as with Erick Gavin from Miami and Senator Rothfuss from Wyoming. I created the email template being used thus far and have been handling that correspondence.\n2. **Pre-recording prep**, usually includes things such as; researching guest, preparing questions, citing current CityDAO and global events, little cheat sheet of questions and interview/discussion agenda\n3. **Interview & Recording.** This is my favorite part, this is basically why I do this at all. I love the discussions, the learning & the pressure to do a good show that constantly improves with feedback, trial & error.\n4. **Audio editing; things like;** removing clips, taps, coughs, umms, ahhs, removing irrelevant rants, special requests from guests, long pauses, and generally cleaning up the audio. In an average 1hr recording, often a full 10-20 minutes of these items gets cut out/deleted\n5. **Show description;** show notes & resource url’s; doing a descriptive write up for the show, usually with SEO in mind, as well as doing time-stamped show notes so people can quick flip through episodes to find points of interest. Also doing the required research to find the relevant url’s which were referenced in the interview.\n6. **Putting the episode live;** Google drive updating, website updating, hosting platform updating\n7. **Marketing;** twitter & discord, mentioning guests, gathering reviews on Spotify & Apple Podcasts, spreading the word\n\n\n**Costs I Have Personally Incurred + Help Request**\n\n1. I have personally paid approx $600 USD for Website design + build and initial podcast setup\n2. I have alos personally paid approx $4,100 USD in episode hard costs; 13 episodes @ $315 each\n\nI have thus far volunteered my time for all the Podcast Leadership work required to date including all items outlined above for the pre-launch & launch checklists above. Additionally, I have been paying out of pocket for all physical costs required for the hands-on editing, writing & website work to get the show where it is at today.\n\n**For further clarity; there ARE outsourced physical costs for most of the aspects related to PRE-LAUNCH items 1 & 2 as well as LAUNCH items 4, 5 & 6 and I have so far paid for ALL of them myself personally with no assistance from any source.**\n\nEach episode has physical costs over and above my volunteer time of approx. $315 per episode which includes all of the time-consuming aspects of items the LAUNCH checklist items 4, 5 & 6 above.\n\n**Also for further clarity; I do NOT run a podcast editing company nor do I intend to, I did NOT have a profit or operating margin in the aforementioned costs and was 100% a community volunteer. This proposal includes a very small budget for my time moving forward.**\n\n\n**Challenges**\n\nI will not be able to continue carrying these costs on-going. These will need to be covered somehow, community willing; ideally by the treasury via this funding proposal.\n\nAlso community willing, I have 2 further support personnel requests;\n1. I’d like a short term assistant/helper to help with guest recruitment. I’ll provide the checklists, leadership & coordination for all aspects related to this. The purpose is to help with sourcing out email contact info for relevant potential guests and helping me with an aggressive outreach for political members across the globe to come on the show plus help with pre-show research prep. This would either be on a volunteer basis by a CityDAO community member or a casual/part-time paid/bounty role. A helper is not an urgent need nor is it absolutely necessary, however it would really help take a bit of pressure off my shoulders!\n2. I’d like some marketing support. People who can help me tweeting & re-tweeting episodes across their social networks and leaving positive reviews on Apple Podcasts and Spotify. This helps guests feel special, helps us recruit more guests and helps the Podcast gain the visibility it needs to become an authority presence in the DAO ecosystem overall for CityDAO to leverage from.\n\n\n**Roadmap**\n\n**4th Qtr 2021 (completed)**\n- Discuss Podcast concept\nSetup Podcast framework, checklists, website & hosting\nBegin recording guests for the Podcast Launch\n\n**1st Qtr 2022 (completed)**\n- Launch the Podcast and establish initial traction\nPrepare this document for community input\n\n**NOW**\n- Obtain ALL answers to community questions outlined in this document & carry out any related actionable items\n\n**2nd Qtr 2022**\n- Book, record & publish several episodes with bigger name thought leaders & politicians\n\n**3rd Qtr 2022**\n- Heavy marketing of the Podcast with intent on establishing CityDAO as an authority presence and bridge between present day politicians & Web3\n- Continue booking & publishing bigger name episodes with thought leaders & politicians\n\n4th Qtr 2022\n- Continued marketing + episodes launches\n- Get CityDAO included in political panels, debates & inner circle strategy meetings with politicians interested in further exploring DAO’s\n- Evaluate 2022 progress & develop 2023 Roadmap\n\n\n**My Background**\n\nSee Forum Document and scroll to bottom for more about me: https://forum.citydao.io/t/cip-38-podcast-funding-request-progress-update/1103 \n\n**Also:**\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/memebrains \n- Mental Health Podcast: https://rockbottom2rockinit.com/ \n- Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-gilbert-williams/ \n- Discord: @memebrains#0677\n- Website: https://ericgilbertwilliams.com/ \n- Primary Occupation: CEO @ https://meme.market/home ",

      "title": "CIP-35 Core Team Rewards ",
      "content": "### Summary:\n\nOver the last 8 months, the Core Team laid groundwork for CityDAO - including acquiring Parcel 0 and setting up the legal infra for CityDAO LLC, Parcel 0, and the land drop. As we decentralize operations and welcome the council, this proposal seeks to reward contributors upon success criteria like the Parcel 0 Launch and Operating Agreement. This proposal grants 281 out of the 2,000 reserved contributor Citizen NFTs for core team members.\n\n### Background:\n\nAt the outset, 2,000 NFTs were set aside for core team members, contributors, partnerships, awards, and bounties. There has been no consistent ongoing rewards for core team and contributors. Rewards were issued sporadically, so we propose the following adjustments. This issues a one time compensation event that represents the work the core team, contributors, and more recently council has done over the past 6 months of DAO existence.\n\n## Rewards shall be issued in full upon Success Criteria below being met:\n\n- Parcel 0 legal docs complete (conservation agreement or NFT holder agreement in place)\n- Parcel 0 land drop executed on\n- Operating Agreement is instituted for CityDAO LLC\n\n## Rewards authorization:\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ggKvbou9MLWBfFP-B_sVPYVxXKVqNGv-3MZLPn3SLY/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ggKvbou9MLWBfFP-B_sVPYVxXKVqNGv-3MZLPn3SLY/edit#gid=0)\n\nCurrently, no ongoing rewards are authorized and ongoing comp will be handled in a separate proposal.  \n\n## Notes:\n- These rewards are not vested since they represent rewards for 8 months of prior work. Future comp will be vested.\n- This proposal is meant to replace all prior rewards, including mandating the return of NFTs in some case. There was some NFTs previously issued explained in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ggKvbou9MLWBfFP-B_sVPYVxXKVqNGv-3MZLPn3SLY/edit#gid=0) compiled by Alex who audited the NFT outflows. \n",

      "content": "This proposal is to remediate approximately 29.1 ETH in lost funds due to the social engineering attack on January 10, 2022. This amount is approximate and subject to change based on further investigations into some of the claims. All remediation requests will be verified by the core team prior to payment.\n\nWe will also have the option of repaying gas spent on fraudulent transactions.\n\n- If you think the DAO should repay both lost funds and gas, please vote “Remediate Lost ETH + Gas Costs”.\n- If you think the DAO should only repay lost funds, please vote “Remediate Lost ETH Only”. \n- If you think the DAO should remediate some percentage of lost funds, please vote “Partially Remediate Lost ETH Only” (Note: if this option wins, we will have a second vote to determine the %). \n- If you think the DAO should not remediate any lost funds, please vote “Do Not Remediate”.\n\nHow vote counting will work:\n\nTo avoid a situation in which the vote is split fairly evenly, resulting in no remediation winning despite >50% of votes being in favor of remediation in some capacity, the option “Do Not Remediate” will have to receive >50% of all votes to win. If not, it will be removed from the options.\n\nIf “Do Not Remediate” receives <50% of all votes and is removed from the options, we will move to “Partially Remediate Lost ETH Only”. To avoid a similar situation, this option will have to receive >50% of all votes minus the votes counted for “Do Not Remediate”. If it does not receive enough votes, it will be removed from the options and we will evaluate the final two.\n\nIn evaluating the final two options, the option with the greater number of votes will win.",

The parcel borders the Shoshone National Forest in Clark County, Wyoming, and this action helps establish CityDAO as a good neighbor. This is also motivated by the fact the parcel is zoned for only one single family house and the terrain is uneven for building on most of the parcel.\n- Authorize up to 2.5 ETH from treasury to fund cameras and sensors outlined in the CIP-14 forum post. Specifically, a camera live stream of the parcel, live temperature sensor, and LTE IoT devices to send the data back, and for dev team to create a dashboard for viewing the camera, temperature, and IoT data.\n- Authorize up to 2.5 ETH from the treasury for signage design, printing, and installation on the property for indicating that CityDAO is dedicating the property to conservation and offering visitors a collectible NFT.\n- Authorize up to 2.5 ETH to buy a drone, pay an operator or videography production company to fly it around and create a promotional video.\n",

This included distance to an airport, maximizing freedom of zoning, ease of access via road, and available resources like water and power. We have debated different options and have an ongoing discussion in Discourse here.\n\nSummaries, listing info, and virtual tours of our top parcels are at the bottom of this proposal.\n\n### Caveats\n- The ability to use any of the land may be limited by Wyoming state law, Clark County law, and CityDAO, especially if its in a subdivision (see notion) which can impose additional rules.\n- Further decisions are needed around mechanisms for land tokenization (lease, easements, community governance, etc) and will be decided in separate proposals.\n- CityDAO is operating in a legally novel zone and is a risky project.\n\n### Voting Guide\nResearch (see below resources) and select your favorite parcel. You can ask questions and discuss in Discord town-square-text channel. You may vote on a parcel, or vote to postpone the vote and propose a new parcel or ask for more discussion and research.\n\n### Resources\n\nWe have debated different options and have an ongoing discussion in Discourse.\n[https://forum.citydao.io/t/land-selection-discussion/15](https://forum.citydao.io/t/land-selection-discussion/15)\n\nSummaries, listing info, and virtual tours of our top parcels:\n[https://citydao.notion.site/Parcel-0-Selection-Parcels-e25f25978d094ff5b15021eb4ddf425b](https://www.notion.so/Parcel-0-Selection-e25f25978d094ff5b15021eb4ddf425b)",

      "content": "```\nCIP: 2\ntitle: Adopt Governance Process for CityDAO Improvement Proposals\nauthor: Justin Kalland\nstatus: Phase-2\ncreated: 2021-09-09\n```\n\n[👉 Link to CIP-2 Proposal Thread](https://forum.citydao.io/t/phase-2-cip-2-adopt-governance-process-for-citydao-improvement-proposals/27)\n\n# Simple Summary\nFormalize the detailed process for proposing, voting, and adopting CIPs (CityDAO Improvement Proposals).\n\n# Abstract\nThis proposal provides a detailed structured process for CityDAO governance proposals. Any individual or entity wishing to create a proposal and put it up to vote will need to go through those steps to ensure that its proposal is detailed enough to be voted on and its implementation enforceable.\n\n# Motivation\nAs the DAO matures we have more citizens wanting to participate in governance. There has been confusion on how to do this. We need a process that is fair and easy to follow, while ensuring a bare minimum quality and avoiding voter fatigue.\n\n# Specification\nThe CityDAO governance process is primarily conducted using the [CIPs category ](https://forum.citydao.io/c/cips/5). For a proposal to be accepted, it must successfully pass through three phases:\n\n## Phase 1: Ideation\nThis phase facilitates an initial, informal discussion on these forums regarding potential proposals. You can initiate a proposal in Phase 1 by posting your idea in the[ CIPs category ](https://forum.citydao.io/c/cips/5) with the phase-1 tag. This phase allows proposals to gather community insight for refinement before opening a formal poll.\n\n**Duration:** Open-ended\n\n**Passing Requirement:** For proposals to successfully pass from Phase 1 to Phase 2, there is no formal requirement. However, if a Phase 1 proposal discussion fails to garner any momentum from the community, it is unlikely to become a successful proposal.\n\n## Phase 2: Specification\n\nThis phase requires proposals to be posted in a new dedicated thread the [CIPs category ](https://forum.citydao.io/c/cips/5) using the CityDAO Improvement Proposal (CIP) template. You can create a CityDAO Improvement Proposal (CIP) easily by adding the CIP subcategory, after which your draft post will automatically be populated by a CIP template for you to fill in. You can move a proposal to Phase 2 by posting the CIP-# with the phase-2 tag.\n\nThe CIP template recommends that all proposals should contain the following fields when applicable , such as a Simple Summary, Abstract, Motivation and Specification.\nIn addition to these fields, Phase 2 proposals must also include a link to a 3-day long signalling poll on CityDAO Snapshot page about the proposal outcome (that contains the proposal text as well as a link to the HIP post on the forum), and it must include the option *Make no changes*. The Phase 2 proposal poll on Snapshot **should be prefixed by [Signalling]** to differentiate them from binding Phase 3 proposal votes*. Each Citizen NFT gets one vote.\n\n> *In the near future, if we are able to create polls on the forum only open to Discourse accounts linked to a Citizen NFT, then the signalling poll could be done on the forum. This change would require a new CIP.\n\n**Duration:** 3 days\n\n**Passing Requirement:** For proposals to successfully pass from Phase 2 to Phase 3, there must be one outcome with a relative majority of votes on the snapshot poll. If the relative majority of votes on the snapshot poll indicates the result *Make no changes*, the proposal will not pass to Phase 3.\n\n## Phase 3: Consensus\n\nMove a proposal to Phase 3 by editing the CIP post from the previous phase to reflect the snapshot signalling poll result that received a relative majority of votes and by updating the proposal’s tag to phase-3. This serves to refine the proposal for the final phase.\n\nAdditionally, a CityDAO proposal must be created on Snapshot (that contains the proposal text as well as a link to the CIP post on the forum), **it must be prefixed by [Binding]** and it must include the option *Make no changes*. Each Citizen NFT gets one vote.\n\n**Duration:** 7 days\n\n**Passing Requirement:** For proposals to be accepted in this final phase, there must be one outcome with a relative majority of votes in the Snapshot proposal. If the relative majority of votes on the proposal indicates the result *Make no changes*, the proposal will not be accepted and considered closed.\n\n---\n\nAny snapshot proposal not following these guidelines can be considered non-binding.\n\nMany thanks to teams in the ecosystem including PoH, Gnosis, Balancer and Uniswap, which inspired this governance process.\n\n# CIP Template\n\n```\nCIP: <Number to be assigned>\ntitle: <CIP title>\nauthor: <a list of the author's or authors' name(s) and/or username(s), or name(s) and email(s),\nstatus: Draft\ncreated: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>\nrequires (*optional): <CIP number(s)>\nreplaces (*optional): <CIP number(s)>\n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\n(Required for Phase 1)\n\nIf you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough. Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the CIP.\n\n## Abstract\n\n(Required for Phase 1)\n\nA short (~200 word) description of the issue being addressed.\n\n## Motivation\n\n(Required for Phase 1)\n\nThe motivation is critical for CIPs that want to allocate funding or change the DAO. CIP posts without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.\n\n## Specification\n\n(Required for Phase 2)\n\nThe technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow for it to be reasoned about by participants in CityDAO.\n\n## Rationale\n\n(Recommended for Phase 2)\n\nThe rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.\n\n## Implementation\n\n(If necessary, recommended for Phase 3)",
