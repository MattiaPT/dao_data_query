The protocol income stream needs to be distributed accordingly in order to have positive network effects that lead to organic and sustainable long term growth of the protocol. \n\nBelow we highlight the pros and cons and also some concerns voiced by the community during our preliminary discussion on Discord.\n\nPros:\n1) Value accrues to DFD holders which is essential to strengthen the ecosystem as their incentivization is critical for the stability module and protocol governance.\n2) Given there is enough price appreciation created by the DFD buybacks there can be a surge in DUSD supply as more people would want to participate in yield farms using DUSD pools to farm DFD. This would lead to positive network effects.\n\nCons:\n1) ibDUSD has 4.2mn DUSD locked in at the time of writing. Depending on the vote the interest rate that these users receive will be impacted.\n2) The savings product will become less incentivized in the short term till network effects of the buyback are realized.\n\nNote: Your DFD ballet across all farming pools will be picked up automatically! i.e. you will not need to unstake DFD to vote in case you are yield farming in any of the active pools.\n",
