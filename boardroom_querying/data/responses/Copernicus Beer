      "title": "DAO Funding for Participation in NFC Lisbon",
      "content": "Dear DAO Members,\n\nThe Copernicus Beer Project is at an exciting turning point. As my grandfather always said, \"You never know how a cow catches a hare.\" Now we want to seize the opportunity to share our vision with a broader audience and attract new brewers. That's why we're planning to participate in NFC Lisbon, one of the world's largest NFT conferences, with over 3,500 enthusiastic attendees.\n\n### What We Plan to Do\n\nWe've secured a booth where we can sell Copernicus beer and promote our project. We're also participating in an Augmented Reality (AR) treasure hunt, where we can reward winners with a refreshing cold beer. Additionally, we have the opportunity to speak on the main stage, which is a fantastic chance to share our story.\n\nWhile this all sounds exciting, our primary focus is on attracting new brewers from outside the Netherlands. This would be a significant step forward for the Copernicus Beer Project. We believe that we can find at least six potential brewers at this event.\n\n### The Request\n\nTo participate in NFC Lisbon and capitalize on the opportunities this event presents, we're requesting 3,000 euros from the DAO Treasury Liquidity. This accounts for approximately 30% of the Treasury's total funds. With this financing, we can cover 50% of the estimated total costs of approximately 6,000 euros. These consist of\n- Payment for the booth space (€3,000 excluding VAT), which is an essential part of our event presence.\n- Transportation of the beer from Amsterdam to Lissabon (approx. €775 excluding VAT).\n- The beer itself, of which the sale might not be profitable\n- Promotional material (banners, t-shirts etc.)\n- Travel expenses\n\nThese remaining expenses, including the time and effort put into this activity, will be borne by individual DAO members and are their responsibility.\n\nAdditionally, this funding will allow us to offer six tickets to DAO members who wish to attend the event. Each ticket has a value of 600 euros excluding VAT.\n\nWith this investment from the DAO Treasury, we can ensure our presence at NFC Lisbon and lay a solid foundation for the Copernicus Project to grow. The goal is to attract new brewers from other countries by selling four tokens valued at 1,000 euros each. Furthermore, we can give people who want to leave the DAO the opportunity to sell their tokens. \n\n### Invitation for Participation and Feedback\n\nWe invite all DAO members to contribute their thoughts and ideas for our participation in NFC Lisbon. We are curious about your suggestions for the design of our booth, what to include under the QR codes, and other creative ways to make our presence at the event a success.\n\nWe hope this proposal gains your support and that we can take this project to a new level together. All help and feedback are welcome!\n\nRegards,\n#QR08, #QR10, #QR11, #QR14 and #QR18",

      "title": "Copernicus Beer Brew Program (CBBP)",
      "content": "### Why?\n\nThe Copernicus Beer Brew Program (CBBP) is designed to attract new participants by encouraging them to brew beer. By offering rewards and support, the program aims to create a vibrant community of brewers who contribute to the growth and innovation of the Copernicus Beer DAO.\n\n### What?\n\nThe CBBP is a year-long program that provides a structured path for new brewers to receive rewards from the Copernicus Beer DAO. Participants can earn rewards from the Copernicus Beer DAO's vault by meeting specific criteria and requirements outlined below.\n\n### When?\n\nThe program runs for one year, beginning on May 27th 2024. \n\n## Brew Program Criteria\n\n### Eligibility\n\nBrewers who are approved to participate in the CBBP can earn rewards from the Copernicus Beer DAO's vault. To be eligible, participants must meet the following criteria:\n\n- Be a member of the Copernicus Beer DAO.\n- Complete a basic onboarding process to understand the DAO's rules and brewing practices.\n- Agree to follow the DAO's code of conduct and ethical brewing guidelines.\n\n### Brew Cost Coverage\n\nParticipants in the CBBP can receive support for brewing costs based on the number of batches they brew:\n\n- **First batch**: Full cost coverage for the first 500 bottles or up to $500, whichever is lower.\n- **Second batches**: Full cost coverage for the first 500 bottles or up to $500, whichever is lower.\n\nThe batches needs to be finalised before may 27th,  2025. This structure is designed to encourage brewers to continue brewing while balancing the DAO's resources.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n### Do I need to be onboarded or complete the CBBP to start brewing Copernicus Beer?\n\nNo, participation in the CBBP is not a prerequisite for brewing Copernicus Beer. Any DAO member can start brewing at any time. However, by joining the CBBP, you gain additional support and access to rewards that can enhance your brewing experience. Participation is encouraged for those who want to accelerate their brewing journey and access additional resources.\n\n### What kind of rewards can I receive from the CBBP?\n\nThe reward structure depends on the number of batches you brew, as described above. Rewards can include cost coverage, access to additional support, and other resources to help you in your brewing journey.\n\n### How can I apply to the CBBP?\n\nTo apply to the CBBP, submit an application form through the Copernicus Beer Website. The form will ask for basic information about your brewing experience, your goals within the DAO, and any relevant experience with DAO governance. Successful applicants will be notified and onboarded into the program.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe hope this proposal receives your support and helps strengthen the Copernicus Beer DAO by attracting new participants through the Copernicus Beer Brew Program. Your approval will enable us to create a robust framework for encouraging brewing and supporting new brewers.\n\nThank you for your consideration.",

To access the funds, a minimum of three out of the five members must provide their approval.\n\nCurrent Custodian:\nHans will continue to manage the wallet, similar to his existing role with the Copernicus Account (eth:0x5d91Eb912928C009675D606123E91e1f788B8085). The assets will be transferred from the current account to the new multisig wallet.\n\nNext Steps:\nI propose that we move forward with the creation of the multisig wallet and the associated setup on https://safe.global/. Upon approval, Hans will initiate the transfer of assets to the newly established multisig wallet.\n\nVoting:\nPlease express your support or concerns regarding this proposal. \nCurrently consensus is reached when 1/3 of the tokens that is not in the vault vote in favour of a proposal. A minimum quorum of 7 (of 20 tokens) is required for the proposal to be accepted.\n\nYour feedback and active participation in this decision-making process are highly valued. Let's work together to enhance the security and resilience of Copernicus Beer DAO.\n\nKeep the beer Safe!",

This proposal addresses the tokens with the following ID’s: 12,17, 23 and 24.\n\nThe proposal is as follows:\n1. We make remaining tokens available for a 1000 euro equivalent in Ethereum each for individuals who are enthusiastic about joining the DAO.\n2. In order to ensure that new token holders are truly committed to contributing to the DAO, require that they meet with existing members in person or via a video conference call in order to enable the current token holders to form an opinion of the commitment of the candidate DAO member. \n3. The current token holders are advised to choose new token holders with skills and abilities that are not yet sufficiently available among the current token holders.\n4. We vote for each new member, in which existing members vote on whether or not to accept the new member into the DAO. The current consensus rule applies: ⅓ of the token holders has to vote in favour of the proposal. The voting period is 3 days.\n5.

This will result in approximately 3800 bottles with a red cap for about 5100 euro.\n\nFinancing:\nWe would like to get a loan from the DAO vault for our part of the tokens that are currently in possession by all members. Currently, there are 18 tokens assigned, so the fraction will be 1/18 per token. With the current vault containing 1.82 eth, and four tokens in our possession, we would like to lend 0.4 eth worth in USDT and repay the 10% also in USDT. With the current ETH rate, we will contribute 80 euro.\n\nContribution to the DAO\nBesides the interest on a loan from the vault, we will do the following:\nFor every bottle of Copernicus Beer sold, we contribute 0.05 EUR to the DAO, in total 190 EUR. \n\nLicensing:\nWe request the DAO to licence the brew result, thus providing us with the label design to sell the beer as real Copernicus Beer. We are willing to pay the Bas van der Paardt to adjust the current label for our batch with a new best before date. The price for this effort has to be negotiated.\n\nDiscount for DAO members:\nDAO Members that participate in this batch, can buy Copernicus Beer at a discounted price. The discount will be 10% of the retail price including VAT. This is also for encouraging DAO members to act as reseller.\n\nResume:\nWe request:\nThe license to brew 1300 liters of Copernicus Beer\nAdjustment of the label with a new best before date\n\nWe deliver:\n1300 liters of beer in 3800 bottles\n10% interest for our 4 tokens, generating a contribution of approx. 80 EUR. to the DAO\n0.05 EUR for every bottle sold, with a maximum of 190 EUR will be contributed to the DAO\n\nDelivery date:\nApprox 20 juli 2022",

The brewing cost will amount to round about EUR 4.000,-  and I will cover for those myself.\nOn top of that I will sponsor the DAO with the amount of 0,1 ETH  to 0x5d91Eb912928C009675D606123E91e1f788B8085 (our DAO's vault)\nThis (0,1 ETH-) amount has no destiny yet. See it as building  or topping up the DAO-equity.  I can imagine  that, in another instance we decide to agree to spend some on marketing or product development or so, we'll see.\nGiven the enthusiasm and reactions on the beautifully brewed previous batch of @Hansie  (applause!), there's just not enough beer yet. Huzzah!\nDOA members can order beer from this batch with receive  a \"10%-discount off\" of the original retail price (EUR 55,00 - 5,50 = EUR 49,50) per box. (unit 1 or more boxes)\n\nREQUEST permission to:\n- Brew batch nr. 4 at Bierbrouwerij Wentersch\n- Change the label with new exp. date  (probably 07-2023, depending on actual brew date)\n- Add \"batch nr. 4\" to the label. (in whatever form, can be #4 or B04 or what fits on the label.\n- Change the label with \"Brewed at Bierbrouwerij Wentersch B.V. te Winterswijk\"\n- Change the label with \"correct address, t.b.n.\"\n- Change the Copernicus logo with the \"Copernicus-with-red cap on-his-head\" one.\n- Order coasters (bierviltjes) with logo.\n- Order 4-pack packaging with logo.",
