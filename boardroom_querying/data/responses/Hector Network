      "title": "HIP 42: Redemption of the $HEC",
      "content": "Dear Hectorians,\n\nDue to the recent MultiChain hack and its unfortunate impact on the Fantom ecosystem, especially on the stablecoin market, we regret to inform you that Hector Network has suffered significant damage to its ability to operate.\n\nThe team took risk management and loss reduction steps to ensure that the loss to the treasury is reduced as much as possible. Despite that, there are $16.06MM in treasury assets and 1,041,483 $HEC tokens in the Treasury.\n\nFor that reason, we propose either\n\n(i) *the liquidation of Hector Network and redemption of the $HEC token against the funds in the treasury* or\n\n(ii) *migration of Hector Network and the $HEC token to a different chain (to be decided later) under a different brand*.\n\nIt is important to note that, in order to avoid manipulation and purchases of tokens by people with $HEC tokens acquired after the snapshots taken on\n\n>Fantom (block 65774322 - Jul-14-2023 12:00:00 PM +UTC - https://ftmscan.com/block/65774322)\n\nand\n\n>BSC (block 29954999 - Jul-14-2023 12:00:02 PM +UTC - https://bscscan.com/block/29954999)\n\nwhich corresponds with the time when the decision to propose this HIP was made, will be excluded from the treasury assets redistribution. This measure is taken to protect fairness of the process and ensures that no one can benefit at the expense of other members.\n\nFurther on the $HEC held by the Hector Network treasury will not be considered for the purpose of redistribution.\n\n## IMPORTANT\n\nBefore redistribution of the treasury assets to the $HEC token holders, all contractual, statutory and other legal obligations, including costs of the liquidation, must be fully settled.\n\n## Voting options:\n\n**LIQUIDATION**: I agree with the liquidation of Hector Network and redistribution of all assets present in the treasury as of the day of liquidation to the $HEC token holders proportionally to the amount of $HEC held by each holder.\n\n**MIGRATION**: I agree with the migration of Hector Network, all assets in the treasury and the $HEC token to an alternate chain (to be decided later) under a different brand, while $HEC token holders shall retain their token holder rights.\n\nIn order to prevent further negative impact the MultiChain hack may have on the Hector Network treasury, **the voting period for this HIP is set to 48 hours** from the time of posting.",

      "content": "Dear Hectorians\n\nWith the continuous evolution of our products and the recent release of the beta version of our new dApp, which includes MultiPay and Tax Reports, we now invite you to contribute to the decision-making process regarding the allocation of fees for the buyback and burn of HEC tokens. We are thrilled to offer this direct utility for our HEC token through our products and we expect that with the greater traction of our services in the future, this allocation will create increased buying and burning pressure within the HEC ecosystem. \n\n#### Proposal:\nWe propose the following options for the percentage allocation of collected fees:\n\n1. Allocate 50% of collected fees for buyback and burn of HEC tokens.\n2. Allocate 60% of collected fees for buyback and burn of HEC tokens.\n3. Allocate 70% of collected fees for buyback and burn of HEC tokens.\n\n#### Why not more than 70%?\nTo ensure sustainable operations and continued development, it is important to maintain a minimum of 30% of the profits in the Treasury. This will provide direct revenues for financing operational needs and further advancements.\n\nYour participation and input are invaluable in shaping the future of the Hector Network ecosystem. We encourage you to carefully review the proposal and cast your vote for one of the three options.\n\nThank you for being an integral part of our community and for your contribution to the governance of the Hector Network.\n\nHector Network team",

      "title": "HIP 40: Forming A Company, Articles Of Association,  DAO Charter",
      "content": "Hello Hectorians,\n\nHector Network introduces the community to a proposal for establishing a legal structure for the DAO through this HIP. Currently the DAO is not set in any specific jurisdiction and does not have a set corporate form. In order to cooperate with other companies/projects in the future, a legal entity setup is strongly recommended.\n\nHector Network has engaged legal consultation from our legal partner Sparring, to provide us with advice in regards to setting up a legal structure. The objective of implementing this legal structure is to create an optimal framework for the future direction of the DAO and its governance, while also prioritising risk mitigation measures. \n\nSparring advised that:\n\n> *“To avoid future legal, regulatory and tax uncertainty, the DAO should be anchored (legally wrapped) in a specific jurisdiction as soon as possible. Since the DAO currently is not formally set up anywhere, we can choose the ideal jurisdiction to be used from now on.”*\n\nThere are two parts of establishing a proper structure for Hector Network:\n\n### A. SETTING UP A CORPORATE STRUCTURE\nOur legal counsels have prepared a corporate structure that is truly suited for Hector Network’s operations. Sparring considers it important to consider the following factors when choosing a jurisdiction:\n\n“***Local regulation and licensing requirements*** *- the DAO will have to comply with all local regulation of crypto, tokens, investments, etc. Therefore, choosing an EU jurisdiction will be extremely complicated from a regulatory perspective and a crypto-friendly jurisdiction is desirable (e.g. Caymans, Switzerland), while taking into account the following:*\n\n* *Tax consequences*\n* *Corporate law - some countries allow for a very flexible setup while others require rigid structures with fixed owners and managers (most of the EU)*\n* *Possibility of a bank account opening*\n* *Costs related to DAO legal entity management”*\n\nThe team spoke with several local counsels in different jurisdictions and cooperated with an extra international tax lawyer and considered most of the traditional crypto friendly jurisdictions, including, among others, Marshall Islands and Switzerland.\n\nOn the Marshall Islands (MI) we were in the process of forming a temporary holding company for the Hector Network DAO, however Marshall Islands do not offer a sufficiently flexible ownerless legal form which would fit our purposes.\n\nIn Switzerland, it can take up to 6 months for the local regulator (FINMA) to determine the status of the HEC token with a high probability that this would be considered a security token. Additionally, stablecoins are under heavy regulation in Switzerland and licensing would be needed.\n\nTherefore, the team came up with the following solution, which nowadays represents the highest market standard:\n\n#### **1. Cayman Foundation Company**\nThis is the parent entity of the structure holding all of Hector Network intellectual property and off-chain assets. It is set up as an ownerless foundation, which means that it has no shareholders or owners but exists to fulfil its purpose which is to serve as the DAO legal wrapper of the Hector Network. \n\nIn addition, the Foundation Company’s role will be, among other things, to:\n\n* Administer the treasury\n* Administer grants\n* Administer on-chain governance process\n* Facilitate proposals\n* Facilitate voting\n\nThere will be two professional directors appointed to act for the company on behalf of Hector Network, namely:\n\n* [https://www.conyers.com/](https://www.conyers.com) (Conyers)\n* [https://marfire.co/](https://marfire.co/) (Marfire)\n\nHector Network will have three supervisors appointed to oversee the actions of the directors and communicate the decisions of the Hector Network community to the directors. The initial supervisors will be: \n\n* Farooq - TG: @qboy29\n* Leonida - TG: @thisisleonidahec\n* Zeus - TG: @Zeus_HEC\n\nThe company will be governed by its ***Articles of Association*** (click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r0H37obw6WVVIFK6_hH0-Q2_LIG1J6fS/view?usp=share_link) to read) and the ***DAO Charter*** (click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BujOdpg83G4riDAwW_1aOjcLnP7FPdgK/view?usp=share_link) to read), as further explained under point B. of this HIP below, which will constitute companies bylaws, the internal binding governance document of the company. \n\n#### **2. British Virgin Islands Operating Company**\nThe existing Hector Network company in the BVI will remain and its ownership will be fully transferred to the Cayman Foundation Company. Its purpose will be to execute contracts for Hector Network and be responsible for the issuance of any tokens. \n\nIn addition to the above, the Operating Company’s role will be, among other things to: \n\n* Enter into services agreements with service providers\n* Enter into agreements with other projects/companies\n* Hire or dismiss contractors\n* Pay invoices\n\n***The director Conyers of the Cayman Foundation Company will also serve as the director of the BVI company***. Having the BVI company also helps split risk since it will enter into most contracts and partnerships and thus protect the assets held by the Cayman Foundation Company.  \n\n#### **3. Why was this structure chosen?**\nDAOs without legal personality, among other things, face regulatory and legal problems. These include in particular:\n \n* broad liability of DAO members for the organization's actions and other activities, \n* inability to enter into contracts with potential business partners, \n* inability to employ staff, \n* difficulties in opening bank accounts,\n* uncertain tax position, \n* insufficient protection of intellectual property rights, or \n* inability to hold property and assets.  \n\nThe types of legal entities and the chosen jurisdictions (Cayman Islands Foundation and BVI LLC) are the best fit for the overall operations of the Hector Network DAO from the organisational, regulatory and legal point of view.\n\n#### **4. Timeline**\nThe structure can be formed within approximately 14 days from the resolution of the HIP. \n\n### B. ADOPTING OUR FIRST EVER DAO CHARTER\nSince the creation of Hector Network over a year ago we have been dealing with constant changes in our operations, setup and governance. Now the time has come to vote on binding rules for the operation of Hector Network which will ensure our continued operation under a proper set of rules. The DAO Charter will work as a constitution of Hector Network, setting out our principles, member rights, as well as the rights and obligations of each body within our organisation. \n\nAmong other things, the DAO Charter will: \n\n1. Define the DAO and its membership.\n1. Establish the DAO bodies. \n1. Set up DAO governance rules and other processes.\n\nThe adoption of the DAO Charter includes appointing the members of the initial bodies. These initial appointments are: \n\nSteering Committee: \n\n* Seat 1: Bart - TG: @Bart_R\n* Seat 2: Leonida - TG: @thisisleonidahec\n* Seat 3: Farooq - TG: @qboy29\n* Seat 4: H V - TG: @aka_quizman\n* Seat 5: Helen - TG: @Manifesting_Generator\n* Seat 6: Ina - TG: @Ina178\n* Seat 7: MayoMyke: TG: @MAYOMyke\n* Seat 8: Sonoro: TG: @Sonorooo\n* Seat 9: Zeus - TG: @Zeus_HEC\n* Seat 10: Alessio - TG: @Alessiomiz\n* Seat 11: Frizey - TG: @Frizey_HEC\n\nMultisig Holders:\n\n* Multisig holder 1: Bart - TG @Bart_R\n* Multisig holder 2: Farooq - TG:@Qboy29\n* Multisig holder 3: Gaikotsu - TG: @Gaikotsu_HEC\n* Multisig holder 4: Helen - TG: @Manifesting_Generator\n* Multisig holder 5: Ina - TG: @Ina178\n* MultiSig holder 6: Leonida - TG: @thisisleonidahec\n* Multisig holder 7: Michael - TG: @michaelnguyen102\n* Multisig holder 8: Myke - TG: @MAYOMyke\n* Multisig holder 9: Zeus - TG: @Zeus_HEC\n\n—\n\n***VOTING OPTIONS: ***\n\n1. **YES**, I agree with the adoption of the new Hector Network DAO corporate structure, incorporation documents and bylaws (the DAO Charter). This includes approval of the appointments of the initial Steering Committee members and Multisig Holders of the DAO, directors and supervisors of the Cayman Foundation Company, and the director of the BVI company. \n\n1. **NO**, I do not agree with the above proposal.",

      "title": "HIP 39 Bi-Annual Budget Proposal",
      "content": "Hello Hectorians,\n\nHere we are at the end of another budget period. Over the past six months, Hector Network has faced significant challenges, which have been acknowledged by the community. \n\nConsequently, the team has concluded that a change of direction is necessary and an action needs to be taken to ensure a sustainable future for our community. \n\nWith that in mind, we have identified weaknesses in our project, and with the vision and input from our Oracles, we've decided that the upcoming budget period and beyond needs to focus on developing products and services that generate revenue in the volatile crypto market and simultaneously create utility for HEC.\n\nTo improve the efficiency of our projects, we made some important changes.\n \nFirstly, we stopped working with AETSoft on the development of Atlantica MarketPlace, the Atlantica LaunchPad, the Library, Symfonya and the Token Launchpad.\nNext, we took a closer look at all of our developments and conducted an internal evaluation of all our sub-projects from the past six months.\n \nWe consulted with our Oracles and newly appointed Treasury and Investment manager, who has extensive experience in online business and finance. Our goal was to determine which projects are worth pursuing and which ones are less productive and less interesting.\n\nAfter careful consideration of the evaluation results and all input received, we decided to pause on the development of the Atlantica Launchpad, the Library and the Token Launchpad and to stop with the development of Symfonya. \n\nAs you can see in the budget overview for the next six months, by halting our cooperation with AETSoft and putting some development projects on hold or stopping them completely we will save $1,894,000. \n\nFurther, development of the Atlantica MarketPlace in-house, will save us $731,000 in development costs. Overall, as a result of decisions made, a total of $2,625,000 in expenses will be saved. \n\nWe believe that decisions made will help us allocate our resources more effectively and make the best use of our budget. During the next budget period, we plan to closely monitor the progress and results of our sub-projects so that necessary changes, if needed, can be taken in a timely manner. At the end of the upcoming budget period we plan to revisit our decisions on sub-projects, also on the paused ones, and evaluate whether continuing their development could contribute to the long-term success of Hector Network.\n\nOur objective is to establish a focused set of products and services that are powered by HEC and are desirable for users, projects, and companies. \n\nThis marks a new direction for Hector Network, with less emphasis on expenditure and greater emphasis on revenue generation, whilst minimizing risk and extending our runway ensuring that odds are stacked in our favor to capitalize on this emerging market sector. \nThe plan aims to position HEC as a utility token that everyone will want to hold in their wallets. We're excited for this new start and hope you'll join us on this journey.\n\nBefore you vote, please take the time to carefully review the proposal and attached documents, and let us know if you have any doubts or questions.\n\nHIP 39 Introduction document with links to all documents needed to read:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mx38PIdKdmydqP1mPY2mPyYygQJ2CgCV/view?usp=share_link\n\nVoting options:\n\n1. Yes, I agree with the budget\nThis will mean that you agree with the proposed budget of $1,843,800.00 for the next 6 months.\n\n2. NO, I disagree with the budget\nThis will mean that you are unhappy with the presented options and want the team to create a new proposal. During this period it is OK to pay the salaries to those working for the project.\n",

      "content": "HIP 38 has passed! The community has given the team permission to legally separate The Oikos project into its own company which will run and be governed independently of Hector Network. As a part of the detail the 3.6 M budget voted on in HIP 37 will become seed funding for the new company, entitling Hector Network to 12% of the profit of the new company in a profit transfer agreement. \n\nHIP 38A offers Hectorians an opportunity to increase the position in The Oikos from 3.6M (12%) to 5.6 M (additional 2M for a total of 17%). \n\nIf you would like to review the full proposal in context of HIP 38 please do so here: \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/10kcqCOR2GZXW0RFlhDY8fWEqivH6lDOR/view?usp=share_link\nMaking an additional investment into The Oikos \n\nIf the community commits an additional 2 Million to the project an additional 5% in profit entitlement would be written into the profit transfer agreement, making the share of profit owed to Hector Network 17% of the profit payout pool. \n\nThere are both risks and benefits associated with allocating additional funds towards The Oikos project. To be abundantly clear this is a decision that Hectorians need to make for themselves, and we will provide facts but attempt to remain as objective as possible in the discussion. We encourage heavy discussion in the community and will answer as many questions as humanly possible on this topic. \n\nBenefits: \nOf all the sub-brands developed by Hector Network, The Oikos has always represented the largest potential revenue stream. An additional 5% of profit could represent millions of dollars in steady yearly revenue in the future. \nThe additional investment could ensure a smooth launch for a key investment. An additional 2M upfront allows The Oikos team to extend the development runway from June 2023 (with budget to hire 4 people, CEO, CFO, COO, CMO) to into September and hire 17 people, (CEO, CFO, COO, CMO, CTO, Business Developer, Partnership Manager, Marketing Manager, Socials Manager, Accountant, Mod Staff for Social severs (x5) 2 Artists (for Marketing department). This extended staff greatly increases the company’s chances of swiftly landing key partnerships, landing venture capitalists and having successful NFT sales. \nRisks: \nShould The Oikos fail a larger share has been committed and is therefore lost, choosing to not invest further in The Oikos could provide more diversification to mitigate failure.\nIf the market conditions continue the additional 2M strain on the treasury could reduce Hector Network’s runway and perhaps the project would go broke before it is able to benefit from the profit of The Oikos. \nA 2M investment might perform better if invested in another way, and produce more ROI than with The Oikos \nA 2M investment might perform quicker if invested in another way, and return funds to the treasury before profit from The Oikos kicks in. \n\nTo make savvy investment decisions the community needs to understand where we stand in the current budget for the last 6 months and what sort of environment the next budget HIP will be in. \n\nCurrently we are just over half way through the budget period and we are significantly under budget. You can review the current budget position & predictions for budget remainders for the end of the period here. \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1TbRRJkcAv6_lxK4TSLWTod3DK9qcRSPu/view?usp=share_link\n\nFinal numbers for the budget for next period are still being tabulated but by all accounts the next period will require notably less funds than allocated for this one. Predictions put that budget between 4-7 M for the 6 month period of April 2023 through to September 2023, and as shown in the charts above some of those funds will be able to roll over from this period. This is largely due to development for several major projects wrapping up between this period and the next, and the high cost of development transitioning to the much lower cost of operations. \n\n\nThe voting options for HIP 38A:\n\n1. I want Hector Network to commit an additional 2 Million in exchange for a total of 17% of the profit payout pool. \n\n2. I do not want Hector Network to commit additional funds towards the new legal company, and am satisfied with 15% of the profit payout pool. \n\n3.

      "title": "HIP 38: Permission to form an autonomous legal entity to continue to develop The Oikos",
      "content": "Due to length restrictions on snapshot the full proposal could not be shared here, but the highlights are. We highly recommend that you review this document, which is the full HIP, including extended information, supplemental reading and more details. \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/10kcqCOR2GZXW0RFlhDY8fWEqivH6lDOR/view?usp=share_link\n\nWhat:\n\nWe’re asking our community for permission to create a new, separate legal entity for The Oikos. This newly formed company will operate with a traditional, doxxed C-Level structure, it will be centralized and run independently of, though in partnership with Hector Network. \n\nWhy: \n\nThe primary reason is our current DAO structure does not allow for equity investors (specifically Venture Capitalists) or equity partnerships. Ability to open up to this kind of funding dollars is crucial for The Oikos during the current market conditions. While we anticipate raising significant funds through land and a possible token sale (exact details of which are still being worked on with many factors at play including the game economics and regulation) it is unrealistic to assume we will be able to match the success of campaigns launched during the bull run from inside the bear market. We, as The Oikos team, need to diversify the origin of the development funds to ensure an undue burden is not placed on the DAO Treasury during development. \n\nAdditionally there are many strong advantages to structuring The Oikos into its own separate legal entity: \n1. Limited liability: Owners of a separate legal entity are generally not personally liable for the debts or obligations of the entity. This means that their personal assets are protected in the event that the company is sued or unable to pay its debts.\n2. Continued existence: A separate legal entity has its own legal existence and can continue to exist even if its executives leave or die. \n3. Professional image: A separate legal entity may be perceived as more professional and established than a sole proprietorship or partnership, which can help to attract customers and business partners.\n4. Tax benefits: In some cases, a separate legal entity may be able to take advantage of certain tax benefits, such as the ability to deduct business expenses and losses from personal income.\nPlease refer to the statement provided by the DAO’s lawyer team, who advised this course of action. These lawyers are retained by the DAO and will not be hired by the new company formed by The Oikos. They are morally and legally responsible to the DAO. \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1vkY0jOO6uZ6nkZZSTppdZ_Q3y12X8jEP/view?usp=sharing\n\nWhat does this mean for the DAO’s ownership of The Oikos? \n\nRestructuring the company in this manner would mean that Hector Network has no active ownership of The Oikos. The company operating The Oikos would have total autonomy to run the company and develop the game as it is needed, and future decisions would not be subject to HIPs. This move is crucial in opening up funding through selling equity shares. However, lack of ownership has very little effect on profit flows, which can entirely be controlled in the company structure and subsequent contracts. \n\nIn this proposal Hector Network and the newly formed company would sign a profit transfer agreement set up to entitle a fixed and predetermined portion of the profit of The Oikos to loop back to the DAO treasury. This model allows Hector Network to receive maximum benefits without the added liability of being so closely tied to a centralized company, and it is a useful option for entities who wish to receive return on their investment without the added risk and responsibility of ownership. \n\nOne of the prime roadblocks associated with the alternate option, becoming an Equity shareholder in the new company, is KYC. Investors at this level wish to be sure the funds going to start a company are from ethical and reputable sources. Normally part of the equity shareholder agreement is to KYC the officers, owners, or high level individuals involved in the company. This is impossible for a DAO as there are no officers, the funds in the company are collectively owned by the holders, and many of those holders are and will remain anonymous. \n\nWho Profits from The Oikos? \nHector Network and any Equity Shareholders! \n\nFirst understand the difference between Revenue and Profit. Revenue is the full sum of money brought into the project, while Profit represents the left over sums after operating expenses have been paid out. \n\nOnce these expenses are paid out from revenue the Project can report profit. According to each  agreement the profit can then be distributed between the shareholders, the profit transfer agreement, as well as a portion of the profit (exact % is still TBA, but likely to be between 15% and 35%) would be reinvested into The Oikos to fuel expansion and continued company development. \n\nAllocating funds for continued growth is crucial for expanding the company and will result in overall increase in revenue and also exposure for any integrated Hector Network products. \n\nThe profit payout pool is defined by profit - expansion investment and will be distributed yearly.\n\nHow are we structuring the company value and profit distribution? \n\nTo accurately and fairly value a company that does not yet exist can be a difficult task. To reach this valuation we took the average of a number valuations using several methods. \n \nMarket comparison - where we looked at the valuation of companies that are similar in nature to The Oikos and how that valuation has grown or changed over time. \n\nDiscounted Cash Flow - A method used to evaluate companies based on future revenue streams, where various revenue models were employed to give us high and low end valuations.\n\nBook Value - This method tracks the value of the asset of the company and builds the valuation from their worth. In the case of The Oikos, this is a hypothetical method since the company does not yet exists and the assets and IP are all in production. However, we used this to calculate what the game would cost to complete and how much we’d have to sell the company for once it was complete to break even. \n\nThrough our calculations and projections we set the valuation of the company at 50 Million USD. This is a relatively conservative valuation for a game of this nature, but as we are so early in development it is better to undervalue then over. \n\nNeuboution is an independent contractor we’ve worked with a number of times. They helped facilitate the partnership with BVB and have helped us make several crucial business contacts in the past. We asked them to do a valuation for The Oikos as well and it can be found here. \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/129Me0clEaajqTrsPt8fQvPXMhxdc7tVg/view?usp=share_link\n\nAt face value Hector Network has committed 3.6 Million USD in seed funding towards The Oikos, which is 7.2% of the overall valuation of the company.\n\nHowever, this does not factor in the additional costs shouldered by Hector Network during the pre-development of the game. Nor does it reflect the ongoing strong relationship that should always exist between the two companies. \n\nWe’re proposing rounding up the profit transfer agreement to an even 12%. \n\nThe portion of shares sold and agreements made can not be diluted without approval from the owner or beneficiary of those shares/ agreements. Once these agreements are signed into a legally binding contract they are non-dilutionairy without permission and consent of the signees, regardless of company valuation. In the case of Hector Network that would require a HIP and a renegotiation of the Profit Transfer Agreement. \n\nMaking an additional investment into The Oikos \n\nIf the community votes in favor of separating The Oikos a secondary HIP will be triggered providing the opportunity to make an additional investment into the new company. \n\nIf the community commits an additional 2 Million to the project an additional 5% in profit entitlement would be written into the profit transfer agreement, making the share of profit owed to Hector Network 17% of the profit payout pool. \n\nThere are both risks and benefits associated with allocating additional funds towards The Oikos project. To be abundantly clear this is a decision that Hectorians need to make for themselves, and we will provide facts but attempt to remain as objective as possible in the discussion. We encourage heavy discussion in the community and will answer as many questions as humanly possible on this topic.\n\nBenefits: \n* Of all the sub-brands developed by Hector Network, The Oikos has always represented the largest potential revenue stream. An additional 5% of profit could represent millions of dollars in steady yearly revenue in the future. \n* The additional investment could ensure a smooth launch for a key investment. An additional 2M upfront allows The Oikos team to extend the development runway from June 2023 (with budget to hire 4 people, CEO, CFO, COO, CMO) to into September and hire 17 people, (5 C-levels, Business Developer, Partnership Manager, Marketing Manager, Socials Manager, Accountant, Mod Staff for Social severs (x5) 2 Artists (for Marketing department). This extended staff greatly increases the company’s chances of swiftly landing key partnerships, landing venture capitalists and having successful NFT sales.\n\nRisks: \n* Should The Oikos fail a larger share has been committed and is therefore lost, choosing to not invest further in The Oikos could provide more diversification to mitigate failure.\n* If the market conditions continue the additional 2M strain on the treasury could reduce Hector Network’s runway and perhaps the project would go broke before it is able to benefit from the profit of The Oikos. \n* A 2M investment might perform better if invested in another way, and produce more ROI than with The Oikos \n* A 2M investment might perform quicker if invested in another way, and return funds to the treasury before profit from The Oikos kicks in. \n\nTo make savvy investment decisions the community needs to understand where we stand in the current budget for the last 6 months and what sort of environment the next budget HIP will be in. \n\nCurrently we are just over half way through the budget period and we are significantly under budget. You can review the current budget position & predictions for budget remainders for the end of the period here. \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1TbRRJkcAv6_lxK4TSLWTod3DK9qcRSPu/view?usp=share_link\n\nFinal numbers for the budget for next period are still being tabulated but by all accounts the next period will require notably less funds than allocated for this one. Predictions put that budget between 4-7 M for the 6 month period of April 2023 through to September 2023, and as shown in the charts above some of those funds will be able to roll over from this period.\n\nWhat does all this mean for the Hector Network Ecosystem and Hectorians inside The Oikos? \n\nThe plan to integrate The Oikos with the Hector Network ecosystem remains intact. \nHow we approach this will shift to a partnership model such as Hector Network uses with any number of other protocols. As part of the initial contract expectations for integration for the Mythos Collection, Library, Atlantica, and other or future Hector Network sub-brands will be mapped out, and obligations, where they are applicable, will be outlined. Such a collaboration is mutually beneficial since Hector Network has extensively invested into infrastructure for a number of Sub-Brands that have huge potential inside The Oikos. For The Oikos developing them from scratch would be a massive waste of development resources and time. \n\nSimilarly, integration into The Oikos continues to provide utility for these products and plenty of exposure. By nature, the market audience for The Oikos greatly exceeds that of Hector Network.  Combining the Hector Network Ecosystem into The Oikos will provide increased traffic and an on-ramp for new community members, particularly from those outside the world of crypto. \n\nFurthermore, as The Oikos community and Hectorians are fundamentally linked, it is important that holders of HEC, TOR, wsHEC, fNFTs, and Mythos Collections see perks as promised throughout the development of the game. \n\nWho will be in the new company? \n \nIf HIP 38 passes, then the outcome of HIP 38A, in conjunction with how much funds are raised through grants, sales and investors in the first 4-8 months the team will range from 4 people to 17 people in the foreseeable future. \nSome of these positions, C- Level and below, will be filled by current Hector Network contractors who will move over to the new company. Some, such as the CEO, CFO will be hired specifically for the new company. For all new hires we’ll be seeking individuals who have plenty of experience in the gaming industry as well as their field of oversight. All positions will be paid purely by the new legal entity. Any team members from Hector Network moving permanently over to The Oikos would also be paid out entirely by that company and this would open up funds in the Hector Network budget. \nIn the early days some team members will likely work for both companies, however no person will be collecting a pay cheque from both companies. These overlap positions will be focused on the supporting replacement contractors who are taking over work, and continued collaboration of the two companies, ensuring smooth integration for the sub brands.\nThe Oikos will continue to work with third parties such as Magic Media and other consulting agencies to fulfill development needs.\n\nVoting options HIP 38:\n\n1. I approve separating The Oikos into its own legal company, but do not wish Hector Network to commit additional funds and am happy with Hector Network receiving 12% of the profit payout pool. \n2. I do not approve the separation of The Oikos into its own legal company. I understand that not separating into its own legal entity prevents the team from searching for external development funding in the form of investors. I am aware that given the current market conditions the strain to develop the game entirely in house might require all the treasury funds or require a full pause on game development.\n3. I am unhappy with any of the presented options and supporting data.",

      "title": "HIP-36 APY Reduction for the next weeks until the emission plan starts",
      "content": "Hectorians,\n \nYesterday, we took the day to share our views with some experienced and trusted community members. \nWe listened to their comments, concerns and advice to ensure that what we propose to you now is a well thought out approach to the problem at hand. We’re incredibly grateful for their feedback and support as we continue to shepherd this community towards its bright future.\n \nAs market conditions continue to deteriorate, Core team has been in deep conversation about protecting \nHector Finance’s long-term health and continued growth. We have always believed that a healthy token price is superior for our community and users rather than a short-term boom followed by a quick fizzle. It’s imperative that we remain agile. What worked last week, last month, and last year does not work now. \nThis isn’t because we’ve failed to plan for the future, but instead that it would have been irresponsible to force the community into ‘bear market conditions’ when it wasn’t necessary. We’ve adapted as quickly as the markets and community support will allow and are committed to continuing.\n \nWe know that reducing APY is likely to produce negative feedback from some community members, but \nwe were clear that it was our wish to keep the APY above 100% *if possible*\n \n“However, at this moment it is fair to assume a starting range of between 100 and 200% is very likely”\n \nSince these words were written, plenty of things have shifted in the markets; unfortunately, very few are \noptimistic. Additionally, if we’d been able to enact the emissions plan in May, as initially hoped, we would \nhave been in a position to follow through with this APY. The additional month/month plus has resulted in a substantial number of tokens produced and distributed, increasing our supply above where we had hoped to launch the emissions plan.\n \nAs always, our job as the Hector Finance team is to find the most effective way forward for the majority of our community, and that is what we intend to do. We are building a blockchain empire focused on actual utility, innovation and expansion, but to do that, we need to keep Hector Finance thriving through the storms.\n \nWe believe that reducing the APY is essential to the emission plan launch in the current market \nconditions. The success of this emissions plan should be close to the heart of every Hectorian as it \nfundamentally is the future of our market cap and price. Making this move will shorten the timeline to \nseeing the positive price action results and a lower circulating supply, both pillars of security for our Protocol and users.\n \nInitially, we had intended to have a binary vote; however, after the intake of feedback yesterday, we now see several options for the community to debate and cast their ballots.\n \nA. APY Reduction instant to 20% until the emission plan starts; the APY bumps back to 50% for the launch of the emission plan\n\nB. APY Reduction instant to 50% until the emission plan starts; the APY stays at 50% for the launch of the emission plan.\n \nC. No appropriate option was provided.\n \nYou will note that the top three options have us starting the emissions plan at 50% APY. Using the best of our calculations, and admitting that some factors are unforeseen and outside our control, this figure provides us with the best chance of prosperity throughout the continued dark market. Locking in this figure now means we will have a single variable to calculate the emissions plan, the circulating supply.\n \nThe actual value of Hector Finance lies not in her rebase program, but in the ecosystem, we are building together.\n\nWe have plenty of announcements coming out in the next few weeks that will catch the eyes of new potential users, not least of which is announcing the name of our legendary new football partner. The connection to the team has already begun opening impressive doors to our development team behind the scenes. And we are unbelievably excited to start sharing some of those developments with you. We’re \namping up for a very bullish summer, and we’re intent on ensuring the foundation is solid to support what we’re building. Projects with lower, more sustainable APY have a better track record of attracting large long-term investors because they are built to last. As we expand our ecosystem, which we are not rapidly doing, attracting these key players will be critical.\n \nWe have the best community in the blockchain. That much is evident everywhere we look. We hope you \ncan see our long-term vision for the community, this Protocol and what we intend to create. We believe that our society is here for much more than just the APY and that you will see the wisdom in what we’re proposing.\n \nThe emissions plan will start in approximately 4 weeks. To give you some insight into the impact of this reduction at this time:\n \nWe did buybacks during the last 50 days of 5 million dollars and took approximately 500,000 tokens out of supply. If we froze the APY at the top of those 50 days, we would have a circulating supply of around \n2,270,000 tokens, and, while no one can know for sure, that freeze could be reflected by positive price \naction as well.\n \nHow does dropping APY affect our Protocol over the next four weeks: \nAPY 100%: over 130,000 additional Tokens in circulation within a month. (BB Value over $1.4 Million) \nAPY 50%: over 65,000 additional tokens in circulation within a month. (BB Value over $700K) \nAPY 20%: ~26,000 additional tokens in circulation within a month. (BB Value over $280K)\nThe BB Value is calculated based on the current price and will be more with price increases.\n\nWe realize that lowering the APY further is not part of the get rich quick crypto dream; however, it is a sustainable starting place for the emissions plan, and if we don’t achieve that, we may as well not bother.\n\n \nWe want our community to discuss this among yourselves and take this opportunity to seriously consider what we are suggesting, ask questions, talk amongst yourselves, and cast your vote. These steps towards our future must be taken together.",

Given this deal’s high-profile nature, we are not allowed to release the team name until contracts have been signed, which we cannot do without a favorable HIP Vote from our community.\n\nA deal of this size and the following publicity would be a game-changer for Hector Finance and will open many doors. The media exposure alone guarantees worldwide reach to millions of people. By sponsoring such an international phenomenon, we put ourselves in the room with hundreds of other major corporations, including venture capitalists, to which we might never have access otherwise. Our co-sponsors and their connections are potential partnership opportunities and could have far-reaching implications for our upcoming ecosystem projects. \n\nPartnering with such an iconic and established brand elevates Hector Finance to a new operating level. The possibilities that will arise from cross-marketing, access to the team’s brand and players, and media coverage visibility are endless and irreplaceable, putting Hector Finance in front of millions of new eyes. Through sponsorship, we are allotted over 200 tickets to matches, several meet and greets with players and other sought-after fan experiences. We plan to leverage these parts of the deal as a gateway to the team’s 250+ Million worldwide fans. When used as prizes in giveaways or other competitions, these aspects of the sponsorship act as a powerful incentive for newcomers to learn more about our Protocol and become involved in our community. \n\nThrough these challenging market conditions, the fear, the uncertainty and the doubt, this deal is part of our pledge to you: Hector Finance is here to stay, innovate, and set a new standard. Tomorrow, in our community update, we will be discussing this spectacular chance, why as a team, feel that it is one we cannot pass over, and the impact we think it will have on our protocol. We have opened a dedicated Discord channel to discuss further why we are so enthusiastic about this opportunity and answer community questions so everyone can make an informed choice. \n\nThis major deal is a two year contract, with the ability to exit after one year under defined circumstances. The complete cost of sponsorship for the first season starts at $5,914,000. If the team has a successful season up to $1,185,000 can be added to the cost. The total is dependent on the results in national and international leagues. If the team performs well it provides a ton of additional media, visibility and attention to our brand. \n\nWe propose allocating $7,099,000 for the first year. These funds allow us to finalize this colossal deal with a legendary football brand and fully cover us for the first season of sponsorship. After the season is complete, all funds not used (for example if the contract extension is not required) will be returned to the treasury.",

      "title": "HIP-033 New Direction of Hector Finance",
      "content": "Hectorians!\n\nEventful days lie behind us, which have shaken the whole crypto sector to its foundations. The drama around Luna and UST has shown us that even the unthinkable is possible and no project is too big to fail. At present, we can only speculate about the background of the events. What is certain, however, is that this will have a lasting impact on the market. At this point, our thoughts are also with all those who have suffered high financial losses due to the recent developments. \n\nSuch an event was not foreseeable and has taken many by surprise. This is certainly one of the largest destruction of assets the crypto market has seen to date. Hector Finance was not left unscathed. In addition to the price losses we are currently seeing in all projects, such as FTM, BTC and BNB, we had holdings of $40,000,000 in the UST wormhole. When we became aware of the problems with UST we acted immediately, studied the market closely and also called in external consultants for help. Due to the rapid developments in the price and the sheer amount of UST in our possession, it was not possible to liquidate the entire position quickly. Rather, we had to use every recovery to liquidate positions, always with the danger in the background of risking a total loss. Unfortunately, this was only possible with a substantial loss. Despite the rapidly progressing events, we were able to save $23,644,387, which we now hold in what we consider the safest stablecoin USDC. \n\nAs everyone is aware, the whole market is suffering at the moment. We see a high level of panic, which is reflected in significant price drops and withdrawal of cash from the crypto space. Also, stablecoins in general are currently under high pressure and panic selling is occurring. At this point, it is worth reading the recently published article about $TOR, in which we go into detail about the differences to other stablecoins: https://medium.com/@HectorDAO/why-hec-tor-and-luna-ust-are-not-alike-8f5e7d8c75ef\nAs a result of the actual panic in the markets, people have withdrawn stables from the TOR Pool. To rebalance it, we had to remove TOR from the pool and add some USDC. This was done to avoid HEC price manipulations and because of the rebalancing, we temporarily suspended new minting of TOR. It is currently paused till further notice, until the demand will require its opening once again.\n\nThe current situation will certainly continue for some time and will require some sacrifice from everyone. \nThis leads us to a fundamental question:\nDo we still believe in DeFi and its mass adaptation in the future?\nFrom our point of view, this can be answered with a clear \"yes\". We see more and more countries, institutions and business enterprises, which believe in the future of DeFi and actively shape it. Especially in these difficult times one thing is more important than before, namely to learn from the past to be prepared for the future!\nWe are working on this future, more than ever before. You all know our plans for this year. Development of the NFT marketplace is in full swing and we will be able to provide you with first impressions very soon. Regarding our GameFi plans, we have partnered with Catheon Gaming, who are the creators of SolChicks among other things. Together we are working on a metaverse that will change the market for good! We are also very excited about the upcoming NFT collection (Mythos collection), which will appeal to a new target group, increase our visibility and create new opportunities.\n\nVery recently, we were able to close the deal with JulWallet to bring $TOR into real life. Do you want to pay for your coffee with $TOR in the future? No problem! \nAt this point a little spoiler. We are also currently working on a marketing deal with a very well-known partner in the sports sector, with global reach. More on this shortly.\nThis all adds real value to Hector Finance and will continuously help our project to grow. We have all answered the question of whether we believe in the future of DeFi with a resounding \"yes\". Despite all the current adversities, moments like these are also always an opportunity. And this chance must be seized!\n\"Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy and Greedy When Others Are Fearful.\"\n\nOur treasury is our greatest asset and strongest weapon! Especially in the current situation, where stablecoins are under fire and we see significant price drops, we have the opportunity to make sustainable investments. At the moment, large parts of the treasury are invested in stablecoins and are in farming pools to in turn, secure the return for TOR and generate income. The loss generated by UST and the uncertainties in the area of stablecoins makes it necessary in our opinion to rethink and re-evaluate previously applicable rules and, above all, to incorporate unconventional considerations. We have seen that the market, currently more than ever, may require quick action. In addition, we need to ensure the growth of the treasury in order to continue to drive Hector Finance forward and to be able to continue to provide you with all the benefits. We see the current market as one of the biggest opportunities in recent years and therefore propose to shift the ratio of stablecoins to established crypto projects. \n\n\nThis will ensure stronger growth and higher returns through farming and staking. Our new dapp will be online in a few days and will ensure you a much better overview and details on treasury investments. Because of all this we propose:\n- 80% not in stables, but in established projects (depending on fundamentals and staking/farming options)\n- Stake it with best possible and secure returns\n- Swap rewards for stables under consideration of the actual market conditions\n- Guarantee TOR farming rewards through asset management\n- Buy & Sell (DCA) through the market under examination of current developments \n\nEvery crisis is also an opportunity to be seized. We will continue to work tirelessly, together with you, on the success of Hector Finance to bring this project where it belongs! Let's walk the road to the top together! We therefore bring the above proposal to a HIP.",

      "content": "TOR is at a growth stage where strategic partnerships are being formed to facilitate the utility of Farming Pools. This provides incentive to hold $TOR, and increases TVL for our project, aiding adoption.\n\nTo further boost the utility of our very own stablecoin $TOR, we believe tapping into the payment system industry is a must! To facilitate payments with $TOR, we have strategic partnerships lined up. These will ensure the widest range of exposure going forward, and therefore, this is why we chose to cooperate with JulWallet.\n\n~What is JulWallet?~\nJulWallet aims at creating a completely decentralized finance experience in connection with the fiat world applications like the Visa / Mastercard Debit Card. This is to be achieved by replacing all the third parties in a financial transaction ( for example banks and middle men) with one or more Smart Contracts. This is not only because of distrust in traditional financial institutions, but also to avoid credit and debit card fraud or identity theft. Both NGC Ventures, and Binance Smart Chain are investors of JulWallet.\n\n~How does it work?~\nThe JulCard is a virtual and physical debit card, which allows users to make payments on over 60 MILLION merchants worldwide. The only option to access the JulCard Smart Contract is via the decentralized JulWallet where a KYC is needed.  \n\nOnly the owner from the KYC verified and Debit Card contract-assigned wallet can interact with the debit card - identities and funds are secured to a private key and pass phrase.\n\n~What is the HIP proposing?~\nThe HIP for $125,000 is broken down into two sections. \n1. $100,000 for token integration. This means TOR will be integrated into the wallet platform, allowing TOR holders to use TOR as a means of payment.\n2. $25,000 for marketing. This includes announcements on Julwallet's Twitter, retweets, announcements in all telegram groups, a twitter space, and a video demonstration.\n\nJulWallets website: https://julwallet.com/\n$TOR's website: https://tor.cash/",

KPOP and Korean entertainment has broken through to mainstream audiences, and has grown to 108 Bn USD in 2021, with a CAGR of 4% over the last 4 years\n\n2. Play 2 earn crypto gaming is exploding, generating $2.32 Bn USD in Q3 20212, and increased by 2000% since Q1 2021\n\n3. Virtual influencers in the metaverse are emerging e.g. Travis Scott x Fortnite concert drawing 12m viewers, rozy.gram and lil’ miquela, both virtual influencers generated $13m USD in 2021\n\nThe vision of Seoul Stars is to create the first virtual K-pop idol, Yuna, built on the blockchain with a plethora of content including songs, albums, virtual concerts, and games. Yuna will eventually be turned into a realistic 3D virtual idol being featured in various mainstream media and metaverse platforms. A virtual idol provides numerous opportunities for massive growth and exposure. Such idols are not hindered by scandals that may potentially disappoint fans, and are not confined by restrictions in time or location. Producers can exert full creativity into virtual idols, whereas real artists differ drastically in capability, style and consistency. Most importantly, virtual idols that exist within the blockchain allows fans to partake in the conceptual development of the artistʼs music, dance, fashion, and identity. \n\nAs additional informations beneath you find again a short PowerPoint presentation with all important informations. We also had an AMA with the team of Seoul Stars this week. You can find this here:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/HectorDAO_HEC/status/1521792763167232001\n\nAfter TIP-027 ends, we will withdraw $200,000 from the Treasury to a secondary wallet and will perform the investment. \n",

The network is also highly flexible and adaptive, allowing the sharing of information and functionality between participants. Polkadot can be automatically upgraded without the need for a fork in order to implement new features or remove bugs.\n\nThe network has a highly sophisticated user-driven governance system where all token holders have a vote in how the network is run. Teams can customise their own blockchain’s governance on Polkadot based on their needs and evolving conditions. Nominators, validators, and collators all fulfil various duties to help secure and maintain the network and eradicate bad behaviour.\n\nAfter TIP-026 ends, we will withdraw $500,000 from the Treasury to a secondary wallet and will perform the investment in the following hours.

Through a decentralised oracle network, Chainlink allows blockchains to securely interact with external data feeds, events and payment methods, providing the critical off-chain information needed by complex smart contracts to become the dominant form of digital agreement.\n\nThe Chainlink Network is driven by a large open-source community of data providers, node operators, smart contract developers, researchers, security auditors and more. The company focuses on ensuring that decentralised participation is guaranteed for all node operators and users looking to contribute to the network.\n\nChainlink is one of the first networks to allow the integration of off-chain data into smart contracts. With many trusted partners, Chainlink is one of the major players in the data processing field. Due to the integration of off-chain data, Chainlink has attracted the attention of numerous trusted data providers, including Brave New Coin, Alpha Vantage and Huobi. Data providers can sell access to data directly to Chainlink, thus monetising the information they have.\n\nAs a decentralised network, Chainlink allows users to become node operators and earn revenue by running critical data infrastructure required for blockchains’ success.

While the company started only as a crypto exchange back in 2017, today, Binance has spread its services among numerous different spheres. According to the company website, its mission is to become the infrastructure services provider for the entire blockchain ecosystem.\n\nSince the launch of BNB, the exchange has also benefited from increased investor interest in the token. BNB went through a significant price increase at the beginning of 2021, which has put it on the map of enterprise investors.\n\nMeasures like BEP-95 have upgraded the already deflationary tokenomics to make BNB even more deflationary. Following the proposal, gas fees on Binance Smart Chain have become even lower, as the network burns a part of the fees to decentralise further. The proposal was modeled after Ethereum's famous EIP-1559.\n\nAfter TIP-023 ends, we will withdraw $500,000 from the Treasury to a secondary wallet and will perform the investment in the following hours.

Nexus Mutual tries to disrupt the insurance industry by transitioning the power over the pooled resources to the individual people. Anyone is allowed to participate, as the mutual is owned by its members. Users can contribute Ethereum (ETH) to the pool for NXM.\n\nNexus Mutual is taking on the issue of smart contract vulnerability and provides users with a level of protection that can help avoid losses.\n\nNexus Mutual’s first product were smart contract covers that provided protection for value storing contracts. In order for the project to start processing claims, it needed to reach a pool of 12,000 ETH, which was achieved two months after the launch.\n\nThe NXM token represents the membership rights in Nexus Mutual, along with the ability to participate within the ecosystem through claim and risk assessments and governance. The token leverages a bonding curve to determine the price, which is driven by how much capital the Mutual has and how much capital it needs to meet all of the claims with a certain probability.\n\nUsers can stake NXM to vote on claim assessments and on whether or not a certain claim needs to be paid out. The members who decide to vote in accordance with the consensus are rewarded with NXM, whereas the ones that vote against it have their tokens locked for a period of time.\n\nMembers fulfill several roles, one of which is that of assessing the risk of each smart contract. Whenever a claim is filed, they are responsible for voting on the legitimacy of that claim and on whether the payout can be made or not.\n\nMembers can also use their tokens to vote on smart contracts based on how secure they think each particular contract is. The more NXM is staked on a smart contract, the cheaper it becomes to purchase cover for it; the large amount at stake is an indicator that the contract is considered safe by many members.\n\nAfter TIP-022 ends, we will withdraw $500,000 from the Treasury to a secondary wallet and will perform the investment in the following hours.

This provides the ideal environment for DApps and creates a developer and user-friendly platform. For instance, NEAR uses human-readable account names, unlike the cryptographic wallet addresses common to Ethereum. NEAR also introduces unique solutions to scaling problems and has its own consensus mechanism called “Doomslug.”\n\nNEAR uses its Nightshade technology to improve transaction throughput massively. Nightshade is a variation of sharding, in which individual sets of validators process transactions in parallel across multiple sharded chains, improving the overall capacity of the blockchain. In contrast to “regular” sharding, shards in Nightshade produce a fraction of the next block, called “chunks.” In doing so, NEAR Protocol is able to achieve up to 100,000 transactions per second and achieve near-instant transaction finality thanks to a one-second block cadence while simultaneously keeping transaction fees at virtually zero.\n\nNEAR Protocol also improves upon the convoluted onboarding process of other blockchains by having human-readable addresses and building decentralized applications with similar registration flow to what users have already experienced. Moreover, it provides developers with modular components, helping them start projects like token contracts or NFTs more quickly.\n\nAfter TIP-019 ends, we will withdraw $500,000 from the Treasury to a secondary wallet and will perform the investment in the following hours.

All of this aims to challenge existing payment providers, who often charge high fees for a similar service.\n\nIf all of this sounds familiar, it is worth nothing that Stellar was originally based on the Ripple Labs protocol. The blockchain was created as a result of hard fork, and the code was subsequently rewritten.\n\nStellar is unique because every transaction costs just 0.00001 XLM. Given how one unit of this cryptocurrency only costs a few cents at the time of writing, this helps ensure that users keep more of their money.\n\nFew blockchain projects have managed to secure partnerships with big-brand technology companies and fintech firms. A few years ago, Stellar and IBM teamed up to launch World Wire, a project that allowed large financial institutions to submit transactions to the Stellar network and transact using bridge assets such as stablecoins.\n\nAfter TIP-014 ends, we will withdraw $500,000 from the Treasury to a secondary wallet and will perform the investment in the following hours.

Due to our ongoing discussions regarding future cooperations with Catheon Gaming, we propose to invest at an early stage in the project Angrymals. \n\nAngrymals is a free-to-play PvP tactical video game based on one solid concept: throw junk and wreck things! Inspired by Angry Birds and Worms, the player will control three customized Angrymals bunkered down in a player-designed fortress, armed with a huge assortment of absurd weapons and powers to lay waste on the opponent's defenses. \nAngrymals has been in development since 2015. It is being developed by Sionera Entertainment, a boutique Italian game studio, which was acquired by Catheon Gaming, a leading blockchain game publisher in January 2022. Catheon Gaming is among other things, such as the company behind SolChicks. The team's focus now is to convert the existing Angrymals game into a blockchain, play-to-earn version. Catheon Gaming will support the project with its expertise in blockchain integration, marketing, community building, fundraising and listing support.\n\nOverall, there are not many playable, completed games in the P2E space at the moment – most completed games have low gameplay value, and games with higher gameplay value are 12-18 months away from a full release. Angrymals is proven to be fun to play and is only 1 month away from a full P2E version release.\n\n🌐 https://angrymals.io/\n🌐 https://catheongaming.com/\n\nAfter TIP-013 ends, we will arrange all further steps to invest $200,000 in the Seed/Private Sale Phase. We keep you updated on this.",

      "content": "\nNote: Before voting it is ESSENTIAL that you:\n\nRead This\nhttps://medium.com/@HectorDAO/the-hector-emission-plan-31f4ea9e56b6\n\nWatch this from 19:20 onwards\nhttps://youtu.be/hU3r_K56hi8?t=1161\n\n\nLast Thursday we unveiled the Hector Finance Emission Plan. Over the last few days we have been discussing the Emission Plan as a community and the Core Team and Mods have been answering all questions related to it. We are now in a position to vote.\n\nTherefore, we propose to begin to create and enact the Hector Finance Emission Plan.\n\nWith a yes vote:\n- Work will begin on the creation, testing, and auditing of all necessary contracts and systems for the Emission Plan\nIt will take approximately 1.5 months to finalize this and begin the system\n- Between now and the start of the emission plan, the APY of staking rewards will be slowly reduced to no lower than 100%. This is because a lower token supply upon the start of the emission plan will allow for greater rewards when the plan begins. It will also reduce inflation and begin to achieve what the Emission Plan is designed to achieve.\n- We will give regular updates on the progress of creating and implementing the Emission Plan\n- HEC will start on a 2 year path of becoming deflationary forever\nBuybacks and Burns will continue during the Emission Plan\n\nAbout the Emission Plan:\n- All details can be found here: \nhttps://medium.com/@HectorDAO/the-hector-emission-plan-31f4ea9e56b6\nhttps://youtu.be/hU3r_K56hi8?t=1161\n\nSummary of the article above:\n- A finite supply cap of HEC will be established\n- The Emission Plan consists of 13 periods of 8 weeks (2 years) over which HEC tokens will be minted and distributed, with inflation reducing at each period at predetermined, predictable rates. This will reduce inflation and lift the artificial price ceiling of the HEC token.\n- Users will still be able to stake normally during the 2 year plan\n- Users will be able to lock their tokens in farms which will give boosted rewards. Longer locks will have larger rewards.\n\n- Since the Emission Plan parameters such as total supply cap, reward rate, and emission rate will depend upon the number of circulating tokens at the time of implementation, exact parameters cannot be given at this stage\n- However, at this moment it is fair to assume a starting range of between 100 and 200% is very likely\n\nVote Below:\n\n",

In addition to crypto payments, Alchemy Pay enables seamless and easy access to crypto investment, blockchain solutions, and DeFi services configured as required to serve sophisticated veterans as well as those new to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.

The website combines all of Verasity’s products into one platform owned and controlled by Verasity. With a growing number of users, the platforms offer rewards in VRA for watching, subscribing and winning. Market cap is currently 93M on CMC.\n\nTravala \nhttps://www.travala.com/\nTravala founded in 2017, is the leading blockchain-based travel booking platform backed by Binance.\nTravala allows people to book more than 3,000,000 travel products including accommodations, flights and activities in 90,124 destinations in 230 countries and territories across the globe. The platform’s creators claim that it is typically cheaper than traditional, mainstream booking platforms. Travala uses a native token, AVA, which powers the Customer Loyalty Program (Smart Program), Standard Booking Givebacks, Best Price Guarantee, Referral Program, Affiliate Program and more. Market cap is currently 67M on CMC.\n\nAfter TIP-011 ends, we will withdraw $250,000 from the Treasury to a secondary wallet and will perform the investment in the following hours. (We'll analyse the target project chart to find the best moment to jump in, and may do multiple smaller transactions instead of a big one).\n\nThanks for your vote!",

Any evidence of users pooling tokens together in order to abuse the system will result in a rejection of the deal and may come with a permanent ban from the community.\n\nVote Below:",

      "content": "\nHIP-009 results\n\nHIP-009 on the allocation of $5,000,000 from the DAI treasury to perform 10 different medium-high risk investments (500k each) over the coming weeks passed! Over 96% was in favor.\n\nBackground of the previous HIP-009\n\nOur Market cap/RF treasury is incredibly healthy. The Treasury willl continue to be used for relatively safe investments with investment contracts. We aim for investments with stable yields of 20-25%. However, we asked for input from our community on 2022 plans. A common suggestion was to allocate a small part of our Treasury (5M proposed - less than 5%) into a few medium-high risk investments. Choosing the right projects, with the help of the community, will help us to potentially make great returns from which our protocol will benefit.\n\nAs such we are launching the TIP governance system. A TIP is a Treasury Investment Proposal.\n\nTIP-009A\n\nHere is TIP number 009A. This time, you can vote on a $250,000 investment in one of four Metaverse projects that potentially have a lot of room for growth. $250,000 instead of $ 500,000 because these projects do not have top-100 market caps and hive a higher risk/reward ratio than blue chip projects (more potential upside but also more potential downside). We will provide a brief explanation:\n\nBloktopia\nBloktopia is a VR skyscraper made of 21 floors, in honor of 21 million Bitcoin. It’s the VR metaverse that aims to become the edutainment hub for all levels of crypto experience. Market cap is currently 241M on CMC\n\nSolice\nSolice is a VR metaverse on the Solana blockchain where users can play, create, own, socialize, and monetize their virtual experiences. Solice supports multiple platforms removing the barrier of disparate hardware, software, and operating systems. Market cap is currently 88M on CMC.\n\nStar Atlas\nStar Atlas is being built on the Solana Blockchain and is a massive multiplayer online game that takes place in a virtual gaming metaverse. It is being built on Unreal Engine 5, allowing the game to feature cinema-quality, real-time environments. Star Atlas takes place in a futuristic science fiction setting in 2620, where three major factions have emerged and are competing for resources and control: humankind, a consortium of alien races and sentient androids. Market cap is currently 106M on CMC\n\nIlluvium\nIlluvium is an open-world fantasy battle game built on the Ethereum blockchain. Often touted as the first AAA game on Ethereum, Illuvium looks to provide a source of entertainment to both casual gamers and hardcore DeFi fans through a range of collecting and trading features. Market cap is currently 386M on CMC.\n\nAfter TIP-009A ends, we will withdraw $ 250,000 from the Treasury to a secondary wallet and will perform the investment in the following hours. (We'll analyze the target project chart to find the best moment to jump in, and may do multiple smaller transactions instead of a big one).\n\nThanks for your vote!\n",

      "content": "Hectorians, today is a momentous day. We have more than 1,000,000 FTM tokens in our treasury, and as such we can set up 2 validator nodes. With a “Yes” on this vote, we will create a validator in Canada and a validator in France, allowing us to strengthen the Fantom network in the two strongholds our Hectorian community has. Both of these validators will also play an important role in our upcoming plans.\n\nValidators help secure the Fantom network - whenever you submit a transaction, a validator confirms it and puts it on the chain. The gas fee you pay goes to the validator for its work. \n\nTherefore, we intend to set up our own validators to help the network grow, and to bring in even more revenue to the Hector Ecosystem.\n\nWhat will happen to the fees generated?\n\nThere are many things we can do with the fees, but here are some of the most sensible ideas:\n\n- We can re-delegate them to the validators. The more FTM a validator holds, the more likely it is to be chosen to perform a transaction, so the more fees it can earn.\n\n- We can use them as TOR rewards and increase reward rates.\n\n- We can stake them into yield bearing protocols.\n\nWe’d love to have some community input on what you’d like to see us do with the fees - it’ll be an ongoing discussion, so even after the validators are established please keep the ideas coming in.\n\nSo with that being said, we invite you to vote on this proposal.",

The Treasury willl continue to be used for relatively safe investments with investment contracts. We aim for investments with stable yields of 20-25%. However, we asked for input from our community on 2022 plans. A common suggestion was to allocate a small part of our Treasury (5M proposed - less than 5%) into a few medium-high risk investments. Choosing the right projects, with the help of the community, will help us to potentially make great returns from which our protocol will benefit.\n\nAs such we are launching the TIP governance system. A TIP is a Treasury Investment Proposal.\n\nTIP-008\n\nHere is the eight vote on a $500,000 investment in a project chosen by the community. This time we let you choose between investing in the project of some of our partners, who don't need any further introduction:\n\nRBC (Rubic)\nYOSHI (Yoshi.exchange)\nBOO (SpookySwap)\n\nAfter TIP-008 ends, we will withdraw 500k from the Treasury to a secondary wallet and will perform the investment in the following hours. (We'll analyze the target project chart to find the best moment to jump in, and may do multiple smaller transactions instead of a big one).\n\nThanks for your vote!",

      "content": "Hector is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. To us this means it's controlled by the users of our ecosystem and not by a central entity. It means before changing important parameters of the Hector Ecosystem, we first listen. \n\nYesterday we listened. We asked you for input regarding our APY for 2022. We had originally planned to wait a few days with this HIP, but in light of market sentiment towards rebase DAOs combined with users deciding to exit at this stage, it has become clear that this needs to be done before the damage from dilution becomes too large.\n\nOver the past month, it rapidly became (more) clear to us that rebase projects with Ohm's model ultimately can not sustain high APY rates. This was proven by the drastic fall in token price and market cap of these Ohm-inspired projects. High APY rates are only sustainable when buying pressure is higher than selling pressure, which is at the end of January 2022 obviously not the case for (pure) rebase projects anymore. As a consequence, you all see the Hector price and our projects market cap are declining. An ecosystem that focuses on displaying the price action of the rebase token is prone to downward pressure on the underlying token price due its dilution. A 10,000% APY means the supply is multiplied by 100 in a year (excluding bond sales, so even more). \n\nAll the team's efforts are directed at increasing the value of the Hector token. It's what we do over 16 hours a day. And we are not complaining; we love this project and our community. \n\nIn our vision, it's absolutely crucial to decrease dillution and take measures to create scarcity (so deflation). Deflation means everybody's piece of the pie will increase. Not decrease. It was great to see most of you understand the unsustainability of a APY of 10,000% and the direction we are moving in.  \n\nWe want to thank everybody that got back to us with constructive feedback and we're happy to see a vast majority already came to the same conclusion as the Hector team: a too high APY is not sustainable. We love the support for the direction this team is going: \n- a sustainable APY\n- Hector Rebase as part of the entire Hector Ecosystem with many subprojects adding value to $HEC\n- using revenue for buy backs (deflation!)\n- introducing the $TOR token to introduce a UST-inspired stable coin that will lead to minting our native stablecoin by burning $HEC (deflation!)\n\nThere are two ways we can reduce APY. Either by (1) a static APY for a fixed period, or (2) a dynamic APY that gives the team the opportunity to find the perfect balance between attractiveness of (the subproject) Hector Rebase, market circumstances, dilution and deflation. \n\nOption 1: Fixed APY of 500% for a 2 month period\nOption 2: Dynamic APY ranging from 200-1500%, set by team\n\nIn both scenarios, we will re-evaluate after 2 months, so by the end of March and take into account all important parameters (market circumstances, revenue, burn rates from TOR, etc)\n\nAlso: we will soon rebrand to Hector Finance as the name for our Ecosystem, as 'DAO' is at the moment mainly associated with Olympus forks. We obviously will remain a DAO in the sense community decides on our future. \n\nPlease vote for your preference!",

      "content": "\nThe Hector Stablecoin will play a major part in the Hector DAO Ecosystem, as announced in our 2022 Master Plan.\n\nWe currently see 2 major usecases for our very own Stablecoin:\n\n1) Increases deflation of $HEC by burning huge amounts of HEC through at least two identified value loops. This will help reverse inflation and bring us towards the Inflection Point (the moment at which a similar number of tokens are minted and burned). The Hector Stablecoin will also drive HEC demand up, and increase bonding inflows, all whilst simultaneously providing users with stakable stablecoins which offer highly competitive APR/APY rewards.\n2) The Hector Stablecoin will be key for the development of Hector Pay, and will be the currency used for payments with the lowest transaction fees. The Hector Pay project aims to create a payment system wherein users will be able to send and receive crypto assets to and from friends and family across multiple networks. Users will also be able to pay for real-world items using Crypto balances.\n\nOur developers are currently running tests day and night, and we will soon run a small, controlled, community trial.\n\nNow: not unimportant. The name. We have asked for suggestions, and our community came up with hundreds of names. We love you. We kindly ask you to decide on the name of the Hector Stablecoin, while taking the two most prominent use cases as laid out above into account.\n\n1) HUGS - $HUGS (\"Can I pay with $HUGS?\")\n2) HELEN - $HLN ( from Helen of Troy)\n3) DRACHMA - $DRAC (the currency used in ancient Greece)\n4) USDH - $USDH (boring, but more recognizable)",

Many Hectorians appreciated the fact we continuously ask for governance votes on the future of Hector DAO. Our proposal to set APY at 10K was complimented and embraced. \n\nWe also received loads of messages about the 3 week period in which we would gradually reduce the APY rates to 10K. Our proposal was 3 weeks, but there seems to be a lot of desire for setting back APY quicker than over a 3 week period. \n\nWe see pros and we see cons. A gradual shift generally creates less stir/confusion, but at the other hand, we proposed to go to 10K for all the (right) reasons explained in this Medium article: https://medium.com/@HectorDAO/hip-011-apy-2022-and-the-growth-of-hector-acb85826bad7\n\nSo.

Please read the article in full first.\n\nThe less dilution we enter the Point Of Inflection with, the better. The fewer tokens in circulation when that point arrives, the more pronounced the effect of deflation will be, the more room for growth we will have, and the better the outcome for token holders.\n\nThis is why we have been reducing our APY over time - it helps us control dilution in preparation for utility to come to the HEC token.\nAs mentioned, rebasing, staking, and bonding alone are not enough to allow the continued expansion of Hector.\n\nAs such it is in the best interest of the project to keep APY rates at a level where stakers are rewarded without diluting the project so much that the future sustainability of the Hector Ecosystem is damaged.\n\nTherefore we propose the following:\nA HIP vote to reduce our APY to 10,000% over the coming 3 weeks.\n\nWe understand that community members enjoy high APY rates, but the current rates are damaging the health of the project and reducing the upside potential for when Hector becomes deflationary.\n\nUsers have expressed concern about price action in the recent weeks - this price action is almost entirely because of the APY rates being as high as they are. You can look at all other rebase tokens that experience a similar price development for reference. Tokens are minted at a rate that they create selling pressure which suppresses price action. This is something we want to solve.\n\nReducing APY will increase the relative rewards per person over time since the selling pressure incurred by rebase rewards will be reduced. Looking at other rebase projects, such as Olympus, reducing the APY gradually to 10,000% (still x100!) is incredibly bullish. This will greatly benefit the runway. \n\nWe are in it for the long run Hectorians.\n\nRemember, as utility increases, HEC inflation will be controlled further by burning more tokens. This gives us the potential to raise APY rates in line with the growth of the Hector Ecosystem as profits increase.  This is the best long-term position for Hector.\n\n2022 is the year of Hector. This is the first step.",

Choosing the right projects, with the help of the community, will help us to potentially make great returns from which our protocol will benefit.\n\nAs such we are launching the TIP governance system. A TIP is a Treasury Investment Proposal.\n\nTIP-001\n\nHere is the first vote on a $500,000 investment in a project chosen by the community:\n\n1. FTM \n2. DUSK\n3. SPIRIT\n\nAfter TIP-001 ends, we will withdraw 500k from the Treasury to a secondary wallet and will perform the investment in the following hours. (We'll analyze the target project chart to find the best moment to jump in, and may do multiple smaller transactions instead of a big one).\n\nThanks for your vote!",

      "content": "Summary: Allocate 5M from the DAI treasury to perform 10 different medium-high risk investments (500k each) over the coming weeks.\n\nBackground: Our Market cap/RF treasury is incredibly healthy. The Treasury willl continue to be used for relatively safe investments with investment contracts. We aim for investments with stable yields of 20-25%. However, we asked for input from our community on 2022 plans. A common suggestion was to allocate a small part of our Treasury (5M proposed - less than 5%) into a few medium-high risk investments. Choosing the right projects, with the help of the community, will help us to potentially make great returns from which our protocol will benefit.\n\nHow will this work:\n\nEvery 500k Investment will be chosen by the community, from a list of 3 possible investments proposed by the team. The list of 3 will be made by the team, but obviously we are always open for suggestions! A sub-HIP will be placed online for each of the 10 proposed investments. When the sub-HIP ends and the project is chosen, the team will withdraw 500k from the Treasury to a secondary wallet and will perform the investment in the following hours. (We'll analyze the target project chart to find the best moment to jump in, and may do multiple smaller transactions instead of a big one). After the investment is made, the funds will be sent back to the Treasury contract.\n\nUsing the Earnings:\n\nThe team will decide on how to spend the earnings from the investments. One of the following 4 scenarios might occur:\n\n- Converting them to Stables and keeping them in the Treasury\n- Use them as buybacks (buy back contract)\n- Use them as prizes for giveaways/contests\n- Use them for marketing campaigns",

      "title": "HIP-008 Buyback and Burn",
      "content": "Summary: \nUsing a combination of LP and RFV funds to create a price floor and stabilise the HEC token price.\n\nBackground:\nAs a spoon of OHM, it is our aim to, over time, develop into an entirely unique project. The standard for all OHM forks on all networks is for the treasury to buy back and burn tokens when the price per token falls below $1. This is what allows those projects to call themselves “reserve currencies” - they are all designed to go to $1 and stay there.\n\nWe now feel that it is the right time for the Hector project to break away from that, and to pivot more towards being a utility coin. (Don’t worry, we can make/adopt a reserve currency at a later date).\n\nAs such, we recently put forward a proposal which would allow the protocol to buy back and burn tokens at a price higher than $1, and much closer to the “Backing per HEC” price shown on the dashboard. This will in essence allow HEC to become something more akin to a utility coin rather than a reserve currency, and will allow further increases in token price.\n\nThe original proposal can be found here: https://medium.com/@HectorDAO/buyback-and-burn-c82c866fc168\n\nAfter lengthy discussions with the community, the consensus is that the “Dynamic Hybrid Approach” is the best course of action. In this scenario we will employ what we are calling the 4:1 metric:\n ⁃ When POL LP treasury pairs amount to more than 20% of the RFV, POL LP pairs will be split into their HEC and DAI components. The DAI will be used to buy tokens, and the HEC will be burned along with the HEC purchased at the market.\n ⁃ When POL amounts to less than 20% of the RFV, we will use the RFV to buy back and burn HEC tokens from the market.\n\nTo remind the community:\n ⁃ Buybacks will be used in periods of contraction only\n ⁃ Buybacks are designed to stabilise the price\n ⁃ Project developments are there to increase the price\n\nWhen will buybacks happen?\nThe price at which buybacks happen will be within a given range, and the time of buybacks will not be announced ahead of time. This is to stop people from “gaming the system” and profiting from buyback price movements.\n\nThe buyback price will be slightly below the “backing per HEC price”. As POL and RFV increase through bond sales, the buyback price will also increase since it will lag slightly behind the backing price.\n\nAs the project grows, so too will the backing and buyback prices. This will allow for more long term growth which is protected by the protocol.\n\nWhat will buybacks look like?\nBuybacks will not be single buys worth millions of dollars. They will be broken up into smaller buys which will be done within certain price ranges. They will be made unpredictable and will be used to stabilise the price of the token.\n\nThe buyback and burn mechanism can be implemented very quickly, should this vote pass.\n\nPlease carefully read all of the information above twice before voting below.\n\nVote \"Yes\" if you are in favour of the buyback and burn mechanism above.\n\nVote \"No\" if you are against it.",

      "content": "Background\n\nMany Hectorians have pointed out the issue of larger holders selling directly after a rebase, putting downward pressure on HEC's price in concentrated windows after 8 hours. We do recognize there is some unwanted ‘price action’ around rebases and we have a solution to prevent this in the future. \n\nSolution\n\nWe propose to introduce a warm-up staking period of X epochs. Users must have their HEC staked for more than X epochs/rebases before they can claim sHEC with the rebase rewards. In other words: if you stake HEC, you have to wait X epochs/rebases before you will be able to unstake sHEC. During the warm-up period, users will accumulate rewards. When X epochs/rebases have elapsed, the staked balance (sHEC) can be claimed from the warm up contract. Even more simple: you have 1 HEC, you stake it, you get 1 sHEC + the rewards after X epochs/rebases. You will be able to forfeit.\n\nProposal\n\nWe propose to introduce warm-up staking periods. We ask the community whether it prefers a warm-up period of 2 or 4 epochs/rebases. After your vote, we will need a few days for working on the contracts and UI. ",

      "title": "HIP-006 Approval of Hectorbank deal with Rarible Protocol DAO",
      "content": "Background\n\nAs you all know, Hectorbank will be one the pillars of the Hector DAO ecosystem. We will integrate a native (!) open interest rate protocol that allows users to lend and borrow digital assets, all within our own ecosystem. This is unique and underlines our position as a spoon of Ohm. Lenders can achieve an attractive APY without any risk of volatility of the (s)HEC price by lending out stable coins. Borrowers can use sHEC as a collateral to leverage their position or borrow stablecoins to use them in different projects without having to unstake sHEC. The benefit for the protocol is that the treasury collects fees, consisting of the difference between APR for borrowers and APY for lenders. This way, the treasury increases, which in return has a positive impact on the functioning of the Hector protocol. We will release Hectorbank in two stages. Hectorbank 1.0 is the integrated protocol in our app and Hectorbank 2.0 will go live on hectorbank.com and will strive to become the leading lending and borrowing protocol on the Fantom chain.\n\nWe have worked very hard for the last couple of weeks to release Hectorbank v1, and the moment you have all been waiting for is almost here.  \n\nHector X Rari\n\nAs we have announced, for part of the Hector Bank product, we plan to establish a working partnership with our friends at Rarible Protocol DAO. Why Rari? Firstly, Fuse is a protocol / product made by Rari Capital that supports isolated interest rate pools. Fuse allows “pool creators” to spin up customised, isolated pools for lending and borrowing assets of their choice. Pool creators can choose all the unique parameters they want: interest rate curves, oracles, collateral factors, etc. Furthermore, since each pool is isolated, pool creators may customize their pools according to their appetites for risk without compromising or affecting the safety of other pools.\n\nA partnership between Hector and Rari would be huge and very beneficial for both parties. Rari’s breakout product Fuse has currently $1.36B in total value supplied. Through the proposed partnership with Rari, we will be able to collaborate with a talented team that has similar goals to ours. This will enable Hector to seamlessly develop lending/borrowing on top of proven technologies, which will allow us to focus more resources on innovation once Hectorbank goes live. \n\nWe have already had positive conversations with the Rari team and Rari’s community is very excited about the proposal we submitted to their forums which details exactly what we’re looking to achieve. You can find the post here: https://forums.rari.capital/d/188-deploying-fuse-on-the-fantom-opera-chain-with-hector-dao\n\nPartnership proposal\n\nAfter hearing the feedback to the forum post, we worked out a mutually beneficial partnership deal with the Rari team and we now ask you Hectorians’ to either agree or disagree. Together with Rari, Hector will - as a spoon of Ohm - offer a unique native borrowing/lending protocol with influx of fees directly in the treasury.\n\nTo deploy a Rari Fuse on the Fantom Opera Chain with Hectorbank, in good accordance and in collaboration with the Rari team, we propose to allocate $ 500,000 in $HEC from the dao funds to Rari. This is approximately 10% of the total DAO funds. The allocated $HEC tokens will remain locked for 6 months and will be released through a vesting schedule. In addition, 30% of revenue generated from parts of the protocol which use Fuse technologies will be allocated to Rari. This ensures future support from and further collaboration with Rari.\n",

      "title": "HIP-005 Approval for putting treasury funds to work with our treasury investment contract",
      "content": "Background\n\nThe most important element of what is called ‘DeFi 2.0’ is protocol owned funds. Our treasury is significant, but the team of Hector DAO has found a way to grow treasury funds on top of the growth already provided by bonding. We believe that protocol owned funds should be put into good use (from a protocol level) for a better efficiency of the entire (eco)system. The Hector protocol has shown incredible strength and growth over the last few weeks, now resulting in a large amount of protocol owned assets and liquidity nearing a total value of the treasury of 100M. Hectorians, you guys are amazing. We believe it is now time to put the treasury funds to work, as the more treasury funds Hector DAO owns:\n\n- The more HEC tokens Hector can mint \n- The higher the staking APY for participants\n- The more protection treasury value ensures \n\nSolution\n\nWe want to turn our treasury funds, specifically the stablecoins in our treasury (USDC, DAI, MIM, FRAX) into treasury bearing assets. Over the last week we have worked hard on a treasury investment contract, carefully protected by multi-sig (5/8). You can find this contract here https://github.com/Hector-DAO/hector-contracts/blob/main/treasury-manager/CurveGaugeAllocator.sol. The source code is verified on Ftmscan as well https://ftmscan.com/address/0x344456df952fa32be9c860c4eb23385384c4ef7a#code. Everybody can check the investment contract and feel free to do so! We will separately audit the investment contract. \n\nThe investment contract is integrated with the protocol and the base stable swap pool in Curve (CRV) so our USDC and DAI stablecoins can grow the treasury with interest bearing investments. As mentioned, the investment contract has a fund usage limit which can only be adjusted by 5/8 multi-sig and under a timelock protection, to ensure the investment contract can only send a limited amount of treasury funds to the Curve farming pool. Rewards for farming on Curve can only be accrued by the treasury, so no funds will remain in the treasury investment contract and there are no functions to transfer treasury funds anywhere else.\n\nCurve is one of the oldest and largest dexes from the earliest stages of DeFi. Their protocol currently has 20 billion TVL. The simplicity in the Curve protocol makes it relatively safer than other projects, in our opinion. Also, the pool we will integrate with is a native stablecoin pool of USDC and DAI, so there are no other intermediate risks introduced from outside the scope of Curve, USDC and DAI. The pool is currently offering annually roughly 1%+ exchange fee, 2%+ crv reward and 4%+ wftm reward. See https://ftm.curve.fi/.\n\nWe will develop more investment contracts with the safety of funds as the number one priority.  \n\nProposal\n\nWe propose to use the treasury investment contract to farm USDC and DAI on Curve, so we increase the overall capital efficiency of our treasury and make the entire system create more value that can benefit our community and token holders, allowing us to take larger steps towards becoming a major financial centre on the Fantom chain.",

The wsHEC token is, in short, wrapped staked HEC, a standard ERC20 token with accumulation of the rebase value of HEC, without rebasing. Users get all the rebase benefits when they unwrap wsHEC back to sHEC. wsHEC carries all the HEC value as well as the rebasing value. When you wrap, you automatically receive rebase rewards without ever going to the staking page of Hector.\n\nWe plan to partner up with our friends from Spookyswap for:\n1. Farm: a wsHEC-DAI pool that will have 0.8x BOO rewards for the first 48 hours and then 0.4x BOO rewards after that. Spookyswap incentivizes our pool so Hectorians will earn both rebase rewards + BOO farming rewards!\n2: xBOO pool: stake xBOO tokens to earn HEC (60 days). This is great to attract more Hectorians! \n\nSpookyswap's community will vote on this matter on Thursday for the farm and xBOO pool to go live Friday. \n\nThe Hector team proposes:\n\nTo approve 120K $ worth of HEC (approx ~ 545 HEC) from Hector DAO to enable both pools on Spookyswap.

      "content": "HIP-001 Next bonds\n\nSummary: Hector can launch either new fUSDT or MIM bonds.\n\nBackground: The treasury is the most important part of HEC, without it HEC wouldn’t have much of a use case. That’s why it’s important that the treasury grows in value. Lucky for us, when you buy a bond, you directly fund the treasury. This is very important to the protocol because the more bonds that are bought, the more money flows into the treasury which effectively raises the backing per HEC as well as the APYs offered to Stakers. The backing per HEC is the amount of money each HEC token is backed by. If the price were to drop below the backing per HEC amount, the protocol would automatically buy back and burn enough HEC to raise HEC’s price above the backing per HEC, which ensures a steadily rising price floor. So buying a bond is a win-win for everyone, as the backing per HEC rises along with the treasury size and you get HEC at a discounted price. (more HEC for less money). In the last 2 weeks, we already launched liquidity bonds HEC-USDC and HEC-DAI, as well as USDC, DAI and wFTM bonds. \n\nMotivation: build up bond market with another (more constrained) option. Attract new investors, especially from other chains and projects. Potentially develop partnerships (MIM). \n\nIt's in the hands of the Hector community. fUSDT or MIM? MIM is Abracadabra's native Magic Internet Money stablecoin, versus Tether (USDT), a cryptocurrency with a value meant to mirror the value of the U.S. dollar.\n\nVote below:",
