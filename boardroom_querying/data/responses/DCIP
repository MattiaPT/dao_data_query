Money will start to flow to the investment wallet so we can make new investments in time.\n\nMy opinion is liquidate a certain amount which will be 35% LCX and 65% Qanx (I.e. $700 LCX and $1300 Qanx or $1050 LCX and $1950 Qanx)\n\nLet's hear what you all think of this.

      "content": "## Proposal: utilization of a portion of our ETH holdings for potential profit generation through automated asset rebalancing via the Balancer DeFi Liquidity Protocol on Arbitrum One.\n\n### Proposed Allocation\n- Pool Composition: 30% ARB / 70% wETH (locked weight, allowed for auto rebalance)\n- Network: Arbitrum One\n- Swap Fees: 1%\n\n## Further explanation and personal opinion\n#### - Why automated rebalancing?\nWeighted liquidity pools offer a mechanism to capitalize on price fluctuations within long-term holdings. I propose allocating a specific percentage of our ETH to a Balancer pool containing Arbitrum (ARB) and wrapped Ethereum (wETH). This strategy leverages the inherent price correlation between ARB and ETH on Arbitrum One, a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum.\n#### - ARB Price Volatility: \nCompared to ETH, ARB exhibits higher volatility. This characteristic presents an opportunity for profit through automated rebalancing. By the time this proposal ends a high amount of ARB tokens are unlocked, giving us a cheaper entry.\n#### - Price Movement and Rebalancing: \nPrice increases in ARB will trigger the automated sale of a portion of the asset, capturing profits in the form of wETH. Vice versa, price decreases in ARB will result in the acquisition of additional ARB tokens using wETH, effectively increasing our overall holdings in both assets.\n\n### Proposed steps / Implementation\n\n1. #### Bridging and swapping the initial amount of wETH: \nThe initial ETH allocation needs to be bridged to Arbitrum One, resulting in arbETH. Then, swapped from arbETH to arbwETH, keeping 0,01 arbETH for future transaction fees.\n2. #### ARB Token Acquisition: \n30% of the arbwETH will be swapped for ARB tokens.\n3. #### Liquidity Pool Creation: \nThe combined arbwETH and ARB tokens will be deposited into a newly created Balancer pool.\n\n\n| Voting Option | ETH in LP (60%) | ARB in LP (30%) | Initial ETH / combined amount |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n|  1.         |  6,0         |    30% of combined ETH      |   10       |\n|   2.        |   7,2        |    30% of combined ETH      |      12     |\n|    3.       |   9,0        |    30% of combined ETH       |    15       |\n",

      "title": "Staking CAKE on the PancakeSwap Pottery",
      "content": "The PancakeSwap Pottery is like normal staking but a portion of the staking rewards from the CAKE deposited will fill a prize pot and there will be one weekly draw. The current staking **APY** is **4,98%.**\n#### How does it work?\nOn deposit the CAKE will be locked for a duration of **10 weeks**, the odds of our address winning the prize pool is simply proportional to our CAKE deposit over the total CAKE deposit of the whole Pottery. Each week, **eight (8) addresses are drawn** randomly based on their odds. \n=> Simply put, if user A deposited 1 CAKE, user B deposited 2 CAKE, then user B's odds of winning is twice of user A's. There are currently about 800 - 900 players, which equals **420 CAKE per player on average**. The current **price pool is $4.4k**, leading to a **win of $550**.\n#### Chances for the voting options (10 / 20 / 50 weeks):\n- The odds of winning with an average deposit in the **10** weeks are 1 - 0,99^10 = 10% (1 lock period)\n- The odds of winning with an average deposit in **20** weeks are 1 - 0,99^20 = 19% (2 lock period)\n- The odds of winning with an average deposit in **50** weeks are 1 - 0,99^50 = 40% (5 lock period)\n#### Amount of CAKE and personal opinion\nCAKE recently fell by about 50% due long term staked cake being due, causing it to be oversold. Therefore I propose to invest $3000 into CAKE and use the recent fall in price to top up our position. This amount would be by the time of the proposal 1680 CAKE which is 4x the average locked CAKE in the pottery, greatly increasing our chances.\n![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/454290419233062954/1109508821807800410/image.png)",

The token launched with great success in late 2021. EGC is the central part of an ecosystem consisting of multiple utilities that generate income. All profits from utilities go towards buying and burning EverGrow coin. This does two things, both decreases supply of EGC (raising the price) and creates buying volume generating BUSD rewards. Rewards are automatically distributed to all holders in the form of BUSD stable coin.  \n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nThis token experienced a massive run up in its early stages with no utilities and nothing but hype taking it to a market cap of 2 Billion Dollars. It has since then pulled back and has settled into a position that creates a great price for opening an investment. EGC currently has a functional NFT marketplace (LunaSky) which is in beta and being actively developed. \n\nEGC is also extremely close to launching a wallet that intends to compete with Trust Wallet including highly sought after features such as a on / off ramp for Crypto to Fiat. A easy to use swap feature, and the ability to have multiple wallets in one convenient app. All revenue generated from utilities results in buying and burning of EverGrow coin. \n\nA investment into this project could generate a steady revenue source for DCIP to use for other investments, or to buy our own token and burn more of the supply. If our portfolio held 20 Billion EGC (approx. $1500 at current market price) and EGC manages to maintain a volume of just 10 Million dollars a day it would result in $1000 per month in BUSD income for DCIP. I propose a separate community vote to decide on how to allocate the BUSD rewards should this proposal pass.\n\nStop loss -  -40% of buy in price.\nStop gain -  None         \n    ",

With the recent market drop, $4,50 is a good entry point for the long term.\nFilecoin is open-source and decentralized, which means that all governance is in the hands of the community. On the Filecoin platform, developers have the opportunity to create cloud file storage services similar to Dropbox or iCloud. The price for storage as it is now is competitively cheap. \nIf normal consumers start to store their data on services built on FIL, we will probably see new highs in the future.",

I will name each problem, then make a suggestion for a self-imposed regulatory measures.\n\n**1.** The proposer can decide on the amounts of fund allocation without limitations. It is only capped by our current free liquidity\n\n**2.** Proposers have only benefits. They have no risks and cannot be held accountable for losses of funds.\n\n**3.** The community cannot really judge or measure the experience and effort or how much thought a proposer puts in their investment choices.\n\n### **Adressing Problem 1:**\nI suggest that a proposer has to have 10% of the maximum \"fund allocation\" value in DCIP tokens. For example, I create a proposal for more ETH with the options \"$1000, $2000 and $5000, disagree\" then I would need $500 of DCIP tokens in my wallet (10% of the highest option).\n\n### **Adressing Problem 2:**\nIf the community votes in favour to the proposal, the proposer has to give DCIP tokens equal to 10% of the amount as collateral, which is locked until the position is liquidated (like locked staking). But should the position fall below double the initial value of the collateral, the position and the collateral will both be liquidated automatically recouping some liquidity for the fund.\nFor example: $5000 investment with $500 collateral reaches $1000 (-80% loss) = 2 x $500, then the remaining $1000 assets and $500 collateral will be liquidated to flow back into our free liquidity, leading to a -70% loss instead of -80%.\nStill, the proposer gets a percentage of the profits for his collateral at risk. I'd say 6,5 % would be fair (0,7 x 500/(5000 + 500)).\n\n### **Adressing Problem 3:**\nThere's currently no way to build a reputation from previous proposals. Maybe its a good idea to add a function that gives insight into the proposal history of the adress.\n\n**For the votes:**\n- Disagree\n- Agree - with 1, 2 and 3 (pick the number for highlighting the corresponding problem)",

Im adjusting the voting option according to our availible liquidity.)_\n\nThe PancakeSwap token CAKE is the Liquidity Provider token for the PancakeSwap platform on the BEP20 chain.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\nSince DCIP is on the BEP20 chain aswell, the allocation supports this project indirectly (DCIP is on CAKE). Locked APR at these rates are attractive and generate income for our own fund here (see screenshot below). The idea would be to renew the locked staking after 52W, until we decide to liquidate the position. The token was fairly stable since Aug 22, and will very likely increase in value when volumes get back to what they were in the last bull market.\n\n## Technical details\n- **Token Name:** PancakeSwap CAKE\n- **Token Address:** 0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82 , 0x159df6b7689437016108a019fd5bef736bac692b6d4a1f10c941f6fbb9a74ca6::oft::CakeOFT\n- **Token Chain:** Binance Smart Chain, Aptos (Bridge)\n- **Audit:** CertiK, SlowMist\n- **Proof of Audit:** \nhttps://www.certik.com/projects/pancakeswap?utm_source=CMC&utm_campaign=AuditByCertiKLink and \nhttps://www.slowmist.com/security-audit-certificate.html?id=015e0e0a3ef5ea0e2bd9651c9cb47af497597d9e42b1fc13bdf46689c4a2b4f6\n- **Further Details:** https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pancakeswap/\n\n![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/407589742310588419/1088894493568274492/image.png)\n",

      "content": "**Proposal for:** Staking CAKE for 52W APR 42% interest\n\nThe PancakeSwap token CAKE is the Liquidity Provider token for the PancakeSwap platform on the BEP20 chain.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nSince DCIP is on the BEP20 chain aswell, the allocation supports the chain and has a synergy with CAKE itself (and you can trade DCIP on CAKE). Locked APR at these rates are attractive and generate income for our own fund here. The idea would be to renew the locked staking after 52W, until we decide to liquidate the position. The token was fairly stable since Aug 22. \nIf you agree, I suggest you to vote for the lower fund allocations to keep liquidity (and in case for other proposals).\n    \n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** PancakeSwap CAKE\n- **Token Address:** 0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82 ,  0x159df6b7689437016108a019fd5bef736bac692b6d4a1f10c941f6fbb9a74ca6::oft::CakeOFT\n- **Token Chain** Binance Smart Chain, Aptos (Bridge)\n- **Audit:** CertiK, SlowMist\n- **Proof of Audit:** https://www.certik.com/projects/pancakeswap?utm_source=CMC&utm_campaign=AuditByCertiKLink\n                      https://www.slowmist.com/security-audit-certificate.html?id=015e0e0a3ef5ea0e2bd9651c9cb47af497597d9e42b1fc13bdf46689c4a2b4f6\n\n### Functional details\n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pancakeswap/\n\n![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/407589742310588419/1088894493568274492/image.png)",

      "title": "Take profit from QANX investment",
      "content": "Dear fellow Dciphers!\n\nAs you know for sure, one of our investments, QANplatform, experienced a hack a few months ago and since has launched a v2 of their ecosystem token QANX a few days ago.\nSince they did a pre-hack snapshot, we hold the same amount of tokens and didn't experience any loss in investment value through the incident, quite the opposite, since the relaunch, QANX does an outstanding performance. \nThis leads us to the necessity to define a take-profit-strategy for this investment in order to take profit at the right time.\n\nI suggest the following strategies (numbers are rounded to make the following calculations easier):\n\n1) Take out initial equity + sell the remainder with a trailing take-profit-strategy. \n\nSell initial equity (3000 USD) at the price level of 0.025 USD + 50% of the remainder at 0.25 USD + the other 50% of the remainder at 0,50 USD\n\nAt the current price level of 0.025 USD per QANX, this would sum up to: 3000 USD (currently 120000 QANX) + 42500 QANX x 0.25 + 42500 QANX x 0.50 = 34975 USD\n\n\n2) Take out 50% at 0.10 USD + 25% at 0.20 USD + 25% at 0.50 USD.\n\nAt the current price level of 0.025 USD per QANX, this would sum up to: 102500 QANX x 0.10 + 51250 QANX x 0.20 + 51250 QANX x 0.50 = 46125 USD\n\n\n3) Take out 50% at 0.20 USD + 25% at 0.30 USD + 25% at 0.40 USD.\n\nAt the current price level of 0.025 USD per QANX, this would sum up to: 102500 QANX x 0.20 + 51250 QANX x 0.30 + 51250 QANX x 0.40 = 56375 USD\n\n\n4 - ((Disagree)) Take out 50% at 0.25 USD + 25% at 0.50 USD + 25% at 0.75 USD.\n\nAt the current price level of 0.025 USD per QANX, this would sum up to: 102500 QANX x 0.25 + 51250 QANX x 0.50 + 51250 QANX x 0.75 = 89687,50 USD\n\n\nOf course, our tokenomics will be applied on these sums and initial equity will go back into the community investment wallet, therefore the total payout amount to holders bags will be slightly lower than the calculated numbers above.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, also propose to directly reinvest the initial equity of our QANX investment + all fees, which go to the community investment wallet (2% of the total profit), into 50% BTC and 50% ETH and to add this ETH to our validator node if possible or to stake it otherwise.\n\n\nI do not offer a \"no\" option, since I think, it is of utmost importance to set a take profit strategy. Profits are only profits, if you take them out. Until then, they are unrealized gains.\n    ",

As I recall, some of the DCIP community didn’t want to invest in the troubled coin initially. Feel free to comment or vote. It’s important to reevaluate our portfolio in anticipation of a future bull run.\n\nWe have a few options we may consider:\n\n1) Take 100% of the profits above the initial investment, and place them back into the investment wallet\n\n2) Liquidate the entire holding\n\n3) Withdraw our initial investment, and keep the “house money” invested",

SuperRare emerged from its 1.0 version, where the core team hand-picked and approved artists to mint their works on a shared smart contract as SuperRare NFTs. SuperRare 2.0 changed that by introducing web-scale curation, independently running storefronts on the platform, and sovereign minting contracts for the artists to mint, promote, and sell their works directly to collectors.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nSuperRare is one of the best place for NFT.\n    ",

Businesses use VeChain's fully functional Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) product called ToolChain to build their blockchain-based solutions. VeChainThor also supports smart contracts.\n\nSingle transactions on the VeChainThor blockchain can carry out multiple tasks. In addition, VeChain app users don’t need to hold any crypto to perform transactions. This can be done instead by the app owners, which can make the user experience more convenient for the average user.\n\nThe VeChainThor blockchain uses Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus, which delegates power to certain nodes in the VeChainThor blockchain for confirming transactions. This means that it only passes transactional blocks through Authority Masternodes that need to hold at least 25,000,000 VET.\n\nPartnerships \n\nChina National Level partnership Direct Imported Goods (D.I.G) China Unicom Kuehne & Nagel DB Schenker BMW Group LVMH Groupe Renault Fanghuwang iTaotaoke Bright Food LogSafer Shanghai eGrid Consulting Co.

The ATH Was at 0.27$ we can now acumulate the token for 0.018$ thats an steal and an easy 10x. We only need to hold it on the wallet and also generate VeThor tokens. As this Projekt goes on more Companys will join the train. In my opinion this is a long term Projekt.",

      "content": "\nVeChain\n\nVechain aims to improve supply chains with blockchain technology. \n\n- Vet\n- Token\n- The VeChainThor blockchain\n- Launched\n- https://www.vechain.org/whitepaper/\n\nThe VeChainThor blockchain works similarly to other business-use blockchain platforms. Businesses use VeChain's fully functional Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) product called ToolChain to build their blockchain-based solutions. VeChainThor also supports smart contracts.\n\nSingle transactions on the VeChainThor blockchain can carry out multiple tasks. In addition, VeChain app users don’t need to hold any crypto to perform transactions. This can be done instead by the app owners, which can make the user experience more convenient for the average user.\n\nThe VeChainThor blockchain uses Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus, which delegates power to certain nodes in the VeChainThor blockchain for confirming transactions. This means that it only passes transactional blocks through Authority Masternodes that need to hold at least 25,000,000 VET.\n\nPartnerships\nChina National Level partnership\nDirect Imported Goods (D.I.G)\nChina Unicom\nKuehne & Nagel\nDB Schenker\nBMW Group\nLVMH\nGroupe Renault\nFanghuwang\niTaotaoke\nBright Food\nLogSafer\nShanghai eGrid Consulting Co.

The ATH Was at 0.27$ we can now acumulate the token for 0.016$ thats an steal. We only need to hold it on the wallet and also generate VeThor tokens. As this Projekt goes on more Companys will join the train. In my opinion this is a long term Projekt. \n\n    ",

New projects may come and go, fail or thrive; but Bitcoin, already called digital gold, has shown that it keeps its relevance and will probably indicate the market even in the far future, while the adaptation of the blockchain technology continues.\n",

One vital aspect for the mainstream adoption and success of these blockchains is the communication between these separate networks.\n\nEfficient, fast communication will keep transaction fees low and facilitate the growth of Decentralised Finance. However, until recently, individual blockchains were not designed with this in mind. Cosmos, calling itself “The Internet of Blockchains”, has plans to change this.\n\n\n### Personal thoughts ###\nIn the future, layer 0's will be needed to connect all the layer 1 blockchains together in order to get the crypto sector massively adopted.\nRight now there's a race going on between Polkadot and Cosmos, the only big layer 0's out there. In future I expected one of them to fail and one of them winning the run and having a big marketcap share (due to the depence of it to the whole sector) Both have their advantages and disadvantages, which one can find here https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/polkadot-vs-cosmos/ . Considering the (dis)advantages of either of them, I estimate the chances of winning 50 / 50%. We already have some polkadot, so adding Cosmos adding would be a great investment.\nDive in the whitepapers of both and discover the huge potential this projects have. Personally I think layer 0 could be bigger then Bitcoin, The whole system would run on that network.\n\n    ",

Let's show all future dciphers that we were early birds!\nBitcoin has clearly found a bottom at around $19.000 to $21.000. \nWhen the price rises again it'll look better in a shorter amount of time for our portfolio.\nI think BTC will be forever relevant becoming so called digital gold. Having more BTC back the DCIP token would be a valueable move!\n\n### Functional details (you might have heard about this coin... :D)\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency originally described in a 2008 whitepaper by a person, or group of people, using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. It was launched soon after, in January 2009.\n\nBitcoin is a peer-to-peer online currency, meaning that all transactions happen directly between equal, independent network participants, without the need for any intermediary to permit or facilitate them. Bitcoin was created, according to Nakamoto’s own words, to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”\n\nSome concepts for a similar type of a decentralized electronic currency precede BTC, but Bitcoin holds the distinction of being the first-ever cryptocurrency to come into actual use.\n    ",

The platform’s creators claim that it is typically cheaper than traditional, mainstream booking platforms.\n- > Current CEO and co-founder Juan Otero brings a wealth of experience in some of the largest tech companies in the world including Oracle and Booking.com.\n- > Travala.com (AVA) has a circulating supply of 51,140,587 tokens and a maximum supply of 61,011,389 AVA as of May 2021\n- > In terms of popularity Travala.com currently has 170.7K Followers on twitter.\n- > Platform had 55% growth from Jan22 to Sep22\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nThe goal of Travala.com is to make crypto payments a mainstream option in the travel industry. Travala.com also bills itself as a cheaper alternative to the traditional booking methods due to the fact that it has no hidden costs and has more transparent practices. Therefore, the position would be a long term investment. I think it's a neat project, and even without the crypto project behind it has a well-made website. Check out their site: https://www.travala.com/\nThe fact that they thrive and survived the crypto crash and the decrease in tourism due to the pandemic speaks for itself!\n    ",

While there are lots of legitimate, valuable crypto projects, there are also fraud cases in the industry, and even advanced users can fall victim to them.\nOwnership of Assets/Decentralization. Most of the crypto trading volume goes through centralized exchanges (CEXes), to whom users grant custody over their assets. Using CEXes is convenient, however, the exchange may deny access to the funds at any time, or fall victim to a hack, causing the funds to be irreversibly lost.

      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** Coinweb - Cross-Chain computation\n\nCoinweb is unifying blockchains to achieve maximum transaction speed, lowest costs and most secure transactions. \n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** Coinweb [CWEB]\n- **Token Address:** 0x505b5eda5e25a67e1c24a2bf1a527ed9eb88bf04\n- **Token Type:** Token\n- **Token Chain** Ethereum\n- **Stage:** Mainnet isn't launched yet\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** https://coinweb.io/files/Coinweb-Whitepaper.pdf\n- **Team doxxed:** Yes\n- **Proof of dox:** https://coinweb.io/team/\n- **Smart contract public:** Yes\n- **Audit:** Yes\n- **Proof of Audit:** https://hacken.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Coinweb_22122021SCAudit_Report_4.pdf\n- **LP Lock:** Yes\n\n### Functional details\n\nCoinweb is a layer 2 protocol on which developers can build their applications. The developers don't have to choose between blockchains, because the protocol determines on which blockchain certain data has to be saved (based on the different advantages of the blockchains like security, costs and speed). When this is possible, massive adoption of crypto in the real world is able to become reality. Please take a look at their website and you'll be convinced!\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nThe extreme good usecase and the uniqueness of this project makes that I'm very bullish on this project for the long term. The project team is working on it for 3 years already. The marketcap is 16 million at the time of writing. To be short: a truely hidden GEM that definitely belongs to our portolio :)\n    ",

These may pay off in the next bull run, but it has deterred people from investing in DCIP. Let’s build a solid foundation and renew public faith.\n\n I propose we take advantage of the current market and make heavy ongoing investments in BTC during this market low point. \n\n BTC is probably the cryptocurrency with the least risk in investing in and it is likely at or will be at its next low point soon, before entering the next bull run (2023/2024/2025).\n\nI propose we commit to investing a fixed percentage of all our investment funds in BTC while the BTC price remains below 32k USD, in an ongoing fashion.\n\nOnce BTC surpasses 32k I propose we halt BTC investments and reevaluate our position. \n\nI also propose that if this proposal be voted in to our portfolio in any fashion, we commit to marketing our investment strategy in BTC to the public. Community and DCIP leaders alike should let the public know that we are taking full advantage of this BTC low point. This will entice new investors and possibly bring back old investors that have sold their DCIP shares. This will also create more cash flow for investing in BTC at this low position. Depending on how many people we reach it could also pump DCIP’s price point (but that’s not the immediate goal here, albeit welcome). \n\nWe as a community will have many opportunities and plenty of time to invest in other ALT coins and possibly new coins during the next crypto bull run. I implore this community to take action now and build a solid foundation of BTC while the prices are low. This will have nothing but a positive impact on our portfolio and community in the future. \n\n\nFirst option - Decline Proposal altogether \n\nSecond Option ($438) - invest 50% of all community investment funds in BTC in an ongoing fashion until BTC reaches a price point of $32k (USD)\n\nThird Option ($658) - invest 65% of all community investment funds in BTC in an ongoing fashion until BTC reaches a price point of $32k (USD)\n\nFourth Option ($877) - invest 80% of all community investment funds in BTC in an ongoing fashion until BTC reaches a price point of $32k (USD)\n    ",

      "title": "Electra Protocol - XEP",
      "content": "\n\n**Proposal for:** \n\nElectra Protocol \n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** Electra Protocol - XEP\n- **Token Address:** 0xb897D0a0f68800f8Be7D69ffDD1c24b69f57Bf3e\n- **Token Type:** Token\n- **Token Chain** Binance Smart Chain\n- **Stage:** Launched\n- **Team doxxed:** Yes\n- **Smart contract public:** Yes\n- **Audit:** Yes\n- **LP Lock:** Yes\n\n### Functional details\n\n  Electra Protocol is a proof-of-stake open-source platform that runs on an ever-developing and improving blockchain. Its core purpose is to build a fast and secure cryptocurrency that allows transactions to occur at a considerably lower than average processing fee rate.\n\nWith a team of coordinators and developers from across the globe, this community-based project aims to be the first and most widely used cryptocurrency on the market. With its native coin XEP, Electra Protocol perceives itself as becoming a popular payment processing option, using data money without the complexities of the current forms of payment infrastructures.\n\nElectra Protocol Features\n\nElectra Protocol by itself is a standalone, ultra-fast, and secure form of data money with near-zero processing fees. When placed together with its flagship product, ElectaPay, one can witness its true potential.\n\nElectraPay is a payment solution for e-commerce merchants who are looking for the alternative payment methods that cryptocurrency provides. In other words, it is a complete financial management system that will allow merchants to quickly adopt an alternative payment method that is not dependent upon payment service providers, banks, or credit card companies to complete transactions. This unique payment solution will offer many advantages that traditional payment platforms fail to give merchants. These benefits include lower transaction fees, immediate access to funds, and state-of-the-art security provided by the Electra Protocol blockchain, all while maintaining an incredibly fast transaction speed.\n\nIn regards to the client end, ElectraPay will offer the same advantages of speed and security. In the event there is a problem with the transaction, ElectraPay will automatically refund the customer, which is an unusual feature in the crypto world.\n\nWhat Makes Electra Protocol Unique\n\nOne of Electra Protocol's unique selling proposition is the project's community. When looking at social media channels such as Telegram, Discord, Twitter, and Facebook, the project has shown strong community growth as others learn about Electra Protocol. The Electra Protocol core team's average age is over 35 years old, with the majority of team members bringing more than 15 years of professional business experience to the table, which has greatly supported the project's business development.\n\nIn addition to ElectraPay, Electra Protocol is expanding its scope from not only being a payment focused coin to a project that can facilitate multiple use cases. An example of this is a pilot currently taking place with a company in the food production industry that uses the Electra Protocol blockchain for product traceability in its supply chain. The first responses from the company's international customers are very positive. This feedback has encouraged the team to continue to explore this path.\n\nThe Electra Protocol team is currently working towards a business model that will provide partners with all the necessary software and tools to enable the project's technology monetization. First contacts with European companies have been established, with interest in utilizing either the Electra Protocol Ecosystem or a refurbished closed source version of it.\n\nElectra Protocol takes great pride in the fact that it is a member of the prestigious Electronic Transactions Association (ETA). Among ETA members are such names as Google, Amazon, Bank of America, Apple, and Worldpay. As a member, Electra Protocol is taking its seat and joining committees that contribute to ETA's focus on payment technologies. The opportunity to be a part of the association will help Electra Protocol as it continues to grow its network of key industry groups and individuals.    ",

      "title": "Solana",
      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** Solana - SOL\n\nSolana is a decentralized blockchain built to enable scalable, user-friendly apps for the world.\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** Solana, SOL\n- **Token Type:** Token\n- **Token Chain** Solana\n- **Stage:** Running\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf\n\n### Functional details\n\nTop10 MC on coinmarketcap(#7)\n\nSolana is a highly functional open source project that banks on blockchain technology’s permissionless nature to provide decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. While the idea and initial work on the project began in 2017, Solana was officially launched in March 2020 by the Solana Foundation with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nThe Solana protocol is designed to facilitate decentralized app (DApp) creation. It aims to improve scalability by introducing a proof-of-history (PoH) consensus combined with the underlying proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus of the blockchain.\n\nBecause of the innovative hybrid consensus model, Solana enjoys interest from small-time traders and institutional traders alike. A significant focus for the Solana Foundation is to make decentralized finance accessible on a larger scale.\n\nWho Are the Founders of Solana? Anatoly Yakovenko is the most important person behind Solana. His professional career started at Qualcomm, where he quickly moved up the ranks and became senior staff engineer manager in 2015. Later on, his professional path shifted, and Yakovenko entered a new position as a software engineer at Dropbox\n\nIn 2017, Yakovenko started working on a project which would later materialize as Solana. He teamed up with his Qualcomm colleague Greg Fitzgerald, and they founded a project called Solana Labs. Attracting several more former Qualcomm colleagues in the process, the Solana protocol and SOL token were released to the public in 2020.\n\nWhat Makes Solana Unique? One of the essential innovations Solana brings to the table is the proof-of-history (PoH) consensus developed by Anatoly Yakovenko. This concept allows for greater scalability of the protocol, which in turn boosts usability.\n\nSolana is known in the cryptocurrency space because of the incredibly short processing times the blockchain offers. Solana’s hybrid protocol allows for significantly decreased validation times for both transaction and smart contract execution. With lightning-fast processing times, Solana has attracted a lot of institutional interest as well.\n\nThe Solana protocol is intended to serve both small-time users and enterprise customers alike. One of Solana’s main promises to customers is that they will not be surprised by increased fees and taxes. The protocol is designed in such a way as to have low transaction costs while still guaranteeing scalability and fast processing.\n\nThis came on the back of an impressive bull run, where Solana price gained over 700% since mid-July 2021. The launch of the Degenerate Ape NFT collection sent SOL price to an all-time high (ATH) above $60, and it has been climbing since, largely due to higher developer activity on the Solana ecosystem, greater institutional interest, growing DeFi ecosystem, and the rise of the NFTs and gaming vertical on Solana. Solana price rose to an ATH of $216 on Sept. 9, 2021.\n\nSolana has received much praise for its\nspeed and performance, and has even been tipped as a rival that can compare to Ethereum and challenge the dominant smart contract platform. However, the network has been plagued by repeated outages that have impaired its price and aspirations to be the \"Visa of crypto.\" Furthermore, its ecosystem is accused of favoring venture capital investors with unfair tokenomics.\n\nThis has led to a retrace in the price of SOL as of February 2022, and more short-term bearish price action cannot be ruled out. However, in the long run, Solana should appreciate thanks to strong support from exchanges like FTX.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nThis is solid project and is in top10 cryptos so we should invest in this. And there is possibility to stake also but haven't read how much is the reward from this.\n\nWe don't have much funds to allocate but let's allocate what we have. Let's see does this be accepted now. :)",

      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** CoinWeb\n\nCoinweb fixes blockchain’s biggest problems. We’re making usable blockchain technology that’s more collaborative, better connected, and accessible for everyone.\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** CoinWeb (CWEB)\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** https://coinweb.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Coinweb-Whitepaper.pdf\n- **Marketcap:** 15 million USD\n- **Token Address:** 0x505b5eda5e25a67e1c24a2bf1a527ed9eb88bf04\n- **Token Type:** Token\n- **Token Chain** Ethereum\n- **Stage:** Launched\n- **Team doxxed:** Yes\n- **Proof of dox:** https://coinweb.io/discover/\n- **Smart contract public:** Yes\n- **LP Lock:** Yes\n- **LP Lock proof:** https://coinweb.io/files/Tokenomics.pdf\n\n### Functional details\n\nCoinweb is a blockchain infrastructure project founded in 2017 that aims to solve the existing blockchain problems and ensure that blockchain technology is safe and easy to use for all. It seeks to provide an answer to most blockchain technology shortcomings that have hindered both mainstream and enterprise adoption.\nCoinweb is pushing towards mass adoption of Blockchain technology, and the most viable if the not only way to achieve that is by scaling. The key to scaling is making it easier for everyone to use, just like it is easier to use the internet and computers today. With Coinweb, you will be able to use different blockchains at the same time, as if they are one blockchain.\n\nAs said, the project started in late 2017, which means that the platform have had 5 years of development ahead. Next year the mainnet will go live. I'm sure the price of CoinWeb will begin to rise in the period towards Q1 2023. Furthermore, the CTO of CoinWeb has an advanced degree in Computer Engineering and worked for Google. The CEO has experience in setting up companies from the beginning. \n\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nIn recent years there has been a lot of experimentation with crypto, but in the coming years I expect that crypto will be used on a large scale within the business community and government agencies. Because every blockchain offers different benefits (speed, power consumption, security) and every application within the business requires different properties, CoinWeb will play a major role in this transition. The potential market cap is therefore infinitely large. The current market cap is 15 million. In short: a real hidden GEM.\n    ",

      "title": "LUNA - Supreme Reversal Potential ",
      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** LUNA\n\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** LUNA\n- **Token Address:** 0x156ab3346823B651294766e23e6Cf87254d68962\n\n- **Token Type:** [Token,\n- **Token Chain** [Binance Smart Chain\n\nWhat Is Terra (LUNA)?\n\nTerra is a blockchain protocol that uses fiat-pegged stablecoins to power price-stable global payments systems. According to its white paper, Terra combines the price stability and wide adoption of fiat currencies with the censorship-resistance of Bitcoin (BTC) and offers fast and affordable settlements.\n\nDevelopment on Terra began in January 2018, and its mainnet officially launched in April 2019. As of September 2021, it offers stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar, South Korean won, Mongolian tugrik and the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights basket of currencies — and it intends to roll out additional options.\n\nTerra's native token, LUNA, is used to stabilize the price of the protocol's stablecoins. LUNA holders are also able to submit and vote on governance proposals, giving it the functionality of a governance token.\n\nWho Are the Founders of Terra?\n\nTerra was founded in January 2018 by Daniel Shin and Do Kwon. The two conceived of the project as a way to drive the rapid adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency through a focus on price stability and usability. Kwon took on the position of CEO of Terraform Labs, the company behind Terra.\n\nPrior to developing Terra, Shin co-founded and headed Ticket Monster, otherwise known as TMON — a major South Korean e-commerce platform. He later co-founded Fast Track Asia, a startup incubator working with entrepreneurs to build fully functional companies.\n\nKwon previously founded and served as CEO of Anyfi, a startup providing decentralized wireless mesh networking solutions. He has also worked as a software engineer for Microsoft and Apple.\n\nWhat Makes Terra Unique?\n\nTerra seeks to set itself apart through its use of fiat-pegged stablecoins, stating that it combines the borderless benefits of cryptocurrencies with the day-to-day price stability of fiat currencies. It keeps its one-to-one peg through an algorithm that automatically adjusts stablecoin supply based on its demand. It does so by incentivizing LUNA holders to swap LUNA and stablecoins at profitable exchange rates, as needed, to either expand or contract the stablecoin supply to match demand.\n\nTerra has established a number of partnerships with payments platforms, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. In July 2019, Terra announced a partnership with Chai, a South Korea-based mobile payments application, in which purchases made using the application on e-commerce platforms are processed via the Terra blockchain network. Each transaction is subject to (on average) a 2%–3% fee charged to the merchant.\n\nIn addition, Terra is supported by the Terra Alliance, a group of businesses and platforms advocating for the adoption of Terra. In February 2019, the company announced that e-commerce platforms from 10 different countries, representing a user base of 45 million and a gross merchandise value of $25 billion, were members of the alliance.\n\nTerra's Role for UST\n\nThe LUNA token and UST are mutually dependent, as the success of the Terra ecosystem is a function of the adoption of UST as a stablecoin. LUNA backs UST and is burned when demand for UST rises. Following upgrades like Columbus-5, the supply of LUNA could become highly deflationary in the long run.\n\nOn the flip side, the value of LUNA can also decrease if UST is perceived as unstable. UST briefly lost its peg following the Wormhole hack, leading to a temporary price crash for LUNA.\n",

They are about to going to have its own blockchain(making it a coin itself) the Max supply is 21 million. everyday 7200 satozhis are mined and distributed among people who burnt them. The more you burn, the more you will recieve. Currently about 10 million of satoz are in circulation, making it deflationary currency controlled by holders. PS: The max supply possible of satoz is 21 millions.\n\nSatozhi - The first Proof of Burn Coin ever. which is better than bitcoin mining and ethereum mining. because the mining is in the blockchain cloud. which is uncostly and saves up eletricity Maybe it is going to be 15-20# top cryptos in the World due to voluntary burn.\n\n• Its liquidity is locked ( 78 years)\n\n• It has an audit from certik (credibility of the project)\n\n• It will have its own blockchain\n\n• it has a bridge to tron blokchain\n\n• out of 21 million tokens, about 11 millions have been burned already.\n\n• currently supply is about 10 millions which is decreasing everyday because investors keep burning more coins.\n\n• once you burn some of your coins in satozhi decentralized burning pools, you will have a lifetime passive income forever directly to your wallet.\n\n• Satozhi will operates in the gaming world too\n\n• The Devs are working pretty hard and they have already developed the Satoz Wallet which you can download at google play store.

      "title": "TITANO INVESTMENT ",
      "content": "\nProposal for: TITANO\n\nAuto Staking Protocol/DEX\n\nTechnical details: Titano is positioned to lead a revolution in DeFi with the Titano Autostaking Protocol or TAP, a new financial protocol that makes staking easier, and gives $TITANO token holders the highest stable returns in crypto\n\nTAP gives the Titano token automatic staking and compounding features, and the highest Fixed APY in the market 102,483.58%, a daily ROI (Return On Investment) of 1.917%. \n\nTitano is a developer based company focused on innovation that creates benefits and value for Titano token holders. Our TAP protocol isused in the Titano token giving it exception benefits for holders of $TITANO: \n\nEasy and Safe – We provide autostaking right in your wallet when you purchase $TITANO. No need to move your tokens to \n\nour website. From the minute you buy, you are staked, and set to receive rebase rewards. The easiest auto-staking in DeFi. \n\nA Fixed APY – APYs that fluctuate means you can never tell how many tokens you will receive. Other DeFi protocols pay out a high APY that can fluctuate by 90% in a day. TAP pays $TITANO holders a fixed interest rate of 1.917% daily or with compounding 102,483.58% annually, that tops the industry. \n\nFast Rebase Rewards. Other popular staking protocols pay rebasing rewards every 8 hours which means if you want to unstake you have to time it to get maximum rewards. The Titano Auto-staking Protocol pays every 30 minutes or 48 times every day, making it the fastest auto-staking protocol in crypto. \n\nThe TAP uses a complex set of factors to support its price and the rebase rewards. It also uses game theory and human nature to determine the most likely habits of those who \n\nbuy the token. Our development team has coordinated all of these elements so they work seamlessly behind the scenes. The result is a simple and elegant staking and rewards system for $TITANO holders. \n\nThe TAP is as flexible as it is powerful and will be used as the foundation for a range of Titano products, services, and projects going forward. Each will transform a different area of crypto. \n\n- Token Name: TITANO\n\n- Token Website: Titano.finance \n\n- Token Address: 0x4e3cABD3AD77420FF9031d19899594041C420aeE\n\n- Token Type: Auto Staking Token\n\n- Token Chain: Binance Smart Chain\n\n- Stage: Launched\n\n\n- Link to the whitepaper: https://docs.titano.finance/\n\n- Team doxxed: No\n\n- Smart contract public: Yes\n\n- Audit: Yes/Certik\n\n- Proof of Audit: https://www.certik.com/projects/titano\n\n- LP Lock: Yes v1 is locked v2 will be locked soon\n\n- LP Lock proof: v1 lock https://bscscan.com/token/0x44f382cec44c33067cb12fcfc08457eb6734be02?a=0xc765bddb93b0d1c1a88282ba0fa6b2d00e3e0c83\n\nFunctional details\n\nEverything I posted up above covers the info about Titano. I'll list below my personal feelings.\n\nFund allocation and personal opinion\n\nI have been in Titano since the first week of Jan. Stayed with them through the hack. My first investment was $1400. My current one is $10,000. I took a little over my roi out 45 days after my first investment. Since then I invested another $10,000. Granted it's down right now I still have an immense amount of faith in the project. They have kept up with every commitment they have made to the community and have dealt with multiple issue on an extremely professional level. They released their DEX this past week and so far it has gone pretty smooth. The DEX is going to bring huge value to the project and I think we should not only invest but we should apply yo be listed on their DEX. I will post their last discord announcement so the DCIP community can see the potential in a partnership with them. Depending on our investment amount I think we should take profit \n\nevery other month or every quarter. Every other month would be if we invested $20,000 or more every quarter would be $15,000 or less so it gives us time to compund more for a better return for DCIP holders. Once we reach a good amount of monthly returns then we could possibly take profit every month. I listen to every ama so I'm up to date on everything that's said and weather we invest or bit we should still apply to be on Titano DEX.\n\n    \nTitano Announcement 4/27/2022 8am \n\nSWYCH Onboarding & Partnerships \n\nAnnouncement @everyone \n\nWe are excited to announce that the Titano team is preparing to launch an onboarding campaign to welcome new projects to SWYCH, our new Decentralised Exchange. \n\nIn the next few days, an application will go live on the site, inviting projects to join us on our new DEX! These projects will enjoy significant benefits in moving to SWYCH, including: \n\nHuge Savings\nSWYCH will burn all the new project tokens collected through fees. That amounts to 50% of all transaction fees collected! This acts as a deflationary measure for their projects to stabilise their token price. It also means they no longer have to worry about their DEX collecting and selling their tokens on the open market. In short, this means less volatility for their project, and massive savings against other DEXs.\n\nA Larger Audience\n\nWe will announce their project joining SWYCH, and promote the onboarding of every project through our socials and on our weekly podcast. With over 80k wallet holders, and more than 125k people on our socials, Titano has one of the largest and most active communities in DeFi. We can get the word out on any project that joins SWYCH! \n\nUtility and Marketing \nIn the coming weeks and months we will be rolling out multiple utilities for SWYCH. From staking to farming, to NFTs and more, we are developing ways to help our partner projects grow and provide utility to their investors. Alongside these exciting developments, we will be spending significant money on marketing; from press releases to featured articles and interviews in major publications and channels. We want everyone involved in SWYCH to benefit from these promotional activities.\n",

      "title": "SOLANA - Blockchain",
      "content": "\nProposal for: Solana\n\nSolana is a decentralized blockchain built to enable scalable, user-friendly apps for the world.\n\nTechnical details\n\nToken Name: Solana, SOL Token Chain Solana Stage: Running Link to the whitepaper: https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf\n\nFunctional details\n\nWhat Is Solana (SOL)?\n\nSolana is a highly functional open source project that banks on blockchain technology’s permissionless nature to provide decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. While the idea and initial work on the project began in 2017, Solana was officially launched in March 2020 by the Solana Foundation with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of Solana.\n\nThe Solana protocol is designed to facilitate decentralized app (DApp) creation. It aims to improve scalability by introducing a proof-of-history (PoH) consensus combined with the underlying proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus of the blockchain.\n\nBecause of the innovative hybrid consensus model, Solana enjoys interest from small-time traders and institutional traders alike. A significant focus for the Solana Foundation is to make decentralized finance accessible on a larger scale.\n\nWho Are the Founders of Solana?\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko is the most important person behind Solana. His professional career started at Qualcomm, where he quickly moved up the ranks and became senior staff engineer manager in 2015. Later on, his professional path shifted, and Yakovenko entered a new position as a software engineer at Dropbox.\n\nIn 2017, Yakovenko started working on a project which would later materialize as Solana. He teamed up with his Qualcomm colleague Greg Fitzgerald, and they founded a project called Solana Labs. Attracting several more former Qualcomm colleagues in the process, the Solana protocol and SOL token were released to the public in 2020.\n\nWhat Makes Solana Unique?\n\nOne of the essential innovations Solana brings to the table is the proof-of-history (PoH) consensus developed by Anatoly Yakovenko. This concept allows for greater scalability of the protocol, which in turn boosts usability.\n\nSolana is known in the cryptocurrency space because of the incredibly short processing times the blockchain offers. Solana’s hybrid protocol allows for significantly decreased validation times for both transaction and smart contract execution. With lightning-fast processing times, Solana has attracted a lot of institutional interest as well.\n\nThe Solana protocol is intended to serve both small-time users and enterprise customers alike. One of Solana’s main promises to customers is that they will not be surprised by increased fees and taxes. The protocol is designed in such a way as to have low transaction costs while still guaranteeing scalability and fast processing.\n\nCombined with the longstanding professional expertise creators Anatoly Yakovenko and Greg Fitzgerald bring to the project, Solana is ranked number 7 in the CoinMarketCap ranking as of September 2021.\n\nThis came on the back of an impressive bull run, where Solana price gained over 700% since mid-July 2021. The launch of the Degenerate Ape NFT collection sent SOL price to an all-time high (ATH) above $60, and it has been climbing since, largely due to higher developer activity on the Solana ecosystem, greater institutional interest, growing DeFi ecosystem, and the rise of the NFTs and gaming vertical on Solana. Solana price rose to an ATH of $216 on Sept. 9, 2021.\n\nSolana has received much praise for its speed and performance, and has even been tipped as a rival that can compare to Ethereum and challenge the dominant smart contract platform. However, the network has been plagued by repeated outages that have impaired its price and aspirations to be the \"Visa of crypto.\" Furthermore, its ecosystem is accused of favoring venture capital investors with unfair tokenomics.\n\nThis has led to a retrace in the price of SOL as of February 2022, and more short-term bearish price action cannot be ruled out. However, in the long run, Solana should appreciate thanks to strong support from exchanges like FTX.   ",

      "title": "SOLANA - Blockchain ",
      "content": "Proposal for: Solana\n\nSolana is a decentralized blockchain built to enable scalable, user-friendly apps for the world.\n\nTechnical details\n\nToken Name: Solana, SOL\nToken Chain Solana\nStage: Running\nLink to the whitepaper: https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf\n\n### Functional details\n\n What Is Solana (SOL)?\n\nSolana is a highly functional open source project that banks on blockchain technology’s permissionless nature to provide decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. While the idea and initial work on the project began in 2017, Solana was officially launched in March 2020 by the Solana Foundation with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of Solana.\n\nThe Solana protocol is designed to facilitate decentralized app (DApp) creation. It aims to improve scalability by introducing a proof-of-history (PoH) consensus combined with the underlying proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus of the blockchain.\n\nBecause of the innovative hybrid consensus model, Solana enjoys interest from small-time traders and institutional traders alike. A significant focus for the Solana Foundation is to make decentralized finance accessible on a larger scale.\n\nWho Are the Founders of Solana?\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko is the most important person behind Solana. His professional career started at Qualcomm, where he quickly moved up the ranks and became senior staff engineer manager in 2015. Later on, his professional path shifted, and Yakovenko entered a new position as a software engineer at Dropbox.\n\nIn 2017, Yakovenko started working on a project which would later materialize as Solana. He teamed up with his Qualcomm colleague Greg Fitzgerald, and they founded a project called Solana Labs. Attracting several more former Qualcomm colleagues in the process, the Solana protocol and SOL token were released to the public in 2020.\n\nWhat Makes Solana Unique?\n\nOne of the essential innovations Solana brings to the table is the proof-of-history (PoH) consensus developed by Anatoly Yakovenko. This concept allows for greater scalability of the protocol, which in turn boosts usability.\n\nSolana is known in the cryptocurrency space because of the incredibly short processing times the blockchain offers. Solana’s hybrid protocol allows for significantly decreased validation times for both transaction and smart contract execution. With lightning-fast processing times, Solana has attracted a lot of institutional interest as well.\n\nThe Solana protocol is intended to serve both small-time users and enterprise customers alike. One of Solana’s main promises to customers is that they will not be surprised by increased fees and taxes. The protocol is designed in such a way as to have low transaction costs while still guaranteeing scalability and fast processing.\n\nCombined with the longstanding professional expertise creators Anatoly Yakovenko and Greg Fitzgerald bring to the project, Solana is ranked number 7 in the CoinMarketCap ranking as of September 2021.\n\nThis came on the back of an impressive bull run, where Solana price gained over 700% since mid-July 2021. The launch of the Degenerate Ape NFT collection sent SOL price to an all-time high (ATH) above $60, and it has been climbing since, largely due to higher developer activity on the Solana ecosystem, greater institutional interest, growing DeFi ecosystem, and the rise of the NFTs and gaming vertical on Solana. Solana price rose to an ATH of $216 on Sept. 9, 2021.\n\nSolana has received much praise for its speed and performance, and has even been tipped as a rival that can compare to Ethereum and challenge the dominant smart contract platform. However, the network has been plagued by repeated outages that have impaired its price and aspirations to be the \"Visa of crypto.\" Furthermore, its ecosystem is accused of favoring venture capital investors with unfair tokenomics.\n\nThis has led to a retrace in the price of SOL as of February 2022, and more short-term bearish price action cannot be ruled out. However, in the long run, Solana should appreciate thanks to strong support from exchanges like FTX.  ",

      "title": "IOTA - Non-Blockchain Distributed Ledger ",
      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** IOTA\n\n\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** IOTA + MIOTA\n- **Token Address:** 0xd944f1d1e9d5f9bb90b62f9d45e447d989580782\n- **Token Type:** Token\n- **Token Chain** Binance Smart Chain\n- **Stage:** Launched\n- **Link to the whitepaper:Yea\n- **Team doxxed:** Yes\n- **Smart contract public:** Yes  \n- **Audit:** Yes\n\n### Functional details\n\n   IOTA is a distributed ledger with one big difference: it isn’t actually a blockchain. Instead, its proprietary technology is known as Tangle, a system of nodes that confirm transactions. The foundation behind this platform says this offers far greater speeds than conventional blockchains — and an ideal footprint for the ever-expanding Internet of Things ecosystem.\n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of IOTA.\n\nBecause there’s no blockchain, there are no miners, and because there are no miners, there are no fees. Many established networks see costs balloon when congestion intensifies, but IOTA aims to provide limitless throughput at minimal expense.\n\nIn time, IOTA’s goal is to become the de facto platform for executing transactions between IoT devices. Given how estimates suggest there could be 20.4 billion such devices out there by 2024, this could end up being big business.\n\nThe team behind IOTA believe that the potential use cases don’t end here. They believe their distributed ledger could deliver digital identities to all, result in car insurance policies that are based on actual usage, pave the way for cutting-edge smart cities, deliver seamless global trade and prove the authenticity of products.\n\nOriginally known as Jinn, a crowdsale for the project was held in September 2014, and the network officially launched in 2016.\n\nWho Are the Founders of IOTA?\n\nIOTA has four co-founders, and their names are Sergey Ivancheglo, Serguei Popov, David Sønstebø and Dominik Schiener.\n\nAccording to the IOTA Foundation, the initiative has rapidly grown since then — and team members are now based across more than 25 countries.\n\nSonstebo and Schiener are collectively co-chairmen of the board of directors, while Popov is a board member and the foundation’s director of research.\n\nIvancheglo resigned from the Berlin-based project back in June 2019 but continues as an unofficial advisor. At the time, he said in a statement: “I no longer believe that the IOTA Foundation is the best setting for me to realize what we set out to create back in 2014 and 2015. I have always done my best work in a less rigid environment. I am looking forward to continuing the work on both hardware and software development of IOTA independently.”\n\nWhat Makes IOTA Unique?\n\nWell, as we alluded to a little earlier, the fact that it’s effectively a blockchainless blockchain is rather unusual to say the least.\n\nTangle’s more technical name is the Directed Acyclic Graph — and as Sønstebø explained in a blog post back in 2015, this technology aims to retain blockchain’s ability to execute secure transactions. The only difference is that it does away with the notion of blocks.\n\nHe also wrote: “IOTA should not be considered an alternative coin (altcoin) to existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, rather it is an extension of the growing blockchain ecosystem. It’s meant to work in synergy with these other platforms to form cohesion and symbiotic relationships. IOTA is designed to provide one solution that no other crypto does: efficient, secure, lightweight, real-time micro-transactions without fees.”\n\nNew transactions are validated by approving two previous transactions from another node — and this is a novel approach because it means that the network’s size and speed will be directly related to how many people are using the platform.\n\nAnd whereas some cryptocurrencies are run as a business, the IOTA Foundation says it is firmly not for profit — adding that it has the sole goal of making the network as prosperous as possible.\n\nFinally, IOTA has distinguished itself from many other crypto rivals by establishing high-profile partnerships with the carmaker Volkswagen, and helping the city of Taipei to pursue smart projects.",

      "title": "Polygon - MATIC",
      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** Polygon - MATIC\n\nPolygon is a protocol and a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Aggregating scalable solutions on Ethereum supporting a multi-chain Ethereum ecosystem\n\n### Technical details\n\n **Token Name: Polygon - MATIC\n\n**Token Address: 0x7d1afa7b718fb893db30a3abc0cfc608aacfebb0\n\n**Token Type: ERC20 Token\n\n**Token Chain: Ethereum\n\n**Stage: Launched\n\n**Link to the whitepaper: https://polygon.technology/lightpaper-polygon.pdf\n\n**Team doxxed: Yes\n\n**Proof of dox: https://polygon.technology/about/\n\n**Smart contract public: Yes\n\nFunctional Details \n\n  What Is Polygon (MATIC)?\n\nPolygon (previously Matic Network) is the first well-structured, easy-to-use platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development. Its core component is Polygon SDK, a modular, flexible framework that supports building multiple types of applications.\n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of Polygon Matic.\n\nUsing Polygon, one can create optimistic rollup chains, ZK rollup chains, stand alone chains or any other kind of infra required by the developer.\n\nPolygon effectively transforms Ethereum into a full-fledged multi-chain system (aka Internet of Blockchains). This multi-chain system is akin to other ones such as Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche etc. with the advantages of Ethereum’s security, vibrant ecosystem and openness.\n\nThe $MATIC token will continue to exist and will play an increasingly important role, securing the system and enabling governance.\n\nPolygon (formerly Matic Network) is a Layer 2 scaling solution backed by Binance and Coinbase. The project seeks to stimulate mass adoption of cryptocurrencies by resolving the problems of scalability on many blockchains.\n\nPolygon combines the Plasma Framework and the proof-of-stake blockchain architecture. The Plasma framework used by Polygon as proposed by the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, allows for the easy execution of scalable and autonomous smart contracts.\n\nNothing will change for the existing ecosystem built on the Plasma-POS chain. With Polygon, new features are being built around the existing proven technology to expand the ability to cater to diverse needs from the developer ecosystem. Polygon will continue to develop the core technology so that it can scale to a larger ecosystem.\n\nPolygon boasts of up to 65,000 transactions per second on a single side chain, along with a respectable block confirmation time of less than two seconds. The framework also allows for the creation of globally available decentralized financial applications on a single foundational blockchain.\n\nThe Plasma framework gives Polygon the potential of housing an unlimited number of decentralized applications on their infrastructure without experiencing the normal drawbacks common on proof-of-work blockchains. So far, Polygon has attracted more than 50 DApps to its PoS-secured Ethereum sidechain.\n\nMATIC, the native tokens of Polygon, is an ERC-20 token running on the Ethereum blockchain. The tokens are used for payment services on Polygon and as a settlement currency between users who operate within the Polygon ecosystem. The transaction fees on Polygon sidechains are also paid in MATIC tokens.\n\nWho Are the Founders of Polygon?\n\nPolygon (formerly Matic Network) was launched in October 2017. Polygon was co-founded by Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwal and Anurag Arjun, two experienced blockchain developers and a business consultant.\n\nBefore moving to its network in 2019, the Polygon team was a huge contributor in the Ethereum ecosystem. The team worked on implementing the Plasma MVP, the WalletConnect protocol and the widely-used Dagger event notification engine on Ethereum.\n\nThe team included co-founder of Polygon, Jaynti Kanani. Jaynti, a full-stack developer and blockchain engineer currently serves as the CEO of Polygon.\n\nJaynti played an integral role in implementing Web3, Plasma and the WalletConnect protocol on Ethereum. Prior to his blockchain involvement, Jaynti worked as a data scientist with Housing.com.\n\nCo-founder and chief operations officer of Polygon, Sandeep Nailwal is a blockchain programmer and entrepreneur. Before jointly starting Polygon (formerly Matic), Sandeep had served as the CEO of Scopeweaver, and the chief technical officer of Welspun Group.\n\nAnurag Arjun is the only non-programming co-founder of Polygon. As a product manager, he has had stints with IRIS Business, SNL Financial, Dexter Consultancy and Cognizant Technologies.\n\nWhat Makes Polygon Unique?\n\nPolygon is self-described as a Layer 2 scaling solution, which means that the project doesn’t seek to upgrade its current basic blockchain layer any time soon. The project focuses on reducing the complexity of scalability and instant blockchain transactions.\n\nPolygon uses a customized version of the Plasma framework which is built on proof-of-stake checkpoints that run through the Ethereum main-chain. This unique technology allows each sidechain on Polygon to achieve up to 65,536 transactions per block.\n\nCommercially, the sidechains of Polygon are structurally designed to support a variety of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols available in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nWhile Polygon currently supports only Ethereum basechain, the network intends to extend support for additional basechains, based on community suggestions and consensus. This would makePolygon an interoperable decentralized Layer 2 blockchain platform\n\nPolygon (MATIC) London Hard Fork and EIP-1559 Upgrade\n\nPolygon announced the much-anticipated London Hard Fork and Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 upgrade will go live on the mainnet on Jan. 18, 2022. The upgrade will completely change the way the fee mechanism works on the Ethereum network — it eliminates first-price auction as the main fee calculation mechanism and instead uses a base fee that is burned, instead of sent to miners. Although it does not lower transaction fees, it makes it more stable, allowing users to estimate costs better and reduce overpayment.\n\nHowever, as MATIC tokens are burned as base fees — and MATIC has a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens — it will have a deflationary effect on the digital asset. Polygon’s core team projected an annual burn of MATIC amounting to 0.27% of the token’s total supply — around 27 million tokens. This deflationary pressure will most likely benefit validators and delegators the most, as rewards for processing transactions on Polygon are denominated in MATIC. Furthermore, base fee will increase automatically once the block is filled up, resulting in fewer spam transactions and less network congestion. Ethereum mainnet’s London Hard Fork went live on Aug. 5, 2021.\n\nHow Many Polygon (MATIC) Tokens Are There in Circulation?\n\nMATIC tokens are released on a monthly basis. MATIC currently has a circulating supply of 4,877,830,774 MATIC tokens and a max supply of 10,000,000,000 MATIC tokens.\n\nAt its initial private sale in 2017, 3.8 percent of MATIC’s max supply was issued. In the April 2019 launchpad sale, another 19 percent of the total supply was sold. The MATIC price was $0.00263 per token, and $5 million was generated.\n\nThe remaining MATIC tokens are distributed as follows:\n\nTeam tokens: 16 percent of the total supply.\nAdvisors tokens: 4 percent of the total supply.\nNetwork Operations tokens: 12 percent of the total supply.\nFoundation tokens: 21.86 percent of the total supply.\nEcosystem tokens: 23.33 percent of the total supply.\nAccording to the release schedule, all the tokens will be released by December 2022.\n\nHow Is the Polygon Secured?\n\nAs a Layer 2 solution utilizing a network of proof-of-stake validators for asset security, staking is an integral part of the Polygon ecosystem. Validators on the network will stake their MATIC tokens as collateral to become part of the network’s PoS consensus mechanism and will receive MATIC tokens in return.\n\nMembers of the network who do not wish to become validators can delegate their MATIC tokens to another validator, but will still take part in their staking process and earn staking rewards.\n\nIn addition to the proof-of-stake checkpointing, Polygon uses block producers at the block producer layer to achieve a higher degree of decentralization. These block producers give finality to the main chains using checkpoints and fraud-proof mechanisms.",

      "title": "Invest in Solana, SOL",
      "content": "\n\n## Proposal for: Solana\n\nSolana is a decentralized blockchain built to enable scalable, user-friendly apps for the world.\n\n## Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** Solana, SOL\n- **Token Chain** Solana\n- **Stage:** Running\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf\n\n### Functional details\n\nTop10 MC on coinmarketcap(#7)\n\nSolana is a highly functional open source project that banks on blockchain technology’s permissionless nature to provide decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. While the idea and initial work on the project began in 2017, Solana was officially launched in March 2020 by the Solana Foundation with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nThe Solana protocol is designed to facilitate decentralized app (DApp) creation. It aims to improve scalability by introducing a proof-of-history (PoH) consensus combined with the underlying proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus of the blockchain.\n\nBecause of the innovative hybrid consensus model, Solana enjoys interest from small-time traders and institutional traders alike. A significant focus for the Solana Foundation is to make decentralized finance accessible on a larger scale.\n\nWho Are the Founders of Solana?\nAnatoly Yakovenko is the most important person behind Solana. His professional career started at Qualcomm, where he quickly moved up the ranks and became senior staff engineer manager in 2015. Later on, his professional path shifted, and Yakovenko entered a new position as a software engineer at Dropbox.\n\nIn 2017, Yakovenko started working on a project which would later materialize as Solana. He teamed up with his Qualcomm colleague Greg Fitzgerald, and they founded a project called Solana Labs. Attracting several more former Qualcomm colleagues in the process, the Solana protocol and SOL token were released to the public in 2020.\n\nWhat Makes Solana Unique?\nOne of the essential innovations Solana brings to the table is the proof-of-history (PoH) consensus developed by Anatoly Yakovenko. This concept allows for greater scalability of the protocol, which in turn boosts usability.\n\nSolana is known in the cryptocurrency space because of the incredibly short processing times the blockchain offers. Solana’s hybrid protocol allows for significantly decreased validation times for both transaction and smart contract execution. With lightning-fast processing times, Solana has attracted a lot of institutional interest as well.\n\nThe Solana protocol is intended to serve both small-time users and enterprise customers alike. One of Solana’s main promises to customers is that they will not be surprised by increased fees and taxes. The protocol is designed in such a way as to have low transaction costs while still guaranteeing scalability and fast processing.\n\nThis came on the back of an impressive bull run, where Solana price gained over 700% since mid-July 2021. The launch of the Degenerate Ape NFT collection sent SOL price to an all-time high (ATH) above $60, and it has been climbing since, largely due to higher developer activity on the Solana ecosystem, greater institutional interest, growing DeFi ecosystem, and the rise of the NFTs and gaming vertical on Solana. Solana price rose to an ATH of $216 on Sept. 9, 2021.\n\nSolana has received much praise for its speed and performance, and has even been tipped as a rival that can compare to Ethereum and challenge the dominant smart contract platform. However, the network has been plagued by repeated outages that have impaired its price and aspirations to be the \"Visa of crypto.\" Furthermore, its ecosystem is accused of favoring venture capital investors with unfair tokenomics.\n\nThis has led to a retrace in the price of SOL as of February 2022, and more short-term bearish price action cannot be ruled out. However, in the long run, Solana should appreciate thanks to strong support from exchanges like FTX.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nThis is solid project and is in top10 cryptos so we should invest in this. And there is possibility to stake also but haven't read how much is the reward from this. \n\nWe don't have much funds to allocate but let's allocate what we have.",

Currently satozhi released its 2022 roadmap which promises many things for its ecosystem. Satozhi will have its own blockchain.\n\n2022 Roadmap below https://twitter.com/satozhiofficial/status/1499036016031649799\n\nEcosystem: Satoz has created its decent ecosystem: -VMT Marketplace (Virtual mining tool,where you can mine satoz instead of burning via pool or website you can burn in your own vmt,which will also be a valuable asset in future)\n\nDecentralized Pools [burning satoz online]\nNFT Marketplace\nSATOZ Mobile (Lite) [ you can download it at playstore]\nZHI Game Studios (Gaming partnership)\nFund allocation and personal opinion\n\nWe can go like 600x from now if it reaches just 500million in marketcap\n\nSatozhi has a huge potential to be top coin in the future. They are about to going to have its own blockchain(making it a coin itself) the Max supply is 21 million. everyday 7200 satozhis are mined and distributed among people who burnt them. The more you burn, the more you will recieve. Currently about 10 million of satoz are in circulation, making it deflationary currency controlled by holders. PS: The max supply possible of satoz is 21 millions.\n\nSatozhi - The first Proof of Burn Coin ever. which is better than bitcoin mining and ethereum mining. because the mining is in the blockchain cloud. which is uncostly and saves up eletricity Maybe it is going to be 15-20# top cryptos in the World due to voluntary burn.\n\nIts liquidity is locked ( 78 years)\nIt has an audit from certik (credibility of the project)\nIt will have its own blockchain\nit has a bridge to tron blokchain\nout of 21 million tokens, about 11 millions have been burned already.\ncurrently supply is about 10 millions which is decreasing everyday because investors keep burning more coins.\nonce you burn some of your coins in satozhi decentralized burning pools, you will have a lifetime passive income forever directly to your wallet.\nSatozhi will operates in the gaming world too\nThe Devs are working pretty hard and they have already developed the Satoz Wallet which you can download at google play store.

I’m sure we can do the same in the Binance chain.\n\n\n\n**The main points are:\n**\n\n\n1. Remove reflections. It’s easier get token to exchanges.\n\n2. Transaction tax 1-2% Goes to investment wallet and marketing. Low tax = more volume which is most important.\n\n3. 20 - 50 the largest wallet can proposal but not vote. Others can vote. The winning proposal will be implemented when enough tax has been accumulated, for example € 30,000€.\n\n\nIf something works then you should use it. Even if the idea is someone else's. We can take good things from their idea and add them to our own idea.\n\n",

      "content": "## To verify DCIP's functionality, it's crucial to check whether investment liquidation and profit distribution among holders works as necessary. I propose the liquidation of our Qredo Token position.\n\nIn my opinion, the functionality needs to be tested in three different ways: liquidate the unrealized profit, liquidate the inital equity (initial investment) or liquidate the current equity (100% of the position including profit). Once we try out one of the three, we can test out the other two.\n\nSince the unrealized profit is around 24%, here are the choices I suggest for my proposal:\n- $25 - _liquidate 100% of the unreaized profit_\n- $75 - _liquidate 100% of the initial equity (initial investment)_\n- $100 - _liquidate 100% of the current equity (initial investment + all profit)_\n\n#### **Note: if at the time the investment is liquidated our unrealized profit is less than 5%, this proposal will be canceled. Even if unrealized profit changes, the $25 vote still means liquidating 100% of the unrealized profit unless it drops to less than 5%.**",

Currently satozhi released its 2022 roadmap which promises many things for its ecosystem. Satozhi will have its own blockchain.\n\n2022 Roadmap below \nhttps://twitter.com/satozhiofficial/status/1499036016031649799\n\nEcosystem: Satoz has created its decent ecosystem: -VMT Marketplace (Virtual mining tool,where you can mine satoz instead of burning via pool or website you can burn in your own vmt,which will also be a valuable asset in future)\n- Decentralized Pools [burning satoz online]\n- NFT Marketplace\n- SATOZ Mobile (Lite) [ you can download it at playstore]\n- ZHI Game Studios (Gaming partnership)\n\nFund allocation and personal opinion\n\nWe can go like 600x  from now if it reaches just 500million in marketcap\n\nSatozhi has a huge potential to be top coin in the future. They are about to going to have its own blockchain(making it a coin itself) the Max supply is 21 million. everyday 7200 satozhis are mined and distributed among people who burnt them. The more you burn, the more you will recieve. Currently about 10 million of satoz are in circulation, making it deflationary currency controlled by holders. PS: The max supply possible of satoz is 21 millions.\n\nSatozhi - The first Proof of Burn Coin ever. which is better than bitcoin mining and ethereum mining. because the mining is in the blockchain cloud. which is uncostly and saves up eletricity Maybe it is going to be 15-20# top cryptos in the World due to voluntary burn.\n- Its liquidity is locked ( 78 years)\n- It has an audit from certik (credibility of the project)\n- It will have its own blockchain\n- it has a bridge to tron blokchain\n- out of 21 million tokens, about 11 millions have been burned already.\n- currently supply is about 10 millions which is decreasing everyday because investors keep burning more coins.\n- once you burn some of your coins in satozhi decentralized burning pools, you will have a lifetime passive income forever directly to your wallet.\n- Satozhi will operates in the gaming world too\n- The Devs are working pretty hard and they have already developed the Satoz Wallet which you can download at google play store.

Users are able to create markets where they can speculate on any event or arbitrary outcome. \nBy using the Ethereum Protocol, Gnosis is able to guarantee a secure and transparent ecosystem. The Gnosis protocol aims to shift the paradigm by providing the world’s most efficient forecasting tool and setting a global standard for prediction markets.\n\nGnosis offers 3 main products for users of GNO and these products use 3 separate layers to deliver a proper experience for users. \n\nThe Gnosis Core Layer provides the foundational smart contracts for the Gnosis platform. The Gnosis Service Layer offers resources for consumer applications and is used for tools like chatbots and stable coins. Finally, the Gnosis Applications Layer which contains primarily front-end tools that target particular prediction markets or select customer segments. Some of the applications are built by Gnosis and some are built by 3rd parties.\n\nThe Apollo Network (Gnosis’ prediction market) allows a user to create a market for any arbitrary event where users can buy and sell positions to speculate on the outcome. As time passes or related events unfold, certain outcomes are more likely to happen which increases the value of the related tokens. Once the event has finalized, the tokens representing the final outcome receive the full value of the bets while the rest of the tokens for the other outcome become worthless.\n\n\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nThis is one of the bigger tokens on the ethereum chain where we are able to invest in. Since we need to spread our risks more over different coins, I think this one is definitely a possible candidate. The project exists since 2015 and has proven itself. This is a stable investment that could provide us a stable growth.\n    ",

      "content": "With the recent geopolitical events and such a bloody market, Qredo is the only investment we have that is still on profit.\n\nOur Bitcoin investment is almost 30% down. It's already known that when the markets come back up, Bitcoin pumps the most and usually the first. It's also one of the very very few coins that always exceeded expectations and had a new ATH every cycle. Whoever has been holding BTC throughout all these months is on a way smaller loss than our investment portfolio is for example.\n\nMeanwhile, there are a few proposals that got passed and are still pending. Timing is very important in the crypto space, and I'm afraid that when there will be enough free liquidity to complete all the pending proposals, the timing will be bad.\n\nTherefore, until alts return to a healthier state, I propose that we liquidate Qredo on a profit, cancel all the pending investments and buy Bitcoin with the money that goes in the investment wallet. When Bitcoin starts to recover and my proposal has a profit, we can liquidate this proposed ~$16k Bitcoin investment again and buy bleeding alts.\n\n1, 2, 3 = Sell Qredo, cancel all investments and buy Bitcoin with all the free liquidity (~$16k Bitcoin investment)",

      "title": "New Position in $Titano ",
      "content": "$TITANO is a BEP-20 token with an elastic supply that rewards holders using a positive rebase formula (explained below). The Titano project rewards holders with automatic compounding interest, increasing their TITANO holdings over time. \n\nToken Address: 0xba96731324de188ebc1ed87ca74544ddebc07d7f\n\nToken Type: BEP-20 Token\n\nToken Chain: Binance\n\nStage: Launched\n\nLink to Whitepaper: https://docs.titano.finance/\n\nTeam Doxxed: No\n\nListed Exchanges: CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko\n\nAudit:\n\nSolidity Audit is completed (https://solidity.finance/audits/Titano/)\n\nCertik Audit is 85% completed. (https://www.certik.com/projects/titano). The project is planning to release its v2 with Certik recommendations pretty soon. \n\nFetured News on Titano:\n\nMarketwatch https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/titano-launches-defis-first-automatic-fixed-apy-2021-12-17?tesla=y\n\nYahoo Finance: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/titano-launches-defis-first-automatic-170900951.html \n\nTitano Finance is transforming DeFi with the Titano Autostaking Protocol (TAP) that delivers the industry’s highest fixed APY (102,483.58%), rebasing rewards every 30 minutes, and a simple buy-hold-earn system that grows your portfolio in your wallet, fast.\n\nTitano highlights:\n\nHighest Fixed APY in the crypto space – 102,483.58%\nFirst Automatic Staking and Compounding in Your Wallet!\nGet Rewards every 30 Minutes/48 Times Daily!\n \nAt the end of the year and with $1000 USD of $TITANO invested, we can earn up to $1,002,758.54 USD of $TITANO at 102,483.58% APY*.\n \nHow Titano works:\n\nRisk Free Value (RFV)\nRisk-Free Value (RFV) mechanism uses a stable algorithm to ensure that a consistent 0.03958% rebase rewards are paid to Titano token holders.\n\nTitano Treasury\nThe Treasury (in BNB) provides support to the RFV in the event of an extreme price drop in the $Titano token. The Treasury also funds new Titano projects and marketing budget for Titano.\n\nAuto-Compounding Token\nCrypto’s first Auto-Staking and Auto-Compounding token with the highest Fixed APY 102,483.58%. It is backed by the RFV and further supported through the treasury.\n\nTokenomics:\n \nAutomatic LP\n5% of the trading fees return to the liquidity ensuring $TITANO's increasing its collateral value.\n\nRisk Free Value (RFV)\n5% of the trading fees are redirected to the RFV which helps sustain and back the staking rewards provided by the positive rebase.\n\n \nTreasury\n3% of the all purchases and 8% of all sales go directly to the treasury which supports the RFV.\n\nFund Allocation and Personal Opinion:\n\nThe project is fairly new and the liquidity is locked for 10 years. The prices have been extremely stable throughout last few weeks’ huge dumps. Together, the RFV formula and the tokenomics are positively keeping the price floor relatively stable for this young project. I was also skeptical of the insanely high APY, but it seems the project is doing great. I could withdraw my initial investment within 37 days. That’s the cycle the portfolio doubles in size as mentioned in their AMAs and I saw it happen personally several times already as a small investor in the beginning (when the project was 4-day old). All big and small sales are quickly eaten up in a few hours to a couple of days, depending on the sell volumes. Anyone is welcome to check their price history (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/titano) to have a better understanding about the project’s strengths in market volatility. However, the project’s strength is more on its high APY rather than on the prices.\n\nI propose the following amounts for a new Titano position from DCIP so that we can have great returns. We might vote to liquidate our position earlier with community members’ consent to reinvest our initial investment in 3-month intervals so that DCIP holders can start to see their share of rewards for holding $Titano.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** Algorand\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** Algorand + ALGO\n- **Token Type:** COIN\n- **Stage:** Launched\n- **Team doxxed:** Yes\n- **Audit:** Yes\n\n\n### Functional details\n\nAlgorand is a self-sustaining, decentralized, blockchain-based network that supports a wide range of applications. These systems are secure, scalable and efficient, all critical properties for effective applications in the real world. Algorand will support computations that require reliable performance guarantees to create new forms of trust.\n\nThe Algorand mainnet became live in June 2019, and was able to handle almost 1 million transactions per day as of December 2020. Algorand transaction metrics can be viewed here. Algorand initial coin offering (ICO) was held in June 2019, with the Algorand price of $2.4 per token.\n\nWho Are the Founders of Algorand?\n\nSilvio Micali is a professor of computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the founder of Algorand. He is a recipient of the Turing Award (in 2012) for his fundamental contributions to the theory and practice of secure two-party computation, electronic cash, cryptocurrencies and blockchain protocols. This makes him one of the foremost creators of crypto in the world.\n\nWhat Makes Algorand Unique?\n\nAlgorand was invented to speed up transactions and improve efficiency, in response to the slow transaction times of Bitcoin and other blockchains. Algorand is designed so that there are lower transaction fees, as well as no mining (like Bitcoin's energy-intensive process), as it is based on a permissionless pure proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain protocol.\n\nAlgorand’s Compatibility with Ethereum\n\nOn Feb. 17, 2022, the Algorand Foundation announced a $10M grant to Applied Blockchain to develop the London Bridge, a trustless bridge that will bring Ethereum compatibility to the Algorand blockchain. Algorand has struggled to attract liquidity to its ecosystem, despite promising low cost transactions, low latency and high scalability. Having a bridge to Ethereum, which currently has the most robust DApp ecosystem, would allow Algorand to connect to these applications and attract more liquidity. In the long-term, the Algorand Foundation aims to have verification of other chains be performed on Alogrand’s smart contracts, by incorporating state proofs in the form of Compact Certificates into the Algorand Consensus. The foundation’s goal is to eventually solidify the DeFi ecosystem on Algorand.\n\nAlgorand is putting up $20 million in funding to accelerate development in its ecosystem, according to Algorand Foundation CEO at the ETHDenver conference.\n\nFoundation officials said $10 million in grants would go to developers that can provide solutions for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, a key cog for emerging networks looking to woo established projects. For Algorand, EVM compatibility means applications that are built on Ethereum or other Ethereum-compatible chains can also execute on Algorand.\n",

Many of the proposed investments depend on the proposals being executed at the time of passing. With waiting on liquidity in investment wallet to become available it delays proposals. This should not be too large of an issue as the projects grows but needs modifying now. \n\nProposal for all current passed proposals outstanding as of the time of this proposal to be executed first. Then as of the date of this proposal being passed (if passed) the option to propose will only be available if investment liquidity is at $50k+. Once that is triggered proposal offerings will become available again. A cap per proposal shall be set at a max of 25% of the existing $50k liquidity and once proposals are submitted that in aggregate meet the $50k, this will halt additional propspals allowed to be offered regardless if the current active propsals are passed or not. The cycle repeats from there once active propspals pass or fail community vote. This allows real time investments to be executed. ",

      "content": "Proposal for: AR - Arweave\n\nArweave is a network that connects spare disk space for users needing permanent data storage solutions\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name: Arweave - AR\n- **Token Address: 0x4fadc7a98f2dc96510e42dd1a74141eeae0c1543\n- **Token Type: ERC20 Token (Wrapped AR)\n- **Token Chain: Ethereum\n- **Stage: Launched\n- **Link to the whitepaper: https://www.arweave.org/whitepaper.pdf\n- **Team doxxed: Yes\n- **Proof of dox: https://icobench.com/ico/arweave/team\n- **Smart contract public: Yes\n\n\n### Functional details\n\nBlockweave - Allows validation of transactions without using the entire chain. By utilising PoA (Proof of Access), miners can validate\nwith a random block and store that hash with the new block to validate. This saves alof of computational power\n\nReplication - There is more financial incentive to replicate rare blocks as opposed to blocks that have been replicated\nmany times. This ensures that data replication and integrity of data storage is self optimising\n\nBlockshadows -  Instead of broadcasting a full block during a transaction, blockshadowing transmits a “shadow” that is reconstructed by recipient nodes. Instead of containing a list of transactions inside a block, a blockshadow only holds a list of transaction hashes. Using this essentialised variant, any node that holds the full list of transactions, wallet and hash lists can reproduce the full block. In addition to decoupling transactions from blocks, this process allows for a dynamic, low-cost network capable of up to 5000 tx/s.\n\nThere is a huge use case to replace traditional cloud storage solutions for both storage and data replication/geo redundancy.\nWhilst Google/Amazon/Microsoft offer cloud services, which require ongoing payments to cover their labour and overheads, Arweave offers\nthe ability to offer a one of payment to indviduals/corporations to purchase storage and allow the blockweave to take care of\nsecure storage and replication\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nAR has received a 1407% increase in the last year. Scalability, cost and speed are the drawcards and we should look to invest $10k for a year at a minimum to gauge how the market looks to move away from costly/centralised data storage\nproviders to more agile and scalable solutions like Arweave. There is currently over a 1 million terabytes of cloud data in centralised cloud solutions, so the use case for Arweave only increases from here.\n",

REX can be tested at: https://internet-bonds.com/start\n- **Proof of Audit:** Coming soon\n\n\n### Functional details\n\nREX is both a cryptocurrency and a high-yield Certificate of Deposit.\n\nAs a cryptocurrency, REX is designed for the storage and transmission of values. In contrast to common coins or tokens, however, REX has an integrated deposit function. By depositing REX tokens for a certain period of time - also called staking - interest is generated.\n\nCompared to a Certificate of Deposit in traditional finance, REX offers immense flexibility and a far higher rate of return than anything the bank has to offer. In addition, REX offers all the advantages of a blockchain-secured, decentralized and permissionless currency.\n\nREX is effectively a new and improved version of HEX on the BSC blockchain. \n\nYou will be able to aquire REX through auctions or purchasing directly on PCS.\n\nThe REX protocol has two boost Tokens, MREX and TREX. In short, MREX allows for higher yield of REX token on the auctions, and TREX increases the amount of shares received while staking. There are aditional benefits of the Boost tokens detailed in the whitepaper. \n\nWebsite: https://rex-token.com/\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/rextoken\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nWe have the opportunity to buy in on Day 1 of a better version of the HEX token. \n\nI have been following the REX story for about 6 months. The team is legit, and REX will be a powerful protocol. The mission of the developers to create a better more flexible version of HEX. After rigourous testing and audits, the REX team is ready to launch on February 22, 2022.  If you have any doubts, get into their telegram: https://t.me/newrextoken and ask questions. \n\nI have been researching the best play to make on the REX protocol. This proposal is to take maximum advantage of the protocol. \n\nThe steps to take are: \n\n1) Buy 5 $MREX as soon as this proposal is approved\n2) Have the allocated amount of BUSD ready for REX day 0 on February 22, 2022. \n3) On REX day 0, purchase 1 $TREX ($500 BUSD) for maximum share boost\n4) Participate on day 0 auction with the remaining allocated BUSD\n5) Once REX tokens are distributed from the Auction, Set a 365 day stake\n6) Everytime we win the BIG PAY DAY (the contract randomly returns 100% of all BUSD invested) and then reinvest 100% imediately in another 365 Day stake to create a staking ladder. \n7) In 365 days, end our first stake and sell our Rex Tokens and reap massive rewards. \n8) As additional stakes end, sell rex tokens and continue to reap massive rewards. \n\nLET'S NOT MISS THE CHANCE TO GET IN ON DAY 1 OF A PROJECT WITH THE POTENTIAL TO BE BIGGER THAN HEX! FOR just $10,000 we can make a massive bet on our future. \n    ",

      "content": "\nThere has been a lot of discussion on Reddit and TG around proposals not reaching quorum and/or the inconsistency at which this occurs.\n\nThe core principle behind DCIP is the ability to acquire investments that are chosen by democratic means. I think it is important that we review\nas a community what the best way is to achieve this basic use case. This also aligns with the fact that the current market downturn is the perfect\nopportunity for DCIP to acquire as many key investments as possible.\n\nWhether a holder cares about voting or not, it is clear that each holder wants the price of DCIP to increase. The only we will get to do that is\nif we are able to execute proposals to increase the size of the overall investment portfolio.\n\nTo test the community's appetite for change, I have highlighted some potential avenues below\n\n**Disagree)** We do nothing. Leave the quorum/voting structure as is\n**$1)** Change the execution of the proposal from needing a quorum of 25B votes received to 1:1 ratio of 1 vote per 1 address with execution occuring once majority has voted\n**$2)** Voting is compulsary on a proposal to receive profits from that particular proposal if liquidated\n**$3)** Reduce the quorum to a number that reflects on average how many votes we have received in the last 20 proposals\n\nI personally think having compulsary voting to receive profits is the way to go. You should be able to complete due dilligence to review and vote on the proposal at least\nto receive the benefits of receiving the profits. I think this can motivate enough low DCIP holders and DCIP holders on the basis that one of these\nmany proposals can yield a sizeable profit in the future and having a bit of FOMO.",

Possible close soon.\n\nLaunched in 2011 by Pixowl, The Sandbox is a blockchain-based virtual world allowing users to create, build, buy and sell digital assets in the form of a game. By combining the powers of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the Sandbox creates a decentralized platform for a thriving gaming community.\n\nAccording to the official whitepaper, the Sandbox platform’s main mission is to introduce blockchain technology in mainstream gaming successfully. The platform focuses on facilitating a creative “play-to-earn” model, which allows users to be both creators and gamers simultaneously. The Sandbox employs the powers of blockchain technology by introducing the SAND utility token, which facilitates transactions on the platform.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nWe have historically believed in The Sandbox as well as the emergence of the Metaverse as being the next $1 trillion industry for advertisers. We also have seen Facebook change its branding to Meta to embrace the social relationships that can be developed and maintained in the metaverse.\n\nThe chatter from contacts and alpha groups is that Facebook / Meta is almost done with the acquisition talks of The Sandbox. This is time sensitive as the news may drop soon. If you have available fiat, I recommend / urge the community to invest personally into this as well.\n    ",

Fantom offers absolute finality, which means that transactions can never be reverted like in networks with probabilistic finality.\n\nFantom is also leaderless. By removing leaders, security doesn’t rely on a small set of actors.\nSmart contract support - Fantom is fully compatible with Ethereum. Developers can create and deploy smart contracts as they would on Ethereum.\nConsensus-as-a-service\n\nLachesis can be used to create any kind of private and public distributed ledger, using EVM or Cosmos SDK.\n\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nRecommend a 5k investment for 18 months to allow for market recovery and potentially testing $10 price barrier. Currently, FTM resides at #25\nvia market cap and the services provided by Opera mainnet will allow for it to become far more popular as the use case in the next few years",

      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** inSure\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** [inSure + SURE\n\n- **Token Address:** 0xcb86c6a22cb56b6cf40cafedb06ba0df188a416e\n\n- **Token Type:** Token\n- **Token Chain** Ethereum\n\n- **Stage:** Launched\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** Yea\n- **Team doxxed:** Yes\n- **Smart contract public:** Yes\n- **Audit:** Yes\n\n\n\n### Functional details\n\n   inSure DeFi is a community-based crypto asset insurance ecosystem, where users can insure their crypto-portfolio by buying SURE tokens with fiat and other cryptocurrencies. inSure is designed to distribute crypto ownership risks amongst a liquidity pool, with insurance premiums determined by a Dynamic Pricing Model that leverages Chainlink. Capital required to back the risks at any point in time is based on the market pricing of SURE tokens, as well as community demand for insurance of crypto portfolios. A decentralized support system called the inSure DAO is also used to diligently process all the insurance claims, wherein voters make sure that any fraudulent claims are flagged and only valid claims are fulfilled.\n\ninSure DeFi is a Decentralized Insurance Ecosystem, trusted by thousands of community members to protect their crypto portfolios from scams, exchange closures, and drastic devaluations. inSure DeFi provides insurance solutions for the crypto space to stabilize and secure Crypto & DeFi portfolios.\n\nCompetitive Advantage of inSure\nA key factor in making a good insurance platform is the health of financial information, such as the usage of funds and whether there are sufficient premium floats to pay potential claims. Since the blockchain is a distributed ledger, each node has the same copy of the data. When the data changes, every insured person can see the synchronized and updated data, making the operation of each fund open and transparent. Therefore, there will be a dedicated module on the homepage of the website to disclose relevant information, and provide an accurate real-time financial status every quarter such as risk factors, minimum capital requirements, historical data on token prices, a summary of claims assessment, and the number of locked and traded tokens.\n\nEconomic Model - How it works\n       \ninSure’s Crypto insurance is based on:\n\nI. Dynamic Pricing Model, to find the right market price via supply and demand;\n\nII. Capital Model, to secure the capital required to back the risks at any points of time;\n\nIII. inSure DAO voting mechanism, to make sure every claim is handled in a permissionless and transparent manner.\n\nCapital Model\n                       \nInsurance is a highly leveraged industry; therefore, the primary concern of the insurance capital model is to calculate the capital required to guarantee the solvency of the risk pool to some arbitrary and high confidence level like 99.9% in the latest EIOPA’s Solvency II framework.\n\nThe Capital Model is used to calculate the minimum capital the fund needs to hold, which is used to determine:\n\nI. The capital locked in the Capital Pool\n\nII. The staking power used in the Staking stage.\n\nSurplus Pool\nThe surplus pool will accrue whenever an insurance premium is paid. 40% of the premium will be added into the surplus pool. Another 10% will be reserved till the expiration of the contract. If there is no claim, it will add into the surplus pool. The surplus pool will grow over time and will be utilized to cover insurance claims first. When the surplus pool cannot cover all the claims, the capital pool will be used to pay the rest. When the surplus pool grows large enough, the SURE holders will receive % from the staked SURE to better incentivise the increase of the inSure Staked Pool.\n\ninSure holders can stake on different DEXs and earn % from each trade in addition to the insurance that inSure plans provide.\n\nFor the first phase, we will focus on the risk against scams, devaluations and stolen funds. The more less-correlated business will be introduced to deliver higher returns to token holders at the community’s vote.\n\nGoverned by Community\nUnder normal circumstances, all operations on inSure can be completed by smart contracts. But in reality, in order to take into account the interests of users, better achieve decentralization effects, and ensure the process to be more transparent, decisions of certain events will require the community to vote. Therefore, the platform will set up an inSure DAO organization to facilitate such decisions and manage extreme situations. It should be noted that inSure DAO does not have the custody of the fund pool, nor can it release funds to any specific person. Each committee member may be replaced by voting at any time.\n\ninSure DAO will work in accordance with the two core principles of sustainability (that ensures the interests of community members by ensuring the sustainability of the overall funding pool) and growth (promoting sustainable premium increases and inSure DAO membership growth). The members of the inSure DAO organization include several people with specific expertise in insurance, co-governance, and blockchain development. Some powers that committee members have are:\n\nI. Reaching consensus to implement specific code that cannot be automatically deployed;\n\nII. Punishing bad actors within the inSure ecosystem (such as malicious claims, false claims, etc.) by burning SURE tokens.\n\nIII. The power to implement emergency suspension under special circumstances.\n\ninSure DAO members can negotiate and propose relevant proposals to the benefit of the inSure ecosystem. The voting proposals must include clear voting options and inSure DAO's recommendations. Then each community member is given a period of time to vote, and the result with a majority decision will be implemented. Any inSure holder can become a member of inSure DAO.\n\nFuture Integration for Automated Claim Processing of Stolen Funds and Scam Events using Google Cloud Platform (AutoML & Cloud Inference)\nIn addition to using Chainlink’s Historical Price Data, inSure DeFI is working on a hybrid on-chain/off-chain application combining Chainlink and Google Cloud AI. This allows inSure to process on-chain data related to insurable events (i.e.; stolen funds and scams) using Google AutoML, and then relay its outputs on-chain using Chainlink.\n\nChainlink’s ability to connect with any external API allows GET calls to retrieve the data/results from processing and deliver them directly to smart contracts. inSure DeFi will use this unique Chainlink feature to leverage Google Cloud Platform’s ML services (such as AutoML and Cloud Inference API) for processing publicly available information and data on the blockchain while feeding those decisions to the smart-contract via Chainlink oracles to trigger an automated fulfillment of insurance claims.\n\nAfter reviewing various oracle solutions, we elected to use Chainlink because of its time-tested security and flexibility to call any off-chain API. As the most widely-used oracle solution in the blockchain industry, Chainlink already secures over $10 billion dollars in on-chain value across DeFi, including leading projects like Aave, Synthetix, and more. Its network is backed by a large collection of secure node operators run by leading blockchain DevOps, which are aggregated into decentralized oracle networks to provide highly available, accurate, and tamperproof data feeds. Additionally, the historical price data being used by inSure consists of volume-adjusted global prices, aggregated from across all relevant CEXs and DEXs to ensure a high level of accuracy.\n\nBy combining its high-quality data and ability to connect to Big Data warehouses off-chain, inSure can build more robust and refined insurance products that cover various crypto portfolio risks.",

      "title": "IOTA - Non-Blockchain Distributed Ledger ",
      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** IOTA\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** IOTA + MIOTA\n\n- **Token Address:** 0xd944f1d1e9d5f9bb90b62f9d45e447d989580782\n\n- **Token Type:** Token\n\n- **Token Chain** [Binance Smart Chain\n\n- **Stage:** Launched\n\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** Yes\n- **Team doxxed:** Yes\n\n- **Smart contract public:** Yes\n- **Audit:** Yes \n\n### Functional details\n\nIOTA is a distributed ledger with one big difference: it isn’t actually a blockchain. Instead, its proprietary technology is known as Tangle, a system of nodes that confirm transactions. The foundation behind this platform says this offers far greater speeds than conventional blockchains — and an ideal footprint for the ever-expanding Internet of Things ecosystem.\n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of IOTA.\n\nBecause there’s no blockchain, there are no miners, and because there are no miners, there are no fees. Many established networks see costs balloon when congestion intensifies, but IOTA aims to provide limitless throughput at minimal expense.\n\nIn time, IOTA’s goal is to become the de facto platform for executing transactions between IoT devices. Given how estimates suggest there could be 20.4 billion such devices out there by 2024, this could end up being big business.\n\nThe team behind IOTA believe that the potential use cases don’t end here. They believe their distributed ledger could deliver digital identities to all, result in car insurance policies that are based on actual usage, pave the way for cutting-edge smart cities, deliver seamless global trade and prove the authenticity of products.\n\nOriginally known as Jinn, a crowdsale for the project was held in September 2014, and the network officially launched in 2016.\n\nWho Are the Founders of IOTA?\n\nIOTA has four co-founders, and their names are Sergey Ivancheglo, Serguei Popov, David Sønstebø and Dominik Schiener.\n\nAccording to the IOTA Foundation, the initiative has rapidly grown since then — and team members are now based across more than 25 countries.\n\nSonstebo and Schiener are collectively co-chairmen of the board of directors, while Popov is a board member and the foundation’s director of research.\n\nIvancheglo resigned from the Berlin-based project back in June 2019 but continues as an unofficial advisor. At the time, he said in a statement: “I no longer believe that the IOTA Foundation is the best setting for me to realize what we set out to create back in 2014 and 2015. I have always done my best work in a less rigid environment. I am looking forward to continuing the work on both hardware and software development of IOTA independently.”\n\nWhat Makes IOTA Unique?\n\nWell, as we alluded to a little earlier, the fact that it’s effectively a blockchainless blockchain is rather unusual to say the least.\n\nTangle’s more technical name is the Directed Acyclic Graph — and as Sønstebø explained in a blog post back in 2015, this technology aims to retain blockchain’s ability to execute secure transactions. The only difference is that it does away with the notion of blocks.\n\nHe also wrote: “IOTA should not be considered an alternative coin (altcoin) to existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, rather it is an extension of the growing blockchain ecosystem. It’s meant to work in synergy with these other platforms to form cohesion and symbiotic relationships. IOTA is designed to provide one solution that no other crypto does: efficient, secure, lightweight, real-time micro-transactions without fees.”\n\nNew transactions are validated by approving two previous transactions from another node — and this is a novel approach because it means that the network’s size and speed will be directly related to how many people are using the platform.\n\nAnd whereas some cryptocurrencies are run as a business, the IOTA Foundation says it is firmly not for profit — adding that it has the sole goal of making the network as prosperous as possible.\n\nFinally, IOTA has distinguished itself from many other crypto rivals by establishing high-profile partnerships with the carmaker Volkswagen, and helping the city of Taipei to pursue smart projects.",

      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** Enjin Coin \n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** Enjin + ENJ\n\n- **Token Address:** 0xf629cbd94d3791c9250152bd8dfbdf380e2a3b9c\n\n- **Token Type:** Token\n- **Token Chain**  Ethereum\n- **Stage:** Launched\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** Yes\n- **Team doxxed:** Yes\n- **Smart contract public:** Yes\n- **Audit:** Yes\n\n### Functional details\n\n   Enjin Coin is a project of Enjin, a company that provides an ecosystem of interconnected, blockchain-based gaming products. Enjin's flagship offering is the Enjin Network, a social gaming platform through which users can create websites and clans, chat, and host virtual item stores.\n\nEnjin allows game developers to tokenize in-game items on the Ethereum blockchain. It uses Enjin Coin, an ERC-20 token, to back the digital assets issued using its platform, meaning that items can be bought, sold and traded with real-world value.\n\nEnjin Coin was first announced in July 2017, and it launched on the Ethereum mainnet in June 2018.\n\nEnjin Coin (ENJ) is a digital store of value used to back the value of blockchain assets like non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Every asset minted with the Enjin Platform contains ENJ, a minting resource which is locked inside NFTs and removed from circulation. Minting blockchain assets with ENJ provides a variety of benefits to creators and users:\n\n• Infuses them with a reserve value\n• Ensures their transparency and scarcity\n• Gives them instance liquidity\n• Provides utility in games and apps\n• Anti-inflationary\n• Enjin's \"melting\" functionality allows users to destroy their blockchain assets at any time to retrieve the ENJ value from within.\nThe Enjin blockchain ecosystem aims to offer software products that make it easy for everyone to develop, trade, monetize, and market with blockchain.\n\nFounded in 2009, Enjin has roots in the gaming industry, with the company’s first product, a gaming community platform called the Enjin Network, growing to 20 million users over the course of a decade.\n\nIn 2017 following an ICO, Enjin established itself as a leading blockchain ecosystem developer, building a suite of software products that enable anyone to easily mint, manage, trade, distribute, and integrate blockchain assets.\n\nEnjin’s co-founder Witek Radomski wrote the code for one of the first ever non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and is also the co-author of the ERC-1155 Ethereum token standard.\n\nBuilt on top of an on-chain infrastructure, the Enjin ecosystem enables game developers and businesses of all sizes to use tokenized digital assets as part of their acquisition, retention, engagement, and monetization strategies. The Enjin ecosystem is fueled by Enjin Coin (ENJ), a cryptocurrency used to back the value of blockchain assets.\n\nWho Are the Founders of Enjin Coin?\nEnjin was founded as a gaming community platform in 2009 by Maxim Blagov and Witek Radomski, with Blagov becoming CEO and assuming responsibility for the creative direction of the company and Radomski serving as chief technical officer, responsible for the technical development of its products. Blagov has described himself as having experience in creative direction, marketing, and software project management and design.\n\nThe idea of introducing blockchain to Enjin was first proposed by Radomski after he became interested in Bitcoin (BTC) in 2012, eventually convincing the company to accept it as a payment option. After learning about Ethereum and smart contracts, he decided he wanted to create his own blockchain-integrated software. Radomski is also the author of the ERC-1155 token standard, a new standard for Ethereum-issued tokens that was introduced in June 2018, finalized in June 2019, and is used for minting both fungible and nonfungible tokens.\n\nWhat Makes Enjin Coin Unique?\nAccording to co-founder Radomski, Enjin Coin is unique in that every token minted with Enjin Platform, the company's blockchain asset development platform that launched in February 2020, is directly backed by ENJ, giving in-game items real-world liquidity. Similarly, Blagov has stated that the company is focused on adoption, saying he imagines a future in which millions of gamers use digital items backed by Enjin Coin without even knowing it exists.\n\nEnjin Coin uses a series of smart contracts to which game developers send ENJ to mint new, unique fungible or nonfungible ERC-1155 tokens. These tokens can be traded on the Enjin Marketplace, which launched in September 2019, or exchanged for their backing ENJ at any time. As more custom tokens are minted, more ENJ is removed from the ecosystem, thus making it scarcer.\n\nAccording to its whitepaper, Enjin Coin uses a series of both on-chain and off-chain processes. When a transaction is completed within the Enjin ecosystem, a Trusted Platform contacts the users' smart wallets, and the website or game is updated immediately with a placeholder or nontradable version of the digital item until the transaction has been validated by the Ethereum blockchain.\n",

Fantom offers absolute finality, which means that transactions can never be reverted like in networks with probabilistic finality.\n\nFantom is also leaderless. By removing leaders, security doesn’t rely on a small set of actors.\nSmart contract support - Fantom is fully compatible with Ethereum. Developers can create and deploy smart contracts as they would on Ethereum.\nConsensus-as-a-service\n\nLachesis can be used to create any kind of private and public distributed ledger, using EVM or Cosmos SDK.\n\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nRecommend a 7k investment for 18 months to allow for market recovery and potentially testing $10 price barrier. Currently, FTM resides at #25\nvia market cap and the services provided by Opera mainnet will allow for it to become far more popular as the use case in the next few years.",

      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** Crosswise Finance - Delay\n\nHello everyone! \n\nA couple of days ago the community accepted the proposal for Crosswise Finance (and had a voting quorum of a whopping 208%, nice!). \nI think this was a good decision and really think this project has a lot of potential.\n\nHowever, something came up. \nThe team discovered a faulty code within the contract address and to ensure the safety of the project, they decided to re-evaluate and redeploy the contract.\nThis might take a couple of weeks since they want to employ it with max security.\n\nThis has some advantages and some disadvantages:\n\nNegative: \n- Since they were already deployed, it might have spooked some investors who have to wait now.\n- The 'big hype' at launch might have been lost.\n- A fraction of the funding got lost in the progress, however, investors did not lose anything. It was only the dev & funding wallet where the problem occurred. \n\nPositive:\n- The delay might be good since the market is not in a good place atm.\n- New devs have been hired to counter such future problems (3 new and more experienced devs).\n- Before the new launch, they will wait till they have the complete CertiK audit and PeckShield check to ensure maximum safety.\n- We can invest from the very beginning of the launch and swoop in at a nice price. \n- While they make the new contract, they are updating their Dapp with new implementations and features that will attract more buyers.\n\n\nI discussed this with Mike, and we thought it would be the fairest thing to do to ask the community how we move on with a new proposal (since we are a decentralized community).\nIt seems like a good learning opportunity on what to do in unexpected situations! \n\nAs I see it, it is still a sweet opportunity and nothing about the project has changed. It's only a delay. \nNevertheless, the community decides and I will 100% stand behind whatever we choose. \n\nSo I propose the next options:\n\n- Disagree = we pull out from the investment.\n- Fund allocation $1 = we wait till the project launches and invest what we were originally going to invest.\n- Fund allocation $2 = we wait a week after launch to ensure nothing is wrong and we invest what we were originally going to invest.\n- Fund allocation $3 = ignore this one, I had to put in a 3rd option!\n\nThere will be an AMA on the 26th of January in their telegram for those that want to make sure that it is a safe project.\nhttps://t.me/crosswise (link to the telegram)\n\nThank you for understanding, and as always:\nDYOR & and keep voting on proposals!\n\nPS: I just read that we can now comment on the proposals! So feel free to leave a comment if you have questions. \n\n",

ETH works as a platform for numerous other cryptocurrencies, as well as for the execution of decentralized smart contracts and NFTs. \n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nI believe this is the right investment at the right time. currently the price is very low, an ideal time to strike in view of what is yet to come. With ETH 2.0 coming up and the hard growth of NFTs I believe this is the right investment. Besides, the risk we take is very small, Ethereum has been proving for years that it is more than just an alt coin.\n\n**Ehtereum 2.0**\nI believe this will be a game changer. realize that even under these conditions, where gas fees are incredibly high there are still millions of dollars of transactions taking place every day. ETH 2.0 will lower the gas fees significantly, the energy consumption will decrease which will lower the costs and increase the efficiency.\n\n**NFTs**\nCurrently NFTs are very popular, numerous celebrities including Neymar Jr(55.7m followers) and Eminem(22.5f followers) who bought Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). i believe this is just the beginning of the NFT space. All these transactions are taking place on the Ethereum network.",

Qredo, a Layer-2 protocol based on Tendermint, also features a Layer-3 decentralized communications platform (based on Matrix, a decentralized messaging protocol).  One of the salient underlying features of Qredo is the use of Consensus-Driven Multi-Party Computation (CD-MPC) to provide asset security. Qredo’s blockchain is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chain. The project aims to decentralize the governance of its network progressively._\nQredo Network aims to offer the following key features:\n\n\n- Institutional-grade security and controls.\n- Cross-platform credit and liquidity.\n- Cross-chain atomic swaps and settlements.\n- Progressively decentralized governance and compliance.\n- Interoperability in an open-source way.\n\n\nThe COO of QREDO was an ex-director at binance. Since the coin isn't yet listed on Binance, I think this will happen in the next coming months.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nThis token has a real usecase and is a typical long term investment. QREDO has a current marketcap of 150 million dollars. Other comparable projects like OSMOSIS are almost at 3 billion marketcap. Since the COO of QREDO has good connections with the board of Binance, I think this coin will be listed on Binance. Together with its strong usecase, this coin will definitely going up the coming months. \n    ",

Trying to bridge these kinds of exchanges (and by this, solving problems like fragmentation, synchronization,...), Crosswise is aiming to be a driving force and pioneer in the DeFi-landscape. \n\nWith their easy-to-use app, users will enjoy the benefits of both worlds with cross-chain transactions (with no gasless swaps thanks to Biconomy's API) in a very secure environment. \n\nFurthermore, their app will contain a wallet summary, portfolio tracker, staking options,... and many more.\n\nDYOR: https://www.crosswise.finance/\n\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nSince this is a relatively new project, there are a lot of opportunities for us without using extreme amounts of our budget.\nMost of the boxes check out: We have doxxed devs, locked liquidity, Techrate audit (and Certik audit in the upcoming week)...\n\nThe project is promising and has already realized a lot. Very active telegram and a good team behind it.\nMarketing will soon start, with next week confirmed AMA's with good partners (Travladd Community, SatoshiClub,...) and ApeBoard & BscScan ads. \nCMC & CG applied for, and will definitely be listed soon.\nMarketcap: 1.5m and rising relatively quickly. \n\nI would suggest that we stake our tokens (which is already possible) for max return on investment. \n\n\nFun fact: the pre-sale had 2 rounds which brought in a stunning total of 1.45M BUSD (!). The target was however 1.85M BUSD, and the rest was bought up by the team itself and added to the liquidity. \n\n\nI think this is a golden opportunity before the project takes off and gets more attention (which imo, it will definitely get).\nAs always make sure to do your own research, and don't forget to vote!\n\n\n    ",

AXS stands for Axie Infinity Shard. It is an ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum Blockchain, and has a maximum supply of 270,000,000 AXS coins. Axie Infinity, the most popular crypto-based game and blockchain-using metaverse project, hit $3 billion equity valuation and $30 billion fully diluted valuation.Apart from its sheer entertainment value, Axie Infinity allows users to earn money in several ways, like selling SLP (smooth love potions), breeding rare Axies, and AXS staking.  STAKING - currently gives 89% of annual return - PASIVE INCOME. Thanks to maximum supply of 270,000,000 AXS and excelent community and AXS project team price of the token can go up in the nearest future.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nAxie Infinity is one of a number of metaverse-related cryptocurrencies making waves lately. Following a strong surge into early November, Axie Infinity peaked at a year-to-date gain of more than 30,000%. In other words, for token holders who bought in on Jan. 1 and held for approximately 10 months, that's a 300-bagger. \n\nThis sort of price performance is enough to entice many investors to look at this token. However, there are a number of other reasons investors may want to consider this play-to-earn game. (Play to earn refers to the ability to earn monetary rewards simply by playing an online game.\n\nI am pushing for at least a $10,000 investment staked. The exit would be 1000$ - 1500$ per share. The profit is actually an underestimate as the staking increases the amount of AXS you have as it's staked (89% APY).\n    \n",

      "title": "Proposal for Aleph.im",
      "content": "\n\n\n\nA cross chain decentralised network allowing for cloud storage and computing.\n\n\nTechnical details\n\n- **Token Name: Aleph.im (ALEPH)\n- **Token Address: 0x82d2f8e02afb160dd5a480a617692e62de9038c4\n- **Token Type: Token\n- **Token Chain: Ethereum\n- **Stage:Launched\n- **Link to the whitepaper:https://github.com/moshemalawach/aleph-whitepaper/raw/master/aleph-whitepaper.pdf\n- **Team doxxed: Yes\n- **Proof of dox: https://aleph.im/#/team\n- **Smart contract public: Yes\n- **Audit:Unsure\n- **Proof of Audit: Unsure\n- **LP Lock: Unsure\n- **LP Lock proof: Unsure\n\nFunctional details\n\nAleph.im allows dApps and protocols to migrate centralised parts of their stack from the centralised to a decentralised framework. Whilst the likes of Filecoin aims to create larger traditional files videos, PDFs etc, Aleph.im is focused more on the DeFi ecosystem. Akash Network is propvides cloud services, but is limited to the\nCosmos ecosystem, Aleph.im has the multi chain integration sitting as an Layer 2 solution. ALEPH tokens serve as the payment source.\n\nCurrent partnerships:\n\nStarname: The partnership allows Starname to use Aleph.im’s decentralised database feature to store user profile metadata;\n\nExeedme: The partnership allows Exeedme to use Aleph.im’s decentralised database and file storage features to decentralise its NFTs;\n\nDecentr: The partnership allows Decentr to use Aleph.im’s decentralised database and file storage features to store posts, images and links preventing bloating on Decentr’s blockchain;\n\nOrion Protocol: The partnership will optimise Orion Protocol’s off-chain centralised order books to be completely trustless and decentralised. Orion Protocol will also use aleph.im’s decentralised database and file storage features; and\n\nSynaps: The partnership allows Synaps to use Aleph.im’s decentralised identity solution to support Synaps in providing self-sovereign identities with their partners.\n\n2022 Roadmap:\n\nQ1\n\nSolana Lending Protocol Indexers - (In progress)\nMetamask Encryption Integration - (In progress)\nLoad balancers on aleph.cloud - (In progress)\nSolana Aggregator Indexer - (In progress)\nIndexer Framework Release - (In progress)\nTezos integration - (In progress)\nMonitoring Aleph VM Executors\n(CPU used, duration, ...)\nStorage Resource Nodes\nGo-Live Decentralized Identity (DID) system\nSecret Management in Virtual Machines\nIncentive for the Resource Nodes (Hold Aleph)\n\nQ2\n\nService Payments (Pay-as-you-go)\nDecentralised Load Balancer\nChannel Sharding\n\nQ3-Q4\nLaunch VM's with a Transaction (SOL, ETH)\nReproducible Virtual Machines\nShared Volumes between VMs\nIPFS on VM executors\n\n\n\nFund allocation and personal opinion\n\nWith a market cap of $84M USD market cap and upcoming roadmap, I believe Aleph.im is a good investment as DeFi products expand and the desire\nto find decentralised computing solutions increase. It has created a niche in this space, by providing a fully decentralised framework and allowing\nmulti chain integration, allowing flexibility for developers and investors alike. I feel this would be a medium term play and should be given at least\n2 to 3 years to mature into a solid investment. I believe an investment between of $7.5k would provide a good entry point in to this product with room\nfor future expansion in our holding as the demand for Aleph.im grows.\n",

Initially using IPFS to save articles to the block chain to end censorship, but as an agnostic assistant if something emerges better than ipfs it will move to the better technology. The first product which is the DARA extension for browsers, an article saving plug in is in public beta testing, with things like the American declaration of independence and the St. James bible already saved to the blockchain permanently stopping big tech censorship. Bruce from NKN coin is an advisor and angel investor in the project. Sunny king(creator of proof of stake) and his company V-Systems is working with $dara to make the first on chain dictionary called FELIX, which will allow you to mint NFTs of words you can find in the dictionary while saving the definition permanently. A partnership with CHECKFIRST HQ will work with the dara team to build dara SNAP, which will \"build a traceable, searchable and immutable solution for fact checkers worldwide.\" All of these products will fall under the Immutable DAO, of which $dara will be the governance token. Eventually holders will receive Dara dividends when the paid features of the DAO start rolling out. Dara aims to end censorship so that our voices are never stifled.\n\n### Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nI say we invest while the price is low(currently around 4.3c a token) because the price will rise with the release of the Dara extension in January and the Felix On-chain Dictionary on February 1st 2022. I'd say this is a medium to long term hold, this has the ability to be at least a multi-million dollar market cap(currently is around a $1m market cap). An investment of even $1-2k USD could easily 100x if we invest in this token and hold.\n\nIf this passes purchase with incredibly low slippage .01-.05%, there is not tax on this token but there are front runner bots who try to profit off of all buys.",

      "title": "$SPELL Token - Leverage Cross-Chain.",
      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** [$SPELL - Spell Token - ERC20 - STAKE IT]\n\nSpell Token (SPELL) is a reward token associated with abracadabra.money, a lending platform that uses interest-bearing tokens (ibTKNs) as collateral to borrow a USD-pegged stablecoin called Magic Internet Money (MIM).\n\nINVEST & STAKE Spell.\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** [Spell Token + $SPELL]\n- **Token Address:** [0x090185f2135308bad17527004364ebcc2d37e5f6]\n- **Token Type:** [Token]\n- **Token Chain** [Ethereum]\n- **Stage:** [Launched]\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** [https://docs.abracadabra.money/]\n- **Team doxxed:** [Partially - OxMerlin and Daniele Sesta]\n- **Proof of dox:** [https://twitter.com/danielesesta?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor]\n- **Smart contract public:** [Yes - https://docs.abracadabra.money/our-ecosystem/our-contracts]\n- **Audit:** [Yes]\n- **Proof of Audit:** [No]\n- **LP Lock:** [No]\n\n### Functional details\n\nThe main function of the SPELL token is to stake it in Abracadabra to obtain sSPELL tokens, which have several benefits.\n\n- First, they grant holders voting rights to change the platform parameters, such as TVL, Liquidation Fees, future collateral options, etc.\n- Second, they grant holders a claim on fees generated by the protocol.\n\nThe protocol fees, at launch, derive solely from interest on borrowed MIM. As debt is paid in MIM, fees are collected. They are distributed as follows:\n\n- 75% are used to purchase SPELL tokens that go to sSPELL token holders.\n- 20% is allocated to the governance treasury that will be used to incentive MIM liquidity pools.\n- 5% is redirected to a multisig treasury that will be used when market conditions require intervention.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nSPELL token is disrupting how lending and leverage is done across multiple chains. MIM is seeing wild adoption and with the SPELL teams latest initiative to completely take over SushiSwap - we can see Spell hit 20 or 30 cents this year. There was also a massive burn that happened on January 3rd: 5.25 billions $SPELL have just been burned, bringing the new total supply to 196B!\n\nDefi is in its infancy still. Investing early in infrastructure to bridge the various chains and offering leverage is only going to grow as more people realize just how easy it is to leverage, re-invest, and stake assets that will grow in value.\n\nThe total value locked in SPELL is now up to a whopping $6.439 BILLION dollars. This is up by 100% since 4 months ago. The team is extremely active on Discord and Twitter. The thing that drew me into this investment initially at 0.0035 was a defi megawhale worth $800 million in Ethereum alone. However, as I did my own research I realized the value of cross-chain leverage, yield farming, and more importantly a team that absolutely SHIPS on integrations and what they preach. It is also part meme too.. for better or worse. FROGNATION has a cult following on top of a soon-to-be profitable venture in leverage with MIM being the defacto stable coin. \n\nI am pushing for at least a $10,000 investment staked.  The exit would be 10 ($36k profit) - 15 ($61k profit) cents per share. The profit is actually an underestimate as the staking increases the amount of SPELL you have as it's staked (26% APY). ",

Allowing merchant to accept any cryptocurrency or FIAT in exchange of their product/services. The payment gateway will function like Paypal and will give the option of purchasing crypto on it. Retailers are going to be able to use crypto as a payment method (encrypted online shopping). All the fees collected from the transactions are going to be sent into the liquidity pool (increasing FCF base price) and the dividend pool (Rewarding holders with BNB)\n\nCurrent roadmap:\n\nhttps://frenchconnection.finance/roadmap/\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nFrench Connection Finance (FCF) is a new kind of DeFi token which runs on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network. What is unique about FCF and why I think it is worth sharing, is that it is a dividend generating token with a real world use case.\n\nFCF has a unique and revolutionary use case. That is, FCF is developing a cryptocurrency payment gateway called FCF Pay (think PayPal of crypto). This will allow someone to make a purchase with their cryptocurrency without having to first convert that into fiat, and it will give the merchant the choice of receiving payment in crypto or fiat.\n\nFCF will incentivize adoption of this payment gateway by offering a fee structure that is lower than both existing credit card purchase providers and other money transfer companies (such as PayPal).\nFurthermore, a portion of the fees generated through the payment gateway will be distributed among holders — thereby dramatically increasing the dividends that holders will receive. This also acts as a safeguard against bear markets and low-volume trading days because dividend distribution is no longer confined strictly to trading volume and market sentiment.\n\nFCF Pay has already integrated with WooCommerce and it is in the process of being integrated with Shopify. Beta testing is being conducted in January of 2022, and there will be a live launch shortly thereafter.\n\nThe community is very active and holders are increasing every day. The team is very transparent and have done a great job of letting people know their plans for marketing and shilling.\n\nI propose we allocate $20,000 to the project. \n\n    ",

VRA Rewards - Product Layer\n2. Proprietary Video Player - Product Layer\n3. Proprietary Adstack - Product Layer\n4. Proof of View (Patent Allowed 16/023,354) - Protocol Layer\n\nPoV is the only Protocol Layer patented technology for the blockchain\nVeraWallet - Product Layer Payment System\nVerasity revenue streams include:\nSubscriptions, Commissions on prize pools, and Video Ad revenues and transaction fees on Verasity products\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\n$27,000 to take our investment up to a total of about $30,000 current value.\n\nVRA has 10 to 50x potential in the medium term, Check out this video, https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RFl6BiKheCg&feature=youtu.be\n\nESports is a multi billion dollar industry and VRA is well placed. 100x would take the mc to about 4B which is entirely feasible.\n\nThe price of this token has dropped mainly because of a token unlock not because of fundamentals so let’s take advantage and DCA while the price is ripe for picking as once the token unlock does not affect the price then the price will increase dramatically.\n\nMoreover, they have achieved everything in their roadmap (https://verasity.io/#roadmap) and the new roadmap is about to be released any day now which is another reason to get in ASAP.\n\nThis is a medium term strategy of 3 to 5 years.\n\nThanks for taking the time to review this proposal. \n    ",

As an incentive for people to deploy Helium access points, users are rewarded in HNT. HNT is then burnt to create the data credits for people to use the network. \n\nHNT is rewarded to both access points (miners) for proof of coverage and validators.\n\nThe token will continue to gain in value as utilization of the network grows over the next three years. The project already has major partnerships with Dish Network, Lime Bike, and multiple tracking companies. \n\nThe demand for the hotspots is incredible demonstrating high visibility to the project with devices sold out till March currently. In addition for each hotspot added to the network $55.00 USD of helium has to be burnt.  \n\nhttps://www.helium.com/\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nI propose we take a position in the coin and immediately stake it with https://www.helium-staking.com/ to earn 7% APR, plus any coin appreciation. \n\nHNT is off its all time high of $54.88 with continued demand and a clear utilization that will drive demand.\n\nThe HNT token provides very positive upside, along with a very positive 7% return while holding the token. \n\nThe last fund allocation option $380,000 would allow us to purchase enough HNT to stake for our own DCIP validator (10000 HNT Required)\n\nThis token has significant upside, while breaking into the wireless telecommunication market. The US market size (wireless revenue) alone is approximately 310 billion dollars. \n    ",

It provides a disruption in traditional borrowing/lending, and one of the leaders in the DeFi protocol space. \n\n### Technical details\n\nToken: Compound\nSymbol: COMP\nAddress: 0xc00e94cb662c3520282e6f5717214004a7f26888\nEthereum Chain\nLaunched\nhttps://compound.finance/\nhttps://compound.finance/documents/Compound.Whitepaper.pdf\nSecurity and Audits: https://compound.finance/docs/security\n\n\n**Functional details\n\nThe Compound Protocol is an Ethereum smart contract for supplying or borrowing assets. Through the cToken contracts, accounts on the blockchain supply capital (Ether or ERC-20 tokens) to receive cTokens or borrow assets from the protocol (holding other assets as collateral). The Compound cToken contracts track these balances and algorithmically set interest rates for borrowers.\n\nCompound allows any crypto investor to borrow or lend their cryptocurrency on its network. Via locking in one's tokens and effectively allowing Compound to be able to lend these tokens out to those looking to borrow them, investors can earn meaningful passive income on their existing holdings.\n\nFor those looking to borrow tokens, Compound's platform allows for a seamless end-to-end process for borrowers. No meetings with a banker, stacks of paperwork, or litany of credit checks, verifications, and tedious processes. If investors have the crypto to put up as collateral, the loan will be approved.\n\nCrypto investors clearly see a tremendous amount of value in locking their tokens into the Compound ecosystem. Currently, Compound ranks fifth among all DeFi lending platforms in total value locked. This measure looks at how much digital capital is locked into a given network at a point in time.\n\nCompound has a strong network that creates a lot of use possibilities in lending and also providing passive income. It may be a little longer hold than many in the crypto world expect, but I see it having very strong growth. It is currently down from its ATH by a little over 75%, I see this as a good entry point with crypto markets slowly starting to regain momentum . ",

It is the foil to the dogebonk token which has a market cap of around 50 million at the moment.  Even if it is able to move toward a 50 Million market cap that is a 1000% increase in profit which seems reasonable with its growth rate.  I propose selling at the 1 Billion market cap which would have gains of $10,000,000 on the $50,000 investment level.  If funds are not available for the Maximum option the lower tiered option is acceptable at $30,000.\n    ",

But the funds in this wallet don't just sit there.The funds are bridged to other EVM-compatible blockchains - like Avalanche, Fantom, Solanar, and Polygon.\n\nBuybacks typically happen about once a day. To prevent front-running, they are not announced ahead of time.\nPrevious buybacks can be viewed on the \"Buyback History\" panel in the dashboard.\nDuring a buyback, $MVC tokens are bought back, paired with $BNB, and \"burnt\" to the $MVC/$BNB PancakeSwap V2 liquidity pool. This not only increases the token price, but it also increases the pair's liquidity.\n\n**There are two major accomplishments here:**\nFirst of all, you no longer need to always keep up with the latest and greatest farm across all these different blockchains. You can just buy the tokens, relax, hold, and reap the earnings via 10% tax every transaction and  buybacks from farming rewards.\n\nWhen the price falls after a sell, 5% of the sale will be invested in aggressive yield farms that will be used for a future and powerful compounded buyback.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nThe hyper deflationary burning mechanisms is going to help reduce the supply which in turn will increase the price. Given the current bearish nature of BNB / BTC / ETH at the moment - this is an investable opportunity that has much upside to be seen as a DeFi 3.0 play.    ",

Currently satozhi is in its last state of the 2021 roadmap which promises to bring satozhi into the ethereum and tron blockchain.\nSatoz has created its decent ecosystem:\n    -VMT Marketplace (Virtual mining tool,where you can mine satoz instead of burning via pool or website you can burn in your own vmt,which will also be a valuable asset in future)\n  \n-  Decentralized Pools [burning satoz online]\n  -  NFT Marketplace\n  -  SATOZ Mobile (Lite) [ you can download it at playstore]\n -   ZHI Game Studios (Gaming partnership)\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nSatozhi has a huge potencial to be top coin in the future. They are about to going to bridge into  Ethereum and Tron Chains and  it will have its own blockchain(making it a coin itself) the Max supply is 21 million, everyday 7200 satozhis are mined and distributed among people who burnt them. The more you burn, the more you will recieve. Currently about 10 million of satoz are in circulation, making it deflationary currency controlled by holders.\n    ",

      "content": "\nECOMI Collect is a cross-platform (mobile, desktop, web) application used for the delivery and\nstorage of digital collectible content. It is a marketplace where users can buy, swap, sell and store\ndigital assets in the form of digital collectible NFTs. The authenticity, scarcity and ownership of\ndigital collectibles are managed using Distributed Ledger Technology.\n\n### Functional details\n\nDue to the throughput and congestion issues that currently plague the Ethereum network, ECOMI\nCollect will be deploying the OMI token and the digital collectible NFT contracts on the GoChain\nnetwork.\n\nCurrently the GoChain network successfully performs 1,300 transactions per second and are on\ntrack to perform at 13,000 transactions per second. This vs Ethereum’s 13 transactions per second\nmake it an ideal choice for both short and long term DAPP viability. Additionally, as a fork of the\nEthereum protocol, GoChain is 100% compatible with Ethereum smart contracts, which will allow\nECOMI to leverage existing GO20 and GO721 token standard implementations. To achieve long\nterm stability and compatibility, the ECOMI NFT smart contract will be compatible with the ERC721\ntoken standard.\n\nWhen new digital collectibles are created they are done so by minting a new NFT in our blockchain\ncontract. Each NFT is provided with an associated URI which links that NFT to a set of metadata\nwhich includes the collectible name, licensor, brand, series and links to the NFT’s various digital\nassets (such as clothing, props, etc).\n\nECOMI will host the publicly accessible JSON API containing the metadata for each NFT’s URI.\n\nDigital Exchange Platform and NFT Ownership\nAfter the minting of each NFT, the ownership is sent to an address assigned to ECOMI for security\nand management on behalf of the owner. The ECOMI Collect platform operates as a hybrid model\nwhereby ECOMI maintains ownership of all collectibles within the system, as is a common practice\namong digital exchange platforms. The ECOMI Collect platform will maintain centralized\nownership records as users buy, sell and trade NFTs.\n\nAdditionally, all transactions in our system require signing authorization from either the user’s app\nor their Collect Digital Hardware Wallet. This hybrid approach allows ECOMI to provide users with\na streamlined experience within the ECOMI Collect app, while still leveraging the power of\nDistributed Ledger Technology for ECOMI digital collectibles.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\nThis is so early days, in the future they will create a metaverse, can you imagine that? a Disney and Marvel metaverse, how cool is that? \nRight now you can't buy the NFTs with the cryptovaluta, but in the future this project will be massive!\n\n\n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ecomi/ ",

Rather than coordinating networks of devices and data through centralized servers, Jasmy aims to decentralize the process via edge computing and storing data on IPFS, a decentralized storage network. JASMY can be used to transfer tokens between devices and payment for network services.\n\nJasmy - the Japanese Bitcoin\n\nJapan has one of the world's most progressive regulatory climates for digital currencies. It's one of the world's biggest markets for Bitcoin and recognizes digital currencies as legal property under the Payment Services Act (PSA).\n\nBasically, Japan takes the development of the coins very seriously. And it makes sense, since Japan is one of the most popular crypto countries in the world.\n\nCrypto in Japan falls under the category \"crypto assets\" under law. That means it can be used as a means of payment transactions and exchanged with fiat currencies (Japanese Yen, USD).\n\nAnd that brings us to one of the things going for Jasmy Coin. It's a certified Japanese cryptocurrency. You can check it off as legitimate.\n\nMore than that, though, Jasmy leadership may have what it takes to push this coin to new heights.\n\nJasmy's CEO, Kunitake Ando, is the former President and COO of Sony Corp. (NYSE: SONY). The list of high-ranking positions he's held within Sony goes on. Jasmy's President, COO, and Deputy President are former high-ranking Sony employees as well.\n\nAndo's vision of Jasmy is one for the people. He believes the Internet of Things (IoT)-powered fourth industrial revolution is the perfect opportunity to help people retake control of their personal information.   ",

Fully working dapp, almost 4,000 holders, reached ATH in October 2021 of $0.01, total payouts to holders $347,126.54 since dapp launch.  Partnerships include: BOGGED, MONI, STARSHIP, SYAxFLOOZ, BABYFLOKI AND WYVERN.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nThe platform is based on the synergy of two concepts: DEX (decentralized exchanges) and IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts).  This is the first of its kind in the cryptoverse.  In practice, dexIRA offers investors many of the benefits of an individual retirement account but with the advantage of trading in cryptocurrency.  Combining the advanced BEP-20 high-speed blockchain technologies and the traditional IRA model, the dexIRA platform allows users to collect and manage a diverse array of curated cryptocurrency tokens while also holding dexIRA.  After a one-year holding period, investors can sell their $DEX holdings tax-free and penalty-free. However, like the age restrictions on a traditional IRA, if holders choose to sell early, they’re penalized.  I feel a substantial investment in this project will bring substantial reward for all DCIP holders.  \n\nI personally feel this should be a long-term position of at least 12 months to maximize return.  At 12 months of holding dexIRA, the sell tax is waived, and we can reallocate at that time if the community so chooses.  Once 12 months of being vested into this project arrives, we can liquidate all, or a portion of our position tax free.  \n\nBecause this is a multi-currency rewards contract, rewards are dispersed to dexIRA holders.  The default reward token is BNB.  So, this will allow us to open a position in BNB without any cash out of the DCIP investment pool.  With that said, we can potentially gain our initial investment into dexIRA back through the rewarding of BNB in less than 12 months’ time, depending on the sell volume of dexIRA over the course of the next 12 months.  Once our initial investment amount is reached in the form of BNB rewards, we can liquidate the BNB rewards tax free, at any time, to get our initial investment back to be placed back into the investment pool, and what we hold of dexIRA, thereafter, then becomes house money that we are playing with.",

      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** [$RAIN]\n\nA global platform for hundreds of P2E games - connecting gamers, games, and guilds worldwide. Welcome to its currency.\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** [Rainmaker Games - $RAIN]\n- **Token Address:** [0x71fc1f555a39e0b698653ab0b475488ec3c34d57]\n- **Token Type:** [Token]\n- **Token Chain** [Available on both BSC and ETH]\n- **Stage:** [Launched]\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** [https://whitepaper.rmg.io/]\n- **Team doxxed:** [Yes]\n- **Proof of dox:** [https://rmg.io/ - scroll to the bottom of the page]\n- **Smart contract public:** [Not sure]\n- **Audit:** [Not sure]\n- **Proof of Audit:** [Not sure]\n- **LP Lock:** [Yes/No]\n- **LP Lock proof:** [Link]\n\n### Functional details\n\nThe token, $RAIN, can also be staked to yield more $RAIN tokens. The staking mechanism is for liquidity for the DEX's. Tokens are airdropped to players AND guilds which creates a nice micro-economy around currency that isn't fiat. Guilds can set rules for their players on how the airdrops are distributed.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nRainmaker Games is building the largest global player platform and in turn, the largest P2E data powerhouse. They will become a central hub and launchpad for games, plus an invaluable data source for guilds to build better data-backed teams - truly becoming a home for the world of play-to-earn games.\n\nThey are launching their beta platform in January, 2022. They are backed by some of the most well known investment companies, guilds, and gaming companies.  Animoca (SAND) as well as Alameda Research have invested millions into this project. \n\nThe team is also completely doxxed and have been in the startup world with successful companies such as Yext.\n\nMy personal opinion that P2E games, NFTs, and making money in the metaverse as a concept is here to stay. Our investments into SAND and MANA is a bet on this dystopian future where gamers can earn money by simply playing. Games HAVE no borders. Why should there be borders for the payments to the players / guilds? Now, you have a cross-country and cross-game currency that has actual utility and saves time / money for the individuals that will be at the forefront of this new P2E economy.\n    ",

      "title": "Open new XPR position on Proton",
      "content": "\nProposal for: Proton\n\nProton (XPR) is a new public blockchain and smart contract platform designed for both consumer applications and peer-peer payments. It is built around a secure identity and financial settlements layer that allows users to directly link real identity and fiat accounts, pull funds and buy crypto, and use that crypto seamlessly in apps.\n\n### Technical details\n\n-Coin Name: Proton, XPR\n-Coin Chain: Proton (Native L1 Blockchain)\n-Stage: Launched\n-Link to the whitepaper: https://www.protonchain.com/proton-white-paper-en.pdf\n-Team doxxed: Yes\n-Proof of dox: https://www.protonchain.com/about\n-Smart contract public: Yes\n-Audit: Yes\n-Proof of Audit: https://research.kudelskisecurity.com/2021/03/02/code-assessment-of-proton-chain/\n\n### Functional details\n\nProton seeks to become the interoperable L1 blockchain for banking and payments that connects TradFi to DeFi for every major blockchain. Long term, would like to see every major bank and fintech company look to adopt Proton for identity and cryptocurrency payments (xTokens). Additionally, Proton leading the emergence of decentralized finance connecting legacy institutions, DAOs interfacing with traditional finance in a regulated manner.\n\n \"Until all crypto is instant & feeless, we may never see mass adoption for crypto as the primary method for payments. $XPR Proton solves this problem. It wraps other coins, & makes them instant & feeless. This can be done right now on Proton w/ Bitcoin, Ethereum, $Uni, $BCH, $ada, $BNB, $USDC, #tether, $TUSD, $MTL, $PAX, $PAXG, $LTC, $EOS, $DOGE, & $ADA. We can expect MANY more to come. Not only must fees & speed not be an issue for all cryptos, but the problem of not being able to use cryptos cross-chain needs to be done away with. $XPR Proton solves that problem, again, by wrapping the assets on its chain, and enabling them to be used along with other cryptocurrencies. \n\nWhen all cryptos can be used together, regardless of their native chains, instantly and feeless, it enables developers to build projects that people with all sorts of favorite coins can come to and use their coins on. Unless each coin has the same exact fees and speed, most people will naturally choose whichever coin is the fastest and cheapest. This eliminates the freedom of using whichever currency people want. It puts them in a box. They will either comply with that rule & reluctantly use that crypto because they have to, or they will just leave and go to a chain where the coins they currently hold are accepted. $XPR Proton can solve this problem by making each cryptocurrency instant & feeless.\n\nDevelopers can build on $XPR Proton and not have to worry about a variety of people not using their platform because of cryptocurrency restrictions. Their platform would become equally available and useful for everyone. “Only have Bitcoin? Great! Bitcoin he is instant and feeless!”, “Only have Ethereum or $UNI? No worries, those are instant and feeless here. You don’t have to get stuck with one currency that you don’t want to use, but have to or else you can’t use the project we built.”\n\nIn one wallet, people can have many different cryptos and not worry about which one is best to use according to the speed and fees.\" -u/ProtonRoad \n",

Rather than coordinating networks of devices and data through centralized servers, Jasmy aims to decentralize the process via edge computing and storing data on IPFS, a decentralized storage network. JASMY can be used to transfer tokens between devices and payment for network services.\n\nJasmy - the Japanese Bitcoin \n\nJapan has one of the world's most progressive regulatory climates for digital currencies. It's one of the world's biggest markets for Bitcoin and recognizes digital currencies as legal property under the Payment Services Act (PSA).\n\nBasically, Japan takes the development of the coins very seriously. And it makes sense, since Japan is one of the most popular crypto countries in the world.\n\nCrypto in Japan falls under the category \"crypto assets\" under law. That means it can be used as a means of payment transactions and exchanged with fiat currencies (Japanese Yen, USD).\n\nAnd that brings us to one of the things going for Jasmy Coin. It's a certified Japanese cryptocurrency. You can check it off as legitimate.\n\nMore than that, though, Jasmy leadership may have what it takes to push this coin to new heights.\n\nJasmy's CEO, Kunitake Ando, is the former President and COO of Sony Corp. (NYSE: SONY). The list of high-ranking positions he's held within Sony goes on. Jasmy's President, COO, and Deputy President are former high-ranking Sony employees as well.\n\nAndo's vision of Jasmy is one for the people. He believes the Internet of Things (IoT)-powered fourth industrial revolution is the perfect opportunity to help people retake control of their personal information.",

      "content": "Proposal for Terra [LUNA]\n\nThe Terra Protocol is an open-source stablecoin network controlled by its stakeholders\nMore demand for Terra stablecoins (UST) = more value capture by LUNA - Terra’s decentralized reserve asset.\nAccess the first successful, decentralized algorithmic stablecoin. Participate in the value creation of a new DeFi stack.\n\n\n\n\nFunctional details\n\nUsed for governance and mining, Luna is the Terra protocol's staking token that absorbs the price volatility of Terra stablecoins. Users stake Luna to Terra blockchain miners (called \"validators\"), who record and verify transactions on the blockchain and receive rewards from transaction fees as compensation.\nTerra seeks to set itself apart through its use of fiat-pegged stablecoins, stating that it combines the borderless benefits of cryptocurrencies with the day-to-day price stability of fiat currencies. It keeps its one-to-one peg through an algorithm that automatically adjusts stablecoin supply based on its demand. It does so by incentivizing LUNA holders to swap LUNA and stablecoins at profitable exchange rates, as needed, to either expand or contract the stablecoin supply to match demand.\n\n\nFund allocation and personal opinion\n\nIn the current crypto market lull, it is a good time to accumulate LUNA as it breaks the top 10 cryptos. A market share in LUNA would allow DCIP to\nmaintain control overa coin that represents unique value to investors. The coin has experienced a 3500%+ increase in since it's launch 2 years ago and reached\nit's all time high on 5th Dec before going down with the rest of the market. This would be considered a medium to long term investment",

Holders of the token get reflections and access to the parcels. It is a BSC token with real world applications. Growth is inevitable and there have already been news articles written about GoodNature.\n\nWe are still early in the project and a $4,500 investment will be worth $45,000 at the time of land purchase. \n\nAdding this Token to DCIP will give DCIP real world assets in the portfolio without needing to go through the process of finding what real world land we want. Adding GoodNature will show a strong value on the future growth of DCIP and with more land being aquired, the more attention we will also receive. We can also list the parcels here for voting and even host shareholder meetings at some point on land we own.\n\nWe should liquidate 20% of our portfolio once the market cap reaches 1 million, resulting in strong ownership of GoodNature and also 100% profit on our investment.",

There is a strong chance HOGE will be a formidable meme coin in the upcoming crypto cycles.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nMy proposal is that we only allocate a small portion of the portfolio for this in order to give the fund some \"meme\" exposure without outweighing other more serious components of the fund. I also suggest that we make this allocation via the BSC version to save on fees (even though we wouldn't receive reflections).",

      "content": "\n****Proposal for:** MOVE**\n\nMarketMove is a revolutionary project in the DeFi space, combining game-changing use cases fueled by AI with rewarding tokenomics.\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** MOVE\n- **Token Address:** 0x231cF6F78620e42Fe00D0c5C3088b427F355d01c\n- **Token Type:** Token\n- **Token Chain** Binance Smart Chain\n- \n- **Stage:** Launched\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** https://marketmove.ai/\n- **Team doxxed:** Yes\n- **Proof of dox:** https://marketmove.ai/\n- **Smart contract public:** Yes\n- **Audit:** Unknown \n- **LP Lock:** Unknown\n\n### Functional details\n\nMarketMove leads you by hand through the whole investment process on the BSC network. \n‍\nThe MarketMove app is a one-stop solution for investing on the BSC network: from AI-driven contract audits to limit orders on PancakeSwap and social media trackers. \n\nHolding a specific number of MarketMove tokens will grant access to selected features of the app, which will serve as an additional buying incentive. Ever heard of Unicrypt’s business model? Here’s an improved and more accessible version of it!\n\nMarketMove will protect its investors at all costs, letting the price skyrocket thanks to its unique tokenomics. With the PriceProtect function, MarketMove will do variable buybacks, which adjust based on volume. Someone sells? We buy back and defend the price!\n\nBut that’s not all - MarketMove token is hyper-deflationary, meaning it will be more and more scarce, helping the price rise. \n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\n**$10K - $25K**\n\nOne of the challenges for investors in the world of cryptocurrency is rug pull. MarketMove aims to address this issue with AI-driven contract audits. In simple words, the platform will separate quality projects with strong use cases from purely speculative crypto projects.\n\nMarketMove is also game changing in one key area. Buying and selling on decentralized exchange does not allow for limit orders or stop-loss orders. The project will introduce these functionalities for investors using their platform.\n\nFrom the perspective of tokens, MarketMove had an initial supply of one trillion. However, 75% of the supply was burnt at the beginning.\n\nFurther, MOVE token is hyper-deflationary. In simple words, when people buy or sell the token, there is an associated fee. This burn will reduce the token supply over time and holders will also get reflections. In the coming quarters, MarketMove also intends to launch staking, which will provide additional returns.\n\nIt’s also worth mentioning that MarketMove project has a strong team with the core team having worked in organizations that include Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL McKinsey and Micron (NASDAQ:MU.\n\nOverall, MOVE token is worth holding for long-term investors. The company intends to pursue a big marketing push in Q1 2022. I would not be surprised if the token delivers multi-fold returns in the next few quarters.",

As proposals need to be outstanding for 7 days before executing, that limits our ability to react quickly to market moves.\n\nIn order to facilitate buying future dips in BTC and/or ETH, I propose that we buy $50,000 in USDC now.  Half of these funds would be reserved for BTC dips and half would be reserved for ETH dips.  When BTC and/or ETH experience a price decline of 10% or more over a 24 hour period, these reserved funds would be used to buy BTC and/or ETH without the necessity of a further vote.\n\nThis strategy woulda assure that we are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities provided by future dips.  \n\nTo the extent, there is not sufficient liquidity to meet the approved allocation, I propose that the amount of liquidity available at that time would be used to purchase USDC for this purpose, and as additional liquidity is added to the investment wallet additional USDC would be purchased until the approved allocation is reached.",

      "content": "**# What Is Polkadot (DOT)?**\nPolkadot is an open-source sharding multichain protocol that facilitates the cross-chain transfer of any data or asset types, not just tokens, thereby making a wide range of blockchains interoperable with each other.\n\nThis interoperability seeks to establish a fully decentralized and private web, controlled by its users, and simplify the creation of new applications, institutions and services.\n\nThe Polkadot protocol connects public and private chains, permissionless networks, oracles and future technologies, allowing these independent blockchains to trustlessly share information and transactions through the Polkadot relay chain (explained further down).\n\nPolkadot’s native DOT token serves three clear purposes: providing network governance and operations, and creating parachains (parallel chains) by bonding.\n\nPolkadot has four core components:\n\nRelay Chain: Polkadot’s “heart,” helping to create consensus, interoperability and shared security across the network of different chains;\nParachains: independent chains that can have their own tokens and be optimized for specific use cases;\nParathread: similar to parachains but with flexible connectivity based on an economical pay-as-you-go model;\nBridges: allows parachains and parathreads to connect and communicate with external blockchains like Ethereum.\n\nWhat Makes Polkadot Unique?\nPolkadot is a sharded multichain network, meaning it can process many transactions on several chains in parallel (“parachains”). This parallel processing power improves scalability.\n\nCustom blockchains are quick and easy to develop through the Substrate framework and can be connected to Polkadot’s network within minutes. The network is also highly flexible and adaptive, allowing the sharing of information and functionality between participants similar to apps on a smartphone. Polkadot can be automatically upgraded without the need for a fork in order to implement new features or remove bugs.\n\nThe network has a highly sophisticated user-driven governance system that also helps to secure it. Communities can customize their blockchain’s governance on Polkadot based on their needs and evolving conditions. Nominators, validators, collators and fishermen all fulfil various duties to help secure and maintain the network and eradicate bad behavior.",

Audius was launched to remedy the inefficiencies of the music industry, which is plagued by intransparent music rights ownership and intermediaries standing between artists and their audience.\n\nAudius aims to align the interests of artists, fans, and node operators through its platform powered by its native AUDIO token. Artists can upload music, stored and distributed by content and discovery nodes, that fans can listen to for free. Currently, Audius rewards content creators through rewards like featuring in the weekly trending lists. In the future, it plans to integrate stablecoins for artists to offer paid content, as well as artist tokens that give fans the ability to access exclusive content, potentially cooperating with platforms like Rally.\n\nWhat Makes Audius Unique?\nThe Audius ecosystem consists of four main participants: artists, fans, content nodes and discovery nodes.\n\nArtists publish content on the Audius content ledger. They can do so at no cost and music is streamed at 320kbps, comparable to standards of Spotify and Google Play Music. Because of Audius’ decentralized nature, there is no copyright protection, although the protocol is working on an arbitration system that will be overlooked by the community. Artists can use Audius to experiment or share bonus tracks, and the platform plans to include artist tokens to facilitate monetization, subject to artists staking AUDIO. Artists can also articipate in reward schemes that see tokens airdropped to the most popular artists.\n\nFans can listen to tracks for free and may in the future be able to stake AUDIO to participate in artists’ growth on the platform. They can also showcase their verified NFTs through the platform and earn different badges.\n\nContent nodes maintain the availability of content on AudSP, the platform-native extension to IPFS. An artist’s client elects a set of these nodes to do so automatically on the artist’s behalf, while fan clients fetch the content, submit proof, and request keys to content nodes. Artists could also choose to run their own content nodes and maintain greater control over their content distribution. The content ledger maintains a record and a single source of truth for all actions on the protocol.\n\nDiscovery nodes index metadata queryable by users In other words, they enable users to find new content and act as its registry on the platform.",

      "content": "# What Is The Graph (GRT)?\nThe Graph is an indexing protocol for querying data for networks like Ethereum and IPFS, powering many applications in both DeFi and the broader Web3 ecosystem. Anyone can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, that applications can query using GraphQL to retrieve blockchain data. There is a hosted service in production that makes it easy for developers to get started building on The Graph and the decentralized network will be launching later this year. The Graph currently supports indexing data from Ethereum, IPFS and POA, with more networks coming soon.\n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of The Graph.\n\nTo date, over 3,000 subgraphs have been deployed by thousands of developers, for DApps like Uniswap, Synthetix, Aragon, AAVE, Gnosis, Balancer, Livepeer, DAOstack, Decentraland and many others. The Graph usage has been growing at over 50% MoM and hit over 7 billion queries during the month of September 2020.\n\nThe Graph has a global community, including over 200 Indexer Nodes in the testnet and more than 2,000 Curators in the Curator Program as of October 2020. To fund network development, The Graph raised funds from community members, strategic VCs and influential individuals in the blockchain community including Coinbase Ventures, DCG, Framework, ParaFi Capital, CoinFund, DTC, Multicoin, Reciprocal Ventures, SPC, Tally Capital and others. The Graph Foundation also successfully completed a public GRT Sale with participation from 99 countries (not including the U.S.). To date as of November 2020, The Graph has raised ~$25M.\n\nWhat Makes The Graph Unique?\nThe Graph is working to bring reliable decentralized public infrastructure to the mainstream market. To ensure economic security of The Graph Network and the integrity of data being queried, participants use Graph Token (GRT). GRT is a work token that is locked-up by Indexers, Curators and Delegators in order to provide indexing and curating services to the network.\n\nGRT will be an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, used to allocate resources in the network. Active Indexers, Curators and Delegators can earn income from the network proportional to the amount of work they perform and their GRT stake. Indexers earn indexing rewards (new issuance) and query fees, while Curators earn a portion of query fees for the subgraphs they signal on. Delegators earn a portion of income earned by the Indexer they delegate to.",

Launched in March 2019, the Theta mainnet operates as a decentralized network in which users share bandwidth and computing resources on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis.The project is advised by Steve Chen, co-founder of YouTube and Justin Kan, co-founder of Twitch.\n\nTheta features its own native cryptocurrency token, THETA, which performs various governance tasks within the network, and counts Google, Binance, Blockchain ventures, Gumi, Sony Europe and Samsung as Enterprise validators, along with a Guardian network of thousands of community-run guardian nodes.\n\nDevelopers say that the project aims to shake up the video streaming industry in its current form — centralization, poor infrastructure and high costs mean that end users often end up with a poor experience. Content creators likewise earn less revenue due to the barriers between them and end users.\n\nWhat Makes Theta Unique?\nTheta’s main business concept is to decentralize video streaming, data delivery and edge computing, making it more efficient, cost-effective and fair for industry participants.\n\nThe network runs on a native blockchain, with two native tokens, known as Theta (THETA), Theta Fuel (TFUEL), powering the internal economy.\n\nTheta’s appeal is threefold: viewers get rewarded with better quality streaming service, content creators improve their earnings and middlemen — video platforms — save money on building infrastructure and increase advertising and subscription revenues.\n\nUsers have an incentive to both watch network content and share network resources, as rewards come in the form of TFUEL tokens.\n\nThe platform is open source, and token holders receive governance powers as with many proof-of-stake (PoS)-based blockchain ecosystems.\n\nIn addition to video, data and computing, Theta caters to developers looking to launch decentralized applications (DApps) on its fully featured EVM-compatible Smart contract platform.",

However, the launch date for the Filecoin mainnet was pushed back until block 148,888, which is expected in mid-October 2020.\n\nThe project was first described back in 2014 as an incentive layer for the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), a peer-to-peer storage network. Filecoin is open protocol and backed by a blockchain that records commitments made by the network’s participants, with transactions made using FIL, the blockchain’s native currency. The blockchain is based on both proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime.\n\nWhat Makes Filecoin Unique?\nFilecoin aims to store data in a decentralized manner. Unlike cloud storage companies like Amazon Web Services or Cloudflare, which are prone to the problems of centralization, Filecoin leverages its decentralized nature to protect the integrity of a data’s location, making it easily retrievable and hard to censor.\n\nDecentralized storage systems like Filecoin allow people to be their own custodians of their data, as well as makes the web more accessible to people worldwide. Since participating in the Filecoin network by mining and storing is directly related to winning more block rewards, Filecoin incentives participants to act honestly and store as much data as possible",

      "title": "Band Protocol : BAND ( Web 3.0 )",
      "content": "# What Is Band Protocol (BAND)?\nBand Protocol is a cross-chain data oracle platform that is able to take real-world data and supply it to on-chain applications, while also connecting APIs to smart-contracts to facilitate the exchange of information between on-chain and off-chain data sources.\n\nBy supplying reputable, verifiable real-world data to blockchains, Band Protocol unlocks a range of new use cases for developers to explore — since they can now use any type of real-world data as part of their decentralized application (DApp) logic, including sports, weather, random numbers, price feed data and more.\n\nBand Protocol initially launched as an ERC-20 project on the Ethereum blockchain in September 2019, but transitioned to the Cosmos network in June 2020 with the release of Band Protocol 2.0. The new protocol is built on BandChain using the Cosmos SDK. Oracle nodes on BandChain not only relay data but are also involved in block production/validation, giving them a dual role.\n\nBAND is the native token of the Band Protocol ecosystem and is used as collateral by validators involved in fulfilling data requests, as well as the main medium of exchange on BandChain — being used to paying for private data.\n\nWhat Makes Band Protocol Unique?\nBand Protocol is designed to be faster and more efficient than competing oracle solutions and is also compatible with most blockchain and smart contract development frameworks — ensuring reliable data can be fed to and from multiple different blockchains.\n\nTo achieve its cross-chain data transfer, Band Protocol plans to leverage Cosmos' still in-development Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. It remains unclear how long it will take until the IBC is operational and ready for use.\n\nBand Protocol is designed to offer permissionless oracle creation, allowing anybody to start servicing data requests. It also offers extremely simple smart contract integration, allowing developers to begin using data from Band Protocol oracles with just a few lines of code by calling on a predefined interface.",

XRP is the currency that runs on a digital payment platform called RippleNet, which is on top of a distributed ledger database called XRP Ledger. While RippleNet is run by a company called Ripple, the XRP Ledger is open-source and is not based on blockchain, but rather the previously mentioned distributed ledger database.\n\nThe RippleNet payment platform is a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system that aims to enable instant monetary transactions globally. While XRP is the cryptocurrency native to the XRP Ledger, you can actually use any currency to transact on the platform.\n\nWhile the idea behind the Ripple payment platform was first voiced in 2004 by Ryan Fugger, it wasn’t until Jed McCaleb and Chris Larson took over the project in 2012 that Ripple began to be built (at the time, it was also called OpenCoin).\n\nXRP was created by Ripple to be a speedy, less costly and more scalable alternative to both other digital assets and existing monetary payment platforms like SWIFT.\n\nRippleNet’s ledger is maintained by the global XRP Community, with Ripple the company as an active member. The XRP Ledger processes transactions roughly every 3-5 seconds, or whenever independent validator nodes come to a consensus on both the order and validity of XRP transactions — as opposed to proof-of-work mining like Bitcoin (BTC). Anyone can be a Ripple validator, and the list is currently made up of Ripple along with universities, financial institutions and others.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nXRP has pretty good real world utility for the cross-border transfer of assets. It also seems poised to win the suit that the SEC brought against them - I'm personally reading this as the SEC not being happy with them rocking the boat and I'm all about rocking the status quo!\n\nHere is an [article](https://financefeeds.com/ripple-ex-goldman-exec-says-xrp-lawsuit-is-a-phenomenal-risk-reward/) in which an ex-Goldman Sachs exec states that investing in XRP now has a high potential for a risk vs reward payoff too. I believe the timing is right - while the rest of the market is deflated at this current time - to get in on a modest investment in XRP.\n\nThanks for taking the time to consider my proposal fellow investors. :)",

Each TIME token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g., MIM, TIME-AVAX LP Tokens etc etc) in the Wonderland treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. Wonderland also introduces economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and minting. \n\n\nMore information Here:\n\nhttps://docs.wonderland.money/\n\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nSo essentially the longer the users stake hold on this coin, assuming the coin price stays the same, the APY compounds to a rate as advertised by minting coins to the users that stake there TIME for long periods of time.  You have to buy the coins though to enter the staking process and this is backed by other users Minting LP tokens into the platform in which they can get a discount on TIME tokens to sell in the short term to collect a small discount on TIME while holding up the coin via bond so there is always value backed into the platform.  Assuming this process of buying TIME,  Staking, and Minting LP the APY can continue to hold and generate new tokens to the Stakers/Minters\n\n\nSo my personal opinion is to purchase a reasonable sum of tokens for our DCIP.Finance token holders and hold in the Staking Process for at least 365 days, on the 365th day we can liquidate our holdings and burn additional DCIP tokens from the proceeds.  I would not recommend extending the timeframe with a hard cut off after 365 days.\n\n\nWith a simple 10,000 Stake investment over 365 days $7,889,795.00 would be earned with the current TIME and APY rates.\n\nWith $50,000 over $39,466,484.57\n\nWith $100,000 over $78,897,950.08\n\n    \n\nJust as a informative note, this can only be purchased on the Avalanche Network with a Avalanche enabled wallet, the token \"AVAX\" is the token needed to purchase TIME on https://traderjoexyz.com/, and at https://app.wonderland.money/ the TIME needs to be staked which will give the users on the app MEMO showing that you have successfully staked your position.\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "Proposal for: Euphoria\n\nOver 800,000%+ APY is available for staking Euphoria WAGMI token on the Harmony Network\n\n\n### Technical details\n\n\n- **Token Name:** Euphoria + WAGMI\n\n- **Token Address:** 0x0dc78c79b4eb080ead5c1d16559225a46b580694  Available on Viperswap.one\n\n- **Token Type:** [Token, NFT, Other]\n\n- **Token Chain** [Harmony Network]\n\n- **Other:** https://app.euphoria.money/ \n\n- **Stage:** [Launched]\n\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** [https://docs.euphoria.money/]\n\n- **Team doxxed:** No, can't find info\n\n- **Proof of dox:** Can't find\n\n- **Smart contract public:** [Yes]\n\n- **Audit:** [Yes]\n\n- **Proof of Audit:** https://solidity.finance/audits/ViperSwap/\n\n- **LP Lock:** Kinda, Self Funded\n\n- **LP Lock proof:** Coins minted upon staking and minting\n\n\nEuphoria is an algorithmic reserve currency protocol on Harmony based on the WAGMI token. Each WAGMI token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. DAI, UST, WAGMI-DAI LP Tokens, WAGMI-UST LP Tokens, etc) in the Euphoria Treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. Similar to Wonderland and Olympus, Euphoria also introduces economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and purchasing bonds.\n\n\nMore information Here:\n\nhttps://docs.euphoria.money/\n\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nSo essentially the longer the users stake hold on this coin, assuming the coin price stays the same, the APY compounds to a rate as advertised by minting coins to the users that stake there WAGMI for long periods of time.  You have to buy the coins though to enter the staking process and this is backed by other users Minting LP tokens into the platform in which they can get a discount on WAGMI tokens to sell in the short term to collect a small discount on WAGMI while holding up the coin via bond so there is always value backed into the platform.  Assuming this process of buying WAGMI,  Staking, and Minting LP the APY can continue to hold and generate new tokens to the Stakers/Minters\n\n\nSo my personal opinion is to purchase a reasonable sum of tokens for our DCIP.Finance token holders and hold in the Staking Process for at least 365 days, on the 365th day we can liquidate our holdings and burn additional DCIP tokens from the proceeds.  I would not recommend extending the timeframe with a hard cut off after 365 days.\n\n\nWith a simple 10,000 Stake investment over 365 days $91,685,949.33 would be earned with the current WAGMI and APY rates.\n\nWith $50,000 over $458,372,046.26\n\nWith $100,000 over $916,859,493.35\n\n\nJust as a informative note, this can only be purchased on the Harmony Network with a Harmony enabled wallet, the token \"ONE\" is the token needed to purchase WAGMI on Viperswap.one, and at https://app.euphoria.money/ the WAGMI needs to be staked which will give the users wallet sWAGMI showing that you have successfully staked your position.\n\n",

      "content": "\nProposal for Terra [LUNA]\n\nThe Terra Protocol is an open-source stablecoin network controlled by its stakeholders\nMore demand for Terra stablecoins (UST) = more value capture by LUNA - Terra’s decentralized reserve asset.\nAccess the first successful, decentralized algorithmic stablecoin. Participate in the value creation of a new DeFi stack.\n\n\n\n\nFunctional details\n\nUsed for governance and mining, Luna is the Terra protocol's staking token that absorbs the price volatility of Terra stablecoins. Users stake Luna to Terra blockchain miners (called \"validators\"), who record and verify transactions on the blockchain and receive rewards from transaction fees as compensation.\nTerra seeks to set itself apart through its use of fiat-pegged stablecoins, stating that it combines the borderless benefits of cryptocurrencies with the day-to-day price stability of fiat currencies. It keeps its one-to-one peg through an algorithm that automatically adjusts stablecoin supply based on its demand. It does so by incentivizing LUNA holders to swap LUNA and stablecoins at profitable exchange rates, as needed, to either expand or contract the stablecoin supply to match demand.\n\n\nFund allocation and personal opinion\n\nIn the current crypto market lull, it is a good time to accumulate LUNA as it breaks the top 10 cryptos. A market share in LUNA would allow DCIP to\nmaintain control overa coin that represents unique value to investors. The coin has experienced a 3500%+ increase in since it's launch 2 years ago and reached\nit's all time high on 5th Dec before going down with the rest of the market. This would be considered a medium to long term investment",

      "content": "**Proposal for:** [Internet of Energy Network (IOEN)]\n \n[The open protocol and standard for enabling connection and value flows between any energy device,\nuser, or market.]\n \n### Technical details\n \n- **Token Name:** [Internet of Energy Network (IOEN)]\n- **Token Address:** [0x1e4E46b7BF03ECE908c88FF7cC4975560010893A]\n- **Token Type:** [Token]\n- **Token Chain** [Ethereum]\n- **Stage:** [Launched]\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** [https://www.ioen.tech/whitepaper]\n- **Team doxxed:** [Yes]\n- **Proof of dox:** [https://www.ioen.tech/about]\n \n \n### Functional details\n \nIOEN believes clean energy microgrids are the future of energy and they are creating and delivering the digital infrastructure through blockchain and holochain technologies to accelerate this transition.\n \nEnergy is currently in the hands of a large, entrenched infrastructure at the national level. Microgrids will democratize that and give energy to the local level. The current grid lacks a transactive energy system where you can coordinate and integrate safely. The problem is not a lack of technology or ability for devices to transact but that there is no common service for their coordination. IOEN is currently being used in collaboration with Mirvac, one of Australia’s largest property developers.\n \n \n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n \nI believe a small investment in this project will be profitable in the long term. Energy is a critical part of our lives and currently we are limited to getting it from the powers that be at a macro level or supplying our own on the micro level through wind and solar. When going the latter route there is nothing to do with the excess energy created/stored. IOEN will allow efficient and cooperative micro grids sprout up and begin to scale up together.\n    ",

      "title": "Proposed Changes to Voting Rules",
      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** Changes to Voting Rules\n\nI believe there are two areas with respect to the voting rules that could be improved upon:\n\na) Most proposals are not reaching quorum. The vast majority - even proposals that were professionally prepared and well described - are expiring far from quorum.  Many holders may prefer to approach DCIP as a passive investment and rarely vote, if ever.  This is fine as we should endeavor to appeal to holders with differing approaches.  However, we cannot allow the lack of voting to prevent the ability of active holders to pass favorable proposals.  Getting the investment wallet fully invested in favorable projects is critical to the future of this project - in addition to generating returns for holders, the successful investment activity should serve to validate the use case and help to attract new holders. \n\nb) The current proposal system requires a 7 day period before proposals are deemed approved, even if a quorum is reached in advance of this timeframe.  The downside of requiring each proposal to season for a full 7 days is that it limits our ability to take quick action in response to market movements.  For example, following the recent \"flash crash,\" holders voted to invest additional amounts in Bitcoin given the significantly reduced price. While quorum and an overwhelmingly positive vote was achieved within hours, it is not clear if the current system would allow making the investment prior to the passage of the full 7 days.\n\nI propose that we make certain changes to the voting rules in order to: reduce the quorum requirements to assure that favorable proposals can be passed; and, 2) allow for implementation of proposals with a certain level of support in a reduced timeframe.\n\nFollowing are the specific adjustments that are proposed:\n\n*The following quorum tiers would be established:  Tier 1 - 25tn votes (Current quorum level); and Tier 2 - 10tn votes.\n\n*Beginning 4 full days after a proposal is made, it would be deemed fully approved if it receives a majority of votes in agreement and reaches a Tier 1 quorum level.  If the foregoing criteria is not met, the proposal shall remain open for 10 full days following the time it is submitted.  At the end of such 10 day period, the proposal would be deemed fully approved if it received a majority of votes in agreement and reaches a Tier 2 quorum level, otherwise it would be deemed rejected.\n\nI believe that these changes will benefit the community by assuring that favorable proposals can be passed following an adequate seasoning period notwithstanding limited voting participation, and further provide for an ability to act more quickly in response to emerging market conditions.\n\n  \n",

In the blockchain ecosystem, there are decentralized finance (DeFi)platforms and centralized finance (CeFi) platforms. The DeFi ecosystem is not regulated by a central bank but the assets show publicly on the blockchain network while in the CeFi eco-system, assets are being handled through an intermediate exchange. The BSC blockchain incorporates SafeMoon to run in a CeFi ecosystem. \nCore features of SafeMoon\n\nReflection: The white paper of the project reports that SafeMoon holders are charged a transaction fee of about 5%, which is distributed among the holders of the coin.\nLP acquisition: The white paper also revealed that this second core component of the project charges transaction fees of about 5%, which will be issued to various liquidity pools on PancakeSwap and other platforms.\nToken burn: The project’s white paper also showcased that every transaction that occurs on the mainnet is taxed 10%. The idea is that 5% of the tax will be as reflection rewards while the other 5% goes to the liquidity pools. Half of the 5% that goes to the liquidity pools are converted into Binance Coin (BNB) in order to guarantee the liquidity of the SafeMoon and Binance coin pair.\n\n\nKey Accomplishments and Objectives \n\n- 2.9 Million Holders \n\n- AIBC Malta Community of the Year \n\n- Wallet Release on Android and IoS\n\n- V2 implementation underway to allow for more exchange listings \n\n- Exchange under implementation to handle tokenomics \n\n- Blockchain under implementation \n\n- Working on implementation in African countries for adoption \n   ",

      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** BinStarter\n\nBinStarter is a decentralized insurance protocol which has a mining-style approval mechanism that brings together projects and liquidity providers.\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** BinStarter | BSR\n- **Token Address:** 0xab287e6d370c61f105630e656b5468acb4d00423\n- **Token Type:** Utility\n- **Token Chain** Binance Smart Chain\n- **Stage:** Launched\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** https://binstarter.io/bsrdoc/BinStarter-Whitepaper-PDF.pdf\n- **Team doxxed:** No\n- **Smart contract public:** Yes\n- **Audit:** Yes\n- **Proof of Audit:** https://github.com/TechRate/Smart-Contract-Audits/blob/main/BinStarter%20Full%20Smart%20Contract%20Security%20Audit.pdf\n- **LP Lock:** Yes\n- **LP Lock proof:** https://bscscan.com/tx/0x05841ce6e8d2998caee5ad73dffa59be6af7ffd6bd8f6c779ac01e07fcfc8c4f\n\n### Functional details\n\nBinStarter has a different working structure than other platforms that provide solutions for IDO. Although BinStarter is considered as a decentralized structure, it is actually subject to approval with an \"evaluation pool\" and number of protocols.\n\nIt works in a structure similar to the mining system in bitcoin, inspired by the blockchain approval mechanism. So, what is the advantage of this structure? \n\nIn decentralized structures, the control mechanisms are still not at a sufficient level, so project owners or liquidity providers may be damaged due to various reasons.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nBinStarter can give us guaranteed access to IDO's based on the total holdings staked. The APY for staking is pretty huge, upto 990%. I'm proposing 3 different amounts based on the staking pool minimum allocation. I've invested myself in the seed sale (1 BNB total) and receiving 17 BSR daily staking rewards (approx 50-60 dollars, dependent on current token price). The staking rewards alone can be a nice passive income to expand our community investment wallet.\n\nI made an example calculation with the minimum allocation per staking pool. As you can see the passive income can be very lucrative. My proposal is to buy 16000 BSR tokens for approx 50K and stake the tokens in pool 5. This will generate a passive income of approx $300 per day (with the current token price).\n\n### Pool 4\n- **Minimum allocation:** 8000 BSR (approx $25.000)\n- **APY:** 420%\n- **APR:** 165.24%\n- **Daily Int:** 0.45% (8000/100*0.45 = 36 BSR = +/- $108)\n\n### Pool 5\n- **Minimum allocation:** 16000 BSR (approx $50.000)\n- **APY:** 900%\n- **APR:** 230.99%\n- **Daily Int:** 0.63% (16000/100*0.63 = 100,8 BSR = +/- $300)\n\n### Pool 6\n- **Minimum allocation:** 32000 BSR (approx $100.000)\n- **APY:** 990%\n- **APR:** 239.66%\n- **Daily Int:** 0.66% (32000/100*0.66 = 211,2 BSR = +/- $630)",

Now, more than ever, the work that has been done in the blockchain ecosystem needs to be harnessed and made wholly accessible to the builders, creators, and users of this new technological revolution.\n\nThe Nervos Network represents the entire ecosystem of Nervos and is a collection of protocols, layer 2’s and public blockchains underpinned by the Nervos CKB and CKByte token.\n\nA core design principle at Nervos is that layer 2 solutions such as side-chains, plasma chains and state channels are the best way to scale a blockchain system. Rather than compromising the decentralization and security of the base layer through largely untested and novel consensus mechanisms in order to achieve high performance and TPS, we utilize layer 2 solutions that bring nearly unlimited transaction capabilities and minimal transaction cost to a layer 1 blockchain that’s designed to be secure, permissionless and decentralized. This in our opinion is the only way to solve the scalability trilemma.\n\nAlongside several deployments currently being worked on by the Nervos team - enterprises, developers and users are welcome and encouraged to utilize the CKB to deploy layer 2 solutions, dapps, protocols and blockchains.",

It was launched soon after, in January 2009.\n\nBitcoin is a peer-to-peer online currency, meaning that all transactions happen directly between equal, independent network participants, without the need for any intermediary to permit or facilitate them. Bitcoin was created, according to Nakamoto’s own words, to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”\n\nSome concepts for a similar type of a decentralized electronic currency precede BTC, but Bitcoin holds the distinction of being the first-ever cryptocurrency to come into actual use.",

      "content": "# What Is Polkadot (DOT)?\nPolkadot is an open-source sharding multichain protocol that facilitates the cross-chain transfer of any data or asset types, not just tokens, thereby making a wide range of blockchains interoperable with each other.\n\nThis interoperability seeks to establish a fully decentralized and private web, controlled by its users, and simplify the creation of new applications, institutions and services.\n\nThe Polkadot protocol connects public and private chains, permissionless networks, oracles and future technologies, allowing these independent blockchains to trustlessly share information and transactions through the Polkadot relay chain (explained further down).\n\nPolkadot’s native DOT token serves three clear purposes: providing network governance and operations, and creating parachains (parallel chains) by bonding.\n\nPolkadot has four core components:\n\nRelay Chain: Polkadot’s “heart,” helping to create consensus, interoperability and shared security across the network of different chains;\nParachains: independent chains that can have their own tokens and be optimized for specific use cases;\nParathread: similar to parachains but with flexible connectivity based on an economical pay-as-you-go model;\nBridges: allows parachains and parathreads to connect and communicate with external blockchains like Ethereum.\n\nWhat Makes Polkadot Unique?\nPolkadot is a sharded multichain network, meaning it can process many transactions on several chains in parallel (“parachains”). This parallel processing power improves scalability.\n\nCustom blockchains are quick and easy to develop through the Substrate framework and can be connected to Polkadot’s network within minutes. The network is also highly flexible and adaptive, allowing the sharing of information and functionality between participants similar to apps on a smartphone. Polkadot can be automatically upgraded without the need for a fork in order to implement new features or remove bugs.\n\nThe network has a highly sophisticated user-driven governance system that also helps to secure it. Communities can customize their blockchain’s governance on Polkadot based on their needs and evolving conditions. Nominators, validators, collators and fishermen all fulfil various duties to help secure and maintain the network and eradicate bad behavior.",

SteamX is aiming to fill that void.  Starting on the BSC blockchain with an eventual move in Q1 2022 to their own blockchain and native coin.\n\nSteamX is a registered business in Canada, both a corporation registration and a Money Service Business (MSB) license and registered with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC).  All licenses viewable in the whitepaper.\n\nPartnered with University of Waterloo, a top tech school in Canada to both leverage their educational resources and onboard students with their dev team.\n\nThe exchange is planned to launch Q1 2022 at which time tokens will be swapped for native coins.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nThey have so much potential to succeed and we can get in early.   I encourage you to read through their documentation, and I believe we should get onboard while we still can.\n\nDue to the SteamX being a newer company the fund allocation proposed is lower than many investments seen here, minimizing our risk.\n\nIn addition to the fund allocation proposed I propose liquidating a portion of these funds once the investment reaches certain performance, providing a known return for us DCIP holders.   100% of the original investment will be liquidated once the value has tripled.  i.e., invest $10,000, once the value is $30,000, $10,000 is liquidated back into the DCIP investment wallet.  The remaining amount will be held until a later vote.\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "What Is Decentraland (MANA)?\nDecentraland (MANA) defines itself as a virtual reality platform powered by the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to create, experience, and monetize content and applications.\n\nIn this virtual world, users purchase plots of land that they can later navigate, build upon and monetize.\n\nDecentraland was launched following a $24 million initial coin offering (ICO) that was conducted in 2017. The virtual world launched its closed beta in 2019 and opened to the public in February 2020. Since then, users have created a wide range of experiences on their parcels of LAND, including interactive games, sprawling 3D scenes and a variety of other interactive experiences.\n\nDecentraland uses two tokens: MANA and LAND. MANA is an ERC-20 token that must be burned to acquire non-fungible ERC-721 LAND tokens. MANA tokens can also be used to pay for a range of avatars, wearables, names, and more on the Decentraland marketplace.\n\nWhat Makes Decentraland Unique?\nDecentraland is built for content creators, businesses and individuals that are looking for a new artistic medium, business opportunity, or source of entertainment.\n\nIn total, the Decentraland gameworld — termed the “Metaverse” — is divided into 90,601 individual parcels of LAND, each of which is represented by an ERC-721 non-fungible token. Each LAND is exactly 16m x 16m (256 square meters) and can be found at a particular coordinate in the Metaverse.\n\nThough LAND holders are free to develop their plot into whatever they choose, much of the Metaverse is broadly divided into several districts, each of which has a different size and theme. These districts were generated through individual crowdsales for MANA tokens, and parcels of LAND in these districts cannot be traded.\n\nAs of January 2021, the cyberpunk-themed Aetheria is the largest district — comprising a total of 8,008 LAND.\n\nDecentraland is also one of the growing number of projects to use a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure for governance decisions. As a result, MANA toker holders are in control of how the Decentraland world behaves, by proposing and voting on policy updates, the specifics of upcoming LAND auctions and the types of content that are allowed with the Metaverse.\n\nBesides being a creative outlet, many Decentraland users currently monetize their LAND through leasing, advertising and paid experiences. Likewise, other users generate an income by creating and selling items on the Decentraland marketplace for MANA tokens.",

      "title": "Solana - SOL",
      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** Solana (SOL)\n\n[A one-line description of the token]\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** Solana (SOL)\n\n### Functional details\n\nSolana is a decentralized computing platform that uses SOL to pay for transactions. Solana aims to improve blockchain scalability by using a combination of proof of stake consensus and so-called proof of history. As a result, Solana claims to be able to support 50,000 transactions per second without sacrificing decentralization.\n\nHow it works\nOne way Solana achieves high transaction speeds is via a combination of the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and a new mechanism called “proof of history.” Proof of history is designed to keep time between computers on a decentralized network without all the computers having to communicate about it and come to an agreement. \n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nPro: Speed and fees\n\nPerhaps the biggest selling point of Solana is its transaction speed. Solana may be the best potential Ethereum rival among altcoins, largely because of its speed. Solana can support tens of thousands of transactions per second compared to only about 13 transactions for Ethereum, which currently operates on a proof-of-work, or PoW, model that requires miners to complete complex calculations to validate transactions. Solana's proof-of-history, or PoH, and proof-of-stake, or PoS, models verify transactions based on coin ownership. This ease of verification also helps Solana have lower fees than Ethereum. Solana’s average fee is less than 1 cent per transaction.\n\nPro: NFTs and smart contracts\n\nEthereum was the first cryptocurrency to introduce smart contracts, which is code that allows blockchain platforms to run decentralized applications, or dApps. However, the popularity of smart contracts and dApps has led to congestion on the Ethereum network, opening the door for faster alternatives. Solana is also rapidly gaining market share in the high-growth non-fungible token world. NFT marketplace Solanart runs on the Solana network, allowing NFT buyers to enjoy faster transaction speeds and lower fees than buyers on the Ethereum network. Booming demand for smart contracts and NFTs could open the door for both Ethereum and Solana to succeed in the long term.\n\nPro: Environmental impact\n\nOne of the biggest criticisms of Bitcoin and Ethereum as next-generation technology is their negative environmental impact. The computing power needed for mining Bitcoin and verifying transactions via its PoW model currently generates about 60 million tons of carbon dioxide per year, giving Bitcoin roughly the same carbon footprint as the entire country of Greece. Bitcoin's carbon footprint is also why Elon Musk reversed course on Tesla Inc. (ticker: TSLA) accepting Bitcoin as payment earlier this year. Solana's PoS and PoH verification process is far less energy-intensive, potentially making the crypto a greener alternative to Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n    ",

Updated every 30 seconds to show you trending tokens and presales from multiple platforms (DXSale, Unicrypt, and others);\n\n- Allows users to save tokens they find interesting to the “Favorite” tab to stay up to date.\n\n- Shows users information about tokens they already own and their price action.\n \n- Allows users tp set email or Telegram alerts to easily track the price even before CoinMarketCap listings.\n\n\n*AI-driven contract audit*\n\n- “MarketMove uses BERT (developed by Google), GPT-3 (developed by OpenAI), along with our proprietary algorithms to show you exactly what each function in the contract does. The model was trained on more than 97,000 smart contracts and manually labeled. This way, we describe each function in a very simple language. Even your grandpa will be able to understand what blacklist or mint functions mean.”\n\n- “It scans contracts for potential risk factors, which could result in a rug pull or honeypot.”\n\n- “The engine includes a glossary of the most popular terms related to smart contracts. We don’t want you to solely rely on MarketMove. We want to teach you what honeypots are and how to spot them on your own.”\n\n\n*AI-driven presale audit*\n\n- “It lets you automatically audit presales from multiple platforms, analyzing their liquidity, supply, lockers, tokens held outside the presale, and multiple other factors.\nWe will initially support DXSale and Unicrypt. Additional platforms will be added.”\n\n*Social media tracker*\n\n- “Every 30 seconds, our social media tracker scrapes data from Twitter, Reddit, Telegram, and 4chan to provide you with a full overview of social media presence for tokens you select.”\n\n- Filter the activity by custom date ranges.\n\n- Set email and Telegram notifications for trending tokens based on selected criteria (e.g. number of social media mentions growing exponentially, members on a Telegram group tripled in the last 24 hours). \n\n- Include custom keywords for notifications. With “private sale”, you will never miss out on a one again.\n\n*Whale watcher*\n\n- “We believe that the data itself is useless. We don’t care what specific number of tokens a whale just dumped or bought. We care how it affects the price and how it can affect it in the future. It is especially important when the volume is high.”\n\n- MarketMove provides a ranking of whales for your favorite tokens, paired with their transactions, and to what extent each of those transactions affected the price (displayed in %).\n\n- It also displays how many tokens a whale still owns and how it can potentially affect the price if he wanted to dump.\n\n*Limit & stop-loss orders*\n- Place limit buy, limit sell, and stop-loss orders on PancakeSwap and other exchanges.\n\n- Set slippage manually or use our auto-calculate feature to make sure your transaction goes through.\n\n- Scheduled DCA buy and sell orders.\n\n- Email and Telegram notifications after executing each transaction.\n\n- Optional feature to automatically activate or deactivate a stop-loss order if the price fluctuates too much, paired with volume and number of sellers. You will be able to use a selected threshold (e.g. “deactivate my stop-loss if the >15% dump was caused by only 1 seller).\n\n*Presale & Launch Snipers*\n- To find new coins with potential & get in on the ground floor.\n\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nThis coin has a novel use case that has the potential to make crypto much more accessible to the everyday person. It aims to solve some pervasive problems with BSC & exchanges like PancakeSwap, and does it in a way that makes crypto more approachable than ever. The team has experience developing AI for Fotune 100 companies, is doxxed, holds no developer wallets, and holds frequent AMA’s. \n\nI propose a small, long-term investment in MOVE, which plans to have a strong marketing campaign & release v2 of their app in early 2022. \n\nThis is not a moonshot coin, this is not a coin that already has a massive market cap, this is a coin with the potential to go far. A small investment today can be a big payoff tomorrow.\n\n",

      "title": "SatoshiSwap Presale",
      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** SatoshiSwap \n\nHighly anticipated upcoming project from SatoshiStreetBets.\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** SatoshiSwap\n- **Token Address:** N/A\n- **Token Type:** Token\n- **Token Chain** Ethereum Presale & Binance Smart Chain after launch.\n- **Stage:** Announced, Pre-sale information & white paper released on December 10 when the website goes live.\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** Available December 10 when the SatoshiSwap website goes live.\n- **Team doxxed:** No\n\n### Functional details\n\nThe most information has been given via this Reddit post earlier today: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/comments/r6p85a/satoshiswap_update_what_to_expect_in_december/\n\n> Dear gang,\n> \n> Inquiring minds and professional moonboys want to know when they can YOLO their life savings into SatoshiSwap and we're pleased to deliver an important update!\n> \n> TDLR: The SatoshiSwap website and Whitelist Dashboard both go live on December 10th. The actual presale date will be announced on the 10th. There will now be 2 tokens, one of which is SatoshiSwap, the other is a surprise. Both will be distributed in equal amounts to everyone who takes part.\n> \n> _We'd like to remind everyone this is a community based project. SatoshiStreetBets has been built up to a thriving community of 750k degens across our different networks (Discord, Twitter, Telegram groups) and a pledge we are making is these tokens will be fully integrated and backed by the official SatoshiStreetBets platforms. You will see us pushing SatoshiSwap week-in week-out across all our platforms (Twitter, Telegram groups, Discord)... not just for the next few weeks, but for years to come. And over time we'll be continuously adding innovative new DeFi products to the protocol - we're actually already working on the second product right now._ \n> \n> **Schedule of events**\n> \n> 1. The SatoshiSwap website goes live December 10th. This will contain all of the necessary information for degens to do their due diligence, including everything you will possibly need to know about the presale event and more.\n> \n> 2. The whitelist dashboard website goes live December 10th. Everyone who wishes to take part in the presale token distribution event will need to complete a registration on the whitelist dashboard. As a core requirement to be whitelisted you will need to follow our Telegram and Twitter.\n> \n> 3. The presale event date will be announced on December 10th, the day the whitelist dashboard goes live.\n> \n> \n> 2 audits will be published in December, as will the whitepaper and roadmap.\n> \n> **There will now be 2 tokens**\n> \n> As the title suggests, there will be 2 completely separate tokens both backed by SatoshiStreetBets and both automatically distributed in equal amounts to everyone who takes part:\n> \n> **SatoshiSwap** - BSC token and a serious DeFi protocol\n> \n> **SecondToken** - ETH token. Absolutely not meant to be taken seriously. This is a pure YOLO move and is just for fun. Yes it's a meme token.\n> \n> \n> The SecondToken will not actually be called \"SecondToken\". To prevent copy cats stealing our ideas (wouldn't be the first time) we will be revealing it's name closer to launch. The website, graphics, whitepaper are all completed.\n> \n> \n> **Why have we made this move?**\n> \n> - We know our market and we know our community. For every seasoned DeFi wizard, there is a shitcoin connoisseur. For every yield farming pro, there's a veteran crayon-chewing monkey who only knows the meaning of two words: buy and HODL. So with 2 tokens we cater to the more serious investors and at the same time, with a good ole fashioned meme token, we cater to people who just ape in to a token with a meme on it\n> \n> - The presale will be held on ETH and then SatoshiSwap will be automatically transferred over to BSC. This leaves behind an \"empty\" ETH token anyway, so why not use it for something fun?\n> \n> - SSB has a strong meme-coin component to it's audience base. Hell, Doge is a core part of our history. So it makes sense to tap into that.\n> \n> **Anything else?**\n> \n> - Community members who follow our Twitter will be aware that we announced ownership of a SatoshiStreetBets trademark registration. This is a completed registration, not a pending application. In the weeks ahead we will be using this to enforce our rights against bad actors that have stolen our name and have been confusing people into buying fake tokens with our community name on it. This was a time consuming but necessary process and is why we're a couple of weeks behind schedule.\n> - We've been working on marketing plans, new hires and have a couple of surprises lined up for December to keep things exciting\n> - We're re-launching our Telegram groups very soon with some new rules\n> - As of the 10th this project comes out of \"stealth mode\" and we'll be ramping everything up big time\n> \n> See you guys all on the 10th!\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nIf we buy into the presale, we get equal amounts of both coins being made by SatoshiStreetBets; SatoshiSwap, and their meme coin. \n\nI know not much information is known, but honestly, SatoshiStreetBets has a large crypto influence just by name alone. Many DCIP investors found this project through SSB. SatoshiSwap sounds like it has potential, and if we can pass the proposal before the website goes live next week, we will be in a position to invest on the ground floor. \n\nI can understand any hesitation to back a project that has little information currently revealed. The main reason I didn’t wait until next week to write the proposal is due to the potential time constraints of the voting system. If the presale is, for example, December 17, then making the proposal on December 10 would make it difficult to get in on the ground floor. \n\nSatoshiSwap is a long term investment with massive potential and a ton of social media influence.\n    ",

      "content": "# What Is Huobi Token (HT)?\nHuobi Token (HT) is the native token of the cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global. It is a decentralized digital asset based on the Ethereum blockchain and is ERC-20 compliant. HT’s value is in part reliant upon the reputation of the Huobi crypto exchange, yet other factors also have an impact.\n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of Huobi Token.\n\nHuobi Token is a relatively young project. It first launched in January 2018, hot on the heels of the release of a native token on rival crypto exchange Binance. Having its own token allows Huobi to build a flexible marketing strategy in order to attract new users and further grow its platform.\n\nOne key function of the token is to reduce commissions for trading operations on the exchange, which are usually paid from users' wallets. Yet the token has much more to offer. Using HT, users can purchase monthly VIP-status plans to receive discounts on transaction fees. Token holders have the right to vote on exchange decisions, can receive crypto rewards for seasonal buybacks, and also get early access to special events. HT holders can, at any point, trade the token for other cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhat Makes Huobi Token (HT) Unique?\nThe Huobi Token has two main functions. First, the Huobi exchange uses HT for its loyalty program that rewards members with a range of discounts. The company has also decided to use HT tokens to confer voting rights on users of the Huobi Autonomous Digital Asset Exchange (HADAX).\n\nTo fulfil these functions, Huobi has attempted to keep HT’s value reasonably stable. To curb inflation, the company allocates 20% of profits for a token buyback program.\n\nHT token holders have several advantages thanks to the token’s circulation, which include:",

However, the launch date for the Filecoin mainnet was pushed back until block 148,888, which is expected in mid-October 2020.\n\nThe project was first described back in 2014 as an incentive layer for the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), a peer-to-peer storage network. Filecoin is open protocol and backed by a blockchain that records commitments made by the network’s participants, with transactions made using FIL, the blockchain’s native currency. The blockchain is based on both proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime.\n\n## What Makes Filecoin Unique?\nFilecoin aims to store data in a decentralized manner. Unlike cloud storage companies like Amazon Web Services or Cloudflare, which are prone to the problems of centralization, Filecoin leverages its decentralized nature to protect the integrity of a data’s location, making it easily retrievable and hard to censor.\n\nDecentralized storage systems like Filecoin allow people to be their own custodians of their data, as well as makes the web more accessible to people worldwide. Since participating in the Filecoin network by mining and storing is directly related to winning more block rewards, Filecoin incentives participants to act honestly and store as much data as possible",

      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** Filecoin\n\n[A one-line description of the token]\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** Filecoin (FIL)\n\n### Functional details\n\nFilecoin (FIL) is a cryptocurrency that powers the Filecoin network, a decentralized peer-to-peer file storage network that aims to let anyone store, retrieve, and host digital information. FIL tokens are used as payment for these services and as an economic incentive to ensure files are stored reliably over time.\n\nHow it works\nFilecoin aims to provide a faster, cheaper, and more reliable distributed infrastructure for storing and retrieving data. It functions as a marketplace where developers can rent storage space — similar to a traditional cloud storage. But instead of trusting one provider with your files, they’re split up and served by a globally distributed network of computers.\n\nThe Filecoin network uses two types of miners — storage miners, who store the data, and retrieval miners, who supply the bandwidth used to retrieve the files. The communication between clients and the network happens via two types of “deals”: storage and retrieval deals. \n\nIn a storage deal, the client chooses a miner to store their data and locks up the funds necessary to pay for storage. Once the agreement is accepted, the file is transferred and stored by the miner. The miner provides continuous proof of storage to the chain in order to receive rewards from the funds locked up by a client. If they fail to provide a proof (or if proof is delayed) the miner gets penalized.\n\nIn a retrieval deal, the client makes a payment to a retrieval miner to extract the data from the network. (Retrieval miners can also be storage miners, but they don’t have to be.) These deals are executed “off-chain” — using micropayment channels to reward miners for data retrieval.\n\nKeep in mind\nAnyone with a compatible computer can start mining FIL by becoming a storage provider, making their hard-drive space available for use by the network in return for rewards. Mining configurations can range from a single desktop computer to a large-scale server farm.\n\nReleased: October 2020\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nIf Filecoin is any implication of what is to come in the future, you can expect to see more blockchain-based file sharing protocols enter the market. These systems help users secure a passive income and help to reduce the carbon footprint and waste produced by users who no longer need to purchase hardware. For these reasons, Filecoin is set to experience massive growth in the coming months.\n    ",

      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** Ankr\n\n[A one-line description of the token]\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** Ankr (ANKR)\n\n### Functional details\n\nAnkr (ANKR) is an Ethereum token that powers Ankr, a Web3 infrastructure and cross-chain staking DeFi platform that aims to make it easy and affordable for anyone to participate in blockchain ecosystems by building dapps, hosting nodes or staking. The ANKR token can be used to pay for services on the Ankr platform, such as node deployment and API services, participate in on-chain governance and also acts as an insurance for network participants.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\n1. Ankr is changing the gam\nThe cloud-computing world is relatively well-defined, and just a handful of large players dominate the market. With such an oligopolistic structure, pricing power resides mainly with cloud-computing providers. This is great for someone who owns Amazon stock, but not so great for companies or users requiring cloud infrastructure.\n\nAnkr seeks to change all that. This network takes existing underutilized hardware from cloud-computing providers and rents it out. In exchange for ANKR tokens, cloud-computing companies can maximize the use of their computing power. Wastage is a big deal in every sector, and Ankr helps minimize this issue to a great extent.\n\nThe idea of maximizing underutilized assets happens to be a very eco-friendly endeavor. Of course, not all blockchains are environmentally progressive. Much has been made about how much energy Bitcoin consumes every year. (Hint: almost as much power as the entire country of Thailand.)\n\nAnkr has found a way to create utility for end users. This blockchain network aims to do so by using what already exists, rather than adding to the energy-consumption problems plaguing this sector.\n\n2. Ankr provides a decentralized service\nBack to the decentralized piece of the equation. Decentralization is a buzz word in crypto for a reason. By cutting into the centralized market power of a few companies controlling any one sector, blockchain projects like Ankr aim to democratize pockets of the economy (and maybe the whole economy, one day). \n\nAt a high level, these goals sound idealistic and unattainable. However, the implications of Ankr's cloud-computing potential are immense.\n\nMost centralized cloud-computing services have a single or just a few points of failure if various central locations lose power. For decentralized cloud-computing players like Ankr, this risk is minimized. By using a decentralized network of providers, Ankr can offer network stability and relatively low-cost cloud-computing services to companies looking for decentralized options.\n\nAs demand for decentralized solutions increases, Ankr could see increased adoption drive the value of its network higher. Therefore, those banking on the value of ANKR tokens as representative of the value its ecosystem creates may consider ANKR an intriguing growth option.\n\nAfter all, this is a network that's looking to find novel solutions to modern problems. There's a lot investors should like about that.\n\n3. Ankr is bringing staking to a new level\nBesides the cloud-computing angle (which I think is really something), Ankr also provides unique value in how investors stake tokens. Staking refers to putting up ones tokens or locking them into a given blockchain protocol to allow validation of transactions. People who stake their tokens typically receive interest in the form of additional tokens. Accordingly, this is a passive income opportunity many crypto investors are looking to get into.\n\nHowever, Ankr provides an intriguing way for investors to stake tokens while putting up much smaller capital investments to do so. How?\n\nAnkr's StakeFi product lets investors put up as little as 0.5 Ether to earn staking rewards. Currently, 32 ETH are required to stake on Ethereum's ( ETH -1.21% ) beacon chain. This would require the equivalent of more than $125,000, at present. \n\nThe platform does this by utilizing synthetic derivatives to essentially limit the amount of initial capital investors need to put up. Similar to options in the stock market, Ankr is becoming a revolutionary force in this growing area of decentralized finance.\n\nSure, Ethereum is moving toward Ethereum 2.0, which is likely to streamline its staking process substantially. However, delays in the move to Ethereum 2.0 have persisted. For now, Ankr has an opportunity to expand its market share in this emerging DeFi category. \n    ",

      "content": "\n**Proposal to increase holding of ETH in anticipation for Ethereum 2.0 upgrades in 2022\n\nEthereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality.\n\n### Functional details\nEthereum is the original and still DOMINANT platform for issuing smart contracts that enable ICOs and decentralized applications (dApps) on a public blockchain via the Ethereum Virtual Machine and Solidity. Smart contracts and asset ownership are stored on a public blockchain which makes it possible to easily prove the veracity of contract claims.\n1. Ethereum forms the backbone of ICO launches, as projects are able to issue ERC-20 tokens to early investors which are redeemable project native tokens when the project mainnet goes live.\n2. A comparatively large hashrate makes Ethereum one of the more secure blockchains in existence.\n3. Solutions to scaling problems are being investigated, including sharding and a move to Proof of Stake consensus protocol. These changes are slated to be released under the codename Casper.\n4. Alternative sidechain solutions (like MATIC) are also being released independently from the Ethereum core solutions.\n5. Unlimited total supply. Average blocktime 10-20 seconds.\n6. Transactions are pseduo-anonymous. Funds are sent address to address, but an owner identity can eventually attributed to an address given enough data and analysis.\n7. Average Blocktime of 10-19 seconds; Total supply Unlimited; Proof of Work consensus based on ethash algorithm. \n8. Once the upgrade is complete, the network may be able to process up to 100,000 transactions per second.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n- Recommend allocating an additional 10% of available funds ($40,000)\n- The completion of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrades could be a GAME CHANGER for the network.\n- Ethereum 2.0 will make the network more scalable, more secure, and more sustainable.\n- Great upside both short-term and long-term. The Ethereum network and its smart contract capabilities can make so many industries, as well as things in our daily lives, much more efficient.\n    ",

      "content": "EverGrow Coin is the next evolution of a reflection token on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC): the first BUSD reflection token to maximize your earnings for both now & the future. Simply hold $EGC tokens and get rewarded 8% in BUSD from each transaction, automatically delivered to your wallet.\n\n \n\n8% of every buy/sell is redistributed to all holders IN BUSD.4% of every transaction is transferred into Liquidity Pool for Pancakeswap to create a stable price floorAny transaction between two wallets is taxed 14% by contracts & distributed as rewards\n\nReward to Holders\n\n8%\n\nLiquidity Fees\n\n4%\n\nBuy Back + Burn\n\n1%\n\nMarketing\n\n1%\n\nTOKEN FEATURES\n\n BUSD Reflections\n\nEarn automatic Binance pegged BUSD rewards by holding your $EverGrow Coin – 8% of every buy and sell transaction is redistributed to all token holders directly in wallets. You will receive the rewards automatically in your wallet or claim your rewards manually in our dApp Dashboard anytime. This effectively means that the native reflection of Evergrow works in parallel with Stable Yield, while exponentially increasing your holdings.\n\n Liquidity Pool\n\nOur Smart contract deposits 4% from every buy/sell transaction as $Evergrow and $BNB into a liquidity pool. Pancakeswap fixes the low liquidity problems of DEXs through the liquidity Pools. A liquidity pool always contains a pair of tokens, Instead of maintaining an order book like traditional exchanges, Every Buy/Sell trade is matched with Liquidity in the Liquidity Pool. A bigger liquidity pool will provide more stability to $EGC price. \n\n Buy-Back Wallet\n\n1% tokens are collected from every transaction and converted to BNB and are stored in Our contract. This wallet is known as BuyBack Wallet, when enabled it purchases EGC from exchanges and removes the purchased tokens permanently from circulating supply while simultaneously making green candles. More than 1.7% of tokens have been already burnt through the Buy-Back Mechanism which will keep increasing in the future.\n\n Anti-Whale Mechanism\n\nOur Anti-Whale function ensures that No sale amounts higher than 0.125% of the total supply are possible at once. Initially, it was at 0.25% but after we burned 50% Tokens of the Total Supply, we have reduced the limit per transaction by 50%. The Anti-whale won’t necessarily stop Whales from selling but having a maximum limit works as an indicator when a Whale is trying to sell their tokens and avoids price manipulations.\n\nOUR ECOSYSTEM\n\nNFT Lending\n\nThe first-ever Decentralised marketplace for easing liquidity in NFT & DeFi. Built on BSC, Our Marketplace will allow NFT Owners to easily borrow Against Their NFTs As Collateral On Fair Interest Rates without having to sell them. This means you can earn from your NFTs, instead of having them just sit there in your wallet.\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nNFT Marketplace\n\nYou can buy and sell NFTs on our platform, including any that you obtain through liquidated collateral from the NFT Lending platform. This opens a uniquely competitive market to buy NFTs below their usual market value. The marketplace will also include a minting tool that will let users create their own NFTs from images, videos & other data.\n\nNFT MARKETPLACE BETA\n\n Subscription Platform\n\nWe are developing a content subscription platform to create utility for EverGrow Coin where $EGC can be used for purchasing content, tipping & messaging content creators on our content platform. Rewards in BUSD ensure that Curators can keep earning stable income without the need to sell their $EverGrow holdings.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION PLATFORM BETA\n\n Play-to-Earn Game\n\nBuilt on BSC, our own play-to-earn game where every type of “Hero” has unique strengths & weaknesses, requiring players to mix & match accordingly. Players receive daily login rewards & earn NFTs while enjoying the gameplay. These NFT’s can be used for both:  Trading with other players on our NFT marketplaces and while holding them means Players will benefit from the rise of the in-game asset’s economy.\n\nCOMING SOON\n\n Dapp and Swap Exchange\n\nWith constant updates and community involvement, Our dApp Dashboard consists of Swap exchange with a user-friendly interface and allows to view Rewards generated in real-time. Our Ecosystem lends itself to endless potential, all made possible by our team, which is the perfect mix of brain and brawn, to make the experience a personal one for every investor.\n\nDAPP DASHBOARD BETA\n\n Staking Pools\n\nBy using an innovative set of smart contracts for Staking Pools, we will be transferring some of our liquidity to our Partnered Tokens by buying them on certain contract interactions. The purchased tokens are then distributed amongst participants of the Pool. This concept gives our token its sustainable utility in which staking X token to earn Y token makes economical and mathematical sense.\n\nCOMING SOON\n\n$EGC TOKEN STRUCTURE\n\n45%\n\nPre-Sale and Initial Liquidity\n\n50%\n\nSent to Burn Address\n\n3%\n\nFounders and Team\n\n2%\n\nAirdrop\n\nTotal Supply: 1,000,000,000,000,000 EGC\n\nTokens Burned: 517,263,781,649,006 EGC (51.72%)\n\nTotal BUSD Reward Distributed: 28376841.702 BUSD\n($28363731.601133678)\n\n[link](evergrowcoin.com)",

In just over two years of operation, the 1inch Aggregation Protocol surpassed $80 bln in overall trading volume on the Ethereum network alone.\n\nThe 1inch Liquidity Protocol is a next-generation automated market maker (AMM) that protects users from front-running attacks and offers attractive opportunities to liquidity providers.\n\nThe 1inch Limit Order Protocol facilitates the most innovative and flexible limit order swap opportunities in DeFi. The protocol’s features, such as dynamic pricing, conditional orders, and extra RFQ support, power various implementations, including stop-loss and trailing stop orders, as well as auctions.\n\nThe 1inch Wallet is a multichain mobile platform that provides an easy-to-navigate interface with secure storing, transaction, and staking capabilities. This versatile wallet was built from the ground up to streamline interacting with 1inch’s features.\n\nThe 1inch Network's governance token 1INCH is used to vote on protocol parameters under the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) model.\n\nIn August 2020, 1inch got a $2.8 million funding raise from Binance Labs, Galaxy Digital, Greenfield One, Libertus Capital, Dragonfly Capital, FTX, IOSG, LAUNCHub Ventures, and Divergence Ventures.\n\nIn December 2020, 1inch raised another $12 million in Series A funding, led by Pantera Capital, with others including ParaFi Capital, Blockchain Capital, Nima Capital, and Spartan Group. The funding round was conducted through a SAFT (simple agreement for future tokens) sale.\n\n## What Makes 1inch Network Unique?\nIn addition, to access to deepest liquidity from multiple sources on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Optimistic Ethereum, and Arbitrum, the 1inch Network offers users attractive prices and a high degree of security being the most audited project in DeFi.",

      "content": "# What Is Automata (ATA)?\nAutomata is a high-performance compute protocol that empowers Web 3.0 applications and businesses with privacy-first, high assurance, and friction-less transactions. Its mission is to provide the functionalities and infrastructure necessary to realize the vision of a seamless Web 3.0 experience. It tackles the lack of transparency in data ownership, censorship, and intrusion into personal privacy.\n\nAutomata’s products include:\n\nPrivacy-first cross-chain service plane: Automata offers privacy services for various blockchains that let users control their data.\nShielded and unbiased compute plane:the degree of privacy of computation in Automata can be stronger than in centralized web services like AWS.\nElastic and scalable control plane: it is operated by a group of staking nodes and governs interactions between participants of the protocol.\nLedger plane: Automata provides interfaces for multiple blockchains to exchange data and cooperate on the agreed set of data in an atomic and privacy-preserving manner.\n\n## What Makes Automata Unique?\nAutomata Network aims to be recognized as the go-to privacy service for DeFi and Web3 with its proposition of privacy middleware. It aims to fill a gap in the market by providing privacy-focused solutions that integrate with existing blockchain infrastructure in an intuitive, seamless manner. Its applications are built for Web3 purposes and include anonymous voting, miner extractable value (MEV) minimization, and do-not-track indexing. These allow users to transact safely, regain control of their identity, and offer better building blocks to developers with open-source code and APIs.\n\nIts anonymous voting service is called Witness and offers low-cost, off-chain voting, on-chain execution based on the results and different levels of privacy, ranging from private to public, based on the protocol’s requirements. The solution supports Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and other Substrate-based EVM-compatible chains. Each of these functions can be used as standalone or together, e.g., if a project wants to use Witness as a signaling tool without on-chain execution.\n\nConveyor is Automata’s MEV minimization solution that is chain-agnostic and works seamlessly with DEXes like Uniswap. It ingests and outputs transactions in a determined order, thereby creating a front-running-free zone that removes the chaos of transaction reordering. Features include gasless trading, anti-front running, privacy on ordering, and integration with other DEXes.",

      "content": "# What Is Rune (RUNE)?\nRune is an open-ended dark fantasy gaming universe built on Binance Smart Chain, where players can battle, join a guild, collect powerful weapons, and earn NFTs and cryptocurrency in the form of runes by playing.\n\nRunes are small and rare stones inscribed with magical glyphs needed to craft Runewords (NFTs), weapons, and armor. 33 different Runes are distributed to players over two years. Each Rune has a supply of 100,000 or less, and players can earn Runes by competing against other players, joining guilds, participating in yield farms, and community participation.\n\nThe Rune universe consists of Rune Evolution, a play-to-earn game, Rune Farm, the yield farm, Runewords (NFTs), and the Rune Infinite Arena, a player-versus-player game. The team is also developing the Rune Sanctuary, an MMORPG that will be launched in 2022. Currently, Rune is running on BSC, but the team sees the universe as blockchain-agnostic and is building a bridge to Polygon.\n\nWhat Makes Rune Unique?\nRune offers an attractive mix of blockchain gaming, NFTs, and elements from decentralized finance. Its universe is split into four different parts.\n\nRune Evolution is a play-to-earn game and was the first game built for the ecosystem. You start as a dragonling that can fly around and eat sprites to evolve into a dragon eventually. One round in the web browser-based game lasts five minutes, and players can earn crypto as a reward.\n\nRune Farm is the yield farm that attracts liquidity to the ecosystem. You can acquire runes through providing liquidity and raiding farms, i.e., yield farming. The team promises that since the supply of runes is limited, their price should find a bottom. Moreover, each rune has its specific utility, and runes can also be combined to build Runewords. Furthermore, for 2022, an online RPG built around runes is in development.\n\nRunewords (NFTs) are unique weapons and armor. Each Runeword is suitable for a specific hero class (seven different hero classes exist) or style of play. Runewords improve a hero’s capabilities in battle and offer improved farming and merchant abilities. Runewords are shared, collected, and traded in the Rune Market and players will soon be able to lend them to others. Runewords are crafted from runes.\n\nFinally, the Rune Infinite Arena is a player-versus-player, web-based 2D topdown game, where you battle your opponents for prizes. Once you defeat an opponent, they go back to the beginning while you can continue the path that goes on infinitely. The last one standing after one minute of battle claims a reward in the form of crypto or NFTs. Every 15 minutes, you enter a new arena.",

      "title": "Dusk Network: Ecosystem with Institutional Contracts",
      "content": "Dusk Network is a Layer 1 KYC Blockchain designed to comply with government regulations for financial institutions, including CBDC, and other high-trust, high-privacy KYC environments such as online gambling, health care, insurance, legal, and government. Currently the project is ready to be introduced publicly in testnet form while behind the scenes Dusk is developing business connections which will legitimize the token even further.\n\nhttps://dusk.network/pages/usecases\n\nTechnical details\nToken Name: Dusk Token - DUSK\nToken Address: ERC-20 0x940a2db1b7008b6c776d4faaca729d6d4a4aa551 BEP-20\nToken Type: Token\nToken Chain Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain\nStage: Pre-Testnet Launch, February 1, 2022\nLink to the whitepaper: https://dusk.network/uploads/dusk-whitepaperv2.pdf\nTeam doxxed: Huge team of researchers, developers, crytpographers, business leaders, and VC backing.\nProof of dox: https://dusk.network/pages/team\nSmart contract public: https://github.com/dusk-network\nAudit: Yes\nProof of Audit: Unavailable direct audit link but work is constantly audited throughout the development.\nLP Lock: VC-backed Project with multiple exchange listings, millions in funding, over 8 million raised in seed, multiple locked liquidity pools on DeFi. No direct mention of locked liquidity but check link.\nLP Lock proof: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dusk-network/markets/\nFunctional details\nDusk Token is establishing itself as a dedicated network designed to accommodate the interests of very large key players in the global economy. The team and project were formulated from successful developers and venture capitalists and has turned into over 40 individuals responsible for expanding the adoption of Dusk within corporate and government functions.\n\nSome of the use cases include SEC compliant transactions allowing large hedge funds to do exactly what DCIP is doing but for us decentralized investors. It would allow for darkpools and even actual stock exchanges to be digitized to the blockchain. No other project of its caliber is able to match the team, roadmap, feature set, and contractual developments like Dusk. Per my research it seems that there are some major catalysts coming up regarding key businesses adopting the technology.\n\nAs they near deployment of their testnet on, February 1, 2022, the price of Dusk is touching and potentially surpassing ATH of .40. With a current market cap just 10x of DCIP, at $350M, there is still plenty of room to grow towards a 3.5b market cap which would be reached within the testnet phase and prior to mainnet launch. In addition staking the coin will net us 12% per year, doubling our initial investment in 6 years. My market cap prediction is based on its comparative token Zcash which is utilized for similar Snark-esque privacy features and has a 3.5b market cap currently. Their technology is underdeveloped as compared to Dusk and they do not have government and institutional features.\n\nWith at least a definite 10x, and with institutional contracts currently favorably under way, investing $60k should become at least $600k by mainnet, and with mainnet institutional players should become similar to Polkadot, Algorand, and other top coins which would be an even further 10x for $6m plus 12% of every year we staked until liquidation. This is highly doable per upcoming contractual announcements and test launch.\n\nStrategy: Currently the coin is pumping and recovering after hitting .4 prior to red week. We are looking at further growth as we get closer to the testnet launch. The plan is to hold past testnet and continuously monitor developments regarding mainnet and the contracts they have lined up. Market conditions will be continuously monitored and we may need to expect to liquidate the position during a black swan event if we are able to unlock the stake, which is locked for 30 days at a time. However in such a case I would urge we DCA instead depending on market conditions and insider information.",

      "content": "Proposal for Mina\n\nThe world's lightest blockchain\n\nTechnical details\nToken Name: [Mina]\nLink to the whitepaper: [https://docs.minaprotocol.com/en]\nFunctional details\n\nMina is the first cryptocurrency protocol with a succinct blockchain. Current cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum store hundreds of gigabytes of data, and as time goes on, their blockchains will only increase in size. With Mina however, no matter how much the usage grows, the blockchain always stays the same size - about 22kb1 (the size of a few tweets). This means participants can quickly sync and verify the network.\n\nThis breakthrough is made possible due to zk-SNARKs - a type of succinct cryptographic proof. Each time a Mina node produces a new block, it also generates a SNARK proof verifying that the block was valid. All nodes can then store the small proof, as opposed to the entire chain. By not having to worry about block size, the Mina protocol enables a blockchain that is decentralized at scale.\n\nThere is a lot of potential here guys",

We believe that hyperinflation can, with time and persistence, be eradicated. Motivated by these beliefs and by an interest in profit for ourselves, we build and operate financial software that helps people cope with hyperinflation, and we're working on a currency to eventually make it a thing of the past.\n\nOur mission is to provide every person in the world access to stable currency, in order to avert the intense humanitarian hardship that comes from hyperinflation. We are working to rebuild financial services in societies that are traumatized and stressed by decades of wealth destruction from high inflation and ongoing currency devaluation.\n\nOur business generates revenue today by charging a spread (a type of fee) when users move money in or out of our app. Our long-term business model is based on the currency we are working on; we intend to participate, along with thousands of others, in the decentralized organization that operates that currency.\n\nToday Reserve offers the opportunity to save, spend, and receive money through the Reserve app and a stable currency, the Reserve Dollar (RSV), which is a cryptocurrency that maintains 1-to-1 parity with the US dollar.\n\nThe project is still in the startup phase, but is well beyond just an idea. We process about 15,000 transactions daily, which amount to about $1.5 million in value moved per day, for users in Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, and the US.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nI think RSR is a great opportunity and with Peter Thiel invested and Coinbase partnered maybe the next Paypal. They have a running app and already use it in Venezuela. Coinbase listing is on the way. I personally am invested since Mai/June and are already in profit. But I think this is a real GEM and is going the same way as VRA in his place.",

      "title": "THETA (x50-100) potential, most likely one of the best token out there (don't trust me, read and you will see for yourself)",
      "content": "Hello guys I'm surprised I haven't seen this token yet in this list, because going through the whole whitepaper and annoying technical details is super annoying, let me just try to ELI5 this and list the key points so you can have a better understanding of what this project really is. But first some key points:\n\n- website: https://www.thetatoken.org/\n\n- Some companies involved in Theta you may have heard of: Samsung (Investor and validator node), Sony (Investor and validator node), Google (validator node)...\n\n- https://theta.tv/ is **NOT** a platform meant to compete with Youtube as many people think (quite the opposite I'd say), but rather a live version of their ecosystem and a proof that it's working perfectly (to pitch future partners, convince skeptical investors or simply individuals like you and me)\n\n- Some partnerships: **World Poker Tour** (WPT), GFUEL\n\n- Notable advisors: Steve Chen **Co-founder of Youtube**, [Justin Kan](https://www.youtube.com/c/JustinKanTV)** Co-founder of Twitch**, Kyle Okamoto CNO at **Verizon**, Jonathan Wong Director of product at **Rakuten**\n\n- Also have a powerful NFT platform https://www.thetadrop.com/ with big partnerships ongoing (WPT, GFUEL) and incoming (Katy Perry...)\n\n- Several [patents awarded](https://medium.com/theta-network)\n\nNow let's get to the good stuff:\n\n**ELI5**: Theta is (among other things) a decentralized CDN (stands for \"content delivery network\", you know, the thing that delivers a video or a stream when you watch some content on youtube for instance). Theta allows people to share their extra bandwidth when they are not using it (and be rewarded for it). \n\n[Here is a 1mn animated video easy to understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQR7GVoV-24)\n\nBasically, Theta is a decentralized video delivery network, instead of relying on big centralized expensive servers, they will offer content delivery platforms (such as Youtube, Netflix, Twitch, Amazon Prime... you name it) the opportunity to reduce significantly their cost, **we are talking about 50%** [like it was the case for Cinedigm](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cinedigm-integrates-theta-network-launch-132500928.html), (a Netflix like platform for anime if you're not familiar with it). Instead of having big centralized servers, the network will be split among users in a decentralized way and through blockchain.\n\nHere is the quote from their [whitepaper](https://docs.thetatoken.org/docs/what-is-theta-network) \n\n> Theta Network is the leading video delivery network powered by blockchain technology. Theta allows users to simultaneously watch video content and earn token rewards for relaying video to other users who are also watching the same content. In the same vein as other sharing economy models, users opt-in to volunteering their spare bandwidth and computing resources to relay video to other users and earn token rewards for their contributions. Users can contribute to Theta Network on any PC, mobile device, or smart TV.\n\nRight now Theta is not ready yet to be implemented on big platforms such as Youtube, but imagine when it will be the case? ​Do you think it's a big bold claim that has no chance to happen?

If you're worrying about the tfuel inflation, just read pages 4 & 5 of [this](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/assets.thetatoken.org/Theta-white-paper-3-0-latest.pdf), they explain the mint/burn mechanism in a fairly simple way.\n\nThe total market cap is approximately 8 billons, this is nothing considering the current size of the project and its potential of solving big tech giants' problems. As a comparison, Cardano has 50b marketcap (10x theta).\n\n# What's in it for us\n\n**I suggest investing 50/50 of the sum you choose to invest into respectively $theta and $tfuel**, this will allow us to:\n\n- Benefit from both staking rewards, passive income along the way\n- Benefit from the rising price\n\n# Coming in the near future\n\n- December 2021: Katy Perry (140 M followers on Instagram) to launch NFT on Theta ([more info](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/30/katy-perry-launches-nfts-acquires-stake-in-theta-labs/))\n\n- February 2022: TDROP a new coin to be added in the ecosystem [more info](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/assets.thetatoken.org/Theta-Ecosystem-2022-and-TDROP-Whitepaper.pdf?v=1630330816.909))\n\n\n# Some articles\n\n- https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/05/27/google-signs-on-as-network-validator-for-blockchain-video-network-theta/\n\n- https://cointelegraph.com/news/cinedigm-integrates-theta-blockchain-tech-into-anime-streaming-channel\n\n- https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2020/05/26/this-crypto-could-blow-bitcoin-out-of-the-water-this-year-after-1000-gain-heres-why/\n\n\n## Rumor\n\nTheta and Verizon partnership (of course the fact that Kyle Okamoto is their advisor, fuels this rumor)\nhttps://twitter.com/jam_coin/status/1381263095654281217?s=21\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/theta_network/comments/n1yt18/its_long_been_rumored_that_theta_and_verizon_have/\n\n\n​",

      "title": "Star Atlas : ATLAS ( Rising metaverse project )",
      "content": "# What Is Star Atlas (ATLAS)?\nStar Atlas is a massive multiplayer online game that takes place in a virtual gaming metaverse. It is being built on Unreal Engine 5, allowing the game to feature cinema-quality, real-time environments. Star Atlas takes place in a futuristic science fiction setting in 2620, where three major factions have emerged and are competing for resources and control: humankind, a consortium of alien races and sentient androids.\n\nThe game combines different genres. It is part strategy in that you have to develop tactical plans of action on how to interact with other players and factions. Part of it is exploration, as the game features an abundance of stars for exploration and exploitation. Since players can travel to and explore these stars independently through first-person flight, it is in part a flight simulation. Lastly, players can mine resources and derive revenue streams from doing so, making it also a role-playing game.\n\nAfter choosing a faction, players initially start in faction security zones without combat to explore basic gameplay. Later, they can venture out to medium-tier security and open gameplay where combat is possible.\n\nFundamental gameplay pillars are: * Deep space exploration; * Combat; * Building space stations and ships; * Choosing in-game professions to mine resources; * Forging alliances to scale control of resources.\n\nAssets acquired in the game can later be exchanged for real-world currency.\n\nStar Atlas was announced in January 2021 and is being built on the Solana blockchain. It is backed by several Solana-based projects, such as Serum, a decentralized exchange, and FTX, a centralized exchange. Although Star Atlas doesn’t have a detailed release schedule, its metaverse tokens are scheduled to begin trading in August 2021.\n\nWhat Makes Star Atlas Unique?\nStar Atlas aims to deliver an immersive metaverse gaming experience that encompasses several genres and combines a cinema-quality gaming experience with an ability to earn virtual assets that can be exchanged for real-life currency. It plans to supersede its competitors by outperforming them in several areas. So far, no blockchain game combines as many different gameplay possibilities as Star Atlas. While some games offer the option to earn via staking, or battle other players for virtual assets, or explore its virtual world and form alliances, no game does all of the above simultaneously.\n\nPlayers can use the ATLAS token as in-game currency to purchase assets, but they will also be able to buy NFTs on the NFT marketplace that will function as ships and other in-game equipment. At the same time, players will be able to choose a profession, such as CEO, broker, bounty hunter, pirate and a large number of others to fulfill roles on spaceships. Spaceships will also have the option to combine resources and compete not only individually, but also collectively. These so-called decentralized autonomous corporations will be able to construct entire space cities with accompanying micro-economies. The POLIS token, the second token of the Star Atlas universe, will serve as a governance token in these space cities, as well as for governance decisions regarding the game.\n\nStar Atlas also plans to offer an NFT marketplace and an NFT release schedule to distribute and trade in-game assets. Moreover, by being integrated with the Serum DEX, ATLAS token holders will have the option to provide liquidity, or sell and buy their token holdings.",

More categories will be added in the future as the market matures.\n* Total market cap must be over $30m.\n* Protocol must have at least 3 months history of operation and its token must have at least 3 months of price and liquidity history.\n* Token must have reasonable and consistent DEX liquidity on Ethereum.\n* An independent security audit should have been performed on the protocol and results reviewed by the product methodologist. In the case that no audit has been performed, the methodologist will apply subjective judgement of the protocol based on assessment of the criteria above and communications with the team.\n* In the event of a security issue the methodologist will work with the project team to understand the issue and any effects to $MVI holdings. The team is expected to provide users of the protocol with a reliable solution and adequate documentation to ensure transparency about the incident.\n* Tokens will not be staked at the launch of the index. This is subject to change as liquidity increases and it becomes possible to safely generate yield through staking.\nIndex Weight Calculation\nThe $MVI uses a combination of root market cap and liquidity weighting to arrive at the final index weights. We believe that liquidity is an important consideration in this space and should be considered when determining portfolio allocation.\n\nTW = 75%*RMCW + 25% * LW\nwhere,\nTW – token weight in the $MVI\nRMCW – square root of market cap weighted allocation\nLW – liquidity weighted allocation\n\nIndex Maintenance\nThe index is maintained monthly in two phases:\n* Determination phase: During the determination phase, the tokens being added and deleted from the index calculation are determined during the final week of the month and published before monthly rebalancing.\n* Rebalancing phase: Following publication of the determination phase outcome, the index composition will change to the new weights during the first week of the following month.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nMetaverse is the next big thing! Best way to enter it in a balanced way to have maximum profit with minimal risk. \n    ",

But to get to mass adoption, chain technology and the ecosystem connecting it to the business world needed to be reimagined from the ground up. Our founders built a proprietary chain architecture and created the tools to make blockchain work for business – at speed, scale, and energy efficiency previously thought unachievable.\n\n\nKadena builds technology that makes blockchain work for everyone. Our ecosystem powers real-world use cases for enterprises and entrepreneurs, providing the security of Bitcoin, virtually free gas (transaction fees), unparalleled throughput, as well as Pact – the most secure smart contract language with built-in bug detection.\n\nKadena is the only platform offering a complete decentralized infrastructure for builders. Combining a revolutionary chain architecture with the tools needed for widespread adoption, your teams get the full capabilities of blockchain with the ability to go from concept to launch in days vs. months by not having to build from scratch.\n\nWhitepaper:\nhttps://docs.kadena.io/kadena/overview-of-kadena\n\n    ",

      "title": "Stake Solana SOL",
      "content": "I have a suggestion to the community regarding Solana, to buy Solana in 50,000 USD and keep staking it for 1 year.\nIt is a new blockchain built up from the ground.\n\n\nWhat is solana?\n\nSolana is an open source project implementing a new, high-performance, permissionless blockchain. \nThe Solana Foundation is based in Geneva, Switzerland and maintains the open source project.\n\nWhy Solana?\n\nSolana’s goal is to maximize security and scalability. \nIf we take its incredibly low transaction fees of $0.00025 per transaction, the network could potentially generate 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) at full capacity. \nMoreover, according to its white paper, its developers believe it could facilitate 710,000 transactions per second (TPS). \nThough it recently had a network failure after reaching 400,000 TPS, it’s clear that it can easily handle an impressive 100,000 TPS.\n\nThis makes Solana unique amongst other cryptocurrencies. Though Solana has quite a large market cap. in such a short time, \nwhich raises the question of risks regarding its price changes in the future, I believe it still has great potential to grow, \nand in the next years the whole crypto world will probably increase its market capitalization and the popular cryptocurrencies will reach new ATHs.\n\nThe point of staking SOL\nBy staking your SOL tokens, you help secure the network and earn rewards while doing so.\nMy suggeestion is to buy Solana, and we should keep staking it for at least the end of next year (2022).\nWith staking we can reduce the risk of overall losses in case of smaller price drops. In the next year, if we can see an overall steady growth for Solana, \nand the whole cryopto ecosystem, we can re-evaluate our investment regarding Solana. Keep staking or selling for profits.\n\nHow can we buy and stake Solana?\n\nYou can stake by delegating your tokens to validators who process transactions and run the network.\nWe can do it with wallets that are supporting staking SOL. The wallet provides steps to create a stake account and do the delegation.\nSupported Wallets#\n\nStaking operations are supported by the following wallet solutions:\nPhantom.app in conjunction with a seed phrase or a Ledger Nano. Check out Phantom's guide to staking for details.\n\nSolFlare.com in conjunction with a keystore file or a Ledger Nano. Check out our guide to using SolFlare for details.\n\nSolana command line tools can perform all stake operations in conjunction with a CLI-generated keypair file wallet, a paper wallet, or with a connected Ledger Nano. Staking commands using the Solana Command Line Tools.\n\nExodus wallet. They make the process very simple, but you cannot choose a validator: they assign you to their partner validator. See their FAQ for details.\n\nBinance and FTX exchanges. Note that you cannot choose a validator with these services: they assign you to their partner validator.\n \nResources:\nhttps://docs.solana.com/staking",

      "title": "Chromia (CHR)",
      "content": "# What is Chromia?\nChromia is an open source public blockchain conceived of by Swedish company Chromaway AB. The Chroma token (CHR) was launched in May of 2019. The technology behind the Chromia blockchain is adapted from an earlier technology called ‘Postchain’, a solution provided by Chromaway AB for enterprise clients.\n\nHow does Chromia work?\nChromia is a standalone Layer-1 blockchain and EVM compatible Layer-2 enhancement for Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum. It is designed to enhance existing dApps and allow for the creation of next-generation dApps by providing scalability, improved data handling, and customizable fee structures.\n\nThe blockchain uses a unique architecture called relational blockchain, as well as a custom programming language called Rell. Rell is designed to code and function very similarly to SQL, allowing developers to leverage the security and immutability of blockchain while storing and handling data with the efficiency of a relational database.\n\nEach dApp running on Chromia operates on its own sidechain which is rooted in the main blockchain. This allows each application to scale more efficiently and gives each application developer the freedom to choose from a variety of fee structures. For example, one application may require users to pay transaction fees in CHR (similar to how Ethereum or Bitcoin work), while another application could stake enough CHR to reserve computational power and allow their users to make unlimited transactions without paying any fees at all.\n\n## What applications have been built on Chromia?\nChromia already has a wide variety of applications building upon their blockchain, using their chain as a decentralized storage layer, and using their Layer-2 enhancements. These applications range from DeFi options trading platform Hedget, to open world farming game My Neighbor Alice, to government land registry initiative LAC PropertyChain.\n\nOne of the latest features in development is a new NFT standard called Chromia Originals, which will operate both as a native standard on Chromia’s chain as well as an enhancement layer for existing ERC-721 and BEP-721 tokens. Work on these Layer-2 enhancements are being developed in cooperation with My Neighbor Alice.\n\n### Who is behind Chromia?\nChromia’s core team consists of industry veterans Or Perelman, Henrik Hjelte and Alex Mizrahi. All three have deep roots in the crypto space, going back to the early days of Bitcoin and Ethereum. For example, Alex published several early academic papers on Proof of Stake consensus and was also one of the key figures behind Colored Coins, one of the first projects to develop the idea of ‘tokens’ that would later be brought to prominence by Ethereum.\n\nIn summary, Chromia is a Layer-1 and Layer-2 blockchain solution under active development, with the goal of delivering enhanced features and data handling and storage capabilities to decentralized applications.",

      "title": "Establish BTFD Investment Pool",
      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** BTFD Investment ool\n\nI propose that we establish a $100,000 initial pool (“BTFD Pool”) that would be invested in large-cap crypto assets with favorable Relative Strength Indexes (“RSI”).   The largest crypto assets by market cap provide for a safer risk profile than most crypto assets (including most of the assets currently under consideration for investment).  A significant investment in a basket of these assets would provide a lower risk “anchor” for our portfolio.  Despite the lower risk profile, these assets have the potential for substantial price appreciation as the bull market continues.  Further, by targeting assets with a lower RSI – representing an “oversold” condition -  we may be able to provide for enhanced returns.  \n\nThe BTFD pool would work as follows:\n\n•\tThe top to crypto assets by market cap, excluding: stable coins; Dogecoin; Shiba Inu; and any assets DCIP is not able to currently invest in, would be identified (“Adjusted Top 10”).\n\n•\tThe 14-day RSI for each asset would be identified.  RSI is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of an asset.  Lower RSI readings indicate oversold situations and it is expected that such assets would outperform in the near-term.\n\n•\tThe initial BTFD investment pool amount would be 25% invested in each of the four Adjusted Top 10 assets that have the lowest RSI levels.\n\n•\tEvery two weeks, the portfolio would be rebalanced based on the Adjusted Top 10 and their RSI levels at that time, with 25% of the pool at that time invested in each of the four identified assets.  We would essentially be perpetually \"buying the dip\".\n\n•\tAt each sixth rebalance (“Distribution Date”), the amount of growth in the total pool following the last Distribution Date (after distribution on that date) would be determined (“Quarterly Profit”). The Quarterly Profit would be allocated as follows:\n\no\t20% would be reinvested in the BTFD pool.\no\t80% would be distributed based on the standard DCIP investment profit distribution methodology.\n\n•\tAs of today, the Adjusted Top 10 and their current RSI levels are as follows:\n\no\tBitcoin – 38.17\no\tEthereum – 42.93\no\tBNB – 51.13\no\tSolana – 42.02\no\tCardano – 29.6\no\tXRP – 34.54\no\tPolkadot – 35.57\no\tAVAX – 41.11\no\tCRO – 62.81\no\tLUNA – 53.35\n\nNote:  If DCIP is not able to invest in any of these dur to current investment restrictions, the next largest crypto asset(s) by market cap would be added.\n\n•\tIf determined today, the initial BTFD pool would be as follows assuming approval of a $100,000 initial pool:\n\no\tBitcoin - $25,000\no\tCardano - $25,000\no\tXRP - $25,000\no\tPolkadot - $25,000\n\nThe proposed pool should provide for a superior risk adjusted return and would further provide for regular rebalances and income distributions without the need for additional votes.  \n\n",

Because the future is being built today and hardware limitations should not be what keeps you from being a part of the new digital renaissance. Render puts the power of GPU rendering at your fingertips, at a fraction of the cost and speed of in-house rendering.\nThe Render Network is designed to connect users looking to perform render jobs with people who have idle GPUs to process the renders. Owners would connect their GPUs to the Render Network in order to receive and complete rendering jobs using OctaneRender. Users would send RNDR to the individual performing the render work and OTOY would receive a small percentage of RNDR for facilitating the transaction and running the Render Network.\n\nOnce they’ve registered their idle GPUs on the Render Network, these GPU owners become “Node Operators” and are able to earn RNDR Tokens. They do this by accepting jobs from users in need of rendering work, known as “Creators”, who send their files to the Render Network, where they are assigned to Operators. Render receives a small percentage of the RNDR paid out in order to maintain the network and facilitate the transaction.\"\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nDelegating render jobs is something the creative industry will absolutely love to use. Instead of having dedicated machines, users can create their content and delegate huge chuncks of work to decentralized machines. This allows to scale huge amounts of work without the upfront investment, plus allows idle GPU users to make the most  bang form their hardware. Since Ethereum is switching from PoW to PoS, many miners will scout the blockchain for interesting projects where they can leverage their hardware, and I beleive this is one project that will certainly stood out. \n\n## Extra knowledge\n\nAdvisors of the project include J.J. Abrams (yes, that JJ Abrams) & Brendan Eich (Brave Browser) and Manuel Araoz (Decentraland).\n",

      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** [Gala]\n\n[Gaming token whit nft sell, 1M+ users a month!!]\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** [Gala]\n- **Token Address:** [0x15D4c048F83bd7e37d49eA4C83a07267Ec4203dA, 0x7ddee176f665cd201f93eede625770e2fd911990]\n- **Token Type:** [Token, NFT, gaming]\n- **Token Chain** [Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum]\n\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** [Link]\n- **Team doxxed:** [Yes]\n\n\nWhat is Gala Games (GALA)?\nGala Games aims to revolutionize the gaming industry by putting players back in control of their games. Gala Games' mission is to \"make blockchain games that you really want to play\". The project aims to change that players can spend hundreds of dollars on in-game assets and spend hours playing the game, while it can be over at the click of a button. In addition, they want to reintroduce creative thinking into games, by giving players control over the games and in-game assets, using blockchain technology.\n\nPlayers can own non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and influence game governance in the Gala Games ecosystem. The Founder's Nodes voting mechanism allows players to influence which games Gala develops and which games should receive funding. In addition to purchasing NFTs for specific games, Gala Games uses its own utility token called GALA. So far, Gala Games has released one playable game Town Star and an NFT collectible series VOX. More games will be released in the future, such as fantasy RPG game, sci-fi strategy game and tower defense game.\n\nSince its launch in 2019, Gala Games has had 1.3 million monthly active users and 26,000 NFTs have been sold, the most expensive of which is worth $3 million.\n\nWho are the founders of Gala Games?\nEric Schiermeyer is the founder of Gala Games. He was the co-founder of Zynga, a popular social and mobile games company. Under Schiermeyer's leadership, Zynga launched the popular games Poker, Mafia Wars and Farmville. Schiermeyer is a leader in gaming. He launched Gala Games in July 2019 to create a blockchain-based gaming network and give players more control over their games.\n\nThe Gala Games team consists of 60 employees.\n\nWhat makes Gala Games unique?\nGala Games is not one game, but offers a complete range of different blockchain games, with fun at the forefront and blockchain in the background. Town Star, the only playable game to date, is a city-building simulation game that can be played in a browser. Players control a city, which is similar to SimCity gameplay, but in Town Star they own the city.\n\nVOX are Gala Games' collectible NFT avatars. Each VOX is unique and some VOXs are rarer than others. At launch, 8,888 VOX were distributed for an average price of 0.0888 ETH or about $280 at the time. Although VOX is inspired by Town Stars, it is more than just an avatar of NFT. Owners can pin GALA and earn VOXcoin by playing with their VOX avatars in the future. Owners of VOX get their own FBX file, which they can use to animate their avatars or even print them in 3D in the future.\n\nThere are also other games in development. Fortified is a player-versus-player tower defense game set in an amazing medieval world. Players will compete to build the best tower defense strategies.\n\nMirandus is a fantasy role-playing game (RPG) set in a gigantic world controlled by five player kings. Players can own in-game assets and claim parts of the in-game landscape.\n\nEchoes of Empire is a sci-fi strategy game set in a galaxy at war. Players can own their own spaceships and control parts of the galaxy.\n\nSpider Tank Project is an online battle arena multiplayer game where players can choose a \"spider tank\" to fight against other players. The game is free to play, but contains in-game monetization mechanisms. The release is planned for the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nCommunity feedback is an important part of developing these games. Gala Games is constantly involving the community on Discord in the development phase. This allows players to influence the direction and design of the games.\n\n\n    ",

SuperRare emerged from its 1.0 version, where the core team hand-picked and approved artists to mint their works on a shared smart contract as SuperRare NFTs. SuperRare 2.0 changed that by introducing web-scale curation, independently running storefronts on the platform, and sovereign minting contracts for the artists to mint, promote, and sell their works directly to collectors.\n\nBy embarking on this path of progressive decentralization, SuperRare shifted ownership and governance of the network to the community. SuperRare 2.0 is a DAO, a decentralized organization that oversees key platform parameters, allocates funds from the Community Treasury, and votes on proposed improvements to the network and protocol.\n",

The 1inch Aggregation Protocol incorporates the Pathfinder algorithm for finding the best paths across over 60+ liquidity sources on Ethereum, 30+ liquidity sources on Binance Smart Chain, 30+ liquidity sources on Polygon, Optimistic Ethereum, and Arbitrum. In just over two years of operation, the 1inch Aggregation Protocol surpassed $80 bln in overall trading volume on the Ethereum network alone.\n\nThe 1inch Liquidity Protocol is a next-generation automated market maker (AMM) that protects users from front-running attacks and offers attractive opportunities to liquidity providers.\n\nThe 1inch Limit Order Protocol facilitates the most innovative and flexible limit order swap opportunities in DeFi. The protocol’s features, such as dynamic pricing, conditional orders, and extra RFQ support, power various implementations, including stop-loss and trailing stop orders, as well as auctions.\n\nThe 1inch Wallet is a multichain mobile platform that provides an easy-to-navigate interface with secure storing, transaction, and staking capabilities. This versatile wallet was built from the ground up to streamline interacting with 1inch’s features.\n\nThe 1inch Network's governance token 1INCH is used to vote on protocol parameters under the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) model.\n\nIn August 2020, 1inch got a $2.8 million funding raise from Binance Labs, Galaxy Digital, Greenfield One, Libertus Capital, Dragonfly Capital, FTX, IOSG, LAUNCHub Ventures, and Divergence Ventures.\n\nIn December 2020, 1inch raised another $12 million in Series A funding, led by Pantera Capital, with others including ParaFi Capital, Blockchain Capital, Nima Capital, and Spartan Group. The funding round was conducted through a SAFT (simple agreement for future tokens) sale.\n",

It aims to offer an antidote to “slow, expensive, unscalable and environmentally harmful” proof-of-work protocols, like those used by Bitcoin, by offering an ecosystem of connected blockchains.\n\nThe project’s other goals include making blockchain technology less complex and difficult for developers thanks to a modular framework that demystifies decentralized apps. Last but not least, an Interblockchain Communication protocol makes it easier for blockchain networks to communicate with each other — preventing fragmentation in the industry.\n\nCosmos’ origins can be dated back to 2014, when Tendermint, a core contributor to the network, was founded. In 2016, a white paper for Cosmos was published — and a token sale was held the following year. ATOM tokens are earned through a hybrid proof-of-stake algorithm, and they help to keep the Cosmos Hub, the project’s flagship blockchain, secure. This cryptocurrency also has a role in the network’s governance.\n",

      "title": "Open new Position on Loopring (LRC)",
      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** Loopring (LRC)\n\nLoopring is a  zk-rollup protocol. This Ethereum Layer-2 protocol allows applications to operate on the Ethereum Level 1 infrastructure (and benefit from it decentralization, security, etc.) but with much faster speeds and minimal gas cost.  LRC is widely viewed as the future of Ethereum and has even been endorsed by Vitalik Buterin (co-founder of Ethereum).  It is believed to be the cure for the excessive gas costs that we all struggle with.\n\nLRC was proposed previously (not by me) but did not get sufficient support.  I feel strongly about the near and longer term prospects for LRC and wanted to submit a new proposal with additional explanation and investment options to hopefully generate the support of the community.  \n\nIt is believed that Loopring is about to announce a partnership with Gamestop whereby the upcoming Gamestop NFT marketplace will be built on Loopring. There is compelling support for this expectation that can be found on various Loopring and Gamestop forumns.  Given the scale of the expected Gamestop marketplace, this partnership is expected to create a significant demand for the LRC token in addition to bringing exponentially increased recognition.  Further, the prospective partnership has started to attract Gamestop investors to LRC (with far more crossover investment expected when the partnership is announced).  Gamestop investors (from r/WallStreetBets and other forums) have been in the news extensively over the past year for driving the meme stock craze that resulted in explosive growth of the Gamestop and AMC stocks.  Having this community supporting the LRC token will create the type of pump generally associated with meme tokens that can result in rapid and dramatic price increases.  However, unlike meme stocks, the underlying technology and upcoming Gamestop partnership should result in continued further growth over the long-term. This is a rare combination of meme token hype and technological superiority that should lead to a \"pump\" without the \"dump\".  \n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** Loopring (LRC\n- **Token Address:** 0xBBbbCA6A901c926F240b89EacB641d8Aec7AEafD\n- **Token Type:** Token\n- **Token Chain** Ethereum\n- **Stage:** Launched\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** https://loopring.org/resources/en_whitepaper.pdf\n- **Team doxxed:** Yes\n- **Proof of dox:** https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?currentCompany=%5B%2213453869%22%5D&origin=COMPANY_PAGE_CANNED_SEARCH&sid=i~T\n- **Smart contract public:** Yes\n- **Audit:** Yes\n- **Proof of Audit:** https://loopring.org/resources/loopring1.0_audit.pdf\n- **LP Lock:** N/A\n\n\n### Functional details\n\nLoopring is a zkRollup layer2. It allows for high-throughput, low-cost trading and payment on Ethereum.  zkRollup is a type of layer 2 scaling solution on Ethereum, allowing much higher throughput and much lower costs, without sacrificing security. It does this by moving all of the heavy lifting (computations) off-chain, keeping the rules enforced and security intact by using validity proofs: cryptographic proofs attesting to what happened off-chain. Because Ethereum verifies these proofs, and stores enough data to tell exactly which off-chain account owns what, zkRollups inherit the same non-custodial security as Ethereum, but can run much faster.\n\nLoopring Exchange is a non-custodial Ethereum exchange built on Loopring layer 2. It is an orderbook-based and AMM-based exchange that replicates the high-performance, low-cost trading experience of centralized exchanges. Users can trade speedily & cheaply (without worrying about Ethereum congestion or gas fees) while maintaining self-custody control of their assets. The exchange is built atop the open source Loopring protocol.\nLoopring Exchange is more than a DEX, and also acts as a payment app. Users can send ETH and ERC20 token transfers to any Ethereum address instantly, cheaply, and securely on L2.\n\nThe Loopring token (LRC) is the native token of the Loopring protocol, and can be used to pay fees on Loopring L2.  Demand for the token should grow significantly along with usage of the Loopring protocol.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nLRC token is poised to benefit from a \"meme token\" type price explosion in the near term while growing long-term due to its superior technology and growth in usage.  It has a path to become a top 10 cryptocurrency by market share.  Investing now, prior to the expected Gamestop announcement, has the potential for excellent short and longer term returns.\n    ",

By combining the powers of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the Sandbox creates a decentralized platform for a thriving gaming community.\n\nAccording to the official whitepaper, the Sandbox platform’s main mission is to introduce blockchain technology in mainstream gaming successfully. The platform focuses on facilitating a creative “play-to-earn” model, which allows users to be both creators and gamers simultaneously. The Sandbox employs the powers of blockchain technology by introducing the SAND utility token, which facilitates transactions on the platform.\n",

      "content": "# What Is Huobi Token (HT)?\nHuobi Token (HT) is the native token of the cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global. It is a decentralized digital asset based on the Ethereum blockchain and is ERC-20 compliant. HT’s value is in part reliant upon the reputation of the Huobi crypto exchange, yet other factors also have an impact.\n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of Huobi Token.\n\nHuobi Token is a relatively young project. It first launched in January 2018, hot on the heels of the release of a native token on rival crypto exchange Binance. Having its own token allows Huobi to build a flexible marketing strategy in order to attract new users and further grow its platform.\n\nOne key function of the token is to reduce commissions for trading operations on the exchange, which are usually paid from users' wallets. Yet the token has much more to offer. Using HT, users can purchase monthly VIP-status plans to receive discounts on transaction fees. Token holders have the right to vote on exchange decisions, can receive crypto rewards for seasonal buybacks, and also get early access to special events. HT holders can, at any point, trade the token for other cryptocurrencies.\n",

This is to be done by making the CRO an intermediary currency which will allow for the conversion of cryptocurrencies to their fiat counterparts at much reduced cost. \n\nCrypto.com Chain is billed as the “next generation” platform which should bring together the merchants and cryptocurrency users on a public blockchain capable of supporting instant, cost-efficient and secure transactions among them. \n\nCrypto.com Chain is supposed to offer high scalability and fast payment processing. The Chain is designed as the payment network which aims to offer immediate payment confirmations while also supporting scaling in line with an increasing number of transactions. With the help of its decentralized protocol for transaction processing, the target confirmation time on the Crypto.com Chain is set at being less than one second, while the platform promises to support 50,000 transactions per second.\n\nCrypto.com Chain wants to get rid of the traditional fiat payment structures which are not friendly to innovative payment methods such as cryptocurrencies. \n\nThe Chain will offer systematic integration with supported cryptocurrencies and remove the transaction fees for the merchants. The platform has already introduced its dedicated software development kit (SDK) for the merchants interested in integrating this soluton.\n\nCrypto.com Chain sees decentralization as the shortcut to making crypto payments a mainstream option. Eventually, the Crypto.com Chain should become a network of a broader range of related cryptocurrency projects. These systems will be customized as alternatives to existing payment systems by being less complex to set up and cheaper to operate. At the same time, they will be offered support going beyond their native blockchain and being more accessible for the use by the newcomers in the crypto industry.\n\nCrypto.com Chain will support the expansion of the Crypto.com’s line of MCO Visa payment cards. Considering that the cards in question feature no annual fees and support international purchases with more favorable interbank fees, the Crypto.com team saw their Chain platform as their natural ally in the quest of bringing a larger number of users to the global crypto ecosystem. By offering native support for cryptos and incentives for the participants, the Crypto.com Chain aims to make the targeting of new customers a faster and cheaper process in the world of crypto payments.\n\nCRO has already partnered with a number of large organizations inluding UFC, Formula 1, Serie A, Twitch Rivals, and more. In december Staples Center will be renamed Crypto.com Arena.\n\nPartners can be seen here: https://crypto.com/partners\n\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nPersonally I feel this is a very solid investment and garunteed success over the coming year. I am very excited about Crypto.com's partnerships with sports orgnaizations, and huge advertising campaigns. I would recomend allocating $10,000 in this project. ",

Rather than coordinating networks of devices and data through centralized servers, Jasmy aims to decentralize the process via edge computing and storing data on IPFS, a decentralized storage network. JASMY can be used to transfer tokens between devices and payment for network services.\n\nJasmy - the Japanese Bitcoin \n\nJapan has one of the world's most progressive regulatory climates for digital currencies. It's one of the world's biggest markets for Bitcoin and recognizes digital currencies as legal property under the Payment Services Act (PSA).\n\nBasically, Japan takes the development of the coins very seriously. And it makes sense, since Japan is one of the most popular crypto countries in the world.\n\nCrypto in Japan falls under the category \"crypto assets\" under law. That means it can be used as a means of payment transactions and exchanged with fiat currencies (Japanese Yen, USD).\n\nAnd that brings us to one of the things going for Jasmy Coin. It's a certified Japanese cryptocurrency. You can check it off as legitimate.\n\nMore than that, though, Jasmy leadership may have what it takes to push this coin to new heights.\n\n\nJasmy's CEO, Kunitake Ando, is the former President and COO of Sony Corp. (NYSE: SONY). The list of high-ranking positions he's held within Sony goes on. Jasmy's President, COO, and Deputy President are former high-ranking Sony employees as well.\n\nAndo's vision of Jasmy is one for the people. He believes the Internet of Things (IoT)-powered fourth industrial revolution is the perfect opportunity to help people retake control of their personal information.\n\n ",

      "content": "**Proposal for:** MOVE\n\nMOVE is the utility and fee paying token for the MarketMove app which aims to be a full feature solution for DYOR, trading charts and DEX trading on the Binance Smart Chain and (coming) the Ethereum chain.\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** MarketMove (MOVE)\n- **Token Address:** 0x231cF6F78620e42Fe00D0c5C3088b427F355d01c\n- **Token Type:** Token\n- **Token Chain** Binance Smart Chain\n- **Stage:** Launched\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** https://docs.google.com/document/d/1amabajPf9fFT2Hb2NEmFN3OKXyeTuxwldYTN1zu7_dE/view\n- **Team doxxed:** Yes\n- **Proof of dox:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_upA1vNYJA\n- **Smart contract public:** Yes\n- **Audit:** Yes\n- **Proof of Audit:** https://solidity.finance/audits/MarketMove/\n- **LP Lock:** Yes 10 years\n- **LP Lock proof:** https://dxsale.app/app/v3/defipresale?saleID=144&chain=BSC\n\n### Functional details\n\nMarketMove is building an app that will act as a fully functional DEX platform, offering advanced AI-based auditing functions to help investigate a token's contract, liquidity pools, holder lists, etc., to help the user spot scams and put his money into quality tokens.\n\nThey have launched initial versions of the audit tool (https://audit.marketmove.ai) and professional trading charts (https://app.marketmove.ai). Even just this early version of the audit tool revealed the Squid token as a scam days before people started getting pulled into it: had the full MarketMove platform been available to them at the time it could have saved them a lot of money. Coming very soon (within a few weeks) is an expansion of the audit tool to check more than just the token's contract code, a total UI overhaul with more professional branding, and within a few more weeks a non-custodial non-KYC limit trade function towards pancakeswap trading pairs.\n\nThis is our own token's audit score on MarketMove: https://audit.marketmove.ai/contract-audit/0x308fc5cdd559be5cb62b08a26a4699bbef4a888f\n\nIt shows our buy and sell tax, a few easy to grasp overall scores, and a series of potential concerns you want to look into before buying the token (click on each for an explanation). In our case it's warning you to look into how trustworthy the team is since they have the power to make certain tax and reward changes at any time.\n\nMarketMove is looking to compete against such established actors as DEXtools and poocoin. It will do everything that they do, and much more in addition including:\n\n- AI assisted automated audit covering all aspects of the token\n- Professional trading charts\n- Swap function towards pancake swap trading pairs (and uniswap in future)\n- Portfolio overview of the wallet you're connected with\n- Non-custodial, non-KYC limit trade (limit buy, limit sell, stop loss) towards pancakeswap (and uniswap in future) trading pairs\n- NFT charts have been teased for next year\n\nWhile a price list has not been set yet, the MOVE token will be used to pay fees in the platform's novel trading solutions (e.g. limit trades) and the app will have premium features that can be unlocked by holding a certain number of MOVE tokens in your wallet.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nI think this token has the potential to increase tenfold within the next couple of months as the limit trade functions come online and are shown to work. This will attract the attention of whales who will be fomoing into a solution they have only been dreaming of having for years, and we should fomo in before they do. The token will also bridge to Ethereum in the near future (December having been promised) which again will attract even more whales.\n\nIn the longer term MarketMove has an excellent shot at becoming THE preferred trading platform towards pancakeswap and uniswap and a year or two from now another tenfold increase is not unrealistic.\n\nThis is a long hold with near future big gains to be expected.\n",

Current cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum store hundreds of gigabytes of data, and as time goes on, their blockchains will only increase in size. With Mina however, no matter how much the usage grows, the blockchain always stays the same size - about 22kb1 (the size of a few tweets). This means participants can quickly sync and verify the network.\n\nThis breakthrough is made possible due to zk-SNARKs - a type of succinct cryptographic proof. Each time a Mina node produces a new block, it also generates a SNARK proof verifying that the block was valid. All nodes can then store the small proof, as opposed to the entire chain. By not having to worry about block size, the Mina protocol enables a blockchain that is decentralized at scale.\n\nFund allocation and personal opinion\n\nRight now it has a market cap on 1,339,500,000 dollars but that can get higher with this technologi\n    ",

      "title": "Adjust DCIP Investment Liquidation Waterfall to Better Reward Long-Term Holders",
      "content": "Currently, distributions from liquidated investments would be shared with previous holders who have already sold their interest in DCIP.  By adjusting the methodology for payment of distributions to reduce a holder’s share to the extent they have sold some or all of their investment in DCIP, we believe the community would benefit as the new methodology would further enhance the incentive to hold DCIP long-term,  and would strengthen the alignment of interests among holders.\n\nThe current waterfall for profits upon liquidation of an investment provides for a 2.5% portion to be paid to the holder that proposed the investment ( the “Incentive Fee”), a 10% portion to be retained in the Community Investment Wallet for future investments, and the remainder distributed to holders (the “Holder Distribution”).  The Holder Distribution is paid to all holders at the time the subject investment was made.  Importantly, under the current structure, this distribution would be paid to holders at the time the investment was made even if they no longer hold DCIP at the time of liquidation of the investment.  As a result, full distributions would be paid to individuals who previously sold some or all of their DCIP investment.\n\nWe believe that the current methodology for allocating the Holder Distribution could be improved.  If Holder Distributions were paid only to eligible individuals who remain holders at the time of liquidation of an investment (to the extent of their holdings following any sales), this could create a more powerful incentive to hold DCIP for a longer time period, and appropriately reward long-term holders.  Similarly, we believe that the Incentive Fee should only be paid to an individual to the extent they are still a holder at the time of liquidation of the subject investment.  Paying distributions to individuals who have already sold their investment could skew the alignment of interests in certain circumstances.   \n\nWe would propose that if the holder that would otherwise be entitled to the Incentive Fee is not a holder as of the liquidation date for the subject investment, that holder would no longer be entitled to the fee (the “Forfeited Fee”).\n\nWe would further propose to revise the methodology for allocating the Holder Distribution as follows:\n\n•\tOnly holders as of the liquidation date for an investment would receive a distribution with respect to that investment.\n•\tThe number of tokens used to calculate a holder’s pro-rata share of the Holder Distribution would be the lowest number of tokens such holder \n     held between the investment date and liquidation date for the subject investment. \n•\tAny Forfeited Fee would be added to the Holder Distribution with and allocated to holders in this same manner.\n \nWe believe that the proposed enhancement to the distribution methodology would benefit the community by better rewarding long-term investment in DCIP, enhancing the incentives for continued investment for all holders.   \n",

Presale tokens were locked in 5-month, 12-month and 30-month vesting contracts which will lead to a slow trickle of tokens into the market over the next few years. The token launched on Uniswap at $0.25 and at time of writing is hovering around $0.5.\n\nMore token details here: https://insights.triall.io/triall-pre-sale-details-token-allocation/\n\nThe token started as ERC-20 on Ethereum and has since expanded to also have a BEP-20 token on BSC. There is a bridge between the networks for arbitrage etc. and this arrangement does not affect the token supply. The project is blockchain agnostic and will support whatever blockchain makes sense, both for its SaaS offerings and for the TRL token. The token may therefore become available on further blockchains in the future although no such concrete plans are known at the moment.\n\nTriall has been providing generous staking solutions for early holders of the token and have promised further staking pools going forward.\n\nThere is a 2.5% burn mechanism built into the use of the token in actual clinical trial projects. This will have a deflationary effect on the token over time.\n\nThe project team has held AMAs on telegram in the past and intend to continue doing so in future. Their tg is https://t.me/triallcommunity\n\nThe token is available on uniswap; pancakeswap; and the Liquid CEX, e.g. https://app.liquid.com/exchange/TRLUSDT\n\nFurther CEXes are planned in the future.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nThis project is a poster child for industry adoption of crypto. It is run by a highly respected team of industry professionals in one of the most heavily regulated industries in the world. It is aiming to make inroads into the $200b/year clinical trials industry and capturing even a fraction of that will lead to huge gains to the token. This is a safe and stable investment for our fund, an easy hold for at least a 2-3 year period. From its current $0.5 value, even with the full 173M supply after vestment it is clear that a mere $86M token market cap is going to grow fast with even just moderate success in a $200b/year market.\n\nAlso, we'll be helping cure cancer even if very indirectly.\n\nWe should buy this token with a view to a long hold, and have a proactive policy of putting it into the staking pools that will open up over time.\n\nWe should buy it from whichever is the cheapest at the time, whether uniswap or pancakeswap.\n",

It is also the world’s 1st adaptive blockchain. That means that it is able to update itself and evolve and manage its network in real time. This is made possible by an open and permissionless autonomous governance system that is embedded within its protocols called the Network Nervous System (or NNS).\nThe Internet Computer blockchain, and the special node machines that host its network, run under the control of the NNS. However, absolutely anyone in the world can submit proposals to the NNS, and when they are adopted, they are immediately executed, completely automatically, allowing the network to adapt and evolve in real time. The NNS can perform tasks such as upgrading node machines to update the protocol or apply security fixes, tweaking economic parameters, or forming new subnet blockchains to increase network capacity, at any time. Because the NNS runs within the Internet Computer’s protocols, it is able to make changes without interrupting the network’s operation or breaking security.\nThe Network Nervous System works by allowing users to stake ICP governance tokens to create voting neurons. Anyone can create a neuron, and we expect tens of thousands of neurons will be created post-Genesis, which together shall exert the will of the community, mediated through algorithms. Neurons are like accounts where notice of withdrawals must be given, where the length of the notice period is a configuration known as the “dissolve delay.” The voting power of neurons, and their relative claim to voting rewards, is proportional to the quantity of staked ICP, the length of the configured dissolve delay, and their “age.” Neurons can be made to vote manually, or automatically, by following other neurons in a form of liquid democracy.\nNeuron holders are placed in a cryptoeconomic game, where they are incentivized to vote to adopt and reject proposals, or to configure neuron follows that cause them to vote automatically in a desirable way, according to what is most likely to drive the value of the Internet Computer network over the long term.\n\nhttps://dfinity.org/\n\n\nIn this bullrun there will be rapid price explosion for INTERNET COMPUTER (ITC\n",

      "content": "Unimoon is a Decentralized Media(DeMe) network built to create more self-sovereignty for individual users and the energy they commit to interaction. The energy, popularity, reach and engagement of media objects is represented through the use of the Unimoon coin. When a piece of media is created and published the efficacy and absorption radius of that media is measured by its Social Activity Coefficient(SAC). The Unimoon platform will dynamically calculate the SAC value of an individual piece of media based upon that media object's engagement curve over the course of its lifetime receiving Unimoon coin rewards. Users who interact with – view, amplify, modify, create – a media object will receive Unimoon tokens based on the accrued SAC value. Unimoon holders are incentivized to unlock utility of the token through various mechanisms that allow tokens to be utilized within the Unimoon network and ecosystem. The goal of Unimoon token mechanics is to incentivize healthy growth of content and services while creating more transparency for the exchange of human energy to nearly instant realized value distinguished by a user’s uploaded media object’s engagement curve on the network through a decentralized social media platform.\n\nLitePaper: https://docs.unimoon.io/Unimoon%20Litepaper%20-%20v1.0.3.pdf?view\n\nWebsite: https://unimoon.io/new-social-blockchain\n",

It describes itself as a fully encompassing finance on the blockchain. The COTI Group launched in March of 2017, while the Staking Platform Launched on Jan. 1, 2020.\n\nIt is an ecosystem that is designed specifically to meet all of the challenges associated with traditional finance, including latency, fees, global inclusion and risks. This is done through the introduction of the DAG-based protocol as well as infrastructure that is completely scalable, private, inclusive and fast.\n\nThe ecosystem has DAG-based blockchain, proof-of-trust consensus algorithm, multiDAG, GTS (Global Trust System), a universal payment solution and a payment gateway.\n\n## **What Makes COTI Unique?**\nThe thing that makes COTI unique is COTI’s platform.\n\nThis platform enables companies to effortlessly create advanced fintech products and save time, data and money. COTI pay can process every kind of payment type, both in terms of online payments as well as offline ones. This includes crypto and stablecoins, as well as credit cards and even native coins. It has built-in financing to boot, with interest earned on deposits and loans. This also connects with the white label payment network.\n\nTraditional payment systems simply cost both merchants and customers amounts up to billions of dollars on an annual basis. As such, the white label payment network is a global payment network for users and merchants that make transactions freely throughout a digital wallet, coin and much more.\n\nCOTI is also the world’s first platform that is optimized for the creation of coins that are stable in price. As such, a user has the ability to issue their own stable coin and regain full control over both their money and their data.\n",

Loom attempts to be the ultimate platform that allows smart contract developers to create applications without the need to switch to another programming language.\n\nAs such, they can easily integrate their applications with the outside world.\n\nThe Loom Network runs on Plasma, which is a scaling solution that allows for faster transactions throughout the network.\n",

      "content": "# **What Is Power Ledger (POWR)?**\nPower Ledger (POWR) is a blockchain-based platform released in May 2016 with the goal of disrupting the global energy industry by enabling local areas to sell and distribute solar power to their neighbors without the help of middlemen. It is a technology company that uses blockchain to facilitate energy and environmental commodity trading.\n\nIt is based in Australia and encourages dependable and affordable electricity. Power Ledger runs on the Ethereum network as a peer-to-peer energy exchange platform.\n\nIn 2015, 30 countries had reached grid parity, meaning that the price of solar-generated energy was equal to or less than the cost of local retail electricity. Power Ledger combines solar power and blockchain to offer energy solutions that are cheaper and more sustainable than traditional energy alternatives.\n\nPower Ledger operates on two blockchain layers and uses two coins, the Power Ledger (POWR) token and Sparkz, which offer different functions. The platform itself uses the public Ethereum blockchain and a private consortium blockchain known as Ecochain.\n\nThe POWR token allows application hosts and participants to use the platform itself. When a host does not have the right amount of POWR, they cannot access the platform. POWR is traded through the Ethereum Smart Bond exchange.\n",

Due to this, Alien Worlds also has a decentralized finance (DeFi) element to the game, as players advance by staking TLM and using TLM to vote in Planet Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).\n\nPlay-to-earn (P2E) NFT games have seen an exponential rise in popularity and value this year. Alien Worlds allow the players, called “explorers” to earn monetary rewards through gameplay or participation in Planet DAOs. By mining in Alien Worlds, a user is rewarded with the native, in-game currency — Trilium (TLM) or NFT packs. Players can stake TLM to boost their rewards or battle with other users for NFTs.\n\nTo date, Alien Worlds has established a fair amount of its roadmap, having TLM on Binance launchpad and farming period of TLM on Binance Launchpool. A large portion of game developments have been forged as well. Moving forward, Alien Worlds aims to automate the claiming process of daily allocation to landowners in the game. Artifacts NFTs are soon to be released, and future plans include NFT interoperability.\n",

      "content": "# **What Is Ocean Protocol (OCEAN)?**\nOcean Protocol is a blockchain-based ecosystem that allows individuals and businesses to easily unlock the value of their data and monetize it through the use of ERC-20 based datatokens.\n\nThrough Ocean Protocol, publishers can monetize their data while preserving privacy and control, whereas consumers can now access datasets that were previously unavailable or difficult to find. These datasets can be discovered on the Ocean Market, where they can be purchased and later consumed or sold.\n\nOn Ocean Protocol, each data service is represented by a unique datatoken, which is used to wrap a dataset or compute-to-data service — this essentially allows third-parties to perform operations on the data without it ever leaving the secure enclave of the publisher.\n\nOCEAN is a utility token that is used for community governance and staking on data, in addition to buying and selling data as the basic unit of exchange on the Ocean Market. The price of these datatokens is set by an OCEAN-datatoken AMM pool, which adjusts the price of the datatoken as it is bought and sold based on supply and demand.\n",

      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** [BULL and ETHBULL]\n\n[BULL and ETHBULL allow us to earn returns 3X that of directly investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum.]\n\n### Technical details\n\nThese are reputable Leveraged tokens provided by FTX. Details may be found at the following links:  https://ftx.com/en/tokens/BULL; and https://ftx.com/intl/tokens/ETHBULL.  BULL is an ERC20 token which seeks a return that corresponds to 3 times the daily return of Bitcoin. ETHBULL is an ERC20 token which seeks a return that corresponds to 3 times the daily return of Ethereum.\n\n### Functional details\n\nLeveraged tokens are ERC20 assets that provide for leveraged exposure to cryptocurrency markets, without the complications and related risk of directly managing a leveraged position.   The assets use leverage (debt) to achieve gains (or losses) several times higher than investing in the related currency directly.  For example, a 3X Leveraged BTC token (BULL) would generate 3x the returns compared to a direct investment in BTC.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum are the most established coins in the crypto space.  They are also the safest investments in the space as it is nearly certain that their values will continue to rise significantly over the medium and long term, as the pace of their adoption continues to accelerate.  Further, most of the reputable cryptocurrency analysts project significant upside in the short term as data from previous market cycles would indicate that the growth in both coins will accelerate as we approach this later stage of the bull market.  Many of these analysts project bitcoin growth of over 300% in coming months based on multiple models.  Many predict that Ethereum will exceed even the Bitcoin growth as it has in the last several years.\n\nBased on the status of the current investment proposals, it appears that we will make significant investments in both Bitcoin and Ethereum.  I believe this to be a wise investment decision.  I also believe that we can enhance the returns in our investments in both currencies by also purchasing the FTX Leveraged Tokens Bull and ETHBULL.\n\nI propose that we make a $50,000 investment allocated half to BULL (3X Leveraged BTC token) and half to ETHBULL (3X Leveraged Ethereum token).  When viewed collectively with the substantial investments we are making in BTC and ETH directly, this would result in overall positions that benefit from the safety (compared to other cryptocurrency investments) provided by Bitcoin and Ethereum, while providing for a blended return substantially in excess of returns generated by investing in the coins directly. If there is not sufficient liquidity to make these investments when approved, I propose that the investments would be made from the next funds added to the investment wallet. \n\n    ",

      "content": "\nElrond EGLD\nCurrent price: 339$ Circulating Supply: 19,759,657.39 \nElrond is a distributed transactional computation protocol which relies on a sharded state architecture and a secure Proof of Stake consensus mechanism.\n\n### Technical details\n\n- Elrond (EGLD)\n- You can buy on the Binance Network: 0xbf7c81fff98bbe61b40ed186e4afd6ddd01337fe\n   Elrond have their own blockchain and can be bought via their APP: Maia\n- Coin Type: Coin, Blockchain, stacking.\n- Coin Chain: Smartchain, Elrond Chain, etc.\n- Mainnet live, project started in 2018\n- https://docs.elrond.com/welcome/welcome-to-elrond/\n- WHITEPAPER: https://elrond.com/assets/files/elrond-whitepaper.pdf\n- Doxxed team https://elrond.com/#developers\n- Smart contract is public\n- Auddited \n\n\n### Functional details\n\nElrond is a high-throughput public blockchain aimed at providing security, efficiency, scalability and interoperability, beyond the current state-of-the-art. The two most important features that set Elrond apart are Adaptive State Sharding and the Secure Proof of Stake consensus mechanism.\n\nElrond is a complete redesign of blockchain architecture with the aim to achieve global scalability and near instant transaction speed. Elrond's architecture rests on the following key innovations:\n\nAdaptive State Sharding on all levels: transaction, data and network. The dynamically adaptive sharding mechanism will perform shard merging and shard splitting while taking into consideration both the number of available validator nodes and also the network usage.\nSecure Proof of Stake Consensus, completed in just two communication steps, using modified Boneh–Lynn–Shacham (\"BLS\") multi-signatures among the validators of the consensus group. Moreover, nodes inside the shard are randomly selected for the consensus group with no possibility of knowing the group's composition more than one round in advance.\nHigh resiliency to malicious attacks due to periodical node reshuffling across shards. Every epoch, up to 1/3 of the nodes in every shard are reshuffled to other shards in order to prevent collusion.\nSecure randomness source with BLS signing, which makes it non-biasable and unpredictable.\nThe Arwen WASM VM, an exceptionally fast virtual machine for executing smart contracts written in any programming language that can compile to WebAssembly.\nSmart contracts on a sharded state architecture, with balanced load on shards. This is a requirement for a high-throughput blockchain platform. Balancing smart contracts across shards allows Elrond to run multiple SCs in parallel, while the cross-shard calls are handled by an asynchronous cross-shard execution process.\nFast finality for cross-shard transactions in mere seconds. Having a very high TPS is required for a high throughput blockchain solution, but TPS is only half the picture: fast finality for cross-shard transactions is of crucial importance. Most existing state-of-the-art blockchain architectures refuse to mention this aspect, but from a user standpoint it is extremely important. Fast cross-shard finality is naturally handled by Elrond at the protocol level, using a dispatching algorithm and a routing protocol.\n\nPossibility to creat APP on Elrond Network in 15 minutes.\nPartnership with more than 20 companies. (Crypto.com, Binance, Stake Capital, N Grave, CERE Network, Coinmerce, Nash , Shift, etc)\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nThis project is longterm oriented and investing into such project, developing connections with Elrond, the ability of having our DCIP project on their network, possibility of stacking our coin, and being opened to hundred of thousands new big investors who could see the utility of our project is an extraordinary idea.\nTill this day, Elrond has a price of 339$ and it started around 5$ back in 2018-2019. With a supply not far of the one of Bitcoins and the Architecture of their blockchain, my predictions are that Elrond could reach 3000-4000$ by 2022-2023. \n\nFor more functionality of their project visit their Website, since there are so many projects they are working on. Feel free to take a look.\n(https://elrond.com/)\n[link](https://elrond.com)",

      "content": "# **What Is Gala Games (GALA)?**\nGala Games aims to take the gaming industry in a different direction by giving players back control over their games. Gala Games mission is to make “blockchain games you’ll actually want to play.” The project wants to change the fact that players can spend hundreds of dollars on in-game assets, and countless hours spent playing the game, which could be taken away from them with the click of a button. It plans to reintroduce creative thinking into games by giving players control of the games and in-game assets with the help of blockchain technology.\n\nPlayers can own non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and influence the governance of games within the Gala Games ecosystem. The Founder’s Nodes voting mechanism allows players to influence what games Gala should develop and what games should get funding. Besides buying NFTs for specific games, Gala Games also utilizes GALA – its own utility token. So far, Gala Games has released one playable game – Town Star and an NFT collectible series – VOX. It plans to release more games in the future, such as a fantasy RPG game, a sci-fi strategy game and a tower defense game.\n\nSince launching in 2019, Gala Games has grown to 1.3 million monthly active users, and 26,000 NFTs have been sold, with the most expensive piece valued at $3 million.\n\n\n",

      "content": "# **What Is Axie Infinity (AXS)?**\nAxie Infinity is a blockchain-based trading and battling game that is partially owned and operated by its players.\n\nTo learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of Axie Infinity.\n\nInspired by popular games like Pokémon and Tamagotchi, Axie Infinity allows players to collect, breed, raise, battle and trade token-based creatures known as Axies.\n\nThese Axies can take various forms, and there are more than 500 different body parts available, including aquatic, beast, bird, bug, plant and reptile parts. Parts from each type class come in four different rarity scales: common, rare, ultra rare and legendary — and Axies can have any combination of body parts, making them highly variable and often rare and unique.\n\nEach Axie is a non-fungible token (NFT) with different attributes and strengths and can be entered into 3v3 battles, with the winning team earning more experience (exp) points that are used to level up an Axie's stats or evolve their body parts. These Axies can be bred together to produce new and unique offspring, which can be used or sold on the Axie marketplace.\n\nThe Axie Infinity ecosystem also has its own unique governance token, known as Axie Infinity Shards (AXS). These are used to participate in key governance votes and will give holders a say in how funds in the Axie Community Treasury are spent.\n\n\n",

Enjin's flagship offering is the Enjin Network, a social gaming platform through which users can create websites and clans, chat, and host virtual item stores.\n\nEnjin allows game developers to tokenize in-game items on the Ethereum blockchain. It uses Enjin Coin, an ERC-20 token, to back the digital assets issued using its platform, meaning that items can be bought, sold and traded with real-world value.\n\nEnjin Coin was first announced in July 2017, and it launched on the Ethereum mainnet in June 2018.\n\nEnjin Coin (ENJ) is a digital store of value used to back the value of blockchain assets like non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Every asset minted with the Enjin Platform contains ENJ, a minting resource which is locked inside NFTs and removed from circulation. Minting blockchain assets with ENJ provides a variety of benefits to creators and users:\n\nInfuses them with a reserve value\nEnsures their transparency and scarcity\nGives them instance liquidity\nProvides utility in games and apps\nAnti-inflationary\nEnjin's \"melting\" functionality allows users to destroy their blockchain assets at any time to retrieve the ENJ value from within.\nThe Enjin blockchain ecosystem aims to offer software products that make it easy for everyone to develop, trade, monetize, and market with blockchain.\n\nFounded in 2009, Enjin has roots in the gaming industry, with the company’s first product, a gaming community platform called the Enjin Network, growing to 20 million users over the course of a decade.\n\nIn 2017 following an ICO, Enjin established itself as a leading blockchain ecosystem developer, building a suite of software products that enable anyone to easily mint, manage, trade, distribute, and integrate blockchain assets.\n\nEnjin’s co-founder Witek Radomski wrote the code for one of the first ever non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and is also the co-author of the ERC-1155 Ethereum token standard.\n\nBuilt on top of an on-chain infrastructure, the Enjin ecosystem enables game developers and businesses of all sizes to use tokenized digital assets as part of their acquisition, retention, engagement, and monetization strategies. The Enjin ecosystem is fueled by Enjin Coin (ENJ), a cryptocurrency used to back the value of blockchain assets.\n\n\n",

It have proof-of-work (PoW_ networks that solving the problems of Ethereum and become replacement of bitcoin. It have long term potential and great to invest right now.\n```\n\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** Kadena (KDA)\n- **Token Address:** [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kadena]\n- **Token Type:** [smart contract, protocol, ecosystem]\n- **Token website** [http://kadena.io/]\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** [https://docs.kadena.io/whitepapers/overview]\n\n\n### Functional details\n\nKadena is launching one of the world’s first true scalable blockchains ready for applications.\n\nKadena’s public blockchain is a braided, high-throughput Proof of Work system that runs Chainweb, a protocol that delivers security and throughput. The Kadena network will unite public applications, private blockchains, and other interoperable chains in one place, driving traffic to the high-bandwidth computer at the heart of the Kadena public chain.\n\nKadena enterprise software is in use today by major companies in finance, healthcare, and insurance while allowing builders with a vision to skip straight from idea to product. With the launch of Kadena’s public chain, this system will support blockchain application development, from private to public and everywhere in between.\n\nKadena is solving the problems of Ethereum and is delivering features today that other blockchains have only begun to include on their roadmaps, including Formal Verification, interoperability, scalability, and more.\n\nKadena is live and ready for immediate deployment of production blockchain applications.\n\nThe Kadena token (KDA) is a digital currency that is used to pay for computation on the Kadena public chain. Similar to ETH on Ethereum, KDA on Kadena is the token in which miners are compensated for mining blocks on the network and is the transaction fee that users pay in order to have their transactions included in a block.\n\nApplications processing volumes of transactions on the high-throughput, scalable Kadena network will execute their smart contract code using the native Kadena token. As more applications join or interoperate with the Kadena network, the number of smart contracts executed grows, as does the utility of the Kadena token.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\n**3 reasons why Kadena (KDA) price went on a 500% parabolic frenzy**\n\n**1- Kadena joins the DeFi brigade**\nKDA recently launched a wrapped version of its token called wKDA, which operates on the Ethereum network and allows it to interact with all Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.\n\n**2- NFT projects launch on Kadena**\nAnother reason for the increased momentum seen in KDA was the addition of NFT capabilities to the network as a way to showcase the ability of smart contracts to transact high-demand items while keeping fees low.\n\n**3- New exchange listings and staking opportunities**\nKDA has also received support from cryptocurrency exchanges, including a new listing on Crypto.com, and CoinMetro now offers KDA staking.\n    \nThis indicates KDA holders are excited about yield opportunities, and it could bode well for its integration into DeFi. Wrapped KDA might also contribute to reducing the circulating supply of KDA, which ideally would be additional buy pressure on the tokens’ price.",

      "content": "\nProposal for:Hydra [HYDRA]\nStake Hydra to earn high APR on investment\n\nHydra is an open-source Proof-of-Stake blockchain with a unique set of economic features \n\n### Technical details ###\nHydra is a permissionless, open-source, proof-of-stake blockchain built on some of top of the most proven open-source technologies - QTUM, Bitcoin, Ethereum and BlackCoin’s PoV v3, designed by Pavel Vasin. \n\nToken Name: Hydra [HYDRA]\nToken Address:\n0x1a2a600afb96de37b501284d42107201bf9a70d5\nToken Type: \nToken Chain: BEP20\nStage:Launched\nLink to the whitepaper:\n[link](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-MLNXvXNFPLXIrp6TqdS%2F-MW1ULCewLs45JzqgVeK%2F-MLSpR6K3sC7vdXEAKL6%2FHydra%20Chain%20Whitepaper.pdf?alt=media&token=e231e190-1883-4c65-a5dc-41a8b28a5831)\ndoxxed: Yes\nProof of dox:[link](https://hydrachain.org/the-team/)\nSmart contract public:Yes\nAudit: Yes\n\n### Functional details\n\n of Hydra:\n🔥 100% Burn of all Transaction Fees\n💎 50% Royalty on Gas for Smart Contract Creators \n📌 Fixed Coin Transaction Fees of $0.20 \n📌 Fixed Token Transaction Fees of $0.50 \n💰 20% Minimum APR Staking \n📈 Up to 540 TPS Elastic Capacity\n🔏 EVM Compatible Smart Contract Platform\n⚙️ Wallet-Level Scalability \n🗳 Unique Decentralized Governance Protocol\n⚖️ 18.5M Starting Supply with unique approach for handling the deflation tipping point. \n\nThe philosophy behind Hydra is to implement critical economic features while utilizing proven technology for data transmission. In addition to a number of unique economic features, it has a fixed inflation in order to stimulate stakers and market participants to contribute to its true decentralized architecture.\nHydra runs in the UTXO accounting model while supporting EVM as an additional layer. \nHydra solves one of the most difficult challenges with blockchains - How and When to switch from an inflation state to a deflation thanks to its unique ability to burn up to 100% of transaction fees on protocol level, in parallel to the inflationary driven block rewards. This stimulates infrastructure and community growth while offering protection against price degradation due to its ability to convert transaction gas into a permanent supply cut.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion ##\nHydra's ATH was $55 now it has been sitting somewhere between $12 -$14 average. At time of proposal currently at $13.6. The ATL was 10 months ago at $1.39.\nPerhaps the most attractive aspect of this investment is that DCIP Community could simply buy, stake and Hodl while earning high APR between 64% to 101%. Wth a chance that Hydra will increase progressivley in value. Take a look at the Staking Calculator for yourself before you cast your vote to determine if you feel this is a wise investment as I do. \nStaking Calculator 🧮  [link](https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/hydra/)",

      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** [CHZ]\n\nChiliz provides sports & entertainment entities with blockchain-based tools to help them engage & monetize their audiences.\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** [Chiliz (CHZ)]\n- **Token Address:** [0x3506424f91fd33084466f402d5d97f05f8e3b4af]\n- **Token Type:** [Token]\n- **Token Chain** [Ethereum]\n- **Stage:** [Launched]\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** https://www.chiliz.com/docs/CHZ_whitepaper.pdf\n- **Team doxxed:** [Yes]\n- **Proof of dox:** https://www.chiliz.com/en/our-team/\n- **Smart contract public:** [Yes]\n- **Audit:** [Yes]\n- **Proof of Audit:** https://www.certik.org/projects/chiliz (90 security score, rank #24)\n\n### Functional details\n\nThe Socios.com fan engagement platform is built from the ground up on the Chiliz blockchain infrastructure & uses $CHZ as it’s exclusive on-platform currency. Socios.com allows fans to purchase branded Fan Tokens from some of the biggest and most renowned sports teams in the world.\n\nFan Tokens bought on Socios.com allow users to influence their teams via popular vote and become eligible for engagement-based team rewards and recognition. All Fan Tokens are minted using the Chiliz blockchain & all on-platform voting is executed as a series of smart contracts which run through the Chiliz blockchain.\n\nChiliz is also expanding into NFTs, recently partnering with AC Milan to mint the first in-game NFTs that reflect snapshots from live matches. 100 limited edition NFTs were minted and dropped to holders of the ACM fan token during the match. \n\n### Current Partner Organizations (At Time of Proposal)\n\n\n| Sport/League | # of Partners | Notable Partners\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n|   Football        |    44       |  FC Barcelona, Juventus, PSG, Man City |\n|     NBA      |    24       | Bucks, Lakers, Nets, Golden State |\n|   E-Sports        |    6       | OG   |\n|   Cricket        |    4       | Royal Challengers |\n|   Motorsports        |    3       | Aston Martin Cognizant   |\n|   Fighting        |    2        | UFC |\n|   NFL        |    1      | Patriots |\n|   Tennis        |    1      | Davis Cup |\n\n\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nSocios.com has proven the success of the fan token model over the past couple years, and the team is now looking to expand across the globe and continue to grow their list of partners. The American app is currently under development, with partnerships already in place with the NBA and the Patriots, setting up for a big launch in the U.S. with these fan tokens already available. \n\nAdditionally, Chiliz has pledged to invest $60 million to launch the first new set of platform experiences on the Chiliz blockchain outside of Socios.com and sports, looking to expand into the music, film, and live events space as well. \n\nWith all of this in mind, Chiliz has a ton of growth potential and is a great long term investment option for DCIP.\n\n",

      "title": "Dusk Network: Corporate, Government, Gambling, Healthcare, and more! ",
      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** Dusk Token \n\nDusk Network is a Level 0 KYC Blockchain designed to comply with government regulations for financial institutions, including CBDC, and other high-trust, high-privacy KYC environments such as online gambling, health care, insurance, legal, and government. Currently the project is ready to be introduced publicly in testnet form while behind the scenes Dusk is developing business connections which will legitimize the token even further.  \n\nhttps://dusk.network/pages/usecases\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** Dusk Token - DUSK\n- **Token Address:** ERC-20 0x940a2db1b7008b6c776d4faaca729d6d4a4aa551 BEP-20\n- **Token Type:** Token \n- **Token Chain** Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain\n- **Stage:** Pre-Testnet Launch, February 1, 2022\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** https://dusk.network/uploads/dusk-whitepaperv2.pdf\n- **Team doxxed:** Huge team of researchers, developers, crytpographers, business leaders, and VC backing.\n- **Proof of dox:** https://dusk.network/pages/team\n- **Smart contract public:** https://github.com/dusk-network\n- **Audit:** Yes\n- **Proof of Audit:** Unavailable direct audit link but work is constantly audited throughout the development.\n- **LP Lock:** VC-backed Project with multiple exchange listings, millions in funding, over 8 million raised in seed, multiple locked liquidity pools on DeFi. No direct mention of locked liquidity but check link.\n- **LP Lock proof:** https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dusk-network/markets/\n\n### Functional details\n\nDusk Token is establishing itself as a dedicated network designed to accommodate the interests of very large key players in the global economy. The team and project were formulated from successful developers and venture capitalists and has turned into over 40 individuals responsible for expanding the adoption of Dusk within corporate and government functions.\n \nSome of the use cases include SEC compliant transactions allowing large hedge funds to do exactly what DCIP is doing but for us decentralized investors. It would allow for darkpools and even actual stock exchanges to be digitized to the blockchain. No other project of its caliber is able to match the team, roadmap, feature set, and contractual developments like Dusk. Per my research it seems that there are some major catalysts coming up regarding key businesses adopting the technology.\n\nAs they near deployment of their testnet on, February 1, 2022, the price of Dusk is touching and potentially surpassing ATH of .40. With a current market cap just 10x of DCIP, at $350M, there is still plenty of room to grow towards a 3.5b market cap which would be reached within the testnet phase and prior to mainnet launch. In addition staking the coin will net us 12% per year, doubling our initial investment in 6 years. My market cap prediction is based on its comparative token Zcash which is utilized for similar Snark-esque privacy features and has a 3.5b market cap currently. Their technology is underdeveloped as compared to Dusk and they do not have government and institutional features.\n\nWith at least a definite 10x, and with institutional contracts currently favorably under way, investing $60k should become at least $600k by mainnet, and with mainnet institutional players should become similar to Polkadot, Algorand, and other top coins which would be an even further 10x for $6m plus 12% of every year we staked until liquidation. This is highly doable per upcoming contractual announcements and test launch. \n\nStrategy: Currently the coin is pumping and recovering after hitting .4 prior to red week. We are looking at further growth as we get closer to the testnet launch. The plan is to hold past testnet and continuously monitor developments regarding mainnet and the contracts they have lined up. Market conditions will be continuously monitored and we may need to expect to liquidate the position during a black swan event if we are able to unlock the stake, which is locked for 30 days at a time. However in such a case I would urge we DCA instead depending on market conditions and insider information.\n",

Basically it the plan is to allow easier adopting and remove the middle man of having to purchase a coin in order to buy tokens and other crypto. They also are doing the regular fanfare as well (Wallet, good dividends, etc)\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nThis is a high-risk, high reward situation. Still very early (under 10k users), but established enough to be fairly safe. They are starting to gain some serious traction and I think a small bag would be worth while holding. 15k would make us a big player and hopefully turn into a nice return in the next few weeks/months.\n    ",

In the last year alone, Cardano has gone from $.12 to an ATH of $3.40, with current price floating around $1.80. \n\nIt’s still early enough in Cardano’s development to see significant returns on a long-term investment, and it hedges our bets by backing a cryptocurrency outside of the Ethereum or Binance chains",

      "title": "Open a position on Ethereum (ETH)",
      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** [ETH]\n\nEthereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality.\n\n\n\n### Functional details\n\nThe Ethereum white paper was released by Vitalik Buterin in late 2013 after proposals to include a scripting language to enable decentralized applications (dApps) on the Bitcoin blockchain failed to gain traction. Ether is the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain and is used to compensate nodes for performing computations in the Turing-complete instruction set of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). These instructions form the backbone of smart contracts and digital asset ownership which are recorded and issued upon the Ethereum blockchain. The development and governance of Ethereum relies upon the use of open-source Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) whereby developers and the wider public can submit proposals to improve or change standards to the Ethereum platform. \n\nUtility Ethereum is the original and still dominant platform for issuing smart contracts that enable ICOs and decentralized applications (dApps) on a public blockchain via the Ethereum Virtual Machine and Solidity. Smart contracts and asset ownership are stored on a public blockchain which makes it possible to easily prove the veracity of contract claims. \n\nEthereum forms the backbone of ICO launches, as projects are able to issue ERC-20 tokens to early investors which are redeemable project native tokens when the project mainnet goes live. \n\n- A comparatively large hashrate makes Ethereum one of the more secure blockchains in existence. \n- Solutions to scaling problems are being investigated, including sharding and a move to Proof of Stake consensus protocol. These changes are slated to be released under the codename Casper. \n- Alternative sidechain solutions (like MATIC) are also being released independently from the Ethereum core solutions. \n- Unlimited total supply. Average blocktime 10-20 seconds. \n- Transactions are pseduo-anonymous. Funds are sent address to address, but an owner identity can eventually attributed to an address given enough data and analysis. \n- Average Blocktime of 10-19 seconds; Total supply Unlimited; Proof of Work consensus based on ethash algorithm. \n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nIt's the second biggest crypto with huge upside potential, I think we should be in on it.\n    ",

As such, Status allows you to interact with a network at any time, from anywhere. It was originally released in June in 2017.\n\nIt is a light client Ethereum node, and has the ability to give you access to all Ethereum decentralized applications (otherwise known as DApps) from an app that is installed on your mobile phone or tablet. This means that users can send encrypted messages as well as access decentralized applications, including a cryptocurrency wallet.\n\n\nWhat Makes Status Unique?\nStatus, or SNT, is an open-source messaging platform as well as a mobile interface. This interface allows its users to interact with DApps running on the ETH blockchain. In return, users get over 2,000 DApps, can send and receive encrypted messages on a peer-to-peer basis and can make payments as well as utilize smart contracts.\n\nThe network itself uses Status Network Tokens, or SNT, that are the native currency on the platform. The goal of Status is to make the adoption of Ethereum DApps quicker and more efficient.\n\nThere is also a users-as-stakeholders network that allows the behavior of the network and its software to become aligned with the interests of a specific user. The contributors conduct research on a crypto economic model, and peer-to-peer technologies can ensure a healthy Status Network.\n\n",

      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** XRP ($XRP) - A play on Lawsuit Win and Long Term Investment\n\nThe XRP ledge is an open-source product created by Ripple. It was created to solve a major point of friction in international payments, pre-funding of nostro/vostro accounts. Banks can use XRP to source liquidity in real time. Payment providers can also use it to expand reach into new markets, provide faster payments settlements, and lower foreign exchange costs.\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **XRP:** XRP + $XRP\n- **Token Address:** 0x1d2f0da169ceb9fc7b3144628db156f3f6c60dbe\n- **Token Type:** Token\n- **Token Chain** XRP Ledger\n- **Stage:** Launched\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** https://ripple.com/files/ripple_consensus_whitepaper.pdf\n\n- **Website**: https://xrpl.org/\n\n### Functional details\n\nThe state of the global payments is weirdly behind. The technology for easy global payments already exists. So why is the global payments industry so far behind? The financial institutions collectively making trillions of dollars on payment fees aren't racing to innovate a system that puts money in their pockets. Instead taking a \"burn it to the ground\" approach that many cryptocurrency idealogists have adopted, Ripple aims to work with the current financial world. Ripple was launched in 2012 and is already producing revenue with over 100 financial institutions on its blockchain network.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nAs most of you already know, there is a pending lawsuit that XRP faces with the SEC. It is my firm belief that it's just a matter of time that XRP wins the lawsuit and the true value of XRP will be realized. Why not participate in the expected gains by a disrupting technology that already has real life use case? It is an investment worth making for an outsized Reward. Thnk you.\n    ",

      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** DCIP\n\nWe all know DCIP well, and we are all bullish on the prospects.  That is why we are here.  Given the upcoming developments (fiat bridge, YouTuber exposure, exchanges, etc.), I believe that we should all have a very high level of confidence in substantial growth in token price in the next few months.  While there is currently DCIP in the investment wallet, it is just there temporarily until the funds are allocated to investments.  I recommend that we make a formal investment in DCIP to take advantage of the near term expected price growth prior to diversifying into other investments.  Given what we know about the upcoming developments, I do not believe any crypto investment will outperform this asset in the next few months.   This will help to provide for rapid growth of the investment wallet, and this investment could also help to support the DCPI price in the near term.  \n\nI propose that we invest now and sell once we have received a 10x on our cost basis (or price at the day the investment is approved if we allocate DCIP already in the investment wallet).  We would then sell in a way that would not materially adversely effect price - specifically, we would only sell an amount any day less than or equal to 5% of the average daily volume for the past 7 days.  Further, we would only sell at a price that would achieve the noted 10x return.  \n\n\nI propose an investment equivalent to $100,000 USD.  If there is not sufficient liquidity to accomplish this at the time it is approved, I propose to liquidate the Telcoin and Horizon Protocol investments solely to the extent necessary to fund this investment. \n\n\n    ",

With its hybrid (2-layer) approach being natively GDPR compliant, it lowers the obstacles for businesses to get started with blockchain backed SaaS solutions. Working together with integrators, governments and organizations like the United Nations, LTO Network is a paving the way to support blockchain efforts across the globe; leading a whole new wave of adoption coming to the cryptoverse.\n\nThere are endless real-world applications for this blockchain, including the safe issuance of different kinds of documents going from legal to financial paperwork. The project would practically eliminate the need for a trusted third party such as a solicitor or bank to be involved to validate the identity of the parties involved.\n\nMoreover, it would be fairly easy to complete the signing of a document within the blockchain as the network’s speed and transparency will expedite the process, while costs will also be reduced.\n\nSome projects already being powered by the LTO blockchain include Firm 24, a company that uses the network to notarise the signatures of prospective company founders in Germany.\nAnother example of LTO’s practical use cases is SignRequest, a company that processes more than one million documents a year and that is also using the LTO network to guarantee the immutability of documents being signed by its clients through the platform.\n\nDeflationary token\n\nThe LTO token is deflationary, which means that a small percentage gets burned with each transaction (0.1) LTO. This might get changed in the future, if the node holders vote for it.\n\nNFT 2.0\n\nWith NFT2.0, assets that belong to an NFT are in your possession. You manage them in your wallet (on your phone or laptop), maintaining full control. You can trade your assets with other users directly. Third-parties are not necessarily required.\n\nhttps://blog.ltonetwork.com/roadmap2022/\n\nLTO network is a long term imvestment. They have multiple big partnerships coming up with organisations such as governments, companies and other blockchains. The real life adoptation makes them a blockchain to stay.",

      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** THETA\n\nTheta aims to establish itself as the blockchain powered video delivery platform featuring decentralized streaming and token-based bandwidth sharing model.\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** THETA\n- **Token Type:** Token\n- **Token Chain** native blockchain\n- **Stage:** Launched\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** [link](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/assets.thetatoken.org/Theta-white-paper-latest.pdf)\n- **Team doxxed:** Yes\n- **Proof of dox:** [link](https://www.thetatoken.org/)\n- **Smart contract public:** Yes\n- **Audit:** Yes\n- **LP Lock:** Yes\n\n### What Is Theta (THETA)?\nTheta (THETA) is a blockchain powered network purpose-built for video streaming. Launched in March 2019, the Theta mainnet operates as a decentralized network in which users share bandwidth and computing resources on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis.The project is advised by Steve Chen, co-founder of YouTube and Justin Kan, co-founder of Twitch.\nTheta features its own native cryptocurrency token, THETA, which performs various governance tasks within the network, and counts Google, Binance, Blockchain ventures, Gumi, Sony Europe and Samsung as Enterprise validators, along with a Guardian network of thousands of community-run guardian nodes.\nDevelopers say that the project aims to shake up the video streaming industry in its current form — centralization, poor infrastructure and high costs mean that end users often end up with a poor experience. Content creators likewise earn less revenue due to the barriers between them and end users.\n\n### What Makes Theta Unique?\n\nTheta’s main business concept is to decentralize video streaming, data delivery and edge computing, making it more efficient, cost-effective and fair for industry participants.\nThe network runs on a native blockchain, with two native tokens, known as Theta (THETA), Theta Fuel (TFUEL), powering the internal economy.\nTheta’s appeal is threefold: viewers get rewarded with better quality streaming service, content creators improve their earnings and middlemen — video platforms — save money on building infrastructure and increase advertising and subscription revenues.\nUsers have an incentive to both watch network content and share network resources, as rewards come in the form of TFUEL tokens.\nThe platform is open source, and token holders receive governance powers as with many proof-of-stake (PoS)-based blockchain ecosystems.\nIn addition to video, data and computing, Theta caters to developers looking to launch decentralized applications (DApps) on its fully featured EVM-compatible Smart contract platform.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nThe current adoption of THETA is low. Currently one of the biggest costs are the infrastructure of the internet. With Theta global players like Google can massively reduce their costs. It is just a matter of time until adoption kicks in. Theta has already several patents to protect them from copycats. In the past month the price went sideways. At a certain point it has to go up.\n    ",

It functions as a marketplace where developers can rent storage space — similar to a traditional cloud storage. But instead of trusting one provider with your files, they’re split up and served by a globally distributed network of computers.\n\nThe Filecoin network uses two types of miners — storage miners, who store the data, and retrieval miners, who supply the bandwidth used to retrieve the files. The communication between clients and the network happens via two types of “deals”: storage and retrieval deals. \n\nIn a storage deal, the client chooses a miner to store their data and locks up the funds necessary to pay for storage. Once the agreement is accepted, the file is transferred and stored by the miner. The miner provides continuous proof of storage to the chain in order to receive rewards from the funds locked up by a client. If they fail to provide a proof (or if proof is delayed) the miner gets penalized.\n\nIn a retrieval deal, the client makes a payment to a retrieval miner to extract the data from the network. (Retrieval miners can also be storage miners, but they don’t have to be.) These deals are executed “off-chain” — using micropayment channels to reward miners for data retrieval.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\nIf Filecoin is any implication of what is to come in the future, you can expect to see more blockchain-based file sharing protocols enter the market. These systems help users secure a passive income and help to reduce the carbon footprint and waste produced by users who no longer need to purchase hardware. For these reasons, Filecoin is set to experience massive growth in the coming months.",

Stellar aims to connect banks, payment systems, and individuals quickly and reliably.\n\nXLM (or Lumens), fuels activity on the Stellar network. The Stellar network is a system designed to help payments cross borders (and currencies) much faster and more cheaply than with traditional financial-system networks. \n\nFor example, a bank in Japan might use Stellar to send money to a bank in Mexico. Stellar would automatically convert yen to XLM, send the payment via blockchain, and reconvert XLM to pesos at the best current exchange rate. \n\nStellar was intended to work alongside existing assets and cryptocurrencies, allowing users to create digital representations of any asset as a Stellar token. These can then be used to transact on the blockchain, and can be redeemed at any time for the base asset.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nTransactions on the Lumens network settle in as little as five seconds and cost less than pennies, making them ideal for both international and consumer transactions. They are ideal for disrupting the traditional banking sector, which can charge hefty foreign exchange fees for cross-border transactions. The setup works because the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) utilizes nodes, or individual users running Stellar's software, to validate transactions. This is done pro bono, similar to how writers contribute on Wikipedia for no pay for the good of all humanity. So network transaction fees and environmental emissions are always low. The network is also no longer inflationary, with new block emissions halted and a portion of transaction fees taken out of circulation per use.\n\nFurthermore, Stellar is evolving into a cyberorganism distinct from that of its main competitor Ripple Labs. For starters, it has its very own decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to trade crypto-crypto currency pairs. Due to regulatory restraints, DEXs are one of the only ways American investors can access the lucrative altcoin market. DEXs like Uniswap, which launched in 2018, are already seeing over $380 billion in annual trading volume. That's not all; Stellar also runs a fiat-crypto gateway exchange, allowing users to cash out with euros or the Chinese yuan. \n\nFinally, unlike Ripple Labs, neither the Stellar Development Foundation nor Interstellar nor any of its syndicates are facing a crippling lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleging the illegal sale of unregistered securities. This is, ironically, despite Stellar minting all of its coins from the start like Ripple Labs did with XRP. So it does not face hesitation in adoption due to regulatory scrutiny. Overall, due to its unique network setup, promising partnerships, expansion into decentralized finance, distinct niche compared to XRP, and lack of legal issues, XLM is definitely one of the top cryptocurrencies to buy right now. Consider becoming a Lumenaut today, which is slang for a proud owner of XLM. \n    ",

      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** Curve.Finance\n\nCurve is a popular automated market maker (AMM) platform that offers a highly efficient way to exchange tokens while maintaining low fees and low slippage by only accommodating liquidity pools made up of similarly behaving assets. While this approach results in lower fees for the liquidity providers who supply the pools with tokens, Curve incentivizes their participation by integrating with external DeFi protocols and delivering rewards in the form of CRV tokens and interest.\n\nI propose providing liquidity in the form of USDN %7.18 APR plus Curve rewards %15.98.  This is an excelent and secure passive income generator. \n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name: Curve DAO Toekn (CRV)\n- **Token Address: 0xD533a949740bb3306d119CC777fa900bA034cd52\n- **Token Type: Token\n- **Token Chain: Ethereum\n- **Stage:** [Announced, Private sale, Pre-sale, Launched, or other]\n- **Link to the whitepaper: https://curve.fi/whitepaper\n- **Smart contract public:  Yes\n\n\n### Functional details\n\nThe easiest way to understand Curve is to see it as an exchange. Its main goal is to let users and other decentralised protocols exchange stablecoins (DAI to USDC for example) through it with low fees and low slippage. Unlike exchanges out there that match a buyer and a seller, the behaviour of Curve is different, it uses liquidity pools like Uniswap. To achieve this, Curve needs liquidity (tokens) which is rewarded by those who provide it.\nCurve is non-custodial meaning the Curve developers do not have access to your tokens.\n\nIf we provide a large amount of liquidity, we will recieve APR plus CRV rewards. \n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nI propose providing liquidity in the form of USDN %7.18 APR plus Curve rewards %15.98.  This is an excelent and secure passive income generator. \n\nThis is a NO-RISK investment, designed to grow our portfolio.",

      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** [Open position on Helium(HNT) token]\n\n[HNT is a cryptocurrency earned when hotspots provide and validate wireless coverage and transfer device data over the network, IOT]\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** Helium + HNT\n- **Token Address:** It's on its own blockchain, see info at https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/helium/project-info/ \n- **Token Type:** Token\n- **Token Chain** Helium Blockchain\n- **Stage:** Launched and providing coverage, turned 2 years August 1st, 2021\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** http://whitepaper.helium.com/\n- **Team doxxed:** Yes\n- **Proof of dox:** https://www.helium.com/about#team\n\n### Functional details\n\nThe Helium Hotspot enables anyone to own and operate a wireless network for low-power Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The Helium Hotspot provides hundreds of square miles of connectivity and can transmit data at a fraction of the cost of a cellular network. Helium uses an open-source LongFi architecture, which combines the LoRaWAN wireless protocol and the Helium blockchain. Hotspots also acts as miners on the Helium blockchain so owners can earn a new cryptocurrency (HNT), for building the network and transferring IoT device data. Helium network is currently the largest growing network with over 70000 miners coming online every month, a total of 320,000 miners onboarded with over a million on order from different manufacturers. \n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nAnyone doubting the helium network should visit https://explorer.helium.com/hotspots look at their area(or any area in the world) and how many miners have been deployed thus far, as well as how much HNT each miner is earning. As of 11/17/2021, the current price of HNT is $44.38 (after a market-wide correction) which recently doubled after a deal between Helium and Dish Network. There is a proposal by the community to re-denominate HNT 1000/1 which will bring new new investors as well as reward hotspot owners with more HNT. The network is currently undergoing upgrades and it just so happens to coincide with a crypto market-wide correction. This is the absolute perfect time to invest in helium, during this dip and before the redenomination which will surely bring a myriad of new investors and increase its price even further. The redenomination will not affect the token's current market cap. There is an extremely large community backing this project, with thousands upon thousands of hotspot owners which would like to see this project succeed therefore, this project has a very low chance of failure as it currently stands. If you would like to read about the proposed redenomination please visit https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0039-hnt-redenomination.md . \nHelium, like Bitcoin halves exactly every two years and with the first halving already occurred on August 1, 2021 this means the token will become more scarce and the community will remain very interested in providing coverage to earn HNT. There is no doubt that the price of helium will continue to rise in the coming months and years. I'm willing to discuss with the community the perfect time for entry into this position, as the price may dip if the redenomination passes but then it will surelyskyrocket after that.\n    ",

      "content": "\nMulitVac(MTV)\n\n\nThe reason we are all here is because of crypto, which blockchain technology is the foundation of. The current leader in the space is Ethereum. The vast majority of DApps are deployed on Ethereum, almost 90% of them. But we all know Ethereum isn’t perfect.\n \nEthereum’s transaction speed averages only 20 transactions per second, yes layer 2 solutions do solve this to an extent. Because of the slow speed, Ethereum miners charge huge fees to verify those transactions.\n \nSeveral companies are trying to solve the trilemma of building a blockchain that is decentralized, scalable and secure. Few of the companies solve all three.\n \nEnter MultiVAC (MTV). Now I will be honest, some of the explanations coming I have pulled from the internet to simplify explaining this. MultiVAC breaks through the limitations of blockchain scalability by developing the world’s first fully sharded blockchain with sharded transmission and storage. Infinite sharding. A real simple way to put it is that sharding means to divide the data and the work into chunks (shards). Sharding is about distributing something into smaller pieces that need to be processed by multiple actors, usually at the same time. The overall purpose is to increase the number of things that are achieved per unit of time.\n \nDecentralization, Scalability and Security. MultiVAC is the first to come up with a technological solution which basically allows developers to trade off (be flexible) between the three as their DApps require.\n \nRemember above when I said Ethereum averaged 20 transactions a second? MultiVAC is currently running over 30,000 transactions a second. And this can scale.\n \nElrond, Zilliqa, Near, and Harmony are other companies trying to solve the trilemma, but they are only 2 for 3.\n \nLet’s look at growth potential. MultiVAC is currently trading for $0.022 with a market cap of $74.6M. It only launched its main net in June of this year. If it had the market cap of Zilliqa it would be trading for $0.38, an upside of 17x.\n \nIf it had Harmony’s market cap, it would be trading for $0.87, an upside of 40x.\n \nIf It had Elrond’s market cap it would be trading for $1.87, an upside of 86x.\n \nIf it had Near’s market cap it would also be trading for $1.87, an upside of 86x.\n \nIf it had Polygon’s market cap it would be trading for $3.52, and upside of 162x. What does Polygon do? They built a parachain or side chain to help solve Ethereum’s problems. They are like a temporary fix.\n \nIf MultiVAC has the right solution, this could be massive. We also know Ethereum is trying sharding and proof of stake to solve some problems but it’s hard to fix a moving train. MultiVAC solves those problems, and the transaction costs are fractions of a penny.\n \n If it managed to hit Polygon’s market cap one day, $100 investment now would be worth $16,000. Or I could be wrong. This is not financial advice, and I ask that you all do some research to decide if this is a path we should pursue.\n\n    ",

      "title": "Open new position for HOGE Finance (HOGE) a decentralized community project with reflections and smart burn",
      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** Hoge Finance [HOGE] (https://hogefinance.com/)\n\n\n\nLaunched February 7th, 2021, HOGE is a decentralized community project on the ethereum blockchain, with no team allocation at launch. All team and community members bought on the open market. NFTs, Charities, Games, Metaverse, Hoge University, and memes.\n\n- 1% of all transactions distributed to holders\n- 1% of all transactions burned forever\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** Hoge Finance (HOGE)\n- **Token Address:** 0xfad45e47083e4607302aa43c65fb3106f1cd7607\n- **Token Type:** Token\n- **Token Chain** Ethereum\n- **Stage:** Launched\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** https://hogefinance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hoge_whitepaper.pdf\n- **Team doxxed:** Yes\n- **Proof of dox:** https://egs.hogeassociation.org/ (scroll down, huge team)\n- **Smart contract public:** Yes\n- **Audit:** Yes\n- **Proof of Audit:** https://www.certik.org/projects/hogefinance\n- **LP Lock:** Yes\n- **LP Lock proof:** https://app.unicrypt.network/amm/uni-v2/token/0xfAd45E47083e4607302aa43c65fB3106F1cd7607\n\n### Functional details\n\nHOGE is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. It has a 2% tax on every transaction. One-half of that tax is transferred back to wallet holders. The other half of the tax is burned forever. This makes HOGE a deflationary cryptocurrency. HOGE is a decentralized community project, with no team allocation at launch. All team and community members bought on the open market.\n\n**Completed Roadmap (on time AND ahead of schedule) for Q3-Q4 2021:**\n\n- Two phases of the NFT Platform deployed with custom minting (The Genesis and The Expansion)\n- \n- Creation of a legal entity (DAO – Hoge Hybrid)\n- \n- Bridged to a L2 Network (xDai)\n- \n- Website game development\n- \n- Created an eSports community\n- \n- Passed a full audit from Certik (first DeFi meme token ever to do this)\n- \n- CubeSat team formed and prepped for 2021 NASA CSLI call for proposals….memes in SPACE.\n- \n- Coingecko and Coinmarketcap Listings\n- \n- Website deployment\n- \n- App deployment\n- \n- Creating social media platforms and building an organic social media presence\n- \n- Developing relationships with non-profits and animal charities\n- \n- Listing on centralized exchanges\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nI believe ~$20,000 should be allocated and left to sit. With the burning of coins and reflections, as well as the community efforts and completed roadmap, this coin has the potential to reach a large marketcap quickly.\n\nWhy I like HOGE: \nThe community. It is rare to find such an engaged community that actually goes out and promotes the coin and creates value (memes, NFT, posts on reddit, etc)\n\nThey are Lobbying - A US Lobbyist is helping with the crypto infrastructure bill for all of DeFi.\n\nFuture endeavors in the growing metaverse space with Virtual Pangea gaming platform.\n\nDecentralized - this is truly a decentralized community project with massive things in the works. With the growing hype of NFT's and the Metaverse the sky is the limit with HOGE.\n \n\n\n    ",

      "content": "**Proposal for:** ExzoCoin 2.0\n\nExzoCoin 2.0 (EXZO) is a utility token developed by the EXZO Team that is based out of Tampa, Florida, USA.\n\nExzoCoin 2.0 (EXZO) will be utilized on our decentralized exchange mobile application, launchpad, and blockchain for the creation of non-fungible tokens that are linked to structured private data assets. Our main focus is on providing safety, scalability, and security within the cryptocurrency and blockchain community through implementing new security protocols & genetic algorithms into smart contracts for creating a multi-layered network.\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** ExzoCoin 2.0 | EXZO\n- **Token Address:** 0xF8fC63200e181439823251020d691312FDcF5090\n- **Token Type:** Utility\n- **Token Chain** Binance Smart Chain\n- **Stage:** Launched\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** https://exzocoin.com/whitepaper\n- **Team doxxed:** Yes\n- **Proof of dox:** https://exzocoin.com/about-us/\n- **Smart contract public:** Yes\n- **Audit:** Yes\n- **Proof of Audit:** [Certik](https://leaderboard.certik.io/projects/exzocoin)\n- **LP Lock:** Yes\n- **LP Lock proof:** https://app.unicrypt.network/amm/pancake-v2/token/0xF8fC63200e181439823251020d691312FDcF5090\n\n### Functional details\n\nExzo Network will be the platform that provides a wide range of blockchain and DeFi opportunities for users from swapping tokens between different blockchains and earn profits from staking to creating fully-functional dApps written in Solidity and fully compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n\nInitially Exzo Network ecosystem will be a fork of Fantom Network (https://fantom.foundation/). This will give faster time to market, robust technology and feature-rich solutions.\n\n**Main components of the platform will include:**\n\n- Multi-chain Wallet & Decentralized Exchange (DEX) | Currently alpha testing iOS and Android app: https://twitter.com/EXZOcoin/status/1459783378903961600\n- Main blockchain network supporting Solidity dApps\n- Cross-chain swap application\n- Blockchain explorer\n- Governance token\n- Staking module\n\nIn later versions, it is planned to introduce enterprise solutions for managing, tracking, and securing private data such as healthcare data/patient data, data for private sector industries, government, etc.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nLong term investment in a decent project with huge potential. I'm asking for a 7.5K - 15K investment in this project with a current MCap of 8.8M. I've been investing in this project myself since it launched. The token launched in June and got dumped after the Unicrypt presale. True believers in the use-case kept supporting the dev team, who are very honest and transparant. The token gained more traction in the beginning of October because of the app progress and only went up since then. The multi-chain wallet and DEX app is currently in alpha testing phase.

This includes the ways in which creators coordinate their communities and projects, engage with consumers and collaborators, automate their interactions, and trust their transactions. It redefines how assets can be managed, collections showcased, and brands experienced. It is the technological playground for creative professionals to shape emerging trends and unleash their creative force.\n\nAside from what Lukso will bring to the crypto space, the team behind it is no joke either. Lukso is created by blockchain veteran Fabian Vogelsteller, the author of ERC 725,ERC 20, and Web3.js (the latter two forming the foundation of todays DeFi standards). Backed by a team of advisors and partnerships with companies like Nike, Chanel, Burberry.\n\nLukso, in my opinion, is a very good project to invest in. With the launch of their main net (Q4) around the corner and listing on exchanges in the works, I think we’ll be seeing a huge upside to Lukso in the near future, and potentially as a long term investment should the DCIP community agree.\n\nShould you want to read into it more you can follow the link below to get redirected to a summary of Lukso’s white paper.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/lukso/comments/pcyahi/lukso_whitepaper_summary/ \n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:LYXE\n- **Token Address: 0xA8b919680258d369114910511cc87595aec0be6D\n- **Token Type: Token\n- **Token Chain: Ethereum\n- **Stage:Launched\n- **Link to the whitepaper: https://lukso.network/assets/LUKSO_Whitepaper.pdf\n- **Team doxxed: yes\n- **Proof of dox: https://lukso.network/about\n- **Smart contract public: yes\n\n\n",

      "content": "Hello everyone, \nThis is my Proposal for AAVE\n\nWebsite: \nhttps://aave.com/\n\nWhitepaper: https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/master/aave-v2-whitepaper.pdf\n\nWhat is Aave?\nAave is a decentralised non-custodial liquidity market protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralised (perpetually) or undercollateralised (one-block liquidity) fashion.\n\nWhy Aave?\nAave Protocol has been audited and secured. The protocol is completely open source, which allows anyone to interact with an user interface client, API or directly with the smart contracts on the Ethereum network. Being open source means that you are able to build any third-party service or application to interact with the protocol and enrich your product.\n\nFeel free to refer to the White Paper for a deeper dive into Aave Protocol mechanisms.\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We are working to rebuild financial services in societies that are traumatized and stressed by decades of wealth destruction from high inflation and ongoing currency devaluation.\n\nOur business generates revenue today by charging a spread (a type of fee) when users move money in or out of our app. Our long-term business model is based on the currency we are working on; we intend to participate, along with thousands of others, in the decentralized organization that operates that currency.\n\nToday Reserve offers the opportunity to save, spend, and receive money through the Reserve app and a stable currency, the Reserve Dollar (RSV), which is a cryptocurrency that maintains 1-to-1 parity with the US dollar.\n\nThe project is still in the startup phase, but is well beyond just an idea. We process about 15,000 transactions daily, which amount to about $1.5 million in value moved per day, for users in Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, and the US.\n\n\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nI think RSR is a great opportunity and with Peter Thiel invested and Coinbase partnered maybe the next Paypal. They have a running app and already use it in Venezuela. Coinbase listing is on the way. I personally am invested since Mai/June and are already in profit. But I think this is a real GEM and is going the same way as VRA in his place.\n    ",

Due to more frequent block generation, the network supports more transactions without a need to modify the software in the future.  As a result, merchants get faster confirmation times, while still having ability to wait for more confirmations when selling bigger ticket items.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nLitecoin is well-known in the crypto world. Different sources claim this will reach $1000 in the long term.\nThis is a stable coin to invest in with nice upside potential\n\n**# Advantages of Litecoin Investments**\n\nAs among the 1st altcoins on the market, Litecoin typically holds its value better than newer altcoins with lower market capitalizations. Let’s take a look at a few of the advantages of the Litecoin network and technology.\n\n**Lower transaction costs **\n\nLitecoin’s technology offers a number of improvements on Bitcoin’s infrastructure, including lower transaction costs. When you send Bitcoin from wallet to wallet, you lose a bit of crypto as the transaction is verified on the blockchain. Though Litecoin operates in a very similar manner, its network is more efficient than Bitcoin, which means that you lose less money when you initiate or receive a transfer. This is a major benefit for users who turn to cryptocurrency for its benefits as a secure money transfer system.\n\n**Faster transaction speeds** \n\nLitecoin’s improved network doesn’t only extend to processing fees — it also enables users to send coins much faster when compared to Bitcoin’s blockchain. The average Litecoin transaction takes about 2.5 minutes to complete, while the average Bitcoin transaction closes in an average of 10 minutes.\n\n**Open-source platform**\n\nLitecoin is built upon a naturally open-sourced fork of the BTC Core Client. This makes it much easier for developers to adjust the system and implement new features to keep up with the changing needs of the market. Its flexibility also allows developers to implement software security patches on a regular basis to keep up with hackers’ changing methods of attack. \n\n**Recognizability** \n\nLitecoin has been around for quite a while, and has remained one of the most well known altcoins despite its modern technological irrelevance.",

There are many entities and technical concepts involved that, together, enable what we consider a true innovation: Swap between crypto and conventional currency in a self-custodial and decentralized way.\n\nBut what makes Nimiq special is not only the ability to produce technological innovation. It's the ease of use that turns complicated tech into real-world value for everyday humans. And we're just getting started.\n\nSuper simple swaps\nToday, we are introducing a unique product made by Nimiq: a standalone service that aspires to be the easiest, fastest, safest, and most accessible way to buy and sell crypto. And on top of that, it'll be one of the cheapest as well. That's a lot of superlatives but we're absolutely convinced we have the tech and ability to deliver on each one. But before we get into them, let's first talk about the product.\n\nA signup-free web app that puts together Fastspot, TEN31 and Nimiq OASIS to enable the unique concept of a fiat smart contract as a single service: one that provides self-custodial atomic swaps between crypto and conventional currency. No additional wallet needs to be created to use the service: any existing wallet is supported. The service currently supports EUR, BTC, and NIM, with more currencies being added in the future.\n\nBy connecting the basic touch points of users with fiat and crypto – the bank account and the crypto wallet – this service removes intermediaries, cuts out the middlemen and avoids the costs and centralization that come with them.\n\nIn short, it will be a super simple way to swap fiat and crypto. That's why we call it SuperSimpleSwap\n    ",

The containers will be fueled by renewable energy and because of the closed environment it will be possible to grow 365 days a year under optimized conditions anywhere you want. Even in a dessert. The grown food will be sold in own stores as well as by partners.\nAt first they will build containers locally in the near of Luxembourg and they are already in contact with potential partners there. In the future there will be first a national and then international expansion.\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nHealthy food is a big topic in our society as well as climate protection. By providing both of these great features Dulcet garden has big potential to grow insanely fast and big. The HC of the presale the project ran was filled in about 6 minutes and with the right marketing it will explode soon and build the base of stable future growth. Since this token is only 1 day old we have the great opportunity to invest very early in trustful project with an audited contract, KYCed team, awesome usecase and future incorporation.\n    ",

      "title": "Loopring (LRC): Become a Liquidity Provider",
      "content": "**Proposal for:** Loopring\n\nLoopring is an Ethereum (Layer-2) zk-rollup protocol.\nThis Layer-2 protocol is what powers the applications built on top of it, allowing them to enjoy the security + stability of Ethereum (Layer-1) but with much faster speeds (near instant swaps/transfers) + much lower fees (no gas!)\n\nBy buying a large stake we can become a Liquidity Provider when Layer-2 becomes active and earn 0.15% transactions fees over all the transactions made by the pools we provide liquidity for. Loopring handles over 4k transactions per second. You do the math.\n\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** Loopring (LRC)\n- **Token Address:** 0xBBbbCA6A901c926F240b89EacB641d8Aec7AEafD\n- **Token Type:** Other\n- **Token Chain** Ethereum\n- **Other:** Decentralized Ecosystem, CEX experience.\n- **Stage:** Launched\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** https://loopring.org/resources/en_whitepaper.pdf\n- **Team doxxed:** Yes\n- **Proof of dox:** https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?currentCompany=%5B%2213453869%22%5D&origin=COMPANY_PAGE_CANNED_SEARCH&sid=i~T\n- **Smart contract public:** Yes\n- **Audit:** Yes\n- **Proof of Audit:** https://loopring.org/resources/loopring1.0_audit.pdf\n\n\n### Functional details\n\nIn short... Loopring is capable of becoming the new stock market, or to simply bring mass adoption to NFTs and cryptocurrency in general.\n\nLoopring allows for fast, cheap, and secure blockchain transactions. They can handle thousands of transactions per second, transactions cost next to nothing, and since it is built on top of Ethereum it is also secure. Loopring enables companies to build decentralized, order-book-based exchanges. They also have/are their own exchange like Uniswap and Binance.\n\nLoopring is scalable, and instead of performing worse as more people use it… it performs better / has more liquidity. When Ethereum 2.0 is released, Loopring will scale far larger than it can on Ethereum 1.0, but this is not something that is even needed for their success, as stated in their discord by their staff.\n\nadditional links for research:\nLoopring: https://loopring.org/#/about\n          \nNews: https://medium.com/loopring-protocol\n      https://usa.inquirer.net/87139/loopring\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/loopringorg/comments/qespta/loopring_university_read_if_new_to_loopring/\n        https://www.reddit.com/r/loopringorg/comments/qosfa4/loopring_lrc_why_it_will_explode/\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nThe project seems very interesting and has so much potential. In my opinion, this could even change the financial market forever. The view of the team and their aspirations go well with the view of DCIP and its community. Opening a big position on Loopring might be very beneficial for this community as **we can become a Liquidity Provider and earn the 0.15% fee from all the trades** in the pools we are providing liquidity for. Loopring can do 4k-5k transaction per second. In comparison, Ethereum can only do 13 per second and VISA around 1.7k. Loopring is two times faster than a credit card company. Just imagine the massive potential and impact this could have. Anyways, check the DD and learn more about Loopring. I am sure you will fall in love with it as well. Peace.\n",

Since then, users have created a wide range of experiences on their parcels of LAND, including interactive games, sprawling 3D scenes and a variety of other interactive experiences.\n\nDecentraland uses two tokens: MANA and LAND. MANA is an ERC-20 token that must be burned to acquire non-fungible ERC-721 LAND tokens. MANA tokens can also be used to pay for a range of avatars, wearables, names, and more on the Decentraland marketplace.\n",

Shiba Inu and the SHIB token are part of a swarm of dog-themed cryptocurrencies, including Baby Dogecoin (BabyDoge), Dogecoin (DOGE), JINDO INU (JIND), Alaska Inu (LAS), and Alaskan Malamute Token (LASM). These lesser-valued tokens have attracted investors who missed the Dogecoin pump from 0.0002 to nearly 0.75 USD.\n\nOn Sept. 17, 2021, Coinbase, the largest US-based crypto exchange, listed Shiba Inu on their platform. This news caused Shiba Inu price to rise by over 40% in the following two days, bringing the meme dog token into the spotlight again.\n",

On the other hand, advertisers can deliver targeted ads to maximize engagement and cut down losses due to ad fraud and abuse.\n\nThe Basic Attention Token itself is the unit of reward in this advertising ecosystem, and is exchanged between advertisers, publishers and users. Advertisers pay for their advertising campaigns in BAT tokens. Out of this budget, a small portion is distributed to advertisers, while 70% is distributed to users — whereas the intermediaries that typically drive up advertising costs are cut out of the equation to improve cost-efficiency.\n\nBasic Attention Token launched in 2017 following one of the fastest sell-out initial coin offerings (ICOs) of all time, with the platform raising a total of $35 million in under a minute. Since then, it has rolled out its attention-based advertising experience to users in most countries through its Brave Rewards program.\n",

These pools are filled by users who deposit their funds into the pool and receive liquidity provider (LP) tokens in return.\n\nThese tokens can later be used to reclaim their share of the pool, as well as a portion of the trading fees. These LP tokens are known as FLIP. PancakeSwap also allows users to farm additional tokens such as CAKE and SYRUP. On the farm, users can deposit LP tokens and get rewarded with CAKE.\n\nPancakeSwap allows users to trade BEP20 tokens, provide liquidity to the exchange and earn fees, stake LP tokens to earn CAKE, stake CAKE to earn more CAKE and stake CAKE to earn tokens of other projects.\n",

      "content": "\n## What Makes Ethereum Unique?\nEthereum has pioneered the concept of a blockchain smart contract platform. Smart contracts are computer programs that automatically execute the actions necessary to fulfill an agreement between several parties on the internet. They were designed to reduce the need for trusted intermediates between contractors, thus reducing transaction costs while also increasing transaction reliability.\n\nEthereum’s principal innovation was designing a platform that allowed it to execute smart contracts using the blockchain, which further reinforces the already existing benefits of smart contract technology. Ethereum’s blockchain was designed, according to co-founder Gavin Wood, as a sort of “one computer for the entire planet,” theoretically able to make any program more robust, censorship-resistant and less prone to fraud by running it on a globally distributed network of public nodes.\n\nIn addition to smart contracts, Ethereum’s blockchain is able to host other cryptocurrencies, called “tokens,” through the use of its ERC-20 compatibility standard. In fact, this has been the most common use for the ETH platform so far: to date, more than 280,000 ERC-20-compliant tokens have been launched. Over 40 of these make the top-100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, for example, USDT, LINK and BNB. Since the emergence of Play2Earn games, there has been a substantial increase in interest in the ETH to PHP price.",

      "content": "\n**Proposal for:** DogeBonk\n\n[DogeBonk is a completely unruggable, spontaneously formed community token with the most potential to go viral of any meme coin since Shiba.]\n\n### Technical details\n\n- **Token Name:** [DogeBonk DOBO]\n- **Token Address:** [0xae2df9f730c54400934c06a17462c41c08a06ed8]\n- **Token Type:** [Token]\n- **Token Chain** [Binance Smart Chain]\n- **Stage:** [Launched]\n- **Link to the whitepaper:** [https://dogebonk.com/whitepaper.pdf]\n- **Team doxxed:** [Renounced contract]\n-**Renounce proof:** [https://bscscan.com/tx/0x9b75b1f680843326942355a86d29f1b256a6b730a8d7f58e23f1d995eb440ab2]\n- **Smart contract public:** [Yes]\n- **Audit:** [Yes]\n- **Proof of Audit:** [https://solidity.finance/audits/DogeBonk]\n- **LP Lock:** [Yes]\n- **LP Lock proof:** [https://bscscan.com/tx/0x07ec642f88f5d794cd49f76945ef9f16b7c6fe5c0c88dfad0cb28d4d0870d096?utm_source=dogebonk.com]\n\n### Functional details\n\n\nSince DogeCoin exploded earlier this year there have been thousands of dog coins most of them scams, false promises and poor ripoffs with devs sole purpose being to make as much money from their holders as possible. Every day another team launches their coin trying to piggyback off the success of others, offering false promises of NFT marketplaces, metaverse worlds and whatever else is the newest trending hashtag on Twitter. These coins have forgotten that what makes you a meme coin is how good your memes are.\n\nAds have popped up all over p*rnhub, ads coming in midtown Manhattan. ​DogeBonk is different. The DogeBonk community spontaneously formed around a dog token with locked liquidity, renounced contract and SafeMoon tokenomics. It has grown from <300 holders four weeks ago to over 25000 today. \n\n10% tax on all transactions\n5% are distributed to fellow DOBO holders,5% are added to liquidity to create an ever rising price floor.\nThe token has deflationary properties and automatic yield generation. (Burn wallet is receiving ~1% of all transactions FORTY% burned so far)\n\n## Fund allocation and personal opinion\n\nThe memes and energy coming from this community is crazy. Just search DogeBonk on the search bar on Twitter and you’ll see what I mean. Once you see the quality of these memes you will see how DogeBonk has huge potential to go viral. DogeBonk is the most memeable project in the crypto space since Doge.\n\nDogebonk recently reached a market cap of 100 million and is well on its way to 1 billion or more. There is 10x or more potential for this coin. I suggest a modest investment of 0,000 USD which we can progressively cash out as we move towards the 1 billion market cap.\n    ",
