      "title": "DAO Treasury Distribution Proposal",
      "content": "Status: Snapshot Vote\n\n\nAuthor(s): AlpacaChad; Mesk85; CryptoChicca\n\n\nDiscussions-to: [Link to the discussion on the forum]\n\n\nCreated: Oct 3rd\n\n\n\nBUZZED SUMMARY\n\nThe proposal aims to distribute the main DAO’s treasury (HONEYPOT) among voting members. Voters will decide whether to distribute the whole treasury to voters. There will be no changes to the structure or governance of the main BBH DAO.\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis proposal aims to consolidate all liquid assets, including NFTs and cryptocurrencies, into Wrapped Ether (WETH) for distribution among members who participate in the vote. \nIf the proposal reaches quorum and the majority votes FOR, the WETH will be airdropped to all bears that voted FOR or AGAINST. \nIf the proposal passes quorum and the majority is AGAINST all WETH will remain in the honeypot. \nThe BBH DAO will continue to function as it currently does, with no structural changes.\n\n\nMOTIVATION\n\nThis proposal gives BBH DAO members a simple choice: keep the treasury in the DAO or split it among active voters.\n\n\nSPECIFICATION\n\nVoting Period: The voting will remain open for 42.0 days, with communication on available community channels to ensure participation.\n\n\nTreasury Management: HONEYPOT’s cryptocurrencies will be consolidated into WETH before distribution. HONEYPOT’s NFTs will be transferred to a designated wallet, similar to what has been successfully done in the past by BBH’s investment committee, enabling the acceptance of WETH offers, along with a sufficient amount of ETH, for accepting offers above 0.04 ETH. Once offers are accepted, the WETH will be sent back to the HONEYPOT.\n\n\nHoney Split: The WETH will be divided according to the following formula: Amount received per wallet = consolidated assets value / number of BEAR who voted on Snapshot * number of BBH token held Example: \nConsolidated assets value = 200WETH \nNumber of BEAR who voted on Snapshot = 4,000 \nNumber of BBH token held = 10 \nAmount received = 200 / 4000 * 10 = 0.5 WETH\n\n\nHoney Reserve: If majority is AGAINST the BBH DAO will retain the treasury.\n\n\nGovernance: The BBH DAO will continue under its existing governance structure.\n\n\nFounders’ bears: The first 100 bears that were minted and reserved for founders will be void to vote with \n\n\nTransparency: Regular updates and reports will be provided after the voting ends to ensure all members are kept informed of progress.\n\nEligibility for payout: Voters must hold at least one of the bears they voted with until the end of the voting period. If any bears are sold, only the remaining ones will be eligible for the payout. Once the vote ends another snapshot will be taken for verification.\n\n\nRATIONALE\n\nJustification for distributing the treasury only to voters. \n\n\n\nEffective governance relies on active participation.\n\nActive participation reflects commitment.\n\nConcerns over inactive wallets.\n\nTax considerations.\n\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATION\n\nConsolidation of assets and Distribution of Cryptocurrencies:\n\n\nNFT Consolidation: The current multi-signers will manually transfer the HONEYPOT’s NFTs to a designated wallet with a sufficient amount of ETH, similar to what has been successfully done in the past by BBH’s investment committee, enabling the acceptance of WETH offers. Offers at or above 0.04 WETH will be accepted. Once the NFTs are sold, the WETH will be transferred back to the HONEYPOT. If an NFT has no offers, it will remain in the HONEYPOT.\n\n\nUnstaking and Consolidating Cryptocurrencies: The current multi-signers will manually handle the consolidation of various cryptocurrencies into Wrapped Ether (WETH). Using the COWswap Safe Wallet App, multi-signers will convert the main cryptocurrencies into WETH (ETH, WETH, SAFE, MANA, INDEX, DAI, LYXe, icETH, MVI, OHM, SAFE).\n\n\nDistribution Process:\n- After voting ends: addresses of voters will be collected, then the multi-signers will utilize the Drips Safe Wallet App to distribute WETH.\n- Transaction Fees: fees for transactions will be covered by the HONEYPOT. \n- Collection of addresses: Snapshot Admins will export the voting addresses from Snapshot, then they will create a spreadsheet with recipient + percentage to be received to match Drips App requirement, then multi-signers will create a Drip list on the Drips App. The Drip list will be made public for verification purposes. \n- Transfer: multi-signers will use the Drip list to send all WETH.\n\n\nTEST CASES\n\nIf the proposal passes,\n\n\n\nA public Drip List test will be created and verified by Snapshot Admins and at least 2 community members.\n\nSnapshot Admins will create a spreadsheet with 3 voting addresses and associated percentages to be received.\n\nA small amount will be distributed to test the Drips app\n\nThe list will be checked against wallets on Etherscan to verify distribution accuracy.\n\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0",

      "title": "Return bears to 21xhr",
      "content": "STATUS: Proposal Author(s): @CryptoChicca\n\nCREATED: 17 October 2024\n\nDISCUSSIONS-TO: Refer to forum\n\nIMPLEMENTATION (optional): Immediate. ‌\n\n\nBUZZED SUMMARY\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to return the bears that 21xhr transferred to the honeypot in transaction ID (https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe1d46099e36775db97b5c2a6b09f57659cded7c73df3946361b76d37e4e13998) to his wallet (​​0x431DFb184A8c49dd803938432A8211010D0C4182).\n\n\nABSTRACT ‌\n\nApproximately 29 days ago, 21xhr, then a mod of the Buzzed Bear Hideout Discord transferred his 11 bears to the honeypot wallet. He did so because he was being accused of bias, bribery and other like terms from some bears. In an effort to prove he was not acting with any of those intents, he sent his bears to the honeypot wallet. Whilst altruistic in nature, this did not prevent the accusations and only sought to disadvantage 21xhr, from the writer’s perspective, as they were his bears which he was entitled to vote with and accept compensation for. As he has not been compensated for those bears that he purchased, the writer contends those bears should be returned to him. Further, any proposal for distribution that is initiated prior to this occurring should take those bears into account as though they were in his wallet with a neutral vote. The writer makes no judgment on the sending of the bears, but feels that 21xhr should not be unduly disadvantaged for trying to be helpful to all bears in his capacity of Buzzed Bear Hideout moderator.  \n\n\nSPECIFICATION OVERVIEW\n\nThe bears under transaction ID (https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe1d46099e36775db97b5c2a6b09f57659cded7c73df3946361b76d37e4e13998) shall be returned from the honeypot to 0x431DFb184A8c49dd803938432A8211010D0C4182. For the sake of clarity, the bears owned by 21xhr that were transferred to the honeypot and shall be returned to him are 11 bears, as follows:\n\n1. Token ID 5821\n2. Token ID 8950\n3. Token ID 8949\n4. Token ID 8948\n5. Token ID 8944\n6. Token ID 8945\n7. Token ID 8946\n8. Token ID 8947\n9. Token ID 8943\n10. Token ID 8942\n11. Token ID 8941\n\nShould a proposal for distribution be initiated before the bears are returned to his wallet, thus leaving him unable to vote on that proposal and secure a distribution on that proposal, if successful, then this proposal shall deem those bears to be in his wallet prior to the initiation of such a proposal so that he can benefit from the outcome of the proposal should that other ultimately end in a distribution. This will mean that if there is a successful distribution proposal, then 11 bears shall be added to the voting numbers for that other proposal in the final calculation amount.  For example, if a distribution proposal is successful with 800 bears voting, then it shall be deemed to be 811 bears should this proposal pass. Further, any snapshot taken prior to the bears being returned to 21xhr shall be deemed to include his bears in that snapshot. He will therefore benefit from any distribution proposal in line with the terms of that other distribution proposal. \n \n\nRATIONALE ‌\n\nThe reasons for this proposal are:\n\n1. Correcting and unfair disadvantage to 21xhr\n2. Reverting 21xhr to the position he was in prior to the creation of the unfair disadvantage\n\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\nThe multi-signers will handle the transfer of the 11 bears back to 21xhr as per the terms of this proposal\n\n\nTEST CASES\n\nThere has been a transfer of NFTs from the honeypot to other wallets actioned by multi-signers.\n\n\nCOPYRIGHT ‌\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

This transfer will resolve concerns over centralization and server management. @defijesus will retain a moderator role. Additionally, new moderators can be elected through a Snapshot proposal using quadratic voting, requiring at least 15 voters to reach consensus.\n\n\n\n## Motivation  \n\nLong-standing concerns over the current ownership of BBH assets and centralization risks have been further highlighted by recent events, such as the deletion of the #general channel. The sole moderation responsibility of @21xHR and their history of good behavior justify the transfer of ownership to ensure better server management and decision-making.  \nrefer to the following discussion for more details https://discord.com/channels/859190498341683240/1284245721553309716/1284559941612601426\n\n\n\n## Specification  \n\n- defijesus will transfer Discord server ownership to 21xHR.  \n\n- @defijesus will retain a moderator role.  \n\n- New moderators can be elected through a Snapshot proposal, using quadratic voting and requiring at least 15 voters to pass.\n\n\n\n## Rationale  \n\nTransferring ownership to @21xHR while keeping @defijesus as a mod will address long-standing concerns about centralization and ensure effective server management. @21xhr's consistent good behavior and current role as the sole moderator position them well to manage the server and facilitate better decision-making.\n\n\n\n## Technical Specification ‌ \n\nThe ownership transfer of the Discord server will be executed through the Discord admin settings. The current server owner, @defijesus will transfer ownership to @21xHR. \n\nThe new ownership will be confirmed by @21xHR upon receipt of the transfer request. \n\n\n\n## Copyright  \n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

      "title": "Governance Integrity Restoration",
      "content": "**Buzzed Summary**\n\nTo ensure trust and accountability in our governance process, we propose replacing the community member Felfireferret on the Safe(Wallet) Multisig with JRtrades, and replacing Felfireferret as Snapshot manager with Cryptohicca. This action is necessary due to a breach of trust where Felfireferret used his position for personal reasons, which compromised the integrity of the community’s decision-making process.\n\n**Abstract** \n\nThis proposal seeks to replace the current community-elected member, Felfireferret, from the Safe(Wallet) Multisig and the Snapshot manager role due to misconduct. JRtrades and Cryptohicca, who were the next most-voted community members in the respective original elections, will assume these positions. This change is vital to maintain the integrity of our governance system. Specifically, Felfireferret’s actions in deleting two community proposals without consent, following a personal dispute, have violated the trust placed in him by the community. This BIP proposes the immediate implementation of these replacements.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe motivation behind this proposal is to address a serious breach of trust by a community-elected member, Felfireferret. The community depends on its elected representatives to act in the best interest of all members. However, Felfireferret abused his power by deleting two proposals without the community’s knowledge or consent, following a personal vendetta against two members who abstained from voting on his proposal. This action undermines the principles of transparency, fairness, and trust that are central to our governance model. It is crucial to replace him with JRtrades and Cryptohicca, who have been democratically selected by the community, to restore confidence in the governance process.\n\n**Specification**\n\n**Overview**\n\nThis BIP proposes the immediate replacement of Felfireferret on the Safe(Wallet) Multisig with JRtrades, and the replacement of Felfireferret as Snapshot manager with Cryptohicca. Both JRtrades and Cryptohicca were the next most-voted candidates in the original proposals that elected the Safe(Wallet) Multisig members and Snapshot managers. The proposal also includes an audit of recent governance actions to ensure no further unauthorized actions have been taken.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe decision to replace Felfireferret is based on the principle of accountability. His actions have demonstrated a disregard for the community’s trust, which is unacceptable for someone in such a critical position. JRtrades and Cryptohicca were chosen because they were the next most-voted candidates, ensuring that the replacements reflect the community’s original democratic choices. This approach minimizes disruption while restoring integrity to our governance process.\n\n**Technical Specification**\n\nSafe(Wallet) Multisig: Replace the current key assigned to Felfireferret with JRtrades.\n\nSnapshot Manager Role: Update the Snapshot system to remove Felfireferret’s access and grant it to Cryptohicca.\n\n**Test Cases**\n\nVerify that JRtrades has been correctly added to the Safe(Wallet) Multisig and can execute transactions. Ensure Cryptohicca can manage the Snapshot proposals and no longer allow access to Felfireferret.\n\nCopyright Copyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

      "title": "Resubmission - Polar Beer",
      "content": "As a protest against the continued weaponisation of the quorum, a clear anti-democratic atitude, I'll resubmit this proposal:\n\n### -> Buzzed Summary:\n\nFor 2 years, a BBH-inspired beer was developed and has sold out without any social media marketing. This proposal requests $10,000 for compensation and aims to ensure future profitability for the DAO. The team is  committed to making this project a long-term success with a minimum of three editions to secure returns and profits.\n\n\n\n## -> Abstract\n\nWe propose to secure $10,000 in compensation for the team behind the development of “Polar Beer”, a BBH-inspired white stout with biological and eco-sustainable honey. After 22 months of testing and a well-received launch at an international event, the project is ready for future production and iterations. The team commits to produce at least three additional editions to ensure the initial investment is recouped and profits are ensured to BBH.\n\n\n\n### -> Motivation:\n\nThe creation of products under the BBH brand was always an objective. Inspired by the BBH #2812 drinking a beer, the blending of opposing poles – craft beer and digital environment – made total sense. The naming and colour-way used are reminiscent of honey and obviously the BBH black and yellow. At this point, there's a complete template to apply or develop from, and the initial objective was accomplished. Several marketing resources were produced (hoodies) and developed (coasters, posters) with a constant element referring the BBH art. There is also an AR mock-up ready to be implemented only held off for lack of resources.\n\nDespite limited resources, the project was completed with promising results. This compensation will reward the team's initiative and promote future BBH product developments.\n\n\n\n## -> Specification Overview\n\n- **Mesk (Artist)**: Adaptation of BBH #2812 art - 50 hours, $500\n\n- **@RPMDesign_ (Designer)**: Label and graphic resource development - 400+ hours, $1,500\n\n- **@su__me (Producer)**: Concept and logistics, AR/Gamification - 50+ hours, $500\n\n- **QuatroTorres (Brewery)**: Production and bottling - $3,500 donation\n\n- **FelFireFerret (Project Lead)**: Oversight, marketing content - 1,000+ hours, $4,000\n\n\n\nThis is an economically viable project created out of sheer commitment of a team with creativity and dedication. A total of 300 bottles were sold during the 3 day event, also over 100litres were sold on tap between 3 different locations, spreading the BBH brand to people still out of our environment. The timing and access to an international theatre festival “Imaginarius”, also helped broadening the reach and to create a bridge for future actions.\n\n\n\nTotal Compensation Requested: $10,000 equivalent in a token most convenient to the BBH DAO (i.e. ETH, USDC, DAI)\n\n\n\n## -> Rationale\n\nThe project blends BBH branding with craft beer, aligning with BBH's black and yellow theme. The team has invested significant time and resources into ensuring the beer's success. This compensation acknowledges their efforts and supports future profitable productions. The team commitment to negotiate at least three future editions (according to BBH’s needs and time availability) ensures the DAO's initial investment will be recouped and generate profits.\n\n\n\n## -> Technical Specification (for future runs)\n\n- **Production Plan**: 500 bottles per run, production cost $4 per bottle, selling price $10 per bottle\n\n- **Potential Revenue**: $5,000 per run, $3,000 profit per run\n\n- **Investment Recoupment**: Initial $10,000 investment expected to be recouped within three runs\n\n[The previous values are according to a simple replication of what has been done. Adaptations can incur in a higher cost to provide a bigger profit margin but always below the market price for these services]\n\n\n\n**Marketing Strategies**:\n\n- Leverage BBH’s community for initial sales\n\n- Partnerships with craft beer festivals or other relevant events\n\n- Utilize social media and generate contents\n\n- Implement AR/Gamification for engagement\n\n\n\n## -> Test Cases\n\nThe project was implemented.",

      "content": "\nAuthor(s): Mesk85.eth, defijesus.eth\n\n## Summary:\nThis proposal outlines a plan to bridge the gap between urban artists and the digital market by inviting artists to create graffiti works and offer them for sale as NFTs in the BBH x ART collection.\n\n## Abstract:\nWe propose to launch a new collection, BBH x ART, where graffiti works created by invited artists will be minted as NFTs and made available for purchase. This collection aims to provide a platform for artists to showcase their work and reach new audiences in the digital space.\n\n## Motivation:\nThe current market for urban art is limited and does not provide adequate exposure for artists. This proposal seeks to address this issue by creating a platform for artists to showcase their work and reach new audiences in the digital market.\n\n## Specification Overview:\nThe BBH x ART collection will be hosted on a secure, decentralized platform, and will feature graffiti works minted as NFTs. Invited artists will create their works using the provided materials, and the final product will be photographed and documented for the purpose of minting as NFTs. An iPad Pro with Wi-Fi, 11 inches and 128 GB, and an Apple Pencil (2nd gen) will be used for this process.\n\n## Rationale:\nThe use of an iPad Pro and Apple Pencil will allow for live-streaming of the mural painting process, as well as for capturing high-quality photos and footage for promotional purposes. We'll use it to put mock-ups together and it will help a lot in the creative process. This will provide a more immersive experience for audiences and allow for greater exposure for the artists and their work.\n\n## Technical Specification:\nThe public API of the BBH x ART collection will be designed to ensure the security and accessibility of the NFTs. The collection will be hosted on a decentralized platform, providing a secure and trustworthy environment for transactions.\n\n### Note:\n\nThe total cost of the proposal is 15120€, including 900€ per month for the team, 1100€ per month for two murals and two canvases, 300€ per month for materials for artists to paint the murals and canvases, 100€ per month for base material for the paintings, and 20€ per month for NFT minting. The iPad Pro and Apple Pencil are included in the total asked, which is equivalent to 10,88 Eth (at 1400€).\n\nIf the initiative is able to secure sponsorship for the material, the funds related to the materials from the sponsored brand will not be used and will be credited to the initiative.\n\nI (Mesk) will be selecting the artists and will start by inviting some of my closest friends, and also some of the best street artists in the scene. The idea is for this project to be sustainable so I also have close contact with some paint suppliers and I'll try to get them to sponsor the project so that it doesn't need to keep asking BBH for funding.\n\nI have high expectations for this and these 6 months are just the first step, much more to come, but let's get this started first so that we can show what we bears can put together.\n\nWe've already found a space in a warehouse where we can control the lights and sound, weather conditions, and other variables for the mural painting in order to get the best possible result when recording the process and creating the NFT itself.\n\nThe rental fee for this space isn't being considered in the proposal and won't be, as it is a courtesy of the team who wants to see this moving forward.\n\nlast edit on 2/14 \n\nChatGPT was used to help to formate the draft of this proposal.",

      "content": "Status: BIP \nAuthor(s): 21xHR#6726, defi jesus#2761\nDiscussions-to: [Create a new thread on https://commonwealth.im/buzzed-bear-hideout and drop the link here] \nCreated: 14 July 2022 \nRequires: [BIP number(s)] \nImplementation: [Added if BIP passes] ‌\n\n\nBuzzed Summary\nTo implement on-chain execution of Honeypot transactions based on Snapshot decisions to remove the need of multi signers.\nTo include built-in Snapshot vote delegation.\n\n\nAbstract\nIf the BIP is implemented, the Zodiac Reality Module will be added and configured both on Gnosis and Snapshot. As a consequence, it will be possible to configure a Snapshot so that the outcome of the vote will trigger an on-chain transaction.  \n\n\nMotivation ‌\n\nMotivation 1\nTo further decentralize the BBH DAO and fully decentralize the Honeypot. \n\nMotivation 2\nAddress doubts about founders controlling funds.\n\nMotivation 3\nAddress problems regarding multi signers availability.\n\nMotivation 4\nTo clarify the Honeypot management system\n\nMotivation 5\nTo further protect the funds\n\nMotivation 6\nTo improve the speed of the transaction and hence the distribution of funds towards the committee and their respective multisig POD wallets\n\nMotivation 7\nTo incentivize the effective implementation of the committees and associated multisig wallets. \n\nSpecification Overview\n\nHere are the specification of the Zodiac Reality module: \nA Snapshot vote can be tied to one or more transactions that automatically execute depending on the vote outcome. \nMultisig and signatures are only needed to verify that transactions are not malicious and meet the DAO policies. \nOne of the highest levels of decentralization for portfolio management. \nMoney moves itself after the vote. \nEveryone has a panic button and can contradict a proposal. \n\nThe process has as much delay as we want.\nWe chose a multi-sig as a safeguard option meaning that all transactions will be executed via the Snapshot module but multisig owners AK the security council will have the ability to veto malicious actions or act quickly in the case of an emergency. \nIt should be emphasized that the multisig owners will only have the ability to veto transactions and won’t be able to directly make transactions. \n\nThe process is as follow: \nA Snapshot is set up with an associated transaction. \nThe holders can see the details of the associated transaction. \nThe holders vote on an outcome.  \nThe Snapshot has an outcome. \nExecution request by any voter associated with a required bond (see technical specifications).\nTimeout period. \n*Any voter can dispute the execution by putting twice the initial bond.\n*If no one disputes the transaction, the process continues.\nOutcome finalized.\nCooldown period.\nTransaction executed.\n\nSnapshot delegation compatible\nThis module is entirely compatible with the Snapshot vote delegation system. \n\n\nRationale ‌\nThere have been concerns about the lack of decentralization of the honeypot and about the founders still having their hands on the funds. Moreover, some community members previously on the Gnosis removed themselves from their signer role. As a consequence, it is clear that a proposal should be made to review the Honeypot management.  \nBesides the lack of decentralization, concerns have been raised regarding accountability and speed when taking action on behalf of the community. Regarding the lack of decentralization and accountability: this system allows the community itself to decide how the funds will be used and will provide the transparency needed to address these concerns. Regarding the lack of speed: This module allows setting up a time after which the transaction should be executed (see specifications). To further protect the Honeypot, moving its funds should be a simple yet slow paced task. As a consequence this proposal will push the implementation of the committees and the related multisig wallets within which the funds will move faster. \nThere seems to be a consensus around the fact that the community shall have its hands on the funds and that these funds and the related transactions should be overseen, unbiased  and managed in a transparent manner. \nMany objections from decisions come from the ideas of the founders keeping their hands on the Honeypot and this solution allows for a full decentralization of the Honeypot management hence wiping out these concerns by allowing the community itself to have full power over its highest level of funds, the Honeypot. \nAlso, the low engagement on Snapshot vote which is a common problem in many DAOs reduces the speed of execution. This will easily be addressed with the ability to delegate his voting power which is quite common in the DAO framework and has also been requested in the past. \n\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\n\nImplementation\nThe Zodiac Reality Module will be added and configured both on Gnosis and Snapshot by defi jesus#2761 who will personally cover the associated gas transaction fees.  \nThe documentation and all the steps required to set this module up can be found here: \nhttps://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-module-reality/get-started\nAnother article covering the combination of Snapshot and Gnosis can be found here: \nhttps://blog.gnosis.pm/introducing-safesnap-the-first-in-a-decentralized-governance-tool-suite-for-the-gnosis-safe-ea67eb95c34f\n\n\nFollowing the approval of this proposal,\nA dedicated “#security council” channel will be created within the BBH Discord\nA Discord announcement will be made to invite holders to self nominate specifying the requirements (see below)\nWithin the dedicated Discord channel, each volunteer will post the following information and only these using this template: \nUsername: \nEthereum address:\nA brief Crypto/NFT experience and knowledge: \nA short text on what makes them a good candidate to be on the security council \nA #small-announcement will be made each day over a five days period following the approval of the proposal to remind the ability to apply as a security council member. \n\n\nSetting up parameters\nhttps://imgur.com/a/8Nr2hrQ\nTimeout: period between the first execution request regarding a specific outcome and the cooldown period\n⇒ 48 hours\nCooldown: Duration required before the transaction can be executed (after the timeout has expired).\n⇒ 48 hours\nExpiration: Duration that a transaction is valid.\n⇒ 168 hours (7 days)\nBond: Minimum bond required for the execution request to be accepted. New answers must be submitted with double the previous bond. \n⇒ 20 BBH tokens\nTo be noted:\nThe following parameters imply the minimum duration for the whole process will be 5 days, 3 days Snapshot vote + 2 days Cooldown if the execution is made instantly after the end of the Snapshot voting period.\n\n\nIf there is a dispute over the execution of a transaction\nAny voter can contest an execution by putting in double the amount of the initial bound. Anyone can then counter this contestation and this can go as long as there will be someone with enough funds to contradict the decision.\nIf no one contradicts the dispute, the transaction won’t be executed. \n\n\nIn terms of security\nThis module has proved to be effective in multiple established DAO such as Aragon DAO, DAOHaus & Moloch DAO.\n\n\nSnapshot built-in delegation system\nUpon approval of this proposal the Snapshot built-in delegation system will be activated by defi jesus#2761 and regular announcement will be made to invite holders to use that function while explaining its perks. \n\n\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.

      "content": "Status: Proposal\n\nAuthor(s): 21xHR#6726\n\nCreated: June 25th 2022\n\nDiscussions: Comment below\n\nImplementation: Immediate\n\nBuzzed Summary\nThis proposal is to allocate funds to seek for legal advice on the best way to execute a rescission offer to be deemed having acted in good faith.\n\nAbstract\nIn their letter, the legal counsel advised the DAO to execute a rescission offer to cut the founders from being legally liable to the US minters.\n\nGiven the legal framework surrounding digital assets is a new and evolving body of law, the SEC is unable to provide definitive guidance on how to conduct a rescission offer in this specific context.\n\nIt appears that, nonetheless, to be deemed having taken proper actions in order to be considered having executed the rescission offer in good faith, the DAO should at least seek for legal advice on how to conduct a rescission offer.\n\nMotivation\nMotivation #1\n\nTo prepare for the execution of the rescission offer\n\nMotivation #2\n\nTo research further on how to properly execute the rescission offer\n\nMotivation #3\n\nTo supplement our view on how to properly execute a rescission offer\n\nMotivation #4\n\nTo be deemed having executed the rescission offer in good faith\n\nSpecification Overview\nThe DAO will be allocating up to 10k USD to pursue the investigation on the best way to execute the rescission offer.\nThe DAO representatives will be interacting with the legal counsel through mail and report to the DAO.\n\nRationale\nAs stated above, given the legal framework surrounding digital assets is a new and evolving body of law, the SEC is unable to provide definitive guidance on how to conduct a rescission offer in this specific context.\n\nIf we choose to execute the rescission offer as we think is best, there is a possibility we miss a key aspect of the needs when it comes to executing a traditional rescission offer.\n\nAlso, as the DAO already started seeking for legal advice and as the rescission offer has been suggested by the lawyer themselves, not seeking for further advice on how to properly execute the rescission offer could be seen as acting in bad faith.\n\nRegarding this, it is much preferable the DAO seeks for legal advice before executing the rescission offer to ensure and higher the probabilities of having its execution considered as having been executed in good faith.\n\nTechnical Specification ‌\nThe DAO representatives will send the legal counsel the following proposal - [BBH - BIP execution of the rescission offer - final - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CkR1SYm6IsB3L4591utFqXJN1vqWAgo1q8kiMn4HTss/edit?usp=sharing), and ask how to optimise its execution in order to be deemed having acted in good faith.\n\nThe DAO representative will report to BBH holders in regards the received feedbacks.\n\nPayment for these legal costs will be made by a DAO representative, up to a maximum USD value of $10k. Reimbursement for these legal expenses will be paid from the honeypot.\n\nThe following will be the actual execution of the rescission offer as proposed in the following document - [BBH - BIP execution of the rescission offer - final - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CkR1SYm6IsB3L4591utFqXJN1vqWAgo1q8kiMn4HTss/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nCopyright ‌\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

According to what @CryptoChicca and @Hacktivist.eth said previously, after interviewing all the candidates, these two were the most prominent among all.\nILusive Sam is already working with BBH for a while, and Dayolatunji was the one being suggested on May 1st.\nOn the last voice-meeting on April 13th (available at General meeting 2022-05-13 - YouTube) this topic was addressed and the candidates presented themselves.\nTheir views and opinions may be consulted by persons that weren’t attending, and these persons are still on our discord server, available to address any questions about their skills and plans.\nThe candidates shall keep up with tasks presented next paragraph, and the option currently is to have Dayolatunji as a community lead and iLusive sAm as operational lead, synergizing efforts when necessary. The tasks shall be fulfilled but are not exclusive, being the following list a reference for discussion before the BIP.\n\nDayolatunji:\nLead bears within discord\nSocial engager and communicator within discord\nCommunicator through other BBH outlets\n\niLusive sAm:\nOrganizing discord and community events\nCheck ins with honeypot manager and help communication with bears\nLead for giveaways\nSharing information across all teams\n\nBOTH:\nSupport moderators,active team and project teams to achieve goals\nAnd such other tasks as may be needed as community manager\n\nThe suggested payment as of present day is 1200 US dollars monthly to each, payed in ETH.\n\nMotivation\nFrom several months now, there is a community sentiment regarding the lack of an official Community Manager.\nThe process was initiated and it’s imperative that BBH keeps their commitments fulfilled.\n\nSpecification Overview\nThe appointment can be effective immediately after the correspondent BIP is approved.\nCurrent moderators and founders shall help the appointees on eventual early difficulties navigating our microclimate, and also assist providing any info necessary to fulfil their roles/tasks.\n\nRationale\nKeeping up, in an effective way, with the tasks pointed in Abstract, has proved to be very difficult with current human resources available. The appointment of these two persons can improve internal communication and organization.\n\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

Also it’s too much work or expectation for mods who are also helping in many other areas.\n\nHacktivist.eth and I interviewed several candidates for the position of Community Manager. As part of this process, we have identified multiple people that can step into roles within the BBH. We believe that Dayo will be the perfect person to fill a role of Discord Community Manager. Dayo has prior experience in a Community Manager role. He showed good people skills, and written skills, coming from a copywriter background. He demonstrated good integrity when dealing with a compromising position and handled himself very well in the interview, also demonstrating his ability to think on his feet and handle multiple tasks and questions at once.\n\nDiana was our community manager and we went to snapshot (bip-023) and agreed to appoint a community manager to take the pressure off mods and others so we don’t burn out our good bears. We also need a community manager to drive things and lead the mod and bear liaison team. It’s a substantial job keeping track of everything. It is probably more than a 1 person job, but we are going to start with a community leader, and keep the position open in the event we need to appoint further community managers, for example, either a half position, or someone to help lead more on the operational side while Dayo leads the discord and the people leadership side. This could be an option if required, in either event we need to break it into two areas to help support bear needs as we grow.\n\nCompensation for this position has been negotiated at $1200 USD per month based on Dayo’s skills and experience to be paid from the honeypot on a monthly basis. Please vote if you want this to go to BIP.\n\nTasks will include include\n\n1. Lead bears within discord\n2. Support mods and founders and project teams to achieve goals\n3. Social engager and communicator within discord\n4. Communicator through other BBH outlets\n5. Lead for giveaways\n6. Sharing information across all teams\n7. Check ins with honeypot manager and help communication with bears\n8. Organizing discord and community events\n9. And such other tasks as may be needed as community manager\n\nSpecification ‌ Overview ‌\n1. Interviews have been conducted\n2. To commence asap and pro rata payment for the first month at the end of April (or May depending on voting timeframe).\n3. Another community manager or two may be appointed at a later date depending on required need to support bears so this position will remain open\nThis does not affect BIP-023. This proposal is to add a position for Discord Community Manager.\n\nRationale ‌\n1. The reasons for this proposal are:\n2. Promoting good governance for the Buzzed Bear Hideout brand\n3. Providing risk management to Buzzed Bear holders\n4. Helping implement initiatives for Buzzed Bears\n\nTechnical Specification ‌\nFounders, Mods and Liaison to help train the community manager in bear related knowledge\n\nTest Cases ‌\nAlmost every NFT project has at least one community manager if not two to cover off on timezones\n\nCopyright ‌\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0",

      "content": "Status: Proposal Author(s): Alpacachad\n\nCreated: 15 April 2022\n\nDiscussions-to: https://gov.buzzedbearhideout.com/t/honeypot-manager-reappointment/715\n\nImplementation (optional): Immediate. ‌\n\nBuzzed Summary\nLet’s appoint a new Honeypot Manager\n\nAbstract ‌\nBBH needs an active honeypot manager to oversee and manage the honeypot funds. The current honeypot manager has not been active.\n\nBuzzed Bears have over $1M in the DAO, and are making moves to implement the investment strategy (BIP-003). In order to do this, transactions are required, and it is hard to follow how much is available to spend in each category, or earned / accumulated in each category etc. There are also transaction fees for gas that need to be accounted for.\n\nThis person will need to have skills in crypto, finance, auditing, record keeping and preferably defi, although this aspect can be trained. Ideally this position will not only perform record keeping and account for transactions, profit and expenses, but they will also manage the input/output of funds into sEth (for example) in the def space, to facilitate that aspect of the investment strategy. This should be fairly minor once implemented, save for when funds are needed to be pulled out. Ideally long term, this person may look to stake and facilitate loans for Buzzed Bears to better manage use of funds and limit Eth transaction / gas fees.\n\nThis is an important role to support everyone and should be rewarded as such. Remuneration should be paid via the rewards process.\n\nAny interested bears should put their hands up and express their interest.\n\nMotivation ‌\nThe more progress Buzzed Bears make, the more transactions Buzzed Bears make. Having regard to the initial split of funds, it was easy to determine what funds fell into what categories. As we are now taking profits on certain ventures, and flipping, and investing in pools, it will mean we need to account for allocations and need someone to manage this so we know how much we have in each of the investment areas, and whether there are new funds available to allocate to other ventures.\n\nAlso, without a honeypot manager, bears are exposed to risk in not knowing exactly what is available to be spent, and we want to ensure we protect honeypot funds.\n\nSpecification ‌ Overview ‌\n1. Appoint a new honeypot manager - return to BIP for final vote\n2. This person will preferably have skills in crypto, finance, auditing, record keeping and preferably defi, although this aspect can be trained.\n\nRationale ‌\nThe reasons for this proposal are:\n1. Promoting good governance for the Buzzed Bear Hideout brand\n2. Providing risk management to Buzzed Bear holders\n3. Helping committee funds management revenue for Buzzed Bears\n4. Assisting in growth of the defi section of the investment proposal.\n\nTechnical Specification ‌\nThis person should have most of the skills to facilitate the outcomes required. Defi training may be able to be provided by some bear members if this aspect requires learning.\n\nTest Cases ‌\nAll good businesses have a treasury and someone to manage it, so let’s get moving.\n\nCopyright ‌\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

      "title": "BIP-022 - DCL Wearables for Bear Holders",
      "content": "Status: Proposal Author(s): CryptoChicca #Mesk85\n\nCreated: 27 February 2022\n\nDiscussions-to: Comment below please\n\nImplementation (optional): Immediate. ‌\n\nBuzzed Summary\n\nTo approve a wearable (x2) for DCL and payment / reimbursement for the wearable (x2) and provide every bear wallet holder with a bear head and hoodie & paws.\n\nAbstract ‌\n\nBuzzed Bears have land in the Decentraland metaverse, and part of that experience is suiting up with wearables to enjoy the experience and show of your 'bearness' to other players.\n\nA bear head and ‘hoodie and paws’ has been designed and constructed for Decentraland in conjunction with BBH Art team, and this proposal is to provide these wearables (two pieces) to every bear holder.\n\nIt is proposed that we issue 10,000 of each of these. We are just shy of 3000 holders so this will provide more options for when we have additional holders to provide these as incentive / giveaways at later dates. They will also be resealable on the dcl marketplace for any BBH holder that receives them.\n\nYes there are images, but I am opting for the element of surprise! You know the quality of our art team, so lets just say they are phenomenal.\n\nWe have MANA in our wallet to be able to pay for this.\n\nSpecification ‌ Overview ‌\n\n1. Create new wallet for BBH wearables\n2. Register DCL BBH Bear Head and Hoodie and paws wearable\n3. Reimburse costs (anticipated around 100 MANA (circa 300USD) per registration (so 200 MANA total) plus 40 MANA for the 3D artist, plus a small amount of polygon for the transfers.\n4. CryptoChicca to organise the above, noting that the 3D artist for the wearable has been paid (wasn’t me on this one)\n5. First 10 wearables of each to be minted to the BBH wearable wallet so that we keep them as a DAO in the event that the wearables are considerably valuable at a later date.\n6. Snapshot to be taken after the wearables have been published, and distribution will occur to every bear wallet holder. So if you have all your bears in the one wallet, you will receive one set. \n\nRationale ‌\n\nThe reasons for this proposal are:\n\n1. Promoting brand exposure for the Buzzed Bear Hideout\n\n2. Providing benefits to holders of Buzzed Bear holders\n\n3. Providing connection for buzzed bear holders\n\nTechnical Specification ‌\n\n@cryptochicca to register the wearable and @defijesus or @buzzedmo to organise snapshot and to mint to Buzzed Bear holder wallets. There should not be a cost to mint to wallets as its on polygon, and I mint wearables to multiple wallets without a cost, so not expecting there to be a cost, and if so, it will be insignificant. \n\nTest Cases ‌\n\nSo many brands have wearables, they are linked to metaverse. We have land in DCL.\n\nCopyright ‌\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0\n\n\n",

      "content": "Status: BIP\nProposal Author: n00bleLAND\nCreated: 7 January 2021\nImplementation: Immediate. ‌\n\nBuzzed Summary\n\nDissolve the NFT Investment Committee and reallocate the remaining eth to other initiatives.\n\n**Abstract**\nThere have been three different proposals in the forum to dissolve the Investment Committee with different solutions regarding what to do with the remaining NFTs and funds. This is to confirm the dissolution of the Committee and to reallocate the funds to other initiatives. After discussion in the governance forum (https://gov.buzzedbearhideout.com/t/dissolve-investment-committee-tropofarmer-and-gfunk/654) the following conclusions are proposed:\n1. Dissolve the Investment Committee\n2. Put the NFTs currently in the Investment Committee wallet under the jurisdiction of the NFT Flipping Committee\n3. Re-allocate the remaining funds according to the following specification:\n- Marketing Committee: 20%\n- DeFi Investments: 13.33%\n- NFT Flipping Committee: 26.67%\n- Metaverse Committee: 33.33%\n- Crypto Committee: 6.67%\n\n**Specification ‌ Overview ‌**\nIt has been a few months since we passed BIP-003 with an original intention to simplify the honeypot allocations in an investment strategy, allowing:\n\n30% Metaverse Committee\n20% Investment Committee\n10% Community NFT Fund\n20% Defi\n20% Spending Reserve\n\nCurrently there is approximately 15.5 eth remaining in the Investment Committee Wallet as well as 8 NFTs (https://zapper.fi/account/0x3b762b6a03b5a0772c2d64e1d05e5b77d841c0b4)\n\nThe three previous proposals to dissolve the Investment Committee are listed here:\nVote to Disband The Investment Committee (https://gov.buzzedbearhideout.com/t/vote-to-disband-the-investment-comitte/577/4)\nDissolve IC and Create Automated Crypto Trading Investment with Unlisted.io (https://gov.buzzedbearhideout.com/t/dissolve-ic-and-create-automated-crypto-trading-investment-with-unlisted-io/644)\nVary Investment Strategy - dissolve investment committee and fund crypto committee (https://gov.buzzedbearhideout.com/t/vary-investment-strategy-dissolve-investment-committee-and-fund-crypto-committee/607/6)\n\nThe following are the results of the voting from the governance forum:\n\nShould we disband the Investment Committee:\n95% - Yes\n5% - No\n\nWhat should we do with the NFTs that are currently in the Investment Committee wallet?\n67% - Hodl the NFTs and put them under the jurisdiction of the NFT Flipping Committee\n33% - Keep NFTs in current wallet and categorize them as “Long Term Hodls”\n0% - Liquidate and start anew\n\nWhat should we do with the funds that are currently in the Investment Committee wallet?\nThere is currently approximately 15.5 eth remaining in the IC wallet. The options for reallocation include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n32% - Split between multiple committees (please specify in comments)\n21% - Send to DeFi allocation\n21% - Send to Marketing Committee\n16% - Send to NFT Flipping Committee\n10% - Send to Metaverse Committee\n\nSince the split was the choice with the highest votes, it is proposed to split the funds among multiple committees. Due to the complexity of this answer, the sentiments were taken from the comments that were expressed in the forum. Those were counted and the proposed re-allocation is based on the percentage of votes each committee recieved in the comments section only.\n\n**Rationale** ‌\nThe reasons for this proposal are:\n- Continued questioning of Investment Committee’s effectiveness\n- Adjust previous strategy that is not creating expected output\n\n**Technical Specification** ‌\n- Confirm vote to dissolve Investment Committee via Snapshot vote.\n- Use governance forum to re-allocate remaining funds\n\n**Test Cases** ‌\nBears have proven that they can manage investment strategies better than these external parties, especially with vested interest i nthe success of the Hideout. There have been net losses from the Investment Committee to date, and calls for more active account management.\n\nCopyright ‌\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

Given bears operate 24/7, this will help with efficiency in supporting necessary transactions.\n\nIt is also proposed to add @n00ble to the NFT flipping wallets to help facilitate the buying and selling of NFTs. That will make 4 multisig for those wallets, alongside @SQX10, @loop and @DefiJesus\n\nSpecification ‌ Overview ‌\n1. Add @n00bleLAND as multisig to increase people that can sign transactions for Buzzed Bear Hideout to 6 people for the honeypot wallet.\n2. Increase multisig process from 2 to 3 people required per transaction for the honeypot wallet. While this may take a little longer, this is best to safeguard the funds.\n3. @n00bleLAND will also be added to the NFT flipping wallets to help facilitate the buying and selling of NFTs. There will be 2 signatures required for this purpose due to the need to process these transactions quicker and 2 out of 3 apex leads are only required for a decision in NFT flipping in accordance with the NFT flipping protocols already in place.\n\nRationale ‌\nThe reasons for this proposal are:\n1. Promoting good governance for the Buzzed Bear Hideout brand\n2. Providing risk management to Buzzed Bear holders\n3.

      "title": "BIP-017 Bear Buy Back Program",
      "content": "Proposal Authors: Jimpson, n00bleLAND & CryptoChicca\n\nDiscussions-to: Bear Fund - Proposal 1\n\nCreated: 6 December 2021\n\nRequires: BIP\n\nBuzzed Summary\n\nThis proposal is to implement a system which enables the BBH DAO to gain upside from a Bear buyback and also provide an avenue for those Bear holders seeking to sell their Bear for immediate liquidity.\n\nAbstract ‌\n\nBBH DAO currently does not own any bears, so it does not have exposure to the DAO’s upside. As a long term project, BBH DAO should invest in its own success.\n\nFurther, there has been listing below the mint price, and undercutting, causing a drop in the floor. Many bears have requested the BBH DAO buy floor bears to fix the floor.\n\nThis proposal is not suggesting a buyback program to fix the floor, but instead a sustainable long term program, to both reinvest in the Bears, and provide an avenue to enable those wanting quick liquidity to get a guaranteed minimum value. This shall be known as the Bear Fund, as coined by @Jimpson.\n\nThe Bear Fund will be made up of two “parts.” One part will be where floor bears are accumulated, and the other will be a liquidity pool that will hold Ethereum used to purchase bears from those looking to sell. The buyback price of the bears will be calculated based on the equity value of one bear (defined as Total Value of the Honeypot/9,999).\n\nIt is expected that this process will be able to automated mid Q1 2022 with tech coming out from XMON.\n\nMotivation\n\nProviding liquidity to Bear holders that require it quickly.\nProviding an avenue for the BBH DAO to accumulate good value bears to either sell at a higher price or hold for future\nThere have been multiple proposals prior to this shoing considerable support. Earlier proposals referenced here:\n\nContinuous Buy-Back & Burn Program \n (https://gov.buzzedbearhideout.com/t/continuous-buy-back-burn-program/240)\n\nBear Fund - Proposal (https://gov.buzzedbearhideout.com/t/bear-fund-proposal/599)\n\nUse Treasury to Buy Back Bears Below Mint (https://gov.buzzedbearhideout.com/t/use-treasury-to-buy-back-bears-below-mint/101)\n\nSpecification ‌ Overview ‌\n\nBuyback Price Calculation:\n\nThere will be a Maximum Buyback Price that will be calculated as 20% below the equity value of one Bear.\n\nThe following is an example of how the repurchase price will be calculated.\n\nIf the current valuation of the honeypot is approximately $1M and there are 9,999 Bears, that means each Bear’s equity value is $1,000,000/9,999. This comes to approximately $100 per bear or .024eth at a valuation of $4,150/eth at the time of writing. At a 20% discount of the equity value, that would mean that the Hideout would repurchase Bears for .0192eth.\n\nBy this logic, any Bear purchased under the designated value (i.e. 0.24 Eth) would be purchased at a discount, and thus profitable for the Honeypot. Although this would mean that the seller would take a slight loss, that loss would be equivalent to the convenience of having the ability to immediately liquidate their bear holdings. The strike price will be regularly adjusted to reflect the total value of the honeypot.\n\nListing fees:\n\nListing fees will be paid by the seller. So, in the case of the Hideout purchasing a floor bear, the seller will pay the gas fee. In the case of the Hideout selling a repurchased Bear, the Hideout will pay the listing fee.\n\nLiquidity Pool:\n\nThe Honeypot currently holds 92eth. We can expect that a large portion of this may be eaten up after the initial passing of this proposal. Moving forward, we will be able to have a more accurate forecast for expected redemption of this offer. This will enable a dedicated allocation of ether to be reserved for this mechanism.\n\n*In the extremely unlikely event that all Bears want to liquidate, investment positions will have to be liquidated in order to accommodate all requests. However, with the 20% buyback price discount, 20% of the Honeypot will remain, minus listing fees.\n\nBuyback Mechanism:\n\nIt is proposed to establish the Bear Fund as an automated platform that can be accessed at all times. A mechanism of this kind is expected to be available to the Bears in late January 2022.\n\nSelling DAO-Owned Bears:\n\nThe bears re-purchased by the Hideout could be resold on OpenSea at a 50% premium from the re-purchasing price or the original mint price (.05eth), whichever is larger. This would cover gas costs, offer the Honeypot an economic gain, and raise the floor price of the Bears.\n\nFormula with example can be found here: https://gov.buzzedbearhideout.com/t/bear-buy-back-program/630\n\nBBH DAO-owned Bears:\n\nBears purchased through this arrangement would sit in a DAO owned wallet. These bears would not be eligible for voting thus affecting the voting quorum. This will be adjusted to reflect 8% of the total number of Bears that are held by the public, not including the Bears held by the DAO. (Example: if the DAO owns 200 bears then the amount in circulation will be 9,799. That would mean for a proposal to pass it would require that 800 votes be counted, which is 8% of the outstanding bears.)\n\nQuality Assurance:\n\nIt is proposed that the Honeypot Manager will periodically monitor this process to ensure quality assurance of all processes.\n\nRationale ‌\n\nBBH DAO should invest in its own success and currently does not have exposure to that success.\nBear holders sometimes require immediate liquidity so this program enables a quick exit for holders should they require.\nTechnical Specification ‌\n\nA platform is currently under development for release in late January that would enable this proposal to be implemented. Further details of that project will be advised in due course. This proposal should work through governance protocol and get feedback and refinement with the view to commencing upon the project’s launch in late January.\nA liquidity pool must be maintained in order to fill all sell orders.\nHoneypot Manager to periodically assess accuracy and integrity of mechanism.\nTest Cases ‌\n\nThis is a new proposal initiative, which takes into account the past success of projects like NFTX.io, and also the great feedback received via Jimpson’s governance proposal Bear Fund buy back scheme.\n\nCopyright ‌\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

      "title": "BIP-016 Hibernation, Honeypot Distribution and Voting",
      "content": "Hibernation, Distribution and Voting Amendments\n\nStatus: Draft Proposal\n\nCo-Author(s): @Mesk85 @DefiJesus @n00bleLAND and @CryptoChicca\n\nCreated: 6 December 2021\n\nImplementation: Immediate\n\nBuzzed Summary\n\nThis proposal is to postpone the implementation of bear locking (‘hibernation’) and distribution of honeypot funds for reasons described in here.\n\nAbstract ‌\n\nBuzzed Bear Hideout is a unique brand that establishes itself with a DAO. Its original intention was that every bear gets a vote (“1 bear = 1 vote”) and that there would be bear locking and distribution from the honeypot to all bear holders.\n\nOf the original intention for Buzzed Bears, neither locking nor distribution has been finalized, albeit there have been questions raised in discord and the governance hideout, to move these aspects forward.\n\nIn respect of the distribution to bears, the general consensus from the community has been that they want to see the honeypot grow before any distribution, so that when distributions commence, they are self sustaining and will not erode the honeypot, thus enabling it to keep growing.\n\nDefiJesus recently held a Q&A with available bears around these two topics, asking what bears would like to do moving forward. There was a question raised as to whether a distribution of profits would trigger SEC legislation from some bears. The general view of those on the call was that Buzzed Bears should get legal advice before distributing to bears, given the large majority of US bear holders, so that it stays within laws to which it is accountable. It is proposed therefore that there be no distribution to bears until legal advice from a proper counsel like Fenwick (who are providing advice to other NFT groups like BAYC) is obtained.\n\nFinally, following the QnA, two proposals have been put up in the hideout around the matter of bear locking. Firstly, a summary of the QnA (Hibernation - Next steps 1) and secondly, a proposal to move forward with the bear locking (Hibernation - locking your bear). There has been considerable feedback provided both formally and informally across discord and the hideout, and it has become clear that whilst the intention of bears is to hibernate, the technology to do so must be sustaining, and the most appropriate course of action is to move Buzzed Bears to locking and layer 2 in one transaction, meaning all future transactions will be with little to no gas fees. However, given there is no market identified leader in layer 2 protocol at this point of time, the most sensible approach is to postpone the locking until such time as this occurs.\n\nThis proposal therefore is :\n\n1. There will be no bear locking at this current time\n2. In future, bear locking will be proposed when a layer 2 protocol is determined suitable to ensure success of the Buzzed Bears brand and provide a path forward where gas is not a prohibitive requirement for bear holders.\n3. Legal advice will be sought regarding distribution to bear holders prior to the establishment of any distribution proposal. A distribution proposal should come back through governance and BIP at a later date. Payment of this advice shall come from the spending reserve and is undetermined at this point in time.\n4. Reduce the quorum of voting in BIP to 8% of the total number of bears, until such time as bear locking is implemented.\n\nMotivation\n\n1. Addressing requests around two key elements of the advertised Buzzed Bears project\n2. Obtaining legal advice to ensure BBH DAO stays within laws to the fullest extent possible to protect those signing transactions on behalf of BBH DAO and also the community in receiving any funding from the honeypot\n3. Listening to concerns raised by community members and provide a pathway forward to address those concerns\n4. Providing a voting structure that supports those bears that are invested in the DAOs success\n\nSpecification ‌ Overview ‌\n\nBear Locking & Gas\n\n1. No locking to occur at the present time\n2. Proposal for bear locking to be revisited when a suitable layer 2 solution is cemented\n\nThere has been considerable feedback received that the cost of gas is prohibitive for both small and whale holders of Buzzed Bears. Given Buzzed Bears are on the Ethereum network, there is no way around this, while on layer 1. Therefore, there will be no locking implemented at this point in time, as the intention is to benefit bears, not hinder growth. Given the feedback around the price of gas, it has been suggested by many to move to a layer 2 solution. At the moment, there are a number of layer 2 vying for the prime position, and it is unclear the best avenue forward. Therefore, the proposal is to postpone the bear locking until the layer 2 solution is more clear. Then, a proposal will be revisited for locking of bears, and moving to a layer 2 network, in the same transaction. It will be proposed that the honeypot cover the cost of this transaction for bears holders.\n\nHoneypot distribution\n\n1. No distribution until legal advice is obtained and a pathway forward determined\n\nAt this point in time, the majority of bear holders have expressed a desire to continue to grow the honeypot. BBH DAO will seek legal advice on the distribution of honeypot to bear holders, to ensure it is operating within applicable laws. BAYC have recently sought advice from Fenwick lawyers for the implementation of a token system and Buzzed Bears are awaiting a meeting to progress an answer to this distribution question. Buzzed Bears will seek advice on the best method to move forward, and will report back to the community on this once it has been obtained, with a pathway to implementation. By the time the community seeks to distribute, the answers for this legal question should be well known.\n\nModified voting rights\n\n1. Ensuring sufficient quorum for voting by reducing the 10% requirement to 8%\n\nCurrently there are not many bears that participate in voting, and it is a struggle to meet the 10% voting requirement (1000 votes). However, of the proposals presented, they are more often that not voted in one direction close to if not 100% of votes. Therefore, to reduce stress on those active bear members who are voting, it is proposed to reduce the 10% voting requirement to 8%. This will mean that the voting requirement is 800 votes. This will ensure those bears invested and committed are able to progress proposals for the benefit of the DAO with less stress. A review of the voting quorum should occur when bear locking is implemented.\n\nRationale ‌\n\n1. Implementing bear locking will provide enhanced benefits to bears, but only when it can be done through a mechanism which doesn’t impact bear holders. The layer 2 solution makes sense, but it is sensible to determine the market leader and move in that direction.\n2. We have people working daily on the DAO that live in wildly different countries with different legislations but a majority is concentrated in the US. As community members take up more responsibility they also take on any extra possible liability. So in order to make sure we keep our bears protected and the future of our community protected we must show our willingness to abide by the applicable laws and consult with industry leading law firms like Fenwick.\n3. There is generally a scramble to get voting for proposals even when they pass with 100%. This creates stress on members, and doesn’t help facilitate good DAO outcomes. Reducing the voting quorum will enable proper consideration, and rigour but with less stress. More voting by bear members is welcomed and recommended also.\n\nTechnical Specification ‌\n\n1. Wait for appointment with Fenwick legal counsel (or suitable alternative) regarding DAO distribution. Payment for this legal advice and appointment to come from the spending reserves bucket of the honeypot.\n2. Continue to review layer 2 solution for the moving of Buzzed Bears for locking.\n\nTest Cases ‌\n\nThere are many groups that have both locking and tokens/distribution. Many are doing so without consulting legal advice. BAYC are in the process of obtaining legal advice with the view to implement a token. This will be a test case as they are consulting Fenwick. BBH DAO will seek to get legal advice from this firm to determine the steps forward.\n\nCopyright ‌\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

In order to do this, transactions are required, and it is hard to follow how much is available, left to spend in each category, or earnt / built up in each category etc. There are also transaction fees for gas that need to be accounted for and reimbursed.\n\nThis person will need to have skills in crypto, finance, audit, record keeping and preferably defi, although this aspect can be trained. Ideally this position will not only record keep and account for transactions, profit and expenses, but they will also ideally manage the in/out of funds into sEth (for example) in the defi space, to facilitate that aspect of the investment strategy. This should be fairly minor once implemented, save for when funds are needed to be pulled out. Ideally long term, this person may look to stake and facilitate loans for Buzzed Bears to better manage use of funds and limit Eth transaction / gas fees.\n\nThis is an important role to support everyone and should be rewarded as such. Remuneration should be paid via the rewards process.\n\nAny interested bears should put their hands up and express their interest.\n\nBears have voted 94% in support of the proposal in the hideout, so this BIP is to move that proposal forward. As noted in the edit to that proposal, buzzed bears will first advertise and select a candidate. The final selection of the candidate and remuneration will be return to the hideout for discussion, before going to another BIP to confirm the selection.

Any initial feedback on the candidate or remuneration can be made during the hideout forum process to help refine if we need to go back to the candidate before proceeding to another BIP.\n\nMotivation ‌\nThe more progress Buzzed Bears make, means the more transactions Buzzed Bears make. Having regard to the initial split of funds, it was easy to determine what funds fell into what categories. As we are now taking profits on certain ventures, and flipping, and investing in pools, it will mean we need to account for allocations and need someone to manage this so we know how much we have in each of the investment areas, and whether there are new funds available to allocate to other ventures.\n\nAlso, without a honeypot manager, bears are exposed to risk in not knowing exactly what is available to be spent, and we want to ensure we protect honeypot funds.\n\nSpecification ‌ Overview ‌\n\nAppoint a honeypot manager\nThis person will need to have skills in crypto, finance, audit, record keeping and preferably defi, although this aspect can be trained.\n\nRationale ‌\nThe reasons for this proposal are:\n\n1.

      "content": "Discussions-to: metaverse discussion in discord, Entering the Metaverse (USE), Entering the Metaverse (WHAT / WHERE), and Entering the Metaverse (Part 3) refer https://gov.buzzedbearhideout.com/t/entering-the-metaverse-part-3/576\n\nCreated: 4 November 2021\n\nImplementation (optional): after successful vote\n\nBuzzed Summary\n\nBIP-003 approved investment through the following honeypot allocations:\n\n* 30% metaverse content\n* 20% NFTs (via Investment Committee)\n* 10% NFTs (via community proposals)\n* 20% DeFi Content\n* 20% Spending Reserves (as ETH)\n\nThis proposal aims to give implementation to the metaverse content.\n\nAbstract ‌\n\nMetaverse has been largely discussed in discord and the hideout. This short BIP pulls together the information discussed in those forums. Due to the significant increase in metaverse tokens and metaverse sales following the announcement of metaverse uptake by Facebook, it is important to act without further haste, to avoid bears missing out on further opportunity.\n\nBears have defined the goal / purpose for the metaverse through vote, as being a place for both socialisation and monetisation. This means it can be used as both a place to stream AMA/townhall, gallery for bears, a place to support a launchpad, merch, games and even potential future huts or caves for bears.\n\nOptions have been considered, and the Sandbox has presented as the best option to suit the use proposed. Having a 3x3 will allow our PFP to be displayed on the sandbox map, so we are easier to find, which helps with monetisation.\n\nOther land and MVI tokens should be considered to be purchased as part of the buzzed bear portfolio of metaverse options.\n\nMotivation\n\n1. Crypto is moving very fast, and metaverse tokens have 5x the past two weeks and we don’t want to miss further opportunity\n2. Metaverse will be the future for socialisation and monetisation\n3. There are limited land allotments and once they are all sold, land will become premium for the Sandbox\n4. Sandbox goes live Q1 2022, so we need to be in early before everyone jumps on board, including flippers who are currently keeping prices up in decentraland.\n\nSpecification ‌ Overview ‌\n\n1. We buy a 3x3 parcel of land in the sandbox (or equivalent blocks which add up to a 3x3 in the same area), either a secondary sale or a partnership option, whichever is most cost effective. At the time of writing, it is the secondary sale option. (price currently estimated between 11-20eth)\n2. We buy land in other metaverses as determined by voting within the metaverse discussion channel in discord. This may include a block within DCL, NFTWorlds, Matrix etc, but may be no further land if that is determined. Votes will go up, and a process will be implemented, following the successful approach of the NFT Flipping Committee.\n3. We approve the Apex Flip Leads to purchase the land (as they are NFTs) through their roles in the NFT Committee\n4. We buy such other metaverse tokens as determined by informal voting within the metaverse discussion discord, and we seek the multisig operators to implement this. This power will transferred to the Crypto Gods leading the Crypto Investment Committee should that BIP (currently in voting) pass. These should be treated as crypto assets and the care for buying and selling be taken to ensure bears investment is best maximised.\n5. We allocate approximately 3-5eth of the metaverse funding to the building of land (if required, noting this figure may change by informal vote within discord). Bears have shown a keen interest to build in the metaverse, so this may not be required, but in the event we wish to proceed, it will enable us to set up an incredible hideout with monetisation options including links to launchpad/merch\n\nRationale ‌\n\nThe reasons for this proposal are :\n\n1. Metaverse is the future for social interaction and also the hub to support business and monetisation, from gaming to launchpads and merch etc\n2. There is potential to grow the honeypot at a faster rate than it is currently growing.\n3. We have enough brain power and crypto experience in the Hideout that should not go to waste.\n4. Massive economic upside.\n5. Protection from loss when needing to enter / exit positions.\n\nTechnical Specification ‌\n\n1. The strategy to be governed by the metaverse committee\n2. The implementation to be governed by the NFT Flipping committee\n3. CryptoChicca to continue leading the metaverse committee, until voting is organsised within discord, similar to the NFT flipping committee, to give every bear an option to be part of the committee. There should be 3 bear members like the NFT flipping committee to help with governance.\n\nTest Cases ‌\n\nMany NFT groups have metaverse and it is essential for longevity\n\nCopyright ‌\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n\n",

      "content": "Status: Proposal Author(s): n00bleLAND & CryptoChicca\n\nDiscussions-to: A final version of the proposal is found in the hideout at the following link, and a condensed version is provided here due to word count limitations:  https://gov.buzzedbearhideout.com/t/crypto-investment-committee/573 \n\nCreated: 3 November 2021\n\nImplementation (optional): Immediate upon successful vote\n\nBuzzed Summary\n\nBIP-003 approved investment through the following honeypot allocations:\n\n* 30% metaverse content\n* 20% NFTs (via Investment Committee)\n* 10% NFTs (via community proposals)\n* 20% DeFi Content\n* 20% Spending Reserves (as ETH)\n\nTo give operational support to help implement the above strategies from BIP-003 we need a Crypto Investment Committee who can make decisions and implement those decisions. This proposal is to provide operational guidance / permission to help that initiative.\n\nAbstract ‌\n\nA Crypto Investment Committee will be formed to allow the investment (both short term and long term) into cryptocurrencies with funds from the Honeypot. Also this will help facilitate honeypot areas like Metaverse who require non-eth crypto in order to purchase land for the metaverse initiative. It will also enable an in house solution so that these matters can be acted on in a timely matter, as crypto moves fast.\n\nMotivation\n\nCurrently the Buzzed Bears are not exposed to the cryptocurrency market other than through its Metaverse investments with MVI token. This proposal aims to provide a way to gain exposure to the large upside that exists in the market, and approach it similarly to the functionality of the NFT Flipping Committee.\n\nRecently, BBH commenced a metaverse discussion and while working through that discussion the price of $SAND rose from .60 cents USD to over $3.00 USD. As there was no proposal yet in place to determine the strategic direction, no crypto was purchased. This is a missed opportunity. If there was a Crypto Investment Committee who were able to seek feedback from Bears and invest for the benefit of BBH, this could be avoided next time.\n\nAlso, this will help when we need to sell an asset as a vote can go up within discord to be acted on quickly. So this provides a protective mechanism to all Bears, so all decisions can be public and open. It also allows the Hideout to make the best decisions in the remainder of the bull run to give the Bears the best chance of monetary success over that time.\n\nSpecification ‌ Overview ‌\n\nIt is proposed to mirror the approach that has been approved for the NFT Flipping Committee as that was previously supported. It is therefore suggested that a discord channel be opened for bear crypto chatter and then one opened for bear crypto decisions. That way requests can go into chatter and decisions for voting can go into the decisions channel. It is also suggested that there should be leads for this, “Crypto Gods” that can initially commence with @DefiJesus @Mesk85 and @BuzzedMo who currently have multisig access, and be expanded to two other trusted community members, to enable the timely action of crypto decisions across all timezones. Voting for the two other members should take place within discord through a nomination process and then a subsequent BIP, following the recent successful approach with the NFT Flipping Committee Apex Leads.\n\nThe following are some suggestions on how procedure may work, pulled from the NFT Flipping Committee.  (Refer full proposal in hideout)\n\nRationale ‌\n\nThe reasons for this proposal are :\n\n1. There is potential to grow the honeypot at a faster rate than it is currently growing.\n2. We have enough brain power and crypto experience in the Hideout that should not go to waste.\n3. Massive economic upside.\n4. Protection from loss when needing to enter / exit positions.\n\nTechnical Specification ‌\n\nThis is an operational guidance proposal, to enable decisions to be made within the Crypto Investment Committee, as governed by the Crypto Gods. The Bears who request to be part of the Crypto Investment Committee can elect to hold a vote (not required) on the crypto asset ideas suggested in an informal way within the committee itself, whether by thumbs up/down, or as determined by the Crypto Gods to give best effectiveness to the outcome. The Crypto Gods will have the final decision to act on behalf of the committee keeping in mind the best interests of Bears and the popular community sentiment.\n\nThe following is the process for the initial election of the Crypto Gods (refer full proposal in hideout)\n\nTest Cases ‌\n\nRefer to full proposal in hideout\n\nCopyright ‌\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n\n",

To view the final proposal, click the above link for The First Brick 2.0.  \n\nApologies, proposal is being resubmitted due no announcement in BBH discord to enable all bears to see and vote. \n\nCreated: 09/09/2021\n\nImplementation: Immediate effect.\n\n1.0 - Buzzed Summary:\nThe proposal set forth here will define an organisational structure for the BBH. Designed with inspiration from the Index Coop, a proven and tested method of decentralised governance. This proposal will define the parameters for different working interest groups and their powers in relation to the BBH community and its resources.\n\n2.0 - Abstract:\nThe proposed change is to introduce titles for new working groups and broadly define their powers and responsibilities within the BBH community. If implemented, this proposal will lead to the creation of an official hierarchy, providing Bears with the structure and process they need to push forward their ideas. The proposed hierarchy is represented in the rudimentary figure detailed here: https://gov.buzzedbearhideout.com/t/bip-006-the-first-brick-2-0/566\n\n3.0 - Motivation:\nAs a community we have been bursting out with valuable and credible ideas that have the potential to further the BBH DAO. Unfortunately, it is rare that these ideas are followed through with. A large reason for this is that motivated community members lack the guidance and defined processes and procedures necessary to make their voices and ideas heard. This diminishes the effectiveness of the DAO and impedes upon our ability to accomplish community goals.\n\n4.0 - Specification Overview:\nWhat it is that the proposal will do to solve the problem will be detailed in this section.\n\n4.1 – Groups & Roles:\n\nThis is where the proposed working groups are defined and labelled. The labels are Pods, Committees and The Community. Please refer to the full proposal link for further explanation.\n\n4.2 – Responsibilities:\n\nIn this section, the minimum non-negotiable requirements from Pods and Committees are set out. All groups/roles will be required to operate in accordance with one simple principle:\n\nGrowth & Improvement: Whatever the goals are for your group, they must be designed to further the financial, strategic, or social interests of the BBH community and its members.\n\nPlease refer to the linked document for details of the minimum requirements for the Pods, Committees and The Community.\n\n4.3 - Limits & Power:\n\nThe powers sought by Committees must be adequately defined within the initial proposal. A committee operating outside of its remit may be disbanded following a community vote.\n\nAdditionally, the Community retains the right to end any working group at any time following the success of a community vote, irrespective of circumstances.\n\n4.4 - Remuneration:\n\nAll members that form a Committee are entitled to retroactive remuneration for their work and services to the BBH community. This work will be assessed for its impact to the BBH and appropriate remuneration will be distributed based upon that assessment.\n\nAt present, a potential remuneration / reward system being considered is Coordinape.com. This has the potential to make some minor changes to this proposal but those should be explained within the BIP that proposes Coordinape.\n\n5.0 - Rationale:\n\nThe proposal has been made because as a DAO we must protect ourselves from irresponsible use of community resources. After much consideration and discussion between the proposal team and even further conversation with our defi experts; we decided that a tiered group system enabling less restrictive oversight, but greater resource protection would be the ideal structure. This method would encourage more considered proposals that wish to utilise our resources but should also prevent voter fatigue from incessant, half-baked proposals.\n\nInitially our proposal was a much more rigid structure with a single working group (a committee). It was designed to establish rules for the formation of committees and their election processes. Due to the reasons discussed above, it was decided this wouldn’t be an effective long-term solution.\n\n6.0 - Technical Specification:\n\nRefer full proposal.\n\n7.0 - Test Cases:\n\nA similar model of decentralised governance has been successfully tested and implemented at the Index Coop. A successful FTSE 500 organisation.\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

Even so, it is marvelous to see people in the DeFi world working purely by love of the project, they still got bills to pay and everyone should be rewarded if they bring value to the community or the honeypot.\n\nSpecification ‌ Overview ‌\nWe propose a template here, so everyone can fill in their contributions and then, they can be rewarded if that’s the case. The template should be submitted at the end of each month on discord channel #bear-contributions with the correct format name.\n\nAt the beginning, rewards will be estimated and distributed by the founding team. The value should be estimated in USD and paid in Ethereum in the first weeks of the next month.\n\nSome funds of the honeypot must be allocated for this initiative.\n\nTherefore, if someone wants to dispute a reward, one of the Discord mods should be contacted to create a channel and then everyone can analyze the situation and get to a consensus.\n\nTemplate: Refer https://gov.buzzedbearhideout.com/t/proposal-rewards-for-contributers/559\n\nRationale\nIn order to work as a DAO it is important to setup a reward system for people committed to the project be compensated. With the community seeing the possibility of making money they may be encouraged to do the same.\n\nTest Cases ‌\nWe have seen a lot of DAO’s by now implementing ways of awards for those who contribute with them with the aim of encouraging people to join the taskforce.\n\nCopyright ‌\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n\n",

      "content": "Status: Proposed\n\nCo-Author(s): @Halstead a.k.a MillionBear, @n00bleLAND, @drmsxchns.eth, @aBinaryMind, @thatguytrey\n\nDiscussions (and full proposal)-to: Refer https://gov.buzzedbearhideout.com/t/bip-006-the-first-brick-2-0/566 and https://gov.buzzedbearhideout.com/t/bip-006-the-first-brick/468\n\nPlease note due to word limit count, this snapshot only contains a summary of the final proposal. To view the final proposal, click the above link for The First Brick 2.0\n\nCreated: 09/09/2021 \n\nImplementation: Immediate effect.\n\n1.0 - Buzzed Summary:\nThe proposal set forth here will define an organisational structure for the BBH. Designed with inspiration from the Index Coop, a proven and tested method of decentralised governance. This proposal will define the parameters for different working interest groups and their powers in relation to the BBH community and its resources.\n\n2.0 - Abstract:\nThe proposed change is to introduce titles for new working groups and broadly define their powers and responsibilities within the BBH community. If implemented, this proposal will lead to the creation of an official hierarchy, providing Bears with the structure and process they need to push forward their ideas. The proposed hierarchy is represented in the rudimentary figure detailed here: https://gov.buzzedbearhideout.com/t/bip-006-the-first-brick-2-0/566\n\n3.0 - Motivation:\nAs a community we have been bursting out with valuable and credible ideas that have the potential to further the BBH DAO. Unfortunately, it is rare that these ideas are followed through with. A large reason for this is that motivated community members lack the guidance and defined processes and procedures necessary to make their voices and ideas heard. This diminishes the effectiveness of the DAO and impedes upon our ability to accomplish community goals.\n\n4.0 - Specification  Overview: \nWhat it is that the proposal will do to solve the problem will be detailed in this section.\n\n4.1 – Groups & Roles:\n\nThis is where the proposed working groups are defined and labelled. The labels are Pods, Committees and The Community. Please refer to the full proposal link for further explanation. \n\n4.2 – Responsibilities:\n\nIn this section, the minimum non-negotiable requirements from Pods and Committees are set out. All groups/roles will be required to operate in accordance with one simple principle:\n\nGrowth & Improvement: Whatever the goals are for your group, they must be designed to further the financial, strategic, or social interests of the BBH community and its members.\n\nPlease refer to the linked document for details of the minimum requirements for the Pods, Committees and The Community. \n\n4.3 - Limits & Power:\n\nThe powers sought by Committees must be adequately defined within the initial proposal. A committee operating outside of its remit may be disbanded following a community vote.\n\nAdditionally, the Community retains the right to end any working group at any time following the success of a community vote, irrespective of circumstances.\n\n4.4 - Remuneration:\n\nAll members that form a Committee are entitled to retroactive remuneration for their work and services to the BBH community. This work will be assessed for its impact to the BBH and appropriate remuneration will be distributed based upon that assessment.\n\nAt present, a potential remuneration / reward system being considered is Coordinape.com. This has the potential to make some minor changes to this proposal but those should be explained within the BIP that proposes Coordinape.\n\n5.0 - Rationale:\n\nThe proposal has been made because as a DAO we must protect ourselves from irresponsible use of community resources. After much consideration and discussion between the proposal team and even further conversation with our defi experts; we decided that a tiered group system enabling less restrictive oversight, but greater resource protection would be the ideal structure. This method would encourage more considered proposals that wish to utilise our resources but should also prevent voter fatigue from incessant, half-baked proposals.\n\nInitially our proposal was a much more rigid structure with a single working group (a committee). It was designed to establish rules for the formation of committees and their election processes. Due to the reasons discussed above, it was decided this wouldn’t be an effective long-term solution.\n\n6.0 - Technical Specification:\n\nRefer full proposal. \n\n7.0 - Test Cases:\n\nA similar model of decentralised governance has been successfully tested and implemented at the Index Coop. A successful FTSE 500 organisation.\n\nCopyright \n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n",

      "content": "Status: Proposal Author(s): CryptoChicca \n\nCreated: 17 October 2021 \n\nDiscussions-to: Refer to Buzzed Bear Hideout: https://gov.buzzedbearhideout.com/t/name-your-bear/533\n\nImplementation: Circa November/December 2021, if BIP supported.   \n\nBuzzed Summary\nGive your bear a name, not just a number, which will display on OpenSea.\n\nAbstract  \nThis proposal enables you to give your bear a name. The name would appear on OpenSea. A naming ceremony will be held across dates to be set in November or December 2021 (approximately a week period to give bears a chance to action). All bears can be named for free during that period. Future naming can occur, but bear holders must pay gas to rename their bear. \n\nShould this be approved, the naming ceremony should be promoted on twitter and in discord, to enable people to buy bears before the naming ceremony and encourage new holders.\n\nMotivation \nSome of you may wish to name your bear, and create more of a personal experience. Creating a bond / attachment with your bear through not just a picture, but a name, will make it harder for people to let go of their bear, because it becomes part of their personality. This is also unique and something we can do for minimal cost to give benefit to bears, coz we are unique and like to do things different to the main pack. It also has the appearance that some bears may be more rare than others when they have a name and other bears do not. It will encourage buying before the naming ceremony and holding bears. It may encourage new bear holders.\n\nSpecification  Overview  \nDefijesus can make this happen. Cost will be minimal for a naming ceremony where all bears have the option to rename at once and this can be reimbursed from the honeypot. Future requests can be onerous and costly on a one off basis, and therefore, bear holders will need to pay gas. This approach is supported by votes in the hideout governance forum (see https above). \n\nRationale  \nThe reasons for this proposal are:\n1.\tPromoting the Buzzed Bear Hideout brand \n2.\tProviding extraneous benefits to Buzzed Bear holders\n3.\tMore growth means more revenue for Buzzed Bears \nIf you don’t want to name your bear, you can just leave it with a number. This would be a choice. So those that wish to proceed can, and those that don’t want to, don’t have to. \n\nTechnical Specification  \nDefijesus can make this happen, if bear holders decide to approve this proposal. \n\nTest Cases \nGoonsNFT have released this naming concept with good feedback.  Street Dawgs have a naming concept open-ended. Pixelglyphs had a naming ceremony with once off naming. All cases were well received and people view Pixelglyph named NFTs as having greater rarity. This rewards holders.\n\nCopyright  \nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

      "content": "Status: Proposal Author(s): n00bleLAND & CryptoChicca\n  \nDiscussions-to: Refer ‘NFT-Shopping’ in discord, and https://gov.buzzedbearhideout.com/t/nft-flipping-committee-formation/549 \n \nCreated: 18 October 2021  \n  \nImplementation: Proposal to be implemented immediately following support. \n \nBuzzed Summary \nBIP-003 approved investment in NFT through two functions: 1) NFT expert flippers and 2) Community led initiative (referred to from here on out as the Bear NFT Flipping Committee).  This proposal is to provide operational guidance / permission to the second initiative to help implement the strategy from BIP-003 and provide the Bear NFT Flipping Committee with a mechanism to enable action. \n \nAbstract ‌  \nA Bear NFT Flipping Committee will be formed to bring a formal structure to the pilot flipping program that has proved effective. This proposal is to provide operational support and enable that committee to be formalized with effective guidance. \n \nMotivation\nThe Bear NFT Flipping Committee has made some great buys, but there is a lack of clarity on how / when to flip, and when / what to repurchase. This proposal aims to provide guidance to those leading this committee. \n \nSpecification ‌ Overview ‌  \nThe Bear NFT Flipping Committee should be led by @defijesus with 2 other trusted bears as support (referred to here on out as APEX Flip Leads). Each of those three Apex Flip Leads will lead the community NFT flipping and should have authority in the event of an inconsistency within the Bear NFT Flipping Committee. This may be the vote on ‘what’ is bought or around the price of selling, if there cannot be agreement between the Bears. Having 3 members will enable a clear decision. \n \nThe following are some suggestions from the community that have been pulled from the Discord server. They are placed here as a documented record of potential ideas, but not as requirements of the to-be-formed Bear NFT Flipping Committee:\n\n1) The committee will be responsible for coordinating buys, filtering suggestions, and organizing group votes for investment moves related to the Bear NFT Flipping Committee\n\n2) They will manage the eventual sales of honeypot owned assets\n\n3) Announce scheduled buying sessions. For example, this could look like a one-hour session where all are invited to give input and vote on purchases or sales. This would be a formalized version of the pilot session that took place. \n\n4) They should set emergency sell parameters. These would be a failsafe if there are significant drops in prices. For example, an emergency sale could be triggered to save the honeypot from larger losses without the initiation of a scheduled session.\n\n5) Organize a weekly check in to discuss what to buy, what to sell, what to hold. This could be a pure share of information that Bears could use for their own personal investments.\n\n6) Establish situational based rules which might include:\na) Minimum/maximum time of holding: This prevents selling before pricing may be fully established or holding too long. Min/max determined prior to purchase and disregards emergency sell parameters.\nb) Target sale price. Once target hit, can either sell immediately or wait to sell until the market begins rolling over (likely above but no less than target). Such targets and planned actions determined prior to purchase, may or may not be subject to min/max time parameters.\nc) Voting procedure to decide if an asset that was designed for a short-term flip becomes a long term hold (potential blue chip)\n\n7) Such strategic elements cannot be disclosed broadly as they can be copied or gamed. I believe purchase/sell strategy can and should be disclosed upon position exit, with proof/validation of adhering to strategy. Basically a neutral (non-apex) party within the community that can validate strategy was adhered to without disclosing broadly, akin to a judge. \n\n8) Community at large can pitch ideas, vote on purchases and elements of strategy. Finalization and execution of strategy may be guided but not dictated by community\n\n9) The Bear NFT Flipping Committee be known as “Bearly Liquid”\n\nTo repeat: the above are SUGGESTIONS and the actual procedures will be decided by the Apex Flip Leads once they have been elected.\n\nRationale ‌  \nThe reasons for this proposal are : \n1) The current NFT flipping pilot that is running is handcuffed by lack of operational processes to achieve the goal of growing the Honeypot. The main reason for this proposal is to give formal structure to NFT flipping within the Buzzed Bears Hideout.\n2) Empowering additional ways to grow the Honeypot.\n3) Engaging the community to work together towards a common goal\n \nTechnical Specification ‌  \nThis is an operational guidance proposal, to enable decisions to be made within the Bear NFT Flipping Committee, as governed by the Apex Flip Leads. The bears who request to be part of the Bear NFT Flipping Committee can elect to vote (not required) on the NFT flipping ideas suggested in an informal way within the committee itself, whether by thumbs up/down, or as determined by the APEX Flip Leads to give best effectiveness to the outcome. The Apex Flip Lead(s) will have the final decision to act on behalf of the committee keeping in mind the best interests of bears and the popular community sentiment.\n \nThe following is the process for the initial election of the APEX Flip Leaders:\n1) Create a dedicated Discord channel for the Bear NFT Flipping Committee\na) This will be will be dedicated to the governance of the Bear NFT Flipping Committee and will serve a different purpose from the #buzzed-nft-shopping channel.\n2) Within this new channel, nominate either yourself or another Bear to be put onto the ballot for the role of APEX Flip Lead. Tag @n00bleLAND and @CryptoChicca when making your nominations.\n3) @n00bleLAND and @CryptoChicca will compile the list of everyone nominated.\n4) All nominations will be voted on in a formal Snapshot.\n5) Top 2 vote winners will become the first APEX Flip Leads alongside @defijesus.\n \nTest Cases ‌ \nThe Hideout has run a very successful pilot which resulted in the extremely successful purchase of CrypToadz at a low price. This pilot flipping session not only yielded profits for the honeypot, but it created a spike in engagement among the community members.\n \nCopyright ‌  \nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0. \n \n\n",

This proposal is made to reward the loyalty of Buzzed Bear holders and promote new growth into the Buzzed Bears Hideout.  Redo of proposal BIP-007 to allow for 48 hours voting in line with governance requirements. \n\nAbstract ‌ \n\nThis proposal will: \n\n1. Purchase 1 floor bears for giveaway / promotion in the lead up and on Halloween (approx cost .05 Eth inc gas costs) \n2. Purchase 5 floor bears for raffle to Buzzed Bear holders (approx cost .25 Eth inc gas costs) \n3. Purchase 5 derivative art from SAURFENG for raffle to Buzzed Bear holders (approx cost .25 Eth) \n4. Create Halloween theme art to overlay on Buzzed Bears using bot technology (similar to the suitmybear scenario) (no cost, thank you mesk85 and alexpanda already implemented!) \n\n**NB - it is noted that the founders may have some bears set aside.

This proposal highlights the maximum anticipated cost. \n\nMotivation ‌ \nThis proposal seeks to reward loyal bears and also to promote the BBH brand to increase members for greater resource load spread and enhanced decentralization benefits. \n\nSpecification ‌ Overview ‌ \n\nThis proposal will be implemented as follows: \n\n1. 1 x floor bear giveaway on twitter to announce the launch of the Halloween campaign, approx 14 October 2021. Winner to be drawn on 31 October 2021. \n\n2. Halloween Package raffle (1 x floor bear and 1 x derivative) to be raffled off with a raffle bot on 5 separate dates between 14 October and 31 October. All bear holders that are verified in discord and click the bot prior to the end of each raffle are eligible to enter. This encourages people to not only join the giveaway in item 1, but also to buy a bear and register in discord to be eligible for further raffles in this point. A bear holder may only win once, otherwise, reroll. This is about rewarding loyalty. These giveaways should be also promoted on twitter to encourage more bears into the hideout. \n\n3.

More growth means more revenue for Buzzed Bears because each sale provides a 5% royalty return to the honey pot. \n\nTechnical Specification ‌ \n\nWe register the derivatives as a special buzzed bear Halloween collection, which are also available to trade on the open market.

      "content": "Status: Proposed\nAuthor: @aBinaryMind\nDiscussions-to: Alternative Honeypot Strategy - A Simplified Approach\nCreated: September 7, 2021\n\nBuzzed Summary\nThis BIP Proposal is suggesting an 80% Honeypot allocation into the three pillars of the crypto space: NFTs, DeFi, and the Metaverse. The remaining 20% of the Honeypot is kept as cold ETH in our Spending Reserve. Our Honeypot Strategy is subject to quarterly reviews, with the first review being held in Q1 2022. The specific details of this strategy, in addition to allocation percentages, are provided herein.\n\nAbstract\nUpon community approval, the following Honeypot allocations will take effect:\n- 30% Metaverse Content\n- 20% NFTs (via Investment Committee)\n- 10% NFTs (via Community Proposals)\n- 20% DeFi Content\n- 20% Spending Reserves (as ETH)\n\nAt the start of Q1 2022, a review for on our Honeypot Strategy will be held. The exact details of what this review entails is beyond the scope of this BIP Proposal. More than likely, a Treasury Committee will be responsible for this review. The point being is that this Honeypot Strategy will be reviewed and adapted, if need be, to be sure it is capitalizing on market trends within the crypto space and reflecting community sentiment.\n\nMotivation\nCurrently, our Honeypot lacks a calculated investment strategy. With no strategy in place, our Honeypot portfolio could fall victim to capital losses, suffer from poor performance, miss out on maximizing upside, and/or lack any kind of hedge against market downturns. Reasons for this: over allocation into any one area, under allocation into any one area, and lack of diversification. Furthermore, a lack of strategy is a lack of focus for the community.\n\nSpecification Overview\nBy limiting allocation amounts into the three pinnacles of the crypto space - NFTs, DeFi, and the Metaverse - we prevent ourselves from falling into the trap of over and under allocation. Likewise, by investing the Honeypot into these three areas, we are practicing a form of diversification. The performance of our Honeypot portfolio, as a result of having exposure in these three pillars collectively, will outperform any single one of these pillars separately. The reason being is simple: the sentiment in these areas shifts among the crypto community. Each one of these areas takes turns getting hot and thus should maximize our upside. Keeping 20% of our Honeypot in a Spending Reserve gives us ample opportunity to buy dips, help stabilize against NFT, DeFi, or Metaverse volatility, and allow us to fund future initiatives.\n\nRationale\nThis BIP Proposal is a culmination of sentiment among members in the form of feedback, in addition to my own opinion backed by my own investing experience and knowledge. A Honeypot Strategy is not a luxury we can afford to go without. It is a necessity. A well calculated Honeypot Strategy should maximize upside, limit risk via diversification, and provide the community some focus by setting allocation limits. The community voiced their opinion for a need of such a strategy while remaining simple. I present [BIP-003] Our Honeypot Strategy - A Simplistic Foundation.\n\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n\n**Quorum:** 1,000 (10% of BEARS)",

      "content": "Status: Proposed\n\nAuthor(s): synth, drmsxmchns\n\nDiscussions-to: https://gov.buzzedbearhideout.com/t/increase-opensea-royalties-to-5/379\n\nCreated: 24/08/2021\n\n\n**Buzzed Summary**\n\nThis proposal aims to increase revenue through an increase in the current OpenSea royalties.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nThe current royalties are set to 2.5%.  The previous sentiment check identified overwhelming support for a royalties increase to 5%.  This proposal does not change the existing division of royalties (80% treasury / 20% developers).\n\n**Motivation** \n\nIt is important to identify means to increase our treasury as this secures our future prosperity through an increase in intrinsic value per bear.\n\n**Specification Overview**\n\nAn increase in royalties to 5% would be the most direct method to increase revenue and bearholder value with minimal risk.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe proposed increase provides a substantial increase in revenue per transaction.  We believe that the downside risks are minimal; variables such as gas prices play a much greater role in commerce than royalty percentages.  The proposed increase is comparable to other projects.\n\n**Copyright** \n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

      "content": "Status: Proposed\n\nAuthor(s): defijesus.eth\n\nDiscussions-to: https://gov.buzzedbearhideout.com/t/bip-001-nft-investment-committee/288\n\nCreated: 17/08/2021\n\nImplementation (optional): [Added if BIP passes] ‌\n\n\n## Buzzed Summary\n\nWe elect GFunk and TropoFarmer to use 50 ETH from the Honeypot to buy and sell NFTs. These two curators will be paid via a performance fee - every time they sell a JPEG and generate profit to the Honeypot, they collect 10% of that profit each. We will reinvest all the profits back into this program.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nWe put our capital to work using an elected committee and share a % of the profits with that committee.\n\n### Unfair advantage #1\nOur huge Honeypot, with 245+ ETH in our balance sheets, we immediately start to think of ways we could put that money to work.\n\n### Unfair advantage #2\nGFunk and Tropofarmer - we couldn’t ask for a better duo. OG NTF people that know how hard it is to launch a great project and can easily spot one in the wild.\n\n**GFunk** - Wearer of many hats, Founder @pixelvault_ @punkscomic & @MetaHero_\n**TropoFarmer** - Illustrious NFT shitposter and flipper extraordinaire, who turned $500 into an estimated $200k in jpegs\n\n### Unfair advantage #3\nThe investment committee will be armed with MEV (Miner Extractable Value) technology developed by the Buzzed Bears. This will allow the committee to make moves that might be impossible otherwise.\n\n\n## Motivation ‌\n\n~250 ETH is sitting idle in our wallet, let’s put it to work.\n\n\n## Specification Overview ‌\n\nWe fund a gnosis 3 safe with 50 ETH (~20% of our Honeypot) where both the curators will be able to make purchases from using a 2 out of 3 multisig setup including both curators and defijesus.eth (I’m included just to facilitate some technical hurdles, I won’t be interfering with the investment decisions in any way). Buying via gnosis safe might not be feasible for projects we use MEV stuff due to technical limitations.\n\n1 JPEG = 1 Trade. We calculate profit per trade. The Buzzed Bears reserve the right to change/terminate the project to accommodate new circumstances at any time. If the curators leave and we sell the JPEG later at a profit they are still entitled to the performance fee.\n\n\n## Rationale ‌\n\nWe decided to bring on curators because if we, as an organisation, vote on every purchase we make we will be open to attackers frontrunning our moves. Also, some moves might have to be time sensitive, making it very cumbersome to vote on every NFT investment we make.\n\nIn order to align the incentives of the curators and the community, the curators will be paid via performance fee. They only make a profit if we make a profit. 10% for each curator is more than fair and leaves the Honeypot to get 80% of the revenue generated by this initiative.\n\nWe are only deploying 50 ETH and we can decide to end this program at any time. After showing results, we can commit to use more funds.\n\n\n## Copyright ‌\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0 1.",

The reviewers reserve the right to cap a payment or deem an account ineligible for current or future rewards.\n\nReward Committee:\n - defijesus\n - central_mv\n - geolightwork\n - Halstead\n\nThe program will not tolerate/reward:\n\n    Spamming followers\n    Giveaways\n    Paid impressions\n    General trickery\n    Inauthentic content\n    Misleading content\n    Saturation of themes\n\nProgram Duration:\n - Retroactive rewards will be assigned.\n - 2 weeks after activation.\n\nNotes:\n\n1) Unless you have built up an audience beforehand, consistent success with this program will not generally come swiftly.\n2) Any BBH member receiving a pre-determined stipend by the DAO or on a vesting program is not eligible for rewards\n3) Guidelines and workshops for effective posting/publishing and brand-building will be held and shared.
