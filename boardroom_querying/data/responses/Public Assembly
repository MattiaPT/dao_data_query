      "title": "PAP 24 - Redesign the Public Assembly Website",
      "content": "### TL;DR \nRedesign the PA Website while also updating the content + strategy\n\n### Overview\nAs mentioned on the last PA townhall, our website could use updating based on many factors, but most importantly that we have expanded as an organization and have a larger community with more artifacts and touchpoints to surface. Currently, the site is a glimpse of the early days of PA, and does not help to provide important context to what we have accomplished as an organization.\n\n### Benefits\nAn updated website will provide more context about the PA community and its accomplishments, allowing more outside organizations to find crossovers and opportunities to collaborate with us.\nSurfacing of PA’s experiments by community members, allowing individuals to have an increased sense of ownership in the collective and dually increasing the visibility of their contributions to the space in attachment to PA’s growing value in the public eye.\nUpdated and more automated pathways to contribute to PA, with less upfront explanation required.\n\n### Proposed Sitemap\n![](https://i.ibb.co/3vDjmjG/PA-sitemap.png)\n\n### Budget\nKD and Neesh have decided to donate the large majority of their time on this project as pro-bono, and are asking for .75ETH to meet base level costs. We would like to specifically note that market rate for designing, coding and managing content strategy for a similar website is $8k-$12k, as to set a precedent for others to not participate in pro-bono proposals unless they are in a secure position to do so.\n\n### Who’s up for the task\nKevin (lovingly KD) (developer) and Neesh (designer) have a proven track record working on projects together. We both were part of the team that launched Vessel (https://www.onvessel.world/onchain-media-enthusiast) and also were part of the PA squad that participated in the hackathon at ETHCC and created PASS \n\n\n[KD Github](https://github.com/thekidnamedkd)\n\n[Neesh Portfolio](https://www.losingmyego.studio/)",

      "title": "Second term as PM for Public Assembly ",
      "content": "### TL;DR:\n\nThis proposal is to request funding to serve Public Assembly as a community resident // project manager for the next 3 months. The goal is to facilitate communication both internally and externally within the community, as well as to guide current and future PA members in their projects. Based on the feedback given in my post-mortem (View here). In this second term, I’ll be focusing on creating community spaces for members to collaborate with each other, assist in ongoing projects (website redesign, assembly press, grant submissions, etc) as well as hosting our monthly townhalls.\n\n### Context:\n\nFor the past few months, I have been involved in the PA community (thanks to 0xtranqui for being a steward in that process) and I definitely see the potential for this organization to grow as a sanctuary for developers and builders in the Web 3 space. It was mentioned in the last town hall that for Public Assembly to grow, we need to be more organized and establish a baseline for communication channels and contribution guidelines. This proposal offers my time as a project manager to help build bridges between the community and PA as onchain infrastructure.\n\n### Proposal details:\n\n**Documentation Standardization:** Establish documentation for future town hall meetings, and ensure that their documentation is available for the next three town hall meetings (October, November, and December). Additionally, act as a point of contact for members seeking key information within Public Assembly. As part of the deliverables for this section, transcribe meetings and present key takeaways to make the content more digestible for the community.\n\n**Project management:** Assisting PA members in facilitating the 4 steps of project development (setup, planning, delivery and close). This would also involve reaching out to both old and new token holders and providing a progress report on what they need for the project to reach completion. To begin with, I would start with the following initiatives:\n\n- Website redesign\n\n- Open blog\n\n- Assembly Press\n\n**Communication channels**: the focus here is on sharing community highlights within Public Assembly through Twitter, with the goal of providing at least bi-weekly updates.\n\n### External funding:\n\nI would explore grants and other funding models that could benefit PA in the long term. In this role, I would allocate my time to sharing grants in the forum and ensuring that we meet deadlines for grant applications, if necessary.\n\n### Benefits:\n\nThis would help improve collaboration among PA members and provide context to others who would like to be involved.\n\n### Timeline:\n\n- Month 1 (October 2023): Townhall #7, Website Redesign\n\n- Month 2 (November 2023): Townhall #8, Assembly Press.\n\n- Month 3 (December 2023): Townhall #9, Open Blog, end of mandate report.\n\n### Budget:\n\n**Total funds requested:** 2 eth (a slight increase here since I found that the role took more of my time than expected.)",

      "content": "An L2 migration is a significant matter that requires the consensus of the DAO. It is expected to become a feature in the upcoming 'Bali' contract upgrades. Nonetheless, the presence of rogue actors in the Nouns Builder ecosystem instigating malicious transactions across several DAOs cannot be ignored. Temporarily pausing the auctions could be a strategic move to prevent these bad actors from acquiring tokens cheaply and subsequently initiating malicious transactions during periods of low onchain activity. Fortunately, our voting threshold seems to be a robust defense against such activities. However, it is evident that the auctions are not presently serving as a sustainable revenue stream for Public Assembly.\n\nYou can find more detailed thoughts on this proposition [here](https://forum.public---assembly.com/t/post-auction/433).",

      "title": "Proposal to serve Public Assembly as a Project Manager",
      "content": "### TL;DR: \nThis proposal is to request funding to serve Public Assembly as a project manager for the next 3 months. The goal is to facilitate communication both internally and externally within the community, as well as to guide current and future PA members in their projects. This will also help close any loose ends in terms of documentation, guidelines for contribution, and general duties related to the DAO organization. The idea originated from watching BuilderDAO establish an operation working group in [Proposal 58 ](https://nouns.build/dao/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422/vote/0xc7ee6d8377584135e85401e63471719561ceb6cdb91ee48c330b051a41c18a8bl)\n\n### Context: \nFor the past few months, I have been involved in the PA community (thanks to 0xtranqui for being a steward in that process) and I definitely see the potential for this organization to grow as a sanctuary for developers and builders in the Web 3 space. It was mentioned in the last town hall that for Public Assembly to grow, we need to be more organized and establish a baseline for communication channels and contribution guidelines. This proposal offers my time as a project manager to help build bridges between the community and PA as onchain infrastructure.\n\n### Proposal details:\n**Documentation Standardization**: Establish documentation for current and past town hall meetings, and ensure that their documentation is available for the next three town hall meetings (July, August, and September). Additionally, act as a point of contact for members seeking key information within Public Assembly. As part of the deliverables for this section, transcribe meetings and present key takeaways to make the content more digestible for the community.\n\n**Project management:** Assisting PA members in facilitating the 4 steps of project development (setup, planning, delivery and close). This would also involve reaching out to both old and new token holders, and providing a progress report on what they need for the project to reach completion. To begin with, I would start with the following initiatives:\n\n- Private destruction kit\n- Experimental beta testing bounty\n- TBD\n\n**Communication channels:** Conduct an analysis of the current communication channels within PA and identify areas for improvement. This analysis should include **the forum** and our **Twitter** account. The goal is to establish a robust and effective communication strategy that builds trust and engagement within the PA community and promotes the organization’s growth and success over the long term. \n\n### External funding: \nI would explore grants and other funding models that could benefit PA in the long term. In this role, I would allocate my time to sharing grants in the forum and ensuring that we meet deadlines for grant applications, if necessary.\n\n### Benefits: \nThis would help improve collaboration among PA members and provide context to others who would like to be involved.\n\n### Timeline: \n\n- **Month 1** (July 2023): Townhall #4, prop house round, private destruction.\n\n- **Month 2** (August 2023): Townhall #5, Assembly Press.\n\n- **Month 3**  (September 2023): Townhall #6, Open Blog, end of mandate report.\n\n- **Ongoing**:  Reevaluate the needs of the project at that point in time and establish a process to nominate (or renominate) a project manager moving forward.\n\n### Budget:\nTotal funds requested: 1.5 eth (0.5eth per month). To start understanding the scope of this role, I intend to dedicate at least 10 hours per week to serve PA as a project manager. \n\nWebsite: [projectmehari.com](projectmehari.com)\nSocials: @verymehari",

      "title": "Public Assembly Founders Allocation Removal",
      "content": "## TLDR\n\nthis proposal removes all founder’s allocation for Public Assembly. The current 15% founder’s allocation of Public Assembly’s governance token is broken down into: 10% zora.eth, 1% valcoholics.eth, 1% salief.eth, 1% losingmyego.eth, 1% javvvs.eth, and 1% 0xDC9…91B6D (Builder DAO). \n\n## Overview\n\nAs of today, Public Assembly has 63 token holders and 80 members on the forum. To reflect the most up-to-date mission and priorities for Public Assembly, this proposal aims to revisit some of the premises in which the founder’s allocation was set. \n\nPublic Assembly was launched as an onchain DAO on December 2, 2022. At the time, three of the seven founders were working on Public Assembly as Zora Labs employees. Additionally, Public Assembly’s first project Neosound (and the work leading up to launching the DAO) was funded by Zora Labs up to this point. However, Public Assembly becoming an onchain DAO meant that moving forward the DAO could be more sovereign from Zora Labs as a central source of funding. And therefore the relationship between Public Assembly and Zora Labs could be maintained via a founder’s allocation to zora.eth for funding and supporting the process leading up to the launch on December 2. To reflect a more even compensation/equity between the founding members, the Zora Labs employee founders (0xtranqui.eth, dain.eth, and junghwan.eth) were not included in the allocation. \n\nThis is a summary of the context in which the current 15% founder’s allocation was understood and set at the time of the launch. And currently, only one founder is contributing to Public Assembly as a full-time employee at Zora Labs. \n\n## Motivation\n\nIn an effort to further decentralize Public Assembly’s governance and influence from centralized groups such as the founding team and Zora Labs, removing the founder’s allocation feels like an impactful step forward. \n\nPublic Assembly is now much greater than just the founding members, and their personal investment in the success of the organization extends beyond the incentive of the founder’s allocation. Though giving up the allocation is still a big decision for everyone, the founding team is looking forward to Public Assembly’s long term priorities. \n\n## Moving Forward\n\nBy removing the founder’s allocation, we’re hoping that this is a first step for developing a more robust structure for Public Assembly. Some other ideas include: removing the veto power held by the founding team’s multisig FF89DE, and transitioning the legal structure into an unincorporated nonprofit association (or any other structure best suited for Public Assembly). \n\nSee you onchain!

This project endeavors to explore the creation of reusable tooling for Assembly Press curation.\n\nDemo build (updating regularly): https://mint-house-two.vercel.app/\n\n### Introduction\n\nMint House is a “batteries included” showroom environment to channel curation contracts created via Assembly Press. The goal is to create a space that will aggregate all assets automatically from anyone’s own deployment of an Assembly Press contract (so long as they use the correct address in environment variables.)\n\nThis is designed to work in concert with a number of other Blog Era endeavors around Assembly Press. Long term this will also leverage PA tooling like Mutual and be available to Flexible DAO interfaces to create independent but connected spaces by PA and other onchain entities.\n\nSupported listing types on release will be any ERC721/ERC1155 contract on Mainnet/Goerli (with Optimism to follow -- and chain support only limited to where AP is deployed). More contract primitives (ex: wallet addresses) to come in future iterations.\n\n### Ask Details\n\nThe majority of the work for v0 has reached its necessary conclusion and an earlier draft of this proposal was circulated, but submission of that initial proposal version was left for more consideration while the project found more context in the midst of several other parallel workflows beginning to take shape and coalesce around an emergent design space. \n\nThis proposal requests retroactive funding for existing work:\n* Layout design & stack implementation, indexer logic, minting logic\n* Build site to spec, debug, UX improvements \n* Component refactor, search implementation\nTransfer to Alchemy, custom hooks, move to single env variable ability for reuse\n\nAnd an additional smaller segment of work that is plugging v0 into the aforementioned emergent whole. This includes: \n* Turning repo into deployable package via Vercel wizard\n* Universal config + env variables to spec\n* Leveraging as much PA ecosystem in the project as currently available\n\n### Benefits\n\nPA is exploring a composable ecosystem for communities and creative technologists. Mint House has evolved into a building block of that exploration. Its funding would officially activate treasury allocations to non-founding members. \n\nThis creates an early use case for more involvement in creating and testing the network and proliferating the PA mission of inventive and approachable tools.  In the future this ecosystem could drive curation fees, social graphs, and modular data hubs. \n\nWithin PA’s own usage of such tools like Mint House, successful curation and amplification of outside projects also brings much goodwill towards the organization. This work has already started numerous conversations with like minded groups and invites numerous collaboration opportunities both at the protocol and consumer level.\n\n### Timeline\n\nCurrently 95% completed. ETD for the final phase is 17th of April, 2023.\n\n### Budget\n\n**1.3 ETH total for the following**\n\n1.08 ETH for the work already done:\n* 80 hours total split between KD (60) and Meek (20) \n* 1.08 ETH * $1900 (est) = $2052 \n* 2052 / 80 = $25.65/hr for both contributors\n\n0.22 ETH for the work to be completed:\n* Specifically on creating reusability and PA modularity\n* .22 ETH * $1900 (est) = $418\n* To be split evenly between both contributors\n",

There have been misconceptions about their proposal &nbsp;<a href=\"https://boardroom.mirror.xyz/P6R6HxgCPU3uNPMEn_mKxL0gF44_sidvxc1xbf1lMc0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">which won 25 ETH</a> and to address this FF89DE has reallocated the funds to increase transparency and set a precedent for future behavior.</p><p><br></p><h3>Background:</h3><p>In summary the founding team of Public Assembly FF89DE submitted a proposal called \"<a href=\"https://nouns.build/dao/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422/vote/0x9576d25f7b81e9ba32b424a7fa094c964f1fbb8551518db4448de56c1866e785\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">Flexible DAO Interfaces</a>\" for BuilderDAO's first official Prop House. It was a proposal for the design and development of a customizable web template for Nounish DAOs and it was part of the \"Custom DAO Websites\" round. Initially the proposal was supposed to be submitted through Public Assembly under the address \"<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x8330e78222619fd26a9fbcbebaeb21339838bd30\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">publicassembly.eth</a>\" but could not be submitted through a DAO proposal or a multisignature wallet due to technical restrictions of Prop House.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x806164c929ad3a6f4bd70c2370b3ef36c64deaa8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">tranqui.eth</a>&nbsp;submitted the proposal on behalf of PA which did not win. Members of BuilderDAO advised FF89DE to resubmit the proposal onchain directly to the DAO. FF89DE decided to proceed and \"<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xb00a93ff31217e49c3674e05b525f239a85bb78f\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">losingmyego.eth</a>\" (a BuilderDAO and FF89DE member) proposed it eventually leading to a 25 ETH award. The funds were transferred to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x26c322eacd3213a0f7fc9917e77e4dd603a4c72e106b2fa1feb8c2e41480ddaa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">FF89DE multisig instead of the Public Assembly treasury</a>&nbsp;and production began on January 9th with a public sprint.</p><p><br></p><h3>Findings and Nuance:</h3><p>FF89DE has engaged in extensive discussions in recent days regarding the wisdom of this recent decision made on behalf of the larger community as well as its potential impact on future growth and the overall integrity of the experiment. In this section we talk about discrepancies and points that have been thought about since the first transaction that went through to fund the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://testnet.nouns.build/dao/0x78ee61659a4659e64b0009ff3b319cf909787cff/vote/0xE9304Ce38e6A07Dd623C8146Fe0f1F5a5353fb53\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">FF89DE.eth</a>&nbsp;multi sig</p><p><strong>The reconsideration was based on the points discussed below.</strong></p><ul><li>Headlessness;</li><li>The Provenance of the DAO;</li><li>The Speculation that Led to Winning the Award;</li></ul><p><strong>Headlessness</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/valcoholics1/status/1599234175932198912?s=20&amp;t=UfIlyeM8kYZpLEwqktbyAg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">FF89DE</a>&nbsp;has established borders around ourselves and signaled our intent for PA to be a headless brand that is not subject to a single leading force although we recognize we will still have leadership influence in the short to mid term. The decision to route the funds to FF89de.eth as a working group was initially intentional as it was a way to communicate the importance of the headless nature of Public Assembly it’s subgroups and its ability to collaborate with other communities.</p><p><strong>Onchain Provenance</strong></p><p>The methods of funding for Public Assembly (PA) onchain is important for defining cultural standards. The proposer of the development sprint onchain was losingmyego.eth who operates autonomously as a creative within BuilderDAO FF89DE and PA. As a result the PA DAO address has never submitted a proposal and hence never received an award and there is no onchain history associated with the PA name interacting with external DAOs. The FF89DE multisig wallet is prominently featured among onchain acts with external DAOs as of this date. We found that It will be harder to track how Public Assembly's brand credibility and collective mission are affected without a definition of working groups such as FF89DE based on internal proposals.</p><p><strong>Speculation</strong></p><p>In some situations routing funds through the PA DAO wallet may be more or less desired and expected. In the case of the \"Flexible DAO Interfaces\" proposal where the reputation of PA was used to influence voters we think it makes sense that that PA should be the organization in charge of and in possession of any ETH awarded as a prize. In a future scenario where an external DAO token is awarded under the reputation of PA we also think it also makes sense that PA treasury should also be considered the organization that owns and manages the token.</p><p><br></p><h3>Consensus and Action Plan</h3><p>The reroute of funds by FF89DE was a decision made with oversight from all parties to set a precedent for other PA working groups. The option to route funds through PA was always considered but the contributors could not begin working on the Flexible DAO Interfaces sprint due to the strong policy of not encouraging work without pay. Members of FF89DE are the only active participants in the Flexible DAO Interfaces sprint working group and they spent time scoping out this proposal for the BuilderDAO community.</p><p>Moving forward the idea is for specific proposals made on behalf of Public Assembly to call for PA to serve as the primary handler of any assets acquired for additional transparency oversight and alignment checks. This will protect against potential exploitation and misuse as more working groups submit external DAO proposals. As Public Assembly grows we suspect that more people in the sub PA group will want to move in this way.</p><p><br></p><h3>Breakdown of onchain actions</h3><p><strong>Completed actions</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0x26c322eacd3213a0f7fc9917e77e4dd603a4c72e106b2fa1feb8c2e41480ddaa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">25 ETH was sent from BuilderDAO treasury to FF89DE multisig.</a></p><p><a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc6a9811487f46c0559a2ac3f72c2b9b8ca7511cab5c0c015925d428f34b18ceb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">5 ETH sent from FF89DE multisig to Public Assembly treasury.</a></p><ul><li>5 ETH sent to PA treasury from non-ZORA ff89de members.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xe9304ce38e6a07dd623c8146fe0f1f5a5353fb53\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">19.8 ETH sent to contributors for work to begin.</a></p><ul><li>ZORA members did not receive compensation from the 25 eth won from the builderdao prop</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x8330e78222619fd26a9fbcbebaeb21339838bd30\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: inherit;\">15 ETH sent to PA treasury from non-ZORA ff89de members</a></p><ul><li>For the week of work that has already begun towards Flexible DAO Interfaces contributors have been compensated and 5 ETH was subtracted from the return amount.

      "content": "<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/HrQKZMG.png\"></p><h2><br></h2><h2>Summary</h2><p>This proposal upgrades the DAO to V1.1 to add the following features, improvements and bug fixes.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Updatable Founder Shares</h3><p>DAOs will now be able to propose changes to founders shares. This gives DAOs the ability to add, modify and remove founders shares via proposal.</p><p>With this new feature DAO creators will have the ability to modify any errors that may have been caused at DAO deployment.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Upgrade Visibility</h3><p>In V1.1, each smart contract of a DAO now has an explicit version attached. This means that members and developers will be able easily understand which protocol implementation a DAO is utilizing at any given time.</p><p>This will also make it easier for future upgrades that are in development: including <em>airdrops</em> and <em>custom metadata renderers</em>.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Proposal Spam Fix</h3><p>Proposal submission to a DAO has an incorrectly implemented check which can allow for spam proposals to be submitted to a DAO. In V1.1 it works as expected.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Auction Improvements</h3><p>Improved bid handling and edge case management in the Auction House contracts.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Author</h3><p>This upgrade has been developed and proposed by <strong>Zora</strong> (<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xd1d1d4e36117ab794ec5d4c78cbd3a8904e691d0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 122, 183); background-color: transparent;\">zora.eth</a>)</p>",
