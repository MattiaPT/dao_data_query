      "content": "# **Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal introduces a Code of Conduct for RARI DAO delegates and community members to ensure a respectful and productive governance environment. It outlines expectations for delegate behavior and engagement policies, enforced by market forces and moderators respectively, and details consequences for violations.\n\n# **Motivation:**\n\nImplementing this Code of Conduct will help establish a respectful and professional environment within the RARI DAO. It ensures that both delegates and community members engage in meaningful and constructive discussions, aligning with the broader mission of decentralization and community-driven governance.\n\n# **Rationale:**\n\nThe proposed Code of Conduct aligns with the mission of RARI DAO by promoting transparent, respectful, and informed decision-making. The expectations for delegates encourage professionalism, accountability, and empathy, which reflect the values of a decentralized autonomous organization focused on the collective good. The engagement policies aim to maintain a healthy community discourse, contributing to the long-term sustainability of the DAO.\n\n# **Key Terms:**\n\n* **Delegation market:** A system where token holders delegate their voting power to trusted individuals, who act as their representatives within the DAO.\n* **Conflicts of interest:** Situations where personal interests may compromise the impartiality of a delegate’s decisions.\n\n# **Specifications:**\n\nThe Code of Conduct consists of two facets and will be enforced by their own mechanisms:\n\n### **Delegate Expectations (Enforced by the delegation market)**\n\nThese are ‘should’ statements which are enforceable by the delegation free market but not directly by any elected or unelected committee. All delegates should abide by these expectations. If a delegate does not abide by these expectations, their delegators should consider re-delegating to a delegate who does abide by them.\n\n* Be informed about the broader crypto ecosystem.\n* Act and vote based on what they believe best serves the interests of the DAO.\n* Review proposals professionally without bias and abstain if unable to do so.\n* Provide constructive, well-researched feedback, avoid personal attacks, unsubstantiated claims, and use designated channels for discussions.\n* Avoid conflicts of interest wherever possible and reduce the impact of these when it’s not possible to avoid them.\n* Disclose potential conflicts of interest whenever possible.\n* Do not vote for their own candidacy in an election. In cases such as multiple-choice voting, delegates may vote for themselves as long as they also vote for at least one other candidate.\n* Be respectful of diverse options and demonstrate empathy towards other delegates or community members.\n\n### **Policies for Engagement (Enforced by moderators)**\n\nUsing the Forum (Discourse), Discord, and Telegram.\n\n* Treat everyone with respect, avoiding discrimination, harassment, and inappropriate language or behavior, especially in tough conversations.\n* Contribute meaningfully to discussions by adding value, providing constructive critiques, and offering evidence for claims.\n* Encourage respectful discourse and avoid personal attacks in all interactions.\n* Uphold civility, common sense, and a positive attitude in all interactions.\n* Stay vigilant against scams and phishing attempts. Reporting suspicious activity is encouraged.\n\nTo report a Policies of Engagement violation by any user one may flag the violation using tools provided by the platform on which it has occurred. These should be handled by moderators of various platforms in cooperation with the Foundation. If a delegate does not abide by the rules above, they will:\n\n* Receive a warning, in minor cases.\n* Receive a suspension for one month in severe cases.\n* After that, a delegate may receive a six-month suspension for repeated violations.\n* If a delegate continues to violate the above rules they may face permanent suspension from the DAO. Suspensions will apply to participation in community platforms such as the forum (Discourse), Telegram or Discord, not the DAO as a whole.\n\n# Overall Cost:\n\nThere are no direct costs associated with the implementation of this proposal",

      "title": "RRC-34: Enable RARI Staking",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nRARI governance is undergoing an upgrade via [turning on protocol fees (RRC 28) 4](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/rari-foundation/proposal/64443561092723928501818567121519051108693422626070463342810224372241233243885) and via [the token upgrade (RRC 30) 1](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/rari-foundation/proposal/85102068202527969889208024703113668965813715410446115075088330064807449302588). We believe turning on staking should be a third component of this governance upgrade.\n\nWe propose to unlock RARI utility and improve the governance and security of the RARI protocol by implementing RARI staking, without yet turning on fee distribution to token holders. Through RARI staking, token holders who delegate to active governance participants will be able to capture value. The proposal will also implement a liquid staked RARI token (stRARI) on Rari Chain via the [Tally Protocol](https://tally.mirror.xyz/Drw-uvqhUnJLRxg32sV-sqKZ785-AO85FBaCYeXqxhA) that enables any future rewards to auto-compound, is (re)stakeable, and is compatible with DeFi. Separately, we will work with the RARI DAO to decide how to fund rewards and how to split rewards between token holders and delegates.\n\n## Motivation\n\nMotivation to enable staking for RARI DAO is two-fold: (1) improve governance participation and (2) improve security of RARI DAO.\n\n### Enable staking to improve governance participation\n\nRARI token utility is low and as a result, the RARI token is struggling to accrue value.\n\n* Governance power is the only source of fundamental demand for RARI, while there are multiple sources of new supply (unlocks, treasury spending, etc.).\n* The ability to restake RARI or use it on DeFi is not compatible with governance. Voting power breaks when RARI is deposited into smart contracts.\n\nRight now, ~12.4% of RARI (that which does not belong to “Holders” on the below graph) is being used in the onchain ecosystem, meaning it cannot be used in governance. This robs the DAO of voting power that can be used to reach quorum and protect against malicious attacks.\n\n[<img height=\"314\" width=\"690\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-09-06 at 5.28.54 PM\" src=\"https://forum.rari.foundation/uploads/default/optimized/1X/6418e51c9ebd0578af4f7f3849220351244a6e0a_2_690x314.png\" />Screenshot 2024-09-06 at 5.28.54 PM1412×644 71.1 KB](https://forum.rari.foundation/uploads/default/original/1X/6418e51c9ebd0578af4f7f3849220351244a6e0a.png \"Screenshot 2024-09-06 at 5.28.54 PM\")\n\n*From* [*CoinMarketCap*](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/rarible/#Analytics)\n\nThe RARI token is struggling as a governance mechanism. The veRARI token model deterred participation because it adds complexity and commitment, discouraging those who may not want to lock up their tokens. Without staking, the DAO is also disallows RARI token holders that want to use these tokens in DeFi from voting.\n\nWith the recent move from veRARI to RARI for governance voting, RARI DAO is looking to incentivise active governance participation. Delegation has tripled since DAO launch in 2020, especially with the help of the [Delegate Launchpad Proposal (RRC 9)](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/rari-foundation/proposal/4998212454959764411677761814601920941258702940035724218302264365950572124990), but more tokens have not been used in voting.\n\n### Enable staking to improve security of RARI DAO\n\nThe strongest defense against attacks on a decentralized system is active governance participation and a broad, engaged delegate base. Staking plays a crucial role in achieving this by incentivizing users to commit their tokens and participate in governance. By turning on staking rewards and tying them to active participation in governance (via delegation to oneself or to someone else), the system can foster a more resilient and well-distributed decision-making process, which enhances overall security and stability within the DAO.\n\nThe RARI DAO treasury currently holds 4.67 million $RARI (worth over $7.19 million USD) from its initial allocation and will continue to generate revenue through the [new fee structure 4](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/rari-foundation/proposal/64443561092723928501818567121519051108693422626070463342810224372241233243885). The DAO has the flexibility to decide how to use this revenue, with one suggestion being to allocate a portion for staking rewards. Separate from this current proposal, the DAO could consider setting aside a dedicated pool to enhance these rewards and incentivise early participation since staking rewards may be low initially.\n\nAs a result, it is becoming economically attractive for a malicious actor to launch a governance attack on the DAO treasury. The potential profit of attacking the DAO treasury is increasing as more RARI accumulates in the treasury, while the cost of attacking the DAO through purchasing RARI for its voting power is not increasing proportionally to defend against attacks. A more developed version of this dynamic exists in the ENS which is actively fighting off governance attacks (documented [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-enable-cancel-role-on-the-dao/19090/10)) and in Compound, which fell victim to this type of attack recently (documented [here](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/compound-governance-attack-reveals-inherent-vulnerabilities-of-daos)). Had Compound enabled staking, which could have redistributed voting power to the DAO, it would not have been economically worth attacking the DAO because the increased cost of acquiring enough voting power through staking would have outweighed the potential rewards of the attack. Staking would have created a more robust defense by tying voting power to economic commitment, making it much more expensive and difficult for a malicious actor to gain control over governance decisions.\n\nRARI Staking unlocks utility and aligns governance by creating a mechanism to stream future rewards from DAO-generated sources like protocol fees, token inflation, and treasury diversification to token holders who are delegated to an active governance participant. RARI Staking makes RARI usable in restaking and DeFi by returning voting power locked in contracts to the DAO.\n\n## Specifications and Steps to Implement\n\n### System architecture\n\nRARI Staking enables RARI utility in Rari Chain while allowing the DAO to retain governance power. It includes a few modular components that come together to power the system.&#x20;\n\n**RARI Staking via the Tally governance staking system**\n\n* Has the power to distribute fees proportionally to token holders who have delegated voting power to an active governance participant.\n\n**The DAO**\n\n* Has the power to turn on fee distribution and send fees to RARI Staking\n* Controls how voting power is distributed to delegates, including delegation strategies for unused voting power\n\n**stRARI (Tally Protocol LST)**\n\n* Auto-compounds potential rewards if they are turned on in the future\n* Provides token holders a liquid position\n* Returns voting power to the DAO when stRARI is deposited into restaking, DeFi, and centralized exchanges. The RARI DAO exclusively has the ability to determine how this voting power is distributed/redelegated via a governance proposal. The DAO will decide how to set up the initial redelegation logic for stRARI.\n\n[<img height=\"500\" width=\"521\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-09-06 at 5.32.51 PM\" src=\"https://forum.rari.foundation/uploads/default/optimized/1X/4a911a145f4836cf1010a3d442b84039e67ff659_2_521x500.png\" />Screenshot 2024-09-06 at 5.32.51 PM856×820 64.9 KB](https://forum.rari.foundation/uploads/default/original/1X/4a911a145f4836cf1010a3d442b84039e67ff659.png \"Screenshot 2024-09-06 at 5.32.51 PM\")\n\n### Implementation details and eligibility for rewards\n\nThe Tally governance staking system builds on top of [Unistaker](https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/UniStaker). We will customize Unistaker for RARI’s [governance architecture](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md) and [fee collection mechanism](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/fee-distribution) in Rari Chain. We will implement RARI Staking in such a way that it can accept arbitrary fee sources as rewards. We will also require that tokens be delegated to an active delegate.\n\nWe define an active delegate using Karma Score. The DAO will define the Karma Score requirement for being considered an active delegate. Karma Score is a combination of delegate’s Snapshot voting stats, onchain voting stats and their forum activity. To accurately calculate forum activity score, delegates are required to prove ownership of their forum handle by [signing a message](https://www.karmahq.xyz/dao/link/forum?dao=arbitrum) with their delegate address and posting on the forum. The current Karma score formula is below, which can be adjusted by the DAO going forward:\n\n((100) \\* ((Forum Activity Score \\* 1) + (Off-chain Votes % \\* 3) + (Onchain Votes % \\* 5))) / (Sum of Weights times Max Score Setting \\* 1)\n\nKarma Score will be included in RARI staking via a smart contract that writes data onchain from the Karma API. We will include several guardrails to ensure that this aspect of the implementation is robust and decentralized:\n\n* Users can verify Karma score calculations independently.\n* The DAO will have the ability to block Karma Scores if it believes they are being calculated incorrectly.\n* If Karma scores fail to arrive or the scores are blocked by the DAO, RARI Staking will distribute rewards to all stakers regardless of whether they are delegated to an active governance participant until the situation is resolved.\n\nIn the future, we believe it would make sense to integrate delegate incentives with RARI staking so that, instead of getting delegate incentive funds from the RARI treasury, they come directly from onchain revenue.\n\nTally will build RARI staking into our existing [RARI DAO platform](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/rari-foundation), so that users can easily stake and delegate in one place.\n\n## Estimated Timeline\n\n* Post proposal on forum for feedback: early September\n* Post onchain proposal on Tally for funding: October\n* Begin development: October\n* Submit onchain proposal on Tally including full RARI Staking implementation: November\n\n## Cost\n\nTotal funds requested: $110,000 USD in RARI token\\*.\n\n$100,000 USD in RARI of funding to cover the costs of development, including the following funding categories:\n\n* $50,000 USD in RARI: Develop RARI Staking smart contracts\n  * Implement staking contracts\n  * Integrate RARI’s current and potential fee mechanisms\n  * Integrate Karma Score requirement\n  * Enable the DAO to block Karma Scores if it believes they are being calculated incorrectly\n* $20,000 USD in RARI: Integrate RARI Staking into Tally.xyz\n* $30,000 USD in RARI: Integrate Karma into RARI Staking\n  * Develop and deploy a smart contract to store key stats and Karma scores onchain\n  * Create a system to record stats onchain and store detailed delegate data off-chain (using Arweave or IPFS) for easy verification\n  * Continuously improve scoring algorithms to adapt to evolving RARI community needs\n  * Provide technical support to delegates experiencing issues with their statistics\n  * This is inclusive of a Karma integration valued at 15,000 USD/year.\n\n\\*$10,000 USD in RARI to buffer any potential price impact. Any remaining funds once $100,000 have been successfully sold into stablecoins will be returned to the treasury within 7 days of receiving the RARI tokens.&#x20;\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal should not be relied on as legal, tax, or investment advice.

      "title": "RRC-33: Continuation of RARI DAO Security Council",
      "content": "**Abstract**\n\nThis RRC-33 proposes to extend the term of the current committee consisting of a DAO-appointed 5-member multi-sig (“Security Council”), which has the ability to perform emergency and non-emergency actions such as urgent upgrades, minor, routine maintenance to the Rarible Protocol, and stoping DAO hack attempts.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nA vital body to mitigate risks associated with decentralization of the Rarible Protocol and RARI chain is the security council. All 5 members of the DAO-appointed multisig expressed desire to continue their engagement and would like to extend their term. This proposal suggests to extend all 5 of them until end of September 2025 (12 months). A functioning Security Council is a mechanism to prevent governance attacks in which an attacker acquires voting power through legitimate means (e.g. buying tokens on the open market) but uses that to manipulate votes to their own benefit - e.i. exploiting the DAO’s treasury or the Protocol via skewing governance or introducing Protocol vulnerabilities.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nAll current Security Council members performed their roles diligently and in a timely manner. They are trustworthy and engaged members of the DAO community.\n\n**Specifications**\n\n(A) Proposed Security Council members\n\nThe RARI Foundation nominates the following members of the Security Council for a 12-month term:\n\n1. Campbell Law, current Director of the Foundation; wallet address: 0xd9C3EeD65968443F8587Bb068e6530A48dB5d177\n2. Andrei Taraschuck, current delegate; wallet address: 0x25Ad94C7768108666BfDB6742aB66b109CA82946\n3. StableLab, professional delegates, represented by Mattew Stein; wallet address: Stablelab.eth\n4. Jafett Sandi, current delegate of the RARI DAO and grants committee member; wallet address: 0x636e1f9A9Cb926a69441DcE54Aa9e490CFe6D4D6\n5. Eugene Nacu, current Tech lead of RARI Foundation; wallet address: 0x978EBcd18c5A0d829C061566AA84227e9618C1A4\n\nThe Safe multisig wallet addresses the Security Council uses to perform its functions are:\n\n1. Veto function: eth 0xd35ec9F67Aa082Ae666be1716C79291f1f6e4E0a\n   (majority threshold: 3/5)\n2. Upgrade function: eth 0xa5e4514145463385aEF763Fc8161CB42b92c74f2 (majority threshold: 4/5)\n\n(B) Appointment and Removal\n\n1. The members of the Security Council will serve a term of 12 months. The future members of the council may be appointed via the RRC process or via an on-chain election process if the community decides to establish on-chain elections with a stand-alone proposal.\n2. The members of the Security Council must act upon the direction of the director of the RARI Foundation as well as the RARI token-holders pursuant to the RRC. Failure to act in accordance with directions from either the director of the RARI Foundation or the RRC Process constitutes a reason for an ad hoc removal of Security Council members. Such removal shall follow the RRC Process, and one member of the Security Council must remain in place.\n3. The number of members on the Security Council may also be expanded or reduced pursuant to the RRC Process, provided that (i) there must be at least 1 member on the Security Council and (ii) at least 1 member of the Security Council must be a director of the RARI Foundation.\n\n(C) Compensation\n\nSecurity Council members are entitled to compensation of 2,000 USDC per month.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\n\nN/A. All proposed Security Council members are already part of the multi-sig committee.\n\n**Overall Cost**\n\n$120,000 per year, to be covered from the Foundation’s operational budget.",

      "title": "RRC 30 - Enhancing RARI DAO Governance: Plan for upgrade",
      "content": "This proposal is submitted by the Rari Foundation, as instructed by the RARI DAO given their desire to make RARI DAO governance more accessible and effective.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe RARI DAO seeks to enhance its governance framework by upgrading the RARI token contract and bringing its governance from Ethereum mainnet to the Arbitrum ecosystem. This proposal outlines the implementation of a custom L2 token on Arbitrum, facilitating efficient governance processes while reducing user costs and improving overall accessibility for RARI DAO. This proposal asks to register the custom L2 token and to propose the Arbitrum DAO to implement a custom gateway on Arbitrum native bridge.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nThe RARI DAO is governed by the $RARI token, which, when locked in veRARI, grants voting access. The current token contract and governance hub are on the Ethereum mainnet, making participation in governance costly due to high gas fees for locking, delegating and on-chain voting. The RARI DAO has repeatedly asked to reduce governance fees, which is now possible thanks to the possibility of migrating governance to RARI chain and upgrading core governance contracts, including the token contract.\n\nThe current token contract is on Ethereum mainnet and is not upgradable. The RARI DAO wishes to upgrade its governance, a part of which is a token contract upgrade with snapshots and delegations embedded. We will also need to change the mapping on the Arbitrum native bridge router and implement a custom gateway pending a successful Arbitrum DAO vote.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe RARI DAO governance upgrade is designed to make governance more accessible by simplifying the UX, reducing gas fees, enabling new token functions, and allowing for multichain governance. This will allow for higher governance participation and will position the DAO to be able to govern the RARI ecosystem beyond Ethereum Mainnet, which is an imperative given that the Rarible Protocol is a multichain product and that the DAO governs the recently launched RARI chain.\n\nAs the RARI token contract is on Ethererum mainnet, and not upgradable, a new custom token contract needs to be deployed. This proposal outlines the plan for a custom L2 token implementation, starting with the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n## Key Terms\n\nRARI token: RARI DAO governance token (<https://etherscan.io/token/0xfca59cd816ab1ead66534d82bc21e7515ce441cf>\n\nRARI DAO: body governing the Rarible Protocol and RARI chain\n\nCustom L2 RARI token: upgraded and simplified RARI token to be used in RARI DAO multichain governance moving forward\n\nArbitrum ecosystem: Arbitrum One and RARI chain L3\n\n## Specifications\n\nRARI token in question (<https://etherscan.io/token/0xfca59cd816ab1ead66534d82bc21e7515ce441cf>) does not have upgradability nor allows the owner to register in the Arbitrum token bridge router.\n\nAs such, a new customer L2 contract with snapshotting and delegation functions needs to be deployed. The proposed upgraded token contract was fully audited and can be found here:&#x20;\n\ntoken: <https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/pull/305>\n\naudit: [https://github.com/pessimistic-io/audits/blob/b14c14f9b5dfac20524fdf82ab4d779f78b2\\[…\\]%20Bridged%20Token%20Security%20Analysis%20by%20Pessimistic.pdf](https://github.com/pessimistic-io/audits/blob/b14c14f9b5dfac20524fdf82ab4d779f78b2db5e/Rari%20Bridged%20Token%20Security%20Analysis%20by%20Pessimistic.pdf)\n\nToken contract was deployed to Arbitrum Sepolia, RARI testnet (which is on top of Arbitrum Sepolia) and all contracts were tested manually as well.\n\nFor this contract to be deployed on Arbitrum One and RARI chain mainnet, a custom L2 token pathway needs to be enabled in the Arbitrum native bridge, for which the RARI Foundation will submit a proposal, pending this proposal being voted in.\n\nFor context, there will be several more actions to take place for the governance upgrade to be complete on a technical level:\n\n* custom L2 token implementation\n* custom pathway in Arbitrum native bridge\n* multichain governor contract upgrade\n* current RARI token wrapping contract for mainnet tokens to be usable in the multichain governance\n\nAs a result, the L2 RARI tokens, and the wrapped mainnet tokens will be possible to use for RARI DAO governance as they are. The veRARI model will be dropped and all locks will release once as the upgrade is complete.\n\nRARI token holders will then be incentivized to bridge to the RARI chain (new governance hub), at minimum, by offering costless bridging. The RARI chain will in the meantime complete DeFi integrations to ensure there is liquidity and trading options for RARI tokens as they enter the ecosystem.\n\n## **Steps to Implement**\n\n1. upon passing of this proposal, the custom L2 token contract will be deployed on Arbitrum One and RARI chain\n2. RARI Foundation will then submit a proposal to the Arbitrum DAO to enable the custom gateway on the native bridge and investigate incentive funding possibilities\n3. Once the custom pathway is enabled, further proposals will be submitted to the RARI DAO to complete the governance upgrade (e.g. new governor contract, planned incentives)\n4. Full governance migration will be announced during fall '24; exact timing will depend on technical readiness\n\n## Timeline\n\nA custom L2 token contract is ready to deploy upon this proposal's passing.\n\nThe Arbitrum proposal is ready to be submitted to the Arbitrum DAO's forum upon this proposal's passing.\n\n## Overall costs\n\nN/A",

      "content": "## **📯 Abstract**\n\nEmpowering Latin American Artists Through Art with Happ3n XYZ and RARIBLE. A Movement for Social Change Art for Impact \\[AFI]\n\n## **🎠 Motivation**\n\nThis proposal aims to outline a strategy to incorporate Latin American artists into RARIBLE. By targeting this region, we aim to encourage artists to foster cultural exchange and take advantage of Latin America's vibrant artistic community. Through strategic outreach, initiatives on the adoption of RARIBLE and an incubation program where we aim to create a welcoming environment for Latin American artists, teach them the advantages of RARIBLE, its use, display and monetize their work through the sale of their NFTs on RARIBLE and encourage them about using the RARI Chain.\n\n## **🦄 Key Terms**\n\nHapp3n is a hybrid SocialFi + GameFi platform identifying the necessity to organize the chaos of events and content related to Web3 that emerged daily between platforms such as X, Whatsapp, Zoom, Telegram, Discord, Twitch, among others. So we saw an opportunity to bring a **functional solution** for identified users as communities, creators and enthusiasts to create a scalable business model.\n\nHapp3n provides a safe, streamlined space for event promotion and connection. Users can enjoy and stay informed, while event creators gain valuable metrics about their community audiences and get in NFT Art, Rewards, Badges and premium features.\n\nOur 1.0 version is currently active and launched in Sep 2023 in a first phase to the Spanish-speaking market to validate our idea (MVP) since we faithfully believe that there is continuous unexplored growth in those regions of the world.\n\nDespite community onboarding challenges, Happ3n is spearheaded by 2 women committed to expanding Web3 & Tech access through relatable events in Web3 & Tech. It is a project that we bet will be the way to make a bridge between Web2 and Web3. Bringing events to a new wave of people wanting to get into Web3 and not knowing where to do it or what communities they can trust.\n\nWeb: [https://happ3n.xyz](https://happ3n.xyz/)\n\n## **💿 Specifications**\n\n[Sohobiit](https://sohobiit.art/) is a renowned figure in the Latin American NFT community, having previously organized experiments to support artists on a smaller scale. ([Link to NFTanda 3.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1chZT9cCjpNNS3JnKtw5U5PBRaD9-dim_i_aF9Tcebpg/edit?usp=sharing))\n\nA significant portion of the research aimed at identifying primary centers of artistic activity has already been completed.\n\nHere are some of the statistics observed during previous experiments:\n\n\\[**All these are ideas of numbers that can support our case**]\n\n* Chart with active NFT artists per country in LATAM\n* Numbers of active traditional artists that have indicated interest in jumping into the crypto scene\n* Numbers from the previous “NFTanda”: duration, participants, artwork in #s, participants, buy & sell #s.\n\nWe aim to further advance the initial concept of NFTanda in Latin America. Our objective is not only to encourage artists to embrace the RARI Chain to grasp its advantages but also to raise awareness about Rari among non-artists.\n\nA highly significant result of endorsing this grant would be that once the return on investment (ROI) for Rarible is validated, this initiative can evolve into a recurring process that can be replicated in other communities.\n\nAlso we gonna use the Happ3n Site Tecnology, RARIBLE site, RARI CHAIN or Some L2 Chain.\n\n## **🍬 Steps to Implement**\n\nAction Plan for Developing an Art Contest called ‘Ronda NFT’ This will be implemented making a smart strategy to get some quick results as a pilot of a possible contest that can be held annually, connecting artists, expanding the RARI brand and rewarding creators as well as updating this art niche with new proposals, artistic and technological trends that emerge.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/947b3472-d86e-4f19-92a0-8cfb1d3f9b2f_original.png)\n\nBy implementing these steps, we can establish RARIBLE as a leading destination for artists in Latin America, unlocking new opportunities for cultural exchange, economic empowerment, and creative expression.\n\nWe'd also like to emphasize that to fully leverage the potential impact of this campaign, we would greatly appreciate RARI DAO's support in amplifying some of our content and campaigns, either through the grants program or as a DAO initiative.\n\n# 🎬 Timeline\n\nabout 3 or 3.5 months\n\n# 🧬 History\n\nLatin America stands out in art for its vast cultural wealth, ranging from pre-Columbian civilizations to contemporary currents, reflecting a unique mix of indigenous, European, African and Asian influences. This cultural diversity translates into a wide range of styles and themes in the region's artwork, providing an enriching and distinctive experience.\n\nDigital platforms like Rarible offer Latin American artists the opportunity to expand their global reach, connecting with a broader audience and participating in an international market. This democratization of access to art, facilitated by technology and social networks, provides new possibilities for the marketing and distribution of digital works, allowing Latin America to contribute significantly to the global artistic landscape in the 21st century.\n\n# **🧙🏻 Overall Cost**\n\n### Explanation of Budget Categories\n\n**✨  Management:** Allocated evenly across three months for planning and coordination efforts between 3 workers\n\n**🍄 Advertising & Graphics:** Consistently funded to maintain continuous promotional activities and design work\n\n**🌈 Art Awards:** Disbursed in the third month to reward top-selling artists.\n\n**🧶 Team Bonuses:** Higher in the third month due to additional compensation of $150 each for the two art curators. This is to reward their efforts and ensure their continued support and participation in the project and ecosystem.\n\n**⛑️ Contingency:** Set aside evenly for unforeseen expenses throughout the project.\n\n### Final Budget & Art Prize Award\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/41b2bf0a-7072-4fb2-a6a4-071b52d572ab_original.png)\n\n> **Total Budget $8.5K**\n\n### 🚀 Regarding the changes that have been proposed in the community calls and comments into RARI forum Foundation, I bring you the final proposal.",

      "title": "RRC-29: A Clearer Grants Committee Mandate",
      "content": "# Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to define a more transparent structure for the [Grants Committee](https://forum.rari.foundation/t/follow-up-to-rrc-12-rari-foundation-grants-committee-selection/1742) and ultimately for the Ecosystem Growth Fund.\n\n# Motivation\n\nTaking into account what could be called an initial GC pilot which we are about to wrap up, the need to define comprehensive strategies and focus areas with grantees is required. There is also the need to communicate clearer GC responsibilities, compensation, and better community involvement in GC activities.\n\nMore specifically, this will better help us drive development and usage, cultivating enthusiastic users and talented builders that will help shape the future of the Rarible protocol and chain, fostering a sustainable creator economy.\n\n# Rationale\n\nGC needs a set of guiding principles to steer us forward. The first grant sprint helped us define and set up good structures early on but also opened our eyes to areas where we could do things better both internally and externally.\n\n# Key Terms\n\nGC: Grants Committee\n\nRFP: Request for Proposal\n\n# Specification\n\nThe current structure focuses on having two community members and two Foundation member on the committee. One member acts as the grant’s lead responsible for coordination; the other committee members assume evaluator roles, overseeing the grant application evaluation process and supporting grantees, helping them meet and exceed their milestones.\n\nIn the initial set-up of the GC, responsibilities were not spelled out, and no real KPI was set to be tracked as a deliverable for the working group. However, after sprint one of the Ecosystem Fund, we are outlining some responsibilities and suggesting some KPIs so the community can easily track the progress of the GC.\n\n## GC Responsibilities\n\n* The Committee will self-determine how they reach consensus on grant applications from the intake form as well as the recommendations from the GC Lead.\n* The GC will operate transparently by communicating progress during governance calls and sharing information and feedback in public forums.\n* Work in iterations (quarterly) - which will allow us to be flexible in funds usage\n* Define minimum and maximum allocation for grantees. This tells what kind of program we’ll be running. i.e small and fast grants, or midsize grants that can span over six months\n* The GC will also publish a report on their process, learnings, and outcomes at the end of each cycle (three months).\n* Creation of RFPs and marketing content to communicate updates and opportunities to the builders.\n* Communicate the information regarding approval/rejection of proposals to the RARI DAO community regularly.\n* Discuss program improvements within the team during scheduled meetings.\n* Each member of the GC will transparently share Conflict of Interest disclosure with the community whenever necessary.\n* Publish the qualified projects for every cycle along with our rationale for supporting them on Forum.\n* Continue iterating on grant process.\n* If something is not clearly outlined here, the GC has decision-making authority over its operations and may decide to make exceptions for proposers at their discretion.\n\n## GC KPIs\n\n* Number of Applications Received: Total number of grant applications received. This should include both accepted and rejected applications and a brief note explaining the decision.\n* Grant Distribution Timeline: Measure the time taken to review, approve, and distribute grants, ensuring a timely turnaround time of no longer than 10 days from application to resolution\n* Grant Amount Disbursed: Monitor the total value of grants distributed to successful applicants including distribution across projects, and budget utilization rate.\n* User Metrics: Measure the increase in the number of users or active participants in the protocol as a result of funded projects.\n\n## MoS\n\n* Successful review of grantee proposals\n* Report submitted to the community at the end of every grant pilot\n\n## Multisig Policies\n\n* Assuming the same four member squad in control of the Ecosystem Grants Fund, the multi-sig will be structured as 3 out of 4.\n* multisig address: 0x8099b56FC797731f03dA9074a65bBb5Adf16b09F\n\n# Budget\n\nOf the GC members, two are from the Foundation, and two are from the RARI DAO community. Foundation members either part-time or full-time get compensated from the yearly operations budget. However, the two community members are not compensated.\n\nI am proposing we compensate these two community members in $RARI that gets unlocked at the end of each cycle. More specifically, I suggest 12k $RARI for each member gets locked through Hedgey around the time the operational budget goes live in December then at the start of next year 2025, and going forward, 3k $RARI is unlocked for each member at the end of every cycle (quarterly).\n\nConcerning the current situation where we are already nearing the end of a cycle and with the two community members ([@Jaf](https://forum.rari.foundation/u/jaf) and [@WinVerse](https://forum.rari.foundation/u/winverse)) having already worked for six months, I propose 3k $RARI each for their contributions thus far, and a six-month lockup of 12k $RARI for the remainder of the year. 6k $RARI will get unlocked at the end of the next cycle and if one more cycle is done before the end of the year, the remaining 6k is unlocked. All unused funds will be sent back to the treasury.\n\nThere is no separate compensation as multisig signers.",

      "title": "RRC-28 Implementing a RARI Protocol Fee",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis proposal suggests altering the Rarible protocol’s fee structure to create a protocol fee of 0.5%. The revenue generated from this fee would all go to the RARI DAO treasury. This will enhance the DAO’s financial resources and create more alignment between users and the DAO.\n\n## Motivation\n\nImplementing a fee structure that directs fee revenue will help bolster the sustainability of the RARI DAO. It will also create more autonomy for the RARI DAO as the DAO will not have to rely on external capital and will instead have more resources available to fund DAO initiatives. This will help with the progressive decentrilization of the DAO and make the DAO stronger for the future.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe proposal aligns with RARI DAO’s mission of broadening the NFT use case horizon by creating a creator-centric and fully decentralized robust ecosystem. By channeling revenue to the DAO treasury, it enhances the financial stability and resilience of the protocol, enabling further development, community initiatives, and long-term sustainability. This helps to address the Long term sustainability of the DAO, which is one of the three core values of the RARI DAO.\n\n## Specifications\n\nSince the protocol’s contracts are fully controlled by the DAO, the on-chain Tally proposal can automatically update the fee structure using Tally’s executable code feature.\n\nThe proposed fee would be 0.5% (0.25% seller fee + 0.25% buyer fee). All 100% of the Protocol Fees will be sent to the RARI DAO treasury to help bolster the autonomy and long-term sustainability of the RARI DAO.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n* DAO discusses appropriate fee structures.\n* Tally proposal is created with executable code to update fee structure and direct revenue to the DAO automatically\n* Implement new order version with enabled protocol fees\n\n## Timeline\n\n* 1 week for the DAO to decide on fee structure and provide opinions on the proposal\n* 1 week for Tally vote\n* Time for the protocol team to implement new order version with enabled protocol fees\n* Upon the passing of the Tally vote, the contracts will automatically be upgraded to reflect the new fees and direct said fees to the DAO treasury\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nThere is no cost associated with this proposal.",

      "title": "RRC-27 Proposal: Repurposing Legacy Wallet",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis proposal outlines the plan to reclaim unclaimed tokens from the legacy [wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfdff6b56cce39482032b27140252ff4f16432785) and diversify the recovered funds for the growth and sustainability of the RARI ecosystem. A portion of the funds will be repurposed to fuel ecosystem growth activities, while a reserve will be maintained for future claims.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to optimize the DAO’s financial resources and deploy a new ecosystem growth fund with focus on the RARI chain, in contrast to the fund already deployed for the Rarible Protocol (see [RRC12](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/rari-foundation/proposal/91231757847957673254856060029773188347075977034191281481043953471129775685253)). By reclaiming tokens and reallocating them to ecosystem fund activities, we aim to enhance the sustainability and growth of the DAO, through expansion of the RARI chain ecosystem across DeFi, Infrastructure, GameFi, SocialFi and other important sectors. Finally, the repurposing of funds will increase available capital to invest in high-impact strategic partnerships, such as grants to researchers, developers, strategic partners and others with the aim of increasing activity primarily on the RARI chain and elevating visibility of the utility and governance of RARI token.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe motivation behind this proposal aligns with the core values of the RARI DAO community, emphasizing transparency, democratic decision-making, and prudent financial stewardship. Repurposing unclaimed tokens and diversifying the recovered funds into strategic investments ensures a robust foundation for future growth, while also safeguarding against market volatility and unforeseen circumstances. The RARI Foundation shall administer and manage these funds as part of the RARI Ecosystem Growth Fund.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n* Legacy Wallet: Refers to the wallet containing unclaimed tokens from past airdrops.\n  * Address: 0xFDfF6b56CcE39482032b27140252FF4F16432785\n* Token Reclamation: The process of reclaiming unclaimed tokens from the legacy wallet.\n* Ecosystem Growth Fund: Fund dedicated to supporting strategic partnerships, loans, grants, and other initiatives aimed at fostering sustainable development within the RARI ecosystem.\n\n## Specifications\n\nLegacy wallet (0xFDfF6b56CcE39482032b27140252FF4F16432785) contains over 1.1M unclaimed RARI tokens in airdrops and early rewards. The funds are unused but can be repurposed, pending a public announcement and a grace period for the public to claim their tokens.\n\nThe remaining funds in the legacy wallet shall then be repurposed to help drive RARI ecosystem growth.\nIt’s prudent to keep a reserve for potential future claims and distribute remainder across grants, loans, and strategic partnerships .\n\nSuggested distribution:\n\n* 25% reserved for potenital future claim\n* 75% reminder distributed across:\n  * Grants (20%)\n  * Loans (40%)\n  * Strategic Partnerships(15%)\n\nThe RARI Foundation will be asked to manage the Ecosystem Growth Fund, and to publish quarterly reports. After a period of 12 months, the RARI DAO may request unallocated funds to be returned to the DAO’s main treasury.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n1. Upon approval of this proposal, recipients of RARI airdrop or early rewards programs who haven’t claimed their $RARI will have a 30 day grace period to claim their tokens. The claim period will start on the day of the execution. Notice of this claim window will be announced on RARI’s discord, X, Farcaster, newsletter, and website. Claiming can be done on [rari.foundation/claim](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Frari.foundation%2Fclaim\\&data=05%7C02%7CINam%40fenwick.com%7C79faa73f121e417706fd08dc81a8ef7b%7Cc2fc0a3f969f440c8b638105357eca2a%7C0%7C0%7C638527809806277080%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C\\&sdata=cWpFx%2F6SQGljr03vCX3KqF4%2F53gZZz0tDxtKvbnbj9o%3D\\&reserved=0)\n2. After the grace period, the full amount of the recovered Legacy treasury will be sent to the RARI Foundation’s main wallet, eth:0x2a83d2891Ef3df6967E3C2e9b69cCc7aD029736B. These funds will be distributed amongst specific ecosystem growth Multisig wallets as established under RRC 12.\n3. The Ecosystem Growth Fund will be repurposed approximately in the following areas: 20% grants, 40% strategic loans, 15% strategic partnerships. The remaining 25% shall be reserved for future claims, ensuring liquidity and responsiveness to community needs.\n4. RARI Foundation will publish quarterly reports on the Ecosystem Growth Fund’s activities.\n\n## Timeline\n\n* Announce the token reclamation process, provide a 30-day window for reclaiming tokens which will initiate on the day the proposal is executed.\n* Provide regular progress updates to the RARI DAO community throughout the implementation phase of this proposal.\n* Repurpose the unclaimed funds at the 30 day mark upon execution.\n* Provide transparency and regular updates to the RARI DAO on how the ecosystem fund is reallocating the resources.\n\n## Costs\n\nNo costs are associated with this proposal.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis proposal represents a strategic opportunity for the community to optimize its financial resources and foster sustainable growth. By reclaiming idle, unclaimed tokens and reallocating them to ecosystem fund activities, this proposal will reflect the foundation’s commitment to responsible financial management, transparency, and community engagement.\n\n* Encourage the community to claim their tokens from the legacy wallet within 30 days of the proposal passing.\n* Allocate 75% of the remaining tokens to the Rari Ecosystem Fund managed by the Foundation.\n* Reserve 25% of the tokens for future claims, maintaining liquidity and responsiveness to community needs.",

      "content": "## **📯 Abstract**\n\nEmpowering Latin American Artists Through Art with Happ3n XYZ and RARIBLE. A Movement for Social Change Art for Impact \\[AFI]\n\n## **🎠 Motivation**\n\nThis proposal aims to outline a strategy to incorporate Latin American artists into RARIBLE. By targeting this region, we aim to encourage artists to foster cultural exchange and take advantage of Latin America's vibrant artistic community. Through strategic outreach, initiatives on the adoption of RARIBLE and an incubation program where we aim to create a welcoming environment for Latin American artists, teach them the advantages of RARIBLE, its use, display and monetize their work through the sale of their NFTs on RARIBLE and encourage them about using the RARI Chain.\n\n## **🦄 Key Terms**\n\nHapp3n is a hybrid SocialFi + GameFi platform identifying the necessity to organize the chaos of events and content related to Web3 that emerged daily between platforms such as X, Whatsapp, Zoom, Telegram, Discord, Twitch, among others. So we saw an opportunity to bring a **functional solution** for identified users as communities, creators and enthusiasts to create a scalable business model.\n\nHapp3n provides a safe, streamlined space for event promotion and connection. Users can enjoy and stay informed, while event creators gain valuable metrics about their community audiences and get in NFT Art, Rewards, Badges and premium features.\n\nOur 1.0 version is currently active and launched in Sep 2023 in a first phase to the Spanish-speaking market to validate our idea (MVP) since we faithfully believe that there is continuous unexplored growth in those regions of the world.\n\nDespite community onboarding challenges, Happ3n is spearheaded by 2 women committed to expanding Web3 & Tech access through relatable events in Web3 & Tech. It is a project that we bet will be the way to make a bridge between Web2 and Web3. Bringing events to a new wave of people wanting to get into Web3 and not knowing where to do it or what communities they can trust.\n\nWeb: <https://happ3n.xyz>\n\n## **💿 Specifications**\n\n[Sohobiit](https://sohobiit.art/) is a renowned figure in the Latin American NFT community, having previously organized experiments to support artists on a smaller scale. ([Link to NFTanda 3.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1chZT9cCjpNNS3JnKtw5U5PBRaD9-dim_i_aF9Tcebpg/edit?usp=sharing))\n\nA significant portion of the research aimed at identifying primary centers of artistic activity has already been completed.\n\nHere are some of the statistics observed during previous experiments:\n\n\\[**All these are ideas of numbers that can support our case**]\n\n* Chart with active NFT artists per country in LATAM\n* Numbers of active traditional artists that have indicated interest in jumping into the crypto scene\n* Numbers from the previous “NFTanda”: duration, participants, artwork in #s, participants, buy & sell #s.\n\nWe aim to further advance the initial concept of NFTanda in Latin America. Our objective is not only to encourage artists to embrace the RARI Chain to grasp its advantages but also to raise awareness about Rari among non-artists.\n\nA highly significant result of endorsing this grant would be that once the return on investment (ROI) for Rarible is validated, this initiative can evolve into a recurring process that can be replicated in other communities.\n\nAlso we gonna use the Happ3n Site Tecnology, RARIBLE site, RARI CHAIN or Some L2 Chain.\n\n## **🍬 Steps to Implement**\n\nAction Plan for Developing an Art Contest called ‘Ronda NFT’ This will be implemented making a smart strategy to get some quick results as a pilot of a possible contest that can be held annually, connecting artists, expanding the RARI brand and rewarding creators as well as updating this art niche with new proposals, artistic and technological trends that emerge.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/947b3472-d86e-4f19-92a0-8cfb1d3f9b2f_original.png)\n\nBy implementing these steps, we can establish RARIBLE as a leading destination for artists in Latin America, unlocking new opportunities for cultural exchange, economic empowerment, and creative expression.\n\nWe'd also like to emphasize that to fully leverage the potential impact of this campaign, we would greatly appreciate RARI DAO's support in amplifying some of our content and campaigns, either through the grants program or as a DAO initiative.\n\n# 🎬 Timeline\n\nabout 3 or 3.5 months\n\n# 🧬 History\n\nLatin America stands out in art for its vast cultural wealth, ranging from pre-Columbian civilizations to contemporary currents, reflecting a unique mix of indigenous, European, African and Asian influences. This cultural diversity translates into a wide range of styles and themes in the region's artwork, providing an enriching and distinctive experience.\n\nDigital platforms like Rarible offer Latin American artists the opportunity to expand their global reach, connecting with a broader audience and participating in an international market. This democratization of access to art, facilitated by technology and social networks, provides new possibilities for the marketing and distribution of digital works, allowing Latin America to contribute significantly to the global artistic landscape in the 21st century.\n\n# **🧙🏻 Overall Cost**\n\n### Explanation of Budget Categories\n\n**✨  Management:** Allocated evenly across three months for planning and coordination efforts between 3 workers\n\n**🍄 Advertising & Graphics:** Consistently funded to maintain continuous promotional activities and design work\n\n**🌈 Art Awards:** Disbursed in the third month to reward top-selling artists.\n\n**🧶 Team Bonuses:** Higher in the third month due to additional compensation of $150 each for the two art curators. This is to reward their efforts and ensure their continued support and participation in the project and ecosystem.\n\n**⛑️ Contingency:** Set aside evenly for unforeseen expenses throughout the project.\n\n### Final Budget & Art Prize Award\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/41b2bf0a-7072-4fb2-a6a4-071b52d572ab_original.png)\n\n> **Total Budget $8.5K**\n\n### 🚀 Regarding the changes that have been proposed in the community calls and comments into RARI forum Foundation, I bring you the final proposal.\n\n##",

The ‘TokWG’ will operate for three months, with the primary goal of researching & proposing the first draft of tokenomics strategies to enhance the economic sustainability and growth of the RARI DAO ecosystem\n\n# Motivation\n\nEffective tokenomics is critical for the long-term success and sustainability of any crypto product. With the rapid growth of the crypto space as well as the DAO, it is imperative to revisit and refine our tokenomics model to ensure it aligns with the community’s goals and fosters sustainable growth. Establishing a dedicated TokWG will provide the necessary focus and expertise to develop innovative and effective tokenomics solutions.\n\n# Rationale\n\nForming a TokWG will enable a concentrated effort on improving RARI’s tokenomics. By leveraging the collective expertise within our community and external advisors, we can create well-researched and tailored tokenomics strategies.

      "title": "RRC-25 Lock-up revision for Ecosystem Grants",
      "content": "**Abstract**\n\nThis proposal revises the lock-up period for $RARI tokens awarded to grantees of the Ecosystem Grants Program from the RARI Ecosystem Growth Fund. It builds on the previous proposal, [**RRC-12: RARI Ecosystem Growth Fund** 2](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/rari-foundation/proposal/91231757847957673254856060029773188347075977034191281481043953471129775685253?chart=0).\n\nPreviously, RRC-12 stated: “The individual grants should take the form of locked RARI that is revocable for a period of 6 months in the following tranches: 50% upon grant approval and 50% upon project delivery. This mechanism aims to ensure the grant recipients deliver their projects in full.”\n\nBased on insights from Sprint #1, the Ecosystem Growth Fund (EGF) Committee proposes these changes:\n\n* Remove the lock-up period for $RARI after full project delivery.\n* Allow the EGF Committee to decide on a case-by-case basis if $RARI tokens should be locked until project completion and hitting the last milestone.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe EGF Committee recommends revising the lock-up period to remove barriers for accessing funds earlier while ensuring projects are delivered fully and on time. Most grants involve short-term projects, making a 6-month wait impractical. This change would also attract more established projects requiring upfront payments.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe proposal aims to:\n\n1. Attract more mature projects with proven track records to the RARI Ecosystem that require upfront payment.\n2. Remove barriers to accessing funds for projects that need the grant to cover development costs.\n\n**Specifications**\n\nFrom Sprint #1, the EGF Committee noted that most projects do not exceed 2 months. A 6-month lock-up period can cause frustration. Therefore, the Committee suggests granting immediate access to funds upon full project delivery.\n\nAdditionally, the Committee proposes that while it is generally reasonable to lock $RARI until project completion, some projects might need a portion of the grant upfront to cover initial costs.\n\nThe Committee suggests evaluating on a case-by-case basis whether a project can access a portion of funds after grant approval, this is only for exceptional cases where the project needs to cover development costs.\n\nMaintaining milestones as a part of grants will help protect RARI DAO from potential grants’ mishandling.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\n\nAs Sprint #1 of the Ecosystem Grants Program concludes and participants are selected, the results of this proposal will be applied immediately, affecting Sprint #1 applicants. The lock-up period terms will be outlined in grant agreements and managed via [Hedgey Finance 1](https://hedgey.finance/).\n\n**Timeline**\n\nThe voting period is advised to conclude by June 10th on Tally, followed by a cooling-down period.\n\n**Overall Cost**\n\nThere is no cost associated to implementing the proposal.",

      "title": "RRC-21 Gas Fee Rebate for Delegates on-chain governance & Gasless voting params",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nReimburse gas fees spent by DAO delegates when participating in on-chain governance on Tally starting with RRC-12. And establishing the parameters for gasless voting moving forward.\n\n## Abstract\n\nRARI DAO delegates are responsible of promoting new proposals into Tally, voting on-chain, queueing, and executing proposals. These on-chain transactions have significant gas costs measured in ETH. These fees are paid by the wallet sending the transaction, the RARI DAO delegate.\n\nConsidering that Tally now offers gasless voting, this proposal aims to establish a Gas Fee rebate mechanism for delegates who have participated in governance on-chain activities on Tally, starting with RRC-12. Furthermore, it seeks to define the parameters for wallets to qualify for gasless voting through Tally in the future.\n\n## Motivation\n\nGas fees in Ethereum have been costly and prohibitive, especially for delegates. Implementing this proposal aligns with the strategies being executed by RARI DAO to further democratize, incentivize, and remove barriers for existing and new delegates.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe Delegates Launchpad program is a platform for new talent to come to RARI DAO and develop new, exciting ideas to grow the RARI ecosystem. In parallel with this program, RARI DAO has been developing more infrastructure and strategies to foster a more decentralized and sustainable ecosystem for artists, collectors, and builders.\n\n* [**RRC-12: RARI Ecosystem Growth Fund**](https://forum.rari.foundation/t/rrc-12-rari-ecosystem-growth-fund/1697): a fund composed of three parts: Grants Program, Strategic Loans, and Strategic Partnerships.\n* [**RRC-19 Rari Chain Sequencer Revenue Split**](https://forum.rari.foundation/t/rrc-19-rari-chain-sequencer-revenue-split/1855): allocating 50% of the RARI Chain Sequencer Revenue as:\n* 15% to the Creator Fund to fund creative projects and initiatives\n* 35% for DAO Treasury to fund DAO initiatives and fund operational costs.\n\nThis proposal aims to remove barriers for delegates and incentivize a more active engagement of the delegate community. Broader participation leads to better decision-making for RARI DAO.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Who is elegible for Gas fee rebate?\n\nAll delegates that have participated in one of the following activities starting with [RRC-12](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/rari-foundation/proposal/91231757847957673254856060029773188347075977034191281481043953471129775685253).\n\n* Promoting a Proposal into RARI DAO Tally\n* Voting on-chain on a proposal on RARI DAO Tally\n* Queueing a proposal for execution on RARI DAO Tally\n* Executing a proposal on RARI DAO Tally\n\n### Retroactive Reimbursement Claiming Process\n\nFor the purpose of retroactive reimbursement, a claim period will open 30 days from the proposal passing for delegates that are eligible for Gas fee rebate.\n\nTo reduce the administrative burden for RARI, the claiming process should be initiated by Delegates themselves. The option to submit a Gas Rebate Application to RARI via a Form, shall include:\n\n1. The list of transactions associated with the activities mentioned above\n2. The corresponding gas fees spent on each transaction\n3. Etherscan links detailing the above\n\nOnce an application has been submitted to RARI DAO, an appointed Governance Facilitator from the Foundation will review the applications and proceed with gas rebates.\n\nNOTE:\nAny gas fees not claimed over the 30 days period mentioned above will be automatically forfeited.\n\n### Eligibility for Gasless Voting on Tally\n\n* Wallet must have at least 300 RARI in delegated voting power\n* 10 votes per wallet. We can re-up in Q1 2025, or if there are an unexpectedly large number of proposals later this year.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. RARI Foundation will cover gasless voting from 2024 operational budget by setting $3,000 for gasless voting with Tally\n2. Gasless voting does not include submitting proposals. If proposal submission is to be free, there is a concern about spamming governance. Delegates can ask for proposal submission compensation as a fee when posting the proposal instead.\n\n## Steps to Implement:\n\n* After the proposal is approved, the RARI Foundation will collaborate with the Tally team to enable gasless voting for our DAO in Tally.\n* A reimbursement form for the aforementioned governance activities will be made available 48hrs from the proposal execution. Immediately after the form is available the 30 days window to claim starts and the foundation will have 15 business days to review the claims and disburse the payment.\n\n## Budget\n\nThis proposal will not incur any cost to the DAO in 2024 because the RARI Foundation will allocate the necessary funds for the rest of the year.",

      "title": "RRC-22 DAO Treasury Diversification Plan",
      "content": "Author: Autonomous\n\nReviewers: Addie Giese, Jana Bertram, Elika Mahdavi\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis proposal outlines the treasury diversification plan for the DAO aimed at strengthening its financial position and fostering sustainable growth. The plan involves reallocating a portion of the treasury into stablecoins and generating yield through safe investment vehicles, facilitated by the Rari Foundation.\n\nRationale:\n\nDiversifying the DAO’s treasury mitigates exposure to market volatility and enhances financial resilience. By allocating funds into stablecoins and yield-generating strategies, the DAO can optimize returns while minimizing risk, ensuring a solid foundation for future initiatives.\n\nMotivation:\n\nThe motivation behind this proposal is to secure the DAO’s financial stability and flexibility. Through strategic diversification and prudent investment, the DAO aims to generate additional income, reduce reliance on volatile assets, and position itself for long-term sustainability by ensuring at least a 4 year cash runway target.\n\nSteps to Implement:\n\n* Foundation Facilitation:\n  * The Rari Foundation will execute treasury diversification on behalf of the DAO using its strategic partnerships.\n* Stablecoin Allocation:\n  * Swap 25% of the DAO treasury (excluding the Legacy treasury) into stablecoins over the next 12 months, utilizing the Foundation’s OTC partners and on/off-ramp solutions. Larger deals with institutions can also be considered on a case by case basis to assist with this process.\n  * The total tokens that will be swapped is RARI 1,564,216 (25% of DAO treasury). The total quantity of stablecoins to be received will vary depending on the token price, but the strategy will include a VWAP as well as a floor price over a set period.\n* Yield Generation:\n  * Invest stablecoins in carefully selected, well-researched on-chain and off-chain yield-generating vehicles to maximize returns while prioritizing security, risk mitigation and transparency.\n  * The majority of the stablecoins will be included in on-chain yield generating vehicles to ensure transparency, but off-chain vehicles will be used as supplemental.\n  * Refer to below pros and cons to note why a mix of both on-chain and off-chain solutions are important.\n    * On-chain pros: Transactions and investment holdings are transparent, immutable and secure. All transactions can be seen in an instant by all community participants.\n    * On-chain cons: Transaction fees can be costly, smart contract risks and track record not as mature as for traditional investments.\n    * Off-chain pros: Ensures diversification from on-chain investments and reduces smart contract risks. Longer proven track record. Reduced transaction fees.\n    * Off-chain cons: Less transparency and timely process.\n  * Yield generating strategies can include for example some of the below:\n    * [Ondo - Yield generation](https://ondo.finance/usdy) (On-chain)\n    * [Franklin Templeton - Yield generation](https://www.franklintempleton.com/investments/options/money-market-funds/products/29386/SINGLCLASS/franklin-on-chain-u-s-government-money-fund/FOBXX#why-this-fund) (Off-chain)\n* Risk Management:\n  * Conduct thorough due diligence in selecting stablecoins and yield-generating options.\n  * Monitor market conditions and adjust the allocation strategy as needed.\n* Transparency and Accountability:\n  * Regularly communicate diversification progress and yield generated to the DAO community.\n  * Establish a transparent reporting mechanism for the Foundation’s execution on behalf of the DAO.\n* Parameters\n  * None of the investments to be locked for more than 12 months\n  * Vehicles used will have no early liquidation fees\n  * Funds can be requested from the DAO if needed\n* Examples\n  * Treasury diversification is considered a prudent strategy in the ecosystem\n  * [Arbitrum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/final-arbitrum-stable-treasury-endowment-program/20139)\n  * [Gitcoin](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-treasury-diversification/9698)\n* Dedicated multisig wallet\n  * A dedicated multisig wallet address has been created which will be used only for Treasury diversification purposes. Address: 0x47e358E461C1d005aEC65E63F01fa5447f7f139c\n\nTimeline:\n\nCommence the treasury diversification process immediately, with the goal of completing the 25% stablecoin allocation within the next 12 months.\n\nExperience on Treasury diversification plans:\n\nAutonomous works on various Foundation’s treasury diversification strategies, as we are contracted directly with the Foundations in providing day to day administrative services, rather than through a publicly executed proposal. These strategies are discussed with the Foundation team members and approved by the Board of Directors and then executed by us to ensure the Foundations have a sustainable cash runway for future expenses.\n\nWe have been delivering these services for various Foundation companies since 2022 through our experienced team of professionals. Refer to our website for more information on our team and services: <https://autonomousprojects.co/>\n\nBudget:\n\nThe budget for this proposal includes the costs associated with executing the treasury diversification plan, such as fees for OTC trades and potential investment expenses.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBy entrusting the Rari Foundation to execute this treasury diversification plan, the DAO aims to optimize its financial holdings, reduce risk, and ensure a solid foundation for future initiatives. This strategic approach aligns with the DAO’s commitment to responsible financial management and transparency.",

      "title": "RRC-23: Framework for setting up a working group",
      "content": "# Abstract\n\nThis proposal outlines a framework delegates shall follow in order kickstart a working group\n\n# Motivation\n\nDiscussions with the Rari foundation on how to proceed with incentivizing work within the DAO has found consensus on the fact that Working Groups are the way forward for sustainable work within the DAO. However, without a clear structure on how to go about working groups within the DAO it will be difficult to maintain cohesion and find a common path forward.\n\n# Rationale\n\nA framework for working groups within the DAO allows contributors to follow clear guidelines to establish, operate and disband any working groups within the DAO as well as for the delegates to keep groups accountable to their mandate, KPIs and MoSs.\n\n# Key Terms\n\nWorking Group(WG): A group of contributors working together to achieve a purpose\n\nSteward: An individual or organisation which acts as a leader and a primary point of contact for each WG\n\nKPIs: Key Performance Indicators\n\nMoS: Measure of Success\n\n# Specification\n\n### Procedure:\n\nAny delegate with a verified governance identity can propose to kickstart a WG. A delegate must follow the standard governance procedure in order to kickstart the working group. The proposal specifications should include:\n\n1. Goals\n2. Timeline\n3. KPIs\n4. MoS\n5. Multi-sig policies\n6. Roles & responsibilities of each member\n7. Budget\n\n### Categories:\n\nA working group can be of two types:\n\n* Trust\n* Skill\n\nBoth types can be proposed by any delegate however:\n\n* Trust based WG (such as a Grants Committee) requires delegates to vote in each member who will participate in the working group\n* Skill based working groups only require delegates to approve the proposed steward. The steward is then delegated the responsibility to add members to the WG based on their competence and skills within the parameters approved by the WG specifications\n\n### Structure:\n\nA WG is a group of contributors led by a steward, who work together to achieve a specific goal within a specified timeline and given budget.\n\n### Funding:\n\nA workgroup should ask for sufficient funds to meet its short term goals or three-month goals, whichever is smaller.\n\nA Rari DAO WG is solely responsible for activities within the Rari DAO, hence the WG shall not engage in grant seeking activities in order projects or DAOs unless the goal of the WG is business development or fundraising. Consequently the DAO must ensure that the WG is sufficiently funded to carry out its mandate.\n\n### Compensation\n\nWorking in a Rari DAO WG is not a full-time job and at best can be considered as a part time job. Each working group shall submit a compensation request which is suited to their needs and best reflects the true expenses associated with fulfilling their goals\n\n### WG Continuation:\n\nOnce a WG has run out of resources to sustain itself, it may choose to disband itself or ask for more funding to continue its operations. Any delegate can propose to disband any workgroup provided the delegate can offer a clear rationale and the DAO votes in favour of such a proposal.\n\n### Budget\n\nThis proposal has no cost",

      "content": "Authors: Autonomous\n\nReviewers: Campbell Law, Jana Bertram\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThis proposal advocates for the allocation of a $549,933 surplus (details below) from the 2023 H1 ([link](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/rari-foundation/proposal/68627294958529655990723245148095800568670717790016454264456171705044472832043?chart=timeline)) and H2 ([link](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/rari-foundation/proposal/10270563539177653122971757446254409057649912616228898552627881307014101638013?chart=bubble)) Operational budgets, divided equally between establishing a cash reserve and initiating safe yield generation and investment strategies. The aim is to bolster the financial security and sustainability of the organization through prudent financial management.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe surplus from the 2023 operational budgets offers an opportunity to fortify the organization’s financial standing and mitigate risks. Building cash reserves will create a buffer for managing emergencies and capitalizing on strategic opportunities. Meanwhile, investing in safe yield generation initiatives will diversify revenue streams and enhance long-term financial sustainability. Allocating the surplus funds proactively enables the organization to navigate uncertainties effectively and position itself for future growth.\n\nRationale\n\nCash Reserves Allocation (50%)\n\n* Transfer stablecoins to a multi-signature wallet with 2 of 3 signers, including a Foundation member, Director, and Autonomous representative.\n* This setup ensures security and accountability in managing the cash reserves, providing flexibility for timely decision-making in accessing funds for emergencies or strategic endeavors.\n\nSafe Yield Generation Allocation (50%)\n\n* Utilize a combination of safe yield-generating strategies such as, for example, [Franklin Templeton tokenized fund](https://www.franklintempleton.com/investments/options/money-market-funds/products/29386/SINGLCLASS/franklin-on-chain-u-s-government-money-fund/FOBXX#why-this-fund)\n* This strategy aims to optimize yield generation while preserving capital, enhancing the organization’s financial sustainability.\n\n\n\n### [](#key-terms-1)Key Terms\n\n$RARI - ERC 20 token, used in the RARI DAO governance\n\nStablecoins - USDC or USDT tokens that hold 1 to 1 value with USD\n\nSpecifics:\n\nOverview of 2023 operational budgets reconciliation:\n\n![](https://forum.rari.foundation/uploads/default/original/1X/ef1355ee8c7d859964bd78f7e2bbba2fc8b2ac78.png)\n\n\n\nSteps to implement:\n\nThe main approvals needed for this proposal include:\n\n1. Approval for the allocation of $549,933 surplus from the 2023 operational budget.\n2. Endorsement for the establishment of a multi-signature wallet for cash reserves with designated signers.\n3. Authorization for stablecoin conversion to USD through the Foundation’s OTC partner.\n4. Approval for investing in the tokenized Treasury bill fund for safe yield generation.\n\n\n\nTimeline:\n\nApproximately 6 months to maximize yield generation through short-term T-bill investments. Yield is generated on a daily basis. There are no early liquidation fees, but the longer the funds are held the more yield is generated.\n\nCosts:\n\nOTC trades have a built-in trading cost and yield generating vehicles have associated fees. The Foundation has negotiated these fees and they are in-line with industry standards. The Foundation itself will not charge any fees for execution of the plan.",

      "title": "RRC-19 Rari Chain Sequencer Revenue Split",
      "content": "# Abstract\n\nThe proposal aims to create a plan for what to do with the RARI Chain sequencer revenue that is now being generated. The proposed revenue share is a 50/50 split between the Rari DAO and the Rari Foundation. The DAO’s share would go towards the DAO treasury (35%) and a new sub-treasury called the “Creator Fund” (15%). The foundation’s Share would go towards operational and maintenance costs (30%) and towards repaying the Arbitrum Grant (20%).\n\n# Motivation\n\nWith the new Rari Chain now generating sequencer fees the Rari Community needs to decide where these funds should go. Implementing this revenue-sharing model ensures a fair distribution of resources between the RARI DAO and the Foundation, fostering sustainability and growth for both entities. By allocating funds to a creator fund, we support creator innovation within the community, while bolstering the main treasury ensures financial stability for future DAO endeavors. Allocating a portion of the Foundation’s share to pay off the Arbitrum grant will help fulfill the Foundation’s agreement agreement with Arbitrum and allocating funds towards maintenance and operations ensures the continued smooth functioning of the chain.\n\n# Rationale\n\nThis proposal aligns with the RARI DAO community’s mission to foster a decentralized and sustainable ecosystem for digital art and collectibles. By sharing revenue between the DAO and the Foundation, we ensure that both entities have the necessary resources to support the growth and development of the RARI ecosystem. The allocation of funds to a creative fund reflects our commitment to nurturing creativity and innovation within the community while directing resources to the main treasury strengthens the financial foundation of the DAO.\n\n# Key Terms (optional)\n\n* RARI Foundation: A Cayman Islands legal entity that represents the DAO IRL. It allows the RARI DAO to have a formal representation, enter into contractual relationships, and utilize the other benefits and protections of a legal entity.\n* Creator Fund: A new treasury that would be created and used to fund creators and their initiatives within the RARI community.\n* Main Treasury: The primary repository of funds controlled by the RARI DAO for supporting various initiatives and projects.\n* Sequencer Fee Revenue: Rewards collected in ETH generated from transactions on the RARI Chain\n\n# Specifications\n\nThe RARI DAO and RARI Foundation would split the Sequencer Revenue 50/50 with the funds more specifically being broken down into the following categories.\n\n## DAO’s Share - 50%\n\n### 15% to a Creator Fund\n\nRRC-19 proposes creating a new sub-treasury called the Creator Fund. This treasury would be funded using 15% of all sequencer revenue generated. This treasury will be reserved to fund creative projects and initiatives.\n\nHaving a new treasury explicitly for creative initiatives will encourage creatives in the NFT space to join the DAO and create proposals to fund interesting creative projects. This will help attract new members to the DAO and help foster innovative ideas in the Rari Ecosystem.\n\n### 35% to the Treasury:\n\n35% of the Sequencer Fees would go towards the RARI DAO Treasury. This will help sustain the DAO by funding DAO initiatives as well as ensuring the DAO has the funding to continue with operation costs for the foreseeable future.\n\n## Foundation’s Share - 50%\n\n### 30% for maintenance and operations costs:\n\nThis portion of sequencer revenue would be used by the RARI foundation to operate, maintain, and improve the RARI Chain. This helps to ensure the Chain remains operational and can continue to return sequencer fees for the RARI Ecosystem.\n\n### 20% for paying off the Arbitrum Grant:\n\nRARI received a grant from the Arbitrum Foundation to build the RARI Chain using Artribrum Orbit. This grant needs to be paid back by the RARI Foundation. Using 20% of sequencer fees to repay this grant will allow us to fulfill the agreement with Arbitrum without requiring the use of treasury funds.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\n* Create a new Creator Fund Treasury Address and give the DAO the power to control these funds.\n* The foundation will inform the third party that operates the sequencer to send the rewards to the appropriate addresses.\n\n# Timeline\n\nOnce the proposal is passed, the revenue split can be enacted for the next monthly sequencer payment.\n\n# Overall Cost\n\nThere is no cost associated with this proposal",

      "content": "Authors: [@Jaf](https://forum.rari.foundation/u/jaf)\nReviewers: [@JanaBe](https://forum.rari.foundation/u/janabe) , [@addie](https://forum.rari.foundation/u/addie) , [@WinVerse](https://forum.rari.foundation/u/winverse) , [@Matt\\_StableLab](https://forum.rari.foundation/u/matt_stablelab) , [@jarisjames](https://forum.rari.foundation/u/jarisjames)\n\n## Abstract:\n\nThis draft proposal aims to distribute the remaining budget of the Incentives Rewards Program in a proportional manner among those who delegated during the program. This will encourage program participants to feel incentivized to participate in future programs.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nAfter concluding the program and observing promising results in the primary objective of boosting veRARI delegation and encouraging delegates to actively seek delegation, it is in the Rari DAO’s best interest to ensure participants remain motivated for future programs. Distributing the unallocated surplus of rewards proportionally aims to sustain this level of community engagement.\n\n## Rationale:\n\nUpon finalizing the program and receiving participants feedback, it became apparent that some members of the community had interpreted the rewards differently than intended. To address this, we propose distributing the remainder of the reward budget proportionally to those who delegated during the program.\n\nAfter the program is concluded, the following results are obtained.\n\n* 81,974.08 locked $RARI during the program\n* 45,008.91 veRARI delegated during the program\n* 5,661.05 $RARI Rewards distributed throughout the program\n\nInitially, as outlined in [RRC-13](https://forum.rari.foundation/t/rrc-13-delegation-incentives-program/1774), 30,000 $RARI were designated as rewards for delegators, leaving a balance of 24,338.95 $RARI for distribution.\n\nAllocating the remaining 24,338.95 $RARI in this proportional manner is beneficial to make delegators genuinely feel incentivized and aligned with their initial expectations when they delegated.\n\n## Key Terms\n\nDelegate - Someone who votes/participates in governance on behalf of themselves or their delegators.\n\nDelegator - Someone who owns $RARI but does not actively participate in governance. Instead, they entrust their tokens to a delegate. This way, their tokens are still actively being used in governance.\n\n$RARI - Rarible’s ecosystem native token, tradable on major exchanges. When locked, it is turned into veRARI tokens, which can be used in RARI Foundation’s governance.\n\nveRARI: veRARI, or vote-escrowed $RARI, is a token you receive in exchange for locking $RARI (which is done automatically when you claim your reward). This token lets you participate in the governance of the Rarible Protocol and RARI Foundation by voting on proposals submitted to the DAO and grants you RARI Prime status.\n\n## Specifications:\n\nRewards will be made available for all delegations carried out during the program (Nov 21st - Dec 15 2023) to claim following the pre-established program parameters: rewards automatically locked when claimed and following a 6 months lock + 3 months linear unlock.\n\n## Steps to Implement:\n\nThe solution is ready to implement upon proposal passing.",

      "title": "RRC-18 Raise Proposal Quorum",
      "content": "Authors: [@Matt\\_StableLab](https://forum.rari.foundation/u/matt_stablelab)\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to Increase the quorum from 10% of the total supply of veRARI to 15% of the total supply of veRARI.\n\n## Motivation\n\nRecently the amount of veRARI has dramatically increased thanks to the [delegate launchpad](https://forum.rari.foundation/t/rrc-9-rari-dao-delegate-launchpad-program/1563) programs and the [delegation incentives program](https://forum.rari.foundation/t/rrc-13-delegation-incentives-program/1774). This has increased the number of votes cast on RARI proposals.\n\nWhile this is a good sign as it shows Rari governance is growing and becoming more active, it also can put the DAO in danger if the quorum is too low. A low quorum can allow malicious proposals to pass through governance using very few votes.\n\nAfter the recent delegation campaigns, [4 delegates](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/rari-foundation/delegates) can now single-handedly reach quorum with their votes. It is important to raise the quorum to require many voices in the DAO to be heard before a proposal is valid. This will help protect the DAO and the protocol.\n\n## Rationale\n\nAs the Rarible Protocol continues to be [transferred to the control of the DAO](https://forum.rari.foundation/t/rrc-14-continuation-of-rarible-protocol-transfer-to-community/1811) the DAO must have safety measures in place to protect the protocol.\n\nCurrently, the quorum of about 10,000 veRARI is not sufficient to protect the protocol. A higher quorum ensures more votes need to be cast before a proposal is legitimate. Requiring more voters to vote will help limit the possibility of a malicious vote passing.\n\n15% of the total supply of veRARI is a more appropriate quorum for the new state of the DAO. This increase will serve to protect the DAO as we gain more responsibility over the protocol. Additionally, raising the quorum will serve to accommodate the recent increase in participation we have seen and will continue to see as the DAO grows.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n**Quorum**: the minimum number of votes that must be cast on any proposal to make the results of that proposal valid.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nTo implement this proposal the DAO will change the quorum from 10% of the total supply of veRARI to 15% of the total supply of veRARI.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThis proposal would follow the normal governance timeline with the quorum being changed after a successful Tally vote.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nThere is no cost associated with this proposal",

      "title": "RRC-16: RARI Foundation 2024 Operational Budget",
      "content": "Authors: JanaBe\n\nReviewers: Campbell Law\n\n### [](#abstract-1)Abstract\n\nThis draft proposal outlines RARI Foundation’s funding needs for 2024, along with laying out high-level objectives of what the team will be focusing on. The budget estimated for 12 months of operations is 1,650,000 USD and it enables continuity of operations and team & vendor growth as it reflects on the RARI ecosystem growth.\n\n### [](#motivation-2)Motivation\n\nThe RARI Foundation works on behalf of the RARI DAO and helps it achieve its mission of building decentralized NFT infrastructure to power innovative NFT use cases. In doing so, the Foundation deploys resources that span contractor salaries, vendors, legal, and marketing costs, amongst others, that ensure a smooth continuation of operations and allow for the expansion of the Foundation’s efforts to help grow the RARI ecosystem. The assumption is that the Foundation will continue working with the most skilled and professional contractors in the market, and it is necessary for the Foundation’s success to be able to offer compensation in stable coins or fiat money instead of $RARI in order to be competitive.\n\n### [](#rationale-3)Rationale\n\nThe Foundation and the delegate community reviewed 2024 goals and the below budget reflects the resources needed to accomplish these goals.\n\nFull overview of the goals can be found in Community Calls recap (Dec 19,2023). A condensed version or goals per focus area is below:\n\n1\\. Governance\n\n* Re-run Delegate launchpad program twice\n* Increase average unique voter per proposal from 10 to 20\n* Implement Security Council expansion\n\n2\\. Product\n\n* Distribute allocated Protocol Grants in full\n* Establish RARI Chain grants budget\n* Launch RARI Chain mainnet\n* All Protocol contracts owned by the community\n* Design solutions for potential multichain Protocol fee collection by the DAO\n\n3\\. Finance\n\n* Establish a Treasury diversification strategy (via a community vote) and commence execution\n* Establish Treasury revenue inflow:\n  (a) Assist the DAO with technical resources in case of potential Protocol monetization\n  (b) Establish RARI Chain revenue model\n\n4\\. Marketing\n\n* Increase awareness of the RARI ecosystem:\n* Active presence at 4-5 industry events\n* Grow community and audience by 100%\n* Boost presence and assistance with the developer community\n* Establish a presence at key hackathons\n\n5\\. Team\n\n* Increase current PT Community & Ops lead to FT\n* Boost Social Media & Content manager with a FT lead\n* Cover for 3-4 month maternity leave for Head of Strategy\n* Hire a FT Dev Rel and a Ecosystem Growth Manager\n* Outsource design, engineering, accounting\n\n### [](#key-terms-4)Key Terms\n\nRarible Protocol - multichain indexer and order book with SDK\n\nRARI Chain - royalties enforcing L3 built with Arbitrum Orbit\n\nRARI Ecosystem - applications utilizing the Rarible Protocol and/or the RARI Chain\n\n$RARI - ERC 20 token, used in the RARI DAO governance\n\n### [](#specification-5)Specification\n\nThe proposed 2024 budget of 1,650,000 USD reflects the above goals, team, and resource needs.\n\nWith the RARI ecosystem becoming more robust, there are increased budget needs. Compared to the last budgeting cycle (H2 2023), this one-year budget represents an increase of roughly a third. This increase is due mainly to the growing infrastructure in the RARI ecosystem (launch of RARI chain, increased remit of Rarible Protocol) and its demands on resources.\n\nBudget area > USD amount\n\nSalaries > 800k\n\nLegal costs > 192k\n\nVendors > 357k\n\nMarketing > 84k\n\nRARI chain > 187k\n\nOthers > 30k\n\nTotal > 1,650k\n\nSpecifics:\n\n* Salaries cover 5 FT and 1 PT contributors, and design freelance\n* Legal fees include Cayman Island counsel, US counsel and a paralegal\n* Vendor fees include administration costs (Director of the Foundation and the Supervisor of the Foundation, both roles are required for the set up of the Foundation under the Cayman law), professional delegate fees, Security Council compensations, accounting services, engineering vendors\n* Marketing costs cover sponsorships, production and marketing agency fees (to be incurred ad hoc as needs arise)\n* RARI chain costs include infrastructure vendor fees, and a budget for artist incentivization for the chain mainnet launch\n* Other costs include travel costs to crypto conferences, and miscellaneous expenses such as office supplies, subscriptions, and event tickets.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. The Director of the Foundation is responsible for the budget. They may opt to delegate day-to-day budget management tasks to the Foundation team.\n2. Budget spending shall be monitored by the Foundation’s appointed accountant.\n3. Periodic budget spending reports shall be shared with the community quarterly, no later than 30 days after the end of the quarter. The community may request budget updates at any point. In such event, the Foundation shall present the budget status no later than in 15 working days.\n4. If there are unspent funds at the end of the budget cycle, the Foundation may propose to keep the amount in an operational reserve. Otherwise, it shall be returned to DAO’s treasury within 90 days of the budget cycle’s end.\n5. The Foundation team shall respect the budget allocations as specified in the subtotals. It is understood that variations may occur. However, transfers between the budget groups should not exceed 30%. Budget reallocations larger than 30% will require DAO approval.\n6. Should $RARI price deviate from the USDC conversation rate at the date of the proposal submission, the Foundation shall either submit an additional proposal to request funds to cover the exchange loss or report the excess funds at the end of the budgeting cycle.\n7. Contributors (Team) are to be paid once a month in USDC unless otherwise agreed in their contracts.\n8. Legal and Administrative costs are to be paid upon receiving invoices from the Foundation service providers as per engagement letters or agreements with such entities.\n\n### [](#steps-to-implement-6)Steps to Implement\n\nUpon the budget approval, the full corresponding $RARI amount will be transferred to the Foundation’s operational wallet (0x2a83d2891Ef3df6967E3C2e9b69cCc7aD029736B), the Foundation will convert it to USDC to reduce the exchange rate fluctuation risk and the exchanged amount will be stored on the operational wallet (0x2a83d2891Ef3df6967E3C2e9b69cCc7aD029736B).\n\nThe Foundation may opt to halt conversion to USDC, should the exchange rate start falling below the desired conversion rate, and resume when the desired rate is met or if a conversion must be made in order to meet Foundation’s payment obligations. Payments within the approved budget in accordance with signed contracts are to be made by the Foundation administration, who will be responsible for the budget.",

      "content": "Authors: JanaBe, Eugene Nacu\n\nReviewers: Alexander Salnikov, Alexei Falin\n\n\n\n### **Abstract**\n\nThis draft proposal establishes a path for the RARI DAO to govern more parts of the RARI ecosystem, namely the Exchange contracts bundle of the Rarible Protocol. As such, it outlines the role of governance and maps the veto and upgrade functions of the Security Council as they relate to this contract. Additionally, this RRC 14 proposes enlargement of the Security Council from 3 to 5 members and granting them emergency upgrade powers. \n\n\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nTransferring the ownership and control of the Rarible Protocol contracts to the community is a continuation of the decentralization of the Rarible Protocol and the RARI Foundation's mission of building decentralized NFT infrastructure.\n\n\n\n### **Rationale**\n\nThe Exchange contracts bundle is an essential component of the Rarible Protocol, which allows its owners to set fees on transactions powered by the protocol. Currently, these fees are set to 0%. Once this contract is DAO-governed, the community may decide how to set fees, if any, in the future. With this increased scope of governance, we propose strengthening the Security Council by expanding the number of seats and expanding their remit from veto to also emergency upgrades. \n\n\n\n### **Key Terms**\n\nRarible Protocol - multichain indexer and order book with SDK\n\nRARI Ecosystem - applications utilizing the Rarible Protocol\n\n$RARI - ERC 20 token, used in the RARI DAO governance\n\n\n\n### **Specification**\n\n\n\nThe Exchange contracts bundle ownership transfer consists of 3 key components:\n\n1. Governance design for the Exchange contracts\n2. DAO commitment to not exceed protocol fees beyond a certain threshold\n3. Expansion of the Security Council to 5 seats and granting of emergency upgrade powers\n\n,\n\n<u>1. Governance design for the Exchange contract</u>\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/69798cbe-de7e-4a00-9820-dca9ea12aa32_original.png)\n\n[<u>This diagram</u>](https://forum.rari.foundation/t/rrc-14-continuation-of-rarible-protocol-transfer-to-community/1811/9) shows every contract/wallet which is used in DAO-related contracts. Also, the diagram shows every role and dependencies between contracts/wallets.\n\n\n\nUpgradeExecutor will be the owner or admin in the shown contracts. This will allow to control these contracts using 2 addresses:\n\n* Security Council multisig (4/5)\n* Timelock contract (which executes proposals)\n\nUpgradeExecutor will be able to execute arbitrary actions on all contracts. This will be implemented using Action Contracts which will be deployed prior to doing action. DAO will be able to review Action Contracts before execution\n\nUpgradeExecutor has an Executor role. Executors can execute arbitrary actions. Only 2 addresses will have an Executor role: Security Council multisig (4/5 threshold) and Timelock contract. Thus, there are only 2 ways to perform ownership-related actions on DAO-related contracts: by making and executing a proposal or by a 4/5 vote of the Security Council.\n\n\n\n<u>2. DAO commitment to not exceed protocol fees beyond a certain threshold</u>\n\nBy approving this RRC, the DAO commits to keeping any future protocol feel at a reasonable level in order not to impede the protocol's adoption and to continue providing a stable environment for applications built with it. This reasonable transaction fee shall not exceed 0.5%.\n\n\n\n<u>3. Expansion of the Security Council to 5 seats granting of emergency upgrade powers</u>\n\nRRC 11 established a 3-seat Security Council that, in Phase 1 was permitted to exercise veto power over proposals that would be malicious or exploitative to the DAO. The proposal included a plan to expand the Security Council's powers to include emergency upgrades in Phase 2. \n\nPhase 2 commences with the Exchange contracts bundle ownership transfer, as this poses the need for a failsafe mechanism for scenarios such as emergency actions in critical security scenarios (e.g. hack or serious bug) or minor routine maintenance on the contracts. With this increased remit of powers, the Security Council shall be expanded to 5 seats.\n\n\n\nSpecifics:\n\n* Veto function will be performed with a 3/5 majority vote\n  * Multisig address: 0xd35ec9F67Aa082Ae666be1716C79291f1f6e4E0a\n* Upgrade function will be performed with 4/5 majority vote:\n  * Multisig address:0xa5e4514145463385aEF763Fc8161CB42b92c74f2\n* The first three members will continue serving on the Security Council until their term is up\n* The additional two proposed members are:\n  1. Jafett Sandi, current delegate of the RARI DAO and core member of the Push protocol\n     * Hardware wallet address: 0x636e1f9A9Cb926a69441DcE54Aa9e490CFe6D4D6\n  2. Eugene Nacu, current CTO of Rarible\n     * Hardware wallet address:0x978EBcd18c5A0d829C061566AA84227e9618C1A4\n\n\n\n\n### **Steps to Implement**\n\nThe solution is ready to implement upon proposal passing.\n\nBudget: 10,000 USD for security audit.",

This approach aims to explore the diverse applications of Rarible’s open source NFT protocol in an engaging, multimedia format, highlighting real-world NFT use cases.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nWhile NFTs are often seen primarily as digital collectibles or profile pictures, their potential reaches far into various sectors. Our podcast will introduce a range of innovative applications, such as tokenizing real estate deeds on the blockchain as one of many examples. We aim to engage with projects across different industries, suggesting creative ways to use Rarible’s open source NFT protocol. Topics could include digital identity verification, enhancing supply chain transparency, or creating unique digital experiences in art and entertainment. These discussions are designed to broaden the understanding of NFTs, showcasing their versatility and potential impact in numerous fields.\n\nWe aim to elevate community engagement and promote Rarible’s open source NFT protocol through innovative content delivery. The “Beyond PFPs” podcast will also serve as a business development tool to inspire guests to create real-world NFT use cases, advancing the space through the Rarible protocol.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThis collaboration aligns with the Rari Foundation’s values, introducing a novel approach to content creation in the Web3 space. It offers an opportunity to showcase real-world applications of NFTs, encouraging guests to develop NFT projects using the Rarible Protocol. This strategy aims to enhance community knowledge while fostering practical innovation in the NFT space.\n\n**Key Terms**\n\nOSPN - Open Source Peoples Network, formerly known as DAOlationships: A Decentralized Creator Economy focused on producing content as a public good.\n\n“Beyond PFPs” Podcast: A multimedia exploration of NFT use cases beyond profile pictures, hosted on various platforms, such as YouTube, Twitter Spaces, Spotify, [Pods 2](https://pods.media/) (web3 alternative to Spotify).\n\n**Specifications**\n\nThe podcast will utilize web3 and traditional media platforms, offering a rich, interactive experience.

      "title": "RRC-13: Delegation Incentives Program",
      "content": "Authors: [@Matt\\_StableLab](https://forum.rari.foundation/u/matt_stablelab) [@WinVerse](https://forum.rari.foundation/u/winverse) [@Jaf](https://forum.rari.foundation/u/jaf) [@jarisjames](https://forum.rari.foundation/u/jarisjames) [@JanaBe](https://forum.rari.foundation/u/janabe)\n\n## Abstract:\n\nThis proposal aims to launch an incentives program to encourage increased delegation of veRARI. This proposal would both incentivize delegators to delegate their $RARI and encourage delegates to actively seek out delegation. The ultimate goal of this program is to increase the amount of $RARI delegated and the average veRARI votes cast per on-chain proposal.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nThe Rari DAO should implement this proposal as it would directly increase veRARI delegation and total votes cast on proposals. This will in turn increase the legitimacy of the DAO, shareholder interest in the community, and DAO activity. It will also serve as an additional layer of protection for the community.\n\n## Rationale:\n\n$RARI token holders govern the RARI Protocol, control the RARI Foundation treasury, and make decisions for the RARI DAO through on-chain governance. However, currently, very few $RARI are being used for governance. This proposal aims to increase the amount of veRARI used for voting. This is vital for the DAO’s success for the following reasons:\n\n1. Low voter turnout is dangerous for the DAO. It makes it easy for bad actors to force malicious proposals through governance by purchasing small amounts of $RARI. This delegation incentives program would increase the amount of votes cast, which in turn would make it far more expensive for someone to buy a vote.\n2. Increased delegation makes the DAO more active. This creates more excitement in the DAO as it allows for more ideas to be shared and more proposals to be passed. This will add excitement to the DAO and help to attract more contributors.\n3. Adds utility to $RARI. $RARI is meant to be used to govern the protocol. If more holders are using their $RARI for governance, it legitimizes this use case and therefore incentivizes more people to lock $RARI to take advantage of this utility.\n4. A large-scale delegation incentives program is rare in crypto. This initiative will draw industry attention and help grow awareness for the RARI DAO.\n5. Encouraging large token holders to delegate their $RARI tokens will hopefully engage these holders in the ecosystem, which is beneficial for the DAO.\n6. This initiative incentivizes delegates to become more active and proactively seek delegation. Active delegates are crucial to the success of a DAO as they are the ones working on the day-to-day governance of the protocol.\n\n## Key Terms\n\nDelegate - Someone who votes/participates in governance on behalf of themselves or their delegators.\n\nDelegator - Someone who owns $RARI but does not actively participate in governance. Instead, they entrust their tokens to a delegate. This way, their tokens are still actively being used in governance.\n\n$RARI - Rarible’s ecosystem native token, tradable on major exchanges. When locked, it is turned into veRARI tokens, which can be used in RARI Foundation’s governance.\n\nveRARI: veRARI, or vote-escrowed $RARI, is a token you receive in exchange for locking $RARI (which is done automatically when you claim your reward). This token lets you participate in the governance of the Rarible Protocol and RARI Foundation by voting on proposals submitted to the DAO and grants you RARI Prime status.\n\n## Specifications:\n\n### Incentive Specifications\n\n#### Delegate Incentives\n\nDelegator Incentives = 0.3(# veRARI delegated during program)\\*(delegate score)\n\nImportant Stipulations\n\n* Total delegator rewards for round 1 are capped at 30,000 $RARI\n* If the 30,000 RARI limit is exceeded, rewards will be distributed proportionally across delegators according to the size of their qualifying delegations\n* The delegate score will be calculated on a scale of 0 to 1 based on a delegate’s activity\n* A max of 10,000 $RARI can be awarded to a single delegator\n* Delegators only receive rewards on the first 7,500 veRARI delegated to a single delegate. (Delegators can make delegations to multiple delegates to achieve full rewards see [example 5](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pZP5fvsRrhi6uWElzLYvhCVwFvBIhCYh9s2UXESELgI/edit?usp=sharing))\n* Only whitelisted addresses will be eligible for this program based on a snapshot of token holders before the start of this program to avoid a single delegator splitting their RARI into multiple wallets to receive more rewards.\n* Rewards will be claimable at the conclusion of the incentive program\n\n#### Delegate Incentives\n\nDelegate Incentives = 0.058(# veRARI received during program)\\*(delegate score)\n\nImportant Stipulations\n\n* Total delegate rewards for round 1 is capped at 5,800 RARI\n* If the 5,800 RARI limit is exceeded, rewards will be distributed proportionally across delegates according to the size of the delegations they attract\n* The delegate score will be calculated on a scale of 0 to 1 based on a delegate’s activity.\n\n#### Examples\n\nExample incentives reward calculations can be seen [here 5](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pZP5fvsRrhi6uWElzLYvhCVwFvBIhCYh9s2UXESELgI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n#### Program Logistics\n\n* The tentative dates of the program are Nov 21 - Dec 15, 2023.\n* Rewards will be available to claim starting Dec 19, and will be automatically locked when claimed with the following parameters: 6 months lock + 3 months linear unlock.\n* Claim URL: rari.foundation/claim\n* The RARI Foundation will allocate a budget of 2,000 USD to reimburse gas associated with claiming rewards within the first 30 days.\n\n## Steps to Implement:\n\nDelegates will have to confirm their forum account and tally profile to have their delegate score correctly calculated, prior to the start of the program. A snapshot of $RARI holders will be taken to qualify for delegator rewards. A delegate score will be calculated for each delegate using a pre-specified formula to calculate delegate activity. A new front-end feature will be created to display these delegate scores. Rewards will be calculated automatically and distributed to the appropriate delegators and delegates by a smart contract.\n\nTarget wallet address for Tally submission: 0xcd9f82fe3b60a5c8482a69279ab5c8d0be19ca24\n\n## Timeline:\n\nThe proposed timeline for this proposal is to run from November 21st until December 15th, 2023.\n\n## Overall Cost:\n\n### Overall costs: 40,000 RARI\n\nDelegator rewards: 30,000 RARI\n\nDelegate Rewards: 5,800 RARI\n\nOperational Costs: 4,200 RARI\n\n* 1000 RARI per working group member for their work in organizing and designing this program (RARI Foundation team waives this fee)\n* 200 RARI transaction fee",

      "title": "RRC-12: RARI Ecosystem Growth Fund",
      "content": "# Abstract\nThis proposal aims to establish the RARI Ecosystem Growth Fund. This Fund will drive innovative Rarible protocol’s adoption and strategic partnership to accelerate RARI ecosystem growth. This document proposes the Ecosystem Growth Fund to be administered and managed by the RARI Foundation with periodic detailed reporting to the community.\n# Motivation\nRelying on the organic growth of the RARI ecosystem does not capture its full potential. The RARI DAO needs to attract innovative projects to build with the Rarible Protocol to shape the future of new NFT use cases powered by our tech stack and strengthen our position in the NFT space. Similarly, entering strategic partnerships that will drive exposure to the RARI ecosystem is crucial to raising awareness of the RARI DAO, its mission, and the value it brings to the ecosystem.\n# Rationale\nThe RARI DAO and the RARI Foundation work together to grow decentralized NFT infrastructure, power mass adoption of NFTs, and enable innovative NFT use cases. However, for the RARI Foundation to be most effective at accomplishing these goals, it requires funding with $RARI in order to support a grants program, strategic loans, and strategic partnerships. By tasking the RARI Foundation to administer and manage the Ecosystem Growth Fund, the RARI DAO will continue being the governing body and the decision-maker but will delegate the responsibility and day-to-day management to the RARI Foundation team.\n# Key Terms\nRarible Protocol - multichain indexer and order book with SDK\n\nRARI Ecosystem - applications utilizing the Rarible Protocol\n\n$RARI - ERC 20 token, used in the RARI DAO governance\n# Specification\nThe Ecosystem Growth Fund shall be composed of 3 parts:\n\n1. Grants allocation\n2. Strategic loans\n3. Strategic partnerships\n## Grants Allocation\nWe propose a total of 250k RARI to fund early-stage projects that align with the mission of the RARI DAO: growing NFT ecosystem & innovative NFT use cases powered by the Rarible Protocol. The grants shall be allocated to existing projects that build with the protocol or that contribute to the protocol, not for marketing or promotional purposes. The individual grants should take the form of locked RARI that is revocable for a period of 6 months in the following tranches: 50% upon grant approval and 50% upon project delivery. This mechanic aims to ensure the grant recipients deliver their projects in full.\n## Strategic Loans\nWe propose a total of 800k RARI for strategic loans to partners who are committed to pursuing our ecosystem health and growth. The loans are to be returned in full at the end of each loan period to the Foundation (either in RARI or a stablecoin), and the loan period should not exceed 18 months. Activities of the loan recipients may include (but are not limited to) R&D, community-building initiatives, and marketing. Any loan recipient must pass the KYC process and sign a formal agreement with the RARI Foundation.\n## Strategic Partnerships\nWe propose a total of 350k RARI to encourage strategic partnerships that will contribute to our reach to new audiences and communities. These partnerships may include subsidizing strategic protocol integrations, marketing integrations (outside of smaller-scale marketing covered by the operational budget), and collaborating with partners to help foster ecosystem growth with pre-agreed, customized benchmarks of value provided to the RARI community.\n\nIn total, the Ecosystem Growth Fund would amount to 1.4M RARI, and the proportions of this fund are to be respected as stated above.\n### Notes:\n1. The RARI Foundation will be responsible for publishing quarterly reports on the Ecosystem Growth Fund’s allocations and for involving the community in grant recipient selection by setting up a grants committee 3/4 multisig, where 2 members are appointed by the RARI Foundation and 2 by the community. This Fund will be under the RARI Foundation’s purview for a period of a minimum of 12 months, after which the community may request the return of unspent funds.\n2. For projects to qualify for a grant, they must demonstrate:     \n\n- Mission alignment (growing the NFT space introducing innovative use cases)\n- Proven track record of commitment to building (e.g sustained reputable public presence, successfully shipped         past projects or features)\n- Qualified team capable of delivering\n- Willingness to KYC\n\n3. The grant committee may choose to allocate a portion of the grant to community-proposed initiatives such as the ‘Artist Rennaisance’ or ‘Rapid loans/Listing reimbursement,’ if these become closer defined via community discussion and the community does not propose them as stand-alone initiatives\n# Steps to Implement\nThe RARI Foundation shall set up a new multisig wallet (same signees as the current administrative wallet) dedicated solely to the use of the Ecosystem Growth fund. This wallet is to receive the full amount of 1.4M $RARI.",

This RRC-11 also proposes to implement a committee consisting of a DAO-appointed 3-member multi-sig (“Security Council”), which will have the ability to perform emergency and non-emergency actions such as urgent upgrades, minor, routine maintenance to the Rarible Protocol, and stoping DAO hack attempts. \n\n## Motivation\n\nAs part of the path to a more decentralized Rarible Protocol, the power to govern the Rarible Protocol contracts should be within the hands of the RARI DAO, which currently has direct on-chain governance authority over the RARI DAO treasury and is on the path to governing the Rarible Protocol. As such, there is a need for a mechanism to prevent governance attacks in which an attacker acquires voting power through legitimate means (e.g. buying tokens on the open market) but uses that to manipulate votes to their own benefit - e.i. exploiting the DAO’s treasury or the Protocol via skewing governance or introducing Protocol vulnerabilities. The DAO needs a body with emergency veto and upgrade powers that will be able to step in to protect the DAO and its interests. \n\n## Rationale\n\nBy growing the robustness of the RARI DAO governance and mitigating governance attack risks, the DAO will be able to fully adopt the Rarible Protocol and engage in activities to grow the Protocol’s ecosystem by onboarding new communities and expanding NFT use cases.\n\n## Key Terms \n\nN/A\n\n## Specifications\n\n**Current RARI DAO Governance:**\n\nThe RRC Process as laid out in “Specifications” section of RRC-0 shall apply to Rarible Protocol core contract updates and changes.\n\n*Phase 1: RRC Idea*\n\n-- An RRC Idea must be submitted as a post in the Forum, where it should gather feedback for a period of 7 days\n\n*Phase 2: RRC Draft*\n\n-- After Phase 1, the RRC Idea author must generate an RRC Draft with the required fields as laid out in RRC-0.\n\n*Phase 3: Live RRC*\n\n-- Once an RRC Draft is ready, the RRC author (provided that they have at least 5,000 veRARI) must post it as a Live Draft on Tally, where it will undergo a 5 day voting period.\n\n-- The Live RRC must reach the quorum requirement dictated in RRC-0, and voting options are “in favor” and “against”. A Live RRC which meets the quorum requirement and receives more votes cast “in favor” than cast “against”, it shall be deemed an Accepted RRC.\n\n*Phase 4: Cooldown Period*\n\n-- An Accepted RRC undergoes a 2-day Cooldown Period, **during which the Security Council and the Board of the RARI Foundation may each reject such Accepted RRC*** if it would:\n\n1. Directly conflict with a proposal that is currently up for vote;\n2. Directly conflict with another proposal approved by the RARI DAO;\n3.Not include the required proposal terms as detailed in Phase 2 of the RRC Process;\n4. Compromise the Board’s fiduciary duties as they are owed to the RARI Foundation;\n5. Be in violation of the RARI Foundation’s bylaws or articles, any statutory requirements of Cayman Islands laws or the laws or regulations of any other applicable jurisdiction;\n6. Cause harm (including reputational harm) to the RARI Foundation (as determined in the Board’s sole discretion); and/or\n7. Cause the RARI Foundation to be in breach of any contracts, agreements or any other arrangements.\n\n-- * This RRC-11 is proposing this update to Phase 4 of the RRC Process – that is, the Security Council as well as the director of the RARI Foundation, has the ability to reject an Accepted RRC during a Cooldown Period.\n\n*Phase 5: Implementation*\n\n**Proposed Security Council:**\n\n1. This RRC-11 establishes a 3-member Security Council.\n\n-- In Phase 1 (immediately), the Security Council will be able to reject an Accepted RRC during the Cooldown Period should the proposal be malicious or exploitative to the DAO. \n\n-- In Phase 2 (after a period of 3 months), the Security Council will also be able to perform emergency actions in critical security scenarios (e.g., a hack, serious bugs, etc.) as well as perform minor routine maintenance of the Protocol contacts.\n\n-- After each action, the Security Council will publish a detailed report with the rationale for their actions and outline of the implementation details within a reasonable timeframe.\n\n2. The initial members of the Security Council are nominated by the RARI Foundation and will serve a term of 12 months.\n\n-- Campbell Law, current Director of the Foundation; wallet address: 0xd9C3EeD65968443F8587Bb068e6530A48dB5d177\n\n-- Andrei Taraschuck, current delegate; wallet address: 0x25Ad94C7768108666BfDB6742aB66b109CA82946\n\n-- StableLab, professional delegates, represented by Mattew Stein; wallet address: Stablelab.eth\n\n3. The Safe multisig wallet the Security Council will use to perform its function is: 0xd35ec9F67Aa082Ae666be1716C79291f1f6e4E0a\n\n4. Appointment and Removal\n\n-- The members of the Security Council will serve a term of 12 months. The future members of the council may be appointed via the RRC process or via an on-chain election process if the community decides to establish on-chain elections with a stand-alone proposal.\n\n-- The members of the Security Council must act upon the direction of the director of the RARI Foundation as well as the RARI token-holders pursuant to the RRC. Failure to act in accordance with directions from either the director of the RARI Foundation or the RRC Process constitutes a reason for an ad hoc removal of Security Council members. Such removal shall follow the RRC Process, and one member of the Security Council must remain in place. \n\n-- The number of members on the Security Council may also be expanded or reduced pursuant to the RRC Process, provided that (i) there must be at least 1 member on the Security Council and (ii) at least 1 member of the Security Council must be a director of the RARI Foundation.\n\n5. Compensation\nSecurity Council members are entitled to compensation of 2,000 USDC per month. \n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nPhase 1: \nImplement Security Council’s veto power in the Timelock contract: 0x6552C8fb228f7776Fc0e4056AA217c139D4baDa1\n\nPhase 2:\nEncode Security Council’s upgrade powers to all governance contracts:\nGovernor: 0x6552C8fb228f7776Fc0e4056AA217c139D4baDa1\nToken: 0x096Bd9a7a2e703670088C05035e23c7a9F428496\nTimelock: 0x7e9c956e3EFA81Ace71905Ff0dAEf1A71f42CBC5\n\nEncode Security Council’s upgrade powers to Protocol contracts along with implementing DAO governance over the Protocol.\n\n## Timeline\nPhase 1: immediately\nPhase 2: after 3 months of the first Security Council in place\n\n## Overall Cost\n72,000 for the first year. Cost for the first 6 months was approved as part of the Rari Foundation’s H2 ‘23 operational budget.\n",

      "title": "RRC-10: H2 2023 RARI Foundation Operational Budget",
      "content": "**Abstract**\n\nThis document proposes to allocate funds for the Rari Foundation operational budget for H2 2023 (6 months) in the amount of 611,800 USDC. This budget will ensure the continuity of the Rari Foundation team and operations and reflects the focus areas as identified by the community.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe Rari Foundation represents the Rari DAO in the world. As such, it sustains operational costs that allow the Foundation to function and to facilitate the DAO in reaching the goal of Building a decentralized NFT infrastructure that will power future NFT use cases. The operational budget will allow the Foundation to source legal services, compensate key contributors, and promote Rari DAO’s mission in order to drive the adoption of the Rarible Protocol. The assumption is that Rari DAO will be working with the most skilled and professional contractors on the market, and it is necessary for the Foundation’s success to be able to offer compensation in stable coins or fiat money instead of $RARI in order to be competitive.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe Rari DAO identified key goals to be focusing on in the short, mid, and long term. A dedicated team is required to deliver on these goals and to ensure the continuity of operations. The budget will enable the core team to facilitate the DAO in growing and maturing to the point of being able to take over the Rarible Protocol’s governance while laying the groundwork for growing Rarible Protocol’s ecosystem growth.\n\n**Key Terms** \nN/A\n\n\n**Specifications**\n\nThe H2 operational budget reflects growing DAO needs: Improved governance (paid security council positions, a professional delegate) Increased marketing demands (website redesign resources, more DAO/RF initiatives = more needs for promotional support, RF presence at industry events) Improved compensation (pool for contributors rewards, $RARI vesting for the Foundation team)\n\n*Budget overview: *\nsee image ![](https://example.com/your-image.png)\n\n\n*Specifics*:\n\n1. Foundation salaries\n- The Foundation team includes Head of Strategy (Jana Bertram), Community Lead (Fumbles), Project Management Lead (Fumbles), Marketing Lead (Xenia Vyazemskaya), Engineering Lead (Cristian Covalli), Business Development Lead (to be hired), and Accountant (to be hired).\n- The Foundation team headcount is 4 FT and 2 PT contributors.\n- Freelance copy and design resources are intended for website redesign, branding update, and creation of promotional materials.\n\n2. DAO compensation\n- Contributor rewards are intended to compensate DAO community contributors in delivering on asks identified by the Foundation and DAO. E.g. content writing, events organizing, research, and business development.\n- Professional delegate services are compensation to StableLab, who commit to active voting participation, setting a leading example of how a delegate in RARI DAO should act, collaboratively aid proposal creation, contribute to community calls.\n- Security council seats are compensated at 2,000 USD per month per seat. The council consists of 3 members.\n\n3. Vendor fees\n- Legal fees are incurred for legal counsel in the Cayman Islands and in the United States. The legal councils prepare contracts, review core proposals and advise the Director of the Foundation, the Foundation team and the DAO on any potential legal risks or implications.\n- Administration fees cover the Director of the Foundation and the Supervisor of the Foundation, both roles that are required for the set up of the Foundation under the Cayman law. The Director is ultimately responsible for the management and operation of the Foundation, in particular, approving and entering into contractual agreements on behalf of the Rari Foundation.\n\n4. Marketing\n- The Foundation is mapping H2 2023 marketing activities and foresees costs related to sponsorship, promotions, and gas reimbursements. Tentative plans foresee ETH Global NY and Devconnect in Istanbul.\n- Production costs related to print material, video, and or merchandise produced for presence at events and conferences.\n- The travel budget covers travel fare, accommodation and local expenses for conferences or events outside of city of residence.\n\n5. Contingency\n- Legal contingency is intended for an instance where the legal council would need to significantly increase their hours e.g. in case of an unexpected urgent legal matter.\n- Miscellaneous covers small expenses such as office supplies, subscriptions and event tickets.\n\n\n*Notes*:\n\n1. The Director of the Foundation is responsible for the budget. They may opt to delegate day-to-day budget management tasks to the Foundation team.\n2. Budget spending shall be monitored by the Foundation’s appointed accountant.\n3. Periodic budget spending reports shall be shared with the community quarterly, no later than 30 days after the end of the quarter. The community may request budget updates at any point. In such event, the Foundation shall present the budget status no later than in 15 working days.\n4. If there are unspent funds at the end of the budget cycle, the Foundation may propose to keep the amount in an operational reserve. Otherwise, it shall be returned to DAO’s treasury within 90 days of the budget cycle’s end.\n5. The Foundation team shall respect the budget allocations as specified in the subtotals. It is understood that variations may occur. However, transfers between the budget groups should not exceed 30%. Budget reallocations larger than 30% will require DAO approval.\n6. Should $RARI price deviate from the USDC conversation rate at the date of the proposal submission (1 $RARI = 1.06 USDC), the Foundation shall either submit an additional proposal to request funds to cover the exchange loss or refund the excess funds to the Treasury.\n7. Any spending exceeding the budgeted amount shall be approved by token holders separately.\n8. Contributors (Team) are to be paid once a month in USDC unless otherwise agreed in their contracts.\n9. Legal and Administrative costs are to be paid upon receiving invoices from the Foundation service providers as per engagement letters or agreements with such entities.\n\n\n*Payments disbursement:*\n\n1. Contributors (Team) are to be paid once a month in USDC unless otherwise agreed in their contracts.\n2. Legal and Administrative costs are to be paid upon receiving invoices from the Foundation service providers as per engagement letters or agreements with such entities.\n\n\n**Steps to implement**\n\nUpon the budget approval, the full corresponding $RARI amount will be transferred to the Foundation’s operational wallet (0x2a83d2891Ef3df6967E3C2e9b69cCc7aD029736B), the Foundation will convert it to USDC to reduce the exchange rate fluctuation risk and the exchanged amount wil be stored on the operational wallet 0x2a83d2891Ef3df6967E3C2e9b69cCc7aD029736B. The Foundation may opt to halt conversion to USDC, should the exchange rate start falling below the desired conversion rate, and resume when the desired rate is met or if a conversion must be made in order to meet Foundation’s payment obligations. Payments within the approved budget in accordance with signed contracts are to be made by the Foundation leadership, who will be responsible for the budget.",

      "title": "RRC-9: Delegate Launchpad Proposal",
      "content": "**Abstract**\n\nThis document proposes a Rari DAO delegate launchpad program, which is designed to attract new delegates and boost DAO participation with the ultimate goal of advancing the mission of building a decentralized NFT infrastructure that powers future NFT use cases. \n\nThe delegate launchpad program consists of the Rari Foundation delegating a fixed amount of veRARI for a fixed amount of time as long as applicable delegates met the required criteria and maintained an active DAO status for the duration of the delegation.\n\nThe suggested mechanism is based on ideas proposed by the community during strategic workshops held on May 18 and 25 and related feedback.\n\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe Rari DAO is the governing body of the Rari Foundation, which was established to help grow the NFT ecosystem with the Rarible protocol, uncovering new NFT use cases and broadening the horizon of the NFT technology application. As such, we believe the Rari DAO community can benefit from inviting new members with relevant skills and experiences who can engage in the discourse of decentralizing the NFT infrastructure and help us get there. By empowering these new members with temporary delegations, we fast-track their active DAO participation and cultivate a vibrant community.\n\nThis program will be a pilot from which we will learn and improve on future initiatives designed to grow DAO participation. We’re targeting to onboard 15 new delegates through this program during summer 2023.\n\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe current DAO participation is low - both in terms of voting and discourse and in terms of proposal submissions. We’re seeking ways to jumpstart the DAO activity to get more traction on proposals and community discourse. \nThe Rari Foundation has just rolled out delegation incentives (as part of Delegation Week), which produced moderate results. We need to look beyond delegation gas reduction. The delegate launchpad program will enable us to screen qualified applicants for the kind of skills, experience, and motivation the DAO can benefit from in the long run and, at the same time, elevate the new delegates within their communities.\n\n\n**Key Terms**\n\n*$RARI* - the official token ticker of the ERC-20 token that governs Rarible Protocol ecosystem\n*veRARI* - the locked $RARI that can be used for governance: voting and proposals submission\n*Lock Period* - the time during which locked $RARI remains unavailable for transacting or trading\n*Delegation* - The act of loaning veRARIi tokens, obtained by locking $RARI, to someone who will represent your interests in governance and voting on chain. \n*Delegate* - A party that has the ability to vote on Rari governance proposals. Could be a veRARI token holder or someone to whom other $RARI token holders have delegated their veRARI and voting power.\n*Rari DAO* - A decentralized autonomous organization committed to building the future of NFT infrastructure & NFT use cases. The DAO oversees the treasury and is on the path to govern the Rari protocol. \n*Rari Foundation* - The legal entity of the Rari DAO, and an organization that facilitates the DAO and ensures compliant disposal of the DAO Treasury.\n\n\n**Specifications**\n\n***1. Program recipients' eligibility criteria***\n\nWe’re seeking to attract applicants from the following professional areas and with the following areas of contribution:\n\na. DAO Governance experts\n- reasons to join\n    1. Thought leadership creds\n    2. Resume building\n- areas of contribution\n    1. DAO processes, tools, and participation incentives\n    2. Grants framework\n\nb. NFT & De-fi thought leaders\n- reasons to join\n    1. Developing capabilities in the NFT-Fi space and building industry recognition/prestige\n    2. Token rewards\n- areas of contribution\n    1. DAO participation incentives\n    2. Protocol adoption incentives\n\nc. NFT & De-fi thought leaders\n- reasons to join\n    1. Shaping the protocol\n    2. Access to grants and DAO decision-makers\n- areas of contribution\n    1. Onboarding new communities to the Protocol\n    2. Protocol expansion and adoption via ambassadorship and partnerships\n\nDuring the application period, applicants must submit their application outlining their qualifications, motivation, area of DAO contribution, Tally profile, socials, and wallet address or ENS. They must also acknowledge the conditions and terms of the delegation. The Rari Foundation team shall review all the applications and, together with the community, select the final 15 recipients and 5 top choices for a waitlist.\n\n\n***2. Conditions of delegation***\n\nThe Rari Foundation will delegate 2,000 veRARI to up to 15 delegates that meet the above criteria and have applied within the application period. \n\nThis program lasts for 6 months in total. During the first three months, the delegated amount will remain to be the total 2,000 veRARI, unless the recipient breaches the terms outlined below. During the second three months, the amount of delegated veRARI will linearly decrease to 0. If the program recipients wish to maintain their delegate status, they can use this period to gather support and delegations from the DAO community. The Rari Foundation will elevate these delegates via owned channels in order to support them in their efforts to gain community support and delegations.\n\n\n***3. Terms of delegation***\n\nThe program recipients need to demonstrate a track of DAO participation: vote on at least 60% of proposals (in any given 30-day period), provide a rationale in the DAO’s discussion forum on voting decisions, and be, within reason, responsive to the community. If these criteria are not met or if the delegate demonstrates behavior at odds with the DAOs code of conduct*, the foundation can revoke the delegation at any given moment.\n\n* The Rari DAO’s core values are Respect, Integrity, Accountability, Innovation.\n\nThere is no exploitative behavior allowed at any time. Exploitative behavior can mean attempting to exploit an individual community member, seeking to exploit the DAO itself, or seeking to exploit the treasury. There is also no form of harassment tolerated anywhere throughout the Rari DAO. Any expression of racism, sexism, xenophobia, or other derogatory prejudice & intolerance is not welcome here. \n\nIn case the delegation is revoked, the Rari Foundation shall delegate to a candidate in the first position on the waitlist.\n\n\n\n**Program budget**\n\nThe total program budget is 30,000 veRARI, which translates to 90,000 $RARI locked for a period of 6 months (6 months lock with 3 months slope to support the delegation mechanism as outlined above). We propose this budget is allocated from the Rari Foundation’s Treasury and remains in Rari Foundation’s management until revoked in order for the Foundation to have the ability to deploy the program again, upon alignment with the community.\n\n\n\n**Timeline**\n\nAs soon as the proposal is approved and executed, the Rari Foundation can promote the program and launch the enrollment period. Tentative schedule:\n\nw/o June 19 proposal voting & execution\nw/o June 19 + 26 promotion and program amplification\nw/o June 26 - w/o July 10 enrollment period\nw/o July 17 candidate selection\nw/o July 24 selected delegate onboarding\nw/o July 31 delegation & program kick off\n\n\n**Steps to implement**\n\n1. Funds distribution: From Treasury to the Contract. Contract to Rari Foundation’s wallet. \n2. Locking $RARI: 6 months lock where cliff = slope = 3 months. \n3. Note: Having this kind of lock configuration of $RARI to veRARI, the ratio will be 33%. Therefore, to achieve 2000 veRARI, 6k $RARI should be locked (per delegate).\n4. Delegating funds to the addresses of the selected candidates.\n5. Report to the community on the status of delegations.\n6. Weekly monitoring of delegate activities to ensure adherence to terms.\n7. End of program report and learnings for future editions.\n\n\n",

      "title": "RRC-7: Rewards-2 (resubmitted)",
      "content": "The previous proposal had an error in contract details.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis document proposes a new $RARI rewards program that is designed to launch a network effect among community marketplaces and their users to build and trade on Rarible Protocol. The suggested mechanism of rewards distribution, lock up period and other specifications is based on the feedback provided by the community in the wake of the latest $RARI rewards program.\n\nTo enter into long term partnerships with premiere brands on the market and strengthen the rewards program as a whole, our goal is to choose active projects that are committed to marketing within their own communities to amplify the reach of the rewards program and community marketplaces.\n\nMotivation\n\nWe believe in a future where individual creators and communities have their own marketplaces instead of big marketplaces dominating the space – a trend we are already seeing in traditional ecommerce as Shopify reaches half the size of Amazon marketplace in terms of GMV. On top of that, NFTs generally behave like luxury goods, all of which have their individual marketplaces. With that in mind, Rarible Protocol exists as a decentralized infrastructure to power these individual front-ends.\n\nWhile there are more than 1500 marketplaces working on top of the protocol, market behavior still hasn’t changed towards individuals choosing these marketplaces as their go-to platforms to trade items.\n\nTo date, network effect has been the key factor in Rarible’s success, $RARI rewards program being one of the main tools to achieve it during Rarible’s first big breakthrough in 2020. In fall 2022, RARI Foundation voted to bring back the program. While being successful, the last program identified a number of areas for improvements that were extensively discussed within the community.\n\nOur main goals for this round of the rewards program are to have a 50% market share traded on Rarible for the selected collections as well as trailing sales on the collections once the period of incentives have finished.\n\nWe suggest using $RARI incentives to promote community specific marketplaces and establish this narrative.\n\nWe only need several big and successful marketplaces up and running to kickstart it.\n\nRationale\n\nAs NFT collections evolve into vibrant autonomous communities, they outgrow generic NFT marketplaces. Demand for community marketplaces as the next logical step for their development is growing, and Rarible is the leading provider of this infrastructure. The more projects choosing to build their community marketplace on Rarible, and the more users that adopt a habit of trading there, the faster it will reach wider adoption.\n\nWhile extending rewards to community marketplaces, this proposal aims to incorporate the following changes to the program based on community feedback:\n\nDistribute rewards across active community marketplaces While collections with little to no activity did generate up to 50% of volume growth during the last $RARI rewards program, they did not create any sustainable growth and sales dropped back again as soon as the liquidity incentives ended. At the same time, collections that actively engaged their community, doing new drops and communicating with their users, were able to generate trailing sales with lasting change even after the incentives ended.\n\nThis is why we are proposing to distribute rewards through community marketplaces with vibrant communities. Active communication and promotion of community marketplaces by their creators will be a prerequisite for participation.\n\nIncrease the duration of incentives program from 1-2 weeks to 90 days A clear take away from the previous rewards program was that collections that received rewards over a longer period of time performed the best across the total time of their incentive period. To create observable behavioral change, we propose that all participating marketplaces will receive incentives over an extended period of time.\n\nWe believe spreading the total $RARI spend across a longer period of time will not only lighten the cost load but will also allow for community marketplaces to really take advantage of the entire rewards program period and push to their communities.\n\nLower the cost of $RARI rewards program The $RARI rewards initial round was an expensive program to run. 420,000 $RARI were distributed across a period of four weeks. To make it more sustainable, we propose to lower the overall cost of the program to 400,000 $RARI while increasing the reward period to 90 days. Each collection's budget will be determined separately and derived from the total budget.\n\nThe proposed numbers were calculated based on the following considerations:\n\nThe team holds 30% of the token supply, another 25% has been distributed to the community during previous airdrop programs, And the Foundation currently holds 11.2m RARI which is about ~45% of the total RARI supply.\n\nThe previous program was designed after 420,00 RARI which is about 1.7% of total supply of the token, reducing the foundation budget from 46.7% to 45% of the total supply. It was designed to spend 10,000 RARI per 5 collections per day. Which is 2,000 RARI per collection per day.\n\nDecreasing sell pressure on $RARI by extending the lock up period to 6 months $RARI token price dropped noticeably 2 months after completion of the previous rewards program – exactly as the rewards lock up period expired. To avoid the same scenario in the future and attract more long-term oriented community members, we propose to extend the lock up time frame to 9 fully linear months. Ongoing conversations with the community confirmed that this idea is highly supported by participants.\n\nReplacing royalties cash back with bid rewards There are multiple considerations as to why we believe royalties cash back should be removed:\n\nRoyalties cash back wasn’t popular among users. In combination with listing rewards, it was too high for cheaper collections, which resulted in negative impact to their floor price.\n\nThe previous program had two components: Listing rewards and Royalty cash back. While listing rewards were quite effective and popular, royalty cash-back was poorly used.\n\nAnother issue experienced by the Nyolings community showed that listing rewards incentivized listing items lower and lower, resulting in the floor being driven down.\n\nThis brings us to the idea of creating a new mechanism that would drive the floor up and bring liquidity to community marketplaces – bid incentives. We propose the same structure of rewards for Bids as for listings from program #1:\n\nSorting bids by price and assigning them position numbers Reward each bid with exponentially more points the higher their bid is\n\nExample: There is a Bored Apes collection. Current best floor bid is 10 ETH, which is way below bored apes floor. Imagine there is a floor bid of 60 ETH on any ape in the collection. That means that any bored ape holder has the ability to instantly sell their ape for 60 ETH. This creates great utility of the marketplace for sellers. Therefore sellers build behavior by going to the marketplace where liquidity lives.\n\nTo be eligible for the rewards, bids should be within 25% of the floor.\n\nCommunity marketplace selection mechanism As outlined in the rationale above, the goal of the new rewards program is to incentivize community marketplace adoption and sticky behavior among the leading projects in the industry and their users. To meet that goal, we propose that 5 collections will be picked out by a team made up of Foundation & Rarible.com.\n\nRegardless of the age and stage of the project we wish to partner with, it must align with the values and tenants of the Foundation. Additionally, each project must meet a set of criteria which are as follows:\n\nProduct that aligns with the Foundation and that the Foundation believes in. A provable track record of active communication, transparency, and accountability. Long-term mindset with goals, activations, and developments planned for established times in the future using community marketplace as main secondary market; option for primary market for drops as well. Commitment to strengthen the marketing efforts done by Rarible & The Foundation Must be willing to push the narrative surrounding Community Marketplaces in a way that satisfies the Foundation, Rarible, and the project in question.\n\nDirect community across all socials to the community marketplace created for them. Establish the narrative that the CM is the main marketplace for the project. Encourage buying, selling, trading to be done with the CM.\n\nThe metrics of success used to evaluate and track community marketplace partnerships are as follows:\n\nTotal market share for the collection during and after the duration of the program\n\nSocial metrics for discord, twitter, mirror, and other applicable sites\n\nTotal number of connected wallets to the community marketplace(s)\n\nNew leads generated from the overall narrative during the program. i.e. new marketplaces created and other collections reaching out to build a community marketplace.\n\nKey Terms $RARI - the official token ticker of the ERC-20 token that governs Rarible Protocol ecosystem\n\nCommunity Marketplace - trading platform specific to individual project or collection that has the main functionality of a generic NFT marketplace\n\nPoints - listing rewards accumulated by a user every 10 minutes according to the predefined formula. Points are converted into $RARI tokens at the end of every day.\n\nList & Bid Rewards - token incentives received by users who make listings or place bids on collections\n\nClaim - the action of requesting $RARI rewards from the claims contract. Rewards are not distributed automatically to a user’s wallet and need to be claimed. Lock is created after claiming\n\nLock Period - the time during which claimed rewards remain unavailable for transacting or trading\n\nLinear Unlock - release schedule when tokens are unlocked in small increments over an extended period of time\n\nSpecifications\n\nTotal budget\n\nA total budget of 400,000 $RARI is allocated to 5 collections with community marketplaces built on Rarible infrastructure. The total budget is distributed among 5 collections (chosen by the team of RARI Foundation and Rarible.com members according to the proposed criteria) over the course of 90 days.\n\nEach collection's budget will be determined and derived from the total budget of 400,000 $RARI. Everyone who lists items or places bids on collections on participating community marketplaces will receive a share of $RARI via points system.\n\nListing and bid rewards algorithm\n\nTake a list of listings with their respective positions sorted by price ascending Ex. Listings\n\n1 - 1ETH, 2 - 1.1 ETH 3 - 1.3 ETH Take a list of bids with their respective positions sorted by price descending Ex Bids 1 - 0.99 ETH 2 - 0.95 ETH 3 - 0.8 ETH Every 10 minutes each listing and bid accrues Points according to the formula Formula for listings: 10+90/sqrt(number of items with same or cheaper price) Formula for bids: 10+90/sqrt(number of items with same or greater bid) If there are two bids of the same price, they receive the same amount of points. During the last program, points were accrued according to the formula 100+900/N. This time SQRT parameter is added to the formula to make the slope of distribution more even. Also made the points number smaller by factor of 10 to prevent huge numbers. Only bids and listings with created/updated 5 minutes+ of age are counted. Updating an item price / item bid constantly would result in not getting any rewards. Only listings up to 1.4x of floor price are counted. Only the first 100 bids and first 100 listings are counted Only bids greater than 75% of floor price are counted. Bid must be placed for a collection, not an individual item\n\nBids example: (floor price 1 ETH):\n\nCollection #1 has 5 bids: [0.9] [0.8] [0.8] [0.77] [0.74] ETH\n\nLet’s calculate the Points that will be given to each bid every 10 minutes:\n\nThe formula is POINTS = 10+90/SQRT(N), where N is the position of the bid\n\n0.9 ETH = 10 + 90 / sqrt(1) = 100 points\n\n0.8 ETH = 10 + 90 / sqrt(3) = 61 points // this bids have same amount of points because there are a total of 2 bids at that price, and 1 bid with better price\n\n0.8 ETH = 10 + 90 / sqrt(3) = 61 points //\n\n0.77 ETH = 10 + 90 / sqrt(4) = 55 points\n\n0.74 ETH = 0 points // this item has a bid lower than 75% of floor price.\n\nListings example (floor price 1 ETH):\n\nCollection #1 has 6 listings [1] [1] [1.1] [1.1] [1.3] [1.41] ETH\n\nRewards:\n\n1 ETH = 10 + 90 / sqrt(2) = 73 points // this doesn’t receive max amount of points, because there is another item at the floor price\n\n1 ETH = 10 + 90 / sqrt(2) = 73 points // they both receive 73 points\n\n1.1 ETH = 10 + 90 / sqrt(4) = 55 points // they both receive points because there are 2 items with better price\n\n1.1 ETH = 10 + 90 / sqrt(4) = 55 points // and 2 items at the same price\n\n1.3 ETH = 10 + 90 / sqrt(5) = 50 points\n\n1.41 ETH = 0 points // because item price is greater than 1.4 x floor price\n\nPoint system and conversion\n\nIt is important to understand that the total Points accumulated by each user depend on all other participants’ activity – how many users bid and do listings, at what price etc. – so it’s different from day to day. Even if you repeated all the same actions with the same amounts, the number of points you get on different days won’t be the same.\n\nYour personal rewards are relative to cumulative activity on a collection for the last 24h. Total points earned by program participants get converted to $RARI every 24 hours proportionally out of the daily budget. The entire daily budget gets distributed to all daily points earned equally.\n\nExample:\n\nThe total budget of 400,000 $RARI is distributed among 5 collections over the course of 90 days, which means the daily budget per collection is 888 $RARI.\n\nAs an example, let’s imagine a day of the program when 100 listings and 50 bids were made. According to the formula POINTS = 10+90/sqrt(number of items with same or cheaper price), in this scenario listings from 1 to 10 generate 2670 POINTS every 10 minutes, which gives us 380,000 POINTS per day.\n\nBids are going to generate 1650 POINTS every 10 minutes, amounting to 230,000 points per day. Together with listings, this brings the total number of generated points to 610,000 in total. All 888 RARI would be equally divided between 610,000 points.\n\nIn this scenario, listing #1 would get 100 Points every 10 minutes, which means 14,400 points a day. To calculate the number of $RARI this listing would receive that day, we multiply it by 888 (daily $RARI budget per collection) and divide by 610,000 (total number of points received by both listings and bids that day). 888 * 14400/610000 = 20.9 RARI.\n\nAt this pace, the earnings for this participant would be 628 $RARI/month and 1,888 $RARI per program duration.\n\nNote: points earned on different collections are the same. So in case of several collections receiving rewards at the same time. Total budget for all collections are what is then dispersed equally among all point earners\n\nRewards lock-up algorithm\n\nAfter a participant clicks “Claim”, a lock is automatically created with a 9 month linear unlock, to protect $RARI from sell pressure: 3 month (13 weeks) Lock and 6 month linear unlock (26 weeks)\n\nExample: If a user claimed 1000 $RARI on March 1, 2023, the tokens won’t be unlocked until July 1, 2023. After that, every week a 1/26th part of $RARI is unlocked.\n\nDue to tech reasons, the same lock-up mechanism will be applied to all unclaimed rewards. It won't affect existing locks that a user has, but if a user has unclaimed RARI from the previous program, then the new lock will be created on all tokens with 9 month lock-up – even if unclaimed RARI is for the previous program.\n\nSteps to implement Change locking parameters. New locks after claiming to be created with lock-up of 3 months + 6 months of linear unlock. Transfer 400,000 RARI to the Claiming Wallet 0xcD9f82Fe3B60a5C8482A69279AB5C8d0Be19cA24 and Approve Spending of 400,000 by Claiming Contract 0xc633F65A1BEBD433DF12D9F3ac7aCF31b26Ca1E6\n\nNote: This is a little ambiguous, claiming wallet and claiming contract are two different things, where Claiming Wallet is where tokens are stored, while claiming contract is a tech tool that spends them. This is done so that tokens for example might be moved back from Claiming Wallet to the main treasury.\n\nSteps for tally submission:\n\nCall Data is prepared with a tool https://abi.hashex.org/\n\nAction #1 Transfer Tokens Target Wallet Address: 0xcD9f82Fe3B60a5C8482A69279AB5C8d0Be19cA24 Value: choose RARI from dropdown Value 400,000 Click “Add Action” Action #2 Custom Action Target Contract address: 0xcD9f82Fe3B60a5C8482A69279AB5C8d0Be19cA24 Contract Method: “invoke” Calldatas: _to: 0xFca59Cd816aB1eaD66534D82bc21E7515cE441CF _value: 0 _data: 0x39509351000000000000000000000000c633f65a1bebd433df12d9f3ac7acf31b26ca1e60000000000000000000000000000000000000000000054b40b1f852bda000000 Click “Continue”",

      "content": "# Oamo Partnership Proposal\n\n**PSA: This proposal is posted on behalf of Oamo by Andreitr but does not represent an endorsement of the proposal.** \n\n# TLDR\n \nOamo is a decentralized data broker that allows individuals to own and monetize their data while remaining anonymous. To fuel our data economy, we help companies find high quality leads based on off-chain and on-chain data, generate deep insights reports into their behavior, and target them with tailored offers directly via Oamo. \n\nOur proposal looks to onboard the Rarible DAO as a launch partner for our upcoming Beta. We would require the Foundation to provide $5,000 in RARI in incentives to be distributed to Oamo users who share data anonymously with the Foundation. The Foundation would then be required to create an exclusive offer for incentivized users in the form of a giveaway, allowlist, or discount. \n\n100% of the funds will be distributed to Rarible DAO’s target audience that meet its identified on-chain and off-chain behaviors. \n\n# Problem / Opportunity\nWeb3 organizations experience growth challenges as user behavior is split amongst multiple on-chain and off-chain data sources. On-chain data is fragmented across multiple wallet addresses with little to no relationship while there is no seamless way to attribute a user’s off-chain behavior (i.e. Twitter, Discord, Steam) to their wallets’ activity. There are no currently no tools to properly understand user behavior across all their major data sources.\n\nEven if organizations can understand part of a user journey, their targeting stack remains limited to Web2 native strategies such as Twitter sponsored posts or email marketing. It makes it extremely difficult to reach their target audience and personalize promotions, leading to low conversion rates and low ROI for marketing campaigns. \n\nTo solve those issues, Oamo is building a platform that allows organizations to build relationships with their target audience to understand their on-chain and off-chain behavior and present them offers that meet their interests. \n\n**Here are the main components of Oamo’s solution:** \n\n* **Decentralized identity (DID):** Users can create their decentralized identity and connect their wallet addresses and social profiles. All data added to a user's DID is encrypted and permissioned by the user. Once users connect their data sources, Oamo generates qualifiers based on their on-chain and off-chain behaviors. These qualifiers unlock opportunities for users to monetize their data anonymously via data pools.\n\n* **Data Pools:** Businesses can create data pools to acquire insights into the on-chain and off-chain behavior of their target audience. Users can opt-in to pools for which they have the required qualifiers and contribute data. Upon opt-in, users earn rewards while their data is aggregated and anonymized with all other pool participants to generate behavioral insights.\n\n* **Campaigns:** Businesses can send tailored promotions and surveys to data pool participants directly via Oamo's messaging system. By using on-chain and off-chain criteria, businesses can guarantee that only high-quality leads that fit their target audience receive the offers. This benefits both users and businesses as users receive offers that match their interests, and businesses can target users who are more likely to convert.\n\nOur proposal requests **$5,000 in $RARI tokens** to be used to fund a Rarible DAO data pool on Oamo. \n\nWe look to provide a solution to Rarible DAO to acquire high quality users, reward the loyalty of its community members, and understand the behavior of its target audience. \n# Funding Milestones and Payments \n\n* Phase 1: Oamo will gather Rarible DAO’s target audience requirements to provide preliminary insights reports based on available on-chain data. No payment required. Delivered by May 15th 2023. \n* Phase 2: Oamo will develop the on-chain and off-chain criteria required by Rarible DAO for its upcoming data pool. No payment required.

Oamo will not retain any fees. \n\n# Business Model \n\nOamo will not charge any fees for its Beta.

This acts as the first small step in a larger governance incentivization program we’d like to develop. To be eligible for the airdrop, the community member should meet the following conditions:\n\n1. Locked or delegated $RARI between 1 October 2022-1 March 2023\n2. Locked & voted\n3. Delegated & that delegate voted\n4. Received delegation & voting\n\nWe propose to distribute the equivalent of $5k USD in $RARI (3275 RARI). Following the same conditions as the $RARI rewards, the airdropped tokens will be locked for 9 months with a 3-month hard lock and a 6-month linear unlock.\n\n**Airdrop eligibility formula:**\nVariables are relative to the Columns in the google sheet\n\nYou locked & Voted (D * J)\nYou delegated & they voted (M)\nYou received delegation & voted (C * J)\nYou locked & voted (fixed reward, min 5 Rari needed)\n\nPrior to the airdrop, there was a snapshot taken where we scrape the on-chain actions of the Foundation members to determine the eligibility and exact claim for the airdrop. Doing this as a retroactive snapshot helps to discourage negative behavior patterns like reward farming.\n\nOnce the snapshot was taken the formula above was used to calculate the total amount of $Rari you will receive.\n\n**Steps to implement**\nSnapshot to be taken to determine eligibility\nRun the eligibility formula based on snapshot\nTransfer appropriate funds from treasury to corresponding wallets\n\n**Google sheet for formulas:**\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12tkulmKOE07AFY-gXNiYZpYVr7EkjH1-XKYLVy210SE/edit#gid=0\n",

      "title": "RRC-7: Rewards-2",
      "content": "Abstract\n\nThis document proposes a new $RARI rewards program that is designed to launch a network effect among community marketplaces and their users to build and trade on Rarible Protocol. The suggested mechanism of rewards distribution, lock up period and other specifications is based on the feedback provided by the community in the wake of the latest $RARI rewards program.\n\n\nTo enter into long term partnerships with premiere brands on the market and strengthen the rewards program as a whole, our goal is to choose active projects that are committed to marketing within their own communities to amplify the reach of the rewards program and community marketplaces.\n\n\nMotivation\n\nWe believe in a future where individual creators and communities have their own marketplaces instead of big marketplaces dominating the space – a trend we are already seeing in traditional ecommerce as Shopify reaches half the size of Amazon marketplace in terms of GMV. On top of that, NFTs generally behave like luxury goods, all of which have their individual marketplaces. With that in mind, Rarible Protocol exists as a decentralized infrastructure to power these individual front-ends.\n\n\nWhile there are more than 1500 marketplaces working on top of the protocol, market behavior still hasn’t changed towards individuals choosing these marketplaces as their go-to platforms to trade items.\n\n\nTo date, network effect has been the key factor in Rarible’s success, $RARI rewards program being one of the main tools to achieve it during Rarible’s first big breakthrough in 2020. In fall 2022, RARI Foundation voted to bring back the program. While being successful, the last program identified a number of areas for improvements that were extensively discussed within the community.\n\n\nOur main goals for this round of the rewards program are to have a 50% market share traded on Rarible for the selected collections as well as trailing sales on the collections once the period of incentives have finished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe suggest using $RARI incentives to promote community specific marketplaces and establish this narrative.\n\nWe only need several big and successful marketplaces up and running to kickstart it.\n\n Rationale\n\nAs NFT collections evolve into vibrant autonomous communities, they outgrow generic NFT marketplaces. Demand for community marketplaces as the next logical step for their development is growing, and Rarible is the leading provider of this infrastructure. The more projects choosing to build their community marketplace on Rarible, and the more users that adopt a habit of trading there, the faster it will reach wider adoption.\n\nWhile extending rewards to community marketplaces, this proposal aims to incorporate the following changes to the program based on community feedback:\n\n\nDistribute rewards across active community marketplaces\nWhile collections with little to no activity did generate up to 50% of volume growth during the last $RARI rewards program, they did not create any sustainable growth and sales dropped back again as soon as the liquidity incentives ended. At the same time, collections that  actively engaged their community, doing new drops and communicating with their users, were able to generate trailing sales with lasting change even after the incentives ended.\n\n\nThis is why we are proposing to distribute rewards through community marketplaces with vibrant communities. Active communication and promotion of community marketplaces by their creators will be a prerequisite for participation.\n\n\nIncrease the duration of incentives program from 1-2 weeks to 90 days\nA clear take away from the previous rewards program was that collections that received rewards over a longer period of time performed the best across the total time of their incentive period. To create observable behavioral change, we propose that all participating marketplaces will receive incentives over an extended period of time.\n\n\nWe believe spreading the total $RARI spend across a longer period of time will not only lighten the cost load but will also allow for community marketplaces to really take advantage of the entire rewards program period and push to their communities.\n\n\nLower the cost of $RARI rewards program\nThe $RARI rewards initial round was an expensive program to run. 420,000 $RARI were distributed across a period of four weeks. To make it more sustainable, we propose to lower the overall cost of the program to 400,000 $RARI while increasing the reward period to 90 days. Each collection's budget will be determined separately and derived from the total budget.\n\n\nThe proposed numbers were calculated based on the following considerations:\n\n\nThe team holds 30% of the token supply, another 25% has been distributed to the community during previous airdrop programs, And the Foundation currently holds 11.2m RARI which is about ~45% of the total RARI supply.\n\n\nThe previous program was designed after 420,00 RARI which is about 1.7% of total supply of the token, reducing the foundation budget from 46.7% to 45% of the total supply. It was designed to spend 10,000 RARI per 5 collections per day. Which is 2,000 RARI per collection per day.\n\nDecreasing sell pressure on $RARI by extending the lock up period to 6 months\n$RARI token price dropped noticeably 2 months after completion of the previous rewards program – exactly as the rewards lock up period expired. To avoid the same scenario in the future and attract more long-term oriented community members, we propose to extend the lock up time frame to 9 fully linear months. Ongoing conversations with the community confirmed that this idea is highly supported by participants.\n\n\nReplacing royalties cash back with bid rewards\nThere are multiple considerations as to why we believe royalties cash back should be removed:\n\nRoyalties cash back wasn’t popular among users.\nIn combination with listing rewards, it was too high for cheaper collections, which resulted in negative impact to their floor price.\n\nThe previous program had two components: Listing rewards and Royalty cash back. While listing rewards were quite effective and popular, royalty cash-back was poorly used.\n\n\nAnother issue experienced by the Nyolings community showed that listing rewards incentivized listing items lower and lower, resulting in the floor being driven down.\n\n\nThis brings us to the idea of creating a new mechanism that would drive the floor up and bring liquidity to community marketplaces – bid incentives. We propose the same structure of rewards for Bids as for listings from program #1:\n\n\nSorting bids by price and assigning them position numbers\nReward each bid with exponentially more points the higher their bid is\n\nExample: There is a Bored Apes collection. Current best floor bid is 10 ETH, which is way below bored apes floor. Imagine there is a floor bid of 60 ETH on any ape in the collection. That means that any bored ape holder has the ability to instantly sell their ape for 60 ETH. This creates great utility of the marketplace for sellers. Therefore sellers build behavior by going to the marketplace where liquidity lives.\n\n\nTo be eligible for the rewards, bids should be within 25% of the floor.\n\nCommunity marketplace selection mechanism\nAs outlined in the rationale above, the goal of the new rewards program is to incentivize community marketplace adoption and sticky behavior among the leading projects in the industry and their users. To meet that goal, we propose that 5 collections will be picked out by a team made up of Foundation & Rarible.com.\n\nRegardless of the age and stage of the project we wish to partner with, it must align with the values and tenants of the Foundation. Additionally, each project must meet a set of criteria which are as follows:\n\nProduct that aligns with the Foundation and that the Foundation believes in.\nA provable track record of active communication, transparency, and accountability.\nLong-term mindset with goals, activations, and developments planned for established times in the future using community marketplace as main secondary market; option for primary market for drops as well.\nCommitment to strengthen the marketing efforts done by Rarible & The Foundation\nMust be willing to push the narrative surrounding Community Marketplaces in a way that satisfies the Foundation, Rarible, and the project in question.\n\nDirect community across all socials to the community marketplace created for them. Establish the narrative that the CM is the main marketplace for the project. Encourage buying, selling, trading to be done with the CM.\n\nThe metrics of success used to evaluate and track community marketplace partnerships are as follows:\n\n1. Total market share for the collection during and after the duration of the program\n\n2. Social metrics for discord, twitter, mirror, and other applicable sites\n\n3. Total number of connected wallets to the community marketplace(s)\n\n4. New leads generated from the overall narrative during the program. i.e. new marketplaces created and other collections reaching out to build a community marketplace.\n\n\n\nKey Terms\n$RARI - the official token ticker of the ERC-20 token that governs Rarible Protocol ecosystem\n\nCommunity Marketplace - trading platform specific to individual project or collection that has the main functionality of a generic NFT marketplace\n\nPoints - listing rewards accumulated by a user every 10 minutes according to the predefined formula. Points are converted into $RARI tokens at the end of every day.\n\nList & Bid Rewards - token incentives received by users who make listings or place bids on collections\n\nClaim - the action of requesting $RARI rewards from the claims contract. Rewards are not distributed automatically to a user’s wallet and need to be claimed. Lock is created after claiming\n\nLock Period - the time during which claimed rewards remain unavailable for transacting or trading\n\nLinear Unlock - release schedule when tokens are unlocked in small increments over an extended period of time\n\n\n\nSpecifications\n\nTotal budget\n\n\nA total budget of 400,000 $RARI is allocated to 5 collections with community marketplaces built on Rarible infrastructure. The total budget is distributed among 5 collections (chosen by the team of RARI Foundation and Rarible.com members according to the proposed criteria) over the course of 90 days.\n\n\nEach collection's budget will be determined and derived from the total budget of 400,000 $RARI. Everyone who lists items or places bids on collections on participating community marketplaces will receive a share of $RARI via points system.\n\n\nListing and bid rewards algorithm\n\n\nTake a list of listings with their respective positions sorted by price ascending\nEx. Listings\n\n1 -  1ETH,\n2 - 1.1 ETH\n3 - 1.3 ETH\nTake a list of bids with their respective positions sorted by price descending\nEx Bids\n1 - 0.99 ETH\n2 - 0.95 ETH\n3 - 0.8 ETH\nEvery 10 minutes each listing and bid accrues Points according to the formula\nFormula for listings: 10+90/sqrt(number of items with same or cheaper price)\nFormula for bids: 10+90/sqrt(number of items with same or greater bid)\nIf there are two bids of the same price, they receive the same amount of points.\nDuring the last program, points were accrued according to the formula 100+900/N. This time SQRT parameter is added to the formula to make the slope of distribution more even. Also made the points number smaller by factor of 10 to prevent huge numbers.\nOnly bids and listings with created/updated 5 minutes+ of age are counted. Updating an item price / item bid constantly would result in not getting any rewards.\nOnly listings up to 1.4x of floor price are counted.\nOnly the first 100 bids and first 100 listings are counted\nOnly bids greater than 75% of floor price are counted.\nBid must be placed for a collection, not an individual item\n\n\nBids example: (floor price 1 ETH):\n\nCollection #1  has 5 bids: [0.9] [0.8] [0.8] [0.77] [0.74] ETH\n\n\nLet’s calculate the Points that will be given to each bid every 10 minutes:\n\nThe formula is POINTS = 10+90/SQRT(N), where N is the position of the bid\n\n\n0.9 ETH = 10 + 90 / sqrt(1) = 100 points\n\n0.8 ETH = 10 + 90 / sqrt(3) = 61 points // this bids have same amount of points because there are a total of 2 bids at that price, and 1 bid with better price\n\n0.8 ETH = 10 + 90 / sqrt(3) = 61 points //\n\n0.77 ETH = 10 + 90 / sqrt(4) = 55 points\n\n0.74 ETH = 0 points // this item has a bid lower than 75% of floor price.\n\n\nListings example (floor price 1 ETH):\n\nCollection #1 has 6 listings [1] [1] [1.1] [1.1] [1.3] [1.41] ETH\n\n\nRewards:\n\n- 1 ETH = 10 + 90 / sqrt(2) = 73 points // this doesn’t receive max amount of points, because there is another item at the floor price\n\n- 1 ETH = 10 + 90 / sqrt(2) = 73 points // they both receive 73 points\n\n- 1.1 ETH = 10 + 90 / sqrt(4) = 55 points // they both receive points because there are 2 items with better price\n\n- 1.1 ETH = 10 + 90 / sqrt(4) = 55 points // and 2 items at the same price\n\n- 1.3 ETH = 10 + 90 / sqrt(5) = 50 points\n\n- 1.41 ETH = 0 points // because item price is greater than 1.4 x floor price\n\n\n\n\nPoint system and conversion\n\n\nIt is important to understand that the total Points accumulated by each user depend on all other participants’ activity – how many users bid and do listings, at what price etc. – so it’s different from day to day. Even if you repeated all the same actions with the same amounts, the number of points you get on different days won’t be the same.\n\nYour personal rewards are relative to cumulative activity on a collection for the last 24h. Total points earned by program participants get converted to $RARI every 24 hours proportionally out of the daily budget. The entire daily budget gets distributed to all daily points earned equally.\n\n\nExample:\n\nThe total budget of 400,000 $RARI is distributed among 5 collections over the course of 90 days, which means the daily budget per collection is 888 $RARI.\n\n\nAs an example, let’s imagine a day of the program when 100 listings and 50 bids were made. According to the formula POINTS = 10+90/sqrt(number of items with same or cheaper price), in this scenario listings from 1 to 10 generate 2670 POINTS every 10 minutes, which gives us 380,000 POINTS per day.\n\n\nBids are going to generate 1650 POINTS every 10 minutes, amounting to 230,000 points per day. Together with listings, this brings the total number of generated points to 610,000 in total. All 888 RARI would be equally divided between 610,000 points.\n\n\nIn this scenario, listing #1 would get 100 Points every 10 minutes, which means 14,400 points a day. To calculate the number of $RARI this listing would receive that day, we multiply it by 888 (daily $RARI budget per collection) and divide by 610,000 (total number of points received by both listings and bids that day). 888 * 14400/610000 = 20.9 RARI.\n\n\nAt this pace, the earnings for this participant would be 628 $RARI/month and 1,888 $RARI per program duration.\n\n\nNote: points earned on different collections are the same. So in case of several collections receiving rewards at the same time. Total budget for all collections are what is then dispersed equally among all point earners\n\n\n\n\nRewards lock-up algorithm\n\n\nAfter a participant clicks “Claim”, a lock is automatically created with a 9 month linear unlock, to protect $RARI from sell pressure: 3 month (13 weeks) Lock and 6 month linear unlock  (26 weeks)\n\n\nExample: If a user claimed 1000 $RARI on March 1, 2023, the tokens won’t be unlocked until July 1, 2023. After that, every week a 1/26th part of $RARI is unlocked.\n\n\nDue to tech reasons, the same lock-up mechanism will be applied to all unclaimed rewards. It won't affect existing locks that a user has, but if a user has unclaimed RARI from the previous program, then the new lock will be created on all tokens with 9 month lock-up – even if unclaimed RARI is for the previous program.\n\n\n\nSteps to implement\nChange locking parameters. New locks after claiming to be created with lock-up of 3 months + 6 months of linear unlock.\nTransfer 400,000 RARI to the Claiming Wallet 0xcD9f82Fe3B60a5C8482A69279AB5C8d0Be19cA24 and\nApprove Spending of 400,000 by Claiming Contract 0xc633F65A1BEBD433DF12D9F3ac7aCF31b26Ca1E6\n\nNote: This is a little ambiguous, claiming wallet and claiming contract are two different things, where Claiming Wallet is where tokens are stored, while claiming contract is a tech tool that spends them. This is done so that tokens for example might be moved back from Claiming Wallet to the main treasury.\n\n\nSteps for tally submission:\n\n\nCall Data is prepared with a tool https://abi.hashex.org/\n\n\nAction #1\nTransfer Tokens\nTarget Wallet Address: 0xcD9f82Fe3B60a5C8482A69279AB5C8d0Be19cA24\nValue:\nchoose RARI from dropdown\nValue 400,000\nClick “Add Action”\nAction #2\nCustom Action\nTarget Contract address: 0xcD9f82Fe3B60a5C8482A69279AB5C8d0Be19cA24\nContract Method: “invoke”\nCalldatas:\n_to: 0xFca59Cd816aB1eaD66534D82bc21E7515cE441CF\n_value: 0\n_data: 0x39509351000000000000000000000000c633f65a1bebd433df12d9f3ac7acf31b26ca1e60000000000000000000000000000000000000000000054b40b1f852bda000000\nClick “Continue”\n",

      "content": "**Abstract**\n\nThe aim of this proposal is to request a loan of tokens from the RARI Foundation treasury to AlphaLab Capital Group.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nBy lending tokens from the RARI Foundation treasury, the RARI Foundation can earn a yield on its tokens that are currently sitting idle.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nAlphaLab Capital Group (“ALC”) is a technology-driven trading firm that transacts over $2B a day in cryptoassets across 60+ exchanges, both centralized and decentralized. Since 2017, we have provided market liquidity and efficient price discovery. Our team of 70+ engineers have previous experience building technology and trading algorithms at companies like Citadel, Tower Research Capital, Goldman Sachs, and Stripe. We operate thousands of trading algorithms 24/7 on a globally distributed network of 500+ trading servers.\nWe are interested to borrow tokens from the RARI Foundation treasury for our own proprietary trading operations.\n**\nKey Terms (optional)**\n\nVolume-weighted average price (VWAP): The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a measurement that shows the average price of a security, adjusted for its volume. It is calculated during a specific trading session by taking the total dollar value of trading in the security and dividing it by the volume of trades.\n**\nSpecifications**\n\n• Loan Amount: 1% of total token supply or 250,000 tokens\n• Loan Start Date: When the tokens have been received by ALC\n• Loan Duration: 18 months\n• Interest Rate: 1% per annum\n• Interest Rate Payment Terms: interest is to be repaid in $RARI tokens, at the end of the loan duration.\n• Loan Repayment Terms: At the end of the Loan Duration, ALC will return any combination of loaned $RARI tokens and USDC with the $RARI token value based on the 7-day volume-weighted average price (VWAP) [as measured on Coingecko or Coinmarketcap after the Loan Start Date. For example, if the 7-day VWAP after go-live is $2.20, then at the end of the contract ALC may return either 250,000 tokens or $550,000 USDC or some combination thereof, plus any accrued interest.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\n\nThe steps to implement the proposal, including associated costs, manpower, any legal documentation and risk assessment (if applicable) and other resources for each step where applicable. The steps must be described with sufficient specificity to leave as little room for the Board to exercise discretion in implementing the proposal.\nTo implement this loan, a loan agreement with appropriate covenants will be entered into with the RARI Foundation.\nUpon approval of this proposal, the tokens would be transferred to an ALC wallet which will be provided at a later date.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nRelevant timing details, including but not limited to start date, milestones, and completion dates.\nThe tentative Loan Start Date is end December 2022, although this is open to revision depending on the DAO proposal and legal reviews.\nThe proposed Loan Duration is 18 months.\n\n**Overall Cost**\n\nThe total cost to implement the proposal.\nThere is no cost to the RARI Foundation to implement this proposal.",

      "title": "Rarible Twitter Bot built with Rarible Protocol API",
      "content": "We propose a Twitter bot that will share the most relevant events from the Rarible Marketplace via the Rarible Protocol API automatically and in real time. The bot will increase Rarible’s brand awareness by creating opportunities for users–including collectors, artists, and newcomers–to engage directly with Rarible’s content on Twitter.\n\nMotivation\n---------------\n\nArtists and collectors rely on Twitter for the most up-to-date information on and discussion of emerging trends in the NFT space. A real-time Twitter bot will highlight the top sales, trending collections, and showcase top collectors, creating many opportunities per day for community members to engage with Rarible’s data. Rarible’s bot will become a reliable source of NFT information on the most active social platform in the community.\n\nRationale\n---------------\n\nRarible Protocol has one of the best NFT APIs in the space, and we want to showcase that for Rarible. The only other way to achieve the same results would be to hire a team of social media managers. But a team of social media managers would be slower and more expensive. Just hire a bot :)\n\nBudget\n---------------\t\n\n- Total: **6,970** $RARI\n- Development: **5,150** $RARI\n- Support + Premium account 1yr: **1,820** $RARI\n\nSpecifications \n---------------\t\n\nThe bot will run on the [@rarible_bot](https://twitter.com/rarible_bot) Twitter account, will be fully configurable via the BotFrens UI, and implement the following behaviors:\n\n- Share Top sales\n- Share Trending collections\n- Share Top collections\n- Share Top buyers\n- Share Top sellers\n\nUpon the completion of the project, the @rarible_bot Twitter account along with the associated BotFrens account will be turned over to Rarible’s marketing team.\n\nTeam\n---------------\nThis is [Andrei](https://twitter.com/andreitr) and [Cody](https://twitter.com/ItsCodyBraun) and we are the co-founders of [BotFrens](https://botfrens.com/). For the past seven years, we have been using bots to help artists, museums, art marketplaces, and DAOs share their collections on social media. Our bots are followed by 6.5M accounts on Twitter and have shared millions of posts.\n\nWe’ve been working closely with Rarible’s dev team to launch 100s of bots using Rarible Protoco API. Some examples of our work:\n\n- [Nouns](https://twitter.com/nouns_bot) ([Funded by Nouns DAO](https://nouns.wtf/vote/144))\n- [Foundation](https://twitter.com/Foundation_Bot)\n- [Art Blocks](https://twitter.com/artblocks_bot)\n- [Moonbirds](https://twitter.com/moonbirds_bot)\n- [TinyDinos](https://twitter.com/tinydinos_bot)\n- [GoblinTown](https://twitter.com/goblintown_bot)\n- [BrainDrops](https://twitter.com/braindrops_bot)\n- […and hundreds more](https://twitter.com/botfrens)\n\n\nSteps to implement\n---------------\t\n\n**Share Top Sales**\n\nFilter sales by price threshold, tweet only sales above > ETH\n\nTweet Copy\n\n```\nCollected by collector.eth for 1.23 ETH ($3,333)\n\nWant to find out more?\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0x31d45de84fde2fb36575085e05754a4932dd5170:4089\n```\n\n\n**Trending Collections**\n\nTweet Copy\n\n```\n[COLLECTION NAME] is trending on @Rarible\n\nVolume increased by 11600% in the last 24 hours with 2,457 sales totaling 99.3 ETH\nhttps://rarible.com/dementorstownwtf\n```\n\n\n**Top Collections**\n\nTweet Copy\n\n```\nHere are the top 3 collections on @Rarible in the past 24 hours:\n\nCollection name volume 1,203 ETH\nCollection name volume 938 ETH\nCollection name volume 123 ETH\n\nhttps://rarible.com/rankings?day=DAY\n```\n\n**Top Buyers**\n\nTweet Copy\n\n```\nShoutout to the top 3 buyers on @Rarible in the past 24 hours:\n\nfistbuyer.eth spent 123ETH\nsecondbuyer.eth spent 99ETH\nthirdbuyer.eth spent 55ETH\n```\n\n**Top Sellers**\n\nTweet Copy\n\n```\nTaking profits?

      "content": "**ABSTRACT**\nThis document proposes to allocate funds for the DAO operational budget for 6 months in the amount of 475,000 USDC. \n**MOTIVATION**\nIn order to drive the adoption of Rarible Protocol and the development of decentralized NFT infrastructure products, resources need to be allocated to engage with several contributors who will be responsible for community building and product strategy. RARI DAO also shall review some proposals from the legal perspective to stay compliant with the law, which entails additional expenses. \n\nThe assumption is that RARI DAO will be working with the most skilled and professional contractors on the market, and it is necessary for the Foundation’s success to be able to offer compensation in stable coins or fiat money instead of $RARI in order to be competitive. \n**\nRATIONALE**\nAs the Foundation is at the very beginning of its development, a dedicated team is required to deliver value while the community is growing and maturing. These contributors will ensure continuity of the DAO operation and keep the ball rolling while the DAO continues its way towards gradual decentralization. \n\nOperational Budget shall be spent to serve key Foundation purposes: \n-\tOngoing support of the Foundation Community\n-\tDefine and iterate on the product strategy and roadmap for the Foundation \n-\tPotential development and ongoing tech support of the Foundation \n-\tLaunch partnerships with other players in the web3 space \n-\tLegal support of the community initiatives \n\n**KEY TERMS**\nN/a\n**SPECIFICATIONS**\nContributors (Team) to be paid once a month in USDC unless otherwise agreed in their contracts. \n\nLink to job descriptions: \n-\tCommunity / Operations\n-\tSenior Front End Engineer\n-\tProduct Leader\n-\tMarketing Specialist\n\n\nLegal and Administrative costs to be paid upon receiving invoices from the Foundation service providers as per engagement letters or agreements with such entities. \n\nhttps://forum.rari.foundation/uploads/default/original/1X/dae81a81ff24f5726751d009642c85f9f7d9de22.png\n\n\nAll spendings exceeding the budgeted amount shall be approved by token holders separately. \n\n**STEPS TO IMPLEMENT**\n\nUpon the budget approval the amount required to fund the first quarter of operations to be transferred to the operational wallet (0x2a83d2891Ef3df6967E3C2e9b69cCc7aD029736), converted to USDC to reduce exchange rate fluctuation risk and stored on the operational wallet 0x2a83d2891Ef3df6967E3C2e9b69cCc7aD029736B. \n\nFind contributors [block “Team”] and agree with them on the terms. \n\nAuthorize the Foundation and its director to sign agreements with contributors upon approval by legal advisors. \n\nPayments within the approved budget in accordance with signed contracts to be made by the Director of Foundation who will be responsible for the budget. \n",

      "content": "We propose a Twitter bot that will share the most relevant events from the Rarible Marketplace via the Rarible Protocol API automatically and in real time. The bot will increase Rarible’s brand awareness by creating opportunities for users–including collectors, artists, and newcomers–to engage directly with Rarible’s content on Twitter.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nArtists and collectors rely on Twitter for the most up-to-date information on and discussion of emerging trends in the NFT space. A real-time Twitter bot will highlight the top sales, trending collections, and showcase top collectors, creating many opportunities per day for community members to engage with Rarible’s data. Rarible’s bot will become a reliable source of NFT information on the most active social platform in the community.\n\n\n**Rationale**\n\nRarible Protocol has one of the best NFT APIs in the space, and we want to showcase that for Rarible. The only other way to achieve the same results would be to hire a team of social media managers. But a team of social media managers would be slower and more expensive. Just hire a bot :)\n\n\n**Budget**\n\n- Total: 5,320.00 $RARI\n- Development: 3,600.00 $RARI\n- Support + Premium account 1yr: 1,720.00 $RARI\n\n\n**Specifications** \n\nThe bot will run on the @rarible_bot Twitter account, will be fully configurable via the BotFrens UI, and implement the following behaviors:\n\n- Share Top sales\n- Share Trending collections\n- Share Top collections\n- Share Top buyers\n- Share Top sellers\n\nUpon the completion of the project, the [@rarible_bot](https://twitter.com/rarible_bot) Twitter account along with the associated BotFrens account will be turned over to Rarible’s marketing team.\n\n\n**Steps to implement**\n\n\n**Share Top Sales**\n\nFilter sales by price threshold, tweet only sales above > ETH\n\nTweet Copy\n```\nCollected by collector.eth for 1.23 ETH ($3,333)\n\nWant to find out more?\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0x31d45de84fde2fb36575085e05754a4932dd5170:4089\n```\n\n**Trending Collections**\n\nTweet Copy\n```\n[COLLECTION NAME] is trending on @Rarible\n\nVolume increased by 11600% in the last 24 hours with 2,457 sales totaling 99.3 ETH\nhttps://rarible.com/dementorstownwtf\n```\n\n**Top Collections**\n\nTweet Copy\n```\nHere are the top 3 collections on @Rarible in the past 24 hours:\n\nCollection name volume 1,203 ETH\nCollection name volume 938 ETH\nCollection name volume 123 ETH\n\nhttps://rarible.com/rankings?day=DAY\n```\n\n**Top Buyers**\n\nTweet Copy\n```\nShoutout to the top 3 buyers on @Rarible in the past 24 hours:\n\nfistbuyer.eth spent 123ETH\nsecondbuyer.eth spent 99ETH\nthirdbuyer.eth spent 55ETH\n```\n\n**Top Sellers**\n\nTweet Copy\n```\nTaking profits?

      "content": "Category: Ecosystem Fund Allocation\nAuthor: Campbell Law\nAbstract \nThis document proposes a retroactive $RARI token airdrop for Rarible Protocol users, including those users of Rarible.com and Protocol-powered community marketplaces, for the past 3 months in order to support and incentivize loyal community members with RARI Prime membership. \nMotivation\nThe proposed distribution is intended to reward users for interacting within Rarible Protocol contracts and incentivize future use of products within the Rarible Protocol ecosystem. The last several months were marked by an overall decline in the number of transactions and trading volume across the NFT market, and this proposed airdrop is aimed at supporting loyal community members and long-term believers who stuck by the Rarible Protocol during the bear market.\n\nEligible users will be able to claim 100 $RARI each, which will enter them into the RARI Prime membership program. \nRationale \nAs a reward for their loyalty and use of the Rarible Protocol, Rarible.com users will receive retroactive $RARI rewards if they bought, sold, or listed an NFT on the secondary market on Rarible.com and community marketplaces built on Rarible Protocol. \n\nAll primary listings, including listings utilizing the “lazy mint” feature, will not be eligible for the airdrop, since it is impossible to evaluate the impact of primary listings for the marketplace ecosystem if a sale has not happened.\nSpecifications \nThe snapshot of users who bought >= 3 NFT through Rarible. Both native Rarible listings as well as proxied OpenSea listings do qualify\n\nTotal number of users: 550\n\nA total of 55,000 $RARI tokens will be allocated. $RARI rewards are equally distributed among eligible users in the amount of 100 $RARI for each user. \nSteps to implement \nTake a snapshot on the selected date.\nPublish snapshot on the forum\nDetermine the eligibility criteria to ensure that exactly 500 addresses are eligible, resulting in the overall distribution total of 55,000 $RARI\nTransfer to a separate wallet for Safe Contract controllable via veRARI (address: 0xcD9f82Fe3B60a5C8482A69279AB5C8d0Be19cA24) \n$55,000 RARI for the program\n",

      "content": "Category: Ecosystem Fund Allocation\nAuthor: Campbell Law\nABSTRACT\nThis proposal outlines the vision and process of onboarding a collective of partners in efforts to spread awareness and provide ongoing support to Rarible 2, an aggregated NFT marketplace where users can view and purchase Ethereum NFTs from marketplaces including Rarible, OpenSea, LooksRare, X2Y2 and Sudoswap, powered by $RARI rewards, starting from the public launch. It provides a detailed overview of the partner selection process, outreach requirements, compensation plan and recognition of potential benefits from partner utilization. \nMOTIVATION\nBy allocating $RARI to existing brand partners and new Key Opinion Leaders who support Rarible 2, this proposal aims to create a word-of-mouth chain reaction. The anticipated network effect will hopefully increase visibility and brand awareness of Rarible 2 and encourage new users to join the platform.\nRATIONALE\nSince the launch of Rarible as the first community-owned marketplace, the RARI community has built a strong network of projects and influencers with a multimillion following combined. This allocation of $RARI aims at effectively engaging and broadening this partner network through incentives for spreading awareness around Rarible 2 in their respective communities. \n\nPartners who meet the specific requirements (number of followers, influence in web3 space) will receive $RARI token rewards as a program sign up bonus, and will be expected to support Rarible 2 through various social channels. As Rarible is a household name with many partners already using the platform, the generated content will be natively generated. \nKEY TERMS\nPartner Marketing - a strategic collaboration between parties, whether it is two businesses or a business and an individual\n\nDeliverables - tangible or intangible outputs that are submitted within the scope of a project.\n\nCompensation - monetary payment given to an individual in exchange for their services.\nSPECIFICATIONS\nPartner Selection Criteria:\nSocial content style \nNumber of followers and engagement\nMinimum follower count = 10K\nRelevance and influence within the Web3/NFT space \n\nOutreach Requirements:\nProvide full overview of product \nDeliverables - continuous $RARI support via socials\n(2) Twitter posts per week\nSpecific tags will be required to disclose partnership\n#RariPartner / #RariRewardPartner\n@Rarible \n\nCompensation Plan:\n$RARI will be used as the payment method for the partners as a compensation and authentic user experience \nMax total budget = 20,000 $RARI\n1000 $RARI (locked) per partner\n1 month full token lock-up\n12-week vesting schedule\n83.3 $RARI/week\n\nPartner Utilization Benefits:\nAmplification for Rarible 2 \nBuild and maintain key relationships for future opportunities\nWide-spread network through partner social channels to reach target audience\nIncrease in brand awareness and GMV\nGenerate new leads \n\n\nSTEPS TO IMPLEMENT\nPartner research and outreach \nConfirm timelines and deliverables\nProvide suggested social copies and required partnership disclosure tags\nTransfer to a separate wallet for Safe Contract controllable via veRARI (address: 0xcD9f82Fe3B60a5C8482A69279AB5C8d0Be19cA24) \n20,000 RARI for the progra\n",

      "title": "RRC-2: $RARI listing & trading incentives",
      "content": "Category:  Ecosystem Fund Allocation\nAuthor: Campbell Law \nAbstract\nThis document proposes a new $RARI rewards system for listing NFTs on Rarible and buying NFTs from the Rarible aggregated NFT marketplace to incentivize users and capture value. It introduces the concept of RARI Rewards Collections that veRARI token holders will be able to vote on to identify 5 NFT collections eligible for $RARI rewards on a weekly basis, as well as 0% marketplace fees for RARI Prime members.\nMotivation\nBy introducing a long-awaited update to the $RARI rewards system, this proposal aims to establish a committed community of token holders and create a strong network effect that will increase engagement and attract new users to the Rarible aggregated NFT marketplace. \n\nThis is aimed tol be achieved by clear and concise mechanics for holders to lock their $RARI and receive veRARI that they can use to vote for collections to subsidize liquidity, and enjoy 0% trading fees on the marketplace. As a result, the hope is that this system will result in user stickiness leading to recurring trades on Rarible.\n\nLiquidity incentives include:\n\nListing rewards paid to the lowest priced items with exponential decay.\nPurchase rewards paid proportionally to the volume of royalties paid, including purchases from other marketplaces, acting as royalties cashback. \n\nThis hopefully will create a vortex of liquidity moving from order books of carefully selected collections to Rarible Protocol’s order book. \n\nRationale\nWhether the goods are digital or physical, marketplaces compete for two things to provide value to users: listings and sales. The greater the number of listings on a marketplace, the faster a buyer will find the item they seek. And the more buyers a marketplace attracts, the faster a seller can sell at the desired price. \n\nThis creates network effects, where each user provides positive externalities to every other user, which in turn attracts more users. This means the more liquidity a marketplace already has, the more liquidity it will likely attract in the future. As liquidity thus compounds, user experience improves.\n\nNeither additional features nor desirable branding compensate for lower liquidity. This is why both web2 and web3 marketplaces subsidize network effects to attract users to their platform. \n\n$RARI started as a governance token with liquidity incentives directly incentivizing trading volume. The program succeeded in increasing volume, but at the cost of incentivizing wash trading and lacking long-term value capture. The RARI community voted to end the program in January 2022. \n\nThe proposed token incentives for listing and buying on Rarible and Rarible Protocol-powered community marketplaces let us attract liquidity and kickstart the virtuous cycle outlined above in a sustainable way. \n\n\n\nThe proposed comprehensive update to $RARI tokenomics introduces: \n\n\n$RARI locking for power to vote for collections to receive liquidity incentives\nListing rewards for Rarible Protocol orderbook\nBuying rewards for aggregated orders; royalties cashback\nRARI Prime benefits program\n\nVoting\nTo avoid spreading incentives too thinly (e.g. incentivizing all collections at once), this document proposes to concentrate liquidity incentives among a few collections selected by the community. To make the choice mechanism fair, this proposal contemplates introducing a Weekly leaderboard selected by veRARI holders. By rotating collections that receive liquidity incentives, veRARI holders can make sure hot collections are incentivized for a specific period of time in order to bootstrap native demand and user stickiness. \nListing rewards\nTo create a healthy marketplace, this proposal aims to incentivize listings (sell orders) as close to the fair market value as possible. The program will start by choosing 5 collections for liquidity incentives and implement the following model inspired by bonding curves: \n\nThe lowest priced listing with a price below 1.4X of the floor of a particular collection receives the highest reward with an exponential decay. The longer an item remains listed, the more value it provides to deter holders from listing items for mere seconds before delisting.\nBuying rewards: royalties cashback\nTo process more transactions, both sides of the market are necessary. That’s why an objective of this proposal is to encourage buyers by offering them rewards as well. Rarible Protocol’s access to orders aggregated from other marketplaces’ order books plays a key part here. Regardless of wherever an item is listed, if a user bought such an item through an aggregator, they can claim a reward.\n\nIt’s important to note that we expect that the royalties cashback program will mainly be used to balance the supply/demand in the first weeks/months of the program, such that over time rewards will decrease. \nRARI Prime: 0% Rarible orderbook fees and other perks\nThe RARI Prime program is intended to be built on top of the new token locking program. This mechanism aims to create value capture by providing fee discounts to “preferred” traders based on the time commitments, thus helping to establish a core community incentivized to cast votes to subsidize liquidity for promising  NFT collections with long-term value additions. As a basic rule, it is expected that the orderbook fee will be 0% for power users that lock sufficient amounts of $RARI.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey terms\nveRARI – a non-standard ERC-20 implementation representing non-transferable voting power a holder receives upon locking their $RARI in a voting-escrow contract for a chosen period of time. Technically, veRARI is a non-standard ERC20 token implementation. \n\nLock – an instance of locked $RARI with a specific Release Schedule. One address can have multiple Locks with different Release Schedules. E.g. one may have a Lock of 100 $RARI with a one-month Release Schedule, and another Lock of 1000 $RARI with a two-year Release Schedule. \n\nEpoch – predefined period of time equal to 1 week, during which Buying and Listing Rewards are applicable for 5 selected Collections. \n\nWeekly voting leaderboard – weekly ranking of collections voted on by veRARI token holders, listed in the order according to the number of received votes. \n\nPoints – listing rewards accumulated by a user every 10 minutes according to the predefined formula. Points are converted into $RARI tokens at the end of every day. \n\nClaiming – the process of receiving $RARI rewards from the claims contract. Rewards are not distributed automatically to a user’s wallet and need to be claimed. \n \nRARI Prime – a status granted to $RARI lockers alongside with benefits including veRARI voting power, 0% marketplace fees, a special badge on Rarible marketplace, and private Discord access. \nSpecifications\nThis document proposes to allocate a total of 420,000 $RARI over the period of 1 month for these liquidity incentives:\n\n\n1 week - 30,000 $RARI/day\n2-4 week - 10,000 $RARI/day\n30,000*7+10,000*7*3 = 420,000\n\n75% of daily rewards to be allocated as listing rewards (1 Week - 22,500 $RARI)\n25% of daily rewards to be allocated as trading rewards (1 Week - 7,500 $RARI)\nVoting\nA long-term oriented community of veRARI holders will decide which collections should receive liquidity incentives. The top 5 collections ranked by number of votes at any time will receive liquidity incentives. To enable fair participation, a collection will not be able to receive liquidity incentives for longer than 2 weeks out of every 4 weeks.\n\nTerms: \nThere is a weekly Epoch cadence for elected collections. Votes are locked in every week at the same time (12 am UTC)\nEvery week veRARI holders can cast their vote for a specific collection to be allocated$RARI rewards the following week \nVote is attached to a collection as long as the veRARI balance is kept.\nEx: I’m casting 100 veRARI for the collection “mfers”\nVotes can be changed up until the point of epoch lock-in and recast to another collection\nTop 5 collections sorted by total sum of votes attached to them are deemed eligible for incentives.\nA collection can’t receive more than 2 weeks of liquidity incentives during any 4 weeks time period.\nThe Rarible team reserves the right to vote for 1 Collection every week with the team’s tokens. \nRewards Lock\nTo avoid potential inflationary issues tied to incentive allocations, this proposal suggests the following distribution process: \n\n20% of allocated rewards to be released instantly to users; \n80% of allocated rewards to be automatically locked for 1 month and gradually unlocked over the course of 4 weeks. \n\nThe proposed process is aimed at incentivizing users via ongoingly rewards, hopefully creating sticky behaviors. \nListing rewards \nTerms:\nOnly listings in Rarible native orderbook under 1.4x of the floor price are eligible for rewards\nEvery 10 minutes, sorted listings will be updated by price from low to high. \nStarting from listing #1 to listing #100 according to the floor price, each listing generates POINTS for every 10 minutes of existence according to the following formula: \nPoints(N) = 900/N+100, where N is the listing number.\nNow this might sound complex, but let’s see examples: \nListing #1 gets 1000 points every 10 minutes\nListing #2 gets 550 points every 10 minutes\nListing #3 gets 400 points every 10 minutes\nListing #4 gets 325 points every 10 minutes\nListing #5 gets 280 points every 10 minutes\nListing #6 gets 250 points every 10 minutes\n…\nListing #20 gets 145 points every 10 minutes\n…\nListing #50 gets 118 points every 10 minutes\nListing #100 gets 109 points every 10 minutes\n\nIf there is a “fresh” (i.e., new) listing, it should be live for at least 5 minutes before the first 10 minute epoch to qualify for rewards. (This aims to address bots listing just before the epoch and delisting seconds after)\nRewards are valid while listings are active.\nEvery 24 hours, points are converted into $RARI. Daily $RARI rewards are  distributed proportionately in accordance to each user’s accumulated Points among all accumulated Points\n$RARI can be claimed at a user's discretion.\nBuying rewards: royalties cashback\nTerms: \nThe same list of top 5 eligible collections participates in the program.\nEach user’s U.S. dollar value of royalties is calculated. \nEvery 24 hours all royalties spent by all users are summed.\nIf that number is less than total amount of $RARI rewards allocated daily for the Royalties Cashback (7,500 RARI for the first week):\nReward = $royalties_paid\nIf total royalties paid are greater than the daily rewards pool, this pool is split equally among all the buyers proportionally to royalties they paid.\nIn this case, Reward = $royalties_paid/total_royalties * Daily_reward_pool\n\nIt is intended that the royalties cashback is a temporary program that will decay over time, and the Listing Rewards program will take greater priority / share of allocated rewards.\nRari Prime\nRequirements: \nOwn 20 veRARI from all your Locks, which is an equivalent of 100 $RARI locked for 1 month.\n\nBenefits: \n0% Rarible marketplace & protocol fees (i.e. buy and sell on Rarible and Rarible Protocol-powered marketplaces for free)\nFee discounts schedule is expected to be actively governed to achieve protocol efficiency \nPrime Status on Rarible Marketplace\nAccess to a gated Discord community\n\nSteps to implement\nTransfer to a separate wallet for Safe Contract controllable via veRARI (address: 0xcD9f82Fe3B60a5C8482A69279AB5C8d0Be19cA24) \n420,000 RARI for the program\nApprove spending from Safe to Claims Contract\n",
