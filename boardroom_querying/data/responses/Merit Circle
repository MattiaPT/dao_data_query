      "content": "Although the Beam network and BEAM token launched back in Q3/Q4 2023, some of the key external facing project-related sites, documentation, DAO-adjacent entities, etc. of Beam have retained Merit Circle (“MC”) references or branding. This proposal builds further on MIP-27, MIP-28 and MIP-29, and seeks BEAM tokenholders’ approval to complete the transition away from the MC identity and towards the Beam identity.\n\nFirst, the completion of the transition will involve rebranding of all remaining Merit Circle community dedicated sites, social media handles and other external brand assets. Second, the current governance forum and Snapshot will be replaced with a new “Beam Governance Forum” and \"Beam Snapshot\", respectively, and the DAO governed by BEAM tokenholders will be referred to as Beam DAO. Third, the Constitution will be updated to reflect the Beam identity more clearly. Fourth, an entity named Beam Foundation will replace the MC Purpose Trust as the primary DAO-adjacent entity, and the governing documents of the Beam Foundation will enable certain checks and balances on the Beam Foundation and its subsidiaries via BEAM governance.\n\nThe predominant reason for these proposed steps is to ensure unity around the branding and strategic direction of Beam. A consolidated brand identity enhances marketing effectiveness and engagement, making it simpler to attract new members and users. With the Beam Foundation, the objective is to create an entity structure compatible with smart contract-based governance, and that is transparent and accountable to the Beam community.\n\nPlease read more about the proposal and relating discussions and documentation via the attached link.\n\nAre you in favor of this proposal?",

In this new proposal the authors present a proposal regarding the technical details relating to the execution of the token migration. More specifically, the proposal asks tokenholder approval to:\n\n1. Deploy a token migration smart contract on Ethereum that enables the migration of MC to BEAM. The open source code for the smart contract can be reviewed here: https://github.com/Merit-Circle/beam-token/blob/main/contracts/Migrator.sol.\n\n2. Receive USDC 10,000 from MC DAO’s treasury to cover smart contract audit costs. The smart contract audit is available here: https://github.com/Merit-Circle/beam-token/blob/main/audit/Beam_Token_Final_Report_QS.pdf.\n \n3. Convert the MC token into the BEAM token on a 1:100 basis, meaning that each MC token will make a tokenholder eligible to receive 100 BEAM tokens.\n \n4. Make the token migration contract accessible for migration for a 12-month period from the date of deployment. The date of deployment is still to be determined, but will be pre-announced in due time in all relevant community channels should the proposal pass.\n\nOnce the token migration contract is deployed and MC tokens may be migrated to BEAM tokens, the BEAM token will assume the current position of the MC token (including become the governance token and Beam network native token).\n\nPlease click on the link attached to read further details about the proposal and the discussions in this regard.",

Therefore, the authors have decided to limit the scope of the proposal to concern the question of whether the MC token should be migrated to the BEAM token. \n\nThe authors suggest that the technical details concerning the implementation of the proposal are made subject to a separate proposal that will be published if this proposal passes, which will lay out details surrounding the technical implementation and execution of a migration.  \n\nPlease click on the link attached to read further details about the proposal and the discussions in this regard.

      "content": "The development of the sovereign network Beam has been ongoing for several months and the mainnet has now been launched. Beam seeks to be a network specifically suited for gaming, aiming to enable game developers to easily, and at low cost, adopt and incorporate blockchain elements into their games. Activity on Beam will be centered around the MC token, as all transactions will require MC tokens to be utilized to cover gas fees. Large groups of contributors have been, and are continuing to be, involved in the development of Beam.\n\nThis proposal seeks MC tokenholder approval to:\n\n(1) Utilize up to 75 million MC tokens from MC DAO’s treasury for the purpose of liquidity on Beam, grants to games / game developers (used to cover gas fees on Beam), and for validating and securing the Beam network(s). It is important to emphasize that none of these MC tokens may be sold directly on the market or otherwise; the only scenarios where such tokens may come into “circulation” and become owned by a third-party are (a) through the mechanics of how an AMM functions and (b) as a result of validators (including delegators) collecting gas fees in connection with transactions on Beam that are funded by a grant.\n\n(2) Utilize up to 2.7 million USDC from MC DAO’s treasury, to develop Beam and certain ecosystem products (should all allocated funds not be utilised they shall be returned to the MC DAO treasury). 200,000 USDC of the sum is proposed to be utilized for liquidity purposes on the AMM on Beam.\n\nPlease click on the link attached to read further details about the proposal and the discussions in this regard.",

This proposal aims to decide how Merit Circle merchandise can be distributed to everyone who is connected to the DAO, giving the community a chance to be thanked for its contributions and support to Merit Circle DAO. \n\nSo what are we voting on?\n\nThe author proposes an equitable way of distributing merchandise through the use of so-called Merit Circle Tactile NFTs. Using these NFTs, NFT holders will be given the opportunity to choose the size of the items/merchandise in their box, and have it shipped to an address of their choice, anywhere in the world. \n\nIt is proposed that these NFTs will be distributed in two phases, which are outlined below (a total of 650 boxes with merchandise, with each box consisting of seven premium wearable items):\n\nPhase 1:\n\n5 - Creators of proposals that passed successfully.\n\n25 - Marketing batch - we gift a few NFTs to influencers who have contributed to Merit Circle in return for content\n\n45 - Wallets that voted most - we allow the 45 wallets that voted most to claim one of the NFTs.\n\n50 - Team - there will be 50 NFTs for core team members, contractors and people who worked on the tactile project\n\n50 - one NFT will be sent to each of the portfolio companies of the Merit Circle DAO\n\n75 - Largest stakers - we allow the top 75 of the largest stakers to claim one of the NFTs.\n\n100 - DAO reserve - will be allocated in benefit of the DAO (collaborations, recouping some of the investment value, etc).\n\nThe unclaimed balance of NFTs from this phase will be added to the raffle in phase 2.\n\nPhase 2:\n\n300 - Raffle for MC stakers and Edenhorde NFT holders - we allow anyone who has staked a minimum of one MC token or holds 4 Edenhorde NFTs to join a raffle. Snapshot has been made one minute before this proposal came up.\n\nAny unclaimed NFTs left after phase 2 will be added to the DAO reserves.\n\n***\n\nPlease click on the link attached to read further details on the proposal and the discussions in this regard.\n\nDo you agree with distributing the (first) collection of MC Tactile merchandise as set out in the proposal?",

For the purpose of stimulating these individuals to step up and contribute to the Merit Circle DAO, we propose that the DAO forms a committee that is granted the right to offer relatively small grants that will allow these developers/creators to focus on their project for a brief period of time. This period is meant to quickly figure out whether there’s product market fit, and whether the project requires additional funding.\n\nTo fund this grant system, an ongoing budget of up to 150,000 USD (USDC) per quarter is requested. The maximum amount that can be utilized for grant purposes per quarter is USD 150,000, but only up to a maximum of USD 10,000 per applicant for a research grant and up to a maximum of USD 25,000 per applicant for a development grant. Anything above these amounts will require going through the wider community before instruction to the multisig.\n\nPlease click on the link attached to read further details on the proposal and the discussions in this regard.\n\nDo you agree with adopting a grant arrangement for Merit Circle DAO as set out in the proposal?",

      "content": "Author\nSad Cat Capital\n\nSummary\nThis proposal puts forward the notion of burning 200,000,000 MC tokens from the Community Incentives allocation.\n\nDespite being allocated almost 30% of the starting 1b MC tokens, since the Community Incentives wallet was created, the tokens have had no utility and none have been spent.\n\nCurrently 6,125,000 tokens are being burned each month from the Community Incentives wallet, as per the proposal MIP-7, however the wallet 8 still has almost 200m MC tokens sitting in it. This contributes significantly to the total supply, and the fully diluted valuation of Merit Circle, as well as being included in calculations for upcoming token unlocks.\n\nBurning these (currently purposeless) tokens will significantly reduce the total supply of Merit Circle and will bring the fully diluted valuation more in line with the circulating market capitalization. Likewise it will remove any doubt from outsiders about upcoming token unlocks and whether these tokens will be hitting the market.\n\nWe also believe this will create a noticeable statement among the wider cryptocurrency community and further demonstrate Merit Circle’s continued commitment to sustainable tokenomics.\n\nDo you agree to the above proposal?",

      "title": " MIP-19 Upgrading to staking V2",
      "content": "The Merit Circle DAO staking module was always designed to evolve. This proposal seeks to implement the first upgrade to the current (v1) staking module, into staking v2. The planned overhaul will increase the options, flexibility and longevity of the staking module. The contours of this proposal are based on the lengthy forum discussions and several polls that have taken place within the Merit Circle community. This proposal also seeks to introduce a yearly staking policy poll, to adjust a set of fixed parameters for each year thereafter.\n\nThis proposal aims to set a hard number for next year’s MC subsidy (currently 10% for year one) and the bonus multipliers for stakers in the governance module.\n\nThe proposal further aims to allow for staking rewards in the form of airdrops, potential other forms of rewards, bonus and discount tiers on Merit Circle DAO products, but makes no hard promises for this. The DAO can (re-)evaluate and decide to overturn any of these reward mechanisms or, on the contrary, make specific proposals to expedite specific benefits for stakers.\n\nStaking v1 will be phased out and fully ended once the deposit of the last staker under staking v1 has been unlocked. Deposits in v1 will be disabled once v2 is live. Staking v1 stakers will only be able to withdraw their holdings when their stake has unlocked, at which time they can decide to stake in v2 or use their tokens otherwise. The same applies to those locked rewards that unlock 12 months from the moment of claiming. This applies to both the single staking pool ($MC) and the LP staking pool ($MC/ETH). Both pools will be replaced with v2 pools, a v2 single $MC pool and a v2 LP $MC/ETH pool.\n\nDo you agree with everything inside the proposal?",

At the time of voting on MP-1, the majority voted in favor of a MC/USDC pairing. Since that vote took place, a lot has occurred in the crypto space and the various DAO members have been discussing whether the DAO should conduct a new poll on the same matter. As a result, the MC DAO is now holding a new poll on the LP pairing through this MP-4. The result under MP-4 will replace the result in MP-1 and form input to the MIP draft that will follow.\n\nCurrently, the DAO’s staking scheme has a MC/ETH 50/50 Uniswap v2 pool, alongside single sided $MC staking. The old pool will be phased out as previously described in the staking v2 discussions - more elaborative information on the details regarding this will be provided in the MIP concerning adoption of a staking v2 model.\n\nSubject to the final MIP vote, the new LP pool should accrue the majority of the rewards the protocol will attribute to stakers (currently 80% v. 20% on the single sided staking under staking v1).\n\nWe would also like to remind everyone that the majority under MP-2 voted in favor of stakers being able to lock their assets for up to 48 months. Under MP-3 the majority voted in favor of having LP staking in the Uniswap v2 platform. We encourage everyone to review the discussions on staking v2 and the outcome of the previous polls.\n\nNote that the outcome of a MP vote will not have direct or permanent implications; they will only form input to the MIP drafts (see the more detailed explanation on the difference between MIPs and MPs above).",

It is proposed that the ongoing development of the NFT marketplace be undertaken and completed by the Merit Circle DAO. The Merit Circle DAO is focused on the gaming industry, and the blockchain industry specifically. The DAO is therefore in a unique position to launch an NFT and in-game asset Marketplace given the wide range of portfolio projects it has supported. The revenue generated by the NFT Marketplace will further contribute to the long-term viability of the Merit Circle DAO.\n\nThe full proposal and discussion thread can be found here:\nhttps://gov.meritcircle.io/t/development-of-nft-marketplace/609\n\nShould the DAO invest in the R&D and development of an NFT marketplace for the Merit Circle DAO?",

      "content": "Authors\nDouwe – Electric Dick Dev\n\nSummary\nMerit Circle is soon entering the NFT trading space with the release of the Sphere NFT Marketplace. Aggregators are a new tool for NFT trading. NFT aggregation is currently dominated by Gem, but there is plenty of opportunity for a new aggregator to enter the market. Together with Merit Circle, I want to develop an NFT aggregator that is user-friendly, and cheaper to use than any competitor. Having a well-developed NFT aggregator that natively integrates Sphere drives more volume to the marketplace, thereby generating more fees and revenue for the DAO.\n\nBudget\nThe proposed budget is $50,000, which will be used to finance the startup phase. The Merit Circle DAO will receive 50% of the aggregator’s common shares. The $50,000 will be used for branding, design, and closing a pre-seed equity round to fund the complete development of the aggregator.\n\nShould the DAO develop a NFT aggregator with Douwe and take a 50% equity stake for a $50,000 budget?\n\n1. The acceptance of this proposal grants the Merit Circle DAO 50% ownership in the to-be created equity of the proposed project. The remaining 50% will be owned by Douwe.\n\n2. In the event that a token is created, it should give Merit Circle DAO a pro-rata amount of tokens. Proportional to the amount of team tokens the team equity would get in such an event.\n\n3. Merit Circle will help with bootstrapping. This includes legals, branding, planning and fundraising. This is what the 50K budget is used for.\n\n4. After the bootstrap phase, Merit Circle DAO will remain a founding partner, but the aggregator team will be led by an independent team. The seed raise funds can be used by Douwe to comprise a team.\n\n5. Equity for additional valuable team members will be created during the fundraise. The size and allocation will be negotiated with the existing equity holders (MC DAO and Douwe) and investors.\n\nFull discussion can be found here; https://gov.meritcircle.io/t/mip-15-nft-aggregator-development/595",

The old pool will be phased out, current v1 stakers do not have to worry. They will receive similar relative proportional rewards, until the last staker is unlocked (1Y from new pool launch).\n\nThe new pool will accrue the majority of the dividends and subsidies the protocol will attribute to stakers (currently 80%). The pool will exist next to a single staking $MC pool, that also receives part of these staking rewards (currently 20%).\n\nIn the previous poll, the DAO decided that the LP stake can be locked for 0-48 months. The longer the lock, the higher the rewards for the staker. The bonus multiplier will be either linearly or exponentially.\n\nLP tokens will retain a similar voting weight as they have currently in the V1 system.

The pool will have a ratio of minimally 50% MC and maximally 90% MC (vs 50% to 90% of the pairing asset). \n\nThe current pool is a MC/ETH 50/50 Uniswap v2 pool. The old pool is phased out, current v1 stakers do not have to worry. They will receive the same proportional rewards, until the last staker is unlocked (1Y from new pool launch). \n\nThe new pool will accrue the majority of the dividends and subsidies the protocol will attribute to stakers (currently 80%). The pool will exist next to a single staking $MC pool, that also receives part of these staking rewards (currently 20%). \n\nThe LP stake can be locked for 0-48 months. The longer the lock, the higher the rewards for the staker. The bonus multiplier will be either linearly or exponentially. \n\nLP tokens will retain a similar voting weight as they have currently in the V1 system.\n\nLocked stakers could also get secondary benefits, such as airdrops from (partner) games or platform fee discounts.",

Similar to high quality equities (also cash flow producing entities) there is substantial evidence/research that the most economically beneficial use of free cash flow or net income (outside of reinvestment back in the business) fall into three categories . These include 1- S hare buybacks (if management feels market price is undervalued), 2- Dividend Payments to shareholders, and 3- in select cases accumulation of some amount of liquid high-quality assets to keep in Treasury for future operations, defense, investment, acquisitions, etc.\n\nI am proposing the following to align MC free cash flow/net income allocation away from the current framework and towards what is historically recognized as the best economic use of free cash flow with some flexibility given to the DAO, see link: (and for subsequent discussion)\n\nhttps://gov.meritcircle.io/t/improved-dao-free-cash-flow-net-income-allocation-proposal/356\n\nShould the Merit Circle DAO adopt this improved FCF/NI proposal?",

The treasury still has 53 Million USD sitting idle on the balance sheet. Anchor protocol offers an outlet to make USD stablecoins, in the form of UST, productive. Anchor Protocol currently offers a 19,5% yield fixed rate on deposits, while maintaining a lot of withdrawing and depositing flexibility. Deploying will diversify the stablecoin balance of the DAO and will increase the yield that the treasury assets will generate.\n\nRead full proposal and discussion here:\nhttps://gov.meritcircle.io/t/mip-11-deploy-idle-stablecoin-balance-into-anchor-protocol/361\n\nShould the Merit Circle DAO deploy 10M USD from the treasury assets into Anchor protocol?",

      "content": "Co-Authors: \nCitizenX\nMaven11\nFlow Ventures LP\n\nSummary\nMerit Circle DAO raised $105,576,956 million in the Balancer Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool on Copperlaunch. The sale concluded on November 5th at 2 pm UTC after a 3 day raises period. After the conclusion of the sale, these funds were sent to the MainDAO in a 4 out of 7 multisig. We are proposing that the DAO have a broad investment mandate so as to enable our sizable cash position to be as productive as possible for the DAOs benefit. This mandate will be developed and may, at a later stage, narrow the investment mandate and may also create sub-mandates. All these future proposals will be voted on by the Merit DAO community, the $MC token holders, before they are enacted.\n\nAbstract\nAfter concluding a record-breaking Balancer Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool on Copperlaunch there’s now a large cash position in the MainDAO’s wallet. This cash is currently sitting idle, and we are of the view that it should be being utilized to further the DAO and the Merit Circle’s objectives as soon as possible.\n\nThe complete proposal and discussion can be found here:\nhttps://gov.meritcircle.io/t/broad-investment-mandate/27/5\n\nAre you in favor of MIP-2 (Broad investment mandate)?\n",
