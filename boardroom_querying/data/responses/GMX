      "title": "GMX Security Committee",
      "content": "Summary\nWith the establishment of GMX’s governance on Tally, this proposal the creation of an elected Security Committee for GMX DAO. This committee will assign grant roles, update configurations, remove roles from malicious users, handle emergency stops if necessary, oversee passed governance proposals, and safeguard the governance process from unauthorised control.\n\nMotivation\nThe GMX ecosystem has grown rapidly, bringing both opportunities and risks. As the protocol expands, proactively managing these risks becomes increasingly essential to maintaining user trust and platform integrity. Establishing an elected Security Committee will provide a structured approach to risk management, enabling us to respond swiftly and effectively to emerging threats and vulnerabilities without needing to consult with the full DAO elected body. \n\nInitial Setup\nAll five positions will be directly elected by the DAO. The elections will be held every six months. At the end of each six-month term, there will be a re-election for the council.\n\nOver time the DAO may alter the size and term of such elections to align with the DAO and protocols security / risk requirements.\n\nRationale\nA dedicated Security Committee will identify and mitigate risks, assign multi-sig roles, update configurations, remove roles from malicious admins, and handle emergency stops if necessary. This expert group will also oversee passed governance proposals, thereby strengthening our protocol’s risk management. Their specialised knowledge and experience can help better identify and respond to potential risks, minimising adverse impacts on our ecosystem. They will also ensure continuous and smooth operation by assessing risks related to governance processes.\n\nSpecification\n\nKey Roles and Responsibilities\n1. Risk and Protocol Management: The Security Committee will maintain the GMX protocol by assigning grant roles, updating configurations, removing roles from malicious users, handling emergency stops if necessary, and overseeing passed governance proposals. Additionally, the committee will manage Immunefi bounties. Their proactive approach to risk identification and strategic planning aims to mitigate potential risks and ensure the protocol’s security and integrity.\n2. Community Engagement: The Security Committee will actively engage with the GMX community to gather insights, feedback, and concerns related to risk management. Having open communication channels, promotes collaboration and collective problem-solving in addressing protocol risks.\n3. Governance Compliance: In addition to risk management, the Security committee will ensure compliance with established governance protocols and best practices. This includes monitoring governance activities, enforcing adherence to guidelines, and advocating for governance decisions that prioritise protocol security and integrity. \n\nEmergency Response and Risk Management: In the event of security breaches or critical incidents, the council will swiftly and decisively take action to address the situation, minimise impact, and identify and mitigate potential security risks to protect the interests of GMX token holders.\n\nThe Security Committee will consist of five members, who will receive $500 per month for their roles and are expected to dedicate an average of 2 hours per week to committee activities. \n\nConclusion\nWith the formation of the Security Committee, GMX DAO reaffirms its commitment to maintaining a secure and resilient protocol ecosystem. By leveraging the expertise and dedication of our community members, GMX will be able to effectively navigate potential risks and uphold the highest standards of safety and reliability for all GMX stakeholders.\nAs GMX DAO embarks on this pivotal initiative, it reaffirms its commitment to prioritising risk management and security in all facets of protocol operations, by empowering the Security Committee and embracing community-driven governance.",

      "content": "Summary \nGMX received 8 million ARB tokens from the Arbitrum DAO in recognition of its contributions as builders and community members, and its pivotal role in growing DeFi on Arbitrum. To ensure the GMX DAO’s voice was heard on Arbitrum, a temporary delegation to Coinflipcanada was set up until the DAO established its own governance infrastructure. This proposal seeks to now establish that voice for GMX in matters related to governance beyond our own DAO. \n\nMotivation \nThe tokens were delegated to Coinflipcanada as a short-term solution, citing the passing of the STIP proposal and the establishment of a governance committee once GMX officially launches its on-chain DAO governance. (https://snapshot.org/#/gmx.eth/proposal/0xfa202e11656cee660fb926cd6f9205d6964b25a409c8686169a3a66b85f2a9e3)\n\nRationale \nPropose the establishment of a governance committee comprised of five individuals to formalise GMX’s governance structure. \n\nThe responsibilities of the GMX Governance Committee will include but are not limited to:\n\n. Actively participating in governance discussions and voting on proposals by the Arbitrum DAO and other DAOs in which GMX has a voice and interest\n. Representing the interests and perspectives of the GMX community in governance deliberations.\n. Providing regular updates and reports to the GMX community on the outcomes of governance discussions and decisions.\n. Collaborating with other members of Arbitrum governance to promote the interests of the broader DeFi ecosystem. \n\nInitial Setup\nIn the following yearly elections, all five positions will be directly elected by the DAO. Additionally, there will be a non-voting observer seat from Labs to ensure coordination where necessary. This includes giving feedback to the committee on GMX's non-governance-related activities with the Arbitrum DAO, foundation, and other external DAOs. \n\nCompensation \nMembers of the Governance committee would receive an honorarium for their roles. The proposed honorarium is $1000 per month. Nominees from labs are waiving receipt of the honorarium as they are already indirectly compensated and aligned with the GMX DAO through contributor agreements.",

      "title": "GMX Listing Committee",
      "content": "Summary\nThis proposal seeks to establish a GMX Listing Committee. The committee will evaluate and approve new asset listings on GMX protocols and ensure that only high-quality, relevant, and compliant assets are listed. This will not only foster trust but also play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of our trading ecosystem while also ensuring oversight of a potentially more rapid listing process.\n\nMotivation\nThe motivation behind forming a Listing Committee is to create a structured and transparent process for evaluating new asset listings. As GMX grows, it’s crucial to have focused resources rigourously evaluating and approving potential listings. This will help mitigate risks, ensure regulatory compliance, and maintain a high standard and diversity of assets available for trading. The committee will be vital in supporting GMX’s strategic growth and sustainability. \n\nRationale\nA well-defined and transparent listing process is essential for the credibility and success of any trading platform. By establishing a Listing Committee, GMX can:\n\n1. Ensure Quality and Security: Evaluate assets based on technical soundness, market potential, and security, ensuring that only high-quality and secure assets are listed.\n\n2. Enhance Trust: Provide transparency in the listing process, thereby increasing user confidence and trust in GMX.\n\n3. Foster Ecosystem Growth: Attract quality projects and assets that align with GMX’s vision, driving growth and user engagement.  \n\n4. Continuously Monitor and Optimize: Regularly evaluate supported assets to ensure they continue to meet GMX’s quality and security standards, and manage the de-listing process effectively so as to maintain a high standard for listed assets.\n\nSpecification:\n1. Committee Structure:\n. The committee will comprise 3 members, including Labs members and external experts.\n. Members should ideally have expertise in Perp Dexes, finance, security, or compliance.\n. Each member of the committee will receive $1000 per month for the role, and are expected to dedicate at least 10 hours per week to the role.\n\n2. Evaluation Criteria:\n. Technical Soundness: Review the asset’s smart contract code for security vulnerabilities and technical robustness.\n. Market Potential: Assess the asset’s market demand, liquidity, and community support.\n. Regulatory Compliance: Ensure the asset complies with relevant legal and regulatory requirements.\n. Project Team: Evaluate the credibility and track record of the asset’s development team.\n. Alignment with Platform Goals: Ensure the asset aligns with GMX’s strategic objectives and values.\n. Suitability: Ensure the asset follows the Asset Listing Framework established by the Risk Manager / Security Committee (See Chaos Labs Report: https://gov.gmx.io/t/new-assets-listing-framework/3660) \n\n3. Process:\n. Submission: Asset listing requests can be submitted directly by the asset’s project team and listing committee, or community members via the forum.\n. Initial Review: The Listing Committee conducts a preliminary review to filter out clearly ineligible assets.\n. Detailed Evaluation: Shortlisted assets undergo a thorough evaluation based on the criteria mentioned above.\n. Decision: The committee votes on whether to approve, reject, or request additional information about the asset and then optimistically puts their decision up for implementation.\n. Announcement: Approved assets are publicly announced and scheduled for listing. \n\nConclusion:\nEstablishing a Listing Committee will ensure a rigorous, transparent, swift and fair process for evaluating new asset listings on GMX. This initiative will enhance the platform’s credibility, attract high-quality projects, and maintain regulatory compliance.

      "title": "GMSOL or GMX-SOLANA? Decide then Sail",
      "content": "After nearly seven months of continuous development, the core development work for GMSOL v0.2 is nearing completion. All migrations from GMX V2, including the latest Shift and GLV, have been completed. The contract is currently pending further progress from our partners on the Solana deployment to finalize the integration. Some frontend modules related to GMSOL v0.2 also require adjustments based on partner‘s integration. We are working towards completing a preview version on Solana Devnet as soon as possible and allowing all users to test it.\n\nThe core overview of GMSOL is as follows:\n\nGMSOL will fully align with GMX V2 in terms of model and will primarily rely on GLV to provide liquidity to the entire market. The core code of GMSOL will be open-sourced after audits and before launch. Currently, the code can be viewed through the invitations, where GMX Delegates can apply for the access.\n\n60% of the fees will be allocated to the GMSOL Treasury, which will consist of 50% for buyback of GMX and 50% held in USDC.\n\nOnce the GMSOL Treasury reaches a certain scale, GLV: GMX-USDC will be deployed, and GMX will become a global liquidity token, providing liquidity to all markets supported by Chainlink Data Streams. This also prepares initial liquidity for potential deployment on more chains in the future. The GMSOL Treasury will be the key foundation for GMX becoming a global liquidity token across chains.\n\nThe address of the GMSOL Treasury will be public, with a 3/5 multi-signature structure: GMX Core Contributors will control 3 signatures, while GMSOL Core Contributors will control 2 signatures.\n\nGMSOL and the GMSOL Treasury will be fully managed and supervised by GMX DAO, but the initial updates to contracts and maintenance of risk parameters will be handled by a council made up of founding team members. Over time, as the project and community evolve, the governance structure will gradually achieve full decentralization. This governance structure ensures the project’s stable development while maximizing the safety of funds and maintaining close ties with the GMX community.\n\nBuilding on the original proposal, Xdev believes there should also be a vote on the name of GMSOL, choosing between GMX-SOLANA and GMSOL. The logo can remain unchanged, and there can be separate Twitter and Telegram groups. Xdev thinks that GMX-Solana might sound better to users, and since the GMX brand is owned by the community, it would be up to the community to grant permission for this usage. Xdev has also purchased the domain gmx.sol as a backup option.\n\nWe agree with Xdev’s analysis and acknowledge that both GMX-SOLANA and GMSOL have their own advantages. This matter should be left to the community to decide. Therefore, the vote will include four points:\n\nShould GMX DAO authorize GMSOL (GMX-SOLANA) to use the GMX V2 model and frontend code? GMX DAO would also retain the rights to GMSOL’s current and future models and code.\n\nShould GMX DAO authorize the GMX Treasury to fund GMSOL (GMX-SOLANA)'s first audit, with a cap of $250k?\n\nName choice: GMSOL or GMX-SOLANA?\n\nDomain choice: gmsol.pro or gmx.sol? (Note: The domain choice is independent of the name choice, meaning any combination is possible: (GMSOL, gmx.sol), (GMSOL, gmsol.pro), (GMX-SOLANA, gmx.sol), (GMX-SOLANA, gmsol.pro)).\n\nSince many of these critical issues have been sufficiently discussed in the initial proposal and there is broad consensus, we need to move forward as quickly as possible to meet key milestones/events for release. Therefore, this proposal will be put to a Snapshot vote in 5 days, and the vote will last for 5 days.",

      "title": "Integration of Chaos Labs' Risk Oracles in GMX DAO protocols",
      "content": "**Summary**\n\nThis proposal seeks to integrate Chaos Labs' Risk Oracle into the GMX protocol to improve the efficiency and accuracy of market parameter updates. The Risk Oracle will enable real-time and automated adjustments to market configurations, reducing manual intervention and enhancing the overall trading experience. This step aligns with GMX’s commitment to ensuring transparency and antifragility, while delegating critical tasks like risk-based market parameters and protocol upkeep to trusted, independent leaders in the space. \n\n**Motivation**\n\nChaos Labs is the Risk Manager for GMX DAO, providing essential market parameters for GMX V2. Currently, these parameters are updated manually after periodic reviews or in response to significant events affecting pools (e.g., changes in pool sizes, open interest, or external liquidity). While this process is effective, it introduces delays, leading to conservative parameters and higher fees to account for potential market fluctuations.\n\nBy integrating Chaos Labs' Risk Oracle, GMX will automate these updates, allowing the protocol to adjust critical parameters like price impact and max open interest in real-time. This integration will result in:\n\n* More competitive execution costs  \n* Reduced price manipulation risks  \n* Less manual workload for developers\n\nOverall, the integration ensures more precise, responsive, and secure risk management. \n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe integration of Chaos Labs' Risk Oracle will bring several key advantages to GMX:\n\n* **Real-time updates and automated adjustments:** They will ensure that critical parameters, such as price impact and max open interest (OI) configurations, are updated automatically. This will lead to better execution costs, more competitive pricing for traders, and added protection against price manipulation and imbalanced pools.  \n* **Enhanced Market Stability**: The system will dynamically adjust based on data from both centralised and decentralised exchanges (CEXs and DEXs), ensuring the protocol remains resilient against sudden market changes.  \n* **Increased Resilience**: The protocol becomes more antifragile by reducing its reliance on contributors for updates while still maintaining contingency mechanisms through Admins and the Security multisig as a fallback. \n\n**Specification**\n\n1. **Risk Oracle Integration**  \n   * **Data Source**: GMX will read risk parameters from the Chaos Labs' Risk Oracle.  \n   * **Parameter Updates**: The Keeper will observe, validate, and execute transactions to update on-chain market configurations based on Oracle data.  \n   * **Control Mechanism**: The Keeper will not directly control parameters; instead, GMX’s contract will retrieve values from the Oracle during transaction execution.  \n2. **Update Frequency**  \n   * All Parameters will be updated periodically, but the period for different parameters can differ. Our Keeper will always execute txn’s with new parameters immediately.   \n3. **Validation and Safety**  \n   * The Keeper will automatically validate updates within a predefined valid range and ensure that only whitelisted parameters are updated, while also applying validations to Chaos Labs' data. Additionally, contract-side validations will explicitly allow updates for specific parameters and markets, further ensuring the protocol's safety and integrity.  \n   * Initial updates will use narrower ranges for extra security. \n\n**Implementation Plan**\n\n* **Phase 1**: Support for maximum open interest updates  \n* **Phase 2**: Position price impact updates  \n* **Future**: Expanding to parameters like swap price impact, max pool size, funding rate, and borrowing rate.\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIntegrating Chaos Labs' Risk Oracle will allow GMX to adapt quickly to market conditions by accessing real-time data from CEXs and DEXs. Automating key market updates will improve trading conditions, bolster protection against market manipulation, and reduce manual intervention. \n\n**Next Steps**  \nWe invite the GMX DAO to vote on this proposal, moving forward with The integration of Chaos Labs' Risk Oracle to strengthen the protocol.",

      "title": "Implementation of GMX Liquidity Vaults (GLV) for Enhancing Liquidity",
      "content": "Summary\nGLV (GMX Liquidity Vaults) offers a new way for users to easily provide liquidity to GMX, using a single vault instead of directly to individual GM Pools. Each vault is configured to include various GM pools that all have the same underlying long token and short token. Utilizing the recently introduced SHIFT function, GLV’s dynamically allocate liquidity to their target GM pools based on factors including but not limited to pool utilization, fee generation, OI.\n\nBy consolidating multiple GM pools into a single GLV, liquidity providers (LPs) will benefit from enhanced rebalancing and improved liquidity management, which should deliver a more optimised return profile.\n\nGLV helps GMX to:\n\nimprove the overall capital efficiency of liquidity\nboost available liquidity for traders through periodic active rebalancing\nmore easily bootstrap sufficient liquidity for newly launched trading pairs\nThe proposal recommends integrating GLV vaults alongside existing V2 GM pools.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe implementation of GLV is a natural evolution of GMX V2. It combines the more granular market parameters and safety gains that V2’s isolated markets provide to LPs, with a more cohesive and accessible liquidity product like GLP introduced to the perp DEXs.\n\nThis combination can unlock more capital-efficient liquidity, and support for greater volumes / Open Interest across a broader set of markets.\n\nRationale\n\nCurrently, liquidity providers (LPs) contribute to individual GM pools, each containing a specific long and short token pair. GLV introduces a unified mechanism for pooling liquidity across multiple GM pools with identical token pairs. This system enables:\n\nEnhanced Capital Efficiency: GLVs allow for aggregated liquidity, reducing fragmentation and increasing the overall efficiency of capital deployment.\nImproved Liquidity for Traders: Active rebalancing within GLVs helps maintain optimal liquidity levels, resulting in a better trading experience for traders.\nSimplified LP Experience: By consolidating liquidity into GLVs, LPs can manage their investments more effectively without tracking multiple individual pools.\nStreamlining listing of new markets: Markets determined to be safe can be directly integrated into an appropriate GLV, ensuring access to sufficient liquidity without needing to initially bootstrap these markets individually.\nSpecifications\n\nBuying and Selling GLV:\n\nBuy GLV: Users can select either Single or Pair options. GLV tokens will be purchased using long, short, or eligible GM tokens. The UI will capture which underlying pool the funds will go to.\n\nSell GLV: Users can only select Pair options. The UI will capture which underlying pool the funds will be withdrawn from.\n\nFees and Price Impact:\n\nBuy GLV: Fees and impacts will mirror those of buying GM tokens. No additional fees are incurred for using GM tokens.\n\nSell GLV: No price impact. Close fees apply for exiting the GM pools.\n\nThe DAO may subsequently add fees to GLV, as an independent action or potentially combined with reducing fees on underlying GM markets.\n\nImplementation Plan:\n\nDesign and Development:\n\nCollaborate with developers and designers to implement changes to support GLV functionality.\n\nTesting and QA:\n\nConduct thorough testing of the GLV features.\n\nAddress any issues or bugs before deployment.\n\nDeployment:\n\nThe initial rollout of the GLV feature will use a phased approach to monitor performance and user feedback, including tight supply caps on GLV and the underlying target GMs. The first GLV proposed is WETH/USDC on Arbitrum, as this token pair includes the broadest set of markets available on GMX.\n\nMonitoring and Support:\n\nContinuously monitor the performance of GLV.\n\nProvide user support and make necessary adjustments based on feedback.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe introduction of GLV is set to significantly advance the GMX protocol’s liquidity management options for LPs. Integrating GLVs into the existing earn interface will provide a unified approach to liquidity provision, enhanced capital efficiency and the improved liquidity profile will improve the trading experience for users.\n\nThis proposal aims to streamline the LP experience, optimise liquidity deployment, and boost overall platform performance. It outlines the necessary steps for implementation and seeks approval from the DAO to move forward with the integration of GLV into the GMX protocol.",

      "title": "Buyback GMX and Distribute GMX",
      "content": "Last week, we had a proposal suggesting a change in GMX’s current revenue distribution model from “Buyback ETH and Distribute ETH” to “Buyback GMX and Distribute GMX.” This change aims to leverage the advantages of “buyback,” enhance GMX’s long-term value retention ability, and optimize user experience and protocol strategic flexibility while minimizing model changes and fully preserving the “real yield” advantages. \n\nThe specific implementation path will refer to Xdev's proposal: \n\n“For the buyback mechanism, I would like to propose the following process:\n\n- Fees are swapped to ETH or AVAX, using GMX V1 / V2 swaps as it is currently.\n- The portion of ETH / AVAX allocated for buyback is deposited into a Buyback contract.\n- The Buyback contract will allocate 1/7 of the deposited ETH / AVAX to buy GMX every day for 7 days.\n- The Buyback price will be based on the GMX Chainlink oracle price (available on Arbitrum and Avalanche).\n- There will be a premium to buyback the GMX, which gradually increases from 0% to 5% over the week.\n- An example of the interval value can be 1 hour, which would split the purchases into 168 buys over 7 days. If the size of a purchase per interval is greater than, e.g., 20k USD, the interval may be decreased for smaller but more frequent buys.\n\nThis is to reduce the risk of front-running/price manipulation from a single purchase. The GMX bought back can then be distributed in the following week. With this format, it also means that during the transition from rewards in ETH / AVAX to rewards in GMX, there will be one week where GMX tokens are being bought back and there are no tokens to distribute. For this week, GMX matching the estimated buyback amount could be minted for distribution, or if this one week gap is fine, then this mint may not be needed.”\n\nXdev has considered the issue of accumulated fees not being distributed in the first week. The fees are actually accumulated, and to keep the technical implementation as simple as possible and avoid the need to mint any additional GMX, this vote assumes that there will be no reward distribution in the first week. This approach ensures a smooth transition of the system. In summary, if the proposal passes, Xdev's proposed implementation aims to provide the optimal path for choosing to receive GMX or ETH/AVAX.\n\nWe will now vote on this proposal. Below are the explanations for the options (using Arbitrum as an example):\n\n1. “Buyback ETH and Distribute ETH.” Fees are stored in ETH and then distributed as ETH, retaining the current model.\n2. “Buyback ETH and Distribute ETH” and implement the option to “Convert ETH to GMX.” Fees are stored in ETH and then distributed as ETH, retaining the current model, but adding an option for users to convert ETH directly to GMX.\n3. “Buyback GMX and Distribute GMX” and implement the option to “Convert GMX to ETH.” Fees are stored in GMX and then distributed as GMX, reforming the current model, but adding an option for users to convert GMX directly to ETH.\n\nFor reference, here are the opinions from GMX Delegates and partners:\nGMX Delegate Tano - https://gov.gmx.io/t/gmx-transition-from-buyback-eth-and-distribute-eth-to-buyback-gmx-and-distribute-gmx/3693/24\nGMX Delegate SniperMonke - https://gov.gmx.io/t/gmx-transition-from-buyback-eth-and-distribute-eth-to-buyback-gmx-and-distribute-gmx/3693/37\nGMX Delegate Shogun - https://gov.gmx.io/t/gmx-transition-from-buyback-eth-and-distribute-eth-to-buyback-gmx-and-distribute-gmx/3693/38\nGMX Delegate XM and GBC - Option 3 - https://gov.gmx.io/t/gmx-transition-from-buyback-eth-and-distribute-eth-to-buyback-gmx-and-distribute-gmx/3693/39\nVaultka - https://gov.gmx.io/t/gmx-transition-from-buyback-eth-and-distribute-eth-to-buyback-gmx-and-distribute-gmx/3693/40\nD2 Finance - https://gov.gmx.io/t/gmx-transition-from-buyback-eth-and-distribute-eth-to-buyback-gmx-and-distribute-gmx/3693/41",

This has the potential to provide liquidity providers and traders with greater flexibility on utilizing alternative collaterals including those that generate additional yield.\n\nWorking with the largest LRT (Lido) and largest yield generating stablecoin protocol (Ethena) provide significant scale to experiment with new markets while also introducing their sizeable communities to GMX\n\nThe first asset backing this pool will be wstETH relying on a Datastreams oracle feed for stETH with a multiplier for the wstETH-stETH conversion factor, it also means that LPs and traders utilizing wstETH as collateral will earn an additonal passive yield.\n\nThe second asset backing this pool will be USDe relying on a Datastreams oracle feed, that leverages both CEX and low latency DEX liquidity for Oracle pricing.  Liquidity Providers will earn points under the Ethena SATS program for their USDe exposure in this market.\n\nEfforts will be made to ensure that cross marketing happens between all partners to build visibility for these new markets to traders and liquidity providers in each community.\n\nIncentives and yield provided by Lido and/or Ethena are not guaranteed and are subject to change without prior notice.\n\nChaos Labs Risk Report\nhttps://gov.gmx.io/t/new-asset-listing-wsteth-usde/3663",

      "title": "Updating Maximum Leverage / Minimum Collateral",
      "content": "There have been recurrent requests from community members to allow higher leverage on the GMX protocol. The contributing developers, risk committee, and security partners have evaluated this possibility, and concluded that it is feasible. \n\nThe risk committee was earlier delegated the ability to evaluate and update various parameters to support the proper functioning of markets on GMX V2.  (https://snapshot.org/#/gmx.eth/proposal/0x4bb2ac5546101e39ea0a0a11a689e967c8720814e5ca804d112bd55cc4072d0c and https://snapshot.org/#/gmx.eth/proposal/0xe5631173e5f81906e0497b6fe209ef2c72b4b8d882a0250ce0feeafb8278fb72) \n\nOn GMX (v1) well before the formation of the risk committee, there was a governance vote to increase leverage to 50x. \n\nAccordingly, to avoid confusion and out of abundant caution, the following ratification/rejection and guidance on future updates to a parameter that has the practical effect of increasing maximum permissible leverage are sought:\n\nUpdating the minCollateralFactor adjusts the minimum collateral before positions are liquidated. This simultaneously has the effect of increasing or decreasing the maximum possible leverage on the GMX V2 contracts for that market.  \n\nTo date, the reference front-end design linked at app.gmx.io has limited opening leverage to 50x, and no market has supported more than a theoretical 100x maximum leverage directly on the contracts.\n\nThe updated risk recommendations for minCollateralFactor allow for materially higher leverage with an intention to enable contract level leverage up to 200x on certain markets; specifically, gmBTC, gmBTC+, gmETH, and gmETH+, due in part to their deep liquid reference markets. (Note: gmBTC+ and gmETH+ refer to the recently launched Single-Asset Markets for BTC and ETH)\n\nChaos Labs’ updated recommendations:\nhttps://www.notion.so/chaos-labs/EXT-minCollateralFactorForOpenInterestMultiplier-Recommendation-20240509-f72f9be80f554188ad8a9cdab9b8134f\n\n———————————\n\nThis proposal consists of two questions. The proposal seeks (1) confirmation from the community that this parameter should be updated beyond the current, and (2) re-ratifying that updates affecting collateral and leverage are also delegated to the risk committee in a manner consistent with other parameters.\n\nPlease allocate your voting power between both questions. For each question, the option that gets the most votes will be considered ratified. \n\nQuestion 1) ratify or reject the implementation of updated risk parameters:\n- Confirm change to min collateral, allowing higher leverage\n- Reject change to min collateral\n\nQuestion 2) who determines updates to parameters affecting max leverage in the future:\n- Future updates by Risk Committee\n- Future updates by Governance",

      "content": "Solv Protocol is a native yield platform that leverages decentralized asset management infrastructure to tokenize and aggregate high-quality yields from various sources within the industry. As a unified liquidity gateway, Solv, with its core assets such as SolvBTC, SolvUSD, and SolvETH, serves as a crucial layer for liquidity allocation across ecosystems.\n\nIn a recent milestone, SolvBTC, the first yield-bearing BTC asset in the market introduced by Solv, made its debut on Arbitrum. This launch addresses the significant gap in the Bitcoin ecosystem by providing a native yield solution. SolvBTC, in collaboration with Arbitrum, fosters an inclusive and efficient BTCFi ecosystem, offering Bitcoin holders unprecedented opportunities for growth and participation.\n\nSolv has won the support from key players like Binance Labs, Blockchain Capital, Jump, Nomura, UOB, Mirana, gumi, Spartan and many more. It has forged connections with over 60 fund managers and 40 investment institutions with $123,905,951 in TVL across 25 vaults and is live on Arbitrum, Mantle, Ethereum and BNB Chain.\n\nProposal:\n\nWe propose a token swap of ($100,000 or $200,000) as outlined below.\n\nSwap Terms:\n(1) Token swap of esGMX for future vested Solv tokens\n(2) The value of esGMX will be taken as the 30-day average price of GMX in the 30 days prior to the approval of the governance proposal, using daily closes on Coingecko.\n(3) If the proposal passes, The swap terms will be executed at a valuation of $80 million for Solv tokens, aligning with the valuation established during the preceding fundraising round, as a show of good-will between Solv Protocol and GMX communities, and to demonstrate intentions to cultivate productive and long term collaboration.\n\nVesting / Lockups:\nSolv and GMX intend to hold the tokens received from the swaps indefinitely, with them deployed in accordance with this proposal. After two (2) years, if there has been a material change in the tokenomics or intended utility of the tokens that result in the protocols being unable to use them as had been planned, the protocols may mutually review and come to governance to seek equitable adjustments.\n\nThe Solv tokens will go through a 1 year lock up followed by 2 years vesting starting from token generation event (TGE)\n\nAction:\n\nAn OTC swap of between the GMX and Solv treasuries in the dollar amount of $100,000 or $200,000.\n\nIf approved, the swap will be conducted on the valuation for Solv and esGMX tokens as outlined in the aforementioned Swap Terms",

Ranked-choice voting empowers governance to determine relative support between one, both, or neither of the proposed solutions.\n\nThe result of this vote will be the single highest voted option, at the end of the ranked choice process.

With both the migration window and subsequent migrations at total of 5,745,462 GMX tokens have been utilized for this purpose.\n\nIt is proposed that the migration window for XVIX and Gambit now be closed on the successful completion of a 7 day snapshot vote. Having supported the migration for over two years and an over 95% conversion rate, the goals set out have clearly been completed.\n\nEnding migrations will also mean less technical and administrative overhead as the work continues to harden GMX governance with greater token holder taking on more direct control over the process, rather than utilizing delegation to contributors and admins to perform such activities for them.\n\nAll remaining tokens from the XVIX / Gambit Migration that are unutilized will return to the GMX treasury and are available for allocation as governance determines.\n\nThis proposal has no prior technical dependancies and can be implemented with immediate effect.\n\nDISCLAIMER\nSee  linked proposal",

In cases of especially contentious proposals, GMX should express our concerns through governance forums and voting notes.\n- Suggest that delegates seek feedback from the governance community when appropriate, but ultimately the DAO trust them with the responsibility to exercise their judgment.\n\nTally Link:\n\nhttps://www.tally.xyz/profile/0xf92f185abd9e00f56cb11b0b709029633d1e37b4?governanceId=eip155:42161:0xf07DeD9dC292157749B6Fd268E37DF6EA38395B9",

      "content": "When GMX was formed, the community established a distribution that included an allocation of 250,000 tokens to contributors over the first two years reflecting ~1.9% of the total token supply of GMX tokens. These tokens were distributed linearly over that period.\n\n### Milestones\n\nDuring that period, GMX has crossed numerous significant milestones:\n\n+ successful deployment to Ethereum L2, Arbitrum One\n+ formalizing community governance including discussion forums, snapshot voting, implementation of multi-sigs, and the use of Labs\n+ expanding the contributor base to support growth\n+ successful deployment to a second EVM chain, Avalanche, and securing a $4,000,000 grant for scaling activity there\n+ becoming the largest native DeFi protocol on Arbitrum measured by TVL, Volume, and on-chain activity\n+ continued iteration on the GMX V1 (GLP)\n+ removal of time to hold requirements on position close\n+ development and deployment of hybrid oracles for low latency pricing\n+ two transaction methods, significantly reducing Oracle extractable value\n+ on-chain referral and trader rebates\n+ dynamic open interest caps to limit open interest skew\n+ multiple safety, security, and stability updates to ensure the health of the protocol\n+ marketing and messaging that has maintained through contributors and community an active presence for GMX in discussions of leading protocols, thought leaders, and preferred development partner\n+ establish key relationships across the Arbitrum, Avalanche, and DeFi ecosystems, making GMX trading, referrals, and GLP, an integral protocol for users and other protocols/DAOs\n\n### GMX V2\n\nDevelopment and beta release of GMX V2 which has developed out of the strategic guidance of the community on formulating protocol development (X4: Protocol-Controlled Exchange - GMX News 2) under a BSL license (Snapshot 11) for the benefit of the GMX DAO.\n\n+ a code base developed over the last year\n+ jointly contributing to the development and the launch partner of a new flagship low latency Oracle by industry leader Chainlink, creating greater decentralization and economic security for the protocol\n+ $2,000,000 committed/funded for third-party expenditure towards risk and safety including\n+ audits during design and development conducted by four distinct firms: ABDK, DeDaub, Guardian, and Sherlock.\n+ ongoing advanced formal verification by the Certora Prover (https://www.certora.com/ 3)\n+ economic risk analysis by Chaos Labs in the design and deployment\ncontributor firms brought on board for threat detection, incident response, and web2/3 penetration testing to support post-launch\n\n### Utilization of Tokens\n\nContributor tokens have helped to secure the commitment of contributors supporting the development of the protocols under the GMX banner despite limited funds (in stables and ETH) in the treasury when the community formed the DAO.\n\nCompared to many protocols and DAOs that have kept a large token supply for their contributors, founders, and teams the approach at our inception and ever since was very different including having no founders or teams but instead the community self-governing and bringing in contributors from that community with a limited initial runway to help grow this decentralized organization and the protocols under it. It was about leveraging this diverse group of community, contributors, and partners growing GMX.\n\nOver the last two years, tokens and fees have been directed towards supporting all participants:\n\n+ 1.46 million tokens for the community (GMX staking rewards) + 30% of protocol fees\n+ 1.40 million tokens liquidity incentives (GLP staking rewards) + 70% of protocol fees\n+ 0.25 million tokens on development, marketing & security (bonding, swaps, referrals)\n+ 0.25 million tokens to contributors\n\n### What is being asked for?\n\n+ “Labs” (Snapshot 11) is seeking support for an allocation of 250k GMX over the next two years from the ~0.75 million tokens remaining in the integration incentives and community developers allocation of the tokenomics and overall ~2.00 million available in the treasury towards Contributor Tokens. Such amounts drawn in the same manner as the original two-year allocation\n+ There is no proposed change to the hard cap which remains 13.25 million GMX\nthese distributions to Labs remain subject to governance, with future distributions terminatable if governance determines that such payments no longer support their requirements\n+ Labs commit to an orderly handover to other contributors, and community members if so desired by governance, if such an arrangement does not continue at any time.\n+ coinciding with the two-year mark and the launch of V2, a treasury growth plan (Snapshot ) was passed, there is a possibility that over time as this becomes a more stable source of funding that this be considered to partially or fully fund contributions to the protocol.\n\n### What does GMX gain?\n\n+ the contributors have never maintained a roadmap for the protocol, instead taking guidance and where possible providing support for tasks identified as priorities; contributors and Labs intend to continue to try to support such priorities including those related to V2\n+ Labs will continue to present ideas of interest to governance and continue to coordinate technical contributors in relation to the upkeep, development, and good functioning of the existing protocol\n+ this commitment of contributor tokens over the next two years will allow Labs the stability to secure and retain long-term contributors who have provided meaningful contributions to the growth of GMX",

(https://gov.gmx.io/t/gmx-v2-sustainable-development/2049/14) \n\n### Key Considerations\n- These new Oracles were built with input from GMX core contributors to create data feeds that could support the more robust market structures of GMX V2.\n- This proposal brings a key infrastructure solution and development partner to help GMX with its critical Oracle-related needs. It directly aligns Chainlink with GMXs requirements for low-latency data feeds on specific assets, market parameters, and coverage on new chains required to fuel our growth.\n- Protocol fees include the fees paid by users, currently proposed to be position open/close fees (\"margin trading\"), borrow fees, swap fees, and any other fees that the GMX Treasury subsequently retains a portion of from the protocol.\n- Chainlink Labs has shown a commitment, having already built and deployed the MVP of these Oracles on Arbitrum testnet\n- Any material change to the economic terms or permanent discontinuation of this understanding will come to governance.",

      "content": "\n### PROPOSAL SUMMARY\n\n- Update the gmx-interface codebase to work with the next GMX V2 open-source contracts developed by Labs (https://github.com/gmx-io/gmx-synthetics/blob/main/README.md), \n- Establishing initial parameters for fees and ranges within these V2 Markets.\n- Establsh a risk committee in the 90 days after mainnet deployment to support all GMX markets\n\n### UPDATE GMX-INTERFACE WITH V2 CONTRACTS\n\n- Confirm support for Labs integrating the current GMX V2 contracts, as well as any future versions of these, into the gmx-interface codebase found at https://github.com/gmx-io/gmx-interface.\n- The protocol will benefit from a diversity of front ends utilizing the V2 codebase as a base but potentially include customization, improvements, and regionalization for various communities.\n- This proposal does not establish the Front End Fee which will be separately brought for discussion and voting.\n\n### NEW MARKET FEE SETTINGS\n\nBelow are the proposed range and initial fees for testing; a final range should be confirmed by governance closer to full deployment:\n\nIncrease / Decrease Position:\n- Approved Range: 0.00% - 0.10% of trade size.\n- Initial Paramater: 0.05% of trade size.\n\nPrice Impact:\n- Approved Range: Adjusted based on liquidity on reference exchanges.\n\nSwap Fees:\n- Approved Range: 0.00% - 0.50% on crypto assets and 0.00% - 0.50% on stableswaps.\n- Initial Paramaters: 0.05% on crypto assets and 0.01% on stableswaps.\n\nFunding Fee\n- Approved Range: Based on the difference between long and short open interest for a market and a multiplier value.\n\nBorrow Fee\n- Approved Range: Based on the utilization percentage of the pool and a multiplier value. Borrow Fee help mitigate attacks with a trader or competitor consuming both long and short capacity at low net cost.\n\nMultiplier Value\n- Approved Range: Funding and Borrow Fee have multiplier values that need to be configured such that they don’t overly reduce the effect of positive funding fees but are a sufficient incentive to minimize OI imbalance. Over time Funding fees may start to approximate levels for existing centralized exchanges.\n\nGMX V2 contracts combine a proposed lower swap fee with the implementation of price impact (both positive and negative) along with oracles that aggregate best bid and best ask pricing from the reference exchanges. This setup is aimed to ensure deep liquidity is secured with liquidity providers having a less volatile exposure, as net OI will be more effectively balanced through economic incentives when a large directional exposure occurs. More details on the price impact calculation: https://github.com/gmx-io/gmx-synthetics#price-impact \n\nIn GMX V2, swaps are now a two-step process similar to increase/decrease position transactions. This setup greatly reduces toxic flow (as was seen when GMX moved to two-step transactions) and should allow lower fees, which combined with price impact, will create efficient markets without running into front-running issues. This would make it convenient for traders to swap in and out of different collateral when increasing or decreasing positions. The lowered swap fee may also help make the protocol a preferred platform for swaps once aggregators can integrate this novel approach (discussions are already ongoing).\n",

The proposal does not change the share of overall fees distributable over time to GLP which remains at 70% of fees.\n\nBased on community feedback two versions of YSR are being proposed for consideration.  The first involves a fixed 20% APR hurdle for capturing and distributing a portion of the YSR to stabilize fee distribution and the second has a dynamic rate initially set at 20% for the first month and subsequently based on the lower of the average natural fee earnings in the prior month or 20% APR.\n\nYou will have the option to vote for either proposal or Against.  If the two YSR proposals collectively receive over 50% support the one with more votes will be implemented, if Against gain over 50% support, the existing system will remain unchanged.\n\nThis proposal is for immediate effect on the conclusion of the vote.",

The esGMX from the trade will be permanently locked, with the proceeds from staking esGMX used to fund grant programs to build vaults or structured products leveraging GMX & GammaSwap, driving more fees to both platforms\n\nForum Discussion\nPlease see the posted proposal and clarifications https://gov.gmx.io/t/gmx-gammaswap-proposal/1549 and you can read and participate in formulating GMX’s Ecosystem Partnership strategy which these swaps are guided by at gov.gmx.io/t/partnerships/743\nThese swaps are intended to support protocols building on GMX through sustainable yield generated from GMX/esGMX and not the selling of the principal from the swap.\n\nKey Considerations\n•\tThe GS token is not currently listed, GMX will receive 1% of the 16M total token supply of GS, in exchange for the $100,000 esGMX at a $10M FDV.  Price of GMX tokens will be established using the 30-day trailing price at the time of the acceptance of this proposal by governance.\n•\tAs part of the partnership Gammaswap is committed to developing products including Synthetic calls & puts utilizing GMX liquidity, and the development of hedged IL vaults for GMX/ETH LPs on uni v3 and other dexes. \n•\tThe swap is contingent on the successful audit of the GammaSwap platform by Halborn and integration into UniswapV3.\n•\tGammaswap and GMX intend to hold the tokens received from the swaps indefinitely, with them deployed in accordance with this proposal. After two (2) years, if there has been a material change in the tokenomics or intended utility of the tokens that result in the protocols being unable to use them as had been planned, the protocols may mutually review and come to governance to seek equitable adjustments.\n",

The GMX from the trade will be permanently deposited into Pirex as pxGMX and will be used to bootstrap the pxGMX/ETH LP.\n\nForum Discussion\nPlease see the posted proposal and clarifications at  https://gov.gmx.io/t/gmx-redacted-partnership/1147 and you can read and participate in formulating GMX’s Ecosystem Partnership strategy which these swaps are guided by at gov.gmx.io/t/partnerships/743 \n\nThese swaps are intended to support protocols building on GMX through sustainable yield generated from GMX/esGMX and not the selling of the principal from the swap.\n\nKey Considerations\n- GMX and esGMX deposits into pxGMX are a one-way process, GMX and esGMX will never be unstaked, and esGMX will never be vested. Multiplier points accrue and ETH rewards from multiplier points are shared pro-rata by pxGMX holders. pxGMX and pxGLP are intended to allow for greater composability for GMX and GLP in DeFi. \n- Redacted is completing an audit of their pxGMX and pxGLP strategy which is ready to deploy. Swap transfers will be completed after the completion of the audit\n⁃ If approved the swap will be executed using the 30-day trailing average daily closing price of GMX and BTRFLY on Coingecko at the time this proposal passes.\n- Redacted and GMX intend to hold the tokens received from the swaps indefinitely, with them deployed in accordance with this proposal. After two (2) years, if there has been a material change in the tokenomics or intended utility of the tokens that result in the protocols being unable to use them as had been planned, the protocols may mutually review and come to governance to seek equitable adjustments.\n- As part of the GMX and Redacted partnership and the treasury swap, two GMX core contributors and two Redacted core contributors will be on the three of four pxGMX multi-sig. This will, among other things, help ensure that the GMX from the treasury swap is not sold prematurely\n",

      "title": "GMX <> YieldYak Collaboration",
      "content": "Why are we proposing a treasury swap?\n\nThe Yield Yak team has been the leading native yield and swap aggregator for the Avalanche ecosystem since its inception. We have worked with GLP since it deployed on Avalanche, developing both GMX and GLP Vaults on Avalanche. Moreover, Yak Swap was the first aggregator to incorporate GMX.\n\nThis treasury swap is designed to better align the two protocols, specifically Yield Yak’s GLP vault and our future GMX integrations that will help expand the GMX ecosystem.\n\nWhat has Yield Yak contributed to the GMX Ecosystem, and why should GMX holders support this proposal?\n\nYield Yak is a yield-optimizer and DEX aggregator native to Avalanche; they have been strong supporters of the GMX ecosystem since the beginning.\n\nDEX Aggregator:\n\nYak Swap was the first aggregator to integrate GMX into its trade routing. As a result, Yak Swap has routed $300,000,000 in volume to GMX, all while collecting zero fees itself in the process.\n\nGLP Vault:\n\nYield Yak’s GLP vault was the first vault built on top of GLP, and the first to take the approach of auto-staking esGMX in perpetuity to boost rewards for all vault participants. Currently, with ~$800K TVL, it has the lowest fee structure of products built on GLP, with a fee applied only to yield and no entry/exit fees. Their displayed APY is net of fees.\n\nThe vault has also been integrated across the Avalanche Ecosystem; as collateral on Moremoney and Arable Finance, and with an integration underway with DeltaPrime.\n\nThe vault has been running for over 9 months and has recently undergone an extensive audit by CoinFabrik. The recent audit was performed to better support third-party integration of the GLP Vault with DeFi partners on Avalanche.\n\nGLP Adapter:\n\nYield Yak is building a novel upgrade to Yak Swap, which benefits the GMX ecosystem by optimizing trade routing to GLP: it’ll route trades to the most under-balanced assets if slippage is less than fees. This feature will allow GLP mint and redeem to better align these actions with the rebalancing of the GLP pool towards its target index weights, and provide liquidity providers with better overall price execution.\n\nThe GLP adapter will be available on Yak Swap, pending the upcoming update to GLP 4 to remove the 15-minute cooldown period. The adapter can be integrated into any front-end (including GMX.io), and will be available to any protocols that integrate GLP. This will be especially useful for those building delta-neutral vaults, as they tend to deposit and withdraw only in stables.\n\nGLP Vault & Adapter\n\nThese two building blocks combine to create a near-frictionless integration for GLP within the DeFi ecosystem on Avalanche. This enables fluid, efficient integrations, and Yield Yak can potentially expand its offerings to other chains to support GMX.\n\nWhat will Yield Yak do with esGMX?\n\nThe esGMX will be locked into and increase Yield Yak’s GLP Vault’s staked esGMX balance on Avalanche, resulting in a boosted APR to stakers from this investment. In the event that Yield Yak launches vaults on other chains, including Arbitrum, GMX will assist Yield Yak with in potentially bridging esGMX on a one-off basis to support additional vaults.\n\nWhat will GMX do with YAK?\n\nGMX DAO’s received YAK will be staked, earning a pro-rata share of 70% of Yield Yak’s platform fees, which are automatically distributed daily in AVAX rewards. GMX will stake their YAK to earn these AVAX fees, for a minimum of two years. In the event that YAK moves to multi-chain YAK staking, it will assist GMX with bridging YAK if desired.\n\nHow can we price the YAK and esGMX?\n\nPricing of both YAK and esGMX would use the 30-day trailing average price for GMX and YAK, taken from Coingecko at the time of approval of this governance proposal.\n\nLockup / Vesting\n\nYield Yak and GMX intend to hold the tokens received from the swaps indefinitely, with them deployed in accordance with the principle of this proposal. The swap is intended to support protocols building on GMX through sustainable yield generated from esGMX and not the selling of the principal from the swap as the esGMX are not vestable.\n\nAfter two (2) years, if there has been a material change in the tokenomics or intended utility of the tokens that result in the protocols being unable to use them as had been planned, the protocols may mutually review and come to governance to seek equitable adjustments\n\nAction\n\nIf this proposal passes, the GMX DAO will:\n\nTransfer up to $100k of esGMX to the Yield Yak GLP vault on Avalanche and an additional chain, in two tranches of $60k on Approval of this proposal and $40k at the time of deploying on a second agreed chain.\n\nReceive an equivalent value of YAK tokens staked on Yield Yak.\nThese tokens are intended to be permanently staked by Yield Yak and GMX to accrue yield and governance rights.",

Any additional esGMX being earned is compounded and 100% of the ETH yield is distributed to those in the vault, boosting returns.\n- esGMX and RAGE tokens swapped will be locked and staked for a minimum of two years by each protocol ensuring longer-term alignment and removing the potential of sell pressure\n- The value of esGMX will be taken as the 30-day average price of GMX in the 30 days prior to the approval of the governance proposal using daily closes on coingecko.\n- The value of RAGE will be based on its most recent valuation ($40m FDV), which included investments from investors such as Dopex DAO, Primitive Ventures (Dovey Wan), Dialectic, Genesis Block Ventures, and BizYugo (#1 on DeBank + #2 on DegenScore).\n",

      "content": "In order to further solidify the collaboration between GMX and Plutus while enabling the Plutus GLP vault to receive maximal yield, we propose a $200k token swap between the teams’ treasuries.\n\nSpecifically, we are proposing to swap $200k worth of esGMX tokens for $200k worth of locked PLS tokens. The amount of tokens received will be based on a 30-day trailing average of both tokens’ prices at the time that the governance proposal passes. Pricing will be used using the daily rate from coingecko.\n\nPlutus and GMX will stake their respective initial positions for a period of not less than [2] years but may utilize their yield including in native tokens (esGMX / PLS) as required by their protocol.\n\nThe esGMX tokens that Plutus receives will therefore never enter circulation and their yield will be used solely to incentivize the products that Plutus builds on top of GLP and potentially GMX. Similarly, the PLS tokens can be staked by the GMX team to earn yield and later down the line bribes as well, providing a future source of yield and diversification for the GMX treasury. The size of the swap was determined to be small enough to not significantly affect the treasuries of either protocol or introduce unnecessary risk, while still bringing significant benefits to the users of Plutus’ GLP vault product.\n\nEffectively the main objective of the treasury swap is to benefit the end users of the product, which are current GLP stakers. While Plutus’ GLP product can thrive without a treasury swap, it would significantly increase yield for plvGLP stakers due to the emissions from the permanently locked and compounded esGMX while signaling the beginning of a mutually beneficial relationship between GMX and Plutus.\n\nAction:\n\nComplete an OTC treasury swap between the GMX and Plutus treasuries for $200k worth of locked esGMX for $200k worth of locked PLS tokens.",

      "content": "To continue to acquire and onboard users a trading competition is being planned. \n\nIt is difficult to anticipate the demand from the competition, but liquidity should ideally scale so that it does not become a bottle-neck and allows for a good trading experience for new users.\n\nAt the time of this proposal, ~86% of ETH and 60% of WBTC in the liquidity pool is currently reserved for long positions, so there is definitely room to grow the liquidity pool to accommodate more traders.\n\nIncreasing liquidity should allow for larger trade, larger volumes and a larger amount of fees generated.\n\nOn the other hand, if liquidity is not appropriately scaled, then traders will not be able to open positions after a certain point and the competition may not be effective in acquiring new users.\n\nTwo main options to increase liquidity:\n1. Have a bonus of 20,000 esGMX tokens distributed to staked GLP for the month of November\n2. Adjust fee distributions to increase APRs for staked GLP, this would be effective until a new proposal is passed\n\nOption (1) has not had much resistance, so to keep things simple the voting will be for option (2).\n\nVoting power is based on staked GMX, staked esGMX and staked Multiplier Points, each staked token contributes to 1 voting power.\n\nFor simplicity, staked tokens that are reserved for vesting are not counted towards voting power for this proposal but can be included for future proposals.\n\nFPF stands for Floor Price Fund.\n\nRegardless of the option chosen, fees from the GMX-ETH Uniswap liquidity pool will continue to accumulate in the Floor Price Fund.\n\nYou can spread your voting points across multiple options.",

Have the prizes be in GMX, the amount of GMX will be calculated based on the price of GMX at the time of the prize distribution\n2. Have the prizes be in USDC, borrowing from the Floor Price Fund and sell GMX bonds to repay the  Floor Price Fund later on\n3. Have the prizes be in USDC by selling GMX from the marketing fund to the Uniswap liquidity pool\n\nFor (1), it will probably be safer to set a minimum reference GMX price that will be used, e.g. $30, so in the unlikely event that the price of GMX decreases because of the trading competition or otherwise, the amount of GMX distributed for prizes will be capped.\n\nVoting power is based on staked GMX, staked esGMX and staked Multiplier Points, each staked token contributes to 1 voting power.\n\nFor simplicity, staked tokens that are reserved for vesting are not counted towards voting power for this proposal but can be included for future proposals.\n\nYou can spread your voting points across multiple options.",
