Quorum is required for an individual BFC member's proposal to pass.\n\n**Voting choices (For)**\n\n* Extend Rex's term\n\n## Proposal\n\nAccording to Beanstalk Farms governance, at least 3 BFC members must approve any spending of the Beanstalk Farms budget. BFC members have term lengths—currently, Rex and mod323's terms end at the end of September 2024 and guy and sweetredbeans' terms end at the end of December 2024.\n\nTherefore, in order to continue facilitating an efficient use of the remaining Beanstalk Farms budget, BFCP-C-5 is proposed.\n\nCurrently, Rex is the only BFC member that is paid by Beanstalk Farms (in accordance with [BFCP-A-16](https://arweave.net/HhOwYuvz2a3cWt-_KQjf6sWMaD8qZpzRJmL-fw5O3qs)).

      "title": "Temp-Check-5: L2 Migration",
      "content": "## Proposer\n\nBrean\n\n## Summary\n\nVote to signal support For or Against any potential form of migrating Beanstalk to an Ethereum L2.\n\nThis proposal is **not** to signal support For or Against **any particular L2**—it's to better understand the DAO's appetite for migrating to an L2 in the first place.\n\n## Process Note\n\nThis temperature check proposal is intended for the DAO to express a preference in advance of a future BIP. There is no quorum for this proposal given that the goal is to simply gather information and feedback. Stalkholders are still strongly encouraged to participate in order for the outcome of the vote to be as representative as possible. The vote will last 7 days.\n\n## Problem\n\nBeanstalk is a fairly gaseous protocol. While the costs of interacting with Beanstalk at the time of writing in May 2024 are reasonable, activity on Ethereum L1 is currently low. In the past when Gwei has reached mid to high double digit values, interacting with Beanstalk (such as Mowing, Planting, or Converting) have cost upwards of several hundred US dollars. This prices out smaller Farmers and reduces the efficacy of Beanstalk's peg maintenance mechanisms. \n\nWhile Ethereum L1 remains one of the most trustless and censorship resistant networks to deploy smart contracts on, the roadmaps for various Ethereum L2s are becoming more fully featured and focused on decentralization (including decentralization of fraud proof submitters, the permissionless ability to exit the L2 at any time, etc.).\n\nThrough governance, Beanstalk has gone through many upgrades. These series of upgrades has generally increased the average gas per interaction in Beanstalk (Silo V3 requires a user to Mow on a per token basis, getting manipulation resistant data costs more than non manipulation resistant data, adding new Wells to the Deposit/Minting Whitelist increases the cost to call `gm`). While trustlessness and censorship resistance are axes that the Beanstalk DAO should evaluate when choosing a chain, the cost per interaction is a metric that has historically been put on the back burner.\n\nEven when the Beanstalk development community more heavily prioritized lowering gas costs (which has now shifted in favor of [prioritizing security](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/issues/729)), most of the cost of interacting with Beanstalk on Ethereum L1 was (and continues to be) unavoidable. If there's interest from the DAO in pursuing migrating Beanstalk to an L2, it's best to do it proactively before gas costs become prohibitive for everyday participants.\n\nThe high cost of development on L1 is often prohibitive in the implementation of Beanstalk. Many of the ideas proposed in the Beanstalk community would require significant changes in the Beanstalk state. The Beanstalk community should be able to freely discuss ideas without the need to consider the execution cost so significantly.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nMigrate the Beanstalk peg mechanism and Beanstalk state to an Ethereum L2. [L2BEAT](https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary) is a great resource to see the different stages of development and decentralization that various Ethereum L2s are in.\n\nIf Beans are simply bridged to L2s, access the Silo, Field, and Barn would still take place on L1 and peg maintenance would be unaffected. Thus, migrating the system entirely is preferred.\n\nAt a high level, the process would look something like the following (upon a L2 migration BIP passing):\n* Pause L1 Beanstalk;\n* Transfer Deposited LP tokens to the L1 BCM;\n* Withdraw liquidity and send the non-Bean assets to the L2 BCM;\n* Deploy a new Beanstalk on the desired L2 in a state that does not yet allow any interaction;\n    * Includes deploying all necessary facets, initializing the Whitelisted assets, deploying Basin/Pipeline/Depot, etc.;\n* Execute a series of transactions from the L2 BCM that copy the L1 Beanstalk state onto L2 Beanstalk;\n* Seed liquidity from the L2 BCM and send the LP tokens to L2 Beanstalk; and\n* Unpause L2 Beanstalk.\n\nThere would need to be more decisions made by the DAO to determine things like:\n* How to handle the 3CRV from the deposited BEAN3CRV (some L2s don't have 3CRV);\n* How to handle Farm Balances (particularly tokens that don't have an L2 equivalent);\n* How to handle migrating smart contract balances (given there's no guarantee of owning the same address on L2); and\n* Additional Wells to whitelist at the time of L2 migration (and initial parameters for each Well).\n\n## Voting Choices\n\nVoting For is to express interest in exploring some form of migrating Beanstalk peg mechanism and state to an Ethereum L2. Voting Against is to express interest against doing so.\n\n* For\n* Against",

There is no quorum for this proposal given that the goal is to simply gather information and feedback. Stalkholders are still strongly encouraged to participate in order for the outcome of the vote to be as representative as possible. The vote will last 7 days.\n\n## Problem\n\nGiven the lack of participation in the Field over the previous year it is evident that the excess debt as a result of (1) the inefficiencies in the model prior to the exploit (*i.e.*, BIPs [6](https://arweave.net/31Mo38aJmBIMxH47fS3YKOK97wuHxrbsev7x7lUBDfc), [7](https://arweave.net/ixYmHgocGz9idIlswTqvbZAjWh8OibGL--D1mgojlwg), [9](https://arweave.net/bvq3Hyql5eBesBZGSy5GGdiz0bkkk2dxXIpcO2MiusM), etc.) and (2) the exploit itself (*i.e.*, the Barn Raise) has put Beanstalk in a difficult position (very low on the [bowl in the leafblower analogy](https://arweave.net/uNJrUD3bxDOlpZZrQXvvvjFP2T7msIIHsbR3xuBUkJA)).\n\n![image](https://arweave.net/9fP6tzxciGCwUyE29IpREUgI-3sT99G0Se5edSmeUig)\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nRestructure Beanstalk's existing debt such that a new Pod Line is reprioritized above old Beanstalk debt (the old Pod Line and Fertilizer). \n\nMore specifically:\n\n* Create a new Pod Line that is initialized with 0 Pods and a Maximum Temperature of 1%;\n* Discontinue issuance of Soil and Pods in the old Pod Line; and\n* Allocate a higher portion of new Bean mints to the new Pod Line than old Beanstalk debt.\n\nSome examples of possible Bean mint distributions (% to Silo / % to new Pods / % to old Pods / % to Fertilizer) that favor new Pods (and new participants generally) include:\n* 40/40/10/10;\n* 50/50/0/0 until some higher Bean supply, such as 500M, at which point the distribution becomes 49/49/1/1, then at 600M it becomes 48/48/2/2, etc.;\n* etc.\n\nNaturally, the fewer Bean mints allocated to old Beanstalk debt, the more attractive new participation in Beanstalk would be in theory.\n\n## Voting Choices\n\nVoting For is to express interest exploring some form of debt restructuring. Voting Against is to express interest against doing so.\n\n* For\n* Against\n\n## Considerations\n\nThe most obvious consideration is that restructuring Beanstalk's debt should happen as infrequently as necessary, as doing so is compromises the original loan terms that Sowers opted into. The only time that the DAO has voted to restructure Beanstalk's debt in the past was at Replant (where the distribution of new Bean mints to the existing Pod Line changed from 50% to 33%). Any decision to do this again should not be taken lightly.\n\nThat said, a change like this would have the potential to significantly increase the incentive for participating in the Field again, which would have a significant effect on peg maintenance.",

      "content": "> \"To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.” — Barack Obama\n\nMost recently, the BFC has started banning members who are noting all the self-dealing and liquidity draining going on at the Farm.\n\nThe farm needs a more transparent group of BFC members to keep the community engaged. Currently all timelines and project updates are discussed behind closed doors. **UPDATE: Coincidentally, we did get some updates and discussion regarding the RFCs at the same time the team whipped up a new budget proposal.** It seems the only time the team wants to provide updates is when they want to extract value from the community.\n\nIn addition, several bot operators (some whom are in direct contact and affiliated with H2 2023 BFC members) have direct knowledge of development timelines and product development that help maximize their current stakes while keeping this information hidden from the broader farmer community to react and operate on the same playing field.\n\n### Proposer:\nBeanstalk Farmer (Per the BFC minions, explicit approval is needed. \"Harry Smiuff\" has given explicit approval through another farmer. \"Harry Smiuff\" can confirm on Discord assuming the insiders unban)\n\n### Summary:\nAdd \"Harry Smiuff\" to the BFC. \n\n### Quorum Note:\nQuorum is 25% of total outstanding Stalk participating in the vote.\n\n### Voting Choices:\n- Add \"Harry Smiuff\" to BFC\n- Don't Add \"Harry Smiuff\" to BFC\n\n### Background:\nThe Farm needs an outside independent member that is willing to communicate with the broader community. The H2 2023 BFC failed to engage with the community and have not been transparent with the current development timelines and audits.\n\n### Proposal:\nConsidering the H2 2023 BFC teams members are not actively engaged with the Beanstalk community and have no timelines, this BFCP is proposed to add a \"Harry Smiuff\" as a BFC member. He/him/they is an active member of the community and was recently banned for calling out all the self dealing on the Farm. \n\n### Rationale:\nThe term for H2 2023 members has expired and we need to add new members to BFC. Need a more transparent group of BFC members to keep the community engaged. Currently, all timelines and project updates are discussed behind closed doors.\n\n### Payment:\nHarry Smiuff has noted that he does not want any payment for his services. He understands that the existing liquidity is important to the rugged farmers and should not continue to get exploited by the devs or contributors who already been paid a substantial sum.",

Past roles have involved leading teams of frontline hourly employees, specialized individual contributors, and professional engineers. Prior to my energy experience, I was the founding director of a satellite campus of a small local college, managing staff and faculty while serving the needs of students.\n\nMy academic background is in history and political science and I also hold an MBA.\n\nAlong with being a long-time Farmer, in 2022 I held the role of Department Head for the Beanstalk Farms Community Team from February until after the exploit and hosted nearly 40 episodes of The Bean Pod and RadioDeFi podcasts. I also currently serve as a Stalk delegate and post updates on Discord on how I am voting. \n\n## Motivations\n\nI'm genuinely excited about the plans that Beanstalk Farms has for the rest of 2024. The projects outlined in [BIP-39](https://arweave.net/9DZrP_OJEDM_a-GH_8AFxTaiUz91ya8lK6KhELO5Ekc) are innovative and make Beanstalk more robust, interesting, and safe.\n\nHowever, it seems clear that the community is in interested in bringing back the DAO meetings in some form with increased communication about development and audit timelines - a role I am happy to help out with.\n\n## Role\n\nI will view my role as Community Lead to primarily:\n* Host monthly DAO meetings where contributors have an opportunity to share updates;\n* Answer questions in the Discord about expected development and audit timelines;\n* Communicate changes about those timelines;\n* Etc. \n\nI also expect there will be plenty of unanticipated work on this front that is difficult to document in this proposal in advance.\n\nBeanstalk finds itself in a healthy position and I am excited to see how the Farm develops over the coming year, particularly when the community has a bit more clarity around progress and timelines.\n\n## Payment\n\n3,000 Beans/month, paid twice per month (1,500 per payment, conditional on Beanstalk Farms being funded by the DAO via future BIPs).\n\nNote that if this proposal passes, I will relinquish my role as a Stalk delegate, as I don't believe it's appropriate for someone being paid by the DAO to be voting on behalf of others.\n\n## Commitment\n\nPart-time (~20 hr/wk).",

But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.” — James Madison\n\nThe farm needs a more transparent group of BFC members to keep the community engaged.

This is meant to be - BIP-40: Require BCM to Reveal Current Multisig Signers**\n\nFarmers must understand the identity of the current multisig signers as the community believes that several signers are affiliated with a bot controlling the growth of the protocol. A signer having control of the protocol and using a bot to time transactions is equivalent to insider trading and should be handled appropriately (removed as a signer).\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeibvyjicghfodvym5xg5u4feb5dokuqzybhcudzctkt7ucehzee7se)\n\n**Several bot operators (some of whom are in direct contact and affiliated with current BFC members) have direct knowledge of development timelines and product development that help maximize their current stakes while keeping this information hidden from the broader farmer community to react and operate on the same playing field.**\n\n> \"When a government betrays the people by amassing too much power and becoming tyrannical, the people have no choice but to exercise their original right of self-defense – to fight the government.” — Alexander Hamilton\n\n### Proposer:\nBeanstalk Farmer (not a troll or proposal based on frustration as WILL BE noted by BFC minions to delegitimize the proposal)\n\n### Summary:\nReveal the multisig signers. Voting for the signers to be revealed DOES NOT mean the signers will be doxxed! Simply their community handles can be revealed, or if a business is one of the signers, simply their business name (e.g many multisigs in DeFi have investment funds as one of their signers). \n\n### Quorum Note:\nQuorum is 50% of total outstanding Stalk participating in the vote.\n\n### Voting Choices:\n- Reveal Current Multisig Signers\n- Don'tReveal Current Multisig Signers\n\n### Background:\nThe BCM is an extension of the Beanstalk DAO. As such, BCM’s role is to 1) enact on-chain the decisions Stalk holders make via off-chain voting and 2) review and verify proposals to ensure the suggested changes are truthfully represented.\n\nThe BCM shall not execute transactions until an associated Snapshot successfully passes in favor of the proposal, except in the case of emergency or canceling a failed transaction. \n\n### Proposal:\nBFP-73 proposed that a multisig should take over control of the admin functionality of Beanstalk.\n\nHowever, the proposal lead to all the signers of the multisig being anonymous and chosen by Publius. The community has raised concerns that there is no ability to verify the existence of these individuals, and must trust Publius both has not chosen sybil identities and can safely guard the identity of these individuals (since anonymity is the motivation for their proposal).\n\nThe team posturing that anonymous signers are of upmost importance, while having a doxxed entity (Publius) knowing all of the signers identities seems counterintuitive. The motivation behind anonymous signers is to be said to prevent entities such as governments to deploy malicious code to Beanstalk. However, this can lead to a scenario where said entity compels Publius to reveal the signers' identities without being able to inform anyone of the compromise. Now only the malicious entity knows of the identities and the community has no way to respond.\n\nThis proposal postures that some or all multisig signers should have their pseudonymous identities revealed, in order to provide transparency to the community on the legitimacy of the signers.\n\nNOTE: Voting for the signers to be revealed DOES NOT mean the signers will be doxxed! Simply their community handles can be revealed, or if a business is one of the signers, simply their business name (e.g many multisigs in DeFi have investment funds as one of their signers).\n\n### Rationale:\nA signer having control of the protocol and using a bot to time transactions is equivalent to insider trading and should be handled appropriately (removed as a signer).",

We proposed the addition of \"Rex\" via BFCP-A-5 but the current BFC members failed to announce the proposal on Discord to notify farmers. In addition, they had their minions delegitimize the proposal to reduce voter turnout.

The current BFC have failed to engage with the community and have not been transparent with the current development timelines and audits.\n\nProposal:\nConsidering the current BFC teams members are not actively engaged with the Beanstalk community, this BFCP is proposed to add an additional BFC member \"Rex\". He/him/they is an active member of the community and stalk delegate. The following background on \"Rex\" as provided in his/him/they delegate thread:\n\n\"I held the role of Department Head for the Community Team from February 2022 until after the exploit when that group was disbanded. I've been hosting The BeanPod podcast since that time as well, recording nearly 40 episodes. I've also had the good fortune to host the Radio DeFi podcast.\n\nThe goal of the DAO should be to provide individuals impacted by the protocol the ability to have a voice in shaping and governing it. What I appreciate about the delegate system is that it allows anyone the ability to say \"I want my votes to be counted, but I don't have the bandwidth to make informed decisions, so I'm entrusting ___ to do so on my behalf.\"\n\nRationale:\nNeed a more transparent group of BFC members to keep the community engaged. Currently all timelines and project updates are discussed behind closed doors.\n\nNew BFC Members:\nGoing forward BFC members should be able to effectively communicate development and audit plans and timelines. We will support paying these contributors so long as they effectively keep communicating with farmers.",

While it’s understood that development is being conducted under an existing budget and that a future development budget may not be necessary (reducing the need for fiduciary accountability), long-term confidence in the protocol is closely tied to DAO members’ knowledge of ongoing development and maintenance activities. The BFC is uniquely positioned to provide such updates and, therefore, the appropriate group to hold the responsibility.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nUpdate BFC Responsibilities to include weekly written updates and a monthly update call.\n\nWeekly written updates will include (but need not be limited to):\n\n_Major Projects_\n- Name and short description \n- Recent developments (past week)\n- Next steps (current week)\n- Percentage completion (10% increments) and confidence level in that percentage (P10/P50/P90)\n\n_Ongoing Operational and Maintenance Efforts_\n- Tasks completed over the past week (anything that takes more than 60 minutes to complete)\n- Tasks for the current week that will likely take more than 60 minutes to complete\n\n_Projects Under Consideration_\n- Project description \n- Potential benefit of the project \n- Questions or concerns regarding the project\n- Potential resource necessary for completion \n- Level of consideration (e.g., Gathering Information, Under Review, In Preparation, etc.)\n\nMonthly update calls will include (but need not be limited to):\n- A summary of completed project work from the prior month \n- A summary of anticipated project work for the current month \n- A summary of projects under consideration \n- A period for questions and answers from attendees\n\nMonthly update calls will be recorded and made available to the Beanstalk DAO via Discord within 24 hours of completion.\n\nAll updates must be performed by a member of the BFC or their appointed representative(s). Failure to deliver updates (written or calls) on more than four occasions in a calendar year will result in the immediate dismissal of all sitting members of the BFC and trigger nominations for new members.\n\n## Beans Minted\n\nNone.\n\n## Effective\n\nUpon passage.",

Accordingly, there are current proposals to remove the current BFC members due to lack of communication and replace them. \n\nProposal:\nIn anticipation of the removal of the current BFC members, we are proposing to add \"Safisynai\" as a BFC member to help transition the new members of the BFC that will be elected. If \"Safisynai\" does not accept the nomination, we will propose another active member of the community. Considering \"Safisynai\" is an active member and a \"delegate\" of stalk, we see no issue in he/him accepting.\n\nSafisynai Background and Delegate Summary\n\"I have a strong commitment to decentralisation and open source, and I've been in the Ethereum space since the 2016/2017 ICO era. Transparency, digital rights (privacy, data ownership, opposition to DRM & TPM, continued public accessibility of general purpose computation, and intellectual property reform just to name a few) and civil liberties (in particular anti-censorship and freedom of expression in a world increasingly dominated by centralised, corporate-aligned closed platforms & data silos; my commitment to both decentralisation & open source is a natural outcome of these beliefs) are extremely important issues to me, so much so that I was once (several years ago now, my involvement fell by the wayside over the years due to career commitments, and later, health issues) an officer of Pirate Party Australia who, while largely unsuccessful electorally, nonetheless advocated for these causes in Australia's political sphere.\n\nI've been a part of the Beanstalk community since late September of 2021, learning of the project via Olympus' #off-topic channel, during the aftermath of the early pump & dump. The project's community, whitepaper, and critically, its commitment to decentralisation convinced me to sow back then, when the Bean price was around $0.3 and temperature (\"weather\" back then!) was around 500%, re-sowing my pods at maturity for a greater amount of pods that I still hold to this day. I also participated in the Barn Raise as much as my financial circumstances have allowed, and have recently purchased an Unripe LP position via an OTC trade. I still hold these positions and have no intention of leaving any time soon!\n\nI wish to be a delegate as I am committed to the long-term future and health of Beanstalk as both a system and a community, and I believe my technical background, my understanding of the project, and my ongoing engagement with the project & community has and will continue to aid me in voting in accordance with the long-term best interests of the system & community alike. As part of this, I recognise that our present quorum requirements present somewhat of a challenge given the presently reduced levels of engagement; as such I feel a delegate system is well warranted to allow those who do not have the capacity or inclination to remain adequately informed and engaged to nonetheless participate indirectly in governance. I believe my background and principles alike make applying to be a delegate not simply tenable, but a matter of civic responsibility.\"\n\nRationale:\nNeed a more transparent group of BFC members to keep the community engaged. Currently all timelines and project updates are discussed behind closed doors.\n\nPayment:\nNo payment until there is an independant group of at least 3 new BFC members. Payment will be contingent on the success of the protocol ie BEAN utility, increase in liquidity, partnerships with other protocols, etc.",

The delegate system allows for individuals to find people they trust and empower them to make decisions for the good of the ecosystem. I believe I would be worthy of that trust.\n\nThe goal of the DAO should be to provide individuals impacted by the protocol the ability to have a voice in shaping and governing it.

      "content": "## Proposer\n\nBeanstalk Farms\n\n## Summary\n\nThere has been [much](https://discord.com/channels/880413392916054098/1024499666311708712/1024499666311708712) [discussion](https://discord.com/channels/880413392916054098/1105925045294993459/1105927525789618216) in the Beanstalk community about the incentives for converting Unripe assets. In [Temp-Check-1](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0xd47bc5099839f79e1d5ba0870d5c5ffff6ab416787c3ddca69d8500d9877e8e1), the DAO expressed a preference for setting the Seeds per BDV rewards for urBEAN (Unripe Bean) and urBEAN3CRV (Unripe BEAN:3CRV LP) to be equal. \n\nIn Temp-Check-2, the DAO has the opportunity to express a preference for what the urBEAN and urBEAN3CRV Seed rewards should both be set to (they are currently set to 2 and 4, respectively).\n\n## Process Note\n\nThis temperature check proposal is intended for the DAO to express a preference in advance of the Silo V3 BIP. Ultimately, as the future proposer of the BIP, Beanstalk Farms reserves the right to set the Unripe Seed rewards in the BIP to any values.\n\nGiven that this proposal is simply for Beanstalk Farms to gather information, there is no quorum. Stalkholders are still strongly encouraged to participate in order for the outcome of the vote to be as representative as possible. The vote will last 7 days.\n\n## Voting Choices\n\nGiven that the DAO expressed interest in Unripe Seeds Parity, what should the Unripe Seed rewards both be set to? (Currently their Seeds per BDV rewards and 2 and 4, respectively.)\n\n* 0 Seeds\n* 0.5 Seeds\n* 1 Seed\n* 1.5 Seeds\n* 2 Seeds\n\n## Considerations\n\nSee the discussion channel in the Beanstalk Discord for more information.\n\nSome considerations in favor of significantly decreasing the Unripe Seed rewards (even to zero):\n\n- Beanstalk has little (or nothing) to gain from incentivizing Silo Members to keep Unripe Deposits in the Silo;\n- This would increase the incentive for new Deposits in the Silo;\n- Even if low or zero Seeds marginally increase the attractiveness of Chopping, Chopping benefits Beanstalk in the form of decreased Unripe obligations;\n- etc.\n\nSome consideration in favor of not significantly decreasing the Unripe Seed rewards:\n\n- It will potentially make it more difficult to pass a BIP that significantly decreases the Unripe Seed rewards given that currently most Stalk comes from Unripe Deposits (although the purpose of this vote is to gather feedback and align the DAO in advance of the Silo V3 BIP, such that the Unripe Seeds change creates as little friction as possible);\n- etc.\n",

      "title": "Temp-Check-1: Unripe Seeds Parity",
      "content": "## Proposer\n\nBeanstalk Farms\n\n## Summary\n\nThere has been [much discussion](https://discord.com/channels/880413392916054098/1024499666311708712/1024499666311708712) in the Beanstalk community about the incentives for converting Unripe assets. \n\nCurrently Beanstalk rewards 2 and 4 Seeds per BDV for urBEAN (Unripe Bean) Deposits and urBEAN3CRV (Unripe BEAN:3CRV LP) Deposits, respectively. There is a significant amount of Deposited urBEAN3CRV that could be converted to repeg the Bean price. \n\nThe concept of Unripe Seeds Parity is to set the Seeds per BDV for both Unripe assets to the same amount, which would reduce friction in converting urBEAN3CRV to urBEAN.\n\n## Process Note\n\nThis temperature check proposal is intended for the DAO to express a preference in advance of the Silo V3 BIP. Ultimately, as the future proposer of the BIP, Beanstalk Farms reserves the right to set the Unripe Seed rewards in the BIP to any values.\n\nGiven that this proposal is simply for Beanstalk Farms to gather information, there is no quorum. Stalkholders are still strongly encouraged to participate in order for the outcome of the vote to be as representative as possible. The vote will last 7 days.\n\nIn the event that Stalkholders indicate interest in moving forward with Unripe Seeds Parity, the intention is to propose a follow up Temp Check with a multiple choice vote for what the Seeds per BDV values for Unripe assets should be set to.\n\n## Voting Choices\n\nUnripe Seeds Parity is setting the Seeds per BDV rewards for urBEAN and urBEAN3CRV to be equal (currently their Seeds per BDV rewards and 2 and 4, respectively).\n\n1. For (Unripe Seed Parity)\n2. Against (Unripe Seed Parity)\n\n## Considerations\n\nSee the [discussion channel](https://discord.com/channels/880413392916054098/1105925045294993459/1105927525789618216) in the Beanstalk Discord for more information.\n\nSome considerations in favor of Unripe Seeds Parity:\n\n- Most of the friction for conversions from urBEAN3CRV to urBEAN below peg are removed;\n- There is less need (or no need) to use Seed rewards to incentive new urBEAN3CRV Deposits like there is with new BEAN3CRV Deposits;\n- etc.\n\nSome considerations against Unripe Seeds Parity:\n\n- Given that most liquidity still underlies urBEAN3CRV, during the next growth cycle there is likely to be more upside volatility than normal given the reduced incentive to convert back from urBEAN to urBEAN3CRV (i.e., there’s no extra Seeds to be gained by doing so);\n- The goal is for Beanstalk to be an autonomous system and manually changing the Seed rewards via BIP is akin to directly setting monetary policy, which should be avoided (until a Gauge System can change Seed rewards in an autonomous fashion);\n- etc.",

      "content": "## Proposer\n\nBeanstalk Farms\n\n## Summary\n\n* Pay Beanstalk Farms contributors retroactively in Unripe Beans for their contributions between the exploit and Unpause.\n\n## Quorum\n\nPer [BFP-81](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0xa24c368f08093b8a5e27c0b3ae9296eb60272cddc8882434b02a86152d903e59), quorum is 15% of the Stalk supply, or 7,747,086 Stalk based on the time of proposal. \n\nThere are 22 voting choices, and each represents voting For a contributor's proposal. Abstaining from a voting choice while voting For any other choices is equivalent to voting against. Quorum and a majority vote For is required for a contributor’s proposal to pass.\n\n## Proposal\n\nEach Beanstalk Farms contributor who felt they should be compensated retroactively for their post-exploit contributions wrote a proposal that includes their contributions and proposed Unripe Bean payment. BFRPP-1 will be the only BFRPP.\n\nPer [BIP-23](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkdao.eth/proposal/0x3b2a7808f01960ff993b7aec4df9ef6a3434d0ef0843828ea6c6bce4e768e6a9), Bean Sprout can use their remaining 391,800 Unripe Beans to retroactively compensate Beanstalk Farms contributors. Beanstalk Farms custodies ~2,062,760 Unripe Beans. This totals to ~2,454,560 Unripe Beans.\n\nThe sum of all Unripe Bean asks is 3,066,940. If the sum of Unripe Beans in all proposals that pass is greater than 2,454,560, the 2,454,560 Unripe Beans will be distributed pro rata to everyone whose proposals passed. If an individual proposal fails to pass, those Unripe Beans will be distributed pro rata to everyone whose proposals passed. Pro rata distributions are based on the Unripe Bean asks in each contributor’s proposal.\n\nContributor’s proposals are linked below. The community had the opportunity to [provide feedback on the proposals anonymously](https://moored.co/b/AjqSqSUVza). Contributors were able to update their proposals in advance of BFRPP-1 being proposed on Snapshot, if they wished.\n\n### 2bean\n\n**Proposal:** [https://arweave.net/qATqY8nLcazhfOADFDZycFYkHhhxjSAJJKOhB4pAKZM](https://arweave.net/qATqY8nLcazhfOADFDZycFYkHhhxjSAJJKOhB4pAKZM)\n\n**Vote For:** Pay 2bean 7.5k urBEAN\n\n### aloceros\n\n**Proposal:** [https://arweave.net/Xpw4x5qDnBYzNt8efhYZk0__ThVoWw2KTIiSRNdzCvk](https://arweave.net/Xpw4x5qDnBYzNt8efhYZk0__ThVoWw2KTIiSRNdzCvk)\n\n**Vote For:** Pay aloceros 25k urBEAN\n\n### Audio Team: Beanthoven and belabeantok\n\n**Proposal:** [https://arweave.net/0goURj8hCshJKbgxoOk60ifrZGyjvI8MrFyWUSPdG7Q](https://arweave.net/0goURj8hCshJKbgxoOk60ifrZGyjvI8MrFyWUSPdG7Q)\n\n**Vote For:** Pay Audio Team 60k urBEAN\n\n### austin\n\n**Proposal:** [https://arweave.net/ottClDwqdD37CS_RVxFuy68gtE23dct4x697pCxCluE](https://arweave.net/ottClDwqdD37CS_RVxFuy68gtE23dct4x697pCxCluE)\n\n**Vote For:** Pay austin 385k urBEAN\n\n### Beasley\n\n**Proposal:** [https://arweave.net/dIMhMiRH2OmHSlLSVvI2VrZOQBlRMUsE_CTM5CFJonY](https://arweave.net/dIMhMiRH2OmHSlLSVvI2VrZOQBlRMUsE_CTM5CFJonY)\n\n**Vote For:** Pay Beasley 30k urBEAN\n\n### Brean\n\n**Proposal:** [https://arweave.net/MeBbO9bzePtHgnrDQ9OQR-CfNo5xaHZxJRccMgDaOn8](https://arweave.net/MeBbO9bzePtHgnrDQ9OQR-CfNo5xaHZxJRccMgDaOn8)\n\n**Vote For:** Pay Brean 75k urBEAN\n\n### CanadianBennett\n\n**Proposal:** [https://arweave.net/OGBFcWuHW946A2os2MYwrY0-oYtRmCxAzRZH0tg2Xpw](https://arweave.net/OGBFcWuHW946A2os2MYwrY0-oYtRmCxAzRZH0tg2Xpw)\n\n**Vote For:** Pay CanadianBennett 25k urBEAN\n\n### Cool Bean\n\n**Proposal:** [https://arweave.net/qPx5bi4zxfmcGo2FfQI34KlcSjcc8K70XXhqHaa-8Yw](https://arweave.net/qPx5bi4zxfmcGo2FfQI34KlcSjcc8K70XXhqHaa-8Yw)\n\n**Vote For:** Pay Cool Bean 420k urBEAN\n\n### Cujo\n\n**Proposal:** [https://arweave.net/36XG3qWfOmVmQA-ZU8Kxg4rLjrz6Y7Xd4UWPqXxyvMk](https://arweave.net/36XG3qWfOmVmQA-ZU8Kxg4rLjrz6Y7Xd4UWPqXxyvMk)\n\n**Vote For:** Pay Cujo 175k urBEAN\n\n### ereal\n\n**Proposal:** [https://arweave.net/WI76r1dLHKTqU6EdSSVpSZOryifymCiC6nodVwSWRX8](https://arweave.net/WI76r1dLHKTqU6EdSSVpSZOryifymCiC6nodVwSWRX8)\n\n**Vote For:** Pay ereal 65k urBEAN\n\n### ethwallet\n\n**Proposal:** [https://arweave.net/m9tCsOSFszNqqAf4K82ueQHHtaF8nv25ObG-pi8fbFE](https://arweave.net/m9tCsOSFszNqqAf4K82ueQHHtaF8nv25ObG-pi8fbFE)\n\n**Vote For:** Pay ethwallet 60k urBEAN\n\n### funderberker\n\n**Proposal:** [https://arweave.net/yp9XhDeCg4_2qjegmg_7UVoCqk6iKB6Dl0usDAHV0Oo](https://arweave.net/yp9XhDeCg4_2qjegmg_7UVoCqk6iKB6Dl0usDAHV0Oo)\n\n**Vote For:** Pay funderberker 125k urBEAN\n\n### JWW\n\n**Proposal:** [https://arweave.net/AOQHrpoBF3TdMZCQqbaOmI05FkQhQYFTCemt093-ynk](https://arweave.net/AOQHrpoBF3TdMZCQqbaOmI05FkQhQYFTCemt093-ynk)\n\n**Vote For:** Pay JWW 74.5k urBEAN\n\n### malteasy\n\n**Proposal:** [https://arweave.net/HZpDzsWLCgxb8WNrAtnz62sWZSe3jh6H-YMDB5WWs34](https://arweave.net/HZpDzsWLCgxb8WNrAtnz62sWZSe3jh6H-YMDB5WWs34)\n\n**Vote For:** Pay malteasy 36k urBEAN\n\n### Max Sow\n\n**Proposal:** [https://arweave.net/cfmCUNpqekQXAT24Mso0Om4WuP7HY_JG7nENA3_L-Hc](https://arweave.net/cfmCUNpqekQXAT24Mso0Om4WuP7HY_JG7nENA3_L-Hc)\n\n**Vote For:** Pay Max Sow 40k urBEAN\n\n### mod323\n\n**Proposal:** [https://arweave.net/tAslRR4w3gXbFpCDzalcQX0wlxAe8o6yBmP350Yd59A](https://arweave.net/tAslRR4w3gXbFpCDzalcQX0wlxAe8o6yBmP350Yd59A)\n\n**Vote For:** Pay mod323 395.25k urBEAN\n\n### Rex\n\n**Proposal:** [https://arweave.net/eTenSbc-4Dgoz8WrbXCD3KbXkOn01dLSzmBO5i3gUJw](https://arweave.net/eTenSbc-4Dgoz8WrbXCD3KbXkOn01dLSzmBO5i3gUJw)\n\n**Vote For:** Pay Rex 24k urBEAN\n\n### Silo Chad\n\n**Proposal:** [https://arweave.net/siFa92Ur0g42v-EjzdzXyCybm07YTFBXmspJmqdjkcM](https://arweave.net/siFa92Ur0g42v-EjzdzXyCybm07YTFBXmspJmqdjkcM)\n\n**Vote For:** Pay Silo Chad 500k urBEAN\n\n### sweetredbeans\n\n**Proposal:** [https://arweave.net/MiwAB6WPNmRtKfQPVioBe3J0v51HwfZW-uirLz81voY](https://arweave.net/MiwAB6WPNmRtKfQPVioBe3J0v51HwfZW-uirLz81voY)\n\n**Vote For:** Pay sweetredbeans 420.69k urBEAN\n\n### sync\n\n**Proposal:** [https://arweave.net/ERpvSZuogJlAMYGlWwdxZdXqsfsxlkVWvftNfuFlATo](https://arweave.net/ERpvSZuogJlAMYGlWwdxZdXqsfsxlkVWvftNfuFlATo)\n\n**Vote For:** Pay sync 35k urBEAN\n\n### TBIQ\n\n**Proposal:** [https://arweave.net/x7EwuVfsQEHG80jLq7KWwl6a3SenflyLyFlkbtRLwZQ](https://arweave.net/x7EwuVfsQEHG80jLq7KWwl6a3SenflyLyFlkbtRLwZQ)\n\n**Vote For:** Pay TBIQ 35k urBEAN\n\n### ZrowGz\n\n**Proposal:** [https://arweave.net/kNWeT5rUVa_4pytzIbYSR42DBUsp-GtLPUdXBy4P4eI](https://arweave.net/kNWeT5rUVa_4pytzIbYSR42DBUsp-GtLPUdXBy4P4eI)\n\n**Vote For:** Pay ZrowGz 54k urBEAN\n",

I worked in several engineering and operations roles at startups and venture capital funds prior to contributing to Beanstalk.\n\n# Past Contributions to Beanstalk\n\n**Engineering:**\n* Upgraded and maintained [Beanstalk UI v1](https://pre-exploit-beanstalk-ui.netlify.app/) from January 2022 through April 2022. A changelog is available in **#ui-updates** on Discord. Notable upgrades included:\n    * The Farmers Market;\n    * [Support for wallets besides Metamask](https://twitter.com/BeanstalkFarms/status/1509962212290576384), including WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, and Ledger;\n    * Support for the BEAN:3CRV pool and the BEAN:LUSD pool; and\n    * Various performance and UX improvements.\n* Designed the [bean.money](https://bean.money/) landing page; led a small team of engineers to build it.\n* Developed several iterations of the Barn Raise UI throughout April and May as the Path Forward plan was undergoing development. This includes the final version of the [Barn Raise](https://app.bean.money) which was finalized in [BFP-72](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0xb87854d7f6f40f0877a1333028eab829b213fbcce03f16f9dd3832c8a98ab99b) and launched on June 6.\n* Built [Beanstalk UI v2](https://app.bean.money/) from scratch to accommodate the Replant, Unripe assets, and new Beanstalk features. A live demo is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE358B9OagM). Notable features include:\n    * Support for Beanstalk’s farm() functionality, allowing complex chaining of actions within Beanstalk and via the Depot. Engineered a new library for interacting with Beanstalk in this generalized fashion.\n    * Support for Unripe assets within the Silo, as well as Pick and Chop functionality.\n    * Support for purchasing Fertilizer and Rinsing Rinsable Sprouts after Replant.\n    * A new design.\n    * Performant loading of Farmers’ balances and Beanstalk analytics from multiple data sources.\n    * Support for viewing the Beanstalk UI on mobile devices.\n    * Support for viewing the Beanstalk UI without a wallet connected.\n* Designed a new schema for the Beanstalk subgraph, taking into account changes proposed in BIP-21—this will serve as a foundation for the subgraph used by the Beanstalk UI and other projects that build on top of Beanstalk.\n\n**Operations:**\n* Guided conversations amongst DAO members and the Beanstalk Farms team, which unfolded into Beanstalk Farms’ [Path Forward](https://bean.money/blog/path-forward) plan.\n* Led daily standups with Beanstalk Farms to execute on the Path Forward.\n* Hosted DAO meetings; communicated Beanstalk Farms’ plans with the Beanstalk community.\n* Managed a number of Beanstalk Farms’ tools and platforms.\n\n# Role\n\nContinue engineering the Beanstalk UI and Beanstalk SDKs. Post-Replant work will include (among other things):\n* An improved Pod Market interface that introduces charts and other visuals;\n* Expanded support for the Farm within DeFi;\n* Support for new liquidity pools as they’re ratified by the Beanstalk DAO;\n* A unified Governance page to aggregate Snapshot proposals and other governance conversations;\n* Release of Barn Raise NFTs;\n* Open-sourcing of the website and the Beanstalk SDK, which allows anyone to compose and execute transactions through the Farm;\n* Reintroduction of on-chain governance if ratified by the DAO;\n* Support for new Beanstalk protocol upgrades;Write technical and non-technical documentation for the Farmers’ Almanac related to the Beanstalk UI and other components; andExpand and coordinate Beanstalk Farms’ engineering team; develop a plan to allow continued development and maintenance of Beanstalk’s code in a decentralized fashion.\n\nGenerally, I am here to do whatever Beanstalk needs to succeed, whether in engineering, operations, or other capacity.\n\n# Payment\n\n30,000 Beans/month, paid twice per month, starting from the Unpause (conditional on Beanstalk Farms being funded by the DAO via future BIPs).\n\n# Commitment\n\nFull-time (40+ hr/wk).\n",

I’d encourage the DAO to browse a view-only version of the Figma file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/kN2a5ROcRgrUbxGZrJAFvr/Relaunch-UI?node-id=9297%3A101886) (2000+ frames!) that encapsulates much of my work over the last 3 months. For those who prefer to read, my work on the new UI consisted of: \n\n* Building the pre-Unpause [Barn Raise page](https://app.bean.money/) (more updates coming!).\n* Building the entire [design system](https://www.figma.com/file/kN2a5ROcRgrUbxGZrJAFvr/Relaunch-UI?node-id=4276%3A104961) from scratch while maintaining feature parity with UI V1.\n* Conceiving of and building net new features to include in Beanstalk UI V2 such as [the Season table](https://www.figma.com/file/kN2a5ROcRgrUbxGZrJAFvr/Relaunch-UI?node-id=4715%3A55931), [the Forecast page](https://www.figma.com/file/kN2a5ROcRgrUbxGZrJAFvr/Relaunch-UI?node-id=7109%3A146676), and the [Silo Deposits graph](https://www.figma.com/file/kN2a5ROcRgrUbxGZrJAFvr/Relaunch-UI?node-id=9242%3A100738).\n* [Componentizing](https://www.figma.com/file/kN2a5ROcRgrUbxGZrJAFvr/Relaunch-UI?node-id=4276%3A104961) and standardizing all work in Figma to be easily extensible for future iterations and other contributors.\n\n# Role\n\nWhile we’re about to ship a newly styled version of the dApp—with a stronger visual language and standardized design system which will scale—I believe that we’ll need to shift gears and adjust our framing to focus on improving usability.\n\nBecause my time has mostly been spent re-building the Beanstalk UI to this point, I expect my day-to-day work will adjust slightly post-Unpause. I expect my role to consist of: \n\n* Setting up a more formal research and discovery process to find usability gaps in the product (via community involvement).\n* Researching and developing design patterns for future Beanstalk functionality (a generalized transaction builder for the farm() function).\n* Improving the new UI to lean into more custom, interactive, and visual components (a high fidelity Pod Line visualization, more details on whitelisted Silo tokens—particularly if they are trading pairs, more informative charts for Silo Deposits, etc).\n* Working with engineering to onboard high-quality product talent (PM’s, designers & engineers).\n* Driving a process to gather & understand usage data.\n* Building dark mode :).\n\nAs Beanstalk grows, I’d like to propose myself to be on the BFC so I can support the DAO in finding the right product and design people to build a great interface for Beanstalk.\n\n# Payment\n\n22,500 Beans/month, paid twice per month, starting from the Unpause.\n\n# Commitment\n\nFull-time (40+ hr/wk).\n",

      "content": "# Proposer\n\nBeanstalk Farms\n\n# Summary\n\n* Clarify the governance and proposal structures for Beanstalk Farms and Bean Sprout.\n* Increase the scope of the Beanstalk Farms Committee (BFC) powers to include discretion over the Beanstalk Farms budget outside of just contributor pay.\n* Reduce the scope of the BFC powers to no longer have discretion over the distribution of Unripe Beans for contributions pre-Replant—see the _BFRPP Changes Rationale_ section.\n* Deprecate Beanstalk Farms Proposals and introduce Beanstalk Operations Proposals.\n* Change a handful of terminology updates from BFP-79.\n\n# Proposal\n\nPost-exploit, BFPs were used as a way for Beanstalk Farms to quickly get approval from the DAO for Barn Raise plans, Replant structure like the Beanstalk Community Multisig, etc., despite the fact that they were originally only intended to be used for spending the Beanstalk Farms budget per [BIP-8](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/blob/master/bips/bip-8.md#optimistic-approvals).\n\nIn an effort to return to a more well-defined decentralized governance structure, it’s important to codify the governance processes for Beanstalk Farms and Bean Sprout in full (to the extent they can be) and make it such that making significant changes to them requires a significant amount of Stalk to vote For.\n\nBeanstalk Farms proposes the following amendments and additions for proposals moving forward. **Changes are highlighted in yellow. Rationales for each change are included below the table.** BIPs are included for completeness, but are not part of this proposal, as changing the BIP process would require a BIP.\n\n#### See the table on pages 2 and 3 of this Arweave document:\n\nhttps://arweave.net/D_Gnh6ikxTT14HVKg7DhOSRdFwAorOO0AcVvZL0PBWc\n\n#### BIP Changes Rationale\n\nNo changes.\n\n#### BOP Changes Rationale\n\nThere is a class of proposals that the DAO should vote on that are not necessarily protocol changes a la BIPs. An example may be, but is not limited to, ratifying the set of disclosures about the risks of interacting with Beanstalk.\n\nThese should not be optimistically approved like BFPs were, and should require a significant Stalk threshold to pass.\n\nThe following are the processes in place for community members to submit a BOP and coordinate with the BCM to submit a Snapshot proposal on the Beanstalk DAO Snapshot page:\n\n1. A proposer must own 0.1% of the total Stalk supply in order to propose a BOP. The proposer shall verify that they meet the Stalk ownership threshold by creating and verifying a signature on etherscan. The steps to create and verify a signature on etherscan can be found [here](https://info.etherscan.com/verify-signature-tool/). The proposer will then reach out to the Mods on Discord and from there, the BCM will verify that the address that signed the message has sufficient Stalk.\n2. The proposer will publish the written proposal in a dedicated channel in the Beanstalk Discord. For assistance creating a channel on Discord, contact the Mods on Discord.\n3. The written proposal shall be discussed in the Discord channel for a sufficient amount of time. What constitutes sufficient will be at the sole discretion of the BCM, but the BCM must formally propose the BOP on Snapshot on behalf of the proposer within 2 weeks of the creation of the dedicated Discord channel, unless the proposer decides to withdraw their proposal.\n4. The BCM will submit a Snapshot of the written proposal to formally begin the voting period.\n\n#### BFP Changes Rationale\n\nIf the BFC has discretion on how to use the Beanstalk Farms budget via BFBPs, it becomes unclear what BFPs are for.\n\nAs mentioned, it’s important to codify the governance processes for Beanstalk Farms and Bean Sprout in full (to the extent they can be), such that making significant changes to them requires a significant amount of Stalk voting For. In contrast, BFPs were optimistically approved per [BIP-8](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/blob/master/bips/bip-8.md#optimistic-approvals).\n\nBOPs will be used as the procedure moving forward for having the DAO vote on proposals that are not necessarily protocol code changes and also outside of the scope of BSPs, BFCPs and BFBPs.\n\nTherefore, BFPs are deprecated.\n\n#### BSP Changes Rationale\n\nPer BFP-80, anyone with 0.1% of Stalk can propose a BSP. Now, any address on the Bean Sprout Multisig can also propose a BSP. Anyone on the Bean Sprout Multisig should also have significant alignment with the success of Beanstalk and accordingly an effective use of the Bean Sprout budget. Thus, this change is implemented primarily for flexibility purposes.\n\nBSPs are still optimistically approved, but only require a 10% quorum and majority voting Against in order to veto. This allows those that are pleased with the actions of Bean Sprout to remain passive, unless there is a quorum voting Against a particular proposal.\n\n#### BFCP-A Changes Rationale\n\nNo changes. The term of a BFC member whose BFCP-A passes still ends two quarters after the end of the current quarter.\n\n#### BFCP-B Changes Rationale\n\nThe quorum required to remove a BFC member has been increased from 25% to 35%. Similar to the BFBP-B quorum being higher than the BFBP-A quorum, this facilitates permissionless contributions as there must be a higher consensus to remove someone than to add someone to the BFC.\n\n#### BFCP-C Changes Rationale\n\nThe BFC renewal Snapshot must go up in the last month of each quarter—March, June, September and December. This allows the DAO to evaluate each BFC member based on the current quarter.\n\nThe BFCP-C quorum is increased from 15% to 25% to match the quorum requirement for BFCP-As. Extending a term on the BFC should require the same quorum as getting added to the BFC.\n\nBFP-80 stated that BFC members whose renewal proposal passes “will have their term extended by two quarters after _the end of the current quarter_, or extended to a maximum of three quarters after the end of the current quarter, whichever is shorter.” This was a typo. BFC members whose renewal proposal passes will have their term extended by two quarters after _the end of their current term_, with a maximum term length of three quarters after the end of the current quarter.\n\n#### BFRPP Changes Rationale\n\nThe BFC no longer has discretion over distributing Unripe Beans to contributors for pre-Replant contributions. Given that the BFC is formed after contributions made between the exploit and Replant, it is more appropriate to have the DAO vote to grant Unripe Bean payments.\n\nBeanstalk Farms will propose a one-time, multi-choice proposal within 30 days after Replant called a Beanstalk Farms Retroactive Payment Proposal, or BFRPP. Each voting choice on the BFRPP corresponds to a contributor who is proposing to get retroactively compensated in Unripe Beans.\n\nThe BFRPP will contain each contributor's contributions and an associated number of Unripe Beans that the contributor is proposing to be paid.  \n\nQuorum for the BFRPP is 15% of the Stalk supply, after which a majority vote For is required to pass for each individual contributor (where abstaining on a voting choice is equivalent to voting Against). \n\n### BFBP-A Changes Rationale\n\nBeanstalk Farms Staff Proposals have been renamed to Beanstalk Farms Budget Proposals to account for the increase in scope (see the BFBP-C Changes Rationale section).\n\n#### BFBP-B Changes Rationale\n\nNo changes. The BFC will still maintain a public list of contributors per BFP-80. Also per BFP-80, BFBP-Bs still will not mention the contributor’s name, but instead will include a hash, where the input of the hash indicates the contributor being dismissed. The input of the hash will be shared only with the BFC and the contributor in question. This allows the contributor to verify the result of the vote while preserving their privacy during the voting period and if the vote fails. A BFBP-B will also be proposed in circumstances where a contributor is leaving Beanstalk Farms voluntarily.\n\n#### BFBP-C Changes Rationale\n\nBFBP-Cs extend the scope of BFC powers to discretion over budget spending outside of contributor pay. In practice, contributor pay (which the BFC was given discretion over per BFP-80) has been and will likely continue to be the majority of Beanstalk Farms expenditures, but there are occasional other payments outside of that scope like paying for upgrades to the subgraph, paying an artist for art on the website, etc. Instituting BFBP-Cs allows the BFC to move quickly on budget decisions.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreie7vfodfzldfqd7p5u5w7zli5yvhb3slb2y4b27fxioswiymmd6xa)\n(See the [Arweave link](https://arweave.net/D_Gnh6ikxTT14HVKg7DhOSRdFwAorOO0AcVvZL0PBWc) for a higher resolution diagram)\n\n## Additional Amendments\n\n1. In all cases where Stalkholders vote on a proposal or a proposal requires a minimum Stalk threshold to propose, if the Stalk supply is compromised in a flash loan or other governance attack at the time of proposal, the proposal is void.\n2. In all cases where a proposal requires a minimum Stalk threshold to propose, the minimum Stalk threshold must be met _at the time of proposal_.\n3. Additions/removals/rotations of Beanstalk Farms Multisig or Bean Sprout Multisig signers must be proposed either via BOP or as part of a BIP. A BIP/BOP is not required if a signer voluntarily leaves a multisig (nor for rotating in a backup signer in the event of a voluntary departure). \n4. Any proposals that do not pass for any reason may be proposed again after the end of the original voting period.\n5. A BFCP-B is not required if the BFC member voluntarily leaves Beanstalk Farms. The BFC member will create a record of their departure by creating and verifying a signature on etherscan using the address they used to propose and vote on BFBPs.\n6. Beanstalk Farms often sends funds to reimburse contributors for various software expenses. A BFBP-C is not required for transactions valued at under 4000 Beans or USDC. Similarly, a BSP is not required for Bean Sprout to send transactions valued at under 4000 Beans.\n7. Bean Sprout hiring proposals can either be proposed as part of a BIP, BOP or BSP.\n8. Moving forward, any changes to the governance structure outlined in this proposal must be changed via BIP or BOP.\n9. Because terminology changes can only be made via BIP or BOP moving forward, we are taking the opportunity in this final BFP to propose a handful of minor amendments to the terminology updates in BFP-79 before the Replant:\n    1. Receivable Assets → Claimable Assets\n        1. Rationale: “Receive” became an issue given that this functionality is adjacent to “Sending” Deposits in the Silo (it is confusing to have Sending and Receiving be next to each other when they are not related or opposites). _Claiming_ assets after Withdrawing is also more intuitive than _Receiving_.\n    2. Fertilized Sprouts → Rinsable Sprouts\n        2. Rationale: Given that Sprouts that are redeemable for Beans must be _Rinsed_, it is more appropriate for _Rinsable_ Sprouts to be Rinsed, similar to how Harvestable Pods must be Harvested.\n    3. Downpour → Oversaturation\n        3. Rationale: The Pod Rate being less than 5% is more relevant to the state of the Farm (like how many Pods are in the ground) than the weather above. Thus, it’s more appropriate that it Floods on the Farm after X Seasons of _being Oversaturated_ than after X Seasons of _Downpour_. \n",

      "title": "BFP-80: Beanstalk Farms Committee",
      "content": "# Summary\n\n* Outline a governance structure for Beanstalk Farms.\n* Establish the Beanstalk Farms Committee (BFC), the committee that has decision making power for personnel decisions within Beanstalk Farms. \n\n# Proposal\n\nHistorically there has been minimal process for bringing on contributors to Beanstalk Farms, and no process for letting them go. The last couple months post-exploit have been an opportunity to reflect on what these processes should look like. In preparation for the future Q3 Budget BIP, it is prudent to come up with a clear structure for governance of and within Beanstalk Farms.\n\nThe Beanstalk Farms Committee, or BFC, will be a group of Beanstalk Farms contributors that collectively have the power to hire and let go of contributors within Beanstalk Farms. In order to have clarity on how personnel decisions are made, some notion of authority within Beanstalk Farms is necessary. However, it is critical that these processes are as transparent and permissionless as possible. \n\nThe BFC structure and process are proposed with the following considerations in mind:\n\n* Creating a clear and transparent process for hiring/letting go of contributors; \n* Allowing the BFC to make decisions quickly;\n* Creating accountability for the BFC to the Beanstalk DAO; and\n* Continuing to facilitate a permissionless process to contribute to Beanstalk through Beanstalk Farms.\n\n## BFC Powers\n\nThe BFC has decision making power for personnel decisions within Beanstalk Farms. \n\nBeanstalk Farms Staff Proposals, or BFSPs, will be proposed on a new Snapshot page. BFSPs are proposals to hire or let go of a Beanstalk Farms contributor that is not on the BFC. Any changes to the terms of an existing contributor’s hiring proposal (like a pay increase, for example) will be made via a new hiring proposal. Only BFC members can propose and vote on BFSPs, and each member has 1 vote.\n\nThe voting period for BFSPs shall be 5 days. A BFSP to hire or change the terms of a hiring proposal passes if at the end of the voting period there are at least 3 votes in favor, but this can be overridden by a majority of the BFC voting against. A BFSP should contain salary information, the proposer, the proposed hire, information about what makes the person a good candidate for their role, their proposed responsibilities, etc.\n\nOnce approved via BFSP, a contributor’s term length is indefinite unless otherwise specified (in general, grant work should go through Bean Sprout). In order to maintain an effective, high quality organization, non-BFC contributors who demonstrate a pattern of underperformance may be let go from Beanstalk Farms by the BFC. A BFSP to let go of a contributor passes if at the end of the voting period a majority of the BFC has voted in favor or if 3 BFC members have voted in favor, whichever is more. \n\nA BFSP to let go of a contributor will not mention the contributor’s name, but instead will include a hash, where the input of the hash indicates the contributor being dismissed. The input of the hash will be shared only with the BFC and the contributor in question. This allows the contributor to verify the result of the vote while preserving their privacy during the voting period and if the vote fails. A BFSP will also be proposed in circumstances where a contributor is leaving Beanstalk Farms voluntarily.\n\nThe BFC will maintain a public list of active contributors.\n\n## BFC Selection\n\nThe BFC will consist of nobody to start. \n\nUpon the passage of BFP-80, Beanstalk Farms Committee Proposals (or BFCPs) can be proposed on the Beanstalk Farms Snapshot page. BFCPs are proposals to add someone to the BFC, remove someone from the BFC, renew the existing set of BFC members, or in a one-time special case, retroactively compensate the initial set of BFC members for pre-Replant contributions.\n\n#### Process\nAnyone can propose a BFCP, and the threshold for doing so will be 0.1% of total Stalk. The voting period for BFCPs shall be 7 days. BFCPs require a 25% quorum. Once a quorum is reached, it is the outcome of the Snapshot proposal that determines whether the proposed person is added to the BFC. \n\nThere is no minimum or maximum number of BFC members. With fewer than 3 members, the BFC has no power to hire or let go of contributors; no maximum number facilitates permissionlessness.\n\n#### Proposal Content\n\nBFCPs to add a committee member should be titled “BFCP-X: Add [Person] to the BFC” with “For” and “Against” as voting choices on the Snapshot proposal. A BFCP to add someone to the BFC is also that person’s hiring proposal. Therefore, a BFCP to add someone to the BFC shall contain salary information at minimum, but should also contain information about what makes the person a good candidate for the BFC, their proposed responsibilities within Beanstalk Farms, etc.\n\n#### Term length\n\nOnce approved via BFCP, a BFC member serves on the committee for the remainder of the current quarter (end of March, June, September, or December) in addition to the following two quarters. There is no term limit for BFC members. \n\nEvery quarter, the DAO will have an opportunity to signal support for each of the members of the BFC. This will manifest as a multi-choice BFCP proposed by the BFC where each voting choice corresponds to a current BFC member (e.g. “Renew Bean Farmer X”, “Renew Bean Farmer Y”, etc). Members whose corresponding voting choice reaches 15% of total Stalk in favor will have their term extended by two quarters after the end of the current quarter, or extended to a maximum of three quarters after the end of the current quarter, whichever is shorter.\n\nBFC members can still be removed from the BFC in advance of the end of their term via a BFCP. BFCPs to remove a committee member should be titled “BFCP-X: Remove [Person] from the BFC” with “For” and “Against” as voting choices on the Snapshot proposal. The same BFCP voting period and quorum applies to proposals to remove a contributor from the BFC. BFSPs that were proposed by the removed BFC member are still valid.\n\n## Pre-Replant Pay\n\nThe payment information included in BFCPs and BFSPs will strictly cover payment for work from contributors after Beanstalk is Replanted. Of course, a Q3 Budget BIP must pass thereafter in order to fulfill these payments.\n\nOnce the Unripe Bean token is deployed, the BFC will have unilateral authority to distribute any of the 2,062,760.53269 Unripe Beans in the Beanstalk Farms multisig to compensate contributors who are not on the BFC for contributions pre-Replant. \n\nAfter Unripe Beans are distributed to non-BFC contributors at the discretion of the BFC, the initial set of BFC members will submit a proposal to get approval from the DAO to pay themselves Unripe Beans for their pre-Replant contributions. \n\nThis will be a one-time, special instance of a BFCP that grants the initial set of BFC members the power to pay themselves according to the Unripe Bean amount specified for each contributor in the proposal. This will be a multi-choice proposal where each voting choice corresponds to one of the initial BFC members. Members whose corresponding voting choice reaches 15% of Stalk in favor will receive the corresponding Unripe Bean payment outlined in the proposal for that BFC member.\n\n## Recap\n\nBFCPs will be proposed on the Beanstalk Farms Snapshot page alongside BFPs and BSPs. The proposal threshold on this page will be 0.1% of total Stalk.\n\nThere will be a handful of Snapshot pages that coordinate governance of Beanstalk, Beanstalk Farms, and Bean Sprout. There are no changes to the BIP proposal process but it is included in the table for completion.\n\nPlease see the table at the bottom of this Arweave document for a recap of who can propose each type of proposal, the voting period, how each proposal passes, etc.:\n\nhttps://arweave.net/qHvJ5YOH_r3QA1_U3M0rkBOkhkxHuNa8e53uNf1qno8\n",

The farming metaphor is helpful for explaining novel concepts. Selecting clear, distinct names for each component in Beanstalk is part of that effort. In that spirit, Beanstalk Farms proposes a handful of terminology changes to Beanstalk and its associated documentation.\n\nMost of these changes either require updates to documentation, the whitepaper and/or the Beanstalk UI. \n\nFormatting tables in Snapshot proposals has some rough edges, so the proposal with the full table of rationales for each term change can be found at this Arweave link: \n\nhttps://arweave.net/NjwRoYUfVVms2-y5BwI2cyKk8KgcXpxQNcmqZ4yUF6o\n\n|Previous term |New term &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |\n|--- |--- |\n|Rain|Downpour|\n|Season of Plenty|Flood|\n|N/A (Season where TWAP > 1)|Rainy Season|\n|N/A (Season where TWAP <= 1)|Dry Season|\n|Weather|Temperature|\n|Earned Seeds (previously Farmable Seeds on the pre-exploit UI)|Plantable Seeds|\n|Earn (previously Farm on the pre-exploit UI)|Plant|\n|Ripen (in Barn Raise context)|Chop|\n|N/A (pre-exploit Stalk that has vested)|Revitalized Stalk|\n|N/A (pre-exploit Stalk that has not vested)|Unrevitalized Stalk|\n|N/A (pre-exploit Seeds that have vested)|Revitalized Seeds|\n|N/A (pre-exploit Seeds that have not vested)|Unrevitalized Seeds|\n|N/A (Add Revitalized Stalk and Seeds to your Stalk and Seed balances)|Enroot|\n|N/A (Beans/LP underlying Unripe Beans/LP)|Ripe Beans/LP|\n|Whitelist|Add to Whitelist|\n|Dewhitelist|Remove from Whitelist|\n|Marketplace|Market|\n|Farmers’ Market|Pod Market|\n|Update (No previous term on the pre-exploit UI, Farm was the function that claimed both Grown Stalk and Farmable Seeds)|Mow|\n|Claim non-Deposited Unripe assets|Pick|\n|Unfertilized Beans|Sprouts|\n|Fertilized Beans|Fertilized Sprouts|\n|Claim Fertilized Sprouts|Rinse|\n|Wrapped/Internal Beans|Farm Beans|\n|Claimable Withdrawn Beans (timer has elapsed)|Receivable Beans|\n|Claimable Beans + Wrapped Beans|Farmable Beans|\n\nWith this new verbiage, it is more straightforward to create a taxonomy of different states that Beans can be in.

      "title": "BFP-77: Choose BEAN:3CRV A Parameter",
      "content": "# Proposer\n\nBeanstalk Farms\n\n# Summary\n\n* Set the A parameter on the BEAN:3CRV metapool to 1.\n\n# Proposal\n\nBefore the exploit on April 17, 2022, Beans were trading in 3 liquidity pools—BEAN:ETH on Uniswap V2, BEAN:3CRV on Curve (A parameter of 10), and BEAN:LUSD on Curve (A parameter of 100). Beans were only minted according to the deltaB in the BEAN:ETH pool.\n\nThe A parameter in a Curve pool affects the price movement at a given sized trade, relative to the size of the liquidity pool. A higher A parameter reduces price slippage on similar sized trades compared to a lower one. For Beanstalk, a high A parameter can create inefficiencies in the Convert and Field functionality.\n\nA high A parameter can significantly reduce the attractiveness of Converting in the Silo or Sowing Beans at a given price, as a given deltaB will result in a price much closer to peg than a constant product formula like Uniswap V2, where in A = 0. The profitability of Converting is a function of price deviations from the peg and trading fees. Until Beans are trading in a zero-fee DEX, the profitability of Convert must compensate for trading fees. Therefore, maintaining a high A parameter would likely diminish the effectiveness of Converting, and in turn its effect on peg maintenance. \n\nPrice deviations also influence behavior in the Field, as the Weather is denominated in Beans. The lower the Bean price, the higher your real rate of return is for Sowing Beans. A high A parameter could lead to a higher Weather being necessary to attract Sowers.\n\nThe following charts assume a pool of 10000 BEAN and 10000 3CRV, with a variable A parameter. This data scales linearly (_i.e._, X BEAN and X 3CRV in the pool). As A increases, so does the deltaB of the pool given the price. The highest jump can be seen from A = 0 to A = 1, with further increases in A resulting in a lower impact.\n \n![image](ipfs://QmQdCR7riBssAU4V9kc7c7xfY2zu8oyvkceSfy9wiK2A2A)\n\n![image](ipfs://QmdfWSdF2ocmwVo3pKefJU5NXPsseQ1KZr1MaxPbHByNjV)\n \n![image](ipfs://QmQDDJPd1LhztTnRvAM5F6P9e6FTN1BWa4ApiAuL23HF6J)\n    \nBecause Beanstalk was attacked shortly before generalized minting was implemented, Beanstalk has never minted Beans according to the deltaB of a Curve pool. Given that, it seems prudent to be conservative when choosing an A parameter. It is important to use the stableswap formula as a complementary tool for utility, rather than the main driver of stability. The A parameter can be changed in the future, but requires going through Curve governance.\n\nTherefore, Beanstalk Farms proposes deploying the Replant BEAN:3CRV pool with an A parameter of 1. \n\nNote: Liquidity that is recapitalized by the Barn Raise will be added to this pool at the ratio that would cause the deltaB to trend towards the pre-exploit deltaB in the Replant pool. At A = 1, the price at which liquidity is added at will be higher than the pre-exploit Bean price.\n\nYou can play around with the A parameter [here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jzoklx8wxo) and observe how it resembles the constant product formula more and more as the A parameter decreases. More graphs and calculations related to how different A parameters would affect Beanstalk can be found [here](https://github.com/BrianOlympus/Curveswap-Stuff).\n",

The regular minting schedule of 100% will resume about 4 days after Replant.\n\n**Code with this minting schedule is currently being audited.

Instead, if a signer gets through 2 months or 2 votes (**whichever happens first**, rather than whichever takes longer) without performing any of their signer duties, they will be removed from the BCM.\n\n**2)** In BFP-73, it was written that adding/removing/rotating multisig signers would require a Snapshot with a voting period that lasts 2 days.\n\nGiven the anonymous nature of the signers, Stalk holders shouldn’t be burdened with voting on adding/removing/rotating signers. Each time this occurs, Publius will announce in Discord that a change was made with a link to the new hashed list of signers on-chain.\n \n![Screen Shot 2022-06-10 at 1.43.48 PM.png](ipfs://QmXfghkP7pC1MxvzAkvdGKFkuZ8bJ76gGGFmNGqW6cBobV)\n    \n\n### Snapshot pages\n\nThis Snapshot page, [https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth), is the page where BFPs and BSPs are submitted. In general, these are related to budget and process decisions for Beanstalk Farms and Bean Sprout. Beanstalk was much smaller when this page was created, and thus the minimum Stalk required to propose a Snapshot was 2500 Stalk. This minimum will be changed to 25000 Stalk. Post-Replant, in order to allow enough time for people to vote, each Snapshot on this page will be for a minimum of 5 days (120 hours).\n\nThere is a new Snapshot page where BIPs will be proposed at [https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkdao.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkdao.eth). Only the BCM will be able to propose Snapshots on this page, per the process outlined in BFP-73. This is a measure taken to prevent BIP Snapshots from being proposed without associated GitHub merge requests. In an effort to promote a sufficiently permissionless proposal process, any community member who wishes to propose a BIP can follow the BIP Proposal Process from BFP-73.\n",

      "title": "Require Some Or All Multisig Signers To Be Revealed",
      "content": "BFP-73 proposes that a multisig should take over control of the admin functionality of Beanstalk, as currently Publius maintains sole control of the admin keys.\n\nHowever, the current proposal leads to all the signers of the multisig being anonymous and chosen by Publius. The community has raised concerns that there is no ability to verify the existence of these individuals, and must trust Publius both has not chosen sybil identities and can safely guard the identity of these individuals (since anonymity is the motivation for their proposal).\n\nThe team posturing that anonymous signers are of upmost importance, while having a doxxed entity (Publius) knowing **all** of the signers identities seems counterintuitive. The motivation behind anonymous signers is to be said to prevent entities such as governments to deploy malicious code to Beanstalk. However, this can lead to a scenario where said entity compels Publius to reveal the signers' identities without being able to inform anyone of the compromise. Now only the malicious entity knows of the identities and the community has no way to respond.\n\nThis proposal postures that some or all multisig signers should have their pseudonymous identities revealed, in order to provide transparency to the community on the legitimacy of the signers.\n\nFor example, if Silo Chad or Safisynai were to be chosen as signers, the community need not be concerned on their real identities. The community has engaged with these individuals enough to gain confidence in their real existence, and that they are not merely alternative identities of Publius/other signers.\n\nNOTE: Voting for the signers to be revealed DOES NOT mean the signers will be doxxed! Simply their community handles can be revealed, or if a business is one of the signers, simply their business name (e.g many multisigs in DeFi have investment funds as one of their signers).\n\nThere are options for different amount of signer identities being revealed (note that Publius is already considered a doxxed signer). For example if the community chooses \"50% - 1\" and the signers of the multisig are 7, then 2 new signers must have their identities revealed (as Publius counts as one of them, until he is removed)",

      "title": "BFP-73: Beanstalk Community Multisig",
      "content": "## Proposer\nBeanstalk Farms\n\n## Summary\n\n- Propose the process for the Beanstalk Community Multisig (BCM) — the multi-signature key holders of Beanstalk.\n- Going forward, BIPs will be voted on off-chain via Snapshot and will be executed on-chain by the BCM wallet.\n- Stalk holders will be able to vote on all BIPs via the Beanstalk Snapshot page.\n- Fertilizer funds will be custodied in the BCM until the Replanting.\n\nNote: ownership of Beanstalk will still be held by Publius until a BIP is proposed to transfer ownership of Beanstalk to the Beanstalk Community Multisig. \n\n**Vote**:\n_For_: Approve BCM process and structure\n_Against_: Publius retain ownership of the Beanstalk Contract\n\n## Overview\n**The BCM is not intended to have decision making power.** Its role is to 1) enact on-chain the decisions Stalk holders make via off-chain voting and 2) review and verify proposals to ensure the suggested changes are truthfully represented.\n\nThe BCM is deployed using [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/), the most battle-tested multisig contract on Ethereum. Its m-of-n configuration will start as 5-of-7 on Ethereum mainnet. Parameters n and m are each ultimately defined by Stalk holders and may evolve in the future via Snapshot vote. The BCM will add two signers to configure the multisig to be 5-of-9 signers prior to Beanstalk being Replanted.\n\nBCM’s Signers are an anonymous and diverse set of:\n\n- Reputable community members; and\n- Beanstalk core contributors.\n\nFertilizer funds will be custodied in the BCM until the Replanting.\n\n\n## Multisig Powers\nBeanstalk implements the [EIP-2535 Diamond Standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/2535), a new standard for fully-upgradeable smart contracts.\n\nThe mechanism for upgrading a Diamond is by calling [`diamondCut()`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535#the-diamondcut-function) which takes arguments of functions to replace and which functions to replace them with.\nUpon restart, the `diamondCut()` function will only be callable by the owner of Beanstalk, which will be the BCM.\n\nUpgrades should only be executed after a Snapshot has passed and signers have manually reviewed the code changes. However, in the case of an emergency, the BCM may execute transactions to protect the Beanstalk contract. The best practices for emergency response handling are outlined in the Emergency Response Procedures section.\n\nIf a community member wants to propose a BIP, they can submit a merge request to the [Beanstalk Github repo](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk) and begin a formal process with the BCM outlined in the Proposing a BIP section.\n\nIn addition to `diamondCut()`, the following functions are also only callable from the owner address:\n\n- `pause()` - when executed, Beanstalk will be paused and the `sunrise()` function will not be allowed to be called in the contract\n- `unpause()` - when executed, Beanstalk will be unpaused and the `sunrise()` function will again be allowed to be called at the top of the 2nd hour. The TWAP oracle will be reset as well.\n- `transferOwnership()` - transfer ownership permissions of the Beanstalk contract to a new address\n- `diamondCut()` - add/replace/remove any function(s) and/or execute an init function with a delegatecall\n- `createFundraiser()` - creates a Fundraiser\n- `whitelistToken()` - add a token to the Silo whitelist\n- `dewhitelistToken()` - remove a token from the Silo whitelist\n\n## Snapshot\nThe BCM is an extension of the Beanstalk DAO. As such, BCM’s role is to 1) enact on-chain the decisions Stalk holders make via off-chain voting and 2) review and verify proposals to ensure the suggested changes are truthfully represented.\n\nThe BCM shall not execute transactions until an associated Snapshot successfully passes in favor of the proposal, except in the case of emergency or canceling a failed transaction. Below are the scenarios the BCM will adhere to when transacting:\n\n \n![bfp73.png](ipfs://QmSmute3PxXyyTMUEgRhvT6foRoA25YTXpx97NoCvRVmzx)\n    \n\n## Proposing a BIP\nBeanstalk's governance is designed to be as censorship resistant as possible. In an effort to promote sufficiently permissionless processes, any community member may submit BIPs after Beanstalk is Replanted. If a community member wishes to propose a BIP, they will need to complete a public proposal process on Discord and submit a Github MR before the BCM will submit a Snapshot on their behalf.\n\n### BIP Proposal Process:\nBIPs consist of two things: a merge request on the public Beanstalk Github repo, and a written explanation of the changes that would be implemented by the merge request.\n\nThe following are the processes in place for community members to submit a BIP and coordinate with the BCM to submit a Snapshot proposal.\n\n1. The proposer will submit a merge request on the public Beanstalk Github repo and publish the written proposal in a dedicated channel in the Beanstalk Discord. For assistance creating a channel on Discord, contact JWW or any other member of Beanstalk Farms’ Community or Operations teams.\n2. The written proposal shall be discussed in the Discord channel for a sufficient amount of time. What constitutes sufficient will be at the sole discretion of the BCM, but the BCM must formally propose the BIP on-chain within 2 weeks of the creation of the dedicated Discord channel, unless the proposer decides to withdraw their proposal.\n3. BCM key holders shall verify that they have access to their wallets.\n4. The BCM will submit a Snapshot of the written proposal and a corresponding on-chain transaction to formally begin the Voting Period.\n5. During the Snapshot Voting Period (1-7 days), every BCM Signer shall verify the transaction and write an etherscan message confirming their review according to the process outlined in the Reviewing and Signing off on Transactions section. Each Signer is expected to verify every transaction. However, if not all Signers verify the transaction, the BCM may still continue per the process outlined in the Rotating Holders In/Out section.\n6. If the Snapshot passes, the Signers will sign n/m signatures and execute the transaction on-chain as soon as possible. If the Snapshot fails, the Signers will submit and execute a cancel transaction with the same nonce as soon as possible.\n\n## Voting for BIPs\nVoting for BIPs will take place on Snapshot, using Stalk ownership at the time of proposal on Snapshot. Any Stalk holder can vote for or against any Snapshot proposal. In all instances, 1 Stalk equals 1 vote, and voting against a proposal is equivalent to abstaining.\n\nThe Snapshot Voting Period opens when a BIP is submitted to Snapshot and closes after 7 days or once a two-thirds supermajority is reached. In order to be counted, all votes must be signed before the Voting Period closes.\n\nIf at the end of the Voting Period:\n\n- Less than or equal to half of the total outstanding Stalk at the time of proposal on Snapshot votes in favor of the BIP, the BIP fails; or\n- More than half of the total outstanding Stalk at the time of proposal on Snapshot votes in favor of the BIP, the BIP passes.\n\nIf at any time 24 hours or more after the opening and before the closing of the Voting Period more than two-thirds of the total outstanding Stalk votes in favor of a BIP, the BCM can execute the BIP on-chain.\n\nThe BCM shall follow the results of the Snapshot, unless the Stalk distribution is compromised in a flash loan or other governance attack.\n\n## BCM Best Practices\nBCM Signers shall follow the best practices outlined below. It is of paramount importance that Beanstalk limits key man risk by implementing best practices with respect to multisig custody. Signers are expected to:\n\n1. Regularly check in with the BCM and confirm access to their wallet;\n2. Maintain active communication regarding travel plans and availability in order to ensure that there are always enough Signers on call;\n3. Regularly rotate Signer wallets every 2-3 months, subject to Snapshot voting; and\n4. Acknowledge their Signer duties and processes for signing off on BIPs.\n\nIn addition to the above expectations, Signers shall follow the BCM’s wallet security best practices:\n\n1. Use a reputable hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger;\n2. Use a fresh wallet that doesn't have any pre-existing transactions or balances on it;\n3. Set up a new passphrase on their hardware wallet device when selecting a new wallet to be the signing wallet; and\n4. Follow the standard self-custody best practice guide [here](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/11/27/10-rules-for-the-secure-use-of-cryptocurrency-hardware-wallets/).\n\n## Signer Duties\nSigners are expected to follow best practices and maintain active communication in order to ensure that there are always enough Signers available to execute transactions in case of an emergency. Signer duties are broken down into three stages: 1) confirming access to their wallet, 2) verifying proposed code changes, and 3) executing transactions on the BCM Gnosis wallet.\n\nWhen a draft BIP is proposed, every Signer shall be notified of the timeline and shall confirm access to their wallet.\n\nOnce a Snapshot is proposed, all Signers are expected to promptly review and verify that the proposed code changes are accurately represented. After a Signer has followed the guide laid out in the Reviewing and Signing off on Transactions section, they will submit and sign an etherscan message that publicly confirms their review. This will 1) limit blind signing and 2) encourage each Signer to verify that a BIP’s code changes are accurately represented and distributed to the public. The steps to create and verify a signature on etherscan can be found [here](https://info.etherscan.com/verify-signature-tool/). Anyone can verify that the Signer reviewed and signed off on the proposed code changes during the Voting Period.\n\nSigners will sign the transaction to either execute the proposed transaction or cancel it as soon as possible following the conclusion of the Voting Period.\n\nOnce sufficient signatures have been provided to execute the transaction, is it expected that one of the signers execute the transaction. Upon Unpause, Publius shall initially execute the transaction and pay for gas fees. After Beanstalk Unpauses and signers are more comfortable, Publius or Beanstalk Farms shall distribute enough ETH to every signer to execute a transaction in case of emergency. Signers are not expected to contribute capital to participate in the BCM.\n\nA Signer shall lose their role (by action of the remaining signers removing them) in case they:\n\n- Act against Stalk holders’ off-chain voting;\n- Do not follow best practices outlined in the BCM Best Practices section; or\n- Got through 2 months or 2 votes (whichever takes longer) without performing any of their signer duties.\n\n## Emergency Response Procedures\nThe BCM’s role is to 1) enact on-chain the decisions Stalk holders make via off-chain voting and 2) review and verify proposals to ensure the suggested changes are truthfully represented. However, if a situation arises in the future like the April 17th, 2022 exploit of Beanstalk, it is of critical importance that the BCM take swift action to protect Beanstalk.\n\n**Depending on the severity of a given emergency, BCM members shall swiftly decide the best course of action:**\n\n- If an emergency is severe and requires significant code changes to fix, the BCM will Pause Beanstalk and take any necessary extra action to mitigate further damage; or\n- If an emergency is minor and does not require significant code changes, an emergency hotfix may be implemented by an emergency vote of the BCM.\n- \n**After emergency action is taken, the BCM shall swiftly issue a summarized report to the community detailing:**\n\n1. the administrative permissions that were used (e.g. Pausing Beanstalk or turning off certain functions);\n2. the context and severity of the issue; and\n3. the next steps and decisions, if any, that the community must agree on in order for Beanstalk to proceed.\n\n## Reviewing and Signing off on Transactions\nEveryone on the BCM shall be expected to know how to verify diamond cut data and submit an etherscan transaction confirming they have checked the submitted transaction. Until Beanstalk is Unpaused for the first time after the exploit, Signers are not required to verify each transaction, but doing so is strongly encouraged.\n\nAs a part of submitting BIPs, the proposer will be responsible for providing thorough documentation or supplementary video to the Beanstalk DAO and BCM for how to review/test all relevant code.\n\nThe following should be used as a guide for the minimum review criteria:\n\n- Check function call is as expected\n    - If function is diamondCut,\n    - confirm Facet Cuts–check Facet address, function selectors and Facet Cut actions are correct\n- Check init address and calldata are correct\n- Test BIP on mainnet fork or testnet as necessary\n- Review conceptual changes involved in BIP\n- Review Github MR change log (naming or other small nits)\n- Review constants (contract addresses, numbers) in new contracts\n\nOnce signers have verified the transaction, they shall submit and sign a [verified etherscan message](https://info.etherscan.com/verify-signature-tool/) and distribute the public verification link to the BCM.\n\n### Problems During Verification\nThe BCM will never submit a transaction that was misrepresented on Snapshot.\n\nIn the case that any signer during the verification process determines that a MR does not accurately represent the BIP, that signer will submit a verified etherscan message indicating as such with context on the issue. At that point, the BCM will not submit the transaction unless it is determined that the Signer is \"rogue\" and is attempting to censor the BIP. In the case the other Signers determine that one or more Signers is rogue, they will submit a verified etherscan message indicating as such. At that point all present key holders shall submit a new verified etherscan message to cancel the original transaction.\n\nThe BCM will notify the community via Discord and work with the proposer to resolve the issue in the MR. Once resolved, a new BIP will be proposed on Snapshot with its associated transaction\n\n## Read More \n\nDue to the Snapshot character limit the full proposal has been cut off.

      "content": "## Proposer\n\nBeanstalk Farms\n\n## Summary\n\n* Continue with the timeline of starting the Barn Raise on June 6 and Unpausing Beanstalk in early July.\n* Extend the end of the Barn Raise indefinitely until all Barn Raise tokens are sold. The Barn Raise would continue while Beanstalk is Unpaused if there are unsold tokens.\n* No haircuts. All Beans, BDV of LP, Stalk, and Seeds are subject to a vesting schedule. \n\n## Problem\n\nThe [current plan approved by the DAO](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0xa038d205e72ae3a835995682b18adf9512777ed554c388a7caa5bc4e98d4f8e0) only allows participation in the Barn Raise until June 27, before the Unpause. A consequence of this is that if the Barn Raise recapitalizes less than $77M of the liquidity, pre-exploit Bean, LP and Pod holders would take a haircut proportional to the amount of funds raised. Before this new proposal, this seemed to be a necessary sacrifice.\n\nBetween the macroeconomic environment and the collapse of Terra, the market is incredibly weak right now. Beanstalk should be able to operate under adverse conditions if it wants to be the ubiquitous stablecoin issuer of DeFi. Instead of being conservative, and having Beanstalk shrink significantly, only to quickly grow back to the size it was prior to the attack—with the right plan, it makes sense to be aggressive, turn Beanstalk back on without any haircut, and instead let the model perform in adverse circumstances, both exogenous and endogenous. \n\n\n## Solution\n\nRather than end the Barn Raise on June 27, let the Barn Raise run indefinitely until all the Barn Raise tokens (Fertilizer) are sold. Beanstalk would still Unpause in early July and the Barn Raise would continue running in tandem, assuming not all the Fertilizer is sold by then. Funds raised from Fertilizer sales post-Unpause will still recapitalize non-Bean liquidity. \n\n\n### No Haircuts\n\nIn this new proposal, there would be no haircut for any pre-exploit Bean, LP or Pod holders. Beans, LP, Stalk and Seeds are subject to a vesting schedule. At the time of Unpause, 100% of the Beans and BDV of LP positions would be distributed in their Unripe state. \n\nStalk and Seeds will be distributed based on the percentage of Fertilizer sold, and the rest of Stalk and Seeds balances will vest as more Fertilizer is sold. Pods stay the same as pre-exploit.\n\n> As an example, if 20% of Fertilizer is sold before Unpause, pre-exploit balances of:\n>\n> 1000 Beans, 2000 BDV of LP, 4000 Stalk, 12000 Seeds, and 20000 Pods,\n>\n> would then become the following when Beanstalk Unpauses:\n>\n> 1000 _Unripe_ Beans, 2000 BDV of _Unripe_ LP, 800 Stalk, 2400 Seeds, and 20000 Pods.\n\n\n### Vesting\n\nAll pre-exploit Beans and LP will become _Unripe Beans_ and _Unripe LP_ respectively upon Unpause. Unripe assets represent a pro rata share of the underlying assets minted as debt to Fertilizer holders is repaid. Ripening is the process of converting Unripe Beans into Beans, or Unripe LP into LP. Unripe assets are subject to a vesting schedule.\n\nIn the previous proposal, the vesting schedule for Unripe assets was solely based on the percentage of debt repaid to Fertilizer holders—if 20% of the debt had been repaid, 100 Unripe Beans could ripen into 20 Beans, with a penalty of 80%.\n\nNow, Unripe assets can ripen based on the product of the two following values: the percentage of funds raised and the amount of that debt repaid. \n\n> As an example, if 20% of total Fertilizer has sold and 30% of the debt issued for Fertilizer has been repaid, then the penalty for Unripe Beans ripening to Beans is _1 - (20% * 30%) = 94%_.\n>\n>If the 100% of total Fertilizer has sold and 50% of the debt issued for Fertilizer has been repaid, then the penalty for Unripe Beans ripening to Beans is _1 - (100% * 50%) = 50%_.\n>\n>These examples work the same way for Unripe LP.\n\nThe vesting for pre-exploit Stalk and Seeds is a bit different. Stalk and Seeds simply unlock based on the percentage of Fertilizer that has been sold. This makes the Silo a more attractive destination for new Silo Members early on post-Unpause. As Stalk and Seeds vest, they need to be manually claimed to become active. \n\n>As an example, if 20% of total Fertilizer has sold before Unpause, Silo Members receive 20% of their Stalk and Seed balances upon Unpause. Once 50% of total Fertilizer has sold, Silo Members can manually claim an additional 30%, bringing their total to 50% of their pre-exploit Stalk and Seed balances.\n\n\n### Forfeited Assets\n\nAs mentioned above, assets that are ripened before all Fertilizer is sold and all Fertilizer is paid back are subject to a penalty and forfeited.\n\nIn the previous proposal, forfeited assets were effectively distributed to all other Unripe asset holders such that they could end up being recapitalized in excess of their initial balances. Now that the Barn Raise will continue post-Unpause, it seems preferable that the forfeiture instead lessen the amount of funds needed to be raised in the first place [1].\n\n>As an example, if there’s $50M to be raised from Fertilizer, and someone with 2M BDV of Unripe LP forfeits with a 50% penalty (getting 1M BDV and forfeiting a claim to 1M BDV in the process), only $49.5M more of Fertilizer has to be sold. This is because 1M BDV is forfeited, and half of that value is non-Bean liquidity, so $500k less Fertilizer needs to be sold.\n>\n>The above only plays out if LP is forfeited, because it’s the liquidity that is being recapitalized by Fertilizer sales. If someone forfeits Beans, that just makes the Unripe Beans vest earlier.\n\n\n### Fertilizer (Barn Raise Tokens)\n\n**Token standard**\n\nIn the previous proposal, each Barn Raise token began earning Bean mints in parallel starting at the time of Unpause. The supply of Barn Raise tokens became fixed upon Unpause, with each token earning a pro rata share of new Bean mints until repaid. ERC-721 worked well in this case.\n\nIn this new proposal, Fertilizer tokens will have different states, as each may have a different number of Beans mints owed to them. To prevent excess gas costs for computing all of these different states, Fertilizer will instead be ERC-1155 semi-fungible tokens. Fertilizer will be fungible within a Season and non-fungible across Seasons. OpenSea supports ERC-1155 tokens.\n\n**Minimum participation size**\n\nIn the previous proposal, 15,400 NFTs were going to be sold for 5000 USDC each. This was a tradeoff made given that each additional NFT has a non-zero cost to mint. Thus, the lower the NFT price, the more gas each person has to use. 5000 USDC struck a good balance between NFT price and gas efficiency.\n\nERC-1155 tokens require no additional gas when minting multiple tokens in the same Season. Because lowering the minimum has no effect, there will now be 77M Fertilizer for sale at 1 USDC each.\n\n**Bean mints and Humidity**\n\nSince the Barn Raise will continue post-Unpause, it seems prudent to change the name of the interest rate for Fertilizer to distinguish it from the Weather in the Field. The interest rate on Fertilizer will be Humidity.\n\n>As an example, 1000 Fertilizer purchased at 500% Humidity with 1000 USDC would stop earning Beans after 6000 Beans.\n\nLike before, Beanstalk will borrow up to $77M from lenders in the Barn Raise (now in the form of 77M Fertilizer), and Fertilizer purchased before the Unpause will have a 500% Humidity.\n\nThe Humidity will change post-Unpause. During the first Season post-Unpause, the Humidity will start at 250% and decrease by 0.5% every Season until the Humidity is 20%. This will take about 20 days post-Unpause to hit the minimum Humidity of 20%.\n\nThere are 3 states Fertilizer can be in:\n* If Fertilizer is not sold yet, it’s Available.\n* If Fertilizer is owed Bean mints, it’s Active. Active Fertilizer receives one-third of new Bean mints.\n* If Fertilizer is done earning Bean mints, it’s Used.\n\nIt’s important to consider all of these incentives in tandem. From a Humidity perspective, the concept is to reward early participation in the Barn Raise, but have the reward drop off quickly, such that demand for Soil and the Silo increases as Fertilizer becomes less attractive (both in terms of Humidity and the number of Active Fertilizer).\n\nIt is expected that if Beanstalk is successful long term, even 20% Humidity would eventually be attractive based on the number of Active Fertilizer. If there’s no Active Fertilizer and there’s still Fertilizer to be sold, someone can buy Fertilizer and earn the entire one-third of Bean mints allocated to Active Fertilizer.\n\nThe vesting schedule tied to the product of Fertilizer sold and Fertilizer paid back minimizes the new supply from vesting assets even in the instance there are extended periods of minimal demand for Fertilizer. \n\n**Artwork**\n\nBecause ERC-1155 tokens are being used, any art would have to be the same for all tokens minted in the same Season. This also means the art would be the same for all tokens minted before the Unpause.\n\nAs a result, in addition to Fertilizer (the ERC-1155 tokens), separate ERC-721 NFTs with distinct artwork will be available for mint for addresses that participate in the Barn Raise prior to Beanstalk Unpausing. The minimum participation size for getting an NFT is 1000 USDC, and these NFTs are limited to the first 10,000 transactions of at least that minimum.\n\nMinting of the NFTs will be optional to minimize gas costs to participate in the Barn Raise.\n\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis proposal:\n* Leans into the strength of the mechanism that got Beanstalk to this point by not scaling the system down with a haircut;\n* Makes pre-exploit Farmers whole over time; and\n* Lowers the amount of capital needed to make pre-exploit Farmers whole.\n\nIf Beanstalk Unpauses before Fertilizer sells out and Silo Members Convert from Unripe LP to Unripe Beans when P &lt; 1, then the amount of recapitalized liquidity required to make everyone whole decreases (because the liquidity is decreasing). \n\nVice versa, if Beanstalk Unpauses before Fertilizer sells out and Silo Members Convert from Unripe Beans to Unripe LP when P > 1, then the amount of recapitalized liquidity required to make everyone whole increases (because the liquidity is increasing). This is acceptable as this scenario only plays out when P > 1 (a good problem to have) [2].\n\nThe forfeiture of Unripe LP during the vesting schedule also reduces the amount of liquidity that needs to be raised, and thus the amount of Fertilizer for sale. \n\nIt’s important to acknowledge that this proposed version of the Barn Raise is higher risk. The Pod Rate would be higher post-Unpause without a haircut. For example, if 25% of the Fertilizer was sold pre-Unpause, Beanstalk would Unpause with a Pod Rate 4x higher than the pre-exploit value [3].\n\nThis proposed structure doubles down on the core economic mechanism that got Beanstalk to this point. It is up to the market to decide if Beanstalk deserves to exist—and these endogenous circumstances give Beanstalk the opportunity to prove itself even more in the midst of exogenous market turmoil.\n\n## Notes\n\n[1] There are edge cases where it is still possible for someone to receive >100% of their pre-exploit balance. This could happen if half the amount forfeited LP exceeds the amount left to be raised from Fertilizer sales. For example, if there is no Fertilizer left to be sold and then someone forfeits their Unripe LP, anyone who doesn’t ripen until 100% of the debt to Fertilizer holders is repaid will receive >100% of their pre-exploit balance.\n\n[2] The ceiling on the amount of Fertilizer for sale would be the amount of liquidity if all Unripe Beans were Converted to Unripe LP.\n\n[3] The post-Unpause Pod Rate would be the inverse of the proportion of the capital raised through the Barn Raise pre-Unpause times the pre-exploit Pod Rate.\n\n## Glossary\n\n**Unripe Beans**: An ERC-20 token that entitles pre-exploit Bean holders to a pool of vesting Beans. These vesting Beans are minted as debt to Fertilizer holders is repaid.\n\n**Unripe LP**: Same as Unripe Beans but for LP.\n\n**Barn Raise**: Beanstalk’s ongoing effort to recapitalize its pre-exploit non-Bean liquidity.\n\n**Fertilizer**: Tokens offered by Beanstalk throughout the Barn Raise that receive one-third of new Bean mints.\n\n**Humidity**: The interest rate for Fertilizer. Like the _Weather_, this changes depending on the state of Beanstalk.\n\n**BDV**: Bean-denominated value.\n",

      "content": "Proposer:\nBeanstalk Farms\n\nSummary:\n• Beanstalk will host the Barn Raise, a fundraiser to restore up to $77M in non-Bean liquidity stolen from the Silo, taking place from June 6 to June 27.\n• NFTs Beanstalk issues during the Barn Raise will receive a pro rata share of one-third of new Bean mints until a 500% Weather is repaid.\n• One-third of future Bean mints will go towards the NFT holders, one-third to Stalk holders, and one-third to the existing Pod Line. When the debt to the NFT holders has been repaid, the normal minting schedule will resume.\n• The state of pre-exploit Beanstalk assets will be scaled as a function of the percent of the Barn Raise that is filled. This applies to Beans, Stalk, Seeds, BDV in the Silo and Pods.\n• Any assets that are recapitalized (Deposited, Withdrawn, Claimable, Circulating) during the Barn Raise will be subject to a vesting schedule based on the percent of the new debt that has been repaid. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProblem:\nFrom Day 1, Beanstalk has been owned solely by members of the Beanstalk DAO via a decentralized, on-chain governance structure. Unfortunately, a bad actor exploited that very structure on April 17 to steal all Silo assets, including ~$77M in non-Bean liquidity. This was an attack on Beanstalk's governance model, not its economic design.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProposed Solution:\n\nThe Barn Raise\n\nBeanstalk Farms proposes having Beanstalk host the Barn Raise – a fundraiser to restore up to $77M in non-Bean liquidity stolen from the Silo – beginning on Monday, June 6 at 4:00pm UTC and ending on Monday June 27 at 4:00pm UTC. \n\nDuring the Barn Raise, Beanstalk will borrow up to $77M from lenders in exchange for debt at 500% Weather. To facilitate this, Beanstalk will launch The Barn Raise Collection, an NFT collection with 15,400 items that sell for 5000 USDC each during the Barn Raise, raising up to $77M for Beanstalk’s recapitalization. Each NFT holder will receive a pro rata share of one-third of new Bean mints until a 500% Weather has been realized. Both OTC investors and the community will get the same terms.\n\nNFT rarity will increase with earlier participation in the Barn Raise period. There will also be a rarity boost for BeaNFT holders and participants who have previously interacted with Beanstalk. Details on the art and rarity to come over the next couple weeks. \n\nLarge participants who make OTC commitments prior to the official Barn Raise launch will not receive preferential access to rare NFT traits. In the instance that an OTC commitment has been formally made, but on-chain participation is difficult in a timely manner, Beanstalk Farms will allocate the appropriate amount of NFTs to prevent the sale from being oversubscribed.  \n\nUnpausing Beanstalk\n\nAfter the Barn Raise concludes and both the Halborn and Trail of Bits audits complete, Beanstalk can be Unpaused. Between now and then, satisfactory governance measures outlined in The Path Forward document (https://bean.money/blog/path-forward) will be put in place.\n\nOnce Beanstalk is Unpaused, one-third of future Bean mints will go towards the NFT holders, one-third to Stalk holders, and one-third to the existing Pod Line. After the debt to NFT holders is fully repaid, the new Bean mint schedule will revert to Beanstalk's original one-half Silo and one-half existing Pod Line allocation.\n\nCapital used to purchase NFTs during the Barn Raise will be used to recapitalize stolen funds pro rata to the Silo. The protocol will scale its obligations based on the amount of capital raised. This means that if X% of the ~$77M is raised, participants will receive X% of their pre-exploit Beans, Stalk, Seeds, BDV in Silo, and Pods. Beanstalk will Unpause with the pre-exploit Weather. The attacker’s balances prior to the exploit will be removed.\n\nSilo Members and Bean holders’ recapitalized assets (Beans, Stalk, Seeds, BDV in Silo) will be placed under a vesting schedule based on the percentage debt repaid to NFT holders. If these users choose to Claim their recapitalized assets before the debt has been fully repaid, they will face a haircut proportional to the amount of the debt repaid. For example, if a Silo Member decides to Claim their recapitalized assets and 50% of the debt has been repaid, they will forfeit their rights to 50% of those assets. Farmable Beans earned from new mints after Unpause are not subject to this vesting schedule.\n\nWhile raising the full $77M is a sufficient – and ideal – condition of a successful Barn Raise, it is not a necessary one. Because this process is designed to scale the protocol based on the size of the Barn Raise, Beanstalk will be able to Unpause with an arbitrary amount of new liquidity. In practice, raising $0 is the equivalent of restarting Beanstalk from scratch. Therefore, any amount raised is better than nothing. However, at the time of writing, there are confirmed commitments for ~20% of the $77M.\n\nBeanstalk is scheduled to Unpause in early July, pending the completion of the two audits.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRationale:\nUnlike every other non-collateralized stablecoin in history, Beanstalk’s economic model has not failed. Before its governance mechanism was exploited, Beanstalk demonstrated that it can go through growth and contraction periods while still returning to peg. Beanstalk, however, cannot continue in its state prior to the governance attack on April 17.\n\nBeanstalk Farms and the broader Beanstalk community are keen to bring Beanstalk’s key stablecoin innovations to every corner of DeFi, in spite of the attack. A successful Barn Raise is the best path to achieving that.\n",

However, Beanstalk needs DAO approval of the OTC transaction terms to begin accepting capital beyond soft commitments.\n\nFurthermore, it has become clear that most investors are interested in recapitalizing Beanstalk under the condition that Beanstalk Unpauses after the audits from Halborn and Trail of Bits are complete. These audits are expected to complete in late June, and Beanstalk could Unpause shortly thereafter in late June or early July. Note, the earliest Beanstalk could Unpause without audits would be early June due to development work.\n\nThus, the following terms are being proposed:\n  • Beanstalk will borrow up to $77M from lenders in exchange for debt at 500% Weather.\n  • Lenders will receive a fungible token that earns a pro rata share of one-third of new Bean mints until the debt is repaid.\n  • Beanstalk will Unpause after the audits with Halborn and Trail of Bits are complete.\n\nUnder these terms, there are confirmed commitments for ~15% of the $77M, and additional capital sources have demonstrated demand in excess of the remaining 85%. The terms outlined above are available to any DAO or outside source of capital that is interested in recapitalizing Beanstalk.\n\nBeanstalk Farms believes that running the Barn Raise in parallel with an OTC deal would be a strategic misstep. Given the level of demand that the OTC structure has garnered thus far, Beanstalk Farms proposes postponing the Barn Raise until after the current negotiations are completed, if the full $77M has not already been raised.\n\nBeanstalk Farms, Bean Sprout and Publius believe that this proposal puts Beanstalk in the best possible position to maximize the amount of liquidity that is recapitalized while delaying the relaunch date by a marginal amount of time.\n\n",

      "content": "Proposer:\nBeanstalk Farms\n\nSummary:\nBeanstalk Farms proposes changing the start of the Barn Raise from Monday, May 2 at 4:00pm UTC to Monday, May 9 at 4:00pm UTC.\n\nReasoning:\nThe immediate goal of Beanstalk Farms is to recapitalize and safely relaunch Beanstalk.\n\nSince the exploit on April 17, Beanstalk Farms, Bean Sprout and Publius have had many conversations with capital sources about participating in the Barn Raise. Some of these discussions have indicated strong interest in negotiating an OTC deal with the DAO as part of Beanstalk’s recapitalization effort.\n\nIt’s uncertain whether these conversations will ultimately alter the process outlined in The Path Forward (https://bean.money/blog/path-forward), but Beanstalk Farms believes that allowing sufficient time for these conversations to transpire will maximize the amount of liquidity that Beanstalk is able to recapitalize prior to Unpausing. Beanstalk Farms thinks that this is a good problem to have and is excited to see that there may be multiple paths forward for Beanstalk.\n\nAs a result, Beanstalk Farms believes that it is in the best interest of the DAO to move the start of the Barn Raise back one week to Monday, May 9 at 4:00pm UTC. \n\nNote that this Snapshot is only meant to allow for more time for these conversations to mature and it does not indicate any terms or commitments. Should any of these conversations with capital sources materialize into a deal to help recapitalize Beanstalk, it would be presented to the DAO in the form of a Snapshot and would be voted on as such.",

Kuna returned the funds to Beanstalk Farms on April 24 (https://etherscan.io/tx/0xda56cdb1c9acc01e0ba87fb592384a030b0526baa624256fee79a2df334c7e00). \n\nAfter paying Halborn to perform an audit, 50,000 USDC is leftover from the funds initially reserved for the Omniscia retainer. Thus, Beanstalk Farms currently holds 300,000 USDC.\n\nDue to the governance attack and subsequently stolen liquidity, the Beans allocated to Beanstalk Farms’ Q2 Budget are worthless. As a result, Beanstalk currently lacks the necessary funds to retain high-quality service providers who can help ensure a safe, secure and defensible Unpause post-Barn Raise. \n\nAllocation of funds will include a number of organizational initiatives in the following areas, among others:\n• Security infrastructure\n• DAO operational expenses\n• Strategic contributors\n\nProposed Budget:\nAll 300,000 USDC remaining.\n",

      "content": "Proposer:\nBeanstalk Farms\n\nSummary:\n- Beanstalk will host the Barn Raise, a public ten-day fundraiser to restore up to ~$77M in non-Bean liquidity stolen from the Silo. \n- Pods Beanstalk issues during the Barn Raise will become Harvestable on a FIFO basis based on a new Barn Raise Pod Line (BR Pod Line).\n- One-third of future Bean mints will go towards the BR Pod Line, one-third to Stalk holders, and one-third to the existing Pod Line. When the entire BR Pod Line has Harvested, the normal minting schedule will resume.\n- The state of pre-exploit Beanstalk assets will be scaled as a function of the percent of the Barn Raiser that is filled. This applies to Beans, Stalk, Seeds, BDV in the Silo and Pods.\n- Any assets that are recapitalized (Deposited Beans, Deposited LP Tokens and circulating Beans) during the Barn Raise will be subject to a vesting schedule based on the percent of the BR Pod Line that has Harvested. \n- The attacker’s balances prior to the exploit will be removed.\n\nProblem:\nGovernance Exploit\nFrom Day 1, Beanstalk has been owned solely by members of the Beanstalk DAO via a decentralized, on-chain governance structure. Unfortunately, a bad actor exploited that very structure on April 17 to steal all Silo assets, including ~$77M in non-Bean liquidity. This was an attack on Beanstalk's governance model, not its economic design.\n\nProposed Solution:\nThe Barn Raise\nBeanstalk Farms proposes having Beanstalk host the Barn Raise – a public ten-day fundraiser to restore up to ~$77M in non-Bean liquidity stolen from the Silo – beginning on May 2. The Barn Raise will consist of two phases: (1) a seven-day Bidding Period, followed by (2) a three-day Sowing Period. Any Ethereum wallet will be able to lend to Beanstalk during the Barn Raise via the BR Pod Line. There will be ~77M Soil available during the Barn Raise, meaning that a maximum of ~$77M can be Sown before the Barn Raise ends.\n\nThe Bidding Period\nBetween 4:00pm UTC on 5/2 and 3:59pm UTC on 5/9, participants will have the option to submit Bids for Pods — Beanstalk's native debt asset — using two parameters:\n\n1. The Weather (interest rate) for Sowing (lending to Beanstalk); and\n2. The size of the Bid, denominated in another USD-pegged stablecoin token.\n\nWhen Bidding, the assets to be Sown are locked in at the time of submission. Bids will not be cancellable once submitted, but may be updated to lower the Weather.\n\nBids placed earlier in the Bidding Period will receive a bonus. The bonus for submitting a Bid will start at 21% on Day 1 of the Bidding Period and decrease by 3% per day until the end of the Bidding Period. The bonus will decrease at 4:00pm UTC. Updating a Bid resets the bonus. The bonus will be added to the Weather. For example, a $100 Bid for 120% with a 21% bonus would yield 100 * (100 + 120 + 21) = 241 Pods.\n\nDuring the Sowing period, Bids will be auto-filled when the Bid's Weather is reached, given there is Soil available. Bids will be partially fillable. \n\nBids at the same Weather are Sown in the order in which they were received, meaning earlier Bids at a given Weather have priority in the BR Pod Line. Bids placed at or below 20% Weather will automatically be Sown when the Sowing Period begins, and be ordered by Weather first and time second.\n\nThe Sowing Period\nAt 4:00pm UTC on 5/9, the Weather (interest rate) will start at 20% and increase by 1% every 10 minutes for the duration of the Sowing Period, which will end after three days or when the Soil reaches 0 -- whichever occurs first.\n\nEach time the Weather increases, the Bids at the new Weather will be auto-filled and placed in the BR Pod Line, so long as there is available Soil. Bids that are not successfully filled during the Sowing Period will be claimable after Beanstalk is Unpaused. \n\nParticipants can Sow at any time during the Sowing Period, so long as there is available Soil. Sows will clear based on the Weather at the time of the Sow. \n\nBeanstalk Reseeding\nAfter the Sowing Period concludes, there will be a brief interlude prior to Unpausing Beanstalk, during which core contributors and the community will ensure that satisfactory governance and safety measures are in place. \n\nThe timeline for Beanstalk to be Unpaused will be determined by a subsequent Snapshot vote. Given that the results of the Barn Raise would be expected to meaningfully influence the vote, the Snapshot will be proposed after the completion of the Barn Raise. \n\nOnce Beanstalk is Unpaused, one-third of future Bean mints will go towards the BR Pod Line, one-third to Stalk holders, and one-third to the existing Pod Line. The BR Pod Line, like the existing Pod Line, will be repaid on a FIFO basis. After the BR Pod Line completely Harvests, the new Bean mint schedule will revert to Beanstalk's original one-half Silo and one-half existing Pod Line allocation.\n\nCapital Sown during the Barn Raise will be used to recapitalize stolen funds pro rata to the Silo. The protocol will scale its obligations based on the amount of capital raised. This means that if X% of the ~$77M is raised, participants will receive X% of their pre-exploit Beans, Stalk, Seeds, BDV in Silo, and Pods. Beanstalk will Unpause with the pre-exploit Weather.\n\nSilo Members and Bean holders’ recapitalized assets (Beans, Stalk, Seeds, BDV in Silo) will be placed under a vesting schedule based on the percentage of the BR Pod Line that has become Harvestable. If these users choose to Claim their assets before the BR Pod Line has been fully repaid, they will face a haircut proportional to the amount of the BR Pod Line repaid. For example, if a Silo Member decides to Claim their recapitalized assets and 50% of the BR Pod Line has been repaid, they will forfeit their rights to 50% of those assets. Farmable Beans earned from new mints after Unpause are not subject to this vesting schedule.\n\nWhile raising the full ~$77M is a sufficient – and ideal – condition of a successful Barn Raise, it is not a necessary one. Because the Reseeding is designed to scale the protocol based on the size of the Barn Raise, Beanstalk will be able to Unpause with an arbitrary amount of new liquidity. In practice, raising $0 is the equivalent of restarting Beanstalk from scratch. Therefore, any amount raised is better than nothing.\n\nRationale:\nUnlike every other non-collateralized stablecoin in history, Beanstalk’s economic model has not failed. Beanstalk, however, cannot continue in its state prior to the devastating governance attack on April 17.\n\nBeanstalk Farms and the broader Beanstalk community are keen to bring Beanstalk’s key stablecoin innovations to every corner of DeFi, in spite of last week’s events. A successful Barn Raise is the best path to achieving that.\n",

      "content": "Proposer:\nBeanstalk Farms\n\nSummary:\nHire Halborn to perform an end-to-end code audit on Beanstalk. Use 200,000 USDC of the 250,000 USDC that was initially reserved for the Beanstalk Farms’ Omniscia retainer to pay for the Halborn audit.\n\nProblem:\nBeanstalk has received one audit of its code base up to BIP-7. However, the protocol suffered an attack on April 17 which exploited its on-chain decentralized governance structure. While the protocol is being prepared to Unpause, it is essential that it receives multiple high-quality audits to ensure that any remaining outstanding security issues are adequately addressed.\n\nUntil Beanstalk has sufficiently reestablished Beans as a reliable stablecoin such that Beanstalk can make all payments in Beans, Beanstalk needs a way to pay for things (including this audit) in other stablecoins. Beanstalk Farms has 250,000 USDC that was initially reserved for the Omniscia retainer.\n\nProposed Solution:\nBeanstalk Farms has connected with Halborn, which is an award-winning blockchain security firm. Halborn has worked with hundreds of companies and protocols, including BlockFi, Terraform, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Thorchain, Avalanche, Dapper Labs, Phantom, etc. Furthermore, Halborn has assisted other protocols such as Thorchain, Liquid, BadgerFi, EasyFi and many more after suffering their own hacks. Their audits are viewable here: https://github.com/HalbornSecurity. \n\nTo ensure the Beanstalk’s code is as secure as possible, Beanstalk has an end-to-end audit scheduled with Halborn for May 9. \n\nPaying for the Audit\nThis Snapshot proposes that Beanstalk Farms use 200,000 USDC of the 250,000 USDC earmarked to retain Omniscia be used to pay for the Halborn audit.\n\nPayment:\nThe cost of the audit is 200,000 USDC, paid upfront. Upon approval of this Snapshot, the Beanstalk Farms multisig will submit the 200,000 USDC payment to Halborn.\n\nRationale:\nAfter suffering a devastating attack, it is critical that Beanstalk is as healthy and secure as possible prior to Unpausing. Maintaining the Beanstalk community’s faith in the security of the protocol is paramount. As a result, in Beanstalk Farms’ opinion, hiring another high-quality firm to perform an end-to-end audit is one of, if not, the best uses of the organization’s remaining funds.\n",

      "content": "Proposal: \nSeed an alUSD:BEAN Pool with funds from Bean Sprout. \n\nProposed by: \nmistermanifold\n\nSummary:\nSeed an alUSD:BEAN pool with 250,000 Beans from the Q1 2022 Bean Sprout budget. Alchemix has put up a governance vote to seed this pool with $250,000 in alUSD. Bean Sprout and Alchemix will conduct a 1:1 alUSD:BEAN swap, and seed a pool on Curve.\n\nReasoning: \nAlchemix’s alUSD has gained just under $200M in marketcap. By creating an alUSD:Bean LP, with the future hope to whitelist the pair into the Silo, alUSD holders will have their highest yield opportunity to date, and further stimulate Bean demand. Current alUSD yield opportunities consist of:\n\n- alUSD-3CRV pool which yields 8-9% on Convex with ~180m TVL\n- d3 pool (alUSD, FEI, FRAX) which yields 10-12% on Convex with ~125m TVL\n- alUSD Tokemak reactor yields 8% but only a few million in TVL\n\nIf the alUSD:BEAN is whitelisted into the Silo on a future date, we believe the pool will attract a significant portion of alUSD liquidity. The relationship is symbiotic for both alUSD and Bean.\n\nBean Sprout will retain half of the LP after pool launch and the Beanstalk DAO will decide how to best manage or distribute the LP on a future date. Bean Sprout’s LP will not be deposited in the Silo. \n\nThe Alchemix DAO will have DAO discussions once the pool has reached >$10M TVL as to redeploy the their $250K alUSD seed elsewhere or retain the seed capital in the pool. Bean Sprout will coordinate with Alechemix during this time, and withdraw it’s 250K Bean seed if Alchemix decides to withdraw their seed alUSD. If Alchemix decides to retain the seed capital in the pool, Bean Sprout will keep the 250K Bean seed in the pool indefinitely.\n\nProposed Budget:\n250,000 Beans from the Q1 2022 Bean Sprout budget. The pool will be seeded following approval of BSP-6.\n\nNote on BSP Numbering:\nThere was an error on the last BSP and we have now reconciled it internally. BSPs will continue from BSP-6 onward in the normal manner.",

      "content": "Proposer:\nRex\n\nProposal:\nHire BeanIntern as a part-time Metaverse Lead in the Community Team\n\nResume:\nBeanintern was one of the earliest “Beanpilled” participants in the protocol, joining the server under the name Dutchbeans. They quickly gained an understanding of the protocol and began regularly interacting with Publius. Those interactions gave Intern a respect for Publius’ vision and unwillingness to compromise for short term hype. More seasoned farmers may remember BeanIntern’s early and regular garden postings, with the goal of fostering the vibe of friendly collaboration for which we are now know.\n\nAfter significant time and work with Beanstalk early on, BeanIntern stepped away as their regular job demanded more and more of their time. Now having left that other obligation, they are able to focus their time on Beanstalk and will be working with both the Metaverse and Business Development teams.\n\nBeanIntern has experience as a vibe curator at manifest and plays a leading role in Volt protocol. Some may also remember IndexDAO, a project which they helped launch over the Christmas holidays. Though the venture didn’t perform as expected, they learned a lot in the process and revel in the opportunity to grow, even through difficulties.\n\nBeanIntern prides themselves on their strong skills in business development, community vibe, and generally ambitious approach. Specifically, they see the metaverse as a way to build a lore extension for the Beanstalk community. In the same way stories are told through song and rhymes, they want knowledge of Beanstalk to be told like stories and experiences, potentially through a variety of platforms, assets, and experiences.\n\nBeanIntern’s metaverse research is ongoing and rooted in exploring a number of relevant Discord servers. Their vision for the Beanstalk metaverse project (a.k.a., the “MetaBean”) is for a gamified interface through Gather, but with addition aspects that tie to social good in the real world, as they believe this aspect could set the project apart. Upon approval from the DAO, their first order of business is to work together with other team members to develop a scoping and short-term execution plan for the project.\n\nRole Definition:\nThe Metaverse Lead will facilitate the development of Beanstalk’s virtual interaction platform. The organization has three key goals for it’s metaverse program:\n\n1. Community engagement and development;\n2. Education; and\n3. Facilitating Bean utilization.\n\nBecause of how early the organization is in its metaverse development, the first requirement of the Metaverse Lead will be to assess various platforms for the option that best fits the needs of the organization. In addition to existing platforms (e.g., Sandbox, Decentraland, GatherTown, etc.), the individual in this role may choose to work with independent developers to build a customized solution for Beanstalk.\n\nRegardless of the platform chosen or developed, the Metaverse Lead will be responsible for identifying and incorporating systems and functions that help facilitate the three types of actives listed above. For example, an early goal will likely be to incorporate a virtual cardplaying system to allow for future poker tournaments to take place in the metaverse. Similarly, the Metaverse Lead will be responsible for developing spaces where small groups (Teams) and large groups (A&T University and the DAO) can meet and interact. Whenever possible and practical, Beans will be used as the medium of exchange in the metaverse system. \n\nOther possibilities, such as gamification and development of social-good initiatives will also be explored and developed when possible. The Metaverse Lead will work closely with peers from Operations, Engineering, and other parts of Beanstalk Farms to ensure organizational alignment and successful execution of the project.\n\nPayment:\n 4,800 Beans per month, paid twice a month. Starting on April 1st, 2022. Retroactive payment of 6,000 Beans to be paid for 100 hours of work done in Q1 2022. \n\nCommitment:\nPart time (20+ hours per week), through the end of Q2, 2022.

Jellybean is experienced in user research and design strategy and has spent the past 7+ years leading various fintech companies for these roles. Jellybean regularly facilitates cross-functional design sprints, teaches user research courses for companies, and gives design talks in the community.\n\nJellybean has been functioning as the part-time UX/UI design lead for the past 2 weeks at Beanstalk. During this limited time, they have made significant improvements to the UX/UI development process and are currently leading out the website overhaul. In order to hit deadlines and expedite the design process, they are willing to transition full-time to Beanstalk Farms from their current full-time job.\n\nRole Definition:\nThis full-time UX/UI design lead position will be the main contributor of UX/UI design related work within the Design Department. This role reports to the head of the Design Department and it’s responsibilities include:\n\n- Proactive and operational user research;\n- Presenting research findings to stakeholders and delivering product opportunity or design recommendations;\n- Information architecture;\n- UX strategy;\n- Creating visual artifacts to communicate intent, such as wireframes, wireflows, mockups, prototypes; and\n- UI design implementation with the support of branding, styling guidelines and art direction.\n\nPayment:\n16.5k Beans per month, paid bi-monthly, through Q2 2022, as of March 1st, 2022.\n\nCommitment:\nFull Time, Minimum 40 hours a week through Q2 2022. At-will.\n\nBeanstalk Farms has a dire need for high quality production to drive the next major growth cycle as it approaches Q2. In order to match the high standard of the protocol, Beanstalk Farms is motivated to attract the best talent with industry premium wages. Beanstalk Farms is more inclined to hire a few key extremely proficient contributors at a premium price than 7 or 8 contributors at a standard price. Beanstalk Farms believes this hiring philosophy will lead to lean development teams that are highly efficient, fast-paced and much more productive than a standard larger team. This type of wage distribution should allow Beanstalk Farms to maintain a lean budget while properly compensating its premium contributors for their work. Beanstalk Farms will make efforts to stay lean until the next major growth cycle.",

The Brand Identity v2 will be finalized by the design department in Q1 2022 and will be released in early Q2 2022. This Snapshot is to affirm or reject this new Brand Identity v2 at a high level. \n\nDetails:\nBeanstalk went through a brand strategy campaign from mid December to the end of January. The purpose of this campaign was to understand all high level aspects of Beanstalk’s current brand.\n\nThe campaign included:\n\n- Live branding workshops with the DAO and multiple extended calls with Publius;\n- Analysis and synthesis of brand story (vision, purpose, mission).\n- Target audience research & analysis;\n- Market research & analysis;\n- Definition of user persona and common user journeys; and\n- Definition of overarching goals.\n\nThe Design department at Beanstalk Farms took the results from the brand strategy campaign to develop foundational identity pieces that could be applied to all areas of Beanstalk’s brand.\n\nThese revamped pieces included:\n\n- Creative Inspiration & Stylescapes;\n- Logotype and Logomark;\n- Color Palette and Guidelines;\n- Typography and Guidelines;\n- Layout and Spacing Guidelines; and\n- Asset Demo Samples.\n\nThough much of Beanstalk’s future brand experience is still to be developed, this brand identity direction can be used as a foundation.\n\nBecause Beanstalk Farms is an organization funded and governed by the Beanstalk DAO, we would like to obtain explicit support on the new creative direction before proceeding in the form of a Snapshot. Voting yes on this proposal means giving Beanstalk Farms permission to proceed with Beanstalk’s new brand identity and experience rebrand based on the brand identity direction pitch given at the DAO meeting on 2-17-2022. Notes and a recording of that meeting can be found here:\n\n[https://www.notion.so/beanstalkfarmsdao/Beanstalk-Farms-DAO-Weekly-Meeting-9-02-17-2022-58ca042bad6a48f1a6b393574cd4b8f4](https://www.notion.so/Beanstalk-Farms-DAO-Weekly-Meeting-9-02-17-2022-58ca042bad6a48f1a6b393574cd4b8f4)\n\nFor the portion of the meeting about the brand identity, you can skip to 04:25 in the Anchor recording.",

As the previous Beanstalk CRE8R DAO campaign was a tremendous success, Beanstalk Farms proposes to further collaborate with CRE8R DAO’s network of content creators and influencers.

CRE8R has expressed willingness to pay its creators in $BEAN and to find other ways of encouraging the use of $BEAN as a stablecoin. \n\nProposed Budget:\n50,000 Beans from the Q1 2022 Beanstalk Farms budget, paid in 25,000 bean installments.

In addition to successfully executing a smooth brand awareness initiative, the primary goals for this tournament will be to draw in 100-250 cross-platform registrants and encouragement community building for existing Beanstalk Farmers.  \n\nBudget: \nAllocate 10,850 Beans from the Bean Sprout Q1 2022 Budget to create a guaranteed prize pool.\n\nReasoning:\nOrganizations like Olympus DAO and Temple DAO have successfully hosted community-building poker tournaments in the past. Bean Sprout would like to host a tournament in February to demonstrate Bean’s utility and build relationships with other prominent DAOs in the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. We propose using a guaranteed prize pool model to fund the event. This system ensures that all tournament participants are incentivized to play for a minimum pot regardless of total attendance. \n\nThe buy-in per player will be 100 Beans, purchasable on the Beanstalk website, (bean.money). The funds will be Sown and custodied by Bean Sprout until the tournament concludes, at which point they will be distributed according to a predetermined payoff matrix.\n\nProposed Budget and Structure:\nBean Sprout proposes Sowing 9,850 Beans and allocating 1,000 additional Beans to seed the guaranteed prize pool. The number of buy-ins necessary for Bean Sprout to break even on the guaranteed prize pool is 109 players. Each 100 Bean buy-in after 109 entrants will supplement the prize pool. \n\nThe sown Beans at the current Weather amount to ~500,000 Pods, which Bean Sprout estimates is a sufficiently attractive potential payoff to attract a large, diverse group of players from various backgrounds. Bean Sprout plans to Sow the 9,850 Beans as soon as the proposal passes to minimize Weather-induced fluctuations in the guaranteed prize pool and lock in the budget while the Field has Soil available.",

He has taken over Stenographer duties from 0xaustin (on 0xaustin’s recommendation) for the last 3 weeks, and he has been taking excellent notes over this time period, all of which can be reviewed here: (https://www.notion.so/a57619dbe75449968859db7f4fa2936f?v=a2eaf7819c4d4aeabad622b7612b91c6). \nIn his day job, he takes notes on high-level company strategy meetings and is relied upon to condense complex discussions into concise formats.\n\nRole Definition:\nThe Bean Stenographer is responsible for taking detailed, consistent minutes from meetings, A&T University classes, and other events and critical meetings of the DAO. Prior to having a formal stenographer role, various members of the DAO had been requesting notes from meetings that they could not attend, and without having a dedicated person to take notes the response has been spotty and inconsistent. 0xaustin had taken on this role previously and is transitioning into another role where he can work on content creation and marketing for Beanstalk. In his place, he has recommended 2bean (or not 2bean) to take over Stenographer duties.\n\nPayment:\n1300 beans per month, paid bimonthly, starting on 1/10/2022, through Q2 2022. \n\nCommitment:\nPart-time (minimum of 5 hours per week) through the end of Q2 2022.

GuavAnom focuses primarily on visual identity to build stronger identifiable brands. Personally referred by deezbeanz.\n\nProject Definition:\nBeanstalk Farm’s internal Design department is heavily understaffed and help is needed to *quickly* create pivotal foundational design documents at a high level of fidelity.\n\nBeanstalk is currently undergoing a massive visual identity revamp. To help align the visual identity and theme, Beanstalk needs a basic foundational brand style guide that contains all the elements to craft a true and consistent Beanstalk experience. \n\nThis basic style guide should include at minimum:\n\n- Revamped Logo and Logo typeface\n- Logo Guidelines\n- Revised Color Palette & Color Guidelines\n- Typography Guidelines\n- Spacing & Layout Guidelines\n- Visual Asset Library\n- Strong “Do nots”\n\nA strong and well branded style guide should allow internal teams to create content that is unified and cohesive. A version of this style guide should be available for external vendors to give guidance on how to stay within Beanstalk branding as well as how to use Beanstalk assets. A simplified version of this style guide should be made public for general users to understand the overall Beanstalk visual branding. This style guide should be extremely clear and user friendly. It should focus on showing how to use individual elements rather than only portraying finished products to allow for creative freedom of users. Not only will this document be a visual compass and guide, it should serve as a source of inspiration for new Beanstalk creative products and content.\n\nExamples of industry standard style guides: \n\n[https://creative.starbucks.com/logos/](https://creative.starbucks.com/logos/)\n\n[https://brand.uber.com/us/en/logo/](https://brand.uber.com/us/en/logo/)\n\nNote* Due to project constraints (budget and time), this first style guide will only lay the foundations and will need further specific development by Beanstalk Farm’s Design department after initial completion.\n\nPayment:\n\nPay GuavAnom a one time initial payment of 5000 Beans upon passage of proposal, and a one time final payment of 10,000 Beans upon successful completion of the project. In total 15,000 Beans.\n\nProject will need approval by the Design manager and Publius before final payment is issued.\n\nCommitment:\nRush job.\n\nTarget deadline range: 2-3 weeks from agreement with flexibility upon Design manager’s discretion",

Current projects that Farmer Dan is leading are Layer 3 Bounties, Beanstalk Merch Project, and The Beans of Poker Tournament. \n\n- Layer 3 Bounties\nThe first round of bounties (headed by Bean Merchant) were a success, so Farmer Dan has been planning a second, expanded round of bounties.

The Layer 3 project is documented on Notion.\n\n- Beanstalk Merch Project\nFarmer Dan is currently heading up the merch project for the protocol. Having some industry connections, he has been able to find a reputable supplier that is cost effective and willing to form a long-term relationship. The second round of merch is estimated to arrive by the 3rd week in January and Farmer Dan will coordinate the delivery at that time. Farmer Dan will facilitate future merch projects as well. The ultimate vision is to have a merch store where a myriad of items can be purchased using beans, along with items to be given as awards, rewards, airdrops, etc. The merch project is listed on Notion for transparency and clarity.\n\n- The Beans of Poker Tournament\nDumpling and Farmer Dan have recently drafted a proposal for a new project called “The Beans of Poker Tournament”. While the project is pre-proposal, they have received early support with hopes to take this to the next level soon. The project will have many facets to it, and Farmer Dan will be heading the project with the support of Dumpling. The  current timeline for this project is February. Notion page to come soon.\n\n- Regarding future projects, Farmer Dan will continue to be of assistance\nwhere needed. After the Layer3 bounties are published and the merch orders are underway, The “Beans of Poker” Tournament will be his main focus until the project is completed. After completion, he will continue to assist where necessary to help beanstalk grow.\n\nPayment: \n4766 beans per month starting on January 1st, 2022, paid bi-monthly. \nAs Farmer Dan began work in December, a retroactive payment for work done before Q1 of 1250 beans will be included with his first payment. \n\nCommitment: \n20+ hours/week starting on January 1st, 2022, through Q1 2022.

He also has experience in venture, as a contributor in other DAO, as well as owning the product as a co-founder of a social-focused startup that raised tens of thousands of dollars. He has part-time availability for now with the hope that he becomes a full-time contributor. Beanpilled by early contributors like 0xaustin, he’s been an active member in the community and has already contributed to the Pod Marketplace and Curve integration. Previously, Publius, Dumpling, and the Eng Leads were tasked with all product/project oversight but as the DAO grows this won’t be scalable. We believe jakerb is highly qualified to assist us as we reach new heights.\n\nRole Definition: \nBeanstalk Product Manager Lead is a new role. Making sure every team has what they need from every other team is core to the role. Given how quickly the DAO is scaling and the many moving parts (engineering, UX, marketing, copy, community, etc.) it will be critical that every project meets the original spec, deadline, and all parties involved are both unblocked themselves and not blocking others. Jakerb has shown that he’s organized, an effective communicator, and has great initiative. As more projects have their own point person, we hope jakerb can become responsible for more things at a project level and including coordinating and ensuring things are moving smoothly across the entire DAO.\n\nPayment:\n4766 Beans per month, paid bi-monthly, through the end of Q1. To be reviewed and re-approved for Q2. \nRetroactive payment of 1980 beans for 36 hours of work completed prior to Q1 2022. \n\nCommitment: \nPart-time (A minimum of 20 hours per week).",

      "content": "Proposer: \nDumpling\n\nProposal:\nHire Silo Chad as Full-time Frontend Lead for Q1 2022. \n\nResume: \nSilo Chad is a full-stack software engineer and UI/UX designer. He most recently served in a mixture of engineering, operations, and community roles for a venture fund. Previously, he ran an independent consultancy performing design and engineering work for startups and VC firms. Throughout December, he contributed to Beanstalk's frontend code and pushed a first series of UI tweaks intended to simplify the website's structure.\n\nRole Definition:\nAs the capabilities of Beanstalk expand throughout Q1, it's crucial for the engineering team to establish a rapid pace of development, maintain a high bar for code quality, and pay close attention to UI/UX. While the protocol is built with simple primitives at its core, designing and building an interface to allow users to clearly interact with Beanstalk is a non-trivial engineering and design challenge. Clean design, well-written code and swift execution will only increase in importance with the launch of the Pod Marketplace, integration into other protocols like Curve, open-sourcing of the frontend repository, and more.\n\nSilo Chad will spearhead these efforts by serving as the frontend team lead. His work will include:\n- Organizing the frontend team's operations, setting roadmap, and maintaining a rapid pace of development.\n- Re-architecting and cleaning up the frontend codebase in preparation for open-sourcing in late Q1.\n- Building components for the release of Pod Marketplace, Curve pool, and others.\n- Finding and onboarding new engineers to the team.\n- Reviewing PRs for quality and ensuring clear UI/UX in all components shipped.\n- Serving as a bridge between the engineering & design team to ensure the design teams' vision is properly executed.\n\nPayment:\n15,000 beans/month starting on January 1st, 2022. \n\nCommitment:\nFull-time (40+ hours/week) for Q1 2022. \n\n",

      "content": "Proposer: \nDumpling\n\nProposal: \nHire ereal as Written Content Lead Editor \n\nResume:  \nEreal works in finance, specializing in helping PE and VC firms fundraise. His experience spans project management, client relationship management, and materials creation and is excited to bring some of those skills to Beanstalk.\n\nPrior to formally joining the DAO, he created a Beanstalk infographic to help educate new users about the protocol and also collaborated with Kyamites (aka JWW) on a Zero to Beanstalk project to help people with no experience in crypto onboard to Beanstalk in a simple, step-by-step process.\n\nRole Definition: \nAt this stage in the DAO’s growth trajectory, it is critical to develop a compelling, cohesive voice for communicating both internally and externally. Having a common parlance will benefit the community in a number of ways, including: (1) ensuring that all outbound Beanstalk communications are consistent; (2) having pithy one-liners to concisely advertise the protocol; (3) easing the onboarding of new users in the Discord with brief, off-the-shelf answers to common questions; and (4) solidifying that media / potential partners view associate our brand with legitimacy and organizational sophistication.\n\nEreal plans to help lead these efforts by spearheading and initiating a number of projects such as:\n\n- Serving as Lead Editor on all copy produced by Beanstalk Farms and the Silo.\n- Writing a weekly newsletter that recaps recent protocol activity and DAO initiatives, and provides helpful links to relevant content (like the stablecoin industry pieces that DAO members share from time to time).\n- Periodically writing more formal Medium pieces that serve as business updates and analysis pieces. This would include official announcements of recently-passed BIPs/budgets/etc. and thought pieces like Nasjaq’s Road to One Billion Beans which are fantastic but currently not polished enough for external publication.\n- Developing a set of go-to marketing phrases for describing Beanstalk. This would include things like how we explain the protocol to the outside world in one line: “A decentralized, collateral-free, credit-based stablecoin” (recognizing that this particular example is a very minor iteration of the White Paper’s title).\n- Writing a simpler FAQ and perhaps create a dedicated channel in Discord to house it. Bean Merchant’s document is great, but it’s likely a bit too extensive to hold the average new user’s attention. This bullet speaks to a broader point that ereal’s role will focus on; that being to help to “pithify” Beanstalk’s language. Doing so will only become increasingly important as the protocol onboards more and more low-involvement Farmers who want to understand the Silo and Field enough to use them, but not enough to dig into the mechanics.\n- Drafting a stock cover note for biz dev and media outreach.\n- Acting as the Editor for outbound DAO communications.\n\nPayment: \n4,800 beans per month, paid bimonthly. \n\nEreal has been working for the DAO in a part-time, project basis since November 28th, 2021. 2400 Beans retroactive payment to be made upon approval for this work. \n\nCommitment: \nMinimum 20 hours/week through March 31st, 2022. To be renewed upon approval of Q2 Budget.",

      "content": "Proposer(s): \naeiowe and wherehaveyoubean\n\n\nSummary:\nBeanstalk’s mission is to be the leading decentralized stablecoin. To accomplish this, Beanstalk needs to simultaneously recruit new, ideally high-quality capital into the protocol while preserving the existing capital and userbase. The success of the first NFT drops was a good jumping off point to do both. \n\nBeanstalk launched its BeaNFTs Genesis Collection during seasons 1200-1800 for 25 days to incentivize lenders to sow beans with a chance to win a unique NFT every season. The result has been a deepening and broadening of the community as 2,067 art-based Genesis Collection BeaNFTs varietals were created and collected by the top 10 sowers each season.\n\n\nProblem:\nWhile the Genesis Collection accomplished the goal of driving new users to the protocol and encouraged existing members to reinvest, work can be done to attract new capital, build Beanstalk brand awareness, and further enmesh existing users while providing value to their NFTs, as they evolve into one or several NFT categories.\n\nBeaNFTs have been a fantastic tool to promote Beanstalk while ensuring growth and retention. In order for BeaNFTs to return the most value to all holders, current and future community members, and Beanstalk as a whole, we are creating and executing on a roadmap with milestones over the next 10 weeks. To grow excitement and momentum around the protocol, we need swift action with regards to BeaNFTs.\n\n\nSolution-based, High-level Deliverables:\nThis BMP will set aside up to 20,000 Beans to do the following over the next 10 weeks:\n\n1. Create BeaNFT roadmap for the remainder of 2021 and 2022 while taking into consideration both existing design assets so as to not overspend and account for upcoming BIP, BDP, and BMP changes\n\n2. Deploy BeaNFT Collection 2 (ie B2) and potential future collections\n\n3. Conduct weekly BeaNFT updates in Discord\n\n4. Propose and execute on marketing budget to list BeaNFTs on NFT platforms (ex: rarity.tools)\n\n5. Outline best practices for NFT roll-outs and create BeaNFT best practices\n\n6. Maintain ongoing list of community feedback for future considerations and consider respective dev/design costs\n\n7. Partner with development teams to finesse existing infrastructure and improve on any infrastructure changes, as needed\n\n8. Partner with designer to create and ensure existing Beanstalk and BeaNFT brand identity is expanded upon (not lost) through loose design brand guidelines, as needed\n\n9. Submit any necessary BMPs or BDPs for future dev/design work needs to execute on milestone enhancements beyond scope\n\n10. Partner with other community members to help socialize\n\n11. Create simple tutorials/docs for newcomers to understand how each part of the BeaNFT ecosystem works and pin in Discord\n\n12. Preserve existing BeaNFT design while specing B2 and beyond to prevent dilution of existing Genesis Collection holders and considering use of remaining permutations\n\n13. Ensure all code is in-house at Beanstalk Farms for future iterations of NFTs\n\n14. Work with dev to ensure future contracts are upgradable and share impact to existing NFT holders\n\n\nHigh-level Timeline (Preliminary):\nWeek 1: Create and socialize BeaNFT roadmap. Start immediate dev/design work for B2 launch\n\nWeeks 2-3: Prep social/marketing outreach and launch B2\n\nWeeks 3-6: Maintain B2 Collection and ensure both mechanics to earn and receive NFTs functioning properly; draft bean design guidelines; begin dev/design work on next NFT milestones\n\nWeeks 6-10: Finalize dev and design work for subsequent NFT milestones; roll out and socialize post-B2 Collection\n\n\nResume: \naeiowe founded a CPG company, has an obsessive focus on creative, was raised with artists. Experience as project manager at Fortune 500 companies. Extensive experience working on data science projects; leading developers and designers; setting/ensuring creative direction;  brand building; and marketing. Heavily invested in protocol, proud BeanNFT holder.\n\nwherehaveyoubean is a student of art history. Highly connected in American art scene. Big in Beanstalk and BeaNFTs. Highly incentivized to drive value to BeaNFTs.\n\n\nPayment:\n-   This BMP will set aside up to 20,000 Beans for 10 weeks of work\n-   Developer support will be included in development budget and not accounted for in this proposal. Support will be managed by proposers and payment submitted through Publius.\n-   Up to 10,000 Beans for designer for B2 and beyond work\n-   5,000 Beans up front to aeiowe to co-manage deliverables\n-   5,000 Beans up front to wherehaveyoubean to co-manage deliverables\n-   Any additional payment requirements will be listed post roadmap and be issued as a separate BDP and/or BMP",

The only delay in releasing new features on the website and bots is the funding to pay for deployment of new subgraphs. \n\nAs usage of bean.money and the decentralized development team working of it grows, the infrastructure supporting it must grow as well. Good infrastructure is not free. \n\nIssuing payments in Beans and Pods is costly. Beanstalk Farms issues payments to almost a dozen independent contributors, some of whom receive both Beans and Pods. This is costly to do.\n\nSolution: Allocate 4000 Beans to cover these and similar costs through the remainder of the year. This should help expedite upgrades to the subgraph and ensure timely payment to contributors.",

      "content": "Proposer: Wolfie\n\nSnapshot has a character limit, so the full proposal couldn't be posted here. Please read the full proposal on Google Docs:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/17IbUGlMCd-Vx8-RQKvdxOZspq6yeswcGlxB6QzTgNqs\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\nHere is a shortened version that fits within the character limit\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY:\nHello fellow Farmers,\n\nI recently sat down with Publius to discuss our biggest gaps to growth right now as a platform and as a community.  \n\nDespite having one of the most unique products out there built by a team of technology purists who have poured blood, sweat, and tears into this product, we are all in agreement that there is one big gap we’re experiencing right now:   slow user growth.  \n\nWe are continually trending up with users, which is fantastic.  But, we all want our growth to be faster.  \n\nFaster growth requires two factors:  \n1) Generating followers \n2) Turning followers into investors\n\nGenerating followers happens from social media, influencer outreach, building discord and more.  \n\nConverting followers into investors means creating marketing messages that educate followers so they want to invest.  \n\nOur biggest gap right now is in converting followers into investors.\n\nThis problem exists because our core team is highly technically skilled.  But we don’t have the same experience in sales and marketing.   And these two skill sets are very, very different.  \n\nFrom our research, when people read about Beanstalk, our protocol can seem overly complex or confusing.  It takes people time to understand our tech and our ecosystem.  \n\nThis causes us to lose potential users who would normally invest if they understood the product more thoroughly.  \n\nThe fact is, Beanstalk is a protocol where investors can earn 170% APY on their stablecoins without the risks inherent to centralization.   \n\nThis is a unique position in the market and it needs to be communicated much more widely to our audience.  \n\nTo do this, we are proposing we produce a high quality video for the home page that simplifies and explains the Beanstalk protocol that increases the number of followers who become investors in our platform.   \n\nWe want to bring the same level of care and detail to our marketing messaging as Publius has poured into building this product.   \n\nYou can read the Creative Brief we built after our deep dive with the core team here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1plQrCzdIq18C6XJd7Dw4LmPxiApHsp6INZPmjHgd2JA/edit\n\nTHE PROCESS:\n\nTo properly produce this video, this is the process:\n\n1. Research - I have already done a 3 hour deep dive with your core team to understand the intricacies of the product.  \nScript Ideation and Drafting - Create the first version of the video script.  \n2. User Testing - This part is the real magic behind this process.  We read the script over and over to people one on one between 20-50 times.   Each time, we refine the script, getting it more and more dialed in.  \n3. Audio/Video Drafting - As the script gets dialed in, then we add the audio and video components.  This script will be using mostly 2D animation.  \n4. Focus Group Testing - After we get a draft of the video complete, we’ll play this in small focus groups to do another round of editing\n5. Editing Video - We’ll continue editing the video until \n6. Final Product - Final product ships and Beanstalk will start seeing higher conversion rates across the board.  \n\nHere’s are the roles required for producing this video properly:  \nResearch, scripting and editing\nVideo editor\nDesigner - (Beanstalk team) \nAnimator\nVoice over artist\nSound editor\nMotion graphic artist\nFocus group testing\n\nTHE INVESTMENT:\n\nAfter building a detailed budget, completing this project requires an investment of $24,308.   \n\nThe final deliverable will be a 2-4 minute video that is specifically designed to entertain, educate and enroll followers into investors in Beanstalk.\n\nThis video will be the first thing new followers see on the homepage, increasing the conversion rate of followers to investors.  \n\nPAYMENT:\n\nWe would be paid half (12,154 Beans) upfront upon passage of this proposal, and (12,154 Beans) upon successful completion of the project.  \n\nPayments will be distributed by Publius upon our direction.\n\nThe project will be completed within 8 weeks of agreement.  \n\nTHE SUMMARY:\n\nOur core team is all in agreement that we have a significant gap in our ability to turn followers into investors.  \n\nEach day we don’t have a better explanation of our product, it is costing us users and growth.  \n\nTaking the time to properly produce this type of video will produce an ROI for our platform and for our community for many, many seasons.  \n\nAny questions?

      "title": "BDP: Expanding Existing BeaNFT Collection, Modifying to Add Utility, and Setting Clear Direction on Next Step",
      "content": "Summary:\nBeanstalk’s mission is to be the leading decentralized stablecoin. To accomplish this, Beanstalk needs to simultaneously recruit new, ideally high-quality capital into the protocol while preserving the existing capital and userbase. The success of the first NFT drops was a good jumping of point to introduce both. \n\nBeanstalk launched its BeaNFTs Genesis Collection during seasons 1200-1800 for 25 days to incentivize lenders to sow beans with a chance to win a unique NFT every season. The result has been a deepening and broadening of the community as 2,067 non-utility based v1 BeaNFTs varietals were created and collected by the top 10 sowers each season.\n\nProblem:\nWhile the initial Genesis Collection did accomplish the goal of driving new users into the protocol and encouraging existing members to re-invest, there is ongoing work that can be done to continue building Beanstalk brand awareness while simultaneously further enmeshing existing users and providing value to their NFTs. \n\nBeaNFTs are a fantastic tool to promote Beanstalk and ensure growth and retention at the same time, so in order for BeaNFTs to return the most value possible for both existing NFT holders, future community members, and Beanstalk as a whole, a clear roadmap paired with intermittent consensus needs to be created and executed on over the next 10 weeks. To continue growing the protocol, we cannot wait another month to consider next steps with NFTs or two months before the next roll out begins. We need swift, clear execution to capitalize on our momentum.\n\n\nSolution-based, High-level Deliverables:\n1) This BDP will set aside up to 25,000 Beans to do the following over the next 10 weeks.\n\n2) Create BeaNFT roadmap for Dec 2021-Februrary 2022 while taking into consideration both existing design assets so as to not overspend and account for upcoming BIP and BDP changes (ex: deployment of potential LP lending into Field or LP encouraged into the silo, design changes on the website, etc.)\n\n3) Conduct weekly BeaNFT updates via Discord chat in BeaNFT clubroom or barnyard\n\n4) Propose and execute on marketing budget to list BeaNFT on rarity.tools\n\n5) Outline best practices for NFT roll-outs and create BeaNFT best practices\n\n6) Maintain ongoing list of community feedback for future considerations and spec out dev/design time cost for each\n\n7) Partner with development teams to finesse existing infrastructure and improve on any infrastructure changes as needed\n\n8) Partner with designer to create and ensure existing Beanstalk and BeaNFT brand identity is expanded upon (not lost) through loose desibrand guidelines\n\n9) Submit any necessary BDPs for future dev/design work needs to execute on milestone enhancements (currently all within scope but could expand)\n\n10) Partner with other community members to help socialize/implement upcoming NFT milestones (ex: partner with ipoandchill across social channels IG, TikTok, Twitter for socializing/creating hype and Dumpling when considering bean merch for burning NFTs)\n\n11) Create simple tutorials/docs for newcomers to understand how each part of the BeaNFT ecosystem works and pin in Discord\n\n12) Preserve existing BeaNFT design while specing v2 to prevent dilution of existing Genesis Collection v1 holders (ex: establish v1 preservation value techniques when designing v2 while utilizing remaining 4,000 varietals)\n\n13) Ensure all code is in-house at Beanstalk farms for future iterations of NFTs\n\n14) Work with dev to ensure future contracts are upgradable and share impact to existing NFT holders\n\nHigh-level Timeline (Preliminary):\nWeek 1: Create and socialize BeaNFT roadmap\n\nWeeks 2-3: Develop and design Genesis Collection 2, prep social/marketing outreach\n\nWeek 3-6: Launch and maintain Genesis Collection 2 to run from seasons 3200-3800 (est.); draft bean design guidelines; begin dev work on next NFT milestones\n\nWeek 6-10: Finalize dev and design work for subsequent NFT milestones; roll out and socialize post-Genesis Collection 2 NFTs \n\nResume: \nPrevious founder of CPG company with an obsessive focus on creative direction who was raised in a family of artists. Experience as project manager at large Fortune 500 companies. Extensive experience working on data science projects and working with developers and designers. For better or for worse, extensive experience with brand building and marketing as well. Heavily invested into Beanstalk protocol. Proud BeanNFT holder.\n\nPayment:\n-   This BDP will set aside 25,000 Beans for 10 weeks of work\n-   Up to 15,000 Beans for developer and designer support\n-   1,000 Beans up front to aeiowe followed by 1,000 every week to manage all NFT updates for a total of 10,000 beans\n-   Any additional payment requirements will be listed post roadmap and be issued as a separate BDP",

      "content": "Proposer: doyouknowwhereIhavebean?\n\nThe Problem:\n\nThe release of the BeaNFT Genesis Collection was a big success. They encouraged new people to sow and brought some fun onto the farm. Over time, we know that they will be prized as badges that reflect support for Beanstalk from the very beginning.\n\nBut there is a lot more we can do with BeaNFTs. The nature of NFTs allows us to manipulate art and collectibles in ways that were never possible before.\n\nIt is understood that the purpose of Beanstalk is not to generate NFTs or be a DAO concerned with NFTs. But the setting aside of appropriate funds for the BeaNFTs and their continued creation will help market beans to a wider audience and possibly create even more value for those involved in the ecosystem.\n\nThe Solution:\n\nThis BDP will set aside 30,000 Beans to continue the BeaNFT project for 3 months from passage.\n\nDeliverables:\n\nThe following items will be completed with funding from this BDP over the next 3 months:\n\n- The creation, development and deployment of a winter themed BeaNFTs collection that will a) launch before the December holidays, b) incentivize increased liquidity by rewarding LP contributions to Beanstalk, and c) be connected to the BeaNFT Genesis Collection. The funds will pay for an artist and labor for creating and coordinating the winter BeaNFTs.\n\n- A second BeaNFT surprise that will drive utility and value to the BeaNFTs in general, and the BeaNFT Genesis Collection specifically. Using game theory, we can drive up the value and rarity of all BeaNFTs and HAVE FUN.\n\nAn open question remains whether the BeaNFTs will be added as a facet to the Beanstalk contract, or will remain a separate contract. It seems the current BeaNFT contract is non-upgradable, so it may be a good opportunity to rejigger the architecture for the long haul now. We will discuss with the community and Publius the best way to proceed.\n\nResume:\n\nStudent of art history. Highly connected in American art scene. Big in Beanstalk and BeaNFTs. Highly incentivized to drive value to BeaNFTs.\n\nPayment:\n\n15,000 Beans for artists, developers. Publius will direct payments as necessary.\n\n10,000 Beans to pay myself for 3 months of labor to coordinate the above. To be Sown immediately and paid out on a monthly basis.\n\n5,000 Beans for miscellaneous other expenses so that I can make these awesome. Publius will direct payments as necessary.",

      "title": "Beanstalk Pause Proposal-0: Next Steps",
      "content": "Proposer: Publius\n\nWe have identified the issue, and will have a solution ready to go very shortly. An accounting error related to the patch we put up this week caused a misallocation of new Beans minted to the Silo. Every Silo member was affected: every wallet was given either too many or too few Beans. In total, we estimate around 250,000 Beans were misallocated.\n\nHere are the details of our proposed solution:\n\n- Unpause Beanstalk\n- Farmable Seeds will no longer yield Stalk until they are Farmed.\n- Over the next few Seasons, the remaining misallocation will be passively corrected. This will consist of all wallets that received too many Beans since the last time they updated their Silo not receiving new Beans for a short period of time, and wallets that received too few Beans since the last time they updated their Silo receiving additional Beans for a short period of time. Based on our rough estimation of the misallocation and the current pace of New Bean mints, we anticipate this will be entirely corrected within < 5 Seasons from Unpause.\n\nThis is slightly different than the idea we originally proposed in the Class. Whereas we had originally stated Farmable Seeds will yield grown Stalk, the current proposal is for Farmable Seeds not to yield Stalk until they are Farmed. \n\nThis proposal asks whether Stalk holders would prefer Publius to use our ownership privileges to push this fix and immediately resume Beanstalk, or to make the changes and Unpause through a BIP that can be passed in as little as 24 hours from proposal with a supermajority. \n\nTo date, we have not pushed any changes to the mechanism using ownership privileges, and are looking to the community for guidance on whether it is preferred to use them to get Beanstalk live ASAP, or to do it through a BIP. \n\nIn the coming weeks, as the back-end development capabilities of Beanstalk Farms expand, we can revisit re-improving automatic compounding of Stalk further. We look forward to the community's feedback and appreciate everyone's patience.\n\nPayment of Patch: In the instance this proposal passes for an immediate patch, we will use funds from the dev budget to fund the patch. \n",

      "content": "This is a proposal to create an Explanatory Simplified Animated Video for Beanstalk NFT.\n\nMy name is JB The Wizard and I'm an actor from Prison Break and have been in the crypto space since before ETH was invented.\n\nI love an appreciate the NFT community and am an NFT Film Consultant and Director.\n\nWhen I came to the Bean website I was ready to get involved and even had a wallet connected and on more than one occasion simply \"rejected\" the transaction and left the page.\n\nI believe in the Bean project, the product, the methodology and the protocol.\n\nDespite all of that, I left the site.\n\nThere are currently and will continue to be millions of dollars lost because of the exact same problem I encountered.  I also believe that \"Millions\" lost is a severe understatement.\n\nI've created films for Transamerica, a Fortune 500 Multi-billion dollar organization helping overcomplicated concepts with clarity as well.\n\nThe most important aspect to this project and creating something that will convert buyers, owners, participants are as follows:\n\n1. A clear story and message to bring the new user into the Bean family with clarity and trust IMMEDIATELY.  No one has the time or interest to research a Discord server or go through article after article on Medium or attempt to understand technical analysis of the inner workings of a niche product.  Video is a powerful storyteller for this.  It's fast and efficient and simple for everyone.\n2. Execute on the production.  Creating animations or developing a video are extremely straightforward and simple if you know how to animate but what story to tell or how to communicate it is where things first must be clear.\n3. The deliverable should be within 8-weeks.\n\nThis is it.\n\nMy fee is 10k + a percentage of the project/whatever makes sense.  I'll direct and write the script and project based off of further understanding and asking questions of the creators, developers, and likely the community to understand the foundation, purpose, story, outcomes desired, and even reasons why current adopters bought in.  Feel free to look at my LinkedIn page for some references and some experiences or google JB The Wizard.\n\nThe suggested fee for the animation and devs is 8k.  If that amount isn't required then what's not used is returned to the DAO.  Cheaper work typically costs more time and more money in the long run because of inability to create quality work and decreased conversions for those potential sales/Bean collectors.\n\nThe reason I connected is because I consult and coach high-end projects and the potential for this is through the roof and as functional as the tech is and as intelligent as the founders and early adopters are, it's not translating at all through the articles or the website and that means a tremendous loss of capital and movement for both the NFT's themselves and the holder's investments.\n\n10k is obviously a minimal investment compared to the ROI of what we're looking for but I'm great at what I do and believe this can be done efficiently.\n\nThank you so much for your time, your ears, and your eyes.  This is an amazing project and I hope to be able to provide even more clarity for more people who would tremendously benefit from the hard work that has gone into it.\n\nSincere regards, \n-The Wizard",

      "title": "BBIP-1: Sowing Beans",
      "content": "Note: BBIP stands for Beanstalk Budget Improvement Proposal.\n\nProposer: Publius\n\nMany of the people being paid from both the dev and marketing budgets have asked to have some or all of the Beans allocated to them sown immediately to lock in their place in the Pod Line and be paid the appropriate amount of Pods when payments are due. Having BeanstalkFarms members with incentives that are properly aligned with the long-term growth of Beanstalk is ideal. \n\nWe propose an update to the budget contract that allows for budgeted Beans to be sown on behalf of the payee. The payee will then be paid in the form of a Plot instead of Beans.\n\nProcedure: Anyone with an allocation from either budget currently not payable can request Publius sow all or a portion of their Beans. Publius will sow the requested amount of Beans and will make the payment in Pods. The number of Pods due is the number of Pods earned from sowing the Beans that were to be paid out. \n\nUpgrade: Upon passage of this proposal Publius will upgrade both budget contracts.\n\nThe code can be viewed here: https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Budget/pull/1",

This also includes programming within the community (e.g. AMA’s) that will be used to integrate members into the community.\n\nI propose assuming ownership of social media outreach & management of Instagram & Tiktok and also serving as the host of official Beanstalk AMA’s.\n\nValue:\n- Social Media Experience: I (ipoandchill, also @mitranyc on Instagram and TikTok) am currently a full-time social media influencer in the financial media space focusing exclusively on short-form video content that has generated 10m+ views over the past 12 months.\n- Hosting Experience: I have hosted/moderated one Beanstalk AMA which received positive feedback. Have extensive experience hosting & moderating large format chats and ran two of the biggest South Asian rooms on Clubhouse, along with a litany of in-person events throughout my 10-year corporate career in finance. My hosting style is both engaging + informative and I have subject-matter expertise with regards to Bean, cryptocurrency & finance.\n- Incentives: I have invested (via sowing) a significant portion of my personal savings into the Beanstalk protocol and as such, am highly interested in the long-term success of the platform. To that effect, I’d like my $BEAN compensation to be ‘sowed’ vs. paid outright to reflect this long-term commitment.\n\nProposal & Details:\nI propose to both manage + create video content for Bean Protocol across both Instagram and TikTok while ensuring the best informational content & relevant news (e.g. updates within Discord) are reflected across platforms.\n\nPayment: one time payment of 10,000 $BEAN, to be sowed; includes the ongoing responsibilities outlined below:\n\nSocial Media (Instagram, TikTok) Manager Duties\n- Set up & manage Instagram & TikTok accounts\n- Instagram: @beanstalkprotocol (already set up)\n- Tiktok: @beanstalkprotocol (already set up)\n- Create regular engaging video content to educate, inform & address questions\n- Incorporate content from users within the community via feed posts (Instagram), including but not limited to:\n-- Twitter FAQ carousels\n-- Pictures of NFTs\n-- Memes generated by community members\n-- Screenshots from Bean.Money platform to demonstrate market & platform updates\n-- Step-by-step how-to’s regarding capital deployment on Bean Protocol\n-- Update Bean Protocol community on social media progress, incorporate feedback and\naddress concerns\n-- Host ‘live’ discussions (e.g. IG Live, TikTok Live) to engage followers and answer questions regarding the platform\n\nCommitments:\n- Commit to the regular creation, assembly and distribution of content amounting to a minimum of 10hrs/week on an ongoing basis, to be reviewed 6 months from the date of approval of this proposal (if approved)\n- Ensure security of social media accounts (Instagram, Tiktok)\n- If applicable, ensure orderly handover of social media assets to an incoming social media manager with full transparency\n- Answering private messages/DMs regarding Beanstalk Protocol on Instagram & TikTok\n- Acting as the main point of contact for Instagram & TikTok within the community to facilitate community requests related to Instagram & TikTok\n- Host AMA’s within Beanstalk Protocol, subject to the discretion of the community and/or key presenters (e.g. Publius)\n",
