      "content": "# PIP-53: Revision of Social Escrow Expiry Claims\n\n\n**Abstract**\n\n\nThis proposal aims to revise the current Social Escrow distribution method to remove epoch rewards expiry from the next epoch onwards.\n\nWith this change, the Governance Committee will be able to verify and produce the distribution files again during the grace period, ensuring a timely distribution of rewards. Additionally, this is a strong first step towards the decentralization and automation of the verification and distribution process of Social Escrow rewards. \n\n\n**Review**\n\nWhen the current Social Escrow distribution system was established, a Grace Period of a week was set to allow the Governance Committee to calculate, verify, and potentially contest the epoch distribution.\n\nWhile the Grace Period worked as expected during the first six epochs, the start of expiring claims introduced an additional constraint that affected the epoch distribution calculation. The fact that a user can claim their previous epochs accumulated rewards during the grace period makes it nonviable to calculate and verify them until the end of the grace period, as the rewards balance would have to be recalculated again. \n\nThe narrowing of the calculation period from one week to within the day of distribution is far from ideal, as this period has to include calculations, data verification, validation, and signature collection. Thus, delays in each epoch of reward distributions become inevitable. This also magnifies the risk of distribution errors and calculations, leading to potential loss of funds. \n\nAdding numbers to it, since the start of PSP 2.0 and until Epoch 11 (the last epoch with reward expires at the moment of writing), less than 3% of the ETH distributed was not claimed (19.47 ETH unclaimed from 665.92 ETH distributed). The average unclaimed ETH over total ETH distributed was higher during the first 3 epochs (3.9%) but decreased during the following 8 epochs as the PSP 2.0 system consolidated, multichain staking was released, and stakers got used to the claiming process reaching 2.2%. \n\n\nFollowing this analysis, we believe the costs of delayed and potential errors with fund loss in distributions significantly outweigh the ETH that can be claimed back. Removing the epoch expiry can serve as a key first step to facilitate the distribution and unlock higher degrees of composability and automation.\n\n\n**Goals**\n\n* Remove the epoch rewards expiry, which is currently set to 6 epochs.\n* Incentivise participation from new/small stakers initially limited by the 6 epoch expiry times\n* Eliminate the post-distribution verification required for expired claims, allowing for complete calculation, verification, and signature collection throughout the Grace Period\n* Prepare for the transition to a more automated distribution system\n* Facilitate the composability of PSP staking into other DeFi products (eg. Interest Rate derivatives, auto-compounders)\n\n\n**Means**\n\n\nThe change does not require any additional development resources from the DAO.\n\n\n**Implementation Overview**\n\nThe proposal will alter the way future distribution Merkle roots are generated, resulting in no expirations from all future distributions.",

      "title": "PEP-07 - Grant Request From the ParaSwap Foundation Regarding March 20th Vulnerability",
      "content": "**Abstract**\n\nOn March 20, 2024, a vulnerability was discovered on the Augustus V6 contract. Immediate action was taken, which included pausing the API and reverting to V5. After these actions, white hat operations were conducted, securing over $3.4 million in assets, followed by a return process of these secured funds for users who had revoked their V6 contract permissions.\n\nCertain users remained vulnerable until they revoked their V6 contract permissions, and some added funds before revoking. Some of their wallets were then drained by hackers, unfortunately.\n\nThe hackers have been contacted and some agreed to a partial return after negotiations. However, we have to date not been able to recover all funds taken from the V6 contract. The Foundation has considered it important to provide full refunds to affected users with a view to the long-term sustainability of this project. This proposal outlines a mechanism for those affected by the vulnerability but not covered by the white hat hack and requests a grant from the DAO to help refund users.\n\n**Goals and Review**\n\nOn March 20, a security vulnerability was discovered on the Augustus V6 contract. This vulnerability was considered a critical priority, as anyone who had given permissions to the V6 contract could be affected by it. We have made every effort to communicate at various social media channels to brief users on the need to revoke all their V6 contract permissions immediately.\n\nAfter the vulnerability was found, developers took immediate action to address the vulnerability, including the pausing of the API and removal of all V6 contracts from the UI. Additionally, Augustus V6 has been self-destructed on all chains where it was possible (Polygon, BSC and Avalanche). Furthermore, core developers and white hat hackers executed a series of follow-up recovery operations, including 0xc0ffeebabe.eth, who recovered approximately $700,000.\n\nIn total, the white hat recoveries managed to secure a total of $3.4 million plus reduce any future ParaSwap user from being affected, as the contracts were stopped less than 48 hours after their public release.\n\nDespite these recovery measures, two categories of users were still affected by the vulnerability:\n\n1. Pre-white hat victims: These users were exploited before the white hack operation. In total, $24,000 of assets were lost.\n2. Post-white hat asset deposit with compromised V6 contract permissions: These instances occurred when a user deposited funds on a still compromised address, resulting in an exploit. In total, ~$840,000 is still outstanding.\n\n> UPDATE: Following new [developments](https://twitter.com/paraswap/status/1775793881344299112), the outstanding amount has been reduced to ~$340k\n\nThe list of all affected user addresses can be found here: https://pastebin.com/JiJThtVq.\n\nIn the view of the Foundation, to support the community and promote the ongoing vitality of the protocol, it is essential to offer compensation to pre-white hat and post-white hat victims as described in the two categories outlined above, up to the point of this proposal. Accordingly, the proposal sets the following goals:\n\n1. Earmark funds from the treasury to compensate users whose funds were not returned by the white hat operation and have heeded our instructions to revoke V6 contract permissions at the time of this proposal.\n2. Design and execute a process for compensation using the earmarked funds.\n\nWhile we do not believe that there is a legal obligation on any party other than the exploiting parties to compensate users whose funds have not been recovered following the V6 contract exploit, we believe in the circumstances, it is right and appropriate and in the best long-term interest of the protocol that the DAO considers the compensation proposal as soon as possible. As such, the voting window will be 48 hours.\n\nAn appropriate post-mortem will be carried out following this proposal. The situation is still ongoing and is being carefully addressed and analyzed.\n\n**Means**\n\nThe ParaSwap Foundation has already been taking an active role in mitigating the consequences of this vulnerability. This proposal aims to request the following assets currently not used by the DAO for complete user compensation:\n\n* The unused wETH/ETH accumulated by the DAO until epoch 15, totaling ~150 wETH.\n* The accumulated FTM from Fantom’s Gas Program, totaling to 27,207.53 FTM.\n\nThe amount of the assets can be estimated from [this ](https://zapper.xyz/bundle/0x619BBf92Fd6bA59893327676B2685A3762a49a33,0xf93A7F819F83DBfDbC307d4D4f0FE5a208C50318,0x8c1a1D0b6286F35d47a676aB78482f1cf3D749dC,0xABF832105D7D19E5DEC28D014d5a12579dfa1097,0xAFFdeC0FE0B5BBfd725642D87D14c465d25F8dE8,0x5487683dc3216655D0C8AA31255e2e313b99B477,0x7dA82E75BE36Ab9625B1dd40A5aE5181b43473f3,0x9060C482AB7d1b99504FC7D5f597fF61818B4F77,0x65136b3E4f012e4c13Aff0926091E2eadCFEdB42?tab=wallet)bundle.\n\nThe requested funds will be allocated towards user compensation and addressing additional expenses from the exploit. The Foundation will cover the remaining costs linked to the vulnerability, including the refunds, the engagement of security analysts, conducting thorough contract re-audits, communication with authorities, and the formulation and execution of the refund process.\n\n**Implementation Overview:**\n\n1. Transfer of requested funds to the ParaSwap Foundation.\n2. Creation of a claims process by the ParaSwap Foundation.\n3. Return of funds by affected parties for all who complete the claims process.\n\nWhile these steps are happening, the team will be dedicated to providing updates and serving the community to rectify the situation.\n\n> UPDATE: Following new [developments](https://twitter.com/paraswap/status/1775793881344299112), the outstanding amount has been reduced to 103 ETH",

      "title": "After a Successful DAO Vote, Paraswap decided to Launch the 1 Phase of the $gPSP Distribution",
      "content": "Background\nParaswap DAO governance is considering altering the PSP Gold allocation rate, a newly approved function where 1% of bridge volume fees are converted to $gPSP. $gPSP has the potential to increase bridge transaction volume and reward holders, but will $PSP face market cap reduction if a derivative token supply is increased, or will the increase in bridge volume contribute to greater value for users. \n\n- Proposal\nIncrease $gPSP from 1% of bridge volume fees to 2% bridge volume to further incentive bridge usage and reward the ENS community. Maintain $gPSP biannual rewards distribution timeline to encourage bridge prioritization and bolster market sentiment. Currently, for every $1M of bridge volume, $10,000 will be allocated to the $sGOLD treasury. This proposal suggests contributing $20,000 to $gPSP for every $1M of bridge volume, which will later be distributed to bridge users based on wallet activity. A majority vote of 51% or greater is required for the protocol to implement this new addition. \n\n- What is $gPSP and when is the first distribution?\nParaswap DAO has voted to implement $gPSP rewards for the first distribution, which is live for users from February 19, 2024 to March 15, 2024. Each $PSP holder is eligible if their wallet is older than 7 days, and they have made a txn with $PSP. $gPSP distribution rate will be based on wallet solvency levels and bridge volume. \n\nIf you haven't already, check (paraswapdefi.org) if you are eligible for the Phase 1 $gPSP Rewards Distribution. \n\n- Execution\nIf this proposal receives a majority vote of 51% or greater, $gPSP treasury allocation rate will increase from 1% to 2% to further reward bridge users and hopefully increase overall bridge volume. \n\nIf the new reward's allocation rate is accepted, it will be implemented in the 2024 Q1 distribution. \n\nDon't forget to check if you are eligible for the Phase 1 $gPSP distribution if you have been an active $PSP user or staker. \n\n![CustomersParaswapScreen@2x.png](ipfs://bafkreihyoyt5kcek5yftt4emnuqxcr7z3pwg3n7lpauoh65iptq4lw7nb4)",

No other major changes are proposed to the gas refund programme in this proposal.\n\n**Goals & review**\n\nSince the last renewal of the budget with the PSP 2.0 proposal ( https://snapshot.org/#/paraswap-dao.eth/proposal/0xdaac1961439e9daf6a8327877667f837d7c07c4b143c41b25833725f63fa672e) , a total of ~29M PSP out of the total budget of 30 Million PSP has been used for the purpose of gas refunds. This PSP has been distributed more or less at a rate of ~1.1M PSP per epoch, with an exception being during the release of PSP 2.0:\n\n![|624x399](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/paraswap1/original/1X/558e9fe7353308f7974f087594f24ed1578ef0ff.png)\n\nFrom these figures, we believe that the gas refund programme has proven useful in its current form to attract stakers to continue trading with ParaSwap, as well as encourage new users to engage in our staking and ParaSwap ecosystem.\n\nAs we near the end of the former allocations of PSP, we wish to renew the budget for an additional 45M PSP to be distributed. This ensures that we have both enough PSP to ensure distribution in the next epoch, as well as cover for increased staker activity and volumes that we have recently seen.\n\nFinally , we wish to emphasize that due to the time sensitive nature of this proposal, we wish to not propose any alterations to the current refund system, and instead, we can explore a separate proposal for improvements if needed.\n\n**Means/Implementation Overview**\n\nThe means and implementation overview sections have been merged on this proposal, as unlike others they are both identical: Renew the GRP budget as-is with a 45M PSP approval. \n\nIf not approved, GovCo might not have sufficient PSP for a timely distribution of Epoch 10 Gas Refund Rewards, as we are nearing the end of the current budget.",

      "content": "# PIP51: Update Community Token List to Increase Quote Competitiveness & Gas Efficiency\n\n____\n\n# Abstract\n\nCurrently, ParaSwap smart contracts accrue surplus revenue for every trade in which this event occurs, regardless of the token pair on which this trade happens. Because of this surplus event, the gas spending of the trade increases, which leads to lower trade efficiency and, thus, lower overall volume.\n\nAfter analyzing the last 365 days of the amount of revenue generated by the thousands of tokens traded through ParaSwap, we have noticed that the top 461 tokens account for 97.94% of the total fees generated. However, even with the large majority of fees concentrated in a few tokens, ParaSwap checks and takes surplus from every single token, increasing gas consumption and making ParaSwap’s quotes less competitive than its competitors.\n\nThis proposal aims to amend the community token list into the tokens responsible for 97.94% of the revenue generated by the DAO and only to take surplus fees from these tokens. Additionally, we aim to simplify the ParaBoost volume metric, increasing the amount of overall trades that will be eligible.\n\nWe expect this new list to not only significantly affect volume thanks to the increased gas efficiency but also reduce the amount of $PSP emissions in gas refunds per trade compared to prior methods. Thanks to these efficiency improvements, we expect to increase ParaSwap's competitiveness in the market.\n\n# Goals & review\n\nThe main objective of this proposal is to increase the gas competitiveness of ParaSwap contracts and thus bring more volume thanks to this increased efficiency. To do this, it is essential to remove any unnecessary gas spent whenever possible, such as the changes done in [PIP 32](https://snapshot.org/#/paraswap-dao.eth/proposal/0x95c0961f9cb8ea22723621a05e4e1142e70c108e35c3973d1b03b1e8ba70c165)\n\nThe justification for this change in whitelisting comes from an analysis of the fees generated in the last year. In this graph, we can see the distribution of the ~$1.45M of fees generated over the last year over each of the tokens that have been processed:\n\n![624x224](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/paraswap1/original/1X/8b22d8bfd9505454ed5e46fd628d0d820665b0c9.png)\n\nAs we can see above, there is a ‘long tail’ distribution of fees happening, where of over ~21,400 tokens accruing fees by ParaSwap, the vast majority of them do not constitute a significant share of the total accrued and are very hard to convert to ETH without losing a big part of the amount in gas and slippage. Additionally, unusual tokens, such as rebase tokens, are not supported by our Fee Claimer but are still collected, which leads to reverts on swaps.\n\nAs these unusual tokens tend to be paired with more common ones, we also suggest a simpler system for counting Paraboost which will make many trades more eligible: destTokens will be checked for sell orders, and srcToken for buy ones.\n\nIn addition to the long tail, another trend we see is a few tokens driving the vast amount of fees generated by the protocol. To clarify, only 461 out of 21,467 (2.1%) accounted for 97.9% of fees generated. In addition, we decided to include a new token list for Base and zkEVM, which previously did not have community token lists. Due to the relatively recent deployments on these chains, we propose to add the major tokens from each chain.\n\nOutside of these tokens, the additional gas intensity caused by the action of fee collection generates a higher opportunity cost from volume missed than any fees accrued from it.\n\nBecause of this, we wish to increase the efficiency of the protocol by enabling fee generation only when the benefit outweighs the gas cost.\n\n# Means\n\nThe following proposal is a technical upgrade similar to [PIP-32](https://snapshot.org/#/paraswap-dao.eth/proposal/0x95c0961f9cb8ea22723621a05e4e1142e70c108e35c3973d1b03b1e8ba70c165), which successfully led to gas efficiency improvements and revenue growth.\n\nWe propose to implement a whitelist feature to the ParaSwap protocol contract consisting of the following [tokens list](https://github.com/paraswap/community-token-list/pull/30/files) and to add a security measure by capping the surplus at 1% max to ensure that users won’t suffer any significant loss due to exceptional pricing bugs, as well as excluding rebase tokens from this list, as in the past fee claiming of rebase-type tokens has lead to issues claiming it from the Fee Claimer contract.\n\nFuture tokens can be added through a governance proposal to ensure that tokens are added swiftly if needed.\n\nAdditionally, to ensure partners do not suffer a hit from this efficiency improvement, they will not have any changes compared to their prior experience.\n\n# Implementation Overview\n\n1. Implement a smart contract update to allow whitelisting\n2. For ParaBoost calculations, only check eligible tokens on the destTokens for sell orders and srcTokens for buy orders.\n3. Introduce the following tokens onto the community [token lists](https://github.com/paraswap/community-token-list/pull/30/files)\n4. Allow for the repository maintainers + governance proposal to amend the list as needed, as long as the token is not a rebase-type token nor a well-known scam\n5.

      "title": "PIP-50 : Plan to reduce $PSP total supply - Revoke and burn DAO vesting of year 3",
      "content": "## Authors\n\nXut, Albist\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal addresses a key aspect of our protocol's evolving tokenomics, particularly in the context of the changes post-Social Escrow (SE) introduction. With a maximum PSP supply set at 2 billion and 870 million allocated for DAO treasury over 4 years, the current reward mechanism has increasingly shifted towards $Eth yields, reducing $PSP's role to primarily covering gas refunds.\n\nGiven this shift and the fact that the DAO currently holds approximately 5.5 million $PSP and will claim the ~283 million left from years 1 (~ 83M) & 2 (200M) in January.\nThis proposal suggests burning/revoking the vesting $PSPs tokens planned for year 3 (200M of $PSPs) which were primarily intended for the PSP1.0 incentive program.\nThis move will reduce the maximum supply of $PSP from 2 billion to 1.8 billion.\n\nConsidering the average gas refund expense of 1.5 million $PSP per epoch (30 million per year), and rounding up to 40 million annually to account for new users with constant gas/token prices, the DAO will have sufficient funds to cover expenses for the next years.\n\n## Goals & Review\n\n### Objectives\n\n* Realign the Protocol’s Tokenomics: Adapt token distribution to align with the current reward distribution strategy post-Social Escrow (SE) introduction  and **reducing its maximum supply from 2 billion to 1.8 billion**.\n* Ensure Economic Sustainability: Align token supply with actual usage patterns and rewards distribution for long-term stability.\n* Alter Diluted Supply: The current diluted supply of $PSP stands at **38%**. This proposal, by reducing the total supply, will increase the diluted supply percentage to approximately **42.02%**, enhancing market perception and valuation.\n\n### Success Metrics\n\n* Achievement of a reduced maximum $PSP supply from 2 billion to 1.8 billion.\n* In the long term, reduction in the quantity of $PSP distributed for gas refunds due to an increase in value.\n* Increase in the diluted supply from 38% to approximately 42.02%, indicating a healthier market status for investors.\n* Positive community response, endorsing the strategic changes in token distribution.\n\n### Potential Risk Points\n\nWhile this proposal aims to strengthen the protocol’s economy and the value of the $PSP token, it’s important to acknowledge and plan for potential risks :\n\n* While it is unlikely, there is a possibility that the market could perceive the sudden reduction in the total supply negatively. This concern arises despite the fact that the tokens in question are DAO funds, as it still represents a significant change in the tokenomics.\n* A crucial consideration is the relationship between the amount of $PSP rewarded per epoch and the token's market value. By reducing the DAO’s treasury in $PSP tokens, there is a risk that, should the token price not increase as anticipated, the protocol may eventually lack sufficient tokens to continue the gas refund rewards as planned. However, it's important to note that the remaining ~289 million $PSP in the DAO’s treasury, based on the current distribution rate of approximately 1.5-2 million $PSP per epoch, should suffice to provide rewards for several years, mitigating immediate concerns regarding reward sustainability.\n\n## Means\n\nRevoking vesting token will send them to the vesting contract owner (which is the DAO treasury) : \n* Revoke year 3 vesting (200M $PSPs receive) : 0xb074094d2E858b25D129989644248F9F6946e081\n* Transfer 200M $PSPs to 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD address. (address zero is blocked by the contract)\n\n## Implementation Overview\n\n#### Implementation Steps:\n\nCoordinate with DAO’s signers to execute the revoke and burn of the specified years.\n\n#### Future Considerations:\n\nPotential future adjustments in token supply on economic performance and community feedback.\n\nEstimated Timeline: The full implementation is expected to take 1-2 weeks after approval.\n\n## Voting option\n\n* Yes - Revoke & Transfer year 3 vesting to Dead address\n* No - Don’t burn\n* Abstain\n\nEdit 1 : update the proposal to only focus on year 3 instead of year 3 & 4",

      "title": "PIP-49 - Shielded voting for ParaSwap Governance",
      "content": "## Abstract\nParticipation in ParaSwap DAO votes fluctuates greatly depending on the subject, but remains low overall when compared with the PSP staked and the voting power used.\n\nThere are a number of possible ways of boosting participation, such as introducing a delegate system, increasing communication (although this is more than reasonable), etc.\n\nThis proposal in the making would like to introduce Snapshot's 'Shutter' module.\nThis module allows votes to be kept temporarily private until the end of the voting period and then made public once the voting period is over.\n\nThe aim is to pass this research topic to a Governance proposal topic by the end of the week (22 December), then to carry out a temp check on 29 December for a vote on 2 January (potential 1 week delay if comments made about the holiday season).\n____\n## Goals & review\nThe aim of this proposal is to activate this feature on snapshot.\n\nYou will find below a presentation of the feature as well as discussions and tests that have already taken place on this subject in other DAOs.\nIn my opinion, although useful, the experience of other DAOs should not obscure the fact that each DAO is different, whether in terms of its community, its state of decentralisation or its adoption.\n\n**Shutter:**\n[Presentation](https://blog.shutter.network/shutter-brings-shielded-voting-to-snapshot/)\n[Demo](https://snapshot.org/#/pistachiodao.eth/proposal/0xa5077ef17097b1d59304b110337bd1c7ce98d95d3ff81d138c3886a80074b4d9)\n\n**TL;DR**\nDuring the vote:\n  * You can see who has voted.\n  * You can see the voting power of the voters.\n  * You can NOT see the voting choice of the voters.\n  * You can NOT see the global voting choice.\n\nAfter the vote ends:\n  * You can see each voter's choice\n  * You can see the final result\n\n**Other DAO similar discussions:**\n[AAVE](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-private-voting-for-aave-governance-2-month-trial/12730)\n[SAFE](https://forum.safe.global/t/sep-x-partial-private-voting-through-shutter/3558)\n[DYDX](https://dydx.forum/t/drc-private-voting-for-dydx-governance-2-month-trial/373)\n\n\n**Pros:**\n- Enhances the overall security and integrity of the Snapshot platform by making it more difficult for bad actors to interfere with the voting process.\n- Reduces Herd Mentality: Promotes independent decision-making and discourages voters from being swayed by the trends or decisions of early voters.\n- Upholds Voter Confidentiality: Safeguards voter privacy by keeping individual voting preferences undisclosed, until the voting period ends.\n\n\n**Cons:**\n- If a delegation system is set up, the people delegating will not be able to see on the snapshot whether their delegate's vote is acceptable to them.\n*In my opinion, a delegate should also communicate his choice upstream and in parallel of the Snapshot to those who delegate to him.*\n- The fact that the vote is hidden prevents discussion during the vote.\n*The ParaSwap DAO's temp check system, which is necessary before the Snapshot is created, marks a symbolic stop on the content of the proposal that will be put to the vote. At this stage, the author of the proposal has judged that the discussions have gone far enough to launch the vote. There is, of course, nothing to stop discussions continuing on the forum.*\n\n____\n## Means\nIt is only necessary for an administrator of the [ParaSwap DAO Snapshot space](https://snapshot.org/#/paraswap-dao.eth) to activate this functionality in Snapshot settings so that all subsequent proposals take it into account.\nEt voilà!\n\nGiven the ease of implementation, the proposal requests activation of this feature within 5 days of acceptance of this proposal, if applicable.\n____\n## Implementation Overview\nActivating the \"Shutter\" module can improve participation and the voting process.\nIt will need to be accompanied by further action to improve the DAO governance process.",

      "content": "## Abstract\nThe DAO treasury will evolve with PIP-45: Enable ParaSwap Foundation to facilitate $ARB and $OP incentives , removing the ability to use these two assets to fund initiatives.\n\nSo I set out to take stock of the DAO’s treasury, thinking that everything would be in the “one” multisig indicated in the documentation. Unfortunately, the assets in the wallet are incomplete.\nLet me reassure you right away: all the funds are clearly identifiable and can be found on public addresses available in the documentation here and here .\nTransparency is assured, but simplicity of access to this information is less so: what does DAO own?\n\nYou'll find in the forum post a breakdown of said wallets / contracts.\n\nIdentified assets present on wallets other than the DAO’s main Multisig are:\n\n- $PSP in vesting contracts\nSome $PSP in the vesting contract are claimable, but not claimed and still in the contract.\nConsequences = circulating supply undervalued, can be a deterrent for potential investors + difficulty in identifying DAO’s treasury position.\n- WETH from staking rewards going to the DAO\nConsequence = difficulty in identifying DAO’s treasury position.\nGoals & review\n\nThe aim here is not to do treasury management, in the sense that this proposal is not intended to use this or that asset.\nThe sole purpose of this proposal is to reorganise the assets available in the DAO’s public wallets into the wallet that is identified to hold the DAO’s treasury.\n\nPotentially negative points to this proposal:\n- Aggregating assets in a single wallet may increase the risk in the event of a hack. fragmenting liquidity as today avoids a single point of failure. even if it makes reading the DAO’s treasury complicated.\n- Moving these assets will inevitably entail significant work for multisig signatories.\n\n## Means\n### Claim vesting contract as follow:\nYear 1 & 2\n- Harvest all remaining tokens first week of jan 2024 (83M + 200M $PSP)\n\nYear 3\n- Q1 2024 harvest first week of april 2024 (50M $PSP)\n- Q2 2024 harvest first week of july 2024 (50M $PSP)\n- Q3 2024 harvest first week of oct 2024 (50M $PSP)\n- Q4 2024 harvest first week of jan 2025 (50M $PSP)\n\nYear 4\n- Q1 2025 harvest first week of april 2025 (50M $PSP)\n- Q2 2025 harvest first week of july 2025 (50M $PSP)\n- Q3 2025 harvest first week of oct 2025 (50M $PSP)\n- Q4 2025 harvest first week of jan 2026 (50M $PSP)\n\n### Bridge and transfer assets to the main multisig:\n- Bridge/transfer WETH & PSP from fee claimer DAO wallets to the main multisig (except from the mainnet and optimism ones)\n- Harvest the staking rewards from the mainnet fee claimer to the main multisig on the same dates as the vesting claims\n\n## Implementation Overview\nThis proposal, if accepted, will trigger the transfer and/or claim of assets to the DAO main multisig, doing so, it will clarify the DAO’s treasury state, but also the metrics of the $PSP token (updated circulating supply).\n\n## Voting option\n- Claim $PSP and regroup assets to the main multisig\n- Claim $PSP but do NOT regroup to the main multisig\n- Do nothing\n- Abstain",

      "title": "PIP-46: QUESTLY/PARASWAPDAO Christmas Adventure",
      "content": "Authors:\nQuestly (@MaxQuestly , @Greta), @stikers , @Paradigme\n\nAbstract\nFor several months, major efforts have been made on Paraswap to improve the product/protocol. However, the community aspect may have been neglected.\n\nToday, there are very few ways of building loyalty, growing the community or expanding media coverage. Very few networks are active, and most are quiet and unattractive. It’s striking: low participation in the DAO forum and a general lack of interest in our community.\n\nFinally, our protocol, its yield and everything that makes Paraswap a success today are often misunderstood.\n\nThis is why we are proposing the creation of a real community tool in partnership with QUESTLY.\n\nQuestly\nWhat is Questly?\n\nQuestly is a white-label quest hub that allows projects to engage, acquire, retain, and monetize communities. We created Questly after helping ClipperDEX to reach more than 100k users in Discord while increasing their trading volume by 8.5X times during campaigns.\n\nWhat you can do in Questly:\n\n1. White-label & tailored development:\n\nWe build so you don’t have to. Custom gamification and fun quests showcased with Paraswap branding will help you reach goals and keep your community safe inside your own space.\n\n2. Unify third-party quests:\n\nWant to grow your community with QuestN, Galxe, or Zealy? No problem, we centralize the user experience in Questly and give your community a proper place to connect.\n\n3. In-House quests:\n\nWant to retain your current community instead? Then, don’t make them leave your space by interacting with other quest tools. Use ready-made quests built inside our product.\n\nGoals & review\n\nConcerned about making Paraswap more attractive, Questly came to propose its service to the DAO (see Questly first proposal 4). The lack of engagement to this proposal and the lack of knowledge of our DAO led us to propose a partnership with QUESTLY. By working hand in hand with active members of the DAO, QUESTLY can be sure of a successful partnership with PARASWAP.\n\nThe main objectives are the following:\n\nEngage\n\nKeep users active with interactive challenges and activities.\n\nAcquire\n\nAttract new users with enticing quests.\nMonetize\nBoost volume and revenue.\nRetain\nReward loyal users.\n\nParaswap Christmas Adventure\n\nWith the help of Questly COO, Greta, we have drawn up a roadmap for the first season of quests that we want to implement:\n\n25 quests, just like an Advent calendar, from 1 December to 25 December, 1 mission per day\n\nFun and rewarding experience for users\n\nWe won’t spoil the planned quests, but we’ve done real research to offer the most interesting ones.\n\nHere’s a sneak peek: quiz, trading competition, …\n\nQuestly has already started the implementation of several new quests, which we have requested on behalf of Paraswap in order to pioneer community attraction.\n\nResources\n\nThe quest season will be announced on the networks and will last 25 days, as explained above. Stikers and Paradigme will work closely with Questly throughout the season.\nStikers and Paradigme will be responsible for managing the Questly Paraswap front pages and writing the quests.\nQuestly will provide bug support and continue to develop for future seasons.\n\nTwitter\n\nFor this season to be a real success, we need to publish Tweets through Paraswap Twitter. At least:\n\nBefore the launch of the campaign to prepare and engage users\nFor the start\nAt specific dates during the quest season in line with the planned schedule\nAt the end of the season to bring this great event to a close\nAnd for rewards distribution\n\nDiscord\n\nA discord channel will be set up for the occasion to help the community with any difficulties encountered during the seasons.\n\nWe ask for a QUESTLY/PARASWAP Christmas Adventure channel to be opened. This will allow users to help each other and discuss the various missions.\n\nMeans\n\nQuestly:\n\nAfter negotiation, for the access of Questly app, the availability of all ready-to-use quests and the development of 8 new quests (including building 2 medium-complexity quests from scratch), Questly is offering the following pricing: $10,000 to be paid in ETH.\n\nETH Safe wallet: 0xE55c1aA36798DF1BE63dE5Fab4B667c6480b9B56\n\nStikers & Paradigme:\n\nFor managing the Questly campaign, imagining the campaign and the quests that make it up, discussions with Questly, monitoring and providing a final summary of the figures for this first season: $1,500 per person, to be paid in sePSP1 (then migrated to sePSP2 with our own ETH).\n\nETH wallets: stikers.eth, paradigme.eth\n\nImplementation overview\n\nAlready done:\n\n10/12/2023 Video meeting with Greta to discuss the feasibility of our collaboration\n10/13/2023 Market study and survey about quests in Crypto\n10/16/2023 Over 20 quests sent to the Questly team for feasibility and dev requirements\n10/18/2023 Test of Questly app in admin mode\n10/25/2023 Feedback from Questly team about quests\n11/02/2023 Pricing discussion\n11/03/2023 Agreement on the quests scope\n11/06/2023 Agreement on the pricing\n11/07/2023 Writing the proposal for Paraswap DAO\n11/15/2023 Finalization of the campaign schedule\n\nOngoing:\n\nPreparation of Paraswap x Questly interface (colors, visuals)\nDevelopment of new quests (Questly team)\n\nNext:\n\nCreation of the discord channel (support)\nPublication on social networks\nLaunch of the event\nFollow-up and community involvement\nProvision of a final summary (figures, …)\n\nRewards : \n\nFor this first season, we really want the prizes to be attractive.\nStandings will be determined at the end of the season. Participants will add up points for each mission they complete. Of course, a ranking will be established to determine the winners.\n\nSo we thought about different possible rewards :\n\n$5,000 in $ETH (for the whole leaderboard)\nDiscord roles to access to specific channels\nNFTs to increase the Paraboost score over an epoch\nNFTs providing 100% gas refund during one epoch (within the current limit of $500)\nCommemorative NFTs of this first season\n\nPartners/Sponsors\n\nA huge thank you to:\nStrateg. — strateg.io — @StrategProtocol 1\nSwaap Finance — swaap.finance 1 — @SwaapFinance 2\n\nContact\n\nWebsite — questly.quest 1\nTwitter — @QuestlyQuest 4\nTelegram — @maxicastello, @GretaAterg\nEmail — greta@gurulabs.cc",

      "content": "# Abstract\nFollowing the PSP-EPΔ02 voted on February 20th, several feedbacks in the discord have been made to add additional tokens in the allowlist of the Paraboost.\nThis proposal tends to agregate those several requests while keeping the spirit of Social Escrow in the allowlist.\n\n# Goals & review\nTaking up the spirit of the first PSP-EPΔ02 proposal, as new projects and networks are developed, and as feedbacks are received from members of the community, it’s a fact that the Token Allowlist to filter healthy trades is missing the tokens of key projects which are either critical players in large ecosystems, important infrastructure present across multiple ecosystems.\n\nAs the research thread has not yet succeeded in finding a consensus allowing tokens to be added to the allowlist according to predefined rules, without the need for a governance vote, the proposal is to add a list of tokens to the allowlist.\n\n# Means\nWe propose to add the following projects and their token addresses in the specified Paraswap-supported chains to the token allowlists.\n\n1. $ARB (ARBITRUM)\nEthereum: 0xb50721bcf8d664c30412cfbc6cf7a15145234ad1\nArbitrum One: 0x912ce59144191c1204e64559fe8253a0e49e6548\n\n2. $wstETH (Wrapped stETH)\nArbitrum One: 0x5979d7b546e38e414f7e9822514be443a4800529\n\n3. $USDC (Circle)\nPolygon : 0x3c499c542cef5e3811e1192ce70d8cc03d5c3359\nArbitrum : 0xaf88d065e77c8cc2239327c5edb3a432268e5831\n\n4. $CAPS (Capsule Coin)\nBNB : 0xFfBa7529AC181c2Ee1844548e6D7061c9A597dF4\n\n5. $PSP (ParaSwap)\nOptimism : 0xd3594e879b358f430e20f82bea61e83562d49d48\n\n\n# Implementation Overview\nThe tokens will be added to the allowlist and will be taken into account when calculating the ParaBoost.\n\n# Voting option\n- Add tokens on the allowlist\n- Don’t add token to the allowlist\n- Abstain",

      "title": "PIP-45: Enable ParaSwap Foundation to facilitate $ARB and $OP incentives",
      "content": "*Posted on Behalf of @Lup for voting*\n\n**Proposal Number & Name**\n\nPIP-45: Enable ParaSwap Foundation to facilitate $ARB and $OP incentives\n\n\n**Abstract**\n\nParaSwap DAO received 450 000 OP destined for Development grants, OP-PSP liquidity, and DexLib integrations as part of the OP grants program. Despite this, a large portion of the grant remains unutilized: for example, 100% of the DexLib portion is still available, and only one proposal has been related to Development.\n\nTo facilitate the use of these grants for the development and betterment of the protocol, and following community feedback, this proposal requests to enable the Foundation to allocate 208 000 $OP grants for the uses initially assigned in the Grant Application, as well as leveraging 233 150  $ARB grant for the uses of Research and Development.\n\nFinally, following community feedback, the Foundation can only claim up to $200 000 USD in token value per calendar month. \n\n**Goals & review**\n\nOf the initial [OP Grant application](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-paraswap/2228), 75% of it was allocated for Grant and Integrations, with 15% of this being specific to DexLib integrations. Despite this, as of the time of writing, a total of 0 OP have been requested for DexLib grants, and only one application has been made related to the technical development of the protocol. This contrasts greatly with the amount of Pull Requests being submitted and collaborated with on the GitHub repo, where over[ 500 requests ](https://github.com/paraswap/paraswap-dex-lib/pulls)have been made, many of which are being initiated by people currently not involved in the ParaSwap Core Team.\n\nOne year after the approval of the grants, we have identified that the current method of requesting Grant Amounts through the DAO has the following limitations, which make it less attractive to developers:\n\n* Slow turnaround time from initial request to implementation\n* Challenging navigation through the DAO proposal procedure, with most developers preferring to interact with a traditional BD team\n* Difficulty working on projects currently in the process of Research and/or Development, as they are not ready for public presentation to the DAO.\n\nIf the ParaSwap DAO wishes to remain accountable and eligible for future grants from other DAOs, it is essential to be able to allocate the remaining grants for the relevant purpose as soon as possible.\n\n**Means**\n\nThe DAO can quickly resolve all the issues listed above by using the ParaSwap Foundation as a facilitator of development-related grants. Not only is the foundation obligated to follow the scope outlined in this proposal, but they will also be able to directly navigate applicants through the process, facilitating the onboarding process to bring more talent to improve the protocol.\n\n**Implementation Overview**\n\nThe following proposal enables the ParaSwap Foundation to become a facilitator for the remaining 208,000 OP assigned for Development and DexLib and the remaining 233,150 ARB.\n\nThe foundation will be able to facilitate these balances for grants related to the following purposes:\n\n* Maintenance of DexLib integrations\n* Research and Development for solutions to further Decentralize the ParasSwap Protocol\n* DAO tooling and automation solutions\n\nIn total, the foundation will not be able to spend more than a total of $200 000 USD per calendar month of the amount given",

      "title": "PIP-44: Grant Application: Integration of ParaSwap on Cobo Custody and Cobo Argus",
      "content": "Abstract:\n \nThis proposal aims to enable listing for ParaSwap (PSP) tokens on Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, and Optimism chains within the Cobo Custody platform, in order to enhance the liquidity and accessibility of PSP. Additionally, we have provided ParaSwap aggregator options for the customized bots on Cobo Argus. Furthermore, this proposal includes plans to publish a promotional article highlighting the partnership between ParaSwap and Cobo.\n\nGoals & Review:\n Cobo is a leading global digital asset custody solutions provider.Founded in 2017 and headquartered in Singapore, Cobo is one of the largest digital asset custodians globally, trusted by over 500 institutional clients across Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North and South America, with billions of dollars in assets under custody.Cobo offers a comprehensive suite of custody technologies from full custody (HSM-based), to co-managed custody (MPC-based), and fully decentralized self-custody (smart contract-based). In addition, Cobo provides Wallet-as-a-Service, SuperLoop (off-exchange settlement network), and Argus (on-chain DeFi strategies and tools with role-based access controls).\n\nThe first goal is to facilitate the listing of ParaSwap (PSP) tokens on Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, and Optimism chains within the Cobo Custody platform. This will significantly improve the liquidity and accessibility of PSP trading for Cobo existing customers include:Bitget,Mexc,Deepcoin,Wootrade etc.For new customers with this integration, clients won't need to invest additional efforts in developing support for PSP on various public blockchains. It will streamline the process and allow developers of all kinds to easily utilize Cobo wallet as a service on their platforms, enabling seamless use of PSP tokens.\n\nThe second objective is to integrate the ParaSwap aggregator into our withdrawal bots, farming bots, and customized bots in Cobo Argus. Cobo Argus is a self custody platform featuring role-based access control, DeFi investment strategies, and a variety of other features built based on Safe. It currently has a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $150 million, with approximately $90 million being utilized by our bots. These bots include withdrawal bots, farming bots, customized bots, and readily available authorization strategies.This integration ensures that when clients use the withdrawal bot, it will automatically utilize ParaSwap to swap tokens during withdrawals. Similarly, for clients using farming bots to provide liquidity, these bots will assist in yield farming and will default to using the ParaSwap aggregator for token swap. Additionally, clients will have the flexibility to customize their bots while having the option to incorporate the ParaSwap aggregator into their setups. \nThe goal of this initiative is to enhance the visibility and recognition of the partnership between ParaSwap and Cobo Custody, along with Cobo Argus. This will be achieved through the publication of a PR article. The success of this goal will be evaluated based on the level of awareness and positive reception generated within the crypto and DeFi communities regarding the collaboration between ParaSwap and Cobo Custody and Cobo Argus.\n\nThe success of this proposal will be evaluated through several key metrics: Firstly, the adoption rate of ParaSwap (PSP) token listings on Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, and Optimism chains within Cobo Custody will be monitored, analyzing transaction volumes and liquidity enhancements post-listing. Secondly, user engagement with the integrated wallet-as-a-service platform will be assessed, tracking activities, wallet creations, and PSP token usage. Thirdly, the extent of integration of the ParaSwap aggregator into withdrawal bots, farming bots, and customized bots will be measured. Additionally, the performance of DeFi bots in increasing profits and optimizing risk management, as well as any growth in Total Value Locked (TVL) within Cobo Argus, will be evaluated. Furthermore, the impact of the PR article highlighting the partnership will be analyzed in terms of community awareness and sentiment. These metrics collectively aim to demonstrate the successful outcomes resulting from the collaboration between ParaSwap and Cobo Custody and Cobo Argus. \nMeans:  Request 15,000 USD in PSP tokens to cover the development effort to implement the test integration of paraswap aggregator in Cobo Argus.  Implementation Overview： \nIf this proposal is approved, we will initiate the listing process of ParaSwap (PSP) tokens on the Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, and Optimism chains within the Cobo Custody platform to enhance PSP liquidity and accessibility. This process is expected to be completed within several weeks.\n\nSecondly, we will integrate the ParaSwap aggregator into our withdrawal bots, farming bots, and customized bots to ensure that when clients use these bots, they can seamlessly use the ParaSwap aggregator for token swaps. Additionally, we will provide clients with the option to customize their bots and incorporate the ParaSwap aggregator into their setups. This integration work is expected to be completed within several months to ensure high quality and security.\n\nLastly, we will prepare and publish a promotional article aimed at enhancing the visibility and recognition of the collaboration between ParaSwap and Cobo Custody, as well as Cobo Argus. This will involve the creation, approval, and publication of PR content, as well as collaboration with the ParaSwap team. It will be completed within several weeks to promptly showcase the partnership to the crypto and DeFi communities.\n\nFuture considerations include ongoing maintenance and optimization of PSP token liquidity on our platform, continued support for the aggregator in our various bots, and further expanding the impact of the collaboration between ParaSwap, Cobo Custody, and Cobo Argus through additional cooperation and promotional activities.",

      "content": "PIP-43 - Decentralized governance - End of trial period - Reviewed ParaTroopers grant\n\nPosted on behalf of Chab, Dseeker, Xut & albist.\n\nAbstract\nThe trial period gave the most active members of the DAO an opportunity to get involved in a more structured way.\n\nA first summary of activities can be found here.\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to extend the ParaTroopers (PT) structure of paid contributors for a period of 3 months from the beginning of Epoch 11, while making a number of changes to improve it.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the ParaTroopers, who were active participants in the DAO before the trial period, continued their support service to the community once the trial period and remuneration were over.\n\nGoals & review\nThe problems\nSelf-assigned roles: no specific organisation of who does what, who validates what. This led to a lot of discussion and sharing, but on several points without going all the way because of a lack of consensus.\nPayment Structure: The Coordinape payment structure, which lets ParaTroopers rate each other’s rewards, as well as the presence of a bonus if the $PSP rewards were staked.\nIt was difficult to rate colleagues without a clear view of their activity, the factor was too subjective and unclear, and there was a lot of work to take into account the bonus and the calculation of rewards (even though all the PTs had staked their rewards at each period).\nNew structure\nCreate three distinct groups within the ParaTroopers, each with a specific area, activity and budget:\n\nTech\nGovernance\nPublicity\nThe tech group will have @Xutyr and @bach working as tech support like they currently do. Providing support to people wishing to join ParaSwap is a pillar of its growth.\n\nThe governance group is made up of @albist, whose main role will be to provide non-technical support on the discord, as well as specific support in relation to the creation of governance proposals. This group will be vigilant on the governance forum to ensure compliance with DAO rules.\nA secondary role will be to come up with ideas to help the DAO develop.\n\nThe publicity working group shall be responsible for communicating the ideas, development and activities of the DAO and promotion of the protocol and its token. This group shall achieve this through the production of the monthly recap, periodic articles and Twitter (X) threads. @Dseeker will lead the group but will need the support of a skilled graphics designer/writer to be efficient.\n\nTrooper organisation\nOnboarding and Offboarding of members:\nOnboarding is kept internal of the ParaTroopers.\nPrevious involvement in the life of the DAO is greatly appreciated.\nTo onboard new members, applicants shall write a pitch on the appropriate governance forum part following the application framework. The application (pitch) shall be reviewed by Troopers and put to vote. The group being applied for must be clearly stated in the application. Subject to vacancy of seat(s) or need for more hands in any working group, a simple majority vote shall be needed for the applicant to be accepted.\nThe motivation for the vote will be published publicly on the forum.\n\nOffboarding\nA member can be offboarded if any of the following occurs:\ni. Direct request from the member.\nii. Failure to fulfil working group objectives twice. The first time shall be a warning strike.\niii. Failure to adhere to the code of conduct of the DAO.\nFor this 3-month period, as the budget is limited, offboarding will be managed internally by ParaTroopers.\nIf the initiative bears fruit and is extended over a longer period, offboarding may also be requested via a proposal from a member of the DAO (vote on the forum or on Snapshot to be defined if necessary).\nOffboarded members shall thereafter be removed from relevant channels and be stripped of all privileges and responsibilities of ParaTroopers.\n\nPayment\nTo remove a non-essential charge from the DAO’s multisig and to avoid unnecessary costs, the proposal requires payment to be fully made on two safe multisig wallet (1 per network), where the signatories will be 2 ParaTroopers and 2 members of the core team (0xytocin + 1 to be validated) with a 3/4 rule.\nSafe will be setup with signers and communicated in the forum before any payment.\nSafe for optimism and Arbitrum: 0xd6ABD29a331eDB915D0eE8597Df50D453F98c7c5\n\nThe multisigs will be used to create a streaming setup to send linearly the rewards to the Troopers.\n\nThe details are:\n\nA fixed amount of $500 per Trooper per epoch (no more bonuses)\nA 50/50 $ARB / $PSP split payment (to allow the ParaTrooper to use part of his rewards without creating selling pressure, $ARB on Arbitrum Network, $PSP on Optimism network)\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeih5rvmeu6ikwfv776k6t42xsmrkohjmyaauawzoxt2na3oie5gzz4)\n    \n\nTransition Period\nWhile all the Troopers represented in this new proposal have continued to support the community after the end of the trial period, we felt it was important to include a request for compensation for the ParaTroopers for the transition period (from Epoch 7 to Epoch 10 inclusive).\n\nAn additional amount of $8000 is requested for the ParaTroopers with the same conditions as the overall payment.\n\nBudget for new members\nThe budget also includes a request for an additional amount to enable the onboarding of new ParaTroopers, so that the initiative can grow flexibly without the need for a new proposal.\nThe aim is to potentially integrate one additional person into each group.\nThis means a budget of $1,500 per epoch, or $4,500 for the whole period.\nThis budget, if not used, will be returned to the DAO at the end of the period.\n\nSnapshot whitelisting\nAfter reviewing the threshold of $PSP required to vote in order to limit abuse, the result is that the majority of votes are created by an intermediary, which centralises the process.\nWe propose that ParaTroopers be whitelisted in Snapshot to act as relays for ParaSwap community initiatives in the governance process\n\nMeans\nTransfer $18500 as detailed below:\n$9250 in $PSP on Optimism at Safe address 0xd6ABD29a331eDB915D0eE8597Df50D453F98c7c5\n$9250 in $ARB on Arbitrum at Safe address 0xd6ABD29a331eDB915D0eE8597Df50D453F98c7c5\n\nBreakdown:\nParaTroopers’ incentive → $6000\nTransition period → $8000\nBudget for new members → $4500\n\nWhitelist ParaTroopers addresses in Snapshot.\n\nImplementation Overview\nThe aim of this proposal is to maintain an active core of community members providing their support within the framework of a decentralised remuneration structure, thereby facilitating the integration of other projects or the arrival of new users.\n\nOf course, it remains for the community to validate the direction in which the ParaTroopers are heading and the scope of their activities.\n\nVoting option\nYes - Allow budget\nNo - Don’t allow budget\nAbstain",

      "title": "PIP-42: Utilizing Aura Finance to bootstrap PSP liquidity on Optimism",
      "content": "Authors: jeffery, json, Oxytocin, aura maxis\n\n**Abstract**\nAura Finance is a meta-governance protocol built on top of Balancer. Aura Finance has topped over $700M in TVL on mainnet and has a massive ecosystem of partners that encompasses everything from major lending markets like Aave, to cross-chain infrastructure providers like Stargate, to top LSD providers like Lido and Rocketpool. In total, Aura has obtained and maintained fruitful relationships with over 40 different protocols within DeFi. Based on its success on mainnet, Aura contributors believe in Balancer’s potential to be a first-choice for protocols considering to either seed or grow liquidity.\n\nAura helps to amplify the effectiveness and growth of Balancer in addition to the protocols within the ecosystem. Aura’s voting incentive markets are one of the most diverse in DeFi, with over 20-30 active participants on any given round. Moreover, Aura has maintained a solid track record in the accumulation of governance influence for veBAL, which has helped to keep markets lively.\n\nIt seems beneficial for the protocol to add the extra yield layer that Aura provides on top of the 80/20 Balancer pools to increase the return for the participants and Paraswap DAO.\n\nWe propose staking the BPT from the 80/20 PSP/OP Balancer / Beethoven X pool 2(on optimism) into AURA and introducing a gauge incentive for it using Aura voting incentives markets.\nThis will generate the following benefits:\n\nIncrease in pool size (liquidity), by encouraging single-sided stakers to migrate to an LP position, increasing the PSP token liquidity;\n\nMake these pools more attractive for market participants;\n\nEnhanced yield generation by staking the BPT token on Aura; and\n\nIntroducing voting incentives with a lower cost;\n\nLiquidity is a major expense for protocols, and often forces farm & dump game theory. Providing better returns on an 80/20 pool than on a single-staking pool means that the protocol can enhance the token liquidity on the market sustainably. Furthermore, staking the POL in Aura will help to increase Paraswap’s influence within the Balancer ecosystem, which can be later used to support cost-effective PSP liquidity and reduce protocol expenses.\n\nUsing Aura as an additional yield layer makes these pools more attractive for market participants. Liquidity Providers improve their returns when staking the BPT token in Aura, as the APR is boosted by Aura emissions. This can incentivize market participants to become Liquidity Providers, as they can lock their AURA rewards into vlAURA, and be rewarded by participating in Aura governance.\n\nAs these pools are the major liquidity source for PSP in Optimism, improving its yield by providing gauge voting incentives on Balancer makes sense. And doing it using Aura is the most cost-effective way: In the last voting round (2023-08-21), the return was $1.21 per $1 provided. 2 This means that it was 21% more effective to use Aura than to provide incentives directly. In addition, on Optimism, thanks to the OP grant Aura received, 1 the voting incentives provided by Paraswap DAO will be matched 1:0.5 by Aura (with a maximum of 25k OP per week), which would lead to even higher efficiency for using AURA market to incentivize.\n\nParaswap can also lock farmed AURA rewards as vlAURA to significantly reduce the need for PSP spending in the future while maintaining a robust liquidity layer on Optimism and Ethereum. Thanks to the recently passed AIP-42, 2 AURA incentives will be distributed from the Aura DAO treasury to be allocated pro-rata to pools based on their vlAURA gauge weight; this will further benefit the “better aligned” liquidity provider, such as POL of Paraswap DAO.\n\nIn view of this efficiency, we propose Paraswap DAO allocate a voting incentive budget of $20k each voting epoch ($10k weekly) to the vlAURA market to help incentivize the pool and bootstrap liquidity. The budget may be adjusted after further evaluating the efficiency and pool utilization.\n\n**Goals & review**\nThe main goals of the proposal are:\n\nImprove yield generation on the 80/20 pools;\nMake these pools more attractive for market participants;\nThe metrics for evaluating the success of this proposal would include:\n\nTVL increase on the ‘Night at the OPara’ pool on Optimism.\n\n**Means**\nAllocate $5K in $PSP + $5K $OP weekly for 10 weeks.\nSwap BAL + OP rewards to $PSP, and distribute it to Stakers in sePSP1 at the end of each epoch.\nGovCo will handle preparing payload and providing program analysis to ensure sustainability and profitability \n\n**Implementation Overview**\nCreating a Balancer Proposal to create a gauge for the 80/20 pool on OP.\n\nIntroducing BPT staking on Aura\n\nStart to incentive gauge voting on Aura\n\nProvide voting incentives to vlAURA market epoch-wise.",

      "title": "Token Burn for PSP Value Appreciation",
      "content": "**Abstract**\nThis proposal seeks to enhance the value proposition of the ParaSwap (PSP) token by initiating a token burn program. By reducing the circulating supply of PSP tokens, we aim to create scarcity, thereby increasing demand and driving up the token's market value. This strategy will benefit long-term PSP token holders and investors.\n\n**Goals & Review**\nThe main goals of this proposal are as follows:\n1. Increase the market value of PSP tokens.\n2. Reward long-term PSP token holders.\n3. Enhance the attractiveness of PSP as an investment.\n\nMetrics for success:\n- Percentage increase in PSP token price.\n- Reduction in circulating supply.\n- Feedback and sentiment from the PSP community.\n\n**Means**\nTo implement this proposal, the following steps and resources are required:\n1. Establish a Token Burn Fund: Allocate a portion of the ParaSwap treasury to a Token Burn Fund.\n2. Define Token Burn Mechanism: Decide on the rules and frequency of token burns.\n3. Community Engagement: Engage with the PSP community to gather feedback and build consensus on the token burn program.\n\n**Implementation Overview**\nIf this proposal is approved, the following steps will be taken:\n\n1. Creation of Token Burn Fund:\n   - Allocate a specific amount of PSP tokens from the treasury to the Token Burn Fund.\n   - Ensure transparency in the management of this fund.\n\n2. Token Burn Mechanism:\n   - Determine a clear and transparent mechanism for token burns. For example, a percentage of trading fees generated on the ParaSwap platform could be periodically used to buy PSP tokens from the open market and burn them.\n   - Publish a regular schedule for token burns, ensuring that the community is informed in advance.\n\n3. Community Engagement:\n   - Establish a communication channel, such as a dedicated forum thread, for community members to discuss the token burn program.\n   - Gather feedback and suggestions from the community regarding the token burn mechanism and frequency.\n   \n4. Execution of Token Burns:\n   - Execute token burns according to the defined schedule and mechanism.\n   - Publicly announce each token burn event, including the number of tokens burned and the transaction details.\n\n5. Monitoring and Reporting:\n   - Continuously monitor the impact of token burns on the PSP token price and circulating supply.\n   - Regularly report the progress and results of the token burn program to the community.\n\nEstimated Time of Implementation: The initial setup of the Token Burn Fund and mechanism can be completed within one month, with ongoing token burns scheduled according to the defined frequency.\n\nFuture Considerations: Depending on the success of the initial token burn program, further adjustments and enhancements may be proposed to continue supporting the value appreciation of the PSP token and ensure alignment with the community's interests.",

      "title": "OP grant application - Reducing gas costs on Arbitrum and Optimism",
      "content": "(Authored originally by @Chab on the forums , posted on his behalf as per request)\n\nAbstract\nOptimistic rollups are gaining tractions and trading volumes. Despite being way cheaper (~10x) than Ethereum to execute trades with Paraswap on it, they are still dependent on gas conditions on Ethereum, so the gas price can increase a lot in case of high gas fees on Ethereum. \nThis proposal aims to develop a callData compression algorithm that would help reduce the gas cost by ~50% for the trades made on Arbitrum and Optimism in order to create another competitive advantage for Paraswap against other aggregators. \nThis reduction would directly contribute to make Paraswap more interesting than its concurrent for small trades and could lead more traders to switch on Paraswap to save important fees over time. This increase in volume will generate sustainable additional revenue to the DAO as these chains are very important chains in the EVM ecosystem.\nThe feasibility of this proposal has been agreed by the core team across several meetings with for example Mwamedacen and 0xYtocyn.\n\n\nGoals & review\nOptimistic rollup transaction price depends a lot on the size of the callData sent with the transaction. This proposal aims to develop a fast polyvalent off-chain compressing algorithm for callData, a decompressing smart contract and integrate them into Paraswap current architecture with the coordination of the team. It is expected to be delivered and deployed before 2024.\nI’m convinced that this development would benefit Paraswap DAO and users by reducing gas costs for any trade, increasing the volume and the revenue on those chains, and contribute to make Paraswap more competitive.\nThe main goal of this proposal is to allocate 25k $OP tokens from the OP grant reserves of Paraswap DAO, in order to fund the different steps of development related to this optimisation and research. The validity of the implementation will be checked by the core team at each stage, as well as a member of the DAO. \n\n\nMeans\n\n- Initial 2k $OP on validation of the grant.\n- research & POC: 5k $OP\n- evaluations and optimisations: 7k $OP + 3k $OP bonus (if average saving > 45%)\n- adaptations of code base and deployment: 8k $OP\nTotal: 22k $OP + 3k $OP performance bonus (around $30k at current $1.4 valuation).\n\nOf these, 500 $OP would be sent to @Xut (who agreed the role) at the end of the two first steps in order to certify the figures have been reached. So 1k $OP is included to bring more confidence to the DAO members that all goals were achieved. \n\nA fee of 5k $OP would be applied to my rewards if the development isn’t live in the end of February 2024, in order to prove my dedication to achieve this proposal fast, except if the team attests it comes from a difference of prioritisation within their inner resources.\n\nIn case the bonus condition or other steps wouldn’t be achieved, the amount for each conditions would be sent back to the DAO OP grant resources.\n\n\nImplementation Overview\n\nResearch & POC:\n* Document gathering ideas for optimising callData size on optimism (could stay confidential if necessary to keep competitive advantage)\n* Implementation of a smart-contract allowing for callData decompression\n* Implementation of a script in JavaScript for compressing callData, to give as a input to the decompression method of the smart contract\n* Compression average rate of at least 25% at this stage required\nConsidering the time that took the discussions and to be sure this proposed proposal will be possible I have quite progressed on that part; and it is possible to deliver this phase in early october.\n\nEvaluations and optimisations\n* Create a framework for evaluating the performance and exactitude of the compressing algorithms regarding a variety of inputs, and the related gas costs\n* Optimise the contract to reduce the callData even more\n* Optimisations on the compressing algorithms\n* Compression average rate of at least 35% is expected at this stage and the algorithm should be efficient (running in few ms)\n* If compression average rate is at least 45%, 5k $OP should be unlocked\nThis phase is estimated to be reached in the mid of November.\n\nAdaptations of code base and deployment\n* Testing in real conditions and final adaptations to the contract for production condition\n* Help and guidance around the necessary modifications in the API and blockchain\n* Internal documentation and flows for the compression well designed and proved\n* Implementation of the compressing algorithm for the Paraswap API specific language\n* Support and slight optimisations post-production if possible\n* Gathering data and analytics around the savings\n* Documentation and redaction of communications of the advantages and savings made through this optimisation\nThis phase is estimated to be released in production before the end of 2023.\n\nAll the materials of my research would be the property of the team and given entirely at each end of stage at least, in order for the team to continue my work if something really bad happened. This way the DAO could find another person to continue the development or the team could decide to improve it and integrate it later on.\nThe code source could become open source with a DAO vote but regarding the competitiveness between aggregators, this work will first be maintained private between the core team, Xut and me.\n\n\nA word\nAs a member of the DAO for 2 years now, and a Paratrooper for 4 epochs, I would like to contribute more to the thrive and sustainability of this great project, and I’m convinced that it can be a great example for people to research and propose optimisations to the DAO.\n\nBest,\nChab",

      "content": "## PIP-41.1 - Post-Trial Period Considerations - Next Steps for the Governance Committee\n \n### **Abstract**\n\nDuring the original implementation period of the PSP 2.0 proposal, a 6-epoch pilot was implemented to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed plans, and along with it the introduction of the Governance Committee (GovCo).\n\nWith this pilot period soon coming to an end, this proposal aims to reflect on the performance of PSP 2.0 and proposes what the future duties of the Governance Committee can be.\n\nThe following vote concerns only the first section of PIP-41, with the second one regarding token allowlists being voted on at a later date. \n\n\n### **Means**\n\n\nDuring the first six months of PSP 2.0, GovCo proved to be effective and to act fast in emergencies. [PSP-EPΔ03](https://snapshot.org/#/paraswap-dao.eth/proposal/0xd8e704f62ca65f18c7457c9797bbc49fb48fd418a451b826fec840131aec64dc) and [PSP-EPΔ06](https://snapshot.org/#/paraswap-dao.eth/proposal/0xc80527637dbf39d63ffd8e73abb673a1e8245237218f87f59dbca22a8da0e906) are good examples of this, as both would not have been possible without a decision-making body to verify the urgency of the matter and approve the solutions.\n\nAs PSP 2.0 shifts away from the trial period, GovCo’s epoch assessments and regular meetings will not be needed anymore.\n\nWhile keeping everything else identical to the original proposal of [PSP-IPΔ26](https://gov.paraswap.network/t/psp-ip-26-establishment-of-a-governance-committee-and-decentralisation-governance-roadmap/1310), we suggest GovCo’s duties to transition to the following:\n\n1. Determine whether a proposal qualifies as a PEP proposal and publish it for a vote on Snapshot.\n\n* As per usual, anyone will be allowed to publish their own PEP.\n* Once the proposal is considered ready for publication by the author, they request the Governance Committee to post on Snapshot.\n\n2. Handle the creation of the recurrent transactions needed to support PSP 2.0 operations:\n\n  1. Upgrade Module sePSP1 unstaking, withdrawing, and approval\n  2. Support for future manual transactions specified on their own proposals\n\n3. Verify and sign transactions needed to support PSP 2.0 operations\n4. Monitor and report potential vulnerabilities or unintended uses of the Social Escrow PSP system, and trigger Emergency Measures if necessary.\n\nPerformance Indicators\n\n1. As a group, GovCo must be able to respond to any formal request for a PEP to be published up to 72 hours from its formal request time in the forums.\n\n  1. This will only apply to the first formal request, if GovCo doesn’t deem the proposal necessary for a PEP, further response times for the revision might vary depending on the amends needed\n\n2. Individual GovCo member duties:\n\n  1. Signing rate of at least 75%, with no more than 3 votes missed consecutively.\n  2. If approving/denying a PEP vote, a rationale for their vote is expected based on their personal decisions\n  3. Although no regular calls are expected anymore, members are expected to have the availability to attend at least 2 calls per epoch, in case it is required\n\n\n### **Implementation Overview**\n\n1. The new set of criteria for the Governance Committee is implemented\n\n—\n\nVoting options\n\nFor\n\nAgainst\n\nAbstain",

      "title": "PIP-40: Grant Application - Institutional onboarding of Meria into the ParaBoost Social Escrow system",
      "content": "(Original Author @Hasheur, published by @Oxytocin on behalf of the author)\n\n\n**Abstract**\nInstitutional onboarding of Meria into the ParaBoost Social Escrow system :\n\nThe following proposal aims to onboard Meria, a regulated institution, and its users into the Paraswap social escrow system. To achieve this integration, Meria is requesting 5,000 USD (Paid in ARB) and 10,000 USD (Paid in PSP which will be converted to sePSP1). If this proposal is approved, Meria will implement sePSP1 staking, list PSP on its website, and utilize Paraswap for all their on-chain trades, benefiting the protocol and the Paraswap community overall.\n\n**Goals & review**\nMeria is a regulated institution (PSAN) in France that offers investment solutions to individuals, companies, institutions, as well as family offices and asset managers. Currently, we manage/have under delegation just under $200 million. Our platform, [https://meria.com](https://meria.com), allows customers to onboard and invest via crypto deposits or buy directly through credit card or bank transfer. If this proposal is accepted by the DAO, Meria will make Paraswap one of its main partners for its on-chain operations. Consequently, all on-chain trades executed by Meria and its users will be processed via Paraswap. Integrating Paraswap's staking module into Meria's interface will enable a new wave of users to join, including institutional entities such as asset managers and family offices.\n\nRegarding the grant utilization, only the allocation of ARB tokens will be sold directly to cover the operational costs involved in listing the PSP on Meria (our request concerns the ARB, and not PSP, to cover our integration costs, as it is more liquid and does not risk affecting the price of the PSP). The second part, in sePSP1 tokens will be staked for a minimum period of 6 months, serving as a basis for increasing the Paraboost of this new staking service. For reasons of simplicity and compliance, we are starting with a product without impermanent loss, but will consider a second version with sePSP2 later. \n\nWe firmly believe that this integration will benefit both parties and contribute to the growth of the Paraswap protocol and ecosystem. With these new inflows, the DAO will benefit from Paraswap's exposure to institutional actors in terms of both visibility and revenue generation, in addition to democratizing PSP staking to over 85k users.\n\nThe main goal of this proposal is to request a grant of 15,000 USD (in PSP and ARB equivalents) to launch the integration of the sePSP1 staking module and list the PSP token on Meria. Additionally, Meria will conduct several communication operations on its social networks (Twitter, Linkedin...) and write two articles to be added to the \"Meria Academy\" blog to promote Paraswap and its services.\n\n**Means**\n\nRequest of 10K USD (Paid in sePSP1) with 6 months of lockup.**\n\nRequest of 5K USD (Paid in ARB) to cover the operational costs of the Paraswap integration.**\n\n\n**Meria would provide the following:**\n\nListing of PSP on the plateform, as well as DEX trades of Meria going through ParaSwap.\n\nThe $PSP tokens purchased on the Meria platform by credit card or bank transfer will be bought directly at the price market.**\n\nProduct listing based on Paraswap staking module to onboard users in the Paraboost social escrow system. To use this product, users will need to purchase or deposit their own $PSP.\n\nCommunication newsletter on the listing to 85k users.\n\nTwo articles on Meria Academy French SEO, the first to explain how Paraswap is working through its App and its objectives.\n\nA second article to explain how its staking module work.\n\n\n**Implementation Overview**\n\nIntroduction of PSP staking on Meria\n\nDistribution of rewards onto Meria staking customers\n\nCreation of marketing materials and articles\n\nListing of PSP token on Meria’s website/app\n\nCreation of a new patern \"staking\" type product, but with a variable APR, and a retroactive credit every 37 days (duration of the epoch, then one week more in order to evaluate the gain from staking over the period) and credited this gain to users.\n\n\n*I hope that this grant proposal will gain your confidence and agreement and I am at your disposal to discuss and clarify certain points of our application. As a personal holder of $PSP and above all a user of its Paraswap application, I would like to carry out an initial operation between our centralised and regulated institution and this incredible example of decentralisation.* Owen Simonin\n\n*Thank you very much.*",

      "content": "Executive Summary\n- ParaSwap's recent launch on the Optimism network provides the perfect timing to showcase PSP 2.0 and its expanded capabilities on a new blockchain.\n- Quest Terminal, a data-driven quest design platform by Rabbithole, offers a unique opportunity to bootstrap ParaSwap on Optimism.\n- Sixdegree aims to leverage Quest Terminal to design compelling quests and incentive programs for ParaSwap.\n- We are applying for a $30,000 grant to be dedicated to quest rewards.\n- The primary objective is to foster sustainable organic growth for ParaSwap on Optimism by encouraging active participation and engagement.\n- Continuous monitoring and community updates of quest data will demonstrate the positive impact of these initiatives.\n- The iterative feedback loop based on quest data ensures effective alignment with the desired goals and objectives.\n\nBackground \nPSP 2.0 Upgrade\nPSP 2.0 is a major update to improve the tokenomics of PSP. It aims to create a more inclusive and rewarding experience for users and establish a sustainable distribution strategy. The update focuses on enhancing staking efficiency, liquidity, and token emissions.\nThe new Social Escrow staking system for PSP (sePSP) is designed to incentivize PSP stakers for contributing to the protocol and DAO's growth. Basically, it expands the idea of veNomics and rewards other socially-positive actions like liquidity pooling. These actions boost your stake, and in exchange you receive real yield in ETH.\nRabbithole Quest Terminal\nRabbithole is an incentive platform to bootstrap projects and networks, enjoying a great reputation in the crypto space. In May 2023, Rabbithole introduced the Quest Terminal, a cutting-edge platform that revolutionizes airdrop programs through high-velocity experiments called \"quests\". This platform is designed to drive innovation and growth by enabling projects and token holders to engage in rapid and phased experimentation.\nThe Quest Terminal provides an all-in-one on-chain solution for creating quests and distributing ERC20 tokens as micro rewards seamlessly and efficiently. With this platform, quest creators have the power to easily design and launch quests, allowing them to explore different approaches and iterate quickly.\nMoreover, the platform offers real-time metrics of quest performance, offering valuable insights into participant behavior. This data equips quest creators with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions, optimize quest designs, and maximize the impact of their experiments.\n\n\nMotivation\nRecently, ParaSwap has been launched on Optimism, marking a significant milestone. This presents a golden opportunity to promote PSP 2.0 and highlight its release on a new blockchain network!\nWe, Sixdegree Lab, are excited to offer our assistance in designing quests and incentive programs for ParaSwap on the Quest Terminal platform. Our aim is to facilitate the rapid growth of ParaSwap on Optimism and encourage the engagement of genuine users.\nWe believe that utilizing Quest Terminal as a platform presents a unique opportunity to incentivize and educate users effectively. By leveraging its data-driven capabilities, we can swiftly iterate on quests and ensure that the incentives provided truly bring value to projects, all while avoiding the sole attraction of airdrop farmers.\nSixdegree will take responsibility for designing weekly quests and monitoring associated data. We are looking forward to a sustainable way to make ParaSwap the top priority when swapping on Optimism. Additionally, we will provide regular blog updates to keep the community informed about the quest's progress and the positive impact it delivers.\n\n\nKPIs to Measure the Impact of Quests on ParaSwap\n1. Increase in new user acquisition: Tracking the number of new users joining ParaSwap after the implementation of quests.\n2. Trading volume growth on Optimism: Monitoring the increase in trading volume on the Optimism layer of ParaSwap, a direct result of the quests.\n3. Staked PSP token amount: Measuring the growth in the amount of PSP tokens (both in sePSP1 and sePSP2) staked by users participating in quests, indicating the engagement level.\n4. Socially-active behaviors: Observing an upward trend in socially-active behaviors related to quests, such as sharing quests on social media or discussing them in online communities.\n5. User stickiness and loyalty: Assessing the enhancement of user stickiness and loyalty to ParaSwap, reflected in repeated usage and prolonged engagement with the platform.\n6. User retention rate improvement: Evaluating the improvement in the retention rate of users who have participated in quests, indicating their satisfaction and continued interest in ParaSwap.\n\n\nProposed Budget\n- We are seeking a grant of $30,000 in total from ParaSwap DAO to support quest rewarding on Quest Terminal.\n- The requested funding is paid either 100% PSP or 50/50 OP + PSP.\n- Quest Terminal requires a fee upon each quest completion. The fee is 20% per reward distributed to participants, equivalent to max $6k for 3-months.\n- The grant funding will be fully utilized to run a series of quests over a period of 3 months.",

      "content": "*(This proposal has been authored by and posted on behalf of @brandonkumar)*\n \n\n**Abstract**\nLayer3 stands as a preeminent web3 education and exploration platform, offering premium content and experiences for both web3 users and developers. Our service and community of over 600,000 high-quality users have made us the preferred platform for more than 90 top web3 projects, including ParaSwap. Layer3 users participate in our immersive quests to discover and learn about Web3 applications and products in the safe and engaging environment of our platform.\n\nLayer3’s support extends across more than 15 blockchains, encompassing all major L1s, zkSync, Polygon zkEVM, and other key L2s including Arbitrum and Optimism. With users completing more than 6 million on-chain actions monthly, Layer3 contributes significantly to the web3 ecosystem growth. Our work with Optimism alone has led to over 40,000 weekly active users, 100,000 monthly active users, and facilitated over 1.5 million monthly transactions.\n\nLayer3 is seeking an OP grant from the ParaSwap DAO to build a staking PSP Staking Quest on Optimism. \n\n\n**Goals & review**\nLayer3 is seeking an OP grant from the ParaSwap DAO to build a staking PSP Staking Quest on Optimism. \n\nLayer3’s grant application aligns with the category of ‘Novel applications of ParaSwap’. Through our Quest, Layer3 aims to empower users to actively engage with ParaSwap’s staking mechanism on Optimism, resulting in initial liquidity bootstrapping on the chain, new user acquisition and community education.\n\nOur grant application strongly aligns with Optimism's objectives of fostering growth within its ecosystem while promoting the use of ParaSwap to enhance dApp developers' access to DeFi services.\n\nBy building the PSP Staking Quest on Optimism, Layer3 will actively contribute to the expansion of the Optimism ecosystem and the growth of the ParaSwap protocol in the chain. The Quest serves as an immersive educational tool that not only educates users about the benefits of staking PSP but also showcases the many features of ParaSwap.\n\nEstimations of users completing the tasks are difficult to do as it depends on several conditions, some of which are under our control and others are not.\n\nHowever, based on the results of the pervious [Layer3 PSP staking campaign results](https://dune.com/l3wizard/paraswap-quest/bd9bcc03-96c1-4f1d-9b88-03505f57bc37) which was done on mainnet, we can expect, at least, to reach the same amount of users completing the campaign (1,039 addresses completed the previous campaign).\n\nIf we take into consideration that mainnet gas fees are 7x higher than Optimism (source: https://l2fees.info/) and that this campaign will be incentivizing users who complete the campaign, we may aim to double the users completing the task (2,078 campaign completions).\n\n* Base scenario: 1,039 addresses staking at least $50 on sePSP2 on Optimism = $51k TVL and 1,039 new PSP stakers on Optimism\n* Optimistic scenario: 2,078 addresses staking at least $50 on sePSP2 on Optimism = $102k TVL and 1,039 new PSP stakers on Optimism\n\n\n**Means**\nRequested funding is $15,000 in OP + matching amount of PSP.\n\nOf the requested amount, $7,500 will be used for covering Layer3 expenses while the rest will be used to incentivize users completing the campaign and holding sePSP2 after the end of it.\n\n\n**Implementation Overview**\nLayer3 will provide the following:\n\n* Quest Development & Production\n  * Concept and design for ParaSwap Staking Quest\n  * Creation of Quest content (e.g. copy, images, animations, videos, etc.)\n  * Development of Quest functionality\n  * Testing and quality assurance\n* Marketing & Promotion\n  * Development and execution of a comprehensive marketing and promotion plan for the Quest\n  * Creation of marketing materials (e.g. social media posts, email campaigns, banner, etc)\n* Technical Support & User Assistance\n  * Ongoing technical support to ensure the Quest runs smoothly and any issues are resolved quickly\n  * User assistance to help participants navigate the Quest and troubleshoot any problems\n* Reporting\n  * Reporting and documentation to provide regular updates on progress and ensure transparency with the ParaSwap community",

      "title": "PIP - 36 : Multichain Staking and Gas Refund Consolidation",
      "content": "# PIP - 36 : Multichain Staking and Gas Refund Consolidation\n\n## Abstract\n\nFollowing the successful deployment of liquidity onto Optimism, the following proposal establishes a framework for Social Escrowed Staking of PSP outside of Ethereum Mainnet. Additionally, it suggests a way to make the Gas Refund Programme compatible with this new staking framework by changing it to distribute sePSP1 in Optimism as in Ethereum.\n\n## Goals & review\n\nPSP staking has always been exclusive to Ethereum Mainnet. Initially, this limitation came from the nature of ParaSwapPools not being cross-chain, but afterward the main limitation was concerning liquidity, as part of the PSP 2.0 design was to make it as cross-chain compatible as possible.\n\nBecause of these limitations, many potential users have been unable to participate in the Social Escrow system, as their stake and potential rewards for their activities were not proportionally beneficial to the gas fees incurred. This proposal aims to address both of these identified problems by introducing a new multichain staking framework, and additionally, it proposes Optimism as the second chain where Social Escrow staking should be available.\n\nAdditionally, in preparation for this multichain staking ecosystem, this proposal also sets out to amend the current Gas Refund Programme to consolidate it along with sePSP staking. Currently, Ethereum mainnet receives sePSP1 while the rest of the chains where the GRP is available receive PSP as refund. Additionally, some chains currently do not have sufficient liquidity to be able to easily trade and bridge PSP. Both of these problems can easily be solved if multichain staking becomes available, as now all rewards could be claimed from either one of the new staking chains, giving users also a low-fee chain to claim them in. \n\nThanks to the recent developments of liquidity in Optimism, there is sufficient liquidity to allow staking to expand to a lower-fee Layer 2 rollup.\n\n## Means\n\n**Multichain Staking Framework**\n\nDuring the research stage for designing this framework, different solutions were identified for how multichain staking could be handled. For example, each chain and fees could be isolated for a simpler experience, or a single claim chain could be voted on by the DAO. To decide the best framework to build on, the following criteria were taken into consideration to ensure the best staking user experience:\n\n* Stakers have to be able to choose which chains to interact with.\n* For users who are still only staking on a single chain, there cannot be any differences compared to the prior experience.\n* The system should allow participation on multiple chains.\n\nFollowing the aforementioned criteria, the best solution proposed was to move forth with a Proportional Staking Distribution system. In it, users can stake as per usual in different chains, with the difference happening at the point of distribution.\n\nTo decide how to split the rewards across different chains, the ParaBoost Score is calculated based on the added stake scores from all chains. Afterwards, rewards are split proportionally on each chain relative to the stake score of the user on each chain. For example, if 33% of someone’s stake score is on Optimism and 67% on Ethereum mainnet, the rewards will be bridged and distributed following that ratio.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeibdgzgof37yr2a2edctt2h47c6fhm2dhwoabq3psn4twjrjdqzdpq)\n    \n\n**Selection of Optimism**\n\nWith over $1.1M USD in TVL as of the time of writing, Optimism is currently the best candidate for the next chain to implement staking on simply because of the liquidity available to allow for user onboarding onto Social Escrow. This is also a possibility that has previously been voted in the Optimism Deployment proposal, also marking previous approval for this move.\n\nDue to the 80/20 flexibility of the pool, as well as development compatibility with what has been done in Ethereum mainnet, we propose a BeethovenX pool to be the best form of deployment for sePSP2 on optimism.\n\n**Pooling Boost clarification**\n\nAs multiple sePSP2 pools are going to be available, the current pooling boost is going to become either incompatible or Ethereum mainnet exclusive. We would like stakers in Optimism to also be able to receive a Pooling Boost from participation, and thus an amendment to the current boost is required .\n\nTo remove this limitation, we propose moving from the current minimum being Balancer pool BPT denominated, and instead for it to be calculated based on the total amount of PSP pooled in all sePSP2 pools. As of the time of writing , 10 000 sePSP2 ( the pooling boost minimum), equates to approximately 60 000 PSP, and as such we propose this to be the new minimum value to be eligible for a pooling boost.\n\n**Deployment of Optimism Upgrade Module**\n\nFinally,to ensure that there is some liquidity for people to be able to upgrade their stake on Optimism, this proposal suggests the introduction of an sePSP1 upgrade module, similar to that in Mainnet. Due to staking being new on this chain (no migrations present) and lower gas costs, we expect the demand in this chain to be lower, so believe a good initial amount of liquidity for the safety module should be around 500 000 PSP.\n\n**Gas Refund Consolidation**\n\nTo ensure the scalability of the system and avoid further confusion on the user experience, this proposal also wishes to amend the way the GRP is currently working. \n\nRather than running the Gas Refund Programme only on chains PSP is (and claims being done on each chain individually), the new amended version will send all available refunds proportionally to sePSP1 enabled chains, in a way similar to that of how staking rewards are being proposed to be split.\n\nIf implemented this way, the new version of the GRP also removes the existing limitation of Gas Refunds being doable only on chains PSP is deployed in.  Because of this, in addition to the gas from existing chains being claimable from Ethereum and Optimism, we propose for all technically viable chains to be included in the GRP following a vote for it.\n\n\n## Implementation Overview\n\nThe following steps will have to be implemented for this proposal to be needed for this to come to fruition:\n\n* Creation of an 80/20 PSP/ETH pool on BeethovenX in Optimism\n* Amendment of Gas Refund Programme to only refund on staking chains in the form of sePSP1 the total eligible refunds\n* Deployment of sePSP1 and sePSP2 tokens on Optimism\n* Amendment of the Pooling Boost minimum from 10 000 BPT of sePSP2 to 60 000 PSP staked across all chains\n* Creation of an sePSP1 upgrade module with 500k PSP\n\nAs the proposal requires two major implementations, we suggest the following steps for deployment of these initiatives:\n\n1.  Deployment of staking pools and staking on Optimism \n1.5 Amendment of Optimism gas refund rewards from PSP to sePSP\n2. Re-direction of existing gas refunds for all eligible chains to Optimism and Ethereum, and alignment of GRP distribution relative to sePSP reward distribution\n3. Addition of viable, but currently not present chains onto the GRP system with future governance votes\n\n----\n\n## Voting Options\n\n* For\n\n* Against\n\n* Abstain",

These will have an official scope for the DAO and therefore need the approval of the whole DAO for their implementation.\n\nGoal & review\nAfter more than 2 periods of reflexion and work, we realised that we had very few means of communicating with the DAO. More generally, the DAO has no way of conveying relevant information.\n\nFor example, many DAO members carry out research and/or create threads on Paraswap, but no official DAO Paraswap body exists to relay these goldmines of research and information.\n\nThe Troopers, for their part, have no direct channels for addressing the DAO. In fact, we’re keen to share fun and attractive content every month, in particular to provide summaries of the progress of the protocol, income and any work we’re working on.\n\nWe would also like to make any announcements/snapshots/proposals from the DAO more legible. By using media such as twitter, any member could be warned if a topic is being discussed on the forum or a vote is active.\n\nWe would therefore like to create several media\n\nTwitter ParaswapDAO\nObjectives :\nRelay ongoing snapshots\nRelay researchers and/or proposals\nRelay DAO figures and data on a regular basis\n\nMirror.xyz\nObjective :\nTo create a weekly article or when we have enough content to do so\nTo provide the DAO with a clear and pleasant follow-up of the organisation’s evolution\nWe will aim to provide quality content as regularly as possible\n\nMeans\nIn order to set up these media as efficiently and securely as possible, we will need to meet a number of requirements\n\nWe are going to create a multi-signature wallet. This wallet will be signed by Troopers. Being a Trooper will be a necessary element to be part of the multi-sig. The immediate effect of a Trooper’s resignation or ousting would be the revocation of his presence in the multi-signature wallet. In the same way, the recruitment of a Trooper would immediately make him or her a signatory. (, @Xutyr, @Albist, @dseeker, @stikers, @Bach)\n\nWe must also obtain an NFT LENS profile. Without this, we cannot create a LENS profile to link Twitter to it.\n\nWe need DAO approval to name the various Twitter/mirror/LENS media ParaswapDAO, and understand that these will be held by the Troopers in place.\n\nThe aim is to be operational by the end of epoch 7",

      "title": "PIP-34: Proposal ParaSwap Fee Collector v2.1",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nA few days ago, we posted an ambitious proposal to fully automate ParaSwap, but proceeded without proper deliberation and discussion with the community. We recognize that this approach left many questions and doubts unresolved. As a result, we decided to pause this proposal and proceed at a measured pace, ensuring that every step and rationale behind the proposal are transparent and clear to the entire ParaSwap DAO community. Our aim is to establish a more robust long-term relationship between Mimic and Paraswap. In collaboration with the ParaSwap Core Team, we've elected to begin with a less ambitious proposal aimed at addressing the most urgently needed automation tasks, leaving the remaining aspects for a next stage. This way, it will be easier to clarify doubts and answer questions as we progress. We are pleased to present this initial proposal to you now.\n\nMimic is a robust tool to automate DeFi operations, offering non-custodial solutions such as fee collection. Our initial proposal with ParaSwap involved the collection and conversion of fees into the wrapped native token of each of the seven networks with which ParaSwap interacts. These wrapped native tokens would then be bridged to mainnet, and periodically withdrawn to an external address owned by the DAO.\n\nWhile most of the proposal was implemented, the bridging process was not, as it was the final element for us to complete. The bridging was not included in the initial steps because our audited solution at that time did not cover all of the Paraswap chains, and was exclusively designed for the Hop protocol (which is limited to bridging only five chains). However, we are now ready to scale a multi-chain solution with Hop, Connext, and Axelar.\n\n> As of today, Mimic has conducted a total of over 700 transactions over 7 networks for Paraswap epochs, **estimated to be 2200 minutes of nonstop manual work with transactions.** Preventing errors and mitigating risks when interacting with DApps and contracts.\n> \n\nThe diagram below offers a simplified representation of the current state of the ecosystem.\n\n \n![ps1.jpg](ipfs://bafkreib57dfzlxpmyg27suzwygvnbc2rceremxrebtnle5doo4egczojyq)\n    \n\nTo facilitate better and closer discussions with the DAO, we will be initiating a new communication channel.\n\n## Goals & Review\n\nThe main goals of the proposal are:\n\n1. Fully automate ParaSwap to reduce manual intervention and risks associated with it. This involves the automation of the most urgently needed tasks, including collection and conversion of fees into the wrapped native token for each of the seven networks with which ParaSwap interacts.\n2. Modify the existing system to improve efficiency and simplify distribution, including switching the swapping process to WETH instead of the wrapped native token, and automating the collection and conversion of fees from external partners.\n3. Improve the bridging process by automating it across all seven networks.\n\nThe metrics for evaluating the success of this proposal would include:\n\nSuccessful implementation of all proposed changes required to remove the manual task in Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche and Fantom. The following chart represents the final version when this proposal is implemented:\n\n![ps2.jpg](ipfs://bafkreiad2tfearmy66gfkmxcjgscwqnti5ynotx6zqv4ygv6odfpencn5i)\n    \nNo more manual tasks on chains other than Ethereum, we can achieve improved efficiency, reduced costs, and minimized risks\n\n## Means\n\nThe primary objective of this proposal is to automate the most urgently needed tasks. These tasks are deemed critical and pose a high risk when performed manually, thus the need for automating them becomes significantly crucial. This proposal will need some development and modifications in the existing solution, particularly in the collection and swap actions. We need to redeploy some existing contracts (such as tasks) and deploy new ones in every chain used by ParaSwap. \n\nWe plan to maintain the initially proposed fee (2%) and cap (5k). We decided not to change the pricing by increasing the cap without thoughtful consideration and discussions with the community. Same as before, we will not charge any setup, deployment or development fee. Our only request is to end the test period and activate the proposed fee and cap.\n\n## **Implementation Overview**\n\n**1. Swap to wETH task:** Currently, all collected assets are swapped into the wrapped native token on each network. However, the ParaSwap Core team identified that for a simplified distribution, swapping to WETH instead of the wrapped native token would be more advantageous. This operation is being conducted manually at the moment. To implement this modification, we need to update the collect and swap action to convert assets to wETH across all chains in the existing environment.\n\n**2. Claim partner fee task:** This feature is designed to automate the collection and conversion of fees earned by ParaSwap from external partners. As of now, this task is also manually undertaken by the core team on Ethereum, Polygon, and BNB. However, since the claiming address is occasionally unchangeable within the partner's smart contracts, the environment must utilize existing contracts that hold the authority to claim these fees. To implement this change, we need to revise the current collect and swap action to claim partner fees using these authorized contracts.\n\n**3.  Complete bridge to Ethereum task:** Now that we have a thorough understanding of the bridging process, there is a final decision from the core team on which token to bridge, and Mimic has the ability to automate bridging across all seven networks, we will proceed to complete and deploy this task. In addition, we will introduce improvements to how these critical, time-sensitive tasks are executed. It is imperative that they are completed before the period ends and the final withdrawal on the Ethereum is carried out.\n\n**Timeline**: Complete automation of all aspects outlined in the proposal and achieving the objectives stated in the second graph is estimated to take 3 weeks. \n\n### Other Considerations\n\n**Security:** During our previous dialogues, security emerged as a primary concern. In response to this, our Smart Vault component has been subjected to three thorough audits, and we remain committed to upholding these high-security standards. Our ongoing collaboration with Certora ensures that every new commit is consistently audited. Additionally, the solution we implemented for ParaSwap is entirely transactional. We do not retain any assets; they are perpetually in motion, being withdrawn each epoch before the cycle starts again. Importantly, it must be highlighted that the ParaSwap DAO always retains full custody of the assets. This added layer of protection and transparency reassures stakeholders and ensures their peace of mind.\n\n**Next Steps:** As mentioned earlier, we have set an ambitious roadmap to achieve total automation in the forthcoming epochs. However, we've elected to split this roadmap into several stages, starting with the automation of current manual tasks that are critical. Some pending features requested by the Core team are: support for multiple versions of Augustus, multiple Fee Claimers, automation of the ParaBoost component, and the implementation of a flexible 80/20 withdrawal system. They still require further technical discussion within the core team and the community, and we want to dedicate the necessary time to ensure we are all aligned on these issues. This approach guarantees that our efforts remain structured and effective as we continue to complete and expand the fully automated fee redistribution for ParaSwap.\n\n## **Contact**\n\nWebsite — [mimic.fi](https://www.mimic.fi/)\nTwitter — [twitter.com/mimicfi](https://twitter.com/mimicfi)\nDiscord — [discord.mimic.fi](https://discord.mimic.fi/)",

      "content": "1. Keywords\nPSP 2.0, Fee Sharing, staking, DAO\n\n2. Context\nFirst introduced 2 years ago, the ParaSwap Fee System defines the relationship between partners and the protocol for monetization. To summarise, these are the different ways fees occur right now:\n\nPartner Fee Sharing: When a partner sets a fee, ParaSwap Protocol receives 15% of it.\nPerformance Fee Sharing: When a transaction surplus is created, 50% is returned to the Protocol.\nPartner Surplus Monetisation: If a partner sets a fee below 0.5%, the Protocol automatically captures half of the surplus on top of the fee split.\nThanks to these rules, the protocol has collected more than $37M in Fees and $7.5M in revenue 4 out of over $47B total volume 1 generated. Despise these impressive metrics, the current system has begun showing some limitations which are affecting the protocol and DAO at large:\n\nGas Inefficiency: The complex logic makes the contract more gas-intensive, as all these checks have to be done on-chain.\nReduced volume: As a consequence of the first point, the final amount received is less than what’s possible. Removing these checks would mean cheaper transactions for users.\nReduced DAO treasury: Due to the reduced volume and current fee logic, the final amount of revenue that the DAO can receive is not as high, slowing down potential growth.\n3. Goals\nThe goals of this proposal are to reduce the problems outlined above by upgrading the current smart contracts to a more gas-efficient system and revising the current fee conditions.\n\n4. Means\nTo accomplish a more efficient and effective fee system, this proposal proposes the following changes to the current fees:\n\nPartner Surplus Monetisation: Remove the 0.5% minimum fee rule to simplify the on-chain checks.\nPerformance Fee Sharing: Change the default surplus to 100% instead of 50% unless specified otherwise (such as protocols that opt for surplus monetization instead of partner fee) - this will once again reduce on-chain check complexity while also lead to a higher default treasury revenue. Partners will have to choose between capturing 50% surplus or Partner Fees, but not both at the same time.\nThese changes can be funded by the ParaSwap Foundation, which shall front the costs of these developments & audits with no additional charge to the DAO.\n\n5. Metrics\nWith these proposed improvements, the Protocol should expect the following:\n\nIncreased Volumes: The overall impact will be hard to predict, but a net positive impact should be expected.\nIncreased DAO capture: Thanks to the new Performance Fee Sharing\nTo summarise, we should see a significant increase in volumes & revenue to call this proposal a success. As a success metric, we can set this target: 100% median volume increase based on the first 4 months of 2023.\n\n6. Implementation overview\nThe proposal will be composed of the following steps:\n\nBuilding of the new Smart Contracts for the optimized fee system.\nAuditing of the contracts and re-implementation of them.\nFinally, to ensure this contract is more future-proof to any proposed changes in the split, if it is found not to impact gas efficiency too much a dynamic fee system can be implemented to the contract.",

      "content": "**Keywords**\n\nSecurity\n\n**Simple Summary**\n\nTo allocate the existing DAO treasury funds (80.6 ETH) and $ARB treasury reserves (6.36 wETH) to compensate stakers affected by the Epoch 3 distribution error totaling 86.96 ETH\n\n**Context**\n\nDue to an involuntary human mistake in the epoch distribution process, 86.96 wETH were sent from the Ethereum GovCo Multisig to the wETH contract, resulting in a loss. These funds cannot be recovered unfortunately, and an alternative course of action must be chosen to compensate stakers and let them get access to the epoch 3 rewards.\n\n**Goals**\n\nCompensate stakers affected by this distribution error as quickly as possible.\n\n**Means**\n\nTo ensure the rewards are distributed as soon as possible, we propose the following:\n\n- Use the existing ~80.6 wETH in the DAO treasury to fund the distribution.\n- The remaining amount (~6.36 wETH) to be covered using the $ARB the DAO treasury\n- Return the 80.6 wETH to the DAO treasury by converting part of the $ARB airdrop that was allocated to the ParaSwap DAO.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nThe proposal will be successful once all stakers of epoch 3 receive their corresponding wETH amount relative to their ParaBoost score during the epoch. Additionally, the proposal will be considered complete once the DAO treasury recovers its 80.6 wETH .\n\n**Considerations**\n\nTo avoid this error from happening in the future, more automation, such as the ones proposed by Mimic could be put in place to minimize human error. Additionally, the implementation of public DAO-facing checks, such as onchain automatic voting will ensure more voters can verify the validity of the distribution.\n\nStarting from Epoch 4 distribution, those steps should be respected:\n- Publicly sharing the list of rewards (address, ETH rewards) in order to allow DAO members to verify the correctness of the Merkle Root (the compressed param for rewards distribution)\n- Reducing the MultiSig role by automating the distribution through a new smart contract, where its sole purpose will be transferring WETH from the MultiSig to the Distributor and updating of the Merkle Root.\n- Providing a public link to a full simulation of the distribution using Tenderly.\n- Fully automating rewards “bridge & transfer” of WETH to the Distributor contract.\n- Adding more automation to data correctness verifications.\n\nOther potential long term solutions:\n- Using a third party to run the data generation scripts (Gelato & Co)\n- Putting the final Merkle Root data on an express vote of 24h pre-distribution\n- Having an independent watchdog, where their job is to double check the technical correctness of all MultiSig proposals.\n\n**Implementation overview**\n\n- Bridge all DAO treasury wETH to Ethereum mainnet\n- Distribute the wETH to Epoch 3 stakers\n- Return wETH to the DAO treasury during the next 3 epochs\n\n**Voting options**\n\n- For\n- Against\n- Abstain\n\n",

The purpose of this limit was to :\n\n* To maximise the interest of stakers in their investment, by requiring them to be present on the protocol at least every 3 epochs in order to claim their income.\n* Pre-empt the $ETH revenues that arrive on DEAD wallets so that the DAO can put them to good use.\n\nThe first epoch showed that the mandatory quarterly claim had the effect of greatly diluting the ROI of the smallest investors. \nIndeed, with modest bags, the obligation of a quarterly profit withdrawal drastically reduces the returns of our investors. \nThe DAO is not intended to suck returns but simply to ensure that the ETH generated by the protocol are not lost forever on DEAD wallets. \n\nWe therefore propose to extend the claim period to 6 or 12 epochs so that everyone can, if they wish, wait until they have enough in their \"yield account\" to claim. \nAfter this period, the DAO will exercise its right of first refusal on the rewards as initially stipulated in the 2.0 proposal\n\n**Forward-thinking consideration**\n\nIf this proposal is accepted, it will allow all forms of portfolios to come and take advantage of the social escrow and its returns without difficulty.\nIt will therefore be a gain of users, volumes and visibility for Paraswap\n\n**Implementation overview**\n\nIf this proposal is accepted, it will be implemented immediately.\n\nVoting options\n\n*  Extension to 6 epochs\n*  Extension to 12 epochs\n*  Don't touch my 3 epochs duration\n* Abstain",

      "content": "Project Name\nDiscord - Burns#2854\n\nGrant Proposal\nProposal is to appoint Burns to a compensated position for the initial setup and guidance of the ParaTrooper Contributor structure and ParaSwap’s OP funded Grants Program.\n\nPSP-IPΔ25 approved the ParaTrooper Contributor structure. This structure requires substantial setup and coordination in order to create a sustainable system. This proposal elects Burns to assist the DAO by setting up initial infrastructure and guide the initial phase. This proposal covers an initial 3 month duration which includes:\n\n1. Champion the ParaTrooper contributor structure\n- Setup: defining communication processes, initial onboarding, and setup tooling. Identify and establish other processes as necessary.\n- Recurring: chair weekly ParaTrooper calls, assist inter-DAO coordination, manage Coordinape circle, conduct monthly contributor temp checks, complete on/offboarding.\n2. Setup and manage the DAO budget\n- Define ongoing DAO costs and monitor burn rate. Specifically, create budget proposals posted for community vote that ensure the DAO will have a sustainable treasury to operate and grow for 48 months (product market fit generally needs to occur in 2 yrs to avoid burnout but we’ve seen standard crypto cycle being 4 yrs so it is prudent to ensure sufficient runway for this eventuality).\n3. Steward the ParaSwap OP Funded Grants Program\n- As part of the approved PSP-IPΔ25 - Deployment of PSP to Optimism 2, a grant selection process was introduced to distribute PSP and OP to further integrations with ParaSwap and Optimism. This is funded through an approved grant from Optimism for 450,000 OP with 50% dedicated to new dApp and app developers that integrate ParaSwap into their swaps and interact directly with the Optimism ecosystem. Engagement for grant applications has been low, stewardship of this grant program would include researching and proposing solutions to improve applicant numbers and suitability for funding.\n\nDeliverables:\n- Develop initial DAO Documentation (Code of Conduct , contributor nomination framework, onboarding/offboarding)\n- Setup DAO notion page and coordinate with ParaTroopers to maintain (will require subscription funding from a ParaSwap entity)\nSetup Coordinape circle on behalf of ParaSwap DAO\n- Develop and maintain DAO budget in collaboration with the community and associated proposals\n- Grants program development\n- Monthly report on deliverables progress\n\nGrant Category\nSocial Escrow Research. Uses that are directly related to improving the experience in Optimism of either the ParaSwap protocol or the DAO.\n\nA dedicated, contributor-run DAO can champion the introduction of sePSP2, iterating through the trial period in order to create the best possible implementation of Social Escrow. The ParaTroopers are key to improving the ParaSwap protocol and by extension, the Optimism Ecosystem.\n\nOptimism Alignment\nParaSwap is incentivizing growth within the Optimism ecosystem by encouraging integrations and developments within this L2 using grants. The development of a grants program to focus on funding suitable projects is a major component of this proposal with the intended outcome of moving DAO activities towards Optimism.\n\nParaSwap Alignment\nExpanding ParaSwap DAO is critical to champion the success and adoption of sePSP2.0. The approved pathway for this is the addition of GovCo and the ParaTroopers which requires the setup of processes/docs and some initial guidance.\n\nAmount of OP + PSP requested\nRequested funding is: 4,500 USD in OP + 500 USD in PSP per month for 3 months for a total of 13,500 USD in OP + 1,500 USD in PSP with all PSP to be locked in to sePSP2 each month paired with my own ETH, minimizing sell pressure.\n\nAs seen from these duties, this appointment is a major commitment of time which I estimate at 26-28 hrs per week. The requested funds have been kept moderate to respect the early stage of the ParaSwap DAO.\n\nThis is to be paid out by the ParaSwap multisig upon receipt of a monthly progress report within 7 days of the end of each month (or 30 day period depending when snapshot vote is passed).\n\nWallet Address for payment and to lock sePSP2:\n0x1D528Dfb8Dbb1496EDA0492dc77dC4dDBd91583D\n\nSuccess Metrics\n- Onboard 5+ ParaTroopers\n- Each ParaTrooper is adding 3+ quality adds to the project (eg. Governance proposal, marketing material, -technical support etc). ParaTroopers will review and confirm all developed materials through Coordinape circle contributions.\n- At least 1 ParaTrooper is providing critical feedback to every Governance Forum post\n- Coordinape Circle is funded and maintained\n- DAO runway is established and approved\n- 5+ Grant proposals posted per month\n- Monthly reports submitted promptly detailing important deliverables progress\n\nOther Ecosystem Roles / Background\nBalancer Grants Co-lead and Baller in Balancer DAO. ParaSwap is an integrator of Balancer.\n10yrs experience as a project manager\nDegree qualified mechanical engineer\n\nVoting Options\n1. For the appointment of Burns as per this Proposal\n2.

If anything, this outdated information could lead to potential readers being mislead with factually erroneous asssesments.\nMarket share planned is not present.\n\nThis proposal aims to revoke the grant in an anticipated way and to pay a one-time allowance of $300 in $PSP.\nThis one time allowance will be conditioned to the positive return of the grantee. The latter having left the discord without warning. This return will have to be done before March 31, 2023.\n\n**Means**\nThe proposal, if passed, will require the payment by the DAO of $300 in PSP to the Asymmetric Defi wallet (after they validate the will of this payment before March 31, 2023): 0x3c8fc549798C48Cd4EdC1786bef85D3a50f15C10, which was posted by @adalhi on the 2 January 2023 in the proposal.\n\nThe proposal will mark the end of the grant and Asymmetric Defi will be informed of the vote through one of the communication channels previously used (governance forum, discord).\n\nThe vote will confirm their previously stated commitment to end the partnership.\n\n**Forward-thinking considerations**\nAs expressed by @Mouph, this proposal is the consequence of a grant being awarded without having previously defined the expected success criteria and the expectations of the DAO.\n\nFurther discussion by the DAO should be initiated to create a framework for future grant awards to guide applicants, and ensure more effective selection and quality control.\n\n**Implementation overview**\nEven if both parties are at the origin of the end of this partnership, it is necessary to implement the payment (under conditions) and the end of the collaboration before the production of any further reports.\n\n**Voting options**\nFor : end partnership and validate a conditional payment option.\nAgainst : do nothing.\nAbstain",

      "content": "# PSP-IPΔ28 : sePSP1 Upgrade Module\n\n## Keywords\n\nLiquidity, sePSP1, sePSP2\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nTo create an upgrade module from sePSP1 to sePSP2 that does not have the usual 28 day unstake period for the user. To do this, the proposal will request to the DAO a maximum of 10 000 000 PSP per epoch to act as ‘buffer’ for this module.\n\n## Context and Goals\n\nCurrently, for a staker to be able to upgrade from sePSP1 to sePSP2 there is a 28 day period in between where they are not part of the staking system with this sePSP. This can be a very detrimental experience for an upgrade which is beneficial for the DAO, as sePSP2 boosts the liquidity of PSP as well as boosting the stake of users.\n\nTo encourage a better conversion experience for sePSP1 stakers upgrading to sePSP2 , this proposal suggests the introduction of an upgrade module, in which users can deposit additional ETH in combination with sePSP1 to instantly upgrade to sePSP2.\n\n## Means\n\nIn addition to the requirement of a new Upgrade Smart Contract - which would accept sePSP1 + ETH in return for sePSP2 - this proposal is requesting for a ‘buffer’ PSP allocation from the DAO. This buffer would allow the user to instantly upgrade without having to go through the unlock period, and in the meantime, the contract can begin the unstaking + withdrawal process for sePSP1.\n\nTo properly budget this conversion buffer, this proposal will request for a maximum of 10M PSP to be used every epoch as buffer, or about ~ 20% of the total sePSP2 stake. Depending on the amount of sePSP1 being upgraded, this amount can be revised in the future either through a PSP-IP, or with a PSP-EP (as no real funds are being spent overall).\n\n## Metrics\n\nProportion of stakers in sePSP1 vs sePSP2\n\n## Forward Thinking Considerations\n\nAssuming that the contract is implemented as described here, the only major consideration to be considered is whether this buffer rate has to be adjusted sometime in the future.\n\n## Implementation Overview\n\n1. Approval of the Buffer PSP for the contract\n2. Creation and audit of the upgrade contract\n\n## Voting Options\n\n1. For\n2. Against\n3. Abstain\n\n======",

      "content": "**Keywords**\n\nGas Refund Program, PSP incentives, PSP-EP\n\n**Simple Summary**\n\nTo adjust the current reward mechanisms and parameters of the Gas Refund Program to ensure its long-term sustainability\n\n**Context**\n\nThe Gas Refund Program is an initiative spearheaded by the DAO to alleviate the cost of gas for stakers using ParaSwap. As these refunds are done in PSP, three main limits were set during the initial proposal and budget allocation, as well as the later adjustment and renewals in the PSP 2.0 proposal:\n\n- A per-address limit of USD 2500 per epoch\n- A per-address yearly maximum of USD 30k\n- A global budget limit of 30M PSP\n\nUntil now, these limits have been enough to maintain the program sustainable. However, a new surge of activity driven by a small number of wallets shortly after PSP 2.0 has put pressure on the current budget in a way that threatens the exhaustion of the budget well before the end of the year.\n\nWhile most of this volume comes from a healthy level of protocol growth (such as the doubling of eligible stakers that are part of the GRP), one worrying figure concerns the top eligible claimants of the GRP compared to previous epochs.\n\nIn summary, for the first PSP 2.0 epoch, the Gas Refund Program distributed 3.07M PSP, more than 10% of the total global budget.\nLess than 7% of all refunded wallets got 83% of the total PSP refunded, despite only generating 8.8% of the epoch’s volume.\n\nWere this behavior to continue during the second epoch, over 20% of the total global Gas Refund budget could be drained, with +80% of it going to these small number of wallets.\n \n![ep.png](ipfs://bafkreice24oywtnay6toyq433gf3c332yxylitjl2pnr4u2nsgm7ajrpk4)\n    \nTo ensure the sustainability of the Gas Refund Program, this proposal aims to amend the current limits to a new level that will keep the budget sustainable while not affecting the vast majority of users.\n\nOne way to ensure the sustainability of the program is to reduce the viability of the program for users who do not have a long-term outlook for PSP. To do this and to further promote the engagement of gas refunded addresses with PSP 2.0 and the social escrow system, a potential solution is the distribution of sePSP1 instead of PSP. This saves the staking gas costs for users with a long-term outlook for PSP and also makes the claimable sePSP1 be considered as part of the user ParaBoostScore without the need to claim.\n\nIn addition, and to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Gas Refund Program, this proposal aims to amend the current limits to a new level that will keep the budget sustainable while not affecting the vast majority of users.\n\n**Goals, Means, and Implementation**\n\nDue to the time-sensitive nature of these measures, the proposal proposes the following changes to be implemented to the gas refund program before the end of Epoch 2 and applicable to it:\n\n- Reduce the maximum per-wallet limit to $500 per epoch\n- Replace the distribution token from PSP to sePSP1 only on Ethereum\n\n**Metrics**\n\nThe success of this proposal can be measured by whether Epoch 2’s PSP Emissions adhere to the expected budget projections for the year or not and have a fair distribution of the total amount of PSP distributed in the epoch.\n\n**Forward-thinking considerations**\n\nWhile this new per-epoch limit might be sufficient to mitigate the current emissions, it could be adjusted again if the average network gas emissions rise throughout the network.\n\nAdditionally, in the future, the DAO could consider additional measures to limit the opportunistic nature of Gas Refunds.\n\nVoting options\n- For\n- Against\n- Abstain",

Given the rising importance of ecosystems such as BSC, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon ,etc. (all are in the [top 10 for daily and weekly volumes](https://defillama.com/dexs/chains) as ranked by DefiLlama) it would be expeditious for the Paraswap DAO to capture more of these flows by whitelisting the most important projects/tokens/partners with presence on multiple chains.\n\nThe PSP 2.0 framework envisions situations such as this where tokens could be added mid-epoch with the use of an Express Proposal; the authors thus believe this is also useful to test the framework in its earliest iteration for the DAO and PSP stakers' collective benefit.\n\nThe vote will stand as an agreement for adding these tokens on the above stated chains with the referred addresses.

      "title": "PSP-IPΔ25 - Establishment of a Governance Committee and Decentralisation Governance Roadmap",
      "content": "### Co-authored by: Burns, 0xYtocin\n\n## Keywords\n\nGovernance, PSP 2.0, Accountability, Rewards, Staking\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal clarifies the roles, responsibilities, and membership of the Governance Committee contributors. This governance committee will be in charge of ensuring that the PSP rewards distribution is working as intended, and will meet regularly to monitor this.\n\n## Context\n\nFirst [introduced in the PSP 2.0 proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/paraswap-dao.eth/proposal/0xdaac1961439e9daf6a8327877667f837d7c07c4b143c41b25833725f63fa672e), the role of the Governance Committee (or GovCo) is to ensure that the systems being introduced remain fair and unbiased, as well as execute Emergency Measures in case a key vulnerability is found (which are exemplified later in the proposal).\n\nThis proposal seeks to expand this into a more detailed framework, exploring the structure of GovCo, the responsibilities of members, as well as a list of potential members to be nominated for the first iteration of the committee. Additionally, the proposal introduces a framework for further decentralizing the structure of the DAO in the future, such as the trial of the ‘ParaTroopers’ contributor system.\n\nWith the passing of this proposal, the ParaSwap DAO will be equipped with contributors able to monitor the successful implementation of PSP 2.0, which will be needed to accomplish the required goals set in the initial trial period outlined in the proposal. Additionally, this proposal will permit for the experimentation of a contributor-based distribution system.\n\n## Goals\n\nThe main goals of the proposed Governance Committee are as follows:\n\n* Ensure that the Social Escrow system and PSP 2.0 reforms are working as intended\n* When applicable, monitor and report potential vulnerabilities or unintended uses of the Social Escrow PSP system, and trigger Emergency Measures if necessary.\n* Report suggestions, improvements, and ideas to the DAO about the Social Escrow staking and reward systems associated with it (meaning revenue redistribution + gas refund rewards).\n* Implement bi-epoch checkpoints where the Governance Committee will discuss PSP 2.0 implementation updates, correct rewards distribution, and potential improvements.\n  * During the end-of-epoch checkpoint, ensure that the rewards are effectively distributed as established in past meetings by the Committee.\n\nMeanwhile, the main goal of the ParaTroopers pilot programme will be to experiment on a framework for a DAO contributor structure. In addition to experimenting with the format of Coordinape, this section of the proposal will also serve to clarify the objectives and vetting process of the first members of the system.\n\n## Means I - Structure and Responsibilities of the Governance Committee\n\n### Meeting Sessions\n\nCommittee members will be expected to meet regularly every half epoch to discuss progress and findings with other members of the Governance Committee. In addition to these compulsory meetings, depending on the urgency of the matters discussed in the last meeting, the Committee can agree to hold an additional session during the off weeks.\n\nDuties of the meetings:\n* Review data analytics of current performances of the sePSP system: Staking rates, staker boost performance, gas refund, reward distribution, etc.\n* Suggest changes to the current system if necessary.\n* Evaluate whether any actors might be acting maliciously (eg exploiting the ParaBoost system for personal gain)\n* Ensure the distribution of rewards after an Epoch End.\n\n### Emergency and Safeguarding\n\nFrom the PSP 2.0 proposal, GovCo can decide to implement two kinds of emergency motions, depending on the severity of the issue reported:\n\n* **Tier 1**\n  * **Type:** Emergency\n  * **Scope:** User funds are at risk\n  * **Actions:** Immediate intervention by pausing the system, then a community discussion + vote for further actions. Only GovCo can pause the contracts and should release a postmortem.\n* **Tier 2**\n  * **Type:** Emergency\n  * **Scope:** Risk on Revenue takeover (egg: Attack on the rev share by exploiting a loophole on the ParaBoost)\n  * **Actions:** 24h vote time. If the attack happens 24h before the fee distribution time, the reaction should be immediate and follows the same process as Tier-1. The action should be limited to pausing fee distributions.\n\nIn addition to these two emergency powers, the Governance Committee is encouraged to express other non-emergency concerns they might have about the way the system is running during one of the regular sessions.\n\nFinally, in case any of these vulnerabilities were reported by an outside party, the Governance Committee is entitled to manage the PSP bounty present in the [ Hats.Finance vault ](https://snapshot.org/#/paraswap-dao.eth/proposal/0x872a6f7713901a711b263d36618c55ed97ee84268d8424966dac12436bddb39a)if deemed necessary. Vulnerabilities reported from within the committee will be entitled to the bonus Participation reward.\n\n### Participation Rewards\n\nWe expect committee members to devote a significant amount of time to the Governance Committee, which we understand is a big commitment, as all current candidates are also members of other projects in DeFi.\n\nBecause of this, we recommend that assuming all accountability measures are fulfilled, each seat is entitled to up to the equivalent of 1000 USD monthly in PSP per epoch after fulfilling all expected basic duties Payment will be sent to users after three epochs of participation in the program.\n\nThe USD to PSP conversion will be done using PSP last 30 days' average price.\n\nAdditionally, GovCo members who report a vulnerability will receive up to the equivalent of 1000 USD in PSP in the epoch the vulnerability was reported.\n\nWhile we recommend for the Governance Committee to decide what constitutes a valid report, some examples of what could be considered a vulnerability include:\n\n* Actions triggering Tier 1 or Tier 2 Emergency Proposals which, if executed, endanger user funds or revenue takeover.\n* Other actions that may lead to the potential gaming of the Social Escrow System or ParaBoost.\n\nThe member will be expected to present this vulnerability to the other Governance Committee seats, attaching any relevant information and figures and potential solutions.\n\nThe USD to PSP conversion will be done using PSP last 30 days' average price.\n\nCurrent Member Candidacy:\n\nAs of the release of this proposal, the following members of the ParaSwap DAO and other DeFi protocols have expressed their interest in participating in the committee. In total, GovCo will aim to have 6 seats:\n\n* Enerow\n* Balancer\n* Avantgarde Finance\n* Paladin\n* Pascal0x from Jarvis Protocol\n* ParaSwap (technical)\n\nFinally, a core team member will hold a technical seat position, and they will be tasked in providing any technical assistance or information needed during the meetings, as well as initiating proposals.\n\n### On Rotating and Protocol Seats\n\nIf a seat is clarified as a ‘Rotating Seat’, it means that the seat is assigned to a protocol rather than an individual, and the individual itself can potentially change at the discretion of the protocol. Regardless of the number of people representing this seat, they will still be entitled to only one vote.\n\nThis process of seat rotation occurs purely on the Protocol side of things, and will only require a vote from the entirety of the Governance Committee if they wish to replace their protocol seat entirely (see the next section for more details)\n\n### Seat Replacement and Additions\n\nFor security measures, the Governance Committee will always require at least five active seats for functioning, with a currently budgeted maximum of up to 8 seats.\n\nFor the inclusion of a new GovCo seat, the candidate’s nomination will be discussed during one of the regular meetings, and afterward, a vote will be made regarding the inclusion. For the candidate to be included, a supermajority of at least two-thirds of all votes will be required.\n\nIf a seat member wishes to stop being part of the Governance Council, they must give at least one whole epoch’s notice to allow member preparations. The seat member must then also assist in finding a replacement for the seat unless other Governance Committee members agree to reduce the number of seat members.\n\n### Metrics - Accountability\n\nBaseline Metrics\n\n* Attendance threshold for each seat of at least 75% of the meetings mentioned in the ‘Meeting Sessions’ section.\n* Ensure the proper distribution of rewards during the post-epoch reward period.\n* Setting group KPIs after each meeting to resolve issues that might have been brought up during the session.\n\nVulnerability Reporting Metrics - (Bonus Compensation Only)\n\n* Provide a risk assessment and clear explanation of the issue being brought up\n* Communicate during the GovCo meeting the issue found, with any relevant accompanying data or evidence.\n\n## Means II - Introduction and planning of the ParaTroopers Contributor structure\n\n### Definition, Purpose, and Role\n\nPart of the PSP 2.0 Trial period is to include a compensation structure to reward active community members in a contributor system dubbed ParaTroopers. These DAO contributors will be champions for ParaSwap with a mission to further the decentralization of the protocol and be responsible for:\n\n* Being an interface for those looking to learn more or integrate with ParaSwap Protocol\n* Assist with governance proposals before posting to the forum\n* Provide technical support\n* Manage contributors to the DAO and its surrounding community\n\n### Structure\n\nAs a first step in a compensation model, a Coordinape circle is to be set up with contributors delegating “Give” to each other in line with their levels of contribution for the epoch.\n\nThe initial setup of the ParaTroopers contributor system is proposed to be a joint effort by Burns (Balancer Grants Co-lead) and Oxytocin (ParaSwap) to monitor and guide it through a trial period, with the intention of it becoming a self-sustaining group that continues to learn and evolve. Part of this will be defining communication processes, initial onboarding, setup tooling, and other general processes to create a sustainable system.\n\nA long-term goal is for specific DAO roles to emerge and be compensated accordingly, with the Coordinape circle serving as a “bonus” for long-term, highly engaged contributors and the possibility of immediate compensation for any new contributors.\n\n### Genesis Onboarding\n\nThere is proposed to be ~5-10 initial ParaTroopers with this number to be assessed as the trial progresses.\n\nOnboarding for the founding ParaTroopers and the associated Coordinape circle will be via self-nomination through a submission form, followed by an interview by Burns and Oxytocin, to begin with, and then other ParaTroopers. Future additions will be via a case-by-case basis, nominated by one ParaTrooper and assessed by existing members.\n\nAs this initiative is also part of the PSP2.0 trial period, the structures and processes of the system may be subject to major alteration and improvement as a result of further experimentation and iteration. At the end of the trial period, the ParaTrooper contributor system and its participants will be assessed by the community to determine whether to continue, iterate or dissolve the initiative.\n\n### Participation Rewards\n\nFor the first epoch, the ParaTrooper Coordinape circle will have a max ceiling of $350 usd paid in PSP per contributor with the multiplier discussed below to be added on top. This would have a max budget of $5250 per epoch once max multiplier is reached after 3 epochs (10 paratroopers @ 1.5x).\n\nTo encourage long-term holding and commitment to reducing token sell pressure amongst ParaTroopers, the trial will include an sePSP2 ‘streak’ compensation multiplier. This increases compensation for locking tokens for multiple epochs in a row, up to a maximum of 1.5x. However, if an unstake is made on the previous epoch, the streak will be lost and the compensation will revert to the standard rate.\n\n|Streak (# of Epoches)|Multiplier|\n| --- | --- |\n|0|1.0x|\n|1|1.125x|\n|2|1.25x|\n|3+|1.5x|\n\nExamples:\n\n1. If a contributor is awarded $350 USD by their peers through the Coordinape circle and has been staking continuously for the previous 3 full epochs, they will be compensated @ 1.5x = $525 paid in PSP .\n2. The same contributor unstaked their sePSP2 in the last epoch or has no staked sePSP2, they will have a 1.0x multiplier = $350 USD in PSP\n\nThe USD to PSP conversion will be done using PSP last 30 days' average price.\n\n### Metrics - Accountability\n\nBaseline Metrics\n\n* Growth of Discord members, weekly communicators, and new member retention\n* Qualitative increase in community communications\n* Governance forum and voterparticipation\n* Relationship between ParaTroopers and other DeFi communities\n\n## Forward Thinking Consideration - Further Decentralisation Steps of the DAO\n\nThis is the first step of decentralization, and a first-time experiment for the ParaSwap DAO. As the DAO matures, however, it is important to begin delegating more and more features to be running entirely through the DAO. In addition to the current Governance Positions, we could explore other methods of management from similar DAOs.\n\n### Implementation Overview\n\n* Election of Governance Committee members\n* Appointment of Genesis ParaTroopers\n* Setup DAO tooling and contributor compensation structure\n\n### Voting Options\n\n1. For the creation and election of GovCo members and ParaTroopers\n2. Against\n3. Abstain\n\n======",

      "title": "PSP-EPΔ01 - Gas Refund and Epoch Adjustments",
      "content": "## Keywords\n\nPSP 2.0, Gas Refund, PSP-EP\n\n## Simple Summary and Goals\n\nAs we get closer to the release of PSP 2.0, there are a few adjustments that have to be discussed before we can fully implement the new system. This express proposal seeks to address the issues relating to two aspects of the implementation: Gas Refund Program adjustment and the release epoch.\n\nTo address these issues, we propose the following:\n\n* Introduce a new formula for the new ParaBoost-reliant Gas Refund calculation. This is set to fix the continuous gas refund formula to make it more compatible with the current refund levels.\n  * The new formula is as follows: 0.152003ln(0.000517947x), where x corresponds to the ParaBoost score. The effective range of the formula will be from the minimum refund level of 25% to the maximum of 95%\n\n* Approve the early conclusion of an epoch if PSP 2.0 is ready to release during an epoch, and distribute pro-rated rewards relative to the time elapsed during the epoch if needed.\n\n## Context I - Gas Refund Level Adjustments\n\nFollowing the suggestion of [another DAO member](https://gov.paraswap.network/t/improve-gas-refund-incentives/1011), one of the decisions of PSP 2.0 has been to make the gas refund levels continuous rather than the current discrete reward level system. This way, if you were, for example, between refund levels 1 and 2, you would receive a value between those as opposed to simply level 1. To do this, we used the following formula to get close to the levels stipulated in the refund table:\n\nABS(0.126506 * LN( 0.335487* [Total PSP Stake Value]+ 1.64295 )- 0.789135)\n\n|ParaBoost Score|Approximate Refund|\n| --- | --- |\n|10 000|24% (Min Refund Value)|\n|100 000|52%|\n|500 000|73%|\n|1 000 000|82%|\n|3 000 000|95% (Max Refund Value)|\n\nFigure 1: Approximate gas refund levels for the currently voted on formula for the new Socially Escrowed PSP system\n\nWhile the current formula has close values for the first three levels (10k ParaBoost gives a 23.8% refund, 100k gives 53%, 500k gives 73.3%) the final level requires a significantly higher amount of more than 2.5 million PSP. This makes the formula unsuited for higher refund levels.\n\nInstead of staying with the current formula, we propose to introduce the following similar one:\n\n0.152003 ln(0.000517947x)\n\nWith this new formula, the refund values will be the following on the four desired levels:\n\n|ParaBoost Score|Approximate Refund|\n| --- | --- |\n|10 000|25% (Min Refund Value)|\n|100 000|60%|\n|500 000|85%|\n|1 000 000|95% (max refund value)|\n\nFigure 2: Approximate gas refund levels using the new formula\n\nFinally, to make sure the formula works as specified within the range of the previous proposal, we are setting an effective range from 25 to 95% refund levels.\n\n## Context II - Mid-Epoch release\n\nWith the release of PSP 2.0 fast approaching, we must also begin thinking about the possibility of releasing the new system during an existing epoch. While the ideal solution is to release it at the start of a new epoch if this target is not possible, there could be delays of up to two weeks as we wait for the epoch to be over before implementing PSP 2.0.\n\nTo avoid this situation from happening, we propose the possibility of ending an epoch early with a notice period of 3 days for an early termination, and distributing the smoother rewards proportionally to the amount of time elapsed during the epoch if needed.\n\nMeans and Implementation Overview\n\n* Introduce a new adjusted formula to better fit the current values\n* Shorten epoch length for PSP 2.0 release if needed\n* Distribute pro-rated rewards\n\n## Voting Options\n\n* For\n* Against\n* Abstain",

      "title": "PSP-IPΔ25 - Deployment of PSP to Optimism",
      "content": "## Keywords\n\nPSP LIquidity, Grants\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nWith PSP 2.0 now successfully designed and agreed on by the ParaSwap DAO, we now can focus on the deployment of PSP to Optimism following the Phase I grant by the Optimism Collective.\n\nThe following proposal seeks to introduce PSP to Optimism, as well as the Gas Refund Program that comes with it. Following that, this proposal will provide PSP to match the liquidity needed for the PSP-OP pool, as well as matching the OP grants with PSP as needed.\n\nFinally, with the deployment of PSP 2.0, this proposal also urges the prioritization of the Optimism network for Social Escrow PSP in the future, as thanks to the Protocol Owned Liquidity grant, it will be possible to have enough initial liquidity to bootstrap a healthy staking ecosystem.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned points, an addendum has been added to self-nominate ParaSwap as one of the Protocol Delegates for Optimism Governance.\n\n## Context\n\nAs part of the Phase 1 grants, the [Optimism Collective ](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-paraswap/2228)approved an initial grant for the ParaSwap DAO. For those that missed the proposal, it can be summarised in three categories:\n\n* 225,000 OP: Introduction of a dApp developer grant for Optimism\n* 157,500 OP: Establishment of OP-PSP, a protocol-owned liquidity pool\n* 67,500 OP: Encouragement of DexLib integrations through ParaSwap with special grants\n\nWhile this grant was being voted on in the Optimism Token House, the ParaSwap DAO was discussing some major reforms to the PSP tokenomics system in the form of PSP 2.0. Now that there are clear plans for what the reforms entail, we can align the funds given during Phase I to bootstrap the launch of Social Escrow while we go through the process of receiving the OP grants.\n\n## Goals\n\nTo be able to provide the $PSP needed for the matching, this proposal first suggests porting the PSP token to Optimism, as well as implementing the Gas Refund Program onto Optimism.\n\nAfter PSP is deployed to this Optimistic Rollup, we will provide the necessary PSP to maximise the Phase I Optimism Funds and Protocol-Owned Liquidity, as well as prepare Optimism for a successful deployment of Social Escrowed PSP on that chain in the future.\n\n## Means\n\nThere are various aspects that have to be considered about how to best use the OP grants given. Below, we explore a few aspects that have to be considered, and how this proposal seeks to address them:\n\n### Selecting a Source of liquidity\n\nOf the OP requested, approximately 157,500 OP are devoted to providing a permanent source of liquidity for a PSP-OP. This allows for a solution that is more sustainable in the long run compared to other liquidity providing methods like liquidity mining. However, what kind of liquidity pool will be the best long-term option for this OP-PSP pool?\n\nPersonally, the only requirement we should consider is to not go with a simple 50/50 asset pool. As we are dealing with two assets that are not correlated with one another, any form of decoupling on either side will result in a large amount of Impermanent Loss on the assets.\n\nDue to this, the current proposed LP will be in Beethoven X, with its Balancer-style skewed pools. Of all the possible ratios, a pool where 80% of the assets is PSP is the best option for this grant if we choose to minimize impermanent loss. By adding more OP to the pool, we would:\n\n* Minimize the risk of impermanent loss, maximizing asset efficiency\n* This pool might become a boosted asset in Beethoven X in the future, allowing for the earning of yield of these assets long-term were this to happen.\n\nAnother potential option is to deploy a Uni V3 pool, however, that would require creating a special strategy from scratch, and depending on flexibility of this strategy it might require more micromanagement. However, if anyone has an idea for this (or even other DEXes), feel free to bring it up!\n\n### Grant Selection Process\n\nThe main purpose of the grants provided are to allow growth of the Optimism ecosystem while also encouraging the use of ParaSwap to encourage dApp developers to best access all DeFi services. For that reason, it is important to determine that the grants are used correctly. Here’s a rough idea of potential categories that we could use to determine the degree of PSP matching:\n\n1. Optimism deployment for existing dApps - Encouraging onboarding to the Optimism ecosystem - Matching of PSP of up to 10 PSP/OP\n\n2. Novel applications of ParaSwap - New uses of ParaSwap (even on apps that are using ParaSwap for something else already). Matching of up to 15 PSP/OP\n\n3. Social Escrow Research - Uses that are directly related to improving the experience in Optimism of either the ParaSwap protocol or the DAO. Some examples could be an alternative frontend or a clever use of the ParaSwap API. Matching of up to 20 PSP/OP\n\n4. DexLib Grant: The grantee wishes to integrate a DEX on Optimism, and is not directed affiliated with either ParaSwap or the relevant DEX. This grantaims to incentivise developers to assist integrations of protocols they love.\n\nTo apply for a grant, the best possible solution is to have grantees apply through the governance forum, explaining the amount of OP that they wish to use and more details about the project. The following template could be used for grant applications:\n\n* Project Name\n* Relevant Protocol Metrics\n* Grant Category\n* Optimism Alignment\n* ParaSwap Alignment\n* Amount of OP + PSP requested\n* Success Metrics\n\nSince the PSP needed for these grants would already be approved with this vote, the proposed quorum for these grants can be removed, though a reduced quorum is also possible if the community believes is more appropriate.\n\n## Metrics and Forward Thinking Considerations\n\nWhile PSP liquidity is something difficult to measure, we can measure the effectiveness of the grants given by the quality and amount of projects benefiting from these grants. If any of these grants end up being underutilized, a future proposal could be made to the collective to re-allocate these funds.\n\nIn the future, if we ever consider making PSP multichain, we can consider Optimism one of our first places to deploy to if liquidity is deployed successfully\n\n## Addendum: Protocol Self-Nomination Approval\nFollowing the introduction of [Protocol Delegates](https://gov.optimism.io/t/protocol-delegation-self-nominations/4357/2) to the Optimism Governance forums, we additionally propose that the ParaSwap DAO should self-nominate as a delegate for Optimism governance.\n\nDue to the conflicting deadlines between this proposal and the applications, we propose that for now , the redactor of this proposal (Oxytocin) nominates for the position, but in a future vote we can add additional ParaSwap representatives onto our seat in the nomination table. Once again due to timing issues, this approval will have to be retroactive, but will still depend on the passing of this vote.\n\n## Implementation Overview\n\n1. Introduce the PSP token to Optimism\n2. Implement the Gas Refund Program Onto Optimism\n3. Establish the grants system\n4. Introduce the OP/PSP PoL , providing enough PSP to match an OP/PSP pool with 20/80 allocation\n5. Nominate a DAO member as a Protocol Delegate in Optimism Governance\n\n## Voting Options\n\n* For\n* Against\n* Abstain",

      "content": "# PSP-IPΔ24 : Claim and Delegate $SAFE tokens on behalf of ParaSwap DAO\n\n### Keywords\n\nGovernance, safe, partnerships, community\n\n#### Simple Summary\n\nAs part of our infrastructure, we use Safe Multi Signature wallets. Some of these wallets have received a $SAFE vested token allocation which will expire if not claimed by the 27th of December 2022.\n\nThis proposal requests to claim these tokens and decide on who to delegate the voting power to.\n\n#### Context\n\nRecently, the Safe multisignature solution has decided to decentralise into a DAO, the SafeDAO. As part of its decentralisation process, it has allocated tokens to some multi signature wallets, such as the ones owned by the ParaSwap DAO.\n\nYou can read more about the $SAFE voting power and circulation directly from the SafeDAO forums [here](https://forum.gnosis-safe.io/t/safe-voting-power-and-circulating-supply/558).\n\n#### Goals Means\n\n* Claim the allocated 5,051.21 $SAFE tokens before the 27th of December 2022\n* Designate a wallet to delegate the tokens to from a pre-selected nominees list.\n\nTo decide who to allocate these tokens to, we propose to have delegates nominated in the comments below! Contrary to the usual ‘For, Against, Abstain’ voting options, this vote will have a more granular option to not only whether to claim these tokens or not, but also who to delegate these tokens to!\n\nTo make the final voting options as simple as possible, the top 4 most liked ( ❤️ ) nominations were added to the final proposal, as well as an option to claim and not delegate (self-delegate). If two delegates have the same amount of votes for the 4th position, both will be included in the final proposal.\n\nFinally, due to the relative simplicity of the proposal, as well as the need to claim the tokens by the 27th, we propose a discussion period of 1 week instead of the usually recommended 2, that way there is time to claim the tokens after the 5 day voting period is over.\n\n#### Metrics and Forward Thinking Considerations\n\nThe only successful metric is claiming the SAFE tokens before they expire. If the DAO is unsatisfied with the delegation, a new vote could be made to re-delegate the tokens to a new party.\n\n#### Voting Options\n\n* Claim tokens, do not delegate votes\n* Claim tokens, delegate to Mona from Avantgarde Finance\n* Do not claim tokens\n* Abstain",

      "title": "PSP-IPΔ23: ParaSwap Smart Vault Fee Redistribution ",
      "content": "# **Simple Summary**\n\nMimic is a platform for DeFi automation. By deploying custom Smart Vaults, it can transform centralized manual work into trustless automated actions.\n\nRecently, members of the ParaSwap DAO have proposed to implement a Fee Redistribution mechanism as part of their [PSP 2.0 proposal](https://gov.paraswap.network/t/psp-2-0-revised-voting-edition/1207), in which assets accrued as fees would be converted to a native chain token (eg. ETH), and then distributed between stakers and the DAO treasury.\n\nIn the current version of the proposal, there is no automated solution for this mechanism. We propose that Mimic Smart Vaults could be used to automatically convert accrued assets into the desired token. Mimic Smart Vault could be deployed in each different layer ParaSwap is in to automate how ParaSwap collects, converts and distributes its protocol fees. \n\n# **Context: About Mimic**\n\nMimic is a platform that allows you to deploy tailored infrastructure to automate (and/or delegate) access to DeFi, in a secure and 100% non-custodial way. Mimic is especially suitable to replace and speed up manual and centralized tasks while tracking and monitoring every detail. This is achieved through our innovative **Smart Vaults** concept: an automated and trustless solution that can be customized to suit your operation needs.\n\nDeploying a Smart Vault is simple. We only need to figure out the best configuration that suits your needs and customize one for you. Moreover, Mimic provides you with lots of multi-layer flexibility, it can be easily scaled up by deploying and connecting additional Smart Vaults.\n\n![mimic_paraswap](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/qaL1YGdJI5_TSt5BXy80RmXkFT26Emg6j1Ryb6ycPMovDsaQLfS31Ut2OpUAjTTjl70HLtoEGbzkXheligAXJ7YmDPGWV1vN5wDLG3x_AvSrTf3brOQAqKu7ySfpBAcYISA6rzw1FpgQrsdT05dzvZtzR80tUjR1hxUPeoC8GKvQW3gxiK6gVXUoBwd4-A)\n\n\nOur team members have a large experience in blockchain and especially in DeFi protocols. We have previously worked on many well-known projects like Aave, Balancer, Open Zeppelin, Aragon, POAP, and The Graph.\n\n# **Goals**\n\nCurrently, ParaSwap DAO collects protocol fees in seven layers:  Ethereum Mainnet, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nAssuming that the ParaSwap DAO decides to implement the fee redistribution system proposed in PSP 2.0, We propose to provide ParaSwap DAO with a **solution to automate** how it collects and distributes its protocol fees to assist with the implementation of this system. To accomplish this, Mimic will deploy customized Smart Vaults owned by ParaSwap DAO, one on each layer.\n\nAll Smart Vaults will only be allowed to collect earned fees when each token reaches a pre-determined value in USDC. Collected PSP and wrapped native chain token will not be converted. Collected chain token will be wrapped  All other tokens will be converted to wrapped native chain token. Finally, once a month, those collected tokens will be automatically withdrawn from Mainnet Smart Vault to a ParaSwap smart contract to distribute back to their token holders.\n\nAlso, it is essential to mention that at all times, the DAO has full ownership and control of all Smart Vault’s assets. This means that, for example, at any moment, it can remove permissions to execute an action or withdraw any asset by itself.\n\n# **Means**\n\nThere will be seven Smart Vaults - one per layer: Ethereum Mainnet, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, Arbitrum, and Optimism. All Smart Vaults will have a single owner who has full control over them at all times.\n\nEach Smart Vault will be configured with a series of predefined actions. Some of which will be automatically executed by Mimic network of bots and others manually by an authorized manager that ParaSwap DAO designates. Those actions are:\n\n- **Gather and swap:** Gathers assets (except from WETH and ETH) from ParaSwap Fee Claimer and swaps them to WETH (except from PSP).\n- **Gather and wrap:** Gathers WETH or ETH from ParaSwap Fee Claimer and if ETH, wraps it into WETH.\n- **Withdraw monthly:** Withdraws WETH to a ParaSwap smart contract.\n- **Withdraw:** Withdraws any asset to an external wallet configured by the owner.\n\nNote that all this behavior will be enforced by smart contracts code. Actions won’t be allowed to perform any other logic (More information here: [https://docs.mimic.fi/general/how-it-works](https://docs.mimic.fi/general/how-it-works))\n\nIn case external conditions change, the deployed infrastructure can be adjusted as necessary on an ongoing basis to reach the endowment’s objectives. Smart Vaults provide full flexibility to add new allow-listed actions, change permissions or incorporate new strategies.\n\nFollowing the current implementation of PSP 2.0, all smart vaults could initially gather and swap into WETH, and the assets could be bridged to Mainnet for redistribution. If the DAO proposes to implement staking on any of these chains in the future, the parameters of these vaults could also be changed if needed.\n\n# **Metrics: Operational Details**\n\n## **1. Reporting**\n\nMimic offers a reporting site where users can follow all their Smart Vaults activity. Mimic also supports subscribing to a notifications service that can be easily integrated with some chat rooms like Discord. Additionally, users can subscribe to be notified with periodic reports that will be emitted by Mimic automatically.\n\n## **2. Maintenance**\n\nMimic will be in charge of monitoring the Smart Vaults daily, making sure the reporting tools are kept up-to-date accordingly. Additionally, Mimic will use its own bots infrastructure to execute the automated actions when needed.\n\nIf a critical report is received, Mimic will act immediately to assess its severity and act accordingly. In case Smart Vaults assets are at risk, the Mimic team will get in touch with the trusted committee to pause the Smart Vaults operations until it can be migrated to a new implementation with the corresponding fixes.\n\n## **3. Fees**\n\nMimic will charge a 2% fee for the assets processed through the Smart Vaults with a 5K USD monthly cap. Fees will start at 0% and increase by 0.5% every three months to reach 2% after a year of execution.\n\n## **3. a. Test Period**\n\nThe first six epochs of the Mimic implementation will be considered a pilot period to assess the effectiveness of the solutions implemented. After that, fees will increase by 0.5% every three months to reach 2% (always with a monthly cap).\n\n## **4. Termination**\n\nAs mentioned before, ParaSwap DAO will fully control its Smart Vaults and the funds deposited into them. This means ParaSwap DAO is allowed to exit at any point in time. Neither Mimic nor anyone else, unless it was previously allowed by the ParaSwap DAO, will never be in control of those funds.\n\n## **4. Audit**\n\nInitially, Mimic Smart Contracts have been all privately audited. They were recently audited by Verilog and no critical issues were found. Currently, they are being audited by Certora. More information and full reports here: [https://docs.mimic.fi/miscellaneous/security](https://docs.mimic.fi/miscellaneous/security)\n\n# **Implementation Overview**\n\nOnce the final details of the ParaSwap Smart Vaults are finalized, the Mimic team will take full responsibility for setting up the required automated actions. Mimic already counts with infrastructure to deploy and test Smart Vaults that can be applied for this use case.\n\nAssuming the proposed investment strategies and automated actions are accepted by ParaSwap DAO, setting seven Smart Vaults for it shouldn’t take longer than a month. After that, we will schedule an audit process just for the configuration before the deployment which shouldn’t take more than one week.\n\n# **Contact**\n\nWebsite — [mimic.fi](https://www.mimic.fi/)\n\nDocs — [docs.mimic.fi](https://docs.mimic.fi/general/whats-mimic)\n\nWhitepaper — [mimic.fi/whitepaper](https://www.mimic.fi/whitepaper)\n\nTwitter — [twitter.com/mimicfi](https://twitter.com/mimicfi)\n\nDiscord — [discord.mimic.fi](https://discord.mimic.fi/)\n\nMedium — [medium.com/mimicfi](https://medium.com/mimicfi)\n\n# **Voting Options**\n\n- For\n- Against\n- Abstain",

This proposal radically reduces token emissions and rewards users with protocol fees.\nThe most significant change in this proposal is the introduction of Social Escrow PSP (sePSP), a novel model in DeFi that rewards users who perform actions beneficial for the protocol and DAO growth.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreib7hjjnumxmfkzvndjwruwx3kqlwplqdg6zsftn6i62ywax6koiue)\n\n#### **Why are we introducing it?**\nThe main purpose of the PSP token is to scale and govern the ParaSwap protocol. After one year of observation and community feedback, we believe the current system could be improved by addressing its limitations: staking efficiency, liquidity, and sustainable native token emissions.\n#### **What are we proposing?**\nTo achieve these changes, PSP 2.0 proposes the following main ideas:\nOverhaul the PSP Staking system\nIntroduce the Social Escrow and reward boosting system (ParaBoost) to reward users with protocol fees instead of PSP\nImplement a pilot period in which a Governance Committee will monitor the new system.\nPropose the creation of vested PSP (vPSP), a one-year linearly locked version of sePSP to be used in future distribution events.\n\n## **Table of Contents**\n**Full details of the proposal can be found in our [forum post](https://gov.paraswap.network/t/psp-2-0-revised-voting-edition/1207)**\n#### **[Staking Mechanisms](https://gov.paraswap.network/t/psp-2-0-revised-voting-edition/1207#staking-mechanisms-12)**\n- sePSP1 - PSP Staking\n- sePSP2 - Liquidity Pool Staking\n- Introducing the Migration from sPSP/stkPSP\n#### **[Fee Redistribution and Epoch Alterations](https://gov.paraswap.network/t/psp-2-0-revised-voting-edition/1207#fee-redistribution-and-epoch-alterations-16)**\n#### **[ParaBoost and Social Escrow](https://gov.paraswap.network/t/psp-2-0-revised-voting-edition/1207#paraboost-and-social-escrow-17)**\n\n- Trading\n- Making\n- Token List and Wash Trading Prevention\n- Pooling\n- ParAccount\n- PSP Balance Booster\n- Referrals\n- Computing\n#### **[Emission Strategies](https://gov.paraswap.network/t/psp-2-0-revised-voting-edition/1207#emission-strategies-27)**\n- Vested sePSP\n- Gas Refund Adjustments\n#### **[Accountability Measures](https://gov.paraswap.network/t/psp-2-0-revised-voting-edition/1207#accountability-measures-30)**\n- Governance Committee (GovCo)\n- PSP 2.0 Pilot\n- Proposal Procedure Revisions\n- PSP Participation and Quorum\n#### **[Migration - PSP 1 Emissions Smoothing](https://gov.paraswap.network/t/psp-2-0-revised-voting-edition/1207#migration-psp-1-emissions-smoothing-36)**\n#### **[Effective Proposal Changes](https://gov.paraswap.network/t/psp-2-0-revised-voting-edition/1207#effective-proposal-changes-37)**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## **Effective Proposal Changes**\nActions effective immediately after the vote passes:\n- sPSP Emissions Smoothing for Migration: All emissions for PMMs will be stopped. Meanwhile, a maximum of 1.5M PSP/month will be distributed among each sPSP relative to the number of stakers in each pool.\n- Renewal of the Gas Refund Program\n- Introduction of Expedite Proposals\n \nActions effective after 2.0 launch:\n- Implementation of migration module\n- Epoch length alteration: Extension from 2 weeks to 1 month per individual epoch.\n- sPSP/Safety Module reward cut: The old emissions will be discontinued once the new system goes live\n- sPSP deposits pause: Once the new system is out, no more sPSP depositing will be allowed.\n- Enabling protocol fees reallocation for both previously accrued fees and future ones\n- Voting protocol alternation: Switching from the current tokens to sePSP and sePSP2 as the only voting tokens. sePSP will receive 1 voting power per PSP staked, while sePSP2 will receive the aforementioned 2.5x boost to voting power for the PSP staked in it.\n- sPSP/stkPSP cooldown modifications: The withdrawal times for both systems are to be altered for the transition to 0 for migration purposes.\n- Gas refund adjustments: Altering the Gas Refund levels to make them compatible with the new ParaBoost system\n—--\n\nFor a full explanation of each of the sections of the vote, please visit the **[forum post](https://gov.paraswap.network/t/psp-2-0-revised-voting-edition/1207)** \n\n    ",

      "title": "PSP-IPΔ21: Rectifying Pool 10 & 4 yield ahead of PSP 2.0",
      "content": "Pool10\nWe propose allocating 19,621 PSP rewards to users staking in sPSP10 by the middle of Epoch 24 (block 15712957) to rectify the volume it accrued while the staking system was not automatically reporting it. To compensate the Market Maker, we propose sending 19,621 PSP rewards to the Market Maker vesting contract.\n\nPool4\nMeanwhile, to deal with the external circumstances of Wintermute temporarily pausing DeFi operations, we propose:\n1) Final distribution of 170,000 PSP to the users staking in sPSP4 + APWine sPSP4 stakers by the middle of epoch24 (block 15712957) to cover for their Accrued Yield losses on sPSP4 while we propose moving into the new transition system for PSP 2.0.\n2) Pausing of Pool4 deposits\n3) Reduction of cooldown to 2 days to allow an easier transition into another pool\n\nBoth pool4 and pool10 rewards will be distributed via a distribution contract, and users will need to claim from a native UI to be built after the vote passes.\n\nContext\nThe current PSP staking system consists of a stake-to-signal mechanism in which stakers opt into any of the different ParaSwapPools representing Private Market Makers.\n\nRecently, ParaSwapPool10’s wallet change led to an epoch period (Epoch 24) in which, despite the Private Market Maker still accruing volume, no yield was reported to stakers. This led to ParaSwapPool10 stakers not receiving the yield they should have during Epoch 24.\n\nThis proposal aims to solve this situation by distributing the missed rewards to wallets that were staking by the middle of Epoch 24, hence did not have time to change to another pool and get that pool’s rewards. Additionally, the proposal will send the corresponding Market Maker rewards to the Market Maker’s vesting contract.\n\nAdditionally, Wintermute, the Private Market Maker behind Pool4, has ceased operations following a hack. This circumstance has been outside the control of both stakers and ParaSwap. For that reason, we propose to assist stakers of this pool in transitioning easier to a new Market Maker and receiving a legacy amount of emissions as we begin transitioning to the new system. To make a fair estimate of the legacy amount (170,000 PSP) we took into account the average last 6 epoch rewards allocated to Pool4.\n\nGoals and Means\n- To compensate previously missed rewards for Pool10 stakers.\n- Provide 19,621 PSP to Pool10 (sPSP10) mid of epoch 24 stakers and 19,621 PSP for Market Maker, totaling 39,242 PSP\n- Provide 170,000 PSP to sPSP4 + APWine sPSP4 mid of epoch 24 stakers as an early migration into the PSP2.0 transition system and compensate for Accrued Yield losses.\n- Pause deposits into sPSP4\n- Reduce cooldown to 2 days on sPSP4\n\nForward Thinking Considerations\nAssuming the proposal for PSP 2.0 passes, all future pools will receive similar emissions for users, as they will no longer be tied to Market Maker performance. This proposal will not interfere with the current PSP 2.0 discussion, as this one only deals with epoch 24.\n\nEligible addresses\nThe list of eligible addresses can be found here https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmX8CWo43RD5gY85kb96GWSkPF8A6FbPxTJWmZGxYCqC4H",

      "content": "PSPΔBP2 - Protocol-owned Liquidity Budget - 100 M PSP Allocation\n\nKey Goals\n\nTreasury, Budget, Liquidity\n\nSimple Summary\n\nTo allocate a new set of PSP to ensure healthy liquidity across all chains.\n\nContext\n\nEarlier this year, PSP-BP1 passed, setting a maximum spending limit for different categories of PSP. While this allowed for exploring potential spending uses of PSP, many functions did not address present problems in the PSP ecosystem.\n\nOne of the most recurrent issues of the first budget concerned the area of tokenomics. The high-emission schemes set to provide liquidity led to highly mercenary liquidity, which drained the assets as soon as the short-term emissions were over. Overall, this resulted in an unstable liquidity policy.\n\nFollowing the successful Olympus Pro liquidity capture scheme,  the main goal of this proposal will be to allocate a one-time amount of PSP that is significant enough to cover the liquidity needed for this rapidly increasing excitement on PSP 2.0 . Due to the substantial nature of the reforms of PSP 2.0, all other previously allocated PSP is best discussed in the upcoming PSP 2.0 proposal and framework.\n\nGoals\n\n    Increase the amount of liquidity available directly owned by the DAO following the successful pilot.\n\nBudget Categories and Allocations\n\nProtocol Owned Liquidity Budget - 100 M PSP\n\nThe most significant change reflects the change in our liquidity strategy. Rather than focusing on liquidity mining as a form of acquiring liquidity (which leads to inflationary and ineffective tokenomics), we will be allocating a significantly higher amount of PSP towards establishing a permanent source of liquidity. This can be done through bonds and directly pairing the liquidity to other assets.\n\nSince liquidity is something that requires to be present from the beginning rather than monthly, we propose to allocate 80M PSP to use in pairing to other assets for our desired liquidity, as well as allocating 20M PSP for bonding, to capture assets that will be used to pair with PSP.\nBudget Approval Restructuring\n\nAs we focus on allocating PSP more efficiently, if passed, this proposal would override the old vote’s protocol-owned liquidity budget emissions, becoming the unique valid source of truth for POL budget.",

      "title": "PSP-IP20:  Urgent Fix of Gas Refund",
      "content": "Keywords\nTokenomics, staking, Gas Refund\n\nSimple Summary\nSince early April - and following the guidelines set in PSP-IPΔ13 - the ParaSwap DAO started refunding PSP to ParaSwap users who staked on either the ParaSwapPools or the Safety Module. The main goal of this incentive is to grow our user base, increase the trading volume and encourage more participation in staking. \n\nAs of the time of writing, 9.5M PSP (equivalent to ~$460k) have been distributed. Overall, this initiative has gathered positive reactions from the community, as it has given PSP staking three main benefits in total:\nMaking the ParaSwap Protocol more efficient & competitive \nEarning auto compounding rewards on ParaSwapPool staking\nGetting gas refunds on top of these two existing benefits\n\nUnfortunately, since the release of the system we have begun noticing increasing instances of abuse from a minority of our stakers. Although the $30k limit has been enough to limit most of the damage, we’re seeing a few wallets getting around this limitation by farming and then market selling PSP the moment they get the gas refund.\n\nTo be more specific, here are the top 3 issues we found: \nTrading Bots can add a significant amount of sell pressure when claiming the PSP. For example: we found an address selling 736,000 PSP during this epoch start. While it is true that even these trades bring volume to the platform, a better designed distribution system would align the two parties’ interests closer: The ParaSwap DAO & those traders.\nWallets can get around the $30k limit by recycling wallets. It’s a limited case since it requires moving all assets to the new wallet, but it’s doable given the incentive.\nWallets can stake at the last few hours before the end of the epoch and make random trades to get relatively low-risk rewards.\n\nProposal\nTo address those issues, we propose making emergency adjustments applicable in this current epoch with a two days vote instead of five. This is to give the developers enough time to implement the changes before this epoch end (as now that abusers have discovered that we are aware of their tactics), as well as give stakers enough time to prepare for the upcoming changes.\n\nOverall, these are the changes being proposed: \n\nAlter the limit to a epoch maximum of $1.25k USD in PSP. This will be applied to  the current epoch, and may affect pending refund amounts. \nIntroduce a 7 day virtual lockup: from now on, every transaction that is made, the system will take into consideration the amount of PSP that was staked throughout the previous 7 days. Any staked PSP that is not present for the entirety of the 7 day period will not be counted\nCommit to introducing a future governance framework for any other emergency proposals following this one. \n\nGoals\nThe proposed actions will limit over-gaming the system as well as cap the rewards in a monthly basis. Additionally , the virtual lockup time helps mitigate gaming the system for rewards. \n\nOur main goal is to ensure the Gas Refund is healthy and contributes to the growth and sustainability of the ParaSwap DAO by ensuring that the incentives properly align with the original vision of the Program.\n\n\nVoting Options\nFor\nAgainst\nAbstain.",

      "title": "PSP-IP19: Depositing $PSP in Paraswap Decentralized bug bounty on Hats.finance",
      "content": "PSP-IP19: Depositing $PSP in Paraswap Decentralised bug bounty on Hats.finance\n2. Keywords\nsecurity, collaboration, hats.finance\n\n3. Simple Summary\nHi everyone, my name is Ofir, I’m a core contributor in Hats.finance Growth team.\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of the announcment 2 from the 9th of December 2021, the deployment of Paraswap’s vault ( Bug bounty) on Hats.finance dApp. This proposal’s goal is to approve the first deposit of $PSP, by Paraswap DAOs, into the vault.\n\n4. Context\nHats.finance is a decentralized bug bounty protocol that allows anyone to add liquidity to a smart bug bounty while farming $HATS. Hackers can responsibly disclose vulnerabilities with no identification and direct communication with the project dev team all of this while being rewarded with scalable prizes & NFTs for their work.\n\nSmart bug bounty programs are a win-win for everyone. They can be created easily with a few on-chain transactions and do not cost anything unless a vulnerability is discovered and fixed, which would be more costly and irreversible once exploited. More importantly, it is transparent, decentralized and empowers the community to protect a protocol they are invested in.\n\nThe paraswap vault (Bug bounty) was created with the support of the ParaSwap bug bounty committee members, their responsibility is:\n\n1/ Triage auditors/hackers reports/claims.\n2/ Approve claims within a reasonable time frame (Max of 6 days)\n3/ Be responsive via its telegram bot.\n\n5. Goals\nParaSwap bug bounty is already live on the mainnet, without any reward for hackers.\n\nThis proposal’s goal is to add a minimum of 1,000,000 $PSP tokens to the vault, to create the right incentive for hackers.\n\nThe bug bounty deposit/withdrawal is permissionless means anyone who holds $PSP can add liquidity to bug bounty and add more security to Paraswap protocol, in return anyone who deposits (DAO, Private, investors, etc…) can earn (Farm) $HATS tokens.\n\nThere is a minimum of 7 days between the withdrawal request and the withdrawal function.\n\n6. Means\nThe only requirement for this proposal to come to life is to vote on it. If the proposal passes, the DAO will deposit the amount into the Paraswap vault (bug bounty) and officially open the bug bounty for the user’s deposit. We encouraged $PSP holders to deposit a portion of their $PSP into the bug bounty to join the security efforts and in return farm $HAT governance tokens.\n\n6.1 Vault size:\nWhen you incentivize hackers with a big bounty, you drive attention to secure your protocol. Because the bounty is a relative portion of the vault, the more value the vault holds, the larger the prize.\n\n6.2 Benefits:\nProject covered:\n\n24/7 audit on your protocol with a proactive approach that incentivizes the hacker to disclose the vulnerability instead of hacking.\nA disclosed vulnerability means NO TVL/ TOKEN loss.\nPR of disclosure and fix becomes a strength to the project.\nAttract more users to the “strong and secure protocol”\nProposal benefits:\n\nPSP staked in vault brings higher security guarantees to ParaSwap.\nStaking PSP in the hat vaults reduces circulating token supply\nUsers who are aligned with the long-term goals of Paraswap can share responsibility for code flaws.\nOne-sided yield farming based on your PSP\nPSP community will gradually get voting rights in Hats decentralized security protocol.\nProject community / token holders:\n\nJoin the effort to secure the ecosystem.\nFinancial incentives in the form of Yield farming\nProtect their own project token by sacrificing a portion of their token, to make their holding more secure. By doing that, get $HAT.\n$$ Metrics:\n\nIf a hacker submits a vulnerability instead of hacking Paraswap contracts - this will be considered a success.\n\nForward-thinking considerations:\nThe DAO and the committee can consider editing or removing contracts from the bug bounty program. Increasing the bounty reward by the DAO, after the committee adds new contracts or deploys new versions.\n\nThanks!\n\nOfir | Hats.finance",

      "content": "### Simple Summary\n\nA [proposal](https://gov.paraswap.network/t/psp-ip-14-allocate-1-000-000-psp-to-bancor-pol/695) to deploy PSP funds from the treasury on Bancor has recently seen a positive response from the community.\n\nBancor 3 will address some of the concerns around Dual LM rewards sustainability, and implement a Dual LM program whereby any PSP committed for rewards will be matched with BNT in dollar value, up to 50,000 BNT ($138,000 with BNT at $2.76 or close to 1M PSP).\n\nThis proposal seeks to commit 1M PSP for the Dual LM campaign and benefit from 1M worth of PSP provided by BancorDAO. The rewards are auto-compounded gaslessly and become immediately available as trading liquidity.\n\n### Context\n\nIf PSP-IPΔ15 is Passed 1M PSP for Liquidity Mining Rewards (worth 50,000 BNT, $138,000 with BNT at $2.76 or close to 1M PSP) will be committed to the Bancor 3 PSP pool.\n\n### Goals\n\n* Incentivise $PSP Liquidity protected against Impermanent Loss on Bancor 3.\n\n* Better utilise the DAO funds for LM by leveraging the Bancor 3 dual LM program, which doubles the rewards up to 50,000 BNT worth of PSP.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe PSP Pool on Bancor currently holds 3.5M $PSP in Liquidity of which 2.5M PSP belongs to the DAO. The pool currently has an APR of 58.94%. It is now the second deepest pool, with the [PSP/ETH 1% Univ3 pool](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x4a73a7e29988f171910119d660c4dd548282bf2a) being the deepest at $1.72m TVL.\n\n> As mentioned in PSP-BPΔ1-5 by @dydymoon Liquidity Mining is not sustainable long term.\n\nBancor 3 aims to address the Liquidity Mining problem:\n\n- Funds committed for Liquidity Mining campaigns become immediately available as liquidity and can be used for swaps.\n\n- Rewards auto-compound gaslessly and are not sold for the pairing asset - users don't need to claim or restake rewards.\n\nThere is also currently a Dual LM program for Bancor 3 whereby:\n\n- Any PSP committed for rewards will be matched with BNT in dollar value, up to 50,000 BNT ($138,000 with BNT at $2.76 or close to 1M PSP).\n\n- The BNT LM rewards will me emitted over 24 months and with a decay emission model, but the PSP rewards can be emitted over any period and can use a constant and decay emission models.\n\n- This means that the Paraswap DAO can commit 2M worth of PSP (1M in PSP, 50k in BNT) for the cost of 1M PSP, and incentivise the pool on Bancor 3.\n\n### Means\n\nThe Proposed Budget is 1,000,000 $PSP to be committed to dual LM rewards on Bancor 3.\n\n",

      "title": "PSP-BPΔ1: ParaSwap DAO budget for 2022",
      "content": "KEY WORDS\n\nTreasury, Budget, Strategies\n\nREDACTOR\n\n@dydymoon.eth\n\nSIMPLE SUMMARY\n\nThe goals of this proposal are to establish a budget for the $PSP holdings of ParaSwap DAO unvested over a year. To do this, it seeks to lower the current staking rewards, rebalance the risk vs LPs, and establish upper spending limits for other DAO spending categories. This proposal will be split into 8 sub-proposals to validate every line of the budget.\n\nCONTEXT\n\nOver the first year, ParaSwap DAO will receive 13.5% of the total supply, for a total of 270M $PSP. This proposal will propose a potential repartition of the ecosystem reserve unlocked.\n\nTo make the calculations easier and start claiming the 2nd year allocation in 2023, the 270M will be used from November 2021 to December 31st 2022, so 13.5 months.\n\nThe staking reward budget represents 50% of this funds at the current rate, which is why this text will propose a reduction to help the DAO expenses to be more sustainable, and reduce the selling pressure on $PSP price in the long term.\n\nThis proposal aims to set upper spending limits for different budget categories, and does not mean that all of the allocated $PSP will be immediately spent on the proposed sub-sections.\n\nThe only BP’s that will be immediately applied will be BP1-1 and 1-2, as they are affecting already existing DAO programmes. All other ones will hinge on further viability discussion and votes to ensure further deployment.\n\nGOALS\n\nThis proposal will be split into 8 sub-proposals that will be submitted with specific proposals on each subject :\n\n* PSP-BPΔ1-1. Reduce the staking rewards budget (33M $PSP, 13.88% budget)\n* PSP-BPΔ1-2. Increase the liquidity mining DAO budget (42.58M $PSP, 17.91% budget)\n* PSP-BPΔ1-3. Curve war & $CVX budget (45M $PSP, 18.93% budget)\n* PSP-BPΔ1-4. Gas refund program budget (30.8M $PSP, 12.95% budget)\n* PSP-BPΔ1-5. Protocol owned liquidity (POL) budget (11M $PSP, 4.63% budget)\n* PSP-BPΔ1-6. Grant-Micro Grant budget (5.5M $PSP, 2.31% budget)\n* PSP-BPΔ1-7. Marketing & Partnership budget (4.95M $PSP, 2.08% budget)\n* PSP-BPΔ1-8. Contributors budget (5.5M $PSP, 2.31% budget)\n\nThis repartition keeps a significant part of the treasury unallocated (59.42M, 24.99% budget) that could be used to farm while including all the points above.\n\nRead the full proposal here: https://gov.paraswap.network/t/psp-bp-1-paraswap-dao-budget-for-2022/614/18\n\nVOTING OPTIONS\n\n* Accept the potential max spending of 56.78M PSP for February, March and April 2022\n* Refuse the potential max spending ok 56.78M PSP for February, March and April 2022\n* Abstain",

Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to establish the main parameters of PSP governance that can be adjusted later by the DAO.\n\n4. Context\n\nEstablishing the parameters of governance is a crucial step in the life of a DAO. It is now time to make the different steps of the governance explicit through parameters and detailed documentation.\n\n5. Goals\n\nThe governance of Paraswap is organized around several tools in order to structure discusions and signaling the most important points. The genesis of a proposal generally follows these steps :\n\n* Discord. Informal brainstorming and debate to explore interesting topics.\n* Forum. Reasoned and discussions to come up with a redacted proposal. That is to say refining of an idea before a final vote.\n* Snapshot. Voting on finalised proposals within the governance parameters.\n\nThis proposal establishes four governance parameters with the following function:\n\n1. Minimal PSP. What is voting power required to submit proposals? The default value is set to “5400 PSP” which correspond to the first third of the initial airdrop.\n2. Voting time. What is the standard duration of a vote? The default value is set to “5 days” to allow sufficient time for members to vote.\n3. Quorum. How many PSP votes are needed at least for a vote to be valid? The default value is set to “3% of circulating supply” in order to prevent blocking situations.\n4. Implementation delay. What is the standard delay for implementation? This parameter is specific to each proposal.\n\n6. Means\n\nThis proposal does not require financial resources.\n\n7. Metrics\n\nThe DAO will ensure that voting participation rates are monitored regularly. If necessary, it will update the governance parameters.\n\n8. Forward-thinking considerations\n\nThe first PSP-IP have been made by experienced members who are obviously familiar with DAO mechanisms. The next step will undoubtedly be to onboard beginning members who wish to become more competent in these matters. This could take the form of a “sandbox session” in the discord for writing proposals.\n\n9. Implementation Overview\n\nThe four governance parameters should be added to Snapshot as soon as possible. Their values will be set as defaults.\nThe governance scribes will encourage DAO members to use the forum for proposal development.\n\nA dedicated page of the documentation will be written by “Content producers” to explain the choice of parameters.\n\n10. Voting options\n\n“For”\n“Against”\n“Abstain”\n\nDiscussions here: https://gov.paraswap.network/t/psp-ip-6-defining-governance-process-and-parameters/83/7",

It is intended to simplify the work of governance in many ways:\n\n* First, to minimize as much as possible incomplete proposals that will require additional information.\n* Then, to facilitate the participation of DAO members by providing a complete and clear structure.\n* Finally, accelerate the proposals’ implementation by considering this topic at the drafting stage.\n\nThe “Governance scribes” are responsible to ensure that the ideas and first writings of the communities are in adequacy with the framework. In this sense, they are an accompaniment to the writing process, but they don’t take ownership of a proposal, which remains the property of its first writer.\n\nAfter several iterations following the experience of the first proposals, this framework is submitted to the PSP DAO for approval. If the proposal is accepted, it immediately standardizes the way future proposals will be written.\n\n1. Proposal Number & Name\nA number to identify the proposal, based on the order of submission and name (= snapshot vote title). Ex: PSP-IPΔ4: ParaSwap Improvement Proposal Framework\n\n2. Keywords\nOne or multiple choice: Front-end upgrade, smart contract development, marketing and communication, security, PSP token upgrade, PSP liquidity incentives, PSP staking policy, parameter update, integrations, and synergies.\n\n3. Simple Summary\nClear and layman-accessible one or two-line summary of the proposal.\n\n4. Context\nComprehensive overview of the issue being addressed and the solution proposed (~ 100w).\n\n5. Goals\nWhat are the main goals of the proposal? What is it trying to accomplish?\n\n6. Means\nWhat the proposal requires to come to life: PSP budget, additional development on the ParaSwap product, external development, etc.\n\n7. Metrics\nHow will success be measured? What metrics will be used to evaluate the success of the proposed implementation?\n\n8. Forward-thinking considerations\nWith this proposal implemented, what are the next steps to consider? Does this proposal include any new parameter the DAO can adjust? Does it call for a revision of another subcomponent of the system?\n\n9. Implementation overview\nWhat happens if this proposal goes through? A high-level overview of the main steps required for its implementation. A deadline can be added for the implementation\n\n10. Voting options\nWhat options will be voted on? For closed proposals, the classic options are “For”, “Against” and “Abstain”.",

      "content": "link: https://gov.paraswap.network/t/psp-ip-3-bancor-allocation-addendum/107/11\n\n2. Keywords\nPSP liquidity incentives\n\n3. Simple summary\nThe PSP-IPΔ3 seeks a PSP deposit into the Bancor Liquidity Pool to help grow the protocol liquidity depth and help further diversify the liquidity sources. The proposal does not cost the protocol anything as all liquidity would be fully protocol owned (= “POL”). The liquidity deposited in Bancor will also accrue risk free fees creating another revenue stream for the protocol.\n\n4. Context\nIn PSP-IPΔ2, PSP governance discussed the need to create a more sustainable and more balanced liquidity source through SushiSwap. In this perspective, the Key Performance Indicator (= KPI) was fixed with an ojective of 10M PSP + ETH equivalent supplied, two months after the launch of the program. This proposal be likened to an addendum to help achieve this goal.\n\n5. Goals\nThe PSP-IPΔ3 seeks to fulfill 5% of the liquidity goal for SushiSwap in PSP-IPΔ2 at no cost to the protocol right off the bat and would generate a return for the treasury long-term. The Bancor protocole currently has two main advantages that are of great use for DAOs:\n\nSingle-Sided Staking. Since deposits on Bancor are purely single sided this means the treasury can greatly increase it’s liquidity depth without having to provide a counter asset like ETH.\nImpermanent Loss Protection. Other AMMs are hard to garner liquidity naturally due to the great cost liquidity providers incur through impermanent loss (when price diverges liquidit providers lose out profits to the Market and Arbitragers). For this reason Liquidity Mining (= LM) is a must for DEX like SushiSwap or UniSwap, but Bancor doubles as an insurance company completely negating this risk by arbitraging it’s own token as well as paying out any extra loses in it’s native token back to liquidity providers.\nTypically for space to be opened single sided in a Bancor Pool there has to be equal amounts of BNT on the other side staked single-sidedly but this can also be achieved via a BancorDAO co-investment. Such a proposal has already passed and details can be read here :\n\n\nBancor Governance Forum – 17 Nov 21\n\nProposal: Whitelist ParaSwap (PSP) + 100K BNT Co-Invest\nProposal: Whitelist ParaSwap (PSP) + 100K BNT Co-Invest This proposal is expected to appear on Snapshot for voting on November 21, 2021 4:00 AM . TLDR; This proposal seeks to Whitelist the PSP Token. There are no apparent security concerns. There...\n\nReading time: 1 mins 🕑Likes: 8 ❤\nThis Bancor proposal opened up enough space for 800 000 PSP at current market prices to be staked single sided but due to our own inflationary single-sided rewards being incredibly high the pool has not had enough liquidity to grow naturally. A deposit should allow for the pool to begin reaping more fees from aggregators while still allowing for room for more community liquidity providers to join.\n\n6. Means\nThe financial means associated with this proposal are the main issue. Several parameters are to be considered :\n\nThe PSP Bancor pool can currently support an 800 000 PSP deposit single-sided.\nA budget over this amount can be allocated, to account for potential further single-sided BNT deposits.\nA budget below this amount can be allocated, to leave some space for community members should volume pick up and/or staking rewards lower on Paraswap natively.\n7. Metrics\nPSP governance should monitor the volume of transactions processed by the pool to measure its effective contribution to PSP’s overall liquidity.\n8. Forward-thinking considerations\nThe initial budget will be committed for three months (when deposited on Bancor up to the space available) to benefit from impermanent loss protection. Once the initial commitment period clears, it can be adjusted by further DAO votes.\nBancorV3 is coming and should provide additional benefits: a migration tool will be provided.\n9. Implementation overview\nThe ParaSwap DAO multisig will supply liquidity on the PSP Bancor pool, up to the amount decided by the community and within the limits of the space available for single-sided deposits. If necessary, the deposit will be split into several smaller operations.\nWhen BancorV3 goes live, the migration will be conducted as soon as safe and possible.\nThe team/community will work together to figure the best options to enable easy tracking of the DAO’s treasury assets and their performance.\n10. Voting options\n“Allocate 1.5M PSP, fill 800 000 PSP and wait on a BancorDAO vote for an increased BNT co-investment.”\n“Allocate 700 000 PSP, fill 700 000 PSP”\n“Do nothing”\n“Abstain”",
