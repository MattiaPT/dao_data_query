      "content": "During NFT NYC, we propose to send an ambassador to walk around and engage with attendees, spreading awareness about Bud DAO and its mission to promote the intentional use of cannabis. The ambassador will answer any questions attendees may have about Bud DAO's work in funding grants and proposals to expand the understanding and science of cannabis.\n\nThe ambassador will highlight the importance of understanding cannabis as a natural resource and how it can be used intentionally for various purposes such as pain relief, creativity, and relaxation. They will emphasize Bud DAO's commitment to promoting responsible and intentional use of cannabis to achieve a positive impact on individuals and society as a whole.\n\nBy having an ambassador present at NFT NYC and events such as w3bstock and the Nouns Sail , we hope to engage attendees in meaningful conversations about the benefits of cannabis and the importance of responsible use. We believe this will be a valuable contribution to the event and its attendees, and will help further Bud DAO's mission of proliferating the intentional use of cannabis.",

      "content": "<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/HrQKZMG.png\"></p><h2><br></h2><h2>Summary</h2><p>This proposal upgrades the DAO to V1.1 to add the following features, improvements and bug fixes.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Updatable Founder Shares</h3><p>DAOs will now be able to propose changes to founders shares. This gives DAOs the ability to add, modify and remove founders shares via proposal.</p><p>With this new feature DAO creators will have the ability to modify any errors that may have been caused at DAO deployment.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Upgrade Visibility</h3><p>In V1.1, each smart contract of a DAO now has an explicit version attached. This means that members and developers will be able easily understand which protocol implementation a DAO is utilizing at any given time.</p><p>This will also make it easier for future upgrades that are in development: including <em>airdrops</em> and <em>custom metadata renderers</em>.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Proposal Spam Fix</h3><p>Proposal submission to a DAO has an incorrectly implemented check which can allow for spam proposals to be submitted to a DAO. In V1.1 it works as expected.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Auction Improvements</h3><p>Improved bid handling and edge case management in the Auction House contracts.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Author</h3><p>This upgrade has been developed and proposed by <strong>Zora</strong> (<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xd1d1d4e36117ab794ec5d4c78cbd3a8904e691d0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 122, 183); background-color: transparent;\">zora.eth</a>)</p>",
