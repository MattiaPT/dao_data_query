      "content": "## Summary\n- This AIP proposes to establish AirSwap Grant Proposals.\n- AGPs welcome individuals and teams to request treasury AST to fund projects that aim to advance the development, growth, and adoption of AirSwap.\n\n## Specification\nThe proposal structure and process are as follows.\n\n## Structure\nEach proposal includes a summary, owner, scope, amount, timeline, and copyright. Each AirSwap Grant Proposal (AGP) should be titled AGP XX: <Title>.\n\n- Goals and Summary — A short summary describing the proposal.\n- Project Owner — The person or people accountable for completing and delivering the project.\n- Project Scope — A list, illustration, or description of components of the system or initiative to be delivered.\n- Request Amount – Full amount or tranches (in AST) with an explanation of the use of funds.\n- Timeline with Milestones — A list with dates, time windows, or steps that the project owner aims to hit including proposed final delivery date.\n- Copyright — All proposals are public domain via CC0.\n\n## Process\nEach proposal follows a process from idea to implementation.\n\n- Draft — Project owner drafts and iterates on the proposal on Discord at least 3 weeks prior to vote.\n- Voting — Project owner proposes a vote to finalize the proposal which is then voted on by AirSwap DAO members during the monthly voting cycle.\n- Acceptance — If the vote passes (accepted by > 50% of participating AST), the project is funded according to the scheduled release cycle.\n- Implementation — Project owner is to report according to the timeline as the project is delivered. AirSwap contributors have the final say over project acceptance and disbursement of AST to project owners.\n\n## Rationale\nThe main goal is to boost AirSwap’s growth by welcoming individuals and teams to request funding for projects that aim to advance the development, growth, and adoption of AirSwap. The AGP program will be announced with a call for projects to garner interest in building dApps on AirSwap protocols.\n\nThe AGP program also aims to improve partnerships between project teams and the AirSwap DAO. Projects building on AirSwap would be able to provide rapid feedback about the AirSwap protocol to Contributors, such as unclear documentation, new feature requests, etc. Similarly, AirSwap DAO members will also be more aware of projects building on AirSwap, increasing the transparency of the ecosystem.\n\nWe believe that AirSwap DAO governance is mature enough to assess the merits vs budget of each AGP, and DAO members are encouraged to participate in discussions with the project teams before voting commences.\n\n## Copyright\nAll proposals are public domain via CC0.",

      "title": "AIP 92: Allocation of Fees for October Contributor Tips",
      "content": "### Summary\n\nThis AIP aims to address potential delays or issues with Treasury withdrawals by utilizing a percentage of the current fees from the BSC, Polygon, and AVAX pools to compensate October Contributors and will be applied before AIP 91. Three options are presented:\n\n- Distribute 100% of the fees to fund October Contributor Tips.\n- Distribute 50% of the fees for October Contributor Tips and allocate 50% for voter rewards.\n- Keep the current distribution. \n\nThis proposal will be executed only if AST is not withdrawn in a timely manner this month. If executed, a future AIP may be introduced to consider reimbursement.\n\n### Specification\n\n**Option 1:**  100% of fees for Contributors: All fees collected from BSC, Polygon, and AVAX pools will be used to compensate October Contributors as per AIP 71.\n\n**Option 2:** 50% of fees for Contributors and 50% for Voters: Half of the fees from BSC, Polygon, and AVAX pools will be designated for October Contributor Tips, while the other half will be allocated for voter rewards.\n\n**Option 3:** Maintain the current distribution.\n\n### Rationale\n\nAs the AirSwap DAO continues to deliberate on the Treasury's operational processes, potential delays may arise. This proposal seeks to ensure timely compensation for Contributors by using fees from the specified pools. This proposal will be executed only if AST is not withdrawn in a timely manner this month. If executed, a future AIP may be introduced to consider reimbursement. The aim is to alleviate any issues or setbacks in the regular payment schedule.\n\n### Copyright\n\nAll proposals are public domain via[ CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/).",

      "content": "### Summary\n\nThis AIP proposes to choose which methods will be applied on the claiming interface. \n\n- The Multi-Claim will be launched after the vote.\n- The Multi-Claim allows stakers to claim with the same epoch on different chains.\n\n### Specification\n\n**Option 1**  : Non-ETH pools are to remain closed until a future proposal.\n**Option 2**  : Max claim on non-ETH pools to be set to 100% (as currently on ETH).\n**Option 3**  : Max claim on non-ETH pools to be set to 50% and then set to 100% after 1 month.\n\n\n### Rationale\n\nAirSwap DAO successfully launched the new staking (voting & claiming) interface at https://dao.airswap.eth.limo/. \n\nIn order to fully release the claiming workflow, AirSwap DAO will open the claim in BSC, Polygon, Avax.\n\nTo perform such actions, Activate (former claiming interface) used a centralized database for the points management combined with ECDSA signature. AirSwap DAO is using merkle trees to make the claim working. \n\nPreviously, the claiming process allowed you only to claim once.  With the current process, you can claim once per chain for every epoch. The proposal is about giving the choice to accept the default modification or to refuse it and search for a better one.\n\n### Copyright\nAll proposals are public domain via[ CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/).",
