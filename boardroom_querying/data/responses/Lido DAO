      "title": "Integrate CSM into the Decentralized Validator Vault",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThe upcoming introduction of the Community Staking Module (CSM) offers an opportunity to expand the scope of [Mellow’s Decentralized Validator Vault](https://app.mellow.finance/vaults/ethereum-dvsteth) (DVV). This proposal aims to integrate the CSM into the DVV alongside the Simple DVT Module, benefiting stakers using the CSM, Mellow DVV users, and the overall decentralization of the Lido on Ethereum protocol.\n\nThis proposal suggests to augment the current scope of Node Operator incentives such that:\n\n1. The CSM will be included within the vault's scope, allowing stake from the vault to flow to the module without any changes to the existing on-chain code of the Lido Staking Router deposit methodology, while also providing DVT provider incentives to the relevant participants.\n2. Vault users will receive 80% of the DVT provider incentives allocated to CSM operators that utilize DVT* within the module.\n3. CSM operators utilizing DVT will receive 20% of the provider incentives pertaining to the validators they run utilizing DVT as a node operator within the Community Staking Module.\n\n`*` Analysis of which CSM operators are using DVT is ultimately performed by each DVT provider separately and independently based on their own criteria.\n\nNo on-chain actions are required to implement this proposal. If accepted, cross-team coordination with the DVT providers and Mellow will continue for point calculations, also including the CSM Operators utilizing DVT in the point calculations for Node Operators and vault users. \n\n## Motivation\n\nSince its launch in August, the DVV has facilitated the addition of over 4,700 ETH staked through Lido on Ethereum, equivalent to 140+ validators.\n\nThe Lido protocol benefits from the continued expansion and decentralization of the Lido Node Operator set via the addition of solo and community stakers, as well as via the incentivization of participants to utilize DVT which provides benefits to infrastructure resilience and key security when combined with Distributed Key Generation (DKG).\n\nStakers using the CSM will receive stake to their validators faster via the DVV, and for those operators utilizing DVT they will receive 20% of the DVT provider incentives generated for the validators they operate.\n\nUsers of the Decentralized Validator Vault receive an incremental 80% of the DVT provider incentives generated via CSM validators utilzing DVT in addition to 90% of the Simple DVT Module incentives, while continuing to support the decentralization of the Lido Node Operator set.\n\n## Why Should CSM be Included in the DVV?\n\nWhile the use of DVT is not mandatory within the permissionless CSM, some Node Operators using the module are likely to utilize DVT given the benefits it provides to infrastructure resilience and decentralization as well as key security when combined with [DKG](https://blog.lido.fi/leveraging-distributed-validator-technology/). Given the ongoing [SSV Incentivized Mainnet](https://ssv.network/incentivized-mainnet/) and [Obol Contribution](https://obol.org/contributions) programs, these DVT-based validators may be eligible to receive incentives from the respective DVT providers.\n\nAs described in the [Community Staking Module](https://research.lido.fi/t/community-staking-module/5917) summary thread, users of the module will put forward a [bond](https://docs.lido.fi/staking-modules/csm/join-csm/#bond) to provide coverage for possible issues or malicious actions on the side of the Node Operator. Currently, the proposed bond curve has been set between 2.4 to 1.3 ETH per validator depending on the number of total validators a node operator is running using the CSM. The validators running via CSM receive the 32 ETH required to run a validator from the CSM via the Lido Staking Router, while their bond is locked separately within the CSM contracts.\n\nGiven that CSM Node Operators are utilizing the Lido protocol to receive the ETH required to deposit to the validators, the protocol should also receive a portion of the incentives from the given DVT providers as is the case within the Simple DVT Module.\n\nThis proposal suggests that CSM Node Operators receive 20% of DVT provider incentives pertaining to their DVT-based validators utilizing the CSM, compared to operators in the Simple DVT Module that receive 10% of the incentives, to reflect the higher capital requirement for CSM validator operation.\n\nIn the case of a DVT cluster running a single validator using CSM, the cluster would put forward a 2.4 ETH bond, equivalent to 7.5% of the ETH required to run a solo validator. Taking this into account along with the 1% reward share for Obol Contributions, or the 0.5% network usage fee (expected to increase to 1% over the next 18 months) from SSV Network, a 20% share of the incentives reflects the incremental bond provided by CSM Node Operators as well as the rewards share required to utilize DVT.\n\nIn addition, it also reduces the likelihood of the potential en masse outsourcing of validator operations in the CSM Module in order to collect incentives from DVT providers, which in a negative scenario could lead to delegated stake representing the majority of CSM validators.\n\n## What is the impact to DVV users?\n\nUsers in the vault will receive incremental points for CSM node operators utilizing either Obol or SSV to run validators. The vault will accrue 80% of the points for any validators in CSM utilizing DVT. This will be tracked utilizing the SSV Incentived Mainnet calculation algorithm and Obol splitters for the respective DVT providers.\n\nVault users will continue to receive 90% of the DVT providers points generated via the Simple DVT Module and 100% of related Mellow points. Currently, as the module has a significantly higher number of Obol based validators active compared to the amount of ETH in the vault, users are receiving a boost to the number of Obol points on their stake within the vault.\n\nWhile some deposits from the DVV will flow to non-DVT based validators within the vault, this is also true in the case that no changes are made, as a result of the existing stake distribution algorithm inherent to the design of the Staking Router. The CSM currently is proposed to go live with an initial 1% share limit of stake compared to the 4% share limit of the Simple DVT Module.\n\nThis proposal will allow for DVV users to receive incremental points while continuing to support the decentralization of the Lido protocol.\n\n## Incentive Splits\n\n**Current Distribution of the DVV + SDVTM Points:**\n\n|  | **Mellow Points** | **SSV Points** | **Obol Points** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **DVV user share of incentives** | 100% | 90% | 90% |\n| **SDVT Cluster share of incentives *(respective to number of clusters operated using specific DVT infra)*** | 0% | 10% | 10% |\n\n**Proposed Distribution of the DVV + SDVTM + CSM (DVT) Points:**\n\n|  | **Mellow Points** | **SSV Points** | **Obol Points** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **DVV user share of incentives (SDVT validators)** | 100% | 90% | 90% |\n| **SDVT Cluster share of incentives *(respective to number of clusters operated using specific DVT infra)*** | 0% | 10% | 10% |\n| **DVV user share of incentives (DVT CSM validators)** | 100% | 80% | 80% |\n| **CSM Cluster share of incentives *(respective to validators operated using specific DVT infra)*** | 0% | 20% | 20% |",

      "title": "Should the Lido DAO recognize the wstETH bridge endpoints on Zircuit as canonical?",
      "content": "The proposal is to recognize the wstETH token bridging endpoints for Zircuit by the Lido DAO as canonical. If Snapshot passes, the Lido DAO will control the endpoints of wstETH token contract (including the token contract on Zircuit itself) as a proxy admin. Lido DAO will only have the upgrade authority of the wstETH proxy contract, and will not be able to manage the native bridge itself.\n\n## About Zircuit\n\nZircuit is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) - compatible Zero-Knowledge Layer 2 rollup with AI-enabled security at the sequencer level. Apart from offering much lower network fees and higher transaction throughput than Ethereum mainnet, Zircuit’s main focus is security. Zircuit aims to become a central hub for restaked assets.\n\nZircuit is working with a multitude of DeFi projects to build a robust and secure ecosystem. Zircuit has not yet migrated funds from the Ethereum Mainnet onto Zircuit L2 and is still in its Testnet phase, but currently (September 2024), there is $1.8B in the Zircuit staking contract (see [DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/protocol/zircuit-staking)), of which about $120M is in wstETH. This number alone suggests that wstETH will play a key role in the Zircuit L2 ecosystem.\n\n### Links\n- [Zircuit Website](https://www.zircuit.com/)\n- [Zircuit Documentation](https://docs.zircuit.com/)\n\n## Audits\n\nTo better form an opinion you may consider reading through the audit reports for:\n\n- wstETH Token Bridge: [audits/L2/Lido-L2-2022-07-Oxorio-Smart-Contracts-Security-Audit-Report.pdf](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits/blob/main/L2/Lido-L2-2022-07-Oxorio-Smart-Contracts-Security-Audit-Report.pdf)\n- Governance Crosschain Bridges: [audits/L2/Governance-Crosschain-Bridges-2022-08-Oxorio-Audit Report.pdf](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits/blob/main/L2/Governance-Crosschain-Bridges-2022-08-Oxorio-Audit%20Report.pdf)\n- wstETH Deployment on Zircuit: [Zircuit / Lido / NEW Proposal](https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/zircuit-lido-new-proposal/a8c75e25-29ae-4628-ab06-4c3a35123652/index.html)\n\n## **Deployments on Mainnet (L1) and Zircuit (L2):**\n\nBridge UI: https://bridge.zircuit.com/\n\nExplorer: https://explorer.zircuit.com/\n\n### Contracts\n\n### Ethereum\n\n- L1ERC20TokenBridge\n    - Implementation: [0x6bc726C993103197C41d787dd72eCd4D2e1614E8](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6bc726C993103197C41d787dd72eCd4D2e1614E8)\n    - OssifiableProxy: [0x912C7271a6A3622dfb8B218eb46a6122aB046C79](https://etherscan.io/address/0x912C7271a6A3622dfb8B218eb46a6122aB046C79)\n\n### Zircuit\n\n- ERC20Bridged\n    - Implementation: [0x929569e10d9166f31c8284fE3FE5db1C1E56D6b4](https://explorer.zircuit.com/address/0x929569e10d9166f31c8284fE3FE5db1C1E56D6b4)\n    - OssifiableProxy: [0xf0e673Bc224A8Ca3ff67a61605814666b1234833](https://explorer.zircuit.com/address/0xf0e673Bc224A8Ca3ff67a61605814666b1234833)\n- L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - Implementation: [0x224F00AEDD7A9F10e571898662ad19CD5abd9F2c](https://explorer.zircuit.com/address/0x224F00AEDD7A9F10e571898662ad19CD5abd9F2c)\n    - OssifiableProxy: [0xF4DC271cA48446a5d2b97Ff41D39918DF8A4Eb0e](https://explorer.zircuit.com/address/0xF4DC271cA48446a5d2b97Ff41D39918DF8A4Eb0e)\n- OptimismBridgeExecutor: [0x6Bf2cac3ed2481da30aD36Cd3D64325c31065Cc5](https://explorer.zircuit.com/address/0x6Bf2cac3ed2481da30aD36Cd3D64325c31065Cc5)\n\n### Levers Setup\n\n- OptimismBridgeExecutor\n    - getEthereumGovernanceExecutor(): Lido DAO Agent: [0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n- Ultimate admin and role holder on L1 is the Lido DAO Agent: [0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n    - Proxy admin for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_ENABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_ENABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n- Ultimate admin and role holder on L2 is the OptimismBridgeExecutor: [0x6Bf2cac3ed2481da30aD36Cd3D64325c31065Cc5](https://explorer.zircuit.com/address/0x6Bf2cac3ed2481da30aD36Cd3D64325c31065Cc5)\n    - Proxies admin for ERC20Bridged, L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_ENABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_ENABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n- Lido Emergency brakes multisig on L1: [0x73b047fe6337183A454c5217241D780a932777bD](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x73b047fe6337183A454c5217241D780a932777bD)\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n- Lido Emergency brakes multisig on L2: [0x9Bff79BF7226cB5C16d0Cca9c1dc60450feE560d](https://safe.zircuit.com/settings/setup?safe=zircuit-mainnet:0x9Bff79BF7226cB5C16d0Cca9c1dc60450feE560d)\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge",

      "title": "Lido Alliance application: Bolt",
      "content": "## **Summary**\n\n**Bolt, a protocol developed by Chainbound, enables sub-second [preconfirmations](https://www.luganodes.com/blog/preconfirmations-explained/) on Ethereum** through the use of proposer commitments, a novel primitive that allows proposers (validators) to make credible commitments on the blocks they produce.\n\nIn this proposal, [Chainbound](https://chainbound.io/) asks for the onboarding Bolt as a part of Lido Alliance (a framework for Lido DAO to provide support and endorsement to protocols that share a strong dedication to security and an unwavering commitment to decentralizing Ethereum validation, more details [here](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xd70197783e2a5ce8d32ab2021ee08c21d12fc3e7f7e942b8cdd6aa3f6edb029a)).\n\n## How Bolt will help the Lido Alliance achieve its mission:\n\n- **Ethereum-alignment and commitment to decentralized validation**\n\nBolt’s [innovation](https://chainbound.github.io/bolt-docs/) helps improve Ethereum's UX and bolsters its censorship resistance, namely via new out-of-protocol primitives such as preconfirmations and inclusion lists.\n\nBolt’s preconfirmation design is trust-minimized, credible, permissionless and compatible with the existing [PBS](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/pbs/) pipeline (and eventually ePBS). Ultimately, the goal is to boost the value of differentiated blockspace for users and applications, as well as generate more yield for validators.\n\n- **Strategic alignment with Lido DAO’s values and long-term goals**\n\nOne of the [key reGOOSE principles](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x300523518b08f20c585751c0a720ef3ec53698d4e5062154d285b15cb062f96c), adopted in May of this year, is to ‘support Ethereum-aligned validator services, starting with preconfirmations without exposing users to additional risk’.\n\nPreconfirmation offers significant advantages to the end user, such as the provision of early signals of transaction validity, reduced uncertainty during the confirmation period, improved security measures and faster decision-making for time-sensitive applications.\n\nPreconfirmations are high on the list of use cases that should be championed by the Lido Alliance. Their implementation supports the innovation ethos and helps the protocol stay on top of the latest advancements in the block production pipeline.\n\n- **Effective Preconf solution for Node Operators on Lido on Ethereum**\n\nBolt is implemented out-of-protocol, easy to integrate, and designed to be compatible with the existing block production pipeline. It covers a number of existing block-space use cases while future-proofing in case of a transition towards ePBS. With Bolt, validators do not need to rely on trusted relationships (no added gateways or special relays are required in order to run the software) to make commitments to further monetize their blockspace, which minimizes centralization factors and single-point of failure risks.\n\n- **Chainbound Commitment to Lido Alliance**\n\nChainbound plans to allocate **6.5%** of Bolt's total token supply to the Lido Alliance. The total allocation consists of two components:\n\n- **Strategic Allocation:** 3.5%\n\nThis 3.5% represents the *minimum* number of tokens that the Lido Alliance will receive. Tokens will follow the same unlock schedule as early contributors to Bolt.\n\n- **KPI-Based Allocation:** 3%\n\nThe KPI is defined as the percentage of Ethereum delegated to validators part of the Lido on Ethereum Curated Module who have opted in and are running the Bolt protocol, out of the total amount of Ethereum delegated to all validators part of the Lido on Ethereum Curated Module.\n\nA 90% adoption rate among the validators part of the Lido on Ethereum Curated Module is targeted as the threshold for 100% KPI achievement.\n\nMore in-depth explanations with examples can be found at the [link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWHpCxrPrR5zNdWnYn5d2RvwzQM4uiypQKLqwg7DpVrNm).\n\n## What Chainbound is seeking from Lido Alliance membership:\n\n- **Endorsement, Integration, and communication support**\n\nLido DAO’s acceptance of Chainbound as a member of Lido Alliance for the Bolt protocol.\n\nLido DAO will endorse Bolt as one of the preconfirmation solutions that align with key reGOOSE principles, facilitating the adoption of Bolt on Ethereum. This initiative will begin with support for Cohort 1, a working group focused on testing Bolt on Holesky, by encouraging Node Operators within Lido on Ethereum to participate in Bolt’s opt-in testnet.\n\nTo the extent possible and where appropriate, collaborate with Bolt in community distribution channels, such as websites, landing pages, and support large Bolt announcements.\n\n- **Support and consultation**\n\nDirect collaboration with Lido’s contributors and working groups, including feedback and evaluation of Bolt’s design choices, suggestions on auditors and potential partners, and continuous testing of the Bolt software.\n\n## **Proposal actions**\n\nThrough the proposal, Chainbound requests onboarding of Bolt to Lido Alliance.",

      "title": "Lido Community Staking Module Mainnet Release Setup",
      "content": "Lido Community Staking contributors are seeking the support of the Lido DAO members regarding the upcoming Community Staking Module release on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\n## **TL;DR**\n\n[Community Staking Module](https://research.lido.fi/t/community-staking-module/5917) (CSM) is the first-ever permissionless staking module built for the Lido on Ethereum staking protocol. Initially announced and [approved](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xa39815519107002997769f0b79a9e3957c3bf793166ab948fc6413ce5b3def55) for development in November 2023, the module has already demonstrated outstanding results on the [Holesky testnet](https://docs.lido.fi/deployed-contracts/holesky#community-staking-module).\n\n**This snapshot aims to get signal approval from the Lido DAO members regarding CSM parameters, their configuration for use in the mainnet release, and the granting of some CSM management permissions to the CSM committee.**\n\n## **CSM design**\n\nAs outlined in the original [forum post](https://research.lido.fi/t/community-staking-module/5917) and [snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xa39815519107002997769f0b79a9e3957c3bf793166ab948fc6413ce5b3def55), the main design features of CSM are:\n> 1. Permissionless entry with [bond](https://docs.lido.fi/staking-modules/csm/join-csm#bond)\n> 2. Only ETH (stETH) as a bond token\n> 3. “Non-linear” bond scaling for Node Operators\n> 4. First in, first out stake allocation queue\n> 5. Performance oracle with performance threshold approach for solo-staker friendly rewards distribution\n\nDuring module development, additional features were introduced:\n\n1. [Early Adoption period](https://docs.lido.fi/staking-modules/csm/join-csm#early-adoption-period) ensuring exclusive solo and community stakers participation during early stages of the module with beneficial bond curve\n2. MEV-stealing penalty reporting by the [committee multi-sig](https://research.lido.fi/t/csm-committee-creation/8333) and settling using a [dedicated Easy Track](https://github.com/lidofinance/easy-track/pull/71) motions\n\nThe final design description is in [LIP-26](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-26.md). The module's code is in the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/lidofinance/community-staking-module/).\n\n## **CSM parameters**\n\nGiven the sophisticated design of CSM, a bunch of parameters should be set during the module deployment. The actual values for the majority of them are published on the [Lido Research forum](https://research.lido.fi/t/community-staking-module/5917/55) and [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcNrpzS6oeeMK9SNABrWS4qWtEfUcSiYJqkRD43WuMo2f) (CID: `QmcNrpzS6oeeMK9SNABrWS4qWtEfUcSiYJqkRD43WuMo2f`). A detailed description of the usage of the parameters can be found in the [original post](https://research.lido.fi/t/community-staking-module/5917/55) and [LIP-26](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-26.md).\n\n## **CSM Committee and multi-sig**\n\nA [dedicated committee](https://research.lido.fi/t/csm-committee-creation/8333) was formed to serve as Lido DAO representative in some management functions of CSM, namely:\n\n- Reporting MEV stealing in CSM on mainnet\n- Cancelling MEV stealing penalty if needed\n- Starting Easy Track motions to settle MEV stealing penalty\n- Setting and Resetting bond curves for particular CSM Node Operators (not adding new ones, only setting one of the existing ones)\n- Pausing CSM in case of emergency via Gate Seal\n\nThe committee multi-sig consists of two Lido contributors ([madlabman](https://x.com/chtotonet), [Remus](https://x.com/nameisremus)), one Lido Community Lifeguard ([enti](https://x.com/entigdd)) and 3 staking community representatives ([Lanski](https://x.com/Pol_Lanski), [Eridian](https://x.com/EridianAlpha), [POSTHUMAN](https://x.com/ponimajushij)), with a signing threshold of 4/6. \n\n## Next steps\n\nCSM has already undergone smart contract audits conducted by [Ackee](https://ackee.xyz/) and [MixBytes](https://mixbytes.io/). The final reports on the audit results are anticipated and will be published on the research forum once they are ready. Concurrently, CSM is undergoing an internal security review. \n\nIf this vote is approved, on-chain voting will take place after all audits and security checks have been successfully completed.\n\n## **What does approval of the snapshot mean?**\n\nApproval of the snapshot means approval of the following items:\n\n- Usage of the current Community Staking Module implementation for the mainnet deployment\n- CSM deployment [parameters](https://research.lido.fi/t/community-staking-module/5917/55)\n- Delegation of the several management responsibilities to the CSM committee multi-sig",

      "content": "## Tl;Dr\n\nThis proposal suggests updating the Easy Track limits for two multi-signature addresses in LCG (Lido Contributors Group) to reflect changes in PML’s and ATC’s funding needs and token redistribution. The proposal includes reducing the PML limit from 6M to 4M USDC/USDT/DAI per quarter, while increasing the ATC limit from 1.5M to 7M USDC/USDT/DAI per quarter. These changes aim to align on-chain security constraints with operational needs.\n\n## Limits Change\n\nTo support the goals set by the Continuity Grant Funding initiative ([**[EGG] st2024 v2: Continuity Grant Funding to Achieve GOOSE Goals**](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x2baf3275d15a8494ff94fef58d93bedd2fc28bfea8519f7e86474fc72dc25076)) and future initiatives, and due to the redistribution of token flows, it is proposed to change the Easy Track limits as follows:\n\n- **PML (Pool Maintenance Labs Ltd.)**: Decrease **from 6M to 4M** USDC/USDT/DAI per quarter\n    - AllowedRecipientsRegistry: [`0xDFfCD3BF14796a62a804c1B16F877Cf7120379dB`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xDFfCD3BF14796a62a804c1B16F877Cf7120379dB)\n- **ATC (Argo Technology Consulting Ltd)**: Increase **from 1.5M to 7M** USDC/USDT/DAI per quarter\n    - AllowedRecipientsRegistry: [`0xe07305F43B11F230EaA951002F6a55a16419B707`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe07305F43B11F230EaA951002F6a55a16419B707)\n\n## Motivation\n\nThese limits were initially proposed during the deployment of factories with limits in November 2022 ([link](https://research.lido.fi/t/new-easy-track-motion-setups-with-limits-rcc-pml-atc-gas-funder-lego-rewards-with-limits/3264)). Since then, necessary expenditures have grown and shifted between entities. \n\nIt is important to note that Easy Track limits are primarily on-chain constraints, while actual funding via grants is approved by the DAO through separate Snapshot votes (e.g. [[EGG] st2024 v2: Continuity Grant Funding to Achieve GOOSE Goals](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x2baf3275d15a8494ff94fef58d93bedd2fc28bfea8519f7e86474fc72dc25076), [[EGG] st2024 v1 Lido Contributors Group request for grant funding to advance GOOSE goals](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x41a47f0735b7aca8c1e7f93fae86a82f5c3fac8796657d2e95e63b1aa6d09c52))\n\n## Next steps\n\nIf this proposal is supported by the DAO, these actions will be included in one of the upcoming on-chain votes.",

      "title": "Increase the Proposal Threshold for Snapshot",
      "content": "tl;dr\nThis proposal seeks to increase the Snapshot proposal threshold to 5,000 ~ 15,000 LDO to prevent spam and encourage higher-quality submissions.\n\n# Introduction\nLido DAO uses Snapshot to gather initial community consensus and serves as the source of truth for proposals that do not require on-chain execution. Given the relatively low stakes of Snapshot proposals, the platform currently has a lower threshold for proposal submission than on-chain governance.\n\nOver time, Lido DAO has adjusted its proposal threshold 2 to adapt to changing circumstances. However, the current low threshold invites a high volume of low-quality and potentially harmful proposals.\n\nCurrent Proposal threshold.\n\nBased on current market conditions, Lido DAO’s Snapshot threshold stands at 1,000 LDO, equivalent to approximately $1,138.37.\n\nComparatively:\n\nENS DAO requires 10,000 ENS tokens (≈ USD 186,785.40)\nUniswap DAO requires 10,000 UNI tokens. (≈ USD 68,647.89 )\nAave DAO - 1,600 AAVE (≈ USD 269,315.90)\n1inch DAO - 100,000 1INCH (≈USD 29,584.84)\nTherefore, Lido DAO has one of the lowest proposal thresholds in decentralised governance, making it vulnerable to spammy proposals that could disrupt governance and distract the community.\n\n# Specifications\nTo mitigate the risks associated with spam and low-quality proposals, we propose increasing the Snapshot proposal threshold to 10,000 LDO. This increase will offer several key benefits:\n\nReduce Spam: Raising the threshold increases the financial stake required to submit proposals, discouraging spam and malicious actors from flooding the system with poor-quality proposals.\nEncourage Higher-Quality Proposals: A higher threshold will encourage those submitting proposals to consider their impact carefully, fostering more severe and thoughtful discussions within the community.\nBy setting the threshold at 5,000 ~ 15,000 LDO, the DAO will balance maintaining broad community participation and ensuring that only serious proposals are considered.\n\nThe increased threshold might initially exclude a very extreme minority of stakeholders and delegates from posting proposals. However, the DAO operations workstream has a process in place to carefully vet and support minority authors. This process ensures that all serious proposals are considered regardless of the author’s financial stake.\n\n# Alternative Considerations\nIn our review, no alternative solutions fully aligned with the ethos of decentralisation without introducing potential censorship. However, the following alternatives were considered:\n\nIncreased Snapshot Admin Rights: This would grant the DAO operations workstream more direct administrative control over Snapshot, allowing them to remove spammy proposals. Currently, only one address holds ‘Admin’ rights on the platform. Expanding this access could allow for more effective proposal moderation.\nWhitelisted Authorship: A more centralised approach, allowing only a whitelisted group of trusted authors to submit proposals. While this ensures higher-quality proposals, it also restricts broader community participation. However, Lido DAO already follows voting seasons where mature proposals are bundled and voted on together, which may reduce concerns about exclusion.\n\n# Voting Options\nIncrease threshold to 5,000 LDO\nIncrease threshold to 10,000 LDO\nIncrease threshold to 15,000 LDO\nDo nothing\nAbstain",

      "title": "Should Galaxy continue in the Curated Module set following the acquisition of CryptoManufaktur?",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nIn July, it was announced that [Galaxy had acquired CryptoManufaktur](https://www.galaxy.com/newsroom/galaxy-expands-blockchain-infrastructure-capabilities-asset-acquisition-crypto-manufaktur/) and communicated it to the [community via the Lido research forums](https://research.lido.fi/t/no-cryptomanufaktur-is-now-part-of-galaxy/7866). As there is no formal process through which mergers and acquisitions of node operators are considered, a discussion on the forums of how to potentially consider the matter (including if there is any reason to act in an immediate fashion to pause or stop the node operator), as well as a historical review of previous instances took place. The result of the discussion was that the community and Lido Node Operator Subgovernance Group ([LNOSG](https://operatorportal.lido.fi)) did not see any reason to object to Galaxy staying on in the Curated Module as the successor to CryptoManufaktur. The matter being voted on is to formalize tokenholder acceptance of this proposal that “Galaxy should remain in the Curated Module”. At the time of the acquisition, CryptoManufaktur was an active Node Operator and still is (as “Galaxy”) at the time of writing the proposal. \n\n## Details\n\n> NOTE: Separately and independently to the matter at hand in this snapshot, an on-chain vote of an administrative nature also occurred, in which [the requested changes to the Node Operator name and reward address](https://research.lido.fi/t/node-operator-registry-name-reward-address-change/4170/26) to reflect the post-merger status has been [passed](https://vote.lido.fi/vote/178).\n> \n\nFollowing the announcement of the acquisition, two things took place:\n\n1) A historical review of previous instances of NO changes (details below)\n\nHistorically, these are the changes that have happened in the Curated Set:\n\n- Certus One was acquired (infra+team) by Jump Crypto [Quant Shop Jump Trading Buys Blockchain Firm Certus One - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/quant-shop-jump-capital-buys-blockchain-engineer-firm-certus-one). Post merger, the operator did not add additional keys and eventually [exited the active set](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-dao-proposal-to-set-targetvalidatorscount-for-jump-crypto-operator-to-0-to-wind-down-the-jump-crypto-legacy-set/5259).\n- [Blockdaemon acquired (infra+team) Anyblock Analytics](https://research.lido.fi/t/anyblock-analytics-and-blockdaemon-merger-short-term-and-long-term-actions/1425) at a time when both Node Operators had already joined the Curated Set. As a result, the two operators were “merged” in the node operator registry by essentially pausing deposits in Anyblock Analytics (so new validators would only be going to Blockdaemon infra) and [then prioritizing exits and eventually deprecating](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-dao-proposal-to-set-targetvalidatorscount-for-anyblock-analytics-operator-to-0-to-consolidate-operations-to-blockdaemon-account/4625) and [deactivating the latter operator](https://research.lido.fi/t/disable-inactive-node-operators-anyblock-analytics-jump-crypto-in-curated-node-operator-registry/6077) registry entry.\n- [Prysmatic Labs (infra+team) were acquired by Offchain labs](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/12/arbitrum-builder-offchain-labs-acquires-prysmatic-labs-a-core-team-behind-ethereums-merge/). Prysmatic Labs are a bit of a special case in that they are a client team, but even so there was no change in the people running the validator infrastructure using Lido on Ethereum, nor how the infrastructure was being run.\n\n2) A discussion around the formation of a first-principles approach to consider the impact and decision-making criteria of an NO merger/acquisition. The following suggestions were put forth:\n\n- it could be assessed whether, as a result of the business deal, there are material changes to validators’ operations (different people / different infra)\n- it could be assessed whether, as a result of the business deal, there are material changes to the organizational structure and “meta-properties” of the node operator (e.g. impact on geographic and jurisdictional dispersion of the operator set)\n\nIn the cases of substantial change in either or both of the above, community members and tokenholders may want to consider whether to:\n\n- ask the LNOSG (or anyone else) to conduct an appraisal similar to that during onboarding rounds and offer an opinion, after which it could vote on whether the operator in its new form should remain in the curated set (or a secondary option should be explored), and/or\n- directly move to pause (i.e., disable the allocation of new validators) or stop (exit and deactivate) the operator.\n\nThe responses from the Node Operator were as follows (the first response from Thorsten Behrens of CryptoManufaktur):\n\n> The infra for the validators remains as-is. I am hearing you that any material change (e.g. moving into cloud instead of baremetal) needs to be discussed with the DAO first. I don’t foresee such a change.\n> \n> \n> The people running the validators remain as-is for now. There will be a change in the medium term:\n> \n> - We intend to train Galaxy staff on our operations and add them to the maintenance/escalation rotation\n> \n> The geographic distribution of the nodes remains as-is. For reference, we are in EMEA and APAC, an have no plans to move the infra. This, too, would require a discussion with the DAO before making any material changes.\n> \n> The jurisdictional location of the operator remains as-is as far as I know, but I’ll let Galaxy chime in on it\n> \n> - The headquarters are in the US, no change there from CMF\n> - Galaxy has offices in Europe, Asia and Canada - I do not know whether this impacts jurisdiction, or jurisdiction is strictly at HQ\n\nThe second response was by Zane from Galaxy.\n\n> We’re beyond excited to bring Thorsten and his excellent team into Galaxy. I’m happy to shed additional light on the acquisition and plans for the future.\n> \n> \n> **1. As a result of our deal, confirming there are no planned material changes to existing validator operations.** As Thorsten mentioned above, the goal is to preserve and further support CMF’s Ethereum staking operations – same team, same infrastructure set-up, same commitment to participating in the Curated and Simple-DVT modules and other strategic NO initiatives.\n> \n> **2. Also confirming there are no planned material changes to the organizational structure of the NO.** Galaxy will be keeping legacy CMF operations intact – including set-up from a geographical / jurisdictional perspective. Galaxy, while headquartered in the US, is truly global with entities and offices across North America, Europe and Asia, and so will extend CMF’s ability to deliver services where required jurisdictionally.\n> \n> Our goal is to further improve the provisioning of said NO services over time, with additional maintenance, business continuity + redundancy measures afforded by Galaxy’s globally-distributed engineering, networking, and operational support teams.\n> \n> We absolutely agree that CMF’s Ethereum and Lido community impact have been exemplary, and thus view this acquisition as a means of pushing Thorsten and the team’s contributions even further. Galaxy’s plan is to take the non-blockchain work off of Thorsten’s plate, so that he can spend more of his valuable time assisting with core development and strategic initiatives.\n> \n> We view the acquisition of CMF as (1) a means of accelerating our technical capabilities, especially in the Ethereum staking space, and (2) a show of Galaxy’s commitment to the development of the blockchain infrastructure ecosystem at large. We are working on developing best-in-class enterprise-grade (and certified) infrastructure for the largest institutions with Thorsten + team’s help, while also celebrating Thorsten’s commitment to the EthStaker / solo-staker community\n> \n\nThe LNOSG, having considered the above plus some internal discussion and additional questions to Galaxy, [opined that](https://research.lido.fi/t/no-cryptomanufaktur-is-now-part-of-galaxy/7866/7) “the general consensus (with no objections) was that it suggests to the DAO that Galaxy Digital continue to participate in the Curated module.”\n\n## Proposal Actions\n\nThis proposal seeks tokenholder opinion on the suggestion that Galaxy remain in the Curated Module as a Node Operator following the acquisition of CryptoManufaktur.\n\n- A vote “For” indicates agreement with this proposal. If “For” wins, then essentially nothing in the status quo changes, and Galaxy continues to be an active NO in the Curated Module.\n- A vote “Against” indicates disagreement with this proposal. As the range of options of disagreement is very large, a vote “Against” entails that a discussion should take place to identify which possible options should be considered and brought to a following vote. These options may range from:\n    - Setting a Target Limit to the Node Operator at their current active key count such that they do not receive new deposits pending further discussion\n    - Deactivating the Node Operator (no more new deposits + no rewards) pending further discussion/analysis\n    - Deactivating the Node Operator (no more new deposits + no rewards) and eventually removing the Node Operator from the Curated Module registry",

      "title": "Organize the Lido Alliance Program as a Lido-DAO-Adjacent BORG",
      "content": "## **Summary**\n\nFollowing the approval of the [Lido Alliance Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xd70197783e2a5ce8d32ab2021ee08c21d12fc3e7f7e942b8cdd6aa3f6edb029a) in May, Lido DAO contributors have worked with [MetaLeX](https://www.metalex.tech/) to **propose the creation of a LIDO Alliance workgroup, including through the incorporation of a Lido-DAO-adjacent cybernetic organization (BORG)** to “legally wrap” the “Alliance workgroup” and the related assets and activities.\n\nThe Lido Alliance BORG Foundation consists of a memberless, beneficiary-less Cayman foundation whose purposes are restricted to furthering the Alliance Program, including submitting or facilitating the proposal of worthwhile Lido DAO Allies to Lido DAO and owning and holding assets contributed by such Lido DAO Allies in onchain multisigs.\n\n[The Bylaws and other legal docs](https://github.com/MetaLex-Tech/publicDocs/tree/main/Lido-Alliance-BORG/coreDocs/coreDocs-08-20-24/pdfs) of the Lido Alliance BORG Foundation provide for legal checks-and-balances between the entity and Lido DAO (explained below).\n\nTo complement the legal check-and-balance mechanisms expressed in the Lido Alliance BORG’s legal documents, the multisigs for holding the Lido Alliance BORG’s operational budget will use [Easy Track](https://docs.lido.fi/guides/easy-track-guide/) — which gives Lido DAO an onchain veto over spending of these assets. The assets contributed by Lido Allies will be subject to legal checks-and-balances with the DAO and held in a transparent 4/7 multisigs staffed by the BORG Personnel. The BORG personnel hope to eventually transition these multisigs to MetaLeX’s forthcoming technology stack to provide a more full-featured set of onchain checks-and-balances mirroring the prescribed legal arrangements.\n\nThis proposal seeks to inform Lido DAO and the broader Lido community of the details of the Lido Alliance BORG and to obtain a signal of the Lido DAO’s support for the structure through an approval of the proposal. If the proposal is approved, the Lido Alliance BORG will be incorporated as described herein. More details regarding BORGs and legal aspects around them can be found in [Motivation and Implementation sections of the original proposal at the research forum](https://research.lido.fi/t/organize-the-lido-alliance-program-as-a-lido-dao-adjacent-borg/8173#p-17171-motivation-3).\n\n## Detailed Proposal\n\nThe Lido Alliance BORG is requesting an initial budget of **$125,000** for 2024, as part of the [st2024 v2 EGG](https://research.lido.fi/t/egg-st2024-v2-continuity-grant-funding-to-achieve-goose-goals/) request approved in July and is expected to require a yearly budget of **$250,000** from 2025 to operate, which will be requested through subsequent EGG requests. The budget includes director fees, local law firm fees, contributor compensation and any other operational expenses, following the [EGG budget requests framework](https://research.lido.fi/t/ecosystem-grants-grequest-egg-a-budget-request-framework-in-the-service-of-goose/). For every new EGG request, a retro review of the last EGG spend for the Alliance BORG will also be included. \n\nThe Board of Directors of the BORG is responsible for running all aspects of the Lido Alliance program and is in charge of the BORG overall. The Directors must sit on all multisigs of the BORG. The initial Directors of the BORG would initially be [adcv](https://research.lido.fi/u/adcv/summary) and [Hillstone](https://research.lido.fi/u/hillstone/summary) of [steakhouse](https://research.lido.fi/u/steakhouse/summary). Any future Directors would be approved by Lido DAO and the Board. An individual Director can be removed either by the Board itself or by Lido DAO. An individual Director may also unilaterally resign.\n\nThe Guardians of the BORG are additional members of the BORG’s multisigs appointed by the Board. They generally should follow the Board’s instructions but may refuse to sign a multisig transaction based on security or compliance considerations.

The initial supervisor, intended to be temporary, is MetaLeX Pro LLC, the same law firm that led the creation of the BORG in consultation with various Lido contributors. This role is currently un-compensated and MetaLeX has committed to perform the role without additional compensation for up to three months. The final supervisor is expected to be a “Lido OpsBORG” or similar entity, which is currently in ideation phase and will be separately proposed to Lido DAO once various details are finalized.\n\nIf an “Adverse Event” occurs, Lido DAO may directly appoint an “Emergency Supervisor” for the BORG. “Adverse Event” is defined to include egregious violations of law or the BORG’s own rules by the BORG or BORG Personnel in connection with the BORG’s activities, certain crimes independently committed by BORG Personnel (whether or not related to the BORG’s activities), and sustained deadlocks within the BORG’s governance/decision-making. The Emergency Supervisor would have broad powers under the BORG’s Bylaws and Caymans law, including the power to investigate the Adverse Event, bring lawsuits against BORG personnel in the name of the BORG and to remove and appoint Directors. The Emergency Supervisor role is intended to be temporary and the Emergency Supervisor must resign once the Adverse Event is handled or, in any event, the Emergency Supervisor’s tenure is automatically terminated after 12 months if not renewed by Lido DAO. Lido DAO also has the power to directly set the compensation of Emergency Supervisors.\n\nThe BORG Personnel are indemnified by the BORG entity, within certain customary limits. This indemnification would be paid solely out of operating funds and not any of the Lido-Ally-contributed assets, unless Lido DAO approves to use additional funds of the BORG to indemnify the BORG personnel who acted on behalf of the BORG.\n\nThe BORG Personnel would not have personal liability to the BORG for their BORG-related activities except to the extent they engage in gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud.\n\nThe BORG Personnel must satisfy various eligibility criteria including not being subject to sanctions, not having previous egregious criminal convictions, and being reasonably sophisticated regarding blockchain technologies.\n\n## **Voting**\n\n> ***Note:*** The Lido Alliance program has already been approved by the Lido DAO. \n\nThis proposal requests the following:\n\n- Recognition of the DAO adjacent BORG structure of the Lido Alliance program with its many check and balance mechanisms including, but not limited to, setting up on-chain tooling of the operational multisig (configuration above) to enable DAO vetoes\n- Approval of the initial budget to operate the Lido Alliance BORG\n\nBy voting Approve, you indicate support for funding and operating the Lido Alliance BORG as described herein.\n\nBy voting Reject, you indicate you do not support funding and operating the Lido Alliance BORG as described herein.",

Introducing a canonical, community approved wstETH to BNB chain will reduce friction in adoption and ultimately enhance growth for the token as well as for the Lido DAO.  \n\n# Audits\n\n- [WstEthL2Token Cyfrin Audit Report](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-wormhole-axelar-wsteth/blob/main/audits/2024-06-10-cyfrin-audit-2024-06-wormhole-axelar-wsteth-l2token.pdf)\n- Wormhole Native Token Transfers (NTT), including Wormhole Transceiver\n    -

      "title": "Should the Lido DAO recognize the wstETH Bridge Endpoints on Mode as canonical?",
      "content": "The proposal is to recognize the wstETH token bridging endpoints for Mode by the Lido DAO as canonical. If Snapshot passes, the Lido DAO will control the endpoints of wstETH token contract (including the token contract on Mode itself) as a proxy admin. Lido DAO will only have the upgrade authority of the wstETH proxy contract, and will not be able to manage the native bridge itself.\n\nThe Mode Team is submitting this proposal to the community for the deployment of wstETH on Mode.\n\n### Motivation\n\nwstETH has already been deployed to Optimism and Base, two of the biggest L2s that are also in the Superchain. The Mode core team suggests that it is strategically beneficial for the Lido DAO to also consider Mode as the next ecosystem to deploy their token.\nMode has received support from Optimism in the form of an OP grant worth 2 million OP.\nAs a key token, wstETH plays a vital role in DeFi activities across network segments.\n\nThe proposal aims to enhance wstETH adoption on Mode by signaling the Lido DAO’s recognition of the bridge endpoints.\n\n## Audits\n\nTo better form an opinion you may consider reading through the audit reports for:\n\n- [Governance crosschain bridges (OptimismBridgeExecutor)](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits/blob/main/L2/Governance-Crosschain-Bridges-2022-08-Oxorio-Audit%20Report.pdf)\n- [wstETH token bridge (L1ERC20TokenBridge, ERC20Bridged, L2ERC20TokenBridge)](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits/blob/main/L2/Lido-L2-2022-07-Oxorio-Smart-Contracts-Security-Audit-Report.pdf)\n- [Mainnet verification report](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits/blob/main/L2/Mode-2024-07-18-Cantina-wstETH-deployment-verification.pdf)\n\n## Deployment artifacts and levers setup\n\nThe deployment is done using the exact codebase previously used for wstETH on Optimism and wstETH on Base bridge endpoints as the Mode network is OP-stack compatible. \n\n### Deployments on Mainnet (L1) and Mode (L2):\n\n- OptimismBridgeExecutor on L2: [0x2aCeC6D8ABA90685927b61968D84CfFf6192B32C](https://explorer.mode.network/address/0x2aCeC6D8ABA90685927b61968D84CfFf6192B32C?tab=contract) (Ethereum to Mode decisions forwarder for the Lido DAO Agent)\n- L1ERC20TokenBridge on L1 (proxy): [0xD0DeA0a3bd8E4D55170943129c025d3fe0493F2A](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD0DeA0a3bd8E4D55170943129c025d3fe0493F2A#readContract) (Ethereum token bridge part for wstETH)\n    - L1ERC20TokenBridge on L1 (implementation): [0xE6A4ED59Ec73eD78aE3A10294c99F0EE18A6bF76](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE6A4ED59Ec73eD78aE3A10294c99F0EE18A6bF76)\n- ERC20Bridged on L2 (proxy): [0x98f96A4B34D03a2E6f225B28b8f8Cb1279562d81](https://explorer.mode.network/address/0x98f96A4B34D03a2E6f225B28b8f8Cb1279562d81) (Mode representation for wstETH proposed as the canonical one)\n    - ERC20Bridged on L2 (implementation): [0xF27b1B121e55A13047d66dC4AAA8c17BA72c762A](https://explorer.mode.network/address/0xF27b1B121e55A13047d66dC4AAA8c17BA72c762A)\n- L2ERC20TokenBridge on L2 (proxy): [0xb8161F28a5a38cE58f155D9A96bDAc0104985FAc](https://explorer.mode.network/address/0xb8161F28a5a38cE58f155D9A96bDAc0104985FAc) (Mode token bridge part for wstETH)\n    - L2ERC20TokenBridge on L2 (implementation): [0x488cDB57E9a1006ab77730fC8b19e1BB76e1cB97](https://explorer.mode.network/address/0x488cDB57E9a1006ab77730fC8b19e1BB76e1cB97)\n\n### Levers setup:\n\n- OptimismBridgeExecutor\n    - [getEthereumBridgeExecutor](https://explorer.mode.network/address/0x2aCeC6D8ABA90685927b61968D84CfFf6192B32C?tab=read_contract#c3a76886) is the [Lido DAO Agent (admin)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c#code)\n- Ultimate admin and role holder on L1 is the [Lido DAO Agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c#code)\n    - Proxy admin for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_ENABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_ENABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n- Ultimate admin and role holder on L2 is the [OptimismBridgeExecutor](https://explorer.mode.network/address/0x2aCeC6D8ABA90685927b61968D84CfFf6192B32C?tab=read_contract)\n    - Proxies admin for ERC20Bridged, L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_ENABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_ENABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n- Emergency breaks on L1 uses this EOA account [0x73b047fe6337183A454c5217241D780a932777bD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x73b047fe6337183A454c5217241D780a932777bD)\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n- Emergency breaks msig on L2 is a newly created one [0x244912352A639001ceCFa208cDaa7CB474c9eadE](https://safe.optimism.io/home?safe=mode:0x244912352A639001ceCFa208cDaa7CB474c9eadE)\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge",

      "title": "LIP-25: Staking Router 2.0",
      "content": "The proposal for Lido Staking Router 2.0 (SR) upgrade includes improvements to both on- and off-chain parts of the following components:\n\n- the Deposit Security Module (DSM)\n- the Validator Exit Bus Oracle (VEBO)\n- the Accounting Oracle (AO)\n- and reward distribution mechanisms in curated-based staking router modules.\n\nIf the DAO approves it, the new SR upgrade will be included in the further on-chain vote to be applied to the Lido protocol. Off-chain parts needed to support on-chain changes will be deployed just before the on-chain vote.\n\n## TL;DR\n\nLido ValSet stream contributors propose to improve the Staking Router in multiple ways: \n* automate key vetting and unvetting (the process of ensuring only safely depositable keys are under limit) and handling of cases such as incorrect signatures, duplicate keys, and deposits front-run within Deposit Security Module; \n* allow staking router modules to signal Validator Exit Bus Oracle to exit validators independently of withdrawal requests using a new boosted exit mode; \n* adjust validator exit prioritization to account for each module’s target share for Validator Exit Bus Oracle; \n* and scale reporting and decouple reward distribution for Accounting Oracle 3rd phase report.\n\nIt is proposed to change on-chain contracts and off-chain parts of the Staking Router.\n\n## Motivation\n\n1. In the current implementation of the curated Staking Router modules, key vetting (the process of validating keys before making them depositable) occurs through DAO actions, and in particular Easy Track motions, which operators may initiate after submitting keys or via full on-chain DAO votes. The proposed DSM changes aim to improve the process of key vetting to be able to work without requiring governance approval and to accommodate future permissionless modules\n2. The current VEBO mechanism only processes validator exits in response to user withdrawal requests. This limitation hinders the protocol’s ability to manage validator exits proactively, especially for future permissionless modules (like Community Staking Module), and thus an improvement is proposed to allow for exits for reasons other than withdrawal requests. From the Staking Router side, it is also proposed to consider a module’s share exceeding some threshold when prioritizing (ordering) validators for exit.\n3. The introduction of the Community Staking Module, which does not limit the number of node operators, necessitates a scalable solution for the Accounting Oracle’s third phase report.\n4. Current reward distribution mechanisms, tied to the third phase Accounting Oracle finalization hook, risk exceeding block gas limits and complicate the reporting process, so an improvement is proposed to add permissionless on-chain method to handle reward distribution independently of Accounting Oracle’s third-phase report.\n\nResearch forum post with more details can be found [here](https://research.lido.fi/t/lip-25-staking-router-v2-0/7773)\n\nThe contract specification details can be found in the [LIP-25](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-25.md).\n\n## Next steps\n\n- [MixBytes](https://mixbytes.io/) and [Ackee](https://ackee.xyz/) teams are conducting the smart contract audits and deploy verification for the upgrade. Also MixBytes will be auditing the off-chain Oracle code. Once finalized, the reports will be published on the Research forum.\n- If this snapshot vote is approved, the on-chain voting will occur after all audits and security checks successfully completed. An improved Staking Router 2.0 will be applied to the protocol with all the proposed changes.",

If Rated Labs is replaced by MatrixedLink, the balance between Curated NOs and other parties in the Oracle set will not change.\n\nMatrixedLink currently successfully operates Ethereum validators within the [Lido Simple DVT module](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/simple-dvt-module) on mainnet.

That is why MatrixedLink already participated in testnets and is familiar with the requirements of maintaining the oracle infrastructure. \n\nThis proposal offers **two options** for tokenholders: \n\n1. to rotate Rated Labs for MatrixedLink in the Accounting Oracle and Validator Exit Bus Oracle contracts (and keep the quorum as is, 5/9), or \n2. to remove Rated Labs from the Oracle set (and change the required quorum from 5/9 to 5/8).\n\nIn case the DAO approves this snapshot, the next step will be on-chain voting for \n- in case Option 1. passes, execution of the oracles rotation, or\n- in case Option 2. passes, removing Rated from the Oracle set.",

      "title": "Appoint Entity to Respond to Pending Class Action Litigation Against Lido DAO ",
      "content": "## Background\n\nOn April 3, 2024, a class-action lawsuit by a private plaintiff was filed in Case No. 3:23-cv-06492 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Complaint”), naming “LIDO DAO, a general partnership,” as a defendant.\n\nIn the Complaint, Lido DAO is alleged to be a “general partnership” which “runs an Ethereum staking business,” and LDO tokens or transactions in LDO tokens are alleged to be securities or securities transactions that Lido DAO is alleged to offer or sell to the public in violation of securities laws.\n\nOn June 27th, the court held that Lido DAO had been properly served legal process regarding the Complaint through various public postings made by the plaintiffs and has 14 days to respond or risk a default judgment on the plaintiffs’ claims. Although various venture capital funds are also named defendants in the Complaint, none are responding as or on behalf of Lido DAO, and in fact they are denying they are part of Lido DAO. Thus, the risk of a default judgment against Lido DAO is real if a response is not filed by “Lido DAO”.\n\nLido DAO has never characterized itself as a partnership, unincorporated association or other legal entity, and lacks many of the common features of a partnership (such as the alleged ‘partners’ knowing who one another are and a sharing of the profits and losses of an enterprise). There is no partnership agreement or other legal document providing for explicit mechanisms for Lido DAO to appear in or appoint a representative in a litigation. Nevertheless, because Lido DAO is alleged to be such an entity (specifically, a general partnership) in this complaint, Lido DAO tokenholders should pass this vote to enable someone to argue that Lido DAO has not been and cannot be served properly, is not a general partnership or other legal entity, is not a proper defendant to this lawsuit, and that the case should be dismissed.\n\nAccordingly, this proposal, without admitting and expressly disagreeing that Lido DAO is a partnership, association or other legally cognizable group or entity, is to appoint and fund Dolphin CL, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Dolphin”) to engage legal counsel (currently expected to be Brown Rudnick, led by partner Stephen Palley) and make a limited appearance as “Lido DAO” in the aforementioned case and, without admitting jurisdiction of the court or any other adverse legal fact (including but not limited to the notion that Lido DAO is a legal person), make all necessary or desirable legal arguments to cause the case to be dismissed against Lido DAO on any grounds deemed reasonable, appropriate and non-prejudicial by Dolphin and its counsel. The requested funding is 200,000 DAI, which is expected to be sufficient to pay Dolphin and its legal counsel for services sufficient to draft, file and argue in favor of a motion to dismiss the Complaint as it pertains to Lido DAO.\n\n## Risks\nThere are two types of risks relating to the proposal:\n1. Risk of Not Passing the Proposal.\nIf “Lido DAO” does not make filings in the case, there is a risk the court will enter a default judgment against “Lido DAO” due to no response to the Complaint being filed. While the ultimate implications of this would be unclear (in part because the legal status of ‘Lido DAO’ is unclear), in a recent case by the CFTC against Ooki DAO, the CFTC obtained a court order for the collection of damages from Ooki DAO and ordering “any third party providing web-hosting or domain-name registration services to shut down the Ooki DAO’s website and remove its content from the internet,” which has resulted in successful takedowns of Ooki-DAO-related web2 infra.\nOn the other hand, a default judgment likely cannot be entered until the case is fully concluded against all parties, and the other parties to the litigation–if they are not dismissed from the case per their motions–would presumably continue litigating in their own defense for some time, even if Lido DAO does not appear to defend itself. However and even though those defendants have an excellent track record of supporting the blockchain industry, none of them are responding to the case as if they are part of Lido DAO, and due to potentially conflicting fiduciary duties there can be no guarantee their arguments will be crafted toward sustainability of Lido DAO and the systems it governs, versus being tailored to eliminate their own likelihood of liability or garnering an early dismissal of themselves from the case while leaving Lido DAO itself as a defendant.\nIf a default judgment is ultimately entered against Lido DAO, we cannot predict whether the court would enter similar orders in this case to those in Ooki DAO (one notable difference is that the plaintiffs here are class-action attorneys, not a government agency), but it is a material risk–particularly if the default judgment is weaponized to cause third parties to deny Lido-DAO-related access to web2 infrastructure, to delist LDO from trading venues, etc.\nFurthermore, third-parties could seek to use a default judgment against Lido DAO or other parties in other legal actions. This can occur via the doctrine of res judicata or non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel which has sometimes been used by the SEC and other regulators. These doctrines are complex so it is not guaranteed they will apply–for example, it could be argued that “Lido DAO” lacks a fair opportunity to litigate here or that the remedies are sufficiently different that res judicata principles would not apply. But a court may ultimately disagree and may apply such doctrines adversely to Lido DAO.\nGenerally, a default judgment is a potential attack vector against Lido DAO and the systems it governs. While there may be various counterattacks to the judgment at various stages, and enforcing the judgment may be difficult for the plaintiffs, it is better if the attack vector does not materialize in the first place.\n\n2. Risks of Passing the Proposal.\nThe main risk of passing the proposal is that the claimant in this case might try to build an argument that Lido DAO is capable of being a litigant and therefore should be viewed as legal person that can ultimately suffer an adverse judgment. However, in the Ooki DAO case, the Ooki DAO took the strategy of having no one appear for the DAO, and this fact in itself did not help Ooki DAO—it was still deemed to be a cognizable legal person and still suffered a default judgment and had critical web2 infra dismantled by government orders levied against third parties.\nA second general risk is that if Lido DAO appears and is not dismissed from the case, Lido DAO will face additional expenses and risks as the litigation proceeds. By contrast, if no response is entered for Lido DAO and the other defendants are not dismissed, the other defendants may keep litigating the case and Lido DAO could ‘free ride’ on their efforts to some extent (albeit there is no guarantee their arguments will be optimal for Lido DAO).\n\n## About Dolphin CL, LLC\nEntity Name: Dolphin CL, LLC\nEntity Type: Limited liability company\nJurisdiction: Delaware\n\n## About Brown Rudnick/Stephen Palley\n\nStephen Palley is a litigation partner and co-chair of Brown Rudnick’s Digital Commerce group and leads its Digital Assets disputes practice.

      "title": "Proposal: The Decentralized Validator Vault",
      "content": "The below proposal follows the [discussion post created on June 20th 2024](https://research.lido.fi/t/discussion-the-decentralized-validator-vault/7729).\n\nThis proposal seeks DAO support for the implementation of a vault solution by the [Lido Alliance member Mellow](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x9cf59093a927afe5ebd860a46aaeb92e67ff980168d95dce4c0fe2d5d46d2e68) that would be used to serve as a focal point for user stakes and DVT incentives.\n\nVoting for this proposal would mean that:\n\n1. The Mellow team would be responsible for the implementation of a vault that accepts ETH and stakes it to the Lido protocol with the goal of driving net-new stakes to the Simple DVT Module;\n2. 90% of potential future Obol contributions and SSV mainnet incentives (both calculated off-chain) will be allocated to the vault, with the remaining 10% allocated to the Node Operators in their corresponding SSV & Obol Simple DVT clusters. Any potential Mellow incentives would be directed to users of the vault;\n3. Cross-team coordination will take place to facilitate staking to the Simple DVT Module. Relevant data will be provided in support of off-chain contribution and incentive programs. \n\n## Background\n\nIn light of the [recently updated ReGOOSE goals](https://research.lido.fi/t/regoose-updated-goals-for-lido-in-the-light-of-mvi-and-restaking/7462), [Simple DVT Expansion proposal](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-expanding-the-simple-dvt-module/7549), and as discussed in the [Decentralized Validator Vault discussion post](https://research.lido.fi/t/discussion-the-decentralized-validator-vault/7729), a vault strategy can be implemented that will increase the pace of adoption of Distributed Validators via the Simple DVT Module.\n\nSince SSV Network’s mainnet launch, the protocol has seen significant success, partially boosted by its mainnet incentives program. Currently, SSV Network has 26,685 active validators representing over $2.9B of ETH staked. If the Snapshot vote is successful, a proposal to the SSV DAO will be shared to greenlight the allocation of Lido related SSV incentives in an off-chain format to the vault, with user eligibility following the format described below. \n\nIn the coming weeks, the Obol team plans to announce a contributions program in conjunction with their [1% for Decentralization retroactive funding initiative](https://blog.obol.tech/1-percent-for-decentralisation/). Stake that is deployed on Obol DVs will contribute 1% of their staking rewards to the retroactive fund. The expectation for Liquid Staking Protocols is that potential future Obol incentives will be allocated to stakers by taking into account the contributions made on the relevant staking platform.\n\nWithin Lido Simple DVT, [Obol clusters](https://research.lido.fi/t/staking-router-module-proposal-simple-dvt/5625/41) are about to start the process of scaling their validators while the [first SSV Network clusters](https://research.lido.fi/t/staking-router-module-proposal-simple-dvt/5625/38) are expected to go live in the coming weeks, with scaling to follow soon after.\n\nThe Snapshot vote for Expanding the Simple DVT Module [successfully passed through governance](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xaca2da3c932542e030db8bf5b6e4420bf4aa98bd57bd62b9b8008a4b7398abb2), and an on-chain Aragon vote to raise the share limit of the module to 4% is expected in the next two weeks. This proposal has also greenlit the creation of Super Simple DVT clusters, that would allow for quicker scaling of both Obol- and SSV-based DVT clusters via the Simple DVT Module over the next two months.\n\n## Proposal\n\nGiven the additional capacity soon to be available within the Simple DVT Module, the upcoming launch of Obol’s contributions program, and recent revamp of SSV’s incentive program, an opportunity has been presented that can 1. Quicken the adoption pace of DVT via the Simple DVT module, leading to a more [secure, resilient, and decentralized](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-expanding-the-simple-dvt-module/7549/9) Node Operator set and 2. Drive net-new stake to the protocol.\n\nThis opportunity can be capitalised on by implementing what would be called the Decentralized Validator Vault, implemented by the Mellow team. The Mellow team has indicated that they can provide the proposed solution in a timely manner that is integrated into the Mellow front-end, allowing for Lido community members to access the vault.\n\nThe vault strategy would offer capital allocators (stakers) the ability to stake ETH or WETH into the vault. This (W)ETH would be staked via Lido, with stakers earning the normal staking rewards from the protocol. 90% of the incentives generated via the Lido protocol Obol & SSV Network validators would be allocated to stakers of the vault, with the remaining 10% allocated to the Node Operators in their corresponding SSV & Obol Simple DVT clusters.\n\n## Why Do This?\n\nThe combination of the expansion of the Simple DVT Module, the launch of Obol’s contribution program, and re-work of SSV’s incentive program presents an opportunity for the DAO to increase the resilience of the Lido Node Operator set via DVT, drive a material amount of net-new stake into the protocol, and offer capital allocators access to incentives that they otherwise would not receive (as SSV & Obol incentives are based on running validators).\n\nWith the Simple DVT Module expanded to 4%, there will be capacity for 11,868 validators evenly split between Obol and SSV over the coming months. Excluding the 60 active validators running through Simple DVT currently, this suggests capacity for an incremental 377,856 ETH staked into the protocol to fill the capacity of the Simple DVT Module.\n\n## Vault Mechanics\n\n### Structure\n\nThe vault would be introduced by Mellow with one of the existing Mellow Curator teams, integrating functionality to drive stake to the Lido protocol and the ability to show monthly snapshots of the allocated points to individual stakers utilizing the vault.\n\nThe capacity of the vault would be controlled via the Mellow administrator, reflecting the current stakeable capacity of the Simple DVT Module, with an up to 10% additional buffer. These parameter changes would be communicated to Mellow when key limits of clusters within the Simple DVT Module are raised, as explained in the [Simple DVT Proposal](https://research.lido.fi/t/staking-router-module-proposal-simple-dvt/5625/1) and [Expansion Proposal](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-expanding-the-simple-dvt-module/7549/7).\n\n### Incentives Eligibility\n\nSimilar to the current [rewards share program](https://research.lido.fi/t/rewards-share-program-2024/6812), and in order to dissuade possibly deleterious effects to the protocol due to farming incentives, analysis would be conducted on vault stake. In order to be eligible to receive full vault incentives for the stake provided, stakers would need to:\n\n1. Hold a position for a minimum of 3 days in the vault through the conclusion of the Snapshot period.\n2. Not unstake existing stETH or wstETH that is then re-staked via the vault from the moment of vault launch. The incentives are calculated on the base of ETH staked to and persisting within the vault during the relevant snapshot period minus any stETH withdrawn after the launch of the vault.\n3. Not swap existing stETH on DEXs/CEXs: this condition does not expel a staker from all incentives, but reduce corresponding amount of stake provided by the volume of sold ETH. Similar to the above, the incentives would be calculated on the base of non-swapped ETH staked to and persisting within the vault during the relevant snapshot period.\n\nThe 10% of potential incentives for SDVT participants would be split evenly across respective Obol and SSV clusters, with each participant earning a share of any incentives from the provider who’s software they utilize based on the number of clusters they participate in.\n\n## Summary\n\nWith the expansion of the Simple DVT module imminent, it is an opportune time to consider utilizing both Obol and SSV’s mainnet contributions and incentivization programs to quicken the pace of DVT based validators being added to the protocol.\n\nThe vault strategy implemented by Mellow would allow for a faster flow of Simple DVT validators being activated, for capital allocators to access DVT provider incentives, and most importantly, hasten the pace that DVT is rolled out across the expanded Simple DVT Module, improving the resilience of Lido Node Operator set.",

      "title": "LIP-22: stETH on L2 — wstETH on Optimism bridge endpoints upgrade",
      "content": "## **Tl;dr**\n\nThe proposal seeks the Lido DAO support on the wstETH on Optimism bridge endpoints upgrade, implementing the architecture approach presented in [LIP-22: stETH on L2](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-22.md). If the DAO supports this snapshot vote, an upgrade for the previously deployed [wstETH on the Optimism](https://docs.lido.fi/deployed-contracts/#optimism) bridging endpoints will be included in the further on-chain vote for both wstETH (non-rebaseable) and stETH (rebaseable) tokens to be supported by the upgraded bridge endpoints version together with the necessary rebase delivery contracts. \n\nThe main idea is to achieve a token parity in the future (having both stETH and wstETH) on the top-tier L2s with Ethereum Mainnet, allowing the Optimism network to be a pilot carriage for this change.\n\n## Specification\n\nIt is proposed to update the following contracts deployed on Ethereum Mainnet and Optimism Mainnet:\n\n- L1ERC20TokenBridge: [`0x76943C0D61395d8F2edF9060e1533529cAe05dE6`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x76943C0D61395d8F2edF9060e1533529cAe05dE6) (proxy)\n- L2ERC20TokenBridge: [`0x8E01013243a96601a86eb3153F0d9Fa4fbFb6957`](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x8E01013243a96601a86eb3153F0d9Fa4fbFb6957) (proxy)\n- WstETH on Optimism: [`0x1F32b1c2345538c0c6f582fCB022739c4A194Ebb`](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x1F32b1c2345538c0c6f582fCB022739c4A194Ebb) (proxy)\n\nAnd deploy new contracts needed to deliver the token rebases:\n\n- [stETH on Optimism](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-l2-with-steth/blob/1f8bdf8f15200110513fafa3167fefe6acd80d1d/contracts/token/ERC20RebasableBridgedPermit.sol) (behind a proxy)\n- [TokenRateOracle](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-l2-with-steth/blob/1f8bdf8f15200110513fafa3167fefe6acd80d1d/contracts/optimism/TokenRateOracle.sol) (behind a proxy)\n- [TokenRateNotifier](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-l2-with-steth/blob/1f8bdf8f15200110513fafa3167fefe6acd80d1d/contracts/lido/TokenRateNotifier.sol)\n- [OpStackTokenRatePusher](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-l2-with-steth/blob/1f8bdf8f15200110513fafa3167fefe6acd80d1d/contracts/optimism/OpStackTokenRatePusher.sol)\n\nLast but not least, the newly deployed [TokenRateNotifier](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-l2-with-steth/blob/1f8bdf8f15200110513fafa3167fefe6acd80d1d/contracts/lido/TokenRateNotifier.sol) will be proposed as the [`postTokenRebaseReceiver`](https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/lido-locator#posttokenrebasereceiver) instead of the discontinued [`LegacyOracle`](https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/legacy-oracle).\n\nThe contract specification details can be found in the [LIP-22: stETH on L2](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-22.md). \n\nThere are two audit reports available covering the same final commit of the implemented smart contracts:\n\n- Ackee Blockchain [Audit Report](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits?tab=readme-ov-file#06-2024-ackee-blockchain-steth-on-optimism-audit-report)\n- MixBytes [Audit Report](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits?tab=readme-ov-file#06-2024-mixbytes-steth-on-optimism-audit-report)\n\n## Motivation on wstETH vs stETH\n\nThe wstETH token has been successfully integrated on various L2s: Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, zkSync Era, Linea, and Mantle. It provides the ultimate ease for DeFi integrations by being a straightforward value-accruing token using the ‘lock-and-mint’ L1→L2 bridging approach. \n\nIn contrast to wstETH, stETH depends on the rate changes to recalculate each user’s balance (e.g., perform a [rebase](https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/lido#rebase)). There is an essential UX property: the stETH token balance represents the underlying Ether value expected to be redeemed 1:1 via the protocol upon a withdrawal request.\n\nBeyond just updating an account’s balance in the wallet, having rebaseable stETH on L2 hypothetically unlocks the following use cases and scenarios:\n\n- staking/withdrawal requests originated from L2s with accuracy accounting for the stETH rebases that occurred during the bridging period\n- performing gas payments in `stETH` with amounts corresponding to ether on rollups that opted in to support token gas payments (e.g., following the Account Abstraction)\n- cross-domain `stETH` deposits/withdrawals (L1 and L2s) for CEXes, custodians, and service providers to support L2s directly (DeFi interactions, deposits/withdrawals) as they can charge fees with each rebase while users still see their balance changing each day\n- once main routine user activity migrated from L1 to L2, there should be UX available as it was previously (rebaseable token)\n\n## Optimism implementation as a pilot\n\nRecently, Optimism [adopted](https://x.com/Optimism/status/1800256837088145799) a permissionless fault-proof system, reaching [Stage 1](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe) of the rollup security model. For details, see the updated [Optimism assessment](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/optimism) on L2Beat. This indicates that the Optimism network implements a strong security baseline and is committed to moving toward further decentralization. The latter provides a strong argument to consider Optimism being a pilot network to have a rebaseable stETH token available outside of Ethereum Mainnet. Moreover, the implemented solution is compatible with the [OP stack](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/getting-started#the-op-stack-today) and can be deployed on Superchain networks (Optimism, Base, Mode, etc.) with zero or minimal modifications. \n\n## Proposal actions\n\nIf this snapshot vote is approved, the on-chain wstETH on Optimism upgrade voting (together with connecting necessary rebase-passing contracts) will occur after:\n\n- testnet tryouts on Sepolia\n- security checks are successfully completed\n- upgrade action plan presented on the research forum (including timelines, and pre- and post- on-chain vote actions if needed)",

      "title": "Expanding the Simple DVT Module ",
      "content": "## Proposal Summary\n\nThe below text is an abridged version of the full proposal on the Lido Research forums: [https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-expanding-the-simple-dvt-module/7549](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-expanding-the-simple-dvt-module/7549)\n\nThis proposal seeks DAO approval for the expansion of the Simple DVT Module across two major components:\n\n1. Allowing for the creation of larger clusters in terms of the number of operated validators (known as Super Simple DVT Clusters), that are composed of Advanced Node Operators from the Simple DVT Module with members of the Curated Node Operator set, that would have a higher reward share to the DAO as compared to normal Simple DVT clusters and\n\n2. Increasing the maximum share limit of the staking module to 4% from the current 0.5%. On-chain actions to raise the limit will be taken during a subsequent on-chain vote, if this vote is approved.\n\n## Why the SDVTM Should be Expanded\n\nIn addition to facilitating the inclusion of the first solo and community stakers using the Lido protocol, Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) is expected to further improve the resilience, security, and infrastructure distribution of Lido related validators.\n\nThe Simple DVT Module (SDVTM) has been live within the Lido protocol for 3 months, and within this time significant progress has begun in terms of decentralizing the Lido Node Operator set.\n\nWith the next Obol & SSV Network testnets occurring during Q2, at least 250 net-new Node Operators are expected to be added to the protocol during 2024, an increase of 676% over the existing 37 members of the Curated Node Operator set.\n\nThe successful rollout of the Simple DVT Module has shown demonstrable progress towards the 2nd GOOSE goal of Attracting the Best Validator Set, which the [Lido DAO voted for in November 2023](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x0fa423280ce2bcc2596901d81322716ad440c7581658030a7d21784c2661d81c).\n\nWhile the Simple DVT Module has demonstrated the exciting potential of DVT, more can be done to supercharge the adoption of DVT via validators using the Lido protocol.\n\nThree constraints have been identified in the existing structure of the module that can be solved via this proposal:\n\n1. Due to the low number of validators per cluster at the current stake share limit of 0.5%, Node Operators are unlikely to afford the cost of running validators if the number of clusters are expanded,\n2. Due to the conservative timeline in scaling the number of validators these clusters run, a limited number of DVT based validators can be brought onto the protocol in the near-term, and\n3. As participants in Simple DVT clusters do not need to assume associated fees to operate validators, the maximum number of validators per cluster should be limited given the constituent make-up of these clusters.\n\n## Component 1: Scaling 72 Simple DVT Clusters\n\nCurrently, the Simple DVT Module has a share limit of 0.5% of Lido stake. As of 21.05.2024, this equates to approximately 1,420 validators to be split evenly across Obol and SSV Network clusters. With two LNOSG evaluation rounds and DAO discussion periods complete, 24 Obol clusters and 21 SSV clusters have been proposed for mainnet onboarding so far.\n\nWith current market dynamics, the average rewards for a Node Operator participating in Simple DVT is equivalent to approximately $30 per validator per year. Assuming an equal split of 24 Obol and SSV clusters, the module currently has capacity for each cluster to run approximately 29 validators. For some, this is not enough in terms of rewards to cover operational costs across hardware and time contributed.\n\nAs a result, the proposed solution is to increase the stake share limit of the module. With 2% of the updated staking share allocated to the normal Simple DVT clusters, this would represent 5,690 validators to be split between these Obol and SSV clusters. Assuming 72 clusters in this format (36 for each provider), as of 21.05.2024 this would represent approximately 80 validators per cluster.\n\nThis would greatly improve the economics for participating Node Operators (especially solo and community stakers) and at least cover the fixed costs for the majority of professional Node Operators. Meanwhile, the total number of validators that any one cluster would be running would still remain limited, taking into account the unbonded nature of these clusters and greater diversity of participant types.\n\nFrom the perspective of the DAO, the rewards structure would not change for these clusters from the existing reward share voted on in the Simple DVT Module proposal.\n\nAs a reminder, the total reward share for the Simple DVT Module is 10%, with the Lido DAO receiving 2% of rewards. In the case of Obol clusters, Node Operators receive 7% (1% each), and Obol receives 1% of rewards. For SSV clusters, Node Operators receive 8% (1.14% each), however operators are responsible for paying the SSV Network Fees and other associated fees as [outlined in the SSV Network technical documentation](https://docs.ssv.network/learn/protocol-overview/tokenomics/fees).\n\n## Component 2: Adding 10 Super Simple DVT Clusters\n\nWhile Component 1 of the proposal would expand the available capacity of DVT validators within the protocol, it is still constrained by higher operational load in terms of cluster onboarding as well as a more limited number of validators each cluster should support.\n\nTo solve this, the proposal suggests the addition of 10 Super Simple DVT Clusters, 5 from Obol, and 5 from SSV Network, in addition to the normal Simple DVT clusters discussed above.\n\nThese clusters would consist of members of the Curated Operator set along with Advanced Node Operators (ANOs), a classification that was discussed in the original Simple DVT Module proposal. ANOs are participants that have demonstrated consistently strong performance from both a qualitative and quantitative standpoint during Simple DVT testnets and/or mainnet. As noted in the original proposal, any cluster running 100+ validators should contain at least 50% of the members with the ANO classification.\n\nThe Lido Node Operator Subgovernance Group would meet to review performance of these operators using mainnet and/or testnet data, and propose the five clusters for each DV provider to the DAO, which would be followed with a week discussion period to consider the proposal, in-line with the existing flow of Simple DVT onboarding.\n\nIn general, the initial ANOs would likely consist of mostly professional node operators, however solo and community stakers are also eligible for this classification.\n\nOnce reviewed by the DAO, these “Super Clusters” would be eligible to run up to 500 validators using the protocol. Key limits would initially start at 50 validators (compared to the initial ~1 week monitoring period in the Curated Node Operator set of 100 validators), and after a two week period a performance report would be shared with the DAO for review.\n\nFrom the economics perspective, given the larger number of validators these Super Clusters would operate, a change would be made to the rewards structure. From the module point of view, the existing rewards structure would remain in place. However, as Lido Simple DVT rewards are distributed in both Obol and SSV clusters via a set of splitter smart contracts, the DAO portion of rewards could be increased through the splitter mechanism.\n\nThe proposed reward structure would consist of the following format: the direct DAO treasury reward share would remain at 2%, however an additional 2% would be added to the DAO treasury following reward distribution via the splitter contract. In Obol clusters, participants would receive 5% of rewards, and Obol would continue to receive 1%. In SSV clusters, participants would receive 6%, however they would still be responsible for paying the SSV Network Fees and other associated fees as [outlined in the SSV Network technical documentation](https://docs.ssv.network/learn/protocol-overview/tokenomics/fees).\n\nClaiming from the splitter is permissionless, meaning any address could trigger the claim flow to the DAO treasury at any point following the stETH rebase. The splitter contracts would be deployed by contributors from Obol and SSV, with verification from Lido contributors to ensure addresses are properly configured. For more information about Simple DVT Reward distribution and the Obol wrapper and 0xsplits set of smart contracts, see the [Simple DVT Reward Distribution section of this post](https://research.lido.fi/t/staking-router-module-proposal-simple-dvt/5625/23#simple-dvt-reward-distribution-5).\n\n## Onboarding & Validator Scaling\n\nOnboarding and evaluations for participants covered in Component 1, the scaling of the existing cluster format would be unchanged from the current process described in the Simple DVT Module proposal. The LNOSG assesses testnet participants, meets to discuss their performance, and proposes clusters to the DAO with a week discussion period before being finalized.\n\nThe Simple DVT Module Committee (SDVTMC) is then responsible for preparing the Easy Track motions to add Node Operators to the Simple DVT Node Operator registry and raising key limits for the clusters. After the initial 5 validators are active for a month, a performance report is presented to the DAO with the potential for a proposal to the DAO from the committee to raise the key limits further. This process is followed for at least the first 3 months of operation, and for any subsequent increases in validator key limits. All actions by the SDVTMC occur via Easy Track, and are vetoable over a 72 hour period by LDO holders.\n\nFor the Super Simple DVT Clusters discussed in Component 2, the process would be very similar. Participants would already have been proposed by the LNOSG and accepted by the DAO to participate in the normal Simple DVT clusters. However, the LNOSG would meet to evaluate Node Operators, and propose participants that fall into the Advanced Node Operator category. This proposal would be shared to the DAO, with a week discussion period to consider the participants and the proposed clusters.\n\nIf accepted, the SDVTMC would then also prepare transactions to add Node Operators to the SDVT Node Operator registry and raise key limits for the clusters via Easy Track motions. Super Clusters would start with an initial key limit of 50 validators, and after two weeks of running those validators a performance report would be shared with the DAO. If performance is comparable to the overall validator set, a proposal would be made to raise the key limits to 200. The process would repeat again, and a proposal could be made to raise these cluster’s key limits to a maximum of 500 validators each.\n\n## Risk Factors\n\nWhile the two factors discussed below also exist for Node Operators in the Curated Set, it is important to highlight these risks as this proposal would expand the DVT deployment within the Lido Node Operator set to a scaled approach.\n\nDuring the [Snapshot vote for the Simple DVT Module](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xf3ac657484444f0b54eba2c251135c47f875e3d1821496247d11bdd7fab0f291), the DAO chose to utilize the existing [cover fund vault contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8B3f33234ABD88493c0Cd28De33D583B70beDe35) to cover risks from the Simple DVT Module. With 6,356 stETH currently in the contract, the vault would not be sufficient to cover the entire module in the event of a mass slashing or downtime event. In addition, it is possible that a mass slashing of either Obol or SSV Network validators in the module could trigger [bunker mode](https://docs.lido.fi/guides/oracle-spec/accounting-oracle#bunker-mode), impacting validator exits.\n\nAs noted earlier in the proposal, both Obol and SSV have made significant progress in terms of their mainnet adoption since the Simple DVT Proposal went live in October 2023, with more validators active between both DVT providers on mainnet than the entire capacity of the Simple DVT Module at its current 0.5% stake share limit.\n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\nThe Lido DAO and protocol has been encouraging the adoption of Distributed Validator Technology since the early stages of the technology, with [grants to both Obol and SSV (then Blox)](https://research.lido.fi/t/lego-strategic-commitment-to-research-of-ssvs-blox-staking-obol/817) in July 2021.\n\nWhen announced, the Simple DVT Module was a meaningful first step in adopting DVT on mainnet and using the benefits it provides to expand the Node Operator set to a larger number of participants. However, with the progress made to date from both the Obol and SSV teams, as well as the successful results of Simple DVT to-date, an expansion of the DAO’s strategy towards DVT seems desirable not only from an operator decentralization perspective, but also to support the protocol’s commitment to its core mission and values, as reiterated [in ReGoose](https://research.lido.fi/t/regoose-updated-goals-for-lido-in-the-light-of-mvi-and-restaking/7462)..\n\nBy increasing the staking share limit to 4%, the number of Node Operators that can be added to the protocol will be expanded by continuing to scale the clusters as planned. This will be done in a way to make it worthwhile for participants to contribute to running validators, while simultaneously increasing the distribution of infrastructure and client types utilized and taking advantage of the improved resilience and security that DVT based validators offer.\n\nAt the same time, by introducing the 10 Super Simple DVT clusters, the protocol can more quickly open up capacity for DV based validators operated by Curated Node Operators and Advanced Node Operators, and expand the share of stake operated by more high-quality participants in a way that provides reasonable economic benefits to both participants, DVT providers, and the DAO.\n\nIf there are no objections or requests for significant changes to the proposal, it is suggested that a Snapshot vote follow this proposal in one week’s time seeking approval for raising the stake share limit to 4% and the adoption of Super Simple DVT Clusters. By voting for this proposal, the Lido Node Operator set can continue on its path to become more decentralized, resilient, and secure, a meaningful step towards achieving the GOOSE goal of Attracting the Best Validator Set. If the Snapshot vote passes, an on-chain vote will follow to raise the stake share limit of the module to 4%.",

      "content": "The proposal improves protocol security by protecting against possible malicious negative rebase manipulations. If the DAO approves it, the new sanity checks will be included in the further on-chain vote to be applied to the Lido protocol.\n\n## TL;DR\n\nLido stETH stream contributors propose to improve the safety check for the accounting oracle report in the case of a negative rebase, reducing the possible impact size, but with the requirement for a second opinion for extreme cases.\n\nIt is proposed to change the current AccountingOracle sanity check, which currently does not allow reporting more than a 5% decrease in Consensus layer validator balance and withdrawal vault balance daily, to a sanity check that will not allow more than ~3.4% per an 18-day window (1.101 ETH decrease per validator concerning the window).\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe AccountingOracle contract aggregates all Lido validators’ Beacon Chain balances (`clBalance` in the report) to the protocol, critical for the daily rebase of the stETH token. To ensure data integrity, it uses a committee of nine Oracle daemons, with a consensus required from at least five.\n\nThe protocol could be harmed if this committee is compromised, malfunctions, or colludes. This risk is acknowledged and constrained by a sanity check that restricts the possible discrepancy in balance that Oracle can report. The current approach to sanity checking allows the Oracle committee to bring up to a 5% reduction of TVL in each report. Given that the governance reaction time is 3-4 days, the malicious or compromised Oracles could reduce the TVL by 15-20%, invoking mass liquidations on lending markets and dropping the price of stETH. \n\nThe contract specification details can be found in the [LIP-23](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-23.md). \n\n## Next steps\n\n- ChainSecurity is conducting the smart contract audit. Once finalized, the report will be published on the research forum.\n- If this snapshot vote is approved, the on-chain voting will occur after all audits and security checks successfully completed. An improved sanity checker will be applied to the protocol without a second opinion but rather an interface to integrate a preferred provider later on.\n- Plugging in a particular second opinion provider is a question of a separate discussion and voting.",

The proposal asks for the onboarding of the Mellow Protocol to Lido Alliance.\n\n## Terms and conditions\n\n### From Mellow\n\nThe new integration with Mellow will benefit the whole Lido ecosystem and stakers, making stETH a one-stop vehicle for delegation to operators and different AVSes. stETH liquidity may be increased in addition to becoming a prime LST vehicle available for onboarding to Mellow LRT.\n\n- Ethereum-alignment and commitment to decentralize validation\n    - By participating in the wide restaking ecosystem, Mellow would help to spread the geographical and technical decentralization efforts Lido does outside Ethereum validation\n    - As ETH has moved from Lido to EigenLayer, the weighted average node operator set has become [significantly more concentrated](https://x.com/enshriningplebs/status/1792304095950242075), presenting a risk to decentralized validation\n    - By encouraging users to use stETH in Mellow, it’s hoped to increase the level of validator decentralization in restaking, positively influencing Ethereum integrity\n- Use-cases for stETH adoption and integration\n    - stETH users will find new opportunities to deposit their assets in a restaking marketplace that is more transparent and offers more granularity with regard to risk exposure\n    - stETH holders may benefit from exclusive opportunities for earning Mellow points\n- Opportunities for node operators\n    - Lido node operators could launch their own composable LRT and take control of the risk management process by selecting AVS’ suitable for their needs rather than face their imposition by LRTs or restaking protocols\n    - They could also collaborate with curators to reach the same outcome and create bespoke LRTs for their customers based on stETH\n- 100,000,000 MLW tokens (10% of the total supply) will be locked in a Lido Alliance legal entity (e.g., Foundation) after TGE. These tokens will be held in perpetuity. These tokens will be subject to the same vesting and cliff terms as the team tokens: a 12-month cliff following the TGE, and a 30-month vesting period beginning after the cliff.\n\n### From Lido DAO\n\nWhat Mellow is seeking from Lido Alliance membership:\n\n- Endorsement\n    - Lido DAO’s acceptance of Mellow as a member of the Lido Alliance\n- Integrations\n    - Mellow discusses the integration of descriptions and links to deposits in Mellow UI in stETH into the Lido landing page, given the adherence to the industry security practices. After getting positive traction and if Lido DAO sees it possible and bringing value, integration of deposits directly into any Lido UI\n- Bug Bounty support\n    - Up for the first 4 months after deployment, support the Mellow smart contract bug bounty with up to $400,000 payout for critical and $150,000 payout for high-level finding on top of Mellow bounty (tokens supplied off [the exiting Lido Contributors Group EGG request](https://research.lido.fi/t/egg-st2024-v1-lido-contributors-group-request-for-grant-funding-to-advance-goose-goals/6054/1))\n- Ecosystem\n    - The shared stance of Mellow and Lido Alliance on decentralization and security is a prerequisite to having a shared ecosystem centered around stETH with Mellow LRTs as satellites\n- Liquidity support\n    - Mellow seeks access to a partnership network to enhance its own business development efforts for liquidity provision within the system\n- Network\n    - Lido DAO contributors and Mellow members will apply security best practices, refer talented individuals to each other (with no contributors poaching from either side), and collaborate in various ways to build a decentralized future for the Ethereum ecosystem\n- Consultation\n    - Mellow anticipates benefiting from the Lido team’s extensive expertise in different aspects of the ecosystem and technology. This includes access to contributor groups for knowledge sharing, conducted in a limited and non-disruptive manner.\n\n## Proposal actions\n\nThe proposal requests onboarding Mellow Protocol to Lido Alliance under the outlined terms and conditions.",

It relies on yet-to-be-built governance process for Lido DAO to identify and recognize projects that share the same values and mission, and have a way to positively contribute to the stETH ecosystem.\n\nThe proposal asks for creation of a dedicated Alliance workgroup of Lido Contributors. The group’s purpose is to assess potential new Alliance members, facilitate & guide them in the DAO’s governance process, as well as help with navigating the potential alignment & product development possibilities. Onboarding and offboarding to the Lido Alliance is decided by the DAO via a snapshot vote.\n\n## Wishlist\n\nWhile the Alliance framework proposal is theoretically open to any new protocol, it's written with restaking in mind, and has two points to ‘wishlist’, as an open call to the community:\n\n- Permissionless LRTs, i.e. services that curate AVSes but allow users to delegate ETH in a trustless and multisig-less way (similar to Yearn strategies or MetaMorpho vaults)\n- Preconfirmation services and other AVS protocols that are Ethereum-aligned and can help make the network stronger\n\n## Proposal actions\n\nThis proposal requests:\n\n- Recognition of Lido Alliance as a group of Lido-aligned projects\n- Approval of the initial wishlist\n- Authorization from Lido DAO for Contributors to implement this proposal, including setting up a new DAO-adjacent legal entity that will setup any multisig wallets that might be necessary for its operation or to support the operational needs of the Alliance, as well as to sign service agreements with the Alliance Workgroup.\n\nApproval of the proposal would authorize setting up an Alliance Workgroup and a new legal entity that will host it, along with the creation of a temporary Alliance Development Committee composed of current Lido contributors to lead reviews for Alliance applications until the Alliance Workgroup is set up.\n\nThe temporary Alliance Development Committee:\n\n- [@Steakhouse](https://Research.lido.fi/u/steakhouse), Finance Workstream\n- [@Kadmil](https://research.lido.fi/u/kadmil), DAO Operations Workstream",

      "content": "## Summary\n\nSince November 2, 2023, when the [Lido DAO goals for 2024](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x0fa423280ce2bcc2596901d81322716ad440c7581658030a7d21784c2661d81c) were approved, significant internal achievements and external developments have occurred, above all, the Ethereum issuance debate and the rise of restaking. \n\nThe magnitude of these developments raises questions about the DAO’s strategy and whether it is still the best course of action or whether it should be revisited. The proposal suggests what should change, and what should stay the same in Lido DAO’s GOOSE (Guided Open Objective Setting Exercise) goals.\n\n## Proposed goals for 2024\n\nThings that don't need to be changed, but need to be emphasized:\n\n1. Stay focused on security and decentralization\n2. Reaffirm that StETH should stay an LST, not become an LRT\n\nNew goals to be added to GOOSE goals:\n\n3. Participate in Ethereum staking roadmap research\n4. Support Ethereum-aligned validator services, starting with preconfirmations, without exposing stakers to additional risk\n5. Make StETH the most utilized token in the restaking market, allowing stakers to opt into additional points on the risk and reward spectrum\n\nThe rest [proposed for 2024 goals](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x0fa423280ce2bcc2596901d81322716ad440c7581658030a7d21784c2661d81c) are staying the same.\n\nThe context and motivation for changing the goals are described in the proposal post: https://research.lido.fi/t/regoose-updated-goals-for-lido-in-the-light-of-mvi-and-restaking/7462\n\n## Proposal actions\n\nIf approved, the proposal would signal an amendment to the current set of GOOSE Goals for 2024.",

      "content": "### What is Dual Governance\n\nThe Dual Governance mechanism (DG) is an iteration on the protocol governance that gives StETH holders 1) a dynamic user-extensible timelock on DAO decisions and 2) a rage quit mechanism taking into account the specifics of how Ethereum withdrawals work.\n\n### The proposal\n\nDual Governance research team is seeking a sentiment check of the Dual Governance design from the Lido DAO. If the proposal is passed, the team will move forward with a technical implementation. \nTo prepare the project to the release, plan is to start collaborating with external research- and security-focused teams to make sure 1) the design, 2) the implementation and 3) the parameters are sound and ready for the mainnet deployment. The third-party engagements have been budgeted under [[EGG] st2024 v1](https://research.lido.fi/t/egg-st2024-v1-lido-contributors-group-request-for-grant-funding-to-advance-goose-goals/6054)\n\n### Current status\n\nAfter multiple stages of the research ([the latest update](https://research.lido.fi/t/ldo-steth-dual-governance-continuation/5727/26), [the start of the “continuation” thread](https://research.lido.fi/t/ldo-steth-dual-governance-continuation/5727), [the initial post](https://research.lido.fi/t/ldo-steth-dual-governance/2382)), the mechanism design is now fully fleshed out. The [mechanism design](https://github.com/lidofinance/dual-governance/blob/develop/docs/mechanism.md) is outlined on GitHub, as is the [the technical architecture](https://github.com/lidofinance/dual-governance/blob/develop/docs/specification.md) and [the code draft](https://github.com/lidofinance/dual-governance). Contributors have started spec review projects with [Certora](https://www.certora.com/) and [Runtimeverification](https://runtimeverification.com/) teams.\n\n### External teams involvement\n\nThe project involves a number of external teams challenging the design, code and parameter choices. The current plan includes working on the specification and code-level checks and audits with [Certora](https://www.certora.com/), [Runtimeverification](https://runtimeverification.com/), [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/), [Statemind](https://statemind.io/), and engaging Collectif Labs research team for parameters research collaboration (developers behind the https://collectif.finance/).\n\n### Approximate timeline\n\nThe approximate timeline targets a testnet deployment around Q3, with potential mainnet launch in late Q3 / Q4. Note that the timelines are approximate at the moment and are subject to change depending upon the security checks and the testnet results.\n\n### Signal your support\n\nThe Dual Governance mechanism is targeted to make Lido on Ethereum a better liquid staking protocol. Make sure to raise any questions on forum and — if that’s the case — signal your support for the project.",

      "content": "### Tl;Dr\n\nOne of the parts of Lido on Ethereum protocol is [GateSeal](https://github.com/lidofinance/gate-seals).\n\n> A GateSeal is a one-time use Smart Contract that allows a designated account to instantly put a set of contracts on pause (i.e. seal) for a predetermined amount of time. GateSeals are meant to be used as a panic button for any crucial contracts in case of an emergency. Each GateSeal is one-time use only and immediately becomes unusable once activated. If the seal is never triggered, the GateSeal will still eventually expire after a set period.\n> \n\nLido on Ethereum protocol contains using a single GateSeal for two contracts that affect withdrawals:\n1. Withdrawal queue (users’ side of withdrawals)\n2. Validator exit bus oracle (Node Operators’ side of withdrawals).\n\nIt allows to pause the contracts for 6 days to provide the DAO with an opportunity to respond to unforeseen vulnerabilities within the Lido on Ethereum protocol.\n\nInitially, the expiration date was set for May 1, 2024 ([Lido V2 GateSeal Committee](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-v2-gateseal-committee/4561)). \n\nThe proposal seeks to prolong the functioning of the GateSeal mechanics with the same parameters for the following year, till 1 April 2025. \n\n### Proposed decision\n\nIt’s proposed to use the new instance of the GateSeal Blueprint ([0xEe06EA501f7d9DC6F4200385A8D910182D155d3e](https://etherscan.io/address/0xEe06EA501f7d9DC6F4200385A8D910182D155d3e)), deployed with GateSeal Factory ([0x6c82877cac5a7a739f16ca0a89c0a328b8764a24](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6c82877cac5a7a739f16ca0a89c0a328b8764a24)). The GateSeal Factory and GateSeal Blueprint contracts were audited during the Lido V2 upgrade: [GitHub - lidofinance/audits](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits/?tab=readme-ov-file#04-2023-statemind-gateseals-audit)\n\nThe proposed parameters for the new GateSeal are:\n\n- Have the same list of `sealables`\n    - Withdrawal Queue (proxy): [0x889edC2eDab5f40e902b864aD4d7AdE8E412F9B1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x889edC2eDab5f40e902b864aD4d7AdE8E412F9B1)\n    - Validator Exit Bus Oracle (proxy): [0x0De4Ea0184c2ad0BacA7183356Aea5B8d5Bf5c6e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0De4Ea0184c2ad0BacA7183356Aea5B8d5Bf5c6e)\n- Use the same 3/6 multisig [0x8772E3a2D86B9347A2688f9bc1808A6d8917760C](https://app.safe.global/transactions/queue?safe=eth:0x8772E3a2D86B9347A2688f9bc1808A6d8917760C)\n- Set the activity duration till 1 April 2025\n- Set the same pause duration of 6 days (518400 seconds)\n\nThe GateSeal Committee ([https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-v2-gateseal-committee/4561](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-v2-gateseal-committee/4561)) continues oversight, ensuring ongoing public updates on actions.\n\n### GateSeal multisig chores\n\nTo ensure the functionality and preparedness of the GateSeal, the following additional actions are also proposed:\n\n- [@skozin](https://research.lido.fi/u/skozin/summary) will depart the GateSeal multisig leaving a vacancy, so it is proposed to rotate their address  `0x2CAE3a4D4c513026Ecc6af94A4BA89Df31c8cEA3` for [@theDZhon](https://research.lido.fi/u/thedzhon) (Lido on Ethereum protocol team) with address `0x59f8d74fe49d5ebeac069e3baf07eb4b614bd5a7`.\n- The incident response drill will be conducted by DAO Ops team by no later than June 30, 2024. The incident response drill is to be had in order to ensure that the GateSeal signers are ready to react to the situation requiring their immediate action.\n\n### Next steps\n\nThe new instance of GateSeal will be deployed and announced under [the post](https://research.lido.fi/t/renew-gateseal-for-the-withdrawal-queue-and-validator-exit-bus-oracle/7081).\nThe deployment verification by a third-party audit team will be posted on the forum before the on-chain voting.\n\nIf this proposal is approved by the DAO, the on-chain vote will be launched to make changes to contracts.",

However, the new program introduces number of changes, summarised below.\n\n## **Summary of main changes**\n\n- **Minimum Threshold:** The new program will focus on institutional applicants that meet a Minimum Threshold that requires participants to demonstrate that they have already driven at least 40,000 ETH in stake coming from users of the Lido Middleware - this should attract high quality participants.\n- **No tiers:** Instead, the Rewards Share Percentage will be calculated by the Committee, up to a maximum of 50% of the DAO’s 5% share of staking rewards.\n- **Quarterly payment of rewards-share**\n\nFor more details about the program please refer to [the forum post](https://research.lido.fi/t/rewards-share-program-2024/6812). Rewards Share committee details located [here](https://docs.lido.fi/multisigs/committees#22-rewards-share-committee-prev-referral-program-committee).\n\nThe program will use the remainder of the previous program pool and payments will be made by the same Easy Track factories as in the previous program.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nThe Committee hopes that the changes summarised above will lead to improved performance through increased institutional adoption of stETH, in an effort to better support Lido DAO’s objectives (described in the GOOSE (Guided Open Objective Setting Exercise) Proposal adopted by Lido DAO in the [snapshot vote on 22 Sept 2023](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x58bbc5d540e46081043ef29d4d1ee56b7df4dc1b0369aa78e0c15a2403549353)).",

      "title": "Should the Lido DAO recognize the wstETH Bridge Endpoints on Scroll as canonical?",
      "content": "**The proposal** is to recognize the wstETH token bridging endpoints for Scroll by the Lido DAO as canonical. If Snapshot passes, the Lido DAO will control the endpoints of wstETH token contract (including the token contract on Scroll itself) as a proxy admin. Lido DAO will only have the upgrade authority of the wstETH proxy contract, and will not be able to manage the native bridge itself.\n\nThe Scroll Team is submitting this proposal to the community for the deployment of wstETH on Scroll.\n\n[Scroll](https://scroll.io/) is an EVM-equivalent ZK-Rollup built upon Ethereum, designed for scaling without sacrificing security, developer, or user experience:\n\n- **EVM Equivalence & Developer Friendliness**\n- **Ethereum-native & Community first:** Scroll originated in close collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation’s zkEVM research\n- **Decentralization & Security:** Scroll has continually made upgrades across testnets to make it more trustless, and is committed to decentralizing both its sequencing and proving.\n\nScroll launched mainnet on October 17th, 2023, and since then, had significant traction, seeing:\n\n- ~70M bridged TVL / ~30M DeFi TVL\n- 16M+ transactions (averaging over 100k+ tx/day)\n- 3M unique wallet addresses\n\n### Motivation\n\nLido stETH (and wstETH) is a critical asset in the Ethereum ecosystem with a significant market capitalization, and has emerged as a crucial component in DeFi applications. Naturally, a wide variety of protocols on Scroll—both established and native—have already indicated significant demand for wstETH across various use cases. Examples of this include wstETH’s usage as collateral, in lending protocols, DEX pools, vaults, yield optimizers / farming, indexes, LST-backed stablecoins, etc.\n\nFurthermore, already more than 3700 wstETH tokens have minted on Scroll, with over 7000 unique holders. There has been steady, organic growth of the asset with clear demand since Scroll’s mainnet launch.\n\n## Solution Overview\n\nScroll has already implemented the canonical wstETH L1 and L2 Gateways, and has concluded its audit. The design uses the architecture of [wstETH on Optimism and Arbitrum](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-l2) and [governance forwarder](https://github.com/lidofinance/governance-crosschain-bridges) used on multiple L2s as reference. Moreover, the path forward is upgrading in response to reference architecture and governance decision-forwarding demand, not redeploying the token from scratch, significantly simplifying the necessary next steps. Further details below:\n\n- [Upgrade preparations](https://hackmd.io/oBQrAyemTqSJ80bMTAFAwQ?view)\n- [Governance Forwarding](https://github.com/scroll-tech/governance-crosschain-bridges/)\n- Emergency Brakes: The upgrade architecture allows emergency pause functionality for wstETH deposits/withdrawals, activated using the established mechanism of [Emergency Brakes](https://research.lido.fi/t/emergency-brakes-signer-rotation/5286).\n\nThe [proposed components](https://docs.lido.fi/deployed-contracts/#scroll) utilize Scroll’s native bridge instance for the message transfer. The token’s upgradeability is possible, due to the token proxy admin being set to Lido DAO and separate from the bridge admin (Scroll) instance. This approach aligns with the unofficial guidelines presented by [NEW](https://research.lido.fi/t/unofficial-guidelines-for-bridging-solutions-network-expansion-workgroup/5790) and is future-ready for wstETH. As such, neither the bridge or Lido DAO take any additional fees from users. The regular gas fees required for transaction execution will still be charged to the user.\nIn case of an emergency, Lido Emergency Brakes multisig will be used to pause the deposits and withdrawals only for the wstETH transfers. In order to resume the bridging activity for wstETH, there will be a need for a Lido DAO on chain vote on Ethereum mainnet.\n\n## Audits\n\nTo better form an opinion you may consider reading through the [audit report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X6YKpSLN9VYaTnsMOaEcMRNz2rcpzNI6/view) for:\n- Governance crosschain bridges (ScrollBridgeExecutor)\n- wstETH on Scroll (L1LidoGateway, L2LidoGateway, L2WstETHToken, LidoBridgeableTokens, LidoGatewayManager)\n\n## Mainnet contracts\n\n- Emergency Brakes Multisigs\n    - Scroll: [0xF580753E334687C0d6b88EF563a258f048384Ee6](https://safe.scroll.xyz/home?safe=scr:0xF580753E334687C0d6b88EF563a258f048384Ee6)\n- Ethereum part\n    - L1LidoGateway: [0x6625c6332c9f91f2d27c304e729b86db87a3f504](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6625c6332c9f91f2d27c304e729b86db87a3f504) (proxy)\n    - L1LidoGateway: [0xF4f2066EE72D62e3caF9678459149BA7FCf2262F](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF4f2066EE72D62e3caF9678459149BA7FCf2262F) (impl)\n    - ProxyAdmin: [0xCC2C53556Bc75217cf698721b29071d6f12628A9](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCC2C53556Bc75217cf698721b29071d6f12628A9) for L1LidoGateway\n- Scroll part\n    - ScrollBridgeExecutor: [0x0c67D8D067E349669dfEAB132A7c03A90594eE09](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x0c67D8D067E349669dfEAB132A7c03A90594eE09)\n    - L2LidoGateway: [0x8aE8f22226B9d789A36AC81474e633f8bE2856c9](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x8aE8f22226B9d789A36AC81474e633f8bE2856c9) (proxy)\n    - L2LidoGateway: [0x2B9beB2890DBeFC7cA25Af3164100d139B623C24](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x2B9beB2890DBeFC7cA25Af3164100d139B623C24) (impl)\n    - L2WstETHToken: [0xf610A9dfB7C89644979b4A0f27063E9e7d7Cda32](https://scrollscan.com/address/0xf610A9dfB7C89644979b4A0f27063E9e7d7Cda32)(proxy)\n    - L2WstETHToken: [0x38224D52ecC979aEdfEb31b1EEa0cfCEbd55247e](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x38224D52ecC979aEdfEb31b1EEa0cfCEbd55247e) (impl)\n    - ProxyAdmin: [0x8e34D07Eb348716a1f0a48A507A9de8a3A6DcE45](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x8e34D07Eb348716a1f0a48A507A9de8a3A6DcE45) for:\n        - L2LidoGateway\n        - L2WstETHToken\n\n## Ownership, roles, and levers Mainnet setup\n\nPre-vote ACL and levers setup:\n\n- for [ScrollBridgeExecuror](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x0c67D8D067E349669dfEAB132A7c03A90594eE09)\n    - [getEthereumGovernanceExecutor](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x0c67D8D067E349669dfEAB132A7c03A90594eE09#readContract#F6) is [Lido DAO Agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c) (admin)\n- A bridge admin and role holder on L1 is the [Lido DAO Agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n    - `owner` for L1LidoGateway\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1LidoGateway\n    - WITHDRAWALS_ENABLER_ROLE for L1LidoGateway\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1LidoGateway\n    - DEPOSITS_ENABLER_ROLE for L1LidoGateway\n- A bridge admin and role holder on L2 is the [ScrollBridgeExecutor](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x0c67D8D067E349669dfEAB132A7c03A90594eE09)\n    - `owner` for L2LidoGateway\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2LidoGateway\n    - WITHDRAWALS_ENABLER_ROLE for L2LidoGateway\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2LidoGateway\n    - DEPOSITS_ENABLER_ROLE for L2LidoGateway\n- Emergency brakes msig on L1 is [0x73b047fe6337183A454c5217241D780a932777bD](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xfe2a6a6506a642b616118363bc29aa83dd9ef2ec80447bb607a8f52c0a96aed0) , 3/5 threshold:\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1LidoGateway\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1LidoGateway\n- Emergency brakes msig on L2 is a new one [0xF580753E334687C0d6b88EF563a258f048384Ee6](https://safe.scroll.xyz/home?safe=scr:0xF580753E334687C0d6b88EF563a258f048384Ee6) inheriting the same EOAs as for L1, 3/5 threshold:\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2LidoGateway\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2LidoGateway\n\nPost-vote (if the vote is supported) finalizing actions from the Scroll side:\n\n- for L1LidoGateway\n    - assign the [proposed ProxyAdmin on L1](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCC2C53556Bc75217cf698721b29071d6f12628A9) having the [Lido DAO Agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c) `owner`\n- for [L2WstETHToken](https://scrollscan.com/address/0xf610A9dfB7C89644979b4A0f27063E9e7d7Cda32) and L2LidoGateway\n    - assign the [proposed ProxyAdmin on L2](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x8e34D07Eb348716a1f0a48A507A9de8a3A6DcE45) having the [ScrollBridgeExecuror](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x0c67D8D067E349669dfEAB132A7c03A90594eE09) `owner`",

      "title": "Simple On-chain Delegation",
      "content": "This is a signal proposal intended to approve the overall design for Simple On-chain Delegation. If the DAO approves this proposal, the voting dedicated to on-chain changes will take place in April after all audits and security checks pass.\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThe Simple On-chain Delegation allows LDO token holders to delegate their voting power to other addresses and delegates to participate in on-chain voting on behalf of their delegated voters. Alongside that, it’s proposed to add [TRP (Token Rewards Plan)](https://research.lido.fi/t/lidodao-token-rewards-plan-trp/3364) participants the ability to delegate their LDO rewards.\n\nThis proposal is intended to address the security and operational hurdles arising from the lack of delegation for on-chain voting. This quick and cost-effective solution involves some simplification of the user experience; however, it is intended to address urgent needs while a more comprehensive solution is worked on.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nIn the current conditions, reaching a quorum in on-chain voting has become highly challenging, and several consecutive votes failed to reach a quorum. The absence of an on-chain delegation is a blocker for stable and sufficient participation in on-chain voting and protocol development.\n\n## Projects objective\n\nThree vectors can be directly or indirectly solved through on-chain delegation:\n\n1. Activate the voting power of the voters who are already involved in the governance process and have delegated their voting power on off-chain [snapshot.org](http://snapshot.org/) but have never participated in on-chain voting.\n2. Ease the on-chain voting process for those who are already involved in the governance process and participate in on-chain voting but irregularly. There are various reasons for this: limited and complex access to cold wallets given the short 48-hour voting phase or multi-sig as a token holder.\n3. Attract those willing to participate in the governance process when Lido DAO determines an open delegation mechanism with a list of delegates.\n\nThe project aims to achieve a 20-30M increase in quarterly active voting power participation on-chain within 3 months of its launch (for Q4 2023, the quarterly active VP on on-chain votes accounted for ~90M LDO, and on off-chain [snapshot.org](http://snapshot.org/) ~120M LDO).\n\n## Design Requirements and trade-offs\n\nA proper full-fledged delegation mechanism involves maintaining an accounting to track actual delegated voting power at any moment accurately. Implementing this is a complex and time-consuming project.\n\nThe current solution is a simplified version that addresses three basic requirements:\n\n1. There is a mapping of token holders’ and delegates’ addresses; the token holder can set a delegate and cancel the delegation, and the delegate can obtain the addresses of all those who have delegated to them.\n2. A delegate can vote on behalf of a token holder or a list of token holders.\n3. A token holder has an ultimate authority, they can override the delegate’s decision on a vote.\n\nYou can dive into the design description of the solution in the **specification: [LIP-21. Simple On-chain Delegation.](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-21.md)**\n\n## Next steps\n\nNow the solution is undergoing several security audits.\n\nIf this vote gets approval from the DAO, the on-chain voting (hopefully the last one without the delegation feature) is planned for April.\n\nThe on-chain voting will be held after all audits and security checks successfully pass.",

      "title": "InfStones Return to Active Status Proposal",
      "content": "This proposal is a followup to the previous vote (in December 2023) regarding InfStones resuming active participation in the Lido Node Operator set ([link to the vote](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xe432ccf3aba98301bcb9acc1befbf1725fbec1431340fbb1fdc0c0a8143ad188)), which ended with a lack of quorum for any option and generally leaning towards the operator re-activating but with some voters opining that additional time was required.\n\nIn the time since, InfStones have worked with a third party information security consultant (https://carbidesecure.com/) to perform penetration testing on their infra, specifically targeting the issues identified in the original infrastructure vulnerability disclosure. The executive summary of the pentest has been provided to the DAO (https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-on-ethereum-node-operator-infstones-platform-vulnerability-investigation-november-22-2023/6001/23), and the detailed report was provided to DAO contributors who requested access, as well as a SOC 2 Type I report. Follow-up questions were submitted by contributors and responses were received. Currently, contributors feel that there is no reason to believe that the relevant infrastructure vulnerabilities are still present, nor that any other known vulnerabilities have not been adequately remediated and/or resolved.\n\nA summary of events follows below:\n\nOn Nov 22, Lido DAO contributors were made aware of two platform vulnerabilities in the validator infrastructure of one of the Curated Set Node Operators (InfStones) that utilize the Lido on Ethereum Protocol.\n\nAs a result of the mutual understanding of the potential implications of the vulnerabilities, the Node Operator volunteered to exit the validators out of an abundance of caution. The stake for the 10,001 validators that they were operating completed flowing back through the Lido on Ethereum Protocol through the Lido Withdrawal Vault and was automatically allocated to pending withdrawals at the time or other node operators.\n\nInfStones has posted a response on the Lido research forums indicating their understanding and approach regarding the infrastructure vulnerabilities; and has stated that the relevant gaps have been remediated. Additionally, InfStones have set up a bug bounty program that covers their infrastructure, and have also completed a SOC 2 Type I audit using an external third party, and have now also completed a pen-test with a third party, with the results to be shared with the DAO.\n\n### As a result, InfStones is looking to ask the DAO the following:\n\nIs the DAO satisfied that the Node Operator has appropriately remediated the issues in their infra such that InfStones can resume active participation in the Curated Operator Set?\n\n**Voting Instructions**\n\nThis is a single-option vote.\n\n- If you believe that the Node Operator has shown enough evidence that the vulnerability has been remediated and can resume submitting keys in a guarded fashion, vote “For”.\n- If you believe that the Node Operator should be removed from the Node Operator set, vote “Against”.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\n- If the “For” option reaches quorum, then the Node Operator will resume key submission at their convenience and raise their validator limit in a guarded manner.\n- If the “Against” option reaches quorum, a separate on-chain vote will be required to deactivate the Node Operator.",

A quorum of 50M in total across all options is reached.\n2. The leading option must exceed the second candidate by a margin of 20% of votes participated in the vote.\n\nIf the second condition is not met, the voting will be restarted, excluding options that received less than 10M LDO votes in the first round.\n\n## Submissions and forum discussions\n\nThis vote is required to complete the first phase of the BNB expansion process.

      "title": "[rerun] Should the Lido DAO recognize the wstETH Bridge Endpoints on zkSync Era as canonical?",
      "content": "## **Introduction**\n\nThe proposal is to recognize the wstETH token bridging endpoints on zkSync Era by the Lido DAO. If Snapshot passes, the Lido DAO will control the endpoints of wstETH token contract (including the token contract on zkSync Era itself) as a proxy admin.  Lido DAO will only have the upgrade authority of the wstETH proxy contract, and will not be able to manage the native bridge itself.\n\nMatter Labs proposed the deployment of wstETH (Wrapped staked ETH) to zkSync Era, with the ultimate goal of recognizing the wstETH token bridging endpoints by the Lido DAO.\n\n## **Namely:**\n\n1. [Upgrade authority set to the Lido DAO Aragon Agent contract on L1 and L2](https://docs.lido.fi/deployed-contracts/#lido-v2-dao-contracts)\n2. [Pausability by Emergency Brakes multisig](https://docs.lido.fi/deployed-contracts/#emergency-brakes-multisigs).\n\nThis initiative has been undertaken by the Matter Labs & TxFusion team who deployed the wstETH components for the zkSync’s native bridge to zkSync, inspired by the same open-source solution previously applied in the Optimism deployment.\n\nThe [proposed components](https://docs.lido.fi/deployed-contracts/#zksync-era) utilize zkSync’s native bridge instance for the message transfer. The token’s upgradeability is possible, due to the token proxy admin being set to Lido DAO and separate from the bridge admin (zkSync Era) instance. This approach aligns with the unofficial guidelines presented by [NEW (Network Expansion Workgroup)](https://research.lido.fi/t/unofficial-guidelines-for-bridging-solutions-network-expansion-workgroup/5790) and is future-ready for wstETH. As such, neither the bridge or Lido DAO take any additional fees from users. The regular gas fees required for transaction execution will still be charged to the user.\nIn case of an emergency, Lido Emergency Breaks multisig will be used to pause the deposits and withdrawals only for the wstETH transfers. In order to resume the bridging activity for wstETH, there will be a need for a Lido DAO on chain vote on Ethereum mainnet.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nzkSync Era Mainnet was launched on March 24, 2023. zkSync currently crossed over $440M TVL (grown +50% in the last four months), and unique wallets have crossed 3.7M. Transaction volume has averaged +15% week-over-week growth the last four months with a few times surpassing Ethereum itself on daily transactions.\n\nThis marks just the beginning with key network infrastructure upgrades coming within the next few months which will catalyze growth of TVL, users and transaction growth, as many protocols will now be able to launch.\n\nLido wstETH has the overwhelming market share of staked ETH and can be used interoperably in DeFi. Therefore, major ecosystems such as zkSync have significant demand for wstETH as it opens up opportunities for users to utilize stETH holdings in various DeFi protocols. Some examples include using wstETH as collateral, lending, indexing, minting, vaults, stables, etc.\n\nTaking a page from the Optimism playbook, we're leveraging an open-source solution (check out [GitHub](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-l2)) to make this happen.\n\nWe're proposing that the Lido DAO formally recognizes these bridging endpoints as canonical. Canonical means native/default. In the bridging context, a canonical token is the one that is minted by the native bridge such as zkSync’s native bridge in this case.\n\n## **Audits**\n\nTo better form an opinion you may consider reading through the following audit reports.\n\n[Cantina audit report](https://github.com/txfusion/lido-l2/blob/main/zksync/audits/lido-on-zkSync-audit-report.pdf)\n\n[Reference to the levers and ACL setup](https://research.lido.fi/t/wsteth-deployment-on-zksync/5701/7)\n\n## **Mainnet Contracts**\n\n**Previously existing Lido contracts on Ethereum:**\n\n- DAO Agent on L1: [0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n- Emergency Brakes 3/5 Multisig on L1: [0x73b047fe6337183A454c5217241D780a932777bD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x73b047fe6337183A454c5217241D780a932777bD)\n- wstETH on L1: [0x7f39C581F595B53c5cb19bD0b3f8dA6c935E2Ca0](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7f39C581F595B53c5cb19bD0b3f8dA6c935E2Ca0)\n\n**Newly deployed contracts on Ethereum:**\n\n- L1ERC20Bridge: [0x41527B2d03844dB6b0945f25702cB958b6d55989](https://etherscan.io/address/0x41527B2d03844dB6b0945f25702cB958b6d55989)\n- L1Executor: [0xFf7F4d05e3247374e86A3f7231A2Ed1CA63647F2](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFf7F4d05e3247374e86A3f7231A2Ed1CA63647F2)\n\n**Newly deployed contracts on zkSync Era:**\n\n- Emergency Brakes 3/5 Multisig on L2: [0x0D7F0A811978B3B62CbfF4EF6149B5909EAcfE94](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x0D7F0A811978B3B62CbfF4EF6149B5909EAcfE94)\n- wstETH on L2: [0x703b52F2b28fEbcB60E1372858AF5b18849FE867](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x703b52F2b28fEbcB60E1372858AF5b18849FE867)\n- L2ERC20Bridge: [0xE1D6A50E7101c8f8db77352897Ee3f1AC53f782B](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0xE1D6A50E7101c8f8db77352897Ee3f1AC53f782B)\n- ZkSyncBridgeExecutor: [0x139EE25DCad405d2a038E7A67f9ffdbf0f573f3c](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x139EE25DCad405d2a038E7A67f9ffdbf0f573f3c)\n\n**Deployment artefacts and levers setup:**\n\n- for [L1Executor](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFf7F4d05e3247374e86A3f7231A2Ed1CA63647F2)\n    - Proxy admin is the [Lido DAO Agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n    - owner is the [Lido DAO Agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n- for [ZkSyncBridgeExecutor](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x139EE25DCad405d2a038E7A67f9ffdbf0f573f3c)\n    - Proxy admin is [aliased](https://era.zksync.io/docs/api/go/utils.html#applyl1tol2alias) (L1Executor) via ProxyAdmin\n    - [getEthereumGovernanceExecutor](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x139EE25DCad405d2a038E7A67f9ffdbf0f573f3c#contract) is [aliased](https://era.zksync.io/docs/api/go/utils.html#applyl1tol2alias) (L1Executor) (admin)\n- A bridge admin and role holder on L1 is the [Lido DAO Agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n    - Proxy admin for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_ENABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - DEPOSITS_ENABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n- A bridge admin and role holder on L2 is the [ZkSyncBridgeExecutor](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x139EE25DCad405d2a038E7A67f9ffdbf0f573f3c)\n    - Proxy admin for L2ERC20Bridge\n    - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for L2ERC20Bridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20Bridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_ENABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20Bridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20Bridge\n    - DEPOSITS_ENABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20Bridge\n- for [ERC20BridgedUpgradeable](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x703b52F2b28fEbcB60E1372858AF5b18849FE867) (wstETH on L1)\n    - Proxy admin is [aliased](https://era.zksync.io/docs/api/go/utils.html#applyl1tol2alias) (L1Executor) via ProxyAdmin\n- Emergency breaks msig on L1 is [0x73b047fe6337183A454c5217241D780a932777bD](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x2b368b535b2024394daff218d222e260dbc4543b6d4e49aa4700cc0a9233e86a) , 3/5 threshold:\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n- Emergency breaks msig on L2 is a new one [0x0D7F0A811978B3B62CbfF4EF6149B5909EAcfE94](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=zksync%3A0x0D7F0A811978B3B62CbfF4EF6149B5909EAcfE94) inheriting the same EOAs as for L1, 3/5 threshold:\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20Bridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20Bridge",

      "title": "[rerun] Should the Lido DAO recognize the wstETH Bridge Endpoints on Mantle as canonical?",
      "content": "**The proposal** is to recognize the wstETH token bridging endpoints for Mantle by the Lido DAO as canonical. If Snapshot passes, the Lido DAO will control the endpoints of wstETH token contract (including the token contract on Mantle itself) as a proxy admin. Lido DAO will only have the upgrade authority of the wstETH proxy contract, and will not be able to manage the native bridge itself.\n\nThe Mantle Core Contributor Team is submitting this proposal to the community for the deployment of wstETH on Mantle.\n\n[Mantle Network](https://mantle.xyz/) is an optimistic Ethereum layer-2 (L2) solution with an EVM-compatible execution environment. Mantle is DAO-governed and employs a modular approach to execution, consensus, settlement, and data availability. In addition to a burgeoning ecosystem with 110+ dApps and counting, Mantle counts among its partners Game7, HyperPlay, EduDAO, Sozu Haus, and EigenLayer. The DAO-led community-driven Mantle possesses one of the largest on-chain treasuries — and the largest when discounting native tokens — including nearly 270K ETH/wstETH/WETH, priming it to be a major player in ETH LST and LSDFi.\n\n### Motivation\n\nDemand for Lido (w)stETH is significantly driven by its utility within major ecosystems, which are leveraging its composability in various DeFi protocols. Notably, wstETH’s overwhelming market share of staked ETH enhances its desirability. Additionally, wstETH’s versatility, being used for a range of DeFi applications including collateral, lending, farming, indexing, minting, vaults, and stables, amplifies its demand further. Mantle aims to leverage this demand for ETH liquid staking tokens and make wstETH one of the core building blocks of the Mantle ecosystem, as well as a core asset of its treasury to sustainably grow its protocol-owned liquidity (POL).\n\nwstETH has already been deployed onto Mantle via the native bridge. This proposed new deployment will be replacing the existing wstETH with a one-way migration pool opened for users to migrate.\n\n- Solution smart contracts\n    - [GitHub - mantlenetworkio/lido-l2](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/lido-l2/)\n\nThe [proposed components](https://docs.lido.fi/deployed-contracts/#mantle) utilize Mantle’s native bridge instance for the message transfer. The token’s upgradeability is possible, due to the token proxy admin being set to Lido DAO and separate from the bridge admin (Mantle) instance. This approach aligns with the unofficial guidelines presented by [NEW (Network Expansion Workgroup)](https://research.lido.fi/t/unofficial-guidelines-for-bridging-solutions-network-expansion-workgroup/5790) and is future-ready for wstETH. As such, neither the bridge or Lido DAO take any additional fees from users. The regular gas fees required for transaction execution will still be charged to the user.\nIn case of an emergency, Lido Emergency Breaks multisig will be used to pause the deposits and withdrawals only for the wstETH transfers. In order to resume the bridging activity for wstETH, there will be a need for a Lido DAO on chain vote on Ethereum mainnet.\n\n## Audits\n\nTo better form an opinion you may consider reading through the following audit reports.\n\n- [Governance crosschain bridges (OptimismBridgeExecutor)](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits/blob/main/Oxorio%20Governance%20Crosschain%20Bridges%20Smart%20Contracts%20Security%20Audit%20Report%2008-2022.pdf)\n- [wstETH on Mantle (L1ERC20TokenBridge, L2ERC20TokenBridge, ERC20BridgedPermit)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wbmD-sg_LYu2tWVp2YWjydltDF4OlueG/view?usp=sharing)\n\n## Contracts\n\n- Mainnet contracts:\n    - L1ERC20TokenBridge Impl: [0x6fBBe1Af52D22557D7F161Dc5952E306F4742e23](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6fBBe1Af52D22557D7F161Dc5952E306F4742e23)\n    - L1ERC20TokenBridge Proxy: [0x2D001d79E5aF5F65a939781FE228B267a8Ed468B](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2D001d79E5aF5F65a939781FE228B267a8Ed468B)\n    - ERC20Bridged Impl: [0x1FaBaAec88198291A4efCc85Cabb33a3785165ba](https://explorer.mantle.xyz/address/0x1FaBaAec88198291A4efCc85Cabb33a3785165ba)\n    - ERC20Bridged Proxy: [0x458ed78EB972a369799fb278c0243b25e5242A83](https://explorer.mantle.xyz/address/0x458ed78EB972a369799fb278c0243b25e5242A83)\n    - L2ERC20TokenBridge Impl: [0xf10A7ffC613a9b23Abc36167925A375bf5986181](https://explorer.mantle.xyz/address/0xf10A7ffC613a9b23Abc36167925A375bf5986181)\n    - L2ERC20TokenBridge Proxy: [0x9c46560D6209743968cC24150893631A39AfDe4d](https://explorer.mantle.xyz/address/0x9c46560D6209743968cC24150893631A39AfDe4d)\n    - OptimismBridgeExecutor: [0x3a7B055BF88CdC59D20D0245809C6E6B3c5819dd](https://explorer.mantle.xyz/address/0x3a7B055BF88CdC59D20D0245809C6E6B3c5819dd)\n\n## Ownership, roles, and levers Mainnet setup\n\n- for the [Mantle Governance Bridge Executor](https://explorer.mantle.xyz/address/0x3a7B055BF88CdC59D20D0245809C6E6B3c5819dd) (`OptimismBridgeExecutor` contract is used)\n    - `getEthereumGovernanceExecutor` is the [Lido DAO Agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n- A bridge admin and role holder on L1 is the [Lido DAO Agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n    - Proxy admin for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_ENABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - DEPOSITS_ENABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n- A bridge admin and role holder on L2 is the [Mantle Governance Bridge Executor](https://explorer.mantle.xyz/address/0x3a7B055BF88CdC59D20D0245809C6E6B3c5819dd)\n    - Proxy admin for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_ENABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_ENABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n- for the proposed wstETH token on L2 ([ERC20BridgedPermit](http://explorer.mantle.xyz/address/0x458ed78eb972a369799fb278c0243b25e5242a83))\n    - Proxy admin is the [Mantle Governance Bridge Executor](https://explorer.mantle.xyz/address/0x3a7B055BF88CdC59D20D0245809C6E6B3c5819dd)\n- [Emergency breaks msig on L1](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x2b368b535b2024394daff218d222e260dbc4543b6d4e49aa4700cc0a9233e86a) is [0x73b047fe6337183A454c5217241D780a932777bD](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x73b047fe6337183A454c5217241D780a932777bD), 3/5 threshold:\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n- Emergency breaks msig on L2 is a new one [0xa8579D42E34398267dE16e6eeeCdb7ED0EFF953C](https://multisig.mantle.xyz/home?safe=mantle:0xa8579D42E34398267dE16e6eeeCdb7ED0EFF953C) inheriting the same EOAs as for L1, 3/5 threshold:\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n- An initial deployer has no remaining permissions and levers assigned",

As a key asset, wstETH plays a vital role in DeFi activities across network segments.\n\n### Audits\n\nTo better form an opinion you may consider reading through the following audit reports.\n\n| Audit firm | Date | Contracts |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| OpenZeppelin | October 2023 | [Canonical Token Bridge](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/linea-bridge-audit-1) |\n| Diligence | October 2023 | [LineaBridgeExecutor](https://consensys.io/diligence/audits/private/1zps18ccw1anbm/) |\n| Diligence | June 2023 | [Canonical Token Bridge](https://consensys.io/diligence/audits/2023/06/linea-canonical-token-bridge) |\n| Diligence | June 2023 | [Linea Message Service](https://consensys.io/diligence/audits/2023/06/linea-message-service) |\n| Mixed | - | [All Other Audits](https://immunefi.com/bounty/linea/) |\n\n### Mainnet contracts\n\nEthereum\n\n- DAO Agent on L1: [0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n- wstETH on L1: [0x7f39C581F595B53c5cb19bD0b3f8dA6c935E2Ca0](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7f39C581F595B53c5cb19bD0b3f8dA6c935E2Ca0)\n- L1 Token Bridge (*Canonical Bridge*): [0x051f1d88f0af5763fb888ec4378b4d8b29ea3319](https://etherscan.io/address/0x051f1d88f0af5763fb888ec4378b4d8b29ea3319)\n\nLinea\n\n- LineaBridgeExecutor: [0x74Be82F00CC867614803ffd7f36A2a4aF0405670](https://lineascan.build/address/0x74Be82F00CC867614803ffd7f36A2a4aF0405670#code)\n- ProxyAdmin for wstETH: [0xF951d7592e03eDB0Bab3D533935e678Ce64Eb927](https://lineascan.build/address/0xF951d7592e03eDB0Bab3D533935e678Ce64Eb927#code)\n- wstETH on L2: [0xB5beDd42000b71FddE22D3eE8a79Bd49A568fC8F](https://lineascan.build/address/0xB5beDd42000b71FddE22D3eE8a79Bd49A568fC8F)\n- L2 Token Bridge (*Canonical Bridge*): [0x353012dc4a9a6cf55c941badc267f82004a8ceb9](https://lineascan.build/address/0x353012dc4a9a6cf55c941badc267f82004a8ceb9)\n\n### Levers setup\n\nThe levers and proxy admins are prepared to set the admin role of the wstETH token contract to the Lido DAO, contingent on successful snapshot approval.\n\n- For the [Linea Bridge Executor](https://lineascan.build/address/0x74Be82F00CC867614803ffd7f36A2a4aF0405670)\n    - `getEthereumGovernanceExecutor` is the [Lido DAO Agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n- A bridge admin and `owner` on L1 is the [Linea Security Council](https://etherscan.io/address/0x892bb7EeD71efB060ab90140e7825d8127991DD3)\n    - proxy admin for L1 TokenBridge\n    - `owner` for L1 TokenBridge\n- A bridge admin and `owner` on L2 is the [Linea Security Council](https://lineascan.build/address/0xf5cc7604a5ef3565b4d2050d65729a06b68aa0bd)\n    - Proxy admin for L2 TokenBridge\n    - `owner` for L2 TokenBridge\n- For the proposed wstETH token on L2 ([CustomBridgedToken](https://lineascan.build/address/0xB5beDd42000b71FddE22D3eE8a79Bd49A568fC8F))\n    - Currently, the [Linea Security Council](https://lineascan.build/address/0xf5cc7604a5ef3565b4d2050d65729a06b68aa0bd) is the proxy admin.

      "title": "Should the Lido DAO recognize the wstETH Bridge Endpoints on zkSync Era as canonical?",
      "content": "## **Introduction**\n\nThe proposal is to recognize the wstETH token bridging endpoints on zkSync Era by the Lido DAO. If Snapshot passes, the Lido DAO will control the endpoints of wstETH token contract (including the token contract on zkSync Era itself) as a proxy admin.  Lido DAO will only have the upgrade authority of the wstETH proxy contract, and will not be able to manage the native bridge itself.\n\nMatter Labs proposed the deployment of wstETH (Wrapped staked ETH) to zkSync Era, with the ultimate goal of recognizing the wstETH token bridging endpoints by the Lido DAO.\n\n## **Namely:**\n\n1. [Upgrade authority set to the Lido DAO Aragon Agent contract on L1 and L2](https://docs.lido.fi/deployed-contracts/#lido-v2-dao-contracts)\n2. [Pausability by Emergency Brakes multisig](https://docs.lido.fi/deployed-contracts/#emergency-brakes-multisigs).\n\nThis initiative has been undertaken by the Matter Labs & TxFusion team who deployed the wstETH components for the zkSync’s native bridge to zkSync, inspired by the same open-source solution previously applied in the Optimism deployment.\n\nThe [proposed components](https://docs.lido.fi/deployed-contracts/#zksync-era) utilize zkSync’s native bridge instance for the message transfer. The token’s upgradeability is possible, due to the token proxy admin being set to Lido DAO and separate from the bridge admin (zkSync Era) instance. This approach aligns with the unofficial guidelines presented by [NEW (Network Expansion Workgroup)](https://research.lido.fi/t/unofficial-guidelines-for-bridging-solutions-network-expansion-workgroup/5790) and is future-ready for wstETH. As such, neither the bridge or Lido DAO take any additional fees from users. The regular gas fees required for transaction execution will still be charged to the user.\nIn case of an emergency, Lido Emergency Breaks multisig will be used to pause the deposits and withdrawals only for the wstETH transfers. In order to resume the bridging activity for wstETH, there will be a need for a Lido DAO on chain vote on Ethereum mainnet.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nzkSync Era Mainnet was launched on March 24, 2023. zkSync currently crossed over $440M TVL (grown +50% in the last four months), and unique wallets have crossed 3.7M. Transaction volume has averaged +15% week-over-week growth the last four months with a few times surpassing Ethereum itself on daily transactions.\n\nThis marks just the beginning with key network infrastructure upgrades coming within the next few months which will catalyze growth of TVL, users and transaction growth, as many protocols will now be able to launch.\n\nLido wstETH has the overwhelming market share of staked ETH and can be used interoperably in DeFi. Therefore, major ecosystems such as zkSync have significant demand for wstETH as it opens up opportunities for users to utilize stETH holdings in various DeFi protocols. Some examples include using wstETH as collateral, lending, indexing, minting, vaults, stables, etc.\n\nTaking a page from the Optimism playbook, we're leveraging an open-source solution (check out [GitHub](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-l2)) to make this happen.\n\nWe're proposing that the Lido DAO formally recognizes these bridging endpoints as canonical. Canonical means native/default. In the bridging context, a canonical token is the one that is minted by the native bridge such as zkSync’s native bridge in this case.\n\n## **Audits**\n\nTo better form an opinion you may consider reading through the following audit reports.\n\n[Cantina audit report](https://github.com/txfusion/lido-l2/blob/main/zksync/audits/lido-on-zkSync-audit-report.pdf)\n\n[Reference to the levers and ACL setup](https://research.lido.fi/t/wsteth-deployment-on-zksync/5701/7)\n\n## **Mainnet Contracts**\n\n**Previously existing Lido contracts on Ethereum:**\n\n- DAO Agent on L1: [0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n- Emergency Brakes 3/5 Multisig on L1: [0x73b047fe6337183A454c5217241D780a932777bD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x73b047fe6337183A454c5217241D780a932777bD)\n- wstETH on L1: [0x7f39C581F595B53c5cb19bD0b3f8dA6c935E2Ca0](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7f39C581F595B53c5cb19bD0b3f8dA6c935E2Ca0)\n\n**Newly deployed contracts on Ethereum:**\n\n- L1ERC20Bridge: [0x41527B2d03844dB6b0945f25702cB958b6d55989](https://etherscan.io/address/0x41527B2d03844dB6b0945f25702cB958b6d55989)\n- L1Executor: [0xFf7F4d05e3247374e86A3f7231A2Ed1CA63647F2](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFf7F4d05e3247374e86A3f7231A2Ed1CA63647F2)\n\n**Newly deployed contracts on zkSync Era:**\n\n- Emergency Brakes 3/5 Multisig on L2: [0x0D7F0A811978B3B62CbfF4EF6149B5909EAcfE94](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x0D7F0A811978B3B62CbfF4EF6149B5909EAcfE94)\n- wstETH on L2: [0x703b52F2b28fEbcB60E1372858AF5b18849FE867](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x703b52F2b28fEbcB60E1372858AF5b18849FE867)\n- L2ERC20Bridge: [0xE1D6A50E7101c8f8db77352897Ee3f1AC53f782B](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0xE1D6A50E7101c8f8db77352897Ee3f1AC53f782B)\n- ZkSyncBridgeExecutor: [0x139EE25DCad405d2a038E7A67f9ffdbf0f573f3c](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x139EE25DCad405d2a038E7A67f9ffdbf0f573f3c)\n\n**Deployment artefacts and levers setup:**\n\n- for [L1Executor](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFf7F4d05e3247374e86A3f7231A2Ed1CA63647F2)\n    - Proxy admin is the [Lido DAO Agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n    - owner is the [Lido DAO Agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n- for [ZkSyncBridgeExecutor](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x139EE25DCad405d2a038E7A67f9ffdbf0f573f3c)\n    - Proxy admin is [aliased](https://era.zksync.io/docs/api/go/utils.html#applyl1tol2alias) (L1Executor) via ProxyAdmin\n    - [getEthereumGovernanceExecutor](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x139EE25DCad405d2a038E7A67f9ffdbf0f573f3c#contract) is [aliased](https://era.zksync.io/docs/api/go/utils.html#applyl1tol2alias) (L1Executor) (admin)\n- A bridge admin and role holder on L1 is the [Lido DAO Agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n    - Proxy admin for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_ENABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - DEPOSITS_ENABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n- A bridge admin and role holder on L2 is the [ZkSyncBridgeExecutor](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x139EE25DCad405d2a038E7A67f9ffdbf0f573f3c)\n    - Proxy admin for L2ERC20Bridge\n    - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for L2ERC20Bridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20Bridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_ENABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20Bridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20Bridge\n    - DEPOSITS_ENABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20Bridge\n- for [ERC20BridgedUpgradeable](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x703b52F2b28fEbcB60E1372858AF5b18849FE867) (wstETH on L1)\n    - Proxy admin is [aliased](https://era.zksync.io/docs/api/go/utils.html#applyl1tol2alias) (L1Executor) via ProxyAdmin\n- Emergency breaks msig on L1 is [0x73b047fe6337183A454c5217241D780a932777bD](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x2b368b535b2024394daff218d222e260dbc4543b6d4e49aa4700cc0a9233e86a) , 3/5 threshold:\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n- Emergency breaks msig on L2 is a new one [0x0D7F0A811978B3B62CbfF4EF6149B5909EAcfE94](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=zksync%3A0x0D7F0A811978B3B62CbfF4EF6149B5909EAcfE94) inheriting the same EOAs as for L1, 3/5 threshold:\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20Bridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20Bridge",

      "title": "Decision on InfStones Continued Participation in Curated NO Set",
      "content": "**Proposal**\n\nOn Nov 22, Lido DAO contributors were made aware of two platform vulnerabilities in the validator infrastructure of one of the Curated Set Node Operators (InfStones) that utilize the Lido on Ethereum Protocol.\n\nAs a result of the mutual understanding of the potential implications of the vulnerabilities, the Node Operator volunteered to exit the validators out of an abundance of caution. The stake for the 10,001 validators that they were operating has since begun flowing back into the Lido on Ethereum Protocol through the Lido Withdrawal Vault.\n\nFurther information about this investigation and resulting actions can be found [here](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-on-ethereum-node-operator-infstones-platform-vulnerability-investigation-november-22-2023/6001).\n\nInfStones [has posted a response](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-on-ethereum-node-operator-infstones-platform-vulnerability-investigation-november-22-2023/6001/4) on the Lido research forums indicating their understanding and approach regarding the infrastructure vulnerabilities; and has stated that the relevant gaps have been remediated. Additionally, InfStones indicate that they have now set up a bug bounty program that covers their infrastructure, and have also completed a SOC 2 Type 1 audit using an external third party, and have additionally indicated that they will conduct a pentest with a third party, with the results to be shared with the DAO once available.\n\nAdditionally, they agreed to:\n\n- Reset their validators limit (i.e. preventing any new deposits from being allocated to them) (done), and\n- Remove any previously submitted validator keys from the node operator registry (in progress) prior to submitting new keys.\n\nAt this juncture, the DAO is asked to decide on the below:\n\n- Is the DAO satisfied that the Node Operator has appropriately remediated the issues in their infra such that InfStones should remain in the Curated Operator Set?\n- If so, when should the Node Operator resume submitting validator keys to the Node Operator Registry?\n\n**Voting Instructions**\n\nThis is a single-option vote.\n\n- If you believe that the Node Operator has shown enough evidence that the vulnerability has been remediated and can resume submitting keys in a guarded fashion (i.e. through a kind of probationary period, see Next Steps below), vote “**Resume key submission**”.\n- If you believe that the Node Operator should be removed from the Node Operator set, vote “**Remove InfStones from NO Set**”.\n- If you believe that additional time is needed to assess the question (e.g. because there is not enough information), vote “**Additional time required**”.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\nIf the “**Resume key submission**” reaches quorum, then the Node Operator will resume key submission at their convenience and raise their validator limit in a guarded manner while awaiting the penetration testing results. This will entail a probationary period during which: (a) no further similar vulnerability should be identified, and (b) no hacking / slashing incidents should occur, and (c) the quantity of active validators cannot exceed 2,500 validators. The probationary period will last until the 3rd party penetration test results are provided to the DAO. InfStones will communicate these actions to the DAO via research forums to ensure that there are no objections to the pace of key submission.\n\nIf the “**Remove InfStones from NO Set**” option reaches quorum, a separate on-chain vote will be required to deactivate the Node Operator.\n\nIf the “**Additional time required**” option reaches quorum, a new discussion will commence on the forums so that the details of additional investigation and follow-up to be performed can be agreed. Voters who voted this option are requested to opine on the forums about what kinds of additional information or analysis would help to reach a decision, with the view of being able to have another vote on the matter in early 2024 (e.g. by mid January).",

      "title": "Lido Community Staking Module",
      "content": "The Lido Community Staking team is seeking signal approval of the [Community Staking Module](https://hackmd.io/@lido/Byp775Ay6) (CSM) design from the Lido DAO. The module will allow permissionless entry to the Lido on Ethereum validator set with a bond requirement.\n\nLido on Ethereum currently has a curated set of node operators; at the current stage DAO has approved [Simple DVT module signal proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xf3ac657484444f0b54eba2c251135c47f875e3d1821496247d11bdd7fab0f291), which is planned to launch in Q1 2024. And the next step towards decentralization is CSM!\n\nIn case of approval, the Community Staking team will carry out further research and development of the module proposed, and the mainnet release, along with all the parameters, would be proposed for the Lido DAO approval in the on-chain vote for the upgrade closer to the end of 2024.\n\n## **High-level design**\n\nHigh-level design is described in detail in the [Community staking landscape](https://hackmd.io/@lido/Byp775Ay6) and discussed on the [Lido research forum](https://research.lido.fi/t/community-staking-module/5917).\n\nKey points of high-level design are:\n\n1. Permissionless entry with bond\n2. Only ETH (stETH) as a bond token\n3. “Non-linear” bond scaling for Node Operators\n4. First in, first out stake allocation queue\n5. Performance oracle with performance threshold approach for solo staker friendly rewards distribution\n\nWhereas the high-level design of the module is developed, several things must be researched and finalized before the module implementation. Namely:\n\n- Actual bond size and possible bond reduction schemes\n- Lido on Ethereum core protocol upgrades required for CSM\n- Particular parameters for the mainnet launch\n\n## Stake allocation strategy\n\nAs a part of the design of the module, it’s also important to consider the module’s position in the overall landscape of the Staking Router. As the module is meant to both (a) allow for node operators to permissionlessly use the protocol, as well as (b) encourage such usage by community stakers (solo stakers and smaller organizations who are staking in a non-professional capacity), it is suggested that the DAO approve the below module stake threshold rationale (which it can later revise should it wish):\n\n- At launch and for a period no longer than 12 months, the module shall not exceed a 1% stake allocation threshold until module robustness is considered sufficient by the DAO;\n- If the module reaches capacity before the 12-month mark and is assessed by the DAO to be robust and secure, the DAO shall consider a proposal to increase the module’s threshold from 1% to 2%;\n- Further, if the module continues to perform well and there is demand from node operators for its use, the DAO shall consider gradually increasing the stake threshold, up to a maximum of 10% of total ETH staked with the Lido protocol.\n\n## **Partnerships**\n\nAs outlined in the research forum post, in case of approval, the Community Staking team will look for [LEGO](https://lido.fi/lego) support to provide grants for the ecosystem partners to develop integrations and supplementary tools for CSM. The main focus will be on hardware and tooling to help stakers run validators, primary at home. Multiple teams, namely [DAppNode](https://dappnode.com/), [Nimbus](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-gui), [eBunker](https://enode.ebunker.io/), [Sedge](https://github.com/NethermindEth/sedge), [Ethereum on ARM](https://ethereum-on-arm-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [eth-docker](https://eth-docker.net/) have already indicated their support and desire to integrate CSM.\n\n## **Security audits & checks**\n\nAs security is of paramount concern, the Community Staking team aims to have at least 2 security audits of the CSM code. Actual auditors will be defined later by the [Lido Audits Committee](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-on-ethereum-form-audits-committee/3481).\n\n## **Expected timeline**\n\nIn case of approval, the CS team will proceed with the research and development of the module in Q1-Q2 2024, and regularly report progress on the research forum. After that, the code will be submitted for security audits. The estimated date for the audits to start is late Q2 2024.\n\nBased on this timeline, Holesky testnet deployment for the module & test runs of different scenarios for the on-chain and off-chain tooling are assumed to happen in Q2-Q3 2024. Note that the timing heavily depends on the actual development progress, so the dates are approximate at this time.\n\nThe mainnet module release will be scheduled closer to the end of 2024 based on the results of the testnet. The goal is to have at least two finalized security audits and full testnet runs to safeguard module security and compatibility with the Lido on Ethereum core protocol.\n\n## **Signal your support**\n\nCommunity Staking Module will allow permissionless entry to the Lido on Ethereum validator set. This will open previously unavailable avenues for validator set decentralization and diversification. The Lido Community Staking team working on the CSM is asking the DAO community to signal support for the module design and further research and development.\n\n## What approval means?\n\nApproval of the snapshot means approval of the following items:\n\n- High level design of Community Staking Module\n- Proposed stake allocation scheme\n- Proposed partnerships scheme\n- Further research and development of CSM including audits",

      "title": "Should the Lido DAO recognize the wstETH Bridge Endpoints on Linea as canonical?",
      "content": "The proposal is to recognize the wstETH token bridging endpoints on Linea by the Lido DAO. If Snapshot passes, the Lido DAO will be the wstETH token proxy admin on Linea. Lido DAO will only have the upgrade authority of the wstETH proxy contract, and will not be able to manage the native bridge itself.\n\nLinea, a zkEVM developed by Consensys, submits this proposal to seek Lido DAO’s formal recognition of the [deployed wstETH token](https://lineascan.build/address/0xB5beDd42000b71FddE22D3eE8a79Bd49A568fC8F) as canonical on Linea and to request the DAO’s recognition of the Lido-specific bridge contracts. Canonical means native/default. In the bridging context, a canonical token is the one that is minted by the native bridge such as Linea’s native bridge in this case.\n\nThe [proposed components](https://docs.lido.fi/deployed-contracts/#linea) utilize Linea’s native bridge instance for the message transfer. The architecture, is distinct from the usual custom token gateways used for wstETH on L2, involves using a shared bridge instance managed by Linea. Importantly, the token’s upgradeability is maintained, with the token proxy admin being separate (Lido DAO) from the bridge admin (Linea’s Security Council) instance. This approach aligns with the unofficial guidelines presented by the [NEW (Network Expansion Workgroup)](https://research.lido.fi/t/unofficial-guidelines-for-bridging-solutions-network-expansion-workgroup/5790) and is future-ready for wstETH. As such, neither the bridge nor Lido DAO take any additional fees from users. The regular gas fees required for transaction execution will still be charged to the user.\nIn case of an emergency, Linea’s Security Council has [permission](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/linea#permissions) to pause and unpause the entire bridge, which also pauses wstETH deposits and withdrawals.\n\n### Motivation\n\n[stETH](https://etherscan.io/token/0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84) has become a cornerstone asset in the Ethereum ecosystem, boasting a market capitalization of $17B and over 250,000 holders. Acknowledging its essential role and the growing demand throughout the Ethereum community, its introduction into a new platform is strategically targeted to benefit stETH holders, particularly in the Layer 2 and DeFi space where stETH is presented through its wrapped version (wstETH). As a key asset, wstETH plays a vital role in DeFi activities across network segments.\n\n### Audits\n\nTo better form an opinion you may consider reading through the following audit reports.\n\n| Audit firm | Date | Contracts |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| OpenZeppelin | October 2023 | [Canonical Token Bridge](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/linea-bridge-audit-1) |\n| Diligence | October 2023 | [LineaBridgeExecutor](https://consensys.io/diligence/audits/private/1zps18ccw1anbm/) |\n| Diligence | June 2023 | [Canonical Token Bridge](https://consensys.io/diligence/audits/2023/06/linea-canonical-token-bridge) |\n| Diligence | June 2023 | [Linea Message Service](https://consensys.io/diligence/audits/2023/06/linea-message-service) |\n| Mixed | - | [All Other Audits](https://immunefi.com/bounty/linea/) |\n\n### Mainnet contracts\n\nEthereum\n\n- DAO Agent on L1: [0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n- wstETH on L1: [0x7f39C581F595B53c5cb19bD0b3f8dA6c935E2Ca0](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7f39C581F595B53c5cb19bD0b3f8dA6c935E2Ca0)\n- L1 Token Bridge (*Canonical Bridge*): [0x051f1d88f0af5763fb888ec4378b4d8b29ea3319](https://etherscan.io/address/0x051f1d88f0af5763fb888ec4378b4d8b29ea3319)\n\nLinea\n\n- LineaBridgeExecutor: [0x74Be82F00CC867614803ffd7f36A2a4aF0405670](https://lineascan.build/address/0x74Be82F00CC867614803ffd7f36A2a4aF0405670#code)\n- ProxyAdmin for wstETH: [0xF951d7592e03eDB0Bab3D533935e678Ce64Eb927](https://lineascan.build/address/0xF951d7592e03eDB0Bab3D533935e678Ce64Eb927#code)\n- wstETH on L2: [0xB5beDd42000b71FddE22D3eE8a79Bd49A568fC8F](https://lineascan.build/address/0xB5beDd42000b71FddE22D3eE8a79Bd49A568fC8F)\n- L2 Token Bridge (*Canonical Bridge*): [0x353012dc4a9a6cf55c941badc267f82004a8ceb9](https://lineascan.build/address/0x353012dc4a9a6cf55c941badc267f82004a8ceb9)\n\n### Levers setup\n\nThe levers and proxy admins are prepared to set the admin role of the wstETH token contract to the Lido DAO, contingent on successful snapshot approval.\n\n- For the [Linea Bridge Executor](https://lineascan.build/address/0x74Be82F00CC867614803ffd7f36A2a4aF0405670)\n    - `getEthereumGovernanceExecutor` is the [Lido DAO Agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n- A bridge admin and `owner` on L1 is the [Linea Security Council](https://etherscan.io/address/0x892bb7EeD71efB060ab90140e7825d8127991DD3)\n    - proxy admin for L1 TokenBridge\n    - `owner` for L1 TokenBridge\n- A bridge admin and `owner` on L2 is the [Linea Security Council](https://lineascan.build/address/0xf5cc7604a5ef3565b4d2050d65729a06b68aa0bd)\n    - Proxy admin for L2 TokenBridge\n    - `owner` for L2 TokenBridge\n- For the proposed wstETH token on L2 ([CustomBridgedToken](https://lineascan.build/address/0xB5beDd42000b71FddE22D3eE8a79Bd49A568fC8F))\n    - Currently, the [Linea Security Council](https://lineascan.build/address/0xf5cc7604a5ef3565b4d2050d65729a06b68aa0bd) is the proxy admin.

      "title": "Should the Lido DAO recognize the wstETH Bridge Endpoints on Mantle as canonical?",
      "content": "**The proposal** is to recognize the wstETH token bridging endpoints for Mantle by the Lido DAO as canonical. If Snapshot passes, the Lido DAO will control the endpoints of wstETH token contract (including the token contract on Mantle itself) as a proxy admin. Lido DAO will only have the upgrade authority of the wstETH proxy contract, and will not be able to manage the native bridge itself.\n\nThe Mantle Core Contributor Team is submitting this proposal to the community for the deployment of wstETH on Mantle.\n\n[Mantle Network](https://mantle.xyz/) is an optimistic Ethereum layer-2 (L2) solution with an EVM-compatible execution environment. Mantle is DAO-governed and employs a modular approach to execution, consensus, settlement, and data availability. In addition to a burgeoning ecosystem with 110+ dApps and counting, Mantle counts among its partners Game7, HyperPlay, EduDAO, Sozu Haus, and EigenLayer. The DAO-led community-driven Mantle possesses one of the largest on-chain treasuries — and the largest when discounting native tokens — including nearly 270K ETH/wstETH/WETH, priming it to be a major player in ETH LST and LSDFi.\n\n### Motivation\n\nDemand for Lido (w)stETH is significantly driven by its utility within major ecosystems, which are leveraging its composability in various DeFi protocols. Notably, wstETH’s overwhelming market share of staked ETH enhances its desirability. Additionally, wstETH’s versatility, being used for a range of DeFi applications including collateral, lending, farming, indexing, minting, vaults, and stables, amplifies its demand further. Mantle aims to leverage this demand for ETH liquid staking tokens and make wstETH one of the core building blocks of the Mantle ecosystem, as well as a core asset of its treasury to sustainably grow its protocol-owned liquidity (POL).\n\nwstETH has already been deployed onto Mantle via the native bridge. This proposed new deployment will be replacing the existing wstETH with a one-way migration pool opened for users to migrate.\n\n- Solution smart contracts\n    - [GitHub - mantlenetworkio/lido-l2](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/lido-l2/)\n\nThe [proposed components](https://docs.lido.fi/deployed-contracts/#mantle) utilize Mantle’s native bridge instance for the message transfer. The token’s upgradeability is possible, due to the token proxy admin being set to Lido DAO and separate from the bridge admin (Mantle) instance. This approach aligns with the unofficial guidelines presented by [NEW (Network Expansion Workgroup)](https://research.lido.fi/t/unofficial-guidelines-for-bridging-solutions-network-expansion-workgroup/5790) and is future-ready for wstETH. As such, neither the bridge or Lido DAO take any additional fees from users. The regular gas fees required for transaction execution will still be charged to the user.\nIn case of an emergency, Lido Emergency Breaks multisig will be used to pause the deposits and withdrawals only for the wstETH transfers. In order to resume the bridging activity for wstETH, there will be a need for a Lido DAO on chain vote on Ethereum mainnet.\n\n## Audits\n\nTo better form an opinion you may consider reading through the following audit reports.\n\n- [Governance crosschain bridges (OptimismBridgeExecutor)](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits/blob/main/Oxorio%20Governance%20Crosschain%20Bridges%20Smart%20Contracts%20Security%20Audit%20Report%2008-2022.pdf)\n- [wstETH on Mantle (L1ERC20TokenBridge, L2ERC20TokenBridge, ERC20BridgedPermit)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wbmD-sg_LYu2tWVp2YWjydltDF4OlueG/view?usp=sharing)\n\n## Contracts\n\n- Mainnet contracts:\n    - L1ERC20TokenBridge Impl: [0x6fBBe1Af52D22557D7F161Dc5952E306F4742e23](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6fBBe1Af52D22557D7F161Dc5952E306F4742e23)\n    - L1ERC20TokenBridge Proxy: [0x2D001d79E5aF5F65a939781FE228B267a8Ed468B](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2D001d79E5aF5F65a939781FE228B267a8Ed468B)\n    - ERC20Bridged Impl: [0x1FaBaAec88198291A4efCc85Cabb33a3785165ba](https://explorer.mantle.xyz/address/0x1FaBaAec88198291A4efCc85Cabb33a3785165ba)\n    - ERC20Bridged Proxy: [0x458ed78EB972a369799fb278c0243b25e5242A83](https://explorer.mantle.xyz/address/0x458ed78EB972a369799fb278c0243b25e5242A83)\n    - L2ERC20TokenBridge Impl: [0xf10A7ffC613a9b23Abc36167925A375bf5986181](https://explorer.mantle.xyz/address/0xf10A7ffC613a9b23Abc36167925A375bf5986181)\n    - L2ERC20TokenBridge Proxy: [0x9c46560D6209743968cC24150893631A39AfDe4d](https://explorer.mantle.xyz/address/0x9c46560D6209743968cC24150893631A39AfDe4d)\n    - OptimismBridgeExecutor: [0x3a7B055BF88CdC59D20D0245809C6E6B3c5819dd](https://explorer.mantle.xyz/address/0x3a7B055BF88CdC59D20D0245809C6E6B3c5819dd)\n\n## Ownership, roles, and levers Mainnet setup\n\n- for the [Mantle Governance Bridge Executor](https://explorer.mantle.xyz/address/0x3a7B055BF88CdC59D20D0245809C6E6B3c5819dd) (`OptimismBridgeExecutor` contract is used)\n    - `getEthereumGovernanceExecutor` is the [Lido DAO Agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n- A bridge admin and role holder on L1 is the [Lido DAO Agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n    - Proxy admin for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_ENABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - DEPOSITS_ENABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n- A bridge admin and role holder on L2 is the [Mantle Governance Bridge Executor](https://explorer.mantle.xyz/address/0x3a7B055BF88CdC59D20D0245809C6E6B3c5819dd)\n    - Proxy admin for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_ENABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_ENABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n- for the proposed wstETH token on L2 ([ERC20BridgedPermit](http://explorer.mantle.xyz/address/0x458ed78eb972a369799fb278c0243b25e5242a83))\n    - Proxy admin is the [Mantle Governance Bridge Executor](https://explorer.mantle.xyz/address/0x3a7B055BF88CdC59D20D0245809C6E6B3c5819dd)\n- [Emergency breaks msig on L1](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x2b368b535b2024394daff218d222e260dbc4543b6d4e49aa4700cc0a9233e86a) is [0x73b047fe6337183A454c5217241D780a932777bD](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x73b047fe6337183A454c5217241D780a932777bD), 3/5 threshold:\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n- Emergency breaks msig on L2 is a new one [0xa8579D42E34398267dE16e6eeeCdb7ED0EFF953C](https://multisig.mantle.xyz/home?safe=mantle:0xa8579D42E34398267dE16e6eeeCdb7ED0EFF953C) inheriting the same EOAs as for L1, 3/5 threshold:\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n- An initial deployer has no remaining permissions and levers assigned",

      "title": "Should the Lido DAO accept ownership of wstETH Bridge Components on zkSync Era?",
      "content": "# **Introduction**\n\nThe proposal is to accept the ownership of the wstETH bridging on zkSync Era components by the Lido DAO. If Snapshot passes, the management of the wstETH bridging components is set to be performed by the Lido DAO.\n\nMatter Labs proposed the deployment of wstETH (Wrapped staked ETH) to zkSync Era, with the ultimate goal of acceptance of ownership of the wstETH bridging components by the Lido DAO. \n\n## Namely:\n\n1. [Upgrade authority owned by Lido DAO Aragon Agent contract on L1 and L2](https://docs.lido.fi/deployed-contracts/#lido-v2-dao-contracts) \n\n2. [Pausability by Emergency Brakes multisig](https://docs.lido.fi/deployed-contracts/#emergency-brakes-multisigs).\n\nThis initiative has been undertaken by the Matter Labs & TxFusion team who deployed the wstETH canonical bridge to zkSync, inspired by the same open-source solution previously applied in the Optimism deployment.\n\nThis marks a historical milestone for zkSync and its ecosystem! It’s the first zk rollup proposed to be endorsed by Lido DAO for wstETH, and we’re incredibly proud to be part of this journey alongside the Lido DAO, a true market leader.\n\n## Motivation\nzkSync Era Mainnet was launched on March 24, 2023. zkSync currently crossed over $440M TVL (grown +50% in the last four months), and unique wallets have crossed 3.7M. Transaction volume has averaged +15% week-over-week growth the last four months with a few times surpassing Ethereum itself on daily transactions.\nThis marks just the beginning with key network infrastructure upgrades coming within the next few months which will catalyze growth of TVL, users and transaction growth, as many protocols will now be able to launch.\n\nLido wstETH has the overwhelming market share of staked ETH and can be used interoperably in DeFi. Therefore, major ecosystems such as zkSync have significant demand for wstETH as it opens up opportunities for users to utilize stETH holdings in various DeFi protocols. Some examples include using wstETH as collateral, lending, indexing, minting, vaults, stables, etc.\n\nTaking a page from the Optimism playbook, we're leveraging an open-source solution (check out [GitHub](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-l2)) to make this happen.\n\nLido DAO is stepping up to manage the wstETH bridging components. You can find the details in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lidofinance/governance-crosschain-bridges).\n\nWe're proposing that the Lido DAO formally takes ownership of these bridging components.\n\n## Audits\n[Cantina audit report](https://github.com/txfusion/lido-l2/blob/main/zksync/audits/lido-on-zkSync-audit-report.pdf)\n\n[Reference to the levers and ACL setup](https://research.lido.fi/t/wsteth-deployment-on-zksync/5701/7)\n\n## Mainnet Contracts\n**Previously existing Lido contracts on Ethereum:**\n\n- DAO Agent on L1: [0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n- Emergency Brakes 3/5 Multisig on L1: [0x73b047fe6337183A454c5217241D780a932777bD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x73b047fe6337183A454c5217241D780a932777bD)\n- wstETH on L1: [0x7f39C581F595B53c5cb19bD0b3f8dA6c935E2Ca0](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7f39C581F595B53c5cb19bD0b3f8dA6c935E2Ca0)\n\n**Newly deployed contracts on Ethereum:**\n\n- L1ERC20Bridge: [0x41527B2d03844dB6b0945f25702cB958b6d55989](https://etherscan.io/address/0x41527B2d03844dB6b0945f25702cB958b6d55989)\n- L1Executor: [0xFf7F4d05e3247374e86A3f7231A2Ed1CA63647F2](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFf7F4d05e3247374e86A3f7231A2Ed1CA63647F2)\n\n**Newly deployed contracts on zkSync Era:**\n\n- Emergency Brakes 3/5 Multisig on L2: [0x0D7F0A811978B3B62CbfF4EF6149B5909EAcfE94](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x0D7F0A811978B3B62CbfF4EF6149B5909EAcfE94)\n- wstETH on L2: [0x703b52F2b28fEbcB60E1372858AF5b18849FE867](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x703b52F2b28fEbcB60E1372858AF5b18849FE867)\n- L2ERC20Bridge: [0xE1D6A50E7101c8f8db77352897Ee3f1AC53f782B](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0xE1D6A50E7101c8f8db77352897Ee3f1AC53f782B)\n- ZkSyncBridgeExecutor: [0x139EE25DCad405d2a038E7A67f9ffdbf0f573f3c](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x139EE25DCad405d2a038E7A67f9ffdbf0f573f3c)\n\n**Deployment artefacts and levers setup:**\n\n- for [L1Executor](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFf7F4d05e3247374e86A3f7231A2Ed1CA63647F2)\n    - Proxy admin is the [Lido DAO Agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n    - owner is the [Lido DAO Agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n- for [ZkSyncBridgeExecutor](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x139EE25DCad405d2a038E7A67f9ffdbf0f573f3c)\n    - Proxy admin is [aliased](https://era.zksync.io/docs/api/go/utils.html#applyl1tol2alias) (L1Executor) via ProxyAdmin\n    - [getEthereumGovernanceExecutor](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x139EE25DCad405d2a038E7A67f9ffdbf0f573f3c#contract) is [aliased](https://era.zksync.io/docs/api/go/utils.html#applyl1tol2alias) (L1Executor) (admin)\n- A bridge admin and role holder on L1 is the [Lido DAO Agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n     - Proxy admin for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_ENABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - DEPOSITS_ENABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n- A bridge admin and role holder on L2 is the [ZkSyncBridgeExecutor](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x139EE25DCad405d2a038E7A67f9ffdbf0f573f3c)\n     - Proxy admin for L2ERC20Bridge\n    - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for L2ERC20Bridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20Bridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_ENABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20Bridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20Bridge\n    - DEPOSITS_ENABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20Bridge\n- for [ERC20BridgedUpgradeable](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x703b52F2b28fEbcB60E1372858AF5b18849FE867) (wstETH on L1)\n    - Proxy admin is [aliased](https://era.zksync.io/docs/api/go/utils.html#applyl1tol2alias) (L1Executor) via ProxyAdmin\n- Emergency breaks msig on L1 is [0x73b047fe6337183A454c5217241D780a932777bD](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xfe2a6a6506a642b616118363bc29aa83dd9ef2ec80447bb607a8f52c0a96aed0) , 3/5 threshold:\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20Bridge\n- Emergency breaks msig on L2 is a new one [0x0D7F0A811978B3B62CbfF4EF6149B5909EAcfE94](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=zksync%3A0x0D7F0A811978B3B62CbfF4EF6149B5909EAcfE94) inheriting the same EOAs as for L1, 3/5 threshold:\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20Bridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20Bridge",

      "content": "Following a [discussion of the draft proposal on the Lido Research forum](https://research.lido.fi/t/staking-router-module-proposal-simple-dvt/5625) for the Simple DVT Module, the advancement of the proposed module is now up for Snapshot vote by the Lido DAO.\n\n**The vote will consider two main components:**\n\n**1. Should the Lido DAO add the Simple DVT module as described within the proposal?**\n**2. Should potential module slashing penalties be covered by the DAO cover fund or explicitly purchased & scoped by third-party cover?**\n\nThe vote will cover these questions in a multiple choice format:\n  1a. Deploy Simple DVT\n  1b. Do not deploy Simple DVT\n  2a. Use Lido cover fund\n  2b. Use 3rd party cover provider\n\n*Voters should first select between options 1a and 1b to determine if the module should be deployed on mainnet following a successful testnet. For voters that choose option 1a, they should also vote on whether to utilize the Lido cover fund (2a) or 3rd party cover provider (2b). Voters that choose option 1b can skip voting on options 2a and 2b. If option 2b is chosen, a subsequent vote will be held to determine the 3rd party cover provider.*\n\nIf option 1a passes with quorum, the risk mitigation option with the highest number of votes between 2a and 2b will be chosen as the path forward.\n\nBelow is a summary of the proposal and excerpts of certain sections from the Simple DVT policy for summary purposes. Voters are encouraged to read the proposal on the Lido Research forums [here](https://research.lido.fi/t/staking-router-module-proposal-simple-dvt/5625) or IPFS upload [here](https://lido.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaZLYYJywrpuVWYGVuK1vLsqSkLW6v8xXs2zLnNGHKjiB).\n\n# Staking Router Module Proposal: Simple DVT\n\n## Proposal Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks **DAO approval for the addition of a new module that will utilize Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) on mainnet** through Obol Network and SSV Network implementations. This module will be referred to as the “Simple DVT” module, due to the manual coordination and curation required to adopt this early-stage technology, and to reflect that this module is not intended for indefinite and “at-scale” use. This module would initially be capped at 0.5% of total Lido stake.\n\nDVT represents the fastest way to add many new Node Operators to the Lido Node Operator set with a more diverse profile of solo and community staker participants while benefiting from the technology’s inherent benefits such as increased resilience, distribution, and security. The Simple DVT module is intended to demonstrate that utilizing DVT on mainnet is possible, while furthering the diversification of the Lido Node Operator set on Ethereum and potentially setting the stage for more scalable and permissionless DVT-based modules in the near future.\n\nSolo stakers, community stakers, existing node operators using Lido protocol, and other staking organizations would participate in the upcoming 3rd Lido DVT testnet utilizing Obol and SSV DVT solutions. Following a review of individual and cluster performance, the Lido Node Operator Subgovernance Group (LNOSG), with input from Obol and SSV, would be responsible for finalizing clusters to participate in a mainnet deployment.\n\nThe LNOSG would propose the cluster combinations for DAO discussion, and if no significant issues are identified, a committee known as the Simple DVT Module Committee would be responsible for adding these Node Operators to the mainnet registry and increasing validator limits per cluster.\n\nThe number of clusters and amount of validators operated per cluster would initially be minimal (e.g. 24 clusters running 5 validators each), leaving time for the Simple DVT Module Committee and DAO to monitor performance and assess the impact to the protocol. If the distributed validators demonstrate performance in-line with the broader Ethereum network, additional clusters could be added to mainnet and the number of validators per cluster would be increased.\n\nAfter at least three months of mainnet performance comparable to the overall operator set, the LNOSG would also meet to discuss and potentially recommend increasing the number of validators operated by clusters to more meaningful levels (e.g. 100+), considering factors such as cluster performance and the make-up of participants.\n\nThe Staking Router technical [documentation outlines two reward share components: the module fee and treasury fee](https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/staking-router/#fee-distribution). To incentivize Node Operator participation and provide continued support to DVT providers, it is proposed that the treasury fee for the Simple DVT Module is set to 2% and the module fee (paid to Node Operators and the DVT provider) is set to 8%. This reflects the limited economic attractiveness of running a small number of validators with multiple cluster participants and the desire to support continued development of DVT, while taking into account the limited amount of stake the Simple DVT Module will contain and the intent to wind-down the module in the medium-term.\n\nDuring the discussion period of this proposal, the **DAO should also consider the choice of two risk mitigation approaches** that will be included in the vote:\n\n1. DAO approval for the current (or future) cover fund to be utilized in the case of material impact to stETH stakers, with a maximum cover of up to [4 ETH per validator](https://research.lido.fi/t/risk-assessment-for-community-staking/5502).\n2. Open an RFP process for interested cover providers to provide risk mitigation options with the subsequent DAO vote to choose between providers.\n\nIn summary, this proposal would greenlight the creation of a secondary module on mainnet (contingent upon a successful testnet deployment achievement of minimum success metrics) that would be used to allow Node Operators participating in DVT clusters using SSV Network and Obol Network technologies to use the Lido protocol to run validators. This module would be initially capped at 0.5% of Lido stake, which could be increased later by DAO vote, and be expected to be wound-down and replaced by more scalable modules over time (e.g. within approximately 2-3 years). The module would have the rewards share set at 10%, with 2% allocated to the treasury fee, and 8% to the module fee via for participating Node Operators and DVT providers.\n\nThe proposal would also grant the Simple DVT Module Committee the ability to execute Easy Track governance motions (i.e. motions that can be objected to by DAO token holders) for aiding Simple DVT cluster operations following LNOSG evaluations of upcoming DVT testnet trials.\n\n## Other Excerpts from the Proposal\n(note: some details have been removed for brevity, please see the [full proposal](https://lido.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaZLYYJywrpuVWYGVuK1vLsqSkLW6v8xXs2zLnNGHKjiB) for additional detail):\n\n## Proposed Process for Cluster Organization\n\n### Testnet Round Three\n\nThe next round of testnet trials would be organized in a manner to replicate a potential mainnet deployments as closely as possible. The majority of clusters would be in a 5/7 threshold or greater, reflecting the benefits of increased resilience and redundancy larger clusters promote.\n\nTo move forward with a mainnet deployment, the following success characteristics should be considered over a 30 to 45 day testing period:\n\n1. Uptime of at least 95.00%\n2. Successful block proposal rate of at least 70% (some flexibility is needed due to the early stage of MEV-Boost integration and outstanding questions regarding Holesky performance)\n3. Attestation effectiveness per Rated Network comparable with that of the broader Holesky validator set\n\nGiven that two separate DVT infrastructures (Obol Network and SSV Network) would underpin the distinct clusters, the success characteristics should be grouped by infra provider and considered independently.\n\nAchievement of these characteristics and a successful on-chain DAO vote to deploy the mainnet Simple DVT module would greenlight a candidate evaluation by the LNOSG for participation on mainnet and the subsequent deployment of Node Operator clusters.\n\nIn the event these performance metrics are not achieved, one of two options should be taken:\n\n1. Run another testnet round before deploying on mainnet\n2. Analysis of the testnet is presented to the DAO for discussion with an explanation of why specific criteria may not have been achieved, with a subsequent DAO vote to determine whether to proceed to mainnet or not\n\n### Mainnet\n\n**Operator Additions to the Simple DVT Module**\n\nParticipants for the mainnet clusters of the Simple DVT Module will be sourced through the third round of Lido DVT testing.\n\nThe proposal would grant a new multi-sig committee (known as the “Simple DVT Module Committee”) consisting of contributors from the Lido DAO, LNOSG, Obol Network, and SSV Network teams the ability to create and execute Easy Track motions that allow for the addition of new clusters, activation and deactivation of existing clusters, and changing of cluster properties for the Simple DVT Module\n\nThe LNOSG will be responsible for ongoing evaluations of Simple DVT Node Operators and the cluster combinations that will be used to operate validators. Factors considered will include individual Node Operator performance, infrastructure type, and geographic location.\n\nWhen the LNOSG reaches consensus, the proposed clusters will be transparently presented to the DAO via the Lido Research forum. If no major concerns are raised after a 7 day discussion period, the Simple DVT Module Committee will execute the addition of new Node Operators to the Simple DVT module.\n\n## Simple DVT Module Economics\n\nWhen considering the addition of the Simple DVT Module, the DAO should examine  taking advantage of the ability to adjust rewards share parameters as described in the Staking Router documentation in order to increase the attractiveness for cluster members as well as to compensate the DVT providers for ongoing protocol development and services to the module. The Staking Router technical [documentation outlines two reward share components: the module fee and treasury fee](https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/staking-router/#fee-distribution).\n\nIt is proposed that the total reward share for the Simple DVT module is 10%, with the treasury fee set to 2% and the module fee (shared between the  Node Operators and the DVT providers) set to 8%. This differs from the reward share structure of the Curated Operator Module where the split is 5%/5%, due to the economic differences in DVT cluster operation and the intent to keep the total stake in Simple DVT at a relatively smaller number of validators for a 2-3 year period.\n\n### Obol Network Economics\n\nObol Network will receive rewards via stETH as part of a splitter contract used for reward disbursement to Node Operators. Rewards received will represent 10% of the total share for Obol-based clusters (i.e. 1% of net Obol cluster rewards).\n\nThis disbursement method will not require any changes to the core module codebase, and will utilize an Obol Network developed splitter contract based on 0xsplits. This contract will be audited with results publicly shared before deployment on mainnet.\n\nNode Operator participation on the Obol Network does not currently require service fees, so no additional tokens are involved in the operation of the relevant clusters.\n\n### SSV Network Economics\n\nUsage of the SSV Network protocol requires Node Operators to pay SSV Network Fees and to deposit initial collateral denominated in the SSV token as [outlined in the SSV Network technical documentation](https://docs.ssv.network/learn/protocol-overview/tokenomics/fees) to operate validators using the protocol.\n\nSSV Network will receive rewards denominated in the SSV token via SSV Network Fees. As outlined in the [SSV [DIP-11] Mainnet Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/mainnet.ssvnetwork.eth/proposal/0x90af2241fb2b3b3242dfb98efb9185b5bafac00d1cb300542a107d0df4ef6e12), the SSV Network fee is currently 0.5% of Ethereum staking rewards. This will increase to 0.75% after 365 days pass from the launch of the initial configuration, and increase to 1% 730 days after the launch of the initial configuration.\n\nNode Operators participating in SSV based clusters will receive an additional 1% of the staking rewards (8% total) that will be used to cover ongoing SSV Network Fees. In addition, pending the SSV DAO grants committee’s approval, a grant will be provided to a multi-sig of SSV and Lido DAO contributors that will be responsible for allocating SSV tokens to clusters for covering the costs of the liquidation collateral and SSV network fees required for the first year of module operation, not exceeding 2,500 SSV (equals an optimistic estimation of 50 clusters running 100 validators each). If approved by the SSV grants committee, after the first year of module operation, the combined multi-sig of SSV and Lido DAO contributors will return any excess SSV tokens to the SSV DAO treasury.\n\nMembers of this multi-sig would be determined pending the approval of the SSV grants committee to process the grant, following the [processes described in the Lido DAO Ops Multisig Policy](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-dao-ops-multisigs-policy/4115), i.e. it would include at least 3 signers with a 50%+ threshold, have a dedicated forum post containing a stated purpose and operating rules, include the wallet address and participant addresses, and each participants would “apply” by sharing proof of address ownership. This forum thread will be created by the Lido DAO Operations Workstream and be cross-linked to the [Simple DVT Module proposal thread](https://research.lido.fi/t/staking-router-module-proposal-simple-dvt/5625).\n\nThis disbursement method will not require any changes to the core module codebase.\n\n## Associated Technical Risks & Mitigation\n\n### Option 1: Use the existing cover fund to mitigate risk\n\nWith 6,240 stETH currently in the [cover fund vault contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8B3f33234ABD88493c0Cd28De33D583B70beDe35), the risk to Lido stakers can be mitigated in all but a catastrophic slashing event (that would have much further impact) or if all clusters were to go offline permanently (unlikely considering the curation process for this proposed module, and the expected rollout of triggerable exits (EIP 7002) within the next year).\n\nOf note, a discussion regarding a longer-term [Surplus Management Framework](https://research.lido.fi/t/surplus-management-framework-discussion-and-draft-proposal/5454) has begun, which over time could provide additional cover via DAO revenue.\n\n### Option 2: Source third-party cover\n\nAn open RFP process is held to source cover via a third-party provider for up to e.g. 4 ETH per validator. This process includes public proposals for the DAO to consider from these providers, and if this option is chosen, a subsequent DAO vote to select the provider.\n\nTwo parties interested in providing third-party cover, Chainproof and Nexus Mutual, have responded to the forum thread sharing proposals to offer slashing cover for the Simple DVT Module.",

The proposal aims to enhance wstETH adoption in Base.\n\n### Audits\n\n- [Governance crosschain bridges (OptimismBridgeExecutor)](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits/blob/main/Oxorio%20Governance%20Crosschain%20Bridges%20Smart%20Contracts%20Security%20Audit%20Report%2008-2022.pdf)\n- [wstETH token bridge (L1ERC20TokenBridge, ERC20Bridged, L2ERC20TokenBridge)](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits/blob/main/Oxorio%20Lido%20L2%20Smart%20Contracts%20Security%20Audit%20Report%2007-2022.pdf)\n\nThe codebase used for this deployment fully matches the codebase used for wstETH on Optimism, thus additional audits were not required. [Lido technical contributors have verified that](https://research.lido.fi/t/wsteth-deployment-to-base-and-ownership-acceptance-by-lido-dao/5668/3) the on-chain code matches the original codebase.\n\n### Deployment artifacts and levers setup:\n\n**Deployments on Mainnet (L1) and Base (L2):**\n\n- OptimismBridgeExecutor on L2: [0x0E37599436974a25dDeEdF795C848d30Af46eaCF](https://basescan.org/address/0x0E37599436974a25dDeEdF795C848d30Af46eaCF#code) (Mainnet to Base decisions forwarder for the Lido DAO Agent)\n- L1ERC20TokenBridge on L1: [0x9de443AdC5A411E83F1878Ef24C3F52C61571e72](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9de443AdC5A411E83F1878Ef24C3F52C61571e72) (Mainnet token bridge part for wstETH)\n- ERC20Bridged on L2: [0xc1CBa3fCea344f92D9239c08C0568f6F2F0ee452](https://basescan.org/address/0xc1CBa3fCea344f92D9239c08C0568f6F2F0ee452) (Base representation for wstETH proposed as the canonical one)\n- L2ERC20TokenBridge on L2: [0xac9D11cD4D7eF6e54F14643a393F68Ca014287AB](https://basescan.org/address/0xac9D11cD4D7eF6e54F14643a393F68Ca014287AB) (Base token bridge part for wstETH)\n\n**Levers setup:**\n\n- OptimismBridgeExecutor\n    - [getEthereumBridgeExecutor](https://basescan.org/address/0x0E37599436974a25dDeEdF795C848d30Af46eaCF#readContract#F6) is the [Lido DAO Agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c) (admin)\n- Ultimate admin and role holder on L1 is the [Lido DAO Agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3e40D73EB977Dc6a537aF587D48316feE66E9C8c)\n    - Proxy admin for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_ENABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_ENABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n- Ultimate admin and role holder on L2 is the [OptimismBridgeExecutor](https://basescan.org/address/0x0E37599436974a25dDeEdF795C848d30Af46eaCF#readContract)\n    - Proxies admin for ERC20Bridged, L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - WITHDRAWALS_ENABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_ENABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n- Emergency breaks msig on L1 is the already established one ([0x73b047fe6337183A454c5217241D780a932777bD](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x2b368b535b2024394daff218d222e260dbc4543b6d4e49aa4700cc0a9233e86a)):\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L1ERC20TokenBridge\n- Emergency breaks msig on L2 is a newly created one ([0x0F9A0e7071B7B21bc7a8514DA2cd251bc1FF0725](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=base:0x0F9A0e7071B7B21bc7a8514DA2cd251bc1FF0725)) with the same EOA members as for L1:\n    - WITHDRAWALS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge\n    - DEPOSITS_DISABLER_ROLE for L2ERC20TokenBridge",

In light of this, the 2023 GOOSE cycle proposal is to adopt the proposed set of goals.\n\n## GOOSE\n\nGOOSE is a framework establishing the open yearly process designed for the Lido DAO to pick a set of short and medium-term goals. The framework was adopted by Lido DAO in [the snapshot vote on 22 Sept 2023](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x58bbc5d540e46081043ef29d4d1ee56b7df4dc1b0369aa78e0c15a2403549353). The current vote is the first run of the process.\n\n## Hasu's proposal\n\n[Hasu proposed set of goals for the Lido DAO](https://research.lido.fi/t/hasus-goose-submission-proposed-goals-for-lido-dao-to-consider/5590/1) for the 3-year and 1-year period is as follows:\n\n### **Proposed 3-year goals**\n\n- **Goal #1**: Lido has effective and decentralized governance;\n- **Goal #2**: Lido attracts the best validator set in the market;\n- **Goal #3**: stETH is the most used token in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n### **Proposed 1-year goals**\n\n- **Effective, decentralized governance**\n    - stETH can participate in Governance (Dual Governance)\n    - Decentralised goal-setting process is set up\n    - Better Governance Rails\n- **Decentralized validator set**\n    - Permissionless Staking Router Module\n    - DVT-Powered SR Modules\n    - Staking Router Marketplace\n    - Support Programmatic Exits (by the DAO)\n- **stETH token**\n    - Educate the Ethereum community about stETH as a public good, improve user branding and protocol engagement\n    - Institutional Staking\n    - Bring-Your-Own-Validator (BYOV) staking module\n    - Redesign Channel Approach\n    - Deploy liquidity to its most efficient use\n\nThe context and motivation for picking the goals are described in the proposal post: https://research.lido.fi/t/hasus-goose-submission-proposed-goals-for-lido-dao-to-consider/5590/1\n\n## GOOSE Review Cycle\n\nGOOSE is designed to run on a yearly cadence, which means that the assessment and review of these goals will take place no more than 10 months apart. DAO Ops workstream is responsible for announcing the specific dates of the yearly cycle.",

      "title": "The Guided Open Objective Setting Exercise (“GOOSE”) proposal [rerun]",
      "content": "## **Summary**\n\nEstablish a prototype framework for consenting to goals which is open, adaptable, distributed and cyclical. The output of the GOOSE is the opportunity for competitive submissions of short and medium-term goals consented to by the governance token holders; The success marker of the GOOSE will be when **one-year** and **three-year** goals aligned to the overarching DAO **mission** and **vision** are public for anyone to use.\n\n## **Abstract**\n\nEvery system has a genesis event. The first piece or module of a larger puzzle. This proposal is to jump-start a framework for an open goal-setting exercise which is adaptable, inclusive, distributed, and cyclical. The GOOSE is a simple means to agree on how to set goals and allows for future steps or modules to adapt with the GOOSE. The output of the GOOSE is an open competitive submissions cycle which results in short (one-year) and medium (three-year) term goals which are revisable on an annual cadence and which can be used by anyone to contribute to the DAO. The prototype is inspired by bitcoin logic where the proposals are like blocks of ordered data and the token holders are like miners who will select the next truth. The GOOSE is the first module in an emerging framework, and is limited to consenting to goals. Further steps, such as how to estimate progress made towards goals are left to emerge as separate modules.\n\nThe exercise sequence consists of a notice period followed by a proposal period. During the **proposal period** any member of the Ethereum community interested in liquid staking can submit three-year and one-year goals which are demonstrably tied to the DAO's mission, vision and purpose. The end of the proposal period is followed by a consent period and snapshot vote to signal which proposal is consented to as a reference. The output of the GOOSE is a reference goals-matrix available to all potential creators, builders, or contributors wherever they may be and whatever they may do.\n\nOn a 12 month cycle the same sequence is repeated to review and update the reference matrix for currency and on-going relevance.\n\nThough they share a common sequence, there is a difference between the genesis jump-start exercise and the annual review exercise. The purpose of the genesis exercise (now) is a prototype to jump start the GOOSE framework - to get goal-setting underway; the purpose of the annual review is a deliberate and measured iteration on the prior three and one-year goals considering achievements over the prior 12 months and/ or changes in the environment, to roll still-valid prior-year goals forward, or to retire some goal as appropriate, and/or to fill matrix vacancies that arise as an output of the review exercise; it is also the opportunity to review and amend the GOOSE itself.\n\nThe process is \"open\" because anyone can make a submission, \"cyclical\" because it is annual, “adaptable” because there is a change mechanism built-in enabling dynamic response to change in environment, “inclusive” because the duration of the notice and submission periods are reasonable such that a motivated person can make a submission within the proposed periods, and “distributed” because it is both open and proposal selection and consent is made by token holder signal.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nDAOs are not companies. They have distinct advantages and challenges brought about by the different governance models. In particular, DAOs cannot rely upon conventional managerial tooling or processes for activities like goal-setting, or post-goal-setting resource allocation or results assessments, due to the absence of centralized management relationships. Goal alignment across a diffuse set of actors is desirable to ensure that necessary improvements are made to the protocols, and no compromise to the existing protocols & products are made. To compensate for this, DAOs need alternative ways to achieve parallel outcomes.\n\nA solution here is a *means* to let different actors “swim in their own lane” but help orient themselves to “swim to the same destination” with minimal need for coordination between and among them.\n\nOne means to substitute for conventional management frameworks is to make goals (submitted by anyone) available as public reference information. The reference can then be used locally to orient the decision making by distributed actors while maintaining their independence across the creation, building and contribution process. Here goals aligned with \"Vibes\" (Mission, Vision and Purpose) serve as an ultimate filter for things to do. Long term DAO mission/vision/purpose is at this [link](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x739fbe56425d355b5e41c22bb346b7a8217afd9e84aa49863648b1c641a482e3).  Adopting one and three-year goals connected to the mission/vision/purpose will provide an easily understood reference point from which the diffuse participants of the DAO can orient to without intervention.  Concurrent to this, consenting to goals annually will lower governance costs through less frequent requirements to vote.\n\nThis proposal does not address steps beyond consenting to what the reference goals are and how to review and update them. However, as a quasi-proxy for the “will” of the DAO, there is an incentive for projects and contributors to use the signal which is: If you're an individual/organisation/entity or team that is aligned with the reference goals and can reasonably demonstrate so, there may be a higher chance of being allocated funds from the treasury than if you propose for funding outside of the reference matrix. Making proposals outside of the reference matrix is not however closed and leaves open an onramp to respond to unexpected opportunities as they arise, however good goals will normally be resilient to dynamic changes.\n\n## **Benefits**\n\n### For the DAO\n\n- Removes topical paralysis and enables faster and easier governance decisions\n- Attracts developers/contributors\n- Aligns \"what's funded\" with clear goals & principles and reduces resources spent on unaligned things\n- Attracts better talent\n- Fosters open debate, thought leadership and an idea meritocracy\n\n### For Contributors\n\n- Facilitates decision-making in diffuse, decentralised groups\n- Encourages innovation, the development of new features, and the replacement or improvement of existing features within the software suite\n- Establishes the DAO as a reliable open trustworthy partner\n- Helps Independent contributing groups make better decisions\n- Helps build a healthy community around inventions\n\n## **Drawbacks**\n\n- Potentially increases the time and effort to develop and make submissions\n- Potentially slightly reduces the capability to respond to unknown unknowns\n\n## **Specification: Guided Open Objective Setting Exercise**\n\nThe GOOSE consists of:\n\n1. Genesis jump-start\n- September 1st post on forum\n- September 15th snapshot vote; all other steps depend on the proposal being approved by the DAO\n- September 22th start of 30-day submission period\n- October 22th submission period closes\n- October 22th start of discussion period\n- Late October/early November snapshot vote on the submitted proposals\n\nNote: The duration of the notice, submission and discussion periods in Genesis are constrained by the DAO voting cycle with the vote on GOOSE proposals scheduled for late October/early November.\n\n2. The Review Cycle\n    - Yearly\n    - 14-30 days notice and information sharing period\n    - 30 days submission period\n    - 7-14 days discussion period (depending on the Lido DAO voting cadence)\n\n### **Notice period**\n\nThe Notice period is a period of not less than 14 days where the DAO Ops workstream communicates to the community the timing of each of the relevant periods and explicitly communicates when a 30 day window will open and close to receive submissions.\n\n### **Submission period**\n\nThe Submission period is a 30 day window to make open submissions in their final form as an indivisible whole, encompassing complete one and three-year goals, including their role-related rationale. Including the rationale for “why” the goal is related to the mission vision purpose will enable discussion to remain focused and orderly by offering clear easily understood explanations.\n\n### **The Discussion (and update) period**\n\nThe Discussion period is a period where comments and modest feedback can be incorporated into the proposals by the authors if they so choose to revise their submissions. For example an author can amend their submission to substitute goals ( mix and match) based on community feedback.\n\n### **Vote**\n\nIt would be both unreasonable and unmanageable to vote on individual goals. A single proposal as submitted or amended by the author wins. The “mix and matching” of goals  from different submissions is possible but is captured in the discussion period. Under the current governance mechanics this means the winner submission requires 50%+ of the voted tokens and no less than 5% of all governance tokens on any single option.\n\nIt is worth noting here that no method is proposed to limit or screen the number of proposals that can be submitted in the Genesis exercise.  A process for narrowing the number of submissions for efficient use of resources is left for future review.\n\n### **Exercise ownership**\n\nThe GOOSE owner is the DAO Ops workstream.\n\n### **Cadence**\n\nThe cadence for the GOOSE is annual beginning the first year after Genesis with a 30 day notice period.\n\n### **Review Cycle**\n\nAs noted above, the sequence: notice, submission, discussion and vote, remains the same as Genesis, however, the content of the review cycle is not the same content as the one-time genesis. The review cycle is open, anyone can make a submission. The difference is the outcome is a revised goals matrix that accounts for the passage of time. The submissions will identify which goals are still valid and/or which goals should be struck in light of any changes in the operating environment or progress made. Where vacancies exist there is opportunity to introduce new 3-year and 1-year goals tied to the mission, vision, purpose.\n\nUsing this method the GOOSE will be an evolving iterative product of the collective experience and wisdom of the DAO, Ethereum participants and contributors. The longer term goal of the GOOSE would be to see a competitive plurality of submissions and potentially a bounty for the best submission.\n\n## **GOOSE review**\n\nThe GOOSE as outlined in this proposal will be open for review to capture any lessons learned on the same annual cycle.\n\n## **Collateral observations**\n\nFuture steps (solving a different problem) around execution and implementation frameworks are recommended to socialise the data for execution and implementation evaluation which can give feedback into the Revision cycle.",

      "title": "Should the Lido DAO add the 7 shortlisted Ethereum operators to the Lido on Ethereum operator set?",
      "content": "### Summary\n\nThis proposal is to onboard new node operators to the Lido on Ethereum Node Operator Set.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe goal of onboarding new node operators is to enhance the decentralization and resilience of the Lido protocol, as well as to bring on new organizations with strong skill sets and alignment with Lido’s values.\n\nThe Wave 5 onboarding round took place over two stages. Stage 1 to evaluate return-applicant Node Operators that had previously applied, and Stage 2 for any non-shortlisted candidates that applied during the overall Wave 5 onboarding round. \n\nDuring Stage 1, the [Lido DAO voted via a Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x85ebbe2cb80334c60e160ff267118489e17281046757561e91c5b22dae35e577) and [on-chain Aragon vote](https://vote.lido.fi/vote/162) to onboard 2 Node Operators (Launchnodes Limited and SenseiNode Inc).\n\nAt the Stage 2 application deadline, a total of 117 applications were received, and 111 were eligible for evaluation when taking into account duplicate applications and the 2 Node Operators onboarded during Stage 1.\n\nThe 7 shortlisted candidates proposed by the Lido Node Operator Subgovernance Group (LNOSG) were deemed to appropriately reflect the onboarding goals outlined in the Lido Operator Set Strategy and the “Factors to Consider'' section of the onboarding announcement.\n\nFollowing a final evaluation meeting September 5th 2023, the LNOSG recommended the following applicants for inclusion into the node operator set for the Ethereum protocol (in alphabetical order):\n\n[a4x Inc.](https://www.a41.io/) - joining the Lido on Ethereum Operator set as “A41”\n[Develp GmbH (on behalf of the Nimbus client team)](https://nimbus.team/) - joining the Lido on Ethereum Operator set as “Develp GmbH”\n[Ebunker Technology LIMITED](https://www.ebunker.io/) - joining the Lido on Ethereum Operator set as “Ebunker”\n[Gateway.fm AS](https://gateway.fm/) - joining the Lido on Ethereum Operator set as “Gateway.fm AS”\n[Numic](https://numic.au/) (a brand of QUTY Group Pty Ltd, ACN 634265204) - joining the Lido on Ethereum Operator set as “Numic”\n[ParaFi Technologies LLC](https://parafi.com/) - joining the Lido on Ethereum Operator set as “ParaFi Technologies LLC”\n[Rockaway Blockchain GP Ltd](https://rockawayx.com/infrastructure) -  joining the Lido on Ethereum Operator set as “RockawayX Infra”\n\n### Next steps\n\nThis vote will run for seven days from Mon, 11 Sep to Mon, 18 Sep, and seeks LDO holder approval of the onboarding of the above-mentioned node operators for the respective protocol, provided the operators confirm their desire to join.\n\nIn case the Snapshot concludes in favor of onboarding, an on-chain Aragon vote will follow on October 3rd, 2023 to add the 7 node operators to the Curated Operator Set.\n\nFor more information, please see the relevant Onboarding for Ethereum (Wave 5) announcement and evaluation results posted on [the Lido Research forum](https://research.lido.fi/).",

A small handful of LDO stakeholders have been benefiting, largely at the expense of the treasury.\n\nThis proposal aims to modify the Token Rewards Plan for LidoDAO contributors and stakeholders. The goals of the Token Rewards Plan are to:\n\n - Incentivize and concentrate activity within the LDO framework by rewarding all stakeholders, from stakers to node operators and DAO contributors\n- More efficiently use treasury funds which are currently being somewhat wasted by the current reward holders, who appear to have minimal participation.\n - Attract top talent\n - Establish means to provide governance participation to deeply \tengaged contributors.\n\nWe will be holding a twitter spaces at the end of this proposal conclusion to further discuss the way forward for the TRP.",

      "title": "The Guided Open Objective Setting Exercise (“GOOSE”) proposal",
      "content": "## **Summary**\n\nEstablish a prototype framework for consenting to goals which is open, adaptable, distributed and cyclical. The output of the GOOSE is the opportunity for competitive submissions of short and medium-term goals consented to by the governance token holders; The success marker of the GOOSE will be when **one-year** and **three-year** goals aligned to the overarching DAO **mission** and **vision** are public for anyone to use.\n\n## **Abstract**\n\nEvery system has a genesis event. The first piece or module of a larger puzzle. This proposal is to jump-start a framework for an open goal-setting exercise which is adaptable, inclusive, distributed, and cyclical. The GOOSE is a simple means to agree on how to set goals and allows for future steps or modules to adapt with the GOOSE. The output of the GOOSE is an open competitive submissions cycle which results in short (one-year) and medium (three-year) term goals which are revisable on an annual cadence and which can be used by anyone to contribute to the DAO. The prototype is inspired by bitcoin logic where the proposals are like blocks of ordered data and the token holders are like miners who will select the next truth. The GOOSE is the first module in an emerging framework, and is limited to consenting to goals. Further steps, such as how to estimate progress made towards goals are left to emerge as separate modules.\n\nThe exercise sequence consists of a notice period followed by a proposal period. During the **proposal period** any member of the Ethereum community interested in liquid staking can submit three-year and one-year goals which are demonstrably tied to the DAO's mission, vision and purpose. The end of the proposal period is followed by a consent period and snapshot vote to signal which proposal is consented to as a reference. The output of the GOOSE is a reference goals-matrix available to all potential creators, builders, or contributors wherever they may be and whatever they may do.\n\nOn a 12 month cycle the same sequence is repeated to review and update the reference matrix for currency and on-going relevance.\n\nThough they share a common sequence, there is a difference between the genesis jump-start exercise and the annual review exercise. The purpose of the genesis exercise (now) is a prototype to jump start the GOOSE framework - to get goal-setting underway; the purpose of the annual review is a deliberate and measured iteration on the prior three and one-year goals considering achievements over the prior 12 months and/ or changes in the environment, to roll still-valid prior-year goals forward, or to retire some goal as appropriate, and/or to fill matrix vacancies that arise as an output of the review exercise; it is also the opportunity to review and amend the GOOSE itself.\n\nThe process is \"open\" because anyone can make a submission, \"cyclical\" because it is annual, “adaptable” because there is a change mechanism built-in enabling dynamic response to change in environment, “inclusive” because the duration of the notice and submission periods are reasonable such that a motivated person can make a submission within the proposed periods, and “distributed” because it is both open and proposal selection and consent is made by token holder signal.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nDAOs are not companies. They have distinct advantages and challenges brought about by the different governance models. In particular, DAOs cannot rely upon conventional managerial tooling or processes for activities like goal-setting, or post-goal-setting resource allocation or results assessments, due to the absence of centralized management relationships. Goal alignment across a diffuse set of actors is desirable to ensure that necessary improvements are made to the protocols, and no compromise to the existing protocols & products are made. To compensate for this, DAOs need alternative ways to achieve parallel outcomes.\n\nA solution here is a *means* to let different actors “swim in their own lane” but help orient themselves to “swim to the same destination” with minimal need for coordination between and among them.\n\nOne means to substitute for conventional management frameworks is to make goals (submitted by anyone) available as public reference information. The reference can then be used locally to orient the decision making by distributed actors while maintaining their independence across the creation, building and contribution process. Here goals aligned with \"Vibes\" (Mission, Vision and Purpose) serve as an ultimate filter for things to do. Long term DAO mission/vision/purpose is at this [link](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x739fbe56425d355b5e41c22bb346b7a8217afd9e84aa49863648b1c641a482e3).  Adopting one and three-year goals connected to the mission/vision/purpose will provide an easily understood reference point from which the diffuse participants of the DAO can orient to without intervention.  Concurrent to this, consenting to goals annually will lower governance costs through less frequent requirements to vote.\n\nThis proposal does not address steps beyond consenting to what the reference goals are and how to review and update them. However, as a quasi-proxy for the “will” of the DAO, there is an incentive for projects and contributors to use the signal which is: If you're an individual/organisation/entity or team that is aligned with the reference goals and can reasonably demonstrate so, there may be a higher chance of being allocated funds from the treasury than if you propose for funding outside of the reference matrix. Making proposals outside of the reference matrix is not however closed and leaves open an onramp to respond to unexpected opportunities as they arise, however good goals will normally be resilient to dynamic changes.\n\n## **Benefits**\n\n### For the DAO\n\n- Removes topical paralysis and enables faster and easier governance decisions\n- Attracts developers/contributors\n- Aligns \"what's funded\" with clear goals & principles and reduces resources spent on unaligned things\n- Attracts better talent\n- Fosters open debate, thought leadership and an idea meritocracy\n\n### For Contributors\n\n- Facilitates decision-making in diffuse, decentralised groups\n- Encourages innovation, the development of new features, and the replacement or improvement of existing features within the software suite\n- Establishes the DAO as a reliable open trustworthy partner\n- Helps Independent contributing groups make better decisions\n- Helps build a healthy community around inventions\n\n## **Drawbacks**\n\n- Potentially increases the time and effort to develop and make submissions\n- Potentially slightly reduces the capability to respond to unknown unknowns\n\n## **Specification: Guided Open Objective Setting Exercise**\n\nThe GOOSE consists of:\n\n1. Genesis jump-start\n- September 1st post on forum\n- September 7th snapshot vote; all other steps depend on the proposal being approved by the DAO\n- September 14th start of 30-day submission period\n- October 14th submission period closes\n- October 14th start of discussion period\n- October 26th, snapshot vote on the submitted proposals\n\nNote: The duration of the notice, submission and discussion periods in Genesis are constrained by the DAO voting cycle with the vote on GOOSE proposals scheduled on October 26th.\n\n2. The Review Cycle\n    - Yearly\n    - 14-30 days notice and information sharing period\n    - 30 days submission period\n    - 7-14 days discussion period (depending on the Lido DAO voting cadence)\n\n### **Notice period**\n\nThe Notice period is a period of not less than 14 days where the DAO Ops workstream communicates to the community the timing of each of the relevant periods and explicitly communicates when a 30 day window will open and close to receive submissions.\n\n### **Submission period**\n\nThe Submission period is a 30 day window to make open submissions in their final form as an indivisible whole, encompassing complete one and three-year goals, including their role-related rationale. Including the rationale for “why” the goal is related to the mission vision purpose will enable discussion to remain focused and orderly by offering clear easily understood explanations.\n\n### **The Discussion (and update) period**\n\nThe Discussion period is a period not less than 10 days where comments and modest feedback can be incorporated into the proposals by the authors if they so choose to revise their submissions. For example an author can amend their submission to substitute goals (mix and match) based on community feedback.\n\n### **Vote**\n\nIt would be both unreasonable and unmanageable to vote on individual goals. A single proposal as submitted or amended by the author wins. The “mix and matching” of goals  from different submissions is possible but is captured in the discussion period. Under the current governance mechanics this means the winner submission requires 50%+ of the voted tokens and no less than 5% of all governance tokens on any single option.\n\nIt is worth noting here that no method is proposed to limit or screen the number of proposals that can be submitted in the Genesis exercise.  A process for narrowing the number of submissions for efficient use of resources is left for future review.\n\n### **Exercise ownership**\n\nThe GOOSE owner is the DAO Ops workstream.\n\n### **Cadence**\n\nThe cadence for the GOOSE is annual beginning the first year after Genesis with a 30 day notice period.\n\n### **Review Cycle**\n\nAs noted above, the sequence: notice, submission, discussion and vote, remains the same as Genesis, however, the content of the review cycle is not the same content as the one-time genesis. The review cycle is open, anyone can make a submission. The difference is the outcome is a revised goals matrix that accounts for the passage of time. The submissions will identify which goals are still valid and/or which goals should be struck in light of any changes in the operating environment or progress made. Where vacancies exist there is opportunity to introduce new 3-year and 1-year goals tied to the mission, vision, purpose.\n\nUsing this method the GOOSE will be an evolving iterative product of the collective experience and wisdom of the DAO, Ethereum participants and contributors. The longer term goal of the GOOSE would be to see a competitive plurality of submissions and potentially a bounty for the best submission.\n\n## **GOOSE review**\n\nThe GOOSE as outlined in this proposal will be open for review to capture any lessons learned on the same annual cycle.\n\n## **Collateral observations**\n\nFuture steps (solving a different problem) around execution and implementation frameworks are recommended to socialise the data for execution and implementation evaluation which can give feedback into the Revision cycle.",

      "title": "April Slashing Incident: Key Limit Follow-up",
      "content": "### Summary\n\nThis vote is a signaling vote intended to gauge community sentiment with regards to whether and when RockLogic GmbH (“the  Node Operator”) may resume increasing their validator count. [There has been discussion](https://research.lido.fi/t/discussion-treatment-of-potentially-harmful-incidents/4498/) on the forums with regards to what the general approach should be following node operator-related incidents which may cause a large impact (financial or otherwise) to the protocol and protocol users. This vote seeks to get community sentiment on the options having been discussed so that closing actions can be taken. \n\n### Context\n\nIn April 2023, a slashing occurred involving validators operated by the Node Operator (for more details please see the [post mortem](https://blog.lido.fi/loe-rocklogic-gmbh-slashing-incident/), and the [detailed discussion on the forums](https://research.lido.fi/t/slashing-incident-involving-rocklogic-gmbh-validators-april-13-2023/4399)). As a part of incident response measures, [a key limit was voted in by the DAO](https://vote.lido.fi/vote/154), limiting the total number of validators (also referred to as “keys”) being operated by the Node Operator to a maximum of 5800 (less the 11 slashed means 5789 which are currently active); note these are slightly more validators than the operator was running at the time of the slashing. The slashing resulted in [relatively minor financial penalties to stakers](https://research.lido.fi/t/slashing-incident-involving-rocklogic-gmbh-validators-april-13-2023/4399/25?u=izzy), which were covered through use of the DAO slashing cover fund, [as voted on by the DAO](https://vote.lido.fi/vote/160). Since then, the Node Operator has performed remediative actions improving their internal processes and node infrastructure, the technical issue with the Prysm key manager has been fixed, and steady updates have been provided by the node operator throughout the process detailing their actions and the resulting improvements.\n\nAn analysis using a framework for consideration of next steps after a slashing was employed examining the facts and circumstances around the event, follow up actions, and the current state. This analysis is currently being discussed on the forums, and based on discussions two directions / options seem to be prevailing. This vote seeks to determine whether the general community is aligned with either of these options, or a possibly a different direction.\n\nThe full list of possible options as proposed in the framework is:\n\n- Do nothing\n- Warning (do nothing w/ the condition that the next time the consequence is one/any of the below)\n- Limit the Node Operator’s key count for a certain period of time\n- Decrease the Node Operator’s key count (by prioritizing those keys for exit)\n- Offboard the operator (with the ability to rejoin the permissioned set at a later time)\n- Offboard the operator (without the ability to rejoin the permissioned set at a later time)\n\nBased on analysis of the facts as per the framework, taking into account the nature of the incident, its impact, follow-up actions, and the Node Operator’s overall value/participation in the ecosystem, the two options being discussed are variants of the “Limit the Node Operator’s key count for a certain period of time” consequence, since a key limit was already placed on the Node Operator shortly following (on April 18th) the slashing.  The first option suggests to lift the limit immediately, and the second option suggests to lift the limit once the next cohort of Lido on Ethereum operators (aka Wave 5*) has been onboarded and caught up in terms of stake allocation. A third option, “None of the above” has also been added for those who wish to express that neither of the aforementioned options is agreeable, or to indicate further discussion and consensus building would be necessary. Community consensus is important to be able to conclude the overall matter, and so that the Node Operator will have clarity with regards to what their next steps should be.\n\n*The [Wave 5 onboarding round has been suggested to take place in two stages](https://research.lido.fi/t/announcement-onboarding-for-ethereum-wave-5/4809/8):\n\n- Stage 1 is nearing completion, as the [DAO has voted to add two new operators](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x85ebbe2cb80334c60e160ff267118489e17281046757561e91c5b22dae35e577) to the Lido on Ethereum operator set, and the operators are currently going through testnet onboarding\n- Stage 2 is underway, with an estimated completion date of early September for the evaluations, and late September / early October for mainnet onboarding of new additions\n\n### Actions\n\n**Vote “Lift Key Limit (KL) immediately” if:**\n\n- you agree that none of the more strict options are relevant in this case (e.g. offboarding the operator)\n- you agree that the Node Operator may increase their validators as soon as they are ready to\n\n**Vote “Lift Key Limit (KL) after Wave 5 catches up” if:**\n\n- you agree that none of the more strict options are relevant in this case (e.g. offboarding the operator)\n- you agree that the Node Operator may increase their validators, but only once the next cohort of operators has joined and reached (any of the cohort members, not all) a number of validators roughly equal to the number of validators that the node operator is currently operating (~5800)\n\n**Vote “None of the above” if:**\n\n- none of the above rationales & actions are agreeable, or\n- you believe that additional discussion or analysis is needed",

      "title": "Tiered Rewards Share Program: A Sustainable Approach to stETH Growth",
      "content": "# TL;DR\n\nThis proposal aims to introduce a rewards-share system to encourage market participants who may not prioritize or stake with the Lido protocol without rewards. To effectively manage the program and minimize risk, tiered rewards will be implemented as percentages of the generated rewards. This ensures that the incentives align with ETH being staked with Lido and maintain the protocol's sustainability.\nIt's also proposed to form the Committee which will control a multi-signature wallet with authority to whitelist, filter, and distribute stETH protocol rewards.\n\n# Proposal\n\nThis proposal is for a tiered rewards-share program that offers a percentage of the DAO’s 5% share of staking rewards to participants who stake ETH using Lido. The program is designed to have limited rewards pools, gradual payouts, a fixed duration that the DAO shares with participants, and filtering for program abuse(details of abuse mentioned later).\n\nThe rewards-share program operates in three-phases:\n\n1. **Onboarding**: This phase involves the initial application and evaluation process. Prospective participants need to meet the eligibility criteria outlined in the proposal below. The Rewards Share Committee will review and vote on applications, then add the accepted addresses to the program.\n2. **Rewards-Share**: Once onboarded, participants are eligible for rewards-share. The Committee will monitor participants’ stETH contributions and calculate rewards based on positive activities, disqualification activities, and unstaked ETH.\n3. **Offboarding**: The Rewards-Share program is designed with a defined termination points for all participants. The offboarding phase happens either when a participant voluntarily leaves the program, does not renew their participation, gets disqualified due to violation of the program’s Terms and Conditions, is discontinued by a DAO vote, or the rewards pool for rewards-share is exhausted and not renewed.\n\n# **Onboarding**\n\nProspective participants can be wallets, institutions, protocols, crypto services, neobanks, and custody services.\n\n- **Minimum Potential Contribution**: Participants must demonstrate a potential to drive at least 2,500 ETH to Lido over the span of 12-24 months. This potential contribution will be assessed based on the current ETH total value locked (TVL); or total addressable market(TAM) within the participant’s protocol, wallet-products, or institution.\n- **Promising New Projects**: If an applicant does not meet the minimum potential contribution level, the committee can assess applications from projects that show potential for driving growth to the Lido protocol. Evaluating factors may include the uniqueness of the product or any other qualities that the committee recognizes as indicative of future growth potential.\n- **Commitment to Lido**: Participants must at least be willing to market and promote Lido equally with alternative liquid staking tokens(LSTs). Participants will still be eligible for the program if they promote Lido alongside alternatives.\n- **Compliance and Conditions**: Participants will certify during onboarding that participation in Rewards-Share will follow Lido’s [Terms of Use](https://lido.fi/terms-of-use)\n    - The DAO determines the size of the rewards-share pool and the amount and terms of the stETH token reward, and can modify them through a DAO vote\n    - The DAO can stop, pause, and resume the program at any time\n    - The DAO can, at any time, change the operating conditions of the Rewards-Share Program\n    - The rewards-share program does not have a specific time frame. The Program ends when there are no more tokens in the Reward Pool\n    - Participants may maintain open lines of communication with the Rewards Share Committee and report any changes in their staking activities, relevant business operations, or other factors that could impact their eligibility for the program\n    - Participants have the opportunity to appeal decisions to the Rewards Share Committee, but the committee makes the final decision on their eligibility, rewards, or other program-related matters\n    - Participants are eligible for rewards share for 12 months from time of joining\n    - The Rewards Share Committee must vote (by majority of the committee members) to renew a participant’s eligibility into the program after 12 months\n    - In the event that the DAO does not renew the Rewards-Share Program, all rewards in the Rewards Pool will be paid out until exhausted\n\n# **Rewards-Share**\n\n### **Tiers**\n\nParticipants share a percentage of the DAO’s 5% share of staking rewards. For each individual ETH staked by participants, the DAO shares rewards for a period of 12 months starting from the date the ETH was staked. The amount of rewards-share from the DAO is tier-based, determined by the total cumulative ETH staked by the participant and/or by users via participants’ products and services.\n\n**The tiers:**\n\n- 30% between 0 - 50,000 ETH\n- 35% between 50,000 - 150,000 ETH\n- 40% between 150,000 - 350,000 ETH\n- 45% between 350,000 - 700,000 ETH\n- 50% for 700,000 ETH or higher\n\nA participant’s starting tier will be determined by the amount of ETH originating from a participant’s products and services prior to their enrollment in the program. Necessary prerequisite for the recognition of the staked amount - staking transactions must be unambiguously attributable to the participant’s products and services based on the on-chain data. This might be achieved by:\n\n- The integration of a unique referral code provided to the participants of the previous referral programs that tracks staked ETH\n- Or by using on-chain data from a router smart contract that interacts exclusively with the participant’s own tokens and/or tokens belonging to the users of the participant’s products and services.\n\nThe Rewards-Share committee can disqualify any staking transactions for the purpose of the tier determination if they are too ambiguous or difficult to attribute to a participant’s products and services with a sufficient level of confidence.\n\n### Rewards-Share Calculation\n\nAll participants will be provided a unique referral code, that can be integrated at the website or protocol level, to track stETH they stake using Lido protocol. The Rewards-share committee will check activity within calendar months(ex. Jan 1st-31st).\n\nThese actions determined the amount of rewards-share:\n\n- ETH Contribution: The total amount of ETH staked through the Lido Protocol by the participant\n- Tier Level: A participant’s starting tier is determined by their cumulative contributions prior to joining rewards-share(total amount of ETH they were responsible for staking to Lido protocol before joining the rewards-share program). They can move up tiers while in the program as their contribution increases.\n- Staking Duration: Rewards share lasts 12 months from the time each ETH was staked\n\n### **Rewards-Share Disqualification Activities**\n\nListed below are samples of activities that are detrimental to the program and can result in disqualifying stETH from being included in rewards-share. Only stETH involved in disqualification is excluded, not all stETH. The committee will filter for all new staked ETH within calendar month checking periods. These activities include:\n\n- Unstaking: If ETH has been staked and unstaked in a period, then only net amount will be counted towards rewards-share\n- Selling stETH on DEXs/CEXs: Trading stETH on decentralized or centralized exchanges\n- Cycle-staking: Repeatedly staking ETH, selling or unstaking the resulting stETH, and then staking again\n- One-sided stETH liquidity provisioning on DEXs: Providing liquidity for only one side of a decentralized exchange pool\n- Secondary leveraged staking from money markets: Engaging in leveraged staking on platforms like Aave, Compound, or Euler are eligible for rewards-share. However, rewards-share for stETH originated from leveraged staking will be disqualified if the position risk ratio (borrowed funds/borrow limit) is above 0.95 or if the corresponding staking transactions take place:\n    - While the deviation of the stETH:ETH swap rate from 1:1 is greater than 1%\n    - When a temporary increase of the liquidation threshold for (w)stETH collateral on money markets is enacted\n\nThese activities do not disqualify the participant from the program outright, just the stETH directly involved in disqualification activities. However, if stETH originating from a participant is repeatedly involved in disqualification activities, the rewards-share committee can disqualify a participant from the program completely.\n\n- If a participant is directly involved in disqualification activity, they will be considered for outright disqualification from the program(custodian, institution)\n\n### **Unstaked ETH and the Social Unstake Deduction**\n\nUnstaked stETH will be deducted from stETH eligible for rewards-share. For unstaked stETH that is difficult to track directly to its source *(mixed with tokens from other sources, or split between different addresses etc.)* - we created the social unstake deduction.\n\nThis technique indirectly adjusts eligible stETH for rewards-share by considering the total unstaked stETH during a calendar month and the proportion of that unstaked stETH contributed by rewards-share participants. This mechanism was invented to overcome limitations imposed by stETH fungibility - it is hardly possible to determine the origin of a particular unstaked token.\n\nThe social unstake deduction will not be enabled by default. It will be used as an emergency brake in case of mass unstaking of participants in the rewards-share program.\n\n- If the total amount of withdrawals that are difficult to attribute directly to participants in a month exceeds 25% of the average monthly new stake for the last three months, then the social unstake deduction will be applied. By default, the deduction will be disabled the next month if withdrawals don’t exceed the threshold.\n- The social unstake deduction will be enabled on a permanent basis if multiple participants are systematically cheating through cycle staking to get higher rewards.\n\n### **Avoiding the Social Unstake Deduction with Whitelisted Addresses**\n\nThe whitelisted address is a way for participants to avoid the social unstake deduction. stETH sent to the whitelisted address will be exempt from the social unstake deduction but will be subjected to direct unstake deduction instead if withdrawals take place.\n\nThis process allows the Rewards-Share Committee to easily track a participant’s contribution.\n\n# **Off-boarding**\n\nThe Rewards-Share program is designed with a predetermined termination point, marking the onset of the offboarding phase. This phase can be triggered under several circumstances:\n\n- Voluntary Departure: Participants may decide to leave the program at their own discretion.\n- Non-renewal: After 12 months of active participation, participants must reapply for the program. If a participant does not renew their participation, they automatically enter the offboarding phase.\n- Disqualification: If a participant violates the program’s Terms and Conditions, they can be disqualified and ushered into the offboarding phase.\n- DAO Discontinuation: The DAO reserves the right to vote for the conclusion or non-renewal of the rewards pool. If such a vote passes, all participants are moved to the offboarding phase.\n- Exhaustion of Rewards Pool: If the rewards pool for rewards-share is exhausted and not renewed, all participants will no longer receive rewards-share\n\nIf a participant’s status in the program is terminated and is no longer earning rewards-share going forward, stETH before termination will still be earned rewards-share(12 months from time of staked ETH). However, should the rewards pool be depleted or the DAO decide to discontinue the program, the rewards-share distribution will consequently cease for all participants.\n\n# **Rewards Share Committee**\n\nThe Committee will control a multi-signature wallet with authority to whitelist, filter, and distribute stETH protocol rewards.\n\nMultisig disclosure: Use 0xe2A682A9722354D825d1BbDF372cC86B2ea82c8C rewards share multi-signature wallet that is controlled by the Rewards Share Committee members(aka signers):\n\n- frontalpha: 0x22c05930160c6a74a6bA59436e8F7006176ed104\n- kadmil: 0x9A3f38AF97b791C85c043D46a64f56f87E0283D4\n- Zuzu_eeka: 0x004812da927b5DCd07e7329609eDD75E25d2d295\n- Pipistrella: 0x5da409e1cbDABeC67471dB01Ff956f804bb8879f\n- jbeezy: 0x039bDD285d3eDb1D9B6001d3097067Aa2AF7d826\n- McNut: 0xc7a8DE05264442A318189f2bd160d2830902C8CD\n- kethfinex: 0x639e084095020E1E85a857eb12b2219292a5B979\n\nThe committee will follow the DAO’s [policy](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-dao-ops-multisigs-policy/4115) on multisig operations.\n\nThe Committee will start with an initial rewards pool of 3,000 stETH, which will be requested with Easy Track motions (respectful factories to be deployed) if this proposal is approved in the current Snapshot. When the pool is depleted, the DAO will vote whether to replenish it.\n\nSupporting Research and Analysis\n\n- Rewards Share Simulation: A [simulation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NzAzDEdO7ddNxVOHHsgvKHUqlO6Ax3gdwAv9Q9kH3Fw/edit#gid=312046990) is available to see how aspects like tier, staked amount, disqualified ETH, and unstaked ETH determine the rewards earned by participants\n- [Social Unstake Penalty](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xbsu5sbwN7D_rDRrqrrf2SZDeKqFAFWVcW8rlHoeoq8/edit): A paper on the “social unstake” penalty concept, which addresses the challenge of tracking unstaked stETH and offers a solution to indirectly adjust rewards share based on the total amount of unstaked stETH and its proportion to stETH originating from rewards share participants.\n\n# Definition of Terms:\n\n- “Rewards Share Committee” means the committee established by the DAO to oversee the distribution of rewards within the Rewards-Share Program.\n- “Lido” refers to the name of a suite of software tools deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.\n- “stETH” means the staked Ethereum token created by Lido as a representation of a user’s staked ETH.\n- “DAO” means the decentralized autonomous organization responsible for managing and governing Lido software.\n- “ETH” refers to the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain.",

Impact Stakers pledge rewards to projects with measurable impact. Effective projects receive ongoing funding, while ineffective ones are remedied swiftly.\n\nLido Impact Staking Smart Contract aims to enable ETH stakers to pledge rewards to ongoing projects. Beneficiaries include UNICEF, GiveDirectly, Treedom, and others. Impact Staking via Lido is expected to attract individuals, foundations, and family offices.\n\nAll aspects of the web3 infrastructure and implementation for Impact Staking with Lido are intended to be fully transparent and visible in public repos and on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n## Motivations\n\n1. Strategically value of the proposal for Lido is that it can become a new distribution channel and a case study for stETH wrappers.\n2. It provides a low-cost opportunity for the DAO to engage new contributors, which enhances decentralization and the growth of Lido on Ethereum.\n3. The project's potential to attract interest and serve as a pilot for future initiatives is seen as a valuable positive communication opportunity for the broader ecosystem.\n4. It showcases how Lido can be used as staking middleware to empower users in the web3 ecosystem and support real-world initiatives.\n5. By linking staking rewards with real-world organizations, the proposal helps onboard new users to web3 and crypto who may not have been interested otherwise.\n\n## Projects to target with Lido Impact Staking:\n\n| Cause / Project | Project Delivery | KPIs / Outcome Tracked |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Net Zero Ethereum | [Treedom](https://www.treedom.net/en) | Carbon Offset (tonnes/CO2) vs Ethereum footprint |\n| Internet Connectivity for Schools | [UNICEF Giga](https://giga.global/) | Number of schools connected to the Internet |\n| Lifting People Out of Poverty | [Give Directly](https://www.givedirectly.org/) | Number of people lifted out of poverty |\n\nThese 3 projects have huge global potential to improve lives, and to reduce the carbon footprint of the Ethereum network.\n\n## Scope of Work\n\nBefore the project proceeds, Launchnodes will engage with an international tax specialist to ensure it operates in a tax-efficient manner. They will also confirm that the KYC/KYB and AML requirements are met for partner organizations. A highly visual website and dashboard will be created to display real-time information on ETH staked, donations, and impact. \nThe three core aspects of the project are: \n\n- the Lido Impact Staking Smart Contract\n- Impact Staking User Interface to Pledge Returns and View Impact\n- Project Interface and Metrics\n\nYou can read more about mentioned project parts in [the proposal](https://research.lido.fi/t/launchnodes-impact-staking-with-lido-grant-proposal/3732/8#scope-of-work-5).\n\nThe grant will fund all three components, but the final security and smart contract review will be funded by Launchnodes or its ecosystem partners.\n\n## **Risk: Response & Mitigation**\n\n**1: Causes may not suit crypto natives.**\n\n- 3 high profile global issues have been selected with large, trusted partners.\n- The architecture and model will be developed for multiple different causes to be represented and achieve donations.\n- Alternatives will continue to be added if initial causes don't resonate.\n- Feedback, proposals, and partnerships will be sought from potential stakers.\n\n**2: The initiative will fail due to insufficient/ineffective marketing.**\n\n- The 3 initial causes chosen have global marketing capabilities.\n- The memetic website should be highly visually appealing and have elements to increase global visibility and reach.\n- Launchnodes has established an Impact Staking working group and plans to actively spend additional marketing funds.\n\n**3: The approach and mechanics do not meet the needs of donors/philanthropists.**\n\n- The advantageous tax treatment of impact staking rewards donated to a good cause will be investigated and confirmed.\n- Additional projects/causes with greater appeal will be sought if necessary.\n\n**4: The Lido Impact Staking initiative falters after an initially successful project.**\n\n- The project has been designed to be self-sustaining for the long-term, after successful go-live.\n\n## Grant Request\n\nBreakdown Timeline for each of the following components:\n\n1. Understanding Tax, KYC, AML Requirements - 4 weeks\n2. Lido Impact Staking Smart Contract - 12 weeks\n3. Impact Staking - User Interface to Pledge Returns - 4 weeks\n4. Impact Staking - Project Interface and Metrics - 6 weeks\n5. Security Review - Full External Security Review of Smart Contract and Systems (to be executed in coordination with the [Lido Audits Committee](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-on-ethereum-form-audits-committee/3481))\n\nTotal Project Duration: 6 months (Development) + 1 month (External Security Review)\n\n(2 Smart Contract Engineers, 1 Front End Engineer, 1 Back End Engineer, 1 Test Engineer, 1 External Security Audit Team)\n\n## Access\n\nAccess and ongoing support relating to all features outlined in the Scope of Work proposed above is planned for at least 12 months after completion of the full scope of the proposal.\n\nIt is intended that the platform and Impact Staking as an initiative will grow at pace throughout 2023 and beyond, and that the project components will continue to be built upon, supported and maintained - either by Launchnodes directly, or through a community approach with a dedicated DAO or similar structure.\n\n## Grants and Payment\n\nFor the Scope of Work proposed above, Launchnodes is requesting a $300,000 grant with the following structure for execution:\n\n- Agreement to proceed, contingent upon tax benefits of charitable giving applying to Impact Staking\n- Tax law opinion received (US jurisdiction) on whether there is parity between direct charitable giving, and donation of impact staking rewards - Launchnodes to fund\n- 25% upon project initiation\n- 15% upon successful external security review and satisfactory resolution of Medium, High, and Critical-level issues highlighted - the external security audit team will be engaged in coordination with the Lido Audits Committee\n- 60% after the first $3m has generated in funding for Impact Staking projects across all Lido Impact Staking vaults\n\nThis model ensures that 60% of the project’s fees are contingent upon Lido Impact Staking engaging a meaningful volume of supportive Impact Stakers.\n\nIn case this proposal accepted by the Lido DAO, grants to be disbursed in DAI from [LEGO committee multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x12a43b049A7D330cB8aEAB5113032D18AE9a9030) upon completion of above mentioned milestones. For that purpose LEGO multisig is to be funded via [Easy Track motions](https://easytrack.lido.fi/).\n\n## Ongoing Maintenance, Support and Growth\n\nLaunchnodes can support the Lido Impact Staking platform by becoming a node operator, which would provide a revenue stream for the platform's maintenance and expansion. Launchnodes could also operate nodes for organizations like Save the Children or UNICEF enabling them to receive funds for upkeep. Alternatively, Launchnodes could charge a small percentage of rewards or total staked amount to remain sustainable long-term.\n\n## Initial Impact Projects and Causes\n\nAll projects will be required to provide ongoing data on all of the Key Performance Indicators being tracked as part of their project delivery, eg. tonnes of CO2 offset. This will drive the real-time data on the Lido Impact Staking dashboards. \n[More details about initial Projects and Causes](https://research.lido.fi/t/launchnodes-impact-staking-with-lido-grant-proposal/3732/8#initial-impact-projects-and-causes-16).",

      "content": "A vote on Lido DAO's Mission, Vision, and Purpose (a synthesis from 5 months of deep discussion).\n\n### Purpose / Vision / Mission\n\n**Purpose (why):** Keep Ethereum decentralized, accessible to all, and resistant to censorship.\n\n**Vision (where):** A world in which Ethereum is the co-ordination and value layer of the internet.\n\n**Mission (what):** Make staking simple, secure, and decentralized.\n\n### Definitions\n\nPurpose: WHY the organization exists, contributing something positive to people, and/or the planet. This should be short, memorable and aspirational.\n\nVision: WHERE the organization is heading, with a view of the world envisaged as being created by being successful in its purpose. This can be both a vision of the world and a vision of where the organization is within that world.\n\nMission: WHAT the organization will do to achieve its purpose over a specified period of time. This can be seen as the specific strategy, the actions and operations which the business will conduct over a set period of time.\n\n### Motivation\n\n### Governance arc\n\nThe substance of a DAO’s constitution (its raison-d’etre) should ideally come before the governance framework/design (the next port of call).\n\nThis is because the right governance framework (e.g. process and tools) is fundamentally dependent on what we (all present and future contributors) plan to govern (and setting bounds on this is essentially the role of a constitution).\n\nPut another way, governance happens primarily within the boundaries that the substance of a constitution gives shape to. But what exactly does the substance mean?\n\nThe substance, for the purposes of this document, is the animating purpose coupled with the mission / vision / purpose that make Lido what it is. You can think of it as a pre-formal social contract of sorts.\n\nOnce we have consensus over this foundation, we can start working out a functional architecture for a general governance framework, followed by the process and tools required to fulfill all the required functions in the functional architecture.\n\n### Communications / product arc\n\nToday, there is an increasing acknowledgement that purpose defines both the direction of the organisation and its course, rather than simply messaging.\n\nGoing forward, we can expect purpose to only increase in importance as people look for greater meaning, greater understanding, and greater clarity on the organisation they work for, the organisations they engage with, and the brands and services they use.\n\nRather than fitting a brand around a product, the strongest brands of tomorrow are building capabilities around a brand truth – the overarching promise or positive ideology that the brand has the credibility to enact (a credibility derived from the authentic expression of the organization’s purpose).\n\nUnder such an approach, the brand effectively acts as a central organizational principle – the truth which brings everything together (therein lies the link between purpose, brand, and organisational design).\n\n### Summary\n\nWithout a deep understanding of the DAO’s purpose, as well as how to authentically express it (purpose / mission / vision), it is impossible to effectively communicate our brand truth; this in turn compromises our ability to build the most authentic product.\n\nThe next port of call on the communications front is to build out a brand platform and strategy around the truths contained in this document.",

      "title": "Lido Community Lifeguards Initiative",
      "content": "### Lido DAO Proposal\n\n(Proposed by LEGO Council)\n\nWith [Lido V2](https://blog.lido.fi/introducing-lido-v2/), the newly rolled out Staking Router will allow for dramatically increased community participation in the Lido protocol as part of the node operator set. New stakers from the Community (node operators) will benefit from contributors lending a helping hand in understanding how to interact with these modules. This initiative will require coordination and an active public presence to communicate and engage with the Ethereum staking community. In order to further the goal of a more open, diverse and, permissionless operator set, this proposal outlines a pilot “Community Lifeguards Initiative” (CLI) which would identify and reward community participants who would bring together existing DAO contributors, community stakers, and the wider Ethereum staking community.\n\n### Objective\n\nThis proposal is for the Lido DAO to fund the Community Lifeguards Initiative Pilot as described below. The full proposed (maximum) funding amounts are described in detail, as are the suggested structures for LEGO collaboration with the CLI.\n\nCommunity Lifeguards will actively engage with new individual community stakers, work to create knowledge bases and educational content, help organize community initiatives, represent community operators in Lido DAO discussions and working groups, and provide information during Lido Node Operator community calls. Additionally, they will work together with community participants, other LEGO grant recipients, and third parties to shepherd and facilitate the exploration and usage of community tooling, including but not limited to, initiatives such as:\n\n- Usage of staking clients or software built to help community operators participate (e.g. [eth-docker](https://github.com/eth-educators/eth-docker), [Stereum](https://research.lido.fi/t/stereum-grant-proposal/3287), [Dappnode](https://dappnode.io/), [Avado](https://ava.do/), [Nicenode](https://www.nicenode.xyz/))\n- Dashboards and alerting systems for validators run by community operators (e.g. [Metrika Relay Monitor](https://research.lido.fi/t/metrika-relay-monitor-grant-proposal/3395))\n\n### Duration\n\nThe Community Lifeguards Initiative pilot is proposed to commence within Q2/23 and last until Q4/23, at which point LEGO and the Lido DAO should consider whether this initiative is worth continuing, expanding, or sunsetting. Within the pilot period, the initially identified Community Lifeguard(s) should effectively support the growth and success of community staker participation through the initial V2 rollout and new module implementation. After that period, it may make sense for the initiative to expand into a committee or workstream of its own to allow for more robustness of execution.\n\n### Scope & Responsibilities\n\n- LEGO shall make an open call for nominees or self-nominated applicants to participate in the Community Lifeguards Initiative (targeting up to ~2-3 full-time equivalents for the pilot). Community Lifeguards may be part-time or full-time. Applications will be open for the length of the pilot, provided there are slots available.\n- Nominees will be vetted by LEGO and accepted, via LEGO Council vote, as members of the Community Lifeguard Initiative.\n    - If the proposal is approved, applications will be collected and reviewed for a period of 3 weeks (21 days) immediately following approval of the proposal.\n    - The results of the LEGO Council vote will be published, along with a list of all applicants (unless the applicants do not wish to be publicly identified).\n- One of the accepted participants shall serve as Coordinator, and join as a guest member of LEGO in order to be involved in the assessment of community staker-focused grants and to report on and assess sub-initiatives / projects.\n\nFor the pilot program, a maximum of the below funds should be set aside; if additional amounts are required, they should be requested and approved via a new vote (either LEGO or DAO, depending on the size). Based on the delivery of additional staking router modules that enable community operator entry, it may be reasonable to scale up the amounts below in Q3 and Q4 of 2023, and potentially further in 2024.\n\nThe funds will be administered by LEGO plus the above-mentioned LEGO-vetted Community Lifeguard Coordinator (where relevant, see below). Roughly, these funds could be utilized in the following manner:\n\n| Amount | Use of funds | Approver |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Total Funding Requested: 230K LDO, 50K DAI | See below | See below |\n| up to 120K LDO (40K LDO per quarter) | Compensation for Community Lifeguards, based on time and quality of contribution (i.e. approximate max of 13.3K LDO/FTE per quarter at 3 FTEs, where max would indicate exemplary performance) | LEGO (Note, this is not necessarily all to be spent on compensation, but constitutes a maximum) |\n| up to 60K LDO (20K LDO per quarter) | Up to 3K LDO per use as grants towards exemplary participation, value add, or small-scale initiatives in the scope of the initiative (Larger grants can be approved as per normal LEGO approval requirements) | LEGO (>= 2 council members) + Community Lifeguard Coordinator |\n| up to 50K LDO and 50K DAI (In aggregate for Q2-Q4) | Taking over the currently directly LEGO-funded solo stakers’ related initiatives (e.g. Stereum grants and Metrika support) | Community Lifeguard Coordinator + 1x LEGO Council Member (Must be continuation of previous / existing grants or LEGO grant recipients, otherwise can follow normal LEGO approval) |\n\n### Vote and operations\n\nThis proposal will be suggested for approval by the Lido DAO via Snapshot vote. If accepted - 230K LDO and 50K DAI to be transferred via Easy Track motion to [LEGO committee multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x12a43b049A7D330cB8aEAB5113032D18AE9a9030).\n\nAdditional 2 / 3 multisig (signers to be 2 LEGO council members and 1 Community Lifeguard Coordinator) to be set up which will receive expected monthly grants limited as per above table. In the future (if the pilot considered successful and the initiative continue is approved by the Lido DAO) it may be extended with other participants to accommodate a greater amounts according to [Lido DAO ops multisigs policy](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-dao-ops-multisigs-policy/4115).\n\nThe multisig address and participants to be provided in replies to this proposal upon settling.\n\n### The Community Lifeguards will be responsible for the following tasks\n\n- Engaging with Lido Community Operators, documenting their concerns, and collecting feedback.\n- Representing the voice of the Community Operators in Lido internal discussions, ensuring that their interests are considered in the decision-making process.\n- Providing regular Community Operator-focused updates during Lido Node Operator community calls.\n- Collaborating with Lido’s marketing and communication teams to develop and implement strategies for increasing Community Operator engagement and awareness.\n- Identifying opportunities for LEGO grants (e.g. community staker tooling) and facilitating the grants process for such initiatives (e.g. via RFPs, one-offs, or repetitive/milestone-grants).\n- Identifying opportunities for collaboration with other Ethereum staking projects and fostering new initiatives within the Ethereum staking community.\n- Participating in community events, webinars, and AMAs as members of the Lido ecosystem and staker community.\n- Creating knowledge bases for stakers interested in participating as Lido Node Operators across different module design types.\n\n### Goal\n\nThe goal of the Community Lifeguards initiative is to significantly increase and diversify the operators participating in the Lido on Ethereum protocol while fostering a vibrant and inclusive community.\n\n### Vision\n\nThe Community Lifeguards Initiative envisions a collaborative and supportive environment where all stakeholders can actively engage in the Lido ecosystem. It aims to create a strong sense of community that encourages participation, facilitates knowledge sharing, and fosters innovation within the Ethereum staking community.\n\n### Metrics\n\nThe success of the initiative can be gauged using the following metrics:\n\n1. Working closely with contributors, operators, module developers to determine what kinds of potential would be realizable by Q4 2023, and reporting on the results.\n2. Defining what kinds of success metrics may be used by the Lido DAO and contributors to assess the success of an expanded (post Q4 2023) Community Lifeguards Initiative.\n3. Engagement in Lido community channels: Measuring the activity levels in Lido-related community channels (such as Discord, Telegram, and forums) will indicate the level of participation and enthusiasm within the community.\n4. Satisfaction survey results: Conducting periodic surveys to assess community operator satisfaction with the support provided by Community Lifeguards will offer insights into the effectiveness of the initiative.\n5. Educational content created and shared: Tracking the number of knowledge base articles, guides, and tutorials produced by Community Lifeguards will help evaluate their efforts in educating community operators and the wider Ethereum staking community.\n6. Attendance and participation in community events: Measuring the level of engagement in community events, webinars, and AMAs will help assess the impact of the Community Lifeguards initiative.\n\nBy monitoring these metrics, LEGO and the Lido DAO will be able to determine the success of the pilot and decide whether to continue, expand, or sunset the Community Lifeguards Initiative after the pilot period. This data-driven approach will ensure that resources are allocated effectively and that the initiative delivers tangible benefits to the Lido ecosystem and the broader Ethereum staking community.\n\n### Qualifications\n\n### Community Lifeguards should possess the following qualifications\n\n- Deep understanding of Ethereum staking and familiarity with staking as a solo operator.\n- Familiarity with Lido’s vision, objectives, and technology stack.\n- Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, with a proven ability to engage and motivate community members.\n- Experience and expertise in creating educational content, simplifying technical writing, and leading community sessions.\n- Community Lifeguards Coordinators may be part-time or full-time.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs Lido V2 introduces the infrastructure for new modules and expands its offering to the Ethereum staking community and solo stakers, having a dedicated Community Lifeguards will be crucial for fostering engagement and ensuring effective communication with community stakeholders.\n\nIf you are interested in applying, please contact [LEGO](https://lido.fi/lego). Applications should all be public on the [research.lido.fi](http://research.lido.fi/) forums.",

      "content": "### Proposal\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to expand the role of the Gas Funder Committee (was created [here](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-depositor-bot-in-ethereum/1881)) and to rebrand it into the **Gas Supply Committee**.\n\nThe new authority is to determine the eligibility of gas expense reimbursements arising in day-to-day operation of the protocols within an **annual budget capped at 1,000 stETH**.\n\nIf the proposal approved by the Lido DAO - stETH replenishment setup of the committee's multisig to be subsequently added into Easy Track factories registry during the next Aragon vote.\n\n### The Committee Operations\n\nA [multisig - 0x5181d5D56Af4f823b96FE05f062D7a09761a5a53](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5181d5D56Af4f823b96FE05f062D7a09761a5a53) will be used between the Lido treasury and compensation recipients, refills to be done via on-chain voting solution (i.e. [Easy Track](https://easytrack.lido.fi/) motions, [Aragon](https://vote.lido.fi/), etc) - continuous operation of the protocol is a priority, the first refill of 100 stETH to be offered via Easy Track motion or Aragon vote soon after this proposal acceptance. The first refill amount based on the current month gas spent (80+ ETH) and [an amount according to Lido on Polygon request](https://research.lido.fi/t/funding-for-lido-on-polygon-depositor-bot/4431).\n\nThe following will be the initial expenditures authorised for reimbursement with an opportunity to include new (or evict old) ones in the future:\n\n- Lido on Ethereum operational gas expense (previously paid by the Gas Funder Committee)\n- Oracles expense reimbursement necessary for the operation (previously paid by the Gas Funder Committee)\n- Lido on Polygon operational gas expense (previously paid by Lido on Polygon developers)\n\nAny extension of the budget cap of 1,000 stETH can only be explicitly requested and approved by the Lido DAO vote (currently - Snapshot).\n\nQuarterly reporting on reimbursements made by the committee will be to ensure transparency.\n\n### The Committee Details\n\nGas Supply Committee powers are enforced by 3/5 multisig ([0x5181d5D56Af4f823b96FE05f062D7a09761a5a53](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5181d5D56Af4f823b96FE05f062D7a09761a5a53)) with following signers:\n\n- [zuzu_eeka](https://research.lido.fi/u/zuzu_eeka) - [0x004812da927b5DCd07e7329609eDD75E25d2d295](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-depositor-bot-in-ethereum/1881/4)\n- [Raman](https://research.lido.fi/u/Raman_Siamionau) - [0x56aAaF3e07507C3f2554c4087b0f3ECC61F78a9e](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-depositor-bot-in-ethereum/1881/3)\n- [skozin](https://research.lido.fi/u/skozin) - [0x2CAE3a4D4c513026Ecc6af94A4BA89Df31c8cEA3](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-depositor-bot-in-ethereum/1881)\n- [George](https://research.lido.fi/u/George) - [0x912e21CdA3D7012146da4Df33309d860a9eb0bEb](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-depositor-bot-in-ethereum/1881/2)\n- [kadmil](https://research.lido.fi/u/kadmil) - [0x9A3f38AF97b791C85c043D46a64f56f87E0283D4](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-depositor-bot-in-ethereum/1881)\n\n### Background\n\nLido on X protocols require gas payments for different operations. For instance, in case of the Lido on Ethereum the main day-to-day ops required for protocol functioning are deposits & Oracle reports. Ether submitted by the protocol users is buffered on [Lido stETH contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xae7ab96520DE3A18E5e111B5EaAb095312D7fE84) until it is deposited to the Consensus Layer.\n\nDepositor bot ([source code](https://github.com/lidofinance/depositor-bot)) performs deposit transactions and simultaneously monitors the current gas price on Ethereum to prevent excessive spending of ETH during sudden spikes in short-term gas prices.\n\nLido DAO has approved funding for this task ([proposal #1](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-depositor-bot-in-ethereum/1881), [snapshot #1](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x712919976dc89777faecda7b346713664498fe572542f767e19cf9aa4f9fd7ae), [proposal #2](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-depositor-bot-in-ethereum-2/2147), [snapshot #2](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x54677d5196806e4bd05a55f204dc420208ebff2440a0db6b69f5a3c949506724), [proposal #3](https://research.lido.fi/t/gas-funding-request/4571), [Aragon](https://vote.lido.fi/vote/156)). The committee also [compensates mainnet Oracles gas expense](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xcbf534335fe07c046caa933e1623ac38bfb3d1890ab825264a0b47415cf7799b) and there is a [proposal to compensate for gas Lido on Polygon](https://research.lido.fi/t/funding-for-lido-on-polygon-depositor-bot/4431).\n\n### History Of Funding\n\nPrevious rounds of gas expense compensations were made quarterly and soon after the last round that took place in May 2022 gas expenses dropped significantly, which in turn built up a long runway for this activity.\n\nRecently gas expenses have risen due to an increased depositing activity ([over 1M ETH were deposited](https://dune.com/queries/96270/192785) into Lido protocol since the end of Feb 2023) followed by [recent gas price rise](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_gas_price) in May 2023.\n\n![https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/a/a3cb3df272c13247097d3d0fba413c610d6fd427_2_690x333.png](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/a/a3cb3df272c13247097d3d0fba413c610d6fd427_2_690x333.png)\n\n![https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/0/0764ef62057fe738c721e1c39a08c5d214af3b50_2_690x414.png](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/lido/optimized/2X/0/0764ef62057fe738c721e1c39a08c5d214af3b50_2_690x414.png)\n\n- *please note that 31/05/2023 illustrates May only up to the 21st day.*\n\nAlthough there is a reasonable doubt that gas expense per 1 ETH deposited into Lido on Ethereum will stay as high as it is in May 2023, it’s necessary to ensure deposits made in a timely manner to affect higher APRs (ETH in the intermediate buffer not staked) and funds are secured.\n\nThe amount of data that Oracles report will also significantly increase after withdrawals introduction, which will lead to an increase of gas spent to some degree.",

      "title": "Launchnodes - Impact Staking with Lido",
      "content": "## TL;DR\n\nLaunchnodes has been at the forefront of Impact Staking for ETH since its launch in 2020, where staking rewards fund projects addressing global issues. Impact Stakers pledge a portion of their rewards, while receiving their initial staked capital back at an agreed time. Funded projects must provide clear metrics to demonstrate their efficacy, allowing Impact Stakers to monitor their impact. Effective projects receive ongoing funding, while ineffective projects are quickly remedied.\n\nThis grant proposal is to enable Lido on Ethereum stakers to pledge some or all of their staking rewards to projects that require ongoing funding. Projects are expected to include initiatives from UNICEF, GiveDirectly, Save The Children and other leading global organizations. It is anticipated that individuals and entities such as foundations and family offices will consider Impact Staking through Lido in the future.\n\nThe 3 initial causes to which Lido Impact Staking rewards are planned to be targeted are:\n\n| Cause / Project | Project Delivery | KPIs / Outcome Tracked |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Net Zero Ethereum | Treedom | Carbon Offset (tonnes/CO2) vs Ethereum footprint |\n| Internet Connectivity for Schools | UNICEF Giga | Number of schools connected to the Internet |\n| Lifting People Out of Poverty | Give Directly | Number of people lifted out of poverty |\n\nThese 3 projects have huge global potential to improve lives, and to reduce the carbon footprint of the Ethereum network.\n\nAll aspects of the web3 infrastructure and implementation for Impact Staking with Lido are intended to be fully transparent and visible in public repos and on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n## Scope of Work\n\nBefore the project proceeds, Launchnodes will engage with an international tax specialist to ensure it operates in a tax-efficient manner. They will also confirm that the KYC and AML requirements are met for partner organizations. A highly visual website and dashboard will be created to display real-time information on ETH staked, donations, and impact. \nThe three core aspects of the project are: \n\n- the Lido Impact Staking Smart Contract\n- Impact Staking User Interface to Pledge Returns and View Impact\n- Project Interface and Metrics\n\nYou can read more about mentioned project parts in [the proposal](https://research.lido.fi/t/launchnodes-impact-staking-with-lido-grant-proposal/3732/8#scope-of-work-5).\n\nThe grant will fund all three components, but the final security and smart contract review will be funded by Launchnodes or its ecosystem partners.\n\n## Risk: Response & Mitigation\n\n**1: Causes may not suit crypto natives.**\n\n- 3 high profile global issues have been selected with large, trusted partners.\n- The architecture and model will be developed for multiple different causes to be represented and achieve donations.\n- Alternatives will continue to be added if initial causes don't resonate.\n- Feedback, proposals, and partnerships will be sought from potential stakers.\n\n**2: The initiative will fail due to insufficient/ineffective marketing.**\n\n- The 3 initial causes chosen have global marketing capabilities.\n- The memetic website should be highly visually appealing and have elements to increase global visibility and reach.\n- Launchnodes has established an Impact Staking working group and plans to actively spend additional marketing funds.\n\n**3: The approach and mechanics do not meet the needs of donors/philanthropists.**\n\n- The advantageous tax treatment of impact staking rewards donated to a good cause will be investigated and confirmed.\n- Additional projects/causes with greater appeal will be sought if necessary.\n\n**4: The Lido Impact Staking initiative falters after an initially successful project.**\n\n- The project has been designed to be self-sustaining for the long-term, after successful go-live.\n\n## Grant Request\n\nBreakdown Timeline for each of the following components:\n\n1. Understanding Tax, KYC, AML Requirements - 4 weeks\n2. Lido Impact Staking Smart Contract - 12 weeks\n3. Impact Staking - User Interface to Pledge Returns - 4 weeks\n4. Impact Staking - Project Interface and Metrics - 6 weeks\n5. Security Review - Full External Security Review of Smart Contract and Systems (to be executed in coordination with the [Lido Audits Committee](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-on-ethereum-form-audits-committee/3481))\n\nTotal Project Duration: 6 months (Development) + 1 month (External Security Review)\n\n(2 Smart Contract Engineers, 1 Front End Engineer, 1 Back End Engineer, 1 Test Engineer, 1 External Security Audit Team)\n\n## Access\n\nAccess and ongoing support relating to all features outlined in the Scope of Work proposed above is planned for at least 12 months after completion of the full scope of the proposal.\n\nIt is intended that the platform and Impact Staking as an initiative will grow at pace throughout 2023 and beyond, and that the project components will continue to be built upon, supported and maintained - either by Launchnodes directly, or through a community approach with a dedicated DAO or similar structure.\n\n## Grants and Payment\n\nFor the Scope of Work proposed above, Launchnodes is requesting a $300,000 grant with the following structure for execution:\n\n- Agreement to proceed, contingent upon tax benefits of charitable giving applying to Impact Staking\n- Tax law opinion received (US jurisdiction) on whether there is parity between direct charitable giving, and donation of impact staking rewards - Launchnodes to fund\n- 25% upon project initiation\n- 15% upon successful external security review and satisfactory resolution of Medium, High, and Critical-level issues highlighted - the external security audit team will be engaged in coordination with the Lido Audits Committee\n- 60% after the first $3m has generated in funding for Impact Staking projects across all Lido Impact Staking vaults\n\nThis model ensures that 60% of the project’s fees are contingent upon Lido Impact Staking engaging a meaningful volume of supportive Impact Stakers.\n\nIn case this proposal accepted by the Lido DAO, grants to be disbursed in DAI from [LEGO committee multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x12a43b049A7D330cB8aEAB5113032D18AE9a9030) upon completion of above mentioned milestones. For that purpose LEGO multisig is to be funded via [Easy Track motions](https://easytrack.lido.fi/).\n\n## Ongoing Maintenance, Support and Growth\n\nLaunchnodes can support the Lido Impact Staking platform by becoming a node operator, which would provide a revenue stream for the platform's maintenance and expansion. Launchnodes could also operate nodes for organizations like Save the Children or UNICEF, with Lido's operating model enabling them to receive funds for upkeep. Alternatively, Launchnodes could charge a small percentage of rewards or total staked amount to remain sustainable long-term.\n\n## Initial Impact Projects and Causes\n\nAll projects will be required to provide ongoing data on all of the Key Performance Indicators being tracked as part of their project delivery, eg. tonnes of CO2 offset. This will drive the real-time data on the Lido Impact Staking dashboards. \n[More details about initial Projects and Causes](https://research.lido.fi/t/launchnodes-impact-staking-with-lido-grant-proposal/3732/8#initial-impact-projects-and-causes-16).",

      "content": "### **TL;DR**\n\nA second vote on whether the `39.8` ETH that flowed into the Lido DAO Treasury, as a result of an exploited vulnerability in [SushiSwap RouteProcessor2](https://twitter.com/MetaSleuth/status/1644940303466647553), should be sent to [sifuvision.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x31d3243CfB54B34Fc9C73e1CB1137124bD6B13E1) (the affected party) as an expression of goodwill?\n\nThe previous vote was split 67% / 33% in favour of sending the ETH, but quorum [was not reached](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x211ebdacbfae9d3492ff9e096b6f7be8a58bd48cd9eb8fc57454575b68bd6fc1). \n\n## Motivation\n\nUntangling [the original post and discussion](https://research.lido.fi/t/sushi-routeprocessor2-post-exploit-request-for-comment/4383), two, largely orthogonal, decisions at hand may be derived:\n\n1. A decision on an outflow of `39.8 ETH` from the Lido DAO treasury to help Sushi (this is the amount which came into the treasury as a result of the exploit).\n2. A wider policy decision on whether or not the DAO should ever act as an arbiter between stakers, node operators, and third parties – and if so, how, and under what conditions.\n\nThe discussion under the original post has revolved almost entirely around the second decision – yet this has not been made clear within the discussion itself.\n\nTo minimize the risk of decisions, on both fronts, being made for the wrong reasons, it makes sense to move these two decisions into separate threads where they can be discussed individually.\n\n## Key points\n\nConcerns of the type that [Hasu](https://research.lido.fi/t/sushi-routeprocessor2-post-exploit-request-for-comment/4383/7) and [Misha](https://research.lido.fi/t/sushi-routeprocessor2-post-exploit-request-for-comment/4383/5) have raised in the [original thread](https://research.lido.fi/t/sushi-routeprocessor2-post-exploit-request-for-comment/4383/) are not especially relevant to this initial decision at hand.\n\nIn particular:\n\n- Lido DAO does not a priori need a broader framework to make decisions on what to do about unexpected treasury inflows.\n- Voting in favour of this decision does not turn the Lido DAO into an arbiter or open up a slippery slope that could detract from its\nneutrality.\n\n### Voting options\n\n- Send `39.8 ETH` to `sifuvision.eth`\n- No action\n\nActual transfer in case of approval by Lido DAO be done via Aragon on-chain vote.",

Most of the underspend comes from slower than expected contracting plans, as much of the development teams for PML and ATC have been intensely tied up behind delivering withdrawals. \nThe excess will be returned, or, effectively, deducted from Lido-v2 if approved.\n[Link to the detailed retrospective](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-v2-may-1-2023-december-31-2023-lido-ongoing-grant-request/4476#retrospective-on-lido-1-and-roadmap-for-2023-6).\n\n## Overview of Budget Request for LIDO-v2\n\n*[Estimated protocol economics based on publicly available blockchain data can be found here](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-v2-may-1-2023-december-31-2023-lido-ongoing-grant-request/4476#overview-of-budget-request-for-lido-v2-7).\nSteakhouse Financial will be releasing the full set of protocol economic statements next as well as the underlying query for the community to review and comment.*\n\n2021 and 2022 were years of tremendous growth for Lido, which has been a bulwark for decentralization in Ethereum staking against centralized players. In particular, Lido’s strong position puts it in an advantageous situation relative to new centralized liquid staking tokens such as Liquid Collective ([Alluvial](https://alluvial.finance/)).\n\nIn order to deliver as a credible decentralized alternative, Lido needs to quickly turn its attention from enabling withdrawals to the Lido v2 roadmap. In particular, this will require focusing development teams contracting with PML and ATC into a few key areas of focus:\n\n- Engineering Coordination\n- stETH Core Protocol Engineering\n- Validator Set Engineering for the Staking Router\n- Alerting and Monitoring Tooling\n- Community Module\n- Governance Core Protocol Engineering\n- API & Components\n\nThis will likely bring a higher requirement in terms of contractors. \nCurrently there are ~80 FTE equivalent contractors working across PML and ATC right now (vs 96 budgeted). For v2, the teams expect to complete their original roadmap for hiring and add a further ~25 FTE equivalent contractors in capacity to support new engineering or tech efforts over the course of the next 8mos. PML and ATC have both recommended budgeting conservatively on the presumption that this workforce will come online from day 1, however, it is likely some run up will result in budget underspend towards the last quarter of the year.\n\n## Auditing costs\n\nSufficient budget will be provisioned for auditing expenses to carry Lido DAO through to the end of 2023. We are reserving the right to selectively not disclose specific amounts.\n\n## Other expenses\n\nThe DAO will make available a dedicated travel budget for contributors to be able to travel to conferences and to in-person meetings. Steakhouse Financial has benchmarked against other organizations and taken into account real-world travel needs to come up with a fair estimate of realistic and valuable travel needs for the DAO going forward. Priority is given to commercial and technical teams in this distribution, and team intentions/desires have been taken into account.\n\nOngoing marketing expenses to support the launch of v2 of up to $3m, up from LIDO-1 on the basis of new sponsorship and event opportunities in non-US regions.\n\nThe request continues to ring-fence a dedicated line item for ongoing legal research and external legal work as needed.\n\n# Liquidity incentives, sales & marketing\n\nIt does not take much to see that Lido DAO has been spending a considerable amount of capital on liquidity incentives in 2022 and the beginning of 2023.\n\nSteakhouse Financial has been a [firm advocate](https://research.lido.fi/t/pid-regulated-liquidity-control/3969) of bringing this under control and we have helped [drive research](https://research.lido.fi/t/objective-based-liquidity-design-for-steth-and-directions-for-further-research/4156) in this direction to substantiate our beliefs. On the back of these findings, we are supportive of [engaging domain experts](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-developing-a-sustainable-objective-based-liquidity-incentive-engine-for-new-venues/4252) to support further research around ROI for incentive-based spending, combined with a hard cap of 4m DAI equivalent for domain and liquidity incentives in total.\n\nIn particular, for liquidity, this cap will be distributed to the [reWARDS Committee](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-form-rewards-committee/1447) as a hard stop for any further liquidity incentivization. With withdrawals opening up, the need for ongoing spending on liquidity pools draws to a close and we must reign in and focus our efforts where there is the maximum potential benefit for stETH users, rather than default to rewarding LPs.\n\nNotably, this new campaign will no longer be funded by issuing LDO tokens but instead by deploying stETH the protocol generates in the course of its operation.\n\nShould the research by domain experts demonstrate the possibilities for use of capital that effectively improves the quality of stETH for its users, a new budget could be reconsidered through a new request in a few months.\n\n# TRP Amendments\n\nThe [TRP Program conditions](https://research.lido.fi/t/lidodao-token-rewards-plan-trp/3364) will be amended according to the specifications described in the proposal actions section. The intention is to prevent the emergence of edge cases that are unfair to the DAO. None of these edge cases have taken place yet.",

      "content": "The Arbitrum Foundation has announced that the Lido DAO is eligible for the ARB airdrop. According to the documentation of the airdrop ([$ARB airdrop eligibility and distribution specifications | Arbitrum DAO - Governance docs](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/airdrop-eligibility-distribution#dao-airdrop-criteria-and-distribution)) Lido DAO is eligible to claim 772,621 ARB tokens. \n\nIn response to this airdrop, [the Lido DAO reWARDS committee](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-form-rewards-committee/1447) puts forward the following proposal. This proposal covers operational and strategic topics related to claiming and making productive use of the potential ARB tokens or any other token airdrop to which Lido DAO may be entitled in the future. If passed, this proposal will enable the reWARDS committee to pursue the continued growth of staking and the wstETH DeFi ecosystem on Arbitrum One (and beyond).\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation governance documentation shares that there are no specific conditions on the distribution of these tokens, but that the hope and intent is that each DAO will determine how to best participate in the governance and growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem using these tokens.\n\nYou may find more details about current State of wstETH on Arbitrum Network [in this forum post](https://research.lido.fi/t/arbitrum-arb-token-airdrop-acceptance/4393).\n\n### **Proposal**\n\n**This proposal has several elements:**\n\n**A)** Acknowledging the offer of 772,621 ARB tokens from the Arbitrum Foundation as part of their airdrop.\n\n**B)** Designating emissaries for the Lido DAO that will contact the Arbitrum Foundation to communicate that the Lido DAO will accept the airdrop and begin the claiming process, and authority to do the same for future airdrops.\n\n**C)** Appointing the Lido DAO reWARDS committee to be an emissary of the DAO for the item “B”.\n\n**D)** Affirming the authority for the reWARDS Committee to use the claimed tokens to pursue the growth of staking ether on the Arbitrum DeFi and other chains / ecosystems, and re-confirming the growth and expansion of stToken use across all supported networks is within the original mandate of the reWARDS Committee. ([Proposal to form reWARDS Committee](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-form-rewards-committee/1447))\n\n**E)** Proposing the creation of a 4/7 reWARDS Committee multisig on Arbitrum.\n\nThe reWARDS committee will create a new multi signature wallet on the Arbitrum One network, which will be used to receive the ARB tokens.

The reWARDS committee has, via the monthly LDO reWARDS budget, already established baseline liquidity across the core wstETH-ETH and wstETH-USDC trading pairs. This will continue and be matched with ARB token incentives.\n\nSuch collaborations will offer LPs the benefit of the baseline rewards of Lido staked-ETH as well as ARB token co-incentives from Lido reWARDS and our collaborators. In addition, the reWARDS committee will continue to apply token incentives to user activity on non-dex protocols to bootstrap the staking, availability, and use of wstETH. The end result should be a vibrant, unique, and attractive DeFi ecosystem for all Lido users and Arbitrum Network stakeholders.\n\nThe reWARDS committee will open up a process for all Arbitrum Ecosystem protocols to initiate an incentives collaboration with the reWARDS committee.

This will include a monthly report posted in the original proposal thread which will detail which user activities have been incentivized, with how many ARB tokens, and will include a summary of the performance of the incentives campaign that month.\n\n### **Start Date**\n\nShould this proposal be passed, the reWARDS Committee will make every effort to put in place all of the above as quickly as possible.",

      "content": "Following the [draft outlining policy updates, as discussed on the forums](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-validator-exits-policy-draft-for-discussion/3864), this proposal proposes v1.0 of the [Lido on Ethereum Validator Exits Policy](https://lido.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmUK16fKPYVreKaJeaseP9n4z7cm2Yi1GadWPLf474kFt4), which covers validator exit mechanisms, goals, scope, policy statements, monitoring, penalties, and other considerations.\n\n## Policy document outline and summary\n\n- With the V2 upgrade of Lido on Ethereum, validator exits may be required in order to meet potential user (staker) withdrawal requests (e.g. when size of the withdrawal request exceeds the amount of ETH available in the buffer for withdrawal-related use).\n- This policy establishes the duties and requirements that Node Operators participating in the Lido on Ethereum protocol must adhere to with regards to the monitoring and processing of validator exit requests issued by the protocol.\n- The order of validator exits is deterministic, prioritizing exits from the Node Operators with the *largest amount of active validators* and *always exiting the “oldest” validators first*.\n- Validator exit requests will be signaled on-chain via the Lido on Ethereum Exit-Bus Oracle. Node Operators must monitor these events and timely process validator exits pertaining to validators that they operate in a timely manner.\n- Failure to process exit requests in a timely manner will lead to delinquency which will cause Node Operators to receive reduced rewards until service is restored. This will be automatically enforced on-chain.\n- Sustained delinquency without adequate communication and steps for remediation may result in the off-boarding of a Node Operator based on a DAO vote.\n- Node Operators must always communicate proactively with the community in the case of out of order exits (i.e. exits not signaled by the protocol) or in the case that mass exits may need to be performed to provide the DAO enough time potentially respond via a vote.\n\n## **Below are key excerpts in the Policy for summary purposes. Please consult the full Policy for details**\n\n### **B.1 Goals**\n\nValidator exits may be utilized by fully-functioning staking protocols, including Lido, for the following reasons:\n\n- In order to satisfy withdrawal redemption requests from users (e.g. if a withdrawal request is larger than the amount of stake that can be made available for redemption via only partial withdrawals / skimming).\n- To reallocate stake across the operator set (move stake from one operator to another) for a variety of reasons (e.g. substandard performance, guiding principles from the Operator Set Strategy).\n- To rotate signing keys for some validators without changing the stake allocation.\n\nThe proposed V2 upgrade of Lido on Ethereum protocol would put in place a series of mechanisms based on on-chain signaling that will serve to notify Node Operators who participate in the protocol when they need to process validator exits.\n\n### **B.2 Scope**\n\nThis policy applies to the Lido on Ethereum protocol, the Node Operators that participate in the curated Node Operator registry (“Node Operator(s)”), and the validators that they operate as a part of the protocol. Validators outside of the curated registry are currently out of scope of this policy but may be included in later revisions.\n\n### **B.3 Policy Statement**\n\n**B.3.I Validator Exit Order**\n\nThe exit sequence of Lido on Ethereum validators (i.e. validators submitted to Lido Node Operator Registries which have been deposited to) should follow a deterministic order so that they can be computed independently and trustlessly if needed. The current proposal for exit order is the “combined approach” discussed in the relevant topic [“Withdrawals: on Validator Exiting Order”](https://research.lido.fi/t/withdrawals-on-validator-exiting-order/3048/1).\n\n**B.3.II Performance Expectations Over Time**\n\nAs this is a new policy concerning new functionality of the Ethereum protocol, the proposed enforcement mechanisms, service level expectations, and associated timeframes detailed in this first version of the policy are mild enough to allow for working out initial kinks without an unreasonable penalty. Once the processes and mechanisms around the automation of validators exits have matured, this policy should be revised. In particular, time windows for service level expectations should be tightened and penalties for non-performance should be increased.\n\n**B.3.III Node Operator Responsibilities**\n\nNode Operators who participate in the Lido on Ethereum protocol have a duty to correctly exit validators in a timely manner as determined by the protocol’s requirements and rules (as set by the DAO). If they are requested to exit validators ( via signalling using oracles or the exit daemon infrastructure) by the protocol for any of the reasons described in the section [“B1-Goals” and as per the validator exit order approved by the DAO.](https://lido.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmUK16fKPYVreKaJeaseP9n4z7cm2Yi1GadWPLf474kFt4#B1-Goals)\n\nIn order to determine whether Node Operators have appropriately executed the required actions, this policy seeks to outline the time that Node Operators are afforded to do so, and what the penalties for non-conformance should be.\n\nGenerally speaking, Node Operators are expected to exit the indicated validators in a reasonable time frame. The actual mechanisms for validators to be exited are at the discretion of Node Operators, and open source tooling will be available to aid Node Operators in identifying signaled validator exit requests, as well as in processing these requests.\n…\n\nFor clarity:\n\n- A validator exit request is considered “signaled” once it is retrievable from the on-chain Exit Bus Oracle report (finalized on-chain multiple times per day).\n- A validator exit request is considered “processed” once it has been broadcast to the CL and included in a proposed Beacon Chain slot.\n- A validator exit request is considered “fulfilled” once the validator has been fully exited and withdrawn.\n\n**B.3.IV Monitoring and Penalties**\n\n…\n\nIf Node Operators are processing signaled validator exit requests as soon as they are available, the shortest possible time for a validator exit request to go from “signaled” to “processed” will be somewhere within the range of a few minutes to an hour. With respect to validator exit performance, each Node Operator may be considered to have one of the below three statuses.\n\n- In good standing - validator exit requests are being processed fully, correctly, and timely.\n- Delayed - validator exit requests are being processed incompletely, incorrectly, or not within the desired time frame.\n- Delinquent - validator exit requests are being processed incompletely, incorrectly, or not within the maximum acceptable time frame.\n\n| Event | Requirement to not be considered Delayed | Requirement not be considered Delinquent |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Processing of signaled validator exit requests | All signaled requests are processed ASAP (no longer than 1 day) | Some signaled requests are taking longer than 1 but less than 4 days to process |\n| Escalation of inability to execute signaled validator exit request with reason | ASAP but no longer than 1 day | ASAP but no longer than 4 days |\n\n…\n\n- If a Node Operator has a status of Delinquent, NOM workstream will raise a formal issue with the Node Operator on the Lido research forum. While a Node Operator has a status of Delinquent:\n    - no new stake will be allocated to the Node Operator (this will happen automatically);\n    - the daily rewards sent to the Node Operator will halve (with the remaining half sent towards that day’s rebase) (this will happen automatically). Reduced rewards will continue for the duration of a cooldown period long enough to determine whether, immediately after service restoration by the Node Operator, subsequently received validator exit requests are processed in a timely manner.\n\n…\n\n- Once a Delinquent Node Operator has processed all signaled validator exit requests (and thus their number of Delinquent validators in next Accounting Oracle report is updated to 0), they will recommence receiving validator exit requests. Their status shall revert to “In good standing” after 5 days (i.e. provided any newly received validator exit requests are processed timely). During this 5 day “cooldown period” they will continue to not receive new stake and receive halved rewards.\n\n**B.3.V Out of Order Exits and NO Business Continuity**\n…\n\nIf at any time a Node Operator is unable to continue to participate in the Lido on Ethereum protocol (e.g. has become insolvent), it must notify the DAO via the Lido forums ([https://research.lido.fi](https://research.lido.fi/)) of the circumstances and signal its intent to exit all of the validators that it operates as a part of the protocol. If the DAO does not otherwise instruct the Node Operator via a ratified vote within 8 days, it must proceed with triggering the exit of all of the validators.\n\n## **Reference:**\n\nFull policy document: [IPFS](https://lido.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmUK16fKPYVreKaJeaseP9n4z7cm2Yi1GadWPLf474kFt4) (V1.0), [GitHub](https://github.com/lidofinance/documents-and-policies/blob/7595317b8fd2ee60ab25f5cac8eac2cc2cafa149/Lido%20on%20Ethereum%20-%20Validator%20Exits%20Policy.md) (V1.0), [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/zHYFZr4eRGm3Ju9_vkcSgQ?both) (current version, previous ones available via Options → Versions)\n\n## **Voting Options:**\n\n**For:** *Implement the Lido on Ethereum Validator Exits Policy as described above.*\n\n**Against:** *Do not implement the Lido on Ethereum Validator Exits Policy as described above.*",

      "content": "## Proposal\n\nShould the `39.8 ETH` that flowed into the Lido DAO Treasury, as a result of an exploited vulnerability in [SushiSwap RouteProcessor2](https://twitter.com/MetaSleuth/status/1644940303466647553), be sent to [sifuvision.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x31d3243CfB54B34Fc9C73e1CB1137124bD6B13E1) (the affected party) as an expression of goodwill?\n\n## Motivation\n\nUntangling [the original post and discussion](https://research.lido.fi/t/sushi-routeprocessor2-post-exploit-request-for-comment/4383), two, largely orthogonal, decisions at hand may be derived:\n\n1. A decision on an outflow of `39.8 ETH` from the Lido DAO treasury to help Sushi (this is the amount which came into the treasury as a result of the exploit).\n2. A wider policy decision on whether or not the DAO should ever act as an arbiter between stakers, node operators, and third parties – and if so, how, and under what conditions.\n\nThe discussion under the original post has revolved almost entirely around the second decision – yet this has not been made clear within the discussion itself.\n\nTo minimize the risk of decisions, on both fronts, being made for the wrong reasons, it makes sense to move these two decisions into separate threads where they can be discussed individually.\n\n## Key points\n\nConcerns of the type that [Hasu](https://research.lido.fi/t/sushi-routeprocessor2-post-exploit-request-for-comment/4383/7) and [Misha](https://research.lido.fi/t/sushi-routeprocessor2-post-exploit-request-for-comment/4383/5) have raised in the [original thread](https://research.lido.fi/t/sushi-routeprocessor2-post-exploit-request-for-comment/4383/) are not especially relevant to this initial decision at hand.\n\nIn particular:\n\n- Lido DAO does not a priori need a broader framework to make decisions on what to do about unexpected treasury inflows.\n- Voting in favour of this decision does not turn the Lido DAO into an arbiter or open up a slippery slope that could detract from its\nneutrality.\n\n### Voting options\n\n- No action\n- Send `39.8 ETH` to `sifuvision.eth`\n\nActual transfer in case of approval by Lido DAO be done via Aragon on-chain vote.",

      "title": "Proposal to approve Lido DAO Treasury Management Principles and authorize the formation of a Treasury Management Committee",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal is asking for the approval of a few key **Treasury Management Principles (Principles)**, and the creation of a **Treasury Management Committee (Committee)** to put forward **Treasury Management Strategies (Strategies)** constrained by the **Principles**, and **Treasury Management Actions (Actions)** to execute them using **On-chain tools**.\n\n \n![image(1).png](ipfs://bafkreibfuwuo7jevntrqdh4l5nlurwwe7r7gs2xqeiew3ox54tpor27iku)\n    \n\n## Treasury Management Principles\n\n1. **ETH is Lido DAO’s primary Unit of Account, interchangeable with stETH through deposits and withdrawals using Lido protocol.**\n2. **Lido DAO’s treasury is the source of its resilience and future growth, and can fund initiatives that further the protocol’s decentralization and network security objectives**\n    1.  The purpose of Lido DAO’s treasury is to support the integrity, growth and robustness of the Lido protocols\n    2.  The treasury may also be used for funding many initiatives, including but not limited to, research, maintenance, development, education and advocacy that further the decentralization and network security objectives of the protocol\n3. **Risk of loss to treasury funds should be minimized at every instance**\n4. **All treasury ETH must be staked using Lido**\n5. **Token holders have the ultimate say**\n    1. Token holder decisions can amend and update the Principles, as well as override the Committee through separate on-chain votes\n\n*(nb. 20,304 ETH at time of writing)\n\n## Treasury Management Committee\n\n1. **A Committee should be formed to maintain and execute policies**\n    1. Token holders authorize the formation of a **Treasury Management Committee** composed of members (alt. signers) around a multisig that will be allowed to submit a narrow set of possible **Strategies** and activate their corresponding on-chain **Actions**, constrained through **On-chain tools**\n    2. The **Committee** multisig will strictly never take custody of Aragon funds and will use a suitable technical solution for executing swaps in a permissionless way\n    3. This 4/7 multisig will be composed of 7 individual members or entities and will not be authorized to function with fewer than 7 members\n    4. A new signer who doesn’t otherwise participate in the Token Rewards Program will be eligible to participate. This will enhance governance decentralization of Lido DAO by adding new members over time consistent with the loyalty to the project. These signers would be eligible to receive the equivalent of 25 ETH a year in LDO tokens, priced on the day the signer joins the multisig for the first time (subject to usual TRP rules including milestones, for example current version of TRP LDO exchange rate calculation is “calculated as the trailing 180-day close price of LDO, using the following [Dune query](https://dune.com/queries/1080098?symbol_t6c1ea=LDO)”)\n    5. If any signer fails to register their approval or rejection on at least 50% of the **Actions** proposed in a given year, their TRP program membership (if any) will forfeit and the signer will be rotated from the multisig and removed from the **Committee**\n    6. Members will retain membership of the **Committee** until they offboard either of their own accord or by token holder demand, forfeiting any pending TRP tokens, and leaving the multisig seat open for new prospective members to be approved by token holders\n    7. Deliberations, **Strategies**, and **Actions** will be communicated transparently to the DAO and the community is encouraged to engage, propose and participate\n    8. New prospective members can apply in public forums to empty **Committee** seats and request approval of their inclusion into the Committee by token holders, an approval which will instruct the **Committee** to rotate the new member/s onto the empty place/s on the multisig\n2. **Committee may submit Strategies and enact Actions**\n    1. All **Strategies** must be encodable into Actions through On-chain tools\n    2. All deployed on-chain **Actions** will allow for at least 72h of token holder veto periods prior to deployment or execution\n    3. The Committee will submit these Strategies in the following way:\n        1. The committee will publish a forum post submitting the **Strategy** (e.g. sell stETH in Aragon for one of a pre approved list of tokens)\n        2. No sooner than 7 days from the moment it is published, the treasury multisig can initiate the start of an on-chain **Action** or series of **Actions**\n    4. The **Committee** will regularly provide transparency reports\n3. **Committee may propose modifications to authorized Strategies**\n    1. The **Committee** may elect to propose changes or new **Strategies**, provided they are encodable into **Actions** through **On-chain tools**\n        1. To enact a new rule or change, the **Committee** will publish a forum post outlining the change to request comments and allow for a feasibility study\n        2. No sooner than 7 days from the moment it is published, if suitable as an on-chain **Action**, token holders will vote on the approval of the deployment of an on-chain **Action** to reflect the new **Strategy**, or change in **Strategy**\n    2. The **Committee** will maintain an up-to-date frontend listing the **Principles**, all of the **Strategies** they are authorized to submit and links to the relevant on-chain **Treasury Actions** for these rules\n    3. The **Committee** will only be able to propose changes or new rules provided 4/7 members register their agreement with the proposal\n    4. Community members may propose a new **Strategy** to the **Committee** for consideration, but the **Committee** will need 3/5 members to register their agreement prior to submitting these changes\n4. **Committee mandate is bounded by token holder approval**\n    1. Token holders may choose to dissolve the **Committee** at any time through a vote, following which the **Committee** will disband, terminate the TRP if necessary and remove its access from any on-chain motions\n    2. Should an overall governance framework be agreed on by token holders at a later date, this could lead to the ratification, modification or dissolution of the **Committee**\n5. **Committee’s ultimate objective is to automate itself**\n    1. The **Committee** is charged, in the long-term, with identifying and implementing ways of automating its deliberations and replacing the function of the **Committee** with permissionless smart contracts with no dependencies, capable of replacing the above workflow in a neutral manner\n\n## On-chain tools\n\nThese are on-chain contracts or function calls, such as EasyTrack motions or Aragon votes, that can execute any **Actions** triggered by the **Committee** multisig. Token holders authorize the **Committee** to request the development of new **Actions** to the Lido Contributors Group. Alternatively, token holders authorize the **Committee** to propose development projects to the Lido Contributors Group, with separate funding requirements, if needed. Any new development must undergo strict security procedures and audits prior to being used in production.\n\n## Treasury Management Strategies\n\nAn example of the **Strategies** that could be submitted by the **Committee** are the following:\n\n- Hold no more than 6mos of estimated working capital to fund research, development, education and advocacy initiatives (based on approved budgets) in stablecoins in Aragon\n- Hold only DAI, LUSD and USDT in stablecoin reserves (60% USDT, 40% DAI)\n- Only use CoW Swap as a preapproved trading venue\n\n## Treasury Management Actions\n\nAn example of the **Actions** that could be executed by the **Committee** are the following:\n\n- Stake any ETH held in the Aragon treasury using Lido\n- Sell stETH or any other tokens in Aragon for one of a list of preapproved stables through a preapproved trading venue\n\nThe example flow for enacting a Action to sell stETH for stablecoins could look like the below:\n\n![image(2).png](ipfs://bafkreig5dnxdd4tkcgglfy33dspa3g7eqyrt3e4uf44udzd3wcpdf2bssi)\n\nThe example optimistic governance flow from **Strategy** proposal to **Action** enactment:\n \n![image(3).png](ipfs://bafkreidewamhtc6hepbqizwp5uswd6otztx7ezihz5fc55ekslot3dfyuy)\n \n\n## Initial Treasury Management Committee composition\n\nThe below slate of prospective Treasury Management Committee members helped, among others, in producing this proposal and is proposed concurrently with this vote. Note that karpatkey and @marcbcs are Lido DAO members who are not pre-existing contributors. They will be entitled to apply for membership in the TRP program based on the rules approved in the Proposal.\n\n### Composition\n\nThe proposed initial composition of the **Committee** is as follows:\n\n- @karpatkey: [0x7d4FDba7d1b22834eA75B5E45e4110Bf56E690f1](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-approve-lido-dao-treasury-management-principles-and-authorize-the-formation-of-a-treasury-management-committee/4279/30) (eligible for TRP)\n- @marcbcs: [0x98308b6dA79B47D15e9438CB66831563649Dbd94](https://etherscan.io/verifySig/17088) (eligible for TRP)\n- @steakhouse: [0x9106CBf2C882340b23cC40985c05648173E359e7](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-approve-lido-dao-treasury-management-principles-and-authorize-the-formation-of-a-treasury-management-committee/4279/31) (not eligible for TRP)\n- @pipistrella: [0x5da409e1cbDABeC67471dB01Ff956f804bb8879f](https://etherscan.io/verifySig/17027) (not eligible for TRP)\n- @sabrychiaa: [0x83a8b5c6990cbc78ffc45cbbfe5748b895973623](https://etherscan.io/verifySig/17026) (not eligible for TRP)\n- @Mol_Eliza: [0x620bd63538bf10a87214b6187f5bc85926c2971f](https://etherscan.io/verifySig/17085) (not eligible for TRP)\n- @kadmil: [0x9a3f38af97b791c85c043d46a64f56f87e0283d4](https://etherscan.io/verifySig/17025) (not eligible for TRP)\n\nNon-voting committee observers, not eligible for TRP, but motivated to contribute to discussions:\n\n- @nicole_maffeo\n- @Red_Bull",

      "content": "### Incident Summary\n\nOn April 13, 2023, 11 validators operated by RockLogic GmbH were slashed due to the duplication of validator keys in two different active clusters, causing a double vote.\n\nLido DAO contributors alerted the RockLogic team to the slashings and RockLogic subsequently brought the affected cluster offline to mitigate potential further risk. The root cause was identified by the RockLogic team and the remaining validators were steadily brought back online.\n\nThe estimated impact on stETH holders, from the time of the incident until the validators fully exit and are automatically withdrawn from the network on May 20th, is estimated to be ~13.77 ETH.\n\nFor more detail regarding the incident’s root cause, timeline, impact, and response, Please see the [Lido post mortem](https://blog.lido.fi/loe-rocklogic-gmbh-slashing-incident/) and [RockLogic post mortem](https://research.lido.fi/t/slashing-incident-involving-rocklogic-gmbh-validators-april-13-2023/4399/5).\n\n### Staker Compensation\n\nOn April 19, 2023, RockLogic GmbH [requested](https://research.lido.fi/t/slashing-incident-involving-rocklogic-gmbh-validators-april-13-2023/4399/8) that the Lido DAO utilize the [slashing cover fund](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8B3f33234ABD88493c0Cd28De33D583B70beDe35#tokentxns) to provide compensation to stakers (more [detail regarding the cover fund](https://research.lido.fi/t/redirecting-incoming-revenue-stream-from-insurance-fund-to-dao-treasury/2528)).\n\nThe actual amount of compensation will be determined following the full exit and withdrawal of the 11 validators from the network, but has been estimated to be close to ~13.77 ETH.\n\nThis vote is to decide whether the slashing cover fund should be utilized to source compensation for this incident.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nIf the snapshot vote passes, an on-chain Aragon vote will be held after May 20th (the date the validators will be withdrawn) to proceed with on-chain execution in order to compensate stETH holders via usage of the slashing cover fund.",

      "content": "Lido Node Operator Sub-governance Group (LNOSG) evaluated candidates for Lido on Polygon validators set extension on Monday, March 27th.\n\n![Polygon NOs onb.png](ipfs://bafkreievx5yyey26pxhpykqlsullarhdr35hpyjjkfxx6yolqxqnckuefq)\n\n## Evaluation Results\n\nDuring the evaluation discussion, the LNOSG suggested five applicants should be proposed for the shortlist to the DAO for on-boarding onto Lido on Polygon. All of the shortlisted applicants have confirmed their desire to join the Lido on Polygon operator set in the public onboarding thread. \n\nDuring the discussion, the LNOSG was cognizant of potential market volatility and the impact to existing Lido Node Operators currently running validator for the protocol as a potential result from increasing the set size from its current six members. The proposed shortlist balances the goals of the LNOSG’s diversification efforts on Polygon while working to limit rewards dilution for existing Node Operators.\n\nThis on-boarding round was extremely competitive with over 43 total applications and 26 eligible applications. Due to the limited size of overall the Polygon validator set, Node Operators were deemed ineligible if they are not currently running an active mainnet validator.\n\nAs a result of the LNOSG discussion, the committee suggests that on-boarding a cohort size of five is most appropriate at this time, an 83% increase in the number of Node Operators participating in the Lido on Polygon protocol.\n\nDuring the meeting on March 27, 2023, the LNOSG decided to propose the following applicants for inclusion into our node operator set for the Polygon protocol:\n\n**Shortlist** (in alphabetical order):\n\n[Bountyblok](http://bountyblok.io/)\n\n[BwareLabs](https://bwarelabs.com/)\n\n[Everstake](https://everstake.one/)\n\n[Smart Stake](http://smartstake.io/)\n\n[Stakin](https://stakin.com/)\n\nMore details can be found in [the proposal](https://research.lido.fi/t/announcement-onboarding-for-lido-on-polygon-wave-2/3747).\n\n## Next Steps\n\nFollowing the Lido DAO approval (or during the vote optimistically so that we can execute faster), the LNOSG will coordinate with the respective teams to onboard the new node operators onto Lido’s communication channels and prepare operators for inclusion onto mainnet. The estimated timeline for the new node operators to be fully on mainnet is end of April / early May.",

We have chosen to propose “Increase by 8 to 20” this time, as adding 8 more motions is the option that is between previous ones. More details can be found [on the Research Forum](https://research.lido.fi/t/increasing-number-of-active-easy-track-motions-run-simultaneously/4075).\n\n### **Background**\n\nIn the last 2 weeks of February Lido protocol experienced an active inflow of several whales, which motivated Node Operators to request staking limit increases. This resulted in Easy Track congestion as most new motions were related to increasing node operator staking limits – since February 27, a day after a huge influx of stake from one whale (200,100 ETH), there were only 16 falling under “Increase node operator staking limit” category, apart from other open categories “Top up referral partner”, “Top up LDO referral partner”, “Top up LDO TRP”.\n\nDue to the current limit on the number of concurrent Easy Track motions (12), other actors needed to wait once some motion was completed and enacted to submit theirs. More details can be found [on the Research Forum](https://research.lido.fi/t/increasing-number-of-active-easy-track-motions-run-simultaneously/4075/1).\n\n### **Proposal**\n\nWe propose to increase the limit of active/ongoing Easy Track motions, as under the current settings there could not be more than 12 simultaneous motions. The absolute top the Easy Track contract allows is 24 at the same time (this is hardcoded, and can be changed only via a contract change and redeployment of the whole Easy Track setup, but this is *not the issue of this proposal*).\n\nBased on this and to avoid an unnecessary overburden in the future, when it is unneeded and may impose a loss of potential profit, **we propose to increase by 8 to 20 active concurrent motions**.\n\n### **Please vote**\n\nYou are welcomed to vote below and help to decrease Easy Track votings overburden in the future thanks to your choice.",

      "content": "# TL;DR\n\nThis a proposal to fund Nethermind to design white-labeling resistance mechanism. The delivery will include a detailed discussion of the final design and a systematization of knowledge for white-labeling prevention, oracle systems, prediction markets, and token-curated assets. During the project, a team will investigate what the state-of-the-art is, what solutions are or will be used in practice, and how. Then we will propose concrete mechanisms to make Lido’s network white-labeling resistant. The project will be one of the steps toward enabling Lido to onboard new operators in a permissionless manner. This is a continuation of [our previous proposal](https://research.lido.fi/t/a-proposal-for-partnering-with-nethermind-to-design-a-mechanism-for-a-good-validator-set-maintenance/3000). The project will take 22 weeks, and its cost — 450 000 DAI — will be covered by Lido DAO.\n\n# Proposer and work mindset\n\n## Proposer\n\nMichał Zając on behalf of Nethermind.\n\n### About Nethermind\n\nNethermind is a team of world-class builders and researchers with expertise across several domains: Ethereum Protocol Engineering, Cryptography Research, Layer-2s, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Miner Extractable Value (MEV), Smart Contract Development, Security Auditing, and Formal Verification, among others.\n\nOur Research team comprises computer scientists, mathematicians and engineers who work on analyzing, breaking, and designing blockchain and cryptographic schemes. Our expertise and interests span the fields of [zero-knowledge](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/406) proofs, non-deterministic programming, [Distributed Validator Technology](https://medium.com/nethermind-eth/sorting-out-distributed-validator-technology-a6f8ca1bbce3), and [decentralized identity](https://nethermindeth.github.io/lido_phase_1/index.html).\n\nWorking to solve some of the most challenging problems in the blockchain space, we frequently collaborate with renowned companies and DAOs, such as Ethereum Foundation, StarkWare, Lido Finance, Gnosis Chain, Aave, Flashbots, xDai, Open Zeppelin, Forta Protocol, Energy Web, POA Network and many more. We actively contribute to Ethereum core research and development, EIPs, and network upgrades with the Ethereum Foundation and other client teams.\n\n## General work mindset\n\nThe following principles will drive the development of the protocols:\n\n- All the design considerations and risk analysis will be done with the consent of the Lido DAO.\n- All proposed solutions will come with security analysis. When available, the protocols’ security will be proven.\n- Milestones and deliverables will be small to ensure a good overview of the team’s progress.\n\n# Ideal mechanism overview\n\nAn ideal mechanism evaluates Lido’s DAO validator set according to the operator & validator set strategy described in [this note](https://hackmd.io/K6udDz1nSZOoX8t-vE98qg) by Lido. Cf. [https://research.lido.fi/t/a-proposal-for-partnering-with-nethermind-to-design-a-mechanism-for-good-validator-set-maintenance-phase-2/3668/23](https://research.lido.fi/t/a-proposal-for-partnering-with-nethermind-to-design-a-mechanism-for-good-validator-set-maintenance-phase-2/3668/23) for more details. \n\n# General objectives\n\nWe will assist Lido in creating and maintaining a permissionless and high-quality validator set mechanism. This entails:\n\n1. Designing and implementing methods to ensure that validators are run by a high-quality set of operators. In particular, each operator performs its duties on its own and does not cede them to an external party (i.e., it does not hire a white-label operator), nor is secretly associated with other operators, and ensures that its hardware and software run performantly.\n2. Conducting a thorough economic analysis to understand how the market fluctuations, or changes in the Ethereum protocol itself, can compromise the system’s security.\n\nThe project will be divided into following phases:\n\n- **Phase 1:** We survey the literature and state-of-the-art approaches to identity and attestation schemes. This phase has been completed [already](https://nethermindeth.github.io/lido_phase_1/index.html).\n- **Phase 2:** During this phase, we will survey the literature and state-of-the-art approaches to white-labeling-protection. We will focus on arbiter protocols: oracles and prediction markets, to assess they usability in this problem. Then we will propose a mechanism that utilize an arbiter protocol to fight white-labeling. We will also investigate how to disincentivize using white labeling operators. The present proposal focuses solely on this phase.\n- **Phase 2.5:** We will make a proof-of-concept implementation for the white-labeling prevention mechanism designed in Phase 2.\n- **Phase 3:** During this phase we will work on the Sybil resistance. We will prepare a survey on the state-of-the-art approaches and propose a mechanism that significantly increases the cost of creating Sybils.\n- **Phase 3.5** We will make a proof-of-concept implementation for the Sybil prevention mechanism designed in Phase 3.\n- **Phase 4**: Next, we will proceed to design solutions for assuring a good quality set of operators and economic security of the protocol. We will also describe the resources required to implement the solutions proposed in Phases 1 to 4.\n- **Phase 5:** This phase is mainly concerned with implementing the solutions designed during the previous phases. We will also research some extra topics and problems, as done in the previous phases, and afterward, we will implement them. Further information on this phase will be provided later, by the end of Phase 3.\n\n# Project Objective\n\n## Phase 2. White-labeling resistance mechanism design\n\nIn this part of the project, we will focus on one of the crucial aspects of the security of a permissionless staking protocol. Namely ensuring that operators perform their duties independently and don’t use third parties, so-called white-label operators, to do them on their behalf. An entity that runs multiple operators (whether by controlling Sybils or being a white-label operator) could have too much control over stake, and the protocol in general. This would worsen the overall health of the protocol, weaken its resistance against correlated slashing, and could introduce a single point of failure.\n\nWe emphasize that even if we ensure that all onboarding operators are honest, we still need to have a system that detects dishonest parties within the set of already onboarded operators. This is because white-label operators can be created among the onboarded operators, even if these operators honestly entered the system. The latter may happen, e.g., when one entity that runs operators buys another that also runs operators. In that case, the buying party may end up controlling too much of the stake.\n\nOur work plan for developing the white-labeling resistance will begin by researching several techniques that, we believe, have the potential to lead to a solution in isolation or as part of an amalgam. The different types of methods we will explore are listed below. In particular, we will investigate arbiter protocols. The motivation for using arbiter protocols is following — a party that suspects that some operator is a white label could raise that issue and make a corresponding prediction market where people can bet on whether they believe in the claim. Then the conflict would be resolved by an assigned resolution mechanism.\n\nThe final goal of our work will be to produce a report explaining exactly how the Lido network can use such methods.\n\n### **TASK 1** **White-labeling resistance. SoK.**\n\nWe will begin with supplementing the SoK from Phase 1 with an SoK for white-labeling resistance. We will look for such mechanisms used not only in Web3 but also in Web2 and, if necessary, real life.\n\nThis part will take 3 weeks.\n\n### **TASK 2 Arbiter protocols. SoK.**\n\nWe expect some core components to be decentralized oracles, token-curated assets, and prediction markets (with the focus on the last one). We will use these \"arbiter protocols,” as we call them, to assess whether\n\n- a prospective operator will provide good quality services and contribute to the quality of the operators’ set or\n- an already onboarded operator uses a white-label operator.\n\nAs a first step, we will prepare an SoK for the following topics:\n\n- decentralized oracles\n- prediction markets\n\nThis part will take 3 weeks.\n\n### **TASK 3 Arbiter protocols. Resolution mechanisms.**\n\nIn this part, we will design a mechanism that resolves disputes in arbiter protocols. We will propose concrete setups for decentralized oracles and prediction markets. We will specify which parties make the oracle and who resolves disputes in prediction markets. We will analyze the feasibility of using already onboarded operators as part of an oracle system. Similarly, we will also explore the idea of using LDO holders as a resolution mechanism for prediction markets and oracles. To protect operators from being unjustly accused, we will design a mechanism that allows such operators to raise a flag and notify the DAO of the resolution mechanism’s wrongdoing.\n\nThis part will take 8 weeks.\n\n### TASK 4 Heuristics against Sybils and white-labels\n\nWe will analyze the possibility of using heuristic mechanisms to detect Sybils and white labels by analyzing their behavior and setups. We will analyze the available literature on the topic and determine operators and the parameters that should be observed. Finally, we will draft a mechanism that, in conjunction with the arbiter protocol, could be used to detect Sybilling or white-labeling operator.This part will take 4 weeks.\n\n### **TASK 5 Do you trust your white-label?**\n\nWe will investigate a mechanism that will require from parties using white-label operators to trust them with some funds. More precisely, in the mechanism the party joining Lido will need to put some collateral that can be transferred using validator’s key. Hence, the collateral could be efficiently stolen by the white-labeling party that keeps the key.\n\nThis part will take 2 weeks.\n\n### **On implementation**\n\nThis phase does not contain implementation. This is since at this stage of research it is impossible to tell what should be implemented, how, and how long would it take. We will propose a proof-of-concept implementation for one of the solutions designed in TASK 4 or 5. We will submit a separate proposal for the implementation effort as soon as possible.\n\nThis phase will be completed within 22 weeks from the date of the agreement.\n\nThis phase does not contain any implementation.\n\n# Organization, Funding, and Budget\n\nThe project will be funded by Lido DAO. The DAO will pay Nethermind 450 000 DAI, of which 200 000 DAI will be paid upfront and the remaining 250 000 DAI on delivery.\n\nAt the end of the project, the LEGO council will decide whether the provided systematization of knowledge meets the agreed requirements and, if that is the case, proceed with the payment. In the case of disagreement between the LEGO assessment on the quality of the deliverables and Nethermind, Lido operators will be used as a resolution mechanism.\n\nThe payment will be made to address eth:0x237DeE529A47750bEcdFa8A59a1D766e3e7B5F91",

The upgrade enables Withdrawals and introduces the Staking Router modular architecture for Node Operators set. The mainnet upgrade along with all the parameters would be proposed for the Lido DAO approval in the on-chain Aragon vote for the upgrade closer to the hardfork dates.\n\n## High-level upgrade plan\n\nThe onchain and offchain code is undergoing security audits & formal verification now (see details below). The high-level upgrade plan is:\n1. Have Goerli testnet deployment to check how all components behave under different scenarios. Tentative dates are 7-31 March, and depend upon Goerli Shapella timing.\n3. The mainnet upgrade timing depends upon two things happening: 1) Mainnet Shapella hard fork; 2) audits and formal verification process end & all problems are mitigated. By current estimations 2) should happen before 1), but Lido on Ethereum protocol team doesn't have full control over either of them.\n\nAs the timelines for mainnet upgrade would become clear, the plans would be shared on [the Lido research forum](https://research.lido.fi/).\n\n## Upgrade scope\n\nThe major features prepared for [the upgrade](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/pull/482) are:\n\n1. [Withdrawals support](https://research.lido.fi/t/withdrawals-for-lido-on-ethereum/3690)\n   1. In-protocol withdrawals FIFO request queue\n   2. Revised protocol accounting\n   3. Facilitating validator exits\n   4. Rewards skimming\n2. [Staking Router](https://research.lido.fi/t/lip-20-staking-router/3790)\n   1. Solid architecture and interfaces for upcoming modules\n   2. Upgrade NodeOperatorRegistry resembling the curated operators set\n   3. Levers for the NOM/DAO ops\n\nThe upgrade implements several other changes as well, the most notable being a significant rewrite of the Oracle smart contract & off-chain daemon software. That’s required to support the withdrawals functionality, and make an order of magnitude more Node Operators possible.\n\nOne of the notable design V2 decisions is the introduction of the \"Bunker mode\". Lido Analytics and Tooling teams collaborated to provide [deep research](https://research.lido.fi/t/withdrawals-for-lido-on-ethereum-bunker-mode-design-and-implementation/3890) & analysis of the conditions under which it should be switched on or lifted.\n\n## Security audits & checks\n\nTo ensure the security of such a big change in the on-chain and off-chain code, Lido V2 is getting a significant amount of security audits:\n\n1. [Sigma Prime](https://sigmaprime.io/) auditing the updated dc4bc version designed for the 0x00->0x01 Withdrawal Credentials rotation ceremony.\n2. [ChainSecurity](https://chainsecurity.com/) audited the Staking Router code. ChainSecurity’s work will be used to find out potential weaknesses of the new crucial protocol part before merging it into the final protocol upgrade code. The audit report is published [on github](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits/blob/main/ChainSecurity%20Lido%20Staking%20Router%20audit%20report%2002-23.pdf).\n3. [Oxorio](https://oxor.io/) is conducting a cover to cover audit of the protocol with enabled Ethereum withdrawals code base in February-March.\n4. [Statemind](https://statemind.io/) is conducting a cover to cover audit of the protocol with an enabled Ethereum withdrawals code base in February-March.\n5. [HEXENS](https://hexens.io/) is conducting a cover to cover audit of the protocol with an enabled Ethereum withdrawals code base in February-March.\n6. [MixBytes() Camp](https://camp.mixbytes.io/) security audit contest of the protocol smart contracts is taking place in February-March\n7. [Certora](https://www.certora.com/) is the final contributor to the protocol upgrade security and is working on the full protocol audit and formal verification in February-March.\n\n## Testnet & mainnet deployments timeline \n\nThe Goerli testnet deployment for the protocol upgrade & test runs of different scenarios for the on-chain and off-chain tooling would be happening on 7—31 March. Note that the timing is dependent on both the Goerli hardfork timing & the running security assessments, so the dates are approximate at this time.\n\nThe mainnet protocol upgrade would be scheduled closer to the hardfork, as there are no exact dates yet. The goal is to have at least two finalized security audits, full testnet runs & have the protocol prepared & upgraded on the mainnet in days before the Shapella.\n\n## Signal your support\n\nThis Lido on Ethereum protocol upgrade makes the protocol feature-complete by allowing stETH to Ether withdrawals and opens a path for more experiments and collaboration with Staking Router architecture. The Lido Contributors teams working on it are asking DAO community to signal the support for the upgrade design.",

      "title": "A proposal for partnering with Nethermind to design a mechanism for a good validator set maintenance. Phase II.",
      "content": "# TL;DR\n\nThis a proposal to fund Nethermind to design white-labeling resistance mechanism. The delivery will include a detailed discussion of the final design and a systematization of knowledge for white-labeling prevention, oracle systems, prediction markets, and token-curated assets. During the project, a team will investigate what the state-of-the-art is, what solutions are or will be used in practice, and how. Then we will propose concrete mechanisms to make Lido’s network white-labeling resistant. The project will be one of the steps toward enabling Lido to onboard new operators in a permissionless manner. This is a continuation of [the previous proposal](https://research.lido.fi/t/a-proposal-for-partnering-with-nethermind-to-design-a-mechanism-for-a-good-validator-set-maintenance/3000). The project will take 22 weeks, and its cost — 450 000 DAI — will be covered by Lido DAO.\n\n# Proposer and work mindset\n\n## Proposer\n\nMichał Zając on behalf of Nethermind.\n\n### About Nethermind\n\nNethermind is a team of world-class builders and researchers with expertise across several domains: Ethereum Protocol Engineering, Cryptography Research, Layer-2s, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Miner Extractable Value (MEV), Smart Contract Development, Security Auditing, and Formal Verification, among others.\n\nOur Research team comprises computer scientists, mathematicians and engineers who work on analyzing, breaking, and designing blockchain and cryptographic schemes. Our expertise and interests span the fields of [zero-knowledge](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/406) proofs, non-deterministic programming, [Distributed Validator Technology](https://medium.com/nethermind-eth/sorting-out-distributed-validator-technology-a6f8ca1bbce3), and [decentralized identity](https://nethermindeth.github.io/lido_phase_1/index.html).\n\nWorking to solve some of the most challenging problems in the blockchain space, we frequently collaborate with renowned companies and DAOs, such as Ethereum Foundation, StarkWare, Lido Finance, Gnosis Chain, Aave, Flashbots, xDai, Open Zeppelin, Forta Protocol, Energy Web, POA Network and many more. We actively contribute to Ethereum core research and development, EIPs, and network upgrades with the Ethereum Foundation and other client teams.\n\n## General work mindset\n\nThe following principles will drive the development of the protocols:\n\n- All the design considerations and risk analysis will be done with the consent of the Lido DAO.\n- All proposed solutions will come with security analysis. When available, the protocols’ security will be proven.\n- Milestones and deliverables will be small to ensure a good overview of the team’s progress.\n\n# Ideal mechanism overview\n\nAn ideal mechanism evaluates Lido’s DAO validator set according to the operator & validator set strategy described in [this note](https://hackmd.io/K6udDz1nSZOoX8t-vE98qg) by Lido. More precisely, the mechanism must have methods for improving the validator set if there is an option to do so. It must have zero input from permissioned roles (i.e., no admins/committees). Furthermore, it must have an input of low to zero impact from LDO, stETH, and ETH token holders.\n\n# General objectives\n\nWe will assist Lido in creating and maintaining a permissionless and high-quality validator set mechanism. This entails:\n\n1. Designing and implementing methods to ensure that validators are run by a high-quality set of operators. In particular, each operator performs its duties on its own and does not cede them to an external party (i.e., it does not hire a white-label operator), nor is secretly associated with other operators, and ensures that its hardware and software run performantly.\n2. Conducting a thorough economic analysis to understand how the market fluctuations, or changes in the Ethereum protocol itself, can compromise the system’s security.\n\nThe project will be divided into following phases:\n\n- **Phase 1:** We survey the literature and state-of-the-art approaches to identity and attestation schemes. This phase has been completed [already](https://nethermindeth.github.io/lido_phase_1/index.html).\n- **Phase 2:** During this phase, we will survey the literature and state-of-the-art approaches to white-labeling-protection. We will focus on arbiter protocols: oracles and prediction markets, to assess they usability in this problem. Then we will propose a mechanism that utilize an arbiter protocol to fight white-labeling. We will also investigate how to disincentivize using white labeling operators. The present proposal focuses solely on this phase.\n- **Phase 2.5:** We will make a proof-of-concept implementation for the white-labeling prevention mechanism designed in Phase 2.\n- **Phase 3:** During this phase we will work on the Sybil resistance. We will prepare a survey on the state-of-the-art approaches and propose a mechanism that significantly increases the cost of creating Sybils.\n- **Phase 3.5** We will make a proof-of-concept implementation for the Sybil prevention mechanism designed in Phase 3.\n- **Phase 4**: Next, we will proceed to design solutions for assuring a good quality set of operators and economic security of the protocol. We will also describe the resources required to implement the solutions proposed in Phases 1 to 4.\n- **Phase 5:** This phase is mainly concerned with implementing the solutions designed during the previous phases. We will also research some extra topics and problems, as done in the previous phases, and afterward, we will implement them. Further information on this phase will be provided later, by the end of Phase 3.\n\n# Project Objective\n\n## Phase 2. White-labeling resistance mechanism design\n\nIn this part of the project, we will focus on one of the crucial aspects of the security of a permissionless staking protocol. Namely ensuring that operators perform their duties independently and don’t use third parties, so-called white-label operators, to do them on their behalf. An entity that runs multiple operators (whether by controlling Sybils or being a white-label operator) could have too much control over stake, and the protocol in general. This would worsen the overall health of the protocol, weaken its resistance against correlated slashing, and could introduce a single point of failure.\n\nWe emphasize that even if we ensure that all onboarding operators are honest, we still need to have a system that detects dishonest parties within the set of already onboarded operators. This is because white-label operators can be created among the onboarded operators, even if these operators honestly entered the system. The latter may happen, e.g., when one entity that runs operators buys another that also runs operators. In that case, the buying party may end up controlling too much of the stake.\n\nOur work plan for developing the white-labeling resistance will begin by researching several techniques that, we believe, have the potential to lead to a solution in isolation or as part of an amalgam. The different types of methods we will explore are listed below. In particular, we will investigate arbiter protocols. The motivation for using arbiter protocols is following — a party that suspects that some operator is a white label could raise that issue and make a corresponding prediction market where people can bet on whether they believe in the claim. Then the conflict would be resolved by an assigned resolution mechanism.\n\nThe final goal of our work will be to produce a report explaining exactly how the Lido network can use such methods.\n\n### **TASK 1** **White-labeling resistance. SoK.**\n\nWe will begin with supplementing the SoK from Phase 1 with an SoK for white-labeling resistance. We will look for such mechanisms used not only in Web3 but also in Web2 and, if necessary, real life.\n\nThis part will take 3 weeks.\n\n### **TASK 2 Arbiter protocols. SoK.**\n\nWe expect some core components to be decentralized oracles, token-curated assets, and prediction markets (with the focus on the last one). We will use these \"arbiter protocols,” as we call them, to assess whether\n\n- a prospective operator will provide good quality services and contribute to the quality of the operators’ set or\n- an already onboarded operator uses a white-label operator.\n\nAs a first step, we will prepare an SoK for the following topics:\n\n- decentralized oracles\n- prediction markets\n\nThis part will take 3 weeks.\n\n### **TASK 3 Arbiter protocols. Resolution mechanisms.**\n\nIn this part, we will design a mechanism that resolves disputes in arbiter protocols. We will propose concrete setups for decentralized oracles and prediction markets. We will specify which parties make the oracle and who resolves disputes in prediction markets. We will analyze the feasibility of using already onboarded operators as part of an oracle system. Similarly, we will also explore the idea of using LDO holders as a resolution mechanism for prediction markets and oracles. To protect operators from being unjustly accused, we will design a mechanism that allows such operators to raise a flag and notify the DAO of the resolution mechanism’s wrongdoing.\n\nThis part will take 8 weeks.\n\n### TASK 4 Heuristics against Sybils and white-labels\n\nWe will analyze the possibility of using heuristic mechanisms to detect Sybils and white labels by analyzing their behavior and setups. We will analyze the available literature on the topic and determine operators and the parameters that should be observed. Finally, we will draft a mechanism that, in conjunction with the arbiter protocol, could be used to detect Sybilling or white-labeling operator.This part will take 4 weeks.\n\n### **TASK 5 Do you trust your white-label?**\n\nWe will investigate a mechanism that will require from parties using white-label operators to trust them with some funds. More precisely, in the mechanism the party joining Lido will need to put some collateral that can be transferred using validator’s key. Hence, the collateral could be efficiently stolen by the white-labeling party that keeps the key.\n\nThis part will take 2 weeks.\n\n### **On implementation**\n\nThis phase does not contain implementation. This is since at this stage of research it is impossible to tell what should be implemented, how, and how long would it take. We will propose a proof-of-concept implementation for one of the solutions designed in TASK 4 or 5. We will submit a separate proposal for the implementation effort as soon as possible.\n\nThis phase will be completed within 22 weeks from the date of the agreement.\n\nThis phase does not contain any implementation.\n\n# Organization, Funding, and Budget\n\nThe project will be funded by Lido DAO. The DAO will pay Nethermind 450 000 DAI, of which 200 000 DAI will be paid upfront and the remaining 250 000 DAI on delivery.\n\nAt the end of the project, the LEGO council will decide whether the provided systematization of knowledge meets the agreed requirements and, if that is the case, proceed with the payment. In the case of disagreement between the LEGO assessment on the quality of the deliverables and Nethermind, Lido operators will be used as a resolution mechanism.\n\nThe payment will be made to address eth:0x237DeE529A47750bEcdFa8A59a1D766e3e7B5F91",

      "title": "Request to authorise a 22M LDO ceiling for a four year contributor Token Reward Plan (TRP)",
      "content": "### Summary\n\nThis proposal incorporates updates to the [prior discussion](https://research.lido.fi/t/lidodao-token-rewards-plan-trp/3364). It requests approval for the authority to donate up to a maximum ceiling of 22M LDO to a grants association for use in a Token Reward Plan (TRP), a framework which will distribute voting LDO tokens spread over a period of up-to four years to DAO contributors. The proposal will enable a single universal arrangement for contributors to participate in DAO governance that is connected to their continuous contribution periods. It will also offboard the burden and risk of DAO commitments to the contributors to a single purpose grants association. The association will receive the donations over time and will make grants of LDO from the association into the hands of contributors according to the parameters of the TRP described below. Democratising governance participation by increasing the number of independent actors will enhance the resilience of the DAO’s treasury to resist governance attacks, improve routine quorum, and reward long-time contributors with LDO at the same time.\n\n\n### Abstract\n\nApprove the donation of up-to a maximum ceiling of 22M LDO to be transferred over a four year timeline to the grants association’s multisig. The signer’s of the multisig will be members of a not-for-profit grants association. The purpose of the association will be to own the multisig and to assure the integrity of a grants program described by the TRP. This will include the audit of the eligibility of the TRP participants, and of the distributions of governance tokens to long-time contributors according to the [formula](https://research.lido.fi/t/lidodao-token-rewards-plan-trp/3364#policy-features-4) set-out in the original forum post. Initially it will be done manually with the intention to automate by smart contract.\n\nIf this proposal is implemented the following will change:\n\n* the DAO will offboard the responsibility for current and future LDO commitments to contributors to the grants association;\n* many contributor LDO grants have been approved by DAO voting and require the implementation of a means to disburse and receive LDO, this situation will be remedied;\n* a single universal LDO distribution framework will be established which will bring certainty to all stakeholders and reduce and eventually eliminate the burden of honouring a diversity of bespoke LDO arrangements over time;\n* for a minority of contributors that have indicated a preference to respect their previous grant arrangement to its finality, the burden of honouring the arrangements can be assumed by the grants association, and when, and if, a prior arrangement is complete the contributor who remains can have an option to re-engage with TRP if they continue to contribute to the DAO;\n* there would be a net increase in the number of independent rational actors participating in DAO decision making.\n\n\n### Motivation\n\nSince genesis the DAO has made a variety of commitments to contributors to grant them governance participation under a variety of formulas at different points in time. For many contributors the commitments are in arrears. The arrears are in part because of the resource draw and burden to honour the multiple different arrangements on an bespoke basis and also the absence of a dedicated resource to deal with the obligations. One side of the issue is resolved by harmonising LDO commitments into a simple fair and universal framework. Another side is resolved by offboarding existing and future contributor obligations to an amenable third party. The benefits of honouring the commitments to existing LDO members are many. An LDO distribution plan enables the existing LDO holders decision making to be enhanced by the participation of contributors who built and continue to build the ecosystem, ensures enhanced resilience from coercion or attack on the Lido DAO or the Lido on Ethereum protocol, and maintains positive relationships with the contributors.\n\nAn activity like the TRP described is outside of the DAO's immediate core business. This activity attracts an entirely different risk universe than overseeing the development of liquid staking projects. At a global scale, local legal compliance is complex and more easily achieved by localising the activity within a legal wrapper. This path enhances trust between the DAO and the receiving association since the multisig signers are be ascertainable, it will provide a level of protection for the signers, it can respond and service the demands of the local compliance needs of individual contributors that the DAO cannot do, and it offboards the burdens of decision making, contributor obligations, grievances and other potential liabilities from the DAO. There is also a motivation for fairness. It would be unfair for a contributor to be penalised based on where they live or where they were born because the uncertain treatment of grants from a DAO will differ depending upon where it is received. The source and purpose of the grant is overcome by using an association.\n\nThis new proposal is consistent with the progressive decentralisation process towards a permissionless contributor-driven DAO discussed in the [recent budget proposal](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-1-november-1-2022-april-30-2023-lido-ongoing-funding-request/3133).\n\n\n### Specification\n\nThe association’s framework of the TRP was arrived at after surveying the existing contributor LDO arrangements with a view to harmonising them, and surveying similar programs at other DAOs.\n\nContributors with prior LDO grant arrangements were contacted and given a choice to either remain with their legacy arrangements, or to agree to terminate their old arrangement and elect to participate in the new framework of this proposal. Nearly all contributors agreed to elect to participate in the new framework.\n\n\n### The goals of the TRP are:\n\n* a simple single harmonised arrangement\n* to enhance decentralisation by enabling contributors to accumulate LDO to vote in DAO governance.\n* that grants are not measured by or dependent on hours worked, production or efficiency.\n* that participation is optional;\n\n**The TRP has the following elements:**\n\n**Term:** four years, beginning on November 1st, 2022 for existing contributors\n\n**Milestones:** all participants will have a one year milestone before the rewards unlock, thereafter they will unlock gradually\n\n**Participant:** is a contributor who is eligible to receive LDO under the framework and who has been assigned a contributor level.\n\n**Base Compensation:** Base Fees, in US dollars\n\n**Level-Multiplier:** Based on experience and skill\n\n**LDO Price:** Calculated as the trailing 180-day close price of LDO, using the following[ Dune query](https://dune.com/queries/1080098?symbol_t6c1ea=LDO) as the source of truth\n\n*Repricing Mechanism: Allows the contributor to manually trigger a reset of their TRP and milestone schedule, locking in a new LDO Price at the 180-day moving average, but forfeiting any accrued but not received LDO. For example, if a participant decided to reprice their TRP four months into the plan, they would lose all LDO accrued during those four months, and reset their milestone date to 12 months from the date the repricing mechanism was used.\n\nUpon being used, a new four year plan with a one year milestone is granted, and if a participant has multiple packages due to changes in roles or promotions as defined below - all are reset and consolidated into one new package. The maximum discount that participants can reprice at is 50% below the original TRP package price.\n\nThe initial participant list is composed of the current DAO contributors as of November 1st, 2022, who are either working for the DAO directly or assigned to a DAO project from a contractor with a statement of work or agreement or snapshot, whichever the case may be (please see [proposal to form RCC](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-form-resourcing-and-compensation-committee-rcc/1767), [Lido-1 budget request](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-1-november-1-2022-april-30-2023-lido-ongoing-funding-request/3133)).\n\nThe members of the above-mentioned not-for-profit grants association will form a commission which will be in power to qualify TRP to contributors, which it assesses to be most helpful in relation to Lido DAO, making them eligible for TRP. The commission will also be responsible to set each contributor a corresponding level in the TRP as described more fully in the section below.\n\n*Note - participants are only allowed to reprice their package once per four years\n\n### Contributor Levels & Skill-Multiplier %\n\n> **Lifeguard:** 800%, or 200% per year\n> **Orca:** 400%, or 100% per year\n> **Shark:** 300%, or 75% per year\n> **Dolphin:** 250%, or 62.5% per year\n> **Otter:** 125%, or 31.25% per year\n> **Swordfish:** 75%, or 18.75% per year\n\n### Policy Features\n\n* Participants had the option to opt into the new Rewards plan, at the 11/1/22 LDO Price of 1.5294 or continue with their existing plan. This option lasted for two weeks from December 6th to December 20th. As mentioned above, this election by contributors was complete and understood to be conditional upon the approval of the LDO donation.\n* Opting into the new plan enables participants to lock in the current LDO Price and retain their current milestone date\n  * Please examples [in the original post](https://research.lido.fi/t/request-to-authorise-a-22m-ldo-ceiling-for-a-four-year-contributor-token-reward-plan-trp/3833)\n  * Note - Participant opting into new plan will receive pro-rata to the day for LDO accrued (e.g. If a contributor has contributed for 7.4 months, they will be received LDO at a daily rate and their first year milestone date will be remain unchanged at 4.6 months in the future)\n* New packages will only be granted upon new contracts, hires, promotions, and base compensation increases of 30% or higher\n  * A promotion is defined as a change in contributor level, i.e. from Shark to Orca\n  * In the event of a promotion, if the amount of LDO is less than or equal to the amount under the previous arrangement, the participant will receive a +33% increase in LDO terms to compensate for the difference as a one-time change to the base level in terms of single promotion (the same 33% increase may occur during next promotion)\n  * If a participant is given a 30%+ raise but is not promoted, the undelivered portion of their TRP will recalculate at the original LDO price with no change to the milestone schedule\n* A contributor voluntarily or involuntarily leaving the DAO will cease to be a participant.\n* The TRP will continue until the budget is spent\n* New program start, changes in formula of TRP calculation or LDOs required above the 22M LDO ceiling - will require a renewed DAO approval;\n* Promotions will result in an incremental package granted to the participant for the difference between the existing package and new level package, at the LDO Price at time of promotion, capped at the annual amount of the new level package, with a floor that is at least equal to 33% of the promotion LDO TRP package\n\nAdditional detailed examples of calculations and applying the formulas of the framework are in the link to the Snapshot.\n\n### The Association\n\nThe association will be resident in Switzerland. The purpose of the association is to own the multisig, audit and ensure contributor grants are matched to participant eligibility and to own all aspects of the TRP. This will offload obligations to contributors and any grievances to a single purpose third party. The use of the association will enhance trust that the gifted LDO is being used for the purpose of the association and enhance fairness and strengthen confidence with participants. The entity will be able to supply appropriate documentation to contributors who may face local challenges, something the DAO cannot do. The decisions of the association with respect to the TRP will be final.\n\nThe association will:\n\n* Use a **4/7** [safe.global](https://safe.global) multi-signature wallet to execute the objects of the program;\n* Implement, where feasible, automation which should include the deployment of a smart contract for each participant\n* Make recommendations to the DAO, from time to time, regarding TRP\n* Rotate Members of the multisig to ensure the continuity of the association.\n* Own obligations, commitments, disputes and grievances with participants.\n* Use EasyTrack motions to request refill top ups within the budget.\n* Make bylaws and policies to give effect to the TRP.\n\nUnder this framework the DAO will approve a donation to the association and the association will exercise discretion the TRP.\n\nThis control to be executed via Aragon vote or equivalent governance instrument that might come to replace it in the future.\n\nMultisig wallet 0x834560F580764Bc2e0B16925F8bF229bb00cB759 with **4/7** following signers to be created:\n\n* kadmil: 0x4ce07bbcd6c8a6331e95d23b61cbedf0111db179\n* Alex_L: 0xF3d5Fdb50154B1b3047F311485780Baa1D770492\n* skozin: 0xD516fce5737388b126d550B5a5CAf53bcBF73895\n* adcv: 0x5157CeE5ee585A8331C936e838591FaeBf9123D4\n* irina: 0x8CeD94df9ddba8E38b6cb36639B6635F19Eb25C6\n* dgusakov: 0x806cAC2126F2a74ba04D712bA64Bd0792FE811d5\n* George: 0xAF0e81325a05a9F123907983F3F1a48864947127\n\n### The Budget\n\nThe estimated budget for this program +50% buffer for future changes (newcomers, possible changes in rewards level, etc.) is **22M LDO for the period from 1 November 2022 to 30 October 2026**. The TRP multisig to be refilled in batches to individual smart contracts of each TRP participant in the whole planned amount, until all participants opting into the rewards plan get their contracts. Amounts in smart contracts will be unlocked to participants gradually according to the program schedule. The multisig committee should also be available to send funds to individual participants wallets before smart contracts deployment, if rewards are due.\n\nPart of these tokens may be used for disbursement of amounts for November 2022 - February 2022 period via RCC, ATC and PML (in addition to Lido-1 budget proposal), until the TRP ms is wrapped into a legal entity and smart contracts are deployed.\n\nThis Snapshot approves this budget, TRP association creation and a transfer of LDO to its’ multisig. Next step is Aragon vote in case of success.",

      "content": "Following the successful launch of Lido on Polygon V1, we’ve been working hard incorporating stakeholder feedback to make marked improvements in reducing both staker as well as node operator friction. As a result, we’ve come up with a V2 of Lido on Polygon that makes fewer compromises, eases operator entry and exit, and provides a smoother flow for users and network participants. This version not only brings nice-to-have features for node operators participating in the Lido on Polygon protocol, but also reduces the gas needed for depositing and withdrawing staked tokens through the Lido on Polygon protocol.\n\nAs we are committed to the values put forward by the community and the DAO, this upgrade will enable us to onboard a new set of node operators and further decentralise the Polygon network while providing options for more top tier node operators to join the Lido family. \n\n## **TL;DR change log:**\n\n- Rebalancing stake among validators on deposits and withdrawals\n- Simplified logic for node operator registry\n- No need to transfer validator ownership to Lido’s smart contracts\n    - Polygon staking NFT (ownership) migration for existing V1 Node Operators\n- Finer role based access control\n- Gas optimizations for delegations/withdrawals and node operator controls\n- Code refactoring for readability and maintenance\n- Improved logging and events for analytics\n- Small fixes and code improvements\n\n## Security audit\n\nAll the contracts went through internal reviews by Lido core team and Shard Labs before they were sent for the professional audit by [Oxorio](https://oxor.io/) and [Peckshield](https://peckshield.com/).\n\nLink to the reports: [https://github.com/lidofinance/polygon-contracts/tree/main/audits/v2/](https://github.com/lidofinance/polygon-contracts/tree/main/audits/v2)\n\nAudited commit hash: `7845610e763fbbab2152b8c2873da795d94ea148`\n\n\n**If this proposal is supported, Lido on Polygon team will make the upgrade through manager-multisig.**",

Move the first threshold to 1% instead of 2.5%\n2. Update steps of market share\n3. Increase the number of incentives in the first steps\n4. Change vesting conditions\n\n### The proposed new incentive structure in detail:\n\n- 150,000 LDO tokens issued with no vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 1% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 150,000 LDO tokens issued with no vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 2% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 150,000 LDO tokens issued with no vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 3% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 150,000 LDO tokens issued with no vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 4% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with no vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 5% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting with 2-year vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 6% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting with 2-year vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 8% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting with 2-year vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 10% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting with 2-year vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 12% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting with 2-year vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 14% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting with 2-year vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 16% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting with 2-year vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 18% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting with 2-year vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 20% of the staked MATIC supply\n\nPayouts will be made via on-chain voting after the milestone is captured and retained for 30 days. The first 5 milestones are not vested, while others (from 6% onward) have linear vesting of 2 years with no cliff (cliff date equals start date).\n\nThe threshold of 1% was reached on July 18, 2022 and is still retained. You can see it in the “Lido MATIC staked - digest” block in [official Lido’s analytics digest](https://dune.com/sam_la/lido-weekly-digest-polygon). So if this proposal with the new incentive structure is supported, then an on-chain vote to pay out 150,000 LDO for reaching the 1% threshold will be started.",

      "title": "Lido on Ethereum Block Proposer Rewards Policy 2.0 and Relay Maintenance Committee",
      "content": "Following the [draft policy updates extensively discussed on the forums](https://research.lido.fi/t/discussion-draft-lido-on-ethereum-block-proposer-rewards-policy-2-0/3132/13), a proposed [v2.0 of the Block Proposer Rewards Policy](https://lido.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaLLjLE2iecf59kTQSVC1rHVPjjQwGDTCouR8A871BNRY) has been uploaded to IPFS.\n\n**If you think Lido DAO should update the existing policy and enact the updated version, vote For. If you are against this proposal, vote Against.**\n\n**Below is a summary of changes to the policy included in the v2.0 proposal:**\n\n- Set expectation of full-scale rollout of “PBS lite” via MEV Boost for all Node Operators going forward\n- Define responsibilities of Node Operators in the case of Relay misbehavior, failure, or otherwise unexpected or non-performant functionality (e.g. what happens if relays provide bad bids, bad blocks, don’t unblind timely, etc).\n- Define the responsibilities of Relay Operators towards the Lido Protocol and Node Operators\n\n**Additionally, by voting For, the below is also ratified:**\n\n- Propose to empower the [Relay Maintenance Committee](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-on-ethereum-identify-and-constitute-relay-maintenance-committee/3386) to facilitate the maintenance of the Lido vetted relay lists.\n    - The Relay Maintenance committee will be a 5/7 Gnosis Safe multisig and have the address [https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x98be4a407Bff0c125e25fBE9Eb1165504349c37d](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x98be4a407Bff0c125e25fBE9Eb1165504349c37d)\n    - The initial members of the multisig, as per the post linked above, will be:\n        - PhilKnows eth:0x0ef5c6Ab0C44b2b042606215530437809eFE54c8\n        - Elias\teth:0x4981A4775983e947b12d0982021BeA8697175f4A\n        - Michael Sproul eth:0x6B29132ea388a308578c1d3Be068D0e4fc9915a2\n        - Izzy eth:0x783EA934d543CD1ccfd920639A7539a0BD3895e2\n        - Sisyphos eth:0x8C5f9c67028fAaE0Db258D44507BdfBD7A9de223\n        - George eth:0x912e21CdA3D7012146da4Df33309d860a9eb0bEb\n        - YorickDowne eth:0xeCbb058Fc429941124a2b8d0984354c3132F536f\n    - The Relay Maintenance Committee will be made the `manager` of the MEV Boost Relay Allowed List smart contract ([0xF95f069F9AD107938F6ba802a3da87892298610E](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf95f069f9ad107938f6ba802a3da87892298610e)) (this will occur via an on-chain Aragon vote if this proposal passes)\n    \n\n**Below are excerpts of the sections of the policy with substantial changes.**\n\n---\n\n### **D.4.II Monitoring & Penalties Specification**\n\nLido should monitor, record, and assess non-compliance with this policy. Monitoring and follow-up actions should include at least the following:\n\n- Assessing whether the correct fee recipient has been configured by the [Node Operators](https://lido.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaLLjLE2iecf59kTQSVC1rHVPjjQwGDTCouR8A871BNRY#Node-Operator) for the validators that they operate\n- Assessing from which source proposed blocks by the validators have been received (and if that source is appropriate)\n- Assessing the general availability of the allowed sources for block bids around the time of each block being proposed\n- Assessing, in cases where blocks were not constructed via chosen MEV infrastructure, if this was due to a min-bid-like setting and whether the value of the min-bid used in these cases conforms to the expectations set by the Policy\n- Assessing, in cases where blocks were not constructed via chosen MEV infrastructure, whether the block proposed contained transactions not available in the public mempool\n- Recording, on a per-block basis, the most valuable known block bids offered via accepted MEV infrastructure (and block bid sources, e.g. relays), i.e. the reference block\n- Recording, on a per-block basis, the blocks actually produced by the validators and their total value, i.e. the actual block\n- Analyzing, on a per-block basis and historically, the difference between the reference block and the actual block for each Node Operator participating in Lido, having also properly taken into account the effect that min-bid usage would have on such a difference\n\nSome leeway should be given to Node Operators for potential network problems, faulty relays, min-bid usage, or buggy software outside their control. It should be enough for the Lido DAO to punish gross misbehavior when a Node Operator is deviating more than ALLOWED_VALUE_DEV% from the reference block, on a frequency basis more than ALLOWED_FREQ_DEV% of the time over a rolling time window DEV_WINDOW. These parameters can be reviewed and tweaked via governance, if needed.\n\n—\n\n### **D.5 Currently prescribed solution(s)**\n\nThis section will be reviewed by the DAO and updated on an at-least yearly basis and more often if needed. It details which block production solutions may be used by Node Operators at the current time.\n\nApplicability period: 2022/11/1 - 2023/6/30\n\n(Unless otherwise overriden by a superceding DAO vote)\n\nSummary: 2022/Q4 - 2023/Q2 MEV-Boost Full-scale Adoption - Phase 1\n\nLido should aid Ethereum in moving towards its stated goal, PBS.\n\nFollowing the Merge, Node Operators were requested to roll out and use MEV-Boost for validators that they operate as a part of the Lido protocol via a soft-rollout approach. They were asked to use as many of the relays which had signaled interest for inclusion as possible in order to test the efficacy and performance of the relays. Following the soft-rollout period and going forward, Node Operators are expected to adhere to the following:\n\n1. The DAO will hold a Snapshot vote to:\n    - determine which MEV-Boost relays will be added to the initial “must-include list” and “allow list” (“relay lists”)\n    - for ease of governance operations given the number of new relays being created and the need for haste in certain scenarios, identify and approve a set of multi-sig participants who will manage the relay lists (the “Relay Maintenance Committee (RMC)”) for the duration of Phase 1, or until the management of the relay lists can be moved to [Lido Easy Track](https://docs.lido.fi/guides/easy-track-guide)\n    - delegate authority to the RMC to make decisions about which relays are added to or moved between the “relay lists”, provided that RMC decisions are posted publicly on the Lido research forums prior to any on-chain actions being taken and giving the DAO and community a reasonable amount of time to consider. The DAO retains the right to a final decision and community members may post a Snapshot vote to change or counteract RMC decisions and/or reconstitute the RMC with different participants.\n2. Validators operated by Node Operators participating in the Lido protocol shall be configured to produce blocks via the MEV-Boost infrastructure (or equivalent, such as Vouch’s MEV-Service) as detailed in [Appendix A.1](https://lido.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaLLjLE2iecf59kTQSVC1rHVPjjQwGDTCouR8A871BNRY#Appendix-A1-MEV-Boost), by obtaining sealed blocks from the maximum possible number of relays from Lido’s “must-include list” (those used will be determined by each Node Operator based on their own risk and legal assessment) and an optional number of relays from the “allow list”. *NOTE: the use of “must” here is effectively “must use some”, not “must use all”. The purpose is to promote relay diversity (and thus builder diversity). Node Operators may elect to not use all the relays from the “must-include list”, but the entirety of that list is used as a basis for the formation of the reference block as described in [Monitoring & Penalties](https://lido.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaLLjLE2iecf59kTQSVC1rHVPjjQwGDTCouR8A871BNRY#D4-Monitoring-amp-Penalties).*\n3. In Phase 1, Node Operators may also opt-in to configure a min-bid value in MEV-Boost ranging from 0 (default) to a preliminary upper maximum to be determined based on community alignment and agreement and published on the Lido Research Forums ([min-bid discussion thread](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-node-operator-mev-boost-min-bid-guidance/3347)). The effects of usage of min-bid shall be incorporated into the allowable deviation parameters discussed in [Monitoring & Penalties](https://lido.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaLLjLE2iecf59kTQSVC1rHVPjjQwGDTCouR8A871BNRY#D4-Monitoring-amp-Penalties), such that only egregious and/or non-community aligned (including but not limited to values and usage that would be substantially detrimental to protocol APR) values of min-bid would result in a Node Operator being penalized. The effects of min-bid implementation will be analyzed and shared with the DAO during Phase 1 to determine and codify a more specific policy.\n4. If using MEV-boost infrastructure leads to any operational failures/difficulties (such as, but not limited to: failing to produce valid blocks, failing to produce blocks at all, received rewards being incorrect, or lack of availability of appropriate relays), the Node Operator shall refer to and act as per the guidelines in [A.1.IV Block Production & Relay Troubleshooting](https://lido.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaLLjLE2iecf59kTQSVC1rHVPjjQwGDTCouR8A871BNRY#A1IV-Block-Production-amp-Relay-Troubleshooting).\n5. Blocks produced by the validators will be monitored as per [Monitoring & Penalties](https://lido.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaLLjLE2iecf59kTQSVC1rHVPjjQwGDTCouR8A871BNRY#D4-Monitoring-amp-Penalties) section and the monitoring section of the relevant Appendices. If as at the time of the start of the applicability period the “MEV Monitoring & Penalty parameters” have not yet been defined, a grace period will be instituted until such a time that the parameters are defined and ratified by the DAO, at which point this policy will be updated.\n6. Node Operators acting in violation of the policy are subject to penalties as described in the [Monitoring & Penalties](https://lido.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaLLjLE2iecf59kTQSVC1rHVPjjQwGDTCouR8A871BNRY#D4-Monitoring-amp-Penalties) section.\n\nPrior to the end of the Phase 1 of the Full-Scale Adoption period, or as soon as possible thereafter, the DAO will review and update (via a vote) this policy, in order to:\n\n- re-confirm or amend the prescribed solution if deemed necessary and set the new applicability period for the next phase policy;\n- stipulate or amend the values for the MEV Monitoring & Penalty parameters; and\n- indicate any updates or refinements to be put in place regarding Monitoring Mechanisms.\n\n—\n\n### **A.1.IV Block Production & Relay Troubleshooting**\n\nIn the case that operational issues are noticed (e.g. blocks not produced as expected, blocks not being timely unblinded, blocks not being timely created and propagated, blocks being invalid are invalid, relays not providing agreed upon data or monitoring APIs, etc.) the Node Operator should temporarily disable the relevant relay(s) until such a time that:\n\n- (a) service is sufficiently and satisfactorily restored, or\n- (b) the DAO and Node Operators collectively decide that the relay(s) should no longer be used and removed from the relevant vetted lists, at which point a DAO vote should be made to do so.\n\nIn these cases, the Node Operator should also:\n\n- timely inform the rest of the Lido Node Operator community about the issues identified,\n- reach out to the Lido Node Operator Management contributors to notify them of the issues, and\n- reach out to the relay operator to understand the source of the issue and report back\n\nIf a Node Operator is found to be \"under-performing\" as per the mechanism described in D.4 Monitoring & Penalties but this is due to issues stemming from a bad relay or malicious builders interfering with block production, then the Operator will not considered out of compliance with the policy.\n\n### **A.1.V Relay & Relay Operator Responsibilities and Incident Management**\n\nGiven the trusted nature of relays in the MEV-Boost context, it behooves Relay Operators to ensure that they and the relays that they operate function effectively, performantly, and efficiently, and that any and all communications are made timely and professionally.\n\nRelay Operators should notify relevant Lido protocol participants (e.g. Node Operators, the Node Operator Management Workstream) as soon as possible upon identification of an issue with any of the relays that they operate. Notification may be performed through public ([Lido forum](https://research.lido.fi/), Lido discord, etc.) and/or private channels (e.g. group chats) available to them, so that Node Operators can proceed with appropriate changes to their MEV-Boost configurations.\n\nDuring an incident, Relay Operators should provide regular updates with regards to the status of the incident. Following the conclusion of the incident, Relay Operators should provide an incident report (or post-mortem) that details at minimum the root cause, fixes performed, if/how soon the relay will be back in service, and what steps have been undertaken to prevent the likelihood of similar incidents in the future. Additionally, in cases where block production was adversely affected (see A.1.IV Block Production & Relay Troubleshooting), Relay Operators should advise as to what steps will be taken (if any) to reimburse validators for any missed/lost/invalid/etc. blocks and/or incorrect/invalid/inaccurate bids.\n\nIncidents will be reviewed on an ad-hoc basis by the Node Operator and Lido DAO communities. These reviews will inform DAO decisions (via vote) regarding whether Relay Operators and the relays that they operate will continue to be considered vetted and ratified for use by Node Operators or not.\n\nRelays which exhibit poor or otherwise unacceptable communication and especially performance (such as, but not limited to, inability to performantly and timely register validators, inability to performantly and timely send/receive bids and payloads, not verify bids, not simulate payload validity etc.), and/or fail to conform with the expectations outlined above with regards to incident management (as determined by the DAO and Node Operator communities) will be subject to removal from the Lido-approved relay lists.",

      "title": " Referral Program for Ethereum - Final Reform",
      "content": "## Background\n\nThe bear market and recent market events has shown the importance of increasing the adoption of defi and more decentralized infrastructure. With increased centralized competition, speed of execution is of the utmost importance for the whole industry. To date, Lido DAO’s referral program has exceeded expectations. However, the current model is unsustainable. With protocol sustainability in mind, referral rewards need to be reduced to a manageable level.\n\nA longer-term revenue share model is outside the scope of this proposal.\n\nThe initial focus will be on Ethereum.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe are submitting the following proposal:\n\n1. Implement a new referral model for stETH structured as per referrer:\n    - 2.5 DAI per ETH referred up to $100m worth of ETH\n    - 3.5 DAI per ETH referred up to $250m worth of ETH\n    - 4.5 DAI per ETH referred up to $500m worth of ETH\n    - 5.0 DAI per ETH referred up to $1.0bn worth of ETH\n    - 5.5 DAI per ETH referred up to $5.0bn worth of ETH\n2. The new model starts at 0 and is cumulative during the term of the program for participants.\n3. Limit the initial reward pool to a maximum of 1,000,000 DAI.\nDepending on success and market dynamics, refreshing the pool in 1M DAI\nincrements will be voted on and discussed. Updates will be provided in\nthis thread.\n4. Begin winding down the program before withdrawal operations are enabled on Ethereum.\n    1. Optional transition to successor program after withdrawals are enabled\n\n### Operations\n\nOperations will be handled by the same [Referral Program committee & miltisig](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x61ea645fbaf36cdab088421e22abc99b32c3438919b2b6500170a6665f804cd3) through Aragon votes and Easy Track payment processing akin to the updated reWARDS setup with limits, paying in DAI.\n\nThe new model, if approved, would:\n\n- Supersede and formally replace the [current referral program on Ethereum](https://lido.fi/referral), effective immediately after the conclusion of a successful snapshot and vote. All\nreferrals in the legacy setup will be honored for final distribution.\nIncluding an update the terms and conditions of the program.\n    - Change payout timings. Payouts are to be calculated every calendar month with a twap of 30 days for ETH/DAI. This is to create stability in the pricing mechanism in case of volatility in the market. If there is detected manipulation of DAI pricing, USDT and USDC may be used as backup.\n- Implement an exit clause or emergency trigger. In the event of manipulation or overwhelming success, there will be certain limits placed on the payouts of the program in order to protect Lido DAO. This is a non-exhaustive list:\n    - Lido DAO will not suffocate itself financially in facing overwhelming success of the program\n    - No cycle staking. Old or new, just don’t do it.\n    - Manipulating the exchange rate of stETH or DAI.\n    - Yet to be identified attempts to game or manipulate the program which will be documented on the public site linked above.\n\nThis proposal, if approved, would not:\n\n- Define the programs for other Lido on other chains.\n- Change the current payout process.\n- Define or scope the successor program.\n\n## **Conditions**\n\n1. Only allowed referral addresses will be eligible for rewards.\n2. Users are given the ability to generate a unique referral URL that is specific to their Ethereum address.\n3. Rewards are calculated once per month using a 30 day TWAP of ETH/DAI.\n4. To be eligible for rewards in the current rewards calculation period, referral should drive at least 5 ETH in referee stakes during ‘the period’\n5. Referral rewards will paid out after review to spot any wrong doing or manipulation listed in terms and conditions.\n6. A referral receives payout based on the proposed model (final conditions will list this explicitly on the Lido DAO site).\n7. The Lido DAO referral program does not have any fixed time frame. The program ends when there are no more tokens in the reward pool (i.e., the total amount of DAI tokens that can be distributed to participants of the program) or when the DAO makes an active decision to cancel it.\n8. The Lido DAO can stop, pause, and resume the program at any time.\n9. The Lido DAO determines the size of the reward pool, amount and terms of the DAI reward, and can change them at any time.\n10. The Lido DAO can at any time change the operating conditions of the Lido DAO referral program.\n\n## Vote Outcomes\n YAY: Approve new program terms and initial fund of 1,000,000 DAI.\n NAY: Do not approve new program or funding.",

      "title": "Expansion of Lido on Ethereum Oracle set",
      "content": "Securing Oracle operations is important to ensure the robustness of one of the core mechanisms that underlie the Lido on Ethereum protocol. In the pursuit of decentralization and a sustainable protocol work, it is proposed to expand Lido on Ethereum Oracle set with third parties. \n\nThis a proposal to expand the set, increase quorum and also compensate oracle’s gas costs retrospectively and further gas costs on a regular basis.\n\n### Current state\n\nExisting Oracle set consists of 5 participants, all of them are Lido DAO approved Node Operators.\n\nQuorum is 3/5 now. This means that the report finalization with rebase only occurs when there are 3 identical reports from oracles.\n\n[https://mainnet.lido.fi/#/lido-dao/0x442af784a788a5bd6f42a01ebe9f287a871243fb/](https://mainnet.lido.fi/#/lido-dao/0x442af784a788a5bd6f42a01ebe9f287a871243fb/)\n\n## The oracle set expansion\n\n### Option 1: onboard 6 oracles and set quorum as 6/11\n\nThis a proposal to onboard following 6 new oracles to the Oracles set. All of them at the moment are not Lido DAO approved Node Operators, and this leads to the decentralization of the protocol, because the current oracle set, consisting of five node operators, will be supplemented by six third-party oracles:\n\n1. [Rated](https://www.rated.network/)\n2. [bloXroute](https://bloxroute.com/)\n3. [Instadapp](https://instadapp.io/)\n4. [Kyber Network](https://kyber.network/)\n5. [Matrixed.Link](https://matrixedlink.io/)\n6. [Spire Blockchain](https://www.spireblockchain.com/)\n\nThe quorum will be increased from 3/5 to 6/11.\n\n### Option 2: onboard 4 oracles and set quorum as 5/9\n\nThis vote also proposes an option that came up during the discussion on the forum: onboard only 4 instead of 6 oracles. In this case, those potential oracles that are node operators in other protocols will not get into the set. We will be happy to further cooperate with them as node operators.\n\nIn this case, the following set is offered for onboarding:\n\n1. [Rated](https://www.rated.network/)\n2. [bloXroute](https://bloxroute.com/)\n3. [Instadapp](https://instadapp.io/)\n4. [Kyber Network](https://kyber.network/)\n\nQuorum will be set as 5/9.\n\n## Gas cost compensation\n\nIt is proposed to compensate retrospectively gas costs for existing 5 oracles and further gas costs for the whole set. For this purpose will be used 2/3 multisig wallet `0x5181d5D56Af4f823b96FE05f062D7a09761a5a53`, which was created as a result of [the Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x712919976dc89777faecda7b346713664498fe572542f767e19cf9aa4f9fd7ae). Funds already owned by multisig will be used, no additional funding is required for oracle purposes.\n\nTotal amount of 25.91 ETH will be transferred from the multisig to the following addresses to compensate for costs already incurred:\n\n| Address | Amount, ETH |\n| --- | --- |\n| x007de4a5f7bc37e2f26c0cb2e8a95006ee9b89b5 | 7.244 |\n| x140bd8fbdc884f48da7cb1c09be8a2fadfea776e | 3.393 |\n| x1d0813bf088be3047d827d98524fbf779bc25f00 | 5.003 |\n| x404335bce530400a5814375e7ec1fb55faff3ea2 | 4.645 |\n| x946d3b081ed19173dc83cd974fc69e1e760b7d78 | 5.625 |\n\nFor further compensation, gas costs will be funded through the multisig `0x5181d5D56Af4f823b96FE05f062D7a09761a5a53`under already approved budget.\n\nGas cost analytics can be found on [the dashboard](https://dune.com/pipistrella/lido-oracle-gas-compensation).\n\n## Proposal Actions\n\nIf option 1 is supported than an on-chain vote intended to onboarding 6 oracles and setting quorum to 6/11 will be started.\n\nIf option 2 is supported than an on-chain vote intended to onboarding 4 oracles and setting quorum to 5/9 will be started.\n\nif option 1 or option 2 is supported multisig `0x5181d5D56Af4f823b96FE05f062D7a09761a5a53` will be used for oracle gas costs compensations:\n- total amount of 25.91 ETH will be transferred to the above mentioned addresses to compensate for costs already incurred.\n- subsequent oracle gas costs will be compensated from the multisig.",

      "title": "Improving the incentive structure for the Lido on Polygon team",
      "content": "We propose to increase by 500,000 LDO the number of incentives for the [Shard Labs](https://shardlabs.io) team who makes Lido on Polygon to **1,500,000 LDO total** to reflect that Polygon importance had risen relatively since the [first proposal](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-for-polygon-proposal-by-shard-labs/816) and that the deal was different from our baseline for other networks as well.\n\n### Hence, we advocate for the increase with the following changes:\n\n1. Move the first threshold to 1% instead of 2.5%\n2. Update steps of market share\n3. Increase the number of incentives in the first steps\n4. Change vesting conditions\n\n### The proposed new incentive structure in detail:\n\n- 150,000 LDO tokens issued with no vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 1% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 150,000 LDO tokens issued with no vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 2% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 150,000 LDO tokens issued with no vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 3% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 150,000 LDO tokens issued with no vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 4% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with no vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 5% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting with 2-year vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 6% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting with 2-year vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 8% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting with 2-year vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 10% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting with 2-year vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 12% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting with 2-year vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 14% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting with 2-year vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 16% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting with 2-year vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 18% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting with 2-year vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 20% of the staked MATIC supply\n\nPayouts will be made via on-chain voting after the milestone is captured and retained for 30 days. The first 5 milestones are not vested, while others (from 6% onward) have linear vesting of 2 years with no cliff (cliff date equals start date).\n\nThe threshold of 1% was reached on July 18, 2022 and is still retained. You can see it in the “Lido MATIC staked - digest” block in [official Lido’s analytics digest](https://dune.com/sam_la/lido-weekly-digest-polygon). So if this proposal with the new incentive structure is supported, then an on-chain vote to pay out 150,000 LDO for reaching the 1% threshold will be started.",

      "content": "# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks approval from Lido DAO members to upgrade the smart contract to v2 in order to ensure a healthy validator economy and create a sustainable, high-performance validator set for Solana.\n\nIf this snapshot vote passes, the proposed smart-contract changes will be deployed to the mainnet. \n\n# Suggested changes in smart-contract\n\nWhile the ideas that lie behind these changes were well described in [research forum proposal](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-on-solana-protocol-upgrade-proposal/2959), we want to list again the key changes: \n\n- The transition from fully dedicated nodes with 100% fee to public ones with a variable fee;\n- Increase the maximum number of validators to 6,700;\n\nWe also would like to set the variable fee for the validators in the set. Ideas behind that are described on the [research forum](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-on-solana-maximum-validator-commission-proposal/2979). \n\n- Set the maximum commission for the validator to 5% to be eligible to receive a delegation from Lido on Solana.\n\n# Changes in the rewards distribution model\n\nAs an expected result of the changes above, the staking rewards distribution model will slightly change. \n\n- In the current version of the smart contract, all the rewards are distributed simultaneously and precisely between node operators (5%), the DAO treasury (4%), the developer (1%), and the stakers (90%).\n- After the suggested changes are made, the 5% (max, could be less than that) goes to the node operator, then from the remaining part subtracts the DAO treasury (4%) and the developer (1%) fees. And then, the remaining part goes to stakers.\n\nAs a result, the part of the treasury and the developer slightly decreased, the validator’s part remains the same as before, and the “staker’s” part slightly increased. \n\n# Security audit\n\nWe conducted an external security audit of the new version of the smart contract. It was made by [Neodyme](https://neodyme.io/), a well-known industry security researcher. [Here](https://reports.neodyme.io/reports/lido_v2_report/) you can find the resulting report for this audit. \n\nThere were a few findings that have already been resolved on our side.",

We are preparing the grounds for a final funding proposal as a followup to [this post](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-dao-core-contributors-provisional-budget/2556) that will run the DAO as a whole starting on November 1, 2022. We will publish more details over the coming days.\n\nLido will be moving to a continuous funding model starting on November 1, 2022, which has created a 1 month gap for operations financed out of RCC. The following request will bridge the gap for operating expenses for the month of October (many expenses are due at the end of the month). A total of 50k LDO will be requested to cover September overdue LDO compensation and October LDO compensation. \n\nThis budget, on a monthly basis, is substantially larger than previous RCC asks for a few key reasons:\n1. Deployment of marketing expenses in a busy month\n2. Transfer of Audits and Bug Bounties from LEGO to RCC\n3. Deployment of GCP and Github Funding\n4.

      "content": "## Overview\nOver the course of the day on 09/27 the BloXroute ethical relay was receiving and returning bad blocks to validators from one of our block builders running an experimental build strategy that resulted in missed slots.\n\nThis builder was improperly committing transactions and caused improperly formatted blocks. Because the relay was not simulating blocks from known builders these blocks were getting sent to validators causing them to miss slots due to proposing blocks with improper receipts or log blooms. A total of 15 slots were missed due to this issue.\n\nBloXroute’s relay was not simulating blocks from internal builders and was instead relying on these builders to submit valid blocks.\n\nThis was resolved:\n\n* The experimental builder was taken offline and ensured that it was no longer submitting blocks to any of our relays.\n* All of the validators who missed slot’s were paid for the bids they received from the bloXroute relay.\n* On 09/30 all of the relays now simulate all block submissions regardless of source.\nWhile transferring funds to bloXroute’s builder to pay for the missed slots the builder considered the transfer of 11 ETH as an MEV tip for the validator and paid that 11 ETH to the Lido Execution Layer Rewards Vault on slots [4791729](https://beaconcha.in/slot/4791729) and [4792026](https://beaconcha.in/slot/4792026).\n\nProposal\nThis proposal is to return back 11 ETH that were sent to the Lido Execution Layer Rewards Vault.\n\nIf the proposal is supported, then an on-chain vote will be launched to send 11 ETH from the Lido DAO Treasury to the address 0xea48ba2edefae9e4ddd43ea565aa8b9aa22baf08.",

In order to meet this demand efficiently, we will switch to requesting 40% of the budget in LDO and 60% in DAI from the DAO. This is a compromise to decrease selling pressure on LDO from grantees who have working capital needs in fiat currencies, but keeps the possibility for contributors to partake in developing the overall ecosystem.\n•\tWe propose to fix LEGO budget at $500k level - historical average spending for 9 previous months. At the beginning of each quarter 40% LDO part of the budget will be calculated using 30d TWAP at the day of Easy Track movement creation, the rest refilled with DAI from the treasury.\n•\tIndividual allowances to be recalculated each quarter: USD equivalent using 30d TWAP is calculated for 15k and 10k LDO (council and nominees respectively), if the wallet of LEGO member has higher or equal balance than calculated allowance - it doesn’t get a refill.\nCurrent estimated refill amount and individual allowances for Q4 are following (to be updated on the day of refill if the voting passes):\n\n![bafkreigk2re7vwgxngdzrgxlxwoadbfnyqy2cupunsodp4d43utxsoi5pq.png](ipfs://bafkreigk2re7vwgxngdzrgxlxwoadbfnyqy2cupunsodp4d43utxsoi5pq)\n \nThis Snapshot passing means that DAO approves above mentioned changes to the structure of LEGO budget and Q4 22 refill can be made accordingly.

      "title": "A proposal for partnering with Nethermind to design a mechanism for a good validator set maintenance",
      "content": "# TL;DR\n\nThis proposal is to fund Nethermind to deliver a Systematization of Knowledge for Decentralized Identities and Verifiable Credentials. During the project, a dedicated team will investigate what the state-of-the-art is and what solutions are used/planned to be used in practice, and how. The project is one of the steps toward allowing Lido to onboard new operators in a permissionless manner. The project will take 6 weeks, and its cost — 150 000 DAI — will be covered by Lido DAO.\n\n# Ideal mechanism overview\n\nAn ideal mechanism evaluates Lido’s DAO validator set according to the operator & validator set strategy described in [this note](https://hackmd.io/K6udDz1nSZOoX8t-vE98qg) by Lido. The mechanism has methods for improving the validator set if there is an option to do so. It has zero input from permissioned roles (i.e., there are no admins/committees). And it has an input of low to zero impact from LDO, stETH, and ETH token holders.\n\nThe mechanism has to be capital efficient: Collateral for operators can be used, but it can’t be the single or primary mechanism; it has to function mainly by staking with other people’s money.\n\nThe mechanism has to account for the bull-bear cycle effect in a way that would allow operators to stop validating if that becomes too expensive for them and for the protocol to contract the number of operators in bear markets and expand in bull markets.\n\nThe mechanism has to prevent the set of operators from becoming worse. This includes but is not limited to avoiding the following:\n\n- reduced performance,\n- offline time,\n- slashable offenses,\n- reduced geodiversity,\n- reduced Ethereum client diversity and other diversity vectors,\n- giving up independence (e.g., in a merger),\n- destructive MEV\n- delegation of operation has to reduce the amount of stake that an operator can get, potentially down to removing it from the set altogether.\n\nImproving operational quality should increase an operator’s revenue (by increasing the stake or the commission).\n\nThe stake should be distributed flat-ish. No operator should control more than 1% of total ETH staked (globally).\n\nThe mechanism can’t overfit on any one parameter, but most importantly, it can’t overfit on performance: super-performant operators often cut corners or sacrifice certain attributes for others. There has to be a “good enough” level of performance.\n\nThe mechanism should allow for a new operator to enter the set of operators with essentially no collateral or reputation and work its way to an optimal position within the network of operators. That should be possible, although it may take a long time, if the operator has a “good enough” performance and is ecosystem aligned, independent, and runs its own hardware in non-concentrated geographical/jurisdictional areas. There might be a need for an insurance pool or collateral to enter at zero or to rise to the top, but it shouldn’t be an important requirement in the middle.\n\n# Objectives\n\nWe offer to help Lido with maintaining a *high-quality validator set*. This entails:\n\n1. Designing and implementing methods for assuring that validators are run by a high-quality set of operators. In particular, each operator performs its duties on its own and does not cede them to an external party (i.e. the operator does not hire a white-label node), is a proficient DevOps engineer, and ensures that its hardware and software run performantly.\n2. Conducting economic analysis to understand how market changes, or changes in the Ethereum protocol itself, can impede the system’s security and how to secure the system against unfavorable market changes.\n\nThe project will be divided into four phases:\n\n- **Phase 1:** We survey the literature and state-of-the-art approaches to identity and attestation schemes. See the Roadmap for Phase 1 below for specific details. The proposal focuses solely on this phase.\n- **Phase 2:** During this phase, we will survey the literature and state-of-the-art approaches to oracles, token-curated assets, and prediction markets.\n- **Phase 3**: Next, we will proceed to design solutions for assuring a good quality set of operators and economic security of the protocol. We will also describe the resources required to implement the solutions proposed in Phases 1, 2, and 3.\n- **Phase 4:** This phase is mainly concerned with implementing the solutions designed during Phases 1, 2, and 3. Additionally, we will research some extra topics and problems, as done in the previous phases, and afterward, we will implement them. Further information on this phase will be provided later, by the end of Phase 3.\n\n# About Nethermind\n\nNethermind is a team of world-class builders & researchers. Our work touches many parts of the industry, from our Nethermind node to [fundamental cryptography research](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/406) and [application-layer protocol development](https://github.com/aave-starknet-project).\n\n# Motivation\n\n## Permissionless operator set\n\nOur research will first focus on ensuring a high-quality set of operators for the Lido network. A light-heartedly created set of operators could put users’ stakes at risk or even threaten the security of the Ethereum network. Hence the method for permissionless and secure operators’ evaluation, addition, and removal is crucial.\n\nAlthough the whole set of operators should be of high quality, we need to allow newcomers to join the network as well. Newcomers may not have records good enough to be considered of high quality, but they should be able to work their way up to a high-quality status.\n\nAnother problem to study is how and when to arrange the operators into committees. Since the network allows newcomers that may be of a lower quality, it is essential from the network’s performance and security perspectives to ensure that high-quality operators have the required majority of voting power in all validators.\n\nSince on-chain data may not be enough to assure a high-quality set of operators, it is important to design a mechanism that pulls off-chain data on-chain. Here we differentiate two sources of data: issuer data and community data. The former is taken from official institutions, trusted issuers, etc. The latter is taken from distributed communities. It is crucial for the data to be obtainable and verifiable. The quality of data determines the quality of the reputation and quality systems.\n\n## Economic analysis\n\nAnother crucial part of assuring a good set of validators is to create a robust incentive mechanism that assures that rational actor behave honestly and in a manner that helps shape the operator set according to our design goals (e.g. having operators be as diverse as possible), being this the behavior with the greatest payoff. To that end, an in-depth analysis of liquid staking economics incentivization methods is required.\n\nWe also note that an incentive mechanism is needed to obtain good quality data — both to have data pulled on-chain and to have it verified.\n\nWe also propose to analyze how users’ and operators’ incentives change if the proposer-builder separation is included in Ethereum.\n\n# General work mindset\n\nThe following principles will drive the development of the protocols:\n\n- All the design considerations and risk analysis will be done with the consent of the Lido DAO.\n- Nethermind will set up a dedicated team for this effort.\n- All proposed solutions will come with security analysis. When available, the protocols’ security will be proven.\n- Milestones and deliverables will be small to assure a good overview of the progress the team makes.\n\n# Project Objective\n\n## Phase 1. Decentralized identity and verifiable credentials. Systematization of knowledge.\n\n- We will start by investigating classical results in Decentralized Identity Schemes and Verifiable Credentials.\n- Then we will discuss the recent advancements in these two areas\n- Finally, we will investigate what solutions are used in practice (or planner to be used), how projects use them, what are the security assumptions and properties, what are the known roadblocks.\n\nThe deliverable will be a systematization of knowledge research survey.\n\nThe deliverable will be completed within 6 weeks from the date of the agreement.\n\n# Organization, Funding, and Budget\n\nNethermind will create a dedicated team to run this project.\n\nThe project will be funded by Lido DAO. The DAO will pay Nethermind 150 000 DAI on delivery.\n\nAt the end of the project, the LEGO council will decide whether the provided systematization of knowledge meets the agreed requirements and, if that is the case, proceed with the payment.\n\nThe payment will be made to address eth:0x237DeE529A47750bEcdFa8A59a1D766e3e7B5F91",

      "title": "Proposal to return back 11 ETH that were sent by BloXroute's builder to Lido Execution Layer Rewards Vault",
      "content": "## **Overview**\n\nOver the course of the day on 09/27 the BloXroute ethical relay was receiving and returning bad blocks to validators from one of our block builders running an experimental build strategy that resulted in missed slots.\n\nThis builder was improperly committing transactions and caused improperly formatted blocks. Because the relay was not simulating blocks from known builders these blocks were getting sent to validators causing them to miss slots due to proposing blocks with improper receipts or log blooms. A total of 15 slots were missed due to this issue.\n\nBloXroute’s relay was not simulating blocks from internal builders and was instead relying on these builders to submit valid blocks.\n\nThis was resolved:\n\n- The experimental builder was taken offline and ensured that it was no longer submitting blocks to any of our relays.\n- All of the validators who missed slot’s were paid for the bids they received from the bloXroute relay.\n- On 09/30 all of the relays now simulate all block submissions regardless of source.\n\nWhile transferring funds to bloXroute’s builder to pay for the missed slots the builder considered the transfer of 11 ETH as an MEV tip for the validator and paid that 11 ETH to the Lido Execution Layer Rewards Vault on slots [4791729](https://beaconcha.in/slot/4791729) and [4792026](https://beaconcha.in/slot/4792026).\n\n## Proposal\n\nThis proposal is to return back 11 ETH that were sent to the Lido Execution Layer Rewards Vault.\n\nIf the proposal is supported, then an on-chain vote will be launched to send 11 ETH from the Lido DAO Treasury to the address 0xea48ba2edefae9e4ddd43ea565aa8b9aa22baf08.",

      "content": "* Optimization of LDO in LEGO budget: Reviewing historical data, we noticed 60% of grantees requested to be paid in stablecoins. In order to meet this demand efficiently, we will switch to requesting 40% of the budget in LDO and 60% in DAI from the DAO. This is a compromise to decrease selling pressure on LDO from grantees who have working capital needs in fiat currencies, but keeps the possibility for contributors to partake in developing the overall ecosystem.\n* We propose to fix LEGO budget at $500k level - historical average spending for 9 previous months. At the beginning of each quarter 40% LDO part of the budget will be calculated using 30d TWAP at the day of Easy Track movement creation, the rest refilled with DAI from the treasury.\n* Individual allowances to be recalculated each quarter: USD equivalent using 30d TWAP is calculated for 15k and 10k LDO (council and nominees respectively), if the wallet of LEGO member has higher or equal balance than calculated allowance - it doesn’t get a refill.\n\nCurrent estimated refill amount and individual allowances for Q4 are following (to be updated on the day of refill if the voting passes):\n \n![2022-10-06 13.48.38.jpg](ipfs://bafkreigk2re7vwgxngdzrgxlxwoadbfnyqy2cupunsodp4d43utxsoi5pq)\n    \nThis Snapshot passing means that DAO approves above mentioned changes to the structure of LEGO budget and Q4 22 refill can be made accordingly.

The LNOSG decided to propose these operators given their experience with proof of stake validation, capability to set up a Solana testnet validator, and assessed ability to contribute to the diversity of the Lido on Solana and overall Solana operator set.\nIn the event that either operator does not stand up and operate a performant validator within the next three months, another vote will follow to replace the operator with the waitlisted candidate Cryptomanufaktur (assuming their continued intention to join the set). \nThis vote will run for seven days and seeks LDO holder approval of the onboarding of the above-mentioned node operators for the respective protocol, provided the operators confirm their desire to join.\nFor more information, please see the relevant onboarding announcement and evaluation results posted on our forums, here: https://research.lido.fi/t/announcement-lido-on-solana-wave-3-onboarding/2715",

      "title": "Lido on Ethereum Block Proposer Rewards Policy v1.0",
      "content": "Following the draft policy posted [on the forums](https://research.lido.fi/t/discussion-draft-for-lido-on-ethereum-block-proposer-rewards-policy/2817), a proposed [v 1.0 of the Block Proposer Rewards Policy](https://lido.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQx7gt1e4Wnhpgk2YqngRQNedYbZHM2YsSJ9htiCJwAp6) has been uploaded to IPFS. \n\nIf you think Lido should enact this policy and Node Operators running validators for the Lido protocol should begin a soft rollout of out-of-protocol Proposer Builder Separation as described in linked policy, vote For. If you are against this proposal, vote Against.\n\nBelow are excerpts of certain sections from the linked policy for summary purposes.\n\n---\n\n### A. Overview\nAs a DAO and a protocol, Lido on Ethereum should have a transparent, enforceable, and monitorable policy with regards to how its constituent Node Operators are expected to behave with regards to rewards that accrue from the activity of producing blocks for validators that they run as a part of Lido, namely priority fees and MEV extraction, and how the protocol will distribute the rewards that accrue to the protocol as a result of these activities.\n\n### B. Purpose\nThis policy aims to outline how Node Operators participating in Lido should distribute rewards obtained due to block production (including potential MEV rewards), what mechanisms or infrastructure may be used in execution of this, how rewards will be distributed, and how these activities will be monitored.\n\n### C. Scope\nThis policy applies to the Lido on Ethereum protocol, the Node Operators that participate in the protocol, and the validators that they operate as a part of the protocol.\n\n### D. Policy Statement\n#### D.1 General goals\nThere are two key questions that this policy addresses:\n- How should validators run by Node Operators propose blocks? and\n- How should validators run by Node Operators distribute the rewards that result from block proposals?\n\nSince the consensus within the Ethereum community is to move towards a PBS system where the building of blocks is separated from the proposal of blocks, Lido should seek to adopt an approach as close to a most likely draft of PBS as possible. Lido could become a testbed for this feature which is easier to roll back than a full-fledged implementation if something goes wrong.\n\nOn the rewards side, validators are powered by deposits from stakers, and thus stakers should always receive the lion’s share of rewards.\n\nTo that end, Lido as a protocol should:\n\n- Enforce - to the technical extent possible - that blocks are not built by Node Operators, but instead built by third parties and obtained from open and transparent builder markets.\n- Require that Node Operators ensure that relevant rewards are routed to the Lido Execution Layer Rewards vault which, as per [LIP-12](https://research.lido.fi/t/lip-12-on-chain-part-of-the-rewards-distribution-after-the-merge/1625), will periodically be triggered to stake the rewards (less the Lido protocol fees), thereby essentially increasing staker rewards.\n- Ensure, to the extent possible, that proposed blocks are valid and do not damage the proper and sustainable operation of the underlying protocol.\n- Monitor Node Operator behavior (monitoring will be publicly available) and penalize Node Operators who are found to not be in accordance with the above stated goals.\n\n\n#### D.5 Currently prescribed solution(s)\nThis section will be reviewed by the DAO and updated on an at-least yearly basis and more often if needed. It details which block production solutions may be used by Node Operators at the current time.\n\n>Applicability period: Merge date - 2022/10/31\n>(Unless otherwise overriden by a more recent DAO vote)\n\n>Summary: Post-Merge soft-rollout of MEV-Boost\n\nLido should aid Ethereum in moving towards its stated goal, PBS.\n\nFrom any time following the Merge (slated to occur between 10-20th of September), Node Operators have roughly six weeks (until the end of October 2022) to test and implement MEV-Boost such that blocks produced are sourced from DAO-vetted relays (see [LIP-17](https://research.lido.fi/t/lip-17-mev-boost-relays-whitelist-for-lido/2885) for details about where the vetted relay information will be stored and how they may be retrieved by Node Operators). This period constitutes a soft-rollout so that Node Operators may properly test and configure their infrastructure prior to the policy being fully in effect.\n\nThe below summarizes the prescribed solution to work towards within the soft-rollout period:\n\n- Validators operated by Node Operators participating in the Lido protocol should produce blocks via the MEV-Boost infrastructure as detailed in Appendix A.1, by obtaining sealed blocks from the maximum possible number of relays (to be determined by each Node Operator based on their own risk and legal assessment) from Lido’s “must-include list” and an optional number of relays from the “allow list”.\n- If using MEV-boost infrastructure leads to any operational failures/difficulties (e.g. failing to produce valid blocks, blocks at all, received rewards being incorrect, or lack of availability of appropriate relays), the Node Operator may fall back to building blocks via the “Default” block-building method.\n- Blocks produced by the validators will be monitored as per Monitoring & Penalties section and the monitoring section of the relevant Appendices.\n- Node Operators acting in violation of the policy are subject to penalties as described in the Monitoring & Penalties section.\n\nPrior to the end of the soft-rollout period, the DAO will review and update (via a vote) this policy, in order to:\n- re-confirm or amend the prescribed solution if deemed necessary and set the - new applicability period for the policy;\n- stipulate the values for the MEV Monitoring & Penalty parameters; and\n- indicate the finalized Monitoring Mechanisms.\n\n\n",

      "title": "Vote to engage a Head of Legal & General Counsel for Lido",
      "content": "This is a vote to onboard a DAO-vetted Head of Legal & General Counsel for the Lido DAO based on the two following proposals:\n\n[Candidate Proposal for Head of Legal & General Counsel Role](https://research.lido.fi/t/candidate-proposal-for-head-of-legal-and-general-counsel/2723).\n[Role Overview - Head of Legal & General Counsel Proposal](https://research.lido.fi/t/head-of-legal-and-general-counsel-proposal/2713).\n\nThe value in this role is time, cost, speed, and risk avoidance. What was the legal landscape before is not now. The scope of Lido projects has broadened. The timing and criticality of the evolving legal landscape needs to be managed to avoid legal pitfalls and to establish sound operational strategies going forward. It will help make or break Lido’s long-term success by helping to see around corners from business and legal perspectives.\n\nHaving our own in-house contributor in this role will source all the best resources in the fastest time frame. No learning curve in finding the resources because the lawyer is embedded in operations, and a reduction in the cost of outside counsel. Under the compensation scheme this person will have vested interest in our success.\n\nThus, an in-house legal role is needed for Lido. Rotorless is a highly qualified candidate who we believe would excel in this role.\n\n### Compensation\nThe proposed compensation for Head of Legal and General Counsel has two components:\n1. Cash compensation of $20,833.33 per month, payable in DAI from the Lido DAO or a structure operating within it.\n2. Token options payable in LDO from the Lido DAO or a structure operating within it, to vest over three years. The option calculation is, as follows:\n\n(Annual wage*k)/(120d LDO TWAP), where:\n* “k” - set at 2.5\n* 120-day LDO TWAP is $1.61 at time of this proposal being republished\n\n1/3 LDO will be vested on the 12-month anniversary of continuous service to the Lido DAO; and 1/36 LDO will be vested upon completion of each subsequent month of continuous service to the Lido DAO.\nThe service-based vesting outlined above represents a contingency for each of the described periods; thus, if the individual quits or is terminated before completing the first 12 months of service, they would have earned no LDO. If they quit or terminated during month 13, they would have earned 1/3rd of the total possible LDO but would not have earned the rest of their potential LDO grant. There are no further lockups on fully vested LDO (i.e., once they vest in some # of LDO, they can sell that # of LDO at any time).\n\n### Probation Period\n\nThe probation period is 3 month starting from the date of proposal acceptance.",

What was the legal landscape before is not now. The scope of Lido projects has broadened. The timing and criticality of the evolving legal landscape needs to be managed to avoid legal pitfalls and to establish sound operational strategies going forward. It will help make or break Lido’s long-term success by helping to see around corners from business and legal perspectives.\n\nHaving our own in-house contributor in this role will source all the best resources in the fastest time frame. No learning curve in finding the resources because the lawyer is embedded in operations, and a reduction in the cost of outside counsel. Under the compensation scheme this person will have vested interest in our success.\n\nThus, an in-house legal role is needed for Lido. Rotorless is a highly qualified candidate who we believe would excel in this role.\n\n",

The total Yearly budget has been recalibrated to a normalized $5,350,800.59; encompassing an additional Legal workstream, adjustments to OpEx, and adjustments to Marketing Expenditure.\n### Context\nThe Resourcing and Compensation Committee (RCC) was formed in March 2022 after a successful vote for the RCC was completed by the Lido DAO via [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x008ce8f95382c70216820a39d717c6b494348aa474917b6351819af527bc2a54). The next period of funding for the RCC, Q3 2022, begins July 1st (being applied retroactively).\nFor the first quarter of its operation (Q2 2022), contributors working directly under the Lido DAO have been doing so via the Resourcing and Compensation Committee (RCC), formed via a Snapshot vote and then funded via a Snapshot and Aragon vote with the Lido DAO for one quarter. The RCC achieved what it was created for, and helped team leads for these departments execute on and progress towards their OKRs.\nFor a detailed breakdown of accounting considerations taken into preparing the year’s budget as well as a breakdown of the operational procedure for committee members, please see the first RCC budget proposal and Q2 2022 funding request passed via snapshot [here](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xfc6601914ffde67c2d865372e62ae16518ca9ebb323c9d7a6128c53321a00ff4). \n",

DragonFly will commit to a final LDO price that is the higher of the following:\n    - Previously defined TWAP price + 50% premium (~$1.45 per LDO)\n    - 7-day backward looking TWAP taken at the time of vote completion (on chain voting) + 5% premium\n2. DragonFly will have the ability to withdrawal from the commitment if LDO price exceeds $2.25 during the vote timeline.\n3. There will be a 1 year lock up until tokens are liquid. \n\nIf the proposal is supported, then Aragon vote will be started.\nIf there is any confusion please specify in the forum post.\nIf there are objections about this going to an on-chain vote, please specify why in the forum post.",

Ensuring the protocol smart contracts have been audited by professionals with diverse perspectives allows to notice wide range of potential issues and safely fix them.\n\nLido dev team has contacted [ChainSecurity](https://chainsecurity.com/) audit firm and got the slot for the [merge-ready protocol version](https://research.lido.fi/t/announcement-merge-ready-protocol-service-pack/2184). The audit scope covers the whole Lido protocol with the recent features and tweaks.\n\n[ChainSecurity](https://chainsecurity.com/) is the established audit firm with wide experience with DeFi protocols in the Ethereum ecosystem. Among other projects, the team has been working with [Compound](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/compound-ctoken/), [Maker](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/maker-protocol-liquidations-2-0/) & [Kyber](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/kyber-network-dynamic-market-maker-dmm/) previously.\n\nThe quote for the scope is CHF 126,920 ($127,604 at the time of writing). We propose to use LEGO for funding the audit, but the grant of that size requires DAO approval.",

Two-phased voting](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/two-phase-voting/LIPS/lip-16.md)\n\nThe changes are implemented with the following PR in the Lido fork of aragon-apps repository: https://github.com/lidofinance/aragon-apps/pull/8\n\nThe on-chain code is peer-reviewed internally and audited by the MixBytes team.\n\n__Do you support the proposed 'Two-phase voting' to be implemented as Lido DAO Aragon Voting upgrade?__",

Because of that, if Lido decides to launch a protocol on the new Terra, it should also make a decision on how to handle it.\n\nIt also should be mentioned that the proposal is tied to the possible reputational and legal risks (see full proposal and discussion for details).\n\nThe proposed options, based on the forum discussion, are:\n1. No relaunch of Lido on Terra.\n2. Relaunch Lido on Terra as described in the proposal. The token allocation is going to be distributed among UST holders.

At the same time, there are multiple protocol safety net improvements to be implemented along with this change, increasing the protocol resiliency & stability. Those are highly desired as the Lido has come past the 4m ETH staked threshold.\n\nBelow we list all the changes of the “Merge-ready protocol service pack”:\n\n#### Major features\n- [LIP-12: On-chain mechanism for rewards distribution after the Merge](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-12.md)\n- [LIP-6: In-protocol coverage application mechanism](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-6.md)\n- [LIP-14: Protocol safeguards. Staking rate limiting](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-14.md)\n\n#### Minor features\n- [LIP-7: Composite oracle beacon report receiver](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-7.md)\n- [LIP-8: Increase keysOpIndex in assignNextSigningKeys](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-8.md)\n- [LIP-9: Add an explicit log for the stETH burn events](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-9.md)\n- [LIP-10: Proxy initializations and LidoOracle upgrade](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-10.md)\n- [LIP-11: Add a transfer shares function for stETH](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-11.md)\n- [LIP-15: Protocol safeguards. Resume role](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-improvement-proposals/blob/develop/LIPS/lip-15.md)\n\nThe changes are implemented with the following PR in the official Lido DAO repository: https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/pull/401.\n\nThe on-chain code is peer-reviewed internally and audited by the MixBytes team.\n\n#### Do you support the proposed 'Merge-ready protocol service pack' to upgrade the Lido protocol on Ethereum?",

Due to the increased amount of stakes, 67 of 130 ETHs have been spent already. If the deposit rate stays the same, remaining funds may cover deposits for three more weeks.\n\n## Proposal\n\nFund & refund deposit operations with 235.8 ETH in stETH to [funding multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5181d5D56Af4f823b96FE05f062D7a09761a5a53).\n\n### Deposit funding (200 ETH)\n\nFund the deposit operations with 200 ETH. Presumably that would cover deposits for the 3 more months (though the actual rate depends on the gas prices & deposit rate). The funding is requested in stETH to the [funding multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5181d5D56Af4f823b96FE05f062D7a09761a5a53).\n\n### Refund for dev team (35.8 ETH)\n\nDuring the time between [snapshot passing](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x13bb40e199529c3bc725b8a12f3a946555fc0684bb48a16e3b38c0a6568d8b02) & the actual funding secured with [Aragon vote](https://mainnet.lido.fi/#/lido-dao/0x2e59a20f205bb85a89c53f1936454680651e618e/vote/123/) dev team has [spent 35.8 more ETH](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-refund-money-spent-on-deposits-on-ethereum-to-the-dev-team/1882/4). We propose to refund these expenses sending the funds in stETHs to the [funding multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5181d5D56Af4f823b96FE05f062D7a09761a5a53).\n\n## Links & details\n\n* Previous round of funding: [post on research forum](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-depositor-bot-in-ethereum/1881), [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x712919976dc89777faecda7b346713664498fe572542f767e19cf9aa4f9fd7ae).\n* Previous round of refunding: [post on research forum](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-refund-money-spent-on-deposits-on-ethereum-to-the-dev-team/1882), [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x13bb40e199529c3bc725b8a12f3a946555fc0684bb48a16e3b38c0a6568d8b02).\n* The bot performs a securing role. [Deposit Security Committee details](https://docs.lido.fi/guides/deposit-security-manual/#the-deposit-security-committee).\n* Deposit is a gas-intensive operation, so it should be done balancing gas expenses and the time ether exists in the protocol buffer. [Technical details](https://hackmd.io/@F4ever/HySF5cJz5).\n* Depositor bot source code: [lidofinance/depositor-bot](https://github.com/lidofinance/depositor-bot).",

Ltd.\n* Girnaar Nodes\n* HashQuark\n* Kytzu.com\n* Matrix Staking\n\nThis vote will run for seven days and seeks LDO holder approval of the onboarding of the abovementioned node operators for the respective protocol, provided the operators confirm their desire to join.\n\nOur goal with onboarding new node operators is to improve the decentralization and resilience of the Lido protocol, as well as bringing on new organizations with strong skill sets and alignment with Lido’s values to help grow liquid staking on the networks the Lido protocol supports.\n\nFor more information, please see the relevant onboarding announcement and evaluation results posted on our forums, here: https://research.lido.fi/t/announcement-onboarding-for-polygon-wave-1/1751/4",

      "content": "Abstract\nThis is a proposal for a grant which will direct funding to the Protocol Guild (https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), a vested split contract composed of Ethereum core protocol contributors.\nThis snapshot vote to commit to transfer 2,000,000 LDO from Lido treasury to the Protocol Guild vesting contract, which should be deployed in the next few weeks.\nProposal rationale: https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1-proposal-rationale.html\n\nWhat is the Protocol Guild?\nThe Protocol Guild aims to address the challenges mentioned above with an autonomous value routing mechanism: a weighted split contract that includes vesting (0xSplits 8). Members will solicit sponsorships in the form of tokens from applications & protocols that build on Ethereum, which gives core contributors the possibility of upside exposure:\n   - current contributors are rewarded for past work through time-based weighting\n   - current contributors contribute for longer periods, resulting in less contributor churn\n   - new contributors are incentivized to join core protocol work\nTo date, the membership includes over 100 Ethereum core protocol contributors, including researchers, client maintainers, upgrade coordinators, and more, all self-curated (member list here 8). This is a broad-based ecosystem effort, not managed by the EF. Members come from 21 different teams and 9 organizations; only 30% of members are directly employed by the EF.\n\nThe Guild will act as an autonomous value routing mechanism, operated independently from any existing institution, purpose-built for incentivizing long-term core protocol work.\n\n\nMotivations for Lido to support the Protocol Guild\nLido directly builds a product on Ethereum’s base layer and would benefit from funding its development further\nLido should be among the protocols maximally aligned with the ecosystem it operates in\n",

      "title": "Lido on Terra wave 3 validators onboarding",
      "content": "Throughout March 2022, the Lido Node Operator Sub-governance Group (LNOSG) evaluated 65 onboarding applications for inclusion into the Lido on Terra Node Operator set. As a result of community feedback and the evaluations conducted on the 28th of March, the LNOSG is presenting two possible sets of validators for the DAO’s consideration, and a third choice of “none of the above” in which case the entire onboarding process would be started over.\n\nIn short, Shortlist A is the product of the original LNSOG evaluation, and Shortlist B is the result of an added emphasis to ecosystem-participation and alignment as a result of strong Terra community and DAO member feedback.\n\n## Shortlist A: 21 shortlisted applicants, original LNOSG evaluation result.\n\nRatings were submitted by LNOSG evaluators, averaged per applicant, and large variances or outliers were specifically discussed during the evaluation call. The criteria we examined include:\n\n- General validating experience both cross-chain and on the specific chain in question.\n- Overall historic performance and recent performance on the specific chain.\n- Level of detail and effort put into application so that the LNOSG may be able to assess various questions/factors around infra setup, security, reliability, overall anti-fragility of the validator, decentralization, and geographic distribution.\n- Ecosystem participation & alignment.\n\n| Shortlist A |\n|---|\n| 0Base |\n| Allnodes Inc |\n| AUDIT.one (Persistence Staking Pte. Ltd) |\n| Blockdaemon |\n| BlockNgine |\n| BridgeTower Capital |\n| BTC.Secure |\n| Chainlayer |\n| Coinhall |\n| Cosmic Validator |\n| Delight Labs |\n| MissionControl |\n| moonshot |\n| Orbital Command |\n| PFC |\n| RBF Staking |\n| RockX |\n| SkillZ |\n| Solva Blockchain Solutions (CryptoCrew Validators) |\n| Stakely |\n| Terran one |\n\nNB: Two validators were removed from the shortlist following downtime that brought their performance below the baseline criteria. SkillZ will only be added to the validators registry and delegated to if they join the active set.\n\n## Shortlist B: 21 shortlisted applicants, 2 waitlisted applicants, composite score.\n\nShortlist B was offered as a possible alternative to Shortlist A following Terra community and DAO feedback expressing the desire for an onboarding wave of more ecosystem-aligned applicants.\n\nFor the purpose of this shortlist, a scoring methodology was adopted to “boost” the weighting of ecosystem participation criteria in the overall applicant score. This “Ecosystem Alignment Score” focused on governance participation rates, seniority, public services (open-source development, public LCD/RPC hosting...), content creation and community building.\n\nThe LNOSG Scores and the Ecosystem Alignment Scores were given equal weightings and averaged to produce a more community-representative shortlist that still takes performance and setup into consideration.\n\n| Shortlist B |\n|---|\n| 0Base |\n| Allnodes Inc |\n| AUDIT.one (Persistence Staking Pte. Ltd) |\n| BlockNgine |\n| BTC.Secure |\n| Chainlayer |\n| Coinhall |\n| Delight Labs |\n| Fresh luna |\n| Kytzu |\n| larry stakehouse 🥩 |\n| MissionControl |\n| moonshot |\n| Orbital Command |\n| PFC |\n| RockX |\n| Setten |\n| Solva Blockchain Solutions (CryptoCrew Validators) |\n| Stakely |\n| SynergyNodes |\n| Terran one |\n| Stakebin (waitlisted) |\n| MANTRA DAO (waitlisted) |\n\nNB: shortlisting is contingent on an affirmative response from the identified applicant that they wish to continue with onboarding. If the validator doesn't approve its participation it will be replaced with the waitlisted one.\n\nMore information about the onboarding application windows and evaluations performed can be found here: [https://research.lido.fi/t/announcement-onboarding-for-terra-wave-3/1677/4](https://research.lido.fi/t/announcement-onboarding-for-terra-wave-3/1677/4).\n\nThis vote will run for **5 days** and seeks LDO holder approval of the onboarding of the aforementioned node operators for the respective protocols.\n\nOur goal with onboarding new node operators is to improve the decentralization and resilience of Lido on Terra, as well as bringing on new organizations with strong skill sets and alignment with Lido’s values to help grow liquid staking on the Terra network.",

      "content": "The Resourcing and Compensation Committee (RCC) was formed during the month of March after a successful vote for the RCC was completed by the [Lido DAO via Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x008ce8f95382c70216820a39d717c6b494348aa474917b6351819af527bc2a54). The RCC shall operationally consist of a multi-signature wallet with signers, thresholds, and future plans for the wallet outlined in the successful RCC budget proposal document found [here](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-form-resourcing-and-compensation-committee-rcc/1767).\n\nThe RCC shall exist to offer the DAO’s three official department heads for Business Development, Node Operator Management, and Marketing [to start] relief of blockers that have slowed down and in some ways prohibited them from executing upon their Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for 2022. These departments shall make requests to multisignature signers and overseers to the RCC (which will expand and grow in due course).\n\nThe yearly budget request for the RCC is $5,368,568.84, comprised of both USD OpEx/compensation/marketing expense as well as LDO token grants. This equates to a $447,380.74 monthly expense to support the teams. A more detailed budget breakdown is found on the full proposal [here](https://research.lido.fi/t/rcc-1-apr-1-2022-june-30-2022-budget-request/1980).\n\nThis budget secures a team of 15 full-time employees as well as covers all operational costs listed below.\n\nAt the end of the calendar year, any budget not spent would either be rolled forward into the next budget period, or returned to the DAO treasury if no further budgets are approved. Should the RCC shut down, all unused funds will be returned to the DAO immediately.\n\nThe RCC will need $1,057,755.00 to fulfill its need within this 3-month budget period. Of this, $22,500 will be used to cover gas costs related to multisig signature transactions and currency swaps. We propose that the Lido DAO withdraws the equivalent of $1,057,755.00 in stETH held in the Lido DAO treasury to the RCC multisig wallet, and that the RCC multisig wallet sells this stETH for DAI to secure the RCC’s 3-month budget. For the remaining $22,500 required for gas reimbursements, the RCC shall instead swap this equivalent amount in stETH to ETH and store the ETH as-is as a gas reimbursement reserve.\n\nWe are asking the Lido DAO to transfer the equivalent of $1,057,755.00 (+5% premium to account for potential price fluctuation from the start of Aragon voting to the end) in stETH from the Lido DAO treasury to the RCC Multisig wallet address. The exact amount of stETH shall be determined when the Aragon vote is initiated.\n\nRCC Multisig Details:\n* Address- 0xDE06d17Db9295Fa8c4082D4f73Ff81592A3aC437\n* Designated Contact: TG - @jbeezy1\n* Quorum - 3/5 to start, transition to a 4/7 threshold that will be completed by the RCC.\n\nProposed initial signers: \n* Jbeezy from Lido, Business Development Lead\naddress: 0x039bDD285d3eDb1D9B6001d3097067Aa2AF7d826\n* Izzy from Lido, Master of Validators\naddress: 0x783EA934d543CD1ccfd920639A7539a0BD3895e2\n* Kadmil from Lido, Technical manager for the DAO\naddress: 0x9A3f38AF97b791C85c043D46a64f56f87E0283D4\n* Aurelius from Lido, Operational Manager Candidate\naddress: 0x7A29c1197962D1b42FcfA8095fA1dF66E489fCd6\n* AD from Lido, Marketing Lead\naddress: 0x0d22e69ce47818c3524Fe952e8De7AF78cC3C43b\n\nFull proposal and address confirmation signatures: https://research.lido.fi/t/rcc-1-apr-1-2022-june-30-2022-budget-request/1980\n",

Key details:\n\nIntroducing a one-off 650k LDO payment with 2-year vesting for work and value delivered by Chorus One (including upcoming Anchor integration).\n\nUpdating milestone-based incentives to more reasonable market share milestones (in total upon reaching 15% market share, P2P would have received 1.75m LDO and Chorus One 350k LDO (for supporting/staying aligned during the transition)).\n\nTransitioning Lido developer revenue share percentage to P2P upon completion (and intermediary share between Chorus One and P2P).\n\nFull proposal text and discussion linked below.",

This requires a strategic approach to Marketing, Comms and community building. It also requires the definition of accurate metrics and measurement to ensure budgets are spent efficiently and we go after the right priorities.\n\nThus, a Marketing leadership role is needed for Lido.

Team leads or department heads for example would still be subject to the proposal-based hiring process governed by the DAO.\n\nSummary\n\nCreate a governance committee dedicated to managing, executing, tracking, and reporting on hiring and contributor-related operating expenses for full time DAO members.\n\nAllow the committee autonomy to deploy a bi-yearly allocated resourcing budget as they see fit with quarterly reporting on the decision-making process and allowing for community feedback. Budgets will be proposed on an annual basis and may be revised during the year. Funding for each “budget period” (6 months) will be disbursed from the Lido treasury to the RCC wallet twice a year, via DAO vote.\n\nEventually, once Lido’s departments grow large enough it will be necessary for each department to take on this work independently, but for now, there are both efficiencies and privacy-related motivations to conduct all of this work through one committee.\n\nBudgeting details will be in a separate proposal to not distract from the operational considerations of the RCC.",

      "content": "The development and acceptance process of Lido-on-X protocol (Lido on Solana, Polygon, Kusama/Polkadot) involves a pre-release security assessment. These assessments are expensive and are needed not only for the team building Lido-on-X, but for the Lido DAO as a method of acceptance test (so we could say that indeed, that version of the protocol is safe to deploy, use, promote and incentivize).\n\nIt’s never boiled down to the point of contention, but the teams are extremely cognizant of the upfront costs of assessments (before they even know if their solution will have a PMF), and are de-incentivized to go for the best quality, more expensive firms. We should not put development teams in a situation where they have a conflict of interests on getting the best security practices.\n\nMy proposal here is for Lido at large, acting through LEGO, to bear all the costs of final security assessments of the Lido-on-X protocols, limited to two assessments with reputable firms per upgrade. With LEGO council in charge of judging what is a reputable firm.\n\nI also propose to retroactively fund the security assessments for Mixbytes(), Shard Labs, and Chorus One.\n\nThe costs of doing this are quite substantial (audits costs for a full protocol are anywhere between $30k to $200k, might be even more), but I gather them to be less than bug bounty costs, which are topped at $2M per bug currently.",

      "title": "Lido for Avalanche – Joint Proposal by Hyperelliptic Labs and RockX",
      "content": "Hyperelliptic Labs and RockX  propose an expansion of the family of Lido liquid staking protocols into Avalanche. \n\n\n## High-Level Technical Overview\n\nAvalanche’s multi-chain architecture presents interesting challenges to any team wishing to bring Lido to the platform. It is made up of three distinct blockchains: the Exchange Chain (X-Chain), the Platform Chain (P-Chain), and the Contract Chain (C-Chain).\n\n### Limitations of Current Avalanche Technology\n\nSmart contracts are executed on the C-Chain, however staking is performed on the P-Chain, which cannot run custom smart contract code.\n\nBecause Avalanche does not yet enable smart contracts to transfer AVAX between chains or to perform staking on the P-Chain, it is not currently possible for a smart contract to move tokens between these chains, meaning that some amount of the process must be custodial to begin with.\n\nWe propose a two-stage roadmap, combining the best of what is possible today, with a path to improvements in automation and trust minimisation as Avalanche grows. Both stages assume the creation of an Avalanche C-Chain token (stAVAX), representing staked versions of AVAX. At all stages, code will be open sourced and shared with the community.\n\n### Interim Solution: Semi-Custodial Liquid Staking\n\nAs with Lido stETH, tokens will accrue rewards as a function of time, removing the need for users to sacrifice liquidity or meet minimum staking value requirements to be able to participate in Avalanche’s growing DeFi ecosystem. Additionally, governance over selected validators, fees, other parameters, and matters such as upgrades to the protocol will be carried out by LDO holders.\n\nIn the initial version, the subset of operations which cannot yet be managed by smart contracts (such as cross-chain transfers and staking) will be carried out via operations requiring multi-party approval. These approaches will then be phased out as the Avalanche blockchain matures.\n\n### Long-Term Solution: Trustless Liquid Staking\n\nThe next update to Avalanche (Blueberry) intends to improve cross-chain transfer functionality, with work commencing in Q4 2021. We intend to work closely with Ava Labs to build on this and help add functionality to enable automated cross-chain staking with minimized trust.\n\nThis will require a number of improvements to Avalanche to better support cross chain messaging and querying, interchain accounts, remote transfers, and ultimately staking from contracts on the C-Chain.\n\n## Timeline estimates\n\nPreliminary work:\n\n* Research and development (October-January 2021)\n* Initial tech spec (January 2021-February 2022)\n\nPhase 1: semi-custodial liquid staking\n\n* Development: includes custom MPC solution (January-May 2022)\n* Fuji testnet deployment and audit (April-May 2022)\n* Mainnet deployment (June 2022)\n\nPhase 2: trustless liquid staking\n\n* Avalanche protocol development\n* Trustless staking development\n* Fuji testnet deployment and audit\n* Mainnet deployment\n\nMigration:\n\n* Migration of v1 users / custodied funds to v2; maintenance, upgrades and support for v2 and planning for further iterations\n\n\n## Compensation\n\nWe believe in the long term success and value proposition of Lido, and are therefore eager to propose a two-part incentive structure that shows our commitment both to this project and to the alignment of our respective interests.\n\nThis proposal contains a significant amount of development work, including an interim MPC solution, which contributes to the Lido codebase as a general purpose secure custodial solution, as well as protocol-level development to enhance the cross chain communication on Avalanche.\n\nIn this particular implementation for Avalanche, we will tackle the full complexity of the threshold ECDSA, which is more difficult than other setups such as BLS. We foresee a lot of learning and development from this proposal can be applied to other blockchains in the future since these are common challenges for a secure liquid staking solution.\n\nFirst, we would propose incentives of LDO tokens with the following terms:\n\n* The initial grant is issued immediately. Subsequent grants are issued when Lido for Avalanche captures % market share, based on the table below.\n* A grant given on the basis of delivering Phase 2 of the proposal, which represents a significant amount of potentially uncompensated work on the Avalanche protocol in tandem with the Ava Labs team.\n\nWe strongly believe this latter phase will benefit Lido, due to the optics of giving back to the Avalanche developer community and improving the protocol (i.e. supporting trustless inter-chain movements) for all teams working in Avalanche DeFi.\n\n|Milestone|LDO|\n| --- | --- |\n|Initial grant, covering delivery of Phase 1|350,000|\n|1% market share|200,000|\n|2%|200,000|\n|3%|200,000|\n|4%|200,000|\n|5%|200,000|\n|10%|500,000|\n|Delivery of Phase 2|150,000|\n|**Total**|**2,000,000 LDO**|\n\nWe define “market share” as the ratio between the amount of staked AVAX tokens via Lido vs. that of all staked AVAX tokens (currently around 60% of supply), based on Avalanche’s [Validator Stats](https://www.avax.network/validators) page. To qualify, the given market share must be held on average across at least 30 days, to account for variability in the data.\n\nIn addition, we propose that audit during the initial grant phase be compensated separately by Lido, and that the Hyperelliptic Labs x RockX team receive 20% of the ongoing Lido treasury fees from this solution, in order to align both parties’ incentives.\n\nAn ongoing revenue share plays many roles, including rewarding the team for the success of the project, and in order to cover the costs of ongoing maintenance, improvements, and integrations, both of the solution itself, and of a secure MPC key management system.\n\n## Project Team\n\nThe project will be jointly carried out by the Hyperelliptic and RockX teams, both of whom will bring their respective strengths to bear on this project.\n\nRockX is an institutional staking service provider, which has been a node operator of stETH and stSOL under Lido. Besides offering institutional staking services and stable access nodes. The team has a research arm X-matrix labs, which specializes in improving defi protocols and developing MPC key management (including DKG, resharing and signing)\n\nThe Hyperelliptic Labs team specializes in infrastructure, security and cryptographic key management. The team comes from both crypto and tradfi backgrounds, having built products used by millions of people around the world.\n\nWe are in close contact with both core Avalanche and Lido development teams, and look forward to collaborating with them to deliver this solution.",

This means Compound listing will require wstETH liquidity on Univ3 to be deep enough to provide good price data.\nWhile waiting for proper Univ3 wstETH<>WETH pair strategy to be developed, the Lido DAO can allocate enough liquidity for this pair from the protocol treasury directly to Univ3. The liquidity is to be deposited to an interval that captures about a 20% drop in price and a potential 5% price rise (max drop in peg stETH had over the years was 5%). This would allow getting enough liquidity in the UniV3 pool for the Compound to use the pool's price data in the wstETH listing.",

      "content": "The second quarter of LEGO has come to an end and it’s time to vote on the continuation of the program.\n\nBy continuing with LEGO through Q1 2022, we aim to continue the growth of LEGO and fund developments that benefit Lido, the liquid staking industry, and the greater ecosystem surrounding this.\n\nFor the coming 3 months, we propose the following changes to how LEGO is structured to enhance the intensity and efficiency of the program:\n\n* Transfer of management of LEGO budgets to EasyTrack, setting a yearly budget as opposed to a quarterly budget to improve the efficiency of LEGO allocations.\n\n* Top up LEGO multisig to 240,000 LDO by sending 130,039.88 LDO from the treasury.\n\n* Keep the current LEGO council as an entity that gets to decide on boulders and helps prepare mountain-sized grants.\n\n* The change of sums for grants to be 333 for sandgrain, 3,333 & 33,333 rai. The justification for this is that we currently have lower thresholds, and it makes operations harder. We want to utilize the grant program more, and this change would help the committee with reaching this goal.\n\nThe LEGO program is growing and has helped expand the utility of Lido across the space. Amongst other things, we look forward to seeing the launch of liquid staking on Polygon, Polkadot + Kusama and other things which bring direct value to Lido.\n\nFull proposal [here](https://research.lido.fi/t/lego-a-proposal-to-continue-lego-for-q1-2022/1568).",

      "content": "### Summary\nIn order to support the research and design efforts around identifying the desired path forward with regards to MEV (“Maximal Extractable Value”) in the post-Merge Ethereum landscape, Lido should join the “Flashbots Eth2 Working Group” (“the WG”). While joining the WG does signal an intent to participate in the Flashbots ecosystem post-Merge, this is a non-binding commitment and this vote is solely to determine whether the DAO agrees to join the WG or not. \n\nFurther governance discussions and votes will follow, which will serve to clearly indicate the DAO’s chosen strategy with regards to MEV extraction (e.g. “Does Lido agree to participate in the extraction of MEV?”, “Are Lido Node Operators all in alignment?”) and which mechanism(s) will be utilized for extraction and reward distribution.\n\n\n### Details\nThe purpose of joining the WG is to help Lido explore and answer a series of questions with regards to how Lido will approach MEV generally in the future. Specifically, Lido’s involvement in the WG would be focused on mechanisms surrounding how MEV-bearing blocks will be created, communicated, and proposed, as well as how fees and rewards will be distributed across the relevant stakeholders.\n\nAs the Merge approaches, it behooves Lido to understand the technical and operational activities that would be required for the DAO and relevant node operators to undertake in order to participate in such a mechanism, whether these activities can be managed and implemented in an open and transparent manner, and ensuring that the execution of these activities does not in any way compromise the security and effectiveness of protocol and node operator operations. \n\nCurrently the proposed implementation by Flashbots (MEV-Boost) seems to be the one most closely aligned with the ethos of the greater Ethereum community as evidenced by the parties which have joined the WG, such as leading node operators, staking pools, etc., as well as the Ethereum client teams’ willingness to support changes in specs that MEV-boost would require to function properly. \n\nLido’s participation in the WG will ensure that Lido has a voice in the design, testing, and possibly implementation of Flashbots, and it is important that this participation happens\n\n\n### For further context and information:\n\n* Forums proposal for joining the WG: https://research.lido.fi/t/join-the-flashbots-eth2-working-group/1451\n\n* Flashbots medium post on WG announcement: https://medium.com/flashbots/announcing-the-flashbots-eth2-working-group-599b2b92634b\n\n* Ethresearch post on MEV-boost: https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-boost-merge-ready-flashbots-architecture/11177/ \n",

The next step would be granting the contracts with proper roles to make the feature operational.\nIf passed, two items will be added into the Omnibus voting next week (December 2nd):\n- grant role 'CREATE_PAYMENTS_ROLE' to EVMScriptExecutor contract to allow Easy Track to handle fund allocations;\n- grant role 'SET_NODE_OPERATOR_LIMIT_ROLE' to EVMScriptExecutor contract to allow Easy Track to handle node operators' staking limits.\n\n",

Referral applicants with an established track record and reputation will not have referral rewards capped.\n\n-Referrers that have their rewards capped can request to remove the limited payout restriction if they show a good track record of bringing ETH into Lido while not breaking the rules.\n\n\nTo see details on the proposal visit: https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-update-the-referral-programs-terms-of-service-to-be-more-inclusive-to-smaller-stakers-influencers-and-educators/1381",

An additional 20% in LDO is allocated to the Rabbithole team to cover development expenses which will see a one-year lockup and see Rabbithole become an active governance member of the Lido DAO. \n\n**As such the total amount of LDO proposed comes out to 30,000 LDO.**\n\nIf passed, tokens will be transferred to Rabbithole as part of the weekly omnibus vote. If approved, the technical configuration is estimated to take 3-4 weeks after which the quest goes live.",

Thus, a Master of Validators role is needed for Lido.\n\nAn overview of Isidoros Passadis \nand his qualifications is available [here](https://research.lido.fi/t/candidate-proposal-isidoros-passadis-for-master-of-validators-core-contributor-role/1311).\n\nAn overview of the role and its scope is available [here](https://research.lido.fi/t/define-core-contributor-role-for-lido-master-of-validators/1310).\n\nAdditional resources: \n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/IsdrsP)\n* [Github](isidorosp)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ipassadis)\n",

[Ameen Soleimani](https://twitter.com/ameensol) from SpankChain (https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-treasury-diversification-part-3/1059/31).\n2. [Danny Ryan](https://twitter.com/dannyryan), Core Researcher in Ethereum Foundation (\"Ethereum Researcher #1\", https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-treasury-diversification-part-3/1059/28).\n3. [Hart Lambur](https://twitter.com/hal2001), UMA Co-Founder (\"A founder of a fast-growing DeFi project\", https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-treasury-diversification-part-3/1059/33).\n\nThe proposal is to grant the angels the opportunity to participate in the round, fulfilling Lido's part of agreement made with strategic investors.\n\nThe total amount of the purchase is 462962.9629629634 LDO, and the vesting terms are to be set the same 1-year lock + 1-year vesting, 1-month timeframe for making the purchase. The discussion could be found on [Lido forum](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-treasury-diversification-part-3/1059).\n\nThe proposed options are:\n\n1. Allow the purchase of the 462962.9629629634 LDO by the same price as in the round (100.0000000000001 ETH for the 462962.9629629634 LDO).\n2. Allow the purchase of the 462962.9629629634 LDO by the price of 30-day TWAP with 30% discount.\n3. Allow the purchase of the 462962.9629629634 LDO, price & terms to be discussed (please, share your thoughts on forum upon voting for this one).\n4. Don't allow the purchase.",

The discussion could be found on [Lido forum](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-treasury-diversification-part-3/1059).\n\nThe proposed options are:\n1. Allow the purchase of the 462962.9629629634 LDO by the same price as in the round (100.0000000000001 ETH for the 462962.9629629634 LDO).\n2. Allow the purchase of the 462962.9629629634 LDO by the price of 30-day TWAP with 30% discount.\n3. Allow the purchase of the 462962.9629629634 LDO, price & terms to be discussed.\n4.

The goal of this is to help improve the security and productivity of the Lido referral program.\n\nAs discussed on the forum, there is a huge potential in onboarding wallets and protocols as referrals from one side and problems with handling anonymous referrals (abuse cases, price peg destabilization, etc.) from the other side. Switch to 'whitelist mode' will help to onboard quality partners and reduce problem cases.\n\nLink to the forum discussion: https://research.lido.fi/t/switch-referral-program-to-whitelist-mode/1014\nReferral Program terms & conditions: https://lido.fi/referral-terms\n\nApplying 'whitelist mode' means:\n1. Only approved referrals are able to participate and get rewards.\n2. Anyone can propose a candidate for whitelisting on a Lido governance forum.\n3. Proposed candidates need to be approved and already whitelisted referrals to be regularly checked by Lido Analytical Team to filter out bad quality referrals (breaking the rules per terms & conditions) based on staking history. \n4. Pre-approve for whitelisting existing referrals:\nLedger, Argent, 1inch, Yearn, Mew, Math Wallet.\n\n\n\n",

Referral reward amount in LDO to be calculated each payout week based on ETH/USD and LDO/USD 14 days (whole referral period) TWAP to be 1% payback;\n2. Limit minimum referral amount to 5 LDO for 1 ETH staked.\n3. Limit maximum referral amount to 20 LDO for 1 ETH staked.\nUpdated reward amount to take effect at the next referral period after DAO voting.\n\nLink to the forum discussion: https://research.lido.fi/t/bind-referral-reward-to-1-payback/1021\n\nMotivation\nCurrently, the referral reward amount is 15 LDO for 1 ETH which is 2.4% payback (based on 14 days TWAP of LDO and ETH, see calculations below). Initial payback was ~1% at the date of the referral program launch. The referral reward amount is the key parameter that needs to be adjusted. Linking referral reward to 1% payback will help to use the rewarding budget most effectively, make the calculation process clear and transparent, keeping the referral program profitable and reaching the goals.\n\n",

      "content": "In collaboration with Lido and Polygon teams, Shard Labs announces a proposal to bring MATIC liquid staking to Polygon.\n\nWe propose to adopt the existing Lido solution, upgrade it to work with MATIC, and provide additional value to both MATIC and LDO token holders.\n\n\n# Timeline and Future Work\n\n- Phase 1: Research and specification [Jul-Aug 2021]\n- Phase 2: MVP Development and testnet deployment [Jul - August 2021]\nPhase 3: Production v1 development and audit [August 2021 - December 2021]\n- Phase 3: Mainnet deployment of v1 [January 2022]\n- Phase 4: Maintenance and support for v1 and planning for v2\n\n# Suggested Incentive Structure\n\nIt is a great challenge, but also an opportunity to build a Lido solution for the Polygon ecosystem. We are determined to put our best resources into this project to make it the best possible and grow the dedicated team and the project itself in the future.\n\nWe are proposing the following incentive structure that aligns with the long-term success of the Lido as well as Lido on Polygon:\n\n- Lido Token Incentives: Using vested tokens distributed according to agreed milestones\n- Revenue Share: Agreed ongoing revenue share between Shard Labs and the Lido\n\nFor delivering liquid staking solution we propose the following:\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting with 2 year vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 2.5% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting with 2 year vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 3% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting with 2 year vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 3.5% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting with 2 year vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 4% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 100,000 LDO tokens issued with vesting with 2 year vesting when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 4.5% of the staked MATIC supply\n- 500,000 in additional LDO tokens vesting over a 2 year when Lido for Polygon manages to capture 20% of the staked MATIC supply\n\n\nRevenue share incentives between Lido and Shard Labs: will be used to incentivize future growth and cover development and maintenance costs. As the lead development partner of Lido on Polygon, we suggest that Shard Labs receives 20% of the fee going to the Lido treasury, while the treasury itself retains the rest.\n\nIf the agreed KPIs are not reached, but the product is developed and delivered, we suggest the compensation of 100,000 $ to cover the basic development and audit costs.\n\nNote: each point will have to be reached and maintained for a month for the milestone to be achieved. For example if Lido reaches 2.5% MATIC supply and maintains it for a month, then milestone 1 is achieved, not before.",

If approved, the vote will be followed by a financing vote as part of our weekly omnibus vote, in which the funds will be allocated. The final amount of ETH allocated to the proposal will be determined by the price of Ethereum on the day of the omnibus vote (Thursday August 19th). \n\n### The full proposal can be read about in more detail [here]( https://research.lido.fi/t/fund-a-builder-first-legal-activism-dao/867).\n\nWe care deeply about the values and principles associated with DeFi and are big believers in crypto law, hence why we would like to work with the LeXpunK DAO to further research within this area. \n",

      "content": "The Lido Node Operator Subgovernance Group has evaluated 25 applications of staking provider organizations and decided to recommend the addition of 8 of them to the whitelisted Anchor bLUNA node operators on Terra.\n\nThe recommended node operators are:\n01node, Blockscape, Everstake, Figment, Smart Stake, SkillZ, Stakin, and Syncnode\n\nThis vote that will run for a week seeks to gather whether LDO holders support the onboarding of these. Our goal with onboarding new node operators is to improve the decentralization of Lido and Terra in general, to increase the resilience, as well as to onboard new organizations with strong skill sets and alignment with Lido to help grow liquid staking on Terra and on other networks.\nMore information can be found on the forum: \nhttps://research.lido.fi/t/landing-page-for-node-operators-and-open-applications-for-terra-and-solana/ ",

      "content": "The Lido Node Operator Subgovernance Group has evaluated 13 applications of staking provider organizations and decided to recommend the addition of four of them to the node operator set of Lido's staked ether product.\n\nThe four recommended node operators are:\nBlockscape, DSRV Labs, Everstake, SkillZ\n\nThis vote seeks to gather whether LDO holders support the onboarding of these four operators or not. Our goal with onboarding new node operators is to improve the decentralization of Lido and ETH2 in general and to increase the resilience against correlated slashings, as well as to onboard new organizations with strong skillsets and alignment with Lido to help grow liquid staking on Ethereum and on other networks.\n\nMore information can be found on the forum: https://research.lido.fi/t/eth2-new-node-operator-wave-1-recommendations/420",

      "content": "The proposal is to purchase that cover for 150000 stETH for 6 months by spending stETH from the insurance fund and topping up the rest by selling treasury’s LDO on the open market.\n\nUnslashed Finance proposed a purchase of a slashing cover policy for Lido:\nhttps://research.lido.fi/t/buy-slashing-insurance-for-steth-on-unslashed-finance/288\n\nThe policy was designed specifically to cover slashing and offline penalties risks and the losses that might result from it. The policy focuses on a slashing rate of 5% that could happen over a period of 2 months starting from the moment the triggering event takes place.\n\nThe policy also covers offline penalties that amount to more than 1% of the staked ETH for a single validator or Node Operator and a 5% maximum limit.\n\nThe pricing for this cover will vary between 1% and 1.5% per year of the slashable amount and is justified by the history of Lido’s Node Operators who have been running validators over more than 20 PoS networks during the last 2 years.\n\nOut of the more than 100 000 ETH being currently staked, 5 000 ETH would be slashable and the yearly cost would be 75 ETH maximum. Unslashed smart contracts being designed to work in cycles of 6 months, a deposit of around 37.5 ETH would allow to buy the cover and pay the insurance premium.\n\nThe non-consumed ETH at the end of the cycle will be automatically rolled over to provide insurance over the following cycle or could be withdrawn by the Lido DAO.\n\nThe Lido DAO will receive and hold Protection Tokens that will allow them to make a claim and get a reimbursement whenever a slashing event happens. The Lido DAO can stop the cover and get all non-used ETH back whenever they want, the premiums are being streamed in real-time and the model is a pay as you go model.\n\nThis policy will be subject to Cover Mining, which means the Cover bought by the Lido DAO will make them eligible to receive $USF tokens once these are released early march.\n\nPolicy document on IPFS, immutable:\nhttps://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQtQyKgiKf2mqPDMhbLQJYLP8v7ZDmrdkSYGSyE9fnjZV",
