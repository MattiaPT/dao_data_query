      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nZe_Boubs\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\n08/20/2024\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nProposal to extend my services to the DAO until 2025, September 29th. Amend working hours from 100hrs/month to 50hrs/month, at 30$/hr rate, starting 2024, September 29th.\n\n### **How have you already contributed to the DAO?**\n\nStarted volunteering at early DAO stages: became a mod late 21. \nBeen in charge of creation/management/security of both studio and DAO discords since then. \nCreation/ratification of the governance process with the gov team. Shephered dozens of proposals through governance. \nI’m on retainer since April 22. My tasks were originally described in **[GM 9.1 : hire Ze_Boubs as the DAO secretary/CM](https://www.notion.so/GM-9-1-hire-Ze_Boubs-as-the-DAO-secretary-CM-47fd2d05611d42948a3bf255731ec72d?pvs=21). \nWas made Board member of the gmDAO off-chain entity as the Secretary. In charge of supervising members subscriptions and KYC to the association, scheduling and hosting General Assemblies, writing minutes.\nManaged gm.studio’s instagram account, which includes working with the featured artists on appealing visuals, sharing content and key details around drops. Keep a beautiful, clean profile feed.\n\nWorked on the gm.dao rebrand, by helping the supervision of the visual assets design, the renewed website and the migration of V2 tokens to v3 tokens.\n\n### **How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward ?**\n\nAs we’re currently working in an environment where the NFT market is stagnant, there is a need for re-centering DAO expenses around our core needs, while being able to quickly turn-around should the situation change in the foreseeable future.  For that reason, i volunteered myself for cutting my work hours by more than 50% from my first retainer, reducing the weight on the DAO’s burnrate while still being able to take care of my core duties. \n\n Depending on what the urgent needs are, i’ll be able to switch my attention between my core duties with minimal friction, although my reduced hours may mean that it could take longer to get it done.\n\n- Manage Discord community :  moderation and administration of both DAO and studio discords , handle support and keep resources up to date all year long. Make myself fully available for crunch time around drops. Accompany artists from day 1 to post-drop community interactions on Discord.\n- Manage DAO community / Secretary tasks: Maintain and promote a vibrant community and its initiatives, create visuals to highlight processes and increase participation. Capture feedback from members and make sure their sentiment is heard. Help to structure the dao into a self-sustainable organization, create effective processes (applications, how to join a work group, how to require funding). Keep track of every community initiative and how it’s going, help members go through the dao processes and accompany them to create work group/request funding. Track important updates/needs across the DAO. Write regular updates to keep members in touch with what is going on, what are the newest community initiatives, and how they can contribute.\n- Track General Assembly members applications, organize the General Assembly meetings at least twice a year and more if requested. Write general assembly meetings reports and make it publicly available to members.\n- Governance/side tasks : Ensure funding cycle calendar, DAO Proposal, contributors list and all associated Governance process pages in Notion are up to date. Shepherd proposals through the governance process by watching temperature checks in Discord, publish and alert about Snapshots. Initiate governance process updates when needed.\n- Diverse admin tasks : Be available for any current needs.\n\n### **Specifics:**\n\nI estimate the average workload to be around 1.5 to 2 hours /day, averaging 12 hrs/week. I don’t expect the NFT market to pick up significant pace in the next 12 months, which would require increased presence. \n\nIdeally, my wage would be more flexible and keep track of my work hours every week. However, this would require additional paperwork, and i wouldn’t want to keep myself in a position where i can’t have visibility on my next payslip. \n\n### **Risks:**\n\nImpact on treasury. Default of my obligations under the terms of the agreed retainer.\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\nzeboubs.eth\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\nPart-time commitment for 50hours/month. 1500$ distributed monthly over a 12 -months period, totalizing 18000$.",

      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nCyphr\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nAugust 21, 2024\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThis proposal is to retain me (Cyphr) as a full-time contributor to the DAO & studio. This proposal would cover the period of September 2024 - September 2025.\n\nOver the past 12 months I have worked full time undertaking the tasks outlined in [**GM74.1 : Cyphr 12 month retainer 2023/24**](https://snapshot.org/#/gmdao.eth/proposal/0x9d03cbfcdd1b76e5a6d183cfec3aa2966031f6e6290edeb642efac19fe42843d). Additionally I have taken on new responsibilities created with the formation of gm.scribe (ordinal art platform) & gm.generator (generative minting as a service platform).\n\nGeneral responsibilities remain mostly unchanged, with the exception the gmDAO twitter account which has since been handled by an external agency. New responsibilities have typically revolved around business development & project management for gm.generator, which has proven itself to be a reliable and cost efficient revenue source. \n\n****To reflect current lack of direct inflows to the DAO treasury (the majority of inflows go directly to the studio/generator/scribe treasury), I am proposing that a percentage of my retainer be subsidised by [gm.studio](http://gm.studio). The overall retainer will remain the same as the previous proposal, as my hours are unchanged, but splitting it across gmDAO/gm.studio will mitigate the direct impact to gmDAO’s run rate.\n\nShould the market situation not improve and our treasury does not see an increase in inflows in the coming months, I would be prepared to review my retainer in order to ensure the longevity of the DAO. \n\n**Update:** During the discussion phase of this proposal, a number of members requested increased transparency around the DAO financial situation & specifically that of gm.studio. As such, we have created two documents which provide both a high level overview of the DAO’s financial health, as well as an in-depth document which details the studio’s current liquidity as well as major inflows/outflows. \n\nThe DAO overview can be found here:  https://github.com/gmdaoeth/Financial-data/blob/main/gmDAO%20financial%20snapshot.pdf\n\nThe studio finance document is available upon request: contact Cyphr via discord or at Cyphr@gmdao.org\n\n### How **have you already contributed to the DAO?**\n\nDuring my previous retainer the following milestones were achieved: \n\n- Provided employment opportunities for over 20+ individuals. Mostly DAO members.\n- Launched our first B2B product (gm.generator).\n- Won our first major B2B project: Ledger ($100K one-time revenue).\n- Won our first major B2B ongoing client: MakersPlace.\n- Launched gm.scribe, generating over $100K revenue with it’s first sale.\n- Completed DAO rebrand.\n- DAO website relaunch.\n\n### How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?**\n\nFor my proposed retainer my primary goals are:\n \n\n- Create, rebalance & recapture revenue streams to maintain treasury above 500k.\n- Win 4 net new gm.generator clients.\n- Generator secures 100K+ ARR (annual recurring revenue).\n- gm.studio ‘relaunch’ (new drops, dedicate more budget & focus on past works).\n- Develop a product that is member focused, not revenue driven.\n\n### Risks:\n\nHigh impact on treasury\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\n*cyphr.eth*\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\n**gmDAO**\n\n30 hours a week / 100 hours a month @ $100/hour =\n\n**$12,000 per month / $144,000 total.**\n\n**gm.studio**\n\n5 hours a week / 20 hours a month @ $100/hour =\n\n**$2,000 per month / $24,000 total.**",

      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nZe_Boubs & Cyphr\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\n2/16/24\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nFirst goal of this proposal is to gain permission to use the “gm.” brand under the “gm.scribe” banner.\n\nSecondly, proposal aims at enacting the creation of a new entity : “gm.scribe”. This entity will distribute art on bitcoin through offering ordinals/inscriptions while leveraging “gm.generator”, the rendering tech developed by gm.studio.\n\n### **Rationale:**\n\nWe believe ordinals have reached a point where it’s likely going to stay relevant for a while. We also strongly feel that the ethos of immutability and decentralization offered by the bitcoin blockchain aligns perfectly with our vision. Art is for all, and every artist should be able to choose the blockchain they want to release on. We want to capitalize on the ordinals growth trend, especially given limited number of platforms offering high quality art on ordinals today. \n\nWith the credibility that we’ve built up via gm.studio on ETH, we’re confident that this reputation will translate to immediate demand from the current ordinals community, who have shown an immense interest in collection art on Bitcoin.\n\nOur first drop is already secured, and in the unlikely event that this proposal does not pass, we will consider launching under a non-gm branded entity. \n\n### **Specifics:**\n\nThere are no immutable specifics yet on the positioning of this new entity with regards to gm.studio’s offerings. As said above, we’re looking at a relatively untapped market by being one of the first platforms to offer help on launching art on ordinals. It is also a good ad for the gm.generator product, which has yet to be announced publicly. \n\nUp to now, gm.studio has been fully subsidizing the creation of the entire gm.scribe solution, both from a front-end and back-end perspective. As such, gm.studio would look to recoup the entirety of these costs from the initial release revenue. Any subsequent profits and the ownership of gm.scribe will remain in DAO’s hands, and require an additional proposal to formalize it’s incorporation. \n\nIf successful, we would look to establish gm.scribe as its own platform completely separate from gm.studio. \n\nCurrently the platform is being developed and managed by the [gm.studio](http://gm.studio) team. This would likely continue in practice, but depending on other demands & commitments additional team members may be required. \n\nIn regards to the initial release, our strategy is to eliminate any barriers to entry to ensure the best possible outcome for the drop, meaning no token holder benefits (i.e AL or discount). However it is our intention to weave the token into future releases once we’ve proven the viability of the platform.   \n\n### **Pros:**\n\nEnter the ordinals market.\n\nSpread the awareness around the gm.brand, and gm.generator.\n\nSpread awareness to artists.\n\nMake us known as agile and fast-paced execution on everything NFTesque.\n\nBring back attention on the DAO.\n\n### **Cons :**\n\nNo cons wrt financials since all costs have been covered by gm.studio.\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\nNone",

      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nBrpunkrmax\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\n12.20.23\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nWork to help the DAO re-engage with the larger NFT community and increase its relevance in the broader crypto community. \n\n### **Rationale:**\n\nWe are starting to see the winds of the NFT market shift towards a more favorable direction. As this happens, it’s up to us as a DAO to ensure we are positioned to capitalize on the increased demand for digital art as well as influx of new ecosystem participants. We cannot rest on our laurels from the last bull run and cannot take our relevance for granted. We need to remind the broader NFT community the greatness of gmDAO, increase brand visibility and work hard to attract new members. \n\n### **Specifics:**\n\nOverall, Brpunkrmax and Defi Beats are involved with the below entities and can leverage their reach in order to accomplish the goal of making gmDAO a global crypto brand. \n\n-CryptoOracle Collective \n\n-CryptoMondays and our other partnerships\n\n-MakersPlace\n\n-Rug Radio\n\n-NFTNYC\n\nWe want to utilize some of the DAOs resources to bring gmDAO to the forefront of the NFT space before the next bull market fully kicks off.\n\nFirst, we’d like to do a **deep dive on our current members** and get a much better understanding of the social following we all have, and what everyone is and is not willing to do to help promote the DAO. We want to strategize engagement of the DAO community to promote gm brand in their circles.\n\nCyphr is our cult leader and is much more useful spreading the gmDAO gospel, interacting with artists and building our brand than handling all of the gm socials. We would like to **find someone who can do community management from an external point of view, create a content calendar and manage it with engagement on all of our socials.**\n\nWe would also like to **fold gm into many of the IRL events** that we put on globally, especially conferences that are vital for NFTs like Art Basel, NFTNYC and NFT Paris.\n\nTo make this a reality we are thinking the following over 12 months with the following commitments:\n\n**Performing a deep dive on gm DAO**\n-Who is in the DAO\n-What they want to see moving forward\n-What utility we can provide with our global resources to DAO members to promote increase in token price\n-What they are willing to do to help promote the DAO on a weekly basis\n\n**Hiring a full-time social media person for the DAO** \n-Working out a content strategy to involve DAO members in the promotional activities for the DAO, to make the brand the strongest it can be\n\n-This person would take the burden of managing our social media accounts (twitter/X and any others) from Cyphr and post and engage regularly as well as attend spaces on our behalf\n\n-They will be responsible for writing content and distributing\n\n**Having gm sponsor and co-sponsor events around the world with our partners** \n- We are thinking of isolating it to the 5 best events in 2024 for the DAO\n\n**Exploring partnerships with existing communities and attracting new talent to the DAO**\n\nStagnation kills communities. We can not simply rely on higher Crypto prices to bring more people into the space. We need to seek out and engage with new talent and attract them to the DAO. We already have an established artist in the space willing to work with the Studio on a new blockchain as a starting point.\n\nAll of the above would be best accomplished by spinning up a Biz Dev and Partnerships team lead by Brpunkrmax who can manage a small group dedicated to posting on social and developing partnerships with valuable brands, creators, artists and thought leaders.\n\n![Capture d’écran 2024-01-27 à 07.34.10.png](ipfs://bafkreidz6kv4c6wdvdjfi4q4w7nkanzwnmdux4ft4xswrktug3uiz47mdq)\n\n### **Pros:**\n\nGetting gm out into the wild where it can gain exposure to future DAO members. More eyeballs on our drops. More members in the studio discord. Value of the gm token driven up. \n\n### **Cons :**\n\nCost.\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\nThe Biz Dev / Partnership team members (TBD)\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\n$4,500-$7,000 a month for a 3-months trial period, this could be extended to 12 months in another vote.\n\nTOTAL = $13,500-$21,000\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nCyphr, Defi Beats",

      "content": "## **Author:**\n\nDefi Beats\n\n## **Abstract:**\n\nAllocate some of our stable coins into “Savings DAI” to receive interest. \n\n## **Motivation/Rationale:**\n\nAt the moment, we have a large amount of stables (~140,000 USD) which mostly sit in our treasury when it could be used to generate yield. \n\n## **Specifics:**\n\nAllocate 35% of our stables (~50,000 USD) into DAI stable coin \n\nConvert our DAI into Savings DAI on [Summer.fi](http://Summer.fi) and earn 3-5% annually \n\nDSR yield right now is 3.5-5% depending on utilization. Most revenues come from DAI being transferred to USDC and sent to custodians who deposit the funds in laddered treasury bills. \n\n---\n\nFrom the [Summer.fi](http://Summer.fi) Website:\n\n## **Where does the yield come from?**\n\nThe yield comes from the profits generated by MakerDAO. Since Maker wants Dai to be used extensively in DeFi it has a mechanism for incentivizing users to hold Dai. Redistributing a part of the profits of MakerDAO for the Dai Savings Rate makes Dai grow. To understand the DSR, it could be compared to base rates of different fiat currencies since the yield comes directly from the entity that works to back the coin. This, in turn, has the same effect as what happens in the world of currencies: users are incentivized to swap other coins with no base rate for Dai. This increases the demand and supply of Dai making it more used, which is the end goal of Maker: to have DAI as a leading stablecoin in DeFi.\n\n---\n\nMore context as to where the yield comes from in this breakdown (https://makerburn.com/#/rundown)\n\n## **Pros :**\n\nOur stables grow in value while giving our treasury balance. \n\n## **Cons:**\n\nSmart contract, governance, and custodial are the main risks, however Maker is one of the oldest protocols in defi. \n\nFrom the [Summer.fi](http://Summer.fi) website:\n\n## **What are the risks?**\n\n1. Lower than expected returns: Maker makes no promise of how long the Dai Savings Rate will be at the shown level. If the Dai Savings Rate changes, users can leave their money deposited there until the rate changes again, decide to withdraw or deposit more. The changes only affect the rate of earning, the principal deposited is always available for withdrawal. Dai in the DSR has no lockup, money is not lent out or used in any fashion.\n2. Systemic risk: Summer.fi works tirelessly to have the safest and most trusted platform to deploy capital and conducts regular audits of its contracts and places security as the top priority, nevertheless blockchains have unavoidable risks arising from smart contract bugs or fatal errors in any protocols being used.\n\n## **Sponsors :**\n\nWestwood",

This is a forecast based on my previous work, so the full amount will probably not be used, and is only intended to cover the actual cost of my work over 6 months. Each month, a stipend will be communiicated to DefiBeats.\n\n### **How have you already contributed to the DAO?**\n\nI’ve been producing graphical works for gmDAO’s since beginning of 2022, shortly after its inception in 2021. My first intiative at gmDAO was “The Gazette” which reported news from within & outside the dao.\n\nThe gazette evolved to a press branch (cf [GM 26.1 : Funding press branch ](https://www.notion.so/GM-26-1-Funding-press-branch-efe3aa61c33e438fb7e82069e8355fd9?pvs=21)).  The creation of the gmPress was accompanied by a gnosis to remunerate its various members, myself included, to the tune of **40 USD/hour** (junior graphic designer rate). The gnosis gmPress closed its doors on August 1, 2023. However, I'm still working for the gmDAO (currently creating a branding identity aimed to the gmDAO's internal producers).\n\nI worked for various gmDAO contributors such as Cyphr, Zeboubs, Calbear, Nemochaken... **All my visuals are available on request and already avaiable on gm’s drive**\n\n### **Cons:**\n\nImpact on treasury\n\nHeavily subjected to my studies and an incoming internship, slowing my creative process and availability. \n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\nspeeps\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\n⚠️ Just as before, my work **cannot exceed** **20 hours/month.** So I can only be compensated up to a maximum of 800 USD/month. On average though, I was compensated at 500 USD/month.\n\nMaximum of 20 hours a month @ $40/hour = **$800 per month /\n$4800 total.**\n\n### **Sponsors:**\nZe_Boubs",

      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nZe_Boubs\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\n09/13/2023\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nExtend Ze_Boubs retainer for 12 months until 2024, September 29th. Reduce working hours from 120hrs/month to 100hrs/month, at 30$/hr rate.\n\n### **How have you already contributed to the DAO?**\n\nStarted volunteering at early DAO stages: became a mod late 21. \nBeen in charge of creation/management/security of both studio and DAO discords since then. \nCreation/ratification of the governance process with the gov team. Shephered dozens of proposals through governance. \nI’m on retainer since April 22. My tasks were originally described in **[GM 9.1 : hire Ze_Boubs as the DAO secretary/CM](https://www.notion.so/GM-9-1-hire-Ze_Boubs-as-the-DAO-secretary-CM-47fd2d05611d42948a3bf255731ec72d?pvs=21). \nBoard member of the gmDAO off-chain entity as the Secretary. In charge of supervising members subscriptions and KYC to the association, scheduling and hosting General Assemblies, writing minutes.\nManager of gm.studio’s instagram account, which includes working with the featured artists on appealing visuals, share content and key details around drops. Keep a beautiful, clean profile feed.\n\n### **How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward ?**\n\nMy position includes several tasks & duties.\n\nManage Discord community :  moderation and administration of both DAO and studio discords , handle support and keep resources up to date all year long. Make myself fully available for crunch time around drops. Accompany artists from day 1 to post-drop community interactions on Discord.\n\nManage [gm.studio](http://gm.studio) instagram account while it’s in-house managed.\n\nManage DAO community / Secretary tasks: Maintain and promote a vibrant community and its initiatives, create visuals to highlight processes and increase participation. Capture feedback from members and make sure their sentiment is heard. Help to structure the dao into a self-sustainable organization, create effective processes (applications, how to join a work group, how to require funding). Keep track of every community initiative and how it’s going, help members go through the dao processes and accompany them to create work group/request funding. Track important updates/needs across the DAO. Make a quick weekly overall summary to keep members in touch with what is going on, what are the newest community initiatives, how they can contribute.\n\nTrack General Assembly members applications, organize the General Assembly meetings at least twice a year and more if requested. Write general assembly meetings reports and make it publicly available to members.\n\nGovernance/side tasks : Ensure funding cycle calendar, DAO Proposal, contributors list and all associated Governance process pages in Notion are up to date. Shepherd proposals through the governance process by watching temperature checks in Discord, publish and alert about Snapshots. Initiate governance process updates when needed.\n\n**What i want to implement looking forward :** work on switching our DAO governance to our own website/external forum, using a web3 native, token gated forum for DAO governance. Have a delegation dashboard available on our own website, that will allow people to pick a delegate based on freely available information, stats and intro.\n\n### **Specifics:**\n\nI estimate the average workload to be around 25 hrs/week, which is slightly lower than the previous 30 hrs/week. I don’t expect the NFT market to pick up significant pace in the next 12 months, which would require increased presence. \n\nHowever, i’m this time asking for a 12 month renewal. I think i’ve proven my value overtime and would not want to keep myself in a position where i can’t have more than 6 months visibility. \n\n### **Risks:**\n\nImpact on treasury. Default of my obligations under the terms of the agreed retainer.\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\nPart-time commitment for 100hours/month. 3000$ distributed monthly over a 12 -months period, totalizing 36000$.",

      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nDeFi Beats\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nAugust 9 2023\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThis proposal aims to cover funding for the studio for the month of June and July (2023)\n\n**A note on things in flux.**\n\nThe DAO has now incorporating the studio as a company! This proposal is designed to pay our hard working devs for work done in both June and July of this year. \n\n**Core team salaries**\n\n>💡 We ask that the DAO understands that we may need some flexibility in how we allocate money and spend time. For that reason, we continue to outline rates and expected hours, but reserve the right to allocate those hours internally at Bhosh’s discretion. For example, we may need more web based work rather than contract work for a given month, so we’d allocate more hours for the web engineers.\n\nWe will maintain our existing rates for time spent:\n\n- Senior Developer = $125/hr\n- Non-senior Developer = $65/hr\n\n**Infrastructure costs**\n\nFunding for infrastructure is variable and slightly complex. As we use many tools which all have different billing cycles, it’s quite hard to get an exact amount that we’ll need in advance. For this reason I propose that we have a maximum allocation of $2000 and a minimum allocation of $1000. We’ll send $1000 month to our infrastructure credit card to cover existing spending. If our costs change substantially, we are able to request up to $1000 more per month without another proposal.\n\n**Promotion**, **Incentive schemes and other costs**\n\nIn the past we have used contractors to produce promotional materials such as videos for marketing our releases.

In practice we have found that a release requires us to be online consistently for the duration of the drop (and afterwards), which can be ~10-12 hours of time. Allocating 0.5 Eth is significantly cheaper than paying for those hours.\n\n**Summary of spend for June/July**\n\n| Component | Costs for both months |\n\n| Michal  | $5,,750 |\n| Bhosh | $1,812.50 |\n| Dom (design) | $1,000 |\n| Infrastructure | $600 |\n\n| Total | $9,162.50 |\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nDefi Beats, Bhosh, Cyphr",

      "title": "GM 72.1 : gm.studio funding for May 2023",
      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nDeFi Beats\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nJune 22 2023\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThis proposal aims to cover funding for the studio for the month of May\n\n**A note on things in flux.**\n\nThe DAO is very close to incorporating the studio as a company. Whilst we wait to finalize the arrangement we need to fund our hard working devs for the month of April. \n\n**Core team salaries**\n\n>💡 We ask that the DAO understands that we may need some flexibility in how we allocate money and spend time. For that reason, we continue to outline rates and expected hours, but reserve the right to allocate those hours internally at Willyham’s discretion. For example, we may need more web based work rather than contract work for a given month, so we’d allocate more hours for the web engineers.\n\nWe will maintain our existing rates for time spent:\n\n- Senior Developer = $125/hr\n- Non-senior Developer = $65/hr\n\n**Other costs**\n\nIn practice we have found that we sometimes need to bring other people in to help with specific tasks. Whilst we can’t predict these too far in advance, we’d like to reserve the right to pay up to $2500/month for outside help. This is equivalent to 5 hours/week of a senior engineer or ~10 hours/week for a less senior engineer. If there was no need for using this time in a specific month, we would not include it in the payment between the dao and the studio wallets.\n\n**Infrastructure costs**\n\nFunding for infrastructure is variable and slightly complex. As we use many tools which all have different billing cycles, it’s quite hard to get an exact amount that we’ll need in advance. For this reason I propose that we have a maximum allocation of $2000 and a minimum allocation of $1000. We’ll send $1000 month to our infrastructure credit card to cover existing spending. If our costs change substantially, we are able to request up to $1000 more per month without another proposal.\n\n**Promotion**, **Incentive schemes and other costs**\n\nIn the past we have used contractors to produce promotional materials such as videos for marketing our releases. We expect this to continue and would like to reserve up to $2000/month to fund this.\n\nWe anticipate a month cost for carbon offsetting of around $250.\n\nWe will continue our tradition of allocating 0.5 Eth to each core team member who is present for the day of the drop. In practice we have found that a release requires us to be online consistently for the duration of the drop (and afterwards), which can be ~10-12 hours of time. Allocating 0.5 Eth is significantly cheaper than paying for those hours.\n\nAdditionally, we wish to allocate some potential funds towards incentive schemes to attract artists to the platform. For example, we may want to pay a referral bonus to anyone who introduces us to an artist that has a collection accepted by our curation panel. There may also be other mechanisms which we choose to use and these would be at the core team’s discretion. We are requesting a maximum of $1000/m for this.\n\n![Capture d’écran 2023-07-01 à 15.03.34.png](ipfs://bafkreiheiu4rnf4f3yioyj5jmc65wzgg6l653ogo46xyyae5n7hvl4dtme)\n    \n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nDefi Beats, Willyham",

      "content": "### Author:\n\nDefi Beats \n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nJune 7, 2023\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nIt is time to release payment for the second of 3 invoices for our Lawyers who are assisting us in incorporating the DAO and Studio. Old approved proposal below for reference. \n\n### OLD PROPOSAL FROM AUGUST 2022**:**\n\nTL:DR - Hire a Lawyer to incorporate our DAO and Studio (and an entity to new ‘products’). **This proposal is for invoice #1** **only**\n\nUnder existing laws, it is possible a court or regulator could view the DAO, given its unincorporated status, as a general partnership. This could potentially create a lot of risk for individual members of the DAO.\n\nIn addition to this we will need to pay taxes for the year 2022 and wish to incorporate in a jurisdiction with the most advantageous tax code.\n\nLastly, with the idea of $GMC being thrown around we want to retain a lawyer who can help us keep this above board and within best practices.\n\nBecause of this, we have started interviewing web3 Lawyers and hope to bring the best candidate in front of the DAO for a vote. We have isolated one candidate who has a lot of experience incorporating DAOs in Switzerland. We will share a lot more details but the idea here is to get the conversation started since we would like to move fairly quickly.\n\nWe think that the DAO should be incorporated as a non-profit while the studio should be a for profit entity - However, this is 100% up to what the lawyer recommends and what we vote on as a group in the future.\n\n### **Risks:**\n\nHiring the wrong firm and wasting the DAO’s money\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\n**[LOREZ LEGAL](https://www.lorezlegal.com/)**\n\n### **Why This Firm?:**\n\nThe firm was recommended by a lawyer that is working with a side project from one of the gmDAO member. He was told that she was specializing in wrapping DAOs in Switzerland. She was one of the three candidates for addressing the incorporation of gmDAO.\n\nShe has wide experience as she has wrapped more than 40 DAOs in Switzerland. She presented the arguments on why Switzerland is the best location as it is a safe regulatory environment, friendly tax related and advantages for marketing (Cryptovalley). She identified the different possible scenarios how to set up DAO and the Studio based on her experienced.\n\n### **How We Will Go About This?**\n\nWe will continue to update this proposal as more information becomes available. But wanted to start the discussion process now as it’s in all of our best interests to start soon.\n\nFull SOW can be found here:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1RPygrlXQ6SYqUmZprZtJSeWzpHlmmI7S\n\n### Already Paid\n\n**Updated 6.07.23**\n\nTotal = 60,000 CHF ($**62,721.54 USD)**\n\n(PAID) First Invoice = 30,000 (**$31,280.94 USD**)\n\n(DUE NOW) Second Invoice = 15,000 (**$16,511.5 USD**)\n\n(DUE IN FUTURE*)Third Invoice = 15,000 (**$16,511.5 USD**)\n\n*payment will be released once services are rendered and fully completed.  \n\n### Released in this proposal \n\n- 30,000 CHF **($33,023 UDC) 5.5% of treasury** \n(of the three lawyers we spoke to, all three were within this range)\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nCyphr",

      "title": "GM 66.1 : gm.studio funding for April",
      "content": "## **Author:**\n\nWillyham & DeFi Beats\n\n## **Proposal date:**\n\nMay 14 2023\n\n## **Summary:**\n\nThis proposal aims to cover funding for the studio for the month of April\n\n### **A note on things in flux.**\n\nThe DAO is very close to incorporating the studio as a company. Whilst we wait to finalize the arrangement we need to fund our hard working devs for the month of April. \n\n### **Core team salaries**\n\nWe have recently undertaken a significant amount of work with the latest drops to support delegation, new phases (i.e. collector phase), increased anti-bot work, and new design features for the website. We will continue to develop many of these things, as well as work to improve the website drastically going forwards with the help of a professional designer (Swillis). To account for the realities of the time being spent, this proposal doubles the number of paid hours for Willyham.\n****\n\n>💡 We ask that the DAO understands that we may need some flexibility in how we allocate money and spend time. For that reason, we continue to outline rates and expected hours, but reserve the right to allocate those hours internally at Willyham’s discretion. For example, we may need more web based work rather than contract work for a given month, so we’d allocate more hours for the web engineers.\n\nWe will maintain our existing rates for time spent:\n\n- Senior Developer = $125/hr\n- Non-senior Developer = $65/hr\n\n### **Other costs**\n\nIn practice we have found that we sometimes need to bring other people in to help with specific tasks. Whilst we can’t predict these too far in advance, we’d like to reserve the right to pay up to $2500/month for outside help. This is equivalent to 5 hours/week of a senior engineer or ~10 hours/week for a less senior engineer. If there was no need for using this time in a specific month, we would not include it in the payment between the dao and the studio wallets.\n\n### **Infrastructure costs**\n\nFunding for infrastructure is variable and slightly complex. As we use many tools which all have different billing cycles, it’s quite hard to get an exact amount that we’ll need in advance. For this reason I propose that we have a maximum allocation of $2000 and a minimum allocation of $1000. We’ll send $1000 month to our infrastructure credit card to cover existing spending. If our costs change substantially, we are able to request up to $1000 more per month without another proposal.\n\n### **Promotion**, **Incentive schemes and other costs**\n\nIn the past we have used contractors to produce promotional materials such as videos for marketing our releases. We expect this to continue and would like to reserve up to $2000/month to fund this.\n\nWe anticipate a month cost for carbon offsetting of around $250.\n\nWe will continue our tradition of allocating 0.5 Eth to each core team member who is present for the day of the drop. In practice we have found that a release requires us to be online consistently for the duration of the drop (and afterwards), which can be ~10-12 hours of time. Allocating 0.5 Eth is significantly cheaper than paying for those hours.\n\nAdditionally, we wish to allocate some potential funds towards incentive schemes to attract artists to the platform. For example, we may want to pay a referral bonus to anyone who introduces us to an artist that has a collection accepted by our curation panel. There may also be other mechanisms which we choose to use and these would be at the core team’s discretion. We are requesting a maximum of $1000/m for this.\n\n### **Summary of spend**\n\nAs the spending is slightly flexible. we will outline the overall minimum and maximum spend. In reality we are likely to always have something in between.\n\n![Capture d’écran 2023-05-21 à 10.10.52.png](ipfs://bafkreicgpkgokgqbvftls3zstxvxm3zclnbggpay5vdyykdjb46p6r7pkq)\n\n## **Sponsors:**\n\nDefi Beats, Willyham\n    ",

This snapshot vote guarantees the addition of the following informations into the AoA :\n- 7.5% of shares will be fully distributed among the founders and represents the 1 year served potion. The remaining 7.5% will be distributed to the founders after the 2nd year is served, thus bringing the total up to 15% after 2 years.\n- transfer of shares : the DAO as a majority shareholder gets first refusal on any share sales from team members.\n\n### Funding :\n\nCost breakdown of the Part.1 (already voted) :\n\n>Incorporation fee: Nul (covered by previous proposal)\nStarting capital for GmbH: CHF 20,000\nAnnual fee for authorised signatory: CHF 10,000 / year\nBoard & company insurance: Est.

      "title": "GM62.1 : Retainer amendment and extension for Dirty as Collab Manager",
      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nDirty\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\n12/04/2023\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThis is a proposal to amend and extend a_dirty_boy's retainer as a collab manager for 40 hours per month (a decrease of 20 hours) at $30 per hour for a duration of 1 month from April 19th 2023.\n\nIt also includes a request for a monthly payment of $80 to cover the Alphabot paid subscription costs.\n\n### **Rationale:**\n\n**How have I already contributed to the DAO?**\n\nI’ve been an active member since November 2021, a Multisignatory since May 2022 and a Mod since July 2022; I’ve volunteered a lot of my time to gmDAO projects, drafting proposals, arranging both inbound and outbound collabs, following up on leads referred by members, building relationships with external projects and creators, creating competitions and more general project outreach.\n\nI’ve created a system to keep track of inbound and outbound collab requests, referrals, contacts, competitions and results using a combination of google forms and sheets. I’ve increased security by using specific wallets and discord profiles for use when visiting project websites and joining project servers. I’ve implemented project account ownership verification on twitter via the @gmDAOcollab account.\n\nI’ve grown and maintained a network of both resident and freelance collab managers.\n\n**More information on my current role**\n\nI’ve decided to both shorten this proposal length and reduce my hours for APR/MAY so that I can take some time out this month to….\n\ngo outside more.\n\nI’ll submit a new proposal in May with a return to normal hours. \n\n**Subscription costs for Alphabot**\n\nThe monthly cost to be able to create and post giveaways using their service is now $80.00. \n\n**How does arranging collabs and project outreach currently provide value to gmDAO?**\n\nArranging AL collabs provides value to gmDAO members in a number of ways:\n\n- **Time saved** - The time that I spend arranging the AL collabs is time that members don’t have to spend to get themselves allowlisted individually.\n- **Guaranteed spots or increased odds** - I always aim for our allocations to be in excess of the average number of competition entries for the giveaways. In cases where this is not possible; entrants have vastly better odds at securing spots through the gmDAO giveaways vs external giveaways.\n- **Financial gain -** Although gains can’t be guaranteed I want members to be in a position to mint and take profits on successful, allowlisted collections wherever possible.\n- **Expanding our network -** Our collab opportunities grow as our network expands\n\nThe above does not generate income for the DAO treasury. It is aimed squarely at providing value to our token holders.\n\n### **Specifics:**\n\n**How do I want to contribute to the DAO going forward?**\n\nI want to be able to continue with my current collab management tasks, refine and streamline the processes to allow for more volume and to dedicate more time to networking with other projects/collab managers. I also want to simplify the entry process for members so that they don’t miss AL opportunities. I aim to continue providing value to our members through time saved, increased exposure to new projects and potential financial gain.\n\n### Risks**:**\n\nImpact on treasury. Default of my obligations under the terms of the agreed retainer.\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\na_dirty_boy - 0x9df5388d04A02a96eb917056A94C192129E982e5\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\n$30 per hour for 40 hours per month over 1 month. I’ve based this rate on the current DAO rate for Ze_Boubs which is at the bottom end of the scale. It is also in line with my current employer's standard overtime rate of £26.20 per hour. Matching this rate gives me the freedom to lower the amount of overtime I have to commit to other work to stay financially secure while allowing me to dedicate more time to working for gmDAO.\n\n40 Hours total @ $30 per hour - $1,200\n1 month Alphabot subscription @ $80 pcm - $80\n\nTotal payment over 1 month - $1,280\n\n0.21% of the current treasury ($598,085)\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n*Ze_Boubs*",

      "title": "GM61.1 : Create the “gmDAO Project Incentive Program”",
      "content": "**Authors:**\ncalbear.eth, Ninja3\n\n**Proposal date:**\nMarch 31st\n\n**Summary**\nProblem: gmDAO needs additional revenue sources to stay cash flow neutral or positive. While we as a DAO have encouraged ideas for projects that generate additional revenues, we have never incentivized the deliverance of those ideas into formal projects. Therefore, individuals proposing projects to be launched through gmDAO take on personal risk in order to formulate projects for the DAO without knowing whether they will pass. Much of the time, this discourages would-be contributors from pursuing projects that could be potentially beneficial for the DAO and for them personally. The DAO needs to create a structure and foster an environment that is welcoming and shows commitment to members that would like to pursue revenue generating projects. \n\nProposal: Create the “gmDAO Project Incentive Program” in order to incentivize profitable ventures to be seeded by gmDAO.\n\n**Action steps:**\n\nFormation of the Project Incentive Award Committee (PIAC): Purpose of the committee would be to review business plans, provide feedback to strengthen the business case, and ultimately vote whether to a) give the award and b) send the project proposal directly to a full-DAO vote. \n\n-Members apply to be on the committee\n-Voted on by the full-DAO\n-Top-3 by poll are added to the committee\n-Committee members will be compensated $500 USDC each per application review (up-to a maximum of 10 applications per year)\n\nIn the unlikely event that a PIAC member is not meeting acceptable review and feedback standards, they can be removed from PIAC at any time via 2/3rds vote of PIAC or a full DAO vote.\n\n*Sample application to join the PIAC here:* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_V5-jPMzHuiOcmhXlUT5DPksfSGMRpqlzKzUEBWL0hM/edit*\n\nProcess: To apply for an award, the applicant group would present a proposal (business-plan) for a project to the PIAC for review. PIAC considers the active proposal and provides feedback until the group agrees it is finalized. If passed by the full PIAC, a $10,000 award will be given to the applicant/applicant group as the initial funding for the project. The proposal would move directly to a full-DAO vote (skip discussion). If passed by a full-DAO, the applicants would pursue the project as slated in the proposal.\n\nThe requirements for the proposals are:\n-That they meet the mission statement of gmDAO\n-That all expenses/equity split/compensation rates are clearly accounted for\n-Be projected as cashflow positive to the DAO treasury over the proposed term \n-Preferential consideration would be given to projects that have some sort of reciprocal value to gm.embers\n-During the first year, this program would be exclusively available to gmDAO members \n-Be framed as a formal business proposal to the greatest extent possible\n\nAn acceptable review will adhere as closely as possible to this format: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PKmI0X14yxV_iX4wCuI5FEKShHfgKJL6DDw2JaxmMjM/edit\n\n**Funding:**\nUp-to 3 awards of $10,000 each will be allocated annually from the DAO treasury. Funded upon full-PIAC approval. In the event that no projects complete the full process during a given year, the awards will roll over into the following year. Additionally, the DAO treasury would pay PIAC members $500 per application review (up-to a max of 10 per year). \n\n**Risks:**\nImpact on the treasury\n\n**Payout amount:**\n$10,000 per award, maximum of $30,000 USD per year\n$500 per PIAC member per application review, maximum of $15,000 per year\n\nMaximum exposure per year $45,000 or ~7.5% of current DAO treasury\n\n**How have you already contributed to the DAO?**\nCurrent Community Engagement Manager\n\n**How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward?**\nInvolvement with further DAO-seeded projects\n\n**Sponsors:**\nNinja3, calbear.eth\n\n",

      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nZe_Boubs\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\n03/15/23\n\n### **Summary/Rationale:**\n\nFor several months now, one of most significant sources of revenue (creator royalties) has been circumvented by new marketplaces in the NFT landscape, bypassing royalties by leveraging clever loopholes in the seaport contract in which most of the platforms are built. The royalty change favors traders at the cost of creators & greatly impacts our long term sustainability. While the gm.studio has been able to adapt and evolve to this situation by using upgradable contracts for the last 2 releases, gmDAO itself has seen its creator’s royalties quickly declining towards zero. \n\nCreator’s Royalties previously served as the “membership fee” once joining the DAO, and meant that the flow of new members would feed the community treasury for the purposes of :\n- Paying full time contributors with functions that support the DAO \n- Paying part time contributors for AD hoc requests\n- funding community initiatives such as gm.erch, gm.press, gm.Studio, gmTezos, gm.consulting or gm.incentive program in the future.\n\nAll these expenses benefit the members both directly & indirectly.\n\nIn order to maintain our ability to enforce royalties, we are proposing a migration to an upgradable contract which will allow us to block platforms that attempt to circumvent royalty payments. \n\nA migration would also future proof the DAO tokens from any emerging platforms that attempt that take a similar stance to blur, giving us the ability to block new contracts as & when needed.\n\n### **Specifics:**\n\nMigrate GM.V2 tokens to a GM.V3 contract.\nThe GM.V3 contract shall be upgradable, which will allow us to allow/block any marketplace’s contract in the future. This way, we’ll be in the position to specifically block contracts that don’t enforce royalties.\n\nGM.V2 collection historical stats would be migrated to the GM.V3 contract on OS, thanks to the direct line we have with them. The GM.V2 contract would also be deprecated on OS to avoid confusion. In any case, the migration would not be time limited so anyone would always be able to upgrade their GM.V2 to a GM.V3.\n\nWe’d be incentivizing people to migrate by conditioning any utility to the ownership of a V3 token, such as discord access, gm.erch and [gm.studio](http://gm.studio) whitelisting/rebate utility.\n\n**Contributors :**\nWillyham has offered to create the GM.V3 contract under his gm.studio time. We’d also have a front-end page on the gmDAO website for an easy and understandeable migration.\n\nWe’d like to budget a 5K additional cost *in the case* we’d need to pay another contributor, for front-end/design/marketing/communication purpose. Should we not need this specific budget, this allocation would be retained in the multisig.\n\n### **Pros:**\n\nRoyalties back into the community treasury. Runway goes up, yield goes up, sustainability is improved. \n\n### **Cons :**\n\nConfusion of having a new contract.\n\nMaintenance of old collections (GM.V1 and GM.V2).\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\nTBD.\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\nMax. 5K$ ( 0.84% of treasury at this time).\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nZe_Boubs, Cyphr",

      "title": "GM57.2 : Governance V3",
      "content": "# Author:\n\nZe_Boubs\n\n# Abstract/Rationale:\n\nThis proposal aims at enacting governance V3, which shall match the principles of the gmDAO association articles. It is recommended for anyone to read the association’s founding articles at [Articles of Association](https://www.notion.so/Articles-of-Association-67bff15d1a664095a07dc4992862ce0f) . This proposal will display all the off-chain association structure in order to include it into our wiki, and ratify role and responsabilities over legal obligations. \nThis proposal also aims at fixing some of the governance issues we noticed through the past 6 months : bring more clarity over the creation of workgroups, dissolution of DAO, dismissal of contributors, and enable anonymous voting within the scope of what snapshot offers at the moment. It also introduces different types of voting systems and how members will be able to use them in the future.\n\n# Specifics:\n\n## Context\n\nThe gmDAO is now incorporated off-chain as per the Swiss law as an non-profit association, domiciled in Zug, Switzerland. Being an association involves legal and moral duties according to Switzerland’s law. Therefore, our governance process needs to match those requirements while staying true to our original vision of a tokenholders driven, decentralized, flat-hierarchy governance. Incorporation allows us to :\n\n- **Interact with other parties:** Our DAO couldn’t sign contracts or enter into agreements without corporate personhood, which our DAO gained when it created the association.\n- **Protect the liability of our contributors:** If our DAO was not incorporated, it could be considered a general partnership. This means that all our contributors would be liable in the case of a lawsuit or other legal issue.\n- **Hire employees:** The gmDAO needed a legal wrapper to legally hire employees rather than paying workers “under the table,” or “off the books,” which is technically considered tax evasion.\n- **Pay taxes:** To be legally compliant, DAOs need to pay their taxes. Whenever money is changing hands, we needed to consider the tax implications.\n\n## Organs of the gmDAO association (off-chain)\n\nAccording to the Swiss law, the association has to be composed of three organs, which allows mutual monitoring of their actions. These organs, their rights and duties are described below. I’ll call them pod for convenience and clarity.\n\n1. **The Board**\n\n>⚠️ Any member of the General Assembly Pod may become a member of the Board Pod, provided that they are elected as such during one of the General Assembly meetings.\n\nThe Board Pod is the executive layer of the association. It is responsible for day-to-day execution of the community proposals and is initially composed of the three founding members of the association (Cyphr, DeFi Beats, Ze_Boubs). The Board Pod tasks and duties are :\n\n- represent the Association in public\n- prepare, organize, execute General Assembly meetings\n- dismiss a contracted contributor\n- secretary tasks : daily accounting, keep track of the association events, prepare budget and annual accounts\n- execute decisions taken by the DAO and its members, as long as they are decisions related to the fulfillment of the purpose of the Association.\n- manage the DAO assets\n\n2. **The General Assembly**\n\n>⚠️ Any natural person or legal entity may become a member of the General Assembly, as long as they provide their **name, address, and email (these informations won’t be disclosed publicly)** before 10 days of the General Assembly meetings. Application for membership must be made in writing to the Board Secretary (Ze_Boubs).\n\nIn front of the Swiss Law, The General Assembly is the supreme organ of the association. The General Assembly ordinary meeting is organized by the Board Secretary at least once a year with a 30 days notice, but if >10% of members vote in favor of an extraordinary assembly it will take place at the specified date with a 10 days notice. The General Assembly tasks and duties are :\n\n- elect, monitor and dismiss of the members of the Board\n- accept the Association's budget and annual accounts\n- dismiss a contracted contributor\n- grant discharge to the Board Pod\n- determine the members contribution\n- pass resolutions on the adoption and amendment of the Articles of Association, including the Standard Governance Process\n- pass resolutions on the dissolution of the gmDAO Association\n- passing resolutions on matters reserved to it by law or by the Articles of Association or submitted to it by the Board.\n\n>🗳️ Each member of the General Assembly has one vote at the General Assembly meetings. The General Assembly meetings shall pass resolutions and carry out elections by a majority of one vote more than half of the members present, unless otherwise provided by law.\nThe same applies for the extraordinary Assembly meetings.\nEvery member is responsible to gain the technological knowhow to be able to participate on votes on the General Assembly : it can be held in person, in hybrid forms of participation (i.e. via Skype, phone, Slack and others) or even digital forms are explicitly possible. The Board monitors the proper democratic decision-making process of members, which are not participating in person.\n\n3. The DAO members community\n\nEvery on-chain token holder is also a member of the gmDAO Members Community. The voting process of the Member Community is digital and blockchain-based. Token holders don’t need to disclose their identity in order to vote. \nThe detailed rules and procedures for votes by the Member Community are detailed in the Standard Governance Process.\nThe Board is responsible for executing the DAO members community decisions.\n\n## Governance Rules\n\nThe gmDAO is ruled by a list of rules that apply no matter what. In no case can these rules be bypassed for any reason. If it comes to a payout that is in a rush, we recommend the author to pay for it upfront and try to be compensated later. Please notice no payment is guaranteed as long as the dao didn’t vote for it.\n\nAll Snapshot proposals are voted by gmDAO token holders. All choices are encrypted and only visible once the voting period is over.Proposals that are passed are executed by the Gnosis multisig (mainnet: 0xe1a4cb40A1D672Bb7901b646Bb18Eb7B70BD5952).\n\nThe gmDAO multisig signers have committed to executing the will of the gmDAO. This includes all decisions which stem from the Standard Gsovernance Process.\n\n1. **Types of proposal**\n\n![Capture d’écran 2023-03-18 à 09.45.26.png](ipfs://bafkreid6t37b7wej7bqq7hxwsss6sarsvaciyn53hik273eaphxubslake)\n\n2.**Voting systems**\n\n>Several voting systems are available for proposal authors. Only the basic vote is accepted as a definitive result. Example : Say we’re voting to change the name of gmDAO. The author should cast two different votes : a Ranked Choice Voting or a Weighted Vote to “vote on what name fits the most”, then a basic vote on “should we change the gm.dao name ?”.\n \n![Capture d’écran 2023-03-18 à 09.45.26.png](ipfs://bafkreid6t37b7wej7bqq7hxwsss6sarsvaciyn53hik273eaphxubslake)\n\n3. **Standard Governance Process**\n\n>Should the DAO use another tool suite for Governance, the tool suite would need to have similar features, including a discussion space, with a specific “Proposal” category. The tool must offer a token-gated experience, temp-checking functionalities such as off-chain polls, moderation tools such as threads-locks.\n\n![Capture d’écran 2023-03-18 à 09.49.01.png](ipfs://bafkreigfah5z3e7quwivnqecfeuopq3wrsqnvifkztaw5fzlcf5j6iunvm)\n\n \n![Capture d’écran 2023-03-18 à 09.49.54.png](ipfs://bafkreigdjexh6zvyar6yzqj4w2avgxzvdy54jsygoottrq5bl353tz3tby)\n\n4.**Note on workgroup creation**\n\nIn the case where members decide to take over a workgroup lead, they’ll have to put up a proposal following the @Workgroup Creation Template in order to request usage of the gmDAO brand and clarify its relationship with the gmDAO community. Typically, the template must include the following :\n\nRationale:\nProvide the rationale behind your proposal. Why is it needed ? What is the vision behind ? How does it align with the DAO vision ?\n\nSpecifics:\nDefine the relationship with the DAO. How do you plan to use the gmDAO brand ? How do you plan to drive back value to the DAO ? \n\nProvide details on execution : basic governance (2/3 threshold ?), organisational and technical constraints, contributors/products involved, constraints and requirements, maintenance.\n\nIf contributors/payouts are involved, specify tasks & duties, wages, hours committed. Provide as many details as possible about each position.\n\n## Dissolution of the DAO\n\nThe dissolution of the Association can be adopted with a majority of 2/3 on a General Assembly or in circumstances provided by law. If the dissolution is decided, the liquidation shall be carried out by the Board with the help of the multi-signers, unless the Association’s General Assembly appoints special liquidators.\n\nThe net assets remaining after payment of all debts and other charges and after settlement of other obligations shall be allocated to a purpose in accordance with the purpose of the Association by resolution of the General Assembly.\nIn the case of a dissolution, token holders are not entitled to receive a % of treasury assets nor any other benefits.\n\n# Pros :\n\nAlign off-chain and on-chain DAO governance.\nAllows us to kickstart applications to the general Assembly. \n\n# Cons :\n\nNone.\n\n# Sponsors :\n\nZe_Boubs\n    \n    \n    \n",

      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nZe_Boubs\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nMarch 6th\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nExtend Ze_Boubs retainer for 8 more months until November 31st 2023.\n\n### **How have you already contributed to the DAO?**\n\nStarted volunteering at early DAO stages: been a mod since late 21. Worked on the creation of the studio discord, and the DAO discord updates. Moderated studio discord / managed contests / made myself available around drop times. Helped ratifying the governance process with the gov team. Shephered dozens of proposals through governance. I’m on retainer since April 22 : made myself some room in my IRL life to be able to endorse a 120 hours/month commitment to the DAO. My tasks were originally described in [GM 9.1 : hire Ze_Boubs as the DAO secretary/CM](https://www.notion.so/GM-9-1-hire-Ze_Boubs-as-the-DAO-secretary-CM-47fd2d05611d42948a3bf255731ec72d). \n\n### **How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward?**\n\nI’d like to perpetuate my retainer into another 6 months, until September 31st 2023.\n\n### **Specifics:**\n\nMy position includes several tasks & duties.\n\nManage Discord community : cover pacific timezone for moderating and admin purposes , handle support and keep resources up to date all year long. Make myself fully available for crunch time around drops. Accompany artists from day 1 to post-drop community interactions on Discord.\n**Additional tasks : Manage [gm.studio](http://gm.studio) instagram account while it’s in-house managed.**\n\nManage DAO community / Secretary tasks: Maintain and promote a vibrant community and its initiatives, create visuals to highlight processes and increase participation. Capture feedback from members and make sure their sentiment is heard. Help to structure the dao into a self-sustainable organization, create effective processes (applications, how to join a work group, how to require funding). Keep track of every community initiative and how it’s going, help members go through the dao processes and accompany them to create work group/request funding. Track important updates/needs across the DAO. Make a quick weekly overall summary to keep members in touch with what is going on, what are the newest community initiatives, how they can contribute.\n**Additional tasks : track General Assembly members applications, organize the General Assembly meetings at least twice a year and more if requested. Write general assembly meetings reports and make it publicly available to members.**\n\nGovernance/side tasks : Ensure funding cycle calendar, DAO Proposal, contributors list and all associated Governance process pages in Notion are up to date. Shepherd proposals through the governance process by watching temperature checks in Discord, publish and alert about Snapshots. Initiate governance process updates when needed.\n\n**Additional tasks : work on switching our DAO governance to our own website/external forum, using a web3 native, token gated forum for DAO governance.**\n\n### **Risks:**\n\nImpact on treasury. Default of my obligations under the terms of the agreed retainer.\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\nFull-time commitment for 120hours/month. 3600$ distributed monthly over a 6-months period, totalizing 21600$. roughly 3,6% of DAO treasury (590000$ at proposal time).\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nCyphr",

Ongoing maintenance & development has subsequently been supported by DAO funding. This presents an unique situation in regards to legal ownership of IP & branding. This proposal seeks to give clarity on the studio ownership & share structure. \n\n### **Specifics**\n\n**Tax & Legal**\n\nAs one of the primary revenue sources for the DAO, the studio must be set up in a way that I can easily declare it’s turn-over, operating costs & profit. Today, this is difficult to achieve given that operating costs are covered by the DAO & all revenue is then sent back to the DAO treasury. This is not optimal when calculating what our net profit is, which is what matters when declaring to tax authorities.\n\nAs a GmbH based in Zug Switzerland, our corporate tax rate would be roughly 8%. \n\n**Structure & ownership**\n\nThe company would be formed under a limited liability partnership (GmbH) in Zug Switzerland.  The requirements of forming an LLC in Switzerland are as follows: \n\n- A limited liability company (GmbH) must have a share capital of at least CHF 20,000. This starting capital would need to be contributed equally according to the final share structure.  **This capital is still owned by the DAO, but held on the studio books.**\n- An authorized person in Switzerland (administrative board / managing director/ authorized signatory) is required. In our case we have opted to an authorized signatory.  Quoted @ CHF 10,000/year via Sielva Management\n- A Swiss Domicile in Zug (we already have this)\n\nProposed board: \n\nExecutive: Cyphr, Willyham, Bhish, \n\nNon executive: CxKoda (advisory), Rich Poole (advisory),  Swiss based authorized signatory (via Sielva Management)\n\nShare structure: \n\n*We are proposing the following share distribution to reflect the initial contributions of team members prior to incorporation & to ensure their continued time investment to the company*\n\nDAO: 85% (CHF 17,000 starting capital) \n\nTeam: 15% (CHF 3,000 starting capital) \n\n**Cost breakdown**\n\nIncorporation fee: Nul (covered by previous proposal)\n\nStarting capital for GmbH: CHF 20,000\n\nAnnual fee for authorised signatory: CHF 10,000 / year\n\nBoard & company insurance: Est. CHF 2-3000 / year \n\nMisc. expenses (opening bank account etc): CHF 1-2000 \n\n**Total: CHF 35,000 / $ 38,000**",

      "title": "GM 52.1: gm.studio funding for 2 months",
      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nWillyham & DeFi Beats\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nFebruary 2 2023\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThis proposal aims to cover funding for the studio from February - March. \n\n**A note on things in flux.**\n\nThe DAO is currently pursuing legal advice on how to best incorporate the studio as a company. Whilst this is still in flux, we are anticipating a change where all proceeds from studio efforts (e.g. primary/secondary revenue from NFT sales) would go to the studio company. We’d then deduct costs and donate the profits to the DAO to be used for other projects on a regular cadence. \n\nIf we do end up with that structure, this proposal will most likely be superseded by those changes, and we’ll clarify and vote on those changes where necessary. When reading this proposal, please interpret the funding requested as:\n\n1. The maximum that the DAO will allocate to the studio if nothing changes\n2. and the minimum that the studio is likely to spend if things *do* change.\n\nExpect that we’ll use this same proposal in 2 months time to continue funding in the same manner.\n\n**Funding cadence**\n\nThe proposal covers 2 months of costs, but we will not request the total funds in one transaction. In order to stay flexible, we will compute our costs and request that money from the DAO on a monthly basis. This allows us to have more flexibility and to only ask for money that we need. For example, in the event of us lowering the amount of work that we will do, the DAO will retain the excess funds.\n\n**Core team salaries**\n\nWe have recently undertaken a significant amount of work with the latest drops to support delegation, new phases (i.e. collector phase), increased anti-bot work, and new design features for the website. We will continue to develop many of these things, as well as work to improve the website drastically going forwards with the help of a professional designer (Swillis). To account for the realities of the time being spent, this proposal doubles the number of paid hours for Willyham.\n\nAnother update is that we have relatively little contract work to do, so we are replacing the majority of those hours with design time.\n****\n\n<aside>\n💡 We ask that the DAO understands that we may need some flexibility in how we allocate money and spend time. For that reason, we continue to outline rates and expected hours, but reserve the right to allocate those hours internally at Willyham’s discretion. For example, we may need more web based work rather than contract work for a given month, so we’d allocate more hours for the web engineers.\n\n</aside>\n\nWe will maintain our existing rates for time spent:\n\n- Senior Developer = $125/hr\n- Non-senior Developer = $65/hr\n\nWe’ll maintain the existing core team. As a guideline, these are the hours that we have previously allocated:\n\n- Willyham (senior) : 20 hours/week = 80 hours = 10,000 USDC\n- Bhosh (senior): 10 hours/week = 40 hours = 5,000 USDC\n- Swillis (senior): 5 hours/week = 20 hours = 2,500 USDC\n- cxkoda(senior): = 1 hours/week = 5 hours = 500 USDC\n\n**Other costs**\n\nIn practice we have found that we sometimes need to bring other people in to help with specific tasks. Whilst we can’t predict these too far in advance, we’d like to reserve the right to pay up to $2500/month for outside help. This is equivalent to 5 hours/week of a senior engineer or ~10 hours/week for a less senior engineer. If there was no need for using this time in a specific month, we would not include it in the payment between the dao and the studio wallets.\n\n**Infrastructure costs**\n\nFunding for infrastructure is variable and slightly complex. As we use many tools which all have different billing cycles, it’s quite hard to get an exact amount that we’ll need in advance. For this reason I propose that we have a maximum allocation of $2000 and a minimum allocation of $1000. We’ll send $1000 month to our infrastructure credit card to cover existing spending. If our costs change substantially, we are able to request up to $1000 more per month without another proposal.\n\n**Promotion**, **Incentive schemes and other costs**\n\nIn the past we have used contractors to produce promotional materials such as videos for marketing our releases. We expect this to continue and would like to reserve up to $2000/month to fund this.\n\nWe anticipate a month cost for carbon offsetting of around $250.\n\nWe will continue our tradition of allocating 0.5 Eth to each core team member who is present for the day of the drop. In practice we have found that a release requires us to be online consistently for the duration of the drop (and afterwards), which can be ~10-12 hours of time. Allocating 0.5 Eth is significantly cheaper than paying for those hours.\n\nAdditionally, we wish to allocate some potential funds towards incentive schemes to attract artists to the platform. For example, we may want to pay a referral bonus to anyone who introduces us to an artist that has a collection accepted by our curation panel. There may also be other mechanisms which we choose to use and these would be at the core team’s discretion. We are requesting a maximum of $1000/m for this.\n\n**Summary of spend**\n\nAs the spending is slightly flexible. we will outline the overall minimum and maximum spend. In reality we are likely to always have something in between.\n\n \n![Capture d’écran 2023-02-12 à 11.59.42.png](ipfs://bafkreid4lgqs6mrowhbq7fzxoubim42rgekiuc7c5ay5ax6oaoj5xm2bri)\n    \n### **Sponsors:**\n\nDefi Beats, Willyham",

      "content": "# **Author.**\n\nZe_Boubs\n\n## **Summary/Abstract/Motivation**\n\n“Our primary goal is to foster & encourage the development of the NFT space”\n\nAs the gmDAO, gm.studio, & our other initiatives continue to expand and deploy content it is vital to pursue a writing/editorial team responsible for keeping members informed/engaged, promoting our work & mission outside of our group, and establishing ourselves as leaders in the DAO & generative art communities.\n\n1. Extending the [gm.press](http://gm.press/) branch funding.\n2. A pre-approved budget for commissioned graphic works.\n\n### **1. Rationale**\n\n**The Editorial Committee shall be responsible for allocating funds from a monthly budget to writings/media/graphic works that are of interest & value to our community + a general audience.**\n\nThis committee aims to establish an editorial structure to filter submissions and commission content, and evaluate whether a given work is relevant and of sufficient quality to be featured on our channels. As well as any community member is welcome to share thoughts/point of views about the editorial content, the committee shall exercise final say over the content published across our official platforms.\n\n⚠️ ***Participation on the Committee is not a paid role.***\n\n### **2. Specifics.**\n\nWritten work (including articles, collection landing page, etc) will be read and analyzed by the committee under multiple criteria : **relevance - complexity(research component, interview component, time required,etc) - writing quality**. The committee reserves the right to refuse / delay any work for specific reasons and the author must be aware that reasonable edits/modification might be requested by the committee prior to publication. Any such edits will not result in additional fees paid to the writer. Right now, the committee is made up of seven volunteers : Wes, Cyphr, Ze_Boubs, Ignoramus, Speeps, Maths Town and Yorks. As time goes on, we'll hopefully include or dismiss volunteers, based on a vote from the current committee. Committee’s mode of operation will be specified and amended if needed.\n\n**Writing rates :**The committee will use these rates as a basis cost with words threshold, it can add a complexity factor up to 40% after analysis and deliberation with committee members. The committee is voting on 2 specific questions : “Do we accept this submission?” and “What is the difficulty factor ?”. The difficulty factor is a weighted vote. \n\n*Classic article ⇒ x < 500 words : 250$ Medium article ⇒ 500 < x < 1000 words :  500$ Long article ⇒ x > 1000 words : 700$*\n\n**Graphic work/Twitter Space :**\n\n*The committee can vote on commissioning graphic works and/or Twitter spaces for specific purposes.Rates : Graphic work : 40$/hour. Twitter Space : 400$/hour.*\n\n*The committee shall vote on “Should we commission X hours at 40$/hour of graphic works from A ?” or “Should we approve a Twitter space from A on a topic X?”*\n\n### **3. Pre-approved contributors.**\n\nGiven the past work of these individuals, we’d like to pre-approve some of their future works.\n\n**Graphic designer (Speeps) :**\n\nCreated graphic visuals for gm.studio, gm.erch, gm.dao workgroups (medium, docs, deck, marketing).\n\n**⇒ 40$/hr, up to 20 hours/month.**\n\n**Studio Spaces/Interviews (Wes)**\n\nAll but one of our studio spaces have been hosted by Wes Hazard (0x_wes) who is a professional emcee and television presenter with extensive experience with hosting, interviewing, booking, & research. In addition to smoothly guiding the conversation & Q&As during the live spaces he has conducted extensive pre-interviews with all artists for the previous drops and prepared a basic agenda for the spaces. We want to pre-approve up to one monthly twitter spaces including one per studio drops\n\n**⇒ 400$/Twitter Space, up to 2/month**\n\n## **Breakdown of costs.**\n\n### **Monthly funding for 6 months starting February.**\n\nBased on rates above, we require a 4100$ monthly budget that doesn’t roll over if unspent.\n\nA specific multisig wallet (0x195143A5001ac3bfd640F54c383bFa9Bc4ecFc78) is used where funds are deposited. Funds don’t roll over into the next month. The committee will ensure that money spent by the press branch isn’t over allocated.\n\n## **Risks.**\n\nImpact on the treasury.\n\n## **Sponsors.**\n\nWes Hazard, Speeps, Ze_Boubs",

      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nDiagonal, OTM\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\n18/01/23\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nProposal to fund the gm.Tezos working group to develop a curation platform on fxhash —cost estimated to be around $10,000.\n\n### **Rationale:**\n\nThe Tezos gen art community is one of the strongest in the web3 space, and includes many Dao members as active participants. It features some of the best artists (both established and up and coming) and some of the most fervent collectors, and has seen considerable growth in the last 12 months. Because of lower costs and an open-minded body of collectors, Tezos is better able to foster smaller collections and more unique styles, as well as rapid iteration. In its current state, however, the gen art ecosystem on Tezos clearly needs curated spaces given the sheer number of drops on a daily basis. At present, Tender is perhaps the only organisation that provides this to any significant extent. This affords gmDAO a great opportunity to use our expertise, and the brand awareness created by the studio, to set up our own curated platform – gm.Tezos.\n\nSetting up a platform on Tez would complement the Studio in a number of ways:\n1)By providing a set of more frequent (though lower profile) drops, it will keep the gm brand in the public consciousness during gaps between studio drops, which can sometimes be extended.\n2) It would help bridge the collector communities between ETH and Tez, both by bringing Eth collectors to Tez, and by raising the profile of our Eth drops for Tez-focused collectors.\n3) It would give us the flexibility to seek out up and coming artists that may ultimately want to drop with the main studio as their careers progress.\n4) It would allow us to entertain smaller and/or more experimental drops that might not be economic on Eth, as well as collections that could not be put on chain. (IPFS is the norm on Tezos).\n\n### **Specifics:**\n\nThe gm.Tezos Working Group is intended to create a curation platform on the Tezos blockchain.\n\nOur intention is to launch gm.Tezos as a standalone website that sits on top of fxhash —similar in many ways to how Tender functions. A rough analogy might be to see gm.Tezos as a record label, and fxhash as iTunes/Spotify… We do not believe that launching a competitor to fxhash is necessary or desirable. It would take a significantly higher investment that would be hard to recoup and it would fragment the Tezos space at a time when collectors are already incredibly hesitant to use platforms outside of fxhash. It would also most likely generate antagonism from a significant proportion of the collector base we would be aiming to appeal to. We believe partnering with fxhash is a better solution for keeping our costs low and engaging with the Tezos collector community. As such, and given that we will not be drawing any kind of salary from this, the launch cost for the project is essentially just that of creating the website, which we estimate to be around $10,000. Ongoing costs will be minimal, and should be easily covered by revenue from primary sales, assuming one moderately successful drop per month.\n\nWith respect to curation, we envisage two principal strategies. First, we plan to capture some of the efficiencies around the existing curation process for the Studio. The curation panel regularly reviews submissions that whilst appealing, aren’t the right fit for the Studio for one reason or another, including the size of the drop it would support or the nature of the submission. However, a significant proportion of these projects would be suitable for a Tez platform. As a result, we plan to allow artists that are submitting to the studio to decide if they would also like to be considered for gm.tezos. This would not add any additional work to the curation panel (there would be no additional reviewing), but instead would piggyback on work we are already doing. Additionally, we will be able tp proactively reach out to artists we would like to work with, since we do not intend to utilize a blind curation process. Additional curatorial work created by these two streams will be performed by OTM and Diagonal, potentially accompanied by others, but the intention is to keep this process streamlined.\n\nOnce a submission is accepted for a gm.tezos launch, the Working Group will work with the artist to refine the collection, provide guidance on drop size, pricing, etc. We will then also promote the collection for the artists here, Tender, and in the fxhash community, and we will help the artist create a write-up on the collection that can be launched as an accompanying fxtext article. These services will be completed on a voluntary basis—no payment from the DAO necessary.\nWith respect to drop mechanics and DAO allocation, this will likely be drop dependent. For a typical collection, we would ideally use a dutch auction method with a small number of reserves raffled off within the DAO, to partner communities like Tender, and potentially the artist's previous collectors. But we could envision a scenario where a drop is sufficiently small that we might not be able to do any reserves (outside of the people that help with the drop). Or an artist might want to do a flat price. Plus, due to the dutch auction drop mechanics on fxhash, significant numbers of reserve spots hurt the mint price and the secondary volume for the piece. Ultimately, the strength of this working group is the ability to be more flexible than gmstudio. So, maintaining that flexibility and entrusting the working group to figure things out as we go is a key component of this proposal.\n\nAs part of this proposal process, we spoke with Cyphr, Rich, and Adam at Tender. All of them provided us with fantastic thoughts and guidance, but all were incredibly supportive. We strongly believe this would be of benefit both to the Dao and the Tezos gen art community. (Pending approval of this initial proposal, we will also discuss the endeavor with the fxhash team).\n\nAt current, we do not believe this will be a significant revenue generator. Assuming a cadence of one drop per month, this process would likely generate around $1,000 per month with a potential to go higher. As a result, we believe the initial investment would likely be paid off in 10 months or less. It is possible that these numbers might significantly increase if the size of the gen art market on Tez continues to grow, and/or crypto prices generally increase, but the viability of the platform would not depend on this. With that said, we do not believe this is likely to be a massive source of revenue for the DAO. But we do believe it will be more than self-sustaining and will provide a number of other benefits as described above.\n\n### **Pros:**\n\nBenefits to the DAO:\n●  \tExpand the reach of our brand to the Tezos community\n●  \tStay in the public consciousness between main studio drops\n●  \tSupport more artists-especially up and coming ones that may ultimately want to drop with the main studio some day\n●  \tAbility to target artists we want to work with, which blind curation does not support\n\nBenefits to artists:\n●  \tPromotion:\n○  \tExisting art collecting community\n○  \t Partnerships with other art collecting communities (Tender)\n○  \tgmDAO is a recognized brand in the art community\n●  \tGuidance during launch:\n○  \t Feedback in refining pieces for launch\n○  \tPricing for DA\n○  \tCollection size\n○  \tPreparing an FxText article for the drop to explain the concept\n●  \tDedicated minting site that will stand out from noise of fxhash and better showcase the collab\n\n### **Cons :**\n\nThere are likely two potential cons, which we believe are significantly mitigated.\n●  \tPotential dilution of gmstudio drops given that they are both under the gmDAO banner. But, we think the fact that it is on a completely different chain will avoid the dilutionary mechanism that Art Blocks for instance has seen at times. It also would not necessarily rely heavily on DAO minters because we do not intend to follow the same allowlist mechanism the studio uses.\n●  \tThe second potential con is there is obviously some risk that the product could hurt the studio’s reputation by being of a lower quality. We will have curation panel members part of this process, so we don’t think this is a significant concern. And, we think the different blockchain and the nature of fxhash avoids this being a major obstacle.\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\nNo funds will be retained by Diagonal or OTM or paid to Diagonal or OTM as part of this proposal. Payout will be made from the treasury to the website creator(s).\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\nAround $10,000. Final amount will be determined once we have finalized a deal to develop the platform.\n\n1.8% of the current treasury ($536,582.31)\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nOTM, Diagonal",

Now that we have incorporated the DAO, we are in a position where we can do business with companies that require an entity to invoice & to pay VAT.\n\nAfter going through a number of different suppliers, we have identified one which meets our quality standards for a reasonable price.\n\nThis proposal seeks to gain funding for 1 free hoodie for each gmDAO member, with an initial estimate of 700 pieces being required.\n\n**Rationale:**\nMerchandise provides members with the ability to represent the DAO proudly both within their social groups & in public events such as conferences and meet-ups.\n\n**Specifics:**\nThe DAO would subsidize at 40% the cost of 1 hoodie per member (not per token). We will also offer members the ability to purchase additional items such as sweaters & t-shirts at their own expense.\n\nDue to the wide distribution of our member base, members would be asked to cover their own shipping costs.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we will give members the opportunity to provide their preferred size with us. Once we’ve gathered this information, we will place the order with +- 10% overhead to accomodate any members that may have missed the window (extra sizes will be ordered based on the normal distribution of the DAO).\n\nSpecifics on the mechanics of the merch drop itself will be announced closer to the date itself.\n\n**Pros:**\nGenerates a sense of comradery within the community\n\nProvides organic marketing for the DAO both on social media & IRL\n\nComfy AF\n\n**Cons :**\nIt’s a large sum of money for something that will not provide tangible benefits to the DAO as a whole.\n\n**Payout recipient:**\nMetamade Labs (via wire transfer)\n\n**Payout amount:**\nTotal financial commitment for the DAO, in USD amount and % of treasury at the time of proposal.\n\n700x premium hoodie: 100% organic cotton\n\nEmbroidery of 'gm' logo\n\nPackaging materials & order fulfillment\nManaging production process with supplier\n\n40% x € 38.500,00 (ex.

      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nZe_Boubs\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\n*1.2.23*\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nProposal to use 3 community tokens for smart marketing purpose, gradually throughout the year 2023.\n\n### **Rationale:**\n\nWhile being a token gated community is what slowly allowed us to create a healthy environment for our members, the downside is that we lack visibility in a more than ever attention economy. While we don’t want to focus on overhyping and attracting speculative fomoers, the more vocal and the more we increase our presence in the space, the more likely we are to onboard like-minded brilliant people who had never heard of us before.\n\n### **Specifics:**\n\nWe’ll use 3 community tokens in 3 very different ways :\n\n- Token 1 : He’ll be sent to a fresh wallet, and his private key will be hidden in a big treasure hunt, involving multiple hints disseminated in historically relevant parts of the gmdao : might involve tokens, transaction hashes, modified metadata, website back-end, anything that will potentially arouse curiosity around our ecosystem. The more complex it gets, the more likely it is to be discovered by a smart person.\n- Token 2 : We’ll kickstart a pitch competition, open to members and non-members. the idea is we want people to pitch a potential revenue-generating initiative the dao could fund. Competition runs for 3 months, dao members get to vote on the best pitch. Winner gets the community token.\n\n### **Pros:**\n\nIncreased visibility on all socials, across artists, collectors, builders. These are more than basic engagement farming posts, which is more likely to bring smart eyes on us. Storytelling is a big thing in crypto and people LOVE treasure hunts, especially when it involves digging into the blockchain. Potential new ideas for revenue generating initiatives + onboard smart minds. It also brings a lot of topics that can be marketed in the soon-to-be weekly spaces and podcasts.\n\n### **Cons :**\n\nBiggest con i can see is people would eventually get the token and sell it right after. But is that even bad if it gets sold to someone that heard of us through the operation.\n\n### **Details :**\n\nHiding the token should be handled by 2 trusted person. I nominate myself and cyphr to get in charge. Running and spreading words about the competitions would be handled by part/full time employees so no extra cost for the DAO.\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\n2 treasury-owned community tokens. Market value : around 12-15k$\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n*Ze_Boubs*",

      "title": "GM48.2 : Retainer amendment and extension for Dirty as Collab Manager",
      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nDirty\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\n03/01/2023\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThis is a proposal to amend and extend a_dirty_boy's retainer as a collab manager for 60 hours per month (an increase of 20 hours) at $30 per hour for a duration of 3 months from January 19th 2023.\n\nIt also includes a request for a monthly payment of $60 to cover the new Alphabot paid subscription costs.\n\n### **Rationale:**\n\n**How have I already contributed to the DAO?**\n\nI’ve been an active member since November 2021, a Multisignatory since May 2022 and a Mod since July 2022; I’ve volunteered a lot of my time to gmDAO projects, drafting proposals, arranging both inbound and outbound collabs, following up on leads referred by members, building relationships with external projects and creators, creating competitions and more general project outreach.\n\nI’ve created a system to keep track of inbound and outbound collab requests, referrals, contacts, competitions and results using a combination of google forms and sheets. I’ve increased security by using specific wallets and discord profiles for use when visiting project websites and joining project servers. I’ve implemented project account ownership verification on twitter via the @gmDAOcollab account.\n\nI’ve grown and maintained a network of both resident and freelance collab managers.\n\n**More information on my current role**\n\nI currently spend more 80 hours per month either on calls or in discussions via DM/Twitter with projects and collab managers, assessing and filtering individual projects and creating competitions for gmDAO members alongside working a full-time position.\n\nAlthough I routinely exceed 80 hours per month I'm also aware that we are currently in the middle of a bear market which is why I've capped my paid hours in this proposal at 60 per month until the work I do provides more value for gmDAO members.\n\n**Subscription costs for Alphabot**\n\nAlphabot will be switching to a paid subscription model on January 7th 2023. The monthly cost to be able to create and post giveaways using their service is $60.00. I appreciate that this is an extra and unexpected expense but I believe that the extra cost is worth the investment due to the ease of use for both myself and competition entrants.\n\nAlthough we have a Premint Creators Pass they do not yet offer features such as mint calendars for competition winners unless they have the Premit Collectors Pass. Furthermore, the Creator Pass is non-transferrable which creates a bottleneck when it comes to creating competition pages as I have to request Cyphr to create the templates in batches manually. \n\n**How does arranging collabs and project outreach currently provide value to gmDAO?**\n\nArranging AL collabs provides value to gmDAO members in a number of ways:\n\n- **Time saved** - The time that I spend arranging the AL collabs is time that members don’t have to spend to get themselves allowlisted individually.\n- **Guaranteed spots or increased odds** - I always aim for our allocations to be in excess of the average number of competition entries for the giveaways. In cases where this is not possible; entrants have vastly better odds at securing spots through the gmDAO giveaways vs external giveaways.\n- **Financial gain -** Although gains can’t be guaranteed I want members to be in a position to mint and take profits on successful, allowlisted collections wherever possible.\n- **Expanding our network -** Our collab opportunities grow as our network expands\n\nThe above does not generate income for the DAO treasury. It is aimed squarely at providing value to our token holders.\n\n### **Specifics:**\n\n**How do I want to contribute to the DAO going forward?**\n\nI want to be able to continue with my current collab management tasks, refine and streamline the processes to allow for more volume and to dedicate more time to networking with other projects/collab managers. I also want to simplify the entry process for members so that they don’t miss AL opportunities. I aim to continue providing value to our members through time saved, increased exposure to new projects and potential financial gain.\n\n### Risks**:**\n\nImpact on treasury. Default of my obligations under the terms of the agreed retainer.\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\na_dirty_boy - 0x9df5388d04A02a96eb917056A94C192129E982e5\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\n$30 per hour for 60 hours per month over 3 months. I’ve based this rate on the current DAO rate for Ze_Boubs which is at the bottom end of the scale. It is also in line with my current employer's standard overtime rate of £26.20 per hour. Matching this rate gives me the freedom to lower the amount of overtime I have to commit to other work to stay financially secure while allowing me to dedicate more time to working for gmDAO.\n\n180 Hours total @ $30 per hour - $5,400\n3 months Alphabot subscription @ $60 pcm - $180\n\nTotal payment over 3 months - $5,580\n\n1.14% of the current treasury ($489,305)\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n*Ze_Boubs*",

      "title": "GM 46.1 : Hire calbear.eth as Community Engagement Manager",
      "content": "### **Author:**\n\ncalbear.eth\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nDecember 23, 2022\n\n### **Summary**\n\nIn addition to being a governance token and the benefits conveyed from projects launched by the DAO (such as gm.studio whitelisting), many would argue that community is one of the strongest value propositions of holding a gmDAO token. Members benefit from a shared sense of belonging, the network of the DAO members, education, outreach, promotion, and more. The problem is that we as a DAO have never created a formal structure for conveying that value proposition internally, or to the public at large. Having an employed person geared toward this effort can shift the false perception that a gmDAO token is solely a mint pass for gm.studio and highlight the community as a core strength.\n\nProposal: Hire Brandon Harvey, aka calbear.eth, as Community Engagement Manager for gmDAO as per the terms below.\n\nPayment: 3 month retainer, 120 hours/month at $40 per hour rate\n\nTasks & Duties:\n\n- Members Spaces: Create content for, promote, and host a weekly Spaces from the gmDAO Twitter including guest speaker members, founders, and communities. Open to the public.\n- Product and Security Education AMAs: Host a weekly Infosession/AMA in the Discord to inform members of products, security, and other relevant topics. When possible, get members in early for product beta testing and feedback loops.\n- NFT Project AMAs: Host founders and project leads for AMAs in the Discord to meaningfully describe their projects. This would complement the work of the Collaboration Manager.\n- Partnerships: Use the gmDAO Twitter account for outreach and realization of DAO partnerships, including but not limited to product access, platforms and events. Form long-term relationships in order to introduce gmDAO and our products to other communities and expand member networking opportunities. Attend joint AMAs/Spaces, and create distributable content for collaborations.\n- Promotion: Create and share tasteful social media threads and content for gmDAO and our products directly from the gmDAO Twitter account, and engage community members through calls to action.\n- Events: Upon DAO approval for travel/accommodation funding, attend in-person events as a presence representing gmDAO. Coordinate itineraries, accommodations, reservations, etc for DAO member meetups.\n- Evaluating Success Metrics: Tracking KPIs over retainer period to share with the DAO.\n\n*Important note: Some of these proposed functions may overlap with existing DAO employees, however they will not impede or overstep those functions.\n\nEstimated hourly breakdown across these responsibilities are as follows:\n\n- Content: 5 hours per week\n- Promotion: 8 hours per week\n- Outreach: 5 hours per week\n- Spaces: 2 hours per week\n- Discord Infosession/AMA: 3 hours per week\n- Partnership coordination: 5 hours per week\n- Tracking KPIs: 2 hours per week\n\n*Note: Some of these hours overlap amongst tasks and duties\n\nNon-exhaustive list of metrics the Community Engagement Manager will track to help measure impact of the role:\n\n- Direct: community polling, feedback channel, member success stories\n- Twitter: followers, average views/comments per post\n- Spaces/Discord AMAs: live listeners, recording listeners, member speakers, partner attendance\n- Partnerships: contacts, in-discussion, inked, promoted\n\n### **Risks:**\n\nImpact on the treasury.\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\n3 month retainer, 120 hours/month at $40 per hour rate\n\n### **How have you already contributed to the DAO?**\n\nI have been a constant contributor to the DAO since very early. Many of the tasks in this proposal are tasks that I have taken on voluntarily, and which I believe have already proven valuable to members. In addition, I have contributed to discussions on business development, DAO incorporation, several proposals, and ideation of working groups. I would hope it is apparent, but my devotion to the DAO is strong and enduring.\n\n### **How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?****\n\nThere is no organization that I would like to help build more than gmDAO. I am always impressed by how far we’ve come, but always believe there is more to be done. I would like to continue ideating new work groups for additional revenue sources, building on network avenues for members to succeed, and mostly, fostering the unique environment of the gmDAO community.\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nCyphr, ZeBoubs, Dirty",

      "title": "GM 43.1: gm.studio funding for 2 months",
      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nWillyham & DeFi Beats\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nNovember 16 2022\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThis proposal aims to cover funding for the studio from December 1st to January 31st\n\n**Incorporation Changes**\n\nWe will request funding as normal whilst the DAO/studio incorporation progress is on-going. The vote for that issue may superceed this one, in which case the funding here would not be needed if alternative arrangements were made.\n\n**Funding cadence**\n\nThe proposal covers 2 months of costs, but we will not request the total funds in one transaction. In order to stay flexible, we will compute our costs and request that money from the DAO on a monthly basis. This allows us to have more flexibility and to only ask for money that we need. For example, in the event of us lowering the amount of work that we will do, the DAO will retain the excess funds.\n\n**Core team salaries**\n\nIt is very difficult to estimate how much work we’ll need to do over the coming months. To keep things simple, we will assume that our costs will be similar to previous funding cycles, up until the the incorporation of the studio. This is effectively the minimum that we can spend to ensure that we’re able to maintain the existing studio product.\n\n\nHowever, we ask that the DAO understands that we may need some flexibility in how we allocate money and spend time. For that reason, we continue to outline rates and expected hours, but reserve the right to allocate those hours internally at Willyham’s discretion. For example, we may need more web based work rather than contract work for a given month, so we’d allocate more hours for the web engineers.\n\nWe will maintain our existing rates for time spent:\n\n- Senior Developer = $125/hr\n- Non-senior Developer = $65/hr\n\nWe’ll maintain the existing core team. As a guideline, these are the hours that we have previously allocated:\n\n- Willyham (senior) : 10 hours/week = 40 hours = 5,000 USDC\n- Bhosh (senior): 10 hours/week = 40 hours = 5,000 USDC\n- cxkoda(senior): = 5 hours/week = 20 hours = 2,500 USDC\n\n**Other costs**\n\nIn practice we have found that we sometimes need to bring other people in to help with specific tasks. Whilst we can’t predict these too far in advance, we’d like to reserve the right to pay up to $2500/month for outside help. This is equivalent to 5 hours/week of a senior engineer or ~10 hours/week for a less senior engineer. If there was no need for using this time in a specific month, we would not include it in the payment between the dao and the studio wallets.\n\n**Infrastructure costs**\n\nFunding for infrastructure is variable and slightly complex. As we use many tools which all have different billing cycles, it’s quite hard to get an exact amount that we’ll need in advance. For this reason I propose that we have a maximum allocation of $2000 and a minimum allocation of $1000. We’ll send $1000 month to our infrastructure credit card to cover existing spending. If our costs change substantially, we are able to request up to $1000 more per month without another proposal.\n\n**Promotion**, **Incentive schemes and other costs**\n\nIn the past we have used contractors to produce promotional materials such as videos for marketing our releases. We expect this to continue and would like to reserve up to $2000/month to fund this.\n\nWe anticipate a month cost for carbon offsetting of around $250.\n\nWe will continue our tradition of allocating 0.5 Eth to each core team member who is present for the day of the drop. In practice we have found that a release requires us to be online consistently for the duration of the drop (and afterwards), which can be ~10-12 hours of time. Allocating 0.5 Eth is significantly cheaper than paying for those hours.\n\nAdditionally, we wish to allocate some potential funds towards incentive schemes to attract artists to the platform. For example, we may want to pay a referral bonus to anyone who introduces us to an artist that has a collection accepted by our curation panel. There may also be other mechanisms which we choose to use and these would be at the core team’s discretion. We are requesting a maximum of $1000/m for this.\n\n**Summary of spend**\n\nAs the spending is slightly flexible. we will outline the overall minimum and maximum spend. In reality we are likely to always have something in between.\n \n![Capture d’écran 2022-11-28 à 10.14.26.png](ipfs://bafkreify7rloz4ono7ycuzrjqfefu43v6bomeu6chtt32he76bqohlimme)\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nDefi Beats, Willyham\n    ",

      "title": "GM 42.1 : gmDAO association",
      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nCyphr\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nNovember 16th 2022\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nCopy of Articles of Association : https://drive.google.com/file/d/15LfWosgbLC_WCUOtcEmzpZVDjwDmIKOo/view\nRecording of meeting with Lorenz Legal covering the Articles of Association : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SckkcZn1doU-32fLk7fZVG2DNdybm2Ew/view\nFollow-up call with Lorenz Legal : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d_bNgDxrNxQUWPTGjNcUrYp8289uI2Rc/view\n\nAs the DAO looks to expand it’s purpose through the creation of revenue generating products, we must ensure that we are protected from a legal, compliance & tax perspective. Given the primary goal of a DAO is to provide a novel organisational structure without traditional hierarchies, our incorporation must respect these values as much as the legal system allows.  The objective of the Association is to establish a decentralized and democratic association with flat hierarchies. Therefore, the Association Board will have only those competences, which actually require the action of an individual, natural person, such as representation duties or the duty to keep the books\n\nAfter a thorough analysis from our legal partners at Lorenz Legal, we have been given the recommendation to incorporate under Swiss law as an association. This would afford us both individual indemnity against financial liabilities (personal liability of the Association’s Board members can be limited to cases of gross negligence & the assets of the association are solely liable for the obligations of the association), as well as a fairly advantageous tax bracket as a Non-Profit.\n\nThe Association organs are the following:\n\n- Association Member Community (“Member Community”)\n- General Assembly of Members (“General Assembly”) (Mitgliederversammlung)\n- Association Board of Directors (“Board”) (Vorstand)\n\n![Capture d’écran 2022-12-03 à 19.14.39.png](ipfs://bafkreiecajmx2vmf3uobrvtrznurwattcoc6oq6n2rdakefkbfpjxlx5pq)\n\n**Member community:** \n\nConsists of all gm.token holders. The Association Member Community shall be the body, which decides on the proposals. Every member of the Association is also part of the Member Community, which provides a blockchain-based technical infrastructure to efficiently, democratically and transparently propose and vote (i.e Snapshot). \n\nThe detailed rules and procedures for voting within the Member Community are detailed in a separate document (our current Governance Process) to be adopted by the General Assembly. Therefore, the General Assembly is the only organ able to amend the Governance Process.\n\n**General Assembly** \n\nThe General Assembly is the supreme body of the Association. It is responsible in particular for:\n\n1. election and dismissal of the members of the Board;\n2. election of the President of the Board;\n3. election of the auditors (if any);\n4. acceptance of the Association's accounts;\n5. granting of discharge to the Board of Directors;\n6. determination of the contributions to be paid by the members;\n7. passing resolutions on the adoption and amendment of the Articles of Association;\n8. decisions on appeals against exclusion decisions of the Board;\n9. resolutions on the dissolution of the Association;\n10. passing resolutions on matters reserved to it by law or by the Articles of Association or submitted to it by the Board.\n\n**The Association Board**\n\nThe Board consists of at least three members. The Board constitutes itself with the exception of the President, who is elected by the General Assembly. In the event of a deadlock situation, the President shall have the casting vote.\n\nThe competencies and duties of the Board include in particular:\n\n- Representing the Association to the public;\n- Preparation of the General Assembly;\n- Execution of the resolutions of the General Assembly;\n- Decision on the admission and possible exclusion of members of the Association;\n- Handling of suggestions, applications and complaints of the members of the Association;\n- Preparation of the budget and annual accounts;\n- Management of the Association's assets;\n- Appointing the informal Board of Advisors (if applicable);\n- Activities related to the fulfillment of the purpose of the Association.\n\nIn addition, the Board shall have all other powers not expressly reserved by law or the Articles of Association to another body of the Association.\n\n### **What we’re voting on ?:**\n\nTo finalize the incorporation, we must have 3 founding members to sign the articles of association, as well as be present during the Association Meeting Minutes.\n\nOur proposal would be as follows: \n\nPresident: Cyphr\n\nTreasury: DeFi Beats\n\nSecretary: Ze_Boubs\n\nOnce the DAO has had time to review the Articles of Association & provide changes/feedback, the vote will be to decide whether to proceed with the incorporation with the board suggestion above.\n\n    ",

      "title": "GM37.1 Create gm.consulting working group",
      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nDigit\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nOctober 22, 2022\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThis is a proposal to start a new working group within gmDAO called gm.consulting. The purpose of gm.consulting will be to provide web3 consulting services to entities looking to enter the web3 space as well as to existing web3 brands looking to outsource some efforts. Leveraging the experience of DAO members, gm.consulting aims to provide strategy as well as execution in areas like nft project development, web3 marketing, community building, art curation, collection development, smart contract development and more.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nOver the past year plus in the DAO we’ve seen a number of people come and go however one constant has been the desire of many members to transition professionally into a web3 career. A number of members have successfully done so while others are still looking for the right opportunity.\n\ngm.consulting aims to give DAO members a chance to work on web3 projects in a freelance manner while gaining experience, receiving compensation and growing their personal networks. The idea came about after both of us completed a few proof of concept freelance projects and were exposed to the quality of work from traditional agencies bidding on web3 work. We believe there is a real gap in web3 consulting - firms either don’t have the knowledge/experience in the space or those that do charge a very large amount for their services. Building upon the gmDAO brand and members, we believe gm.consulting can offer a strong alternative and return value to project contributors and the broader DAO membership.\n\n### **Operational Specifics:**\n\ngm.consulting will be managed by a core team who will oversee all operations. The core team will focus on business development, negotiations, project management and other day to day operations. The core team will be responsible to manage all gm.consulting funds which will be controlled via a multisig wallet.\n\nAll key decisions will be taken by the core team via vote - this will not be on-chain, a simple vote/discussion within Discord will be taken. The founding core team will be made up of Nemo and Digit at launch, however we will aim to bring on additional members as operations grow - ideally we get to an odd number to avoid stalemates in decisions. Any new core team member will be added to the multisig and have the same voting rights as the founding core team. The addition or removal of a core member will be decided by vote and like other core team decisions will require a majority to pass.\n\nMuch like with gm.studio, we intend for a large portion of the conversations/discussions around gm.consulting strategy, structure, proposals to be in the open within a working group discord channel. However once a project is approved by a client, that work will shift to a private group for only those involved.\n\nWhen an opportunity presents itself the core team will review the details and build a proposal to submit to the prospect using a team made up of the roster of talent. Any DAO member or non-DAO member will be eligible to join the roster of talent and each proposal will be made up of its own project team selected by the core team. As a general rule of thumb, DAO members will be given first consideration for any project roles however gm.consulting is not bound to only using DAO members. The gm.consulting roster of talent will extend beyond just DAO members in order to ensure a wide spread of experience, availability and rates.\n\nThe final proposal submitted to a prospect will always include:\n\n- General scope of work and timeline\n- Fixed bid cost\n- Standard legal terms\n\nThe project cost will be built out by the core team using our internal rate card based on the talent assigned. Each project will have a 10-20% mark-up and those funds will be split evenly between the gmDAO treasury and the gm.consulting treasury.\n\nFor the time being the intention is to bootstrap this group as much as possible. We will rely on free to use services, tools and limit any spend till we have a few successful projects completed and a strong conviction that we can grow the service further.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\n- Build out the roster of talent. If you are interested in participating or know people who might, please complete our form: [https://forms.gle/aRLfSYCUWXAH1G6t8](https://forms.gle/aRLfSYCUWXAH1G6t8)\n- Align on the legal structure and requirements (already on-going as part of the DAO incorporation)\n- Continue to refine the gm.consulting governance model\n- Complete pitch deck\n- Create contract templates and other necessary document templates (eg proposal template)\n- Activate social media accounts, emails, etc\n- Go get some clients!!\n\n### **DAO Member Benefits:**\n\n- New revenue stream for DAO treasury\n- Opportunity for DAO members to benefit by working on projects as talent and earning an hourly rate for their efforts\n- Opportunity for DAO members to benefit by referring work or resources and earning a commission\n- Continue learning and exploring how DAOs can operate\n\n### Risks:\n\n- Reputational risk to the gmDAO brand\n    - eg. should a client rug, gmDAO might be forever linked to that entity\n- Legal risk if client contracts are not properly written/executed\n- Execution risk if members are not able to deliver a final product\n\nShould any of these risks prove to be true, the DAO can revoke permissions and dissolve the working group via a Snapshot vote with a 120 quorum.\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nDigit, Nemo, Ze_Boubs",

      "title": "GM 37.1 - Create gm.consulting working group",
      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nDigit\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nOctober 22, 2022\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThis is a proposal to start a new working group within gmDAO called gm.consulting. The purpose of gm.consulting will be to provide web3 consulting services to entities looking to enter the web3 space as well as to existing web3 brands looking to outsource some efforts. Leveraging the experience of DAO members, gm.consulting aims to provide strategy as well as execution in areas like nft project development, web3 marketing, community building, art curation, collection development, smart contract development and more.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nOver the past year plus in the DAO we’ve seen a number of people come and go however one constant has been the desire of many members to transition professionally into a web3 career. A number of members have successfully done so while others are still looking for the right opportunity.\n\ngm.consulting aims to give DAO members a chance to work on web3 projects in a freelance manner while gaining experience, receiving compensation and growing their personal networks. The idea came about after both of us completed a few proof of concept freelance projects and were exposed to the quality of work from traditional agencies bidding on web3 work. We believe there is a real gap in web3 consulting - firms either don’t have the knowledge/experience in the space or those that do charge a very large amount for their services. Building upon the gmDAO brand and members, we believe gm.consulting can offer a strong alternative and return value to project contributors and the broader DAO membership.\n\n### **Operational Specifics:**\n\ngm.consulting will be managed by a core team who will oversee all operations. The core team will focus on business development, negotiations, project management and other day to day operations. The core team will be responsible to manage all gm.consulting funds which will be controlled via a multisig wallet.\n\nAll key decisions will be taken by the core team via vote - this will not be on-chain, a simple vote/discussion within Discord will be taken. The founding core team will be made up of Nemo and Digit at launch, however we will aim to bring on additional members as operations grow - ideally we get to an odd number to avoid stalemates in decisions. Any new core team member will be added to the multisig and have the same voting rights as the founding core team. The addition or removal of a core member will be decided by vote and like other core team decisions will require a majority to pass.\n\nMuch like with gm.studio, we intend for a large portion of the conversations/discussions around gm.consulting strategy, structure, proposals to be in the open within a working group discord channel. However once a project is approved by a client, that work will shift to a private group for only those involved.\n\nWhen an opportunity presents itself the core team will review the details and build a proposal to submit to the prospect using a team made up of the roster of talent. Any DAO member or non-DAO member will be eligible to join the roster of talent and each proposal will be made up of its own project team selected by the core team. As a general rule of thumb, DAO members will be given first consideration for any project roles however gm.consulting is not bound to only using DAO members. The gm.consulting roster of talent will extend beyond just DAO members in order to ensure a wide spread of experience, availability and rates.\n\nThe final proposal submitted to a prospect will always include:\n\n- General scope of work and timeline\n- Fixed bid cost\n- Standard legal terms\n\nThe project cost will be built out by the core team using our internal rate card based on the talent assigned. Each project will have a 10-20% mark-up and those funds will be split evenly between the gmDAO treasury and the gm.consulting treasury.\n\nFor the time being the intention is to bootstrap this group as much as possible. We will rely on free to use services, tools and limit any spend till we have a few successful projects completed and a strong conviction that we can grow the service further.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\n- Build out the roster of talent. If you are interested in participating or know people who might, please complete our form: [https://forms.gle/aRLfSYCUWXAH1G6t8](https://forms.gle/aRLfSYCUWXAH1G6t8)\n- Align on the legal structure and requirements (already on-going as part of the DAO incorporation)\n- Continue to refine the gm.consulting governance model\n- Complete pitch deck\n- Create contract templates and other necessary document templates (eg proposal template)\n- Activate social media accounts, emails, etc\n- Go get some clients!!\n\n### **DAO Member Benefits:**\n\n- New revenue stream for DAO treasury\n- Opportunity for DAO members to benefit by working on projects as talent and earning an hourly rate for their efforts\n- Opportunity for DAO members to benefit by referring work or resources and earning a commission\n- Continue learning and exploring how DAOs can operate\n\n### Risks:\n\n- Reputational risk to the gmDAO brand\n    - eg. should a client rug, gmDAO might be forever linked to that entity\n- Legal risk if client contracts are not properly written/executed\n- Execution risk if members are not able to deliver a final product\n\nShould any of these risks prove to be true, the DAO can revoke permissions and dissolve the working group via a Snapshot vote with a 120 quorum.\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nDigit, Nemo, Ze_Boubs",

      "title": "GM36.1 - gm.studio funding (10/01-11/30)",
      "content": "**Author:**\nWillyham & DeFi Beats\n\n**Proposal date:**\nOctober 10 2022\n\n**Summary:**\nThis proposal aims to cover funding for the studio from October - November. We intend to change the cadence of funding to remove the overhead of needing to do monthly proposals and retroactive payments. This will give both the DAO and the studio team more certainty and flexibility going forwards.\nA note on things in flux.\nThe DAO is currently pursuing legal advice on how to best incorporate the studio as a company. Whilst this is still in flux, we are anticipating a change where all proceeds from studio efforts (e.g. primary/secondary revenue from NFT sales) would go to the studio company. We’d then deduct costs and donate the profits to the DAO to be used for other projects on a regular cadence.\nIf we do end up with that structure, this proposal will most likely be superseded by those changes, and we’ll clarify and vote on those changes where necessary. When reading this proposal, please interpret the funding requested as:\n1. The maximum that the DAO will allocate to the studio if nothing changes\n2. and the minimum that the studio is likely to spend if things do change.\nExpect that we’ll use this same proposal in 2 months time to continue funding in the same manner.\n\n**Funding cadence**\nThe proposal covers 2 months of costs, but we will not request the total funds in one transaction. In order to stay flexible, we will compute our costs and request that money from the DAO on a monthly basis. This allows us to have more flexibility and to only ask for money that we need. For example, in the event of us lowering the amount of work that we will do, the DAO will retain the excess funds.\n\n**Core team salaries**\nIt is very difficult to estimate how much work we’ll need to do over the coming months. To keep things simple, we will assume that our costs will be similar to previous funding cycles, up until the the incorporation of the studio. This is effectively the minimum that we can spend to ensure that we’re able to maintain the existing studio product.\nHowever, we ask that the DAO understands that we may need some flexibility in how we allocate money and spend time. For that reason, we continue to outline rates and expected hours, but reserve the right to allocate those hours internally at Willyham’s discretion. For example, we may need more web based work rather than contract work for a given month, so we’d allocate more hours for the web engineers.\nWe will maintain our existing rates for time spent:\n* Senior Developer = $125/hr\n* Non-senior Developer = $65/hr\nWe’ll maintain the existing core team. As a guideline, these are the hours that we have previously allocated:\n* Willyham (senior) : 10 hours/week = 40 hours = 5,000 USDC\n* Bhish (senior): 10 hours/week = 40 hours = 5,000 USDC\n* cxkoda(senior): = 5 hours/week = 20 hours = 2,500 USDC\n\n**Other costs**\nIn practice we have found that we sometimes need to bring other people in to help with specific tasks. Whilst we can’t predict these too far in advance, we’d like to reserve the right to pay up to $2500/month for outside help. This is equivalent to 5 hours/week of a senior engineer or ~10 hours/week for a less senior engineer. If there was no need for using this time in a specific month, we would not include it in the payment between the dao and the studio wallets.\n\n**Infrastructure costs**\nFunding for infrastructure is variable and slightly complex. As we use many tools which all have different billing cycles, it’s quite hard to get an exact amount that we’ll need in advance. For this reason I propose that we have a maximum allocation of $2000 and a minimum allocation of $1000. We’ll send $1000 month to our infrastructure credit card to cover existing spending. If our costs change substantially, we are able to request up to $1000 more per month without another proposal.\n\n**Promotion, Incentive schemes and other costs**\nIn the past we have used contractors to produce promotional materials such as videos for marketing our releases. We expect this to continue and would like to reserve up to $2000/month to fund this.\nWe anticipate a month cost for carbon offsetting of around $250.\nWe will continue our tradition of allocating 0.5 Eth to each core team member who is present for the day of the drop. In practice we have found that a release requires us to be online consistently for the duration of the drop (and afterwards), which can be ~10-12 hours of time. Allocating 0.5 Eth is significantly cheaper than paying for those hours.\nAdditionally, we wish to allocate some potential funds towards incentive schemes to attract artists to the platform. For example, we may want to pay a referral bonus to anyone who introduces us to an artist that has a collection accepted by our curation panel. There may also be other mechanisms which we choose to use and these would be at the core team’s discretion. We are requesting a maximum of $1000/m for this.\n\n**Summary of spend**\nAs the spending is slightly flexible. we will outline the overall minimum and maximum spend. In reality we are likely to always have something in between.\n\n \n![36B596F5-36A3-4AA7-8EA0-CE04E5515252.png](ipfs://bafkreifcx7gbdjd4zgp7xxybqs3efesxxebzyrixopddkwwt6ygqaolrue)\n    \n**Estimated profitability**\nWe will aim to maintain our existing cadence for collection releases over the next 6 month period. We can therefore expect to have approximately 3 drops. As drops can differ in their sizes and secondary volume, we can’t predict revenue exactly, but we can extrapolate from previous releases somewhat.\nIf we have 3 collections with an average of 800 pieces per collection, all selling out for a price of 0.2 eth per piece, and the studio taking 15%, then we’d generate 72 Eth in primary sales. If each collection had 500 Eth volume on secondary sales, this would earn a further 37.5 eth for a total of ~110 eth.\nWith eth at $1300 this would be approximately $143,000 for the 6 month period. If we spent our maximum budget every month, this would leave us approximately break-even after taxes (assuming 20%).\nIn practise it is unlike that we’d spend our maximum budget every month. However, to generate more substantial profits for the dao, we’d need to either:\n* launch a collection which had secondary sales on par with Factura or Mind the Gap. A similar collection would earn us a further ~50 eth, or ~$65,000.\n* Sell more pieces (e.g. 3 collections of 1000 pieces if possible).\n* See eth price appreciation\n* Lower our costs\n* Generate other revenue streams (merch, prints etc)\n\n**Future revenue share/bonus considerations**\nWhilst we think the current highest rate of $125/hour for senior engineers is fair, it is certainly not a top of market rate. As such, all of the engineers currently prioritise other (non-dao) projects where they either have an ownership stake or earn more money. In order to change this, we’ve discussed a the possibility of changing our incentive mechanisms to replace the existing 0.5 Eth drop bonus with something new. However, the discussions about what this structure would be are still early and are generally more contentious, so they have been omitted from this proposal in order to simplify and ensure that the core funding we need is secured in advance. There may be a proposal in the future which changes this incentive scheme, which may or may not happen at the same time as any incorporation votes.\n\n**Sponsors:**\nDefi Beats, Willyham",

      "content": "### **Author:**\n\na_dirty_boy\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\n9 October 2022\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThis is a proposal to retain a_dirty_boy as a collab manager for 10 hours per week at $30 per hour for a duration of 3 months.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n**How have I already contributed to the DAO?**\n\nI’ve been an active member since November 2021, a Multisignatory since May 2022 and a Mod since July 2022; I’ve volunteered a lot of my time to gmDAO projects, drafting proposals, arranging both inbound and outbound collabs, following up on leads referred by members, building relationships with external projects and creators, creating competitions and more general project outreach.\n\nI’ve created a system to keep track of inbound and outbound collab requests, referrals, contacts, competitions and results using a combination of google forms and sheets. I’ve increased security by using specific wallets and discord profiles for use when visiting project websites and joining project servers. I’ve implemented project account ownership verification on twitter via the @gmDAOcollab account.\n\nI’ve grown and maintained a network of both resident and freelance collab managers. I have also begun to work, along with other CMs, on a server specifically created to both streamline our collective processes, handle more volume and to share collab alpha and contacts between projects and collab managers - aiming to increase our reach, opportunities and enabling us to connect with more projects.\n\nI currently spend approx 10-20 hours per week, unpaid, either on calls or in discussions via DM/Twitter with projects and collab managers, assessing and filtering individual projects and creating competitions for gmDAO members alongside working a full-time position. **I am not asking to be compensated for any time previously spent undertaking these tasks.**\n\n**How does arranging collabs and project outreach currently provide value to gmDAO?**\n\nArranging AL collabs provides value to gmDAO members in a number of ways:\n\n- **Time saved** - The time that I spend arranging the AL collabs is time that members don’t have to spend to get themselves allowlisted individually.\n- **Guaranteed spots or increased odds** - I always aim for our allocations to be in excess of the average number of competition entries for the giveaways. In cases where this is not possible; entrants have vastly better odds at securing spots through the gmDAO giveaways vs external giveaways.\n- **Financial gain -** Although gains can’t be guaranteed I want members to be in a position to mint and take profits on successful, allowlisted collections wherever possible.\n- **Expanding our network -** Our collab opportunities grow as our network expands\n\nThe above does not generate income for the DAO treasury. It is aimed squarely at providing value to our token holders.\n\n### Specifics:\n\n**How do I want to contribute to the DAO going forward?**\n\nI want to be able to continue with my current collab management tasks, refine and streamline the processes to allow for more volume and to dedicate more time to networking with other projects/collab managers. I also want to simplify the entry process for members so that they don’t miss AL opportunities. I aim to continue providing value to our members through time saved, increased exposure to new projects and potential financial gain.\n\n### Cons/Risks :\n\nImpact on treasury. Default of my obligations under the terms of the agreed retainer.\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\na_dirty_boy - 0x9df5388d04A02a96eb917056A94C192129E982e5\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\n$30 per hour for 10 hours per week over 3 months. I’ve based this rate on the current DAO rate for Ze_Boubs which is at the bottom end of the scale. It is also in line with my current employer's standard overtime rate of £26.20 per hour. Matching this rate gives me the freedom to lower the amount of overtime I have to commit to government work to stay financially secure while allowing me to dedicate more time to working for gmDAO.\n\n130 Hours total (10*52)/12*3\n\n$30 per hour\n\n$3,900 total\n\n0.72% of the current treasury ($538,305)\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nZe-Boubs, Cyphr",

Quality and quantity of DAO members shared wins (crypto/NFT accumulation in wallets) has dropped significantly.

The gnosis safe will be funded from DAO treasury.\n\nOne of the multi-signers (presumably Nemochaken) will be responsible for redirecting alpha calls from both groups to GM.DAO alpha channels\n\nBuyout price for both collection (on 08/10/2022) would be:\n\nHD pass - 1.2 ETH\n\nAnonymice -  0.26 ETH\n\nBest to have a delta with the max of 2 ETH to mitigate market moves risks. All unused funds will be returned to DAO treasury.\n\n### Pros:\n\nRestoring a lacking alpha flow into the community, providing financial benefits to each and every member participating in GM.DAO.\n\n### Cons :\n\nNobody from active DAO members are participants of named groups, so their alpha quality remains unexamined. Only info of their previous trackrecord which could be falsified.\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\nGMDAO.eth\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\n2 ETH\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nNemochaken",

These pieces (token ID’s 1-5), serve both as an investment & keepsake for of the studio’s history. \n\nAt this time the DAO does not own any pieces from the “Mind The Gap” & “Plasticity” collections, which leaves the set incomplete. \n\nI propose we rectify this with by acquiring a number of each collection (5 of each). \n\n### **Rationale**:\n\nIt would allow the DAO to own 5 full sets of studio collections, and given the general trajectory of studio floor prices would act as a sound investment. \n\n### **Specifics**:\n\nIn order to mitigate any front-running or manipulation of the purchase of these 10 pieces, I suggest the funds be sent to gmDAO.eth or another anonymous fresh wallet, and a combination of floor buys & bids can be utilized at random intervals. \n\nAt current floor & taking into account average sale prices over the past few weeks, I estimate that this can be achieved with 6 ETH (3.75 ETH for 5 MTG pieces & 2.25 ETH for 5 plasticity pieces)\n\n### **Pros**:\n\nCompleting 5 studio sets. Gaining licencing for studio assets which could be used for a multitude of reasons. \n\n### **Cons** :\n\nRelatively large payout for a “nice to have” \n\n### **Payout recipient**:\n\ngmDAO.eth or equivalent\n\n### **Payout amount**:\n\n6 ETH\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nCyphr",

      "title": "GM 32.1: Treasury Eth To Stable Mandate",
      "content": "**Author: Defi Beats\nDate: September 6, 2022**\n\nThe following is a proposal to formalize our treasury’s Stable to Eth (and other non-stable balances) as well as formalize a cadence around rebalancing. \n\nWe have had a bunch of discussions as well as an informal snapshot of preferences and the following is meant to be a synthesis that strikes a balance. If this proposal does not make it to snapshot (or if it fails snapshot), a new proposal will be made with modified numbers until a proposal passes. (our governance only allows yes/no/abstain votes)\n\n**For the purpose of this proposal:**\n\n- Stables will mean any stablecoin pegged to USD deemed safe by the treasurer\n    - If we would like to ban certain stables, we will need to do that in a separate proposal and anyone is welcome to propose that (it’s out of scope for this conversation)\n- Eth will refer to $Eth and ANY liquid staked ETH or ETH derivative (i.e, sETH) deemed safe by the treasurer\n    - If we would like to ban certain Eth derivatives, we will need to do that in a separate proposal and anyone is welcome to propose that (it’s out of scope for this conversation)\n    - In the future, proposals will be made to diversify the treasury into other assets. These assets will count toward our Eth allocation unless a new portfolio split is proposed\n    \n\n**The proposed flow and allocation:** \n\nPaying contributors is done once a once (usually at the beginning of the month). The proposal is to rebalance once a month with the calculations being done **after** contributors are paid. \n\nThe proposal is to maintain **8 months** of stables which will allow the DAO to have a substantial runway irrespective of macro conditions in the NFT, ETH, and Equities markets. This rule will hold no matter what the overall percentage of Eth vs Stable is. \n\nA notion page will be created with a summary of all the proposals that are active and a summation of how much the DAO is expected to pay in an 8 month period. \n\nLastly, if 8 months of stables is **less than a 30%** **allocation** of Stables, the treasury will be rebalanced so that stables are at least 30% of our multisig (even if this means our runway is **greater than 8 months**)",

      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nZe_Boubs\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nAugust 31st 2022\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nExtend Ze_Boubs retainer for 6 more months until March 31st 2023.\n\n### **How have you already contributed to the DAO?**\n\nStarted volunteering at early DAO stages: been a mod since late 21. Worked on the creation of the studio discord, and the DAO discord updates. Moderated studio discord / managed contests / made myself available around drop times. Helped ratifying the governance process with the gov team. Was on a 6 months retainer since April 22 : made myself some room in my IRL life to be able to endorse a 120 hours/month commitment to the DAO. My tasks were described in **[GM 9.1 : hire Ze_Boubs as the DAO secretary/CM](https://www.notion.so/GM-9-1-hire-Ze_Boubs-as-the-DAO-secretary-CM-47fd2d05611d42948a3bf255731ec72d).\n\n### **How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward?**\n\nI’d like to perpetuate my retainer into another 6 months, until March 31st 2023.\n\n### **Specifics:**\n\nMy position includes several tasks & duties.\n\nManage Studio Discord community : cover pacific timezone, host events/contests, handle support and keep resources up to date all year long. Make myself fully available for crunch time around drops. Accompany artists from day 1 to post-drop community interactions.\n\nManage DAO community / Secretary tasks: Maintain and promote a vibrant community and its initiatives, create visuals to highlight processes and increase participation. Capture feedback from members and make sure their sentiment is heard. Help to structure the dao into a self-sustainable organization, create effective processes (applications, how to join a work group, how to require funding). Keep track of every community initiative and how it’s going, help members go through the dao processes and accompany them to create work group/request funding.Be the link between members and work group leads/Cyphr to help filter the noise. Track important updates/needs across the DAO. Make a quick weekly overall summary to keep members in touch with what is going on, what are the newest community initiatives, how they can contribute.\n\nGovernance/side tasks : Ensure funding cycle calendar, DAO Proposal, contributors list and all associated Governance process pages in Notion are up to date. Shepherd proposals through the governance process by watching temperature checks in Discord, publish and alert about Snapshots, and handoff execution to the multi-sig signers when snapshot is done. Initiate governance process updates when needed.\n\n### **Risks:**\n\nImpact on treasury. Default of my obligations under the terms of the agreed retainer.\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\nTotal financial commitment for the DAO : 21600$ distributed monthly over a 6-months period, roughly 3,2% of DAO treasury (649000$ at proposal time).\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nCyphr",

      "title": "GM29.1 : Stablecoin / ETH DAO Treasury ratio - nonbinding recommendation",
      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nIgnoramus\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nAugust 21st 2022\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe DAO input should provide a guideline as to what risk levels are acceptable when managing our treasury. This is a contentious issue, thus it is key to source input from the whole DAO.\n\n### **What we’re voting on ?**:\n\nWe are voting on how the DAO Treasury should be split between ETH and stablecoins. The vote is nonbinding for the DAO Treasurer (De-Fi Beats), however will provide key input for the decision what will be the ETH / stablecoin ratio.\n\nAlong with the growth of our Treasury the topic of risk management has gained more importance. Our revenues come from new drops and commissions from gm.DAO drop and gm.DAO token transactions - all denominated in ETH. Our expenses are either denominated in US dollars, or in ETH but with a clear dollar background dollar. This creates an imbalance which needs to be addressed.\n\nDue to ETH price volatility it makes sense for the Treasury to carry both stablecoins and ETH. This way we secure possible ETH appreciation upside but also reduce the downside and ensure survival in more bearish scenarios. What needs to be determined, are the exact proportions between ETH and stablecoins.\n\nThis vote is done in a non-binding manner, because our current governance process only allows for a basic voting system (For/Against/Abstain). However with the ETH merge coming up we felt it is important to get the wider DAO opinion on the topic as soon as possible.\n\nWhat this vote does not pertain to is the exact type of stablecoin the DAO should hold. This is a topic which should be discussed separately later once we have a policy what stablecoin % should we hold. Same holds for possible yield generation strategies.\n\n**Data as of August 21st, 2022:**\n*DAO Treasury value: $550k\nMonthly recurrent DAO expenses, which are denominated in dollars: $23.7k\nMonthly recurrent DAO expenses, which are denominated in ETH: ca 6.5 ETH\nStablecoin % in DAO Treasury: 31.7%\nHistorical stablecoin % in DAO Treasury: from 0% to 31.7%*\n\n### **Voting choices** :\n\n1. 30% stablecoins / 70% ETH\n2. 40% stablecoins / 60% ETH\n3. 50% stablecoins / 50% ETH\n4. 60% stablecoins / 40% ETH\n5. 70% stablecoins / 30% ETH\n\n### **Execution**:\n\nThe stablecoin / ETH ratio would be achieved by periodically rebalancing the treasury. Generally it would mean converting part of the ETH balance to stablecoins. The rebalancing would occur:\n\n1. Periodically - at least once a month, after monthly contributors payouts\n2. In between, If any single payout impacts the treasury enough to induce a >10% ratio change.\n\n### **People involved**:\n\n@De-Fi Beats managing / executing rebalancing, DAO multisig participants signing transactions\n\n### **Constraints**:\n\nTo ensure a minimum level of financial stability any stablecoin / ETH ratio will be implemented under the condition the DAO has at least an eight-month runway. This means at any point in time the DAO recurrent expenses for at least the next eight months should be covered. Any already agreed expenses with a longer horizon should also be covered. E.g. with our current expense levels it means we now have to hold at least $231.6k in stablecoins and 52 ETH. This means currently we need to maintain at least a 42.2% stablecoin ratio regardless of the outcome of this vote.\nTreasury rebalancing speed is constrained by the efficiency of our multisig.\n\n### **Benefits / Risks**:\n\nThe more ETH we hold in the treasury, the more we profit when the ETH price rises. The more stablecoins we hold, the less value we lose when the ETH price drops.\nETH has risks connected with the upcoming merge, its execution and the PoS / PoW discussion. Stablecoins have their own risks:\n- USDC regulatory risk\n- USDT transparency risk\n- depegging risk for most others\n\n### **Type of vote** :\n\nRanked choice voting:\nplease rank your preferred stablecoin / ETH ratios in order of precedence, from the most preferred to the least preferred. \n\nSome options will show up as if they had not received any votes because they were eliminated in the ranked-choice voting process.

      "content": "### **Author:**\n\nZe_Boubs\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nDecember 16, 2021\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThis proposal is drafted to propose delegation of votes to another wallet. This would allow people to delegate to one of their own wallet or to someone else’s wallet.\n\n### Pros :\n\nPeople can delegate their voting power to their hot wallet, which should allow increased security and participation by a lot as you don't have to get your HW wallet to vote each time. They can also delegate to the member of their choice, who might be more aware of current proposals/discussions.\n\n### Risks:\n\nDelegating to wallets other than yours means some delegates will potentially centralize great voting power. This centralization of votes could also makes us more vulnerable to malicious actors.\n\nMitigation of risks : People can still vote even if their vote is delegated. If the owner and the delegate both vote on the same proposal, delegate’s vote is automatically cancelled. Giving members an easier access to their voting power also means we can be more reactive to any malicious governance attack.\n\n### Specifics**:**\n\nWe’d be using snapshot delegation.\n\nSnapshot uses the Gnosis \"Delegate Registry\" contract.

      "content": "**Author:** \n\nCalbear, OTM, Zarkem, Defi Beats\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nAugust 5, 2022\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nTL:DR - Hire a Lawyer to incorporate our DAO and Studio (and an entity to new ‘products’). **This proposal is for invoice #1** **only**\n\nUnder existing laws, it is possible a court or regulator could view the DAO, given its unincorporated status, as a general partnership. This could potentially create a lot of risk for individual members of the DAO. \n\nIn addition to this we will need to pay taxes for the year 2022 and wish to incorporate in a jurisdiction with the most advantageous tax code. \n\nLastly, with the idea of $GMC being thrown around we want to retain a lawyer who can help us keep this above board and within best practices.\n\nBecause of this, we have started interviewing web3 Lawyers and hope to bring the best candidate in front of the DAO for a vote. We have isolated one candidate who has a lot of experience incorporating DAOs in Switzerland. We will share a lot more details but the idea here is to get the conversation started since we would like to move fairly quickly.\n\nWe think that the DAO should be incorporated as a non-profit while the studio should be a for profit entity - However, this is 100% up to what the lawyer recommends and what we vote on as a group in the future. \n\n### Risks:\n\nHiring the wrong firm and wasting the DAO’s money\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\n**[LOREZ LEGAL](https://www.lorezlegal.com/)**\n\n### **Why This Firm?:**\n\nThe firm was recommended by a lawyer that is working with a side project from one of the gmDAO member. He was told that she was specializing in wrapping DAOs in Switzerland. She was one of the three candidates for addressing the incorporation of gmDAO.\n\nShe has wide experience as she has wrapped more than 40 DAOs in Switzerland. She presented the arguments on why Switzerland is the best location as it is a safe regulatory environment, friendly tax related and advantages for marketing (Cryptovalley). She identified the different possible scenarios how to set up DAO and the Studio based on her experienced.\n\n### **How We Will Go About This?**\n\nWe will continue to update this proposal as more information becomes available. But wanted to start the discussion process now as it’s in all of our best interests to start soon. \n\nFull SOW can be found here:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1RPygrlXQ6SYqUmZprZtJSeWzpHlmmI7S](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1RPygrlXQ6SYqUmZprZtJSeWzpHlmmI7S)\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\n**Updated 8.18.22**\n\nTotal = 60,000 CHF ($**62,721.54 USD)**\n\nFirst Invoice = 30,000 (**$31,280.94 USD**)\n\n(of the three lawyers we spoke to, all three were within this range)\n\n**POINT OF CLARITY**\n\nThis vote is only for payment one we will vote again after assessing how the lawyer performs to ensure we want to continue with her services\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nCyphr",

The snapshot phase would also be extended by 24 additional hours (Monday 00:00UTC to Thursday 00:00UTC).\n \n![GC_final (1).png](ipfs://bafkreidttv65jqfxbz77a5qwfo337l4clu2hvg7wvlobnophwk7ty6g55a)\n    \n\n**Dismissing a contributor currently under an ongoing retainer.**\nThe DAO may terminate an individual on retainer following a serious default of the contributor’s obligations under the terms of the agreed upon retainer or upon gross misconduct of the contributor which gives rise to a right to dismissal. Gross misconduct is defined as an act or omission that is flagrant and deliberate, and that substantially deviates from the standards of behavior that are commonly acceptable. Examples of gross misconduct may include, but are not limited, to: gross negligence, offensive behavior, theft, or reputational or financial damage to the DAO. The DAO member initiating the proposal must document written notice to the contributor and proof of gross misconduct or recurrent failure of contract obligation. The dismissal must be voted on and approved according to the governance process in place at that time. Quorum for a dismissal of a contributor with an ongoing retainer must be at least 120 votes.\n\n**Low quorum :**\n\nUp for discussion. We suggest the following quorums depending on the type of proposal,         **with 1 vote = 1gmDAO token**:\n\n- no funds involved, single or recurrent payout (retainers) involving total financial commitment less than $10,000: 60 vote quorum.\n- single or recurrent payout (retainers) involving a total financial commitment less than or equal to 10% of the current treasury: 80 vote quorum.\n- dismissal of a contributor : 120 vote quorum.\n- any payout involving a total financial commitment greater than 10% of the current treasury, or amending the governance process : 180 vote quorum.\n- dissolution of the dao : 450 vote quorum\n\n### Risks:\n\nSlow down the governance process, create higher quorum barrier.\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nZe_Boubs, Nodallydude, Ignoramus, Sloth",

      "content": "## Author.\n\nSpeeps and Wes Hazard.\n\n## Summary/Abstract/Motivation\n\n“Our primary goal is to foster & encourage the development of the NFT space”\n\nAs the gmDAO, gm.studio, & our other initiatives continue to expand and deploy content it is vital to have a writing/editorial team responsible for keeping members informed/engaged, promoting our work & mission outside of our group, and establishing ourselves as leaders in the DAO & generative art communities. We’ve successfully issued a gazette on a roughly monthly basis for some time and feel it’s time to take steps to formalize these initiatives.\n\n1. The establishment of a funded [gm.press](http://gm.press) branch.\n2. A retroactive compensation for the gazette June/July’s issue (specified below).\n3. Retroactive compensation for Twitter spaces hosting (specified below).\n\n## Specifications\n\n### 1. Editorial committee.\n\n---\n\n**The Editorial Committee shall be responsible for allocating funds from a monthly budget to writing, media, graphic design work, or any gm.press related work that is of interest & value to our community + a general audience.**\n\nThis committee aims to establish an editorial structure to filter submissions and commission content, and evaluate whether a given work is relevant and of sufficient quality to be featured on our channels.. They’ll mainly decide content for Twitter & Medium.\nAs well as any community member is welcome to share thoughts/point of views about the editorial content, he committee shall exercise final say over the content published across our official platforms. \n\nEach article will be read and analyzed by the committee under multiple criteria :  **relevance - complexity(research component, interview component, time required,etc) - writing quality**. The committee reserves the right to refuse / delay any work for specific reasons and the author must be aware that reasonable edits/modification might be requested by the committee prior to publication. Any such edits will not result in additional fees paid to the writer.\nAt launch, the committee will be made up of seven volunteers : Wes, Cyphr, Ze_Boubs, Ignoramus, Speeps, Maths Town and Yorks\nAs time goes on, we'll hopefully include or dismiss volunteers, based on a vote from the current committee. Committee’s mode of operation will be specified and amended if needed.\n\n<aside>\n⚠️ ***Participation on the Committee is not a paid role.***\n\n</aside>\n\n### 2. Paid contributors.\n\n---\n\n- **Graphic designer (Speeps) :**\n    - **Creating visual for twitter promoting the article published on medium.**\n    - **Creating visual to add to the article on Medium.**\n    \n    **⇒ Rate : 40$/hr** \n    \n\n---\n\n- **Space hosting (Wes) :**\n    \n    Within the NFT/DAO environment Twitter spaces represent one of the most popular and effective ways for creators, communities, and enthusiasts to promote their projects, release information, answer questions, and build audiences. gmDAO & [gm.studio](http://gm.studio) have effectively used spaces to promote their drops while providing the general public with an opportunity to ask questions and get to know our artists and the vision for all gmDAO related entities. \n    \n    1. All but one of our spaces have been hosted by Wes Hazard (0x_wes) who is a professional emcee and television presenter with extensive experience with hosting, interviewing, booking, & research. \n    2. In addition to smoothly guiding the conversation & Q&As during the live spaces he has conducted extensive pre-interviews with all artists for the last 3 drops and prepared a basic agenda for the spaces. \n    3. Moving forward our plan is to conduct a weekly Twitter space for the gm community focusing on developments in the generative art space (not limited to gm initiatives), generative art history, gm community updates, etc.\n    \n    - **Host a weekly gm Twitter space**\n    - **Set the agenda and book potential guests**\n    - **Compensation in line with comparable IRL emcee rates.**\n    \n    **⇒ Rate : 400$/twitter space**\n    \n\n---\n\n- **Article rates :**\n    \n    The committee will use theses rates as a basis cost with words threshold, it can add a complexity factor after analysis and deliberation with committee members, publicly shared with the members.\n    \n    **Classic article ⇒ x < 500 words.**\n    \n    > **→ 250$**\n    > \n    \n    **Medium article  ⇒ 500 < x < 1000 words.**\n    \n    > **→ 500$**\n    > \n    \n    **Long article ⇒ x > 1000 words.**\n    \n    > **→ 700$**\n    > \n\n## Breakdown of costs.\n\n### June/July remuneration.\n\nAsking for a retroactive payment for June/July work + a recurrent funding for the upcoming months.\n\n![Capture d’écran 2022-08-05 à 14.17.01.png](ipfs://bafkreicfoep2g4axdpo3ilp4a2owjrzbmhttj3peq6awuexoc4cafad4la)\n    \n### Monthly funding for 6 months starting August\n\nBased on rates above, we require a monthly budget that doesn’t roll over if unspent.\n\nThis budget would allow for example :\n\n**⇒ Budget of 2500$ per month dedicated to pay authors (3 article / month), graphical work, any additional costs.**\n\n**⇒ Budget of 1600$ per month dedicated to host 4 spaces / month.**\n\nA specific multisig wallet will be created where funds will be deposited. Funds don’t roll over into the next month. The committee will ensure that money spent by the press branch isn’t over allocated.\n\n**Total : 3010 USDC to immediatly send to Speeps’s wallet (shared to Wes according breakdown funds) + 4100 USDC to distribute each 5th to the multisig gm. press wallet, starting next month (august).**\n\n## Risks.\n\nImpact on the treasury.\n\n## Sponsors.\n\nWes Hazard, Speeps, Cyphr, Ze_boubs, Ignoramus",

      "content": "### **Summary:**\n\nTo extend Defi Beat’s role as Treasurer for the rest of 2022 (July - December 2022) with some key changes that will be more beneficial for the DAO. \n\n[Old Proposal For Context](https://www.notion.so/GM-8-1-Treasury-Core-Team-Appointment-5d6ad086eb764f2aa94019d47967aef2) \n\n### What’s Changing**:**\n\nIt’s clear that the DAO needs a “CFO” as much as it needs an “investment Advisor” - and so this proposal attempts to modify the position to be more in-line with the DAOs needs\n\n- **Eliminating The 5% Profit Sharing Bonus** - While it would help motivate out-of-the-box thinking, it is in the DAOs best interest that all profits stay in the treasury. If we’d like to reward high performance, a proposal can be made to issue bonuses to any member of the DAO.\n\n### What’s Staying The Same?**:**\n\n- De-Fi Beats to receive $2,000 USD a month\n- De-Fi to have a $2,000 a month stipend to spend on other contributors (from within the DAO) that DOES NOT roll over if unused.\n\n### Goals:\n\n**Opperations:**\nTo assist the DAOs day-to-day operations as it relates to inflows, outflows, and accounting. To work with professionals (Lawyers and Accountants) to ensure we are doing everything by the book.  \n\n**Treasury Management:**\nThe long term goal is to one day have all of gmDAOs monthly expenses be paid for by the conservative yield on our growing treasury. The short term goal is to garner yield without putting the funds in any significant risk (i.e, not to lose any money in any circumstance) \n\n### **Risks:**\n\nInvestment risks on a small portion of our treasury\n\nSpending treasury on salaries but not seeing any tangible benefits\n\n### What Has Been Done So Far:\n\n- Moved a strategic portion of our treasury into stables and stEth for growth and diversification\n- Test drove various accounting software to find the right fit for the DAO\n- Onboarded gmDAO onto Coinshift an accounting software that will allow us to run P&L statements and report to tax authorities\n- PMing DAO strategy sessions that will help us grow our offerings\n\n### Day-to-Day Operations:\n\n- Monitoring the treasury on a regular basis to spot oddities or opportunities for diversification\n- Paying contributors and the studio - i.e., wrangling multi sig signers\n- Updating our accounting software to ensure transactions are tagged appropriately\n\n### What Is On The Horizon:\n\n- Upgrading our account to Coinshift V2 which will allow for even more functionality\n- Diversifying our treasury by swapping into more stables\n- Assisting with interviewing and selecting our legal team to help the DAO incorporate\n- Managing this team as they work through our specific needs\n- Interviewing and selecting an accounting firm to help us file taxes\n- Providing paperwork to contributors and accounting firms to ensure we are compliant with whatever jurisdiction we end up incorporating in",

These achievements were made possible by many people, but all of which I oversaw & directed. \n\n- Grew the DAO treasury to ~**300 ETH**\n- Successfully launched 4 gm. studio drops generating **5,794 ETH** in secondary volume\n- gm. token reached a peak of **6 ETH** & **1500 ETH** secondary volume\n- Grew the gm. studio twitter account to **19k followers** & gmDAO account to **5k followers**\n- Generated over **2.4M impression**s from the gm. studio twitter account\n- Brought on 2 full / part time contributors @Ze_Boubs & @De-Fi Beats\n\nMy conservative estimate for working hours in my last proposal was 35 hours a week but in reality this number is often much higher. However, to keep things simple I’m happy to continue working based on that conservative estimate. \n\nThe DAO staff delegation* may terminate this retainer following a serious default of the employment obligations or gross misconduct which gives rise to a fair right to dismissal, provided that the delegation shall, where possible, prior to dismissal, give written notice to the member specifying the serious default which has been the cause of the dismissal.\n\nA termination must be passed with an additional DAO vote via snapshot\n\n*Staff delegation to be established\n\n### Risks:\n\nIf ETH returns to 1k or below (and we have not yet rebalanced the treasury into stables), this retainer could take a substantial chunk of our ETH holdings. If this were to arise, I would happily withhold a % of my salary until such time that ETH has returned to a reasonable level.\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\n*cyphr.eth*\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\n35 hours a week / 140 hours a month @ $100/hour = **$14,000 per month**\n\n### **Have you already contributed to the DAO?**\n\n*Yes*\n\n### How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?**\n\nFull time responsibilities would include but not be limited to:\n\n- Build & maintain the reputation of the gmDAO as it’s founder\n- Identify new projects & investment opportunities to grow the gmDAO treasury\n- Management of gmDAO & gm. studio Twitter accounts\n- Moderation & community management of gmDAO & gm. studio discords\n- Business development for the gm. studio (i.e talent acquisition, building brand awareness)\n- Handling of artist submissions to the studio in a timely manner\n- Providing the curation panel with all necessary assets & information to perform their function and collating panel feedback to prospective artists.\n- Influencer management\n- Partnership management",

Before we do a full order we need to run a test batch to assess quality of the apparel and make sure it is to our liking. The test batch will include the following items:\n\n1x hoodie (black) + ‘gm’ embroidery\n1x sweater (black) + ‘gm’ embroidery\n1x sweater (white) + ‘gm’ embroidery\n1x t-shirt (black) + ‘gm’ embroidery\nHang tag sample\nNeck label sample\nBox + sticker sample\nDesign of the merch\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/958784034329219122/964462934250123294/Genesis_collection.pdf\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/958784034329219122/964462934250123294/Genesis_collection.pdf\n\n**## Motivation:**\n\nThere are a couple of advantages going with this supplier:\n\nNo minimum order quantity;\nItems can be stocked until they are shipped;\nBranded packaging is possible;\nThey can take care of the logistics (against a fee).\nWhat we need to keep in mind:\n\nCustomization with this whitelabel solution is limited;\nIf we open up the merchandise to outside the DAO it might be cheaper to produce our own collection.\n\n**## Risks:**\n\nQuality of the fabric & embroidery is unsatisfactory. In that case we’ll need to find a different supplier;\nWith this solution we have less control over quality as it is shipped directly from the factory;\nWith this solution we have less control over logistics. In edge cases it might be harder to track the package and provide customer support.\n\n**## Specification:**\n\nhttps://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/bf8aef0d-de46-4611-bfd9-0ada56952cab/Untitled.png\n\nhttps://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/c66e2e20-2fb9-4aec-838e-68cff84f95dd/Untitled.png\n\n**## Rationale:**\n\nWe need a test batch to assess the quality of the merch before doing a full order.\n\n**## Timeframe:**\n\nAfter approval the manufacturer needs 15-20 working days to produce the test batch. Expected delivery will be around week 22.",

This is extremely important for decision-making as we build out reward structures within the DAO. Having discussed with him, he has confirmed he would be an active participant of, and provide valuable insight for, the discussion surrounding a potential ERC-20 token, rewards-structure, and further potential developments where legal clarification is imperative. alphahater also has a tremendous network, which would be valuable to gmDAO as we build out revenue sources.\n\nNotion link : https://www.notion.so/gmdao/GM-11-1-Gift-Community-gmToken-to-alphahater-071b9813cada4664acc02dfbe0ec939b\n\n",

      "title": "GM 8.1 - Treasury Core Team Appointment",
      "content": "### **Summary:**\n\n**To establish a team dedicated to the health and growth of our treasury and to establish Defi-Beats as the leaders of this team (Treasurer of gmDAO).** \n\nAt the end of the day, the treasury belongs to the DAO and any changes will have to come to a vote. Possible future votes may include:\n\n- Setting up a conservative portfolio\n- Subsequent changes to this portfolio\n- Establishing a cadence for rebalancing\n- Investing in other DAOs\n- Any other investments the DAO may want to make with its treasury\n\n**The Treasurer of gmDAO will need to be more of a communicator and consensus builder than a money savant.** At the moment our sizable treasury is laying dormant. Conservative strategies can ensure that our funds grow in between NFT drops. However, our money will continue to lay dormant unless someone takes responsibility for the tasks laid above.  \n\n### Goals:\n\nThe long term goal is to one day have all of gmDAOs monthly expenses be paid for by the conservative yield on our growing treasury. The short term goal is to garner yield without putting the funds in any significant risk (i.e, not to lose any money in any circumstance) \n\n### **Risks:**\n\nInvestment risks on a small portion of our treasury\n\nSpending treasury on salaries but not seeing any treasury growth\n\n### **How have you already contributed to the DAO?**\n\nDe-fi Beats was an early contributor on the Governance team and helped establish and organize the process we are following at the moment. \n\n### **How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward?**\n\nThe Treasury Working Group will be responsible for:\n\n- Attending weekly meetings with core DAO members\n- Designing and implementing a low risk portfolio\n- Automating as much as possible to reduce human error\n- Monitoring the portfolio weekly and making adjustments accordingly\n- Rebalancing once a month\n- Monthly DAO wide reporting on results\n- Assisting the DAO in any treasury centered tasks such as budgeting, projections, and cost cutting recommendations\n- Discussing and debating new proposals that may offer better opportunities\n- Eventually, once the treasury grows to a more substantial size, this teams wants to lead the DAO into a phase where funds can be granted to DAO members to start their own projects within the DAO. We also see a world where gmDAO can fund outside ventures and subsequently own a piece of another DAO.\n\n### **A rough rough sketch of what our treasury can look like once this passes**\n\nThis is a peek of what we may propose once we know that the DAO is interested in putting the treasury to work - our portfolio will need to be voted on by the DAO before anything can happen. \n\n[Treasury Breakdown](https://www.notion.so/4ba4486aa2a448598474420bfdb18a40)\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\n*Treasury Lead (*De-Fi Beats)\n\nContributors (Yopez, kadigan.eth, other contributors welcome)\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\nFrom the description laid out above and below, a fair compensation for this role has been set to $2,000 a month. We would also like to set aside $2,000 a month to compensate contributors on a task by task basis, any funds not used out of the allotted $2,000 will remain in the treasury and will not roll over to the next month. \n\n**We are also proposing a 3 month trial period. After which an extension will need to be put to a vote.** \n\n**We  propose allocating 5% of profits to all members of the treasury team in order to incentivize creativity and diligence.**\n\n- A snapshot of the treasury will be taken once the below portfolio is enacted\n- The below portfolio will not go into effect until after the Plasticity sale\n- After the three month trial period we will take a second snapshot and calculating ROI in native currencies in order to negate the effects of wild swings.\n    - Example: Profits of USDC will be calculated in USD, profits of ETH will be calculated in ETH not USD. So any price movement of ETH as an asset will not effect ROI\n- Income (sales, secondary royalties) and outflows (monthly expenses) will be accounted for when calculating ROI (i.e., income from royalties does not factor into ROI)\n- An ROI report will be made available to the DAO at least 7 days before any contributors are paid their incentive bonus\n\n### Miscellaneous**:**\n\n**Contributor backgrounds**\n\n- De-fi Beats (Defi-Beats.eth): I am the co-founder of [HZQ Consulting](https://www.hzqconsulting.com/) we don’t really do titles but my role fits closest to COO. Helped grow the company from 0 to $1M / year in just under 4 years. The parts of my role that fit closest to being gmDAO’s Treasurer involve creating and staying within budget, making strategic investments in technologies and individuals, building consensus with clients, and making decisions under constant uncertainty (especially during COVID). At the moment I am full time Web3 working in DAOs and growing my own personal treasury through DeFi.\n- kadigan.eth: Long time crypto enthusiast. Bitcoin since 2013, DeFi since ETHLend. Full-time crypto for a few years now after founding a smaller centralized crypto business with closer to 20 employees today. Day job as a CEO includes managing company and customer funds, including risk-assessment for protocol security and price swings. Writes Solidity in free time. In conclusion; technical background, experienced in treasury management, team work and DeFi, little experience from working in a DAO.",

However, we will request less money for our contractor fund, as we still have remaining funds from last month.\n\nExisting structure is funding for 1 lead (Willyham), 1 contract dev (cxkoda) and 1 web dev (bhosh) on a part-time basis. This month, we will also add Coelacanth for 15 hours total (not weekly), to provide contract development, review, and audits.\n\nWillyham: ~20 hours per week\n\nBhosh: ~10 hours per week\n\ncxkoda: ~10 hours per week\n\nCoelacanth: 15 hours total\n\nWe are also proposing funding to compensate devs specifically for the \"crunch\" time around a drop (we learnt from last time that devs need to be online pretty much all weekend to deal with issues as they arise).\n\nBreakdown of costs :\n\n- Core team (salary based on the outlined hours at the rate of 100$/hour): ~6.5 ETH\n- Drop fund (crunch time around the drop): 1.5 ETH\n- Contractor fund (one time contributors): 0 ETH - *We previously asked for 2 ETH and have only allocated 0.5. We do not expect to exceed the remaining 1.5 ETH this month.*\n- Operations and deployment (infrastructure and smart contract deployment): 0.5 ETH - *Note, gas prices are currently low, but we’d rather request the amount which we’ve needed in the past to avoid falling short. We may not need another request for this in the next proposal if we have enough spare.*\n\n- Total request: 8.5 ETH, sent to the studio multisig: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x16485319Aa0aD7a4E68176FBaadA235c92ACae2E](https://etherscan.io/address/0x16485319Aa0aD7a4E68176FBaadA235c92ACae2E)\n\nUnspent funds leaning in Studio multisig: 2 ETH\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nZe_Boubs, cxkoda, willyham",

Ease process management for governance team and simplify the overall process.\n\n### Risks:\n\nAdd confusion.\n\n### **What are the changes being proposed?**\n\ngmDAO *governance runs on a 7 day cycle.* \n\n## Pre - GC :\n\n### **Idea**\n\nWhen a community member has an idea for a proposal, they are encouraged to pitch the idea in the #dao-ideas channel, gather opinions and encourage people to chat about it.\n\n### Proposal\n\nIf the community member would like to move forward based on initial feedback, they need to create a formal proposal based on a [proposal template](https://www.notion.so/DAO-Proposals-c0ba8e87890b4ddaa14d1c992229170c) under the *draft* Notion’s section and post it in the #proposals Discord channel. A discussion thread should be created under the proposal to allow for community feedback. Tag a (Governance member) and ask that it be included in the next Temperature Check when you feel it’s time to do so.\n\n*Note: The proposal can be included in the actual Tgovernance cycle if submitted prior to Day 1. Either way it will be included in the next governance cycle.*\n\n## Governance Cycle Phases\n\n![Capture d’écran 2022-02-22 à 11.53.24.png](GM%203%201%20Gov%20531e6/Capture_decran_2022-02-22_a_11.53.24.png)\n\n### Phase 1 - Temperature Check\n\n<aside>\n⏳ Day 1-3 of Governance Cycle: (Saturday 00:00 UTC  - Monday 00:00 UTC)\n\n</aside>\n\nA 2**-day temperature check** reactions will be created for each submitted proposal prior to day 1 of the governance cycle. The temp check is displayed as a 🟢 or 🔴 reaction under each proposal included in the actual GC. These reactions are meant to show contentiousness of the proposal.\n\nDuring the temp check, the author can update his proposal based on the DAO's feedback, and is able to postpone his own proposal to the next GC.\n\nProposals must conform to a Governance template (see Proposal Types and Voter Responsibilities below) or provide a minimum one sentence explanation of why they does not conform to a template.\n\nNotes: Proposals that cannot be executed will not move to the next step.\n\n***Proposals that have at least 20*** 🔴 will automatically be postponed to the next GC; as an incentive to review it and raise more consensus. However, the author will be able to force it into snapshot at the next GC regardless of any contentious opinion.\n\n### Phase 2 - Voting Off-Chain\n\n<aside>\n⏳ Day 3-4 of Governance Cycle: (Monday 00:00 UTC - Wednesday 00:00 UTC)\n\n</aside>\n\nFormal voting is conducted in Snapshot. Voting will be open for at least 48 hours. Typically, voting will open on day 3 of the governance cycle and close on day 5 . \n\nAll Snapshot proposals are decided based on single-choice vote. Some types of proposals are conducted by $gmDAO token holders, others are conducted by specific subsets of DAO contributors defined below in Proposal Types and Voter Responsibilities.\n\nEach Snapshot proposal must include the full proposal text, a link to an immutable (IPFS or Arweave) version of the proposal text, and a link to the discord discussion.\n\n**Proposals that have at least 60% approval from 40 or more addresses pass and are queued for execution.**\n\n### Phase 3 - Execution\n\n<aside>\n⌛ Begins on Day 5 of Funding Cycle - Wednesday  00:00 UTC\n\n</aside>\n\nThe proposals that passed voting are now ratified and will be executed as soon as possible by the responsible entities.\n\nThis can for example involve the transfer of treasury funds which will be executed by the DAO's Gnosis multi-sig (0xe1a4cb40A1D672Bb7901b646Bb18Eb7B70BD5952)\n\n### **What is the goal of this proposal?**\n\nGet rid of the temp-check vote channel, and allow members to have a quick feedback on contentious proposals. Introduce the ability for the community to postpone a proposal to the next GC to encourage consensus and discussion before voting. \n\nIt allows people to force their proposal into snapshot in the next GC even if they don’t raise consensus in the temperature check. \n\n### **What is the expected impact of these changes?**\n\nEnhance commitment for members in proposals submission.\n\n### W**hat help might be needed from gmDAO and its members?**\n\n*Your answer here.*\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nNodallydude, 0xSTVG, De-Fi Beats, cxkoda, Ze_Boubs",

After reflecting on our initial launch of the studio we have decided that we would like to pursue funding for a small core team of developers. With dedicated funding we will allow the team to move quickly without worrying about compensation after the fact. Whilst we will still be encouraging other members of gmDAO to contribute, any external contributions would be done without expectation of compensation unless explicitly stated. For areas in which the core team do not have expertise, we will contract other members for an up-front price or rate. This spending will be at the discretion of the studio team.\n\nWe propose funding a core gm.studio dev team for the next month, which will enable us to:\n\n- Improve the existing infrastructure to support the next drop\n- Implement the web/contract details for the next drop\n- Implement artist collection submission and curation team features\n- Improve best practices around security and operations\n\nWe are initially asking for funding for 1 lead (Willyham), 1 contract dev (cxcoda) and 1 web dev (bhosh) on a part-time basis. \n\nWillyham: ~20 hours per week\nBhosh & cxcoda: ~10 hours per week.\n\nWe are also proposing funding to compensate devs specifically for the \"crunch\" time around a drop (we learnt from last time that devs need to be online pretty much all weekend to deal with issues as they arise).\n\n### Risks:\n\n*A lack of core developers means we risk further development of studio functionality & being unprepared for future drops*\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\n*Payout recipient's name and address.*\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\nBreakdown of costs:\nCore team: ~6 ETH\nDrop fund: 1.5 ETH\nContractor fund: 2 ETH\nOperations and deployment: 0.5 ETH\n\n**Total request: 10 ETH**\n\n### How **have you already contributed to the DAO?**\n\nThese core developers were the primary contributes for the gm. studio up to now\n\n### How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?**\n\nN/A\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nCyphr, Willyham, Cxkoda, Bhosh\n\n\nIPFS\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPaeMSVi5qAcezrRaKN1PCNPmJpniRoi7AG2ZmHSr6YpK\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/884035600502640663/944202522652991528\n\nNotion Proposal\nhttps://www.notion.so/gmdao/GM-2-6-studio-core-dev-fund-1-month-retainer-f763b051e9cd43698a95c54b26e61af5\n\n",

Times this by 5 and we reach a low carbon footprint of 150 tonnes which we would look to offset. \n\nCarbon credits via offsetra = $4.83 per tonne, making our burden $724.5\n\n**I suggest we round this to $1,000 to be safe**\n\n### How **have you already contributed to the DAO?**\n\nN/A\n\n### How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?**\n\nN/A\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\n[@ike](https://www.notion.so/ike-a4ef253611974266b6e60d440548a375), MV, Willyham, [@Rich](https://www.notion.so/Rich-6535feca38cd48f3839658262e6834f9)\n\nIPFS\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qme9d8u1vWg1o9VQDkJ74AzfkcEJSmHY884Ts1SXkBhzmk\n\nDiscord Discussion\nN/A\n\nNotion Proposal\nhttps://www.notion.so/gmdao/GM-1-5-Carbon-offsetting-studio-878984fb1dd74fc59211e441375d76d1\n",

      "content": "*As new ideas emerge, contributors are encouraged to propose new guidelines and amend existing ones.*\n\n### **Author:**\n\nNodallydude\n\n### **Proposal date:**\n\nFebruary 10, 2022\n\n### Summary:\n\n**Proposal Principles:**\n\n1. Working groups are clear and transparent. Meaning, anyone can read what’s going on, and anyone can join any team. \n2. Working group roles are defined. Meaning, we know who to go to or request help from when something is needed. \n3. Working groups responsibilities are clear. Meaning, work outlined in responsibilities are not inhibited by a need to vote (with the exception of use of treasury assets). \n\n \n\nThrough the first few months of the DAO a few key work streams have emerged, this proposal will help define our foundational working groups, what their roles / responsibilities are, and who are the individuals within the working groups as well as who are the leads within the groups. \n\nIn this proposal **roles and responsibilities** are those tasks which we are empowering the working group to complete **without a DAO vote, except in the case where treasury funds or assets are required.** \n\n**Team Definitions —** Team leads are responsible for outcomes, and represent the DAO’s point of contact when help is needed or an issue needs to be resolved. Team members are similarly responsible, and help with the overall workload.  \n\n### Risks:\n\n- Potentially too much structure for where we are as a DAO right now.\n- Reliant on key team members.\n\n### **What are the changes being proposed?**\n\nWe propose the creation of the following working groups and associated responsibilities:\n\n**Governance**\n\n- Roles and Responsibilities\n    1. Administration of governance\n        1. Ensure funding cycle calendar, DAO Proposal, and all associated Governance process pages in Notion are up to date.\n        2. Keep us on the funding cycle calendar. \n        3. Shepherd Proposals through the [governance process](https://www.notion.so/gm-DAO-Governance-Process-3e3dfa72b89448d69b6c27bde31b790d) by setting up temperature check polls in Discord, Publish and alert about Snapshots, and handoff execution to the multi-sig signers when votes are at consensus. \n        4. Activate urgent or emergency governance process. \n    \n    | Team Lead(s) | Team Members  |\n    | --- | --- |\n    | 0xSTVG.eth | Nodallydude |\n    | De-Fi Beats | Ze-Boubs |\n    | Cyphr | sloth |\n    |  | Arnearnearne |\n    |  | ChaLong |\n\n**gm Studio**\n\n- Roles and Responsibilities\n    1.

Or still sleep less, but at least sleep less doing more things he wants to focus on ;)\n- To set up foundational working groups to more easily work towards common goals.\n- To provide a framework for the construction of future working groups.\n- To reduce “DAO thrash,” by channeling community energy.\n\n### **What is the expected impact of these changes?**\n\nI hope that with these changes engaged community members will have defined spaces to flush out and implement their ideas. I also hope that this makes communication within the DAO easier since we will have a clear delineation of responsibility. Reduce workload on team members who are responsible for multiple things right now. \n\n### W**hat help might be needed from gmDAO and its members?**\n\n- Discord reorg (Happening now).\n- Use of new working groups and process.\n\n### **Sponsors:**\n\nIPFS\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaydiioxzQ45XiSSbBNp2xHyrq8HGqt8jShf6sZpAbZAg\n\nDiscord Discussion\nhttps://discord.com/channels/884035600502640663/941711775181713449\n\nNotion Proposal\nhttps://www.notion.so/gmdao/GM-1-6-Ratify-Working-Groups-and-Responsibilities-56596c66a5d24942bdd8ff12c4ed5b51\n",

That speed has afforded us great success! \n\nThe speed we moved came with a tradeoff, of having to use a fluid governance process that was likely faster than most members could effectively contribute as a whole.\n\nI propose we freeze all treasury outflows (excludes ongoing expenses to the studio & work completed) until such a time that:\n\n1. We have established and voted on a a governance process to use going forward.\n    1. This ensures future DAO decisions can reach consensus, and the largest percent of contributors can take time to think and comment accordingly.\n    2. We are able to plan around the governance process. \n    3. We are able to more efficiently make decisions when tight timelines do effect us. \n2. The Discord has been updated for ease of use and alignment.\n    1. This ensure new members are able to quickly onboard. \n    2. Redirects energy to DAO related objectives. Today, the Discord structure is more set up as an alpha group.\n\nI believe we can flush out these two items within 7-10 business days as we do have a governance framework we can use now, and we have already discussed Discord updates, they just require implementation.\n\n### **Risks:**\n\n- This will limit our ability to move quickly if we need to in the next 1-2 weeks.\n- This discussion / vote is not complete in the allotted timeframe\n\n### Relevant Links**:**\n\n[gm DAO Proposed Governance Process](https://www.notion.so/gm-DAO-Governance-Process-3e3dfa72b89448d69b6c27bde31b790d)\n\n### **Payout recipient:**\n\nNA\n\n### **Payout amount:**\n\nNA\n\n### **How have you already contributed to the DAO?**\n\nI am a moderator in gm dao and gm studio, a curation panel member, and a collector\n\n### **How do you want to contribute to the DAO going forward**?****\n\nI intend to continue to help with operational and process refinement.
