Vote on this proposal to confirm your participation.\n2. Complete the Galxe campaign [here](https://app.galxe.com/quest/MagicSquare/GCVsTtKA65) to claim the Discord role.\n\nOnce both steps are completed, you will gain access to the private DAO section of our Discord server [here](https://discord.com/invite/magicsquareio).\n\nYour Total Voting Power (SQRv) is determined by the amount of $SQR you hold and/or stake. The more $SQR you [hold](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?inputCurrency=0x55d398326f99059ff775485246999027b3197955&outputCurrency=0x2B72867c32CF673F7b02d208B26889fEd353B1f8&chain=bsc) and/or [stake](https://magicsquare.io/staking), the larger your SQRv will be, giving you greater influence in decision-making processes within Magic DAO. This proposal serves as a practice for both voting and understanding how SQRv works.\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to familiarize participants with the Magic DAO voting process and to practice calculating Total Voting Power (SQRv). For more information on how Magic DAO operates, please refer to [Magic DAO Docs](https://docs.magicsquare.io/magic-dao).\n\n**By participating in this proposal, you will:**\n\n- Gain access to the Magic DAO private Discord role and channel.\n- Learn how to calculate and understand your SQRv.\n- Increase your influence in the Magic DAO governance process based on the $SQR you hold and stake.\n- Participate in the Magic Square governance process.",

At its core CoE is a blockchain-based game, enabling users to trade and sell their cards freely, with the same level of ownership as if they were real, tangible cards. Players can compete against other players or AI opponents in 1-on-1 combat, battling to destroy the enemy Adventurer before they are themselves defeated. Players can achieve this using a variety of spells and creatures — creatures summoned onto the battlefield to fight on their behalf — as well as equipping Relics to dive directly into the fray. CoE was designed to be a quick, fun, and accessible game, but also offers significant depth, strategy, and complexity for more serious players. The game's cards, Adventurers, and locations are inspired by dark fantasy creating a game rich with detail. Players can choose to play as any of 10-20 Adventurers complete with their own unique creatures, spells, and Relics. Each Adventurer has their own unique trick, which tends to opitomize its character and playstyle.\n\nFor a comprehensive guide on how to participate in the project validation, including evaluation criteria, tips, and steps, please refer to our [Knowledge Base](https://docs.magic.store/magic-features/app-validation).\n\nOnly users with a fully validated MagicID account on the Magic Store (connected wallet, verified email, and selected username) can participate in the voting process.\nIf you have not completed these steps, please visit the [Magic Store](https://magic.store/) to do so before casting your vote.\n\nFor further discussion on Project Cards of Ethernity validation, join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/magicsquare) Server to connect with fellow community members.\n\nFor detailed information on Project Cards of Ethernity, please visit the project page on the Magic Store [here](https://magic.store/app/cards-of-ethernity).",
