      "title": "Vote 37: Gro DAO Strategic Path Forward",
      "content": "## Summary\nDespite the incredible dedication, time, and resources that all Gro DAO contributors and members have poured into this community and protocol over the past three years, Gro DAO finds itself facing challenges that cannot be ignored. The difficult market, underperformance of the Gro protocol, and key departures in the Groda Pod have put Gro DAO at a critical juncture, requiring a decision on its future. Please find below a summary of the situation: \n\n- The DAO’s flagship product, [risk & yield tranching Gro protocol](https://app.gro.xyz/#/), has been underperforming for an extended period. \n- Key contributor departures and failed deliverables have created a leadership void in the Groda Pod (Gro DAO’s only remaining Product Pod), and together with the failed extension of the DAO’s other product pod (Panda) has triggered broader existential questions for the DAO.\n- Groda Pod’s 6-month grant period is ending on October 3rd '23, and it needs to submit a new DAO proposal if it wants to extend its work.\n- Due to the leadership vacuum and existential uncertainty, web3 Studios has been asked to conduct an objective analysis of potential pathways for both Groda Pod and the broader DAO.\n\nSee [[GRFC] - Gro DAO Strategic Path Forward](https://community.gro.xyz/t/grfc-gro-dao-strategic-path-forward/599) for full details and an in-depth analysis and discussion of each option.\n\n## Voting Options\n- **1. Unwind the Protocol and the DAO:** Providing a clear exit strategy for stakeholders.\n- **2. Unwind the Protocol, Continue Building:** Allowing for focused and leaner product development.\n- **3. Reject all options, which has two outcomes:** Leave the DAO without technical capabilities and continuing automated strategies without issue monitoring (Outcome A), unless another proposal is put up for vote and approved (Outcome B).\n- **4. Abstain:** No opinion on the proposal\n\n## Implementation\n**1. Unwind Protocol and DAO:**\n- Immediate unwinding of both Gro protocol and Gro DAO.\n- Extend Groda for 3 months (Oct 3rd - Jan 3rd) to focus on unwinding the protocol and the DAO, with a budget of 180,000 USDC.\n- Users can always withdraw their assets (indefinitely) from GVT, PWRD and Pools.\n- Treasury will be distributed to all who deposit their GRO into a redemption contract, within a 4-week time frame (“collection period”), that would start on the date of this option passing the Snapshot vote.\n- All pods support users in exiting the protocol until January and then dissolve.\n\n**2. Unwind Protocol, Continue Building:**\n- Immediate unwinding of the Gro protocol, assisting users with exit.\n- Users can always withdraw their assets (indefinitely) from GVT, PWRD and Pools.\n- Extend Groda for 6 months (Oct 3rd - Apr 3rd) to focus on streamlined product building with a budget of 245,000 USDC and 350,000 $GRO.\n- Groda downsizes to two key members to focus on product development, foregoing the search for a new product lead.\n- Bi-weekly reports submitted to the DAO.\n- Hiring outside contractors for marketing when the product matures.\n- All pod grants that the DAO has made will continue as granted although workplans will be altered. \n\n**3. Reject all options:**\n- Do not allocate a budget to extend Groda.\n- The DAO will no longer have any technical developer capabilities within its Pod contributors as of October and an orderly unwinding of either protocol or the DAO will technically not be possible.\n- FiSt Pod is tasked with formulating a new strategy for the DAO, which will be up for a vote by December. \n- The grant for People Pod that the DAO has made will continue as granted although workplans will be altered. \n- Two potential outcomes:\n-- Outcome A (Default): Continue automated strategies and stop issue monitoring, leaving no room for an orderly future wind-down.\n-- Outcome B: Open the door for new proposals to come up, allowing for the consideration of strategies not previously assessed.\n\n## Process Steps, Budget, Teams\n**1. Unwind Protocol and DAO**\n**I. Protocol Wind-down**\n- Halt Gro protocol strategies and put into withdrawal-only. No further yield generation.\n- Users retain the ability to withdraw assets indefinitely. A decentralized IPFS interface ensures uninterrupted, decentralized, and easy access to the protocol.\n- All Gro protocol source code will remain open-source for the benefit of the DeFi community. G^2 is a battle-tested, multiple times audited, risk and yield tranching protocol that can wrap any EIP4626 token. \n- Set GRO reward emissions to zero.\n\n**II. Treasury Consolidation**\n- Withdraw treasury assets from all protocols.\n- Return unspent pod buffers and additional budget to the DAO treasury.\n- All treasury assets will be consolidated into USDC and deposited into Compound, and the resulting cUSDC tokens (what is a cToken) will be deposited into the redemption contract.\n\n**III. GRO Collection**\n- The GRO Collection and Redemption process will be handled through a trustless smart contract.\n- Users (excl. team and investors) will be able to immediately withdraw both locked and unlocked GRO from the vesting contract. The duration of the vesting period will be shortened from 365 to 0 days so that DAO members can redeem all their GRO tokens immediately.\n- For investors and the founding team, the original 3-year linear vesting schedule set by the DAO when it deployed its own tokenomics remains in effect, allowing only vested tokens to be available.\n- Users will be able to access a dApp interface for a redemption smart contract where they can deposit their GRO. GRO deposited into this contract will let them claim their share of the DAO treasury. Each depositor’s share will be their GRO out of the total GRO deposited into the redemption contract.\n- The GRO collection period will be live for 4 weeks, starting on the date when this option passes the snapshot vote or when the redemption contract is made available (no later than a month after this proposal is passed), ensuring all active DAO members have enough time to deposit their GRO for redemption.\n\n**IV. Redemption**\n- After the collection period is over, the redemption price will be known and depositors can claim their pro-rated share of the treasury assets. The price will depend on two factors: the final amount of cUSDC from the treasury and the amount of tokens deposited into the redemption contract.\n- The GRO redemption smart contracts will be accessible indefinitely, so that DAO members who deposited GRO during the 4-week collection period can claim their share whenever. A web interface for the redemption contract will be actively supported for 3 months, and then kept indefinitely on IPFS.\n\n**V. Budget and Team**\n- For 3 months, Groda proposes a budget of 180,000 USDC that will be transferred to the Groda Product Pod’s operational wallet if approved: 5 full-time contributors’ compensation (current Groda team): 155,000 USDC over 3 months\n- Service provider and operating expenses (e.g., Infura, Alchemy, Gelato and other fees and expenses): 25,000 USDC over 3 months. Any remainder of this budget will be transferred back to the Treasury and made part of the redemption pool after 3 months.\n- All pods support users in exiting the protocol until January and then dissolve.\n\n**Option 2: Unwind Protocol, Continue Building**\n**I. Protocol Wind-down:** \n- See detailed description of protocol wind-down above\n\n**II. New Product Development:**\n- The initial direction for the new streamlined Groda Pod will build a synthetic asset generator backed by staked ETH. This platform will be designed to support the creation of any synthetic assets, contingent on the existence of a Chainlink oracle to ensure price stability and handle liquidation. The initial MVP will revolve around a Synthetic MemeCoin, functioning as a proof of concept and a means to generate preliminary market interest.\n- Within the 6-months period, the Groda Pod will be able to:\n-- Implement the Synthetic MemeCoin which will serve as an experimental step, with the broader vision focusing on versatile synthetic asset generation.\n-- Integrate staked ETH as the primary collateral.\n-- Establish a model for incorporating Chainlink oracles.\n-- Regular updates to the DAO on progress, challenges, and next steps.\n\n**III. Budget and Team:** \n- For 6 months, Groda proposes a budget of 245,000 USDC and 350,000 $GRO that will be transferred to the Groda Product Pod’s operational wallet if approved.\n- 2 full-time contributors’ (Kat and SHAKOTN) compensation: 170,000 USDC over 6 months\n- Outside contributions including collaborations with contributors like Haywired and specialized marketing personnel: 75,000 USDC over 6 months\n- All pod grants that the DAO has made will continue as granted although workplans will be altered. \n\n**Option 3: Reject all options**\n**I. Outcome A (Default): Continue automated strategies and stop issue monitoring.**\n- Technical operations offboarding: The Gro protocol will continue to operate without contributors that can handle risks and unforeseen events. Groda will only have few weeks to wrap up operations. This will prevent any orderly future wind down of the protocol.\n- Formulation of new strategy: FiSt Pod is responsible for formulating a new strategy for the DAO with limited assets, subject to a vote by Dec. All DAO members are invited to make proposals. \n- User Asset Accessibility: Users will be able withdraw assets even if operation is ceased.\n- Potential repercussions of this Outcome A (Default) include:\n-- Lack of User Support: Due to the limited time, risks exist around the ability to provide follow-up support for unresolved issues & assisting users in asset withdrawal and clear communication.\n-- Vulnerability in Market Volatility and Emergency situations: In the absence of active management, no one will be available to step in if, for instance, LUSD goes off-peg or USDT experiences issues.\n-- Inability to Stop Automated Strategies: If the Gro protocol continues to operate without active oversight, automated strategies may run unchecked, potentially leading to operational risks, financial losses, or system vulnerabilities that can compromise the safety and performance of the protocol.\n\n**II. Outcome B: Pods come up with alternative paths for the DAO.**\n- Hypothetical Future Proposals: All DAO members are invited to make proposals, outlining alternative strategies not considered in this assessment. This path would follow the standard governance process of the Gro DAO. \n\n**III. Team** \n- No extension of Groda Pod. The current mandate runs until 3rd of October.\n- All pod grants that the DAO has made will continue as granted although workplans will be altered. \n\n\n## Pros\n- Option 1: Clear exit strategy, asset redemption for stakeholders.\n- Option 2: Potential for new product-market fit, leaner operation.\n- Option 3: Keeps all options open for future strategies.\n\n## Cons\n- Option 1: Loss of community and product.\n- Option 2: Continued operational risk and financial expenditure.\n- Option 3: Lack of technical capabilities, increased operational risks.\n\n## Timeline & Budget\nThis vote will run for 5 days and will follow the ranked-choice voting (instant runoff voting) format as there are multiple viable options to choose from. Accordingly, users can rank their choices in order of preference. If no option receives a majority share of votes (over 50%), the option with the least amount of votes will be eliminated, and those who voted for this option will have their second choice recorded instead. This process is repeated until there is an option with a majority share of votes.\n\nYou can read more about ranked-choice voting here (https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/proposals/voting-types#ranked-choice-voting-instant-runoff-voting)\n\nThe timelines and next steps for the different options are as follows: \n- Option 1: 3 months, 180,000 USDC for the existing Groda Pod. As next step, the Groda Pod will start with the Protocol Wind-down, Treasury Consolidation, and preparing the 4-week Collection Period (as outlined in the process steps outlined in above).\n- Option 2: 6 months, 245,000 USDC + 350,000 $GRO for the streamlined Groda Pod (kd, SHAKOTN). As next step, the Groda Pod will start with the Protocol Wind-down, and shift to streamlined Product-building mode (as outlined in the process steps outlined above).\n- Option 3: No timeline or budget, Groda continues until 3rd of October. As next step, the Groda Pod will wrap up technical operations and aim to bring the protocol into automation mode. Furthermore, the FiSt Pod is tasked with formulating a new strategy for the DAO, which will be up for a vote by December. Similarly, any Pod or community member has the option to put up alternative proposals (as outlined in the process steps outlined in above).",

Topics:\n  - Web3 Governance\n  - A primer on Decentralized Finance\n  - Luxury Media\n  - How to Contribute to DAOs and Web3 Community\n  - Ask the Specialists - Gro Pod Members\n  - What’s new with Gro DAO\n  - Explaining Vault/PWRD for the rest of us\n  - The Future of DeFi\n  - The Future of GroDAO\n  - The Future of Gro Protocol\n- After episodes are completed, rest of funding ($1750 USDC) will be received\n\n#### Option 2: 2 Episode Series\n- Receive $650 USDC to the Podcast Network Pod Multi-sig\n  - Multi-sig will be a 3-of-5 consisting of 2 members from the Podcast Network Pod, 1 member from People Pod, and 2 members from the Gro DAO discord community at large\n- Finalise guests and topic order\n- Produce 2 episodes over the course of 2 months. Topics:\n  - The Future of Gro Protocol versus the future of DeFi\n  - Contributing to DAOs\n\n### Composition\nMiss Homie\n- BanklessDAO Contributor, GroDAO OG\n- Produced Podcast Series in 2017 - Tech Homie and Friends\n- Operations for Crypto Sapiens\n- Contributor to Podcast Hatchery\n\nEureka John\n- BanklessDAO Contribuor\n- Owner - [EurekaStreetCrypto](https://eurekastreetxyz.wordpress.com/)\n- Producer - Crypto Sapiens, Other Podcasts\n- Contributor - PodsDAO\n\nDeborah \n- GroDAO OG - Marketing\n\nMrrpiusz\n- GroDAO OG\n- Creative Designer - Arenaweb3\n- Twitter Operator - StafiProtocol\n\n## Pros\n- Increased outreach for the web3 community at large\n- Exposure to potential partnerships \n- Learning opportunities for gromies and for the web3 community at large\n- A new opportunities for interested community members to participate and contribute to the DAO\n- A chance for members who have left the project/protocol to see the upcoming growth of the project/dao/protocol, this is a way to promote web3 citizens to join the community and build awareness about Gro DAO, which is something that is desperately needed from responses given in the [GroDAO Sentiment Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kzI-DJDnlBtrAMqSA4xOYKArydM73zfSKjhcWtiQLQM/edit?usp=forms_home&ths=true)\n- Aligns with the mission of Gro DAO to make Web3 more accessible\n\n## Cons\n- Even though the series will have 10 episodes, this idea is a test. This series will be used to flesh out the idea of a podcast and help train members in GroDAO to produce podcasts in the community. While it is necessary to establish this process to help assist the cause, there is a potential that the test could fail to gain the traction intended for the outside community within the 10 episodes allotted.\n\n## Timeline & Voting\n-Vote 36 will run for 5 days and will follow the ranked-choice voting (instant runoff voting) format as there are 3 viable options to choose from. Accordingly, users can rank their choices in order of preference. If no option receives a majority share of votes (over 50%), the option with the least amount of votes will be eliminated, and those who voted for this option will have their second choice recorded instead.\n\nYou can read more about ranked-choice voting [here](https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/proposals/voting-types#ranked-choice-voting-instant-runoff-voting).\n\nIf vote 36 passes, the team will begin construction on the first episode, with a projected launch date of October 2nd. \n\nCommunity Members will have the opportunity to have their say on the topics of the episodes.

      "content": "## Summary\n- The proposal aims to whitelist a vault for lending USDC to the Flux Finance Lending Pool\n- For a detailed description, please refer to the [GRFC forum post](https://community.gro.xyz/t/grfc-whitelist-flux-lending-strategy-for-use-in-gro-protocol/579)\n\n## Voting Options\n- FOR: Approve the strategy for whitelisting on Gro Protocol\n- AGAINST: Do not approve the strategy for whitelisting on Gro Protocol\n- ABSTAIN: No opinion on approving this strategy for whitelisting on Gro Protocol\n\n## Implementation\n- Add the fUSDC Flux Finance Strategy to the list of whitelisted strategies.\n- Implement the mechanism, which will allow Gro Protocol funds to be allocated to this strategy\n- Rebalance the Gro Protocol and allocate funds to the fUSDC Flux Finance Strategy (if applicable)\n\n## Pros\n- The stability of Flux's tokenized Treasuries minimizes the risk of bad debt\n- Ondo Finance's self-sustaining approach, prioritizing essential financial services over external incentives, solidifies the project's enduring viability\n- The introduction of a newly whitelisted protocol  would empower Gro Protocol with an enhanced and diversified strategy allocation, expanding the selection beyond Curve pools\n\n## Cons\n- While the lending interest rates for supplying are competitive compared to larger money market protocols, the on-chain adoption appears to be relatively limited\n\n## Timeline & Next Steps\nVote 35 will run for 5 days on a simple majority basis. \n\nIf Vote 35 is passed, the fUSDC Flux Finance strategy will be added to the protocol whitelist, meaning there is DAO authority to allocate protocol funds (within the maximum Vault exposures).\n\nFuture strategies can be suggested and voted on by the DAO, and at any time community members can also propose a removal of a strategy from the current whitelist.",

      "content": "## Summary\nThis proposal is for Gro DAO to allow the Panda Pod to continue operating for another 6-month term, with a funding request of 282,000 USDC; OR to extend its current term by 1-month, with a funding request of 55,000 USDC.\n\nSee [GRFC: Panda Pod 2nd Term Proposal](https://community.gro.xyz/t/grfc-panda-pod-2nd-term-proposal/575) for complete details.\n\n## Voting Options\n- Fund Panda Pod for another 6-month term\n- Extend Panda Pod’s existing term for 1 more month to audit and release the deposit relayer\n- Reject all options\n\n## Implementation\nPanda Pod previously completed the [testnet](https://d3opz0fqbl3oyn.cloudfront.net/?k=ArbitrumGoerliDemo) of the deposit relayer, which reduces the gas fees that are needed to use Gro DAO products. This will enable Gro DAO to attract users with token holdings on non-Etheruem chains, including Arbitrum and Optimism. Additionally, Panda Pod introduced research into 3 strategies ([lvUSD](https://www.notion.so/grodao/lvUSD-thinking-1472d2d6601746be990e7a7e547d3f1b?pvs=4), [crvUSD/USDT, crvUSD/USDC](https://www.notion.so/grodao/crvUSD-pool-strategies-69a567f7497f44e9b674adf519899645)) as well as built a [backlog](https://www.notion.so/grodao/List-of-current-strategies-on-ETH-4282046be1da4246955fb3a1bc1c9758?pvs=4) of promising other strategies to evaluate.\n\n### Option 1: 6 month term\nBy approving the full 6 month term, the DAO will enable Panda Pod to complete the cross chain relayer audit and offer the first new product offering from Gro DAO to the community in recent times. Additionally, Panda Pod will focus on researching and implementing new strategies (if DAO approved) that will increase the APYs offered by PWRD and GVT and address the core critical problem with the Gro Protocol today. Objectives will include: \n- Complete audit on deployer\n- Launch the cross-chain deposit relayer\n- Introduce new strategies to DAO and put forward the proposals to whitelist those opportunities\n- Build out protocol support for strategies with other yield token than 3crv (including building modules that manage slippage and check price oracles)\n- Implement the whitelisted strategies approved by Gro DAO\n- Further strengthen the strategy allocation framework started by Levi (Groda Pod)\n- Setup the stop loss logic and review with other pods\n- Update monitoring and alerting service to add new critical checkpoints for whitelisted strategies\n- Support emergency multi-sig to cover more time zones.\n- Design and implementation of new version of alerting system to help monitor the rebalance key check points\n\nIf this option is selected by the DAO, the 2nd Panda Pod term would run from 24 August, 2023 to 24 February, 2024.\n\n### Option 2: 1 month extension\nBy approving the 1 month extension, Gro Dao will enable the Panda pod to complete the work on the deposit relayer and launch it with a completed audit as well as continue to demonstrate our capabilities on strategy research. At the end of the 1 month period, Panda Pod will present a refined proposal for a 6 month term renewal. Objectives will include:\n- Complete audit on deployer\n- Continue revising UI/UX based on beta testing feedback\n- Launch deposit relayer into Optimism and Arbitrum mainnet\n- Submit 1-2 additional strategies to the DAO for consideration\n\nIf this option is selected by the DAO, the Panda Pod's current term would be extended until 24 September, 2023.\n\n### Option 3: Rejection\nIn the event that the aforementioned option is not approved, the Panda team will carefully review the proposal and engage in a thorough dialogue with the community to incorporate any feedback received. This collaborative approach will enable us to refine the proposal and ultimately identify the most suitable solution that aligns with the community’s interests and expectations.\n\n## Budget\nThe budget for the 1 month extension is 55,000 USDC, including 49,000 USDC for the 6 Panda Pod contributors and 6,000 in additional budget for completing the deposit relayer audit as the best quote received and selected was in excess of the previously allocated 30,000 USDC budget in term 1.\n\nThe budget for the 6 month full term is 282,000; 276,000 USDC for the 6 Panda pod contributors and 6,000 in additional budget for completing the relayer audit.\nAny additional budget needed for strategy audits will be requested in the individual strategy whitelist votes.\n\n## Composition\nFollowing the Gro DAO collaboration framework, the Panda Product Pod will include contributors who participate in engineering and product management.\n\n4 full-time contributors and 2 part-time would form the Panda Product Pod:\n\n- WW (backend & smart contract)\n- LH (backend & smart contract)\n- VW (backend & smart contract)\n- SC (product & pod facilitator)\n- Kwww (product)\n- EW (front-end)\n\n## Timeline & Voting\nThis vote will run for 5 days and will follow the ranked-choice voting (instant runoff voting) format as there are 3 viable options to choose from. Accordingly, users can rank their choices in order of preference. If no option receives a majority share of votes (over 50%), the option with the least amount of votes will be eliminated, and those who voted for this option will have their second choice recorded instead.\n\nYou can read more about ranked-choice voting [here](https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/proposals/voting-types#ranked-choice-voting-instant-runoff-voting).",

      "title": "Vote 32: Lower Snapshot Quorum to 250k vesting GRO",
      "content": "## Summary\nThis proposal suggests lowering the off-chain Snapshot proposal quorum from 350,000 vesting GRO (~1% of [current GRO supply](https://dune.com/wint3rmute/gro-token-distribution-g2)) to vesting 250,000 GRO (~0.65% of current [current GRO supply](https://dune.com/wint3rmute/gro-token-distribution-g2)), to allow proposals to pass more easily and avoid governance paralysis. The lowered quorum can be changed again via a governance proposal in the future (ideally once Gro DAO governance becomes more decentralised and robust).\n\nSee [GRFC: Lower the off-chain Snapshot proposal quorum to 250,000 vesting GRO](https://community.gro.xyz/t/grfc-lower-the-off-chain-snapshot-proposal-quorum-to-250-000-vesting-gro/567) for full details.\n\n## Voting Options\nThis proposal only relates to the off-chain governance process, specifically the proposal quorum threshold on [Gro DAO’s Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/gro.xyz). Voting options are as follows:\n\nFOR - Lower the Snapshot quorum to 250,000 vesting GRO\nAGAINST - Do not lower the Snapshot quorum\nABSTAIN - No opinion on this proposal\n\n## Rationale\n- Reaching the recently-increased off-chain quorum ([as per Vote 26](https://vote.gro.xyz/#/proposal/0xfc01cf13bac719403e006c0a5be4c7c0425e753bfd64676a3a1cd4d91f8ee946)) on Snapshot (350,000 vesting GRO, [~1% of current GRO supply](https://dune.com/wint3rmute/gro-token-distribution-g2)) has presented a challenge.\n- Prior to [Vote 26](https://vote.gro.xyz/#/proposal/0xfc01cf13bac719403e006c0a5be4c7c0425e753bfd64676a3a1cd4d91f8ee946), the Snapshot quorum had been set at 50,000 GRO. This increase was based on the current GRO supply (vesting, vested and liquid) and extensive [research into off-chain voting in other DAOs](https://www.notion.so/Off-Chain-Governance-Process-31d5b29d639847a496d54ce762f7391c).\n- However, as demonstrated in [Vote 31](https://vote.gro.xyz/#/proposal/0xbcf8c91e14e456573a44c812309ad29f0003204a1172b0760d897319e3cec168), reaching this higher threshold has not always been successful due to current participation rates, so a lower off-chain quorum for the time being may be necessary.\n- This proposal will lower the off-chain Snapshot quorum in an attempt to help proposals to pass more easily, with less dependence on large vesting GRO holders to participate. It will allow the Gro DAO to operate more quickly and efficiently as it continues its transition towards more decentralisation.\n\n## Implementation\n- If Vote 32 is approved, the Snapshot quorum can be lowered immediately. \n- This off-chain quorum lowering is indefinite and can be adjusted back up anytime if the DAO votes to do so.\n\n## Pros\n- Quicker governance\n- Amplifies the influence of DAO contributors on governance\n\n## Cons\n- Risk of governance attacks is greater with a lower quorum. However, off-chain votes are technically non-binding so the risk is lower than in on-chain voting.\n\n## Next Steps & Timeline\n- Vote 32 will run for 5 days on a simple majority basis.\n- If Vote 32 is passed, the Snapshot quorum will be changed from 350,000 vesting GRO to 250,000 vesting GRO.",

      "title": "Vote 30: People Pod 2nd Term Proposal",
      "content": "## Summary\nThis proposal is for Gro DAO to allow the People Pod to continue operating for another 6-month term, with a funding request of 95,000 GRO.\n\nSee [GRFC: People Pod 2nd Term Proposal](https://community.gro.xyz/t/grfc-people-pod-2nd-term-proposal/555/1) for complete details.\n\n## Voting Options\n- FOR: Accept the proposal\n- AGAINST: Reject the proposal\n- ABSTAIN: No opinion on the proposal\n\n## Implementation\nThe proposal outlines the continuation of the People Pod for another 6-month term.\n\nTo date, the People Pod has facilitated DAO governance, operations, performance management, and coordination (see the [1st Term Highlights](https://community.gro.xyz/t/grfc-people-pod-2nd-term-proposal/555#budget-composition-6) section of the GRFC for full details). It has accordingly achieved an average of over 75% on both its [OKR (Objectives and Key Results) cycles](https://www.notion.so/grodao/Gro-DAO-OKR-Review-b4c62dd167254f7589fdfc83b92ab165) within this period.\n\n### Objectives\nThe People Pod is prepared to continue pushing Gro DAO along its progressive decentralisation journey while ensuring productivity and efficiency. If Vote 30 is accepted, the People Pod will focus on the following objectives over the next 6 months:\n1. Enable DAO contributors and pods to perform well and deliver on their objectives\n2. Improve governance structure (i.e. complete the ongoing meta-governance update transition) and incentivise active and long-term voter participation\n3. Improve collaboration, transparency, and education within (and beyond) Gro DAO\n4. Attract users to Gro Protocol (G2)\n5. Explore alternative legal wrapper and contributor compensation solutions\n\n### Reporting\nThe People Pod will continue providing [monthly progress updates](https://www.notion.so/2023-Monthly-Update-dc42d177aeda401595284982c5de271b), [quarterly OKR reviews](https://www.notion.so/grodao/Gro-DAO-OKR-Review-b4c62dd167254f7589fdfc83b92ab165), and frequent comms through the various community channels ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/gro_dao), [Medium](https://medium.com/gro-protocol), Discord, [Notion](https://www.notion.so/grodao/Gro-DAO-3cbc2435221f4a70b65d27392a35da03) and [Forum](https://community.gro.xyz/)) and community calls.\n\n### Composition\nRaambo will continue as the People Pod’s full-time facilitator while Jaypow, Kndlexi and Beckley will continue as part-time contributors.\n\nThe DAO community will also be incentivised to support on ad-hoc tasks via bounties.\n\n## Budget\nSee the [Budget & Composition](https://community.gro.xyz/t/grfc-people-pod-2nd-term-proposal/555#budget-composition-6) section of the GRFC for full details.\n\nIt is estimated that the People Pod will require 145,300 $USDC and 213,200 GRO to continue operating for another term.\n\nHowever, because the People Pod has an excess budget of 145,373 $USDC and 118,681 GRO from its 1st term, (if Vote 30 is accepted) it would only **require an additional 95,000 GRO (~$3,400 worth of GRO)** for its 2nd term.\n\n## Next Steps & Timeline\nVote 30 will run for 5 days on a simple majority basis. \n\nIf Vote 30 is passed, the People Pod’s 2nd 6-month term will run from July 19, 2023 - January 19, 2024.\n\nIf Vote 30 isn't passed, the People Pod will carefully review the proposal and engage in a thorough dialogue with the DAO community to incorporate any further feedback received to ultimately identify the most suitable solution that aligns with the DAO’s interests and expectations.",

While MIM did not pass vote [15B](https://snapshot.org/#/gro.xyz/proposal/0xc34ea00121fbbad6e63416484e60db1d63c1921a462764632a81be1141b03f2d) in May 2022, a re-evaluation has determined that it now meets the [Gro Protocol Yield Strategy framework](https://docs.gro.xyz/gro-docs/pwrd_vault/system-exposure/yield-strategies#understanding-yield-strategies) requirements.\n\n## Next Steps\nThis vote will run for 5 **days**.\n\nIf Vote 29 is passed, the MIM-3CRV strategy will be added to the protocol whitelist, meaning there is DAO authority to allocate protocol funds (within the maximum Vault exposures).\n\nFuture strategies can be suggested and voted on by the DAO, and at any time community members can also propose a removal of a strategy from the current [whitelist](https://docs.gro.xyz/gro-docs/pwrd_vault/system-exposure/yield-strategies#understanding-yield-strategies).",

      "content": "## Summary\nThis proposal is for Gro DAO to allow the FiSt Pod (Finance and Strategy Pod) to continue operating for another 6-month term, with an additional funding request of 27,000 USDC and 8,000 $GRO.\n\nHaving been open for comments for over 6 days as a [RFC Forum Post](https://community.gro.xyz/t/rfc-fist-pod-2nd-term-proposal/540/8) (where you can read the full proposal), the proposal will now be open for voting on Snapshot for 5 days.\n\n## DAO members can either vote:\n- FOR: Extend FiSt Pod for another 6-month term\n- AGAINST: Reject proposal\n- ABSTAIN: No opinion on this proposal\n\n## Implementation\nThe proposal outlines the continuation of the FiSt Pod for another 6-month term, with an emphasis on Finance and Product Strategy.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the Pod is to secure the long-term survival of the Gro DAO by setting up a sustainable finance function, supporting the implementation of new products, and providing clear communication on these matters to the DAO.\n\n#### Focus Areas\n1. Treasury Management: Treasury allocation recommendations, treasury management rebalancing, treasury strategy whitelist sourcing\n2. Product Strategy: Support Groda Pod in product strategy and ideation, support with execution of analytical-heavy tasks and research work\n3. Strategic Finance: financial reporting and cash flow optimisation\n4. Operational Coverage of Protocol Strategy Rebalancing\n\n#### Composition\nThe Pod will consist of Bernard as part-time contributor and facilitator covering deliverables for these focus areas and dedicated support resources from the w3s team (a strategic crypto advisory firm). \n\nThe Pod aims to reserve a budget for topic-specific support from external resources or emergent high-priority tasks (as described below).\n\n#### Timeline and Budget\nFor its next proposed 6-month term, FiSt Pod will require 30,000 USDC + 40,000 $GRO for Bernard as contributor and facilitator. \n\nIt will also require a contingency budget of 30,000 USDC for any additional need for contributions (expenditure of this additional budget will always be synchronised with People Pod prior to spending).\n\nBecause its current term has ended with budget surplus of ~33,000 USDC and ~32,000 $GRO, if the proposed extension for a 2nd term is approved by the DAO, a total of 27,000 USDC + 8,000 $GRO will be transferred from the Gro DAO Treasury to the FiSt Pod's operational wallet.\n\n#### Reporting\nFiSt Pod will update the DAO on its progress via monthly reports and quarterly OKR reviews; and regularly through the community channels such as Community Forum, Discord, and Telegram.\n\n## Next Steps\nThis vote will run for 5 days on a simple majority basis.\n\nIf Vote 28 is passed, the FiSt Pod's multi-sig will be topped up with the requested amount, and its 2nd 6-month term will run from: July 10, 2023 - January 10, 2024.\n\nIf Vote 28 isn't passed, FiSt Pod will carefully review the proposal and engage in a thorough dialogue with the community to incorporate any further feedback received to ultimately identify the most suitable solution that aligns with the community’s interests and expectations.",

This is in line with similar [emergency multi-sigs within other DAOs](https://www.notion.so/grodao/Study-of-Emergency-Multi-Sigs-075b36cdb2064611b04fc2d4ed17f37f). \n\nIf a selected committee member is not performing as expected, as detailed in the ‘Requirements & Responsibilities’ section in this separate [RFC Forum Post](https://community.gro.xyz/t/grfc-call-for-applications-emergency-multi-sig-signers-election-meta-governance-update-sub-proposal-3/535); they can be voted out by the Emergency Multi-Sig Committee or by the DAO through a Snapshot vote, and replaced through a Snapshot vote.\n\nThe emergency multi-sig will be assigned (as a ‘keeper’) to limited, DAO-approved smart contract functions for emergencies over time, specifically:\n- Convex Strategy contracts’ functions:\n   - setEmergencyMode → *to pull assets out of a protocol strategy*\n   - runHarvest → *to run harvests*\n   - stopLoss → *to execute stop loss*\n- Guard contract’s functions:\n   - setStopLossPrimer → *to set stop loss*\n   - endStopLossPrimer → *to end stop loss*\n   - executeStopLoss → *to execute stop loss*\n   - harvest → *to run harvests*\n- Governor contract’s functions (if on-chain governance is approved by the DAO)\n   - cancel → *to cancel on-chain governance proposals*\n\n## Pros\n- As Gro DAO progressively adopts on-chain governance, the emergency multi-sig will be configured to protect the DAO against governance attacks (i.e. cancelling malicious on-chain governance proposals).\n- The emergency multi-sig can also conduct a range of emergency protocol functions in rare instances which may require immediate action (e.g. running harvests, executing stop losses, and withdrawing from failing protocol strategies in case of emergency or automation failures).\n- To clarify, as agreed in [Vote 26](https://vote.gro.xyz/#/proposal/0xfc01cf13bac719403e006c0a5be4c7c0425e753bfd64676a3a1cd4d91f8ee946) and further detailed in the [What is Governed by Who](https://www.notion.so/grodao/What-is-Governed-by-Who-2329c150fbed4068906e18d49b14ae58) guide; the DAO will make all key treasury, meta-governance, tokenomic, and protocol- related decisions following the standard governance process (taking up to 11 days); while the objective of the Emergency Multi-Sig is to serve as a safety precaution in rare instances where a quicker turnaround is required.\n- By being composed of elected non-pod and unique pod contributors, as well as having a 4-of-7 pool of signers, the emergency multi-sig distributes its power across Gro DAO to minimise any chance of collusion.\n\n## Cons\n- Signers may not be able to act as swiftly as desired in all situations, though this should be mitigated by having DAO-approved signers spread across time zones and meeting a high standard of responsibilities (explained in this separate [RFC Forum Post](https://community.gro.xyz/t/grfc-call-for-applications-emergency-multi-sig-signers-election-meta-governance-update-sub-proposal-3/535/1)).\n- The setup of the emergency multi-sig is a safety precaution, and must therefore prioritise efficiency over complete decentralisation. As Gro DAO matures, removing some of (or adding to) the emergency multi-sig’s powers is something the DAO can choose to pursue. \n\n\n## Next Steps\nThis vote will run for 5 days on a simple majority basis.\n\nIf Vote 27 is passed, a proposal to elect the Emergency Multi-Sig Committee members will be set up (see this separate [RFC Forum Post](https://community.gro.xyz/t/grfc-call-for-applications-emergency-multi-sig-signers-election-meta-governance-update-sub-proposal-3/535) for further details), and the respective multi-sig wallet will be configured as described in this proposal.\n\nIf Vote 27 is not passed, the People Pod will carefully review the proposal and engage in a thorough dialogue with the community to incorporate any further feedback received.",

      "title": "Vote 26: Require GRO tokens to be locked to vote, and define off-chain governance processes",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nFor Gro DAO to become more robust, trustless and decentralised, it should move towards on-chain governance.\n\nTo do so, it must first ensure that its long-term interests are aligned with those of its members. This can be done by ***only allowing locked GRO tokens (i.e. [vesting tokens](https://medium.com/gro-protocol/gro-rewards-and-vesting-737c6d34113e) that are still not vested) to vote***. In other words, it is being proposed that a DAO member can only participate in DAO governance if they lock up the tokens they wish to use towards voting, in a [vesting contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x748218256AfE0A19a88EBEB2E0C5Ce86d2178360#readContract).\n\nThe DAO should also agree on what requires DAO governance, and in particular, ***ratify what should be governed by who***. [This table](https://www.notion.so/grodao/What-is-Governed-by-Who-2329c150fbed4068906e18d49b14ae58) illustrates what is currently governed and executed by who, and proposes how this should look in a future where on-chain governance is approved by the DAO. It is worth noting that even if and when automatic on-chain governance execution is enabled, not all actions can or should be configured for automated execution immediately.\n\nIt is also important to ***ratify the off-chain governance process***. This will cover the steps to raise and vote on a proposal when only vesting GRO counts towards votes and where on-chain governance cannot be used to implement the resulting actions (either because it is not approved by the DAO or because the respective proposal would not result in an on-chain action, as illustrated in [this table](https://www.notion.so/grodao/What-is-Governed-by-Who-2329c150fbed4068906e18d49b14ae58)). In such instances, this proposed [off-chain governance process](https://www.notion.so/grodao/Off-Chain-Governance-Process-31d5b29d639847a496d54ce762f7391c) would be used:\n\n1. Discuss in Discord at #governance channel\n2. Write a Gro Request For Comments (GRFC) on [Gro DAO Forum](http://community.gro.xyz/), following these [guidelines](https://www.notion.so/GRO-Request-For-Comments-GRFC-Forum-Post-Template-95908b4098034f8a8133ec10332458ea) on writing GRFCs, and use the poll feature to conduct an informal signalling vote\n3. After at least **[6 days]** of GRFC, if feedback has been implemented and there is a general consensus (as determined by GRFC feedback and by at least **[15 members]** participating in a passing signalling vote) that the proposal should be taken to vote, addresses with **[175,000+ vesting or delegated vesting GRO tokens]** (~0.5% of circulating GRO Supply), or whitelisted addresses; can initiate the proposal on Gro DAO’s [Snapshot](http://vote.gro.xyz/), using this [Proposal Description Template](https://www.notion.so/Proposal-Template-4435c485d68844dfb736d06429043d85)\n4. The vote would be live for at least **[5 days]** for off-chain voting on Snapshot, and would need to meet a quorum of **[350,000 vesting GRO]** (~1% of circulating GRO Supply) and a passing rate of over **[50%]**\n5. A successful vote would have **[3 days]** of timelock for implementation (if applicable), allowing time for emergency multi-sig to act if there’s a malicious attack\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreibfdbq5yiqdmldua5itftycc5jmby337s5plgf3ra2os4ulkyw6wa)\n***A full in-depth description of this proposal can be found [here](https://community.gro.xyz/t/grfc-require-gro-tokens-to-be-locked-to-vote-and-define-off-chain-governance-processes-meta-governance-update-sub-proposal-1/528).***\n\n# Explanation of each voting option\nThis proposal marks the initial step in a multi-step meta-governance update for Gro DAO. It proposes to:\n- Allow only locked GRO tokens (i.e. vesting tokens that are still not vested) to vote;\n- Ratify what should be governed by who, and;\n- Ratify off-chain governance process\n\nAccordingly, DAO members can either vote:\n- FOR: approve the proposal\n- AGAINST: do not approve the proposal\n- ABSTAIN: no opinion on this proposal\n\n# Implementation\n***On-chain action:*** allow only locked GRO tokens (i.e. vesting tokens that are still not vested) to vote, by setting the voting weight for liquid GRO on the [vote aggregator contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x156d9aaD5975Ec9Aa9E2C621F408C8469D0D6953#readContract) to 0.\n\n***Off-chain action:*** Ratify (the current and proposed distinctions of) [what should be governed by who](https://www.notion.so/grodao/What-is-Governed-by-Who-2329c150fbed4068906e18d49b14ae58), as documented.\n\n***Off-chain action:*** Ratify [off-chain governance process](https://www.notion.so/grodao/Off-Chain-Governance-Process-31d5b29d639847a496d54ce762f7391c), as documented, by:\n- Changing Snapshot proposal threshold from 1,000,000 to 175,000 GRO\n- Changing Snapshot quorum from 50,000 to 350,000 GRO\n\n***Off-chain action:*** Add the [with-delegation](https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/delegation) strategy to the Gro DAO Snapshot space.\n\n# Benefits (Pros)\n\nAllow only locked GRO tokens (i.e. vesting tokens that are still not vested) to vote:\n- Greater alignment between the DAO and its members\n- Further incentivises longer-term commitments to the DAO\n- Reduced risk of governance attack ahead of on-chain governance implementation which enables the Snapshot proposal threshold to be reduced (from 1,000,000 to 175,000 vesting GRO)\n\nRatify what should be governed by who:\n- Greater clarity on current and future governance processes\n- Further streamlining of DAO operations\n- Provides context for forthcoming meta-governance update proposals\n\nRatify off-chain governance process:\n- Greater clarity on off-chain governance process\n- Easier to meet proposal and quorum thresholds, and increase total voter participation by enabling voter delegation\n\n# Downsides (Cons)\n- Greater operational overhead\n- More complicated processes that need to be understood by DAO members\n- Higher quorum threshold (350,000 GRO) to be met for future proposals to be passed on Snapshot\n- Gas fees required to lock GRO tokens and to claim vesting rewards\n\n# Next Steps\n\nThis vote will run for 5 days on a simple majority basis.\n\nIf the proposal is not passed, the People Pod will carefully review the proposal and engage in a thorough dialogue with the community to incorporate any further feedback received.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n",

      "title": "Vote 25: Groda Product Pod Extension Proposal",
      "content": "### Summary\nThis proposal is for Gro DAO to enable the Groda Product Pod to continue operating (either with existing or additional funding), with three options to vote from:\n\n1. Extend Groda Pod’s existing term for 1 more month (using existing remaining budget)\n2. Fund Groda Pod for another 6-month term\n3. Reject all options\n\nHaving been open for comments for 3 days on the [Community Discourse Forum](https://community.gro.xyz/t/groda-product-pod-2nd-term-proposal/514), the proposal will now be open for voting for 5 days.\n\n### Groda Pod Product Direction\nAs detailed in the previous [temperature check](https://community.gro.xyz/t/temperature-check-first-term-review-of-groda-product-pod/478), the Groda Pod has successfully launched G2 and decentralised its core services, among other achievements. However, the Groda Pod has not yet decided on the next major product to develop. Despite researching various topics such as On-chain Pawn-Shop, Community-led Asset Management, Wallet Analytics, Tokenised RWAs, and more; the pod has not yet gained strong conviction on these ideas.\n\nThe Groda Pod aims to carefully choose the most appropriate path forward, in alignment with Gro DAO’s values of creating high-impact products for its users. To facilitate this decision, the Groda Pod will establish a dedicated process for identifying Web3 trends, evaluating conviction within the pod, and assessing market demand and user desirability.\n\nCurrently, the Groda Pod’s most promising ideas for its next product include a Smart Contract Wallet SDK based on ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction) and a decentralised stablecoin backed by staked ETH as collateral with algorithmic market operations. However, the Groda Pod wants to conduct further research and validation before committing to these or other ideas.\n\nGiven that the next product idea is still undecided, the DAO can choose between three options:\n\n### Proposal Voting Options\n#### 1. Extend current mandate: 1 Month\n\nBy approving a 1-month extension of Groda Pod’s current term, Gro DAO will enable the Groda Pod to allocate the existing budget surplus towards funding an additional month of operations. This extension will provide the necessary time for the Groda Pod to continue its product discovery efforts, with the aim of gaining more market validation and conviction. At the end of the 1-month period, the Groda Pod will present a refined proposal for a 6-month term renewal, based on the comprehensive research conducted during the extension period.\n\nDuring this 1-month extension, the Groda Pod will focus on the following activities:\n\n- Conduct in-depth product discovery to identify and propose the next high-impact product idea for the Groda Pod to concentrate on, in alignment with Gro DAO’s objectives\n- Implement the Governor Bravo framework to enhance the decentralisation of core protocol functionalities, further empowering the community to make collective decisions\n- Maintain and ensure the safety, security, and accuracy of the G2 platform, upholding its reliability for users\n- Concentrate on achieving the current set of [Groda Pod’s Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)](https://www.notion.so/grodao/Groda-Product-Pod-OKRs-c6ef6418533c4622ba25a0be3eb65f1f) to maximise the impact and value of the pod’s initiatives\n- Deploy G2 on an additional chain and further modularise key components to create a tranching “DeFi Lego Block”\n\n*Budget:*\n\nGroda Pod has a projected budget surplus of ~200k USDC from its current term (September 2022 - March 2023). If the DAO approves a 1-month extension, the Groda Pod will use 63,667 USDC for its monthly contributor compensation, and the rest of the budget will be reconciled and returned to the DAO treasury at the end of the month.\n\n#### 2. New Mandate: 6 Months\n\nWith the Gro DAO’s funding support, the Groda Pod will be able to:\n\n- Explore and validate current product ideas, including but not limited to: Smart Contract Wallet SDK (ERC-4337 / Account Abstraction); Decentralised Stablecoin (staked ETH with Algorithmic Market Operations)\n- Launch the OnRamp Comparator publicly, incorporating user feedback and utilising quantitative data to drive iterative improvements\n- Implement the Governor Bravo framework to further decentralise core protocol functionalities, allowing GRO token holders to participate in collective on-chain decision-making processes\n- Ensure the ongoing safety, security, and accuracy of the G2 platform for a reliable user experience\n- Concentrate on achieving an updated set of Groda Pod’s Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) to maximise the impact and value of the pod’s initiatives\n- Deploy G2 on an additional chain and further modularise key components to create a tranching “DeFi Lego Block”\n\n*Budget:*\n\nFor the next 6 months, Groda Pod proposes a budget of 382,000 USDC that will be transferred to the Groda Pod’s operational wallet if approved.\n\nFor checks and balances, the operational wallet is a 3-out-of-5 multi-sig with 2 full-time contributors in the Groda Pod and 3 contributors from other Pods (with two from the People Pod).\n\n- 6 full-time contributors’ compensation: 350,000 USDC over 6 months\n- Service provider and operating expenses (e.g., Infura, Alchemy, Gelato and other fees and expenses): 32,000 USDC over 6 months\n\nGroda Pod will have a projected budget surplus of approximately 200k USDC from its current term (September 2022 - March 2023) which will be reconciled and returned to the DAO treasury. In case of approval of the extension for the 2nd term, the Groda Pod will be requesting a total amount of 382,000 USDC from the Gro Dao Treasury to the Groda Pod's operational wallet.\n\n#### 3. Reject proposal\n\nIn the event that the aforementioned options (1-month extension or 6-month renewal) are not approved, the Groda Pod will carefully review the proposal and engage in a thorough dialogue with the community to incorporate any further feedback received. This collaborative approach will enable us to refine the proposal and ultimately identify the most suitable solution that aligns with the community’s interests and expectations.\n\n### Voting\nThis vote will run for 5 days and will follow the ranked-choice voting (instant runoff voting) format as there are 3 viable options to choose from. \n\nAccordingly, users can rank their choices in order of preference. If no option receives a majority share of votes (over 50%), the option with the least amount of votes will be eliminated, and those who voted for this option will have their second choice recorded instead. \n\nYou can read more about ranked-choice voting [here](https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/proposals/voting-types#ranked-choice-voting-instant-runoff-voting).\n\n### Composition of the Pod\nFollowing the [Gro DAO collaboration framework](https://grodao.notion.site/Gro-DAO-Structure-387b226c7a32409185b85b0154ebf511), the Groda Pod will include contributors who participate in engineering, product design, and product management. The pod may also expand to those who contribute on a part-time or bounty basis (i.e. through the new OG Programme).\n\n6 (full-time) contributors would form the Groda Pod:\n\n- Jimemart (frontend)\n- SHAKOTN (backend & smart contract)\n- Kat (smart contract)\n- Wint3rmute (backend)\n- Haywired (design)\n- SAS (product & pod facilitator)\n\n### Improved goal-setting and coordination\nThe Groda Pod has recognised the need to improve its focus on delivering high-value results and executing them faster. To address this, the pod has implemented dedicated [Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)](https://grodao.notion.site/Groda-Product-Pod-OKRs-c6ef6418533c4622ba25a0be3eb65f1f) and is using the Coordinape platform to enhance accountability, establish short feedback loops, and recognise skills and behaviours that drive impactful outcomes.\n\nThe Groda Pod is eager to receive feedback and encourages active participation from the community in shaping the future of its endeavours, ultimately fostering a collaborative environment that drives the success of Gro DAO’s mission.",

      "title": "Vote 24: Fund Panda Product Pod",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposes to establish and fund a second product pod, known as the Panda Product Pod. As initially detailed by Cryptomac on the [Community Forum](https://community.gro.xyz/t/panda-product-pod-proposal/458), the Panda Product Pod will specifically focus on cross-chain liquidity, strategy creation, and data aggregation. It will consist of 6 contributors and will be funded with 300,000 USDC + 150,000 GRO, if approved by the DAO. \n\n## Background\n\nThe Panda Product Pod’s objectives are to create, open-source, and maintain reusable building block modules that can be utilised by Gro and others in the DeFi ecosystem to build better dApp experiences. As previous participants in the Groda Product Pod, the Panda Pod believe that creating more localised product pods will better achieve the DAO's mission to enable more people to participate in DeFi. \n\nSpecifically, the pod has 3 areas where it believes that it can create meaningful differentiation for Gro DAO and attract more usage: cross-chain liquidity, strategy creation, and data aggregation. \n\nAccordingly, the Panda Product Pod will:\n- Launch a Deposit Relayer that allows users to deposit assets on a chain with cheaper gas fees and have those assets bridged to Ethereum to be utilised by the Gro Protocol as well as future products to be released by Gro DAO.\n- Explore strategies that unlock access to cross-chain yield opportunities, enabling users to deposit into a Gro vault on any chain.\n- Create and maintain additional vault strategies on Ethereum for Gro Protocol to increase yields and diversify risks, thereby increasing interest in the protocol.\n- Explore the DAO’s interest in creating open-source modules that allow other protocols, as well as the DAO’s own Risk Pod, to gather and utilise on-chain data more effectively. \n\n## Composition & Budget\nPanda Product Pod will consist of 6 contributors who participate in engineering, product design, and product management:\n- BZ (backend & smart contracts)\n- LH (backend)\n- WW (backend)\n- Kwww (product manager)\n- VW (full-stack)\n- YQ (designer)\n\nThese contributors have experience building products and tooling across multiple DeFi protocols on multiple chains (Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum) and will utilise their collective experiences to lower the barrier to utilising the Gro protocol. \n\nFor the next 6 months (13 February 2023 - 13 August 2023), the proposed budget is 300,000 USDC + 150,000 GRO (as detailed in the [Community Forum](https://community.gro.xyz/t/panda-product-pod-proposal/458/12)) that will be transferred to the Panda Product Pod's operational wallet if approved. Any unused budget will be returned to the DAO Treasury at the end of the 6 months.\n\nThe operational wallet will be a 3-of-5 multi-sig wallet consisting of 2 Panda Product Pod contributors, 2 People Pod contributors, and 1 Groda Pod contributor.\n\n## Reporting\nPanda Product Pod will update the DAO on its progress via quarterly reports and regularly through the community channels such as Community Forum, Discord, and Telegram. \n\n## Next Steps\nThis vote will run for 5 days on a simple majority basis.\n\n",

No objections have been raised.\n \nMandate\n-------\n \nAs Gro DAO [further decentralises](https://community.gro.xyz/t/one-year-in-decentralising-gro/375), I propose forming the Groda Product Pod to:\n \n-   Extend functionality of Gro's yield and risk tranching protocol including launching the new version named G^2\n \n-   Create new products that facilitate the DAO's mission to empower people to get more from DeFi. E.g. onramp comparator that is currently in testing.\n \n-   Maintain and operate existing smart contracts\n \n-   Ensure the safety and correctness of product design and implementation\n \nThis would lay the foundation to recruiting and retaining engineers, product manager(s), and product designer(s) to work for Gro protocol and other products that aim to advance the DAO's mission.\n \nAs security is crucial to any web3 products, smart contract audits would also be under the Groda Product Pod's purview in addition to design & development work.\n \nComposition\n-----------\n \nFollowing the framework suggested in this [post](https://community.gro.xyz/t/get-involved-in-gro-dao-s-new-collaboration-structure/378), the Groda Product Pod will include individual and entity contributors alike who participate in engineering, product design, and product management. It would include existing contributors who work on a full-time basis. The pod could also expand to those who contribute on a part-time or bounty basis once Gro's Github is open.\n \n9 existing contributors would form the initial Groda Product Pod:\n-   Bin (backend & smart contracts)\n-   Haywired (design)\n-   Jimemart (frontend)\n-   Kat (smart contract)\n-   Lily (backend)\n-   SAS (product)\n-   Wei (backend)\n-   Wint3rmute (data)\n-   Wojak (data & analytics)\n\nI would also propose myself (SAS) as the Groda Product Pod's facilitator. My current role as Product Lead has offered me a broad end-to-end view of user research and protocol development. This has positioned me well in facilitating day-to-day decision making in developing the protocol and adjacent products. Before Gro, I was an engineer and then a product leader in web3, FinTech and InsurTech for more than 7 years.\n \nBudget\n------\n \nFor the next 6 months, I propose a budget of 610,000 USDC that will be transferred to the Groda Product Pod operational wallet if approved.\n \nFor check and balance, the operational wallet will be a 3-out-of-5 multi-sig with 2 full-time contributors in the Groda Product Pod and 3 contributors in the People Pod as signers. To facilitate day-to-day operating expense payment, the 2 full-time Groda Product Pod contributors will be designated as beneficiaries to a spending limit on Gnosis Safe. The spending limit is defined as all budget to be sent to operational multi-sig listed below excluding the full-time contributor cost. The full-time contributor cost will require at least 1 signer from the People Pod for payment -- it should by default be paid out unless the pod acts maliciously, goes missing, or otherwise goes off-path.\n \nIts address and signers will be published once set up for transparency.\n \n-   8.3 full-time contributors: 486,000 USDC over 6 months\n \n-   This covers the contributors named above and includes the facilitator compensation\n \n-   This will supersede what was approved in [Vote 12](https://vote.gro.xyz/#/proposal/0x3a150d871ffd332b6c7774d990319844132d614903379cfa50989c536e92e411)\n \n-   Bounty or part-time contributors: 112,000 USDC over 6 months\n \n-   Service provider spend (e.g., Infura, Alchemy): 12,000 USDC over 6 months\n \nI also propose to transfer the following operating expense to the Groda Product Pod's management if this vote is approved.\n \n-   8 WETH per month (smart contract gas spend) approved in [Vote 11](https://vote.gro.xyz/#/proposal/0x0b6839e611750da1158df30324b45ae6ed4d4e2ef5d8b17f366c271b1b6ba02e)\n \n-   Harvesting is implemented through Gelato. Currently it is topped up as needed through requests made directly to the DAO treasury.\n\n-   For ease of implementation, I suggest transferring the USDC amount equivalent of the approved budget for ETH to the Groda Pod operational wallet in one go, so that the DAO treasury does not need to convene monthly to acquire ETH\n\n-   Based on ETH price at $1300 i.e. (1300 USDC *8)*6 months = 62,400 USDC\n \n-   The sum of 62,400 USDC will be transferred to the Groda Product Pod operational wallet if the vote is approved. As these are earmarked for volatile assets, any excess amount should be returned to the DAO treasury; in case of a shortfall, the DAO treasury would also have a mandate to transfer the outstanding amount to the Operational Wallet without a further vote.\n \nGiven the above figures, the spending limit under the 2 Groda Product Pod signers' complete discretion would be (112,000 + 12,000 + 62,400) = 186,400 USDC.\n \nActual spend will be reconciled with the budget at the end of the 6-month period i.e. end of March 2023. Any unspent budget will be returned to the DAO treasury after the reconciliation.\n\nAdditionally, there are other approved budgets that are closely related to the proposed Groda Product Pod mandate. I propose these to remain under the DAO treasury for direct payout under the direction of Groda Product Pod.\n \n-   $1mn Immunefi bounty approved in [Vote 3](https://vote.gro.xyz/#/proposal/0x15126e9584299a9751e1d4d7d8fcc248ca54499aa7679305e353a325fc957e58) (ongoing)\n \n-   $320k audit expenses approved in [Vote 3](https://vote.gro.xyz/#/proposal/0x15126e9584299a9751e1d4d7d8fcc248ca54499aa7679305e353a325fc957e58) (audit has been completed; this should be paid out within the next few weeks)\n \nReporting\n---------\n \nGroda Product Pod will update the DAO on its progress regularly through the community channels such as Community Forum, Discord, and Telegram.\n \nIn addition, there will be a quarterly report to summarise progress achieved and high-level plans for the next 3 months on the Community Forum. The second quarterly progress report will coincide with the 6-monthly budget report outlining actual spend and proposing budget for the next 6 months.\n \nVoting process\n--------------\n \nFOR: Approve the budget requested by Groda Product Pod\n\nAGAINST: Do not approve the budget requested by Groda Product Pod\n\nABSTAIN: No opinion on approving this budget\n \nNext steps\n----------\n \nThis vote will run for 5 days on a simple majority basis.",

      "title": "Vote 17: Implement stop loss at 4% (400bps) slippage for any given pool",
      "content": "*Note: this threshold is proposed so that a stop-loss trigger should not be needed (based on historical data), and instead acts as an emergency exit route in an extreme worst case scenario.*\n\n### Background to Gro protocol Convex / Curve LP strategies\n-   Gro protocol strategies currently provide liquidity to Curve pools through Convex\n-   Each of these pools include an 'exotic' stablecoin (e.g. FRAX) paired with 3CRV\n-   The respective prices of assets in a Curve pool can change in relation to the weights of the assets in the pool, and broadly reflects the price in the market of that asset (although this can vary)\n-   When assets are withdrawn from a strategy and the 'exotic' stablecoin is underweight in the pool, then slippage (a negative return) is realised in the protocol (more on this below).\n\n### Stop losses for strategies\n-   Prices of stablecoins often fluctuate, this leads to trading of those assets in Curve pools which generate fees for the Curve LPs. This is a good thing.\n-   However if the price of an asset drops relative to DAI/USDC/USDT and doesn't recover, this will lead to an enduring loss since Gro protocol delivers returns to its users as DAI, USDC or USDC.\n-   Implementing automated stop-losses will allow the protocol to cut losses before they grow too large, but may also result in taking losses on assets that eventually recover.\n\n### Worst possible slippage the protocol would have experienced in the most off-peg stablecoin if withdrawing during the last 12 months would have been 2.7% (alUSD)\n\nWhen assets are withdrawn from a strategy (by user action, harvest, or updating strategy selection), the 3CRV pool token is withdrawn from a metapool, and then USDC, USDT or DAI is withdrawn from that 3CRV token. If the protocol is withdrawing an asset that is underweight in the pool (because its price is low relative to other pool components) then slippage (a negative return) is realised in the protocol.\n\nThe maximum slippage had a strategy withdrawn its current allocation at the worst time during the last 12 months from the most offpeg stablecoin strategy would have been 2.7%.\n\nIn order to set the correct level for stop-losses, we have pulled together on-chain data from Curve using Dune Analytics to get the max imbalance in any given pool in the past 12 months.\n\nWe have then simulated max total slippage based on these maximum imbalances together with current A factors, pool depths, and strategy allocations. Please see the community forum post for details.\n\n \n### Proposal: implement stop loss at 4% (400bps) slippage for any given pool\nSlippage measured in percent (or basis points) can be roughly equated with the price of that asset: e.g. 4% (400bps) of slippage is the same as receiving $0.96c for each $1.00 asset.\n\nGiven the maximum exposure of 50% for any one strategy, a 4% loss to an individual strategy would equate to a 2% loss for any given Vault user.\n\nNOTE: this price threshold would need to be continuously breached for a time threshold (20 mins) before the stop-loss is triggered. This is to avoid unnecessary exits where there is a very temporary spike or dip in prices.\n\n### Implementation\n-   Implemented manually at first, using Discord alert channel to tell core team to enter Emergency mode, update slippage to the detected value, and harvest at that level\n-   Automatic stop losses are being created as priority and will be implemented soon based on the parameters from this vote\n-   The data used will be based on actual price realised from a hypothetical Curve pool withdrawal (i.e. it measures slippage when withdrawing the protocol LP position); this may not be identical to the 'market' price as it's affected by a number of other factors (including size of position relative to pool depth and 'A' factor of pool)\n-   We are working on a solution for USDT, as this is part of 3CRV and and will update on that in the coming weeks\n\n### Vote process\nThis vote will run for 7 days. As an interim measure and in the spirit of caution, the team will manually implement a stop-loss of 400bps across all assets until this vote has passed with a definite answer.\n\nYes: Implement stop loss at 4% (400bps) slippage for any given pool\n\nNo: Do not implement stop loss at 4% (400bps) slippage for any given pool",

      "title": "Vote 016B: How many GRO tokens should be distributed from Treasury to rebuild trust in Gro after UST depeg?",
      "content": "*Vault users lost funds when UST depegged. While the protocol worked as designed and PWRD users were protected by Vault, the design did not include an automated stop-loss mechanism that could provide back-stop protection for Vault users. This vote proposes the DAO to consider going beyond protocol improvements and vote on a distribution of GRO tokens to affected users to win back their trust. This would be a weighted average vote that will let the DAO decide what amounts to be spent on this effort.*\n\n*Note that Vote 16B only covers GRO token distribution. Please refer to Vote 16A for stablecoin distribution.* \n\n## Background\n\n-   Gro Protocol was impacted by the recent depegging of the UST stablecoin, the third largest stablecoin by market cap. One of four strategies was exposed to UST through Curve on Ethereum, resulting in a partial loss of funds for Vault users.\n-   PWRD users were shielded from the UST depeg as Vault protected PWRD. As the leveraged product, Vault took a larger share of total protocol losses since it also took on the loss of PWRD.\n-   Vault withdrawal was not available at times when the PWRD protection utilisation ratio capped out or when stablecoin prices between Curve and Chainlink feed were too far away from each other. This was the same for Argent zkSync users as there is a process to bridge funds from L1 to L2 which was impacted in the same way.\n-   Gro protocol is built to be a permissionless protocol that lets users make their own decisions on entering a portfolio of stable strategies. In the Gro community and in the core team, there were both users who believed that UST would recover and those that believed it would fail. As a core team we did not want to make a centralised decision / \"bet\" on users' behalf so the priority was to enable users to make their own decisions and work around any safety measures that prevented withdrawals.\n-   As the situation worsened, it became clear that the community was no longer divided and most considered that UST was a broken strategy. At that time, the core team started winding down the strategy which moved assets out of UST into USDT reserves. We regret that we hadn't implemented automated stop-loss mechanisms into the protocol in addition to manual integrity assessments. We are also reflecting on whether it is feasible to pursue higher risk strategies in a trustless or decentralised setup.\n-   More detail in the community forum post [here](https://community.gro.xyz/t/ust-depeg-potential-distribution-of-vault-and-gro-tokens-to-impacted-vault-users-for-discussion/300).\n\n## Proposal to distribute stablecoins and GRO to affected protocol users\n\nWhile the system worked as designed and PWRD users were protected, the protocol risk and yield tranching design did not include an automated stop-loss mechanism. Multiple proposals have been raised to improve protocol design, including stop-loss mechanisms and DAO voted strategies.\n\nTo rebuild trust in the Gro brand and encourage Vault users to use Gro products in future, we are proposing the DAO goes beyond protocol improvements, and considers voting on a distribution of stablecoins and/or GRO to affected users.\n\nOver $2mn losses to the Gro DAO treasury, as the largest Vault holder, together with exits from affected users, has substantially reduced protocol TVL. As a result, the treasury is earning less from stablecoin yields and performance fees, which affects how much can be distributed to impacted Vault users. DAO members have suggested it is important to balance the need to rebuild trust with the treasury's sustainability for future growth.\n\nThe proposal below aims to balance that through dividing the distribution into 2 parts: (1) stablecoins that would be distributed over 24 months to impacted users as covered in Vote 16A, (2) vesting GRO tokens to enable governance participation and longer term buy-in to the success of the protocol which is covered in this vote (Vote 16B).\n\n## Vote 016B: GRO distribution to impacted users to rebuild trust\n\n-   GRO token distribution on Ethereum mainnet has also been suggested. Claiming these tokens would allow users to participate more in Gro DAO governance so that they would have a stake in setting parameters for Gro protocol, such as whitelisting yield strategies, voting on proposals like this, and setting performance fee levels.\n-   Some DAO members raised the concerns of increasing GRO token circulation as a result of this distribution. As GRO distribution aims to rebuild trust through giving impacted users a say in the protocol, GRO tokens distributed in this vote would be delivered through the existing [Gro Rewards Centre](http://app.gro.xyz/rewards). These tokens would be issued in one tranche and vest over 12 months with the option to immediately exit with 30% only (in line with other GRO rewards).\n\n## Voting methodology: weighted average\n\nIn order to reflect the range of opinions of all GRO holders we are setting each vote up as a weighted average between the different options. This reflects learnings from previous critical DAO votes where a binary option resulted in many dissatisfied DAO members.\n\nThe ranges below are ambitious but achievable, given necessary DAO runway and the interests of not overly diluting existing GRO holders.\n\n## Voting process\nThis vote was discussed in the Gro community forum and Discord for 7 days. The vote will run live for a further 7 days.",

      "content": "*Vault users lost funds when UST depegged. While the protocol worked as designed and PWRD users were protected by Vault, the design did not include an automated stop-loss mechanism that could provide back-stop protection for Vault users. This vote proposes the DAO to consider going beyond protocol improvements and vote on a distribution of stablecoins to affected users to win back their trust. This would be a weighted average vote that will let the DAO decide what amounts to be spent on this effort.*\n\n*Note that Vote 16A only covers stablecoin distribution. Please refer to Vote 16B for GRO token distribution.* \n\n## Background\n\n-   Gro Protocol was impacted by the recent depegging of the UST stablecoin, the third largest stablecoin by market cap. One of four strategies was exposed to UST through Curve on Ethereum, resulting in a partial loss of funds for Vault users.\n-   PWRD users were shielded from the UST depeg as Vault protected PWRD. As the leveraged product, Vault took a larger share of total protocol losses since it also took on the loss of PWRD.\n-   Vault withdrawal was not available at times when the PWRD protection utilisation ratio capped out or when stablecoin prices between Curve and Chainlink feed were too far away from each other. This was the same for Argent zkSync users as there is a process to bridge funds from L1 to L2 which was impacted in the same way.\n-   Gro protocol is built to be a permissionless protocol that lets users make their own decisions on entering a portfolio of stable strategies. In the Gro community and in the core team, there were both users who believed that UST would recover and those that believed it would fail. As a core team we did not want to make a centralised decision / \"bet\" on users' behalf so the priority was to enable users to make their own decisions and work around any safety measures that prevented withdrawals.\n-   As the situation worsened, it became clear that the community was no longer divided and most considered that UST was a broken strategy. At that time, the core team started winding down the strategy which moved assets out of UST into USDT reserves. We regret that we hadn't implemented automated stop-loss mechanisms into the protocol in addition to manual integrity assessments. We are also reflecting on whether it is feasible to pursue higher risk strategies in a trustless or decentralised setup.\n-   More detail in the community forum post [here](https://community.gro.xyz/t/ust-depeg-potential-distribution-of-vault-and-gro-tokens-to-impacted-vault-users-for-discussion/300).\n\n## Proposal to distribute stablecoins and GRO to affected protocol users\n\nWhile the system worked as designed and PWRD users were protected, the protocol risk and yield tranching design did not include an automated stop-loss mechanism. Multiple proposals have been raised to improve protocol design, including stop-loss mechanisms and DAO voted strategies.\n\nTo rebuild trust in the Gro brand and encourage Vault users to use Gro products in future, we are proposing the DAO goes beyond protocol improvements, and considers voting on a distribution of stablecoins and/or GRO to affected users.\n\nOver $2mn losses to the Gro DAO treasury, as the largest Vault holder, together with exits from affected users, has substantially reduced protocol TVL.

While we cannot measure trust lost, we would propose a distribution based on the proxy of percentage of funds lost.\n-   Some community members suggested that all users should receive the same percentage regardless of how much funds they had in Vault, while others suggested to help smaller wallets.\n-   This proposal suggests applying the same percentage for all users with the exceptions for operational & gas efficiency that (1) those receiving <$1000 would receive their funds upfront while others would receive their distribution over 24 months, and (2) minimum threshold of $10 allocation to be included.\n-   Funds would be escrowed into a smart contract for ongoing release to user wallets, so that the implementation is permissionless. Argent zkSync does not support smart contracts yet so alternative implementation would be required.\n-   As at 15:30 UTC on 27th May 2022, [Gro DAO treasury](https://zapper.fi/account/0x359f4fe841f246a095a82cb26f5819e10a91fe0d) has around $9,500,000 available (excluding GRO tokens and deducting existing commitments) after it took a loss of ~$2,400,000 as one of the largest Vault holders.\n\n## Voting methodology: weighted average\n\nIn order to reflect the range of opinions of all GRO holders we are setting each vote up as a weighted average between the different options. This reflects learnings from previous critical DAO votes where a binary option resulted in many dissatisfied DAO members.\n\nThe ranges below are ambitious but achievable given necessary DAO runway to support future growth. \n\n## Voting process\nThis vote was discussed in the Gro community forum and Discord for 7 days.

Loopring has been around since 2017 and has over 65,000 L2 accounts, and almost 30,00 Loopring smart wallet users have stablecoins sitting idle in their wallets (See here https://blogs.loopring.org/looping-quarterly-update-q1-2022/)\n\n#### Why do we want to do this?\nArgent wallet has been our partner since the first hour and has proven to be a very fruitful partnership (the second largest Vault wallet holder group are Argent zkSync customers, in addition to all layer 1 Vault and PWRD holders using Argent). We are now planning to expand our partnership with other wallets and other end-user gateways in order to grow TVL and give more users access to Vault and PWRD yields and protection. \n\nThe integration of Gro products within other wallets is one of our top priorities and part of the 10x initiatives we have presented in our 2022 roadmap.We think it's an excellent opportunity to be one of the first yield providers to Loopring users and promote Gro protocol further \n\n### Risks of approving the proposal and steps to mitigate\n\n_Risk that Loopring does not return GVT after 1 year_\n\n* Loopring is a well-established project that has been around for more than five years\n* Loopring raised more than $45M during its ICO in 2017, and the governance token $LRC has a market cap of almost $1BN\n* We find it highly unlikely that Loopring will act malicious, given it’s opportunity universe and great reputation among the DeFi community\n\n_Risk that Loopring does not offer GVT to users_\n\n* Loopring has confirmed to us in written form to offer GVT to their users\n* In terms of Loopring's opportunity cost, we believe it is highly unlikely that Loopring will not offer the GVT to users\n\n_Riks that Loopring stops providing yield services to users_\n\n* Loopring would, in this case, return the borrowed GVT to Gro DAO earlier  \n* This has also been confirmed to us in writing form \n* We assume a low risk, as Loopring probably does not want to shed its excellent reputation\n\n### Voting process\nThis vote was discussed in the Gro community forum and Discord for 3 days. The vote will run live for a further 7 days.\n\n**Yes** Mint 2,270 additional Gro Vault Tokens (GVT) (worth ~$400k) and loan them to Loopring\n\n**No**: Do not mint additional 2,270 Gro Vault Tokens (GVT) (worth ~$400k) and loan them to Loopring\n",

      "content": "_TLDR: This proposal asks for up to $600k in dedicated funds to continue incentivizing PWRD3CRV Curve liquidity. It also explicitly permits GRO buyback from the open market and experimentation with incentives to achieve the highest spend efficiency on liquidity incentives._\n\nOriginal community forum post here: https://community.gro.xyz/t/vote-013-allocate-up-to-600k-to-incentivize-pwrd3crv-curve-pool/284.\n### Summary\n\nGro ran 2 rounds of Votium incentives in April for the PWRD3CRV meta pool on Curve with 69,000 GRO and 35,000 GRO tokens respectively.\n\nOutcome of the incentive system was encouraging. PWRD3CRV liquidity grew $15mn to reach $28mn, with PWRD TVL in the pool increasing from $9mn to $13mn. This increased utilisation ratio and Vault yield, and helped drive total protocol TVL up from approximately $40mn to $54mn.\n \nTo continue growing the pool depth and TVL, further incentivization for the PWRD3CRV Curve gauge through Votium or other may be required. This proposal asks the Gro DAO to allocate up to $600k for this purpose.\n\nSo far mostly liquid GRO tokens were used for Votium incentives, this proposal explicitly permits also the usage of Gro Treasury’s stablecoin assets to buy back GRO tokens from the open market (up to the allocated $600k) to use for incentives.\n\nImplementation can take various forms using a mix of GRO, Gro Vault Tokens, PWRD (acquired with USDC) as liquidity incentives. This vote gives core contributors Grwth Lbs and Wojak the mandate to devise implementation plans so that Gro incentives are utilised to the highest efficiency possible.\n\n### Vote 013: Allocate up to $600k to incentivize PWRD3CRV Curve pool\n\nProposal that Gro DAO allocates up to $600k to incentivize CRV allocation to the PWRD3CRV meta pool through Curve gauge. The sum could be funded by either GRO, USDC, PWRD, or Vault tokens in Gro Treasury; DAO contributors, Growth Lbs and Wojak, will experiment to best deepen liquidity and increase TVL of Gro protocol.\n \nA suggested implementation is using the stablecoin assets in Gro Treasury to buy back GRO tokens; it is possible to use USDC directly or through first depositing USDC for Gro Vault tokens (GVT) and using them to buy GRO tokens for incentives. This increases Gro TVL and Vault supply at the same time, which increases the capacity to mint more PWRD. Alternative implementation could be providing LP tokens such as PWRD/GRO on Uniswap v2 to incentivize allocation of CRV rewards to the PWRD3CRV pool if Votium or similar platforms allow. It would require experimentation to understand what combination would provide the highest capital and operational efficiency.\n \nThe allocation would remain in Gro Treasury until deployed via the multi-sig for PWRD3CRV incentivization. There is no fixed timeline or min/max amount for each round of incentivization.\n \nWhen the funds run out, the multi-sig would transfer no more funds (in excess of the amount “borrowed” from marketing spend - see details in second part of the risk section) to Votium or similar platforms without another DAO governance approval. DAO contributors will need to return to DAO governance for further allocation. If such incentivization is discontinued as they are no longer deemed productive for PWRD liquidity and/or Gro protocol TVL, the remaining sum in Gro Treasury will be free to be used for other purposes. If the funds are not being deployed for 6 months, they will also no longer be earmarked for PWRD3CRV incentives.\n\n### Voting process\nThis vote was discussed in the Gro community forum and Discord for 7 days. The vote will run live for a further 7 days.\n\n**Yes**: Allocate up to $600k to incentivize PWRD3CRV Curve pool\n\n**No**: Do not allocate up to $600k to incentivize PWRD3CRV Curve pool\n\n",

      "content": "_TLDR: To build a great protocol and deliver maximum value to the Gro DAO, we need great contributions. This is a proposal to spend up to $150k per month from the DAO treasury on core contributors to develop the protocol. Cost will be reconciled to actual spend - which are currently ~$88k/month._\n\nYou can see the (original community forum post here)[https://community.gro.xyz/t/vote-012-fund-initial-dao-contributors-to-ensure-protocol-development-and-further-progressive-decentralisation/279].\n\n### Background and Summary\n\n* 6 different contributors (both entities and individuals) have been working on Gro protocol since 2020\n* There’s been a good start with over $40m TVL and over 2,000 users, but more investment and work is required to get to the level that the DAO wants and expects\n* To have the best team driving the best outcomes for the DAO, monthly contributor costs of up to USDC 150k is required across 6 contributors (up to 16 individuals in total)\n* This spend is comparable or less than other yield aggregators and new DeFi players (e.g. Yearn, Pickle and Maple)\n* Graadient (founder) will not take any salary and instead has a token allocation for economic alignment with the success of Gro protocol\n* Payments would be made monthly from the DAO by its multisig to the contributors\n\n### Vote 012: Fund contributor operating costs for Gro protocol with up to USDC 150k per month\n\nProposal that Gro DAO funds actual contributor operating costs of up to USDC 150,000 per month (inc. software development, product, operations and marketing). The ongoing contributor operating costs of up to USDC 150k per month would be distributed as follows:\n\n![image](ipfs://QmPJkrLcYrVEuti9gfWFJT7yJ4ZsjdnhBt9wWT2Npkg67i)\n\nThe ongoing operating cost payments would be executed via the multisig on an ongoing monthly basis by transferring the relevant amount of USDC to the wallet requested by each contributor. Only actual costs will be paid (i.e. it will likely be less than the requested budget), and there will be a six-monthly report setting out variance from budget. The multi-sig is empowered by this vote to execute these operating cost transactions in line with agreed maximum budgets.\n\nCurrent contributor costs are around USDC 88,079 per month. We expect these to ramp up over the next few months as the number of contributors grows following this proposed investment from the DAO.\n\n### Examples of other DeFi protocols budgets\n\nThis is common practice within the DeFi space. Several OG DeFi and DeFi 2.0 projects are transparent about their contributor costs and the funding by the DAO. Below are data points for players in the space. Gro DAO proposed spend is comparable or less than these.\n\n* Yearn: $301k in latest month reported on github (Sep 2021) (2021Q3-yearn-quarterly-report)[yearn-pm/2021Q3-yearn-quarterly-report.pdf at master · yearn/yearn-pm · GitHub 1]\n* Pickle: $96,667 per month (Pickle Feb 22 update)[SCCOC February Update - Scotty - Medium 1]\n* Maple: $220,582 per month (Maple Q4 2021 report - link to discord)[Discord 1]\n\n### Risks of approving the proposal and steps to mitigate\n\n_Risk that contributors underperform vs operating cost spent on them_\n\n* Grwth Lbs is taking on the role of performance management currently\n* Already had iterations of team makeup to keep performance high; will continue to do this to ensure DAO gets maximum value for money\n* Full time contributors budgeted at an average of up to USDC 112,500 per year per individual, including a majority of software engineers; this is good value in current crypto markets (for comparison Yearn is 23.5% higher at $138,923 per year per individual, including part time contributors)\n\n_Risk that the contributor selection is incorrect_\n\n* Currently 6 contributors being funded by this proposal, including Grwth Lbs who are doing performance management\n* Risk that Grwth Lbs may be fundamentally the wrong team to take Gro protocol forwards for further successes\n* In that case the DAO can choose to approve separate grants in future for more effective contributors, and the multi-sig would take instructions from those contributors (as instructed by the DAO)\n\n_Risk that funds are insufficient to build a world-class protocol (regardless of contributor selection)_\n\n* Costs are comparable or less to other OG DeFi projects Yearn and Pickle (yield aggregators) and Maple (DeFi 2.0)\n* Budget is for 6 months and includes 10% buffer which gives some headroom for necessary changes\n* If any further costs considered critical then the DAO can choose to approve these in a separate vote\n\n### Voting process\n\nThis vote was discussed in the Gro community forum for 7 days, together with a dedicated Discord channel and discussion on the community call. The vote will run live for a further 7 days.\n\n**Yes**: approve budget of up to 150k USDC per month for DAO contributor operating expenses\n**No**: do not approve a budget for DAO contributor operating expenses ",

      "content": "_TLDR: Gro protocol uses ETH and AVAX on a day-to-day basis in order to manage strategies (e.g. harvests) and deploy new contracts (e.g. the new v2 Convex strategies). This proposal ensures the long-term viability of Gro protocol by allowing the DAO to self-fund any ETH and AVAX necessary to function. It also reimburses Grwth Lbs Ltd for fronting initial ETH and AVAX required to deploy and run Gro protocol._\n\nThis is a summary post. You can see more detail at the [community forum post here](https://community.gro.xyz/t/vote-011-budget-proposal-to-further-decentralise-by-funding-necessary-protocol-gas-costs-and-repaying-gas-fronted-by-grwth-lbs-ltd/274)\n\n### Summary\n\n* Gro protocol has been live on mainnet since May 2021 and has so far used 75.74 ETH and 417.36 AVAX (more information below) \n* Gas costs are for deployment of new contracts, Ethereum strategy keeper bots and Avalanche strategy keeper bots for all Gro products on Ethereum and Avalanche. \n* Until now this has been fronted by Grwth Lbs Ltd, a UK entity using its own funds to develop Gro protocol until Gro DAO is fully established. \n* Following launch of Gro DAO Token Gro protocol has been handed over to the DAO. Grwth Lbs Ltd is now proposing to increase decentralisation by transitioning funding of the protocol’s development and operations to Gro DAO. \n* Important step towards decentralising protocol operations, which is common in particular among yield aggregators (examples from Yearn and Pickle below). \n* Includes repaying the operational ETH and AVAX costs fronted by Grwth Lbs to date. \n* Enables further decentralisation of bot actions by using a keeper network that help with the functioning of our protocol (e.g. Gelato Ops). \n* Forecast ongoing costs of up to 8 ETH and 160 AVAX each month. \n\n### Vote 011: Fund ongoing Gro protocol operational costs with up to 8 ETH and 160 AVAX per month and repay fronted ETH and AVAX to Grwth Lbs Ltd\n\nProposal that Gro DAO funds the ongoing Gro protocol ETH and AVAX costs up to 8 ETH and 160 AVAX per month for the next 12 months and that Gro DAO repay the existing spend of 75.74 ETH and the USDC equivalent of 417.36 AVAX (31,434.45 USDC) to Grwth Lbs Ltd.\n\nThese funds were fronted originally with a view to transferring ownership of Gro protocol entirely to the DAO. Now that this has occurred as part of the Gro DAO token launch, Grwth Lbs has no ownership stake or financial benefit from the protocol.\n\nThe running costs would be executed via the multi-sig on an ongoing monthly basis by transferring the relevant amount of ETH and AVAX to an operational DAO wallet controlled by core protocol engineers.\n\nThis repayment to Grwth Lbs would be implemented via a snapshot vote with a SafeSnap transaction to automatically transfer the funds on-chain to a Grwth Lbs Ltd wallet.\n\nTo allow for unusually high months (large deployments or high gas fees), the operational wallet would be permitted to build up a small reserve of ETH and AVAX up to a total of 3x monthly costs (24 ETH plus 480 AVAX). Once this limit was reached the multi-sig would transfer no more ETH or AVAX until the operational wallet was back below this level.\n\nHistoric data is pulled from etherscan and Snowtrace.

Many of the OG DeFi and DeFi 2.0 projects are transparent about their gas spends and the funding by the DAO. Below are two data points for yield aggregators in the space.

      "content": "#### TLDR\n\n* The DAO has 10m USDC unallocated right now\n* Voting for allocations to smaller protocols takes time for due diligence and negotiations for mutual deposits\n* If allocated faster the DAO could be earning enough to cover the operating costs of the protocol and act decisively to buy the dip when appropriate\n* Propose to set up a Gro Treasury Committee who are re-elected each 12 months\n* Whitelisted principles will allow the committee to move fast\n\nMore information and discussion here: https://community.gro.xyz/t/vote-010-gro-dao-treasury-management-committee/260\n\n#### Proposal: set up a Gro Treasury Committee\n\nWe propose that a Gro Treasury Committee is set up to handle the Gro DAO treasury finances, with an agreed set of whitelist principles voted on by the DAO.\n\nThe purpose of the committee is to execute on pre-agreed (‘whitelisted’) treasury deployments quickly. It can then spend the time needed on due diligence and negotiations, submit proposals to the DAO for voting, and instruct the DAO multi-sig to act on those instructions.\n\nThe Treasury Committee is doing the typical treasury function equivalent in a company i.e. it is deciding how to invest excess USDC, and not making decisions as to operational spending (that will be clarified in a future DAO vote).\n\n_**Agreed whitelist principles**_\n\nIn the interest of moving swiftly and with agility, we propose that certain ‘blue chip’ DeFi whitelisted protocols, meaning that no further DAO vote would be needed to move funds into these protocols.\n\nIn addition, we propose that there are certain whitelisted assets: meaning that the Treasury Management Committee can (by instructing the DAO multi-sig) acquire those assets using treasury funds without further DAO instruction.\n\nFinally there we propose whitelisted transactions. This is to allow swift action to be taken for emergency reasons, or smaller transactions to happen without a vote.\n\n_Proposed whitelisted protocols_\n\n* Aave\n* Compound\n* Curve\n* Lido Finance\n* Gro\n\n_Proposed whitelisted assets_\n\n* USDC\n* USDT\n* DAI\n* ETH\n* AVAX\n\n_Proposed whitelisted transactions_\n\n* Any return of funds back to the Gro DAO treasury\n* Any investment in a protocol up to $100,000 value\n\n#### Who would be part of the Gro Treasury Committee?\n\nThe inaugural Gro Treasury Committee would be made up of the following individuals (with discord usernames):\n\n* joyce | gro#7566 (core team)\n* Charlie | Gro#2698 (core team)\n* pavel#3939 \n* Slacking#0191\n* mjohanm4#0672\n\nYou can contact each of these community members for more information via Discord or the community forum. \n\n#### Re-election and removal or addition of members\n\nWe propose that the Gro Treasury Committee be re-elected every 12 months, subject to a governance proposal on who should form part of the Committee.\n\nIf there is a desire from the community (shown via a forum post and a positive indicative poll) or from the core team to add or remove Committee members within less than 12 months, then there can be a new governance vote to change the Committee (by adding, removing or substituting members).\n\n#### Remuneration\n\nTo reflect the time spent by contributors, the Gro Treasury Committee should be remunerated for their time involved in advancing the Gro ecosystem. We propose that each Committee member receive 500 $GRO per month from the Gro DAO Treasury for their time and effort (each monthly token amount delivered as an airdrop vesting for 12 months in the rewards centre).\n\nFor any core team member who already has an allocation of $GRO as part of the team allocation set out in the $GRO tokenomics, this monthly amount will be considered already included in their existing allocation i.e. core team members will not get additional $GRO for their role on the Committee.\n\nThe expected time commitment is 5-10 hours per month but this is subject to change.\n\n#### Proposed committee operating principles\n\n* Committee made up of 5 members to start with, including a mix of DAO members from the core team and from the community\n* Meet 1x per month plus ad hoc meeting as necessary; ongoing discord channel also\n* Function: Deliver instructions to the DAO (via the multi-sig) to manage the Gro DAO Treasury\n\nThe committee operating principles are subject to change in accordance with the view of the committee (3/5 vote required). \n\n#### Voting Process\n\nThis vote was discussed in the Gro community forum for 7 days, together with discussions on Discord. The vote will run live for a further 7 days.\n\n**YES**: set up a Gro Treasury Committee\n**NO**: do not set up a Gro Treasury Committee",

      "content": "_TLDR: This proposal significantly increases Vault’s yield and changes its risk profile, while maintaining similar yields for PWRD and removing its withdrawal fee._\n\n_For information and background, or to get involved with the conversation, please go to the Community post here: https://community.gro.xyz/t/vote-009-proposal-to-increase-yield-and-risk-profile-of-vault-and-remove-pwrd-withdrawal-fee/241_\n\nSUMMARY\n\n* Increase overall Vault and PWRD base yields through increased exposure to Curve strategies (which have higher yield)\n* Less protection against major stablecoins and major protocols, so PWRD is not fully protected against failure of USDC/USDT/DAI, or failure of Curve/Convex\n* This protection is not valued highly by PWRD users, who would prefer more yield plus protection against failure of more ‘exotic’ stablecoins and protocols (e.g. oUSD, mUSD, MIM, FRAX)\n* PWRD is still protected with over $2 of diversified stablecoin collateral to every $1 of PWRD (200% collateral ratio), so there would need to be significant losses for PWRD to be affected\n* Increase utility, liquidity, and the peg stability of PWRD by removing 0.5% withdrawal fee\n* Update the yield sharing curve to maintain PWRD yield, as Vault yield will increase due to overall strategy changes\n* The initial strategy selection would be FRAX-3CRV, mUSD-3CRV and oUSD-3CRV, but this will change over time and will be in line with the risk framework shared and iterated\n\n**PWRD IS MORE PROTECTED THAN IT NEEDS TO BE, RESULTING IN LOWER PROTOCOL YIELDS FOR VAULT AND PWRD**\n\nRight now, PWRD is currently 149% protected by Vault (see dApp) against the failure of any protocol or any stablecoin. Based on community surveys and actual user behaviour, the core team believes that the outsized protection is not worth the opportunity cost of lower yields due to diversifying capital into lower risk strategies.\n\n*Conjoint Analysis surveys show PWRD and Vault users prioritise yield*\n\nWe have used conjoint analysis from 1000minds.com to test a hypothesis from the community (including @MJohanm) that PWRD users do not need full protection against major stablecoins (USDC, USDT, DAI) or major protocols (Curve, Convex) and would prefer higher yields - while keeping some protection.\n\nThese surveys have shown that the majority of PWRD users (67%) prioritise higher yield with some exposure to major protocols (e.g. Curve/Convex) and major stablecoins (USDC/USDT/DAI), ahead of full protection against major protocols (17%) or major stablecoins too (16%). Overall, yield was the most important attribute with 43% of the weight (sample size 29). We saw similar results with non-PWRD users (sample size 27).\n\n*PWRD deployment into 3CRV pool shows users do not value protection against major stablecoins and Curve*\n\nWe see this behaviour in effect in real life where 75% of PWRD held by users is staked in the PWRD-3CRV pool. This means the majority of PWRD users are already accepting the risks of USDC/USDT/DAI and Curve in return for higher yield.\n\n**PROPOSAL 1: INCREASE USDT/USDC/DAI AND CURVE/CONVEX STRATEGY ALLOCATION TO INCREASE YIELD, WHILE REMAINING PROTECTED WITH AT LEAST $2 COLLATERAL FOR EACH $1 PWRD**\n\nFocusing on higher return strategies (e.g. Curve/Convex) while continuing to protect PWRD against exotic stablecoins and protocols such as FRAX/Frax, oUSD/Origin and mUSD/mStable (or in future, MIM/Abracadabra or LUSD/Liquity) enables higher protocol returns (10-20%). Vault users will then get higher returns (up to 30%) thanks to leverage from PWRD and the share of withdrawal fee.\n\nCurve pools currently have the best yield opportunities on stablecoins, especially given Curve’s track record (safely live since Feb 2020 with over $20bn TVL), although in future different strategies could be chosen.\n\nPWRD will always be protected with at least $2 major stablecoin collateral for each $1 PWRD (200% collateral ratio), and often this is higher ($3 or more). In all cases PWRD is protected fully against a failure of a minor protocol (e.g. Origin, mStable, Abracadabra, Frax, Liquity).\n\n**PROPOSAL 2: UPDATE THE YIELD SHARING CURVE TO MAINTAIN PWRD YIELD, AS VAULT YIELD WILL INCREASE DUE TO OVERALL STRATEGY CHANGES**\n\nUpdating the yield sharing curve to give a higher share of the system yield to PWRD will make it a more compelling product for PWRD users. This provides higher leverage to Vault who are also getting higher yields as the whole system yields will increase. Vault users are taking on additional risk for higher yields and the ability to access undercollateralised leverage from PWRD.\n\nExact details of this will be fleshed out in the future and shared with the community. The parameters of the curve will be iterated on an ongoing basis by the core team, together with active community members (e.g. this post and this post from @Slacking), until the protocol finds product/market fit.\n\n**PROPOSAL 3: INCREASE UTILITY, LIQUIDITY AND PEG STBILITY BY REMOVING PWRD 0.5% WITHDRAWAL FEE**\n\nPWRD’s utility is constrained by lack of liquidity. Despite being marketed as a stablecoin, PWRD has one of the lowest velocities of all stablecoins in DeFi (velocity calculated as annualised trading volume divided by market cap). Tether, DAI, and USDC have velocities north of 40; Tether has trended around 40x, USDC at roughly 55x, and DAI at over 100x. Though there is no data on PWRD annualised trading volume, it is likely to be similar to US Money Supply at around 1x. Therefore, it is clear PWRD has been much more of a DeFi yield farming savings account akin to Yearn Vaults or a (much higher yield) savings account with redemption fees, than to a stablecoin which inherently has much more velocity than traditional fiat.\n\nRemoving the HODL contribution fee of 0.5% will allow for more liquidity to enter PWRD, as a 0.5% fee can negate about 10% of PWRD APY based on current yields (5.8% APY as of January 26th, 2022).\n\n**ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERED of only removing protection against USDT/USDC/DAI**\n\nPWRD could continue to keep full protection against Curve/Convex however this would result in 30% lower PWRD yield as Gro would need 6+ strategies to ensure there wasn’t too much exposure to Curve/Convex.\n\nGiven the safety of Curve and the high collateral levels in both scenarios (at least $2 collateral for each $1 PWRD), and based on the results of the Conjoint Analysis, the core team has come to the conclusion that the best thing for users is to focus on yield, protection against exotic risks (i.e. less established stablecoins/protocols), and utility of the product.\n\n**VOTING PROCESS**\n\nThis vote was discussed in the Gro community forum for several weeks, together with discussions on Discord. The vote will run live for a further 5 days.\n\n* YES: the Proposals listed in this vote should be implemented\n* NO: the Proposals listed in this vote should not be implemented\n\n",

      "content": "_For information and background, or to get involved with the conversation, please go to the Community post here: https://community.gro.xyz/t/vote-008-increasing-olympus-pro-bond-allocation/204_\n\nPROPOSAL TO INCREASE BOND ALLOCATION TO $500K GRO/month\n\nGro proposes that the DAO increases allocation from $250K/month to $500K/month for the GRO/PWRD Olympus Pro bond. This would effectively more than double the maximum bond size from 1,154 GRO to 2,620 GRO.\n\n- Olympus Pro is a well-received liquidity management program with 25 partner protocols on Ethereum, Fantom, and Avalanche since its September launch.\n- While the gas cost to bond would remain the same to the user, a larger maximum bond size would mean the gas cost would be a lower proportion of capital used for bonding.\n- $500K/month would be in line with fellow Cohort 3 participants’ monthly allocation of $448K, $520K, and $550K. There is one protocol that allocated $1.2M/month to the program which would be advised to adjust downward.\n- An additional $250K GRO represents a very small increase in circulating supply (<1%) and a even smaller portion of GRO allocated to the treasury (<0.3%); in the event that all bondholders sell their GRO tokens obtained in this program after the 14-day vesting period, it would have limited impact to GRO holders.\n\nMore details about the GRO/PWRD Olympus Pro bond (same as what was presented in Vote 4):\n\n- GRO/PWRD is a new Uniswap v2 pool where there are no liquidity mining rewards offered at the moment; this provides a clean read of the bond’s performance in drawing in additional liquidity in the absence of GRO incentives.\n- LP tokens obtained through this program will remain in the treasury to generate trading fee income while providing liquidity to the market.\n- Bond price will be determined by market demand; higher demand for the bonds will increase the bond price and vice versa.\n- The program duration is flexible; if the result is unfavourable (e.g., limited market appetite), Gro DAO can sunset the program by not renewing the allocation to the bond’s custom treasury contract.\n- OlympusDAO will get 3.3% of total bonded value in Gro DAO tokens in return for providing the bond instruments and marketplace; as OlympusDAO has “skin in the game” through holding our governance tokens, it will have higher incentives to collaborate with us in growing Gro.\n\nVOTING PROCESS\n\nThis vote was discussed in the Gro community forum for 14 days, together with discussions on Discord. The vote will run live for a further 7 days.\n\nYes: Support the proposal and grant the proposed increase Olympus Pro allocation to $500K/month\n\nNo: Do not support the proposal and do not grant the proposed increase Olympus Pro allocation to $500K/month\n\n",

It would be spent in accordance with the guidelines set out below.\n\nThis would allow for the following example budget (all figures are estimates based on best available information):\n\n* 6x videos ($60k total)\n* 10x sponsorship opportunities ($30k total)\n* 6x G-force epochs (up to 100,000 locked GRO, depending on future iterations)\n* 10x Youtube and twitter reviews ($50k or 10,000 GRO)\n* 6x Community competitions (6000 GRO)\n* Miscellaneous Spending Items or other community suggestions\n\n**BUDGET SETTING GUIDELINES**\n\nIn addition to the marketing budget, we will propose several other DAO budgets over the next few weeks (e.g. operational costs for the DAO). In anticipation of these proposals, we have suggested some guidelines:\n\n* Budgets can contain a mix of USDC, Liquid (unlocked) GRO and Vesting (locked) GRO\n* Budgets should be agreed for 3 month periods (calendar year quarters)\n* Different types of assets may come from different sections of the total Gro allocation: USDC spend will come from the Treasury allocation; Vesting (locked) GRO spend will come from the Community incentives allocation; Liquid (unlocked) GRO can come from either the Treasury or the Community Incentives, depending on whether the recipient is a current or new community member (e.g. G-Force, competitions) or an external organisation (e.g. sponsorships)\n\n**BUDGET SPENDING GUIDELINES**\n\n* DAO votes on the Quarterly Budget in accordance with the process below, and the budget is moved from the treasury to an operational wallet. At the end of every quarter, any unspent funds will be rolled over into the next Quarterly Budget.\n* This vote could cover some already proposed Spending Items.\n* Anyone can propose a further Spending Item from the relevant budget on the community forum.\n* Initially, approval for Spending Items will be given by the core team, within the parameters of the Quarterly Budget. The core team may also propose further Spending Items.\n* The funds will be used transparently and there will be a dashboard (Google Sheets, Dune analytics or equivalent) tracking expenditure.\n\n**VOTING PROCESS**\n\nThis vote was discussed in the Gro community forum for 8 days, together with discussions on Discord.

      "title": "Vote 6: CREAM exploit compensation for early Vault exits",
      "content": "**PROPOSAL SUMMARY**\n\nIf executed, this proposal will allocate either $919.9k (112k GRO) or $1.38m (168k GRO) worth of Vesting Gro DAO Tokens ($GRO) as partial compensation for Vault holders following the CREAM exploit.\n\nThis will allow users who commit to the protocol to recoup much more than they lost from front-running exits. \n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\nThis is a short summary of the CREAM hack. You can read more about it on twitter (see reference below).\n\n* On Wednesday 27th October, CREAM finance was hacked and lost ~$130m. Unfortunately, Gro protocol had 2 of its 7 strategies allocated into CREAM at the time of attack, totalling $9.24m (15% of protocol TVL).\n* Because the CREAM losses were not realised on CREAM’s side, Gro protocol could not automatically account for the loss, and required manual intervention to assess and realise it.\n* Before the loss was realised, some Vault users withdrew their funds quickly, to avoid sharing the Vault downside.\n* The core team took action to prevent further front-running as described in the post-mortem (see reference below)\n* Since the exploit, $782k plus $2.14m of $CREAM has been recovered by the Gro team and redistributed to Vault holders, resulting in a net loss of $6.31m (15.0% of Vault TVL)\n* The value of the funds withdrawn from the protocol in this time period was $2.95m, resulting in an additional $413k lost between the remaining Vault users (1.0% of Vault TVL)\n* There is also $46.6k of $CREAM due to Vault holders in a Uniswap v3 pool (which uses different data structures) that the Gro team had not included previously.\n\n\n**PROPOSAL TO USE $GRO TO COMPENSATE VAULT HOLDERS FOR EXTRA LOSSES SUFFERED BY OTHER VAULT HOLDERS LEAVING**\n\nGro proposes that the DAO allocates either $919.9k (112k GRO) or $1.38m (168k GRO) worth of Vesting Gro DAO Tokens (GRO), which is worth either 2x or 3x the value of front-running losses to affected users plus the outstanding CREAM recovery. This allows users who commit to the protocol to recoup much more than they lost from front-running exits! \n\n* Vesting $GRO can be claimed immediately at 30% value (with the remainder going into the vesting bonus)\n* Alternatively users can vest it over 12 months (and claim from the vesting bonus during that time).\n* The amount is 2x or 3x the sum of: (1) $413.3k of front-running losses + (2) $46.6k outstanding CREAM recovery, which the core team proposes to include in this proposal to ensure fair distribution of recoveries to all Vault holders.\n* This proposal balances the interests of Vault holders by giving them flexibility, with the interests of GRO holders, by reducing the immediate supply of GRO into the market\n*  It increases the vesting bonus, which makes vested GRO more attractive, and therefore enhances the overall utility of Gro protocol.\n* The price used for GRO is $8.20, which is the market price according to CoinGecko as at the time of the Snapshot vote.\n* The proposal will be implemented following the updates to the rewards centre which allow immediate 30% claim (see reference below), and is conditional on that vote passing.\n\n**HOW WAS THIS PROPOSAL DISCUSSED?**\n\nThis proposal was put together by early contributors behind the Gro protocol. It has been shared in the Gro governance forum: https://community.gro.xyz/t/cream-exploit-compensation-for-losses-caused-by-early-vault-exits/176/7\n\nREFERENCES\n\nCREAM exploit post-mortem\nhttps://twitter.com/groprotocol/status/1454049695332962306?s=20\n\nRewards centre update vote\nhttps://vote.gro.xyz/#/proposal/0x8e0fb22cc79de63ee7f63b90f2625de20fa26b5db0414df1eefe2ba925c9b155",

      "title": "Vote 5: GRO Rewards Changes",
      "content": "_This proposal was discussed on the forum as the synthesis of Slacking’s forum proposal, Shroom’s forum proposal and by various contributors on Discord._\n\n**PROPOSAL SUMMARY**\n\nIf executed, this proposal will start work to implement following changes:\n* Performance fee of 5% for Vault and PWRD yields.\n* Performance fee of 10% for new Labs products.\n* Performance fee buys back GRO from the market.\n* GRO acquired from performance fee delivered as Vesting bonus to users. 10% of the performance fee delivered to the DAO treasury.\n* Users can partially exit the vesting contract to take a portion of their GRO.\n* Users can claim Vesting bonus at most every 4 weeks.\n* Users can lock externally acquired GRO into the vesting contract.\n* Users can voluntarily extend their vesting duration up to the max length (12 mths).\n* Users can claim rewards immediately as liquid GRO or vesting GRO. If liquid GRO, 30% will go to their wallet and 70% to the Vesting bonus. If vesting GRO, 100% will be added to their vesting position. The 30% will be a parameter that the DAO can adjust.\n* Users’ 1 year vesting schedule will change from current 10->100%, to 0->100%. Already existing vesting schedules will also rescale as if they had started at 0%.\n* Users can claim multiple pools in one single claim for some gas savings.\n* A separate vote will be created specifically on options for scaling the rewards center on other chains, since it is a much more complex topic.\n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\nGro DAO Token is used to (1) Vote in Governance, (2) Claim Vesting bonus, and (3) Pair in liquidity pools to earn GRO. Locked GRO in the vesting contract enables Vesting bonus claims but the only way to get more locked GRO is through mining rewards or airdrops. Locked GRO is like Curve’s veCRV but with more limited utility right now. Few people are exiting the vesting contract so less vesting bonus is generated (2), making locked GRO less compelling. The primary utility is governance (1). This proposal increases the utility of locked GRO by increasing the GRO Vesting bonus and enabling special product access to locked GRO.\n\n**DETAILS ON THE PROPOSAL**\n\n**Enable Performance fee that users can claim as a Vesting bonus:**\n* Enable 5% performance fee on base products (Vault & PWRD) yields.\n* Enable 10% performance fee on Labs products (e.g. upcoming Avalanche) yields.\n* Performance fees buy GRO and delivers to active users as Vesting bonus. 10% of acquired GRO go to DAO treasury.\n\n**Make it easy to get liquid GRO for short-term farmers AND increase the vesting bonus for long-term DAO members:**\n* Let users choose 30% liquid GRO directly on claiming (70% goes to Vesting Bonus), OR 100% with 1 year vest.\n* Change vesting schedules to go from 0% to 100% over 1 year\n* Enable partial exits from the vesting contract with prorating of the exit fee. Example: User has 100 GRO in vesting contract. 90 GRO locked and 10 unlocked. User exits 50%. 50 GRO remains in the Vesting contract. 5 GRO goes to their wallet and 45 goes to the Vesting bonus.\n\n**Reduce user cost of claiming GRO:**\n* Extend Vesting bonus claim cooldown period to 4 weeks. This halves the number of gassy actions needed to claim vesting bonus, and doubles the size of each claim.\n* Combine multiple pool claims into a single transaction. This would result in some gas savings for people who are participating in multiple pools.\n* Continue scoping migrating vesting contracts to cheaper/faster chains (this is a big piece of work and the core team is currently scoping several options)\n\n**Get early/more/better access to Gro products through locked GRO:**\n* Threshold amount of locked GRO will be a requirement to access some new products from Gro. E.g. upcoming Gro Labs on Avalanche.\n* Higher amounts of GRO will enable better product experiences like higher deposit allowances and rewards multipliers.\n\n**Enable users to increase locked GRO (as this will have more utility from increasing vesting bonus and special product access):**\n* Users can acquire GRO from the market and lock it into the vesting center to increase their locked GRO.\n* Users can voluntarily extend their vesting schedule up to the max duration of 1 year.\n\nAfter passing this proposal, the core team will come back with an implementation timeline.\n\n**HOW WAS THIS PROPOSAL DISCUSSED?**\n\nThis proposal was put together by early contributors behind Gro protocol.

      "title": "Vote 4: Olympus Pro",
      "content": "PROPOSAL SUMMARY\n\nIf executed, this proposal will: \n\nAllocate $250k worth of Gro DAO Tokens (GRO) for an Olympus Pro bond on GRO/PWRD Uniswap v2 LP tokens to deepen protocol owned liquidity.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nSince the launch of Gro DAO token (GRO), it has accumulated $20M liquidity ($34M total pool liquidity) across Uniswap v2 and Balancer in GRO/USDC, GRO/GVT, GRO/WETH, and GRO/PWRD pairs. The daily trading volume is now at $3-6M across these pools.\n\nThe community has provided feedback that the current liquidity level could be deepened to ensure price stability. This would allow larger transactions without causing unnecessary jump in token prices. At the same time, deeper liquidity would also improve user experience as the slippage or price impact would become smaller for each trade.\n\nOlympusDAO is one of Gro’s first PWRD treasury users and this proposal is another step to deepen the collaboration and relationship between the two DAOs/protocols.\n\nPROPOSAL TO INITIATE OLYMPUS PRO BOND WITH $250K GRO\n\nGro proposes that the DAO allocates $250K Gro DAO tokens (GRO) to initiate an Olympus Pro bond in its Cohort 3 launch on Friday 19th November. If this vote passes, the DAO treasury would offer GRO in exchange for protocol-owned GRO/PWRD liquidity. \n\n- Olympus Pro is a well-received liquidity management program with 16 partner protocols on Ethereum and Fantom since its September launch.\n- GRO/PWRD is a new Uniswap v2 pool where there are no liquidity mining rewards offered at the moment; this provides a clean read of the bond’s performance in drawing in additional liquidity in the absence of GRO incentives.\n- LP tokens obtained through this program will remain in the treasury to generate trading fee income while providing liquidity to the market. \n- $250K GRO represents a very small increase in circulating supply (<1%) and a even smaller portion of GRO allocated to the treasury (<0.3%); in the event that all bondholders sell their GRO tokens obtained in this program after the 7- or 14-day vesting period, it would have limited impact to GRO holders.\n- Bond price will be determined by market demand; higher demand for the bonds will increase the bond price and vice versa. \n- The program duration is flexible; if the result is unfavourable (e.g., limited market appetite), Gro DAO can sunset the program by not renewing the $250K allocation to the bond’s custom treasury contract. \n- OlympusDAO will get 3.3% of total bonded value in Gro DAO tokens in return for providing the bond instruments and marketplace; as OlympusDAO has “skin in the game” through holding our governance tokens, it will have higher incentives to collaborate with us in growing Gro.\n\nHOW WAS THIS PROPOSAL DISCUSSED?\n\nThis proposal was put together by early contributors behind the Gro protocol.

      "title": "Vote 3: Security",
      "content": "PROPOSAL SUMMARY\n\nIf executed, this proposal will:\n1. Transfer ownership of the Immunefi bug bounty program for Gro protocol from Grwth Lbs Ltd to the Gro DAO\n2. Increase the Immunefi bug bounty to $1,000,000\n3. Employ Trail of Bits for an audit as soon as possible \n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nSince the launch of the Gro DAO token (GRO) the TVL in Vault and PWRD has increased to >$40m (from ~$10m) plus there is $80m staked across Gro pools and staking contracts (and 2m GRO in the vesting contract).\n\nGro has also attracted more attention. Twitter followers are 3x from pre-LBP, discord has more than 2,000 new members, and weekly app visits are up 10x.\n\nThis is exciting, and it’s great to see the world discovering more and more about Gro. However with a larger TVL, together with increased visibility, we need to keep improving security.\n\nLast week there was a hack on CREAM which sadly cost Gro Vault users a portion of funds. CREAM is a successful protocol that has been running for over a year and with more than $1.5bn of TVL, and is based off of the battle-tested Compound codebase.\n\nGro has had three audits so far: Peckshield, Fixed Point Solutions and Code Arena. The protocol has been live (in beta) since August 2021. There is a $60k bug bounty live with Immunefi.\n\n\nPROPOSAL\n\nGro takes security very seriously and would like to propose to the DAO an increased bug bounty and another audit by Trail of Bits as first steps in our continuous efforts to continually enhance Gro’s security. \n\nThis is in line with the feedback from our previous community poll and our published roadmap. As part of this proposal the ‘ownership’ of the bug bounty would transfer to the DAO (from the dev team Grwth Lbs that set up the initial $60k bounty).\n\nWe propose that:\n(i) the DAO increases the Immunefi bug bounty to $1,000,000, and\n(Ii) the DAO employs Trail of Bits for an audit as soon as possible.\n\n*$1m is the new standard for top DeFi protocols*\n\n- $1m bug bounty at Immunefi is in line with other DeFi protocols such as Tracer, Tokemak, Rari and Perpetual.\n- The full bounty would only be paid for potential serious exploits of the protocol, which could cause a loss of user funds.\n- Bounty would be structured as payment of 10% of the potential exploit (capped at $1m): so an exploit worth $10m or more would need to be found to pay the full amount.\n- If this situation were to occur we believe the DAO would be happy to pay out $1m to prevent an exploit.\n\n*Trail of Bits are one of the best auditors in DeFi*\n\n- Trail of Bits have been hired to provide smart contract reviews by DeFi protocols including Balancer, Uniswap, Tokemak, Yearn, Frax and many more.\n- A Trail of Bits audit will be a rigorous examination of Gro’s smart contracts, and provide additional reassurance to future users - encouraging more TVL into Gro.\n- Trail of Bits have already audited a new Gro strategy (being launched soon), and there is a positive working relationship with them.\n- The cost would be ~$320k and the value to Gro of avoiding a potential exploit is significantly higher than this (both user funds and future reputation/value).\n- In addition, the DAO is well capitalised after the LBP and this is affordable.\n\n\nHOW WAS THIS PROPOSAL DISCUSSED?\n\nThis proposal was put together by early contributors behind the Gro protocol with valuable inputs from the Gro DAO. \n\nIt has been shared and discussed in the Gro governance forum: \nhttps://community.gro.xyz/t/vote-3-security/151 \n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n- Gro protocol’s bounty on Immunefi: https://immunefi.com/bounty/gro/\n- Trail of Bits: https://www.trailofbits.com/ \n\n",

      "content": "**PROPOSAL SUMMARY**\n\nIf executed, this proposal will:\n\t1.\tRemove liquidity from the LBP into the underlying assets (GRO and USDC)\n\t2.\tAdd liquidity pairs for GRO into various AMMs\n\t3.\tReturn the 2.65M USDC loan to Grwth Lbs Limited (plus any applicable interest)\n\t4.\tExecute liquidity mining program to distribute GRO to users of Gro protocol\n\nEach of these actions will be executed by the Gro DAO multi-sig with any necessary decisions delegated to the teams building Gro protocol and / or the multi-sig itself.\n\n**CLOSE THE LBP**\n\nSubject to vote 2a passing and an LBP being successfully launched, this proposal authorises the Gro DAO multi-sig to remove liquidity from the LBP, at some point during the 7 days after the end of the LBP (the end is proposed to be around 16:00 UTC on Friday 1 October). \n\nThis vote delegates authority to the team building Gro protocol and the multi-sig to decide on an appropriate exit point based on the agreed objectives of (1) distributing the Gro DAO Token in a way that benefits the Gro DAO, (2) attracting liquidity to Gro protocol, and (3) ensuring a smooth and orderly process.\n\n**NEW POOLS AND LIQUIDITY MINING PROGRAM**\n\nThis proposal authorises the Gro DAO multi-sig to initialise and contribute liquidity to pools on AMMs which may include (but are not limited to) Uniswap, Sushiswap, Balancer.\n\nGro DAO Treasury multi-sig will contribute what the team consider to be sufficient liquidity for each and any of those pools to function well.\n\nThe liquidity mining rewards program will be initialised together with the pools, and will be designed with vesting conditions in such a way that incentivises long term use of Gro protocol (and discourages token flipping or dumping). This means that all non-LBP tokens have vesting conditions which should support a more stable and orderly price development of the GRO DAO token.\n\n**Not more than 20%** of the total GRO allocated for community incentives (i.e. 9m GRO out of 45m GRO allocated for community incentives) will be distributed without a further governance vote. \n\nThis proposal considers that liquidity mining is good for $GRO holders. While liquidity mining could be perceived as dilutive, it’s essential to drive TVL and grow the protocol. The various constraints put in place through vesting should also stabilise the price and concentrate control/governance to those with a longer commitment to the protocol.\n\nThis vote delegates authority to the teams building Gro protocol and the multi-sig to decide on appropriate pools and liquidity mining structures and rewards based on the agreed objectives of (1) distributing the Gro DAO token in a way that benefits the Gro DAO, (2) attracting liquidity to Gro protocol, and (3) ensuring a smooth and orderly market for the token itself.\n \n**PROPOSAL BACKGROUND**\nThis proposal is conditional on two pre-existing DAO governance votes: \n* Vote 1b: LBP preparations which you can review on Snapshot: https://vote.gro.xyz/#/proposal/QmNpKgL55x7jtZgz4bcYpYheNaztWbCxkWqni4jAbJTeDW \n* Vote 2a: Start GRO / USDC LBP which you can review on Snapshot: https://vote.gro.xyz/#/proposal/QmWdivQnVFT5nueeiDNUWycecfcS5FKtQCTkN7jqDqAHhJ\n\n**HOW WAS THIS PROPOSAL DISCUSSED?**\nThis proposal was put together by early contributors behind the Gro protocol, in line with the early governance plans for Gro DAO.\nIt has been shared and discussed in the Gro governance forum: https://community.gro.xyz/t/vote-2b-remove-liquidity-from-lbp-and-start-liquidity-mining-program/29 \n",

This proposal takes another important step on this journey by preparing for wider distribution of the Gro DAO Token using an LBP._\n\n_You can read more about Gro’s approach to decentralisation here: https://groprotocol.medium.com/the-chicken-or-the-egg-how-gro-dao-is-launching-governance-e02fdcd452d0_\n\n**PROPOSAL SUMMARY**\n\nIf executed, this proposal will:\n1. Agree the LBP specifications for the Gro DAO Token launch.\n2. Approve the funding of the pool from the Gro DAO Wallet (for GRO) and from a loan from Grwth Lbs Ltd (for USDC). \n3. Create the pool used for the LBP. \n\n**PROPOSAL BACKGROUND**\n\nThis is a proposal to make 5% of the Gro DAO Token (GRO) supply available for interested parties within the Gro community. It uses Balancer, a decentralized exchange and leverages a mechanism called Liquidity Bootstrapping.\nThe benefits of a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) would be to:\n* Distribute the GRO token among the wider Gro community, beyond early contributors and team members.\n* Build deep liquidity for the Gro network, setting it up for long-term success.\n* Begin price discovery for the Gro token.\nProceeds from the event will be held by the Gro DAO Treasury, a smart contract fully controlled by the Gro token holders.\n\n**LBP SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n* Pool tokens: `GRO` and `USDC`\n* GRO start balance: 5M\n* USDC start balance: 2.65M\n* GRO start weight: 95\n* GRO end weight: 50\n* USDC start weight: 5\n* USDC end weight: 50\n* Swap fee: 1.5%\n* Duration: 72hrs \n\n**FUNDING OF LIQUIDITY BOOTSTRAPPING POOL**\n\nThe LBP needs to be seeded with initial GRO tokens USDC in order to create the necessary liquidity for participants to access Gro.\nGro provided will either remain at the same level in the pool (if no activity) or decrease in number as USDC is traded out for it.\nUSDC will either remain at the same level in the pool (if no activity) or increase in number as there is no additional GRO in circulation that could decrease the amount of the USDC below the starting number. That means it is possible to provide USDC as a loan with relatively little downside risk.\n* 5m GRO will be provided by the Gro DAO Treasury wallet.\n* 2.65m USDC will be provided **as a loan by Grwth Lbs Ltd**, to be repaid after the LBP together with interest (paid pro-rata at a rate of 10% APY) when funds are removed from the pool. \n\n**What is a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool?**\n\nBalancer’s Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) is a Balancer pool that automatically adjusts its token weights over time. This applies downwards price pressure on the token and disincentivizes front-running, speculation and whale buying. See Balancer’s Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool FAQ for more information.\n\n**Why a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool?**\n\nThe Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool is a battle-tested mechanism for price discovery and liquidity building. It’s been successfully used by numerous teams including Hydra, APY Finance, Maple, Radicle, Klima and Perpetual protocol.\n\n**HOW WAS THIS PROPOSAL DISCUSSED?**\n\nThis proposal was put together by early contributors behind the Gro protocol, in line with the early governance plans for Gro DAO. \nIt has been shared and discussed on the Gro governance forum: https://community.gro.xyz/t/vote-1b-proceed-with-lbp-preparations/18 \n\n**PAYLOAD DETAILS**\n\nPayload 1 creates the LBP:\n`0x751A0bC0e3f75b38e01Cf25bFCE7fF36DE1C87DE.create(\"GRO DAO Token Launch\", \"GROLBPT\", [\"0x3Ec8798B81485A254928B70CDA1cf0A2BB0B74D7\", \"0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48\"], [950000000000000000, 50000000000000000], 15000000000000000, 0x359F4fe841f246a095a82cb26F5819E10a91fe0d, false)`",
