Its mission is to transform the conventional banking system by allowing depositors to earn interest from borrowing activities in the decentralized ecosystem. The concept of Polter materialized after the discontinuation of the $GEIST platform on Fantom, leaving a gap that the Polter team swiftly addressed by implementing the same reliable smart contract structure that had garnered trust and familiarity among users. By adopting this proven smart contract framework, Polter not only ensures a smooth transition, but also instills a sense of trust within its user base. This decision reflects Polter's dedication to building upon the successful foundations of its predecessors, while simultaneously addressing any previous shortcomings.\n\nTo learn more about POLTERTOKEN, visit their official communication channels:\n\n\nWebsite: https://polter.finance/#/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/polterfinance\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/polterfinance\n\n\nHow do you stake xBOO to earn POLTERrewards?\n\nIf you own BOO tokens, congratulations!

      "content": "The proposed changes represent the largest farm overhaul in almost two years, with the primary objective being to redirect BOO rewards from underperforming farms towards increasing liquidity for the USDC-FTM pair. Additionally, a new high volume pair, PEPE-FTM, will be introduced to Spookyswap to generate significant volume and fees.\n\nThe proposal also includes adjustments to existing farms based on their 30-day volume and liquidity, including the closure of expired partnered staking pools. Boosting USDC-FTM's liquidity is crucial to maintain Fantom's high volume and deep liquidity.\n\nThe new PEPE-FTM farm will have a weight of 1.0x, but its weight can be adjusted as necessary based on its volume. Meanwhile, several other farms will see their weights reduced, such as FTM-ALPACA, FTM-SPELL, and FTM-LQDR, among others.\n\nOverall, these proposed changes are expected to improve Spookyswap's liquidity, generate higher trading volume, and better align BOO rewards with top-performing farms.\n\n\n\n|   New Farm   | Weight (new) |\n|:---------:|:------------:|\n| PEPE-FTM | 1.0x |\n\n\n\n|   Farm   | Weight (old) | Weight (new) |\n|:---------:|:------------:|:------------:|\n|USDC-FTM     |      9.0x     |    15.69x     |\n|SUSHI-FTM      |      0.4x     |    0.15x     |  \n|CRV-FTM     |      1.6x     |    1.0x     |  \n|BNB-FTM     |      2.0x     |    1.3x     |  \n|BIFI-FTM     |      0.3x     |    0.2x     |  \n|ETH-YFI     |      0.5x     |    0.2x     |  \n|FTM-TAROT    |      1.0x     |   0.1x     | \n|LQDR-FTM      |      0.6x     |    0.01x     |\n|FTM-SPELL      |     0.6x     |    0.2x     | \n|USDC-MAI    |      1.0x     |    0.2x     |\n|FTM-AVAX      |     1.2x     |    0.8x     |   \n|FTM-BEETS      |      0.5x     |    0.25x     |\n|FTM-ALPACA     |     0.3x     |    0.1x     | \n|BOO-USDC    |      3.7x     |    2.0x     |\n",

Special mention goes to ETH/BOO since that one came as a need for a Chainlink oracle.\n\nSpooky DAO is not pursuing an aggressive management model both because of risk and because of actual management entailed.\n\n#### Proposal\nSpooky DAO will start pursuing an active treasury investment opportunity delegating such decision making authority to the Team which will present to Spooky DAO a detailed analysis at the end of each quarter. This proposal aims to provide the Team with the authority to initiate the investments needed.\n\nThe assets will be managed thru a Safe to ensure an initial risk management.\nIdeas to be pursued:\nLending\nStaking\nBonding\nCollateral and Borrowing with safety margins\n\n#### Options\nApprove proposal\nFurther discussions needed\nReject proposal\n",

The Orbs platform is a decentralized, open and transparent network that offers practical blockchain solutions for enterprises and other large-scale consumer applications.\n\nThe Orbs protocol uses the ORBS token, which calculates commissions for executed applications and provides an incentive system that is used to select validators, thereby ensuring the integrity of the network. The ORBS token serves as the only means of payment on the Orbs platform.\n\nOrbs was established in 2017 and was developed by experienced engineers, businessmen and scientists who have managed to create an infrastructure that uses blockchain virtualization and randomized proof-of-stake (RPoS) to ensure blockchain scalability.\n\nOrbs is an ERC-20 token that operates on the Ethereum platform. Tokens are the main means of payment for all services on the Orbs platform. Via the token, users can pay for services from infrastructure operators and the token is also used to select validators and to manage the protocol in general.\n\n**To learn more about ORBS, Grim advises you to visit their official communication channels:**\n* Website: https://www.orbs.com/\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/orbs_network\n* Github: https://github.com/orbs-network/\n* Discord: https://twitter.com/orbs_network\n* CoinGecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/orbs\n\n\n**How do you stake xBOO to earn ORBS rewards?**\nIf you own BOO tokens, congratulations! You’re one step away from staking xBOO. It’s easy to learn how to stake xBOO for Partnered Staking.\n* Visit this webpage: https://spookyswap.finance/pools\n* Click “Approve” on the Buyback BOO Single Stake pool\n* Click on the “+ Stake” button\n* Enter your amount of BOO\n* Confirm the transaction, this will get you xBOO\n* Then, click “Approve” on the ORBS Pool\n* Click on the “+ Stake” button\n* Enter your amount of xBOO\n* Confirm the transaction\n\n\n**ORBS Address**\n\nBeware scam tokens!

Now that the situation has stabilized, although at a lower level than before due to general market conditions, this proposal suggests to again dedicate a small % of trading fees to the acquisition of protocol-owned liquidity.\nBefore the pause, 15% of the 0.03% of trading fees went into POL acquisition.\nIn the current situation, two scenarios come to mind:\n\nReinstate POL acquisition with 15%\nReinstate POL acquisition with 10% and dedicate 5% to the team for development costs\n\nThe line of thinking for the latter option is the following: Spooky is in the luxurious position that it generates substantial continuous revenue through buybacks. In addition, the team stayed small through the bull market while other projects expanded their teams to 30+ members. If the bear market is here to stay, giving Spooky the ability to acquire top talent from projects that are struggling, would be a massive competitive advantage. Most of us have experienced how much a 10x developer can accomplish compared to more average teams, so seizing this opportunity should be considered.",

Borrowers can deposit LP tokens in a lending pool to borrow additional tokens in the token pair. This enables borrowers to leverage their LP tokens for even more LP tokens, allowing for leveraged yield farming and enhanced LP rewards.\n\n\n\nStaked TAROT (xTAROT) is the gateway for on-chain governance of the Tarot Protocol.\nWith xTAROT, stakeholders will govern and shape the future of Tarot. This includes the ongoing maintenance of key parameters, fees, and rates in the Tarot Protocol, as well as determining the distribution of fees accrued to the protocol reserves. \n\n**To learn more about Tarot Grim advises you to visit their official communication channels:**\n* Website: https://www.tarot.to/\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/TarotFinance\n* Medium: https://tarotfinance.medium.com/\n* Github: https://github.com/tarot-finance\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/6ByFHBjqE8\n* CoinGecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tarot\n\n\n**How do you stake xBOO to earn xTAROT rewards?**\nIf you own BOO tokens, congratulations!

      "title": "Prop-023 - Rebalance BOO-FTM",
      "content": "**Proposal for rebalancing BOO-FTM** \n\nThis new proposal aims to reduce BOO-FTM by 8x weight. The current allocation of 28x would be reduced to 20x. This is intended to diversify BOO by both lessening its reliance on the FTM token and lowering the cost of liquidity for BOO-FTM. \n\n**5x weight will be moved to BOO-USDC** \n**3x weight will be used to bond BOO-FTM with Olympus Pro permanently**\n\n\nWhat is Olympus Pro\n\nOlympus Pro by Olympus DAO is the new industry-standard platform to help protocols acquire their own liquidity. Protocols no longer need to pay out high incentives to rent liquidity, while also guaranteeing the permanence of liquidity to facilitate transactions.\n\nOlympus Pro solves for liquidity problems by providing bonds-as-a-service for a small fee.\nInstead of staking their LP (liquidity provider) tokens for farming rewards in a pool 2, users can exchange their LP tokens for the protocol's governance tokens at a discounted rate. This is done through a process called Bonding. As the protocol never sells these LP tokens, the liquidity is effectively locked within its treasury.\n\n\nWebsite:https://pro.olympusdao.finance/#/bond\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OlympusDAO\nTelegram: https://t.me/OlympusTG\nMedium: https://olympusdao.medium.com/\nDocs: https://docs.olympusdao.finance/pro\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/olympusdao\nGithub: https://github.com/OlympusDAO\n",

With this new pair, people can buy BOO for less which can make it more enticing.\nAdditional yield to BOO holders, this farm will raise the % of Farm rewards directed to BOO pairs, raising the amount of inflation directed towards those more likely to hold BOO.\n\n|   New Farm   | Weight (new) |\n|:---------:|:------------:|\n| BOO-USDC      |      3x     |\n| APE-FTM | 0.5x |\n\nThis Prop also comes with adjusting existing farms, these adjustments are based on 30d volume and liquidity, some of which are expired partnered staking pools.\n\nThe resulting net farm changes is a reduction of 2.3x weight!

In theory this should increase BOO price and therefore increase revenue even more than 0.03% for LPs. \n\nAs a daily user of Spookyswap, I don't think a 0.05% fee increase would put me off at all. I use Spooky for the amazing user experience, the team and the unmatched liquidity. \n\nWith new Protocols like SOLID launching, we need to keep innovating, and maximising value for xBOO holders and LPs. Ask yourself this, do you think people would stop using Spookyswap due to this fee increase? IMO not at all. \n\nThanks for reading,\nHave a good day :)\n",

However, there are some costs involved with the listing that the DAO will need to pay if the proposal passes. Also, as a requirement for listing, the CEX requires $500,000 worth of liquidity and as such we will need to hire a Market Maker to fulfill that obligation.\n\n**The breakdown of the funding request is as follows:**\n*  A Mixture of upwards of $300,000 of BOO and USDT to be used for things such as marketing.\n* The CEX requires $500,000 worth of liquidity as a mixture of BOO and USDT which will be met with the assistance of a market maker. The BOO and USDT mixture would be deposited into the Market Makers accounts.\n* The Market Maker charges upwards of $10,000 a month, which would be a persistent recurring cost to the DAO, however they will also be able to help if/when we get listed on other Centralized exchanges without much added cost.\n* Any PNL and/or trading fees incurred by the Market Maker would be covered by the DAO\n\nThe Market Maker we have chosen to hire is Kronos Research.  They are a trusted partner of WOO Network, who Spooky is a partner with, as well.\n\nWebsite: https://kronosresearch.com/\n\nNote: Kronos Research does not attempt to influence market price in either direction.\n\n**Kronos Background:**\nKronos Research is a proprietary trading firm founded in 2018 that trades on average more than $5b USD per day across global platforms. In DeFi, Kronos Research is a leading designated market-maker on platforms like dYdX, Matcha, and ParaSwap. Kronos Research also incubated and is the sole market maker on WOO Network and WOO X.\n",

      "content": "Should 43,500 BOO (approx $1m) from the DAO allocation be used for the DAO to own its own liquidity in the form of BOO-FTM spLP? Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) would allow for less variation in the liquidity amount and ensure long term longevity of BOO.\n\nAbout Olympus pro:\nOlympus Pro is the new industry-standard platform to help protocols acquire their own liquidity. Protocols no longer need to pay out high incentives to rent liquidity, while also guaranteeing the permanence of liquidity to facilitate transactions.\n\nOlympus Pro solves these liquidity problems by providing bonds-as-a-service for a small fee.\n\nInstead of staking their LP (liquidity provider) tokens for farming rewards in a pool 2, users can exchange their LP tokens for the protocol's governance tokens at a discounted rate. This is done through a process called Bonding. As the protocol never sells these LP tokens, the liquidity is effectively locked within its treasury.\n\n**You can learn more about it here** :\n\n* Website : https://www.olympusdao.finance/pro\n* Doc : https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/\n* Twitter : https://twitter.com/OlympusDAO\n* Discord : https://discord.com/invite/6QjjtUcfM4\n* Medium : https://olympusdao.medium.com/\n\n**Further Details**:\n\n* 43,500 BOO will be allocated from the DAO share.\n* Users will be able to acquire BOO at a discount by vesting their BOO-FTM spLP tokens over a 5-days vesting period\n* Discount is determined by the market, based on Supply and Demand\n* At the end of the vesting period, the DAO would own the BOO-FTM spLP tokens\n* Olympus pro takes a 3.3% fee on LP tokens used for bonding\n* Duration : 31 days. \n* After this duration we could consider allocating a portion of farm emissions to Olympus Pro permanently for the DAO to continuously acquire BOO-FTM liquidity.",

This proposal is for Spookyswap to offer bribes in the form of BOO OR FTM OR USDC to fBeets holders in return for their vote in the upcoming gauge vote within 2 weeks.\n\nBoo DAO will use treasury BOO to farm said pool to increase its treasury diversification and use IDLE boo to generate passive income and strengthen the ARB opportunity between 2 dexes (this will reward BOO-FTM LPers greatly).\n\nThe previous beets gauge vote yielded almost a 10x ROI per 1,000$ allocated for bribes to protocols that participated. This could be a lucrative opportunity for Spookyswap.\n\nPros:\n- Increase BOO liquidity on other DEX\n- Make use of idle BOO sitting in the treasury to generate fees to the DAO for increased diversification\n- Create more fees for BOO-FTM Spookyswap LP",

This means that HEC will always be worth equal to, or more, than DAI.\n\n\nHector DAO aims to become the de-facto reserve currency of the FTM Opera network, one which is truly owned and maintained by a decentralised protocol which serves the majority. The goal is for HEC to be a common trading pair which is backed by real assets.\n\n\n**What is wsHEC?**\nwsHEC is the wrapped version of sHEC, which is staked HEC.

      "content": "**SpookySwap Welcomes YEL Community to Partnered Staking!**\nxBOO holders, today we are happy to be able to offer you the next partnered staking pool featuring YEL.\n\n**The xBOO Pool:**\nStake xBOO tokens to earn YEL tokens!\n* Total Tokens: 1,400,000 YEL\n* Distribution duration: 60 days\n* Start time: 1637035200 November 16th, 2021 0400 UTC\n* Finish time: 1642219200 January 15th, 2021 0400 UTC\n* Token rewards per second: 0.27 YEL\n\n\n**The Farm:**\nIn addition to the YEL xBOO Pool, we would provide an FTM-YEL farm that will have 1.0x BOO rewards for the first 48 hours and then 0.5x BOO rewards after that.\n\n\n**What is YEL?**\nYEL is a multichain yield enhancement and aggregation platform. Its core mission is to build an ecosystem with several protocols functioning simultaneously to maximize returns for users while helping other DeFi projects to gather multichain liquidity. \nThis is done through automated farming strategies, the launchpad for projects to boost their liquidity, and enhancement protocols. \nGenerated fees will always be used for buybacks of YEL tokens, which then are being distributed for rewards and enhancement purposes, hence creating a looped circulation with constant buy pressure from the protocol.\n\n\n\n**To learn more about the YEL Community, Grim advises you to visit their official communication channels:**\n* Website: https://yel.finance\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/yel_finance\n* Telegram: https://twitter.com/yel_finance\n* Docs: https://yield-enhancement-labs.gitbook.io/yield-enhancement-labs/\n* Blog: https://yel-finance.medium.com/\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/yelfinance\n* Github: https://github.com/YieldEnhancementLabs\n* CoinGecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/yel-finance\n\n\n**How do you stake xBOO to earn YEL rewards?**\nIf you own BOO tokens, congratulations! You’re one step away from staking xBOO. It’s easy to learn how to stake xBOO for Partnered Staking.\n* Visit this webpage: https://spookyswap.finance/pools\n* Click “Approve” on the Buyback BOO Single Stake pool\n* Click on the “+ Stake” button\n* Enter your amount of BOO\n* Confirm the transaction, this will get you xBOO\n* Then, click “Approve” on the YEL Pool\n* Click on the “+ Stake” button\n* Enter your amount of xBOO\n* Confirm the transaction\n\n\n**YEL Address**\n\nBeware scam tokens!

      "content": "This new farm change proposal has a goal to direct BOO rewards to the highest performing pairs and the adjustments are data-backed based on 30 day volume and liquidity.\n\nOne thing some may notice is the changes result in a net 1.5x weight gain resulting in a positive APR gain across ALL farms.\n\nOur new Farm introduced in this proposal is USDC-MAI with a weight of 0.7x. MAI is the stable coin minted at the Mai Finance protocol using a variety of assets, including interest bearing ones from beefy. \n\nIf this Farm is implemented, Mai Finance will introduce Spooky LP tokens as collateral, represented using beefy.finance receipt tokens. What this means is you will be able to borrow MAI using spooky LP tokens that have been deposited in beefy. So you are minting MAI with an auto compounding farm position! Layering of yield and leverage is now possible!\n\nHow it will work is as follows:\n1. Deposit liquidity on SpookySwap\n2. Deposit the just received LP Tokens on beefy.finance. You are now farming BOO and it is auto compounding. Beefy gives you a receipt token representing your position.\n3. Deposit the receipt token on mai.finance\n4. Borrow Mai\n5. ???\n6.

      "content": "Should 9300 BOO from the DAO allocation be used for the DAO to own its own liquidity in the form of BOO-FTM spLP? It would allow for less variation in the liquidity amount and ensure long term longevity of BOO.\n\n**About Olympus pro:**\nOlympus Pro is the new industry-standard platform to help protocols acquire their own liquidity. Protocols no longer need to pay out high incentives to rent liquidity, while also guaranteeing the permanence of liquidity to facilitate transactions.\n\nOlympus Pro solves these liquidity problems by providing bonds-as-a-service for a small fee.\n\nInstead of staking their LP (liquidity provider) tokens for farming rewards in a pool 2, users can exchange their LP tokens for the protocol's governance tokens at a discounted rate. This is done through a process called Bonding. As the protocol never sells these LP tokens, the liquidity is effectively locked within its treasury.\n\nYou can learn more about it here :\n* Website : https://www.olympusdao.finance/pro\n* Doc : https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/\n* Twitter : https://twitter.com/OlympusDAO\n* Discord : https://discord.com/invite/6QjjtUcfM4\n* Medium : https://olympusdao.medium.com/\n\n**Further Details:**\nIf passed, BOO will be included in the Olympus Pro platform on Thursday, November 4th\n* 9300 BOO will be allocated from the DAO share.\n* Users will be able to acquire BOO at a discount by vesting their BOO-FTM spLP tokens over a 5-days vesting period\n* Discount is determined by the market, based on Supply and Demand\n* At the end of the vesting period, the DAO would own the BOO-FTM spLP tokens\n* Olympus pro takes 3.3% fee on LP tokens used for bonding\n* Duration : 31 days. We would launch another vote roughly 1 week prior to the trial ending to see if the community decides to extend the offer and/or modify allocations.\n\nAfter this duration we could consider allocating a portion of farm emissions to Olympus Pro permanently for the DAO to continuously acquire BOO-FTM liquidity.\n",

      "title": "Farm adjustment, ETH-BTC Farm",
      "content": "This is a large farm change proposal aimed at redirecting emissions to high volume pairs, free up some weight and possibly add a new farm, ETH-BTC! \n\nWhy ETH-BTC? This is one of if not the most power pair in Crypto and with Spooky's low trade fee and Fantoms Fast/cheap transactions, we think this pair has a high potential to bring a lot of TVL and volume to Spooky. If in the future it is underperforming, just like any other farm, we will make a proposal to adjust it as necessary. In addition this vote allows for multiple choices so be sure to choose whichever you prefer!\n\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is the chart below that details \"Dilution Change\". If this proposal passes and is enacted, the farm will have a net weight gain resulting in less diluted farms across the board. With ETH-BTC being added, a +1.3x dilution change, without it a +2.8x dilution change. To put it simply, when weight is freed up like this every farm benefits from gaining more emissions relative to their size.\n\nThis freed up weight also allows us to add partner staking pools without dilution existing farms as much.\n\nHere is an example to better illustrate how dilution changes affect other farms:\n\n* Under performing farm = 0.5x (0.1 BOO Per Second)\n* High performing farm = 0.5x (0.1 BOO Per Second)\n\n**Remove under performing farm (but high performing is unchanged!)**\n\n* Under performing farm = 0x (0 BOO Per Second)\n* High performing farm = 0.5x (0.2 BOO Per Second)\n\nFarm weight adjustments are based on the farms 30 day volume, liquidity, unique token holders, the tokens market cap and other factors.\n\n\n|    Farm   | Weight (old) | Weight (new) |\n|:---------:|:------------:|:------------:|\n| FTM-USDC |       7      |      9     |\n|  FTM-DAI |       4      |      3    |\n|  FTM-wBTC  |       4      |       3.5      |\n|  FTM-SUSHI |       2      |       1.8      |\n|  FTM-CRV  |       1.8      |      1.7       |\n|  FTM-AAVE  |       1.7      |       1.1      |\n|  FTM-SNX  |       1.3      |       0.6      |\n|  FTM-ANY  |       0.8      |       0.6      |\n|  FTM-WOOFY  |       0.8      |       0.6      |\n|  FTM-CREAM  |       0.7      |       0.3      |\n|  FTM-BADGER  |       0.4      |       0      |\n|  FTM-ZOO  |       0.4      |       0.2      |\n|  FTM-BIFI  |       0.4      |       0.3      |\n|  FTM-BAND  |       0.2      |       0      |\n|  FTM-KEK  |       0.2      |       0.1      |\n\n|    New Farm   | Weight | \n|:---------:|:------------:|\n|  wETH-wBTC  |       1.5      | \n\n|    Dilution Change   | Net Gain| \n|:---------:|:------------:|\n|  With new Farm  |       1.3      |\n|  Without new Farm  |       2.8      |  \n",

      "content": "I propose that we increase the XBOO rewards to .05% from .03%. This would increase the value of staking $BOO outside of the liquidity pool, leading to increased value for stakeholders. This would likely have a positive impact on the price of BOO, which in turn would have the indirect benefit of increasing the value of reward incentives to liquidity pools, leading to a positive feedback loop of increased TVL growth and volume. \n\nRelative to most decentralized exchanges, Spookyswap already charges a very low fee to swap of only 0.2% when most major dexes have a 0.3% fee. Personally, I can attest to the fact that the cost of trading using a dex is far more affected by the liquidity of the dex than the swap fee. Increasing the swap fee by this small increment(To 0.22% from 0.2%) could lead to greatly increased TVL growth, which would bring down the overall cost of swapping, especially for larger traders, all the while increasing profits for stakeholders. It's a win-win.",

We are a fork of Tornado.Cash as they achieve 100% privacy and their contracts are heavily audited. Privacy is achieved by using a smart contract that only accepts a fixed amount of a token (FTM, USDC, SHADE, xBOO) to be deposited that can then be withdrawn by a different address. ShadeCash will have an integral role in the Fantom ecosystem. To further preserve privacy our team is also working on getting a Relayer set up which would allow deposits to be withdrawn to any empty wallet. Anonymity Mining is also in development to incentivise depositing into the mixers to increase the anonymity sets. Our upcoming new pools will allow $SHADE token to be staked to earn protocol fees.\n\n**To learn more about SHADE Finance, grim advises you to visit their official communication channels:**\n* Website: https://shade.cash/\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/ShadeCash_\n* Telegram: https://t.me/ShadeCash\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/ZeuxWH3Kk2\n* Blog: https://shadecash.medium.com/\n\n**How do you stake xBOO to earn SHADE rewards?**\nIf you own BOO tokens, congratulations!

      "content": "**SpookySwap Welcomes Scream.sh to Partnered Staking!**\nxBOO holders, today we are happy to be able to offer you the first partnered staking pool featuring SCREAM, a DeFi lending protocol that facilitates the borrowing of crypto assets by using real world and DeFi assets as collateral.\n\n**The xBOO Pool:**\nStake xBOO tokens to earn SCREAM tokens!\n* Total Tokens: 1700 SCREAM\n* Distribution duration: 60 days\n* Start time: 1630328400 August 30th, 2021 1300 UTC\n* Finish time: 1635512400 October 29th, 2021 1300 UTC\n* Token rewards per second:  0.0003279 SCREAM\n\n**The Farm:**\nIn addition to the SCREAM xBOO Pool, we would provide a SCREAM-FTM farm that will have 0.8x BOO rewards for the first 48 hours and then 0.4x BOO rewards after that.\n\n**What is SCREAM Finance?**\nSCREAM is a decentralized lending protocol built on the Fantom network. SCREAM leverages the highly-scalable and high-throughput capabilities of Fantom to provide cheap lending and borrowing solutions for mass adoption.

Utilizing special Woof technology, it allows two-way conversion between the two tokens, allowing holders to be exposed to YFI in a fluffier package. At its core, WOOFY solves two problems: YFI not being dog themed, and the price of a single YFI being too high in USD terms.\"\n\nIt would be done such that the total weight of YFI and WOOFY at any point in time would not exceed the current weight of YFI and the end result would be such that the WOOFY farm would completely replace the YFI farm. To clarify further, the rewards of all other farms will not be impacted at any point in time by this transition.\n\nWOOFY is always pegged to YFI at a ratio of 1 YFI : 1 Million WOOFY this conversion can always be done on https://woofy.finance/ on the Ethereum network and works in both directions.",
