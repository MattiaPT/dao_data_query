The previous beacon of hope, Schmelon Shmusk has fled on his spaceship to Mars along with his memes. But in this hour of darkness, there is one group that remains‚Ä¶\n\nA group that still live the degen life, sippin' on that sweet JPEG juice, chilling in the bar and always craving an opportunity to ape in.\n\nTheir ethos is simple. They are wild and free. They take risks. They have fun. They fkn love memes. They have each others backs, always. And above all, they are unapologetically degen to their core.\n\nThey call themselves Degen Gang.\"\n\nOFFICIAL LINKS: \n\nüï∏Ô∏è WEBSITE -  https://degengang.io/\n\nüê¶ TWITTER - https://twitter.com/Degenganghq \n\nü•è DISCORD - http://discord.gg/degengang\n\nDEGEN GANG - Official OpenSea: https://opensea.io/collection/degengang\n\n\nWhy buy 4 Degens?\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Degenganghq/status/1638654714098204678\n\nThere will be a tournament with the launch of Fight Club.\nThere are prizes for the first 10 places. It would be a good idea if Gray Boys participated with these 4 Degen Gang. Why 4? It would allow dueling between members of the Gray Boys community using the proxy.\n\nI think it would be really cool for Gray Boys to support this Web 3 project that has been building for over a year.\n\nThe expense is really minor so I hope you will all accept this proposal  :) \nI hope to see you in the bar fight (Our ape can also fight in the arena) ",

Purchasing an OCM Genesis on Ethereum grants you ownership of this scarce and historic asset on both Ethereum and Bitcoin simultaneously. And it doesn't stop there. OCM Genesis is your passport to our wealthy digital nation, in which we are building wealth for our holders and have numerous launches coming in 2023!\nOpensea for OCM: https://opensea.io/collection/onchainmonkey\nOpensea for KARMA: https://opensea.io/collection/karma-monkey\nTEAM: https://onchainmonkey.com/team\nWiki: https://onchainmonkey.gitbook.io/wiki/\n\nB) Strategic reasoning for the Acquisition/Sale:\nThis project has a wide array of holders / investors from all walks of life. Bill Thai is co-founder and a multi-billionaire VC investor.  Charlie Lee (inventor of litecoin and multi-billionaire) is also an investor and one of the biggest holders. Woody Harrelson and Owen Wilson. Holly Branson of Virgin Atlantic. Kevin Lin CoFounder of Twitch. Etc.\n\nCheck the Dev: https://www.linkedin.com/in/huuep/\nOnchain monkey dev is a genius / PhD Comp Sci from Stanford, undergrad from Harvard, also ran the largest crypto exchange in Taiwan. He inscribed all OCM genesis onto bitcoin in one inscription, becoming the first 10k collection fully on chain on both Ethereum and Bitcoin, beating the derivative of the CryptoPunks. If you hold a OCM Genesis you also own a Ordinal Genesis. \n\nLink to More about OCM and Inscriptions: https://twitter.com/OnChainMonkey/status/1623784604309278720?s=20&t=PoZUqUEg_z_T3mH7S9cLpwhttps://twitter.com/x_hooli/status/1612343476380905472?s=20&t=L5piaSR-_ZZ8jtmwBQ20FQ\n\nPurchasing an OnChain Monkey NFT would allow the DAO to own one of the first ever 10K collections on Bitcoin Ordinals. We would also be able to use proxy to get the OCM Sandbox Avatar in the Sandbox game. Purchasing 2 OCM Karma NFTs will allow us decision making in the Monkeyverse DAO as well as \"access to missions and the banana economy.\" There are benefits to holding all 3 and details have yet to be announced.\n\nThere are many activations coming in 2023 for OCM and Ordinals were the first. The next activations include a major artwork release by Alexis Andr√©, creator of Friendship Bracelets.\n\nIf we own all three types of monkeys it is said to be an extended activation (similar to BAYC and the sewer pass) in upcoming experiences.\n1. OnChain Monkey Genesis\n2. 1 OCM Karma w/ (Incredible) trait\n3. 1 OCM Karma w/ (Divine) trait\nIf we have all 3 we'll get top tier unlocks.\n\n C) Breakdown of the budget, including the range of pricing:\n‚ÄúWe will acquire 1 OnChain Monkey NFT and 1 OCM Karma (Incredible) & 1 OCM Karma (Divine), from the floor, with a budget of 2.2 ETH for an OnChain Monkey NFT, .5 ETH for the OCM Karma (Incredible) NFT, & 1.3 ETH for the OCM Karma (Divine) NFT, totaling a max spend of 4 ETH.\n\nD) Vote ‚ÄúYes‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo‚Äù\n\nE) Current DAO funds in ETH, shown here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x16DbCd202be906c36667258799155d48Fb6C9584",

They've developed live motion capture technology that is being implemented in game and allows them to scale animation process (unlike any other team in gaming today.) They have strategic partnerships with L1 Blockchains, a major new Web3 player (TBA), Unreal Engine, Epic Games, and Netflix.\n\n1.

They'll be attending and announcing some other items at one of the largest gaming industry events in MARCH. (Game Developer's Conference.)  They have a few partnerships with (A) household name(s) that have yet to be announced. They'll be featured as a playable character in one of the top ten franchises of all time that has yet to be announced.\n\nWhat about Proxy?: Purchasing a My Pet Hooligan NFT will not only give access to the Rabbit Hole Game, Tournaments, Events, it'll also give us creator content tools which can be monetized in game, access to a store where we can sell items we design in game, and an additional rental IP for the marketplace. Similar to what the DAO did with the Sewer Pass, we would be able to use the MPH for Proxy completions as a way to draw in more attention and interest on Gray Boys and Proxy. Owning 3 would allow more people to join a competition at a time not having to wait as someone else is playing. \n\nWe can also stake the Hooligans for $Karrots. We receive 10 $Karrots for each day the hooligans are staked. We receive a faction bonus of 20% if we acquire hooligans from 3 different factions.\n\n C) Breakdown of the budget, including the range of pricing:  \n‚ÄúWe will acquire 3 My Pet Hooligan NFTs, from the floor, with a budget of .7-1.2 ETH each totaling up to 2.1 - 3.6 ETH in total.\n\nD)    Vote ‚ÄúYes‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo‚Äù\n\nE) Current DAO funds in ETH, shown here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x16DbCd202be906c36667258799155d48Fb6C9584",

Nice idea to get a proxy access before the hype, I think.\n\nThey have a collection of 500 NFTs on Eth network, and they plan of expanding behind the limits of the middle east.\n\nA lot of Guild holders, me included, have bought GrayBoys NFT and believed in the team since the early days because of the founder of Guild Alpha Pass who kept educating people about the GB project and the NFTworlds since around their mint day.\n\nI suggest acquiring 1 Guild Alpha Pass NFT, from the floor, with a budget of 0.24Eth, up  to 0.26Eth. As it's a rewarding NFT in my opinion, both statically in their Alpha job, and culturally as a strong diverse Arabian community.\n\nNot to mention, if the DAO says yes, the Gray Arab buddies at Guild will warmly welcome all the G.Boys coming through their Proxy gates.\n\nMuch love!",

BAYC asset gives us exclusive access to the BAYC APE staking pool. The initial APY (subject to change on various factors) is about 335.2%. In order to get max rewards which is determined by total staked, and size of the BAYC pool we could yield roughly 33,550 $APE.\n\n10,000 staked APE * 335.2 APY = 33,550 $APE by the end of year 1. This is a HUGE opportunity for the DAO to participate in a high yield pool and grow the DAO funds for long term. \n\nWith the current squeeze on APE demand, and expected Yuga announcements in December, we can confidently expect $APE to rise in price from the current price. However not guaranteed.\n\nInvesting in this now means later, we can target more nfts or other high value nfts.\n\nRemember we can claim rewards at any time, and can withdraw and close the position at any time!

      "content": "Proposal to buy 4 Eth worth of Floor Vaynersports Passes (VSP). The passes must include at least one of the following sport icons (Football, Basketball, Baseball, Soccer, Tennis, Golf, MMA, and Hockey). This means that any VSP that has a Volleyball or Gaming Control are not eligible to be bought by the DAO (these icons are of little value anyway). \n\nVaynersports passes allow you weekly raffle entries to essentially every professional sporting event around the world + white lists. Raffle winners are typically given a $500-$750 USD/Eth stipend for travel and food. \n\nWinners will even have the ability to sell their tickets as NFTs.\n\nThe sports icons on a VSP represent the specific sporting event raffles & giveaways that VSP holders are eligible for. \n\nMore icons = more entries to raffles. This would give gray boys some really nice long term utility and keep members more interactive!! \n\nFloor price: .155 Eth \nVolume: 9005 Eth\nOwners: 5299 \n",

      "content": "This proposal is list our Proof Collective Pass for 37.5 ETH. (Current floor is 38 ETH) If it doesn‚Äôt sell after 7 days then the GB team can relist one time for up to 1 ETH below floor at that time. After the Proof Pass sells, 5 ETH will be put transferred into an Operational Wallet which can be used for Marketing, Advertising, Graphics, etc. The remaining funds will be used on the following collections.\n\nThe proposal is to purchase up to 13.75 ETH of NFT Nerds (Floor Price is 4.3 ETH), up to 4.7 ETH of SuperSea (Floor Price is 1.4 ETH), up to 4.25 ETH of Alpha Sharks NFT (Floor Price is 0.24 ETH), up to 4 ETH of Icy Tools Founders Club (Floor Price is 0.193 ETH), up to 1.3 ETH of ENS Tools Pro (Floor Price is 0.28 ETH).\n\nBased on current numbers this proposal would add 5 ETH to an operational wallet, 3 NFT Nerds Passes, 3 SuperSea Non Fungible Tools, 15 Alpha Sharks NFTs, 14 Icy Tools and 4 ENS Tools Pro. We would have a minimum of 0.75 ETH left over to add to the current DAO balance.\n\nSince we have been in Beta Proxy, we have learned that not every NFT we have purchased will be useable or valuable for proxy. The Proof Collective Pass is one of the NFTs that we realize proxy will only work for one at a time. Also, it appears that it doesn‚Äôt have much for utility or alpha, especially considering the price we paid.\n\nYes, selling Proof now would be a giant ETH and Dollar loss but I believe it is beneficial for two main reasons. One we can sell it and take the tax loss to help offset any gains we might have had or may have yet this year. The other reason is because most NFTs are down drastically across the board, and we can utilize this sale proceeds to help stock the DAO with utility specific NFTs.\n\nCurrently we are working on building out a Proxy Marketplace. This would give Gray Boy Holders the ability to rent NFTs in the marketplace as well as rent out NFTs you hold in your wallet (without it leaving your wallet). So, by executing this proposal, we help to add a variety of utility specific NFTs to the DAO to be used in the Proxy Marketplace at launch. To help jump start our Marketplace while also giving us some operational funds to help better market Gray Boys. \n\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/proof-collective\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/non-fungible-tools-membership\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/alphasharksofficial\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/icy-founders-club\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/ens-tools",

      "content": "Hello fellow gray boys,\n\nI present to you, an opportunity of a lifetime. I believe the DAO should include World Wide Webb3 into its portfolio. I believe the DAO should allocate up to 1.75 ETH to purchase 4 apartments (4 smalls apartment at current valuation) in World wide webb3. The current floor is .4 eth https://opensea.io/collection/worldwidewebbland\n\nWorld wide webb3 is a metaverse project with interoperability. It has integrated over 200 projects into the game currently. The integrations will not stop, thus bringing more communities into the game. This will perpetuate the already growing amount of active users. World wide webb3 has made strategic partnerships with GameStop, Immutable, StarkwareLTD and others to ‚ÄúHyperscale‚Äù the game. \n\nThe game itself is really fun. You can customize your apartment to fit your personality. You will soon be able to bring friends into your apartment and watch YouTube videos, host parties, or surf the web together. You will soon be able to use voice chat with Spacial audio. We can potentially use these apartments as Ad space for Gray Boys. I can talk to the founder to see if he can add a gray boy walk cycle. This would mean we can use our specific Gray Boys in the game! The team never stops innovation.\n\nSDK system will allow regular people to build on worldwide webb3. You will be able to create games, and quests without having any coding experience. Think of people building games on NFT worlds, but the unique thing about this is you‚Äôll need no Knowledge of coding. 4 apartments would be sufficient. 2 for advertising gray boys around the map, and 2 for games and quests. \n\nNFTs are in a bear market and projects are on sale. It is time to spend the eth that‚Äôs saved in the DAO wallet on projects that have longevity and promise of constant innovation. The DAO portfolio has, and must acquire more strong assets that will grow substantially. Webb3 is one of the most promising metaverse projects.",

      "content": "![TWITTER_PROFILE_WIDE.png](ipfs://bafkreid4kv5hbx2tz72gde3xabhky7kic72wt273y7jgtcenlgn6mch7ey)\n    \nI propose purchasing a discounted Rogue West TCG bundle of 15 rare cards for use by the community through the proxy wallet.This deck would allow all community members to freely play with a highly competitive deck. ü§†\n    \nWhat Is Rogue West:\n\nRogue West is a decentralized trading card game created by an established independent gaming company. Their first game was sold on Steam and received critical acclaim https://store.steampowered.com/app/837400/Fated_Kingdom/\n\nThere is a solo & multiplayer alpha version of Rogue West currently available. You can try the TCG for free with a random deck. ü§†\n\nhttps://roguewest.io/play/\n \n![FcrX5HXXEAAR6Ms.jpg](ipfs://bafkreiars6mtgng2teonan3pifwvvfdmnknihkrswcg6lxa2didkanxale)\n    \nThe beta version is planned for the end of the year. The marketing will really start at that time\n\nThe current NFTs are part of the Founder‚Äôs Edition and there is a mass market edition planned for the future. The Founder's Edition is very limited in quantity making it truly valuable to collectors. \n\nGame Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfFgO9oSB-U\nWebsite: https://roguewest.io/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RogueWestNFT/\nOpensea Collection: https://opensea.io/collection/rogue-west-crypto-trading-card-game\n\nWhat We Get üßê:\nThe 15 card bundle, https://opensea.io/fr/bundles/ethereum/for-gray-boys-community-wallet-XY4 , is offered to The Gray Boys Community Wallet for 1 ETH and has a market price of 5.7 ETH. You can check on gem.xyz the price of all the cards by buying individually. üí∞\n\n![rogue west bundle2.png](ipfs://bafkreihpiab5nelyofj2fqmewslrmxpcf6u4hvnz4vaku6uokfgctdinxa)\n\n![rogue west bundle3.png](ipfs://bafkreihnkmiovxrydvhvfer2gja27apakn5pjt5y327oojarzmnuwux4c4)\n    \nWhy buy a Rogue West deck with the community wallet? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nThis will allow every member of the Gray Boys community to play with a powerful deck of Founder's Edition cards through the proxy wallet.\n\nAdvantages: \nThe deck is offered for Gray Boys at a significant discount to the floor price (1 ETH as opposed to 5.7 ETH). \nGray Boys will be whitelisted for all future rare card drops. \nThe initial purchase price of a rare card is 0.02 ETH and they can re-sell for much higher or be used to expand the deck giving players more options. \n\nI am personally a member of the team as CM and advisor. \nIt is mainly for this reason that the project has bought a NFT World recently. \n \n![FcsSWDWWAAMq_mz.png](ipfs://bafkreidcw7r7ywx7lfqbdsimzgraiz7xg4gqaeq4rm4kkgzvl7xnsiatge)\n https://twitter.com/RogueWestNFT/status/1570376807303548928\n\nI think this investment is very good for Gray Boys. The 15 rare cards cost only 0.066 ETH each.\nAnd in the bundle there is the most powerful card in the game (Battle-Hardened Sheriff) \nthere is also the card ‚ÄúShowdown‚Äù which is very strong and has already been resold for 1 ETH. \n\nSo why sell this 15 card deck for only 1 ETH?\nThese cards are from my personal collection. And it would be a great opportunity for Rogue West to be known by more people passionate about NFTs.\nThat's why I made it at such an affordable price. It's a win-win deal for everyone.\nAnd if the vote was accepted by the community, I would use the ETH to buy another NFT World and an 8th Gray Boys \n\nIt would mean a lot to us to have the support of the Gray Boys community with the purchase of this rare card collection\n\nThank you for your consideration. I hope to be able to play against you all on Rogue West very soon!  üëΩü§ùü§†\n\n",

      "content": "Hello fellow gray boys,\n\nI present to you, an opportunity of a lifetime. I believe the DAO should include World Wide Webb3 into its portfolio. I believe the DAO should allocate 4 ETH to purchase 9 apartments (8 smalls and 1 medium apartment at current valuation) in World wide webb3. The current floor is .4 eth (medium apartments .51) https://opensea.io/collection/worldwidewebbland\n\nWorld wide webb3 is a metaverse project with interoperability. It has integrated over 200 projects into the game currently. The integrations will not stop, thus bringing more communities into the game. This will perpetuate the already growing amount of active users. World wide webb3 has made strategic partnerships with GameStop, Immutable, StarkwareLTD and others to ‚ÄúHyperscale‚Äù the game. \n\nThe game itself is really fun. You can customize your apartment to fit your personality. You will soon be able to bring friends into your apartment and watch YouTube videos, host parties, or surf the web together. You will soon be able to use voice chat with Spacial audio. We can potentially use these apartments as Ad space for Gray Boys. I can talk to the founder to see if he can add a gray boy walk cycle. This would mean we can use our specific Gray Boys in the game!! The team never stops innovation.\n\nOpportunity like this does not come around very often. NFTs are in a bear market and projects are on sale. It is time to spend the eth that‚Äôs saved in the DAO wallet on projects that have longevity and promise of constant innovation. The DAO portfolio has, and must acquire more strong assets that will grow substantially, like Worldwide Webb3. Webb3 is one of the most promising metaverse projects. Vote now.",

The 10 random floors will be bought with intentions to sell at a higher price after the game releases which could help pay for the integration of playable Gray Boys characters into their platform. We have been quoted a price of 5 eth for integration plus more for specific traits. Also the 4 plots from sector 1 (which is the hottest sector and is closest to the main Vega City) is where we want to be. This is where we will build our Gray Boy build site which could be a pyramid, mothership or whatever we decide. \n\nThey have already had many partners in the Web3 space‚Ä¶.

He is also the co-founder of White Sands.\"\n\nWhy buy now?\nThe launch of all the features on the game is planned for a few days üëÄ\nWith the launch and all the new features that the team will propose (never seen before in NFT universe), I think this project is undervalued and will have to take in values. Previously, they constantly delivered upon each and every point marked in the roadmap and only added amazing features such as their world to go beyond what was promised.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/HollanderAdam/status/1552862097184378880\n\nAlphas receive 2x more airdrop dominance points with sheep every month. \nBut it's good to also take Beta. This way the community will be able to have fun using Proxy to duel Alpha wolves with our Beta wolves to get their Alpha rank after defeating them. üïπÔ∏è\nIt will make them value.  This project does consolidates many different aspects and is very accessible. I suggest you join their discord or read the whitepaper.\n\nGood vote to everyone üó≥Ô∏è Thanks for reading üëΩ",

Two Cyberkongz genesis could breed and spend 600 $BANANA to start the breeding frenzy and create a Baby Kong. Baby Kongz just like the Genesis kongz have access to the alpha channel on their discord. \nHaving traded babies previously I have seen floors between 6 and 10 Eth. \n\n* Today the DAO has the opportunity to pick a floor baby kong up for 2 Eth at the time of writing this. I propose we set a budget of 2.5 Eth so we have a little room for movement.\n\n * If passed we are getting a blue-chip project, access to their discord all for under 2.5 Eth.\n\nWe do hold a VX kong however that does not give alpha access. \n\n*This could bring interest in from a great community and new holders for GB. \n\nOn top of that kongz have been around for a long time and are often developing. \n\nWith proxy soon to be released I hope this could be another great project we could add and assist with some great exposure and provide fantastic alpha. \n\nThanks",

      "content": "Objective: ‚ÄúWe will acquire 4 Kingship NFTs, from the floor, with a budget of .2-.6Eth each, totaling up to 2.4Eth in total.‚Äù If collection is revealed when proposal is complete, will attempt to get 1 of each of the 4 passes while staying under budget.\n\nWhat is it: KINGSHIP is the first supergroup of apes signed to a major label. They are known for their multi-Ethereum-selling music, their unique blend of boredom, and their island kingdom. Purchasing 1 NFT will allow you access to 1 of the band member‚Äôs tower. Think exclusive music drops, behind the scenes content, concerts, luxury events and more. They also have some ties with Flamingo Real Estate Management and Luxury Suites and hinted on the AMA to IRL utility for those that hold cards.\n\nWhy do we need 4 Passes?: *By collecting four passes we can trade with others to acquire all 4 towers. Collecting all four tower unlocks a very special utility for holders that is to be announced. We don't know what utility this would grant, but would likely mean we'll receive individual drops from all band members, and even have exclusive perks for IRL events such as ultimate VIP experiences. Those that acquire all 4 cards would be the top tier VIP guests for every drop to Kingship in the future.\n\nPartnerships: Several Kingship partners are to be announced but their current partnerships include ApeCoin, Moonpay, Opensea, and Universal Music Group, of course. In the last AMA, the candy (M&Ms) was present and so was Snoop Dogg.\nWhat is 1022 PM? This is Universal Music Group‚Äôs foray into Web 3.

Along the way, we‚Äôre building a passionate community, delivering exclusive member benefits, and having a lot of fun. \n\nhttps://linksdao.io/\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/linksdao\n\nThe course acquisition aspect of the DAO is very lengthy and time consuming. In the meantime they‚Äôve partnered with big name brands in the golf and sports world including TopGolf, Callaway and Draftkings to name a few. Members get access to high level discounts and events. Once the course is acquired, a LinksDAO membership will be required in order to play on their courses. Gray Boys Proxy ownership system is a perfect fit for a LinksDAO membership as all gray boys owners will now have access to the exclusive benefits offered by LinksDAO.\n\n",

Along the way, we‚Äôre building a passionate community, delivering exclusive member benefits, and having a lot of fun.  https://linksdao.io/\n\nThe course acquisition aspect of the DAO is very lengthy and time consuming.  In the meantime they‚Äôve parterned with big name brands in the golf and sports world including TopGolf, Callaway and Draftkings to name a few.  Members get access to high level discounts and events.  Once the course is acquired, a LinksDAO membership will be required in order to play on their courses.  Gray Boys Proxy ownership system is a perfect fit for a LinksDAO membership as all gray boys owners will now have access to the exclusive benefits offered by LinksDAO.",

The DAO has done well to acquire analytical tools, like IcyTools and Supersea, and we should continue to acquire more of the best-in-class tools to ensure 360 degree access to the latest data, features and alpha to bring additional immediate value to GB proxy. These tools will ultimately grow in value when bear season ends and bull season begins, as more people will be yearning for utility over hype.\n\nThis acquisition can also act as a marketable value proposition for both current and prospective holders. One Gray Boy gets you access to some of the best analytics tools and alpha in the market (what would cost you 1 ETH+ as an individual purchase would now be available as part of your membership to Gray Boys). In the future we can continue to acquire similar tools and make NFT Trading & Analytics Tools a core pillar of proxy utility. \n\nBREAKDOWN OF THE BUDGET, INCLUDING THE RANGE OF PRICING. \n\nWe will acquire 1x Coniun Pass NFT from the floor with a budget of .6-.8 ETH.\nWe will also acquire 1x AlphaSharks NFT from the floor with a budget of .45-.7 ETH.‚Ä®Totaling up to 1.5 ETH.",

These tournaments are free to enter and have ETH payouts taken from exchange royalties. As the bulls grow, the poker pot should grow.\n\nOwning 3 Bulls & 1 Intern grants holders access to an exclusive Discord channel featuring a legitimate financial advisor Mon-Fri during stock market open. Every Friday after the stock market closes, Peter Tuchman, better known as the Einstein of Wall St hosts a market breakdown exclusively for bull holders. Peter has been a trader on the NYSE for 30+ years and offers valuable market insights. \n\nThe Wall St Bulls are a Wall St focused NFT collection. They have recently signed a partnership with publicly traded company Helbiz (HLBZ) with more details coming soon. Helbiz CEO Salvatore Palella is a Wall St Bull holder and big fan of the collection.\n\nYou can learn more about the Bulls here by joining the Discord, including alpha about the upcoming options market. In the options market, you'll be able to potentially make non-rare bulls more rare. You may be able to obtain 1/1 Mooner bulls in the options market. Your bull can go to jail for insider trading in the options market. Your bull can DIE in the options market. It's going to be a gamified WSB NFT world.

There is a strong indications that having bored ape yacht club + a kennel will get extra land in Apeland. Making this purchase would be a great fit to go with our BAYC already in the DAO. BAKC didn‚Äôt receive ape coins so this is their chance to get something extra in Apeland. Proxy can be used for the kennel club discord as well.

Make sure you‚Äôre following us on Twitter and you‚Äôre in the discord for future announcements regarding pass colors and icons. \n\n>We‚Äôre fans of game theory, assume there are interesting twists regarding the colors, backgrounds, and icons. For example, passes with 0 icons were not an accident. Rarity matters.\n\n>Having a certain sports icon will be important in the future. The more icons the better. Meaning 4 icons is better than 3, 3 is better than 2, etc. The one instance this doesn‚Äôt hold true is passes with 0 icons. We have some fun for those. \n\n>Double Icons (aka you have 2 baseballs on your pass) will play a role\nSpectaculars matter\n\n>Green is Green in the Vaynerchuk world\n\n>If you are a sports fan, we recommend owning passes featuring sports you enjoy. \n\nWebsites:\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/vaynersports-pass-vsp\nhttps://pass.vaynersports.com/",

      "title": "Acquire White Sands Villa & Parcel Pass for max of 8 ETH",
      "content": "White Sands is no doubt one of the premier NFT Worlds metaverse fixtures. \nI propose we acquire a floor... \n\nWhite Sands Island Villa: https://opensea.io/collection/white-sands-islands (No more than 7.15 ETH, floor currently 5.35)\n\nas well as a floor,\n\nWhite Sands Parcel Pass: https://opensea.io/collection/white-sands-parcel-pass (No more than .85 ETH, floor currently .57)\n\nHere's why...\n\nI believe this to be a great speculative investment based on the team behind White Sands, & also the relationship between NFT worlds and the White Sands founders, with Blockchain Brown holding 250 GBs alone and Adam Hollander always making positive mentions and owning GBs himself. \n\nGray Boys will surely want to stake their claim in the White Sands metaverse to embolden our footprint across the NFT Worlds landscape. With only 250 Villas, Gray Boys will have a place they can call home in White Sands when we need a break from the vastness of space. \n\nWhite Sands has already plugged GBs a bit as they roll out their project, and it is only right we strengthen our partnership with their founders for what could be huge endeavors in the future as our projects take off. Who knows what synergies lie ahead with the powerhouse of minds and developers behind the scenes. First step would be ensuring we snag some of this property at near mint prices so the DAO can benefit from the value increase over time.\n\nHolding a White Sands Island Villa gives us access to all of the White Sands air drops as they roll out their road map, including, but not limited to, vehicles, pets, furniture, & more. \n\nI can't speak to a strong utility for Gray Boys proxy feature at this current moment in time, but I think a lot of us can agree this project is one of the most buttoned down ventures being built so far on NFT worlds. Not to mention, this project is arguably getting the most PR and newsworthy mentions of any NFT worlds projects thus far. ",

This makes our roadmap collaborative to be decided by the project founders and Doodle holders via the Doodlebank. The Doodlebank is our community treasury which boasts over $5m USD and is used to fund these experiences.\n\nBreakdown of the budget: the current floor price is 14eth and I propose we buy a floor for up to 18eth to account for potential floor price rising.\n\nLinks:\nhttps://doodles.app/\nhttps://twitter.com/doodles\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/doodles-official",

      "content": "\nProposal: Trade SIX Gray Boy (floor) NFT Worlds for World #8293 (Rank 8 NFTW with Fountain of Aging 1/1 trait)\n\nSummary: Acquire the rank #8 world (#8293) via a trade. The proposed trade (which is already agreed on by the counterparty) is an exchange of 6 of our NFTW floor worlds for World #8293. \nWhy: Acquiring one of the worlds with a 1/1 trait will allow Gray Boys to develop and build a completely unique world experience around that 1/1 trait once future utility is attached to rare traits (estimated timeframe sometime after Roadmap 2.0 is released)\nThere are only 9 unique worlds in the 10,000 NFTW collection with a 1/1 trait. Roadmap 2.0 is going to emphasize the value of rare worlds and rare traits. Acquiring one now opens up future utility for the Gray Boy community.\n\nReason to acquire the 1/1 world:\n\n1) Higher Visibility on the upcoming game launcher.\nRare worlds with games will also be offered higher listing on the new Launcher (according to Arkdev). \nOwning the #8 world would likely place a GrayBoy developed game world near the top of the launcher , giving a steady stream of valuable eyespace in the future.  More eyespace = more exposure, more players to GrayBoys world\n\n2) Unique game world experience \nRoadmap 2.0 may introduce utility to rare world traits. Unique traits (there are only 9 worlds with such in the 10,000 collection) allow for a unique game experience to be built around that trait something that will give these unique worlds a competitive advantage. \n\n3) Exclusivity \nGrayboys having one of the nine 1/1 worlds is a great for the GB brand. A game world could be developed exclusively for grayboy holders. This offers even more incentive to acquire a grayboy to take advantage of the unique game experience offered by this world once developed.\n\n\nLink to 1/1 world:\n\nhttps://opensea.io/assets/0xbd4455da5929d5639ee098abfaa3241e9ae111af/8293",

Temporary price disruption: FVCK_CRYSTALs are temporarily disrupted because a snapshot was taken MARCH 20 to reward holders with ESSENCE// (floor now 0.78, one free for prior holders, only for 0.20 available). \n\n2.  FVCKRENDER is one of the leading artists in generative NFTs and has sold millions.  He has a 30 person team building LVCIDIA, a ‚Äúvirtual galaxy filled with sculptures expressing the fragility of our existence and beauty of our humanity.‚Äù  \n\n3.  FVCK_CRYSTALs are the key to LVCIDIA.  They are dramatically undervalued compared to ESSENCE// here\n\n4.  FVCK_CRYSTAL prices started at 1.4 eth in November when launched, and for most of 2022 have been between 2-3 eth.  We are near the all time floor, holders are going up, and listings going down.\n\nWhat are the details of the project/team that make this worthwhile (roadmap, upcoming hyped releases/partnerships, etc)?   \n-ESSENCE// is currently being minted (and sold 0.77).  Public sale MARCH 27 at 0.469 will be a catalyst.  Reveal / redemption is APRIL 6.\n-Good possible collab with Gray Boys on everything from proxy wallet to merch.\n\nNear term upside (WL opps, attention from community, upcoming hyped releases/partnerships, etc)\n-FVCKRENDER is a tier 1 artist and NFT https://niftygateway.com/profile/fvckrender/collections\n-Near-term upside is 3 eth within 30 days imo \n-FVCKRENDER individual pieces sell at $150k or higher \n\nLong term upside (blue chip potential, roadmap, dev team and tech, etc)\nIf proposing something to buy and flip, include target price to flip\n-HODL - I believe will move to 7 - 9 eth in the coming 12 months\n\nIs this a strong marketing opportunity? \n-VERY STRONG.  Sartoshi got me to buy a crystal, @greatmando just listed this as one of his key projects.\n\nDoes this benefit DAO members? If so, how?\n-Access to LVCIDIA \n-Access to future FVCKRENDER launches\n\nLinks: \nhttps://opensea.io/collection/fvck-crystal\nhttps://twitter.com/fvckrender\nhttps://twitter.com/lvcidia\nhttps://thenftunicorn.com/todays-nft-drops/fvckrenders-fvck_-avatar-nfts-redemption/\nhttps://time.com/collection-post/6098956/fvckrender/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXe1fVyGUHUlH6zbZtntMkQ\n",

Meaning at the end of this proposal in three days we will acquire whichever DeadFellaz is the cheapest on the floor for no more than our allotted budget of <3ETH>.\n\nDeadFellaz is a project of 10,000 NFTs that currently has 6,200 owners and has traded 24,400 ETH in volume since its inception. The current floor price is 2.35 ETH. \n\nIt is a women led project, which is led by @betty_nft (twitter handle), I think in my opinion her art stands out and is very unique compared to other projects in our space.\n\nThere have been rumors of Adidas and DeadFellaz partnering up soon, not sure what that would entail but interesting nonetheless. Celebrities have showed interest, Odell Beckham JR bought one not to long ago and was sporting it as his PFP. As well as the famous internet comedian Drusky.\n\nAs far as utility goes, it would be cool if all of us GBs could join the \"horde\" as they call it. Not positive on what the utility entails, but could be good for us for cross promotional reasons, and for future potential adidas utility.\n\n( For the record I do not own any DeadFellaz currently)\n\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/deadfellaz\nhttps://www.deadfellaz.io/\nhttps://twitter.com/deadfellaz\n\n\nIf you vote \"For\" you are voting to purchase one DeadFellaz NFT off of the floor for no more than 3ETH\n\nIf you vote \"against\" you are voting not to acquire said NFT.\n\nThanks for taking your time out to consider this proposal.",

They are a lot cheaper than buying a Genesis and still give us the utility of access to their metaverse spaces and discord. The VX collection has only 538 listed and has been hanging strong around 2 eth for a while (has gone as high 4 eth). I think this is a good price entry point, it doesn't tie up all our eth, and it provides us with plenty of utility. Below is a description of the project from their website.\n\nNot content with taking over the 2D NFT space, the continued evolution thrusts CyberKongz into the metaverse in the form of 3D voxel-based avatars built to be used in online metaverse environments such as The Sandbox. The CyberKongz team`s insatiable need to continue to take over the metaverse drove their recent land purchases as well as ambitious plans to create phenomenal environments for Cyberkong holders to socialise and interact. Some of their other exciting utilities are:\n\nThe Sandbox and other metaverses.\nRenaming VX Kong by spending $BANANA.\nDownload the models to create your own artwork or use in merch.\nUnlock #‚ö°verified-lounge, an exclusive channel in CyberKongz Discord server.\n\nPlayers will be able to buy custom CyberKongz VX equipment and wearables to give their avatar additional playability and style during adventures in community-built Metaverse games.\nOn top of that, the launch of the BANANA SHOP will bring added utility and perks for both the Banana Token as well as the 2D CyberKongz.\n\nKongz Island\nA massive, multi-estate concrete jungle is built in The Sandbox, in which we create gaming and social experiences involving all CyberKongz NFTs as well as the Banana Token.\n\nKongz Utility Expansion\nOwning one or more CyberKongz grants you access to CyberKongz Guilds, bridging the gap between Axie Infinity, Guild of Guardians and Emberswod\n\nhttps://www.cyberkongz.com/\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/cyberkongz-vx",

The floor currently is at around 0.5 ETH so we should expect to be able to acquire 5 Heroes.\n\nIn this particular case there is little argument to look at rarity as our heroes will all be staked and it is not practically possible for the DAO to claim and equip artifacts for the heroes to a degree that would make them to appealing to the rental market.\n\nThe current conservative estimates for the staking income put the estimated yield at 0.5 to 2.5 wrld per hour per hero. This will increase as player numbers and artifact sales increase, and if they are awarded the grant of wrld token from NFTWorlds.\n\nVote ‚ÄúYes‚Äù if you are in favour of the proposal or ‚ÄúNo‚Äù if you are Against.",

      "title": "(BUY)(25-30ETH)Acquire 3 \"Cool Cats\"",
      "content": "a. https://www.reddit.com/r/GrayBoys/comments/ru0uur/buy2530ethacquire_3_cool_cats/\n\nb. & c.\nThe Cool Cats project is one of the most popular NFTs that came out in 2021 (top 12 in all-time Opensea sales volume). The community is strong (5000 unique holders, 45k discord members) and known to be very exclusive, even to non-holders. The project is also supported by influential people like Farokh, Beanie, and other OGs like J1mmy. \n\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/cool-cats-nft\n\nIt started out as \"just a PFP\" with art created by Clon (https://twitter.com/cloncast). Through time, however, the project has evolved into a more \"utility-oriented\" one that seeks to reward its holders through various perks and benefits (below). Thus, I believe Cool Cats is a strategic fit to the future capabilities of Gray Boys (proxied ownership, pass down benefits of \"abducted\" NFTs). \n\nHere are some of the reasons why:\n\n- Cool Pets: an Axie (P2E), Neopets, and Pokemon inspired game that will launch this month, Jan 2022. The OG Cool Cats will passively generate $MILK, the native token of the game. In addition, there will be other opportunities to generate income for the OG owners - such as renting out pets to \"scholars.\"\n\nMost recent townhall: https://twitter.com/coolcatsnft/status/1471994602701791239?s=21\n\n- Airdrops: The CC team loves surprising its loyal community with airdrops, usually during seasonal events (Halloween, Christmas, etc.) and tie-ups (Time, Ghxsts, and other emerging artists). \n\nCollabs: https://opensea.io/collection/cool-cats-collabs\nEvents: https://opensea.io/collection/cool-cats-events\n\nd. \nCC is relatively cheap compared to other known blue chips. After reaching an ATH floor of ~15 ETH last Oct, it has since then consolidated into its current price range (6-9 ETH). For those that use technical analysis, the best time to invest is during consolidation/quiet periods, not during big, hyped pumps (which we are seeing in other popular projects right now). \n\nPrice action and other facts: https://dune.xyz/masroor/Cool-Cats\n\nFor the budget, we will need 25-30 ETH to acquire 3 Cool Cats from the floor (8-10 ETH each). If price goes above 10 ETH each, then we should seek to buy 2 Cats instead, with a budget of 30 ETH total. \n\n ",

      "content": "Reddit Thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/GrayBoys/comments/rtqv5t/buy_15_eth_max_acquire_veefriends/\n\nVeeFriends is an ambitious NFT project created by Gary Vaynerchuk \n\n‚ÄúEach NFT will have a specific message and meaning and provide metadata with on chain storage of media. The premise of Gary‚Äôs approach is to create access and serve his community. VeeFriends are all about utility and access, meaning each NFT will have different levels of access and activities through the smart contract attached with each investment thus giving them ‚Äúutility‚Äù through metadata. Over the last 15 years, he has spent time interacting with hundreds of thousands of people -- what VeeFriends will allow will be a structure around these interactions.\nThe token is the key that unlocks you into Gary‚Äôs world.‚Äù\n\nTokens are broken down into 3 types: Admission, Access, and Gift \nAdmission floor = 9.98 ETH\nAccess floor = 20 ETH\nGift floor = 27 ETH\n\nEach token provides access to a multi-day conference (VeeCon) with some of the brightest minds in Entrepreneurship, Marketing, Creativity, Arts, NFTs, Web3, Business, Music, and more.\n\nVeeFriends Website- https://veefriends.com/\nVeeCon Website- https://veecon.co/\nVeeCon Speakers List (still more to come)- https://veecon.co/speakers/\nVeeFriends Discord- garyvee.com/discord\n\nStrategic Reasoning for Acquisition: \n\nAcquiring a VeeFriend will provide: \nAccess to Discord channels\nAccess to a community of hustlers, entrepreneurs, and business contacts \nAdmission to VeeCon for 3 years (Not imagining us all trying to access VeeCon via proxy, but rather, we would have the ticket to VeeCon for 3 years and could choose how to distribute it later) \nVeeFriends series 2 will be dropping and owning a Series 1 would put us at a great advantage when series 2 drops. (Gary has been dropping hints in the VeeFriends Discord...I provided live links in Reddit thread)  \n\nPotential unrevealed utility if we purchase a VeeFriend with a signature or a 5 in the design (I provided live links in Reddit thread)\n\nGary Vee fan, or not, I do believe there is value in VeeFriends as a project. Acquiring one for the DAO would position ourselves well in the space, as well as raise awareness to the project, and give some added utility and access for DAO members. \nShould hold solid resale value as well, with potential pump leading up to VeeCon\n\nPricing: \n\nWe would acquire the best \"Admission\" VeeFriend available \n(based on rarity or having valued attributes (signatures and 5s) that would provide higher value) \nBudget = 15 ETH \nNot to spend more than 15 ETH (not including fees and gas pricing) \n\nWhile there are very good choices around 12 ETH, the 15 ETH max budget is to allow for fluctuation in market price from now till acquisition\n\n\nExecutable upon passing vote \n",

For example, if a Gray Boy sells for 1 eth currently, OpenSea pays Gray Boys a royalty fee of 0.05 Eth for that sale.\n\nFrom these royalties, the proceeds are split 50/50 between the DAO funds and the development fund.\n\nThe DAO fund is what's used by the community to purchase more NFTs to the community wallet.\n\nThe development fund is used by the team to fund internal development.

Please visit the following for more information before you cast your vote:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/889939924655169616/890704543392886834/915321418391105626\nhttps://twitter.com/nftworldsNFT\nhttps://www.nftworlds.com/static/media/discord.cd28ba7c.png\n\nAcquiring 10 NFTWORLDS:\nTo reduce speculation, and to allow for a possibly lower average cost, we propose to spread the purchase of 10 worlds over 10 weeks. This will allow us to: Capitalize on owning more worlds before the 2nd token drop.  Capitalize on any potential sell off of NFTWORLDS immediately after the 2nd token drop.\n    As we have witnessed already, there was a gradual runup in pricing before the 1st token drop, and a short-lived selloff after the first snapshot.\nThe purchases:\n    1.Starting the week of January2, 2022, we the Mothership DAO, will purchase 1 NFTWORLDS nft per 7 day period, with a minimum of 48 hours passing between any 2 purchases.\n    2.Each purchase will not exceed price bracket of Floor + 0.2 eth.\n    3.The purchaser will purchase the rarest NFTWORLD(via results from the approved rarity programs allowed by the developers), available at time of purchase, within the bracket mentioned above.\n    4.The purchaser will provide details of every purchase immediately after it is processed, to allow all Dao members the opportunity to review, of their own accord, the OS activity and pricing during the purchase time , to help determine if any price speculation has occurred , or if the potential that any unfairness has occurred.\n    Thank you for reading.\n\n",

It is our responsibility as Dao members to offer our group a chance at voting an nft from a blue chip organization BAYC has proven their longevity and value. The cost of BAYC nft has continued to rise since their beginning. They have offered their collectors immense opportunity for massive gains, through a buy and hold strategy, and via the serum and MAYC creations, amongst others.  The roadmap for 2022, will continue to adapt and develop, and further gains and advantages for their blue chip clientele will become evident throughout the Nft community. \n\nMost investors have been priced out of owning a BAYC. The off shoot, MAYC's have thus increased in value from 0 eth, to a floor of 11 eth in a very short period of time. The demand for BAYC is absolutely huge, as every investor with the financial means wants to own a piece of this blue chip project. \nLuckily, we, the Mothership DAO have the opportunity, and the means to acquire 1 BAYC.  Once acquired, and marketed correctly, literally millions of eyes will be on us. Investors will have an opportunity to own a piece of BAYC, by buying a Gray Boy, thus increasing demand in our Gray Boys project , and possibly eventually raising the average price of Gray Boys. \nPurchase: Buy the rarest BAYC available at a cost of Floor + 3 ETH +gas, within 48 hours of the approval of this proposal.\n\nHere is the link of a previous BAYC proposal, most votes were yes votes, but did not meet the 1000 vote minimum due to the Christmas season:\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/grayboys.eth/proposal/0xe30c9be6d91f5e626f4c1568b30677690318507011990bd7cef021710ee187f7\n\nHere is the link to BAYC, so you can see for yourself what an amazing organization this is to be a part of:  https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/\n\nHere is an article explaining more about the BAYC project:  https://www.cnet.com/how-to/explaining-the-bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-collection/\n\nThank you for reading.\n",

      "title": "Create Mothership DAO REALTY DIVISION",
      "content": "Purpose: to distinguish, and accentuate our virtual real state holdings within the DAO for organizational, marketing and promotional purposes.\nWe propose to allocate 30% of the current DAO value strictly for virtual real estate purposes, with the potential to, after 5 years time, have a possibility to be spun out to a physical real estate holding division with each Gray Boy having an equal share. \nAt current value, 30% is conservatively estimated at 60 ETH. Many virtual real estate purchases have already been made, totalling approximately 10 ETH, leaving  well over 50 ETH left for additional real estate acquisitions, if this proposal is excepted.\n\nThe purchases:\n1. Immediately purchase 2 of the best available Floor Decentraland Lots, adjacent to each other, with a  maximum cost of 8.0 ETH + gas fees.\n\n2.Immediately purchase 1 Sandbox Lot, adjacent to one of our current holdings. Maximum cost will be 4.0 ETH. \n\n3.Immediately purchase 6 NFTWorlds worlds, bringing our total to 11. This project is undervalued when compared to the valuations of both Sandbox and Decentraland, and presents a unique opportunity for the Dao to capitalize on the current cheap valuation of worlds.  Maximinum cost will be 8.0 ETH +gas fees, with each world having a minimum of 4 Uncommon, 2 Rare,  traits, or greater.  Maximum price per world is 1.7 eth.  The Dao will also benefit from significant $wrld tokens for the 2nd airdrop and yearly distributions.  \n\n(The term 'Immediately' above means within 48 hours of approval of this proposal).\n\nUpon completion of above purchases, the DAO will immediately engage with a social media marketing agency, to initiate a social media marketing campaign , marketing this DAO as 'A REAL ESTATE POWERHOUSE', putting many eyes on us, and bringing in many new Gray Boys owners , people who cannot afford buying such lands on their own, with the purpose of raising the average purchase price of Gray Boys nft's significantly. Total cost for marketing will not exceed 0.3ETH. \nAbove purchases are still miniscule when compared to total DAO value.  Dao will still have greater than approximately 175 ETH available in total(estimate), untouched in the DAO.\nThank you for reading. Lets make Mothership DAO a REAL ESTATE POWERHOUSE together! \n \n",

Here is to propose: our community wallet to claim the $SOS airdrop into out community wallet and hold for 1 year.\n\nReasons for Claim:\n\n1. Its free money as a result of our Opensea investing activities, hence should be taken as our investment return.\n\n2. The idea of free airdrop to the whole existing user community of Opensea, instantly grabs crypto Twitter's attention, gathered a giant community fans for OpenDao in few day. Our NFT World is also community driven, and we can mornitor and learn from projects like OpenDao for effectively building communities and reputations. \n\n3. This could be the next meme coin given its very well distibuted to +150K wallet holders. The $SOS token immediately got listed into many top exchanges. Up-side potential can be significant. We only need to pay gas fee to claim.\n\nSee tokenomics from their website https://twitter.com/the_opendao\nAnd Wallet holders: https://etherscan.io/token/0x3b484b82567a09e2588a13d54d032153f0c0aee0#balances\n\nReasons for not Claim:\n\nThe only reason for not claim might be: smart contract unaudited might got rugged. 1.

Total Maximum Cost: 1.1 Eth + gas costs.  The acquired world must have a minimum of 2 Uncommon traits.\n\nFinding Approved Builder:  \n1.Create a new channel in Discord titled GRAYBOYLAND, strictly limited to Gray Boy owners, and builders strictly for the discussion of proposed GRAYBOYLAND build. \n2. Allow all approved builders, 60 days,  to present proposals using the following already agreed upon, and approved parameters (as per previously passed proposal):\n\n1.\t10,000 condominium units, one unit FREE for each Gray Boy.\n2.\tShopping Mall - with 10,000 storefronts, one unit FREE for each Gray Boy.\n3.Theater and convention centre - the DAO can host/rent these facilities for our benefit, and charge outside parties for use.\n\n(Note: Mothership World Proposal is a previously approved proposal which overlaps current project roadmap, and will not be included at this time. It does not make sense , cost wise, to build a mothership, if the devs will build one anyways, as per the project roadmap, and since we currently have an abundance of land to build on.  If, in the future, we run out of workable land in our world, a Mothership will be built.)\n\nAfter the 60 day 'request for pricing' period is over, a committee of 25 GrayBoy owners( to prevent favoritism),   will be established to determine the top 5 proposals.  They will submit a new proposal here, in snapshot, to allow all Gray Boy owners to vote on their favorite build from the top 5 selected.\n\n******Note: You are voting for the purchase of the floor nft and the REQUEST for pricing procedure ONLY.  You are not voting for paying for the final cost of the build at this time.  \n",

The devs of this project have followed through with the outlined roadmap, on time, and are a hands on team that is about shake up the metaverse space with the development of the project's 10,000 Worlds, token distributions, and P2E aspirations.\n\nThe Purchase: \n At time of purchase, acquire 5 NFTWorlds Nft's with the rarest traits, within a price range of Floor to Floor+0.2 ETH, without exceeding 1.2Eth per World.\nBuying slightly above the floor will allow us to acquire worlds with increased rarity, which will benefit the DAO long term with greater token distributions, a greater amount of rare traits, which will be valuable during the proposed world economy system.  Placing a limit on the purchase price per world will reduce speculation, and allow for possible lower prices during the purchase period.  The purchaser will have up to 10 days after the close of this proposal to make purchases to limit speculation. ",

      "content": "Total Maximum cost 1.8 ETH (approx. 0.8% of current DAO value) plus gas costs.\n\nI  believe in offering our members added utility.  The Last Raptor project was build to provide added utility to its nft holders.  \nEach Raptor will provide the Raptor holders access to many benefits, making the Last Raptor NFT with utility a great asset to hold. Also, you would:\n\n   *** Hold 80 percent profit from each merchandise sale.\n   *** Have permission to use their upcoming and developing NFT Tool       \"NFTUL\" for free and particularly to access the paid features.\n\nThe NFTUL Non-Fungible Tool is a Portfolio Optimizer analysis software based on AI (Artificial Intelligence) and Machine Learning Technology. Through NFTUL, you will be granted access to valuable features that you could use to assess your NFT Projects. Whether evaluating, analyzing, and putting a value on your NFT sales and buys using NFTUL, you'll make the most out of an investment.\n\n***Each Raptor will give you  access to this developing NFTUL that helps you optimize your NFT investments.\n\n***Each  Raptor, can receive a  free future mint. (please visit roadmap at thelastraptor.com)\n\n***The Last Raptor project is also still being developed and at its early stages, There could be more benefits. not yet announced.\n\nSo, why 10 Raptors?:\n1. Currently , they are cheap, and the author believes, possibly very undervalued.  Current floor is 0.125 ETH.   10 Raptors could cost a minimum of 1.3-1.8 Eth.  This represents 0.6% to 0.8% of our DAO value, far less than 1% of our current DAO value. \n Having 10 Raptors means we will have 10 NFTUL accounts to share amongst approximately 2400 members, roughly 1 for every 240 members. Members should be able to book a time to use their assigned NFTUL account. (this is a possible , but not guaranteed plan for us GrayBoys)\n2. Multiply possible future gains as the project increases its utility to holders, gains popularity, and possible floor price increases.\n3. 10 revenue streams from merchandise sales\n\nThe PURCHASE: Within 7 days of the approval of this proposal, the purchaser will scan OpenSeas and purchase 10 of the rarest 'TheLastRaptor' Nft's available, without exceeding a total cost of 1.8 ETH plus gas fees.\n\nThe author of this proposal currently does NOT own any 'TheLastRaptor' NFT's.  The author does not plan to purchase any 'TheLastRaptor' Nft.  The author is not affiliated with this project in any way or form.\n\nNOTE- Although this project has great potential, future monetary gains from the purchase and sale of 'TheLastRaptor' NFT's is not guaranteed.\n",

      "title": "Acquire a BAYC NFT",
      "content": "Note: The proxied ownership benefits for BAYC, if any, are inconclusive at this time. Please do not base your vote on the expectation of any proxied ownership benefits.\n\nhello, as we all know we have great perks as a gb holder with shared access being one of them. Id like to propose we buy the rarest BAYC within the range of the minimum floor price at the time of purchase +5.0ETH.\n\nnow hear me out, there's so much attention on BAYC with big names grabbing them EVEN SNOOP DOGG! we could grab some of that attention and more. ALPHA ACCESS, BLUE CHIP, IP, TOKENS etc.. there's big plans coming in 2022 and I believe timing is key and now might just be the best time to get in before its too late.\n\nHolding a BAYC would also let us implement the ape into our Gray Boy worlds and whatever else we can come up with in the future.\n\nNow don't get me wrong jumping into BAYC is a high risk and we have to decide carefully whether this will hurt us or benefit us more. Whether we demo the proxy concept with a MAYC first or jump straight to BAYC while we can is up to you guys.\n\n IMPORTANT INFO\nTop things we can take away from getting a BAYC is 1. The statement of such a big acquirement. 2. The implementation with Gray Boys and or Metaverse worlds. and finally 3. Having THE BEST blue chip in our mothership vault.\n\nBAYC has \"premium\" access in there discord, metalink, private areas etc.. but overall MAYC alpha may be more ideal for its price point. As there isn't info BAYC gets that MAYC doesn't.\n\nSome would say to not waste our funds, but this is an investment. not a purchase. We can make it back (for example increasing gray boy value and sales) and or sell for liquidity if it comes to it. Or on the other hand we could make profit allowing us to spend more on other utilities, NFT's and ideas that come.\n\n CONCLUSION\nIts good to stay diversified and have a strong mix, while still focusing on what's important to us (land, gray boys, token, and what we have in the roadmap ahead. )",

      "title": "Develop Gray Boy Casino on 1 NFT World",
      "content": "Proposal to build or allocate DAO funds to have an ETH based casino built on a portion of one of the newly acquired NFT Worlds. \n\nThe casino can host automated casino games such as slots, Keno, 50/50 Raffle, and perhaps later dealer games such as roulette, poker tournaments, blackjack etc. It may even be possible to incorporate horse races to bet on and other larger scale betting events that would be seen in the real world.\n\nVisitors of our world and the casino would be able to purchase chips with ETH (if we deem another crypto better for betting interaction during project scope after approval, we would switch) to use in the casino for a chance to win chips and cash out in ETH.\n\nThis could also allow for other means of profit such as gift shops, bars, arcades, or shows. \n\nAdditionally, We could allocate DAO funds to advertise when playability becomes more common stable.\n\nCOST: We believe it would be smart to determine amounts to allocate to different aspects of this project once the concept was first approved. That way we can gauge overall viability of the idea, and then really hone in on specific details to maximize the opportunity more effectively.  \nFor example: Budget allocated for design and build, advertising, house bankroll, etc.\n*This would be done through additional DAO voted upon proposals to keep the project moving forward how the community sees fit.\n\nBarring any legal barrier this could be a great way to build the overall wealth of The Mothership.

I am proposing that the Gray Boys DAO purchase 3 Pudgy Penguins floor pieces up to 0.8 ETH each for a  maximum investment of 2.4 ETH total. I believe a project that has achieved such high volume on Opensea is arguable a ‚Äúblue chip‚Äù NFT and that hype will inevitably come back to this project sooner or later.",

Instead of being traditionally minted, Mineable Punks are mined with an increasing difficulty scale based off the total number minted. Their website/FAQ can be viewed here: https://www.mpunks.org/faq\n\nThe mpunks team is also creating an ecosystem of mineable crypto projects which revolve around ownership of mpunks, the most recent being their Mineable Words project which grants free minting to any mpunks owners - https://www.mwords.org/\n\nThis project has a lot of potential being the first and only mineable NFT project in existence, and as the ecosystem expands it is very likely the price could increase dramatically. Proxy ownership would also allow Gray Boys holders easy access to future projects added to their mineable ecosystem. I propose the Gray Boys DAO sweeps the floor of this project to establish a collection that could be held for future incentives and/or as a long-term investment that could seriously increase our funds down the road. There currently have only been 1000 mined, and with a floor price of 0.05 we could establish a decent ownership percentage of a project with huge future potential ",

      "title": "When, How Many, and Which Ones of the NFT World should we purchase? ",
      "content": "1.  When?  We need to complete the purchasing of NFT World before the airdrop snapshot\n\nSeems the hottest proposal topic is to purchase NFT Worlds and make some developments. However, there is no time line proposed for the purchase in previous proposals. And I think its very important that we make the move asap before the $WORLD 1st round of airdrop snapshot taking place on 23rd December 2021. \n\n2. How many NFT Worlds to buy? \nWe have 210 ETH in our treasury, as the NFT worlds‚Äô natives, we Grey Boys to kick start our DAO by 10% ~ 20% of treasury allocation (21 ~ 42 ETH) to our own ecosystem NFTs is a reasonable decision. \n\n --NFT Worlds may be one of the best performing NFT assets in the near future with high returns because we all know NFT World is currently significantly undervalued with so much good progress news coming up, upside potential is huge. \n---Plus there is a $WORLD airdrop timeline coming soon on 23rd December 2021. And $WORLD token plays critical role to keep our NFTW +& GB dual-ecosystem dynamic and sustainable growth. It‚Äôs our native currency!  \n ---In the recent RaritySniper ranking, https://raritysniper.com/nft-worlds, 10% ~ 20% of ETH spending might be able to get some decent amount of NFT Worlds and more or less of 200K ~ 400K air dropped $WORLD tokens into our treasury.\n\nWe could use the $WORLD reserve in our treasury for a lot of things apart from value proposition, such as marketing, promotions, events, networking etc, (when our treasury grow bigger we can even buy low sell high to stabilising $WORLD token price, which helps strengthen our ecosystem). \n\n3. Which ones to purchase?\nWhile we can sweep some floors, rarity should definitely be considered when setting up our portfolio. By adding rare Worlds, we are also supporting our NFT Worlds‚Äô rarity structures. \n\n\nBelow are the detailed options of allocation and rarity ranges.\n 1) 5% 10.5 ETH : 1X top 200 rank (floor-price), 1x top 500 rank (floor-price), the remaining funds to purchase as much as the floor-priced worlds. Before the air-drop snapshot.\n\n2) 10% 21 ETH: 2x top 200 rank (floor-price), 2x top 500 rank (floor-price), the remaining funds to purchase as much as the floor-priced worlds, before the air-drop snapshot\n\n3) 20% 42 ETH: 1 top 50 ranked, 2x top100 ranked (floor-price), 2x top 200 ranked (floor-price), 2x top 500 rank (floor-price), the remaining funds to purchase as much as the floor-priced worlds. Before the air-drop snapshot\n\n4) 20% 42 ETH: 21 ETH to purchase ASAP, allocation same as Option2 before the air-drop snapshot. Remaining 21 ETH designated for future vote of purchase in case price drop after air-drop, we may get some bargain, though without $WORLD token drop.\n\n5) 30% 63 ETH: 21 ETH to purchase ASAP, allocation same as Option2 before the air-drop snapshot. Remaining 42 ETH designated for future vote of purchase in case price drop after air-drop, we may get some bargain without $WORLD token drop.\n\n",

      "content": "Imagine this: A giant alien mothership, hovering over a city skyline. \"LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT THING!\"\n\nI propose we use our first NFT-World to start the design and construction of our own giant mothership! (We can call it the Mothership World)\n\nThis will help to build narrative, hype and community spirit in and outside the Gray Boys DAO \n\nI think narrative is key to building a great community! \n \nSome ideas (not all mine, some picked up in discord):\n‚Ä¢\tOne part of the ship could house a giant portal hall, with portals to a vast number of NFT-worlds that we collaborate with. We could incentives world owner to plug into our portal system, with $WRLD. And GBs could get exclusive access to some areas. This would enhance the narrative of the Gray Boys as being the rulers of the metaverse as we have access to \"everything\". We want the rest of the world to be like \"those GBs really are everywhere!\"\n‚Ä¢\tWe should be careful and deliberate with the design of the mothership. Lets get a competition going to create the most cool looking design and \"look n feel\" for spaceship interior and exterior. This design could also be used on other NFT worlds so that people always will recognise a GB space ship or interior. A common design theme would also facilitate the community construction of the Mothership. Although the design and overall architecture might need plenty of governance. Everyone could help out with detailed construction. If this mothership is going to be as huge as I hope it will be, we will need all hands on deck! üòÑ\n‚Ä¢\tEach GB should have their own quarters on the mothership to design themselves\n‚Ä¢\tWe could use one or multiple verified builders to help us out\n\nNotes:\n‚Ä¢\tI'm not sure if the devs already have plans for the mothership? In that case these ideas could potentially be merged with that\n‚Ä¢\tIf  this conflicts with the official roadmap that the devs have in place. Contact me and I‚Äôll remove it\n‚Ä¢\tSome of the cool suggestions in the \"Resort\" proposal could of course be implemented here \n\nLet't build something awesome together! \n\n",
