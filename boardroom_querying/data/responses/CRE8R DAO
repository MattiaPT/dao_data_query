      "content": "As you know it, we have various clients that are coming from Polygon grants.\nIn the last months, 14 Polygon projects have been completed, and 15 are being processed (total value: about $170k).\n\nFugu initiated the contact and closed the deal with Polygon grants.\nHe spent lot of time and energy in it, but was not compensated for the work he produced.\nThat includes:\n- the business deal, \n- the Polygon management (he does monthly calls + emergency calls + chatting in the telegram group + all the admin stuff for us to get paid, including being KYCed with them) \n- the new clients welcoming (contacting + introducing CRE8R to the new client, which was not always simple)\n\nAs a reminder, Sales used to be paid 10% of the total budget (minus DAO fees) in normal bundles.\nFugu did not introduce \"sales fees\" in this Polygon budget because it would have reduced too much the available budget to actually produce content.\nBut doing the same maths would lead to a $10,8k bonus:\n(170k revenu - 17k DAO fee)*10% = 15,3k\nThis is just for the sales.\nIt does not include all the weekly work done by Fugu.\n\nI think it would be fair to compensate Fugu for all the work previously done.\nWhen I asked him if he was compensated for that work (and realised he was not) he told me he would not ask the normal amount but would appreciate a 2-3k reward for all the past work + sales.\n\nAs this proposal applies to former work, the compensation amount would be taken from the DAO treasury.\nThe DAO has more than the necessary funds so it would not be a problem.\n\nI invite you to vote for the compensation you think fair, keeping in mind how strategic this deal was for the DAO in a bear market.\n$0: refused\n$1k: lower than asked\n$2k: low level asked\n$3k: high level asked\n$4k: more than asked\n\nWe will consider the average of the votes as the compensation that will be sent to Fugu (a%*0 + b%*1 + c%*2 + d%*3 + e%*4)/(a+b+c+d+e)\n\nNote: The Project Manager will work separetely on an organization for the future Polygon projects to see how the work of Fugu can be compensated in a sustainable way, without needing any future vote for additional compensation.",

      "title": "CRE8R YOLO BuyBacks",
      "content": "Recently CRE8R DAO has voted for the 20% of the DAO’s take on revenue to be used to buy back CRE8R from the market. I personally think this is not enough to be truly meaningful. So I proposed an idea for discussion here. \n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/860395547567587328/1029916544442056734/1039939990592962580\n\nIt’s really quite simple TBH. Take ALL the income from a client and use it ALL to buy back CRE8R (laddered in--not a single green candle) and then pay all content creators in CRE8R. Campaign budgets will no longer be considered in USD for payment, rather in a portion of the bought tokens that that USD were able to buy will be divided between the content creators. \n\nHere is an image \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigloun32kvbcfmjmirapjm3nsfmwoh5pivgpmauj37s6incyi7cfe)\n    \n\nPeople that don’t want anything to do with CRE8R token, can sell right back into the pool. However, this model will grant some creators the opportunity to hodl a token, knowing that there will be steady buying pressure for that token. \n\nThere should be a few adjustments. \n\nFirst off all because there is a small amount of loss in USD value, from trading fees, and slippage. We can vote to reduce the DAO’s take from 20% to several lower amounts. You will see them below expressed as a “DAO 15%” which means the DAO now takes only 15% of the total bought tokens. These tokens can be used for internal work, grants, emissions on the pool or such. And this number can be easily changed in the future via another governance proposal.\n\nI strongly believe that there needs to be NO MORE inflation of the token for this to work well. So voting FOR this in any way also is voting FOR locking the remaining tokens in the treasury in a time lock contract. I suggest we try 6 months for now. For simplicity sake, variants on this time lock will not be voted on here. Rather a follow up vote will take place to consider how long this time lock should be for.\n\nTo judge if this YOLO buy back passes, we will compare ALL the FOR votes, versus the NO to see if we will do the buyback.. Then, if the FORs are in majority, we will compare the FOR votes to see how much the DAO will keep.\n\nI strongly believe, and have since we birthed the CRE8R token, that we need to align the project with the governance token of the DAO. The token, as it currently is, has very little utility, and I think this is the best, and simplest way to achieve these goals.",

      "content": "\nSupplementary Video with more details and explanation of timeline: https://youtu.be/bZ4NCKmqdjM\n\nThe request below represent what it will take to make AmpliFi a major source of new clients, creators, network, and revenue for CRE8R DAO.\n\nPlease note:\n\nTotal budget request:\n\nMax 75k over 3 months for dev + 50k For 2 months of CRE8R standard package + 50k AmpliFi campaign Budget across 2x campaigns to promote AmpliFi it'self + supplementing any client campaign budget if needed.\n\nTotal: 175k USD worth of $CRE8R.\n\nthat the proposed dev budget is a MAX budget for up to 3 months of dev work and related work to make sure AmpliFi does what it needs to do and is functional and usable for real campaigns in a timely manner.\n-The CRE8R DAO campaigns budget is available to all our DAO members to bring to life at least two month long CRE8R DAO campaign to help AmpliFi reach our goals (more clients, bigger campaign budgets, extra revenue streams for CRE8Rs etc etc)\n\n-The AmpliFi campaign budgets are designed to demonstrate what a modest incentive campaign can do to kickstart a new project (in this case that project is AmpliFi). Creators will of course also be able to share in this budget ON TOP of what they earn for creating content for AmpliFi campaigns both for CRE8R DAO AND for AmpliFi Client Campaigns.\n\nRequesting: Max 25k USD worth of $CRE8R per month for 3-6 months of dev budget.\nMax total For First 3 months: $75k USD in $CRE8R over 3 months.\n\nThis will be used to pay devs & any other needed services to build out:\n\n-System for adding CRE8R DAO content to AmpliFi using CRE8R CMS!!\n-A campaign using AmpliFi to market Amplifi & attract AmpliFi users.\n-System for tracking and displaying data about onchain & offchain KPIs for AmpliFi campaigns (see https://boosted-bribes.cre8r.vip/ as an example of us already doing this is some basic form).\n-System for Handling AmpliFi payouts (this is also applicable to bribe payouts).\n-Setup for Hundred finance AmpliFi campaign & any other campaigns that\nrequire setup over the next 3 months.\n\nRequesting: 50k USD worth of $CRE8R for CRE8R DAO AmpliFi campaign\n\nThis will be used to pay creators for 2x our standard $25k package to create content and marketing materials around AmpliFi.\n\nb1407012649a262100fb6a1686039dbe8824e364.jpeg\n\nRequesting 50kUSD worth of $CRE8R as AmpliFi budget Across two AmpliFi Campaigns:\nCampaign 1: (Targeting DAO's/Protocols as potential AmpliFi Clients).\n\n-to payout to AmpliFi users for the AmpliFi Campaign to promote AmpliFi to DAO's / Protocols.\n\n-The KPI for this campaign will be offchain. We will be giving AmpliFi users unique links to a landing page about AmpliFi where potential clients can book a call.\n\nROI: If we get 2 clients from this it pays for itself. If we get 4 clients its 100% ROI.\n\nPayout Date: Referrers are paid only IF and WHEN protocols sign up via their referral links (or they can prove that the client came from their bizdev work.\n\nExact Budget TBD\n\nCampaign 2:\n\nTargeting publications, influencers, content creators, to become referrers for AmpliFi campaigns.\n\nThe KPI for this campaign will be measured by AmpliFi referrers who connect their twitter account / wallet address & send out referral links on AmpliFi campaigns for CRE8R DAO clients. So the KPIs become a function of the client campaign KPIs.\n\nPayout Date / Criteria:\n\nPayout would be prorata after the first 5 AmpliFi client AmpliFi campaigns are completed.\n\nExact Budget TBD (probably 80% of 50k USD total AmpliFi Campaign budget).\n\nNote some of this total budget of 50k could also be used to supplement clients AmpliFi budget. ie Aave offers 100k USD in $AAVE so we supplement with 10k USD in CRE8R for example.\n\nLinks:\nBoosted Bribes: https://boosted-bribes.cre8r.vip/\nAmpliFi: https://amplifi.cre8r.vip/\n\nDiscourse Discussion: https://discourse.cre8r.vip/t/cre8r-amplifi-vision-budget-request/110\n\nDiscord discussion: https://discord.com/channels/860395547567587328/968683985062494228",

Everything else however, does not have a proper system. Making a proper and fair system is the purpose of this snapshot.\n\nWhile it has been tried, Coordinape simply doesn't work for this, especially because there are not enough peers who know about the full-scope of the work being done to fairly reward it by giving points.\n\nAlthough 3 DAO members were mentioned above, their positions are by no means permanent. If they stop doing their duties, payment will be cut or stopped. If others step up and begin to take on a similar level of responsibility, they will be added. \n\nSIX MONTHS from the end of this snapshot, the activities of the DAO members concerned will be reviewed and the salary amount will go up for vote again by the F100 (can be increased/reduced in the vote)\n\nBelow is a partial list of the current responsibilities carried out by each of the 3 DAO members mentioned above:\n\nDunks\n►Building https://amplifi.cre8r.vip/, running sales, dev, etc for that. \n►Bribes\n►Partnerships\n►Integrations\n►Managing website & Twitter (and he does A LOT of shitposting 😂)\n►F100 NFTs\n+ more\n\nCeazor\n► Disperse all payouts\n► Setup and Manage F100 Streams\n► Manage Treasury Farms\n► Rake back / buyback CRE8R from bribes\n► Monitor the Beets Farm\n► Work with dunks to manage the bribes\n► Outreach with protocols to setup partnerships for CRE8R token\n► Generally promote CRE8RDAO\n► Select high quality creators to onboard\n+ more\n\nFugu:\n► Daily Fish 🐡\n► Weekly Meeting host\n► keeping track of dao financials\n► making sure all payments go out on time and DAO sticks to schedule\n► Managing Twitter North America shift\n► onboarding new CRE8Rs, including 1 on 1 phone calls\n► playing \"bad cop\" (aka. offboarding 🤣 )\n► dealing with grievances \n► dao tweaks and proposals\n► Damage control (make up for financial losses in the past)\n► Going to conferences and representing CRE8R 🙂\n+ more\n\nFor this proposal, several options for monthly payment are given. Choose the one that you believe is most appropriate considering the above. The minimum amount on the snapshot is the absolute minimum we are prepared to do accept for the above tasks.\n\nNOTE:  Each F100 member has one vote.  Snapshot is currently set to give all F100 holder equal voting power. This does not take into account CRE8R token held anywhere.\n\nAlso this I going to be paid out in CRE8R",

      "title": "Increase Treasury Allotment From Budget - 15% ---> 20% (attempt #2)",
      "content": "I don't believe it's written down anywhere as \"law\", but we've had a convention for a long time to typically allocate 15% of what a client pays us for a project budget to the treasury, and the rest goes out to pm, cre8rs, sale etc.\n\nex. client pays 20k --> 3k stays in treasury.\n\nThis is what we have now.\n\nI propose to raise the treasury allocation to 20% for the following reasons:\n\n1. More money for the DAO, which is a good thing because it allows us to grow, fund different initiatives, build a solid treasury, and do measures to support the price of $CRE8R.\n\nI think we can all agree that we're in some type of bear market-ish period and in this environment the most important thing is to survive. Those who don't just merely survive, but thrive (as we are, but will do even more after this snapshot) will be those best positioned when the next bull is ready.\n\n2. Even after paying cre8rs more than their expectations often, we still end up with a decent amount of extra budget. What to do with that extra budget? Often we divide the majority and split it among all the cre8rs. This is fine, but at some point it becomes ridiculous ex. weird situations like where the bonuses end up being more than the initial payment people were set to get (or at least a significant % increase). This is especially true for people who did only 1 item for the client. Not only is it kind of silly to 2x (or more) payments arbitrarily, but it makes other cre8rs unhappy to see people who did very little work suddently getting double what they got. $500-600 for a single thumbnail etc.\n\nSo, what does this mean for you as a cre8r?\n\nSince we've recently increased out budgets to 25k, likely no noticeable change at all. You just end up being part of a DAO with more formalized processes, and a solid treasury behind it.\n\nGM. LFG. WAGMI",

      "title": "Increase Treasury Allotment From Budget - 15% ---> 20%",
      "content": "I don't believe it's written down anywhere as \"law\", but we've had a convention for a long time to typically allocate 15% of what a client pays us for a project budget to the treasury, and the rest goes out to pm, cre8rs, sale etc.\n\nex. client pays 20k --> 3k stays in treasury.\n\nThis is what we have now. \n\nI propose to raise the treasury allocation to 20% for the following reasons:\n\n1. More money for the DAO, which is a good thing because it allows us to grow, fund different initiatives, build a solid treasury, and do measures to support the price of $CRE8R.\n\nI think we can all agree that we're in some type of bear market and in this environment the most important thing is to survive. Those who don't just merely survive, but thrive (as we are, but will do even more after this snapshot) will be those best positioned when the next bull is ready.\n\n2. Even after paying cre8rs more than their expectations often, we still end up with a decent amount of extra budget. What to do with that extra budget? Often we divide the majority and split it among all the cre8rs. This is fine, but at some point it becomes ridiculous ex. weird situations like where the bonuses end up being more than the initial payment people were set to get (or at least a significant % increase). This is especially true for people who did only 1 item for the client. Not only is it kind of silly to 2x (or more) payments arbitrarily, but it makes other cre8rs unhappy to see people who did very little work suddently getting double what they got. $500-600 for a single thumbnail etc.\n\nSo, what does this mean for you as a cre8r?\nSince we've recently increased out budgets to 25k, likely no noticeable change at all. You just end up being part of a DAO with more formalized processes, and a solid treasury behind it.\n\nGM. LFG. WAGMI",

Currently there are about 2 months left as the current emission rate.\n\nAdding to POL will force us to sell half these tokens and add them to the CRE8R-FTM LP on Spirit swap, but will allow us to farm more Spirit there.\n\nAllocate to internalWork will create the budget size for the coordinape internal work circle. \n\nClient 1.... will allocate to that specific client's current campaign and have the likelihood that more content will be created. Everyone will get a share of budget tokens (USDC) and CRE8R bonus on top of each piece. \n\nThe following might not be the best way to vote for this proposal, but i wanted to illustrate what these will be like. We need to decide how much our budget should be for this. If you wish to vote against this idea. Please put 100% of your votes in 0 CRE8R \n\nLast month we emited roughly 150K worth of CRE8r  via the Farms, internal work, BRICK dev work, and special grants (Clipto, Witnet)\n\n",

This is good for CRE8R DAO and our token holders!\n\nWe have an opportunity to use CRE8R tokens to \"bribe\" inSPIRIT voters to increase/continue their votes weekly on the SpiritSwap gauges.\n\nThere are two ways to do this.\n\n1, Create an airdrop offer open to all inSPIRIT voters where we airdrop x CRE8R tokens prorata to CRE8R/inSPIRIT gauge voters. The outcome of this will initially be unknown. ie only after the fact will we be able to acertain/predict how much extra APR will we get from week to week ( gauge votes happen weekly).\n\n2, Make deals with individual inSPIRIT whales with a fixed % of earnings that flowing back to the treasury flowing back to inSPIRIT whales as a \"retrospective bribe\". This is 100% predictable effectively giving us a fixed 50% discount on inSPIRIT OTC!\n\nie CRE8R treasury is able to harvest x amount of SPIRIT verifiably because of x vote from x inSPIRIT whale therefore treasury pays out 50% of the USD value of SPIRIT returns to x_whale in the form of CRE8R.\n\nTreasury farms 30kUSD worth of SPIRIT & pays 15kUSD worth of CRE8R as a \"retrospective bribe\". x_Whale agrees to LP 100% of CRE8R/FTM and LOCK the LPs for x years (impossible to sell till unlock time).\n\nThis is both a hypothetical example for future whales & a real offer that is on the table.\n\nShould we...",

Ceazor has confirmed that adding unlimited types of tokens to this farm is possible. \n\nTo start, we can transfer all of our Protocol Owned Liquidity into the Spiritswap farm to farm the SPIRIT tokens. Once a month, or week, we harvest the rewards. 1st we lock an amount needed to maintain our inSPIRIT voting power (or we increase/decrease it sometimes)\n\nThe rest we add as rewards to the BLP Farm. \n\n* As a CRE8R holder, in this system, it is likely best to put your tokens in the BLP. \n\n* It will also benefit the DAO in the long term if you too lock SPIRIT for inSPIRIT and vote up the gauge too.\n\n* Ceazor, will continue to use his fBEET to vote for the CRE8R pool, and if you like, you should consider staking (not locking) BEETs to vote this pool up too.\n\nAs this system develops, we can use other funds that are in our wallet to farm other rewards to add to this farm. Perhaps, taking a portion of our payment in gov tokens to immediately put here. ",

Decline to take this project as a client\n2. 25K USDC (or stable)\n3. Some percentage of USDC/Gov token\n4. All gov tokens (in USD value) \n\nThis process will allow us to spend less time negotiating with new clients, as well as add some buying pressure for our CRE8R token. Worst case scenario, we net gain the trading fees, if all clients buy and sell tokens after the proposal is posted. However, it's more likely that clients will either hold these tokens, LP farm them, or even neglect to sell them.\n\nThis may allow us to start to transition to payments in CRE8R to creators, and thus allow us to take in client gov tokens to align us with them.\n",

      "content": "On my trip, I thought a lot about the CRE8R token and the \"utility\". \n\nAfter I returned, I discussed some ideas with Bee. We came up with a decent, low effort idea. \n\nThat is to use 5% (of the 15% we take) client payments to buy back CRE8R and add them to the rewards for the CRE8R-FTM Beets pool. This pool is a 80/20 pool, and can usually take single sided injections of CRE8R quite comfortably. \n\nThe consequences are that:\n1. we lose 5% of our yield farming power\n2. we provide more exit liquidity\n\nThe pros are:\n1 we add buying pressure, but not a crazy amount\n2. we encourage people to build LPs and add depth to this.\n\nChoice:\n1.  I don't know.\n2. No, let's keep it all Yield Farming.\n3. Yes. Start buying CRE8R with the 5% of new client payment. \n4. Yes, calculate the 5% of all our past payments and make a big payment.

Everything he has done so far is amazing, has made the clients very happy, and is included in the portfolio of work we show to prospective clients. This helps with our sales as it demonstrates the quality of what we can provide and brings in more money and credibility to the DAO.\n\nHe has not earned 5k yet as per the usual F100 requirements, but his work has provided at least that amount of value to the DAO, and its actually not fair to have the amount in USD because the God Mode vid is considered internal work and is paid out in $CRE8R.",

Handing out the CRE8R roles to people who may not be suitable for our DAO work to begin with\n2. Granting access to those that are only here to lurk + receive alpha\n3.

The reason for this is because the longer you're in the DAO, the more you know who the other cre8rs are, what they do, they value of the GIVEs, the value of the work itself, etc.\n\nIn our first internal Coordinape I saw the downsides of everyone being given 100 by default first hand - many of the people were new to the DAO and literally had no idea who they were and what they did. On the contrary, those who have been around and are active, had a way better idea of how to allocate appropriately.\n\nPerhaps in the future we can have a more complex calculation based on some sort of metrics like discord activity or total GIVEs received but here are the options for a potential first step:",

And which working group should this be organised under? \n\nPerson 2: \"Oh that should go under workflow and processes but we have not passed the snapshot for that yet.

He has done that will zero certainty about getting paid (because there is no budget for that stuff defined) this proposal fixes that. \n\n-Workflow / Processes-\n\nGo checkout the workflow processes channel to see all the stuff we are already working on.

So I would like to propose some. \n*(This proposal is not agreeing to use bancor as our LP,  just to get the option to do so)*\n\n\n**SPECIFICATION**\n\nThe $CRE8R token has a max supply of 88,888,888\n\nThe proposal is to allocate 8,888,888 tokens (10% of the MSup) for immediate and later distributions.\n\n* 25% of the 8,888,888 to the Multisig.\n\nThey have been here since the start.\nThey have done many things to take us where we are today.\n{insert your validations, or conflict below}\nIf this is to pass, that would be 2,222,222 tokens or 370,370 (rounded) each\n\n* 70% of the 8,888,888 to the F100 NFT holders\n\nThey have earned their place in the DAO\nThey will continue to partake in further projects\nWe won’t need to add CRE8R tokens to individual Circles\n{insert your validations, or conflict below}\nIf this is to pass, that would be 6,222,222 tokens or 62,222 (rounded) each - Many of these will remain in the treasury until all F100 NFT have been given and earners that become eligible after the value is assigned via an LP will be streamed via sablier\n\n* 5% to the people that have been active in the discord channel proportional to their activity. Dunks can explain this better than me. \n\nThese people are also the dao, and they deserve compensation. We COULD consider this also a way to recruit more to the discord, but I worry about this.\nIf this is to pass, that would be 444,444 tokens or assuming 620 members 717 (rounded) each\n*Dunks has a tool to grade people in the discord based on their contribution so although it the total is divided by the members, they will not all receive equal shares.*\n\nFor the discussion: \n\nhttps://discourse.cre8r.vip/t/cre8r-distribution-proposal/36",

There are two of us working on the content but for simplicity, we’re using only one account to vote. That’s my account. As such bowtiednerd will need to go through this path to get voted in instead of the usual criteria way, because he won’t ever have fulfilled the criteria based on his account alone. I think that’s not fair for him.\n\nReasons:\n\nWe have a total of 7 epochs, getting over 6k USDC since we joined the DAO, so this is more than enough for the criteria for 2 persons to be eligible for the F100\n\nOur voting address and wallet for payment from the DAO is this: 0x46236f725FDc61DF68e6AB12D094Cf5995a15802, so feel free to verify. Most are in eth mainnet and a part of it is in polygon.\n\nI always believed in deeds, not words. I hope both of us have proven to be valuable members of the DAO through our actions, not merely in words.\n\nWould love to hear if there are anyone who opposes this? Please state why and I hope to address this.",

      "content": "In the past few epochs we have used the 'content filtering' system. However, this has been highly controversial. You may be thinking:  why do we need 'filtering or vouching' for our content? \n\n📌 The simple answer to that is: We are a marketing DAO and the quality of our content should be one of our top priorities.\n\nThe 'content filtering' system filters on the content level. The new 'vouching' system will filter on the 'CRE8R' level. How will this work?\n\n1. Coordinape has the vouching system built in. \n2. New CRE8RS (or ones that haven't made $2k + participated in 3 or more epochs) will need to be nominated by 1 'seasoned' CRE8R and then vouched in by 2 other 'seasoned' CRE8RS. \n3. There is no waiting period. Say if our next Coordinape epoch is 'Infinity Skies' and we have a few new CRE8RS that want to get compensated for their work. All they need is 1 nominator and 2 other cre8rs who vouch for them to enter the epoch.  This whole vouching ordeal can be done 1 or 2 days ahead of the start of the epoch.",

Currently these are organised into threads. \n\nThe idea of this is pretty simple. Weekly meetings cover too much stuff and there is to many open conversations in discord that are not being worked through to a conclusion. So now we can make dedicated groups that anyone can join. These groups will create proposals (for budget or otherwise) which will be voted on in snapshot if needed. \n\nThe members of these working groups should be rewarded for their effort! This proposal makes that possible.\n\nCurrent examples of active working groups (please note each one of these needs to apply for their share of the 100k budget). \n\nAlso note these groups may apply for additional budget which is outside of the 100k which is purely to reward working group members. \n\n-Token Use \n-Workflow Processes \n-Incentives for joining working groups and participating and getting the result \n-Strategy For Campaigns \n-Content Marketing For CRE8R DAO\n-Incentives program for KPI based clients\n\nWe ( @Bee926#4033 @PassiveCrypto#6857 @dunks411  ) propose  100k CRE8R Tokens to be made available for working groups. Each group will need to make their own proposals for their share of that budget.\n\nWorking groups can have their own Coordinape circles to distribute their share of the CRE8R tokens.\n\nThe proposals for share of 100k budget will need to pass certain criteria which may include:\n\n-timeline\n-specific, measurable results\n-etc\n\nThis criteria itself will be a work in progress that can be futher defined based on feedback from proposals. Founding 100 will be required to vote and give feedback the working groups proposals.  \n\nFinal note:\nThere is no timeline for the use of this 100k. Working groups can apply for as little or as much as they feel they need and the timeline and deliverables will be defined in those proposals. If all the 100k budget gets allocated then it will be up to the DAO to renew this budget or not. \n\nThis proposal just provides a basic framework and gives some permission to DAO members to apply for budget. \n",

      "content": "It has been suggested that we have other ways to raise money for liquidity which is true. But even these ways (pfp project) will cost money as well. PFP project needs devs and artists plus a lot of design and planning. \n\nIt may take months to do the PFP project properly without it being a low quality cash grab. If we are going to do it properly we should have money in treasury to pay for what we need not asking people to do stuff for equity (isn't that the suggested reason we don't want to sell our founding 100 NFT LOL?!?!). \n\nConsider the numbers 2% (rounded it up its actually 1.75%) share of DAO for min 50ETH (doesn't count price increase per epoch).  = 50ETH. Which is 150,000USD. \n\nThis puts full valuation at $7500,000 \n\nWith price increase per epoch we may not sell these fast (that's good we want to save a lot for creators) but the people who buy them will buy them for a reason. Because they want to be part of this and they will be paying a lot of money for that privilege! \n\nWe are not just selling a 1.75% (half of 3.5% assuming half sell half earned) share of the DAO we are offering different kinds of people who are not creators a chance to join us and help us in many ways. Clients can buy these if they want to be able to vote or we can gift them to repeat clients. People who like the project and have vision and energy to help steer it in the right direction can buy these and join in our early governance as well as helping with biz dev and internal processes, knowing that they are working on something they own a share of. \n\nAlso it gives these NFT's real value NOW. They are purchasable but you as a creator can earn them WHILE getting paid for client work. It also puts an incentive to work hard and get them quick because they can get bought up. Otherwise they can just sit there for months with no urgency to earn them. \n\nPlease stick to the original design of this. We have already sold one and the guy who bought it is super cool! Maybe chat with him and find out his perspective? IMO he is already a great asset to the DAO. \n\nNo matter what we need to honour his share of the tokens when they launch.   ",
