We thought Sanook was a defender but then we changed our minds and decided he was a striker … the Sanook project is in full flow. \nAfter a stop start season in 23, after coming back from injury, Bank took the TSP by the scruff of its neck and caused havoc with opposition defences. \nGolf started the season slowly, struggling to break into the side, but when he did he didn’t look back. \nGet voting!",

In a more advanced role he’s flourished for the black and gold, but is he more of a left midfielder than a winger? \n\nChoose wisely!",

Bringing height and excellent footwork into the front line SANOOK might just be ready to start up top in a competitive game. GOLF (77) is the obvious choice up top, he’s joint top scorer this season and has shown real growth both on and off the ball. \n\nIt is also overlooked just how good a footballer he is, which may be showcased perfectly alongside another forward. NUANG (37) is the perfect foil for a big striker up top. His vision, mixed with the little tricks that can open a defence, makes him an excellent choice. Who starts? You decide.",

We'd always planned to bring out a third kit but this has hurried along the process as they want it submitted in a couple of days and ready for the first game ... just in case!\n\nThis leaves us with a slight connundrum ... we wont have time to make a kit from scratch ... lucky we have a teamwear department though!\n\nSo basically from the off the shelf options that we have in stock - minus any that would further clash with our current home or away kit, we've put together 6 different options for you guys to vote on!\n\nWith the home kit in the traditional Black and Gold and  away kit in moon camo, this third kit needs to be a contrast of the two.\n\nWhichever has the most votes will go into heat press later this week!\n\nChoose wisely, you never know when we might need it (or when we come up against a team in black and white stripes!)\n\nCheck out the Designs in the link below!",

In recent games BAS (16) has started to show his quality in the centre of the park, offering a calmness in the centre of the park. PHU (11) is our top goalscorer, but offers so much more than just an attacking threat. In recent games he’s almost turned into a box-to-box midfielder, bringing an energy we’ve rarely seen in midfield. BEEM (35), at just 16 is already showing a lot of the same qualities that JEW possesses. Brilliant on the ball and with an eye for the spectacular, he is the most natural replacement for our skipper.

      "content": "Since the team were founded almost 2 years ago, the position of centre forward has been the most difficult for us to cover. Whether it was a player who left after a few games (no names mentioned - Tishan) or players who have tried to make the position their own, it has never quite worked. However, with 5 goals in the last few games GOLF (77) may be the first player to stake a claim at being our first choice centre forward - the coaches think he’s getting better and better, should he start? MAI (13) is now 100% fit and is the only other player in the squad who has started to look like a genuine contender to GOLF (77) - should he get his chance?  TAN (25) signed this week after two impressive trials with the club … including a world class goal. He’s very direct and has an eye for goal, but is he better suited out wide? It’s your choice!",

Time to decide on the colour of our THIRD KIT! 🎨\n\nRemember Man City's '93 away kit that looked like a melted ice cream cone? Or Chelsea's '94 orange and grey combo that screamed fashion disaster? Well, now's your chance to make history (or a hilarious mistake) with our third kit!\n\nWill it be a classy off-white or a risky red? Or perhaps you're feeling bold with Purple, Orange, or another go at controversial Pink? Just remember, black and gold are off the table (we've been there, done that).\n\nChoose from these 10 colors: White, Off-White, Purple, Green, Pink, Sky Blue, Red, Royal Blue, Yellow or Orange.\n\nSo whether you want to channel the elegance of minimalism or the unforgettable 'creativity' of some of the worst third kits in history, the choice is yours! Let's make this one to remember (for better or worse)! 😂",

Our reputation means younger teams will probably try and catch us on the break and so who we play at CB could be key in this fixture. TEWIT (24) is blessed with pace and a pang-like work-rate, however do we need our two experienced CB’s MARK (79) and M (4) at the back to quell any threat, or is our normal mix of youth and experience best? With all three being excellent so far this year, it’s a tough choice. Who do you want?\n\n\n \n![CB.jpg](ipfs://bafkreibuc3ld575j35kmmdsjcxmyjd6ji6hsi2xvsutaijotasxva54pti)\n    ",

GOLF (77) scored two in his trial vs Hippo and although he failed to get on the scoresheet vs Chibuna he did cause problems for them.

Or maybe just keep pink!\n\nOnce again the choice is yours!!! \n\nThe colour range that you can pick for the away shirt is narrow as the kit will have to contrast the home’s black and gold colour scheme.

We need you to review and carefully consider all of the options before casting your vote. Take a look.  \n\nAs a special initiative this year, we’ve also involved the players in the design process, with AEK (24) designing kit number 11 in the choices. There will be at least one design by AEK in each of the 3 kit votes (Away and Third … at last!)\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ckcner2peuebqk3/FuteraUnited_2023Home.pdf?dl=0\n\nJust think, this could be the jersey you'll be flexing in your local store or while you play 5-a-side with your mates. \n\nAnd obviously, it will be worn by the lads and seen by thousands of football fans across the world … so no pressure!\n\n \n![6-2.jpg](ipfs://bafkreiefbxy6ghedxhzakxkyqzxlc75n27uhd2t43yesefg4goxmz5y6im)\n    ",

Vote the players you feel we should sign, you can vote for as many of the players as you want, with the top 2 players who gain the most votes signing for the club. If the third placed player gets a significant amount of votes (considerably clear of 4th place) then we will look to sign them also.\n\nLets look at the trialists:  \n\nPond - number 18 jersey (GK)\nA 17 year old Goalkeeper with incredible amounts of confidence. The 6’ 3” keeper currently plays school football with Phu and has proven himself more than capable at this level. After two trial games he's has proved to be a great shot stopper however we would need to allow him to develop his decision making due to his young age and experience. A great understudy to the brilliant FILM maybe?\n\nPoom - number 6 jersey (LB)\nA 22 year old left back, today was Poom’s second trial game for us. At times he was caught out by the pace of the game and his final delivery was lacking in key moments, but in both games he did the simple things well and didn’t give away possession. With a wealth of options on the left hand side of defence would Poom manage to force his way into the team?\n\nNopo - 9 - number 9 jersey (LW, CF, RW)\nA 22 year old forward who graduated PSW alongside our number 22 KAO. Similar in style to our first choice striker Nopo has put in two accomplished performances for Futera United in his trial games and very much looks ready to step up to this level. His versatility across the front line may make him a valuable asset to the squad.\n\nBew (Ian) - number 22 jersey (CM, DM)\nA 23 year old central midfielder who can also play in the holding role, Bew has been on the books of a T2 side and showed today how comfortable he is with the ball at his feet. Another PSW graduate, he brought energy to the side when he came on today and could be a real find for Futera United.\n\nWho do we sign … you decide!! \n(Watch the game vs Chamchuri in the link below)\n\n",

BANK (23) always impresses on either flank but did his heroics on Wednesday, in awful conditions, take too much out of him? GAEL (67) has played on the right throughout the season, however does his recent poor run of form coupled with his ability to disrupt tired legs off the bench mean that he is better used as an impact sub? MAI (13) was outstanding at times on the right earlier in the season until he was injured, but with him now back to full fitness is it time to unleash him back into the BPL? The choice is yours!\n(Watch our last game in the link below)\n\n \n![RW.jpg](ipfs://bafkreie5p2ued6fpebeont3yfjmj4mcsnd5arallasvcbsxnjudidaniqm)\n    ",
