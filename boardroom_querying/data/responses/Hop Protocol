      "title": "Hop Grants Program Renewal and Redesign",
      "content": "This is a snapshot vote on the Renewal and Redesign of Hop’s Grants Program. The overarching goal of this new grants program is to drive high quality application volume. The Grants Committee is primarily but not solely targeting; cross-chain tooling & infrastructure, research & analytics, marketing & education, and onboarding, therefore the total grant program of 750k Hop tokens seems very low. The max grant allocation of 100k Hop tokens also seems really low which potentially discouraged high quality grantees from applying.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that there were few grant applicants demonstrates that there wasn’t enough awareness of the grants program to attract applicants. Finally, another issue with the previous program was the lack of incentivization for grant committee members which lead to apathy and lack of focus from some committee members.\n\nThe proposal below is based on the most recent feedback and conversations with community members. \n\n1.\tThis proposal plans to increase the grants program by 3x; therefore, the new grants program amount shall be 2.25 million Hop tokens, and the max grant allocation amount will be eliminated. Approved grants are to be funded based on milestones and payments made periodically.\n\n2.\tThere shall be three grant committee members elected by the DAO that will each receive a base salary of $500/month (in HOP) and their base responsibilities will be:\na.\tPromote the grants program to attract grant applications. For example, hosting discord calls or twitter spaces. \nb.\tShare quarterly participation and voting metrics with the DAO. If a grant committee member isn’t voting and communicating in at least 70% of the grants, this committee member can be fired and replaced through a vote. \n\n3.\tGrant committee members shall have the ability to ask the DAO for up to 15% of the grant amount as retroactive commission if the individual committee member sponsors a grant applicant. The sponsor role entails guiding the grant applicant through the application process and monitoring the disbursement and usage of the grant in accordance to its original stated purpose and time frame. If a person applies to the grants program without going through any grant committee member, then a grant committee member will be assigned at random. In the scenario where one grant applicant ends up receiving the entire grant program amount it would make sense for the three grant committee members to be the sponsors and share the responsibilities and commission equally.  \n\n4.\tThe three grant committee members will vote on each grant application and there will be a 7-day period where the DAO can veto approved applications.",

      "title": "[HIP- 46] Renewal of Hop Delegate Incentivization Trial (Third Cycle)",
      "content": "Simple Summary\nOver the past year, Hop DAO trialed delegate compensation to participate in Hop DAO Governance actively. This is a proposal to extend the Hop Delegate Incentivization Program for another 6-month period while integrating the feedback from community members to this new cycle.\n\nThe main proposed changes are for delegate compensation to have a 2.5x multiplier at the end of the formula to increase overall incentives for delegates, to add a gas rebate fund for delegate on-chain voting (capped at $500/month to be paid in HOP), and finally for delegate rewards to vest for a 6-month period. While the rewards will be earned monthly, the rewards will be locked for a subsequent 6-month period. To clarify, if you earn rewards in March, the rewards for that month will be locked until September. If you earn rewards in April, the rewards for that month will be locked until October. \n\nMotivation\nThrough the delegate incentivization trial over the past year, delegates have been incentivized to actively participate in Hop DAO Governance by taking part in discussions on the forum, voting on proposals and ensuring to share their rationale for voting a particular way. This program has created a healthy culture of governance-related engagement in the Hop DAO.\n\nRenewing this Hop Delegate Incentivization trial will ensure that the quality of Hop DAO does not decline.\n\nThis Incentivization Program will retain the delegate talent that the Hop DAO has attracted; its continued existence will allow future delegates to join the Hop DAO and allocate resources to improving the Hop Protocol.\n\nHow did the program work?\nDelegates are required to vote on proposals and communicate their rationale for voting in their delegate thread on the Hop DAO Forum.\nUnder the current Delegate Compensation Program, delegates are compensated using a formula where delegate incentives increase with the amount of HOP delegated, but in a decreasing fashion. This means that a small delegate will receive a greater incentive per voting weight than a large delegate, but a larger delegate will receive more.\n\nDelegates utilize a previously shared Dune Querry to ascertain their lowest level of Hop for that month and use the visualization graph to ascertain the incentives they are due according to their lowest amount of Hop for that month.\nFinally, delegates would self-report under a thread dedicated to reporting delegate eligibility each month. The following information would be required of a delegate.\nVote participation percent = (Number of proposals voted upon ÷ all proposals) * 100\nCommunication participation percentage = Number of proposals referenced with voting position and reasoning for that position ÷ all proposals) * 100\nLowest Amount of Hop for the period\nIncentives to be paid out.\n\nCurrent Proposed Changes to the Program\n1) The previous delegate incentive program amendment in the paragraph below (multiplier based on participation periods) has been replaced with a new multiplier. The new multiplier is 2.5x to be calculated at the end of the formula. \nThe formula for delegate incentives is:\nI = ((log(h)-4.55) *3500) *2.5\nWhere:\nI = Incentives to be received\nh = lowest level of HOP delegated that month\n\n2) There will now be a gas rebate fund capped at $500/month (to be paid in HOP tokens) to compensate delegates for their on-chain voting expenses related to Hop DAO. Each delegate is responsible for sharing a detailed spreadsheet with each voting transaction with the DAO to qualify for the gas rebate program.\n\n3) Rewards will vest for a subsequent 6-month period to further align delegates with the DAO.\n\nPrevious Changes to the Program\nSequel to the feedback provided in the previous proposal, the following changes were implemented in the previous renewal proposal.\nThere shall be a new formula used to calculate incentives.\nWhere:\nI = Incentives to be received\nh = lowest level of HOP delegated that month\nM = Multiplier based on consecutive participation periods\nTo calculate the multiplier (M), we can use the following formula:\nM = 1 + (0.1 * P)\nWhere:\nP = Number of consecutive completed 6-month participation periods (capped at a certain value, e.g., 5)\nThis multiplier starts at 1 for new delegates and increases by 0.1 for each consecutive completed 6-month participation period, capped at a certain value (e.g., 1.5 after five periods).\nThe Participation rate would be removed; therefore, new delegates who reach the 90,000 threshold could join as delegates at any time.\nThe incentive formula would be amended to include a Multiplier based on consecutive participation periods.\nThe primary import of these changes is that new delegates can join Hop Governance at any time, while old delegates are incentivized to continue participating.\nThere is no opt-in or opt-out mechanism. Delegates will have to self-report to receive compensation.\n\nSpecification\nThis proposal requests for the Hop Delegate Incentivization Program to be renewed for another six months; the program will retain all the guidelines and procedures laid down by the original proposal 18 2, its subsequent amendment 11 and amendment in previous renewal 1.\n\nNext Steps.\nIf this proposal passes, the Hop DAO Delegate Incentivization Program will continue for another six months.",

      "title": "[HIP-40] Treasury Diversification and Protocol Owned Liquidity",
      "content": "**Goals and Motivation**\n\nIn the interest of bolstering the financial health and autonomy of the Hop Protocol, this proposal presents an initiative to further diversify the Hop DAO treasury holdings while establishing the beginnings of significant protocol-owned liquidity (POL). This move aims to mitigate the current skew between HOP’s circulating market cap and its fully diluted value, which stands as an impediment to stable price discovery and large-scale, value-aligned investment in HOP from non-private parties.\n\nHOP’s circulating to fully diluted supply is far too skewed (4M circulating mkt cap, 40M fully diluted value FDV). This skew makes it difficult for proper price discovery to occur and even more difficult for anyone to make a large, opinionated allocation to HOP at a stable valuation in the open market. Moreover, as the HOP token is playing an increasingly growing role in the protocol, POL increases accessibility for the token while generating fees for the DAO. This proposal brings idle HOP into the market, makes it productive, increases market liquidity, and retains DAO ownership.\n\nGenerally, the amounts are small and ensure a continued reserve of HOP in the treasury for future developmental use cases such as grants, incentives, and other value-creating opportunities.\n\n**Proposal Details**\nThis proposal would seek to:\n\n1. Allocate 1,500,000 HOP ($57,000 @ $.036) and 57,000 USDC from the treasury for distribution to Mainnet, Optimism, and Arbitrum. **The total value is ~$114,000 ($57,000 + $57,000).**\n2. Sell 57,000 USDC for ETH\n3. Bridge HOP and ETH to each chain in the predetermined proportions (see calculations further down in proposal):\n\n* **Mainnet:** 50%\n* **Optimism:** 30%\n* **Arbitrum:** 20%\n\n1. Deposit HOP/ETH liquidity into DEXes\n\n* **Mainnet:** Uniswap v3 0.3% tier full range\n* **Optimism:** Velodrome v2\n* **Arbitrum:** Camelot v2 (potentially v3?)\n\n1. Lastly, deposit veNFT into compounding Relay strategy created for us by Velodrome (including this in this proposal, because it’s DEX related and fairly low stakes)\n\nEach chain/dex’s proportion of the 1,500,000 HOP is decided as a blended percentage of each DEX’s HOP liquidity & HOP 24 hr volume, and each chain’s percentage of Hop protocol’s bridging volumes (from volume.hop.exchange). Current HOP/ETH liquidity across chains is ~$350,000, so this proposal would increase the outstanding liquidity by ~33%. You can see the breakdown of current liquidity, volume, and bridge volume here in order to calculate the blended percentages:\n\n[link to sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mVafAHRyysYUGdPDyzO8Y7OxDmYJ6yHiHhrPC-5rCNM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThese 3 chains are lower hanging fruit because we already have multisig capabilities and they’re the top 3 by liquidity and bridging profiles by quite a large margin. In the future we can and should look into Base, Polygon, Gnosis and other chains that Hop Protocol supports.\n\nNotably, this proposal requires zero expenditures or ongoing incentives from the DAO. It simply pairs idle HOP in the treasury with a small amount of idle USDC (to sell for ETH).\n\n\n\nUpdate since last Snapshot vote\n\n\\*The amount of HOP tokens has been increased from 1.1 million (in the Snapshot vote) to 1.5 million to balance the amount of stablecoins and HOP tokens&#x20;",

Community feedback has been used to refine this proposal.  \n\nThe Head of DAO Operations is not to be construed as a central figure of authority but more like the glue that connects different aspects of the DAO and makes sure there is cross collaboration and communication and helps propagate personal responsibilities for each of the DAOs subgroups. It is imperative for the Head of DAO ops to be fully aligned. Therefore, to qualify for the role one must have been materially active in the DAO for at least 6-months, having attended community calls, posted on the forum, used the hop bridge, held hop).\n\nThe Head of DAO Ops will take lead in community calls, the governance forum (pushing proposals from start to finish with the respective author), and pushing along the grants committee, ambassador program and multisig signers.\n\nAdditional responsibilities:\n⁃ evaluating and defining compensation for existing and new committees and their members\n⁃ Assigning budgets to committees\n⁃ Verifying the data posted each month for the delegate compensation thread\n⁃ Providing a monthly report to DAO on DAO operations for feedback from the DAO\n⁃ Oversee and manage the transition from old committee members to new committee members when appropriate\n⁃ More rapidly iterate on HIP amendments when they are needed\n⁃ Help reform the grants committee and handle some of the ops side\n⁃ Expected hours are about 30 a month (1.5 hrs day)\n⁃ If a good faith effort to accomplish the tasks set forth as the Head of DAO ops is not made, the DAO will not pay the compensation. The monthly report should help in consideration of a good faith effort.\n\nIf this proposal passes there will be an election to determine who takes on this role.\n \nThis role shall go through an initial 6-month term to make sure DAO operations continue to run smoothly in the short term while preparing for a long-term solution regarding ongoing operations. After the initial term the DAO can vote to extend the term. Since this role requires constant participation and time commitment, I believe compensation for this role should be $3k/month with a 12-month vesting period. While the payment is earned after the 6-month period, it will still vest for another 6 months. \n\nCompensation to be made in HOP token. Vesting starts the day after the election when the role officially begins and the work is to commence. Payment to be made retroactively every 3-months.",

      "title": "Hop Community Moderator Compensation",
      "content": "This proposal will provide retroactive compensation to Rxpwnz and the rest of the moderator team who have all provided essential support for the past year and a half. It will also establish a Lead Community Moderator role and sets up an ongoing moderator compensation program to continue rewarding these contributors.\n\nBackground\nSince Hop’s inception over a year ago, the role of Community Moderator has been entirely voluntary. This arrangement served the DAO well and attracted moderators driven by genuine enthusiasm for the protocol rather than financial incentives. However, it is now crucial to establish a structured framework for rewarding, managing, and training these contributors.\n\nThe Hop Community Moderators watch the Hop Discord and forum 24/7 to mitigate spam, scammers, technical difficulties, and much more. This includes manually banned approximately 5,000 Discord scammer or spam profiles, fielding an endless stream of questions from the community, and keeping appropriate stakeholders informed to ensure technical issues are resolved quickly. They’ve played an essential role in building Hop into the trusted platform it is today.\n\nRxpwnz has taken on a leadership role on the moderator team and regularly goes above and beyond basic moderator responsibilities. He regularly delves into technical and operational security topics including assisting with stuck transactions and reporting phishing websites to Metamask, Google and DNS providers leading to their rapid deactivation. He continually contributes ideas to enhance various aspects of Discord operations. This includes integrating Discord bots and streamlining channels to ensure they remain clean and topic-related. During Arbitrum Bridge Week, he even provided users with his own personal funds to help cover gas fees when needed.\n\nRetrospective Rewards for Dedicated Moderators\nOur community moderators have been actively contributing for over 18 months, and it’s time to recognize and reward their invaluable efforts in driving Hop’s growth.\n\nRxpwnz has been consistently engaged in a wide range of responsibilities, which include Discord and Forum moderation, managing Hop Guild, enhancing operational security (OpSec) by identifying and taking down over 150 phishing sites impersonating Hop, contributing to business development discussions regarding potential partnerships, engaging with developers interested in collaborating with Hop, and offering troubleshooting and improvement assistance. We propose a compensation rate of $3,000/month, both for his active contributions and in retrospective recognition starting June 9th, 2022. This compensation will be divided in a 50:50 ratio between $USDC and $HOP, with the latter being linearly vested over a 1-year period.\n\nOur other moderators, while relatively less active, have been instrumental in moderation tasks and effectively conveying information about issues to key stakeholders. To acknowledge their important contributions, we propose one-time bonuses as follows:\n\nNauzystan: $4,000\nCai: $2,000\nHossein: $1,000\nAbruzy: $1,000\n\nCompensation for these bonuses will also be distributed in a 50:50 ratio between $USDC and $HOP, with the latter subject to linear vesting over 1 year.\n\nThe amount of $HOP distributed for retroactive payments should be calculated using the time-weighted average price from the launch of Hop DAO to the date of this proposal passing. Partial months should be prorated appropriately.\n\nEstablishing a Lead Community Moderator Role\nThis proposal establishes a Lead Community Moderator role initially filled by Rxpwnz. A new Lead Community Moderator can be appointed via subsequent governance proposal or by election should there be multiple interested individuals.\n\nCompensation system\nIn addition to the ongoing compensation for the Lead Community Moderator mentioned above, this proposal establishes a discretionary budget to be used by the lead moderator to reward volunteer moderators from the community. Each month, approximately $2,000 worth of $HOP tokens will be made available to the Lead Community Moderator to distribute to the moderator team when appropriate. The lead moderator will conduct monthly assessments, guided by considerations of individual involvement and performance (activity and delivered Key Performance Indicators) to determine compensation. Any amounts distributed and their justification will be reported by the Lead Community Moderator to the Hop community in either written form or on the regular community calls. In months where the lead chooses to distribute only part or none of the budget, the $HOP will remain in the Hop Community Multisig and does not accrue toward future months.",

      "title": "[HIP-41] Incentivize Hop AMMs on Supported and Upcoming Chains",
      "content": "**Author:** shanefontaine  \n**Date:** December 5, 2023\n\n## Summary\n\nHop V1 is on track to be deployed on a number of new chains in the Ethereum ecosystem that have already gone through Hop governance. This includes:\n\n- Linea (Live on Nov 6)\n- Polygon zkEVM (Successful Snapshot Vote)\n- Scroll (Successful Snapshot Vote)\n- zkSync (Successful Snapshot Vote)\n- PGN (RFC Only, still needs Snapshot vote)\n\nIt is likely that the ETH and HOP bridges will be deployed on each of these chains. Given that, the ETH bridges would benefit from having AMM incentives applied to them to help for a seamless Hop experience. The HOP bridges do not use AMMs and will not be considered for these incentives.\n\nThis proposal suggests allocating HOP to the ETH AMMs of the new chains to be supported by Hop. If accepted, there will not be a new post/vote for the addition of incentives on the new chains since this is meant to account for all of them.\n\nThis post is meant to open up the discussion about the addition of incentives on these chains and their respective amounts.\n\n\n\n## Proposed Amounts\n\nThis proposal seeks to set up an incentive program for the ETH AMM on Linea, Polygon zkEVM, Scroll, zkSync, and PGN. The incentive values below were calculated by looking at the TVL of each chain and comparing it to the TVL of Optimism and multiplying that ratio with the HOP incentives on the ETH bridge on Optimism to derive a value. A multiplier of 3x was added to account for the potential growth of these chains given that they have been live for far shorter than the reference chain, Optimism. The exact formula used is:\n\n\n`HOP Incentive Amount = (Chain TVL / Optimism TVL) * Optimism ETH Bridge HOP Incentives * 3`\n\nUsing the TVL data from L2Beat on December 5th, 2023 and applying that calculation to each chain, we get:\n\n| Chain         | TVL (Million) | HOP Incentives / Month |\n|---------------|--------------:|-----------------------:|\n| Optimism      |   $4,130.00   |                346,800 |\n| Linea         |     $175.00   |                 44,085 |\n| Polygon zkEVM*|     $114.00   |                 28,718 |\n| Scroll        |      $42.90   |                 10,807 |\n| zkSync        |     $536.00   |                135,025 |\n| PGN**         |       $1.53   |                    385 |\n\n\n*The original Polygon zkEVM proposal asked to reallocate 15% of the current Polygon PoS chain’s incentives to the Polygon zkEVM chain. This will be applied automatically, as it has already been voted on, but is not counted in the numbers from this proposal. With these additional 15%, the number of HOP incentives distributed on Polygon zkEVM becomes 60,968 per month.\n\n**It is expected that the TVL of PGN will drastically increase prior to Hop support so that the effort/time/cost of supporting the chain makes sense for the entire Hop ecosystem. The support of the chain must also pass a Snapshot vote.\n\nThese values should give the AMM on each network the ability to build up liquidity for an awesome Hop experience. Summing all the new incentives results in 219,021 additional HOP distributed per month, or 2,628,252 per year (0.263% of the total supply). However, it is expected that (1) some of these chains will not be live for a few weeks or months, and (2) when they are live, these will only be live for a few a short distribution cycles until the release of V2.\n\nIt is important to note that Hop V2 is coming soon. The system is set up in such a way that direct incentives will be far less important to the health of the system and thus this current incentive system will not apply for Hop V2. These proposed Hop V1 incentives will only be in place until V2 is fully live, meaning that these incentives will only be distributed a small handful of times.\n\n## Timeline/Next Steps\n\n\n- This RFC will last a few days in order to gather any appropriate discussion or feedback.\n- After discussion and feedback, a delegate will post this proposal to Snapshot.\n- If the Snapshot vote passes, AMM incentives for the ETH bridge on these chains will be automatically applied when the chain is supported.",

      "title": "[Temperature Check] Treasury Diversification & Protocol Owned Liquidity (multichain HOP/ETH LPs)",
      "content": "**Goals and Motivation**\n\nIn the interest of bolstering the financial health and autonomy of the Hop Protocol, this proposal presents an initiative to further diversify the Hop DAO treasury holdings while establishing the beginnings of significant protocol-owned liquidity (POL). This move aims to mitigate the current skew between HOP’s circulating market cap and its fully diluted value, which stands as an impediment to stable price discovery and large-scale, value-aligned investment in HOP from non-private parties.\n\nHOP’s circulating to fully diluted supply is far too skewed (4M circulating mkt cap, 40M fully diluted value FDV). This skew makes it difficult for proper price discovery to occur and even more difficult for anyone to make a large, opinionated allocation to HOP at a stable valuation in the open market. Moreover, as the HOP token is playing an increasingly growing role in the protocol, POL increases accessibility for the token while generating fees for the DAO. This proposal brings idle HOP into the market, makes it productive, increases market liquidity, and retains DAO ownership.\n\nGenerally, the amounts are small and ensure a continued reserve of HOP in the treasury for future developmental use cases such as grants, incentives, and other value-creating opportunities.\n\n**Proposal Details**\nThis proposal would seek to:\n\n1. Allocate 1,100,000 HOP ($57,000 @ $.052) and 57,000 USDC from the treasury for distribution to Mainnet, Optimism, and Arbitrum. **The total value is ~$114,000 ($57,000 + $57,000).**\n2. Sell 57,000 USDC for ETH\n3. Bridge HOP and ETH to each chain in the predetermined proportions (see calculations further down in proposal):\n  * **Mainnet:** 50%\n  * **Optimism:** 30%\n  * **Arbitrum:** 20%\n4. Deposit HOP/ETH liquidity into DEXes\n  * **Mainnet:** Uniswap v3 0.3% tier full range\n  * **Optimism:** Velodrome v2\n  * **Arbitrum:** Camelot v2 (potentially v3?)\n5. Lastly, deposit veNFT into compounding Relay strategy created for us by Velodrome (including this in this proposal, because it’s DEX related and fairly low stakes)\n\nEach chain/dex’s proportion of the 1,100,000 HOP is decided as a blended percentage of each DEX’s HOP liquidity & HOP 24 hr volume, and each chain’s percentage of Hop protocol’s bridging volumes (from volume.hop.exchange). Current HOP/ETH liquidity across chains is ~$350,000, so this proposal would increase the outstanding liquidity by ~33%. You can see the breakdown of current liquidity, volume, and bridge volume here in order to calculate the blended percentages:\n\n[link to sheet ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mVafAHRyysYUGdPDyzO8Y7OxDmYJ6yHiHhrPC-5rCNM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThese 3 chains are lower hanging fruit because we already have multisig capabilities and they’re the top 3 by liquidity and bridging profiles by quite a large margin. In the future we can and should look into Base, Polygon, Gnosis and other chains that Hop Protocol supports.\n\nNotably, this proposal requires zero expenditures or ongoing incentives from the DAO. It simply pairs idle HOP in the treasury with a small amount of idle USDC (to sell for ETH).",

If Hop DAO possesses stablecoins, $260k of the $460k should be paid to Authereum Labs and $200k should be deferred to another date.

      "title": "[HIP-36] Launch Hop on Base Mainnet",
      "content": "## Summary\n\n[Base](https://base.org/) is a secure, low-cost, builder-friendly Ethereum L2 built to bring the next billion users onchain. It is built on Optimism’s open-source OP Stack & the core dev team at Base is joining Optimism as the second Core Dev team working on the OP Stack to ensure it’s a public good available to everyone; and contributing a portion of sequencer revenue to funding public goods.\n\nThis post seeks to open a discussion around the onboarding of Base into the Hop ecosystem by initially supporting ETH, USDC, and HOP during the launch of Base and incentivizing the AMMs. After some discussion on this post, a Snapshot vote will be posted. The Base chain will be available to the all in “early August”.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Base ecosystem is already vibrant with activity and could become one of the top chains by volume for Hop and the broader crypto ecosystem. Many dapps have already started to build on Base, and one goal for the chain is to allow various protocols to “get in front of [the tens of millions of] users in the Coinbase ecosystem”. [[1](https://base.mirror.xyz/1Rg4qIYKnxxHUKDhB4XFlgXFnusVhupfFpgLuWjr2SU)]\n\nHop’s relationship & integration with Coinbase products can already been used today in the Coinbase Wallet mobile app and browser extension. This integration with Base is a logical extension of this relationship that should help the Hop ecosystem solidify itself more firmly within the Coinbase ecosystem.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the integration is nearly identical to the already deployed Optimism bridges. Since Base is built on Optimism’s OP Stack, there are very few changes to the code, deployment process, trust assumptions, and tooling required for integration with Hop.\n\nBase [takes a security-first Approach ](https://base.mirror.xyz/_SiAx8dQRYJJ4lygkJc0QvBKvf16VVm7_-mdWMdFv20). On top of inheriting the already-strong security standards of the OP stack, they have also deployed their own resources to independently audit the system, thus providing additional security to Optimism users and Hop users by extension.\n\n## Incentives\n\nThis proposal seeks to set up an incentive program for the ETH and USDC AMMs on Base. The proposed values below were calculated by taking 10% of the existing monthly HOP incentives for ETH and USDC (respectively) on Optimism. These values reflect the fact that it is likely that Base will reach up to, or exceed, 10% of Optimism’s TVL over time. **The need for a more cohesive system for distributing Hop incentives has been an active area of discussion/research and these incentives will last only until such a system is in place.**\n\n* 34,680 HOP per month on the ETH AMM on Base\n* 24,140 HOP per month on the USDC AMM on Base\n\n## Timeline/Next Steps\n\n* This RFC will last a few days in order to gather any appropriate discussion or feedback.\n* After discussion and feedback, a delegate will post this proposal to Snapshot.\n* If the Snapshot vote passes, the Hop UI will support Base with ETH, USDC, and HOP on Day 1.",

However, the multi- sig’s purpose should be to reduce its role in the DAO as much as possible.\n•\tEach signer will be responsible for verifying transactions, checking Merkle roots, and signing off on transactions as necessary.\n•\tThe signers will work together to manage the nomination and election process, with each signer taking on specific tasks to ensure the process runs smoothly.\n•\tThe signers will also work together to manage the day-to-day operations of the multisig, including responding to questions from the community and ensuring that transactions are executed in a timely and efficient manner.\n\nHop DAO MultiSig Signers Expense: As an amendment to HIP-12 4, Multi-Sig Signer compensation will be $2,250 twice a year for = $4,500 * 5 = $22,500\nBringing the total cost to = $22,500\n\nGas Rebates: As ETH is spent to execute multisig transactions, we propose that each signer is reimbursed for the exact amount of gas spent during the 6-month term. To be eligible for a rebate, we propose that signers use a Google Sheet template to track gas costs. A dune dashboard or other data query can replace this. We further propose that gas rebates (but not full compensation), where reasonable, are extended to all Hop-related multisigs (e.g. Grants Program multisig).",

      "title": "[Temperature Check] - Revised HOP Liquidity Incentives",
      "content": "The HOP DAO has been airdropped a significant portion of ARB & OP for the protocol's vital role in the Ethereum ecosystem. This temperature check gauges the demand for using a small portion of the protocol's ARB allocation to garner protocol owned liquidity (PoL) - in the form of either HOP / ETH or HOP / rETH. \n\nIf the community selects to go forward with the proposal, key contributors including the multi-signers could work in partnership with Bond Protocol & potentially RocketPool to create a 2 week Bond trial with 15k ARB in incentives. If successful (bonds sell at <= 10% discount), another 15K ARB will be allocated to a second 2 week bond. \n\nMoving forward with this proposal could help facilitate permanent liquidity for the HOP token on the leading layer 2 network, while simultaneously strengthening partnerships with other protocols in the ecosystem. This proposal attempted to use feedback from other community members & the team at Bond Protocol. It is highly recommend that voters read the respective forum post and other discussions around liquidity in previous posts and Discord.\n\nThe three potential choices would be as follows:\n1. HOP/ETH Camelot PoL Bonds (15k ARB incentives) in partnership with Bond Protocol\n2. HOP/rETH Camelot PoL Bonds (15k ARB incentives and potentially additional RPL to incentivize Camelot directly) in partnership with Bond Protocol & RocketPool\n3. No change",

      "title": "[HIP-30] HOP Airdrop Sybil Hunter Distribution",
      "content": "`Authors: @shanefontaine`\n\n# Overview\nWhen the Hop DAO was launched, Sybil hunters submitted reports that ultimately removed Sybil attackers from the HOP airdrop, resulting in the DAO keeping almost 3.5 million tokens that would have otherwise been in the hands of Sybil attackers. Per the Hop DAO introduction post, this proposal seeks to reward these Sybil hunters with 25% of the saved tokens now, a year after the start of the DAO.\n\nBeyond the direct benefits of token recovery, the Sybil hunters also contributed to promoting the DAO in indirect ways. Both the SAFE airdrop and the Arbitrum airdrop adopted elements of Hop’s airdrop design as a result of the hunters’ effort and innovation, thus validating and enhancing the DAO’s influence.

The address of the verified contract is 0xD62524e1Bd146AB1a8e3D03ea8646870E3684fEe .

      "title": "[Temperature Check] Claim ARB airdrop, create Arbitrum and Optimism community multisigs, and delegate tokens to Ambassadors",
      "content": "Authors: @max-andrew\n\n# Summary:\nThis proposal will do three things. It will create two new Hop community multisigs for the Arbitrum and Optimism networks. It will claim the Arbitrum airdrop allocated to the Hop timelock address, sending that ARB to the new community multisig. Lastly, it will delegate the tokens in the community multisigs to the new ambassador multisigs on each network. This proposal does not prevent the community multisig from spending the tokens in the way the community sees fit, but would allow Hop to more effectively represent itself in the Arbitrum and Optimism communities. If successful, this proposal will move to an onchain vote to enable the claiming and sending of the ARB tokens.\n\n# Rationale:\nMoving these funds to a community multisig gives the DAO more flexibility in their use. Furthermore, delegating to multisigs managed by Hop’s ambassadors allows Hop to use the reserves to better advocate for itself within important partner protocols' communities.\n\n# Specification:\n\n- Two new multisigs are created with coordination from the existing multisig signers: one for both Arbitrum and Optimism\n\n- The new L2 community multisig signers will be the same as the existing, elected multisig signers\n\n- The community multisigs are bound to act in accordance with decisions made through governance votes only and are prohibited from making independent decisions on the use of these funds\n\n- The DAO claims the tokens allocated to the Arbitrum timelock address\n\n- The DAO sends the ARB claimed to the new Arbitrum community multisig address\n\n- The community multisig signers delegate these wallets to the new ambassador multisig addresses",

      "title": "[Temperature Check] HOP Airdrop Sybil Hunter Distribution",
      "content": "Authors: @shanefontaine\n\n## Overview\n\nWhen the Hop DAO was launched, Sybil hunters submitted reports that ultimately removed Sybil attackers from the HOP airdrop, resulting in the DAO keeping almost 3.5 million tokens that would have otherwise been in the hands of Sybil attackers. Per the [Hop DAO introduction post](https://hop.mirror.xyz/AI5fOUR0X_l0mktShDOx3mwr-hsB24gp8GvTWtS-MBc), this proposal seeks to reward these Sybil hunters with 25% of the saved tokens now, a year after the start of the DAO.\n\nBeyond the direct benefits of token recovery, the Sybil hunters also contributed to promoting the DAO in indirect ways. Both the [SAFE airdrop](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-user-allocation-reports) and the [Arbitrum airdrop](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/airdrop-eligibility-distribution) adopted elements of Hop’s airdrop design as a result of the hunters’ effort and innovation, thus validating and enhancing the DAO’s influence. Each of those teams specifically called out Hop as inspiration during their airdrop process.\n\n## Specific Details\n\n* Total tokens to distribute: 869,566.51\n* Total recipients: 35\n* Distribution method: The DAO will send funds to an [OpenZeppelin PaymentSplitter ](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/finance/PaymentSplitter.sol) contract that allows the addresses to claim tokens sent to the contract. The address of the verified contract is [`0xD62524e1Bd146AB1a8e3D03ea8646870E3684fEe` ](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd62524e1bd146ab1a8e3d03ea8646870e3684fee). The contract claim start time will be Fri Jun 09 2023 10:48:36 GMT+0000, which is the same start time as all of the HOP vesting contracts created at the beginning of the DAO’s lifetime.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nBased on the process defined in [HIP-13 ](https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth/proposal/0xdf8dbd41184c7c401ee326c62ca6e253a8fa856b825b7d9e9311ce0faea4a5ef), this RFC will move from the forum to a proposal on Snapshot and subsequently onto Tally, assuming consensus is reached at each stage.\n\n## References\n\n* [Hop DAO introduction post](https://hop.mirror.xyz/AI5fOUR0X_l0mktShDOx3mwr-hsB24gp8GvTWtS-MBc)\n* [Sybil hunter submissions ](https://github.com/hop-protocol/hop-airdrop)\n* [Twitter overview thread ](https://twitter.com/WhinfreyChris/status/1525178626563420160)\n* Distribution (table below)\n\n|Recipient Address|HOP Amount|\n| --- | --- |\n|0x945D28dF9779795BDab5BC6FDD9f36c0Ef1F7190|93,050.37|\n|0xBCCD7DF161C0d155D3E56D8C57Cc31C185217546|29,441.94|\n|0xb33e018fd80466E46Cb0d52F46eA98105E7B53ec|6,955.00|\n|0x61C1511D2645C1Fd1C5e71f07586d35779D85D79|9,715.53|\n|0x0c31Fb1f6035402d61c6B4b0a5c2B62309fF763d|14,740.59|\n|0x87122A072DaCF42bcCA5F4583fF08dEd2fb89176|13,821.37|\n|0xa52AaF7da0156d2D30a310aFe6f084a0DA9cEE54|6,724.63|\n|0x400aBc3DAE98Ec5aEEF2681b40D4CEd0A5aff934|106,850.36|\n|0x414DD753dEa0c34f83695Cea8FdD38d734E49b4E|17,335.98|\n|0xFB7c1D49e006eaDdff2385c7eF8B0C5Cf49d038A|3,406.56|\n|0x7d3f6048091aEdE6198736b8C6ac527c314e25ff|71,439.55|\n|0x0A304d8B62488766b0B4004C6398F5f439c45afa|3,096.38|\n|0x572Ae335AaC8F32DC1ac53B97Fe248C3c9B3aF77|4,397.15|\n|0x0BE6FC06A0A605D006C6317E5b0383F6Fb1394F1|51,826.21|\n|0x68C589fAb487f2F100d0380Fad9648263F2e7145|41,246.28|\n|0x386f6B908640d9f394EF37bC1b8c3a4018fa3dB1|15,515.27|\n|0x12FB89D601C674aeA4d91f92ABD30eB9bb57a95E|2,367.41|\n|0x7D389CfcD35e2aE40599b2662040A32E1450E6D6|6,392.06|\n|0x987ffC303bEa07c4aD724f2BA9800b1FDC6a7dB0|24,519.63|\n|0x6147B20E2542137055C87E6d86C8af5bF8Fb515a|4,062.73|\n|0xdaa2fAA20484ef193F4678a802cEa58750638B2A|39,163.63|\n|0xF1e4FbbC580Fc71714EfA23F352E6A70eBe46D39|16,082.46|\n|0x61bC799fD0EB6C791E1cF22E1e9908635444d5A6|48,662.07|\n|0xab41733192b401c88f3c0e42cacab44365530fba|2,894.44|\n|0xD47CB1835EB36e4A108C33E446449192426Fc160|136,043.68|\n|0x7F5F2980A85B363BD9013593A3D8b4f7DB3781Fd|3,542.76|\n|0x0fB267a11d0a4ee611a3A8Dc41147A5729276161|3,596.69|\n|0x5c43B1eD97e52d009611D89b74fA829FE4ac56b1|13,983.16|\n|0x93CbB09b82b429e0566D1ca3596515DDAeF1980A|8,816.78|\n|0x516d03de90f3Df147861E8d8001c8EDc79d89Ce7|2,859.99|\n|0x9bb82fbf10cF4959909BAB9bE07805bd1d28D04A|28,821.95|\n|0x99EdCfb867E9772384f3b560fE360d1530d6740d|7,562.27|\n|0x72153F1040BDfe6961bB73448f1AF265B2bFDf0b|7,157.50|\n|0x5E14E0c2e39ae6d65e33D21edA41796f4db86d52|17,354.19|\n|0x6a1AF72bBcfD0BA492E502F83334d3910Fa025dB|6,119.94|\n",

      "title": "[HIP-29] MAGIC Fast Bridging Support",
      "content": "Author: @Gaarp\n\nI am posting on behalf of TreasureDAO, a leading, community led gaming ecosystem on Arbitrum. Treasure and Hop Protocol have a good history of alignment, with Hop one of the primary bridging services we recommend our community members to use when bridging MAGIC to Abitrum One. We now look to extend this relationship through a pilot for fast bridging MAGIC between Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\n## Summary:\n\nThis is a proposal for Hop Protocol to offer fast bridging support for MAGIC to/from Arbitrum Nova and ETH L1.\n\nThe Treasure Council has been ratified via to commit seeding liquidity for bonders on ETH L1, Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova to facilitate the process via TIP-27 ([Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/treasuregaming.eth/proposal/0xe5a6cd031804f65bd174a061a68b8565d8e5e5113f6d3ddd06c8847226bf607e))\n\n## Rationale:\n\nTreasure is the largest NFT and gaming protocol by transactions and volume on Arbitrum One, and has been one of the most used dApps on Arbitrum since the rollup first launched.\n\nTreasure originally launched on ETH L1 in September 2021 and migrated all products / services to Arbitrum One from late 2021. Prior to the launch of Arbitrum Nova in mid 2022, there has been no meaningful reason to bridge MAGIC - Treasure’s native token - to another chain. Nova is Arbitrum’s social and gaming centric chain, which is distinct and entirely separate from Arbitrum One. We anticipate growing adoption of Nova - and games using MAGIC on Nova - as our ecosystem scales and infrastructure and tooling matures.\n\nCurrently, there exists no direct bridge from Arbitrum One to Arbitrum Nova. Users must bridge MAGIC from Abitrum One via ETH L1 to migrate. Due to the 7 day finality, users bridging from Arbitrum One would be subject to considerable delay and significant user friction. This is in conflict with our core design principles and current Arbitrum One onboarding experience where we are listed on all major CEX, have significant depth on SushiSwap and have direct fiat onramp via Moonpay.\n\nUsing Hop to quickly bridge MAGIC between Abitrum One and Arbitrum Nova via ETH L1 would greatly improve UX, and would be the only meaningful bridging solution between these chains. As such, Hop would acquire the majority of bridging volume once MAGIC enabled games go live on Arbitrum Nova. Treasure’s DAO and community is in full support of this initiative, ratifying use of MAGIC and ETH to be used in Hop’s fast bridging bonder.\n\n## Specification:\n\n* Roll out bridging support for MAGIC on Hop to/from Arbitrum Nova, L1 and Arbitrum One\n* Seed bonders on L1, Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova with 1M initial MAGIC and ETH from the Treasure Treasury and Liquidity Pools.\n  * MAGIC to be split indicatively 500k / 250k / 250k across ETH L1 / One / Nova (final split will be made closer to the point of launch based on current demand)\n* Seed MAGIC / hMAGIC LP on Hop Protocol’s StableSwap AMM on Nova and One\n* Hop Protocol provide ~12k HOP per month across the two pools as incentives to the community to seed hMAGIC<>MAGIC liquidity to bolster the 500k MAGIC injected directly from TreasureDAO\n  * The HOP incentives are designed to drive roughly $270k of additional MAGIC liquidity to the AMMs if rates normalize around 8%\n\n## Notes:\n\n*The primary ecosystem for Treasure and the MAGIC token is Arbitrum One - having been initially launched and migrated from ETH L1. Arbitrum Nova - a chain designed for social and gaming use cases - is being explored as we anticipate increasing demand for MAGIC on Nova over time. No other chain support will be requested at this time. The timing of the GTM will be aligned with relevant game / product launches\n\n*The amount of MAGIC that will be used for incentives is to be tested and increased incrementally to achieve optimal results in light of bonder liquidity utilization.",

      "title": "[HIP-28] Renewal of Hop Delegate Incentivization",
      "content": "**Authors**: @Kene_StableLab, @Bobbay_StableLab & @💩💩💩💩\n\n**References**\n1. [Original Delegate Incentivisation Trial ](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/rfc-hop-delegate-incentivization-trial/376)\n2. [Delegate Amendment ](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/hip-4-amendment-hop-delegate-incentivization-trial/559)\n\n**Simple Summary**\n\nOver the past six months, Hop DAO trialed delegate compensation to participate in Hop DAO Governance actively. This is a proposal to extend the Hop Delegate Incentivization Program\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThrough the delegate incentivisation trial over the past six months, delegates have been incentivised to actively participate in Hop DAO Governance by taking part in discussions on the forum, voting on proposals and ensuring to share their rationale for voting a particular way. This program has created a healthy culture of governance-related engagement in the Hop DAO.\n\nRenewing this Hop Delegate Incentivization trial will ensure that the quality of Hop DAO does not decline.\n\nThis Incentivisation Program will retain the delegate talent that the Hop DAO has attracted; its continued existence will allow future delegates to join the Hop DAO and allocate resources to improving the Hop Protocol.\n\n**How did the program work?**\n\nDelegates are required to vote on proposals and communicate their rationale for voting in their delegate thread on the Hop DAO Forum.\n\nUnder the current Delegate Compensation Program, delegates are compensated using a formula where delegate incentives increase with the amount of HOP delegated, but in a decreasing fashion. This means that a small delegate will receive a greater incentive per voting weight than a large delegate, but a larger delegate will receive more.\n\nDelegates utilise this [Dune Querry ](https://dune.com/queries/1672223) to ascertain their lowest level of Hop for that month and use this visualization [graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/20u1ujbx4k) to ascertain the incentives they are due according to their lowest amount of Hop for that month.\n\nFinally, delegates would self-report under a thread dedicated to reporting delegate eligibility each month. The following information would be required of a delegate.\n\n* Vote participation percent = (Number of proposals voted upon ÷ all proposals) * 100\n* Communication participation percentage = Number of proposals referenced with voting position and reasoning for that position ÷ all proposals ) * 100\n* Lowest Amount of Hop for the period\n* Incentives to be paid out.\n\n**Changes to the Program**\n\nSequel to the feedback provided in this proposal, the following changes will be implemented in this proposal.\nThere shall be a new formula used to calculate incentives.\nWhere:\nI = Incentives to be received\nh = lowest level of HOP delegated that month\nM = Multiplier based on consecutive participation periods\n\nTo calculate the multiplier (M), we can use the following formula:\n\nM = 1 + (0.1 * P)\n\nWhere:\nP = Number of consecutive completed 6-month participation periods (capped at a certain value, e.g., 5)\n\nThis multiplier starts at 1 for new delegates and increases by 0.1 for each *consecutive* completed 6-month participation period, capped at a certain value (e.g., 1.5 after five periods).\n\n* The Participation rate would be removed; therefore, new delegates who reach the 90,000 threshold could join as delegates at any time.\n* The incentive formula would be amended to include a Multiplier based on consecutive participation periods.\n\nThe primary import of these changes is that new delegates can join Hop Governance at any time, while old delegates are incentivized to continue participating.\n\nThere is no opt-in or opt-out mechanism. Delegates will have to self-report to receive compensation.\n\n**Specification**\n\nThis proposal requests for the Hop Delegate Incentivization Program to be renewed for another six months; the program will retain all the guidelines and procedures laid down by the[ original proposal ](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/rfc-hop-delegate-incentivization-trial/376) and its [subsequent amendment ](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/hip-4-amendment-hop-delegate-incentivization-trial/559).\n\nAt the time of writing this post, these are the delegates actively involved in the Hop DAO\n\n* Dybsy\n* StableLab\n* Lefterisjp\n* 💩💩💩💩\n* Francom\n* quasimatt\n* Olimpio\n* max-andrew\n* Synthetix Ambassadors\n\nWithin the past six months of this Delegate Incentivization Trial, a total of [85,129.21 ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZSlve7milPlnUDP5c9wuzlQfWsAIrYqZP4hLx-5rKek/edit#gid=0) HOP Tokens have been paid out to delegates. If this proposal passes, we are estimating that about 90,000 HOP tokens would be spent compensating delegates in the the next six months of the delegate program.\n\n**Next Steps.**\n\nIf this proposal passes, the Hop DAO Delegate Incentivization Program will continue for another six months.\n",

      "content": "Author: @max-andrew\n\n**Summary:**\nThis proposal would delegate the OP tokens Hop holds in [its Optimism community multisig](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xC988107688b750dee6237B85A3ca49ba0a65DaB0) to [the Hop Optimism ambassador multisig](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xDC01EA5b6B48187F5Aa1e422E90Dc01d03217B76). This proposal does not prevent the community multisig from spending the tokens in the way the community sees fit, and would make use of the OP holdings by augmenting the ~200K OP already delegated to Hop with the community multisig’s ~800K OP.\n\n**Rationale:**\nDelegating these funds puts the holdings to better use before they can be spent by dramatically boosting Hop’s voice in Optimism’s decision-making.\n\n**Specification:**\nThe community multisig signers delegate the holdings to the ambassador multisig address through [Optimism Agora](https://vote.optimism.io/delegate/0xDC01EA5b6B48187F5Aa1e422E90Dc01d03217B76).",

      "title": "[HIP-26] Fast Bridging Support for rETH",
      "content": "Author: @jasper-rocketpool, @dybsy\n\n***Summary*:**\n\nThis is a proposal for HOP protocol to offer fast bridging support for rETH to/from Optimism, Arbitrum, and Ethereum L1.\n\nThe Rocket Pool Incentive Committee will be offering $RPL incentives to rETH/hrETH AMM LPs on Optimism and Arbitrum to facilitate the process. We propose a starting plan of 50 $RPL / 28 day period in incentives per L2 with the intent to scale the amount as we support additional chains based on volume building across ecosystems.\n\nOne binding piece of the proposal would be if Hop Protocol were to consider matching Rocket Pool with $HOP co-incentives. We suggest 12k $HOP per 28 day period per L2. The Rocket Pool treasury is very small relative to most DAOs and partnerships are how we are able to compete. These incentives will go towards the $rETH Bonder, run by a prominent member of the Rocket Pool community.\n\n***Rationale:***\n\nThe Rocket Pool protocol produces the $rETH liquid staking token, third-largest by MCAP. The network is composed of over 2,000 node operators spread all throughout the world. This wide blanket of security means the $rETH token is incredibly decentralized and robust. The protocol is entirely permissionless to run validators on and is very aligned with the ethos of Ethereum broadly. The protocol has undergone auditing with all the top firms - Consensys Diligence, Sigma Prime, Trail of Bits, and also has a $250k Immunefi bug bounty. The token follows a cToken model, meaning the rewards passively accrue as the rETH/ETH ratio climbs. This is ideal for layer 2 adoption as the token is very simple relative to rebasing tokens.\n\nThe rETH token is already available on Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, ZkSync, and Ethereum mainnet. There is an ongoing liquidity program on Optimism that has driven 3.4k rETH to that network. A further 1.5k rETH exists naturally on Arbitrum. These networks all have rETH on them, however, it is a large challenge for the market to keep the token value balanced across all said networks. The native 1-week timelock makes this arbitrage difficult. We anticipate this arbitrage flow to expand as new liquidity programs begin on different chains.\n\nFast bridging support for rETH on Hop would be a major UX improvement for Rocket Pool users and it would also drive volume + usage for Hop Protocol. There is no other bridge that supports rETH. This would make Hop a major destination for all liquid staking token arbitrage. As the Atlas upgrade rolls out, the $rETH supply is expected to undergo massive growth from collateral reduction from 16 → 8 ETH and solo staker migration.\n\nFurther, as far as our research has shown (Celer, Synapse, HOP), if HOP onboarded rETH, *it would be the first cross-chain bridge for any liquid staking token*, potentially ushering in a brand new market that is only bound to grow. Early movers often end up taking a lion’s share of volume, and so it is in HOP’s best interest to move fast to entrench the advantage.\n\nConsidering the above, we think it would make sense for Hop protocol to co-incentivize hToken liquidity with Rocket Pool on Optimism and Arbitrum.\n\n***Specification:***\n\n** Seed bonders on L1 with rETH from the Rocket Pool Community\n** Incentivize liquidity for hrETH/rETH with 50 $RPL per 28 day cycle per L2\n** Incentivize bonder liquidity with 12k $HOP per 28 day cycle per L2\n** Roll out bridging support for rETH on Hop\n\n***Notes:***\n\n**After discussion with the HOP team, the amount of $RPL that we suggest be matched by $HOP is approximately $25,000/year/chain equivalent at time of writing.*",

      "title": "[HIP-27] Launch Hop on Polygon zkEVM Mainnet",
      "content": "```\nAuthors: Jack Melnick, Hamzah Khan. Polygon Labs \n```\n\n# Launch Hop on Polygon zkEVM Mainnet\nPoint of Contact: Hamzah Khan, TG: @khanHamzah, email: hamzah@polygon.technology\n\n## Proposal summary\nWe propose to Hop community to deploy Hop Bridge protocol to the Polygon Zero Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine rollup known as “Polygon zkEVM” on behalf of the community.\n\nWe believe this is the right moment for Hop to deploy on Polygon zkEVM, for several major reasons:\n\n* Polygon zkEVM is a new zk-rollup that provides Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence (opcode-level compatibility) for a transparent user experience and existing Ethereum ecosystem and tooling compatibility. Additionally, speed of fraud proofs allows for near instant native bridging of funds bridge (rather than waiting seven days).\n\n* An Ethereum L2 scalability solution utilizing cryptographic zero-knowledge technology to provide validation and fast finality of off-chain transaction computations.\n\n* A new set of tools and technologies were created and engineered and are contained in this organization, to address the required recreation of all EVM opcodes for transparent deployment and transactions with existing Ethereum smart contracts.\n\n* Polygon is aligned with Ethereum and its values.\n\n* Hop is already deployed on POS with good success\n\n* Hop gaining market-share through early mover advantage\n\nPolygon mainnet launch went live on March 27. Our aim is to have Hop as one of our early stage bridge partners, as we view Hop as a highly crucial product for users to bridge their assets across various chains.\n\n## Incentive rewards\nWe propose to redirect 15% of the current Polygon incentives (430k $HOP * 15% = 64.5k $HOP), and focus on ETH and USDC only. That will drive $1.5M in TVL which would be sizable relative to current bridge TVL on Polygon zkEVM. Incentive map below-\n\n###### Polygon zkEVM\n\n* ETH - 32,250\n* USDC - 32,250\n\n###### Polygon PoS\n\n* ETH - 150,500\n* USDC - 144,050\n* DAI - 30,100\n* USDT - 40,850\n\n\n## About Polygon Labs\nPolygon Labs is the leading platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development. It is rapidly building a suite of protocols that will offer developers easy access to all major scaling and infrastructure solutions:\n\nL2 solutions/rollups (Polygon zkEVM, Polygon Miden 1); and\nSidechains (Polygon PoS).\nThe Polygon PoS network is by far the most adopted scaling effort in the Ethereum ecosystem, with 3,000+ applications hosted, 1B+ transactions processed, 100M+ unique user addresses and ~$5B+ in assets secured.\n\n## Motivation\nThere’s significant value in Hop being available on an EVM equivalent ZK rollup. Deploying early on zkEVM helps solidify Hop’s place as a leading DEX and a thought leader.\n\nAdditionally, given the community and user uptake Hop has seen on Polygon PoS, it’s only natural to make its deployment on Polygon zkEVM a priority.\n\n## Partner Details\n### Polygon Labs\nThis proposal is being made by Hamzah Khan, Head of DeFi, an employee of Polygon Labs. Polygon Labs is a legal entity focused on the ecosystem growth and maintenance of the suite of Polygon networks.\n\n### Partner Legal\nThe legal entity that is supporting this proposal is Polygon Labs Services (Switzerland) AG, a Swiss corporation known as “Polygon Labs”.\n\n### Delegate Sponsor\nThere is no delegate co-authoring or sponsoring this proposal. Instead, this is a proposal submitted by Hamzah Khan of Polygon Labs to support the growth of Polygon as part of the overall Polygon community.\n\n### Conflict of Interest Declaration\nThere are no existing financial or contractual relationships between Polygon Labs and any of Sushiswap’s legal entities, including Sushiswap, SUSHI tokens, nor investments of Sushiswap.\n\n### What potential risks are there for this project’s success? How could they be mitigated?\nDeploying on zkEVM should pose minimal risks, relative to deploying on alternate blockchains. As an Ethereum Layer Two, it uses Zero Knowledge proofs to inherit Ethereum’s core safety, while allowing developers to easily deploy existing EVM codebases. The bridge has been disintermediated, and Sushiswap can expect reputable Oracle providers to be available as data providers from Day One. Polygon’s zkEVM testnet has been running for the past six months. Additionally, the deployment has been audited multiple times, by auditors including Spearbit and Hexens. Risks are outlined in detail here: Welcome to zkEVM | Polygon Wiki 1.\n\n\n\n```\nVoting Options:\n* For\n* Against\n* Abstain\n```",

      "title": "Temperature Check - How To Increase Liquidity for the HOP Token?",
      "content": "The HOP token is extremely illiquid in its current state, with liquidity fragmented across Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon and Ethereum mainnet. To make matters worse, this liquidity is scattered across several different DEX’s, including Uniswap V3, Camelot, Velodrome, Quickswap and Sushi. Even whilst using a DEX aggregator, liquidity is still too thin to buy or sell without experiencing dangerously high slippage, significant price impact, and has even resulted in users commonly becoming sandwich attack victims.\n\nCrypto protocols use several different tools to increase liquidity depth for their token holders, including: utilizing their own token emissions to reward on-chain liquidity providers, working with external HFT firms and centralized exchanges to ensure a listing of the asset, or ‘bribing’ governance token holders of prominent DEXs to vote their own emissions in the favor of the stated protocol’s token. It would be fairly easy to deepen liquidity if the HOP community were to choose a single chain in which the token was traded.\n\nThe Hop Protocol treasury currently holds 826K OP (~$1.9M) and 1.67M ARB (~$2M). If 10% of these treasury assets were redirected to HOP/WETH liquidity providers over the next 12 months, the annualized yield would be upwards of 45.8% at the current level of liquidity ($850k). While it's difficult to estimate the precise impact on notional liquidity added from this rewards program, it would likely be material. \n\nThis proposal is aimed at allowing the HOP community to choose which networks and DEX’s should be targeted and prioritized for improving HOP liquidity conditions. Below are examples of four high-level approaches that could be implemented to accomplish these goals.\n\n1. Bribe existing DEXs with OP and/or ARB to incentivize the redirection of protocol emissions towards a particular HOP LP Pool (i.e. HOP / WETH on Velodrome). This solution requires the least amount of technical development and will only require bi-weekly multi-sig transfers of either HOP, ARB or OP. \n2. Build an LP staking contract and integrate it directly on Hop’s front end. HOP LP’s of a specific pool who stake their LP tokens in this contract will be rewarded with a predetermined percentage of the ARB and/or OP mentioned above. This may require allocating ~10% of each treasury asset to maintain liquidity on both Arbitrum and Optimism, which also allows the protocol to stick to its multi-chain ethos. \n3. Working with a third-party automated liquidity management provider such as Arrakis Finance to develop HOP / ETH vaults emitting liquidity incentives in the form of OP or ARB. \n4. Creating a Nitro Pool on Camelot Exchange (Arbitrum Only), which would allow a simple distribution of any chose incentive token (likely ARB) to HOP liquidity pool participants  \n\nDeepening liquidity for the HOP token will provide a better and safer experience for HOP ecosystem participants, while also attracting new community members. Improving HOP’s liquidity should be considered a foundational requirement before any material changes to tokenomics can be implemented. \n\nThe largest risks associated with incentivizing liquidity will be related to fragmenting the core development teams time and efforts. Further, selecting a single chain or DEX may seem as if the protocol is picking favorites, especially after the Hop community received OP and ARB allocations.\n\nThe above issues could be mitigated to an extent by the provided solutions within this proposal. \n",

It will be revoked entirely and the vested HOP will be placed in a new TokenLock contract that will unlock on June 9th, 2023. The unvested HOP will be returned to Hop DAO.\n* The TokenLock contract at 0x95C6d7128dD7Bee3a3ce74A6d16A4C90e178327e does not start vesting until June 2024 and then follows a two-year linear schedule. As such, it should be revoked entirely. All HOP will be returned to Hop DAO.\n\nLito has other HOP allocations from his contributions to Hop prior to the DAO launch that have vested entirely and are not listed in this proposal.

      "content": "Author: @Kene_StableLab, @Bobbay_StableLab\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nAs the Hop DAO opens itself up to more community involvement, it has become increasingly crucial for the DAOs elected positions to have a particular voting system through which nominees are elected into these positions.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Hop DAO community must take an active role in the day-to-day decision of the DAO, this is the motivation behind this proposal to decide on the voting system to be used in Hop DAO Elections.\n\n## Scope\n\nAt this time there are primarily two positions in the Hop DAO which this voting system will apply to.\n\n* Community Multi-Sig Elections\n* The Hop DAO Ambassador Program.\n\n**NB**: This scope can be increased as the Hop DAO evolves over time.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Voting options\n2. Our recommendation\n\nThere are currently five voting system options available on Snapshot.\n\n* **Single Choice Voting**: A user may only choose one option. These votes will be represented in the results as percentages of the total number of votes that each participant cast on the particular option. Great for picking one option from a variety of options. The primary disadvantage of this system is that voters can only choose one option.\n* **Weighted Voting**: Each user can distribute their voting power across any number of options, from one to all. By increasing or reducing the voting power fraction, their voting power will be distributed among the options they have picked by the weight they give to each one. The major disadvantage of this system is it adds more complexity to the voting process.\n* **Approval Voting**: Each choice selected (and approved) by a user has equal voting power; for example, if a user selects two options, both will receive the user’s entire voting power. This voting system allows for approval and does not allow voters to quantify their approval in percentages or varying degrees.\n* **Quadratic Voting**: Each user can cast as many votes as desired. Due to the quadratically calculated outcomes, the number of individual voters matters more than the total amount of provided voting power. The power of the whales in this voting system is diluted in favour of smaller holders. The significance of individuals will outweigh the number of tokens. However, this voting type requires a Sybil-resistance method to stop whales from distributing governance power between several wallets.\n* **Ranked Choice Voting**: Each user must order their rankings of the options. For each voter’s top pick, votes are tallied in the first phase. A choice wins if it earns more than 50% of the votes, which are cast on the users’ top selections. The outcome will display the percentages reflecting users only voted for their top option. This voting system particularly favours options with the most vital support; however, this voting system only produces one winner and is complex to understand and implement.\n\n**Our recommendation**\n\nWe recommend weighted voting because, although it adds a bit of complexity to the process, voters can quantify their support in percentages for various candidates of their choosing. A voter could give 100% of their vote to a person or split their votes between four candidates by voting 25% each. Giving voters flexibility in deciding who is elected to specific positions would be a valuable approach to running our elections.\n\nThis voting system allows for the selection of multiple candidates, which is ideal for Hop DAOs elections.\n\n## Disclosure\n\nAny of StableLab’s proposals, comments or electronic communications can not be used to create any legally binding contract or enforceable obligation in the absence of a fully signed written contract between StableLab and any third party.\n\nThis message may contain forward-looking statements about Hop DAO, its protocol, business plan, and strategy.

      "title": "[HIP-23] - Proposal to deploy HOP on Scroll zkEVM",
      "content": "```\nAuthor: Robert Chang\n```\n### Summary\nDear Hop Community, I’m Robert from the Partnerships team at Scroll and we’re reaching out to propose the deployment of the Hop Bridge on Scroll.\n\nScroll is live on Pre-Alpha Testnet and will launch on Goerli this month, and mainnet in Q3. The aim here is to have Hop be one of our early stage launch partners on Goerli as we view Hop as a highly crucial product for users to bridge their assets across various chains.\n\n### Goals\nWe propose for HopProtocol to deploy on Scroll for Goerli launch, and eventually support bridging between Scroll and other chains across the Ethereum ecosystem for Mainnet in Q3 this year.\n\nOn our side, we aim to support Hop’s expansion across the hundreds of dApps within our ecosystem as we believe direct dApp<>Bridge integrations will allow for improvements in on-chain user experience.\n\n### About Scroll\nScroll is an L2 Scaling Solution that is pushing the development of an Ethereum equivalent zkEVM. Our main priorities are to implement a bytecode-level compatible zkEVM with sound zk proofs, work on related initiatives to coordinate the development of layer 1 and zkEVM, and reach a community standard to improve Ethereum for the end game. Security is of highest priority for us and our current EVM implementation is well specified and robust. Our in-house security team also operates in close conjunction with the highest caliber auditors in the industry.\n\nScroll is built on a completely open source basis. This includes the ZK circuits, the proving system, and the verifier smart contract. Code security is also closely monitored by community developers from projects such as Zcash, 0xPARC, Ethereum Foundation, and Filecoin.\n\nToday, Scroll is currently live on Pre-Alpha Testnet and contracts can be deployed permissionlessly by anyone and anywhere. We maintain a trustless Layer 1 <> Layer 2 bridge which supports arbitrary message delivery. The bridge is part of the rollup mechanism, verified by the smart contract and the zkEVM, which is more secure than classical relayer-based bridges.\n\n### Helpful Links\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/Scroll_ZKP](https://twitter.com/Scroll_ZKP)\nForum: [https://community.scroll.io/](https://community.scroll.io/)\n\n```\nVoting Options:\n* For\n* Against\n* Abstain\n```",

      "title": "[HIP-22] Reopen HOP airdrop claim window",
      "content": "Authors: @max-andrew\nStatus: Snapshot-only vote\nDate Posted: 2023-02-19\n\n**Summary:**\nThis proposal would create a new 60 day window for early Discord and Twitter users to submit claims for the airdrop. [The possibility of this extension is included in the original specifications of the airdrop.](https://hop.mirror.xyz/AI5fOUR0X_l0mktShDOx3mwr-hsB24gp8GvTWtS-MBc) This proposal would similarly include those who missed the Authereum claim window.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThis proposal would include those who already qualified for the airdrop but were unable to submit their address before the deadline. This token distribution has already been accounted for and would entail minimal labor cost. Importantly, it would demonstrate Hop to be a DAO that is flexible and supports the users that support it.\n\n**Specification:**\n* Reopen a 60 day claim period for early Discord, Twitter, and Authereum users who have already qualified for the airdrop\n* Window will be reopened following a successful vote and two actions by the Hop team\n\t* An update to pre-existing forms (https://app.hop.exchange/#/airdrop/social-verify, https://app.hop.exchange/#/airdrop/authereum) to allow new submissions\n\t* An announcement made through social media to notify users of the reopening\n* A delegate volunteer will privately validate the addresses submitted\n* A list of valid addresses will be sent to the multisig for transfers to be processed using funds already allocated to it that will be reimbursed through the standard refill process\n* Airdrop amounts will be calculated using the pre-existing formula\n* The new airdrop will be sent within 14 days following the end of the 60-day period\n* This proposal does not reclaim any HOP that might still remain to the treasury and does not rule out the possibility for reopening the reclaim window through future governance actions\n",

      "title": "[HIP-21] Hop DAO Ambassador Program",
      "content": "Authors: @Kene_StableLab @Bobbay_StableLab @max-andrew and @francom \n\nContributors: N/A\nStatus: Snapshot-only vote\nDate Posted: 2023-02-16\n\n**References**\n\nhttps://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-241/\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to introduce a Hop Ambassador Program; Hop DAO Ambassadors would participate in DAO Governance across the ecosystem on behalf of the Hop Protocol; these ambassadors would also pursue partnership and integration opportunities within other DAO Communities; this proposal lays down the operational aspects of how this ambassador program would function on behalf of the Hop Protocol.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Hop Protocol plays a vital role in the ecosystem through its bridging Infrastructure. It has become imperative that Hop Protocol is represented in some strategic DAOs across the ecosystem. Through this ambassador program, members of the Hop Community with the highest context in the selected DAOs can represent the Hop Protocol in these DAOs, ultimately creating value for the Hop Protocol.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Eligibility\n\nAny member of the Hop DAO Community is eligible to become a Hop DAO Ambassador. However, such an individual must show that they are an active community member in the particular DAO they wish to represent the Hop DAO in.\n\n### How many Ambassadors will the Hop DAO select?\nFor the initial pilot program, the Hop DAO will have three ambassadors who will represent the Hop DAO in Optimism which the Hop DAO already has delegated governance power.\n\nWe suggest starting with three ambassadors since there seems to be a fair amount of interest here. This provides an unequal number, helping to combat any deadlock decisions that may occur in optimism governance votes.\n\nFor the other communities, this presents an opportunity for Hop DAO to establish itself in other communities.\n\n### Nomination and Elections\n\nHop DAO Ambassadors will serve for one year, after which the role becomes vacant. After a year, eligible individuals are welcome to nominate themselves and subsequently become elected to the role.\n\nAt the expiration of the one-year term, a forum thread shall be opened by one member of the outgoing Hop DAO Ambassadors; then prospective Ambassadors would nominate themselves under the thread; the nomination post shall contain the following information:\n\n1. Details about the DAO they wish to represent the Hop DAO in.\n2. The value that Hop DAO could derive from participating in the DAO\n3. What makes the prospective Ambassador the best fit for the role;\n\nAfter one week, the thread shall stop accepting nominations, and the nominees shall be posted on Snapshot for the community to elect three Ambassadors to represent the DAO\n\nPrevious Ambassadors shall remain eligible to hold the position again by following the nomination and election process.\n\n### Duties of a Hop DAO Ambassador\n\nThese ambassadors would be responsible for the following:\n\n1. Governance Participation through Voting and Proposal Writing: Ambassadors will participate in governance by voting on proposals, communicating their rationale, and writing proposals.\n2. Seeking Business Development Opportunities through Integrations: An ambassador could potentially broker a discussion in another DAO that would lead to an asset being added to the Hop Protocol’s list of supported assets; an example would be rETH getting listed as a supported asset on the Hop Protocol.\n3. Increasing Hop Protocol’s Governance Power in selected Protocols: An Ambassador would start out as a delegate in a protocol and, over time, increase their governance power on behalf of the Hop DAO.\n4. Attending Community Calls of the Selected DAOs, and also attending the Hop DAOs’ community call: Forming a strong tie with a DAOs community is an important aspect of participation. Ambassadors must attend the DAOs community call and also attend the Hop Community call. This way, they have an opportunity to provide feedback to the community that they represent.\n\n### Compensation\nHop Ambassadors will receive Vested HOP every 6 months, to keep the Ambassadors aligned with Hop DAO.\nThis means an ambassador will receive $3,000 every 6 months as a lump sum, rather than on a monthly basis. If an ambassador is removed before their term reaches 6 months, they will not be compensated for their work.\n\n**Program Cost**\n\nIn its current state, if we have three ambassadors for Optimism, that will cost the DAO $18,000 annually.\n\n$500 x 3 x 12 Months = $18,000\n\n\n\n### Removing an ambassador\n\nAny member of the community who believes that an Ambassador does not well represent the Hop DAO will have the right to put up a proposal requesting that the Ambassador be removed and immediately replaced.\n\nThis forum post must contain proof of neglect of assigned duties or proof of improper actions which could misrepresent the Hop DAO; these actions or inactions must also be directly related to the duties assigned to the ambassador by this proposal.\n\nThese actions could be a failure to; vote, communicate rationale or attend community calls.\n\n### Delegate Thread\n\nEach Ambassador shall maintain a delegate thread on the Hop forum for the DAO the ambassador participates in on behalf of Hop DAO. The thread shall contain the ambassador's votes and the decision and rationale for every vote.\n\nI.e.\n\nVote: [Yes/No/Abstain/Missed]\n\nRationale:\n\n### Quarterly Report\n\nEvery quarter, each ambassador shall post a Quarterly Report of its activities within the quarter. This report will include the following:\n\n* Hop Protocol’s Governance Power (Changes)\n* Number of votes done by the ambassador (including any missed vote)\n* Proposals are written by the ambassador\n* Progress of business development opportunities.\n\n### Selected DAOs for the Pilot\n\nTo kick off the Pilot Phase of the Hop DAO Ambassador Program’s operations, we propose starting with:\n\n* Optimism: Because OP Governance Power has been delegated to the Hop DAO, and the fundamental role that Hop Protocol plays in the ecosystem, participating in OP Governance is an essential first step for the ambassador.\n\nNote: The community shall select the other two DAOs depending on the Ambassadors they choose to elect.\n\n**Review**\n\nIf this proposal is successful, we suggest that we do a DAO-wide review in 6 months to evaluate this pilot program before moving forward.\n\n\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Hop DAO occupies a very important role in the ecosystem. The Hop Protocol has many stakeholders across the ecosystem. As we build out the Hop Protocol Roadmap, our increased participation in the ecosystem will be vital in establishing key partnerships and identifying opportunities for possible integrations. These efforts to participate in governance and pursue partnership opportunities across the ecosystem will ultimately compound into value for the Hop DAO.\n",

These distributions have been made to [delegates](https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth/proposal/bafkreic3hu4fhna7lfyecwvvasfqccygzhpkvw2zu4mihzglccwa5om6ii), [multisig signers](https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth/proposal/0x15937d80591ed226743226721d236e8c9190461521c866f18a45cb9703773a22), [bonders](https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth/proposal/bafkreicliwx2wt4rnjbappi4yyk4z2qrh224guatw7z3uo3wwh7ruekeee), and [AMM reward contracts](https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth/proposal/bafkreicliwx2wt4rnjbappi4yyk4z2qrh224guatw7z3uo3wwh7ruekeee) (in the form of liquidity incentives).\n\nThe multisig initially received [20,000,000 HOP](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa2bbae45a9a184e4555c72faa8ac2b75380511b32a2880945adb0c0362473f1b) during the creation of the tokens and many of these have been distributed into circulation. The complete breakdown of the distributions to date are below:\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/g3K0zIc.png)\n\nThe HOP Community Multisig now has 6,157,401.72 HOP tokens available, or about 2 months of supply. At the current run rate, approximately 2,941,299.13 HOP is distributed each month, which equates to approximately 3.53% of the total HOP supply each year.\n\nThis RFC hopes to achieve consensus that the HOP Community Multisig should be refilled at this time in order to continue efficient distributions from the HOP DAO into the hands of HOP stakeholders.\n\n### Actions\n\nIf consensus is achieved, this proposal will send 11,765,196.52 HOP from the HOP DAO to the HOP Community Multisig. This number represents roughly 4 months of distribution and approximately 1.16% of the total HOP supply, capping the liabilities of the HOP Community Multisig.\n\nPer [HIP-15](https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth/proposal/0x6b5136469fd7b1478c0e10b95e30e8645a1cea8bb49cabeed59a312264b518f0), this distribution, as well as future distributions to refill the multisig, will target approximately 4 months worth of DAO expenses, refilled via on-chain governance vote every other month.\n\nThe calculation of 11,765,196.52 HOP was achieved by looking at the cumulative distribution of the prior two months and using that to approximate the next 4 months’ expenses. Any major, forward-looking changes, such as newly accepted & forthcoming distributions or the ending of incentive programs, should be taken into consideration when calculating this number for future refills.\n\nShould the RFC be widely accepted, a delegate will conduct a temperature check on Snapshot and a subsequent on-chain proposal. If there are no material changes to the structure, future refills of this nature will bypass an RFC and proceed directly to a Snapshot vote.\n\nThe [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth/proposal/0x3e81e9581f48b150787a5160c3dfc65d4947ff4206e6cdca053d16da0bc60a77) has passed, and now the proposal moves to a Tally vote to be executed on-chain. \n\n```\nVoting Options:\n* Yes\n* No\n* Abstain\n```\n \n",

      "content": "Authors: @Kene_StableNode, @Bobbay_StableLab & 💩💩💩💩\nContributors: N/A\nStatus: HIP (Snapshot-only vote)\n\n**References**\n\n[How Should HOP compensate Multi-Sig Signers](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/request-for-comment-how-should-hop-compensate-multi-sig-signers/525)\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis is a request for comment to finalize the discussion of Hop’s Multi-Sig Operations. This a follow-up proposal to the “[Temperature Check - How should HOP compensate Multi-Sig Signers](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/temperature-check-how-should-hop-compensate-multi-sig-signers/541)” proposal, which has already been passed off-chain and on-chain by the community.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal outlines the process for nomination, election, and compensation of multisig signers for the Hop DAO Community Multisig. The proposal aims to define the multisig’s goals and clarify the process for joining and participating in the Hop DAO multisig.\n\n### Nomination and Election\n\nEvery six months, there will be a nomination process and subsequent election to replace the five Hop DAO Community Multisig signers. Stats should be kept about the incumbent signer’s number and speed of signatures in the 6-month period and displayed during elections. A forum post should be started where applicants indicate their interest in the role through a formal application stating:\n\n* Who they are\n* Outlining their track record of reliability in previous roles\n* How they contribute to the Hop Ecosystem\n\nThe nomination process should run for seven days with question and answer, after which a subsequent snapshot election will be held; after the election, the top 5 applicants will become the new Hop Multi-Sig Signers.\n\n### Responsibilities\n\nThe Community Multisig exists for the Hop DAO to transact faster and with more flexibility than can the full governance timelock. However, the multisig’s purpose should be to reduce its role in the DAO as much as possible.\n\n* Each signer will be responsible for verifying transactions, checking merkle roots, and signing off on transactions as necessary.\n* The signers will work together to manage the nomination and election process, with each signer taking on specific tasks to ensure that the process runs smoothly.\n* The signers will also work together to manage the day-to-day operations of the multisig, including responding to questions from the community and ensuring that transactions are executed in a timely and efficient manner.\n\n### Compensation:\nSalary: As an amendment to [HIP-12](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hop/proposal/107872944286812659673185380342942146780173919264744172884383470916013422262449), Multi-Sig Signer compensation will be $2,250 twice a year for = $4,500 * 4 = $18,000\n\nBringing the total cost to = $18,000\n\nGas Rebates: As ETH is spent to execute multisig transactions, we propose that each signer is reimbursed for the exact amount of gas spent during the 6-month term. To be eligible for a rebate, we propose that signers use a Google Sheet template to track gas costs. A dune dashboard or other data query can replace this. We further propose that gas rebates (but not full compensation), where reasonable, are extended to all Hop related multisigs (e.g. Grants Program multisig).",

This proposal requests sUSD fast bridging support between Optimism and ETH mainnet from the HOP protocol. The Synthetix Treasury Council intends to incentivize sUSD/hsUSD LPs with 5,000 $OP monthly by reallocating from SNX pool and requests a matching co-incentive from the HOP Protocol by moving 50,000 $HOP from SNX pool. The aim is to drive more utility for sUSD and facilitate onboarding new/existing users into/to the Synthetix ecosystem.\n\nSpecification :\n\nRoll out bridging support for sUSD on Hop.\nIncentivize liquidity for hsUSD/sUSD with 5000 $OP which will be moved from SNX pool.\nMatching co-incentive by moving 50,000$HOP from SNX pool.",

Any major, forward-looking changes, such as newly accepted & forthcoming distributions or the ending of incentive programs, should be taken into consideration when calculating this number for future refills.\n\nShould the RFC be widely accepted, a delegate will conduct a temperature check on Snapshot and a subsequent on-chain proposal. If there are no material changes to the structure, future refills of this nature will bypass an RFC and proceed directly to a Snapshot vote.\n\n```\nVoting Options:\n* Yes\n* No\n* Abstain\n```\n \n",

      "title": "[HIP-17] Deploy Hop bridge functionality on the ConsenSys zkEVM rollup",
      "content": "```\nAuthor: Cameron O’Donnell\nEmail: Governance@Consensys.net\nTelegram: @DAOstrat\n```\n\n## Intro\ngm Hop community! Cameron here on behalf of ConsenSys. We are proud to engage with such an active community.\n\nMost people know ConsenSys for Metamask, Infura, and Truffle, but we’re here to talk about something else: a zkEVM Rollup. We recently launched the [Testnet](https://consensys.net/blog/news/consensys-launches-private-beta-zkevm-testnet-to-scale-ethereum/) (open only for allowlist users) and are reaching out to propose deploying Hop for the ConsenSys zkEVM Testnet and subsequent Mainnet.\n\nConsenSys follows the progression of the Hop ecosystem closely and even recently integrated Hop into our [bridging aggregator](https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/consensys-announces-the-beta-release-of-metamask-bridges-in-the-portfolio-dapp/). Hop is a unique and critical piece of infrastructure that seamlessly bridges assets between chains.\n\n## Proposal Details\n### Proposal\nThis proposal asks the Hop community to support bridging using the protocol between the ConsenSys zkEVM and other chains in the Ethereum ecosystem. Specifically, this will integrate various protocol features with the trustless ConsenSys zkEVM token bridge. This will help provide sufficient bridging liquidity for future Testnet users. (330K signups as of today)\n\nConsenSys team members are in contact with Authereum (DBA Hop Labs) and are excited to work on this together.\n\n### Motivation\nWhat is particularly exciting about the ConsenSys zkEVM is that it is a type 2 zkEVM. As a result, it is EVM equivalent, meaning existing smart contracts, toolsets, and release processes can be easily deployed without substantial modifications. This means de minimis switching costs for dApp developers.\n\nDuring the Testnet phases and Mainnet, we expect a robust user base that will drive activity to the Hop protocol (and community) as demand for bridging increases. Also, the protocol will be the first to integrate with the native zkEVM bridge, which is a significant opportunity for the Hop ecosystem.\n\n### Bridge Deployments\nBridges play a key role in Layer 2 Rollups; we look at it as one of the central pillars of the tech stack. Currently, we are running a native trustless messaging and token bridge used for ERC20s from Layer 1. In addition, as strong supporters of Hop, We forked the Hop frontend and adopted it for this first phase of the zkEVM Testnet.\n\nBridges and related contracts are deployed and managed by the core protocol dev team with support from ConsenSys. Authereum is aware of the considerations and excited to work with us on the ConsenSys zkEVM.\n\n## The ConsenSys zkEVM\n### Type 2 zkEVM\nThe ConsenSys zkEVM handles native EVM bytecode for proving and verification to allow the execution of Solidity smart contracts and enable developers to build on a zk-rollup while using familiar tools and infrastructure. The ConsenSys zkEVM aims to be a Type 2 zkEVM and achieve EVM-equivalence with the Ethereum VM specification specified in the yellow paper. Unlike other rollups, the Consensys zkEVM does not use transpilers or custom compilers to generate the zkProofs. By taking the compiled bytecode directly from solidity, we significantly reduce the surface area risk for bugs and hacks.\n\n## Timeline/Next Steps\nThe Request For Comment was posted in the Forums on January 19, 2023.\nThe proposal is now posted in Snapshot.\nOnce these steps are completed, we will team up with a Delegate to post the On-chain proposal.\n\n## Conclusion\nConsensys looks forward to strengthening our partnership with Hop through direct integrations. Supporting bridging to and from the ConsenSys zkEVM will allow for a seamless user experience and drive growth for the Hop ecosystem. We look forward to the discussion below!",

      "title": "[HIP-16] Fees and a Commitment to Public Goods Funding",
      "content": "```\nAuthor: Chris Whinfrey\nStatus: Snapshot-only HIP \n```\n\nThere have been several conversations among community members regarding introducing protocol fees for Hop. Currently, fees go solely toward paying supply-side participants such as AMM LPs and Bonders. There have been $7m total fees collected to date!\n\nEven a small protocol fee would provide significant funding to help cover general DAO expenses such as development costs, grant programs, foundation costs, and more. With the development of Hop v2, we have the opportunity to introduce a **Protocol Fee Switch** to each module (messaging, token bridge, nft bridge, etc.) to help cover general costs in the DAO.\n\nThe introduction of a **Protocol Fee Switch** also gives us the opportunity to enshrine a commitment to public goods funding directly into the protocol. It’s important to remember that Hop is built on the shoulders of giants. We wouldn’t be here today if it weren’t for Ethereum and the many other public goods that exist because of the Ethereum community. Diverting a portion of fees would allow Hop to give back to the Ethereum community and the broader world perpetually through public goods funding.\n\n### Proposal\nA protocol fee switch should be added to each Hop module produced by Hop DAO. In addition, a minimum of 10% of fees collected by the DAO from each module should be diverted to public goods funding outside of the immediate Hop ecosystem.\n\n### Execution\nAll protocol fees will be initialized in an off position. The protocol fee can only be set by a direct on-chain vote after the full governance process.\n\nThe minimum public goods funding percentage can be enshrined directly into each fee collection mechanism. Once enshrined, Hop DAO will be able to control which address receives the funding (e.g. a Public Goods Grants Committee) but will not be able to lower the public goods funding percentage below the minimum. When the DAO sweeps fees from the module, the public goods portion will be automatically diverted.\n\nThese funds are intended for public goods that benefit the broader Ethereum community or world and not for public goods directly within the Hop ecosystem. Grants within the Hop ecosystem are better served by the currently proposed grant program or something similar.\n\n### Acceptance\nBecause this proposal has no immediate on-chain action, it will be considered accepted after a passing Snapshot vote.\n\n```\nVoting Options:\n* Yes\n* No\n* Abstain\n```\n \n    ",

      "title": "[HIP-14] Hop Protocol Roadmap",
      "content": "```\nAuthor: Chris Whinfrey\nStatus: Snapshot-only HIP \n```\n\nWe propose a new protocol roadmap to modularize the Hop stack into simple, trustless primitives for building cross-chain applications.\n\nThe current version of Hop has proven out Hop’s underlying cross-chain infrastructure. This next phase opens it up for an ecosystem to be built on top.\n\nModules will enable cross-chain functionality such as:\n\n    Messaging\n    Token transfers\n    NFT transfers\n    Omnichain tokens\n    And more :sparkles:\n\n### Core Messenger\n\nThe Hop Core Messenger allows anyone to leverage efficient, trustless cross-chain messaging in their application. This simple but powerful primitive underpins the rest of the Hop stack.\n\nWe’re excited to say the Hop Core Messenger is live on the Goerli testnet [here](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xE3F4c0B210E7008ff5DE92ead0c5F6A5311C4FDC)! If you want to learn more, you can get started [here](https://github.com/hop-protocol/contracts-v2/tree/master/packages/messenger).\n\n### Token Bridge\n\nThe Hop Token Bridge will introduce a decentralized network of active liquidity providers standing ready to complete cross-chain transfers. Improvements in both capital efficiency and gas efficiency will significantly reduce bridge costs and improve liquidity when compared with Hop v1.\n\n### NFT Bridge\n\nThe Hop NFT Bridge will allow users to move NFTs across any supported network as easily as bridging a token. The design, [originally proposed by Vitalik](https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-rollup-nft-wrapper-and-migration-ideas/10507), allows NFT transfers to be verified immediately off-chain and settled later on-chain. The simplicity, cost effectiveness, and trustless nature of the Hop Core Messenger makes it an ideal settlement layer for a secure NFT bridge.\n\n### Omnichain Tokens\n\nOmnichain tokens such as $HOP making transfers across networks cheap and efficient. Hop Omnichain Tokens will make it simple to launch tokens with bridging and cross-chain governance functionality built in.\n\n### More\n\nThis is just the start of what can be built on top of a trustless cross-chain messaging layer. Cross-chain DEXs, lending, governance, and much more are research areas that are just beginning to be explored.\n\n### Timeline\n\nWhile the code for the Hop Core Messenger is near complete and the first cross-chain use cases can go live shortly, Authereum Labs is targeting completion of all 4 initial primitives and supporting software before the end of Q3 of 2023. Should this roadmap be accepted, more in depth write ups and documentation on each module will be released as they are developed.\n\n### Acceptance\n\nAfter the request for comment period and any necessary adjustments are made, the roadmap will be put to a snapshot vote. A passing snapshot vote will constitute this roadmap accepted.\n\n```\nVoting Options:\n* Yes\n* No\n* Abstain\n```",

      "title": "[HIP-15] Engage Authereum Labs as Service Provider",
      "content": "```\nAuthor: Chris Whinfrey\nStatus: Snapshot-only HIP \n```\n\nSince the launch of Hop DAO, the role of Authereum Labs (DBA Hop Labs pending) has changed significantly. Hop DAO is now fully operational and Authereum Labs is one of multiple contributors working towards Hop DAO’s shared mission.\n\nIn this vein, Authereum Labs hopes to establish a formal service provider relationship with Hop DAO along with an accompanying budget for operations. Should the budget be accepted, the scope of services can be adjusted at any point via the full Hop governance process.\n\n### Scope of Services\n* Research and development of the Hop Protocol roadmap as directed by Hop DAO.\n* Day-to-day operation, development, and improvement of the Hop frontend currently hosted at hop.exchange.\n* Open ended research related to trustless cross-chain infrastructure and other technologies that may be relevant to Hop.\n\n### Budget\nA budget of $115,000/month ($1.38m/year) will cover Authereum Labs’s costs for providing these services and allow Authereum Labs to bring on two additional team members to help with the workload.\n\nWhile costs vary month to month, this a rough breakdown of expected costs:\n\n\n|  **Item**   |      **Cost (monthly)** |\n|----------|:-------------:|\n| Employee expenses |  $80,000 |\n| Office |   $4,000   |\n| Legal | $6,000 |\n| Software and web services\t | $10,000 |\n| Security Audits | $12,000 |\n| Miscellaneous | $3,000 |\n| Total | $115,000 |\n\n\n### Accountability\nAuthereum Labs will provide quarterly written updates for Hop DAO detailing our contributions over the previous quarter as well as providing guidance around upcoming deliverables, potential blockers, or unknowns. We will also provide more granular updates and make ourselves available for questions and feedback on Hop Community Calls currently run at a biweekly cadence. Lastly, we will continue to solicit feedback and buy-in from the DAO for changes or new developments in the product roadmap.\n\nWe reserve the right to manage our internal structure and costs within the budget granted by Hop DAO but want to provide transparency into these decisions while respecting individual privacy. We also reserve the right to conduct open-ended research that can be presented to the DAO as a possible future direction for the protocol as we have done with the Hop Core Messenger and v2 roadmap.\n\n### Execution\nShould this proposal be accepted via the full governance process, the Hop Foundation will be empowered to enter into a standard service provider agreement (SPA) with Authereum Labs on behalf of Hop DAO. In addition to the payment terms above, the SPA would provide for customary mutual indemnity clauses, and all intellectual property developed under the SPA would belong to Hop DAO.\n\nMonthly payments should be made in stablecoins at the end of each month starting with January. Should Hop DAO not have stablecoins, payment can be defered until they are available for use in payment. All payments should be made from the Community Multisig when possible. The Community Multisig should hold approximately 4 months of expenses, refilled via on-chain governance vote every other month.\n\n\n```\nVoting Options:\n* Yes\n* No\n* Abstain\n```\n ",

      "title": "[HIP 13] - Updating Voting Frameworks for Community Governance ",
      "content": "Author(s):\n💩💩💩💩\n\nStatus: Snapshot-only HIP\n\nThe Hop DAO [Community Governance Process](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/community-governance-process/130) currently relies on a combination of Snapshot temperature checks and on-chain voting for multisig execution and/or on-chain voting for decision-making. However, there is a need to update and clarify this process to better reflect the needs of the community and ensure that all decisions are made in a transparent and fair manner, while balancing efficiency and responsiveness in decision-making. To that end, we propose the creation of a modified voting framework that will allow for more flexibility and responsiveness in decision-making.\n\n**1) No vote nor HIP needed.** The Community Multisig can execute autonomously if small values are involved/transferred (less than $5,000) and does not directly benefit any person/entity outside of the Hop DAO itself.\n           \n       Examples:\n        - Claiming an airdrop (value of airdrop claim is <$5,000 market value)\n\n**2) Snapshot-only HIP.** A simple snapshot vote (via [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth)) will be sufficient for decisions involving larger values (greater than $5,000) from the multisig or for decisions that do not impact the core Hop Protocol. This will allow the community to have a say in decisions that could have a significant impact on the Hop DAO, but will not require the full on-chain voting process which can be time consuming and resource intensive.\n                   \n       Examples:\n         - Directing community multisig's veNFT to a new Velodrome pool (market value of veNFT is ~$40,000, calculated as 2M VELO @ $.02)\n         - This proposal modifying the Community Governance Process (no changes to core protocol)\n\n**3) Fully on-chain HIP.** A fully on-chain vote (via [tally.xyz](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/eip155:1:0xed8Bdb5895B8B7f9Fdb3C087628FD8410E853D48)) is only needed if executable code is attached to the vote or if changes are being made to the core Hop Protocol. These decisions are of the highest importance and will require the full transparency and participation of the community to ensure that they are made in the best interests of the Hop DAO. HIPs which fall into the category of a fully on-chain vote would also still require Snapshot temperature checks as currently outlined in the governance process.\n\n       Examples:\n         - Funding new multisig for grants program (requires on-chain transfer of $HOP via executable code)\n         - Deploying Hop Bridge to new chain (change to core Hop Protocol)\n\nThis HIP is the first to be governed by its own proposal and would also fall into category 2 for which only a Snapshot vote is necessary. This effectively replaces the current temperature check phase of the existing governance process. For proposals in category 3, however, a temperature check on Snapshot would still be needed before a fully on-chain vote.",

      "title": "HIP 4 Amendment: Hop Delegate Incentivization Trial",
      "content": "```\nTitle: HIP 4 Amendment: Hop Delegate Incentivization Trial\nAuthor(s): GFX Labs (@gfxlabs)\nContributors:\nStatus: RFC\nDate Posted: 2022-12-17\n```\n\n## Motivation\n\nAn edge case has been identified in how delegates self-report their participation under this trial. When a poll is open during two different reporting periods, it leads to confusion on whether that poll should be first counted for delegate compensation purposes. There has also been interest from delegates in a linear penalty vs a cliff for compensation.\n\n## Summary of Amendments\n\n1. Clarification that a poll is only counted for participation once that poll has closed (in the “Reporting & Administration” section).\n2. Removal of the preamble that is no longer relevant (prior the “Motivation” section).\n3. Inserted a link to a Dune query to help delegates calculate their HOP for a period; removed language stating that a query would be made after HIP 4 was approved (in the “Reporting & Administration” section).\n4. Added the exact date the delegation trial will sunset now that date is known (in the “Sunset” section).\n5. Lowered the threshold for minimum participation for delegates to be eligible from 90% to 70% on both voting and communication (in the “Eligibility” section). Added a penalty to delegates with participation or communication of at least 70% but less than 90% (in the “Specifications & Incentives Paid” section).\n\n## New Text For HIP 4 In Full (Additions In Bold; Removals In Strike Marks):\n\n~~This is a request for comment (RFC),[ in line with current Hop governance processes](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/community-governance-process/130), intended to provide a place for comment and feedback to be incorporated before moving it to a temperature check and requesting a sponsor to create a formal Hop Proposal.~~ \n\n~~As per the instructions in Phase I (RFC), the question posed is: “Should Hop governance incentivize participation by delegates under this trial program?”~~\n\n~~GFX Labs, Flipside Crypto, and Franco Macklis are all under the 1 million HOP threshold to initiate a formal vote if the temperature check is successful.~~\n\n## Motivation\n\nHop’s governance is new, with a need to decentralize control and oversight of the protocol. This trial program aims to attract and retain both entities and individuals who will actively participate in governance on behalf of HOP token-holders.\n\n## Sunset\n\nThis program is intended to be a temporary trial and will end after 6 months unless it is extended through a governance vote, **which is March 10, 2023**.\n\n## Eligibility\n\nMinimum Participation Requirement: To remain eligible for delegate incentives, a delegate must maintain at least a ~~90%~~ **70%** participation rate. Participation is measured as voting in any “temperature check” or on-chain governance vote.\n\nMinimum Communication Requirement: To remain eligible for delegate incentives, a delegate must maintain at least a ~~90%~~ **70%** communication rate. Participation is measured as providing for any “temperature check” or on-chain governance vote a summary, voting position, and justification for that position. A missed vote will still require communication to avoid a lower communication rate.\n\nMeasurement Period: Both minimum requirements will be measured on a 6-month basis, which is also the intended length of this trial. If this program is renewed, participation and communication requirements will continue to be measured on a rolling 6-month (182-day) basis.\n\nMinimum Delegation Threshold: To remain eligible for delegate incentives, a delegate must maintain at least 90,000 HOP voting weight.\n\n## Specifications For Incentives Paid\n\nDelegate incentives increase with the amount of HOP delegated, but in a decreasing fashion. This means that a small delegate will receive a greater incentive per voting weight than a large delegate, but a larger delegate will receive more.\n\nThe formula for delegate incentives is:\n\nI = (log(h)-4.55)*3500\n\nI = Incentives to be received\n\nh = lowest level of HOP delegated that month\n\n**If the lower of a delegate’s communication or participation metrics are at least 70%, but less than 90%, a penalty is applied to compensation.**\n\n**The formula for the penalty is:**\n\n**c = (.9 - p) * 3**\n\n**c = Penalty to incentives, expressed as a percentage**\n\n**p = min(participation, communication)**\n\n**Example: A delegate has 82% participation and 100% communication. They would have been eligible for 100 HOP in compensation. Because their participation was only 82%, a penalty of 24% is applied. A 24% penalty would reduce the 100 HOP compensation to 76 HOP.**\n\nThis formula targets ~1400 HOP for a delegate at the minimum threshold. At the time of writing, 20 delegates qualify for the minimum eligibility threshold.\n\nFor reference, a few benchmarks:\n\n* a delegate holding all 1 billion HOP would receive 12,075 HOP per month.\n* 10 million HOP, a delegate would receive 8,575 HOP per month.\n* 1 million HOP, a delegate would receive 5,075 HOP per month.\n* 100,000 HOP, a delegate would receive 1,575 HOP per month.\n\nThis formula’s slope was chosen to provide the targeted levels of minimum and maximum compensation and is open to revision at the close of this trial. In general, it was selected to provide a slower accumulation of incentives for larger delegates than smaller ones, while preserving a noticeable increase at all levels (under the maximum cap) for any delegate that can attract more delegated HOP votes.\n\n[This link provides a graph and visualization for those interested.](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/20u1ujbx4k)\n\n## Reporting & Administration\n\nDelegate compensation will be paid directly to delegate addresses (or their assigned alternative address) by the Community Multi-Sig.\n\nFor this trial, delegates must self-report that they have met the 90% participation and 90% communication thresholds each month to receive delegate incentives. Each delegate should also self-report the lowest level of HOP they were delegated that month and the number of incentives they are eligible to receive.\n\n~~To ease this workload, Flipside Crypto will create a query where delegates can input their address and view an undisputed lowest level of delegated HOP that month.~~\n\n**To ease this workload, a Dune query has been created by @shanefontaine. [The query can be found here.](https://dune.com/queries/1672223)**\n\nIf the delegate wishes the HOP to be sent to an address other than their delegate address, they should also specify that address in their monthly self-reporting. Delegates are reminded that HOP incentive payments will be public and on-chain.\n\nThis self-reporting will occur on the [Hop Forum](https://forum.hop.exchange/) under a thread dedicated to reporting delegate eligibility each month. In the event a community member disputes (with evidence) the self-reported metrics of a delegate, it is up to the Community Multisig to determine whether a discrepancy was in bad faith. The Community Multisig is authorized to exclude any delegate from this program for the remainder of the 6-month trial if such a dispute occurs.\n\nFor clarity, delegates should self-report using the following formulae:\n\nVote participation percent = (Number of proposals voted upon ÷ all proposals) * 100\n\nCommunication participation percent = Number of proposals referenced with voting position and reasoning for that position ÷ all proposals ) * 100\n\nProposals include all “temperature check” polls on Snapshot as well as formal on-chain polls. Only submissions after the date of approval of this program – for 6 months – are to be considered for this reporting. **Only votes that have concluded are to be included at the time of reporting; any polls still open are not to be included in participation metrics.**\n\n**Example: A Snapshot poll is open from December 3rd through December 11th, but the reporting period for delegate participation ends on December 10th. Under this amendment, it is intended that delegates would not report their participation in this poll for a period ending on the 10th of December. The poll would be reported in the following period.**\n\n*If this program is extended in its current or revised form, it is recommended Hop governance advertise an RFP to automate the reporting and tracking functions.*",

      "content": "Title: HIP 9: Hop Community Grants\nAuthor(s): Jack Clancy, Benji Cohen\nContributors: N/A\nStatus: RFC\nDate Posted: 2022-09-21\n```\n\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nHop is an emerging protocol with a large community of developers and users. It is one of the most used crypto apps in the last few months due to its utility and support for many of the most popular blockchain networks.\n\nEstablishing a grants program that funds independent developers to build on top of HOP will increase developer interest. Protocol developments could be alternative frontends, in depth analytics sites or dune dashboards, or sdks that make it easier to integrate with HOP, just to name a few. There have been several successful grants programs like Uniswap grants, Liquity, and Maker, which this proposal attempts to emulate.\n\n**Renewal/Sunset:**\n\nThis program is intended to be reviewed after 6 months. After the trial period ends, if the program is not renewed, any unused $HOP token will be returned to the treasury.\n\n**Funding**\n\nThe initial grants program will allocate 750k HOP to the grants program (~$100k), which holds a multisig at 0x1ECC9Ee9980348a2373c1F2EFbfDF520a389f35C. This should give the grants program enough funding to allocate several sizable grants to the HOP development program. The intention of this funding amount is not to definitely allocate all funds, but to have enough funds to give out several sizable grants if there are worthy candidates. As stated previously in this RFC, any unused funds will be returned to the treasury or rolled over into a more formalized grants program after the 6 month trial period.\n\n**Reporting and administration:**\n\nDevelopers wishing to seek a grant from the HOP grant program will have to apply via a forum post here, outlining what they plan to build, milestone deliverables, and the amount of funding they require to develop in line with their specifications.\n\nDAO governance will select several eligible candidates (based on their technical expertise, prior contributions to their protocol and their willingness to contribute time to this initiative) to administer this grant program.\n\nGrants under this program will receive a maximum of 100k HOP, which is ~$16k USD given current market pricing for HOP. The grants committee will allocate funds to developers as they see fit. The grants committee members could be as follows:\n\n* Lito Coen - Hop Growth\n* Getty Hill - GFX Labs\n* 4Poops - HOP Delegate\n* Jack Clancy - Developer and DAO contributor\n* Chris Winfrey\n\nThe grants multisig is at the address 0x1ECC9Ee9980348a2373c1F2EFbfDF520a389f35C.\n\nThis is not a hard recommendation, would like to have community input from the DAO on committee members. Most importantly, members of this committee will be engaged, have a stake in HOP and have technical expertise to review grants proposals.\n\nThe grants committee will be added as admins to a Gnosis Safe that holds the funds allocated to the grants program. They will vote with a simple majority quorum whether or not to fund grants. Grant submissions will come via forum postings with a lightweight template developed if/when this proposal passes\n\n**Disclaimer:** Jack Clancy and Benji Cohen are writing this on behalf of Web3 Equities, a liquid token fund run by Benji Cohen. The fund has a sizable $HOP position.",

Specifically, we’d like to see Hop prioritize adding ETH, USDC, USDT, DAI.\n\n**About zkSync**\nzkSync 2.0 is a ZK rollup that supports generalized EVM compatibility for the Ethereum blockchain. The primary benefit of zkSync 2.0 is that developers who have created EVM dApps can port to zkSync 2.0 effortlessly and realize significantly lower gas fees and more transactions per second without compromising on security.\n\nzkSync 2.0 is a significant leap forward in Layer 2 technologies with long awaited improvements and benefits for Ethereum developers:\n* zkSync ecosystem has over 150 projects committed to launching on mainnet, including top DeFi protocols, infrastructure, on/off ramps, etc.\n* Deploying on zkSync will onboard new users & increase user activity on Curve by decreasing costs compared to Ethereum without security degradation\n* zkSync shares Ethereum’s ethos as a free open-source project with a commitment to personal sovereignty, decentralization and community ownership\n\n**Technicalities**\n* Solidity/Vyper support; recommended to use ^0.8.0 and Vyper ^0.3.3 details\n* RPC is public: We fully support the Ethereum JSON API, with some additions for L2-level features. More information here\n* Bridging assets and L1 <> L2 framework details\n* The Graph is currently indexing zkSync v1 and v2\n* Working on all other plugins (ape, founders, remix, truffle, tenderly)\n* Chainlink finalising deployment prior to full alpha\n* Audits in progress with multiple tier 1 auditors and bug bounty program\n\n**Vote**\nYes - Deploy HOP bridge on zkSync\nNo - No action\n",

This proposal proposes a co-incentive for the sUSD pool with Synthetix Treasury Council which has signaled to post $5k worth of $OP.\n\nFurthermore, to ensure that both of these rewards are the same the SNX co-incentive will be adjusted to $5k worth of $OP monthly.\n\nSpecification\nIncentivize liquidity for hsUSD/sUSD with $5k of $OP monthly with a matching $HOP incentive.\n\nIncentivize liquidity for hSNX/SNX with $5k of $OP monthly with a matching $HOP incentive.",

Specifically, we’d like to see Hop prioritize adding ETH, USDC, USDT, DAI.\n\n**About zkSync**\nzkSync 2.0 is a ZK rollup that supports generalized EVM compatibility for the Ethereum blockchain. The primary benefit of zkSync 2.0 is that developers who have created EVM dApps can port to zkSync 2.0 effortlessly and realize significantly lower gas fees and more transactions per second without compromising on security.\n\nzkSync 2.0 is a significant leap forward in Layer 2 technologies with long awaited improvements and benefits for Ethereum developers:\n* zkSync ecosystem has over 150 projects committed to launching on mainnet, including top DeFi protocols, infrastructure, on/off ramps, etc.\n* Deploying on zkSync will onboard new users & increase user activity on Curve by decreasing costs compared to Ethereum without security degradation\n* zkSync shares Ethereum’s ethos as a free open-source project with a commitment to personal sovereignty, decentralization and community ownership\n\n**Technicalities**\n* Solidity/Vyper support; recommended to use ^0.8.0 and Vyper ^0.3.3 details\n* RPC is public: We fully support the Ethereum JSON API, with some additions for L2-level features. More information here\n* Bridging assets and L1 <> L2 framework details\n* The Graph is currently indexing zkSync v1 and v2\n* Working on all other plugins (ape, founders, remix, truffle, tenderly)\n* Chainlink finalising deployment prior to full alpha\n* Audits in progress with multiple tier 1 auditors and bug bounty program\n\n**Vote**\nYes - Deploy HOP bridge on zkSync\nNo - No action",

      "title": "[HIP 9] Should the Hop community fund a grants program?",
      "content": "Author(s):\nJack Clancy (@0xjack_)\nBenji Cohen (@benjicohen421)\n\nStatus: Temperature Check\n\n**Date Posted: 2022-10-31**\n\n\n\nThis is a temperature check, in line with current Hop governance processes, where DAO members vote off-chain on Snapshot prior to the vote going on-chain for formal execution\n\nAs per the instructions in Phase I (RFC), the question posed is: “Should Hop governance fund a grants program?”\n\n## Motivation:\n\nHop is an emerging protocol with a large community of developers and users. It is one of the most used crypto apps in the last few months due to its utility and support for many of the most popular blockchain networks.\n\nEstablishing a grants program that funds independent developers to build on top of HOP will increase developer interest. Protocol developments could be alternative frontends, in depth analytics sites or dune dashboards, or sdks that make it easier to integrate with HOP, just to name a few. There have been several successful grants programs like Uniswap grants, Liquity, and Maker, which this proposal attempts to emulate.\n\n## Renewal/Sunset:\n\nThis program is intended to be reviewed after 6 months. After the trial period ends, if the program is not renewed, any unused $HOP token will be returned to the treasury.\n\n## Funding\n\nThe initial grants program will allocate 750k HOP to the grants program (~$75k). This should give the grants program enough funding to allocate several sizable grants to the HOP development program. The intention of this funding amount is not to definitely allocate all funds, but to have enough funds to give out several sizable grants if there are worthy candidates. As stated previously in this RFC, any unused funds will be returned to the treasury or rolled over into a more formalized grants program after the 6 month trial period.\n\nGrants larger than $15k will have to go through a full governance process (RFC-> Temp Check Vote -> On Chain Vote) before being funded.\n\n## Reporting and administration:\n\nDevelopers wishing to seek a grant from the HOP grant program will have to apply via a forum post here, outlining what they plan to build, milestone deliverables, and the amount of funding they require to develop in line with their specifications.\n\nGrants under this program will receive a maximum of 150k HOP, which is ~$15k USD given current market pricing for HOP. The grants committee will allocate funds to developers as they see fit. The grants committee members will be as follows:\n\n    Lito - Hop Growth\n    Getty - GFX Labs\n    FourPoops - HOP Delegate & Activist\n    Jack - Developer and DAO contributor\n    Chris Winfrey - Hop founder\n\n\nThe grants committee have beeen added as admins to a Gnosis Safe that holds the funds allocated to the grants program. They will vote with a simple majority quorum whether or not to fund grants. The Gnosis Safe is already deployed at `0x1ECC9Ee9980348a2373c1F2EFbfDF520a389f35C`\n\nGrant submissions will come via forum postings with a lightweight template developed if/when this proposal passes. There will be an expectation that developers applying for grants articulate the value added to Hop DAO in their proposals and certain milestones may need to be reached for all grant funding to be released. There may also be an additional reporting requirement to keep Hop community up to date of how grants develop. This will be determined on a proposal to proposal basis.\n\n",

      "content": "**Description:**\n\nThis is a snapshot-only proposal for the Hop Community Multisig to redirect its veNFT voting power on Velodrome (on Optimism) to the WETH/HOP volatile pair.\n\nNow that $HOP is a multichain token, incentives are needed to bootstrap liquidity, volume, and price discovery on L2s. Velodrome is a protocol owned AMM on the Optimism Network. Hop’s community multisig already owns a Velodrome veNFT (granted by Velodrome) with significant voting power. This veNFT voting power can and should be directed toward the WETH/HOP pair on Velodrome in order to incentivize liquidity at effectively no cost to the Hop DAO. Currently, Hop’s veNFT is voting on a OP/USDC pair which does not directly serve Hop’s interests. A veNFT vote for WETH/HOP also would accrue HOP and ETH trading rewards from the pool to the community multisig. This proposal only allows for the execution of a veNFT vote on the WETH/HOP pair and does not discuss what should be done with HOP and ETH proceeds. What to do with these fees would be decided at a later point in a separate vote.\n\nNOTE: As this is a snapshot-only proposal, the results of this vote grant power by the Hop DAO to the community multisig to execute all necessary transactions related to this proposal.\n\n**Vote options :**\n\nYes - Authorize the community multisig to direct its veNFT voting power to the WETH/HOP volatile pair on Velodrome Finance (Optimism)\nNo - No action",

      "title": "Hop Proposal Bundle: HIPs 0-7, SNX/sUSD Bridging Support",
      "content": "This is the inaugural on-chain vote for Hop Protocol governance. It consists of a bundle of eight proposals that successfully passed a Snapshot temperature check, and initiated by six different authors. Several proposals (HIPs 3, 4, and 7) authorize the community multisig to disburse funds. There is currently ample funding in that address, and no new HOP is required from the protocol at this time.\n\nPlease refer to the linked Snapshot poll and forum discussion for the full language of each proposal rather than relying on the brief description here.\n\nThe full list of proposals bundled for this vote are:\n\nHIP 0: Hop Mission Statement and Success Framework\nHIP 1: Deploy a HOP Bridge\nHIP 2: Explore Private Sale Legal Options\nHIP 3: Governance Incentives\nFast bridging support for SNX and sUSD\nHIP 4: Delegate Incentivization Trial\nHIP 6: Deploy a HOP bridge on Arbitrum Nova\nHIP 7: AMM and Bonder Liquidity Incentives\n\nThese proposals were all bundled together because they 1) passed overwhelmingly in Snapshot polls, 2) have no immediate on-chain executable component that could present technical risk, 3) collectively created a large backlog of governance initiatives to bring to a final vote.\n\nSnapshot is a great tool to quickly and affordably (freely) poll token holders. However, it is not meant to set policy for the DAO. All governance must occur on-chain.\n\nGenerally, GFX Labs does not support the bundling of proposals. Experience suggests it leads to low engagement and haphazard due diligence by voters. In this case, however, the bundling was deemed appropriate due to the low risk and high consensus already mentioned. \n\nIf this proposal fails, GFX Labs will separate out those components it feels are most important and least controversial, and prioritize those for narrower votes.\n\n# HIP 0: Hop Mission Statement and Success Framework\n## Background\nForum Discussion: https://forum.hop.exchange/t/discussion-hop-s-mission-and-primary-success-metric/234\n\nDiscord Discussion: https://discord.com/channels/789310208413270078/988600846877065316/988614962534572072\n\nSnapshot Temperature Check: https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth/proposal/0x603f0f6e54c7be8d5db7e16ae7145e6df4b439b8aac49654cdfd6b0c03eb6492\n\n## Proposal\nThis proposal adopts a mission statement and success framework for Hop Protocol\n\n\n\n\n# HIP 1: Deploy a HOP bridge\n\n## Background\nForum Discussion: https://forum.hop.exchange/t/temperature-check-hip-1-deploy-a-hop-bridge/315\n\nSnapshot Temperature Check: https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth/proposal/0xd8dfe984a70f7999ee8ce31ab725fc450074b83e9c9cf515b29c2e4c783b7bfe\n\n## Proposal\nDeploy a HOP bridge to Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and Gnosis Chain.\n\n\n# HIP 2: Explore Private Sale Legal Options\n\n## Background\nForum Discussion: https://forum.hop.exchange/t/temperature-check-hip-2-explore-private-sale-legal-options/316\n\nSnapshot Temperature Check: https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth/proposal/0x5ed734668ad7eb7a6080f23d6cf119379ba6ca3bbbac7de0a80cc47b2b09aca5\n\n## Proposal\nHop DAO authorizes the Hop Foundation to explore legal options and documentation so that should Hop DAO vote to conduct a private sale, the Hop Foundation is prepared from a legal perspective to execute it.\n\n\n# HIP 3: Hop Governance Incentives\n\n## Background\nForum Discussion: https://forum.hop.exchange/t/temperature-check-should-hop-governance-fund-bounties-on-successful-proposals/340\n\nSnapshot Temperature Check: https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth/proposal/bafkreihvjb3ytkqrroouve3kwuho46ho2dz2an2oljokjwnx6lwmaekumi\n\n## Proposal\nUtilize a fixed monthly allocation of HOP to incentivize successful concrete, outcome-producing governance proposals.\n\n\n# Fast bridging support for SNX and sUSD\n\n## Background\nForum Discussion: https://forum.hop.exchange/t/request-for-comment-fast-bridging-support-for-snx-and-susd/380\n\nSnapshot Temperature Check: https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth/proposal/bafkreihioi2uoubmzc4onqxbhvfuvvngsrbbox6yesbuyhfngc5a7gmuvu\n\n## Proposal\n\nThis is a proposal for HOP protocol to offer fast bridging support for SNX and sUSD to/from Optimism and L1.\n\n\n# HIP 4: Delegate Incentivization Trial\n\n## Background\nForum Discussion: https://forum.hop.exchange/t/rfc-hop-delegate-incentivization-trial/376\n\nSnapshot Temperature Check: https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth/proposal/bafkreic3hu4fhna7lfyecwvvasfqccygzhpkvw2zu4mihzglccwa5om6ii\n\n## Proposal\nThis trial program aims to attract and retain both entities and individuals who will actively participate in governance on behalf of HOP token-holders.\n\n\n# HIP 6: Deploy a HOP bridge on Arbitrum Nova\n\n## Background\nForum Discussion: https://forum.hop.exchange/t/request-for-comment-deploy-a-hop-bridge-on-arbitrum-nova/344\n\nSnapshot Temperature Check: https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth/proposal/0x3df21f676877e7c87311ef6cb6864abd865d2e58a2613d6f10dd291b4f5dbce6\n\n## Proposal\n\nDeploy a HOP bridge on Arbitrum Nova.\n\n\n# HIP 7 - AMM and Bonder Liquidity Incentives\n\n## Background\nForum Discussion: https://forum.hop.exchange/t/request-for-comment-amm-and-bonder-liquidity-incentives/352\n\nSnapshot Temperature Check: https://snapshot.org/#/hop.eth/proposal/bafkreicliwx2wt4rnjbappi4yyk4z2qrh224guatw7z3uo3wwh7ruekeee\n\n\n## Proposal\n\n**LP Incentives**\n2,000,000 HOP per month\n\n\n**Bonder Incentives**\n800,000 HOP per month\n",

Providing HOP incentives for Hop LPs has the potential to increase AMM liquidity significantly.\n\nIn addition, Bonder returns have been low or have required a high bonder fee percentage to maintain adequate returns. A multitude of recent bridge hacks have also raised the risk profile of bridges in general despite Hop’s strong track record of security.  As a result, bonders will need additional incentives if Hop DAO wishes to keep bonder fees low and keep bonders interested until a decentralized bonder network is achieved.\n\n# Proposal\n\nProvide 2,000,000 HOP per month to Hop LPs and 800,000 HOP per month to Hop bonders.

We wanted to reach out to see if Hop would be interested in supporting Nova bridging when we launch the chain.\n\n### Proposal\nWe would like Hop to deploy a bridge on Arbitrum Nova in order to support fast bridging.\n\n### Motivation\nOn Nova launch, Arbitrum will maintain a bridge between Ethereum and Arbitrum Nova. Yet, we would like to direct users to Hop and others for bridging between Arbitrum One and Nova for a seamless experience independent of L1 bridging.\n\n### About Arbitrum Nova\nArbitrum Nova, a new chain powered by Arbitrum’s AnyTrust technology, is now live on mainnet. While Arbitrum One, the Arbitrum rollup chain is already up to 97% cheaper than Ethereum for many transaction types, Nova has significantly lower transactions costs by utilizing a Data Availability Committee instead of posting all call data to Ethereum. This makes it perfect for gaming and social projects with cost-sensitive and/or high transaction volume use cases.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1546560661282586626\n\n### Vote\nYes - Deploy a HOP bridge\n\nNo - No action",

      "content": "Author(s): \nGFX Labs (@gfxlabs)\nFlipside Crypto (@fig)\nFranco Macklis (@franco)\n\nStatus: Temperature Check\n\n[Date Posted: 2022-08-24](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/rfc-hop-delegate-incentivization-trial/376)\n\nThis is a request for comment (RFC), in line with current Hop governance processes 1, intended to provide a place for comment and feedback to be incorporated before moving it to a temperature check and requesting a sponsor to create a formal Hop Proposal.\n\nAs per the instructions in Phase I (RFC), the question posed is: “Should Hop governance incentivize participation by delegates under this trial program?”\n\nGFX Labs, Flipside Crypto, and Franco Macklis are all under the 1 million HOP threshold to initiate a formal vote if the temperature check is successful.\n\n**Motivation**\nHop’s governance is new, with a need to decentralize control and oversight of the protocol. This trial program aims to attract and retain both entities and individuals who will actively participate in governance on behalf of HOP token-holders.\n\n**Sunset**\nThis program is intended to be a temporary trial and will end after 6 months unless it is extended through a governance vote.\n\n**Eligibility**\nMinimum Participation Requirement: To remain eligible for delegate incentives, a delegate must maintain at least a 90% participation rate. Participation is measured as voting in any “temperature check” or on-chain governance vote.\n\nMinimum Communication Requirement: To remain eligible for delegate incentives, a delegate must maintain at least a 90% communication rate. Participation is measured as providing for any “temperature check” or on-chain governance vote a summary, voting position, and justification for that position. A missed vote will still require communication to avoid a lower communication rate.\n\nMeasurement Period: Both minimum requirements will be measured on a 6-month basis, which is also the intended length of this trial. If this program is renewed, participation and communication requirements will continue to be measured on a rolling 6-month (182-day) basis.\n\nMinimum Delegation Threshold: To remain eligible for delegate incentives, a delegate must maintain at least 90,000 HOP voting weight.\n\n**Specifications For Incentives Paid**\nDelegate incentives increase with the amount of HOP delegated, but in a decreasing fashion. This means that a small delegate will receive a greater incentive per voting weight than a large delegate, but a larger delegate will receive more.\n\nThe formula for delegate incentives is:\n\nI = (log(h)-4.55)*3500\n\nI = Incentives to be received\nh = lowest level of HOP delegated that month\n\nThis formula targets ~1400 HOP for a delegate at the minimum threshold. At the time of writing, 20 delegates qualify for the minimum eligibility threshold.\n\nFor reference, a few benchmarks:\n\na delegate holding all 1 billion HOP would receive 12,075 HOP per month.\n10 million HOP, a delegate would receive 8,575 HOP per month.\n1 million HOP, a delegate would receive 5,075 HOP per month.\n100,000 HOP, a delegate would receive 1,575 HOP per month.\nThis formula’s slope was chosen to provide the targeted levels of minimum and maximum compensation and is open to revision at the close of this trial. In general, it was selected to provide a slower accumulation of incentives for larger delegates than smaller ones, while preserving a noticeable increase at all levels (under the maximum cap) for any delegate that can attract more delegated HOP votes.\n\nThis link provides a graph and visualization for those interested. 1\n\n**Reporting & Administration**\nDelegate compensation will be paid directly to delegate addresses (or their assigned alternative address) by the Community Multi-Sig.\n\nFor this trial, delegates must self-report that they have met the 90% participation and 90% communication thresholds each month to receive delegate incentives. Each delegate should also self-report the lowest level of HOP they were delegated that month and the number of incentives they are eligible to receive.\n\nTo ease this workload, Flipside Crypto will create a query where delegates can input their address and view an undisputed lowest level of delegated HOP that month.\n\nIf the delegate wishes the HOP to be sent to an address other than their delegate address, they should also specify that address in their monthly self-reporting. Delegates are reminded that HOP incentive payments will be public and on-chain.\n\nThis self-reporting will occur on the Hop Forum under a thread dedicated to reporting delegate eligibility each month. In the event a community member disputes (with evidence) the self-reported metrics of a delegate, it is up to the Community Multisig to determine whether a discrepancy was in bad faith. The Community Multisig is authorized to exclude any delegate from this program for the remainder of the 6-month trial if such a dispute occurs.\n\nFor clarity, delegates should self-report using the following formulae:\n\nVote participation percent = (Number of proposals voted upon ÷ all proposals) * 100\n\nCommunication participation percent = Number of proposals referenced with voting position and reasoning for that position ÷ all proposals ) * 100\n\nProposals include all “temperature check” polls on Snapshot as well as formal on-chain polls. Only submissions after the date of approval of this program – for 6 months – are to be considered for this reporting.\n\n*If this program is extended in its current or revised form, it is recommended Hop governance advertise an RFP to automate the reporting and tracking functions.*",

      "title": "Fast bridging support for SNX and sUSD",
      "content": "Summary:\n\nThis is a proposal for HOP protocol to offer fast bridging support for SNX and sUSD to/from Optimism and L1.\n\nThe Synthetix Treasury Council has committed to seeding liquidity for bonders and offering $OP incentives to SNX/hSNX and sUSD/hsUSD LPs on Optimism to facilitate the process.\n\nOne non-binding piece of the proposal would be if Hop Protocol were to consider matching Synthetix with $HOP co-incentives. This would give Synthetix more runway for future collaboration and would also be a strong signal of alignment to the respective communities.\n\n\nRationale:\n\nCurrently Synthetix is the largest [non-lending] protocol by TVL on Optimism and has been one of the most used Dapps on Optimism since the rollup first launched. Being so early to a new rollup does have some consequences though, like the fact that the infrastructure just wasn’t there for many of the things Synthetix was building. One such case was that synths were now being minted on two separate chains and thus were not fungible with each other.\nHowever, after SIPs 165 2 and 229, full synth fungibility between L1 and L2 has been achieved, so users can transfer sUSD between L1 and L2 as they are accustomed to with the standard optimism bridge.\n\nAlthough the infrastructure is now in place for synth and SNX bridging, there is still a challenge from a user experience perspective when it comes to the optimistic challenge window and delay when withdrawing funds from Optimism through the standard bridge. This obstacle can become problematic if it impedes arbitrage between L1<> l2 and causes unhealthy market dynamics. Therefore the Synthetix Treasury Council is committed to offer the necessary resources and incentives to integrate with Hop and enable fast bringing.\n\nFast bridging support for SNX and sUSD on Hop would be a major UX improvement for Synthetix but it would also result in a ton of volume + usage for Hop Protocol. Unlike tokens such as ETH, USDC, DAI or others, there is no other bridge which supports sUSD and SNX. While a user may have 10 different options for bridging ETH to/from Optimism, the only way to fast bridge sUSD and SNX would be through HOP, meaning Hop protocol will capture all of the Synthetix volume that needs to be bridged to/from Optimism for arbitrage or otherwise.\n\nConsidering the above, if this proposal passes, I think it would make sense for Hop protocol to co-incentivize hToken liquidity with Synthetix on Optimism, and though it’s not a binding condition, it’d likely be to the overall benefit of both protocols if this were a joint incentive program.\n\n\nSpecification:\n\nSeed bonders on L1 with SNX and sUSD from the Synthetix Treasury\n\nIncentivize liquidity for hSNX/SNX and hsUSD/sUSD with $OP\n\nPotential co-incentives\n\nRoll out bridging support for SNX and sUSD on Hop\n\n\nNotes:\n*Unlike other tokens which Hop protocol supports on several chains, SNX and sUSD are only utilized on L1 and Optimism so naturally this proposal does not cover support for bridging to any other chain but Optimism.\n\n*Launch with support for SNX to begin with, followed by sUSD in the future\n\n*Proposing 10k $OP and 100k $HOP rewards per month for the SNX pool ",

Additionally, Hop needs to provide avenues for community participation beyond those serving as delegates (though this proposal is intended to include delegates as well).\n\n**Spirit of the Proposal**\nUtilize a fixed monthly allocation of HOP to incentivize successful concrete, outcome-producing governance proposals.\n\n**Allocation**\nThis initiative would allocate 16,000 HOP to the community multi-sig.\n\nAt the end of each calendar month, the community multi-sig will distribute HOP to the authors of successful proposals that are eligible for a distribution. Hop governance will also distribute an equal amount of Hop back to the community multi-sig at the end of each calendar month, to replenish any HOP that has been distributed for this program. At no time should there be more than 16,000 HOP in the community multi-sig for this program.\n\n**Eligible Proposals**\nAll proposals that succeed upon a formal on-chain vote will be eligible unless otherwise excluded below.\n\n**Ineligible Proposals**\nProposals requesting budgets, grants, or Hop governance to engage with a vendor are excluded from this program.\n\nProposals making de minimis amendments to previous proposals (e.g. fixing only typos) are excluded from this program.\n\nProposals that have no direct, actionable outcome (e.g. establishing a mission statement) are excluded from this program.\n\n**Eligible Recipients**\nThe original author of a proposal on the Hop Forum will be the recipient, regardless of who initiates a Snapshot or on-chain vote. This is so that small holder community members can benefit, and large holders do not capture the rewards for others’ proposals.\n\nIf there are multiple authors, they should communicate clearly to the community multi-sig signers how any distribution would be managed.\n\n**Incentive Amounts**\nThis program will award a maximum of 3,200 HOP per proposal. In the event disbursements would total more than the 16,000 HOP available for a month, then each eligible proposal is allocated an equal amount of HOP from the 16,000 available.\n\n**Administration**\nThe community multi-sig will disburse incentives no later than the first Friday following the end of a month.\n\nGovernance will schedule to replenish any HOP disbursed prior to the next scheduled disbursement.\n\nAuthors of successful proposals are ultimately responsible for communicating to the community multi-sig where to send their HOP tokens. While the address may be communicated privately, recipients should note that any HOP distribution will be public on the blockchain.",

Any shortcomings concerning these values should be considered a failure in Hop DAO’s mission.\n\nBeyond adhering to these core values, Hop DAO’s success should be measured by **monthly volume**. When available, monthly volume can be referenced as a percentage of market share to limit noise from market-wide factors. In other contexts, monthly volume can be referenced in absolute terms.\n\n## Ongoing Refinement\n\nIf this mission statement and success framework are adopted, additions and changes should be encouraged. More clearly defining what it means to be secure, trustless, and community-owned through subsequent proposals could help inform governance discussions and drive meaningful action towards these goals in the future.\n\nIn addition, monthly volume only serves as a good metric for Hop’s token bridge. If Hop DAO decided to open up Hop’s messaging layer for generalized use or add any other type of protocol offering, the success framework should be amended.\n\nLastly, Hop DAO may want to broaden or alter its mission statement in the future. This should also be encouraged when there is community support. The mission statement is meant to signal the current goals of the Hop community and not serve as a doctrine to which the community is bound.\n\n## Motivation\n\nDefine a mission statement and success framework to serve as the basis for future proposal discussions.\n\n## Voting\n\nYes - Adopt the mission statement and success framework\n\nNo - No action",
