      "title": "Return assets drained from FFF, CC10, DEFI5 (Pt. 2)",
      "content": "**NOTE** This proposal will only return assets to users who held FFF, CC10 or DEFI5 at the time Proposal 16 was executed. It does not return any assets other than those drained from those index pools and their associated Uniswap pairs to the Indexed treasury.\n\n## Context\nIn November, the Indexed DAO passed Proposal 16 to drain the assets in DEFI5, CC10, FFF and their respective market pairs. After the October hack, these pools were no longer functioning and were losing value. Proposal 16 was intended to prevent further losses by transferring the assets underlying the affected pools to the DAO, where they would be used to fund a compensation plan.\n\nIt has since become clear that this compensation plan would unfairly affect holders of these assets, as their tokens would be distributed amongst a larger pool of users who had already redeemed the value of their tokens. The DAO previously passed a Snapshot proposal to return these assets to users via a merkle distribution. For more context, see that proposal: https://gov.indexed.finance/#/proposal/0xee15c98c58c2cbb8dc29b0143ab75c8ce65eed6e31fd478e6a2d7a07041e762f\n\nAfter building a database of token holders at the time of the proposal, we've realized that the merkle distribution plan could negatively affect some users, particularly those who held assets in smart contracts which can only interact with the index pools according to their expected behavior. Because many holders of the tokens are unverified smart contracts, we can not guarantee that this merkle distribution wouldn't result in some tokens being locked / unredeemable.\n\n## Solution\nTo ensure the fairest redistribution of assets, we think the drained tokens should simply be returned to the index pools, which still have their original balance records because the pool contracts have been locked since the proposal was executed. The pool contracts would then have their implementations set to a contract which disables all non-view pool functions aside from basic ERC20 transfers and `exitPool`, which burns pool tokens for all underlying assets. This will prevent any arbitrage which might affect the value of extracted underlying assets for users but should maintain interoperability with smart contracts holding tokens on behalf of users so long as they can at least be made to perform an ERC20 transfer of the pool tokens.\n\nThis restricted pool implementation has been written and its code can be viewed here:\nhttps://github.com/d1ll0n/drain-reversal/blob/main/contracts/RestrictedIndexPool.sol\n\nFor Uniswap LP tokens, we have verified that all contracts which hold more than dust are capable of being made to execute arbitrary transactions, and so should have no issue with locked tokens. We don't think it would make sense to return pool tokens / eth directly to the pairs, as then LP holders could be affected by arbitrage; instead, the restricted index pool will block all transfers to/from the pair contracts, and users will be able to redeem their drained tokens via a second contract called UniBurn, which will receive the balance in underlying tokens held by the Uniswap pairs. UniBurn will allow users to \"burn\" (transfer) their Uniswap LP tokens in order to redeem the index tokens and ETH their LP tokens were previously worth.\n\n**Reason for 2 proposals**\n\nThere are three index pools which must receive tokens from the treasury for this proposal to be executed, with a total of 21 individual transfers including WETH. Because of the overlap between CC10 and DEFI5, we can reduce this to 14 transfers using an intermediate Redistributor contract. Each proposal to Indexed governance can execute a maximum of 10 transactions, so this proposal must be split into two.\n\nWe have structured this proposal so that either piece may only have any effect if both are executed. The first will give ERC20 approval for 10 tokens to the Redistributor. The second will give the remaining approvals, update the pool implementations and execute an initialization transaction on the Redistributor to execute all the token transfers and move pair balances to UniBurn.\n\nIf both pieces of this proposal are executed, users will be able to redeem their tokens as noted below; if either proposal fails, no assets will be transferred out of the treasury.\n\n**Index Pools**\n\nCall one of the following functions on the appropriate pool contract:\n- `function exitPool(uint256 poolAmountIn, uint256[] calldata minAmountsOut)`\n- `function exitPoolTo(address to, uint256 poolAmountIn)`\n- `function redeemAll()`\n\n**LP Tokens**\n\nCall the appropriate function on the UniBurn contract for the index pool whose LP tokens you held:\n- `function redeemFFFLP()`\n- `function redeemDEFI5LP()`\n- `function redeemCC10LP()`\n\n## Proposal #1 Actions\n1.

      "title": "Return assets drained from FFF, CC10, DEFI5",
      "content": "**NOTE** This proposal will only return assets to users who held FFF, CC10 or DEFI5 at the time Proposal 16 was executed. It does not return any assets other than those drained from those index pools to the Indexed treasury.\n\n## Context\nIn November, the Indexed DAO passed Proposal 16 to drain the assets in DEFI5, CC10, FFF and their respective market pairs. After the October hack, these pools were no longer functioning and were losing value. Proposal 16 was intended to prevent further losses by transferring the assets underlying the affected pools to the DAO, where they would be used to fund a compensation plan.\n\nIt has since become clear that this compensation plan would unfairly affect holders of these assets, as their tokens would be distributed amongst a larger pool of users who had already redeemed the value of their tokens. The DAO previously passed a Snapshot proposal to return these assets to users via a merkle distribution. For more context, see that proposal: https://gov.indexed.finance/#/proposal/0xee15c98c58c2cbb8dc29b0143ab75c8ce65eed6e31fd478e6a2d7a07041e762f\n\nAfter building a database of token holders at the time of the proposal, we've realized that the merkle distribution plan could negatively affect some users, particularly those who held assets in smart contracts which can only interact with the index pools according to their expected behavior. Because many holders of the tokens are unverified smart contracts, we can not guarantee that this merkle distribution wouldn't result in some tokens being locked.\n\n## Solution\nTo ensure the fairest redistribution of assets, we think the assets should simply be returned to the index pools, which still have their original balance records because the pool contracts have been locked since the proposal was executed. The pool contracts would then have their implementations set to a contract which disables all non-view pool functions aside from basic ERC20 transfers and `exitPool`, which burns pool tokens for all underlying assets. This will prevent any arbitrage which might affect the value of extracted underlying assets for users but should maintain interoperability with smart contracts holding tokens on behalf of users so long as they can at least be made to perform an ERC20 transfer of the pool tokens.\n\nEach index pool will receive exactly the amount of each underlying asset which was taken by the treasury in Proposal 16. Users will then be able to burn their pool tokens for underlying tokens \n\nThis new pool implementation has been written and its code can be viewed here:\nhttps://github.com/d1ll0n/drain-reversal/blob/main/contracts/RestrictedIndexPool.sol\n\nFor Uniswap LP tokens, we have created a secondary contract called UniBurn. UniBurn will allow users to \"burn\" their Uniswap LP tokens (transfer them to the null address) in order to redeem the index tokens and ETH their LP tokens were previously worth.\n\nIf both pieces of this proposal are executed, users will be able to redeem their tokens as follows. If either proposal fails, no assets will be transferred out of the treasury.\n\n**Index Pools**\n\nCall one of the following functions on the appropriate pool contract:\n- `function exitPool(uint256 poolAmountIn, uint256[] calldata minAmountsOut)`\n- `function exitPoolTo(address to, uint256 poolAmountIn)`\n- `function redeemAll()`\n\n**LP Tokens**\n\nCall the appropriate function on the UniBurn contract for the index pool whose LP tokens you held on:\n- `function redeemFFFLP()`\n- `function redeemDEFI5LP()`\n- `function redeemCC10LP()`\n\n## Proposal #1 Actions\n1.

      "content": "Hey there so as you all may be well aware, we've had to be involved with lawyers for the past 1y almost now with trying to get a case made against the attack, and deal with other cases surrounding that attack. As such Dillon and Laurence had been acting to help the DAO as best they could and be the contacts for the lawyers both for cooperation as well as who was liable for the bill. As such a bill at end March reached $350,000. I had OTCd some funds (300k NDX at $1.3) with the intention to help fund a side project but after talking to them both thought was unfair for them to have a debt that high after atleast actually pursuing the law route, where most projects wouldnt and dont. As such had given them the funds to not be in debt to the lawyers and they sent me the NDX they had to allow me to keep my voting power and apply to the DAO later for the amount.\n\nRather than just selling NDX again on the open market thought following a style as we had with Wintermute may be better as an incentive as look to hopefully take lead for the project. As such am proposing for a loan whereby 100k NDX will be given to the NDX DAO Treasury, for a $130k loan for 1y. Would then reserve the right to either return the full $130k or have the DAO keep the $100k NDX. Ths both gives incentive for me to make sure the project returns to healthy growth but also atleast compensates some of the $390k so can pay personal expenses and also keep pursuing my own stuff aswell.\n\nTo note the requested funds are not related to the funds from proposal 16 and are assets the DAO had acquired through usual operations and are not user funds in any way.\n\nProof for Transactions\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x75e01b57f2d8c8a110f38626e0bc213a550d230cf5d530f1ff8f627c32bd0ff8\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0xe27f6f40084111718c87c38e94ae0a0070ecbbcb6737af21cc75ccc67c143143\n\nInvoice from Stockwoods Law Firm\n![Screenshot_20220522-080158_Discord|451x500](upload://eQF8gsSoM1rsDDIe9AmDRyaZmD0.jpeg)",

Examples of changes may be adding new tokens if the alternate list is in danger of being emptied or adding or removing tokens from the index due to material changes in tokenomics or project direction. Community members can propose adding or removing a token from the active index or the alternate list at any time.\n\nFurther the community and sigma can update the strategies used / parameters, to increase how smart the index is by altering the scoring contract’s implementation.\n\n**Initial value of CC10**\nWe will target an initial price of $100 for the CC10 token. During the bootstrapping phase, 50 tokens will be funded by pr0 to reach a total value of $5000 (or $100 per token). Once CC10 reaches its target value, the pool will be deployed giving anyone the ability to mint new tokens.\n\n**Token’s criteria**\nThe index has the following criteria for inclusion:\n\nThe token has a market cap from $20 million (as calculated by a rolling 14-day TWAP on Uniswap).\nAtleastb 50,000 holders to prevent concentration manipulations and hypervaluations without userbase.\nThere is at least $500,000 of liquidity for the token on Uniswap/Sushiswap.\nNo major vulnerabilities have been discovered in the token contract.\nThe token’s supply can not be arbitrarily inflated or deflated maliciously.\nThe control model should be considered if the supply can be modified through governance decisions.\nThe token does not have transfer fees or other non-standard balance updates.\nThe token meets the requirements of the ERC20 standard.\nBoolean return values are not required.\nThe sigma committee has authoority to have discretion about a tokens inclusion, to prevent scams and manippulated tokens entering the index, or if the tokens are seen as high risk for reasons such as security, marketing strat, team, or other reasons which may cause the token to be a risk to the index.\n\nUsing ETH as an asset we can remove the need for LP as the index can LP itself through the index AMM mechanism. This will also allow us to have an offering for indexed again to which can compare competitors and acquire users beyond highly speculative assets.",

Recall that in order to be a valid asset, there must be 'sufficient' liquidity in a X/WETH pair on Uniswap V2 (we consider ~US$100,000 sufficient), and the circulating market cap must be at least US$50 million.  To minimize IL impacts of changing multiple index components at the same time, this vote is to select only one token to replace RGT. \n\nThe choices (and their circulating market caps at the time of writing) are:\n•\tRBN – US74 million\n•\tTOKE – US$330 million\n•\tASTRO – US$376 million\n•\tTRIBE – US$271 million\n•\tNone , only remove RGT and Swap RSR\n",

      "title": "Return assets drained to NDX Treasury by Proposal 16 to affected tokenholders ",
      "content": "In November, the Indexed DAO passed Proposal 16 to drain the assets remaining in DEFI5, CC10, FFF and their respective market pairs. After the October hack, these pools were no longer functioning and were losing value. Proposal 16 was intended to prevent further losses by transferring the assets underlying the affected pools to the DAO, where they would be used to fund a compensation plan.\n\nThe gist of this compensation plan was that these assets would be sold into DAI, which would subsequently be moved into a pot which would be split by everyone that lost funds in the hack.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, Dillon and Laurence put forward a proposal to use some of those assets for a different but related purpose, namely to fund the proposed class action lawsuit we’ve filed, which we viewed as the best opportunity to return the most value to all affected tokenholders.\n\nWhile the Snapshot proposal for this plan was unanimously in favour, we have now reconsidered and no longer wish to pursue that course of action, as we don’t believe this approach is fair to all tokenholders. After the Snapshot vote was announced, one significant holder of both DEFI5 and NDX tokens contacted us through legal counsel to object to this plan to use assets from Proposal 16 to fund a lawsuit that they do not wish to participate in. Further, the user has requested that the DAO return the assets from Proposal 16 rather than use them to fund the compensation plan.\n\nSome affected users chose to burn their tokens back into their underlying assets prior to Proposal 16. As a result, assets retrieved from that proposal were taken from those that did not do so. As such, going through with the compensation plan would effectively result in taking value away from users who recovered nothing in the aftermath and transferring it to users who recovered something (by burning their tokens).\n\nIn the time since November, some users have had a chance to reflect on their decision not to burn their tokens. Some users who were less active or less sophisticated may not have been aware of Proposal 16 or may not have understood its significance (and may still not understand them). These users may have acted differently if they understood the consequences.\n\nAs a result, we have taken no further action relating to the assets from Proposal 16, and propose unwinding Proposal 16 to the extent of returning the drained assets to the tokenholders affected by the drain.\n\nThis would be done as follows:\n\n* Setting up a Merkle distributor dictating the assets that affected users would have been able to burn their tokens (or LPs) for had they done so prior to the execution of Proposal 16,\n* Moving all drained assets from the DAO Treasury via a Governor Alpha vote to a separate - industry-standardised - smart contract with no expiry time on claims,\n* Creating a web interface for the affected to claim their assets (e.g. UNI, CRV, SUSHI),\n* Advertising the existence of said interface via Discord, Twitter, Telegram and the Indexed site itself.\n\nWe believe that the execution of this proposal will allow the DAO to draw a line underneath the ownership of affected assets, and grant the affected a degree of immediate relief in terms of assets available to them. We ask the rest of the Indexed DAO to join us in supporting its passing, both in this off-chain consensus gathering phase and - should this step pass - when its implementation is put forward for on-chain execution via Governor Alpha.\n\nIf you wish for the above to be executed, please vote \"Yes: execute\". If you do not, please vote for \"No: do not execute\".\n\nThe vote will run for 7 days - a majority vote in favour with 400,000 NDX votes cast will be considered a signal for the requisite Merkle tree and smart contracts to be built, and a proposal to execute the above put on-chain.",

Due to externalities, this decision was delayed, although the emissions have continued: the transfer of 322,611.70914468578 NDX tokens represents the full balance owed by the DAO to liquidity providers under this emissions curve up until approximately 2 PM UTC on March 10 (https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/14360000).\n\nShould this proposal be passed and executed, everyone who has provided liquidity up until that point will be able to withdraw their accrued NDX rewards in full, and thereafter should remove their single-sided or LP tokens from the Masterchef.",

Prior to putting forward a Governor Alpha vote, it would be ideal if the DAO confirmed - with a larger voice - that it wishes for the continuation of the Masterchef liquidity rewards program to take place.\n\nSo, the question is, once again:\n\nShould the DAO:\n\n* Continue the liquidity program as it is by moving 600,000 NDX from the Treasury to the staking contract, which will cover all existing obligations owed to liquidity providers and further ones until early July 2022?\n\nor\n\n* Terminate the program prematurely, moving over just enough NDX to meet current obligations and then ending rewards for liquidity provision in its current form. We would have to calculate how much NDX this would be exactly, but estimate it would be upwards of 300,000 NDX.\n\nThis vote will run for 3 days (as it is a repeat of a previous vote, and the community has proven significantly more active in light of recent price action).

We have already done significant work on this front with our legal team, culminating in several hundred pages of evidence and explanations of Indexed Finance and the attack on it.\n\n\nWhile we personally lost a small amount from the attack, our primary motivation is to return the stolen assets to the rest of the community, which lost far more. Our secondary motivation is to demonstrate to the DeFi space (and would-be hackers in it) that existing laws very much apply to our industry, and to do so in a way that sets a good precedent for future litigation.\n\nWe have been paying the rather significant legal fees for this case using a combination of our personal assets and some assets we had previously set aside for project development. We have done so in anticipation of eventually being repaid by the DAO, but with the understanding that the community may refuse to do so. Regardless of how the litigation is funded, we have every intention of seeing it through.\n\n\nWe are asking the DAO to give us roughly $750,000 worth of SUSHI recovered from the affected index pools, of which about $200,000 will be used to pay for expenses that have already been incurred and the rest will be set aside for future costs. Should there be any remainder at the end of the case, we will return it to the DAO treasury or to the compensation plan approved by the DAO if one has been deployed.\n\n## Class Action Information\n\nClass action lawsuits require “certification”, in which the court recognizes the lawsuit as a class action and the representative plaintiffs come to officially represent the class. The class action has not yet been certified, but we anticipate that it will be as there has been no alternative class proposed and the court recognizes the importance of this case.\n\nClass actions in Ontario follow the \"opt-out\" model, meaning that, after certification, all class members who do not wish to be part of the class action will be given an opportunity to opt-out, and will be free to pursue their own action with their own lawyer.\n\nThe notice of action and all written arguments and exhibits can be read here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BtZy-xt_KrQGKQ1ZhukBPXB-slXfmTBW?usp=sharing. The court file number is CV-21-00673984-00CP.\n\nSignificant steps in the case (including settlement) will require court approval and include an opportunity to object. Laurence and I will be sharing updates as they occur on Discord and Twitter, contingent on approval from our legal team.\n\nShould we win, the return of the recovered assets is a process that will be decided on by the court. As a result, we can not say how it will work; however, we believe that the fairest distribution would be a pro-rata return of recovered assets according to losses suffered by both direct holders of the affected tokens and liquidity providers for their external markets, including those on secondary blockchains. This would include losses suffered via market correction in the immediate aftermath.\n\n## Rationale\n\nLaurence and I have hired a truly excellent legal team. Jason Gottlieb of Morrison Cohen is advising the legal strategy from the US, while Stockwoods LLP (Gerald Chan, Fredrick Schumann, Stephen Aylward, and Alexandra Heine) is litigating the case in Canada.\n\nJason is a prolific cryptocurrency attorney widely recognized as one of the top crypto lawyers in America. Stockwoods is a highly regarded litigation firm with a history of winning very complex cases and successfully arguing in front of the Supreme Court of Canada; while not as focused on the crypto space, they’re brilliant, award-winning lawyers who wrapped their heads around the situation almost immediately.\n\nWe’re confident that this legal team represents the best chance of successfully litigating this case, and of setting a precedent that is fair to everyone.\n\nWe have opted to pay for services rendered rather than on a contingency basis. This means that we are responsible for paying legal fees outright, but the lawyers will not receive a portion of the recovered assets should we win. While this has been more of a burden for us financially, it will result in the greatest return of assets to affected users if we are successful.\n\nIf we do not receive funding, we will be unable to finance the entirety of this case and will likely need to switch to a contingency basis, which would result in fewer returned assets for victims of the hack. We are asking that the community entrust us with the necessary funding to litigate this the right way and return the greatest amount of stolen assets to affected users.\n\nBecause the project has been so negatively impacted by the hack, it is not possible to fund the lawsuit using the treasury’s NDX. The treasury also does not have much in the way of other unencumbered assets to tap, and more importantly, we don’t believe the project’s ability to fund itself should be sacrificed; however, it does have a significant amount of capital in the form of the assets recovered from the index pools when they were disabled and drained in November. \n\nThese assets were taken from the index pools to stop the bleeding from arbitrage, with the intention of using them for a compensation plan for affected users. If they are used for that purpose, they will cover less than 10% of the losses. Alternatively, if about half of the recovered assets are used to fund this litigation, they could eventually result in the return of the majority of total losses if the suit is successful.\n\nIf the DAO accepts our proposal, we will provide as much transparency into the lawsuit and its expenses as we can without violating attorney-client privilege or otherwise damaging the case. We will periodically disclose our legal fees and will provide a full accounting of the expenses at the conclusion of the case.\n\n## Indexed Finance Attack Response Corp.\n\nLaurence and I have created a corporation as a 50/50 partnership called Indexed Finance Attack Response Corporation, with the purpose of financing this litigation. This proposal will transfer the requested SUSHI to a gnosis wallet controlled by Laurence and me which exists solely for IFAR business. Its assets will not be mixed with our personal assets except for the initial repayment of our previous expenses.",

We would have to calculate how much NDX this would be exactly, but estimate it would be ~280,000 NDX.\n\nThe hack of October 2021 significantly changed the 'layout' of the liquidity mining program, in that it destroyed DEFI5 and CC10 - two of the largest pools - and prompted rewards to be shut off for all associated pools. \n\nAs it stands, rewards are still running for DEGEN-ETH, NFTP-ETH and ORCL5-ETH, as well as single-sided DEGEN.\n\nThe DAO is within its rights to decide at this stage whether the program has met its purpose or should be replaced with some - as yet undetermined - mechanism in the future.\n\nFor discussion on this vote and the topic writ large, please use the forum thread linked at the start of this text.\n\nThis vote will run for one week as a simple choice between the two options. Whichever option has the most votes at the end of the voting period will be taken as the will of the DAO.",

      "title": "Options for moving forward with dNDX",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nLast month, the community voted to halve the revenue share that goes to dNDX in this proposal: [https://gov.indexed.finance/#/proposal/QmUtE66finNuxUsShWGmfoHPqwVL76jqLNwSoXCiJ7L7C8](https://gov.indexed.finance/#/proposal/QmUtE66finNuxUsShWGmfoHPqwVL76jqLNwSoXCiJ7L7C8).\n\nWhile governance never promised the fee split would be static, I think this poses a question of fairness with respect to the previous dNDX depositors. The ideal resolution would be to temporarily allow people to withdraw their NDX with no penalty; unfortunately, the contract does not allow this. Early withdrawal fees can only be permanently disabled.\n\nOne option we have is to unlock dNDX deposits and redeploy the contract so that people who no longer wish to hold dNDX given the new fee split have the option of withdrawing and those who do can redeposit; however, this creates a second issue with respect to those who fall into the latter category but do not notice the redeployment before fees are disbursed.\n\nThe simplest option is to distribute the revenue that was already accumulated before the fee-split vote at the original ratio of 60/40, as that revenue should have been distributed some time ago, use 30/70 going forward, and leave the existing dNDX contract in place. There is a trade-off of fairness either way, so the community needs to decide which option is best under the circumstances.\n\nIf we do redeploy dNDX, I think it makes sense to take two additional steps:\n- Delay disbursal of the accumulated revenue for 15 days or so, to give people time to redeposit.\n- Reduce early withdrawal fees by half.\n\nEarly withdrawal fees were set in a way that disincentivizes deposits with a long duration for which the depositor has no desire to wait until expiry. We can calculate for a given lock duration what the APY would need to be for it to be worthwhile to withdraw early at any time before the lock expires; by halving both revenue and early withdrawal fees, we'd preserve the relationship between the actual APY and the APY needed to make early withdrawal profitable.\n\n## Options\n\nI'm proposing 5 options:\n\n1. Leave dNDX as is. Distribute the revenue accumulated before the split-change proposal at 60/40 dNDX/treasury, and use 30/70 for future revenue.\n2. Re-deploy dNDX with the same fee parameters. Distribute the revenue accumulated before the split-change proposal at 60/40 dNDX/treasury, and use 30/70 for future revenue.\n3. Re-deploy dNDX with halved fee parameters. Distribute the revenue accumulated before the split-change proposal at 60/40 dNDX/treasury, and use 30/70 for future revenue.\n4. Re-deploy dNDX with the same fee parameters. Distribute all revenue at 30/70 dNDX/treasury.\n5. Re-deploy dNDX with halved fee parameters. Distribute all revenue at 30/70 dNDX/treasury.\n\nOption 1 is the easiest to implement, as it won't require any contract or interface changes. It also removes the possibility of existing depositors losing out on accumulated revenue because of a failure to redeposit.\n\nOptions 2-5 differ in how accumulated revenue is distributed and the early withdrawal fees. All of these options would include transferring all of the NFTP, DEGEN, and ORCL5 held by the treasury (minus 4,994 DEGEN) to the fee seller contract, which would then sell the tokens and split the ETH between dNDX and the treasury. The same will be true for Nirn vaults once it is fully released.\n\nIf 2-5 combined receive >50% votes in favor, I will create an on-chain proposal to execute whichever receives the most votes. If 1 receives >50%, I will create a proposal to begin distribution.",

Holders who have not yet burned their tokens are simply losing value to arbitrage, as are Uniswap liquidity providers.\n\nThese assets should be sent to the treasury to be used in compensation efforts.\n\n## Actions\n\nThe actions directly executed by this proposal are:\n\n1. Transfer ownership of the proxy manager's access control contract to the recovery contract.\n2. Execute the `drainAndRepair()` function on the recovery contract.\n\n\nThe call to `drainAndRepair()` on the recovery contract will:\n\n1. Change the proxy implementation for the core and sigma pools and the core UnboundTokenSeller contract to the recovery contract.\n2. Drain the remaining assets from DEFI5, CC10, the CC10 UnboundTokenSeller and FFF to the Indexed treasury.\n3. Drain the ETH from the DEFI5-ETH, CC10-ETH and FFF-ETH Uniswap pairs to the Indexed treasury.\n4. Execute fake deposits of 2**128-1 of DEFI5, CC10 and FFF to Polygon.\n      - These deposits will be received by a gnosis safe owned by the sigma committee and will be used to drain the assets in the DEFI5, CC10 and FFF market pairs on Polygon, which will be sent to the treasury.\n5. Upgrade the proxies for the core and sigma pools and controllers in order to remove the exploited vulnerability and disable the affected contracts.\n    - To prevent issues with staking rewards, DEFI5, CC10 and FFF will not be destroyed.

Approve the committee gnosis to spend 150,000 DAI from the treasury\n\n2. Approve the committee gnosis to spend 20,000 NDX from the treasury\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis proposal sets a new budget of 150,000 DAI and 20,000 NDX for the Indexed growth committee, which has been elected per the recent snapshot vote. This budget is set to last until December 31st 2021, after which there will be a new Indexed Growth Committee election and a new budget proposal.\n\nThe scope of this program encompasses anything that helps the project—sponsoring hackathons or gitcoin bounties, media sponsorships, community competitions, airdrops —anything is fair game. \n\n### IGC Summary\n\nThe mission of the Indexed Growth Committee (IGC) is to identify and pursue opportunities which help to grow the Indexed ecosystem. These can be inbound requests or opportunities proactively pursued by the committee. The point is: to get more people involved in the growth of the project, it is crucial to have a single point of contact responsible for filtering and reviewing the work proposals.\n\n**Examples of things the past IGC funded:**\n\n- Gamified index trading competition\n- Podcast ads\n- Influencer campaigns\n- Video tutorials & more\n\n**Examples of things that are in the pipeline for this IGC:**\n\n- Sponsoring a prize for Argent L2 account (DEFI5 is included)\n- Etherscan ads\n- Podcast ads\n- Educational content\n- Rewarding  community contributors\n- Bounties & Giveaways",

In the interests of establishing a stronger mandate, if this vote fails to reach that, the original decision will be respected.\n\nThis vote will be run via *approval voting*, rather than the single choice voting that was available to Snapshot at the time of the first vote. In this format, your full vote weight will be allocated to all options that you select.\n\n---\n\nThis vote will run for two weeks, and has a quorum of 289,000 NDX.",

Similarly, to vote for a 25/75 split, cast 1 and 3 votes respectively: whatever ratio produces the result you desire (the percentage split will be shown).\n\nWhen the vote has concluded, the percentages of votes cast for each will be rounded and taken as the agreed revenue split.\n\nThis is a fairly big decision, as it directly impacts the potential ability of the DAO to develop itself further.

You can simply cast one vote for each of your preferred candidate, or you can cast multiple votes for a candidate you *really* want to be elected, and then a lower number of votes for those you still wish to signal support for.\n\nYou are allowed to cast as many 'votes' as you wish in this manner: if you only want to vote for one person, that's fine. If you want to vote for all of them, that's also fine. Quadratic voting provides a vote boost to those candidates who receive votes from many voters, potentially outperforming a single candidate who was voted for by a whale.\n\n---\n\nThis vote will run for one week. Good luck, candidates!\n\n",

      "title": "Use Remaining Sigma Allocation to Fund ~5.5 Months of 2 Year Staking Rewards Program",
      "content": "### Summary\n\nWe recently submitted a proposal to create a new program for liquidity mining/staking that uses a fork of MasterChef to distribute rewards.\n\nWe are proposing launching this program by funding the first quarter with the remainder of the tokens allocated to the Sigma program.\n\n### Context: Staking Rewards Proposal\n\nWe recently submitted a proposal to create a new system for staking that uses a fork of MasterChef to distribute rewards. This system is more dynamic than our current distribution system, which uses a separate contract for each staking token and requires static durations and reward amounts. The contract overseeing the rewards program allows governance to set a \"points allocator\" account which is able to decide the relative rewards given to stakers of each token.\n\nThis proposal also included a rewards schedule for distribution that would last two years, with a linear decay on the amount of NDX distributed in each block that begins at ~3,490 NDX in daily rewards and ends at ~618 NDX in daily rewards.\n\nSnapshot Vote Approving Distribution: https://gov.indexed.finance/#/ndx.eth/proposal/QmPbdL6GLJpqaKg6Sez1PuY46xqZHVFSfX3kzwC15hsvJs\n\nDiscussion Thread: https://forum.indexed.finance/t/proposal-update-ndx-emissions-schedule/639\n\n## Proposal Body\n\nWhen the Sigma program was created, the Indexed DAO allocated 600,000 NDX to a timelocked address controlled by the Sigma committee to hand out as LP rewards on newly created index ETFs. Of these tokens, there are 527,500 remaining.\n\nWe propose that instead of funding the full amount assigned to the liquidity mining rewards program from the Treasury (1.5 million NDX), we begin by using the remaining Sigma program tokens to fund the first 1,091,000 blocks (out of 4,778,182). In this way, we create a 'checkpoint' relatively early on that allows the DAO to evaluate the efficiency of the program and decide whether to fund the remainder from the Treasury.\n\nWe further propose that the Sigma committee initially be given the role of points allocator for the new rewards contract, meaning that it has the ability to assign rewards per staking token.\n\nGovernance will retain both the ability to cancel the rewards program early and reclaim the remaining tokens to the Treasury, and the ability to replace the Sigma committee with another account to set the reward allocations.\n\n### Priorities\n\nIn managing reward allocations, the Sigma committee will have three priorities:\n- Ensuring that external markets for our ETFs are sufficiently liquid that the average user can swap, rather than mint or burn, with low price impact.\n- Growing the AUM of the Indexed protocol.\n- Incentivizing liquidity on secondary markets for our ETFs, such as lending, options, leveraged trading, etc.\n\nThe exact method of allocating rewards is likely to shift over time as data is gathered and different strategies are assessed. The Sigma committee will keep the community informed as to how we are allocating rewards and what we are learning about it, and will attempt to develop specific formulaic methods of allocation that can eventually be moved to a smart contract.\n\n### Action Points \n\nIf this proposal is accepted, we will:\n\n* Deploy the staking rewards contracts,\n* Set the Sigma Gnosis safe as the points allocator,\n* Give ownership to the Indexed Treasury, and\n* Queue a transaction to transfer 527,500 NDX to the rewards contract.\n \nAfter seven days have passed (the amount of time required by the Sigma timelock), the tokens will be transferred to the rewards contract and staking rewards will begin.",

When deposits are made, the depositor will receive a bonus multiplier calculated with the formula:\n\nmax_bonus_multiplier * (lock_duration - min_lock_duration)\n/ (max_lock_duration - min_lock_duration)\n\nSo for example if we have min_lock_duration = 1, max_lock_duration = 3, max_bonus_multiplier = 2, then a deposit with duration 2 would get a bonus multiplier of 1, so 2 dNDX would be minted for every 1 NDX deposited.\n\nThe options are:\n\n1) 2.5x\n2) 3x\n3) Reject above options\n\nIf any of the [dNDX Parameters] votes are won by 'Reject above options', deployment of the dNDX functionality will be paused and a new forum thread opened to discuss alternative options.",

      "content": "Discussion Thread: https://forum.indexed.finance/t/proposal-upgrade-proxies-for-index-pools-and-controllers/645\n\n## Summary\n\nThe main impetus for this set of upgrades is the current issue in DEGEN - the rebalance is being delayed and mints/swaps blocked in many cases due to the pool having hit its max weight when RGT was added. An upgrade was required to fix this, so I decided to add some other changes that were due for a merge.\n\nSome queries and events will be added to simplify subgraph tracking and keeper management. Exit fees of 0.5% will be added to the core pools and the default swap fee will be set to 2% across the board. Some new control functions will be added to allow governance to update parameters without further proxy upgrades.\n\n### Transactions\n\n1. Set proxy implementation for SigmaControllerV1.sol to `0xE8721b30211F3b487F02173D054F704301983423`\n2. Set proxy implementation for SigmaIndexPoolV1.sol to `0xf0204D5aEA78F7d9EbE0E0c4fB21fA67426BFefc`\n3. Set proxy implementation for MarketCapSqrtController.sol to `0x120C6956D292B800A835cB935c9dd326bDB4e011`\n4. Set proxy implementation for IndexPool.sol to `0x5bD628141c62a901E0a83E630ce5FaFa95bBdeE4`\n5. Set default exit fee recipient for core controller to the treasury\n6. Set default exit fee recipient for Sigma controller to the treasury\n\t- This value was previously an immutable in the contract bytecode, so we will not be changing the recipient, only adding it to storage.\n7. Set exit fee recipient on CC10, DEFI5, ORCL5 to the treasury\n8. Set swap fee on CC10, DEFI5, ORCL5 to 2%\n9. Set swap fee on DEGEN, NFTP to 2%\n\n### Code & Tests\n\nPull request with modifications to the sigma contracts:\nhttps://github.com/indexed-finance/sigma-core/pull/23\n\nPull request with modifications to the core contracts:\nhttps://github.com/indexed-finance/indexed-core/pull/68\n\nTests of this proposal's transactions against a fork of mainnet:\nhttps://github.com/indexed-finance/proposal-tester\n\n## Contract Modifications\n\nThis proposal would upgrade the proxy implementations for the following contracts:\n- MarketCapSqrtController.sol\n- IndexPool.sol\n- SigmaControllerV1.sol\n- SigmaIndexPoolV1.sol\n\n### Controllers\n\n- Add `setController` function.\n  - Allows governance to set controller on an existing pool.\n- Add `setExitFeeRecipient(address,address)` function.\n\t- Allows governance to update fee recipient on an existing pool.\n- Add `setExitFeeRecipient(address[],address)` function.\n  - Allows governance to update fee recipient on multiple existing pools.\n- Add `setSwapFee(address[],address)` function.\n  - Allows governance to update swap fee on multiple existing pools.\n- Add `setDefaultExitFeeRecipient` function.\n\t- Allows governance to update default fee recipient for new pools.\n- Add events `PoolReweighed` and `PoolReindexed` .\n\t- Enables easier subgraph tracking.\n\n**Core Controller**\n\n- Add `getPoolMeta` function.\n\t- Enables queries for reweigh timing.\n\n**Sigma Controller**\n\n- Add immutable `governance` address.\n- Move `defaultExitFeeRecipient` from bytecode to storage.\n- Add `validTokenList` modifier to function `getTokenScores`.\n- Give governance control over `setSwapFee`.\n\n### Index Pools\n\n- Set default swap fee to 2% instead of 2.5%.\n- Change reweigh behavior:\n\t- Weight changes which would exceed the maximum total weight will not occur rather than reverting.\n\t- Allow token weights to be updated once every 30 minutes instead of once every hour.\n\t- Weight decrease executed before weight increase in swap functions\n- Set `MAX_TOTAL_WEIGHT` to 27 instead of 26 in order to be more flexible during re-indexing.\n- Add `setController` function.\n\t- Allows current controller to set new controller.\n- Add `getExitFee` function.\n- Add events `LOG_EXIT_FEE_RECIPIENT_UPDATED` and `LOG_CONTROLLER_UPDATED`.\n\t- Enables easier subgraph tracking.\n\n**Core Index Pool**\n\n- Add exit fee of 0.5%.\n- Send exit fees to `_exitFeeRecipient` instead of `_controller`.\n- Add `setExitFeeRecipient`.\n\t- Allows controller to set fee recipient.\n- Removed `flashBorrow` function.\n\t-  Not being used and code size is near maximum.\n\n**Sigma Index Pool**\n\n- Change `setExitFeeRecipient` call permission from only current fee recipient to only controller.",

      "content": "Discussion Thread: https://forum.indexed.finance/t/indexed-growth-committee-investing-in-the-growth-of-indexed/518\n\nApproved Snapshot Vote: https://gov.indexed.finance/#/ndx.eth/proposal/Qmcn4SibSCopSEwZ8MtfUALmcXWF7kEXw4vHhm3imreqtu\n\n## Actions\n1. Approve the committee gnosis to spend 100,000 DAI from the treasury\n2. Approve the committee gnosis to spend 10,000 NDX from the treasury\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal outlines a framework for funding Indexed ecosystem development with grants from the Indexed Treasury. It is modeled on the [Uniswap Grants Program](https://sybil.org/#/proposals/uniswap/3), which was carefully crafted by several prominent investors and community figures in the DeFi space.\n\nThe scope of this program encompasses anything that helps the project—sponsoring hackathons or gitcoin bounties, media sponsorships, community competitions—anything is fair game. Eventually it could fund (with renewals approved by governance) core protocol development.\n\nGrant administration is a subjective process that cannot be easily automated, thus we propose a nimble committee of 7 members—1 lead and 6 reviewers—to deliver an efficient, predictable process to applicants, such that funding can be administered without having to put each application to a vote. A threshold of 4/7 votes will be required to spend funds from the committee.\n\nWe propose the program start with a cap of 100,000 DAI + 10,000 NDX for the first quarter—a sum that we believe is appropriate for an initial pilot—renewable or adjustable after each epoch of six months.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe mission of the Indexed Growth Committee (IGC) is to identify and pursue opportunities which help to grow the Indexed ecosystem. These can be inbound requests or opportunities proactively pursued by the committee. The point is: to get more people involved in the growth of the project it is crucial to have a single point of contact responsible for filtering and reviewing the work proposals.\n\n## Budget & Renewals\n\n- Max budget of 100,000 DAI + 10,000 NDX for the first quarter.\n- Budget to be assessed after the first quarter and every six months thereafter.\n\nEach committee will have a term of 2 quarters (6 months/one epoch), after which the program needs to be renewed by NDX governance, excepting the initial committee which will require renewal after the first quarter.\n\n## Initial Committee\n\nGnosis Safe: 0x45Ad0ef471ed7cDaD80B9D77fC43a2dF43E0d4C8\n\nLead: Lito Coen (0x79C4213a328E3B4F1D87b4953C14759399dB25E2)\n\nReviewers:\n1) Fabian Spiegelberger (0xED9c975cC9d4d5B482332bbB78207A59F2aac4F0)\n2) DBuck (0xB203df26AF3666f4214661f7f903C46EDF9403b0)\n3) Gregoire Le Jeune (0xE75E1BA066AcEC0428e6b631e1594F98e0D78268)\n4) Jeddi (0xc035C9F4272F8dBD3FEdd40C77C8B5D9B07c72f5)\n5) Jascha Samadi (0x20314e5D826B739CbcAC702c23a2Ab4c40Fb0940)\n6) Louis Guthman (0x283C8A919F63bAd7D9858ffDF16259C0740DFdAD)\n\n## Methodology\n\n### 1.1 Budget\nThis proposal recommends a max cap of US$100,000 + 10,000 NDX per quarter, with the ability to reevaluate after the first quarter and then biannually at each epoch (two fiscal quarters). While the IGC will be the decision makers around individual grants, respective budgets, roadmaps and milestones, any top-level changes to the IGC including epochs and budget will require a governance vote.\n\nThe IGC will be funded by the Indexed treasury via ERC20 allowances.\n\n### 1.2 Grant Application Process\nGrant applications to the IGC need to be submitted publicly in the forum. We will create a new “Grant” category for this purpose which is where all applications need to be submitted. Applications must be well-written and contain all the relevant information such as price, scope of the proposal, timeline, benefits etc. so that the committee and the community have all the information at hand.\n\nIn rare circumstances, if the committee reaches out proactively to a service provider and wants to keep it private for competitive reasons, it is acceptable to publish the proposal afterwards.\n\n### 1.3 Committee Compensation\nOperating a successful grants program takes considerable time and effort.\n\nThe lead should be compensated for their time. The reviewers will not be compensated for their time as we project that the commitment will be minimal to start (2-5hrs).\n\nWe propose the lead be compensated US$75/hr capped at 10 hours/week. This compensation will come from the the quarterly budget, which will be allocated to the IGC multisig from the NDX treasury. In keeping with the committee’s commitment to the community, hours and duties will be logged publicly and transparently.\n\n### 2.1 Priorities\nInitially, the program aims to start narrow in scope, funding peripheral ecosystem initiatives, such as targeted bounties, education material, tooling & dashboards, media sponsorships, and other low-stakes means of building out the Indexed brand & ecosystem. Over time, if the program proves effective, the grant allocations can grow in scope to include, for example, listings on centralized exchanges, integrations into other dApps and eventually core protocol development.\n\n### 2.2 KPIS\nWith the initial priorities in mind, some effective measures for quick successes might look like:\n\n- Total number of initiatives funded\n- Quarterly increase in applications\n- Project engagement post-event/funding (no of holders, TVL etc.)\n- Overall community engagement/sentiment\n\n### 2.3 Timeline\nThe grants program will be managed on a quarterly basis and reviewed every two quarters after the pilot.\n\nAfter each quarter the committee will be required to submit a report on key metrics to the community.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis program is meant to be the simplest possible MVP of a Indexed Ecosystem Grants initiative. While the multi-sig committee comes with trust assumptions about the members, our hope is the community will approve this limited engagement to get the ball rolling in an efficient structure. After the first quarter the burden of proof will be on IGC to show empirical evidence that the program is worth continuing with renewed funding from the treasury.",

Having met this requirement - which allows the tokens to act as proxy ETFs - we believe that the next objective of the DAO should be the expansion of derivative utility for these instruments.\n\nSuch utility - even that as 'simple' as the ability to act as collateral - for these index trackers permits end-users and market makers alike increased flexibility in terms of managing their risk profile and ability to maximise returns via speculation on the near-term growth or decline of a market sector  through a single asset.\n\nDEFI5 is our flagship index at present, comprising assets that are already natural choices for lending collateral. Introducing the ability to lend against such an aggregate instrument - acting as it does as a volatility hedge for decentralised finance writ large - is, in our opinion, a natural step on the path to its wider adoption.\n\nAdoption of this proposal, and the subsequent introduction of DEFI5 to the Ruler protocol as a lendable asset, exposes our best performing product to a critical part of many DeFi strategies.\n\nWe encourage you to vote for this proposal, and look forward to working with Ruler.",

      "title": "Approve the Indexed Growth Committee",
      "content": "Summary:\nThis post outlines a framework for funding Indexed ecosystem development with grants from the Indexed Treasury. The proposal is largely modelled on a similar proposal in the Uniswap community 1 which has been carefully crafted by several prominent investors and community figures in the DeFi space.\n\nThe scope of the program encompasses anything that helps the project—sponsoring hackathons or gitcoin bounties for example, media sponsorships and community competitions — anything is fair game. Eventually it could fund (with renewals approved by governance) core protocol development.\n\nGrant administration is a subjective process that cannot be easily automated, and thus we propose a nimble committee of 6 members —1 lead and 5 reviewers—to deliver an efficient, predictable process to applicants, such that funding can be administered without having to put each application to a vote. We propose the program start with a cap of US$100,000 + 10,000 NDX for the first quarter - a sum that we believe is appropriate for an initial pilot - renewable or adjustable after each quarter.\n\nPurpose\nThe mission of the Indexed Growth Committee (IGC) is to identify and pursue opportunities which help to grow the Indexed ecosystem. These can be inbound requests or opportunities proactively pursued by the committee. The point is: to get more people involved in the growth of the project it is crucial to have a single point of contact responsible for filtering and reviewing the work proposals.\n\nQuarterly Budget\nMax quarterly budget of up to US$250,000\n\nBudget and caps to be assessed every six months\n\n6 committee members: 1 lead and 5 reviewers\n\nEach committee has a term of 2 quarters (6 months/one epoch), after which the program needs to be renewed by NDX governance\n\nCommittee functions as a 4 of 6 multi-signature Gnosis\n\nWhile the goals and priorities of the grant program will be thoroughly discussed and reviewed by the community through public discourse, the decision to start IGC by operating as a small committee is to ensure that the application and decision process will be efficient and predictable, so applicants have clear objectives and timely decisions.\n\nSince the scope of the opportunities will be quite broad - from more technical matters to marketing activities - we’ll strive to bring in committee members with diverse backgrounds.\n\nThe grants program should be administered by a single lead.\n\nHere I propose myself, having led most of the growth efforts to this point.\n\nThe other 5 committee members should be thought of as “reviewers” — Indexed community members who will keep the grants program functional by ensuring I am leading effectively and, of course, not absconding with funds.\n\nPart of the reviewers job is to hold the program accountable for success (defined below) and/or return any excess funds to the Indexed treasury.  Reviewers are also encouraged to bring their own ideas to the table and contribute to Indexed's growth.\n\nReviewers are not compensated as part of this proposal as we expect their time commitment to be minimal. Compensation for the lead role is discussed below, as we expect this to be a labor intensive role.\n\nReviewers:\n1) Fabian Spiegelberger\n2) DBuck\n3) Gregoire Le Jeune\n4) Jeddi\n5) Jascha Samadi\n\nMethodology\n1.1 Budget\nThis proposal recommends a max cap of US$100,000 + 10,000 NDX per quarter, with the ability to reevaluate biannually at each epoch (two fiscal quarters). While the IGC will be the decision makers around individual grants, respective budgets, roadmaps, and milestones, any top-level changes to the IGC including epochs and max cap, will require full community quorum (4% approval).\n\nThe IGC will be funded by the Indexed treasury according to the release schedule set out by the Indexed team.\n\n1.2 Grant Application Process\nGrant applications to the IGC need to be submitted publicly in the forum. We will create a new “Grant” category for this purpose which is where all applications need to be submitted. Applications must be well-written and contain all the relevant information such as price, scope of the proposal, timeline, benefits etc. so that the committee and the community have all the information at hand.\n\nIn rare circumstances, if the committee reaches out proactively to a service provider and wants to keep it private for competitive reasons, it is acceptable to publish the proposal afterwards.\n\n1.3 Committee Compensation\nOperating a successful grants program takes considerable time and effort.\n\nThe lead should be compensated for their time. The reviewers will not be compensated for their time as we project that the commitment will be minimal to start (2-5hrs).\n\nWe propose the lead be compensated US$75/hr capped at 10 hours/week. This compensation, along with the quarterly budget, will be allocated to the IGC multisig from the NDX treasury. In keeping with the committee’s commitment to the community, hours and duties will be logged publicly and transparently.\n\n2.1 Priorities\nInitially, the program aims to start narrow in scope, funding peripheral ecosystem initiatives, such as targeted bounties, education material, tooling & dashboards, media sponsorships, and other low-stakes means of building out the Indexed brand & ecosystem. Over time, if the program proves effective, the grant allocations can grow in scope to include, for example, listings on centralized exchanges, integrations into other dApps and eventually core protocol development.\n\n2.2 KPIS\nWith the initial priorities in mind, some effective measures for quick successes might look like:\n\nTotal number of initiatives funded\n\nQuarterly increase in applications\n\nProject engagement post-event/funding (no of holders, TVL etc.)\n\nOverall community engagement/sentiment\n\n2.3 Timeline\nThe grants program will be managed on a quarterly basis and reviews every two quarters.\n\nAfter each quarter the program will be required to submit progress and the committee will be required to report on key metrics to the community.\n\nConclusion\nIf a team of qualified reviewers are found and there are no major objections from the community this will move to a vote on Snapshot. If the proposal passes on Snapshot, the committee will be created and IGC will start accepting applications on a rolling basis starting April 2021.\n\nThis program is meant to be the simplest possible MVP of a Indexed Ecosystem Grants initiative. While the multi-sig committee comes with trust assumptions about the members, our hope is the community will approve this limited engagement to get the ball rolling in an efficient structure. After the two quarters the burden of proof will be on IGC to show empirical evidence that the program is worth continuing in its existing form and will submit to governance to renew treasury funding.",

      "content": "Author: Dr Laurence E. Day\n\nEdited by Dillon Kellar\n\nApproved Snapshot Vote\n\nhttps://snapshot.page/#/ndx.eth/proposal/QmNsJoELGNFWfQDptpmexeHQy1bmKhBzPe76deG9v5J3fA\n\nDiscussion Thread\n\nhttps://forum.indexed.finance/t/proposal-stopgap-staking-reward-schedule/471\n\n---\n\nAs you're all aware, staking rewards have ended for the following pools:\n\n* DEFI5\n* DEFI5-ETH Uniswap LP\n* CC10\n* CC10-ETH Uniswap LP\n\nInsofar as getting NDX distributed for the purposes of diluting power from the founders goes, this was a success. However, now that this is done, we're faced with a dilemma:\n\na) We don't want to completely cut short incentivisation for liquidity providers - it's an effective way of buffering against impermanent loss, but...\nb) Handing out 25% of our maximum supply every three months is, in every sense of the word, unsustainable.\n\nWe're also in the unfortunate situation whereby the ORCL5 pool has *zero* incentivisation beyond it's USP of being the only aggregate instrument for exposure to that particular market sector, which - if we take TVL as the metric of choice - is not enough.\n\nMembers of the Sigma committee and the core team are currently working on a proposal for a longer term, dynamic reward emission schedule parameterised over TVL on a per-index basis, which we intend to `solve' this problem over a period of years rather than months. The first sighting of this idea in the wild is [here](https://forum.indexed.finance/t/future-emission-schedule-the-technical-side/379), but it is not ready for consideration.\n\n---\n\nTo this end, I'm making the following proposal, in the hopes that we can fast-track it into action if it's agreeable.\n\n## Action Points\n\n* Allocate 100,000 NDX from the DAO treasury for a _one-month_ continued emission schedule, split as follows:\n  * [50,000 NDX] DEFI5-ETH Uniswap LP\n  * [40,000 NDX] CC10-ETH Uniswap LP\n  * [10,000 NDX] ORCL5-ETH Uniswap LP\n\n* Begin emissions for these new reward pools to minimise the amount of time that we're `off-road'.\n\n* End the `pure' DEFI5 and CC10 pools upon expiry. Their purpose (fast dissemination of NDX) has been served.\n\n* Deduct this 100,000 NDX from whatever amount we determine the longer-term final allocation to be (i.e. if we allocate 2.5 million NDX over a two year period, we'd initialise with 2.4 million instead).\n  * As a case in point, if those were the numbers we ended up using, we'd be handing out ~104,000 NDX per month anyway, so this is a stopgap in the truest sense of the word.\n\n## Transactions\n\n1. Create staking rewards pool for ORCL5-ETH Uniswap LP tokens, with 10,000 NDX over 30 days.\n2. Set the duration on the DEFI5-ETH staking pool to 30 days.\n3. Set the duration on the CC10-ETH staking pool to 30 days.\n4. Set the reward amount on the DEFI5-ETH staking pool to 50,000 NDX.\n5. Set the reward amount on the CC10-ETH staking pool to 40,000 NDX.",

      "content": "Discussion Thread: https://forum.indexed.finance/t/proposal-update-access-control-for-proxy-manager-pool-factory/422\n\n## Summary\n\nThe final step required to enable the Sigma program is to grant the Sigma committee limited access over two existing contracts - the pool factory and the proxy manager.\n\n### Motivation\n\nIn order to build out new pools for the Sigma program, we will need many new smart contracts, most of which will likely be used more than once. We already have a system in place for deploying proxies and handling upgrades, but it only allows the Indexed timelock to add new base implementations or approve new pool controllers. Since the purpose of the Sigma program is to speed up the pace of development, we should allow the Sigma committee to execute certain functions on the existing contracts, rather than complicate our architecture by setting up a myriad of new factories.\n\n# Access Control Changes\n\nThis proposal will transfer ownership of the pool factory and the proxy manager to separate access control contracts. These new contracts simply define a new administrator role, which is then granted access over specific functions. The Indexed timelock will still be the owner of these access control contracts and will have the sole authority to grant and revoke administrator access.\n\nBelow are the new privileges that will exist for the admin and owner roles. All admin privileges are shared by the owner.\n\n## Proxy Manager\n\n**Admin Privileges**\n- Deploy new one-to-one proxies\n- Deploy new many-to-one proxies\n- Add new many-to-one implementation contracts\n- Grant many-to-one deployment access to contracts\n\n**Owner Privileges**\n- Modify & lock one-to-one proxy implementations\n- Modify & lock many-to-one proxy implementations\n- Transfer ownership of the proxy manager\n- Revoke many-to-one deployment access from contracts\n- Grant admin role\n- Revoke admin role\n\n## Pool Factory\n\n**Admin Privileges**\n- Grant deployment access to contracts.\n\n**Owner Privileges**\n- Revoke deployment access from contracts.\n- Grant admin role\n- Revoke admin role\n- Transfer ownership of the pool factory\n\n## Deployments\n\nPool Factory Access Control \n<https://etherscan.io/address/0xb8fdBd8D10b394f85F777969564b6D49D6EbAAA2#code>\n\nProxy Manager Access Control \n<https://etherscan.io/address/0x3D4860d4b7952A3CAD3Accfada61463F15fc0D54#code>\n\nFor both of these, I deployed the access control contract, added the Sigma committee's multisig as an administrator, then transferred ownership to the Indexed timelock.",

      "content": "Approved Sigma Proposal: https://gov.indexed.finance/#/ndx.eth/proposal/QmbneygJdeXFNzxrtVw7CTZAgLUwPBfxrCBzucefuWC1Q8\n\nCommittee Selection Poll: https://forum.indexed.finance/t/sigma-committee-selection-poll/205\n\nDiscussion Thread: https://forum.indexed.finance/t/transfer-600-000-ndx-to-sigma-committee-timelock/403\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal will begin the Sigma pilot program approved by the community by transferring the 600,000 NDX to the committee timelock detailed in the original Sigma proposal.\n\n## Timelock Overview\nThe committee timelock will hold 600,000 NDX, and will allow the Sigma committee to allocate rewards for new liquidity mining programs.\n\nAs detailed in the original proposal, the timelock allows the Sigma committee to assign staking rewards while ensuring that Indexed governance is able to replace the committee, reclaim the allocated tokens or veto specific allocations.\n\nThe timelock allows the Sigma committee's Gnosis safe to queue token transfers, which will be delayed for 7 days before executing. This gives Indexed governance the ability to assess allocations and veto them if desired. The timelock also allows Indexed governance to replace the Sigma committee or reclaim the remaining tokens.\n\nCommittee Timelock Contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x9BF4bE02414568eb481F448149432c6863737966\n\nCommittee Gnosis Safe: https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xBb22A47842EaFc967213269280509A8B28e57076\n\n## Code Review\nA code review was conducted by Daniel Luca and Andrei Simion over the course of 3 days to evaluate the overall access control system, the committee timelock and committee proxy contracts, and some minor changes to other proxy contracts which will be used for the next pool controller.\n\nThe review found one medium issue, three minor issues and one informational issue. The medium issue involved the voting period on GovernorAlpha and user expectations about when a proposal would finish; we'll resolve this by adding links to block countdowns on Etherscan to the governance proposal pages. The minor issues had to do with external event tracking & readability, and they were addressed with small contract updates. The informational issue was considered expected behavior and was not addressed.\n\nThe full code review can be found here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monoceros-alpha/review-indexed-sigmacommittee-2021-02/master/Report.pdf\n\n## Committee Members\n\nThe members of the committee are:\n\n| Forum Username | Appointed By | Address |\n|------|---------------|----------|\n| @d1ll0n | Team | 0x236ECcAB8cdcfEDb099dE85c4060024bA3cE4d46 |\n| @litocoen | Team | 0x330F1997C9bBC66bE5f1A3B0f2F6403051Ea57Be |\n| @Norsefire | Community | 0x000000000057E8ABd581828A2b40076852C0bA6E |\n| @Strategy | Community | 0x2c87C3ac0DE22076eca02dB7C66938fCAcB7035e |\n| @blurr | Community | 0xef764BAC8a438E7E498c2E5fcCf0f174c3E3F8dB |\n",

      "content": "Approved Snapshot Vote: https://gov.indexed.finance/#/ndx.eth/proposal/QmdVmMefXUAUqU1xgfjeUie4o4Ud4cqFKwyABaQSBnQNG9\n\nDiscussion Thread: https://forum.indexed.finance/t/oracle-top-5-token-index-proposal/89\n\n# Summary\n\nCreate a new category for medium cap oracle tokens and deploy ORCL5 index with an initial price of 0.01 ETH.\n\n# Category Criteria\n\nThis category has the following criteria for inclusion:\n1. The token is at least 30 days old.\n2. No major vulnerabilities have been discovered in the token contract.\n3. The token's supply can not be arbitrarily inflated or deflated maliciously.\n\t- The control model should be considered if the supply can be modified through governance decisions.\n4. The token does not have transfer fees or other non-standard balance updates.\n5. The token meets the requirements of the [ERC20 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20).\n\t- Boolean return values are not required.\n6. The token has a fully diluted market cap of at least $40 million.\n7. At least $500k worth of liquidity is held in the Uniswap market pair between the token and WETH.\n8. The token is either a protocol or governance token for an Ethereum-based oracle project.\n\n### Terms\n**Fully Diluted Market Cap:** Market price of one token in USD multiplied by the token's total supply.\n\n**Protocol Token:** A token used for some core aspect of a system, such as payment for services within a protocol or rewarding users maintaining a network.\n\n**Governance Token:** A token used to vote on governance decisions for a project.\n\n**Oracle:** A system used to provide information from off-chain or on-chain components, for use by on-chain smart contracts as feeds or information sources.\n\n### Index Naming Scheme\nIndices deployed for this category should use the following naming scheme for the ERC20 name and symbol:\n\n**Symbol:** `ORCL` + Index Size\n\n**Name:** `Oracle Top `  + Index Size + ` Tokens Index`\n\n**Example**\n\nIndex Size: 5\n\nSymbol: `ORCL`\n\nName: `Oracle Top 5 Tokens Index`\n\n# Actions\n\n1. Create a new category on MarketCapSqrtController with the metadata hash for the Oracle category criteria.\n2. Add the following tokens to the category:\n    - LINK, UMA, BAND, ORAI, API3, DIA, DOS, TRB\n3. Order category tokens by fully diluted market cap.\n4. Prepare an index pool for the new category with:\n    - Index Size: 5\n    - Name: Oracle Top 5 Tokens Index\n    - Symbol: ORCL5\n    - Initial ETH Value: 1",

      "title": "IIP 4: Sigma Pilot",
      "content": "**Authors:** Dillon Kellar, Lito Coen\n\nDiscussion: https://forum.indexed.finance/t/iip-4-sigma-pilot/74\n\nIn the past weeks, we have received many suggestions from within our community and on social media for new indices and other pool management strategies. Many of these are good candidates for the core index pools, which track well-defined market sectors on Ethereum. Others are more speculative, have less well defined criteria, involve new portfolio structures or methodologies, or track smaller cap tokens which are too risky for the current indexing strategy.\n\nWe want to enable new use-cases for the Indexed protocol and experiment with new management strategies, but it is important that we maintain a high degree of objectivity in the management of our core indices and that they be subject to minimal risk.\n\nRather than wait for further development of the protocol that will enable greater public access to deployment of pools or more modular portfolio structures, we believe a new program should be created to facilitate involvement from other communities and increase the pace of innovation for the Indexed protocol.\n\n# Sigma\n\nSigma is a new program aimed at creating innovative index products on our platform and bringing liquidity to these indices. Sigma will allow investors, financial experts and DeFi communities to collaborate with Indexed to develop new indices and other passive portfolios with custom criteria and methodologies.\n\nA pilot program will run from February to May with an allocation of 600,000 NDX from the Indexed treasury. These tokens will be used to incentivize liquidity on the new pools so that we can accurately gauge their performance and encourage new people to use the platform.\n\n### Applications\n\nDuring the sigma pilot program, a section of the forum will be dedicated to new applications. Anyone will be able to submit a request here for a set of tokens to track, an index with custom methodology, or a different kind of automated portfolio manager altogether.\n\nApplications must include:\n\n1. The criteria for inclusion if the pool will track a general market sector, or the list of tokens which will be included if not.\n\n2. The methodology to be used, if it is not an index pool with capitalization-root-weighting.\n\n3. The portfolio structure to be used, if it will not use the index pool contract.\n\nA 5 member committee will manage the Sigma program, with 2 members appointed by the core team and 3 members appointed through NDX governance. This committee will be responsible for setting application rules, judging applications and deploying approved pools. NDX holders will retain the ability to replace the committee through a governance proposal.\n\nApplications will be judged using several factors, including but not limited to:\n\n- Quality of the proposal, including clarity of the criteria and methodology.\n- Interest level of the Indexed community.\n- Amount of liquidity that will be committed to initialize the pool.\n- Feasibility of implementing the methodology, if custom.\n\n### New Pools\n\nPools which use a methodology different from the current pools will be supported by new keeper jobs where necessary so that they remain autonomous.\n\nFor pools which track market sectors rather than specific tokens, the committee will be responsible for submitting updates to the tokens list.\n\nFor pools which use the IndexPool contract or otherwise act as AMMs, if small-cap tokens are allowed by the criteria they will be required to support circuit breakers, which will be detailed in an upcoming proposal.\n\nPools in the Sigma program will have a 0.5% exit fee, which will be charged whenever the pools' LP tokens are burned. These fees will go to the Indexed treasury to help offset the costs incurred from liquidity mining and keeper rewards.\n\nFor pools with custom methodology or portfolio structures, a code audit must be published prior to deployment.\n\n### Rewards\n\nThe committee will determine rewards based on criteria such as liquidity committed by the applicants, the interest of the Indexed community in the new pool and the uniqueness of the pool relative to other DeFi projects and existing pools from Indexed. When rewards are assigned, a seven day timelock will begin prior to releasing the NDX. Indexed governance will have the ability to veto the allocation through a standard governance proposal.\n\nPools will be incentivized through liquidity mining of the pool tokens and LP tokens for their market pairs. All rewards allocated will be distributed over a 90 day period.\n\n-------------------------\nIf this proposal meets a total of 50,000 votes cast on Snapshot with a majority in favor, an on-chain proposal will be created when the Snapshot proposal is complete.",

      "title": "IIP 3: Enable Meta-Governance for COMP-Like Tokens",
      "content": "# Indexed Improvement Proposal 3: Enable Meta-Governance for COMP-Like Tokens\n\nDiscussion\nhttps://forum.indexed.finance/t/iip-3-enable-meta-governance-for-comp-like-tokens/56\n\nAuthor: Dillon Kellar\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal would enable NDX holders to vote with the COMP & UNI held by any index pool. Support for other governance tokens that support delegation will follow as the contracts are developed.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe two indices which currently exist are DEFI5 and CC10. These 2 pools collectively hold 285k UNI and 7.3k COMP.  These are not quite enough tokens to make a large difference in proposals based on current levels of participation in these protocols, but in the future this may change, and we do not want to contribute to voter apathy in other on-chain networks.\n\nBecause these governance tokens allow delegation of voting power, it is possible to use them to vote even while they are held by the index pools. Index tokens do not support the necessary balance snapshots to allow LPs to vote with these tokens in a secure manner, but they can be delegated to meta-governance contracts where NDX holders can determine how to cast votes on UNI and COMP proposals.\n\nThis would both make our protocol a better member of the ecosystem by increasing participation in on-chain governance and increase the value proposition of NDX token itself, which would likely encourage governance participation for our own community. Additionally, it would help compensate the NDX treasury for rewards paid to keepers who keep the pools updated.\n\n## Meta Governance Contracts\n\nWe will utilize two new \"meta governance\" contracts. These are contracts modeled on GovernorAlpha, the governance contract used by NDX, COMP, UNI and several other projects, which allow NDX holders to vote on \"meta proposals\" which are proposals for how the delegated votes should be cast on external proposals for Uniswap or Compound governance.\n\nWe will use one contract for each governance token - this proposal adds MetaGovernorCOMP and MetaGovernorUNI, which use the same template.\n\nThe code for these contracts can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/indexed-finance/governance/tree/master/contracts/meta\n\n## Proxy Updates\n\nIn order to support delegation of COMP-like tokens, the proxy implementations for `MarketCapSqrtController` and `IndexPool` must be updated to allow governance to tell the index pools to delegate their voting power to the meta governor contracts.\n\nThe primary challenge with this is handling the different governance interfaces. For COMP-based tokens such as UNI and COMP, it is quite simple to enable this feature. For other tokens, we will need to create more specific contracts & delegation functions to enable meta governance. This proposal would enable support only for COMP-based tokens, with other delegation-enabled tokens to follow.\n\nThe contracts have been updated on github with the modifications described below.\n\n**MarketCapSqrtController**\n\nAdd `delegateCompLikeTokenFromPool` which is only callable by the NDX timelock. This function takes the address of an index pool, the address of the token to delegate, and the address of the delegatee, and calls `delegateCompLikeToken` on the index pool.\n\nhttps://github.com/indexed-finance/indexed-core/pull/65/commits/06ab7cb677e5b3780e435c58475d9cbb1ec1ebdc\n\n**IndexPool**\n\nAdd `delegateCompLikeToken` which is only callable by the controller. This function takes the address of the token to delegate and the address of the meta governor to delegate to, then calls the `delegate` function on the token to delegate to the governor.\n\nhttps://github.com/indexed-finance/indexed-core/pull/65/commits/dae7f231d0f58bfc0993f6c01199cd6b74b01895\n\n## Audit & Approval\n\nDaniel Luca will be auditing the new meta governance contract beginning on Sunday, January 24. If this proposal reaches a quorum of 50,000 votes on Snapshot with majority approval, the on-chain contracts will be deployed and an on-chain proposal will be created to execute this proposal once Daniel has completed the audit and any issues that come up are addressed.",
