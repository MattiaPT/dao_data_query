      "content": "### Background\n\nThis proposal follows several passed proposals from the last month to reduce USD/USDB prizes, follows a proposal to reduce DAO spend by $20,000/month, and follows a proposal to reduce wearable rewards... all in the name of improving casino profitability. It also specifically follows the \"Direct Gold Incentive for $BAG\" proposal that was passed in August.\n\nTHIS IS ALSO BEING POSTED AS A CONCURRENT ALTERNATIVE TO: https://vote.bag.win/#/proposal/0x668d2f8b9894b71bcbbfa8604ae334c842d733b7e88b07a0e7bb0f0c709161da\n\n### Proposal\n\n(1) Effective immediately (October) stop allocating a percentage of our Gold allocation to $BAG holding; instead, allocate all of it to incentivizing gameplay.\n\n(2) Effective after 10/13, pause competitions. Keep them paused until we support competitions in bag.win (mobile). Then, competitions return with the current prize structure + a Gold amt T.B.D. by the team.\n\n### Rationale\n\n(1) With other projects entering and other projects getting promoted, we have seen our Gold allocation decline month-to-month (229K (Aug) --> 214K (Sep) --> 185K (Oct)). While we do think we can and will get 2x this amount soon by getting a dApp ranking of Gold, that is not guaranteed. We should be more judicious about allocating Gold to incentivize gameplay and onboarding. Additionally, at ~50 Gold per 1M BAG, we don't believe this is a significant driver of BAG purchasing/holding. Improving profitability will increase the DAO's purchases of $BAG.\n\n(2) Our focus is not on Decentraland at the moment. It's on onboarding, mobile, and Bag City. We can reduce USD/USDB emissions by ~$1,000/competition while these are paused and then use competitions as a lever to bring users into mobile once they are added there later this quarter.",

Here is the link if you need to read up on the changes proposed: https://vote.bag.win/#/proposal/0x7df1eb789abd9e9f20d4a182289a28202dfbc9503400e9b26a392b179219e400\n\nWe’ve been in very long discussions with folks who have voiced their opinions to explore alternative solutions (including GR) to address the misalignment of incentives identified in the proposal, and with our product and engineering team to evaluate the development lift. The future of premium wearable rewards has been one of the most difficult decisions we’ve had to consider since founding the project in 2019. While we want to improve long-term incentive alignment, we do not want to derail our existing ambitious and exciting Bag.win product roadmap given the current opportunities in the market.\n\nThere are a few key pieces with regards to our “endgame” state that I think we should review before debating the path to get there.\n\n- We had already planned to integrate SNGs into Bag.win\n     - Add buy-in and prize in Casino USD balance\n     - Share player liquidity between the two (Arcade and Bag.win)\n- We have and will continue to move away from Decentraland (and subsequently Polygon) as we launch our own 3D world Bag City and become a bigger player in the Blast ecosystem (with more Blast Gold rewards for gameplay and holding BAG)\n\nIn order to align the community long-term and invest development time into valuable features that drive maximum appeal and growth, we need a new simplified rewards system based primarily around gameplay \n\n### Proposal\n\nWith this endgame in mind, we saw 3 tenable scenarios to get there:\n\n#### Option 1 - End Premium Wearable Program Immediately, Launch New Rewards System around Gameplay\n\n- Fully terminate the Premium Wearable Program immediately.\n- Take a snapshot of all current Premium Wearable holders October 1 to add a 6-month boost upon launching a new rewards system around gameplay and BAG Tiers.\n- Redesign a rewards system around playing in Bag City and boosted by holding BAG to replace premium wearables rewards on March 1, 2025.\n\n#### Option 2 - Gradual Reduction of Premium Wearable Rewards, Launch New Rewards System around Gameplay \n\n- Keep Bonus USD as a wearables reward option. \n- Reduce all Premium Wearable rewards by 25% starting October 1, by another 25% December 1, and end all premium wearable rewards March 1, 2025 upon launch of a new player rewards program. \n- Remove tedious updates to Pot Bonus and Tickets outlined in the original proposal.\n- Reduce baseline Pot Bonus rewards by 30%. \n- Take a snapshot of all current Premium Wearable holders March 1 to add a 6-month boost upon launching a new rewards system around gameplay and BAG Tiers.\n- Redesign a rewards system around playing in Bag City and boosted by holding BAG to replace premium wearables rewards on March 1, 2025.\n\n#### Option 3 - Reduce Bonus USD Rewards Option, Drive SNG Player Liquidity for launch of Bag.win SNGs, Transition Polygon Decentraland NFTs to New Native Assets\n\n- Remove tedious updates to Pot Bonus and Tickets outlined in the original proposal \n- Reduce baseline Pot Bonus rewards by 30%. \n- Reduce Bonus USD rewards for premium wearables by 75%.\n- Reduce Ticket Rewards and Pot Bonus Rewards by 30% to incentivize player liquidity, particularly with the upcoming Bag.win SNGs launch. \n- Give the team the ability to maintain or reduce rewards after evaluating the data from the Bag.win SNG rollout to ensure we are not spending more per month that we did before the changes.\n- Transition Polygon Decentraland NFTs to new native assets on a chain of team’s choosing (Target Q1 2025).",

This is the moment to adjust them accordingly to a new reward system based on BAG tier. \n\nIf option 3 passes, this proposal serves slightly to amend/complement it.\n\n### Proposal\n\n\"Reduce Bonus USD rewards for premium wearables by 75%.\nReduce Ticket Rewards and Pot Bonus Rewards by 30% to\" -option3\n\nUse BAG tier as a multiplier to the rewards. \n\nOption 3 aims to set SNG/POT at 70% and Bonus at 25%\n\n#### Set rewards for SNG between 60%-80% and Bonus 20%-40%. Where the difference is decided by the tier each wallet has.\nSomeone tier10 will get 80% of the current sng tickets, and someone with no bag would get 60%.\n\nAllow team to slightly change the % depending on the actual results as time progresses, as not to necessarily increase expenses, but keeping the overall idea that an higher tier will earn more rewards from the NFTs.\n\nIn case they dont currently have, also give team permission to adjust the tier values to better reflecte desired outcomes.\n\n### Rationale\n\nWe have a perfect opportunity to change rewards without creating a drama (more drama). Therefore this is the moment to adjust it. When we adjust the rewards to the tier, we are rewarding the \"correct\" people. We reward those who not only own nfts but who also invest in BAG and hold BAG.\n\nThis will also creates a demand for people to purchase and hold BAG. Thus being aligned with the success of the token. NFT holders will wish and actively seek BAG price to go up, as some will buy and hold BAG in order to get higher rewards. To offset any additional rewards some nft holders will gain from holding BAG, owners who dont own BAG see their rewards lower in comparison. \n\nIf they wish to receive more rewards, then they go and buy more BAG, and if everyone who has NFTs actually go and buy BAG and hold BAG, that's a very positive sign. And an \"expense\" worth having.",

      "title": "Enhancing Financial Sustainability and Further Team Transparency in BAG DAO",
      "content": "###Background\n\nBAG DAO aims to optimize financial management to ensure long-term sustainability and improve financial planning. The current monthly expenditure of the DAO has been recognized as a major component that needs strategic adjustments to extend our operational runway. Additionally, there is a lack of transparency regarding team composition, which can hinder governance and community understanding of where resources are allocated.\n\n###Proposal\n\nMonthly Burn Adjustment\nThe monthly operational burn will be reduced from $230,000 to $210,000, resulting in a $20,000 decrease. This adjustment aims to optimize expenditures while ensuring that the critical functions of the organization are unaffected.\n\nCreation of Governance Channel: \"Team-Composition\"\nA new governance channel named \"Team-Composition\" will be established to provide greater transparency into our organizational structure. This channel will contain:\n\nA list of all team members categorized by their respective areas such as CEO, Development, Project Management (PM), DevOps, Quality Assurance (QA), Support, Design, Community Management (CM), and Operations.\n\nInformation on the budget allocation for each team area, without exposing individual salaries for privacy purposes.\nThe detailed spending per team area that has multiple members will be indicated at the discretion of each department, allowing a balance between transparency and individual privacy.\n\n###Rationale\n\nImproving Financial Health\nBy reducing our monthly burn rate by $20,000, BAG DAO will benefit from extended financial runway, providing greater stability during times of market volatility. This step ensures efficient use of funds while continuing to support essential operations. It also reflects a commitment to more sustainable financial planning, allowing the DAO to focus resources on growth and future investments.\n\nEnhanced Transparency with \"Team-Composition\" Channel\nThe creation of the \"Team-Composition\" channel will improve the clarity around team structure and resource distribution. By sharing this information, community members will gain a deeper understanding of how the DAO's human capital is organized, fostering greater trust and better governance practices. The discretion provided to each team for disclosing spending will ensure that while transparency is maintained, sensitive personal information, such as salaries, is protected.",

      "content": "### Background\n\nOver the last few quarters, we've continuously expanded the Bag.win game offerings, including the successful integration of slots, crash, plinko, blackjack, roulette, live casino, various other third-party games, and our original 3d immersive games. These additions have expanded our platform, appeal, and revenue streams considerably.  \n\nHowever, the growing interest in sports betting presents a new opportunity for Bag.win to further diversify and capitalize on this burgeoning market. Sports betting is a highly popular and rapidly growing segment within the online gaming industry, with a global market valued at over $200 billion. Incorporating a sportsbook would not only tap into this lucrative market but also align with our goal of providing a comprehensive gaming experience to our users.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe propose to allocate 15k EUR initiation and (2k EUR per month minimum fee plus 15% GGR) to add a sportsbook to the Bag.win platform by integrating services from a reputable third-party provider. This addition aims to offer users a seamless and comprehensive gaming experience, allowing them to engage in sports betting alongside existing games without the need for separate accounts or platforms.\n\n### Rationale\n\nAdding a sportsbook to Bag.Win aligns with our strategic goals and offers several benefits:\n\nEnhanced User Engagement: Diversifies the gaming options available, keeping users engaged and attracting a broader audience interested in sports betting.\n\nRevenue Diversification: Opens up a new revenue stream, reducing reliance on existing games and contributing to the platform's financial growth.\n\nMarket Competitiveness: Positions Bag.win as a more competitive and comprehensive gaming platform compared to others that do not offer sports betting at the start of American Football season.\n\nCommunity Demand: Addresses requests from our user community for more diverse gaming options, specifically sports betting.\n\nLeveraging Expertise: By partnering with an established provider, Bag.win can offer a high-quality sportsbook without the significant time and resource investment required to develop one in-house.\n\nThe integration of a sportsbook is a strategic enhancement to the Bag.win platform that delivers value to users. It expands our gaming portfolio, meets user demand, and positions us competitively in the online gaming market.",

We still hold > 750 LANDs that are worth ~0.1 ETH each (see: OpenSea). Other than Tominoya and ICE CITY, we are not making productive use of this LAND. See Map below.\n\n### Proposal\n\nGive the team discretion to sell Treasury LAND that land is not being used productively; defer to the team on the tranches of LAND to prioritize and timing to spread out sales. Then, sale proceeds will be periodically converted to $BAG.\n\n### Rationale\n\nGiven Decentraland’s declining player numbers, we do not expect the demand for LAND to increase.

      "title": "Enhance Token Marketing and Reduce Circulating Supply",
      "content": "### Background\nCurrently, BAG DAO allocates 100% of weekly casino profits to purchasing wBTC. We use the wBTC as collateral to borrow 30%, which is then utilized to buy back BAG tokens. This strategy has allowed us to accumulate wBTC and maintain liquidity while also reducing the circulating supply of BAG.\n\n### Proposal\nI propose to increase the percentage of borrowed funds used for BAG buybacks from 30% to 50%. This means that 50% of the value of the wBTC collateral will be borrowed and directed towards repurchasing BAG tokens.\nAdditionally, we will give discretion to the team to execute the buybacks on any day of the week, rather than being restricted to Mondays. This flexibility will prevent upfront purchases and allow the team to take advantage of more favorable market conditions. The team may also choose to split the buybacks over two or more days within the same week if deemed beneficial. All buyback actions will be logged on the corresponding transparency channels to ensure accountability.\n\n### Rationale\nBAG's current price is significantly undervalued compared to its intrinsic value and long-term potential. This presents a strategic opportunity to remove a substantial portion of the circulating supply at a discount, enhancing the value of remaining tokens.\nMoreover, token price plays a critical role in shaping the market perception of our project. A healthy and stable token price serves as a powerful marketing tool, creating positive first impressions and signaling strength to both current and potential investors. As the token price has recently suffered, increasing buybacks will help stabilize and strengthen BAG's price, benefiting the entire ecosystem.",

      "title": "Utilize Premium Wearables to Achieve Round-the-Clock Player Liquidity in Poker",
      "content": "**BACKGROUND**\n\nPlayer liquidity is reflexive and crucial in online poker rooms because it ensures that games are always available, attracting and retaining players by offering a variety of formats and stakes. \n\nHigh player liquidity results in high game availability and instant full tables that deliver an optimal experience for players and brings them back to the platform → drives more player liquidity and ongoing revenue for the platform. \n\nLow player liquidity leaves players hanging with low game availability and long wait times for a subpar first experience that does not attract them back to the platform → results in less player liquidity and less revenue for the platform. \n\nPoker players also spill over to other casino games because a large, active player base often explores other games offered by the platform such as slots and other table games, driving additional revenue.\n\nPremium Wearables (previously ‘Ice Poker Wearables’) have earned rewards for more than 3 years. Initially, there was a P2E mechanism where they earned via active participation in ICE Poker; later, by passing a DAO proposal and after the Arcade and Casino each went live, they began earning Bonus USD, Tickets, or Pot Bonus. Today, Pot Bonus rates are under a 2x promotion. Pot Bonus is calibrated such that the amount was too high and the rate at which it was delivered was too slow. \n\n\n**PROPOSAL**\n\n- Set the following weekly Baseline rewards per Premium Wearable: $1.25 Pot Bonus Or 3 SNG tickets. (1 + [Wearable %]) multiplier still applies as-is across levels. With the following rules:\n\n  - Pot Bonus unlocks 4x faster vs. today (12% of each pot with 4BB max)\n  - Max stakes of $25NL for Pot Bonus\n  - 3 minimum players must be at the table to accrue Pot Bonus rewards\n  - 4 maximum players at a table may be playing with Pot Bonus rewards (5th player gets joined to new table). This way, new players can always have a seat available.\n  - Player only earns a maximum amount of Tickets given how much they used the prior week\n\n- Give the BAG Team discretion to (1) to set caps if claims are unbalanced (all tickets or all Pot Bonus) and (2) reduce the rate at which Pot Bonus unlocks.\n\n- Remove Bonus USD as a weekly reward option for Premium Wearables\n\n\n**VISION**\n\nPremium Wearables add the most value to our ecosystem if they are widely distributed between players that love to play lower stakes online poker.\n\nWe obtain a balance where we are giving rewards and in return receiving player liquidity in games where it is valuable for net new players.\n\n\n**RATIONALE**\n\nWe are currently in the growth phase for our 3D Poker Room and Immersive Casino, and to ensure the success of our unique poker offering, it's essential that we bootstrap player liquidity effectively. Every week we are spending a large amount of funds on our Premium Wearables but these spendings are not contributing directly to the success of our casino. \n\nThe spending of funds on Premium Wearables should be a win/win both for the casino as for the Premium Wearable holders. Adjusting the rewards to provide player liquidity aligns incentives for casino spendings and rewards for Premium Wearable holders. Limiting the maximum buy-in for Rewards ensures that we always enjoy a longer period of time of player liquidity and that we build player liquidity from the ground up.\n\nPot Bonus earnings are made more attractive vs. Tickets (which are unchanged). The higher value is appropriate because players also risk their own funds playing crypto poker to earn Pot Bonus. You’re earning 4x more quickly, and, at $1.25 baseline ($1.00 in value after rake), the EV is more attractive than 3 Tickets (~$0.75). Example: \n\n\n- Current: 6% of pot in a 25NL table (4% rake) – $5 pot, that's $0.30 in Pot Bonus; $0.20 in Rake; $0.10 value\n- Proposed: At 12% of pot in a 25NL table (4% rake) – $5 pot, that's $0.60 in Pot Bonus; $0.20 in Rake; $0.40 value",

      "title": "Direct Gold Incentive for $BAG",
      "content": "### Background\n\nIn Blast Phase 1, we had $BAG Tiers apply to Gold earned from gameplay in addition to cashback, referral bonus, and rakeback reward. Then, this was removed Blast asked projects to remove incentives for native assets for Phase 2. \n\nHowever, on August 7th, Blast said “now, projects can allocate gold towards assets (pending review from the blast foundation).” Then, on August 12th, we passed the Tiers Multiplier Update to add these back. The proposal passed on August 16th and we asked the Blast Foundation to review. \n\nAs a part of that conversation over the last few days, their recommendation is to testing using a “direct incentive” instead. Their feedback was that directly incentivizing the holding of $BAG would achieve the same objective and be more efficient. \n\n### Proposal\n\nFor September distributions onwards, allocate a % of our total Blast Gold allocation to $BAG holders based on the following: \n\n-- Take 10% of current month Gold allocation (e.g. 228,000 → 22,800)\n-- Distribute 3.33% at a time in the last 3 full weeks of the month on Fridays (e.g. 9/13, 9/20, 9/27)\n-- To qualify for a given weekly distribution, one must have played T7 days (e.g. 9/6 - 9/12 for 9/13 distro)\n-- Snapshot each player's Blast $BAG holdings for 9/XX distribution on 9/XX. \n\nThis is simpler than it sounds... For example, if those people that played 9/6 - 9/12 had 100M $BAG on Blast in total and we were distributing 7,600 Gold (⅓ of 22,800) on 9/13, an individual qualifying player with 1M $BAG would get 76 Gold that week. They have 1% of the qualifying $BAG on Blast, so they get 1% of that week's Gold allocated to this initiative. \n\nAdditionally, on August 31st distribute our remaining August Gold balance (if any) to $BAG holders based on the exact same mechanism outlined above for future months. For the avoidance of doubt, to qualify, one must have played 8/24 - 8/30. \n\n### Rationale\n\nAs outlined in the Background section, Blast made the case for a direct incentive. It’s not something we had thought would be an option, but it’s certainly interesting. It’s also reasonable for us, as a DAO, to defer to the Blast Foundation’s judgment here and conduct an experiment to see how this performs. If it’s not successful, we can go back to Blast to make the case for a different approach.\n\nWe’re starting small and still prioritizing gameplay with ~90%. There is a trade-off between using Gold to incentivize new player onboarding, total player volume, and the holding of $BAG, but 10% of our current Gold allocation would be ~22.8K Gold which is comparable to the 25K Gold that projects in the new Culture Category received (e.g. Goldmilio, Wolves, New Blast City).",

      "title": "August Gold and Prizes",
      "content": "Background\n\nIt’s been a huge month for bag.win: We just achieved Silver from Blast (4xing out Gold distribution), we’ve launched more than 20 new third party games, and we kicked off a new leaderboard raffle. Given the opportunity we have to use gold in several different ways to incentivize gameplay and even the holding of our native assets (e.g. $BAG), it makes sense to revisit this distribution along with our prizes holistically. \n\nSee Appendix for initial August Baseline Gold Rates. These are live! These have gone up! \n\nNote: We plan to bring back tiering Gold earning rates based on $BAG Tier (as shown onsite). The new rate is T.B.D. and will be informed by the volume we see next week. \n\nProposal\n\n(1) Update the Daily Poker Rake Leaderboard to $150/day with prizes as follows. For [1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th], pay out [50, 40, 30, 20, 10] USDB. This is a decrease of $100/day, mostly by removing the 6th - 10th payouts. \n\n(2) Combine our two casino games volume leaderboards into a single Top 10; continue to pay out the $2,000/week Top 10 prizes from the Metaverse Volume Leaderboard to this new leaderboard. This update may be made as soon as week of 8/19 but depends on dev timelines.\n\n(3) For the new leaderboard, also raffle 5,000 Gold/week to 10 winners (500 each). This will follow the same logic as the existing raffle with 1K EUR volume → 1 Ticket.  \n\nRationale\n\n(1) With the improvement in Rake → Gold, particularly given the reintroduction of $BAG tiers, we expect to be able to grow player liquidity while reducing costs somewhat here. We would recalibrate if we don't see the increase in players we're expecting. \n\n(2) With our focus firmly on bag.win and Bag City, it doesn’t make sense for us to have a single, separate leaderboard dedicated to Decentraland. \n\n(3) Without reducing prizes guaranteed to the Top 10, we can reduce total USD cost by moving the raffle to Gold. We also wanted to make this Top 10 to get more people a pretty significant amount of Gold each! \n\nThe net result will be a $2,700/week (~= $11.5k/mon) improvement in profitability due to reduced USD outflows, all else held equal. \n\nAppendix – Volume/Rake per 1 Gold\n\nThird Party Games:\nUSDB: 25\nETH: 0.01\n\nRoulette:\nUSDB: 40\nETH: 0.015\nBAG: 40,000\n\nPlinko:\nUSDB: 80\nETH: 0.03\nBAG: 80,000\n\nBlackjack:\nUSDB: 160\nETH: 0.06\nBAG: 160,000\n\nPoker:\nUSDB: 0.8\nETH: 0.0003\nBAG: 700",

      "content": "Background\n\nIt’s been a huge month for bag.win: We just achieved Silver from Blast (4xing our Gold distribution), we’ve launched more than 30 new third party games, and we kicked off a new leaderboard raffle. We are focused on user acquisition, onboarding, and profitability.\n\nToday, $BAG Tiers run from Tier 0 to Tier 10 and generate multipliers of 1x - 3x across Cashback (5% - 15%) and Referral Bonuses (5% - 15%). In Phase 1, this also applied to Gold Earnings. This was removed last month when Blast announced that we could not incentivize native assets; however, they reversed that decision last week. \n\nProposal\n\n(1) Reinstate $BAG Tier Multipliers applying to Gold earning rates across all games. \n\n(2) Update Multipliers from 1x - 3x to 1x - 2x (e.g. Tier 0 gets 1x; Tier 6 gets 1.6x). \n\nRationale\n\n(1) In addition to governance, this is great utility for the $BAG token. We believe this was an effective, additional reason to buy/hold $BAG when we had this in place in Blast Phase 1. \n\n(2) The current Blast Gold rates are very generous and we cannot afford to allow people to earn at > 2x the baseline rate even if they have > 8M $BAG tokens. Even 1.5 - 2x will be a strong incentive to stack $BAG. This change will not alter the baseline Cashback or Referral Bonus rates but there will be some moderate savings as volumes scale up again from the diminished multipliers there. This provides us a bit more flexibility to continue spending in other areas.",

      "content": "### Background\n\nWe are about to go live with 3rd party games (e.g. slots, crash, plinko, blackjack, and roulette) on Bag.win. By next week (Week of July 29th), we will have volume leaderboards similar to what we have in our Decentraland casino today.\n\nToday, we spend approximately $16,000/month on metaverse volume leaderboards in Decentraland across the daily ($200/day) and weekly ($2,500/weekly) leaderboards to incentive engagement.\n\n### Proposal\n\nStarting July 29th:\n\n-- End Decentraland Daily Volume Leaderboard ($6,000/mon savings)\n-- Reduce Decentraland Weekly Volume Leaderboard to $2,000/week ($2,000/mon savings)\n-- Use the above $8,000/mon savings to fund $2,000/week bag.win Weekly Leaderboard\n\nThe Bag.win leaderboard would operate as follows:\n\n-- Each week, 5 raffle winners will get $400 each\n-- Raffle tickets are earned in proportion to volume\n-- Raffles will be drawn live on stream\n\n### Rationale\n\nDoes not reduce total volume rewards.\n\nOur development efforts this year have been almost entirely focused on our own platform, Bag.win. Over time, it will probably make sense to disproportionally incentivize our own native platform, but, to start, we will split our spend evenly between the two platforms.\n\nThe raffle structure will be a test. It's fun and adds some variance... someone with low volume still has a chance to win big! Additionally, based on our market research, the structure is fairly common:\n\n- Shuffle: Weekly raffle, entries based on volume\n- Stake: Weekly raffle, entries based on volume\n- Roobet: Monthly raffle, entries based on volume\n- BC.game: Weekly raffle, entries based on volume",

      "title": "Capital management",
      "content": "Background:  \nIn recent months BAGDAO implemented a 30% weekly buy back of BAG from profits by deploying WBTC & then borrowing to buy BAG with a probable outcome to re-circulate at a later date either by having to pay back loan if market takes a turn or via other initiatives. Since this has been implemented BAG has continued to mainly trend downwards with an increasing supply circulating, to date this is not working out too well despite the team delivering on the product and growing profits. BAG is really only interesting for people playing the games within the ecosystem. These days there are lots of different crypto investors & it would be wise to appeal to all of them including the bigger % of investors who would want to just hold BAG & collect from the success of the project. I believe with smart capital management BAG can be a win/ win to all involved & everyone can benefit from an ever rising price which is the cheapest & best form of marketing that can be done via coingecko etc. to ultimately attract more buyers/removal of available BAG & players to the gaming ecosystem. \n\nProposal moving forward:\n1: Retire 30% buy back.\n\n2: Create BAG Staking portal on Bagcoin.org with a 7 day unstaking period where 30% of weekly profits gets deposited in USDB on BLAST & distributed based on % of bag in the pool every 7 days. \n\n3: Dedicate another 10% of USDB weekly profits to buy back BAG & BURN them to DEAD wallet from the open market to be done up to 3 times per week at internal team discretion or days that make sense time wise or when crypto market down.\n\n4: Remaining 60% propose to save 30% via BLAST on Chain in ETH 20% & USDB 10% earning native yield whilst holding the other 30% in current WBTC \n\n5: Create \"BURN BAG\" buttons throughout the ecosystem. For example: in Cashback section in my account players can burn a % or all of there cashback rewards. Next to the tables during betting or after a win & just in random spots   in the metaverse rollout. ( no timeline)\n\n6: Create a mega monthly \"BAG/BLAST JACKPOT\"   where players can buy tickets to win BAG & BLAST GOLD.  Tickets can only be purchased in BAG with 30% of the bag BURNED.  ( no timeline)  \n\nHopefully we all think this is a step in the right direction in regards to demand & positive market pressure on BAG whilst rewarding everyone involved with added confidence, a clear return on Investment path and deflating metrics when people are considering filling up there BAGs for the long term!",

      "title": "Update Prizes and Bonuses",
      "content": "### Background\n\nThough we have growing DAU and Revenues, a well-funded Treasury, and will imminently ship Bag City and new 2D games (e.g. Slots, Crash), $BAG is down ~50% from launch to ~$0.0025. Our various prizes (detailed below) are a significant $BAG outlay that’s hard to justify at these levels. However, we think these prizes/programs are valuable and want to continue them. \n\nFor Tier 0 - 10, our Cashback and Referral Programs range from 10 - 30% each. These are the first and second largest variable expenses counted against Revenue. \n\n### Proposal\n\nMove the Metaverse Volume Leaderboards and the bag.win Rake Leaderboard from $BAG to USDB, but do not change the USD amounts or frequency of prizes.\n\nUpdate Casino Competition token prizes from $BAG to USDB, but maintain status quo leaving exact amounts and frequency up to the team’s discretion. \n\nHalve SNG Badge Leaderboard Prizes from $10K $BAG to $5K $BAG.\n\nUpdate Referral Bonus Rewards from 10 - 30% to 5 - 15%, but leave Cashback unchanged. \n\n### Rationale\n\nTotal reduction in monthly $BAG emission to the 4 prize types is ($28,500 + 2.86m) $BAG. \n\nRake and Volume Leaderboards: These moves to USDB make sense given the current price of $BAG. For the Rake Leaderboard in particular, player liquidity on bag.win is entirely in USDB. These changes shift $23,500/mon $BAG emission to USDB. The USDB will count against casino profits, but the same was true for $BAG. There is also an opportunity in Blast Season 2 to move some or all of this to Gold.\n\nCasino Competitions: USDB makes sense given the current price of $BAG. We reduce $BAG emissions by ~ [3 comps] x [4.33 weeks] x [220K $BAG] = 2.86m $BAG/mon. \n\nSNG Badge Leaderboard Prizes: The $10,000 per month in on-chain $BAG was meant to bootstrap player liquidity for the platform. Today, we have ~100 DAU as well as ~200 users per week claiming Tickets from their premium wearables. Particularly given the price of $BAG – and given the maturity of the platform – it is reasonable to decrease these to $5K. Additionally, in the future, we expect to be able to combine player liquidity with casino SNGs (e.g. USDB buy-in) and Ticket buy-in.",

      "title": "Enhancing Transparency and Governance Accountability in the BAG DAO",
      "content": "# Background:\n\nThere are different aspects of BAG that attract people, which can mainly be divided into three different categories:\n\n*Governors*:   People who are interested in participating and engaging in the DAO by voting on proposals regarding the future of the BAG ecosystem.\n\n*Players*: Players who want to boost their cashbacks when playing games.\n\n*Affiliates*: Affiliates who want to boost their revenue share when bringing players into the platform.\n\nA significant percentage of users have opted into the BAG ecosystem because of the governance features of the DAO. Our DAO is an off-chain DAO, which is different from many other DAOs out there like Decentraland, where everything is executed on-chain.\n\nSince our DAO is not on-chain, the purpose of the usage of funds or the wallets that correspond to the DAO is often unclear with every transaction the DAO executes.\n\nDuring the last bull market, people would get into ecosystems without making an in-depth analysis of every project, and at the same time, there wasn't as much information available as there is today, nor were there tools such as DEX Tools. Today, people use all of these tools to get as much information as possible about a project before acquiring tokens, and the information available is a key aspect when considering whether to get in or not.\nMany of us have been in the ecosystem for a while and see the daily efforts and progress of the team. However, for newcomers trying to find information, it’s hard to distinguish if the project is legitimate or not, and we are all aware of the number of scams that happen in crypto.\n\nGiven this information, it is crucial for us to reinforce and improve our DAO and to provide as much transparency as we can for newcomers and current participants involved in the ecosystem to feel safe joining in.\n\n# Proposal:\n\nCreate three new channels on Discord under a new category called “DAO Transparency.”\n\n## First channel: “Declared Wallets”\n\nPurpose: Given that certain operations make it hard to execute everything using a multi-sig, we create this channel to list all of the wallets holding assets that belong to the DAO.\nAction: The team can add or remove wallets from this channel, and for every addition or removal, just copy and paste the last message with the modifications.\nOptional: Team members who feel comfortable can add their declared wallets in this same channel.\n\n## Second channel: “Transactions Transparency”\n\nPurpose: To post information about every transaction executed from within a declared wallet.\nAction: A simple message will be posted each time a transaction is executed, including a transaction hash and a category of the expenditure, such as “Operation costs,” “Rewards,” “Liquidity,” etc.\n\n## Third channel: “Financials Transparency”\n\nPurpose: To post weekly messages highlighting all of the DAO holdings, including vestings.\nAction: According to the original BAG (formerly DG) whitepaper, most of the vesting contracts would flow straight into the DAO treasury (33%). Considering all the buybacks executed over time, the DAO controls a significant percentage of the circulating supply of BAG tokens, and it’s a big incentive for people to see that the real circulating supply is lower than what it displays on sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko. The message should include how much the DAO holds of each asset (BAG, ETH, wBTC, USDT, etc.).\n\n\n## DAO Emergency Proposals:\n\nOver the past five years, there have been occasions where emergency situations required the DAO to act fast, but action was delayed because it had to wait for a proposal to pass. An example of this was when USDC started losing its peg against USDT, which luckily reverted, but if that hadn’t been the case, the DAO would have suffered a significant economic impact just because it had to wait the number of days for a proposal to pass.\n\n## Proposal for Emergency Situations:\n\nQuorum Requirements: An emergency proposal can be passed within 1 day if it reaches three times the normal quorum required, and it can pass within 2 hours if it reaches ten times the normal quorum.\nRestrictions: Emergency proposals cannot result in an outflow of money from the DAO. They can only be used for moving or converting funds. The balance sheet of the DAO should look the same after the transaction is finished, and the assets involved in the transaction can only include BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, DAI, BAG, and their corresponding pairs on other chains or their corresponding staking formats such as stETH or wBTC.\n\n\n### Rationale:\n\nOne of the greatest narratives BAG has to offer is its governance features. It’s crucial for this narrative to be attractive to provide as much transparency as possible to the people who engage in the ecosystem. Given that BAG is not an on-chain DAO, these tools can provide a picture of the current status of the DAO, including holdings, transactions, and token distributions, resulting in more confidence within our entire community.\n\nThere are also a good number of KPIs that the DAO should be proud of, such as the number of BAG tokens acquired over time, and this should be announced to the world!",

      "title": "Moving BAG DAO Liquidity from Uniswap V3 to Uniswap V2",
      "content": "Background:\n\nWhen the BAG migration concluded, we chose Uniswap V3 as the preferred pool option for token liquidity. This decision was based on the belief that concentrating liquidity within a smaller price range would be more capital efficient and allow larger orders with reduced slippage. However, this approach resulted in most of the liquidity being withdrawn as the price did not adjust dynamically under selling pressure.\n\nHad we opted for Uniswap V2, the same selling pressure would have driven the token price down further, but we would have retained more ETH in the pool. As sellers sold their tokens, the pool would have automatically rebalanced, offering a lower price for subsequent sellers, thus conserving more ETH within the pool.\n\nProposal:\n\n1) Remove all liquidity from Uniswap V3 on the Ethereum mainnet and from Thruster. There will be no V3 pool of any kind.\n\n2) Create an ETH Mainnet V2 liquidity pool on Uniswap, allocate 15 ETH, and pair it with the corresponding amount of BAG. Lock this liquidity using Unicrypt for a period of 2 years.\n\n3) Create a Blast Mainnet V2 liquidity pool on Thruster, allocate 30 ETH, and pair it with the corresponding amount of BAG.\n\n4) Any further changes to the liquidity pools will require a governance proposal.\n\nRationale:\n\nProviding liquidity is essential for any crypto project, as it enables new participants to buy into the project without experiencing significant slippage. Locking the liquidity enhances our credibility, especially on platforms like DEX Tools, which view this as a critical factor. Furthermore, notifying about changes in liquidity pools ensures the transparency of our beloved DAO. By moving to Uniswap V2, we aim to maintain a more balanced and stable liquidity environment, ultimately benefiting our community and project stability.",

      "title": "BAG DAO Adopts Michael Saylor's Strategy",
      "content": "Background\n\nMichael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, introduced a financial strategy in 2020 where the company allocated all of their income to regularly buy Bitcoin. Not only did they allocate their income, but they also leveraged their assets by borrowing against their holdings using various mechanisms. The goal was to increase the amount of Bitcoin per share, with a vision that fiat currencies will eventually suffer from a significant loss of purchasing power. This strategy has been highly successful for MicroStrategy, shifting their business core to the point where they have effectively become a Bitcoin company. MicroStrategy has outperformed the entire stock market and Bitcoin itself. The only other company to adopt this strategy, Metaplanet, a Japanese company, has seen a substantial increase in its valuation since doing so.\n\nAs of today, US interest rates remain high, and inflation is persistent, preventing the Federal Reserve from lowering rates. Lowering rates would flood the markets with money, worsening inflation. Eventually, rates must decrease to prevent other markets, such as real estate, from breaking. At that point, those holding non-fixed fiat assets will see an appreciation in their assets, although it is essentially a devaluation of the underlying currency.\n\n\nProposal\n\n\nWe propose that BAG adopts Michael Saylor's strategy. To implement this, we will use 100% of the weekly profits from project operations to buy WBTC. This acquired WBTC will be placed as collateral on AAVE (or another lending platform at the team's discretion), and 30% of that value will be borrowed in the form of USDT to acquire BAG tokens on the open market.\n\nAdditionally, we will place 30% of our current staked ETH tokens (stETH) as collateral on the lending platform to maintain a very healthy risk factor. Even without this, we would have a good health factor with a ratio of 1 to 3 every week (for every 100 supplied, 30 is borrowed), providing significant margin. To further enhance safety, we will place 30% of our current staked ETH tokens as collateral.\n\nFurthermore, we will borrow an initial amount of 100k USDT from AAVE and use it to acquire BAG on the open market, intending to increase the amount of ETH/BTC in the treasury per BAG token in circulation. This will occur over 15 days after this proposal passes.\n\nThe team will have discretion over when to perform the weekly purchases of BAG, which can be done on any day of the week but must be completed before the week ends. This flexibility helps prevent front-running of the purchases.\n\nFinally, the treasury assets are now mostly on ETH & BTC, at this point, these should be sold to continue paying for the team operations. Instead of selling these assets, these should be placed as collateral on aave and the required funds in the form of USDT should be borrowed to pay for operating expenses. Include a disclosure of this borrowings on the weekly announcements.\nGive discretion to the team to increase the amount of collateral on aave upon these borrowings to always keep a healthy risk factor.\n\nRationale\n\nLong-Term Value Appreciation:\nBy adopting Michael Saylor's strategy, BAG DAO can potentially benefit from the long-term appreciation of Bitcoin. Historically, Bitcoin has shown significant growth and resilience, making it an attractive store of value. By converting our weekly profits into WBTC, we align with a proven strategy that has outperformed traditional investment avenues.\n\nHedge Against Inflation:\nWith current economic conditions characterized by high inflation and uncertain monetary policies, holding assets like Bitcoin provides a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. This strategy ensures that our DAO's treasury retains its purchasing power over time, safeguarding the value of our members' investments.\n\nIncreased Asset Base:\nLeveraging our WBTC holdings to borrow USDT and acquire BAG tokens allows us to grow our asset base without diluting our existing token supply. This approach increases the amount of ETH and BTC in our treasury per BAG token, enhancing the overall value and stability of the DAO.\n\nStrategic Flexibility:\nBy placing a portion of our staked ETH (stETH) as collateral, we maintain a healthy risk factor while ensuring liquidity for operational needs. This strategic flexibility allows us to adapt to market conditions and manage risks effectively, ensuring the long-term sustainability of our DAO.\n\nAlignment with Successful Models:\nFollowing the footsteps of successful companies like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet provides a tested blueprint for financial growth and stability. By leveraging their proven strategies, BAG DAO can replicate their success, ensuring that we remain competitive and innovative in the rapidly evolving blockchain space.",

      "title": "$BAG Polygon to Blast Migration",
      "content": "### Background\n\nWe’ve completed the BAG Rebrand, Token Migration, and Ecosystem Upgrade proposal that was posted 3 months ago: https://snapshot.org/#/decentralgames.eth/proposal/0x8c915cd3446399fd275123c3060a34003205e3463d9581cc6fb361590937af8b.\n\nAt a high level, we:\n\n- Simplified our product offering and CTA (“secure $BAG”) to join our ecosystem\n- Doubled down on our products with sustainable business models\n- Improved Premium Wearables’ utility\n\nWe also launched $BAG, bag.win, and our metaverse casino games on Blast. We were able to do so concurrently with Blast mainnet going live 2 months ago. Decentral Games won Blast’s Big Bang Competition and has since received 145.1K Blast Gold, which we’ve committed to deliver 100% to players.\n\nNew users, DAU, and Revenue have all increased significantly, driven entirely by new sign-ups on Blast. Corresponding with revenue increases, we’ve been able to distribute much more back to players across cashback, rakeback, referral rewards, IRL prizes, and $BAG prizes for competition and volume leaderboards. \n\nOver the last 2 months, we’ve facilitated hundreds from our community migrating to Blast. Many of them have utilized the casino deposit contract to do so since there are few other ERC-20 bridges and/or one would need to bridge Polygon → ETH Mainnet → Blast. There’s significant demand for a better way to bridge. \n\n### Proposal\n\nConcentrate development efforts, player base, and $BAG liquidity on Blast. Specifically, execute the ASAP after this proposal passes:\n\n- Launch Polygon → Blast bridge on DG site for $BAG\n- Disallow $BAG deposits and withdrawals on Polygon\n- Remove $BAG liquidity from Polygon; use funds to add to LP on Blast\n- Distribute Multi Table Tournament (MTT) $BAG prizes on Blast\n- Distribute Arcade Leaderboard prizes in USDB on Blast\n\n### Rationale\n\nAligning our development efforts with the Blast ecosystem and community has shown promise in driving DAU and bet volume growth as seen in our gameplay data over the last 2 months. We hope to continue to foster this relationship as Blast establishes itself as a leading Ethereum L2. Beyond Gold and Points, Blasts innovative native-yield is a significant differentiating factor vs. other L2s and enables us to deliver more value to users via rewards:\n\n- Cashback\n- Rakeback\n- Referral rewards\n- IRL prizes  for competitions \n- 100% deposit match & welcome bonuses\n- BAG prizes for competition and volume leaderboards\n\nAdditional considerations: \n\n- **BAG Liquidity**: Concentrating liquidity on one scalable (non-mainchain blockchain) delivers a better experience for trading $BAG and reduces value lost to arbitrageurs. \n- **Prizes**: We will continue to distribute prizes to casino balances where applicable; elsewhere, we should continue to distribute prizes on a single chain, and, post-migration, this should be Blast. \n- **Bridging**: We have the resources and technical expertise to build a secure and easy to use ERC-20 bridge for $BAG to migrate from Polygon to Blast. This is low lift, so we should simply provide this to the community rather than directing our community elsewhere.\n- **Blast Gold**: One determinant of our Blast Gold allocation continues to be the Blast-native score. We’ve scored 1.5 on a scale of [1, 1.5, 2]. This is a multiplier, so a score of 2x results in 33% more than 1.5x (since 2/1.5 = 1.33). By completing the $BAG migration to Blast, we’ll be fully Blast-native and we believe we can score 2.",

      "content": "### Background\n\nHolding BAG gives you bonus multipliers that boost your Blast Gold, Blast Point, cashback, and referral rewards. The more BAG you hold, the more rewards you earn. These rates are outlined here: https://docs.decentral.games/promotions/reward-tiers.\n\nBlast Point and Gold multipliers follow the same multipliers as Cashback, but Referral multipliers are different. The Tier 0 Cashback reward is 5% (so 5x is 25%) and the Tier 0 Referral reward is 25% (so 2x is 50%).\n\n### Proposal\n\n(1) For all 4 categories, make Tier 0 - Tier 10 range from 1x - 3x in increments of 0.2.\n(2) Set the Tier 0 Cashback reward to 10% (so 3x is 30%) and the Tier 0 Referral reward to  15% (so 3x is 45%).\n\n### Rationale\n\nAligning these rates will be easier to maintain and convey to users. It'll also be more memorable given the new 1:1 mapping between Tier and Multiplier across all 4 categories. Moreover, the 5x spread was reasonable for cashback which was previously capped at 25% but it was pretty extreme for Blast Points and Blast Gold. As a result, it capped how high we could set the Tier 0 rewards (which is what most new users will see) and limited our flexibility to give Points/Gold out elsewhere.\n\nLastly, this is a relatively small change for Cashback and Referral reward levels. Cashback rates end up 5% higher across the board while Referral rewards end up 5 - 10% lower. The combined cap for both remains 75%.",

      "content": "## Background\n\nWe are Ouroboros Capital, a liquid crypto fund known for our our proactive and hands-on approach. We do more than just invest in projects; we actively contribute to their growth and success. Our team works closely with the projects we support, providing insights, advice, and direct involvement to ensure they thrive. \n\nSome examples of our work include:\n\n- Advisors to Radiant Capital, the largest money market on Arbitrum\n- Advisors to Perennial Finance, a well backed perpetuals protocol\n- Active Frax Finance governance participant\n\n## Turning Point\n\nWe have begun to build a position in the Decentral Games ecosystem from the open market. \n\nWe see the potential for Decentral Games to position itself well into its launch of the Blast ecosystem. Moreover, the new mobile casino product will allow Decentral Games to tap into a newer and wider audience.\n\nLonger term, we believe that the virtual world product that Decentral Games has developed fits extremely well into the future incoming narrative of VR, AR games and experiences (think: Apple Vision Pro).  \n\nNotably, liquidity remains low but we believe this is something that can be remedied with increased activity, marketing and capital. \n\n## How we can help\n\nOuroboros Capital is uniquely positioned to assist DG in overcoming its current obstacles and capitalizing on future opportunities. Our plan proposes:\n\n1. **Networking and Partnerships**: Over the past 18 months, we've built a robust network within the crypto space. We plan to use this to foster partnerships and collaborations for Decentral Games, potentially including connections with other portfolio companies and venture capitalists.\n2. **Enhancing Liquidity**: The liquidity of DG / BAG, is critical to the platform’s performance. We propose connecting Decentral Games with reputable market makers to enhance market depth and potentially providing liquidity for over-the-counter (OTC) tokens.\n3. **Boosting Market Attention**: With over 23k X followers, a 2.5k-strong Telegram community, and a rapidly growing Substack readership, our social media channels are powerful tools for raising awareness about DG. We plan to utilize these platforms to draw attention to Decentral Games, highlighting its potential.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe propose an OTC purchase of $125K BAG tokens at a 10% discount to the past-30d TWAP price from 8th March ($0.03265 per DG), for a final price of $0.02938 per DG. These tokens will be linearly vested over 6 months.\n\n## Rationale\n\nIn accumulating this vested position of BAG tokens on top of our existing position bought on the market, we at Ouroboros Capital would be aligned with bringing in new eyes to BAG, Decentral Games and its products.",

      "title": "BAG Rebrand, Token Migration, and Ecosystem Upgrade",
      "content": "### Background\n\nDecentral Games’ offering and ecosystem has evolved considerably over the years:\n\n- 4 years ago – We started the Decentral Games project.\n- 3 years ago – We launched our first games, the $DG token, and the DG DAO.\n- 2.5 years ago – We launched ICE Poker and the $ICE token.\n- 2 years ago – We introduced a 1:1000 $DG token split and $xDG (staked $DG).\n- 6 months ago – We launched the beta of our Malta-compliant metaverse casino. \n\nAs a result of this continuous development, our product suite has become overly complex — especially for newcomers. This proposal seeks to simplify our ecosystem and drive 24/7 player liquidity in our metaverse casino, mobile SNG arcade, and upcoming mobile casino. \n\n#### Our objectives:\n\n1. Simplify our product offering and CTA to join our ecosystem. \n2. Double down on products with sustainable business models.\n3. Improve Premium Wearables’ (previously: All Access Wearables) utility.\n\n### Proposal\n\n#### Simplify Our Ecosystem\n\nDeploy $BAG, a new ERC20 token that assumes the positive utility $DG, $xDG, and $ICE have today, but does not assume $ICE’s inflationary rewards nor the cumbersome user experience of staking/unstaking with $xDG. $BAG is capped at 8B supply and becomes our governance token. Holders of $xDG, $DG, and $ICE can convert to $BAG.\n\nEnable $BAG claiming at the following rates:  \n\n- 1 $DG → 8 $BAG (conversion supported on Ethereum and Polygon)\n- 3 $ICE → 2 $BAG (conversion supported on Polygon)\n- $xDG can be unstaked in order to convert $xDG → $DG → $BAG.  (conversion supported on Ethereum and Polygon)\n\nRebrand All Access Wearables to Premium Wearables and Shine to Tickets. \n\nUpdate our existing game modes as follows:\n\n###### Casino: \n\n- Add Deposit and Withdrawal on Ethereum mainnet and Polygon POS for $BAG. \n- Update Casino Gameplay to support $BAG; discontinue $ICE.\n- Update loyalty tiers for referrals & cashback to be based on $BAG.\n\n###### SNGs: \n\n- Migrate SNGs from $ICE-based to USDT-based.\n- Enable USDT → Tickets at a ratio of:\n   - 9 Tickets -- 2.5 USDT (~0.278 USDT/ticket)\n   - 20 Tickets -- 5 USDT (0.25 USDT/ticket)\n   - 105 Tickets -- 25 USDT (~0.238 USDT/ticket)\n- Enable BADGES → USDT in Arcade at a rate of ~ 1 BADGE / 1.1 USDT\n- Payout SNG leaderboard rewards with $BAG. \n\n###### DAO:\n\n- $BAG is the governance token and corresponds to votes.\n- $BAG holdings correspond to Loyalty rewards boosts (cashback and ref links)\n\nWithdraw and convert $DG and $ICE LPs on Ethereum and Polygon and migrate over to $BAG with the equivalent total value with a single ETH-$BAG LP on each chain. Work with centralized exchanges to replace $DG and $ICE listings with $BAG.  \n\n#### Double Down\n\nSunset Challenge Mode, Delegation, Upgrades, Activations and the earning of Banked ICE (but honor existing Banked ICE conversions, which will be convertible to Tickets). \n\n#### Improve Wearable Utility\n\nEnable Premium Wearable holders to stack unlimited items and earn weekly Tickets or Bonus USDT. Cease halving rewards. \n\nInitiate new wearable rewards as follows: \n\n- Premium wearable holders may choose to receive tickets or Bonus USDT at the following rates for each wearable: \n  - If Tickets are chosen: 3 x (1 + [Bonus %]) Tickets per week\n  - If Bonus USDT is chosen: 3 x (1 + [Bonus %]) Bonus USDT per week\n- Additionally, for Crown, Scepter, and Royal Attire holders, these NFTs will earn like Premium Wearables themselves with Bonus % of 150%, 75%, and 50%, respectively. \n- Tickets are rounded to the nearest whole number, but fractional Bonus USDT can be claimed (e.g. 21.5 Bonus USDT). \n- Premium wearables holders must claim and play each week to receive Tickets/Bonus USDT the following week. \n  - Tickets play requirement: player must complete one SNG the previous week. \n  - Bonus USDT play requirement: player must have bet in the previous week.\n- It’s important to note that this would be a starting point. As we add more games, drive revenue across our products, and see the data, we can make adjustments to the rewards as needed. \n\n### Rationale\n\n#### Simplify Our Ecosystem\n\nToday, our ecosystem is too confusing for new players to understand all the assets in our ecosystem and figure out how to start playing. Moreover, our community is currently divided – in terms of their objectives – across our different assets rather than united together as one. To fix both issues, we propose unifying our community under a single token with superior economics: the $BAG token.\n\nThe $BAG token inherits all the utility of our current 3 tokens: use $BAG to play games, buy assets, boost your loyalty rewards, and participate in governance without any staking necessary. As a result, the CTA to join our community and ecosystem will be simple: buy $BAG.\n\nWe believe the $BAG ticker has great marketing potential as it’s distinct, catchy, and easy to remember. It also serves as a first strong step to establish our brand as separate (and not limited by) Decentraland. \n\nFinally, rebranding All Access wearables as Premium wearables and Shine as Tickets better prepares our product to welcome new players as the names are better descriptors of what utility they provide.\n\n#### Double Down\n\nFor sustainable and effective growth we need to focus on products that:\n\n1. Deliver a fun gaming experience\n2. Stand out from other products in the market\n3. Generate revenue for the DAO treasury\n\nBased on those values, the most promising products that will benefit our community are:\n\n- Malta-licensed Metaverse Casino: The only Metaverse casino on the market and soon to be in our own native Metaverse. \n- Arcade app (SNGs): Non-gambling, globally accessible, and playable on any mobile or desktop browser. \n- Mobile casino app: Mobile app soon to be launched with cash poker soon, and then slots, roulette, and blackjack.\n\nUnfortunately, Challenge Mode works against the best interest of our community. As much as we’ve poured our hearts into building, supporting, and optimizing it over the last couple of years, it doesn’t make sense for our community to continue subsidizing this game mode and harming our ecosystem. This is a tough decision, but it’s necessary for our community’s growth and we’re confident this will allow our ecosystem to flourish for the future. That being said, we premium wearable rewards can be restructured to be a net positive for the ecosystem.\n\n#### Improve Wearable Utility\n\nWearable owners are much better equipped to both max out earnings from all their wearables and earn more rewards overall compared to our prior setup due to being able to check in infinite wearables, play only once per week, and no longer having to split their rewards with delegates. \n\nThese new incentives drive more engagement and provide valuable 24/7 player liquidity across our entire product suite, specifically in games where this player liquidity is valuable. Games start quicker, players enjoy a much better social gaming experience, and growth efforts are more effective at retaining players.",

      "content": "SNG +Ante Proposal\n\nWhat are antes?\n\nAntes are tiny forced bets that each player pays preflop.\nAn example of this:\n\n15/30 4 ante\nsmall blind 15 + big blind 30 + 24 total ante = 69 pot preflop prior to any action.\n\nWhy add them?\n\nAnte-less poker in SNG/MTTs is a structure of the past. Today most online poker sites do not even have ante-less SNGs on offer.\nThis is for good reason, they are boring. Ante-less poker promotes for very tight play, and very dull play. If we want to reach more players, the SNGs have to be more fun to play. \n\nAdding antes will spice the game up, the players folding 90% of hands will now bleed chips, players have more incentive to defend big blind because of bigger pot odds, players have more incentive to fight for pots in general.\nPeople will actually play poker and not a folding simulator. \n\nWith the addition of antes, we should increase start stack ever so slightly, to make sure the SNG does not become a all-in fest very quickly.\n\nI propose the following SNG blind level structure. \n\nStarting stacks and blind levels:      \n1500 for 3 shines and  1min blind levels\n2000 for 15 shine and  3min blind levels\n3000 for 30  and  4min blind levels\n3000 for 60 and 4min blind levels\n4000 for 99 shines and 5min blind levels\n5000 for 1K shines and  5min blind levels\n\n10/20\n15/30 4 ante\n20/40 5 ante\n25/50 6 ante\n40/80 10 ante\n60/120 15 ante\n80/160 20 ante\n100/200 25 ante\n150/300 25 ante\n200/400 25 ante\n250/500 50 ante\n300/600 50 ante\n400/800 50 ante\n\nIf this turns out to slow or to fast, we can fine tune the start stacks. For now, this seems like a good place to start.\n\nVote yes if YOU want to play poker and not a folding sim!",

Based on conversations with them, we believe joining the Neo Tokyo community could lead to notable partnerships, PR and growth. \n\nAdditional details:\n\n- Other members include notable web3 gaming organizations (Animoca, Merit Circle, Illuvium, Immutable, Avalanche, etc).\n- Unlocks user acquisition channels with our ideal target users and PR opportunities for upcoming releases (such as pocket casino mobile app and potential token migration).\n- Unlike a traditional marketing spend, the NFT does hold some value and staking the asset yields $BYTES rewards for the treasury. The DAO could vote to sell the asset to recoup part of if not all the purchase value if campaign does not work out.",

      "content": "A change is needed to the current play to own module. We are in an age where people now play with several accounts.  It is financially less rewarding to become an owner (the investment done vs the extra ice you produce), than just picking another account to play. Currently the vast majority of the player pool are not looking to become owners, or to reinvest in the project. The ones who look to become owners, or already are, are more likely to keep reinvesting in the project.\nThe player pool now serves to decrease the value of ice, as they just sell ice. This is within their right, but ice just keeps decreasing and they themselves end up receiving less and less rewards in dollar terms.\nTherefore, I suggest the changing the split the owner and player receive. This will benefit more the owner, someone who invested in the project, and might do so more often, than a player of today who wont.\nPlayers will still receive their rewards, just at a slower rate, and, might end up benefiting more due to the fact owners are less likely to sell. Furthermore, this will also benefit players who decided prior to today not to sell 100% of their ice (wonder how many are in this situation...)\nChanging this dynamic might see some players leave as total rewards are lower, thats okay, they would had left as ice price keeps going down anyway. While, some owners and guilds might experience some shortage of players, this would be countered by a likely stacking proposal (where owners will play with more than 5 nfts, and therefore the players who were delegated the others will now enter the \"looking for player\" liquidity pool).\n\nOwners currently already made the investment, some pay a manager, ect ect, there should be more incentives to become an owner. Playing with nfts to once day being an owner. This is with the line of thinking of proposals such as lowering owner objectives. The whole idea should be behind shifting from a player base to an owner base. This proposal potential also increases nft value, benefiting those who invest in the project. \n\nCurrent\t\t-\tProposal\t\t\nlvl\t\towner\tplayer\t\towner\tplayer\t\n5\tgold\t52\t48\t-\t66\t34\t\n4\tpink\t49\t51\t-\t62\t38\t\n3\tpurple\t46\t54\t-\t58\t42\t\n2\tgreen\t43\t57\t-\t54\t46\t\n1\tgrey\t40\t60\t-\t50\t50\t\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiea7piswqpxhwidjvzqfm64tct2lb25eycmhfo2i3i42cncrsrzsy)",

However, this proposal suggests an enhancement to this process: the final decision on the revocation of the Grant Vesting Contract would be subject to the outcome of a Community vote. If the Community vote is in favor of the Grantee and against the revocation, the Grant Vesting Contract won't be revoked. In such a case, any preventive pause that had been initiated would be lifted and the Grant Vesting Contract along with its payments would be continued, and vice versa.",

      "content": "Background:\nOur organization currently maintains an ICE-USDC liquidity pool. Given the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market and the evolving landscape, it's imperative to constantly reassess and optimize our liquidity pool strategies. Recent market movements and upcoming events, such as the expected approval of a Bitcoin ETF, indicate a potential surge in demand for both Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nProposal:\nWe propose to split the current ICE-USDC liquidity pool into two separate pools: ICE-WBTC and ICE-ETH. Each of these new pools will hold 50% of the liquidity previously assigned to the ICE-USDC pool.\n\n\nRationale:\nOptimal Exposure: The cryptocurrency market indicates a potential appreciation in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. With the upcoming Bitcoin ETF approval, the conversion provides the organization with exposure to assets poised for growth.\n\nDiversification Benefits: Splitting the liquidity between ICE-WBTC and ICE-ETH ensures that we are not overly reliant on the performance of a single asset pairing, providing a hedge against potential market downturns in one while benefitting from upswings in the other.\n\nIncreased Liquidity Opportunities: Given the prominence of both Bitcoin and Ethereum in the cryptocurrency market, the creation of these new pools might attract more traders, thereby potentially enhancing liquidity and transaction fee earnings for our organization.\n\nAlignment with Market Trends: By transitioning to ICE-WBTC and ICE-ETH pools, our organization aligns itself with prevalent market movements and positions itself favorably to capitalize on upcoming market events.",

      "title": "Conversion of 50% of ETH Treasury Holdings into WBTC",
      "content": "Background:\nThe organization currently holds a significant portion of its treasury in Ethereum (ETH). While ETH has proven to be a strong asset, it's important to diversify the treasury holdings to mitigate risks and capitalize on other market opportunities. Bitcoin (BTC) has historically shown to be a solid investment and a store of value. However, direct BTC investment can have some logistical complications. Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) offers a compromise by representing Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain, making it easier to handle alongside our existing ETH holdings.\n\n\nProposal:\n- It is proposed that 50% of the current ETH holdings in the treasury be converted into WBTC. This conversion will not only diversify the portfolio but also allow the organization to leverage upcoming market events, such as the anticipated approval of a Bitcoin ETF.\n- Leave at the team discretion the ability to supply these WBTC on finance plattforms such as AAVE or Curve to generate an additional yield\n\n\nRationale:\nDiversification: Holding a large percentage of assets in a single form poses risks, especially in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Diversifying into WBTC will mitigate some of these risks.\n\nLiquidity: WBTC provides the benefits of BTC with the added liquidity of being on the Ethereum network. It offers easier trading pairs with existing ETH-based tokens.\n\nUpcoming BTC ETF Approval: The market is expecting the approval of a Bitcoin ETF. This approval is likely to push BTC prices higher. By holding WBTC, we can capitalize on this event while keeping the assets within the Ethereum ecosystem.",

      "title": "Add parcels to Arcade mode physical prizes again",
      "content": "Background:\nThis proposal builds upon the recent approval of the \"Sell Decentraland land held on the treasury\" initiative, which gained consensus just two weeks ago. Currently, Decentral Games holds a substantial inventory of Decentraland land, representing a valuable but underutilized asset. Despite our significant growth and expansion in the virtual casino sector, these land holdings have remained largely untapped.\n\nTo sustain and accelerate our growth trajectory, we urgently require increased liquidity. The prior approval of the \"Sell Decentraland land held on the treasury\" proposal has granted the Decentral Games team the authority to liquidate land assets. This permission is particularly relevant, given past difficulties in selling land assets through OpenSea and within the Decentraland ecosystem. Historically, the sheer scale of our land holdings has required us to offer larger estates at a 20% discount, incurring obligatory royalty fees.\n\nProposal:\nThis proposal seeks to empower the Decentral Games team to allocate 300 badges' worth of land parcels as physical prizes within the Arcade mode. Implementation will be completed within one week following the passage of this proposal. It is important to note that the pricing of these parcels may be adjusted if it significantly deviates from the prevailing OpenSea floor prices.\n\nRationale:\nThis initiative serves as a compelling driver to encourage participation in Arcade mode, outperforming the traditional approach of parcel sales on the OpenSea platform in terms of effectiveness. Furthermore, it offers the possibility, as evidenced by past instances, for the community to collaboratively develop vacant parcels, thereby enhancing the vibrancy of our casino district.\n\nThis initiative also unlocks a substantial source of funding, bolstering our efforts to expand our casino operations. Currently, our Decentraland land holdings represent latent assets with untapped potential. By strategically divesting a portion of these holdings, we can redirect these resources to areas that directly catalyze the growth of Decentral Games.\n\nEmpowering the team to execute this strategic maneuver ensures a prudent approach, in alignment with prevailing market conditions and our financial requirements. The generated funds will be judiciously allocated to enhance our casino offerings, attract a wider user base, and augment our revenue streams. Your support for this proposal will be instrumental in propelling Decentral Games to greater success.",

      "content": "**Bridging Casino Profits and ICE Token Sustainability**\n\nWe propose allocating a specific percentage of the casino's profits, derived from all tokens excluding the ICE token, to fund the buyback and subsequent burning of the ICE token. This includes profits from stable coins and any other tokens used presently or introduced in the future.\n\n*Key Points:*\n**1. Initial Allocation Parameters:**\nA percentage of profits from non-ICE tokens will be reserved for ICE token buyback and/or burn. The precise allocation percentage can be flexibly determined by the team, provided that it remains at or above a 10% floor. (Profits would be calculated after deposit bonuses, rakeback, ref link bonuses, and casino comp prizes have been subtracted)\n\n**2. Burn-to-Earn Ratio Adjustment:**\n-The allocation percentage will be dynamic, adjusting in relation to the burn-to-earn ratio.\n-While 20% serves as a guiding maximum allocation, the team retains the discretion to set the exact rate.\n-As the burn-to-earn ratio evolves favorably, the allocation percentage should decrease.\n-When the burn-to-earn ratio hits 0.9:1, the allocation drops to its minimum of 10%.\n\nBy implementing this proposal, we aim to ensure the sustained value and stability of the ICE token by providing a complete connection between the casino and the ICE ecosystem. Establishing a direct link between the casino's operations and the ICE ecosystem helps to ensure stability and also offers an appealing proposition for stakeholders and investors. This proposal grants the team a level of flexibility in setting percentages, while also creating confidence within our community about the alignment of casino profits with the ICE ecosystem's success. This proposal also provides a plan in the possible scenario where the other tokens that will be used in the casino reach a significantly higher volume than ICE tokens used in the casino.",

      "title": "Casino profit allocations",
      "content": "Background:\n\nThe ICE token plays a pivotal role within the Decentral Games ecosystem, especially as the primary reward in our play-to-earn gaming model. With the dynamics of the \"burn to earn\" system and various economic strategies applied over time, there have been suggestions and potential shifts in its distribution and management. A previous proposal suggested that if the \"burn to earn\" exceeded 1, any excess ICE would be airdropped amongst aaw holders. As the landscape changes, it's vital to reevaluate and adopt strategies that support the ICE economy and enhance the benefits for our community.\n\nProposal:\n\n1. ICE Buyback and Burn: Decentral Games commits to allocating 20% of the casino profits from any given token towards the buyback of ICE, subsequently burning it. This action will be undertaken regardless of the \"burn to earn\" ratio's standing.\n   \n2. Removal of Surplus Airdrop: The prior proposal, which envisioned a surplus airdrop mechanism distributing any remaining ICE among aaw holders if \"burn to earn\" was above 1, will be abolished.\n   \nRationale:\n\nThe changes proposed are rooted in multiple objectives:\n\n1. Bolstering the ICE Economy: Implementing a buyback and burn strategy effectively reduces ICE's overall circulating supply. Assuming consistent or increased demand, this reduction should lead to an increase in its value. This proactive measure is aimed at supporting and fostering growth within the ICE economy.\n   \n2. Promotion of ICE Retention: The buyback and burn mechanism is expected to act as a catalyst, urging users to acquire and retain their ICE tokens in anticipation of potential value upticks given its deflationary aspects.\n   \n3. Advantage to aaw Holders: Discontinuing the surplus airdrop means aaw holders aren't just on the receiving end of a fleeting token surge. They are positioned to gain from the long-term appreciation of ICE's value, reflecting in the valuation of their NFTs and the enhanced USDC rewards they accrue daily.",

      "title": "Make Owner challenges quicker",
      "content": "Proposal:\nChange owner challenges to the following:\n\nflop 12 times - turn 8 times - river 6 times // (currently is 20/15/10)\n2 two pairs - 10 pairs // (currently is 4/15/3oak)\nwin 5 hands (5/6/7/8/9 depending on nft lvl) // (currently is 8/9/10/11/12)\n\n\nRational: \nThere is both a short term and long term view.\nShort term: Owners now might face a little scarcity to find players. This will enable owners to play a set, in a quicker fashion.\n\nLong term: Owners who currently don't play might become more involved in the day to day play, if the time spent to actually finish challenges decreases. They wont see it as a \"job\", but as something fun they can do.  \n\nMain reason: This is the most important reason why this proposal should pass: We want an ecosystem that makes a player progress into becoming an owner. Now this doesn't happen as often. Assuming the player has enough to become an owner, he will make the maths, check the roi of having nfts and upgrading vs selling them, and come to a conclusion if they wish to earn double and play with their own nfts, or remain a player. That is a simple math situation. Now we add a new benefit, time, the time someone spend per day playing. Can be 1hour to 2 hours. Obviously this depends. Whatever the case, the challenges now being reduced, will likely mean a player can finish in 60-70% of the time it took before, from login to play and such. All of the sudden the perspective a player has into becoming an owner changes. Not only he earns double as an owner, he now also spends less time. \n\nThere are more reasons and I can expand on the reasons why this proposal should pass, you can see them on the YT video.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHtzZZg200E",

Repost ONLY.\n\n**Background:**\n\nAfter the ice halving on 8/15 this year, rewards in the challenge mode went down. At the same time, changing badges to wearables became cheaper, now costing two-thirds of what it used to. Because of this, we need to look at the challenge mode again to make sure everything works well together.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal:**\n\nWe suggest making the challenge mode shorter or easier so it's about two-thirds of what it is now. This means it will be about 1/3 less tough than before. The team can make small changes to get it just right.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Save Time:** By changing the challenge mode, people can manage their time better. This will help them plan and do things more smoothly.\n  \n- **Fair Rewards:** A changed challenge mode means if you work hard, you get better rewards. This encourages people to give their best.\n  \n- **Use What You Have:** With the new changes, owners will use more of their items and have fewer things just sitting around.\n  \n- **Good for Everyone:** We've thought about what everyone wants.

      "content": "EXP was, imo, correctly removed as a requirement. Yet many people had exp, which basically now goes to waste. \n\nWe should give 1 banked ice per 1 exp someone has.\n\nThis amount is \"very small\". Its more of a nice gesture. \nThis proposal doesn't necessarily serve to \"compensate\" someone for the exp they have, because one can argue that exp was never worth anything. Yet people who had exp will be happy.\nThe main point, and this is why I believe we should pass this proposal. Has to do with the fact exp is the best metric to \"give an airdrop\" to whom has really been with DG and supports DG.\n\nThe longer you have been in the project, with as many nfts, the more exp you have earned. Hence, by rewarding 1 banked ice (which people will use in sng or casino) for the exp they have, is literally rewarding the \"correct people\". DG has given airdrops before. (and owners are more likely to reinvest). 1k BI to people to check the casino, ect ect. Here we are giving to owners who, depending on how long and how many nfts they have, will get an airdrop of reasonable amount of banked ice.\n\nI therefore believe that the team should exchange 1 exp = 1 banked ice",

Specifically, have two daily leaderboards that pay out as follows: \n\n$80/day in $DG to 3 - 9 SHINE segment\n\n1st: $26\n2nd: $18\n3rd: $12\n4th: $9\n5th: $7\n6th: $5\n7th: $3\n\n$250/day in $DG to 15 - 99 SHINE segment\n\n1st: $80\n2nd: $50\n3rd: $35\n4th: $25\n5th: $22\n6th: $20\n7th: $18\n\nRationale (per spewystewie)\n\nThe current leaderboard system only rewards a small fraction of the player pool - those who are able to dedicate many hours to playing every single day.\nTo address this, we should get rid of monthly and weekly leaderboards and instead switching solely to daily leaderboards with more places being rewarded. \n\nThis change would very likely motivate recreationals and non-24/7 regulars to pull off a daily grind here and there, as they will have a much higher chance of winning enticing prizes -> Big increase in traffic from this massive part of the playerpool (I'd guess 80-90% of the PP is in this category).\n\n24/7 regulars will likely keep grinding anyway (most of them wouldn't make any money at all on other sites in normal raked environments, so they are kind of forced to stay here) -> Little to no traffic lost there.\nThe best regulars will earn more money. Even if they get slightly less rewards from the LBs, higher traffic makes up for it -> No traffic lost either.",

      "title": "Cross Chain Liquidity",
      "content": "Background\n\nDecentral Games currently holds $1.1m Ethereum mainchain DG/ETH liquidity and $670k Polygon DG/Matic liquidity. The team’s roadmap involves plans to expand their offering via deposits and withdrawals on multiple EVM compatible chains in the near future including but not limited to Arbitrum and Optimism.\n \n\nProposal\n\nBridge DG and xDG ERC20 tokens to Arbitrum and Optimism. Convert existing $335k worth of MATIC currently paired with DG on Polygon to ETH. Create three v3 liquidity pools on Uniswap. The currently allocated liquidity will be distributed as follows: \n\n- ⅓ will be used for DG/ETH liquidity on Arbitrum\n- ⅓ will be used for DG/ETH liquidity on Optimism\n- ⅓ will remain on Polygon as DG/ETH liquidity rather than DG/Matic liquidity\n\nAdditionally, add DG-xDG pools on OP and ARB to allow cross chain governance participation. The team has plenty of DG in the Treasury to seed this. \n\n\nRationale\n\n- As DG moves to add support for more chains it’s important to establish DG liquidity across these chains. This step creates a smoother process for purchasing, staking, and participating in governance across multiple chains.\n\n- Pairing exclusively with ETH across chains contributes to a broader narrative shift. By not being tied to Polygon as a “Polygon Project,” DG positions itself as an “Omnichain Project” more completely. This choice enhances the project's long-term narrative. Embracing a chain-agnostic approach and leaning into an omnichain narrative holds significant value for both marketing and partnership opportunities. By demonstrating a commitment to chain agnosticism, DG positions itself as inclusive to users regardless of their chain preference which will bolster the user base and increase volume.\n\n- Opting for exclusive DG liquidity pairing with ETH mitigates price volatility. DG price currently moves with both ETH and Matic fluctuations and although the two are fairly correlated, this is not known to be true in the future. Pairing DG exclusively with ETH safeguards against price oscillations and lowers the teams risk with regard to choosing Polygon as the winning L2.\n\n- It’s unknown which L2s will be winners and losers in the coming bull market. Rather than navigating the unpredictable landscape of Layer 2 solutions, reducing Matic exposure and moving liquidity to multiple chains (all paired in ETH) ensures DG hedges against potential winners and losers among L2 networks. By minimizing this exposure, DG gains a competitive advantage, irrespective of which L2 solution rises to prominence.",

Whatever comes first.\n\nMeaning. If this proposal passes, either until the team says otherwise or the next halving comes along, to upgrade nfts, someone will need 0 exp. Owners still earn exp.

      "title": "Verified Managers need to hold xDG",
      "content": "(after overwhelming support in the previous proposal, but not able to reach 10M, maybe due to the fact there wasn't enough time to vote over the weekend, I resubmit the proposal):\n\nCurrently, there is a google doc in DG discord where people can apply to be verified managers. This DG program started as a way to shift away from several managers offering management services and who would later turn out to be cheaters, or, owners using manager accounts to cheat without suffering the full consequences. \n\nBasically, after being verified, the DG team will give a \"verified manager\" role, and place the names of those people in a channel, so owners can easily find them.\n\nThis program is great, and managers are needed. Managers also get publicity from this, and are able to attract more owners. \n\nBut we also want managers who are bringing a financially positive contribution for the ecosystem. When a manager charges ei:15-20%, that is ice not going to the owner and going to the manager instead. As any member of this ecosystem, we hope manager reinvest most of their earning.\n\nProposal:\nIn order to be a \"verified manager\" a manager needs to hold between 10k and 20k xDG in their main wallet(s).\nThe team will set/pick/change what amount is necessary to be verified.\nThe team will check if verified managers maintain the necessary amount.\nTo give time for all managers to adapt, this rule will go into effect July15, and a 15days extension can be given, at the teams discretion, to managers who are slowly and constantly accumulating the xDG.\n\nConclusion: This proposal aims to show that verified managers also have skin in the game. Verified managers should also want this, and it gives a confidence level towards the owners. It is also important for verified managers to have a stake in DG as they interact with owners, and having managers care financially about the future of DG is a plus towards the ecosystem and owner retention/expansion of their guilds.\n\nRunning a management guild for over an year, I am confident this rule has the potential to be an added benefit to DG!",

      "title": "{DCL DAO} Chain Challenger: Bridging Web2 players to DCL, a gaming discovery platform.  ",
      "content": "Original link: https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=4aefa4a0-036a-11ee-8f51-bb3157c3bc20\n\nABSTRACT\nDecentraland's website traffic is currently dominated by English-speaking countries. However, China, Japan, and South Korea have a massive gaming market with over 70 billion gamers. Chain Challenger's mission is to connect Web3 games and metaverse projects with billions of Web2 gamers from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea. They plan to create a localized game wiki page, attract players through unique tournaments, and reduce barriers for Asian gamers. With Decentraland DAO's support, Chain Challenger aims to expand DCL's brand awareness and introduce new users in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nGRANT SIZE\n$105,000 USD in DAI\n\nPROJECT DURATION\n6 months\n\nPAYOUT STRATEGY\nMonthly on the 1st day\n\nBENEFICIARY ADDRESS\n0x5A1d993fF6E67aA214880C87B46255Ea32E24139\n\nEMAIL ADDRESS\ncharles.cheng886@gmail.com\n\nDESCRIPTION\nDue to the character limit, please visit the following link for the complete proposal:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1PYW7yCFUtZC7Rdr4ZzFbCMxxPtE9p4yp/view?usp=sharing\n\nThe first version of Chain Challenger was successfully launched on May 26, 2023, along with a 'Stadium Grand Opening' event that took place from May 26, 2023, to June 2, 2023. For more information, please refer to the links provided below.\n\nChain Challenger Official Website: https://chainchallenger.xyz/\nEvent Page: https://events.decentraland.org/event/?id=645a01af-9347-4654-b889-ffc809e8a7d0!\n\nAny project in DCL can apply to become a partner of Chain Challenger and gain exposure on the Chain Challenger website, especially in the Asian region. In the next version update, the Chain Challenger website will also add an interface for DCL, providing a better connection between DCL's ecosystem and external Web2 Gamers.\n\nChain Challenger's backend uses Strapi, the leading open-source headless CMS, which can provide a flexible and adaptable homepage framework for projects on DCL. This allows different projects to customize the categories and content that need to be included on their project pages according to their own needs, and to best meet the needs of different projects. At the same time, we will also provide free Chinese, Korean, and Japanese localization services for all our partner projects.\n\nIn addition, the 'Dual-Tournament Model' is another innovative and very important feature of Chain Challenger. Currently, most metaverse or blockchain gaming projects often fail to attract a large number of Web2 players during their promotions. The reasons behind this include: (1) friction generated when creating blockchain wallets, (2) stereotypical impressions of Web3 projects (surveys show that the vast majority of Web2 players still believe that NFTs or cryptocurrencies are Ponzi schemes), and (3) the learning curve of switching to new games - a problem that many project teams have overlooked, but is very important.\n\nAccording to Unity's report on multiplayer games in 2022 (https://create.unity.com/multiplayer-report-2022), a game's genre is the most important factor (>46%) for players when choosing a new game. In other words, players of multiplayer games develop a \"stickiness\" to the genres they love, just like how if legendary League of Legends player Faker were to choose a new game to play, he would be more inclined to choose Dota 2, another MOBA game, rather than PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS, an FPS game.\n\nChain Challenger utilizes a Dual-Tournament Model to match DCL games with popular Web2 games of similar genres, creating a \"mirror game.\" Separate reward pools are set up, with the DCL game offering larger rewards to boost conversion rates. For instance, Soul Magic, a casual simulation game, can be mirrored with LINE Brown Farm, a popular Web2 game in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Promotions and advertisements targeting LINE Brown Farm communities will attract players who will be enticed by the larger rewards in Soul Magic, increasing the likelihood of them trying the game.\n\nFurthermore, our team has formed strategic partnerships with multiple Web2 and Web3 gaming communities and projects originating from China, Japan, and Korea. These projects will be sequentially launched on Chain Challenger, opening up potential cross-project collaboration opportunities for projects on DCL.",

      "title": "Verified Managers need to hold xDG",
      "content": "Currently, there is a google doc in DG discord where people can apply to be verified managers. This DG program started as a way to shift away from several managers offering management services and who would later turn out to be cheaters, or, owners using manager accounts to cheat without suffering the full consequences. \n\nBasically, after being verified, the DG team will give a \"verified manager\" role, and place the names of those people in a channel, so owners can easily find them.\n\nThis program is great, and managers are needed. Managers also get publicity from this, and are able to attract more owners. \n\nBut we also want managers who are bringing a financially positive contribution for the ecosystem. When a manager charges ei:15-20%, that is ice not going to the owner and going to the manager instead. As any member of this ecosystem, we hope manager reinvest most of their earning.\n\nProposal:\nIn order to be a \"verified manager\" a manager needs to hold between 10k and 20k xDG in their main wallet(s).\nThe team will set/pick/change what amount is necessary to be verified.\nThe team will check if verified managers maintain the necessary amount.\nTo give time for all managers to adapt, this rule will go into effect July15, and a 15days extension can be given, at the teams discretion, to managers who are slowly and constantly accumulating the xDG.\n\nConclusion: This proposal aims to show that verified managers also have skin in the game. Verified managers should also want this, and it gives a confidence level towards the owners. It is also important for verified managers to have a stake in DG as they interact with owners, and having managers care financially about the future of DG is a plus towards the ecosystem and owner retention/expansion of their guilds.\n\nRunning a management guild for over an year, I am confident this rule has the potential to be an added benefit to DG!",

      "title": "[DCL] How should DG vote in the Tobik's latest proposal?",
      "content": "Hello, DG community. My name is Tobik and I create content about Decentraland (I have a big channel in the community and my videos usually are watched by NFT-related people >> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFqaIHjlnco&t=4s). Recently, I have decided to contribute here on DG because I concluded it's a good idea to work on top of it (since the vast majority of activity is here) and start conceiving this project as an ecosystem that can also benefit Decentraland.\n\nI have made a DAO grant proposal on the DAO of Decentraland to make a video part of a campaign on how to create your NFT store without needing to code. This video includes DG Live, a tool that allows brands to sell NFTs and accept payment methods such as $ICE (10% of it gets burnt), Coinbase, Binance and Credit Cards.\n\nBy creating this campaign and the video, it's easier to go to brands and start convincing them on installing the product and selling their digital collectables.\n\nAs I mentioned in the original proposal, I will deliver the video anyways no matter what you vote since I think it's crucial to improve both ecosystems (DG and Decentraland).\n\nHere is the DAO proposal: https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=6e67c3b0-01b0-11ee-8f51-bb3157c3bc20\n\nThanks and any questions please reach out (Tobik#0830).

      "content": "Governance Chat is slip into 100xdg 100k xdg 1M xdg\n\nRight now there is a bot that reads how much xdg a certain wallet has, and those gives your discord account the permissions. This is the same bot that gives people the crown or other related \"icons\" next to your name.\n\nWell, problem is, this does not reflect someone voting power. People have xdg in more than one wallet (example a ledger) and might have their nfts in another wallet. This means that some people, who use their playing/nft holding wallet as their main wallet, will not have access to other channels.\n\nWhile this makes sense to have a system check, and be automatic, we are talking about people who have invested into the project. The same way some admins might spend time giving 100ice to someone who got a bug, makes sense that some manual reviews are done for access to this government channels.\n\nProposal: for the 100k and 1M, there is a manually added role that will allow an user to access those channels (in discord you can have the automated role, and also a manual role where admins can add them to an user). This would allow those holders to participate in their corresponding channels. \n\nThe way this would be done, is once per month or once every 3 months (team can pick), there is a proposal that is created with 2 options: 100k and 1M. Anyone with those voted, would pick the option they want and comment their discord username. They would then open a ticket. Team would see, check and confirm that certain account has enough votes, and delegate to them the corresponding role, enabling them to participate in the chats.\n\nFurthermore, this also enables people to delegate their voting power to a certain person they trust, for both voting, and also to give them \"a voice\" in those channels.\n\nConclusion: This is not a drastic change nor nothing, but it also shows some personal service and care towards users who are invested in the project. And if the objective of having different channels is to have a distinction between voting power, and in a way to rewards those who accumulate xDG, it therefore makes sense that the team/admins, have just a little but more work to manually add those users to their corresponding channel.",

      "title": "Creation of $ice Liquidity Pool on Ethereum Blockchain",
      "content": "Background\n\nThe only way to purchase $ice token is currently on Polygon Blockchain which is a layer 2 protocol on top of Ethereum. We have taken steps in recent DAO proposals to make $ice token more attractive for the Ice Poker Ecosystem. While brighter days are around the corner for more positive price action, I feel as though we are hindering the number of holders of $ice token on just Polygon when there is much more liquidity and volume on Ethereum Blockchain.\n\nAccording to Dexscreener.com on 5/4/2023  at 10:23 UTC there is $1.13 billion in 24 hour volume on the Ethereum Blockchain. On Polygon Blockchain in the same period there was only $63.7 million. With this data Ethereum is a better blockchain for token discovery as compared to Polygon. \n\nProposal\n\nThe DAO Treasury currently holds 116,169,273 in $ice and $3,831,140 in stable coins (USDT/DAI) as of today. Have the team take $ice from the DAO treasury and create a pool on Layer 1 Blockchain with the option of DAI or USDT. Give the team the ability to determine which stable coin to use. Also giving the team the ability to determine the size of the liquidity pool as long as enough is provided to create a reasonable slippage for potential large trades. Uniswap would be the preferred DEX to create the pool due to high volume.\n\nRationale\n\nYou might ask \"How does this benefit Ice Poker?\". I will give some of my insights:\n\n1. A potential player can discover $ice token either through a DEX or word of mouth and do more research into Ice Poker. Now with Free Play Mode players can immediately jump in a table and discover that $ice can provide additional perks in our ecosystem. Player can next trade for $ice on Layer 1 and then bridge $ice to Polygon to purchase shine or upgrade wearables. \n\n2. More eyes are on Ethereum as compared to Polygon. The data speaks for itself. Not only are we creating an $ice pool on Ethereum that can potentially create a more attractive price, we are also passively marketing our token to a new set of eyes. \n\n3. There won't be a need to spend the time and gas to bridge assets to Polygon in order to immediately trade for $ice.\n\n",

      "title": "Acquire Malta Entity/Gaming License",
      "content": "**Background**\n\nWeb4 Ltd., the BVI entity responsible for issuing DG and ICE tokens and funding Decentral Games development, has the opportunity to acquire a majority (90%) stake in a Malta entity holding a Malta Gaming License. This license is highly regarded in the online gaming industry, surpassing those of Costa Rica, Curacao, and various others available.\n\nIn the past, Decentral Games offered Metaverse wager-based games under a Costa Rica Gaming License using a non-custodial architecture, allowing players to play with tokens on the Polygon blockchain directly from their wallets. At its peak, these games generated $250k - $300k per month in revenue for the treasury. However, this revenue was drastically offset due to Polygon gas fees (typically $100k - $150k per month) and the DG rewards (~$150k per month). Although novel and decentralized, our prior non-custodial gameplay design ultimately proved to be costly and inefficient. \n\nWe paused these wager-based games in January 2022 for the reasons outlined in passed governance proposal #QmQ4hDk. In summary: \n- The Polygon POS network became more congested as it gained popularity throughout 2021. This caused our monthly MATIC gas bill to increase drastically as we paid all player gas fees in our non-custodial architecture. Each blackjack hand/roulette spin was two transactions — a funding transaction and a payout transaction. Over time, these fees ended up severely eating into our gameplay revenue. \n- Block reorgs and RPC outages caused gameplay delays, resulting in a bad player experience. Although infrequent, this became more of an issue as the Polygon POS chain gained wider adoption. \n- The growth that play-and-earn blockchain gaming projects were able to achieve in such little time was attractive to us given our DAU numbers remained in the hundreds. Focusing our brand and resource allocation on this appeared to be most lucrative for the project at the time. \n\nThe setting we find ourselves in today, in April 2023, is drastically different from where we were back in January 2022. Amidst both a crypto- and marco-economic bear market, speculative demand on blockchain game assets has flatlined, new user growth has proven to be exceedingly challenging and expensive, and sound unit economics and revenue are paramount for survival. \n\nMetaverse Team Roadmap\n\nDecentral Games consists of two product and engineering teams — the Metaverse team and the Arcade Team. The Metaverse team in general has been in charge of improving the gameplay of the ICE Poker Metaverse gameplay experience. This team has most recently shipped a slew of bug fixes, Player Leveling integration, Assigned Seating algorithm improvements, and Metaverse SNG. On the other hand, our Arcade Team has shipped Player Hub, Onboarding funnel optimizations, Multiple game modes, Player Leveling Metaverse SNG, Prize Marketplace revamp featuring custom prizes, NFTs, tokens, etc, to name a few. \n\nWe’ve already completed the majority of the work in adding support for Banked ICE wagers in both Metaverse Blackjack and Roulette. This would serve as a proof of concept for adding ICE and other tokens as the gameplay will be very similar (offchain). Acquiring this license would allow us to plot out a highly lucrative Metaverse Team Roadmap to leverage our work from the last 3-4 years of Metaverse development to ultimately bring maximum value to the ICE ecosystem and the DG treasury.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nWe propose for Web4 Ltd. to acquire the Malta entity and its gaming license, establishing Decentral Games as the first Malta-licensed, metaverse casino. The costs involved in this acquisition include:\n- $100k for acquiring a majority stake (90%) of the entity holding the license.\n- Approximately $40k in additional one-time fees for Gaming Audit, Blockchain Audit, and initial contract with KYC partner.\n- $80k in annual recurring costs for license renewal, minimum gaming duties, Financial Audit / Malta Tax Return, retaining a local law firm, and Data Replication in Malta.\n\nThe total expenses would amount to around $220k throughout Year 1 and $80k annually thereafter. \n\nFees in ICE generated from the games would be burned, acting as a material force driving up our ICE burn-to-earn ratio, leveraging our Metaverse Blackjack and Roulette games to deliver value to the ICE Ecosystem. Should we decide to offer gameplay in other tokens such as DAI, MANA, ETH, etc, these fees will accrue to the DG Treasury.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nAs we look toward the rest of 2023 and beyond, adapting our existing Metaverse games to support ICE and potentially other tokens appears to be the highest yielding allocation of our Metaverse Team resources to bring maximum value to our ecosystem. While we remain focused on our goal of the Arcade/web product onboarding 1M+ users, this is not possible yet in the Metaverse due to the technical limitations; we’ve realized that it’s best to focus Metaverse development on bringing in the maximum amount of value given smaller player numbers. \n\nAdding support for ICE and potentially other token wager support in our existing metaverse games, adds a defensible ICE sink and revenue stream for the DG Treasury. The play-to-earn offering acts as a powerful player acquisition and growth tool while the wager-based games capture revenue to drive value to the ICE token, which ultimately brings value to the wearables. The result is a very powerful symbiotic relationship that delivers more value than the two parts individually.\n\nWith the completion of necessary audits, a new deposit/withdrawal processing method, and onboarding a KYC partner for withdrawals over a threshold to be compliant with Malta law — we can launch ICE wagers under the new Malta License in Q3 2023, and other token wagers soon thereafter with minimal development lift. We anticipate the wager-based games becoming highly profitable and adding considerable value to both ICE and the DG Treasury over time and we are excited by the prospect of launching the first Malta-licensed metaverse casino under the DG brand.\n\nA custodial gameplay approach parallel to that of Banked ICE wagers addresses issues we previously faced with high gas fees and transactional inefficiencies. While some brand concerns may persist, we will completely separate and differentiate the ARCADE and CASINO brands: \n- Decentral Games Arcade (Shine/Banked ICE gameplay, available for everyone)\n    - ICE Poker Arcade\n        - Free Play\n        - SNG\n    - ICE Poker Metaverse \n        - Challenge Mode\n        - SNG\n- Decentral Games Casino (ICE/Token gameplay, available only to players in permitted jurisdictions)\n    - Metaverse Blackjack\n    - Metaverse Roulette\n    - Metaverse Slots\n    - Metaverse (Cash) Poker\n\nPlayers residing in jurisdictions where wagers are illegal would only have access to the Decentral Games ARCADE, while players residing in jurisdictions that permit wagers supported by the Malta license would have access to both the Decentral Games ARCADE and CASINO. This would be enforced with geogating and KYC for withdrawals greater than the permitted threshold. \n\nAcquiring a Malta license from scratch would likely be similarly expensive and take significantly longer (1-2 years). The acquisition opportunity before us comes with valuable connections to the gaming authority, auditors, legal counsel, and a KYC provider, making it a more efficient and beneficial option for our ecosystem.\n\nGiven current market conditions and the valuable IP that we hold, we believe that acquiring the Malta Gaming License presents an excellent opportunity for Decentral Games to expand its gaming offerings and bring significant value to our ecosystem and community.\n",

      "title": "Fund Development, Servers, Software, and Prizes",
      "content": "**Background**\n\nSince we began building Decentral Games in 2019, the Web4 Ltd. development company has funded product development and other expenses using USDC seeded from capital raises in exchange for vested DG tokens. The development company has no other sources of capital, and 100% of all revenue generated since launch including NFT mint proceeds, secondary sale royalties, Polygon validator Node rewards, etc., have accrued to the Decentral Games DAO Treasury. Additionally, the DG Team individually and Web4 Ltd. donated the Polygon Node ($2M USD) and 403 parcels of LAND to the Treasury in 2021.\n\nDespite interest from VCs to purchase vested DG tokens, we’ve opted to not sell additional DG tokens at the current levels. We haven’t raised in approximately one year because we strongly believe that DG is undervalued given our suite of live products with thousands of daily active players, the value of our diversified Treasury, our highly engaged community, and our proven track record of relentlessly shipping valuable updates regardless of market conditions.\n\nBy reducing headcount and salaries over the last year, we’ve reduced our monthly stablecoin burn from a ~$400k peak during the midst of the bull market (early 2022), down to ~$230k today. Of that ~$230k per month, ~$210k pays the salaries of 48 people, and ~$20k pays for tools like Cloudflare, Segment, MongoDB, Azure, servers, and other miscellaneous services (e.g. Slack, Discord, Gmail, Github, etc). \n\n2023 Focus and Roadmap\n\nAs we dive into Q2 2023, our three main pillars of focus driving our product decisions and resource allocation are: \n\n1. Deliver a sticky gameplay experience (around progression and socialization) to retain new players. KPIs to measure our success in this objective include:\n   - Current users retention rate (CURR): The chance a user comes back this week if they came to the product each of the past two weeks\n   - New users retention rate (NURR): The chance a user comes back this week if they were new to the product last week\n   - Reactivated user retention rates (RURR): The chance a user comes back this week if they reactivated last week\n   - WoW retention rate: The percentage of players that come back each week from the prior week’s WAU\n2. Effectively convert free play players to paid players. KPIs to measure our success in this objective include:\n   - Conversion percentage to paid: What percentage of our free play players are we converting to paid players\n   - SNG/Free Play Daily Active Users Ratio (SNG/Free Play DAU Ratio): How many players are playing SNGs versus Free Play each day\n3. Entice ongoing player spending to achieve protocol profitability. KPIs to measure our success in this objective include:\n   - Player Lifetime Value (LTV): How much does the average player spend in our ecosystem\n\nIn Q1 2023 alone, we were able to deliver the following: \n- Player Hub on ICE Poker Arcade\n- Onboarding funnel optimizations to support social login/wallet creation\n- Multiple game modes with differing Shine entry on ICE Poker Arcade\n- Player Leveling on Both ICE Poker Arcade and ICE Poker Metaverse\n- Metaverse SNG\n- Prize Marketplace revamp featuring custom prizes, NFTs, tokens, raffles, etc\n- Assigned Seating V3 with extra fraud prevention\n\nAs we move into Q2 2023 and beyond, our highest priority roadmap items are: \n- Free Play Mode on ICE Poker Arcade \n- Chests (randomized loot box-esque rewards) unlocked by progressing in Player Level\n- Banked ICE wagers for Metaverse Blackjack and Roulette\n- New Raffle section on the ICE Poker Arcade Prize marketplace\n- Emotes utility in game as custom avatar win animation\n- Native wallet features on ICE Poker Arcade\n- Tiered shopping experience unlocked by Player Level\n- New in-game Emojis unlocked by Player Level\n- Private tables/lounges with custom URLs to share with friends\n- Spin-n-Go tournaments on ICE Poker Arcade\n- League Mode on ICE Poker Arcade\n- Shine NFTs purchasable with Fiat (credit card)\n\n**Proposal**\n\nUpon passage of this proposal and then bi-monthly going forward (end of month & mid-month): \n\n- Allocate $105k to continue the design, development, operations and marketing of Decentral Games and ICE Poker products.\n- Allocate $10k to cover costs for DG servers, software, hosting, and live Nodes (Decentraland, Polygon, Ethereum). \n- Allocate $10k to spend on ICE Poker Arcade prizes. This would include allocation to DAI bags and physical prizes but not LAND.\n\nAll future capital raises for vested DG tokens would go directly to the DG DAO Treasury to bolster our stable coin position. While we frequently receive offers to do so, we would target at least a $0.12 or greater DG price to consider this. \n\n**Rationale**\n\nOver the past 4 years of development, Decentral Games has matured into an ecosystem with several live products and robust economic levers at the DAO’s disposal. Now it’s time for the project to entirely operate out of a single treasury. \n\nGiven a $250k monthly burn rate and the substantial stablecoin position we hold, we’re able to keep shipping at our current pace for the next ~1.5 years, before allocating any other non-stablecoin assets in the Treasury ($17M in total assets). This also assumes the absolute worst case scenario — zero revenue and zero additional capital raises over this time period. While we should plan for the worst to ensure our survival, we believe we can substantially grow revenue by the end of 2023 and conduct additional capital raises in 2024 (as the crypto market recovers) to further extend our runway. \n\nThe DG Team has continuously proven that we are able to deliver high quality work and will continue to do so regardless of market conditions. This allocation of resources continues our path of delivering timely development updates to all our products and allows the DG team to focus on replenishing these resources with revenue in the near future.\n\nAdditionally, we recently launched the revamped ICE Poker Arcade Prize Marketplace, which has provided players with much more enticing prizes including IRL DG merch, popular tech products, tokens, and raffles. This, in turn, welcomes increased ICE demand, Shine purchasing, and daily active use of ICE Poker SNG. The initial allotment of real world prizes were funded by the DG Team to prove the model would be valuable for the ecosystem, but now we would need to fund from the Treasury in order to continue with this initiative.",

      "content": "Dear Decentral Games community,\n\nWe, MetaTrekkers, come to you with a proposal designed to strengthen our relationship and bring significant benefits to both brands.\n\nMetaTrekkers DAO proposal link: https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=9b270cc0-d042-11ed-9cb9-2563bc989482\n\nThis proposal is to use Decentral Games voting power and benefit the whole Decentralad community. You can also read in the proposal how the grant will be used to further develop our projects and contribute value to the community.\n\nIn relation with this, allow us to remind you what we’ve been doing together in the past and the value of our collaboration:\n\n1.Venice Music concert\nThis event has been the cornerstone of our collaboration because, from the very beginning we’ve shared the tasks and effort behind onboarding the performing artists and their fanbase. With your help we’ve created an easy, yet comprehensive “flash webinar” where the first locations to be presented to all the new metaverse users were the Decentral Games venue and the MetaTrekkers club. Following this 3-day long onboarding session, we’ve seen that almost 70% of the attendees had expressed the desire to be onboarded into the Ice Poker feature, resulting in an increased number of visitors and users for Decentral Games (especially Ice Poker).\n\nThe BeatTrekkers Series\nAs you may have noticed, the BeatTrekkers competition is taking place as we speak, with the latest DJ battle being the event with the highest number of attendees on (our) record – almost 400 unique users. This is another event where we’ve partnered and gave exclusive streaming rights to Decentral Games for the whole duration of the series, as each battle draws in more and more users. In the long term, those exclusive streaming rights translate into increased traffic, exposure and interaction for Decentral Games and MetaTrekkers as a brand.\n\nFuture plans\nFor MetaTrekkers it’s obvious that the relationship with Decentral Games is something that can birth amazing opportunities so, we went ahead and brainstormed a few more initiatives that we think can benefit both our projects. For now, we won’t get into elaborate details, but it’s safe to say we’re developing more series of events that will be unique in the Decentraland metaverse, where we’ll be onboarding big names from related industries and giving them a platform to create attractive content exclusive to Decentral Games and MetaTrekkers community members.\n\nHere's a sneak preview of our plans to come:\nDG will be the only venue (besides MetaTrekkers) where names like Yu-kai Chou (the godfather of gamification) and Texas Blockchain Council will host their seminars and talks\nTogether with DG, in the future we hope on creating an exclusive wearable that can transcend the virtual metaverse and offer the holders exclusive access to live features and rewards, beyond its obvious use in the metaverse\n\nWe appreciate you taking the time to read through our proposal and hope you’ll see the huge potential presented by the multidisciplinary platform we’re envisioning.\n\nThank you,\nMetaTrekkers",

      "content": "Background \nCurrently only AAW owners earn XP whether it's by delegating or playing themselves. Delegates on the other hand, play in most cases with more than (1) wearable as well as it being higher than rank 1, all the way until 25K Banked ICE (after halving) is reached to be able mint themselves a rank 1 with no XP earned up to this point. \n\nProposal \nLet delegates earn a percentage of XP earned. For example, if owner delegates 5 items and receives 30 XP delegate would get 15 XP awarded to them. (% to be adjusted at team's discretion) \n\nRational \nBy letting delegates earn XP, we can expect less wearables minted with banked ice being let go on the secondary floor for a quick profit, most importantly we are incentivizing the users to have slight advantage at upgrades when continuing a player-owner path rather to remain in a delegate position by either continuing to play for the remaining ICE balance towards upgrades or possibly inclined to purchase ICE.",

      "content": "Title: Increasing Sustainability for Ice and Wearable Holders\n\nThis proposal aims to change the linear decrease of each halvening to a degressive approach.\n\nIntroduction:\nIce and Wearable Holders are two important groups in the wearable NFT market. Ice holders are investors who hold the project's native token, ICE, and can earn ICE through various means, including delegation. Wearable holders hold NFTs that grant them access to unique in-game benefits. However with the current halvening system it is impossible to make the same amount (in ice) needed to buy these wearables. In this proposal, we aim to create a sustainable solution for both groups.\n\nObjectives:\nThe primary objective of this proposal is to increase sustainability for both ice and wearable holders. This will be achieved by changing the halvening timeframe from 6 months to every 15 months, reducing the rewards for each halvening,\n\nSolution:\nThe proposed solution is to change the halvening timeframe from 6 months to every 15 months(69weeks). This change will allow delegators to earn on average top 50 delegation up to 140k ICE until the next halvening (see math below). Additionally, reducing the rewards for each halvening will prevent underwhelming the wearable holders. Hereby suggesting changing the base rewards to a degressive state instead of a linear state. This means that for the next halvening rewards would go down by 40% instead of 50%, halvening after that 35%, after that 30% and so on..\nbase rewards would look like this: 150 (current) -> 90 (2nd halv) -> 60(3rd halv) -> 40 -> 30\n\nWe also recommend increasing the time period for wearable holders to accumulate ICE. Currently, wearable holders must invest a significant amount of ICE to acquire a high-level wearable. In order to maintain the value of wearables, we propose a longer time period for accumulation. Wearable holders can accumulate ICE for a longer period of time before each halvening, while not being underwhelmed compared to ICE holders.\n\nConclusion:\nThe proposed solution will benefit both ICE and wearable holders. It will provide a sustainable solution for wearable holders by maintaining the value of their NFTs, and it will allow ICE holders to earn more ICE in a more sustainable way. Changing the halvening timeframe to every 15 months, reducing the rewards for each halvening, and increasing the time period for wearable holders to accumulate ICE are essential steps in achieving sustainability for the wearable NFT market.\n\nMath:\nlvl1wb: 140$ : 22,745 ice\nactivation fee: 1400 ice\nlevel 2: 3000 \nlevel 3: 4000 \nlevel 4: 5000 \nlevel 5: 7000\nso that mean on average 24000 + 19000 = 43000 ice for 1 wearable times 5 this is 215k ice for 5 level 5 wearables, \nfor the example i will use my 55544 stack level 5s: (430003) +  level 4s: (360002) = 201k ice\n\nfor the relevant example we will count in ice because wearable price is tied to ice.\nthis means that it cost me 201k ice to get this wearable stack.\n201000/305 = 660 days without halvening, however this used to be around 700 for long time so will use this.\n\nDelegator pov of current halvening system.\nSo every day i earn 305 ice on delegations on an average of top 50; this can continue for 182 days because 1 halvening = 6months, \nice per week: 305*7 = 2135\nIce per 6month: 2135*26 = 55510\nAfter that for every next halvening its 27500; 13500; 6700,...\n\nPlayer pov:\nbasically 2x of delegator pov so 110k ice, 55k\n\nDelegator pov with proposal system:\nice per week: 305*7 = 2135\n2135*69 = 147315\n201000 (cost of wb stack)-147315 (ice earned before next halvening) = 52685 ice \n\n2135 * 0.6 = 1281\n52685/1281 = 41.\nThis means that another 41 weeks are needed before earning the wb stack back making a total of 110 weeks.\n\n\n",

      "title": "Allow owners to choose their own % of Banked ICE/ICE ratio with a min of 20%",
      "content": "Background\n\nIn order to increase the DAU player growth and maintaining value within the ecosystem via Banked ICE propose increasing Banked ICE for Challenge Mode player-owners’ and guild owners’.\nBanked ICE is effectively maintaining value within our ecosystem and seeding Tournament Mode player liquidity via an attractive Banked ICE to Shine conversion rate (20% discount). Furthermore, folks who stack Banked ICE have access to a ~20% discount on minting an All Access Wearable. All in all, the Banked ICE architecture has provided upward mobility through reinvestment of earnings, immediately improved our burn-to-earn ratio, and catapulted us much closer to long-term sustainability.\n\nBanked ICE is an extremely attractive asset to anyone who is serious about re-investing within our ecosystem. It makes sense to extend this offer to all participants in our ecosystem – not just delegated players.\n\nProposal\n\nAllow Challenge Mode player-owners’ and guild owners’ daily ICE to choose how much Banked ICE and ICE they want to earn with a minimum of 20% Banked ICE.\n\nWe currently emit ~0.6M unlocked ICE per day. This proposal would reduce our daily unlocked ICE emissions, improving our Burn-to-earn ratio for the owners that want more Banked ICE.\n\nRationale\n\nIf someone is planning on re-investing of their ICE earnings (for instance buying Shine to play Tournament Mode or saving up to mint another wearable), then receiving more in Banked ICE is a great opportunity.\n\nBy allowing player–owners and guild owners into the Banked ICE ecosystem with a% of their earnings, they get to buy Shine at a 20% discount.\n\nThe main argument against this proposition is that it may take longer to upgrade metaverse wearables from earnings because you can’t use Banked ICE to upgrade. Owners will still be able to accrue most of their earnings in unlocked ICE in order to upgrade their wearables.\n\nBy opening up Banked ICE to our whole community – delegated players, player-owners, and guild owners alike – we will welcome more growth and reinvestment within the ecosystem as a whole, which will benefit all participants.",

This was due to Circle (the company who issues USDC) holding $3.3B of their $40B+ reserves for USDC on Silicon Valley Bank and due to DAI being 1/2 backed by USDC collateral.\n\nWe do not have any direct exposure to SVB, but when this started to unravel yesterday, we moved all the USDC we hold in the company into USDT to preserve value and secured a solid ~99 cents on the dollar. We did not, however, do this with DAO funds as it would require a proposal to do so. The current price of DAI is $0.935462 (4M+ held in our treasury stablecoin position) and the current price of USDC is $0.921166 (1.1M+ held in the ICE-USDC LP). \n\nProposal\n\nGive the team the discretion to balance the stable coin (stables to other stables) and LP positions in the treasury. \n\nRationale\n\nWe need to be able to act quickly to preserve as much value in the treasury as possible.",

We have opted not to sell it at a steep discount. \n\nProposal\n\n(1) Keep 100 of the 150 parcels at the team's discretion to sell. \n\n(2) Allocate UP TO the remaining 50 parcels as prizes redeemable for BADGES in the prize marketplace with 10 listed to start. \n\nRationale\n\nThis was discussed with the community in the forum in Discord over the last week, but the primary rationale is that, like the physical prizes we have introduced, these will serve as an ICE Sink by way of $ICE --> SHINE --> BADGES --> LAND. \n\nSecondly, the DG DAO hasn't made plans to use this LAND and we have significant room to expand our DAU in the parcels other parcels we have. More details about this are in the proposal linked in the Background section. While this is unused, we would love to see members of the DG DAO and other players claim this LAND and develop it.

This gives a boost to most people. Making most people more happy.

If you play well you will earn more, but we also want non Poker players to come, have fun, spend time playing, buy a NFT and upgrade because they like how a spartan helmet look in gold, ect ect\"\"\"\n    \n     \n![fff.jpg](ipfs://bafkreidvrlx4bspbwdaxnkquwnr6ilptntrvhr2gkapyxyjvvpbl4ldife)\n     \n  \n![ddd.jpg](ipfs://bafkreidkco36jxxffc4eskthd44zxjz5n3sh7wtouzzgbb7fr2j4amqt5i)\n    \n    \n    ",

      "content": "Background\n\nIn the past, we have developed the entire code necessary to play blackjack, roulette & cash poker with off-chain assets. This codebase can currently be found on tominoya scene, in which players can engage on the games using chips.\nWhen the games were available they used to drive many users to it, and the quality of gameplay is actually quite good.\nWe also know that ICE sinks / Sources of revenue are one of the main priorities right now to be able to generate a sustainable economy.\n\nProposal\n\nEnable Blackjack, roulette & cash poker tables in which users can play using either banked ICE or Shine\n\nRationale\n\nA lot of efforts have been made to develop these games, not only efforts, but a lot of money was poured into the development of these games in the order of millions, not thousands.\nIt makes sense to try to find a way in which we can make use of this code.\nWith this approach, it will be compliant with regulations since both of these assets, banked ICE and Shine are both assets which cannot be redeemed directly into money or they cannot be acquired.\n\nBanked ICE is an asset which allows the user to engage on SnG tournaments, redeem them for AAW wearables or for ICE with a slash, but cannot be acquired, only earned by playing.\n\nShine is an asset which can be acquired but cannot be redeemed for prizes, it can only be used to enter SnG tournaments.\n\nWith a not so high effort we can generate a huge ICE sink using the code we have already developed.\n\nThe proposal aims to reuse the existing code, not to refactor it into a tournament of blackjack & roulette which after grabbing community feedback didn't seem to be quite an appealing option.\nThe main reasons why it's not an appealing options are, on one hand because it requires a commitment of time instead of allowing the users to play the number of hands they want, this is the same situation we can see on SnG, users can't just log in to play a few couple of hands, they need to commit and play the entire tournament.\nAnd on the other hand, since users are betting using non-cash off-chain assets this solution is already less appealing than what we used to have of real money gambling.\nThe main point of this proposal is to place the efforts on solutions that require low efforts and high impact.\nIf we end up using a lot of development resources to develop a tournament mode of blackjack & roulette and then people don't use it, it's a waste of money & time that could have been used for something else.\n\n",

      "title": "Punish Illegally Minted ICE",
      "content": "Background:\n\nIn all type of games there is going to be a degree of cheating, especially when there is a financial interest behind. ICE poker is no different and we are all aware that there is cheating going on. By cheating I am directly referring to what is called “chip dumping”, this is a form where someone will purposely lose to another account they own or have connection to, in order to make one of those accounts get a higher multiplier and therefore more ICE.\n\nThe financial component of this activity is increased when using weaker NFTs, or from NFTs delegated from unaware owners, to NFTs of either owners participating on cheating, or directly owning the NFTs.\n\nLets expand this likely scenarios:\n-\tYou own NFTs, you go in look for someone to delegate NFTs to you, and you lose from the delegated account to the account you created to play your own NFTs. Here, even when the playing accounts get banned, the owning account won’t be (or less likely to be).\n-\tYou are just a player. You have an owner (or a manager), who is aware you are a cheater. He therefore is willing to keep delegating to new accounts as yours get banned. Sometimes the owner might even pay the cheating player extra ICE as part of a nefarious deal.\n\nTherefore we have both a wave of new accounts being created. Owners either wasting their time finding players to have their accounts dumped, or owners, willingly or not, profiting from a poor vetting (or deliberately).\n\nTriumviratus Guild, (a Manager Guild that offers to manage owners NFTs), has been for a long time reporting cheaters, many times self reporting its own players. As of recently, with new owners requesting Triumviratus Manager services, due to recommendations and positive feedback, we have access to several guilds history. And the amounts of banned accounts are astonishing… These are good people who either had cheating managers or bad luck. As an investor it might become even more work to constantly find new players, to constantly have accounts banned, and eventually get his own account banned as a consequence... This isn’t even taking into account owners who purposely do the cheating and collaborate. Either eventually shifting blame to the manager, or, paying the activation fees to move the wearables. This is a very small punishment for what is basically stealing money from the community, and very profitable to do.\n\nIllegally minted ICE can be a substantial % of the overall ICE mints. I would not be surprised if the numbers (which we haven’t been able to obtain), rounded in the 15-25% (one account for example had ~300 past addresses delegated, of which today only ~30 past addresses aren’t banned). This causes the price of ICE fall, as cheaters don’t reinvest in the project. Additionally this takes the top spots to honest players. Being able to stop this would not only be the fair and correct thing to do, but also help the price of ICE, and make honest players earn more by achieving higher multipliers. \n\nEven with V3 coming into effect, there will always be cheaters, even if they are reduced by 90%, some will still be able to cheat, therefore those caught should face consequences. The following proposal aims to fix that by tackling the financial component of this problem.\n\n.\n\nProposal:\n-\tOwners get 70% of the illegally minted ICE by cheating (banned) accounts confiscated. \n-\tThis confiscation will be by deducting the banked ICE from the owners. That number can go negative (below 0).\n-\tICE confiscation can only be the last 5 days (active played days) of the banned player.\n\n.\n\nRational:\nCurrent measure of cheating punishment will still go into place. An owner who is caught cheating will still get bans as they do today.\n\nThe proposal aim is to tackle 2 main aspects:\n-\tThe newly made accounts, who after 3 days get banned\n-\tNot allowing owners to massively profit, knowingly or not, from cheating activities.\n\nIn this proposal, a player who cheats can make the owner 1600+ daily ICE. At the end of the day, the owner still gets to keep ~500 ICE. This is already a reasonable amount to keep, and maybe not as drastic than it could be – and in a future proposal it can be increased – but at least they aren’t getting 1600+ daily ice.\n\nThere is literally a financial disadvantage to attempt to stop cheating in your own guild and to report your suspected cheaters. Or even allow some to happen. After all, if someone cheats for you, as an owner, you are massively profiting. Now you will get below average ICE rewards. It is no longer worth, from a financial standpoint, allowing this.\n\nFor owners who are cheating, or collaborating with cheaters via payments, we just cut their gains by a lot. Hopefully enough not to sustain this economic module. \n\nFrom the owners who get players with -5000 constantly due to cheaters, and the time spent dealing with this problem, they are less likely to be prayed by cheaters, as those cheaters no longer have owners on the other side as willingly to cheat. Dumping only happens when you have where to dump to…\n\nThis also doesn’t greatly punish an owner who had a player for, example, 2 months, and who just started to cheat in the end, or did a less serious offense. He will still be penalized up to 5 playing days, but not for the whole 60 playing days. The main issue is the cheating rings who constantly make accounts every 3 days, for top 10/5%. And the ICE that (or any other form of cheating) produced.\n\nA delay on the confiscation of ICE is also wise by the team (and at the team discretion to when apply it) as to give time for people to contest the ban + allow the team to internally organize their working day to complete this task.\n\nBe this 20% of the illegal ICE minted, be it 2% in the future, be it 0% when there is no more cheating. This proposal makes sense, it’s able to be implemented quickly, its fair and necessary for the community. It tackles this cancer in ICE poker, and will greatly benefit everyone – well everyone but these cheaters. \n",

All the items were programmatically generated and stored as ERC721 tokens on Ethereum Blockchain.\n\nProject Highlight:\n\n1. MetaDoge is the first ever PFP NFT that can let users swap to their 3d avatar in Decentraland even before DCL has linked wearable. (Only in 146,60, Meta GamiMall for now) Please check the above pictures to see what they look like. The holder can simply press a button to swap to their 3d avatar in Meta GamiMall.\n2. MetaDoge has extra game utility in Meta GamiMall in Decentraland\n3. MetaDoge will share part of the revenue of the creator Meta Live Studio\n\nHow benefits DG?\n\nDG and MetaDoge have a good history of collaboration in the past, DG was a premium sponsor of our last MetaMine event in Decentraland. And together, we published a wearable called Decentral Games Cyber-Trouser which gain large popularity among the community. https://market.decentraland.org/contracts/0x199c20d3cd178abd23e3e62c91cfce5aeb1ff52f/items/0\n\nMetaDogeNFT is a PFP project that largely focuses on Decentraland players, and due to our collaborative relationships with DG, MetaDoge would potentially be an extra source for DG's traffic. Thus if this proposal gets passed, it would benefit DG's economy in return, and we would deal with all the costs of the creation. \n\nPlus, we would organize more dedicated events to take our holders to DG's scenes and games, and there will be more fun collaborative events in the future.\n\nAppreciate all the support!!!\n\nBest regards,\nMetaDoge\n",

      "title": "ICE Sustainability: Finite ICE Supply via Halving + All Access Wearable Bonus Rewards",
      "content": "**Background**\n\nOver the past year, our central focus has been to attain balance in the ICE burn-to-earn ratio, with the ultimate goal of stabilizing the price of ICE. To achieve this, we have successfully implemented a series of governance proposals that have:\n\n- Decreased emissions from Metaverse Challenge Mode\n- Switched wearable activations from DG to ICE\n- Committed 100% of Polygon Validator rewards revenue to buy ICE\n- Committed 100% of secondary sale royalties revenue to buy ICE\n- Committed 100% of metaverse advertising revenue to buy ICE\n\nAdditionally, we introduced an off-chain asset, Banked ICE (for delegated players), to reduce our direct liquid ICE emissions, and we gamified the burning of ICE with Tournament Mode to welcome organic ICE demand — all to offset the high daily emissions from Metaverse Challenge Mode. \n\nDespite making solid progress on reducing emissions and improving burn, we still are not at a 1:1 burn-to-earn, and we must act in the immediate term to bring balance to the ecosystem and restore a positive narrative around ICE, ICE Poker, and Decentral Games.\n\n**Proposal**\n\n- We allocate Metaverse advertising revenue to purchase ICE.\n- We allocate secondary sales royalties revenue to purchase ICE.\n- We halve the ICE Rewards per challenge biannually with the first ICE Halving occurring on **February 15th, 2023**. Similar to the capped supply design of bitcoin, this would cap ICE supply due to the sum of the infinite series of (½)^n having a finite limit as n approaches infinity.\n- We give the team the discretion to reduce ICE activation and upgrade costs, as well as the minimum claimable ICE after each halving event as needed.\n- After reaching > 1 burn-to-earn without treasury purchases of ICE, we allocate 50% of secondary sale revenue and metaverse advertisement revenue to buying ICE and accrue the other 50% in the treasury. Additionally, we allocate economic surplus (net ecosystem spending) to All Access wearables holders weekly via a randomized ICE/Shine drip. \n   - Economic surplus would be calculated as the net revenue from Shine and upgrades purchases minus the emissions generated from them via prizes redeemed. *In other words, if burn-to-earn is 1.5, then 50% of the extra 0.5 (surplus) will be distributed to active owners of All Access wearables via bonus rewards.*\n   - Bonus rewards would be randomized and given to All Access wearable owners who have played the most in the last 7 days. Metaverse check-ins and SNG days played at least 1 tournament qualify an owner for the economic surplus bonus rewards. The more days you check-in/play SNG, the more wearables you have, and the higher rank of your wearables — the higher probability you would be included in the bonus rewards drop. This way, we incentivize our owners to play *the bare minimum*, while giving large guild owners an advantage from their larger collections.\n   - The economic surplus would be calculated on a weekly time frame, and then distributed in ICE/Shine (Shine would be addable to a wearable of the owner's choosing). \n- We allow the team to update the price of Shine in ICE based on ICE price appreciation to ensure 1 Shine doesn’t exceed 1.5 USD (100 ICE currently = 1 Shine, so this would potentially go into effect once ICE > 0.015 USD). In updating the price of Shine in ICE, we would also adjust the ratio of Badges to ICE, Shine, and All Access wearables accordingly. This way, if the price of ICE increases drastically following a new narrative, the entry price for SNG tournaments doesn’t balloon too high as well. \n\n**Rationale**\n\nBy implementing a finite supply cap of ICE through bitcoin-style halving events, we can achieve a 1:1 burn-to-earn ratio after the first halving event, and reinvigorate ICE with a strong narrative of digital scarcity. \n\nWhile the biannual halving in ICE per-challenge reward may be initially concerning for All Access wearable holders, it presents a significant opportunity for our community. At this point, All Access Wearable holders can absolutely understand that it doesn’t matter how much ICE they are earning if the value and narrative around ICE is constantly diminishing. It has become clear that a positive narrative around ICE is more powerful than any amount of ICE reward per challenge. A limited supply combined with growing demand for ICE via Shine purchases will push the burn-to-earn ratio above 1:1, establishing a new narrative of digital scarcity that can bring long-term benefits to our ecosystem.\n\nCurrently, our burn-to-earn ratio stands at **0.45**, excluding ICE purchases from metaverse ads, secondary sales, and Polygon validator node rewards. With these purchases included, the ratio stands at **0.82**. Of the 0.45 burn-to-earn ratio, roughly 0.3 comes from Upgrades and Activations and 0.15 comes from Shine purchases. If we assume that the total ICE burned via Upgrades and Activations is also halved, the contribution of SNG grows inversely with the reduction of emissions. \n\n- After 1st halving on **2/15/2023** - **0.6 B/E** w/o purchases; **1.23** w/ purchases\n- After 2nd halving on **8/15/2023** - **0.9 B/E** w/o purchases\n- After 3rd halving on **2/15/2024** - **1.5 B/E** w/o purchases\n\nThere are two reasons to be optimistic about reaching a 1:1 burn-to-earn ratio even sooner than this schedule: (1) the dramatic increase in ICE burned from Shine purchases to play SNG as we onboard more users, and (2) the launch of a new Flex-native prize redemption marketplace with irl prizes to provide larger incentives to play SNG — both of which will drive increased demand for ICE/Shine. \n\nAll in all, if implemented, this proposal immediately gives our ecosystem a clear set plan to get to and past a 1:1 burn-to-earn ratio, while paving the way for sustainable bonus rewards for All Access wearable owners as ecosystem spending (revenue) grows past base ICE rewards in the future.",

      "title": "reproposal of diversifying revenue stream but the eth must be newly purchase with dai and does not conflict the node proposal.",
      "content": "This proposal is a followup from Diversifying Revenue Streams and Increasing Revenue for 1:1 Burn+Buyback Ratio with changes. \n(https://snapshot.org/#/decentralgames.eth/proposal/0x181f79fc27bea9e0fbc8f06c0a3b8f903d5e7215f36f4168c810addd6c4f5c1e)\nTLDR: it is a copy but specifies that the eth used for the lp must be purchased over time with dai and will not interfere with the node proposal.\n\nThe idea behind this proposal is to use some of the 4mil+ dai we have left to generate a revenue stream big enough that is capable of stablizing the price of ice at its current point so we get an increase in player growth and less players quitting.\nIt is supposed to tackle our short term issues while we would need 5+m dai in eth nodes to generate the same revenue.\nShort term issues are attracting new players is difficult because ice keeps dropping while not taking out funds directly to purchase more ice.\n\nProposal:\n\nTitle: Diversifying Revenue Streams and Increasing Revenue for 1:1 Burn+Buyback Ratio\n\nBackground:\nThe DG Dao currently generates around 9k in revenue weekly from different sources. In order to achieve a 1:1 burn+buyback to mint ratio, the revenue needs to be increased by 2 times. The idea is to buy time for the team to implement major changes while keeping a stable ice price, which will lead to more new players joining and less players quitting.\n\nProposal:\nIn order to diversify the revenue streams, I propose adding liquidity on the uniswap v3 usdc-weth pool (https://defillama.com/yields/pool/665dc8bc-c79d-4800-97f7-304bf368e547). This is a very safe way of generating more revenue while not being heavily exposed because it is paired with usdc (IL calculator https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/).\n\nThe average APY of this pool is around 30% and works the same way as the ice-usdc, the only difference is that the pool is operated by uniswap V3 and has 185Mil liquidity already in.\n\nWith some of the new changes, around 600k ice per day will be more earned than burned. This means that around 600k ice needs to be purchased, where we currently purchase half of that. In order to increase this to the breakeven, the revenue needs to grow to 18k on average.\n\nUsing the calculation of 30% APY, this would mean that 1.55M$ total should be added as WETH-USDC liquidity 30% of 1.55Mil = 465000 / 52 = 8950.\n(can be adjusted by the team if the 1:1 ratio is fulfilled with less then 1.55M$)\n\nIn uniswap v3, you have the option to use concentrated positions. This means that you can provide the min price and max price yourself to maximize the returns. I suggest putting a min price of 300 and a max price of 3000. This means that if eth were to drop to 300 all of the usdc would be converted to eth and vice versa if eth goes to 3000.\n\nBecause of this concentrated position, the rate is not exactly 1:1 but rather 0.6:1. This means that about 1Mil usdc can be added while being paired with 370 eth (550k~). (I think these numbers are doable without having too much risk as there is 4+m dai)\n\nAll of this revenue will go toward buying back ice while not taking out funds from the treasury to buy ice directly.\n\nThe eth used for this proposal must be newly purchased with dai over time and will not interfere with the node proposal.\n\nConclusion:\nAdding liquidity to the uniswap v3 usdc-weth pool is a safe and effective way to diversify revenue streams and increase revenue for the 1:1 burn+buyback ratio. The concentrated position option in uniswap v3 allows for maximizing returns while minimizing risk. All generated revenue will be used for buying back ice.\n",

      "content": "This is similar to what we experienced in the DG DAO last year when one of our members was banned. The decision was later overturned and now the DG DAO uses time-outs/mutes in the Discord instead of bans. Permanently banning people does not fit well with the fundamentals of web3/blockchain, and time-outs/temporary mutes are a more effective way of moderating conversations.\n\nI believe that this DCL DAO proposal deserves a vote to \"Unban\".\nWhile I do not agree with the methods that Tudamoon used, I don’t think his methods were very diplomatic, he did call out a project that ended up having its grant revoked. Saving the DCL DAO a lot of $$… Debates for the accountability committee position are going to be starting soon and I think he should be able to participate in those upcoming discord conversations, him being someone who has actively made efforts to hold grants accountable. I believe everyone deserves a 2nd chance and I am not a big fan of censorship/banning people even when we disagree with the way that they speak. Hopefully we will see a more diplomatic approach from him going forward, because holding grants accountable in a DAO is an important task.",

      "content": "Background\n\nThe DG DAO has been using USDC removed from the ICE-USDC pool last year as well as all revenue from MATIC rewards, Secondary Sales, and Marketing efforts to buy ICE, pair with USDC, and add to the ICE-USDC pool.\n\nWe currently have ~$60K left from the USDC allocation and $12K left from our recent LAND sale to buy ICE and add to the LP.\n\nWe expect Proposal #bafkrei ('Change Income Allocations') to pass which will (1) Redirect MATIC rewards and Marketing Revenue to buying DG, and (2) Allocate Secondary Sales to buy and burn ICE.\n\nProposal\n\nFuture purchases of ICE will be held by the DG DAO.\n\nRationale\n\nThis will extend our timeline and efficacy of the buys since half of the remaining ~$72K won't be used as the USDC side of the ICE-USDC pair. If we're able to sell the remaining 150 parcels of LAND, it's also worth noting that 10% of those proceeds would be used to buy and hold ICE. ",

This is close to the ~10% reduction in $ICE rewards. \n\nWe are also taking into account the fact that a Level 5 wearable makes ~35% more than Level 1 as a player owner and ~76% more than a Level 1 delegating (since the owner split increases 30% from 40% to 52%). Given the wearable floor price in $ICE and the cosmetic & other benefits to owning a Level 5 wearable, we believe 30,000 $ICE in total to Upgrade is approximately the right cost to incentivize more upgrades.

      "content": "My name is Jakub (jakubx.eth) and I'd like to ask for your support in our latest DCL governance proposal: https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e8de87c0-957a-11ed-ae61-5f6dd0bf8358\n\nOur goal, in short, is to bring Dynamic Avatars (based on PFP collections) to Decentraland (starting with Fancy Bears), which will be a first of a type implementation ever. Dynamic NFTs infrastructure that we created together with Morris Mustang allows you to dynamically modify your PFP my minting and staking new traits (which are also separate NFTs). The modification would apply both to OpenSea jpg AND to DCL avatar. \n\nWe cover all the costs and we believe it's both cool, fresh and will bring new users to Decentraland, which in turn will allow DG to target a broader user base. We are also looking forward to partner up with DG. \n\nThat's why we'd like to ask for your support.\n- TT: @jakubchmielniak & @BartekSibiga\n\nLonger description of what we do below: \n\nWe are the creators of Fancy Bears, one of the biggest PFP projects. We sold 8k NFTs in January for 5 mln USD in 8 minutes, our community consists of 100k people from all over the world. \n\nOur main product is a dynamic NFTs infrastructure and a marketplace we build on top of it. Right now all NFTs are static, which means they don't change, the metadata can't be altered, and we allow that alteration: picture, traits, everything can be modified. We want people to personalize their online avatars and build their online identities on blockchain. We are creating an infrastructure and a marketplace to allow them to do that. \n\nThe reason is because we believe that all PFP NFT projects like Bored Apes or Fancy Bears will become the universal avatars that you'll be able to use in different metaverses (like Decentraland or Sandbox) and games. We allow both the customization of these avatars (that's why we work with the top brands like Diesel, Maison Margiela, Off White), and the creation of digital assets like jackets, hoodies and so on. It's all web3, all on blockchain. \n\nWe work with numerous partners like eToro, Binance NFT, Crypto.com, Vlaunch, OTB Group: Diesel, Maison Margiela, Jil Sander, Amiri, Samsung, Farfetch Group, Luxottica, Coca Cola, Sandbox, WWEB, and many more.

At the current floor price of ~$2,000 per parcel, 1,007 parcels is ~$2M in value.  The parcels DG owns are shown in Blue and Green in the image below. \n\n246 connect parcels shown in dark blue:\n\n150 parcels: ([-150, 108], [-150, 122], [-141, 108], [-141, 122])\n96 parcels: ([-90, 91], [-90, 96], [-75, 91], [-75, 96])\n  \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifjdjyzvvcqb4vb7nyjtvvc5i6ck7dvaxe3t7nr5m3kclv7cldcei)\n\nProposal\n\nGrant the DG Team the ability to sell up to 246 parcels out of those outlined in the Background section. Proceeds will be converted into DAI and held in the Treasury.  Of these, 10% of the proceeds will be used to add to ICE-USDC LP. \n\nRationale\n\nIf the DG DAO sells all of these parcels, the remaining 761 are more than sufficient to grow our current operations in Decentraland; in fact, we have room to grow ICE Poker back into some of the venues we shut down in 2022. With the introduction of ‘islands,’ we can also fit more users into a single venue than we could at the start of last year.  \n\nAt the current floor price, 246 parcels is ~$492K. While the floor price may move and we can’t predict buyer interest and price-point exactly, it’s valuable for the DAO to add to its $4.3M stable coin position in this bear market. A sale price cannot be guaranteed in advance, but the DG Team is sufficiently aligned to pursue the best possible price for the DAO. Finally, allocating 10% of the proceeds to add to the ICE-USDC LP extends our ability to support the price of $ICE while UA continues to ramp up. ",

(Exception only to natural diisconnects)\n\n\nThis proposal will help eliminate some of its current collusion as well as the lack of table etiquette. As an owner of multiple sets of wearables, changes like this would entice me as well as others to play more.\n",

We're the makers of the WonderMine mining and crafting game in Decentraland. WonderMine is a social play-to-earn game where you mine meteors, collect resources and craft upgrades and rewards in the form of wearables and other NFTs. WonderMine continues to be one of the most popular locations in Decentraland, with an active and passionate community and over 1400 unique players per day. WonderMine is one of the first places new players visit, and we usually have several players mining at any given time, in addition to pulling upwards of 300 - 1000 concurrent players during our events.\n\nWhile the WonderMine mining field is a popular social spot to chat in Decentraland, the gameplay is entirely singleplayer. Therefore we're applying for a DCL grant to elevate the gameplay and introduce multiplayer mechanics, as well as other feature updates and visual updates. This is why we are asking the DG community for support on our grant proposal. WonderMine, being one of the most popular games in DCL, is still bringing in new players to the platform every day. We have a very significant player retention, and with our roadmap for 2023 we hope to help even more new players come to DCL and give them a reason to return regularly. Since we had our alpha launch in 2020, we've given out **nearly 20k wearables** to the community, as well as **over 3600 WonderZone Pickaxe NFTs**. We've hosted over **20 \"2x Loot Drop events\"** and had over a **dozen collabs** with other creators in the space, including DG.\n\n#### Here's a quick TL;DR for our roadmap:\n- By adding an **event space in WonderMine**, we can bring even more new players in through events and collabs, and with our gameplay we believe we can make them stay\n- By adding **multiplayer features to the gameplay** such as **shared and cooperative meteors**, we make the gameplay more engaging and keep the players more involved\n- By creating a more attractive **Town Square central hub** to WonderZone, players will get a new entry point to the game as well as a place to hang out and get information about the game as well as DCL\n- Continuing to **deliver wearables and WonderZone NFTs** to our players gives value to the community, and keeps players coming back for more\n\nWith funding to expand the game, we're confident WonderMine will continue to be one of the top destinations in all of Decentraland, and that we can keep bringing new players into the space.\n\nWe appreciate the consideration of the DG DAO and community to support our DCL grant proposal. \n#### Thank you!",

      "title": "Incentivize Reinvestment for Owners via Banked ICE",
      "content": "**Background**\n\nFollowing a passed governance proposal (#Qmd3TuV), we introduced Banked ICE as a new ecosystem asset distributed to delegated players to effectively guide them towards ownership, upward mobility, and ultimately being a productive member of our ecosystem. \n\nWe immediately saw the potential Banked ICE has in effectively maintaining value within our ecosystem and seeding Tournament Mode player liquidity via an attractive Banked ICE to Shine conversion rate (20% discount). Furthermore, folks who stack Banked ICE have access to a ~20% discount on minting an All Access Wearable. All in all, the Banked ICE architecture has provided upward mobility through reinvestment of earnings, immediately improved our burn-to-earn ratio, and catapulted us much closer to long-term sustainability. \n\nBanked ICE is an extremely attractive asset to anyone who is serious about re-investing within our ecosystem. It makes sense to extend this offer to all participants in our ecosystem – not just delegated players.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nDistribute Challenge Mode player-owners’ and guild owners’ daily ICE earnings as 20% Banked ICE and 80% ICE. \n\n*We currently emit ~1.2M unlocked ICE per day. This proposal would reduce our daily unlocked ICE emissions to ~960k ICE per day, improving our Burn-to-earn ratio by 1.25x.*\n\n*Additionally, the DAO would have access to another key economic lever – the Banked ICE / ICE Split for Owners – in order to adequately respond to market conditions with the objective of maintaining balance in the ICE ecosystem.*\n\n**Rationale**\n\nIf someone is planning on re-investing even just 20% of their ICE earnings (for instance buying Shine to play Tournament Mode or saving up to mint another wearable), then receiving 20% of their ICE rewards as Banked ICE is a great opportunity. \n\nBy allowing player–owners and guild owners into the Banked ICE ecosystem with 20% of their earnings, they get to buy Shine at a 20% discount and new All Access Wearables at a ~20% discount. We also avoid the scenario where these folks have to dump their ICE to ETH in order to expand their wearable collection. \n\nThe main argument against this proposition is that it may take longer to upgrade metaverse wearables from earnings because you can’t use Banked ICE to upgrade. That is why we wanted to allocate a clear majority of 80% in unlocked ICE for owners. Owners will still be able to accrue most of their earnings in unlocked ICE in order to upgrade their wearables. \n\nBy opening up Banked ICE to our whole community – delegated players, player-owners, and guild owners alike – we will welcome more growth and reinvestment within the ecosystem as a whole, which will benefit all participants.

      "content": "Currently when a player loses all of most of their chips this generally results in them being in the lowest 20-25% percentiles on the rewards ladder.\n\nHowever even 10 chips left can result in a large difference in percentile placement as losing all of your chips is unfortunately the most common individual result in poker.\n\nAs at least a fifth of players lose all or most of their chips per day this makes those Knocked Out a large cohort which doesn't fit into a percentile bracket well and therefore distorts the results.\n\nHence I propose that a category is added to the ladder, that of Knocked Out. If a player has only 300 chips or less remaining they would not be counted towards the percentile rankings at all and receive 0.01x rewards ( equal to the current reward for 95-100%). \n\n The team would be able to fine tune the threshold level for players to be considered to be KO'ed, taking into consideration the needs of the Ice poker ecosystem and player rewards / liquidity.\n\nThis should be a simple change that will reduce ICE emissions and move the Burn / Earn ratio in a positive direction.",

      "title": "Update the assigned seating logic.",
      "content": " Currently the playerbase is assigned seating without accord to the level of wearable they hold or have been delegated.\n\n This however results in an arbitrage between the potential value of a lv1 player's chips, and those of a player with a high bonus. This breaks a fundamental principle of poker; namely that in order for a game to be fair each chip should be of equal value to all players at the table.\n\n Hence the assigned seating algorithm should be updated. If a table is open which closely matches the player's percentage bonus then the player should be assigned there in order that the chip value remains close to equal on the table.\n\n This will help to prevent chip dumping as it removes the potential for arbitrage. As an example a delegated lv1 player with 3500 chips who completes their challenges would currently earn ~220 ICE. Dumping all of those chips to a max bonus 5x lv5 player would see those same chips being worth potentially ~3861 ICE, almost 18x as much.\n\n By minimising the potential for arbitrage the players will be able to enjoy their poker knowing that a key exploit has been minimised, resulting in a provably fairer environment.\n\n As this is a measure to reduce and prevent cheating the DAO should delegate future responsibility to the management team and devs in so much as deciding upon the correct table to send a player to. They should take into account the health and needs of the Ice poker ecosystem with due regard to player liquidity.\n\n By removing this exploit the burn to earn ratio should be positively impacted.",

      "title": "Proposal: Fund Player Acquisition Campaigns to Pinpoint Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Optimize the Funnel ",
      "content": "**Background**\n\nThe launch of ICE Poker Flex Tournament Mode on September 12th delivered a new, more accessible, deflationary gameplay mode. This new ICE sink allows us to linearly scale our daily ICE burn (and thus materially improve our most crucial KPI, our burn-to-earn ratio) as we increase our daily active players. While shipping additional features to improve the onboarding and gameplay experience is critical, we ultimately need to acquire new players. \n\nWe recently published the Decentral Games Marketing Strategy Overview (https://youtu.be/rmwSBczC-ZI). As a part of this strategy, we plan to run User Acquisition (UA) campaigns on several platforms (e.g. Permission, BitMedia, AdRoll). We’ve already started a small campaign with Permission. \n\nTo conduct these various paid acquisition campaigns, \n\n1. We pay for inventory on various platforms. \n2. People then click on the ads, which route them to one of our strategic ICE Poker Flex landing pages.\n3. We track the attribution using Web Events and UTM parameters and can publish the funnel data to the community.\n\nWe also expect to have some opportunities around sponsorships and newsletters as well, but we are primarily focused on the above ads platforms.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nAllocate 125,000 DAI to run strategic Player Acquisition campaigns over 4 months: November - February. \n\n*Any unused funds will rollover to continue UA efforts following this period. At least 80% of these funds will be spent on UA campaigns with ads platforms; the < 20% component would be sponsorships and newsletters, if any.*\n\n*The DG Team will publish spend amounts by platform/partner monthly along with performance overviews. Specifically, the team will share the spend and key performance metrics for each campaign.*\n\n**More Details**\n\nWe’re not coming into this with the expectation that these campaigns will be profitable in the short term or drive thousands of new users immediately. Creating a solid UA funnel takes time and requires iterating on all parts of the funnel. \n\nUltimately, our goal with these advertising campaigns is two-fold:\n\n1. To get a baseline customer acquisition cost (CAC) that we can use to benchmark our user acquisition efforts against.\n2. To push more traffic into our funnel that enables us to better test and improve our onboarding.\n\nFollowing deployment of these campaigns, we hope to have insight and data on the following: \n\n- What is our baseline Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)?\n- Which ads platforms outperform?\n- Which ads/creatives outperform? \n- What geographies and user profiles are best to target?\n- Which landing pages and onboarding flows have the least amount of drop off?\n\n125,000 DAI over 4 months (< 1% of the DG DAO’s holdings) is sufficient to get to statistical significance across various platforms. A profitable player acquisition funnel will be a very strong ecosystem lever as we will be able to drive our burn-to-earn ratio > 1 as needed. \n\n*It’s appropriate for the DG Treasury to cover these campaigns as all revenues associated with ICE Poker (wearable mints, activations, upgrades, royalties, etc) accrue to the DG Treasury.* ",

However,\n1.1 million VP on this grant is from two people that are directly gaining money from it, creating a conflict of interest. If they did not vote on their own grant, this would not be passing, as expressed by the community in the comments and “No” votes. This team has also received 5 previous DCL grants, over $120k+ worth of funds, which have not brought back any significant value to Decentraland. There should be a limit of how much money a team can continue to extract from the DCL DAO, especially if their past history of the use of previous funds have not shown to bring significant value to Decentraland. This is their third attempt at going for this 6th grant, the DCL forum discussions on the previous two attempts have many community members expressing their concerns about the DCL Reports use of previous DCL grants. Given the current analytics of the DCL Report, the DCL community overall does not see the value nor think the platform is scalable enough to have one decentralized news network, as many community members independently make content for the DCL without a grant.",

      "title": "Add Tournament Eligibility and Shine Drops to High Roller Items",
      "content": "Background:\n\nShortly after the launch of ICE Poker, DG released exclusive “High Roller” items. These items can only be claimed by upgrading an entire matching set to lvl 5 aka “Diamond Hands”, along with other requirements.\n\nThere are currently two High Roller items:\n\nICE Crown\nICE Scepter\n\nWhile High Roller items are popular aesthetically and provides exclusive perks (such as private discord channels and airdorps), the community has been asking for additional utility for a while. \n\nTypically, High Roller owners have been involved in ICE Poker for some time and have heavily invested back into the ecosystem.\n\nProposal: \n\nOne way we could add additional utility and value to these items is to make them eligible for ICE Poker Flex SNG gameplay.\n\nAlong with this, High Roller items should also get a repeating Shine drop. Some examples are listed:\n\n9 Shine per week = ~47,000 ICE worth of Shine annually\n12 Shine per week = ~62,500 ICE worth of Shine annually\n16 Shine per week = ~83,000 ICE worth of Shine annually\n20 Shine per week = ~104,000 ICE worth of Shine annually\n\nNote: I’d like to leave the exact amount and frequency of the Shine drops to the DG team’s discretion based on community feedback.\n\nI would also like to give the option to put a cap on shine drops if a High Roller has not used the item and reaches a certain threshold, the exact cap amount could be left to DG team discretion and may be altered in the future as they see fit. \n\nRationale: \n\nConsidering the amount of ICE burned in order to obtain a full level 5 set (175k ICE burned per full set), this seems like a useful utility to bring additional value to the exclusive High Roller items.\n\nThis will also incentivize those who have invested a significant amount of ICE and time into the ICE Poker ecosystem to continue to be active in Flex SNG games.\n",

This will be up to the team and the technical difficulty of such.\n\nThe price would be up to the team discretion, but should be a somewhat low k ice value.

The team can decline inappropriate names, with the same standards as Decentraland doesn’t allow certain user names.\n\nIdeally each week the table names will change. There can be a dedicated page in discord to auction the tables. The ICE paid is sent from the player wallet to a DG control account and then burned.\n\nThe auction style is to be determined by DG.\n\nFuture auctions can be made for additional ICE, such owner of the table gets to pick/design the color/theme for that table, and what Pepe wears, the proposal only focus on the table name, yet its up to DG discretion on how easy other changes can be made.",

      "content": "Introduction \nThe DG ecosystem is set to resume its growth with the introduction of new all access wearables and flex wearables collections. The anticipated growth in the ecosystem arrives at a time where ICE, and the aggregate crypto market in general, is experiencing marked volatility. To combat this volatility measures have been introduced to pair protocol revenues with USDC and add to the ICE-USDC LP as per the governance proposal: https://snapshot.org/#/decentralgames.eth/proposal/0x1c92beee7f7ff5e62d15b5034d3ea537da8a5db11976a3738bf9284fb80e3458. At present these protocol revenues include Polygon validator node rewards, secondary sales royalties and metaverse advertising revenue. \n\nProposal \nI. Allocate the ICE revenues from wearable activations and upgrades to be paired with USDC and added to the ICE-USDC LP for the remainder of 2022 Q4. This will support the ICE stabilization efforts of the governance proposal linked in the introduction. \n\nMotivation \nI. Further contributes to the ongoing ICE stabilization efforts by strengthening the ICE-USDC LP. \nII. Limits the discretionary incremental liquidity needed to strengthen ICE-USDC LP and safeguards the DG DAO's fiscal space regarding its USDC/DAI reserves. \nIII. Strengthens ICE-USDC LP as the protocol approaches > 1:1 ICE burn to mint ratio.",

      "content": "Background:\n\nMonths ago, a proposal was passed to change the hard challenge to “winning X hands”. The amount of wins needed is determined by the lowest rank wearable that a player checks in with. \n\nConsidering the current value of $ICE and player landscape, I propose to reduce the required amount of hands needed to appeal to more casual players and improve user retention. \n\nProposal: \n\nThe currently hard challenge is modeled as X hands won;\n\nRank 1 wearable: 18 hands\nRank 2 wearable: 16 hands\nRank 3 wearable: 14 hands\nRank 4 wearable: 12 hands\nRank 5 wearable : 10 hands\n\nI propose we change this to;\n\nRank 1 wearable: 12 hands\nRank 2 wearable: 11 hands\nRank 3 wearable: 10 hands\nRank 4 wearable: 9 hands\nRank 5 wearable: 8 hands\n\nI also propose to reduce the medium “2 pair” challenge to 4 (currently 5). \n\nRational:\n\n\nThis proposal welcomes in more casual poker players and improves new player and owner retention. \n\nLowering the required amount of wins needed gives an opportunity to new players and owners who have trouble finding a delegate or who may not be able to spend as much time playing, especially with a lower rank item.\n\nThis also results in grinding being more of an option to increase $ICE earning potential (leaderboard score) instead of being a requirement to complete the challenges all together. Reducing this challenge also gives players more time to play in SNG modes.\n",

      "title": "[Decentraland DAO] MetaTrekkers Metaverse Development, A Multi-disciplinary Platform to Onboard the Biggest Arts & Entertainment",
      "content": "Dear Decentral Games community,\n\nWe, MetaTrekkers, come to you with a proposal designed to strengthen our relationship and bring significant benefits to both brands.\n\nMetaTrekkers DAO proposal link: https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=52de9bf0-3816-11ed-b361-67b98a1da2c8\n\nThis proposal is to use Decentral Games voting power and benefit the whole Decentralad community. You can also read in the proposal how the grant will be used to further develop our projects and contribute value to the community. \n\nIn relation with this, allow us to remind you what we’ve been doing together in the past and the value of our collaboration:\n\n1.Venice Music concert\nThis event has been the cornerstone of our collaboration because, from the very beginning we’ve shared the tasks and effort behind onboarding the performing artists and their fanbase. With your help we’ve created an easy, yet comprehensive “flash webinar” where the first locations to be presented to all the new metaverse users were the Decentral Games venue and the MetaTrekkers club. Following this 3-day long onboarding session, we’ve seen that almost 70% of the attendees had expressed the desire to be onboarded into the Ice Poker feature, resulting in an increased number of visitors and users for Decentral Games (especially Ice Poker).\n\n2. The BeatTrekkers Series\nAs you may have noticed, the BeatTrekkers competition is taking place as we speak, with the latest DJ battle being the event with the highest number of attendees on (our) record – almost 400 unique users. This is another event where we’ve partnered and gave exclusive streaming rights to Decentral Games for the whole duration of the series, as each battle draws in more and more users. In the long term, those exclusive streaming rights translate into increased traffic, exposure and interaction for Decentral Games and MetaTrekkers as a brand.\n\n3. Future plans\nFor MetaTrekkers it’s obvious that the relationship with Decentral Games is something that can birth amazing opportunities so, we went ahead and brainstormed a few more initiatives that we think can benefit both our projects. For now, we won’t get into elaborate details, but it’s safe to say we’re developing more series of events that will be unique in the Decentraland metaverse, where we’ll be onboarding big names from related industries and giving them a platform to create attractive content exclusive to Decentral Games and MetaTrekkers community members.\n\nHere's a sneak preview of our plans to come:\n    DG will be the only venue (besides MetaTrekkers) where names like Yu-kai Chou (the godfather of gamification) and Texas Blockchain Council will host their seminars and talks\n     Together with DG, in the future we hope on creating an exclusive wearable that can transcend the virtual metaverse and offer the holders exclusive access to live features and rewards, beyond its obvious use in the metaverse\n\nWe appreciate you taking the time to read through our proposal and hope you’ll see the huge potential presented by the multidisciplinary platform we’re envisioning.\n\nThank you,\nMetaTrekkers\n",

      "title": "ETH Staking Node for the DG DAO",
      "content": "The DG DAO currently runs a profitable validator node on Polygon that contributes to a weekly ICE purchase and burn. This is a proposal to expand to an Ethereum staking node also, now that the Ethereum merge has been successfully completed.\n\n\nProposal: Give the team the discretion to choose between the following options with the amounts proposed being flexible, to get exposure to ETH staking for the DG DAO:\n\nSetup one or more ETH staking nodes using the current DG DAO treasury, by converting up to 1m out of the 4.7m DAI to ETH. Most of this DAI was acquired by converting ETH when it was trading around $3k-4k range.\nBuy an “x” amount of ETH per week, using a combination of the following: DG DAO treasury DAI, up to 50% of the Polygon validator node rewards and up to 50% of the secondary sale royalties. This ETH can be staked in a pool using either Lido or Rocket Pool. Once the staked ETH in one of these providers reaches 32 ETH, the DG DAO can withdraw those funds and run their own staking node with it.\n\nOnce the DG DAO is running an ETH staking node, it will accumulate ETH for the DAO over time. After the Shanghai upgrade is complete, which is estimated for some time in 2023, then the staked ETH and ETH rewards earned during this time will be able to be withdrawn. This will give the DAO another source of funds that can be used to purchase and burn ICE every week, the same way that the Polygon validator is being used now. Going forward from there, a % of the ETH rewards from the staking node should be converted to ICE and burned and a % should be accumulated to add more ETH staking nodes.\n\nCredit for the proposal idea to 0xCatsLover, with additions to it by 0xGabe and SzJanko.",

      "title": "ICE-USDC Liquidity Management as Delegation v2 Goes Live",
      "content": "**Background**\n\nDelegation v2 is expected to go live next week, which is estimated to reduce daily ICE emission by 45%+, effective immediately. \n\nLooking at the last week of data since ICE Poker Flex Tournament mode launched, the average daily metrics are as follows: \n\n- 2.4M ICE is emitted per day from ICE Poker Metaverse Challenge Mode and Badge Redemptions for ICE\n- 614k ICE is burned per day from All Access Wearable upgrades \n- 100k ICE is burned per day from All Access Wearable activations\n- 111k ICE is purchased and burned per day from protocol revenue\n- 178k ICE is burned per day from Shine purchases\n- 25k ICE is burned per day from Tournament wearable purchases\n\nCalculated from the metrics above, our daily burn-to-earn ratio is currently .428. Following the successful deployment of Delegation v2 and an estimated 45% reduction in daily ICE emissions, the ICE burn-to-earn ratio is expected to improve from .428 to ~.779. \n\nThis is without factoring in the growth of ICE Poker Tournament Mode. A 144% increase in Shine and tournament wearable purchases brings us to a 1:1 burn-to-earn ratio. Given that Tournament Mode just launched, we are confident that this level of growth can be achieved very soon. \n\nThe DG Treasury currently provides ~$1.57M in ICE-USDC LP, which represents ~785K USDC and ~119M ICE. Individual community members also provide liquidity to the pool (~82M ICE) and are incentivized to do so via the passed MANA incentives proposal (#QmYjihU). These rewards end October 15th. \n\nThe DG Treasury holds 23,171,140 ICE, 260,575 USDC, and an incremental 232,512 DAI from removed liquidity via passed governance proposal (#QmcvMEu). \n\nThe DG DAO has been buying and burning ICE each week using revenue from Metaverse advertising (#QmRFTXe), Polygon validator node rewards (see: #QmY62NL), and secondary sales royalties (#QmPjLhx).\n\n\n**Proposal**\n\n1. Add back 23,171,140 ICE and the corresponding amount of USDC to the pool.\n\n2. Allocate the future ICE bought back with revenue from Metaverse advertising, Polygon validator node rewards, and Secondary sale royalties to be paired with USDC and added to the ICE-USDC LP. \n\n3. After Delegation v2 is live (#Qmd3TuV), give the DG Team discretion to use the remaining USDC and DAI counted in the ‘Background’ section of this proposal to both purchase ICE and pair with ICE to add to the ICE-USDC LP. \n\n\n**Rationale**\n\n1. This immediately adds back the remaining ICE component amount of the LP that was previously removed. This will strengthen the ICE-USDC LP before individual stakers may exit the LP.\n\n2. Adding incremental liquidity to the ICE-USDC LP is more effective in maintaining DG treasury long term value and fortifying ICE liquidity than simply purchasing and burning ICE each week. \n\n3. With Delegation v2 and SNGs live and effectively reducing the daily emission of ICE, this allocation of USDC and DAI would further fortify the ICE-USDC LP by converting USDC to ICE and pairing with USDC to add to the LP.",

This would have resulted in Crown owners (who all have access to acquiring a scepter without contest) would end up with 60k VP to the Scepter owner's 10k, while requiring the same requirements to earn mechanically in the game's design.\n\nUPDATED NUMBERS:\nCrown - 30k Voting Power\nScepter - 15k Voting Power\n\nThis reduces the total amount of VP a Crown owner would receive from 60k to 45k, while boosting Scepter VP by 50%. The increase in Scepter VP also allows for future items to have some VP, while still reducing the amount, so a 3rd, 4th and 5th item could have 10k, 5k, and 2.5k (a note someone else presented to future proof the idea). \n\nDILUTION:\n\nIt should be noted this change will increase the total amount of new VP from 10,000,000 to 10,500,000.\n\nSome have brought up concerns over the dilution of Voting Power for what they perceive as no benefit to Decentral Games or existing xDG holders.\n\nThere are 1-billion xDG, currently the single source of Voting power within the DAO. 10.5-million is 1.5% of the total existing Voting power.\n\nBENEFITS:\nBy introducing people to DAO governance with an item that isn't xDG that they can't dump, this idea can only benefit existing xDG holders.\n\nEither a user receives the xDG for the item, and continues to not participate in governance, OR they get a taste for DAO-based democracy and begin to build a position of xDG so they can propose their own ideas and have their voice heard.\n\n\nPRIORITY:\nImplementation of this idea should not come before any existing Roadmap items unless it can be done without effecting anything else.

This gameplay mode burns ICE and helps to balance the overall ICE Poker economy; all else equal, the more gameplay that takes place the more ICE is burned. \n\nProposal\n\nFund out $28,750 in rewards out of the Gameplay Vest Allocation for:\n\n(1) First 50 players to claim an All Access Wearable prize will receive $200 in xDG.\n\n(2) Top 20 win % w/ > 100 tournaments played 9/12 - 10/11 get:\n1st: $1,000 in xDG\n2nd: $950 in xDG\n3rd: $900 in xDG\n4th: $850 in xDG\n5th: $800 in xDG\n6th: $750 in xDG\n7th: $700 in xDG\n8th: $650 in xDG\n9th: $600 in xDG\n10th: $550 in xDG\n11-20th: $500 in xDG\n\n(3) Top 3 badges earned 9/12 - 10/11:\n1st: $3,000 xDG\n2nd: $2,000 xDG\n3rd: $1,000 xDG\n\nRationale\n\nThese incentives will help to bootstrap player liquidity and encourage people to play. Rewards (1) and (3) specifically encourage a high volume of play; whereas, the largest bucket of rewards, (2), encourages both volume of play (100+ games) and playing well. \n\nThis proposal seeks to fund these rewards for one month in the total amount of $28,750 and doesn't seek approval for additional months at this time. \n\nThese are rewards for gameplay so it's reasonable to draw these rewards from that allocation.

      "title": "Activation fee adjustments ",
      "content": "# Introduction \nAt present, daily ICE emissions are more than four times greater than when ICE Poker was first introduced. Despite this significant increase in ICE emissions the price of wearable activations has stayed constant, apart from the conversion from DG to ICE that changed the currency but effectively kept the dollar cost unchanged at the time of implementation. \n\n# Proposal \nI. Have a one time increase in the wearable activation fee to 2700 ICE, which is an 8 percent increase from the current price of 2500 ICE. \nII. Introduce a price adjustment mechanism for the wearable activation fee. The adjustment mechanism (i) has a minimum ICE activation fee of 2700, and (ii) corrects the ICE activation fee by 20 percent of the monthly percent change in ICE emissions. For example, if the monthly percent change in ICE emissions is +10 percent, then the wearable activation fee will increase by 2 percent (0.10 × 0.20); and alternatively, if the monthly percent change in ICE emissions is -5 percent, then the wearable activation fee will decrease by 1 percent (0.05 × 0.20) if this leaves the fee above the 2700 min, or decreases to 2700 otherwise. \n\n# Motivation \nICE emissions are expected to grow as the ecosystem introduces Flex wearables and later additional metaverse wearables. The price adjustment mechanism for wearable activation fees will automatically account for new wearables within the ecosystem, whether players opt to stack wearables or not, and safeguard activation fee revenue during ecosystem downturns. Moreover, it will further support the SNG and other ICE sinks as more players find value in joining the ecosystem. \n",

      "content": "Background:\n\nDG launched aesthetic ICE Accessories in their marketplace months ago. There’s an opportunity to add utility to these accessories and High Roller items (crown & scepter) without increasing ICE emissions. (Note, High Roller items will not be limited to this utility)\n\nAdding utility helps incentivize both delegates and owners to burn more ICE through the Accessory Marketplace and further incentivize High Roller item ownership.\n\nProposal:\n\nICE Accessories offer additional chips at check-in. \n\nThere are currently two Accessory Tiers in the Marketplace:\n\n-Low Tier — 1000 unit items that cost 1,000 ICE\n-High Tier — 100 unit items that cost 10,000 ICE\n\nAn example of how this could work:\n\n-Low Tier accessories give 400 additional chips at check-in (1,000 count)\n-High Tier accessories give 1,200 additional chips at check-in (100 count)\n-High Roller accessories give 2,000 additional chips at check-in (Can only be earned by upgrading and owning a complete set)\n\n*Note: I’d like to give discretion to the DG team to adjust and balance variables such as accessory mint prices, item tiers, rules, and chip check-in bonuses, based on community feedback.*\n\n\nWe’ll also need to implement some rules to prevent abuse:\n\n-Players can only use 1 active accessory when checking in.\n-Any given accessory may be checked in only once per 24 hour competition.\n-Transferring and using the item on another address would be blocked by whatever method the DG team chooses to implement.\n\n\nRationale:\n\nThere are only 400 ICE Accessories minted to date. Creating utility beyond pure cosmetics will increase demand for ICE Accessories — which increases ICE demand and burns more ICE.\n\nAdditional utility for High Roller items also further incentivizes owners to upgrade and own a complete Diamond Hand wearable set to get these exclusive items and bonuses.\n\nThis type of ICE sink is valuable for the ICE Poker Ecosystem since this burns ICE without increasing ICE emissions and it’s something both delegates and owners would see value in obtaining.\n\nIf passed, this proposal is intended to be coupled with the previously approved “Dynamic Chip Allotment”.\n",

      "title": "Establish Pre-Set Player Yields to Control ICE Token Emissions",
      "content": "### Background\n\nPlay and Earn reward schemes generally, and ICE Pokers' specifically, are unsustainable. The protocol needs to tackle these challenges head-on. The DG team has introduced a slew of proposals to mitigate ICE emissions. Their latest, the \"ICE Bank\", is the most dramatic. While each proposal helps at the margin, they are ad hoc and reactionary. This proposal presents a framework for determining ICE emissions. If adopted, ICE Poker will be uniquely positioned in the Play and Earn segment as gameplay volatility is substantially reduced.\n\n**Link to Detailed Proposal:** https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XK8uA3w386cZqODSE_Yqa1t92_GH8oy4/view?usp=sharing\n\nA detailed proposal is provided above. The first step is recognizing that player earnings are a protocol level expense. The notion that rewards can be sustained long term through an ever-inflating token relying on a growing user base is misplaced. The DG team and community have rightfully introduced proposals to reduce ICE emissions and improve burn to earn ratios. This proposal takes the logical next step by setting emissions to a level supported by regular token burns. \n\n### Proposal Summary\n\n- Task the Decentral Games team with determining a sustainable annualized yield based on net deflationary revenue sources allocated to ICE stabilization activities\n- Adjust ICE Bonus multipliers by metaverse wearable to target an annualized yield\n- Cap ICE emissions to X% of current supply on a yearly / weekly / daily basis, to be periodically reduced based on market conditions\n- Set up an \"ICE Stabilization Fund\" to capture speculative excess if the price of ICE increases\n- Replace the ICE Bank proposal with the points contained herein for more sustainable gameplay economics\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n1. Decentral Games team to determine an ICE Stabilization Expense budget based on pro-forma revenue from non-inflationary revenue sources.\n   - Example: Suppose revenue from Activations, Secondary Sales, Advertising, and Polygon Node fees is budgeted at $20K equivalent per day or $20K * 3 months = $1.825M for Q3 2022. This is the expected burn (ICE Stabilization Expense budget in dollars) for the quarter. This will be updated regularly based on the protocol’s projections. Because upgrades are paid in ICE, they may supplement the ICE Stabilization Expense budget initially.\n2. Determine L1 → L5 yields based on ICE Stabilization Expense budget using seven-day average ICE price.\n   - Example: $20K / day @ $0.02 average ICE price = 1M ICE Emission Budget. Based on number of L1 → L5 wearables and the relative cost of each, one can back into yields for each wearable resulting, on average, in daily emission equal to the ICE Emission Budget (i.e., burn to earn of 1x).\n3. Achieve targeted yields by adjusting ICE Bonus payouts. The multiplier will adjust dynamically (say, weekly) based on the trailing seven-day average ICE price, targeted yield, and changes in Metaverse Wearable present value.\n4. Set a daily / weekly ICE Emission Cap less than or equal to the ICE Emission Budget. This prevents the protocol from hyperinflating the token if ICE trades down since the ICE Bonus multiplier from #3 will calculate an ever-increasing amount of ICE to emit to achieve desired yields.\n5. Set up an ICE Stabilization Fund wallet to receive ICE from the iceKeeper contract for the difference between actual ICE emissions and the ICE Emission Cap (perhaps best done on a weekly basis to adjust for gameplay habits).\n6. Keep ICE Stabilization Funds in USDC. Funds can subsidize yield by supplementing ICE Stabilization Expense budgets.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis proposal sets ICE emissions to a level yielding a burn to earn ratio of 1x. Yields are derived from non-inflationary revenue dedicated towards ICE Stabilization activities. This yield may increase as protocol revenue increases. An ICE Emission Cap protects the protocol from ICE hyperinflation on the downside and allows for revenue capture on the upside through the ICE Stabilization Fund. This Fund can be used to support SNG tournament prizes or subsidize yield in times of protocol revenue decline. Though a significant lift, these changes will set the protocol apart from Play and Earn peers while stabilizing gameplay.\n\nA robust discussion is welcomed considering the proposal's scope.\n\n### This Proposal Will...\n\n- Explicitly tie protocol level earnings to revenue allocated towards ICE Stabilization activities \n- Task the team with establishing yields for each wearable, which, on average, emit no more ICE than is allocated towards burn activities \n- Cap ICE emissions as determined by the protocol's ICE Stabilization budget\n- Create an \"ICE Stabilization Fund\" to allow the protocol to capture any upside in ICE appreciation \n\n\n\n\n",

Wearable owners would still be able to delegate their wearables to players using the same process as today, but the main change here will be that the rewards earned by delegated players will be stored in an “ICE Bank”.\n\nAs delegated players accrue banked ICE, they can:\n- Purchase a tournament-only wearable to start playing ICE Poker SNG (net deflationary).\n- Add Shine to an existing wearable to continue playing ICE Poker SNG (net deflationary).\n- Purchase an ICE wearable (Mobile or Metaverse wearables), transitioning them into a player-owner in the process.\n\nThere will also be the option to redeem the banked ICE balance for $ICE, but it will incur an 70% redemption penalty, meaning they will be able to withdraw 30% of the banked ICE as $ICE. This would still be subject to the 2k ICE claim limit, as per the previous proposal: https://snapshot.org/#/decentralgames.eth/proposal/0x9a71b2078eee33d9b5381f57a21de32bb2f240f8f734bd54eeb32610ab47ea6e. Specifically, you would need to earn at least 6,667 banked ICE in order to claim at least 2k ICE. \n\nTo be clear, wearable owners will still receive their regular ICE rewards, whereas delegated players will accrue a “banked ICE” balance that can be redeemed for any of the above. The amount of banked ICE that it costs to redeem each of the wearables will be finalized closer to the time of launch and will be at the discretion of the team to adjust.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe result of this change would be that in the immediate term, ICE emissions would drop by an estimated 55%, bringing us to over a 1:1 burn-to-earn ratio. And while this would reduce down over time as banked ICE is used to redeem wearables, it will still be a significant contributor to a sustainable burn-to-earn ratio. \n\nWe’d also expect this to shift the makeup of the player base over the long term to include more player-owners, thus increasing wearable upgrades, which is an important token sink.\n\nOn top of all of this, we create a zero-cost entry point to becoming an owner that’s all centered on players investing their time into the game to eventually own a part of it. This will be a key play and own element of ICE Poker that will help us grow sustainably moving forward.\n\n**Important Caveats**\n\nThe introduction of this new delegation system would result in a few recently passed governance proposals that are in our development queue to no longer be possible to implement. Voting “Yes” to this proposal is also a vote to invalidate the following proposals:\n\n- “Delegated Player Reputation Multiplier to Incentivize Governance Participation and Reduce Abuse” (https://snapshot.org/#/decentralgames.eth/proposal/0x92a8151ea53d6460ef2e753b86c01ebed1ebaad5be2bf66bdee0a559c34ee385).\n- “Fidelity rewards: Incentivize upward mobility” (https://snapshot.org/#/decentralgames.eth/proposal/0x9a920162b50f4bccff343f1a414993e476e9c754637823cde88d328a5fc1426c).\n- “Biweekly Claim Period for Players” (https://snapshot.org/#/decentralgames.eth/proposal/0x55018965c4c36be46fdff7b491024efecf111138e710286c6e95809393dcf0d7).\n\nLastly, Delegation V2 would be launched after SNGs go live.

      "content": "Background\nCurrently there are 200m ICE in circulation, from those 200m, 117m are in the liquidity pool which is 100% provided by the DAO.\nThis represents almost 60% of the circulating supply deposited into the liquidity pool.\nAs we can imagine, this situation occurred because there were certain variables within the ecosystem which required to be balanced out, and because\nwe need to create reasons for people to want to actually hold ICE instead of selling it.\n\n\nProposal\nGive the team discretion to remove liquidity from the pools for a period of 5 months.\n\nRationale\nDuring these past weeks we have been accumulating a lot of nominal amount of ICE on the LP which now even if we balance the game,\nit will convert on a really high resistance moving upwards.\n116M ICE valued at 0.015 cents are $ 1.740.000 , the same amount of nominal ICE valued at $ 0.1 cents, are $ 11.6M .\nAll of these weeks, since we are the only liquidity providers, it would be okay to say that we as a DAO have been buying back ICE all along the way.\nWith the MANA incentives looking good which then will be followed up by SnG and mobile launch, i think this is a great opportunity to remove as much\ncirculating supply as possible to make the load on ICE softer.\n\nThis way, we can take the most out of the MANA incentives and start the game dynamics once again but this time on a much better scenario and with new \nfeatures coming in for balancing our B/E ratio.\n",

This includes a reduction in the base amount of chips received in order to also see a smaller value impact from a single level 1 check in losing 3,000 chips to a stacked level 5 check in, as an example. Along with further incentivizing upgrades and stacking wearables for both delegates and player-owners.\n\nDynamic chip allotment: \n\nMinimum check in with a single level 1 wearable: 1400 chips\nFor each upgrade, +100 chips\nFor each stacked item, +400 chips \n(cumulative for multiple items/levels)\n\nThis, in combination with the hard challenge proposal that was passed, should induce a more realistic and entertaining gameplay experience while also mimicking the variety of bankrolls and buy-ins that one can typically expect while sitting at a poker table. IE a level 5 has a higher “buy-in” than a level 1.

      "title": "Use Secondary Sales Revenue to Burn ICE",
      "content": "Background\n\nICE emissions have been steadily decreasing and the burned/earned ratio has been improving. These positive changes are due to recently implemented proposals around wearable stacking, leaderboard multipliers, updating Activations to ICE ,and converting Polygon node fees to ICE. In spite of the actions the DG DAO has taken, the daily deficit remains in the 1.5 - 2M ICE range (down from a peak of ~3M ICE).\n\nThe introduction of SNG Tournaments will be a major token sink for ICE and will help greatly in reducing this deficit. That said, we're still a few weeks away from being able to go live with them. In the meantime, we want to be proactive around supporting ICE burn/earn.\n\nProposal\n\nWeekly, Convert Secondary Sales Revenue to ICE and burn it.  Continue this until SNG Tournaments are live and the deficit is < 1M ICE/day. \n\nRationale\n\nThe DG DAO is prioritizing shipping product features that make the game more fun and stabilize the price of ICE while also passing governance proposals that do the same. Like Activations, Polygon Node, and Advertising, in the short-term, it makes sense to direct revenue flows to this area as well. \n\nIn the trailing 30 days, ICE Poker NFTs have done ~800E volume on OpenSea resulting in ~39E Revenue to the DAO.  We expect secondary sales revenue to burn at least 5% of the ICE emission. ",

While the bottom 20% earns very very little, it does ensure that everyone who completes challenges receives ICE. \n\nThe net effect of these changes is that the mean multiplier goes from 0.83 to 0.75 which will immediately decrease total ICE emissions by ~10%.

      "title": "Update to Challenges",
      "content": "Background\n\nPlayers earn ICE & XP by completing challenges which are broken into types: Easy, Medium, and Hard. The Hard challenge typically takes the longest and is most luck-based (e.g. 'Get a Flush'). Each player gets one challenge of each type each day and the difficulty of the challenge is the same regardless of the level and count of wearables worn. \n\nFor completeness, here is the full list of challenges by Type: \n\nEasy earns 1 XP & 25 ICE: \n\n-- See Flop 20x\n-- See Turn 15x\n-- See River 10x\n\nMedium earns 2 XP & 100 ICE\n\n-- Win the Hand 10x\n-- Get a Pair 15x\n-- Get Two Pair 7x\n\nHard earns 3 XP & 200 ICE\n\n-- Get 3oak 3x\n-- Get a Straight 2x\n-- Get a Flush\n-- Get a Full House\n\nProposal\n\nReplace the Hard Challenges with \"Win N Hands,\" and vary the number of hands required by the level of the lowest level wearable worn:  [18, 16, 14, 12, 10] hands won for level [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] .  Also, to prevent redundancy, remove the \"Win 10 Hands\" Medium Challenge.\n\nRationale\n\nWith Assigned Seating live, we can generally move from more luck-based challenges to more skill-based challenges.  We also expect this to increase the quality of gameplay overall. We've heard complaints that the gameplay is thrown off by the fact that people 'chase' straights & flushes that they otherwise wouldn't because the ROI on that play is artificially high (to complete the challenge). \n\nWhile the 1,250 item metaverse ICE mints are paused and before tournament mode is live, upgrades are by far our biggest ICE sink; reducing the time-based component via challenge difficulty for higher level wearables further incentivizes upgrade.\n",

      "content": "Background\n\nToday, stacking wearables (checking in with multiple wearables you own or multiple wearables delegated to you) increases your earnings via the following multipliers: [2, 3, 4, 5] wearables --> [1.2x, 1.4x, 1.6x, 1.8x]. The wearable bonuses also sum (e.g. stacking 2 wearables with 30% bonus earns 1.2*(1 + 2(0.3)) = 1.92x). However, regardless of the number of wearables worn, the NFT owner earns [1, 2, 3] XP for completing [Easy, Medium, Hard] challenges. \n\nProposal\n\nInstead of [1, 2, 3] XP for completing [Easy, Medium, Hard] challenges, apportion XP as [N, 2N, 3N] XP, where 'N' is the number of wearables stacked.\n\nRationale\n\nThis will further incentivize stacking, which is good for the reasons outlined in the recently passed Proposal #QmNQrnu. This would also make the scenario that someone wishes to burn ICE upgrading but doesn't have sufficient XP less likely on the margin, resulting in more upgrades (and more ICE burned). ",

      "title": "Wearables buy-back",
      "content": "Background\n\nThe problem that DG faces is a short-term lack of confidence and, consequently, a lack of demand for ICE. Within an economy, the confidence that agents have in their currency is important so that it can remain stable.\nAs a result of the incident in which exploiters were able to claim ICE in large quantities and later sell on the market, a price run began, which eroded trust and affected the behavior of agents within the ecosystem. To avoid this continuing any further, we need to act ASAP.\nAt the time ICE Spartan minting was done (last minting in ETH), $ICE was 0.108 USD, $DG was 0.308 USD (from Coingecko) and average price for wearables sold on OpenSea was 1.87 $ETH. We've seen significant price drops all throughout DG's economy.\nWe've been discussing many $ICE sinks in the last weeks (ICE activation fee for NFT's was enabled yesterday). To encourage demand for ICE, it is necessary to provide it with greater utility.\nIn the short term, the development of tournaments with prizes, the income from paid advertising in $ICE and the launch of ICE poker's mobile version represent an improvement in demand which, could manage to change the current price trend.\nAll of them take weeks, or maybe months for the team to develop and send to production. Even with an enormous effort from them, assigned seating is not fully working.\nConsidering these limitations, the DG treasury can take action withdrawing wearables from circulation through buybacks to limit further emission of $ICE. These NFTs can be used in many future scenarios such as wearable scarcity (resell at a greater price), prizes for tournaments, marketing and more, to be decided by the DAO when the time comes.\n\nProposal\n\nThe DG treasury shall use the money from ICE Spartan mint (1,250 wearables sold at 1.5 $ETH each = 1,875 $ETH = 5.6MM USD @ 3k per $ETH) to repurchase wearables from secondary market (OpenSea), at a maximum price of 0.90 $ETH each (40% discount relative to mint price, for a level 1 wearable, according to the average daily $ICE issuance each wearable has), prioritizing the cheapest available. \n\nMaximum price to pay: \n\nFor level 1 wearables that amount would be 0.90 ETH x 1= 0.90 $ETH\nFor level 2 wearables that amount would be 0.90 ETH x 1.1= 0.99 $ETH (assuming an average level 2 wearable could issue a 10% more $ICE than a level 1 wearable)\nFor level 3 wearables that amount would be 0.90 ETH x 1.2= 1.08 $ETH (assuming an average level 3 wearable could issue a 20% more $ICE than a level 1 wearable)\nFor level 4 wearables that amount would be 0.90 ETH x 1.3= 1.17 $ETH (assuming an average level 4 wearable could issue a 30% more $ICE than a level 1 wearable)\nFor level 5 wearables that amount would be 0.90 ETH x 1.4= 1.26 $ETH (assuming an average level 5 wearable could issue a 10% more $ICE than a level 1 wearable)\n\nThe timing, and quantity of NFTs of each purchase is at the discretion of the DG developers team.\nThese wearables could later be used as tournaments rewards, sold in our future native marketplace in $ICE, or they could also be burned and permanently taken out of circulation (TBD by the DAO using data on average purchase price, number of wearables held by the Treasury, etc).\nThe DAO can also vote in the future what to do with the profit obtained from these repurchases in case they are resold on the secondary market for a profit (that is, for example, if 1 wearable was bought at 0.6 $ETH and then resold at 1 $ETH). It could be used to provide liquidity in the USDC/ICE pair, strengthen treasury, marketing campaigns, etc.\n\nRationale\n\nWithdraw NFTs from circulation momentarily to improve overall game performance and allow us to finish developing assigned seating and get rid of cheaters, in addition to reducing the daily issuance of $ICE until there are working sinks (that we've mentioned on the “Background” of this proposal).\nIt will work as a company buying-back stocks from the secondary market. With a buyback, a company can increase earnings per share (in this case for each NFT), all else equal. \nThe same earnings pie (in this case daily $ICE issuance) cut into fewer slices is worth a greater share of the earnings per user.\nBy reducing share count (or NFTs available), buybacks increase the stock's potential upside for shareholders who want to remain owners.\n",

      "title": "Fidelity rewards: Incentivize upward mobility ",
      "content": "Background: \n\nAn ecosystem can best thrive when its players and investors can trust the project and enjoy the game.  Unfortunately we have players in the system that have no interest in supporting the growth of the project. Those who prefer to cash out their daily rewards have had a direct impact on the project and its investors. It’s important we take the time to recognize and reward those who have done the opposite and contributed their efforts towards upward mobility. \n\n\n\nProposal:\nFirst, Incentivize owners who engage more with the ecosystem by creating a new multiplier on the daily ice rewards calculations after the initial split between delegate and delegator (A wearable owner must not be held to players actions)\n\n\nWith the formula below, each user will have their own metric, that metric will build up a leaderboard similar to the chips leaderboard grouped by percentages.\n\n\n*It is necessary however to trust and give discretion to the team to adjust any variable as needed for a period of at least 3 months in the case that a rebalance is needed. This formula can be revisited in the future to include incentives for xDG holding as well.\n\n\nICE Balance + ICE spent on the ecosystem * 1.25 + wearables held * 15000\n......................................................................................................................................\n                                             ICE earned\n\n\n(Re-explanation do to styling,  formula is: (ICE balance + ICE spent on the ecosystem * 1.25 + wearables held * 15000) Divided by ICE earned\n\nThe leaderboard multipliers would look like this:\n>0-5%    -  x1.1\n>5-10%   -  x1.1\n>10-15%  -  x1.05\n>15-20%  -  x1.05\n>20-25%  -  x1\n>25-30%  -  x1\n>30-35%  -  x0.95\n>35-40%  -  x0.95\n>40-45%  -  x0.90\n>45-50%  -  x0.90\n>50-55%  -  x0.90\n>55-60%  -  x0.90\n>60-65%  -  x0.85\n>65-70%  -  x0.85\n>70-75%  -  x0.85\n>75-80%  -  x0.85\n>80-85%  -  x0.80\n>85-90%  -  x0.80\n>90-95%  -  x0.75\n>95-100%  -  x0.7\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, encourage delegates to not only hold ice but also push towards ownership by applying a separate multiplier on balance claimed for a delegated player. \n\nFor example:\nPlayer A earns 200 ice/day- (claims after 1 day)  = .25x multiplier on balance = 50 ice/day\nPlayer B earns 200 ice/day - (claims after 7 days) =  .50x multiplier on balance = 100 ice/day\nPlayer C earns 200 ice/day - (claims after 14 days) =  .75x multiplier on balance = 150 ice/day\nPlayer D earns 200 ice /day - (claims after 30 days) = 1x multiplier on balance = 200 ice/day\nPlayer E earns 200 ice /day - (claims after 50 days) = 1.05x multiplier on balance = 210 ice/day\n\nDelegates would then be highly incentivized to push towards ownership under the expectation that consistent play for 1-3 months would have earned a player enough to invest in their own wearable. \n\nRationale:\n\nWhile a player who comes in and holds his ICE should have higher rewards than one who cashes out on a daily basis, a user invested into the project should also be rewarded higher. This enables upwards mobility, a vision in place since day 1 in which a delegated player can become a wearable owner and then ultimately a guild owner.\n\n\nEven though the team has been hard at work banning a lot of the chip dumping groups, this will further disincentivize these chip dumping groups from being able to abuse the system to just cash out. Ice being held for longer periods can also give the team time to hold these bad actors accountable for their actions. \n\n>The heart of our ice poker economy is out of rhythm and a shock back into a normal rhythm as a collective effort from investors, players, owners and DG Team members\nwould restore function and sustainable growth as quickly as possible.\n",

      "title": "Buy Time (Support ICE Price)",
      "content": "Background\n\nIce Poker tokenomics is on a good way to stabilizing. Lots of ice sinks such as ice marketplace, tournaments, and mobile mints are in development. But with the current prices and the ice poker mobile being at least 6 weeks away, there is much panic, and we are bleeding players/investors and losing the trust of our community.\n\nProposal\n\nBuyback ICE with the treasury money whenever ICE goes below 0.05 and save it to the treasury.\nWhen we achieve more burn than the minted ice, the team will have the discretion to sell half of the ICE pair it with the remaining half, and add to the ice-usdc liquidity pool. In the future with changes in the dynamics always there can be another proposal suggesting something else with the bought-back ICE.\nThe team will also have the discretion to choose which funds to use (DAI-ETH etc.)\n\nRationale\n\nOur most valuable asset is our community. Our community is not just players and owners. There are hundreds of people who are highly contributing to the governance of this ecosystem. They know the past and all the struggles the team is going through. We don’t want to lose our community and this community cannot be earned back easily. You can increase player count easily but not a community like this. The team is developing ice sinks but to not lose people we must support ice price.\n\nWith the way we buy ice back and save it for future use, if the team can deliver the promised ice sinks, the treasury will not lose any money. If the team can’t deliver, the treasury will lose money. This will show confidence to everyone. DAO trusting the team to deliver and putting treasury money for it.\n\nThis buyback is a shot of adrenaline in its simplest way to describe. We are buying time for the team to develop. Treasury is very healthy right now and easily can handle this kind of buyback.\n\nEvery day approx. 3.5M ICE is being minted and 600k ICE is being burnt. This will result in 2.9M ICE sell pressure at maximum sell. Which is equal to 145k USD with the current prices. Probably people won’t sell at the current pace when they know 0.05 is the lowest point that ICE can be, and it will probably go higher in the future. But even if they sell all the ice being minted daily, 45 days (approximate time for ice poker mobile) will result in 6.5m USD will be used from treasury which will end up in the liquidity pool after ICE buy-sell stabilize over 0. Hopefully, it take lesser than 45 days to implement new sinks + ice poker mobile and lesser people will sell ICE with the new program so a lot less treasury money will be used to buyback.\n\nIf we don't start a buyback program 45 days later ICE might be below 0.015 with the sell pressure exampled in the paragraph above. If we dont lose all of our players till that time (no player-no mint-no sell).\n\nRight now people are not doing upgrades because they think if they upgrade now, it would be an expensive upgrade, with the expectation that ice price will keep dropping with the current economics. If people know that we are at the very bottom of ice price, they might start buying ice and upgrading their wearables at the cheapest price they might have. This will result in less money from the treasury used and more ice being burnt.\n\nOpensea nft floor price is too low when compared a while ago. There is 2 reasons for it. One, ice price drops so ROI drops. But also confidence dropped a lot, people don't accept the ROI of two months ago and now they expect much better ROI because people don't trust the longevity of the project. If people believe that ICE price won't go any lower and add confidence to it, we should see an increase in fp which will follow with more confidence.\n\nWe can do all those things only using approximately 10% of the treasury money temporarily.",

      "title": "Update Multiple Wearables ICE Rewards Bonus",
      "content": "Background\n\nToday, an ICE Poker player playing with more than 1 wearable equipped receives a variable multiple wearables bonus:\n\n2 wearables: 1.1x\n3 wearables: 1.2x\n4 wearables: 1.3x\n5 wearables: 1.4x\n\nThe system was designed as such to incentivize player liquidity, as each ICE Poker NFT owner who holds more than 1 wearable is incentivized to play with one, and delegate the remaining wearables one per player.\n\nProposal\n\nUpdate the ICE Poker multiple wearables ICE rewards bonus to:\n\n2 wearables: 1.2x\n3 wearables: 1.4x\n4 wearables: 1.6x\n5 wearables: 1.8x\n\nRationale\n\nBy further incentivizing ICE Poker player-owners (players who play with the wearables they own) to stack wearables, overall ICE emission will be reduced, improving the overall burn-to-earn ratio. \n\nIn the ‘Examples’ section below, we see why someone would want to stack instead of delegating them out, particularly if they're a good player. While the stacking player earns more, the total emission actually decreases as the delegated player component of the earnings is removed from the equation. Consider playing 1 and delegating out 4 level 5 wearables with +40% bonus… The total emission is 7x = 5 x 1.4x, but the owner of the wearables is only earning 4.31x. \n\nExamples\n\nLevel 5s: \n\nPlay with 2 L5s: 1.2x * (1 + 0.4 + 0.4) = 2.16x\nPlay 1, delegate the other: 1.4x + 0.52 * 1.4x = 2.13x\n\nPlay with 3 L5s: 1.4x * (1 + 3(0.4)) = 3.08x\nPlay 1, delegate 2: 1.4x + 2 * ( 0.52 * 1.4x) = 2.86x\n\nPlay with 4 L5s: 1.6x * (1 + 4(0.4)) = 4.16x\nPlay 1, delegate 3: 1.4x + 3 * ( 0.52 * 1.4x) = 3.58x\n\nPlay with 5 L5s: 1.8x * (1 + 5(0.4)) = 5.6x\nPlay 1, delegate 4: 1.4x + 4 * ( 0.52 * 1.4x) = 4.31x\n\nLevel 3s: \n\nPlay with 2 L3s: 1.2x * (1 + 0.2 + 0.2) = 1.68x\nPlay 1, delegate the other: 1.2x + 0.48 * 1.2x = 1.78x\n\nPlay with 3 L3s: 1.4x * (1 + 3(0.2)) = 2.24x\nPlay 1, delegate 2: 1.2x + 2 * ( 0.48 * 1.2x) = 2.35x\n\nPlay with 4 L3s: 1.6x * (1 + 4(0.2)) = 2.88x\nPlay 1, delegate 3: 1.2x + 3 * ( 0.48 * 1.2x) = 2.93x\n\nPlay with 5 L3s: 1.8x * (1 + 5(0.2)) = 3.6x\nPlay 1, delegate 4: 1.2x + 4 * ( 0.48 * 1.2x) = 3.5x\n\nLevel 1s\n\nPlay with 2 L1s: 1.2x * (1 + 0.05 + 0.05) = 1.32x\nPlay 1, delegate the other: 1.05x + 0.4 * 1.05x = 1.47x\n\nPlay with 3 L1s: 1.4x * (1 + 3(0.05)) = 1.61x\nPlay 1, delegate 2: 1.05x + 2 * ( 0.4 * 1.05x) = 1.89x\n\nPlay with 4 L1s: 1.6x * (1 + 4(0.05)) = 1.92x\nPlay 1, delegate 3: 1.05x + 3 * ( 0.4 * 1.05x) = 2.31x\n\nPlay with 5 L1s: 1.8x * (1 + 5(0.05)) = 2.25x\nPlay 1, delegate 4: 1.05x + 4 * ( 0.4 * 1.05x) = 2.73x",

I realized I should have made it an approval voting.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nIt should be no surprise to anyone why ICE NFTs and ICE token prices have been going down lately. If it is for you then I'll try and summarize this quickly:\n\nPlayers earn ICE tokens from gameplay > ICE token inflated > players sell ICE token > ICE token prices down > to stabilize ICE token price, the DAO mint new wearable > get ETH which gets converted to USDC > helps stabilize ICE token price\n\nThis is obviously not sustainable.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nSolutions:\n1. Reduce ICE tokens that can be won from gameplay\n\n2. DAO needs to increase ICE burn naturally - that's it, by increasing ICE required for upgrading wearables significantly (I'm talking by 2-3x).\n\n3. To promote people to want to upgrade (thus, burning more ICE tokens), the DAO needs to adjust the ICE wearables % bonus to make level 1/2 to earn much less than say level 3/4/5. For example, a level 1 wearable might earn 50 ICE while level 3 might earn 150 ICE and level 5 might earn 350 ICE. In contrast to the current rate at which a level 1 wearable can easily start earning 150+ ICE a day.\n\n4. To implement 3 solutions all at once.\n\nOf course, some of the solutions will need to be discussed further in more detail.\n\nI’m also aware these solutions will impact the ICE wearables price negatively in the short term, but over the longer term, it will help keep ICE poker alive.\n\nThe main value of ICE poker should be for people to have fun. Once that value is realized, the DAO will not need to help push ICE token prices. Just like how skin in games is essentially worth nothing but people still pay for them. That, I think, should be our aim as a DAO.\n",

      "title": "Implement new Discord roles to represent $xDG holding size categories",
      "content": "Background:\n\nThe Decentral Games discord restricts access to partake in discussions in the #governance channel. Today, that threshold is 100 $xDG which at the time of writing is approximately $29 USD.\n\nThis low barrier to participate in governance discussions supports the spirit of the DAO. It also aligns with a previous proposal created Feb 9 2022 titled \"Incentivize ICE Poker Guild Owners and Players to Participate in Decentral Games Governance\" which passed with over 96% Yes votes.\n\nThe #governance channel is incredibly valuable to discussing proposals and has a lot of voices due to the low barrier of entry. Some voices are louder than others and the channel is lightly moderated. This leads to lack of perspective about each person's views, suggestions, claims, and most importantly, financial interests.\n\nProposal:\n\n- Create 4 to 5 new roles representing ranges of $xDG holdings verified by the existing or similar verification bot.\n\n- At the DG team's discretion, the role may be either colored or not colored. At minimum, a user shall be able to click on another user's name to see their $xDG holdings role.\n\nRationale:\n\nDuring discussion, it is difficult or impossible to know if someone is heavily invested in $DG/$xDG, $ICE, wearables or some combination.\n\nSince the barrier to chat is so low, perspective of each member's $xDG holdings should be visible at least in broad categories. A member with 100 $xDG and 500,000 $ICE could heavily campaign for a proposal favoring $ICE and vice versa. Without perspective, it is easy to make misinformed decisions that could lead the DAO in a dangerous direction. The loudest members, with little holdings, may be heavily influential without even the least bit of disclosure.",

      "title": "Pay for Upgrade from Public to Private Polygon RPC (Alchemy)",
      "content": "Background\n\nUntil now, we’ve used https://polygon-rpc.com as our Polygon RPC. It's a free and public RPC provider for making calls to Polygon to retrieve data and submit transactions. While it gets the job done most of the time, it lacks support during node outages and other general slowdowns. Moreover, data returned can be a few blocks behind depending on which node we are routed to. \n\nIt became clear that at our current scale we need a private RPC provider with a dedicated channel that we can work with directly as issues arise and very low downtime. The Polygon Team recommended Alchemy, which has a great reputation and is used by other companies like OpenSea and Fortmatic at scale.\n\nWe have moved to Alchemy now, and we are seeing a decrease in latency for our Web3 calls and decreased downtime. We also expect this to provide a much more reliable way of querying blockchain data as their nodes are more up to date block-wise than the public RPC. The details and terms of service for our agreement can be found in the ‘Alchemy Offering’ section after the ‘Rationale’ section. The payment terms are one year paid upfront for $126,000, renewing annually. \n\nProposal\n\nDG DAO treasury covers the cost of moving to the Alchemy Platform with Gold service level and Alchemy VIP Support out of the DAI Treasury. \n\nRationale\n\nThe deal with Alchemy is done and a ‘No’ vote would result in the DG Team covering the expense out of project runway as we’ve done with other expenses. There is precedent for the DG DAO covering expenses related to operations core to ICE Poker: The DAO covers wearable submission MANA costs out of the DAO per the 11/10/2021 proposal ‘DG DAO Funding ICE Wearable Submissions’ (IPFS #Qme1xWn). \n\nLike wearable submissions, having a best-in-class RPC is needed for the growth and sustainability of the core business, ICE Poker. The project runway comes exclusively from selling vested $DG tokens to investors as all project revenue accrues to the DAO; whereas, funding from the DAO would come from the DAI Treasury. Over time, shifting expenses toward the DAO also decreases emission (inflation rate) on the $DG token. \n\nAlchemy Offering\n\nAlchemy Platform \n● Alchemy Testnet APIs \n● Alchemy Supernode for Mainnet \n● Alchemy Notify \n● Alchemy Monitor \n● Alchemy Build \n● Enhanced APIs and Websockets \n● Custom Rate Limits \n● Dashboard access (10 user licenses included) \n\nAlchemy VIP Support \n● Gold included \n○ Email support \n○ Real-time chat (Telegram) \n○ Direct access to core engineers, product and executive team \n○ Unlimited support tickets \n○ Dedicated account manager \n",

      "content": "Background\n\nI am the founder of RebellionBase.com which is a new project that shares a lot of similarities to Decentral Games in that the project is focused around minting passive income NFTs on the polygon network with its own currency. By allowing projects like Rebellion to partner with DG it could add additional value for wearable holders and be another source of deflationary pressure via ICE burning.\n\nDG wearable holders are a valuable audience. Allowing projects to offer free value to wearable holders functions as an advertising mechanism for new projects & be a source of revenue for DG itself.\n\nProposal\n\n(1) Build a tool that allows other projects on the polygon network (vetted by the DG team) to airdrop tokens to DG wearable holders.\n\n(2) Charge ICE to these projects in exchange for this advertising opportunity (putting additional deflationary pressure on ICE to raise its value).\n\nTo prevent spam projects from advertising the following requirements would be necessary to participate in the program:\n\nA) A minimum value of a $10 airdrop available for each wearable holder\nB) Vetting done by the DG team to ensure the legitimacy of each project\nC) Minimum of $20,000 worth of liquidity on the airdropped token / asset\n\nRationale\n\nDG wearable holders will be able to receive additional income as a reward for holding wearables. ICE will receive an additional burn mechanism increasing demand which helps the long term sustainability of ICE’s price.\n\nThis fills a needed gap in the DG ecosystem that was created when advertisements within the metaverse were approved. This allows projects to get their product in front of DG wearable owners instead of only delegates. Wearable owners are a much more valuable audience for NFT projects which allows DG to command higher rates.\n\nThis gives value to DG wearable holders in terms of extra money for claiming airdrops, ICE burning mechanisms, and finding new projects outside of the DG ecosystem such as RebellionBase.com",

As a result, they do not have any immediate sense of upward mobility and they are easily able to switch to a new wallet in the event their address is banned, and start earning 100% rewards immediately again. \n\n**Proposal**\n\nEstablish a new delegated player reputation multiplier that starts at .5x for all new delegated addresses, increases by .05x for each day the delegated player checks in while hodling 100 xDG in their wallet, and ultimately reaches a max of 1x. \n\nFor all existing delegated players, allow them to start at 1x if they stake the 100 xDG by a certain date – this new logic would then only apply to new delegated player addresses. However, if existing delegated players don't stake the 100 xDG by that certain date, then they will need to start at .5x like everyone else. \n\nFor example, if a player receives delegation on day 1 and then accumulates xDG by day 3, then their delegated player multiplier per day would be: \n\nDay 1 - .5x \nDay 2 - .5x \nDay 3 - .55x\nDay 4 - .6x\nDay 5 - .65x \nDay 6 - .7x\nDay 7 - .75x\nDay 8 - .8x \nDay 9 - .85x\nDay 10 - .9x\nDay 11 - .95x\nDay 12 - 1x \n\nBy the 10th day of checking in while hodling 100 xDG in their wallet, they would achieve the full 1x ICE rewards. \n\nIt's important to note that this only affects the delegated player's earnings. The wearable owner's earnings is unaffected by this new proposed logic.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nIt’s essential to incentivize delegated players to maintain and build up a reputation on their respective accounts. A time-weighted xDG multiplier further disincentivizes cheating and abuse as delegated players’ earnings would be slashed in half if they are banned and need to create a new account. \n\nAlthough we will deploy assigned seating to production very soon to cut down on most abuse vectors, it's important to establish additional incentive models to further assist in these anti-abuse efforts and incentivize good behavior in the ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, it's valuable long-term for the ecosystem to have delegated players participate in and collectively represent a sizeable vote in Decentral Games governance.

      "title": "Focus Decentral Games Development and Branding Entirely on Play & Earn, End Crypto Gameplay & Licensing of Crypto Games",
      "content": "**Background**\n\nIn January, we paused crypto-gameplay in Tominoya and Chateau Satoshi. At the time, crypto gameplay accounted for 1.3% ($200k) of the DG Treasury’s total January revenue ($15.3M) and required significant support from the DG support team to frequently refund players for Polygon transaction delays and reverts. (See ‘Additional Details’ section below for an overview of the Polygon issues.)\n\nSince launching ICE Poker last October, it has become clear that its product-market fit, daily active engagement, level of industry-leading innovation, and the future growth potential dwarfs that of our prior crypto games – so we’ve focused all development and support efforts there. Chateau Satoshi has already been converted into an ICE Poker venue, and we also stopped providing support for crypto-gameplay in partner venues The Flamingos and The Aquarium in Vegas City. \n\nSince the launch of ICE Poker, our discord community has increased from 8k to 57k users and our daily active player count has increased from 1k to 10k. At any time of day, you can hop into one of our ICE Poker venues and join 1,200 - 1,500 other concurrent players in the metaverse. ICE Poker accounts for 4 of the top 6 most visited venues in Decentraland, the leading Open Metaverse platform. We’ve found great product-market fit in the metaverse, and we’re coming soon to mobile where our value proposition will stack up incredibly well against freemium-model poker games (e.g. Zynga) with millions of players.\n\nDecentral Games does not offer, nor provide any support for, crypto gameplay. Our core product offering is ICE Poker, a free-to-play (no buy-in required) and played with non-transferrable CHIPs which have no monetary value. \n\n**Proposal**\n\nFocus development and branding of Decentral Games entirely on Play & Earn (ICE Poker - Metaverse and Mobile) to onboard the next 1M users to Web3/The Open Metaverse, and solidify Decentral Games as a household brand and pioneer in the space.\n\nOfficially and permanently shut down the operational support and licensing of blackjack, roulette with crypto-gameplay.\n\n\n**Rationale**\n\nDecentral Games has become an industry leader as the first community-governed, play & earn ecosystem and the first play & earn game live in the open metaverse. With crypto-gameplay shut down and ICE Poker interest and adoption growing exponentially, we have an opportunity to officially allocate our branding and development efforts entirely on the offering that has achieved the best product-market fit, daily active engagement, level of industry-leading innovation, and the future growth potential. This undivided focus will position Decentral Games for maximum growth and community engagement in 2022 and beyond. \n\nContinuing to provide operational support and development resources for crypto gameplay does not make economic sense given the amount of time and funds required to do so. Furthermore, even with ICE wagers in blackjack and roulette shut down, we can still deliver additional ICE utility and burning with arcade and tournament style ICE Poker gameplay that will positively contribute to the ICE burn-to-earn ratio. \n\n**Additional Details**\n\nPolygon Issues:\n\nIncreasing Polygon Transaction costs: As of December, we were paying the majority of house profits to cover gas fees as average transaction costs increased ~100x YoY. This is before considering the $DG-mined component, and the games were unprofitable taking [house profits] vs. [Matic costs + $DG costs]. \n\nPolygon Network unreliability: RPC downtime and high unpredictability in gas price led to an unacceptable number of gameplay transactions getting stuck in the mempool for extended periods of time or even dropped. This results in frustrating gameplay with long lags between hands/spins, but it was also resulting in transactions getting stuck on the payout; this meant we were manually issuing 50 - 100 refund transactions / day. \n\nWe expect the Polygon issues to get worse rather than better as network adoption increases. In order to profitably support these games, one would need an off-chain solution involving taking custody of funds (something we’ve never done), and it doesn’t make sense for us to invest in this area. Firstly, there are significant regulatory and licensing concerns with this approach; secondly, our development focus should remain on ICE Poker where we’ve found better product-market fit.\n\nICE Poker gameplay does not require a Polygon transaction submission and confirmation for each hand (as CHIPs are off-chain). ICE Poker only requires Polygon for wearable ownership and end-of-day payouts, which is much more cost-efficient and unaffected by spikes in gas or minor delays in data retrieval.\n",

      "title": "Partnership with Mutant Cartel",
      "content": "Background\n\nThe Mutant Cartel is a community of more than 2,400 Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) NFT holders with over 800 verified community members. The MAYC floor is ~15 ETH at the time of writing, and their community has produced a number of really impressive pieces of art, literature, and music since inception. \n\nDecentral Games also recently hosted Mutant Cartel for the reveal of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) mega mutant last month, and Decentral Games ties to the BAYC community because (1) We continue to host the BAYC Riverboat on Decentral Games land and (2) We have ICE Poker guild owners that also own BAYC or MAYC assets. \n\nProposal\n\n(1) Do a single-item 500-count set in partnership with Mutant Cartel, priced at ~25% discount to the OpenSea floor (e.g. 1.5 ETH at time of writing), with whitelist addresses provided by Mutant Cartel.\n\n(2) 100% of ETH proceeds go to the DG DAO and will be converted to USDC and paired with $ICE to add liquidity to the $ICE-USDC pool. (For clarity, secondary sale proceeds go to the DG DAO as well.)\n\nRationale\n\nMutant Cartel is exited for this partnership to provide them with branded play & earn wearables with metaverse utility, and their community would be getting a 25% discount from the secondary market floor. We should be excited to welcome in hundreds of members of this thriving NFT community to ICE Poker because they're great candidates become players and guild owners. \n\nThe proceeds from this mint will benefit the entire existing ICE Poker community of players and guilds by adding 750 ETH worth of USDC to the $ICE-USDC liquidity pool, further backing $ICE payouts to all players. At time of writing, this would be nearly $4M in liquidity, counting the $ICE component. \n\nLastly, this would be a smaller 500-item mint outside of our two regular 1,250 item mints per month, half in ETH and half in $ICE. It wouldn't impact the schedule of our regular mints. ",

      "title": "Whitelist Logic for the Next ETH Mint",
      "content": "Background\n\nWe've alternated between mints in ICE and mints in ETH and expect to continue to do so. We've also experimented with a few different whitelist logics for each (including minting without a whitelist). \n\nThe last ETH mint, done without a whitelist at 1.5 ETH while the OpenSea floor was ~2 ETH, sold out in under 1 minute. Today, the OpenSea floor remains ~2 ETH.\n\nProposal\n\nFor the next ETH mint, whitelist addresses that qualify for premium guild tools (hold at least 1,000 xDG per wearable). This would be a check at time of mint (no \"snapshot\"). If the items don't sell out during the whitelist period, the items would open for sale to everyone.\n\nRationale\n\nFor ETH mints we will target pricing at 70 - 80% of the OpenSea floor.  Likely 1.5 ETH again. Given our experience on the last mint, it doesn't make sense to offer a greater discount, and there's significant NFT liquidity on OpenSea for anyone to enter at any time with > 10K items in the collection.\n\nICE mints will be one avenue to assist players on their journey of upward-mobility to assist the transition from delegated player to player owner. ETH mints are a way to raise revenue for the DAO, and there have been a few recent proposals around how these funds should be used. As we price at a discount to the secondary market floor on ETH mints, the question should be: To whom are we returning that value? It's sensible to make that value first available to those invested in the ecosystem by holding at least one wearable and the requisite xDG to qualify for premium guild tools.",

      "title": "Updated Proposal: Incentivising long-term xDG holding",
      "content": "Background\n\nThe DG ecosystem is growing exponentially with 183k MAU (up from just 24k in Oct, 79k in Nov, and 127k in Dec), ICE Poker is the #1 P2E game by monthly revenue, and the DG Treasury has $58m in it’s treasury, implying ~$230m of annualized revenue.  Despite these strong operational and financial gains for the business over the last few months, $DG’s market cap is 25% lower than where it was in November, and flat to where it was in December.  $DG is considerably undervalued, with a market cap of just $124m.    Most of the assets in the ecosystem are highly correlated to broader crypto markets; this has been the impetus in hedging the treasury balance from a market downturn by beginning to move mint proceeds into DAI and USDC.   As macro headwinds will likely continue to weigh on crypto markets in the near-term, it is also important to reduce the correlation of $DG to broader crypto market movements.  Instead, we should aim to increase $DG's correlation to the operational and financial success of the DG ecosystem.  \n\nProposal\n\nUse mint proceeds from every other ETH mint to purchase DG and put into governance pool so xDG appreciates vs DG.    Assuming 1 ICE mint per month, and 1 ETH mint per month, this would imply mint proceeds from 6 ETH mints per year would be used to purchase DG and put in governance pool, and mint proceeds from the other 6 ETH mints per year would be up to the discretion of the team.  \n\nRationale\n\n(1)\tIncentivise long-term holding of xDG.  \n(2)\tAlign xDG tokenholders to the financial success of the business \n(3)\tIncrease correlation of DG’s token price to the success of mints\n\nThis would increase the yield earned by holding xDG,  align xDG tokenholders with the success of the business, and increase upward price pressure on DG.  \n",

      "content": "Background\n\nPer Proposals #QmYpfjx & #QmeYxQK, ETH proceeds from the previous three drops have been used to establish initial stable coin reserves, swap for DG, and add to ETH-DG, MATIC-DG, & ICE-USDC LP positions. \n\nToday, we have ~4.6M DAI in stable coin reserves, ~$7.5M total across the ETH-DG & MATIC-DG LP Pairs, ~$7.2M in ICE-USDC LP, and ~$14.7M in DG in the 'DG Treasury.'\n\nProposal\n\nFor the next drop priced in ETH:\n\n(1) Add ~$2M to ICE-USDC LP; to do this, convert $1M ETH to 1M USDC and pair with ICE. \n(2) Add remainder to stable coin reserves\n\nNote: Whether the next mint is in ETH has not been announced yet, so this would simply apply to the next mint priced in ETH. \n\nRationale\n\n(1) Is DAU increases, have substantial USDC LP for ICE is a differentiating factor that stabilizes the ICE ecosystem. \n\n(2) Most of the assets in the DAO (e.g. Matic, LAND) are highly-correlated with ETH and the broader crypto market. It makes sense to have a large hedge against a market down turn. Today, we have ~4.6M DAI out of ~$57M in the Treasury, which is a relatively small percentage of the DAO's assets. It's worth noting that the last conversion of > $4M in ETH to DAI at 1 ETH = $3,200 is looking good in retrospect. \n\nNote: If the vote is 'NO', the DAO would hold onto the ETH until another proposal were passed outlining the use of some/all of the funds.",

We haven't officially set aside wearables from mints for giveaways, prizes, or marketing.\n\nProposal\n\nMint 3 Level 1 items of each item into the DG DAO (15 items per set).\n\nWe will allocate 3 items go to the top 3 players each month; 6 items go to the top guilds: 3 go to the top 3 Chad Guilds, 2 go to the top 2 Ape Guilds, and 1 goes to the top Fren Guild; additionally, no more than 4 per month can be given away for other events and marketing at the team's discretion.\n\nRationale\n\nWearables are a powerful tool for the DAO to reward the community. We start by rewarding great players and further rewarding winners of the guild leagues. These pieces will be effective as soon as assigned seating goes live.\n\nSome limited discretion is left for the team to give away 4 wearables per month for marketing and events purposes, but the total monthly amount specified above (3 + 6 + 4 = 13) is less than the ~30 per month that would go to the DAO if we expect 2 mints per month going forward. We look to the community to proposal how to allocate the remaining ~1/2 of the wearables as these community holdings are instantiated and begin to grow.",

      "title": "Incentivize ICE Poker Guild Owners and Players to Participate in Decentral Games Governance",
      "content": "**Background**\n\nWe currently have 2,733 native ICE Poker guilds that play an important role in acquiring, vetting, and managing our rapidly growing player-base, and 7,473 daily active ICE Poker players that provide player liquidity across our several ICE Poker venues in the metaverse. \n\nToday, a small percentage of the ICE Poker guild owners and players participate in DG governance. As active members in the community, ICE Poker guild owners and players are crucial in the long-term success of Decentral Games and ICE Poker, and the ecosystem will be stronger if they participate in governance.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nFour initiatives to incentivize ICE Poker guild owners and players to hold xDG and participate in Decentral Games governance:\n\n1. Airdrop 500 xDG per wearable to ICE Poker wearables owners, and 50 xDG to each delegated player\n\n2. Make Premium ICE Poker guild management tools accessible only to ICE Poker guild owners that hold 1k xDG per wearable\n\n3. Create three tiered ICE Poker guild leagues with monthly prizes in xDG\n\n4. Create player leaderboard with monthly prizes in ICE Poker wearables and xDG accessible only to delegated players that hold 100 xDG \n\n\n**1. xDG Airdrop to ICE Poker Wearables Owners and Players** \n\nAll current ICE Poker wearables holders will be airdropped 500 xDG and all delegated players will be airdropped 50 xDG in order to kickstart the best ecosystem distribution.\n\n*The airdrop will be 500 xDG per ICE Poker wearable and 50 xDG per delegated player held at the time of the snapshot. If you hold 12 ICE Poker wearables at the time of the airdrop, you will receive 6,000 xDG.*\n\n- Snapshot of wearables and delegated players will be taken at 6pm UTC, Feb 25th\n- Airdrop of xDG will happen at 6pm UTC, Feb 28th\n\n**2. Premium Guild Management Tools**\n\nAll ICE Poker guild owners will still have access to the Basic ICE Poker Guild management tools, and there will be a 1k xDG requirement per wearable to gain access to premium ICE Poker Guild management tools.\n\n*For example, if a guild has only 2 wearables, they unlock all features with only 2,000 xDG; if a guild has 12 wearables, they must maintain a balance of 12,000 xDG to unlock all features.*\n\nBasic ICE Poker Guild Package\n\n- Able to mint during ICE Poker wearables drops (with current 1k xDG requirement)\n- Native delegation of ICE wearables \n- Trustless daily revenue share and payouts\n\nPremium ICE Poker Guild Package\n*Features available for guilds who meet staking requirement (1k xDG per wearable)*\n\n- Delegation dashboard \n    - See historical performance per player\n    - Delegate and undelegate from the dashboard\n    - View historical ICE earnings of your guild\n- Ability to name your guild and players\n- Access to ICE Poker player lookup tool to allow guild owners to see past performance of a player before delegating (in development)\n- Ability to add a manager to your guild who can view your delegation dashboard and make delegations/undelegations on your behalf (in development)\n\nAdditional premium features will be developed over time to further improve the ICE Poker guild management experience.\n\n**3. ICE Poker Guild Leagues**\n\nBased on your guild size and respective xDG stake, your guild can join an ICE Poker league, featuring month-long seasons with prizes distributed in xDG.\n\n*To qualify for an ICE Poker league, you must meet the xDG staking requirement at any time during the season.*\n\n5k xDG (5+ Players) - Fren League\n- 1st place: $2k in xDG\n- 2nd place: $1k in xDG\n- 3rd place: $500 in xDG\n- 4th place: $250 in xDG\n- 5th place: $100 in xDG\n\n10k xDG (10+ Players) - Ape League\n- 1st place: $5k in xDG\n- 2nd place: $2.5k in xDG\n- 3rd place: $1.3k in xDG\n- 4th place: $700 in xDG\n- 5th place: $350 in xDG\n\n25k xDG (25+ Players) - Chad League\n- 1st place: $10k in xDG\n- 2nd place: $5k in xDG\n- 3rd place: $3k in xDG\n- 4th place: $1.5k in xDG\n- 5th place: $750 in xDG\n\n*Note: We will not start distributing prizes until assigned seating is live.*\n\nExtra Chad League Feature: Submit name/logo to create custom non-ICE guild wearables (via a template for shirts, polos, jerseys, or hoodies) for 25k ICE, plus 500 ICE per wearable. Guild owners will be able to mint these for their players to wear to represent their guild during gameplay.\n\nScoring\n\nEach guild will receive a Guild Score calculated by: \n\nGuild score = (net chips)/(number of wearables active)^0.9\n\nNet chips = total net winnings of all the players within your guild within the season time frame\nNumber of wearables active = maximum number of wearables active in your guild at any point during the season \n\nThe 5 top scoring guilds of each ICE Poker league will receive xDG prizes claimable at the end of the season.\n\nRules\n\n- You are removed from the league if you drop below the xDG staking requirement mid-season\n- You can join any league mid-season, but you can only join one league per season\n- If you join a league mid-season, your Guild Score is only based on the player data after you join\n\n**4. Delegated Player Leaderboard with Monthly Prizes in Wearables and xDG**\n\nAll delegated players who hold 100 xDG will be included on a delegated player leaderboard based on net chips featuring monthly prizes in wearables and xDG: \n\n- 1st place: ICE wearable \n- 2nd place: ICE wearable\n- 3rd place: ICE wearable\n- 4th place: $500 in xDG\n- 5th place: $250 in xDG\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe 500 xDG airdrop per wearable and 50 xDG airdrop per delegated player will reward early ICE Poker guild owners and players, and position the Decentral Games community for growth and highly engaged governance participation going forward. \n\nPremium ICE Poker guild management tools and gamified ICE Poker guild leagues will further incentivize guild owners to hold xDG and actively participate in Decentral Games governance. As owners of several ICE wearables, guild owners will make community decisions that directly impact their livelihood and solidify the long-term sustainability of the ICE Poker ecosystem in which they operate.\n\nA leaderboard with prizes accessible to delegated players who hold 100 xDG will incentivize delegated players to participate in Decentral Games governance and give the top 3 players the opportunity to graduate to player-ownership each month.

      "title": "Allow Partnered Metaverse Advertisements in ICE Poker Venues",
      "content": "**Background**\n\nWe now have the ability to easily place and update video, audio, and still image content in several strategic yet non-intrusive locations within the ICE Poker - Stronghold venue, and we plan to add this support to the DEXT Lounge and Chateau Satoshi as well. \n\nICE Poker currently welcomes 7,000+ metaverse-native daily active users (and counting) across 3 of the top 4 most populated venues in Decentraland, the largest open metaverse platform by DAU and valuation.\n\nMeanwhile, many well-known, established companies have committed considerable resources towards a metaverse/NFT presence for their brand and business. \n\n**Proposal**\n\nAllow the team to conduct advertising deals where approved partners would be able to place video, audio and/or still image ads within the ICE Poker venues in exchange for stablecoins (USDC, USDT, and/or DAI) to be used for one or more of the following at the DG team's discretion: \n\n- buy $ICE to burn \n- add to ICE-USDC Quickswap LP\n- buy $DG \n\nAt the end of each month, the DG team would disclose the ad revenue totals and specific allocation of funds towards the items listed above to the community. \n\n**Rationale**\n\nThere lies tremendous untapped value in being one of the most frequented open metaverse destinations and allowing approved partners to pay to target our community of metaverse-native players. There is no other service currently available in the open metaverse that allows the direct targeting of this amount of daily active metaverse users, so there could be a sizable premium big brands are willing to pay.\n\nBy launching a strategic metaverse advertising arm, we would be first-movers in the nascent metaverse advertising space, with all value being given back to the community. The advertising revenue would further contribute to the long-term sustainability and growth of the Decentral Games ICE Poker ecosystem.",

      "title": "Update ICE Poker Leaderboard Multipliers",
      "content": "**Background**\n\nThere was a DG governance proposal submitted last week to update the multipliers – it had majority votes for yes, but unfortunately did not reach quorum. \n\nThe current leaderboard multipliers are: \n\nChips Percentile - Multiplier\n\n5% - 2x\n10% - 1.75x\n15% - 1.5x\n20% - 1.35x\n25% - 1.2x\n30% - 1.1x\n35% - 1x\n40% - 0.95x\n45% - 0.9x\n50% - 0.85x\n55% - 0.75x\n60% - 0.7x\n65% - 0.65x\n70% - 0.6x\n75% - 0.55x\n80% - 0.5x\n85% - 0.45x\n90% - 0.4x\n95% - 0.35x\n100% - 0.3x\n\n\n**Proposal**\n\nUpdate the ICE Poker leaderboard multipliers to:\n\nChips Percentile - Multiplier\n\n5% - 2x\n10% - 1.75x\n15% - 1.5x\n20% - 1.35x\n25% - 1.2x\n30% - 1.1x\n35% - 1.05x\n40% - 1x\n45% - 0.95x\n50% - 0.9x\n55% - 0.8x\n60% - 0.7x\n65% - 0.6x\n70% - 0.5x\n75% - 0.4x\n80% - 0.3x\n85% - 0.2x\n90% - 0.15x\n95% - 0.1x\n100% - 0.05x\n\nThis new structure is a bit smaller of a change from the last multiplier update proposal. It would leave multipliers the same for the top 5% to top 30%, increase multipliers for top 30% to top 55%, and decrease multipliers for the bottom 35% – all while ensuring that everyone who completes challenges receives ICE.\n\n\n**Rationale**\n\nIt is imperative for the long term health and sustainability of the ICE Poker ecosystem to incentivize upward mobility and re-investment of ICE rewards. If delegated players have guaranteed steady income regardless of performance and skill level, they are unlikely to want to graduate and re-invest their ICE rewards to mint and become player-owners and eventually guild owners. \n\nThis update to the leaderboard multipliers would further position managing a guild as a means of achieving steady revenue from ICE Poker ecosystem participation because the number of players in your guild will reduce the variance of payouts. Furthermore, ICE rewards for folks who own wearables have much more utility as they can be burned for upgrades.",

      "title": "Update ICE Poker Rewards Split to Incentivize Wearable Upgrades and Player Ownership ",
      "content": "**Background**\n\nToday, delegated ICE Poker players earn 70% of ICE rewards, while NFT owners earn 30% – regardless of wearable rank:\n\nRank 1: 70 / 30\nRank 2: 70 / 30\nRank 3: 70 / 30\nRank 4: 70 / 30\nDiamond Hands: 70 / 30\n\nAs wearables are upgraded by their owners, the earnings multiplier associated with that wearable increases:\n\nRank 1: 1 - 7%\nRank 2: 8 - 15% \nRank 3: 16 - 24%\nRank 4: 25 - 34%\nDiamond Hands: 35 - 45%\n\nDue to the constant 70% player / 30% delegator split, higher rank wearables give a proportional increase in ICE rewards to both players and ICE Poker NFT owners, while the owner is bearing 100% of the upgrade cost. Additionally, the jump from being a delegated player to an ICE Poker NFT owner is from 70% to 100% of the payout, which is only a 42.9% increase in rewards.\n\n\n**Proposal**\n\nUpdate the ICE Poker NFT Player/Delegator split to: \n\nRank 1: 60 / 40\nRank 2: 57 / 43\nRank 3: 54 / 46\nRank 4: 51 / 49\nDiamond Hands: 48 / 52\n\n***Note: If a delegated player is playing with 2 or more delegated wearables, then the split would be based on the highest ranked wearable.***\n\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe rationale for increasing the split by level is to further incentivize owners to burn ICE to upgrade wearables. Consider today – a Level 5 wearable has ~36% higher expected earnings than a Level 1. With these proposed changes, expected earnings would be ~77% higher (based on (0.52/0.4)*1.36). 70% of the incremental value from upgrading an NFT accrues to the delegated player; the NFT owner is bearing the expense of upgrading the item, and it makes sense for more of the incremental ICE earnings to accrue mostly to the owner. This new tiered system accrues most of the increased bonus to the owner yet still gives upside to the player for them to want to play with higher ranked wearables.\n\nThe rationale for increasing the baseline delegator split from 30% to 40% is to further incentivize player ownership. Player ownership and upward mobility (getting your own wearable and then delegating them to build your own guild) are essential for ICE ecosystem sustainability. And at the current split, the jump from earning 70% as a delegated player to earning 100% playing with your own item (42.9% increase in rewards) is not large enough of a jump for many to justify purchasing their own wearable. With the proposed 60% rewards as a delegated player to 100% playing with your own item (66.7% increase in rewards), purchasing your own wearable is a much more attractive proposition. \n\nFurthermore, wearables owners are more inclined to reinvest their earnings back into items (upgrading or buying new ones) at a higher rate. Ecosystem long-term sustainability is paramount and will ultimately result in better payouts for everyone over a longer time horizon. ",

We will continue to price drops in ETH with the exception of a monthly ICE drop. \n\nProposal\n\nFor the following two drops that are priced in ETH, give the DG Team discretion to use the mint proceeds across the following 3 areas:\n\n(1) Adding to DAO's ICE & DG LP positions\n(2) Buying back DG; goes into 'DG Treasury' in DAO\n(3) Establishing initial stable coin reserves\n\nRationale\n\n(1) Nearly all set here, but we're a little short of $5M ETH-DG LP target now that ETH has declined, and we'd also like to have ~$1M more LP for Matic DG for more depth on Polygon (Note: $1M in LP requires $0.5M ETH --> Matic since the other side of the pair is DG). \n\n(2) Based on the expectation that we will generate > $5M in revenue this month (that's > $60M annualized, even assuming no growth) and $DG has a circulating market cap of ~$110M, we believe the token is significantly undervalued. Buying back some of the token today for future use (e.g. distributions to xDG holders) is a good use of funds at this time.\n\n(3) Most of the assets in the DAO (e.g. Matic, LAND) are highly-correlated with ETH and the broader crypto market, so it makes sense to start establishing a hedge. \n\nNote: If the vote is 'NO', the DAO would hold onto the ETH until another proposal were passed outlining the use of some/all of the funds.

The DG-xDG Pool has ~$1.2M in Liquidity (link below). \n\nUniSwap v3 is launching on Polygon per a recently passed DAO proposal (link below). Details and a comparison of v3 and v2 can be found here: https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3/. \n\nProposal\n\nOnce live, make the DAO's DG-xDG pool on QuickSwap v3 rather than v2. The liquidity will be provided over a tight range (always <1% slippage) and the range will be manually adjusted periodically to reflect the DG <-> xDG exchange rate (i.e. \"the peg\") one can get on ETH Mainnet by staking there. \n\nRationale\n\nIt's summed up well by the blog post above: On v3, “LPs can provide the same liquidity depth as v2 within specified price ranges while putting far less capital at risk.” Right now, using v2, the peg can be off significantly on QuickSwap vs. the peg from staking on ETH mainnet and we require people to bridge and arb to bring the pools back into balance. v3 will be much more efficient. \n\nLinks\n\nDG-xDG Pool on QuickSwap: https://info.quickswap.exchange/#/pair/0x9a0d115a4b9a2ba3c8f84516823f49a3fd59a180\n\nUniSwap Governance Proposal: https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/2/10",

      "content": "Background\n\nThe DG DAO currently provides ~$2.8M in New DG-ETH LP on Uni-v2, and we still have ~$2.3M in Old DG-ETH LP there as well. Since we end LP rewards for Old DG upon token split and as holders have migrated ~70% of Old DG to New DG in the week post-split, we have seen Old DG LP fall from ~$7M to ~$2.3M. This is expected. \n\nPer previously passed proposal #QmfEtes, now that the DG DAO can afford to its preferable for us to provide liquidity ourselves instead of paying for liquidity with increased DG emission (rewards). We also have open proposal #QmcSKku to potentially contribute liquidity. The DG DAO Gameplay Hot Wallet has ~200K MANA. \n\nProposal\n\nConvert 100K MANA from DAO Gameplay Hot Wallet to ETH, pair with New DG from DAO DG Wallet and add ~$700K to the DAO's New DG-ETH LP Position in Liquidity Provided.\n\nRationale\n\nThis proposal suggests targeting > $5M as a sustainable level of ETH mainnet DEX liquidity for DG, and converting this MANA would help us get there. The specific target figure comes from conversation with IndexCoop who sets $5M for their bar for continued inclusion in their Indexes (e.g. $MVI) and inclusion in new Indexes. In general though, outside of that specific use-case, slippage is pretty high with the level of liquidity we have now for New DG, and feedback received from investors and community members is that this slippage makes it challenging to trade large positions. \n\nThe remaining 100K MANA in the Gameplay Hot Wallet would be more than sufficient to back bets, and, as we continue to accumulate MANA, we can continue to also use this source of funds to pay for wearable submissions per proposal #Qme1xWn.\n\nLinks\n\nNew DG-ETH LP on Uni-v2: https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x3df70e5b6edead5277590d3de5731d17f46e043b\n\nOld DG-ETH LP on Uni-v2: https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x44c21f5dcb285d92320ae345c92e8b6204be8cdf\n\nDG DAO Treasury Contents: https://decentral.games/dg/treasury",

      "content": "Background\n\nThere have been 3 ICE Poker NFT drops which included 4 collections and raised 50 ETH (0.1 x 500 items), 125 ETH (0.25 x 500 items), and 250 ETH (0.25 x 1,000 items) each. The 425 ETH was converted to USDC and used to add to the DG DAO's USDC-ICE LP position which now sits at ~$6.3M. We expect to do 2 more drops this month.\n\nProposal\n\nFor the following two drops, give the DG Team discretion to use the mint proceeds across the following 4 areas:\n\n-- ICE-USDC LP\n-- Buying Back ICE in order to burn it\n-- Providing New DG - ETH LP on UniSwap\n-- Providing New DG - Matic LP on QuickSwap\n\nRationale\n\nSince the ICE Burned/Earned ratio of 0.6 is less than 1, we do need to use some revenue to buyback and support the price of ICE. Axie and other p2e ecosystems sustain at far lower ratios than 0.6, and this level is very sustainable as only a fraction of revenue will be used for buybacks. As we buyback, we don't want the DAO to be front-run and it's useful to have some discretion to react to market conditions regarding exactly how much to buyback. The majority of the funds would still be used to provide liquidity.\n\nPrior to the token redenomination, we incentivized Old DG-ETH LP with DG rewards and had ~$7M in LP in that pair. Today, we have ~$3.2M in New DG-ETH LP and ~$2.6M in Old DG-ETH LP. We expect the Old DG LP to trend toward 0 as holders migrate to New DG. In order for new buyers and indexes to make large DEX transactions, we view > $5M in New DG-ETH LP as a target level. We might also want to add some liquidity to New DG on QuickSwap since there is only $0.6M there. Of the 4 sections, New DG-Matic LP is the least urgent so additions pending available funds.\n\nFinally, this proposal restricts the discretion to 2 drops so that the community can weigh in on the Team's decisions here and we can revisit how we want to handle future drops as a DAO.\n\nLinks\n\nUniSwap New DG-ETH LP: https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x3df70e5b6edead5277590d3de5731d17f46e043b\n\nUniSwap Old DG-ETH LP: https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x44c21f5dcb285d92320ae345c92e8b6204be8cdf\n\nQuickSwap New DG-Matic LP: https://info.quickswap.exchange/pair/0x71bd159cf9136d038a60f10118741dfcb10c3111\n\nQuickSwap ICE-USDC LP:\nhttps://info.quickswap.exchange/pair/0x9e3880647c07ba13e65663de29783ecd96ec21de",

This has been a very large source of emission/inflation on the token. Now that the DG DAO can afford to supply $DG LP across ETH Mainnet and Polygon Network ourselves, we should make this move to end rewards. We can concentrate on rewarding those staking in Governance.

(See: wallet.polygon.technology/staking/validators/13)\n\nProposal\n\nEstablish a $3M Matic-DG Pool on QuickSwap by pairing $1.5M Matic taken from the DG DAO's node and pairing it with DG from the DAO's \"$DG Wallet\". This liquidity would remain in the DAO in the \"Liquidity Provided\" section. \n\nRationale\n\nAs we continue to build on Polygon and have substantial ICE-USDC LP (~ $5M) & DG-xDG LP (~$4M pending proposal #QmapRUZ), it makes sense for there to be DG liquidity for community members and investors to trade in and out of their positions. Matic is the logical token pair with because it has the deepest liquidity across other pairs on Polygon. \n\nPreviously, we either made due with < $1M in Polygon LP on QuickSwap incentivized by QUICK rewards or effectively paid for LP via partnerships with DEXes like DinoSwap. QUICK rewards continue to decrease and DEX partnerships are expensive. Another alternative would have been to incentivize LP directly via DG emission (rewards), but this is not a good use of DG given we can afford to supply the LP ourselves. While we forgo ~13% APY on this $1.5M Matic, this is a relatively small opportunity for $3M in LP that we don't need to pay for. ",

      "content": "Background\n\n$DG holders that stake their $DG in Governance receive an APY paid in $DG and proportional voting rights in the DG DAO. Today, there is ~230K $DG staked in Governance (~$59M USD) and we pay 600 $DG/week to stakers, which represents ~13.4% APY. Staking, unstaking, and claiming the $DG earned from staking are all ETH Mainnet transactions. \n\nWith the upcoming 1:1,000 $DG token split recently approved by the DAO, we have a natural opportunity to upgrade the $DG governance contract since existing stakers will need to unstake, swap Old $DG for New $DG, and restake their positions. \n\nProposal\n\nFor New $DG, introduce xDG, which represents a fractional ownership stake in the $DG governance pool. In this framework, $DG governance rewards would be deposited directly into the pool and xDG appreciates in value compared to $DG. \n\nRationale\n\nRather than paying to claim rewards, the APY auto-compounds into xDG. $DG governance positions would also be able to be traded directly via xDG rather than needing to pay to stake and unstake $DG. \n\nSide Note: Sushi is a good example of a project using this structure today.\nhttps://docs.sushi.com/faq-1/xsushi-faq",

As DAO’s continue to gain popularity, we would like to keep up with the trends and increase our total token supply to reflect more popular DAOs on the market today. \n\nProposal\n\nOur proposal is to apply a token split of 1:1000 for the native $DG token.\n\n\nAn acceptance of this proposal would require the Decentral Games team to redeploy a few things to cater to the new token, including:\n\nA new $DG token contract\n$DG bridge contract that burns old $DG, swaps to new $DG\nnew governance contract that supports new $DG\nnew Liquidity Rewards contract that supports new Uni pair with new $DG\nnew $DG bridge and token contract on Polygon\nnew $DG rewards contract on Polygon\n\nRationale\n\nWe believe that unit bias has restricted many new gamers and crypto enthusiasts to own and participate in our governance. The lower price point of the token plus the increased supply will allow the token to be more accessible and owner-friendly to more users of our platform.

[Note: ATRI price has declined substantially since the token was added]. \n\nAt the same time, there has been interest from the community in adding $DG as a gameplay token for some time now, and there's also some interest in the new ICE token being available for gameplay. \n\nProposal\n\n-- Add $DG & ICE as gameplay options\n-- Back $DG bets with $150K out of $DG Treasury\n-- Back ICE bets with $150K out of initial ICE supply\n-- Remove USDT & ATRI as gameplay options\n-- Convert the ~$210K worth of USDT & ATRI in the gameplay treasury to USDC, pair with ICE, and provide ~$420K LP to the USDC-ICE pair on QuickSwap\n\nRationale\n\nLooking at USD-value gameplay volumes since May 1st, the distribution is as follows, and it's clear we're not getting significant use out of USDT or ATRI: \n\n-- MANA: 40.9%\n-- DAI: 31.3%\n-- ETH: 23.1%\n-- USDT: 3.5%\n-- ATRI: 1.2%\n\nMaking $DG and ICE available as options would add additional utility to the tokens, and ~$420K incremental USDC-ICE LP is more useful to the DAO than availability of USDT & ATRI gameplay. \n\nWhether or ICE profits should be burned in order to produce deflationary pressure on the token will be left for a future proposal.

To date, these funds have been re-staked in growing the DAO’s position. \n\nToday, project runway is being used to provide Polygon to pay fees for the 8 worker wallets that pay Polygon transaction fees to operate the games.

The current APY is ~76%, and there is ~$2.2M in liquidity for this pair.\n\nProposal\n\nReduce these rewards to 175 $DG/week for the next period (8/5 - 9/8).\n\nRationale \n\nAfter 10 weeks at 225 $DG/week, this would get us back to our trend since launch of decreasing LP emission over time. We have been growing total liquidity on other platforms and chains -- QuickSwap (Polygon), PancakeSwap (BSC), and SushiSwap (ETH) -- so there's room to reduce this source of emission a bit. It's still valuable to have 7-figure ETH mainnet liquidity, however, so we shouldn't reduce too drastically.",

Today, it's $340,000 USD. Setting the precise bar to (1) Encourage community participation and (2) Ensure we receive proposals from those with a material stake will always be a judgement call, but the sense is that that 1% is a bit too high and 0.5% would be more appropriate at this stage. \n\nFollowing the failure of Proposal #QmcgLZz to pass even though it received 30,520 $DG YES and 0 $DG NO has led us to conclude that 15% of circulating supply (~36,000 $DG) is too steep a quorum requirement. Reaching 10% would still require significant community support. ",

      "content": "There recently has been a debate within the Decentraland community to require approval from the Decentraland DAO before minting any wearables: \n\n\"The new Wearable builder has been announced and with it the details for how collections get approved and minted. https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/introducing-wearables-editor/ Early on in the discussion of the wearable builder the Decentraland foundation said the new collections would go through a committee and a DAO vote before being able to be minted. This was to make sure the Wearables were compatible and able to work in world as well as having a quality control to make sure the collection was wanted in world ny the community.\n\nNow they have removed the DAO Vote from the process. Without a vote by the community the ecosystem will be flooded by collections of wearables. Some issues that could arise from a lack of quality control and moderation:\n\n- Low effort wearables (single image on a plane t-shirt)\n- wearables with no community interest\n- Major drop in value for all wearables\n- flooded marketplace with low demand\n\nArtist should be able to express their creativity and fashion without destroying or disrupting the ecosystem. There also should be interest for new collections and not just collections being minted because one person wants a shirt or other wearable. Fees for minting a collection can only do so much for moderation. If anything it only prices out artist.\n\nSo I call for a vote on whether or not new wearable collections should have a DAO vote before being minted.\n\nHappy to hear feedback or other ideas on the forum as there is always more ways to solve an issue.\"\n\nShould the DG DAO vote YES or NO on this proposal?",

      "title": "Decentraland DAO Proposal: Revised proposal for wearable publication fees  ",
      "content": "There recently has been a debate within the Decentraland community to add fees to mint wearables: \n\n\"Summary\n\nThis is an updated version of a previous proposal for wearable publication fees. After receiving feedback and input from the community, the previous proposal has been updated to more accurately reflect the risk that a flood of NFT wearables poses to the platform.\n\nOverview\n\nThe Wearables Editor will allow community content creators to upload collections of the 3D models and textures needed to mint NFT wearables. Before these wearable collections may be minted, they will have to pass through a publication process - part of which includes content moderation and approval to vet out spam and submissions that violate Decentraland's Content Policy.\n\nHowever, there remains the risk that creators will submit an excessive volume of collections, and/or that collections will be submitted with low-quality content.\n\nThis introduces several very significant risks to the entire Decentraland platform:\n\nA high volume of submissions will slow the approval process for other creators\n\nThe Catalyst nodes that serve the content for Decentraland incur additional CPU, storage, and bandwidth costs for every wearable item added to the platform\n\nWhen exploring the world, users must download and render every custom wearable encountered\n\nOther dApps within the Decentraland platform must process every additional added item, negatively impacting their performance for users\n\nGiven the immutability of NFTs, wearables minted in Decentraland will be present forever. They cannot be removed. So, any detrimental effects they have on the performance of the platform cannot be removed.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, it is proposed that the DAO collect a publication fee for each item within a collection, regardless of the rarity selected when minting those items. This fee is not applied to every NFT minted from each item, only the item.\n\nThis fee will be transferred to the DAO and may help fund community grants, reimburse the Curation Committee for their work in vetting submissions, and other initiatives as seen fit by the community.\n\nThese fees can always be lowered or increased, but NFTs can never be removed from the platform.\n\nBenefits\n\nDisincentivize creators from submitting spam, thus increasing the rate at which legitimate submissions are approved and published\n\nPromotes the submission of very high quality wearables\n\nProtects the Decentraland platform from a permanent drop in performance due to a flood of NFT wearables\n\nSpecification\n\nEach time a creator submits a collection in the Wearables Editor for publication, they must pay a fee in MANA (at the rate decided on by the DAO) for each item. These fees are charged per item in a collection, not per NFT minted from an item.\n\nFor example, if an X MANA fee is approved by the DAO, the fees would be as follows.\n\n- 1 Unique item - 1 NFT - total minting cost X MANA\n- 1 Mythic Item - 10 NFTs - total minting cost X MANA\n- 1 Legendary Item - 100 NFTs - total minting cost X MANA\n- 1 Epic item - 1000 NFTs - total minting cost X MANA:\"\n\nHow should the DG DAO vote on this Decentraland DAO proposal?",

Implementing this feature would allow any player to delegate VP to another player by visiting the following link and entering another player's address and the space: snapshot.dcl.eth\n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/delegate\n\nWhy would you want to delegate voting power to another player?\n\nThere are a few reasons a player may want to delegate VP. Many players I have spoken with tend to store their parcels in a separate address, typically a cold wallet, that lends operator rights to their playable (hot) address. This proposal is an effort to preserve the security of those assets while being able to exercise the voting power they represent.\n\nA second reason arises from the notion of proxying your vote. Not all players or asset holders will participate in proposal review and voting, especially as the number of proposals to the DOA grows. This proposal allows passive investors to exercise their VP by delegating it to players who have a shared vision for the future of Decentraland.\"\n\nShould DG vote Yes or No on this Decentraland DAO proposal?",

We have ~$6.7M in liquidity for this pair on Uni-v2 and the DAO provides ~$1.7M in liquidity for the same pair on Uni-v3 (app.uniswap.org/#/pool/16252). \n\nWe also have 2 pools of L2 $DG liquidity on QuickSwap (w/ ~100% APY in QUICK) and an ETH-$DG pool on SushiSwap (w/ ~100% APY in SUSHI). \n\nProposal\n\n5/25 - 6/29, decrease Uni-V2 ETH-$DG LP rewards to 225 $DG/week. Unless the DAO votes otherwise, ETH-$DG Uni-v2 LP rewards will end after 6/29. \n\nRationale\n\nAt 225 $DG/week, the expected APY is ~37%. Near the end of June, the DAO can reevaluate and elect to extend rewards past 6/29. Either way, over the medium-term, we hope to convert current Uni-v2 ETH-$DG LP stakers into $DG governance stakers which continues to offer ~35% APY. We also expect to offer continue to offer additional yield farming opportunities, like SushiSwap and QuickSwap, with more potentially coming soon. \n\nAs a side note: The DG whitepaper did not explicitly say how long LP rewards would be funded, but 6/29 will mark 30 weeks since the launch of the rewards. With the Uni-v3 liquidity the DAO provides itself and other avenues for community members to yield farm using $DG (e.g. QuickSwap, SushiSwap), we should decrease this source of inflation for $DG holders if possible.

      "content": "[Written by & Submitted on behalf of INDEX Team]\n\nSummary\n\nPropose the Decentral Games treasury diversifies $200K of MANA holdings into a productive MVI/ETH LP position to earn $INDEX tokens and invest in the wider metaverse theme.\n\nAbstract\n\nMVI is designed to capture the trend of business, entertainment and social activity shifting to take place in a virtual environment. The index is built on Set Protocol V2 contracts and managed by DarkForestCapital and Verto0912 as community methodologists from Index Coop. Tokens in the index are rebalanced based on relative market cap and aggregate liquidity every month, full details of the methodology including what constitutes an inclusion and how projects are assessed can be found here.\n\nWhile the methodologists look to market, integrate and improve the utility of MVI, they also work closely with the community at Index Coop to lean on their expertise and network to make sure the product is the best it can be. Part of that role is to communicate the benefits of holding the index compared to the individual tokens and look to share the benefits with both individual and organisational level investors.\n\nThe $DG token will make up 4.3% of MVI after the April rebalance, but with MVI, holders also get exposure to Decentraland’s MANA, NFTX and Rarible to name just a few. \n\nMotivation\n\nThe motivation to hold MVI comes down to improving risk-adjusted returns vs holding individual metaverse tokens like $DG (or the $MANA in the treasury). While the Decentral Games treasury is already pretty well diversified, providing liquidity to the MVI/ETH pair will earn $INDEX tokens, currently at 28% APR. This builds a bank of tokens from the DeFi sector adding even more diversification, and compensating for the potential impermanent loss that can take place in a liquidity pool. \n\nThere is another aspect motivating this proposal. As methodologists for MVI we are looking to be involved with DG for the long term. Having held our launch party in Tominoya Casino and worked with the DG team to arrange the event we were extremely impressed with the level of professionalism and are keen to maintain a close relationship with the project and community. We have the ability to vote using the DG tokens held within the MVI index and will be looking to get involved in governance and become a trusted partner in time. We see the ability for DG to farm INDEX as a way to solidify the partnership between the two projects.\n\nSpecification\n\nThanks to our exchange issuance module it is possible to purchase $200k of MVI with less than 0.5% slippage. Exchange Issuance has been designed as a one click solution in cases where reducing slippage is more important than the gas cost associated with purchasing multiple tokens, i.e very large trades. The function will swap the input token (ETH recommended) for all of the underlying tokens in the correct proportion and subsequently issue MVI tokens using the best prices from either Uniswap and Sushiswap. $INDEX rewards for LPs are currently at 28% APR based on a pool size of $7m on Uniswap.",

      "content": "Background\n\nToday, the ETH-$DG pair on UniSwap has ~$13M in Uni-v2 LP. Of that, the DG DAO provides ~$1.8M itself. At the time of writing, the ratio of ETH-to-$DG is approximately 1-to-10. \n\nUniSwap v3 launched yesterday. Details and a comparison of v3 and v2 can be found here: https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3/. On v3, “LPs can provide the same liquidity depth as v2 within specified price ranges while putting far less capital at risk.”\n\nProposal\n\n(1) Convert 250K DAI to ~$250K ETH, pair with $250K $DG from the Treasury, and add $0.5M to the DAO's ETH-$DG LP position.\n\n(2) Move the DAO provided ETH-$DG LP to Uni-v3. Suggested initial range: Down to ~1/2 of the current ratio, up to ~2x the current ratio. \n\n(3) The DG Team has discretion to move the range over which liquidity is provided real time. \n\nRationale\n\nOver the specified range (1/2, 2x), Uni-v3 LP will be ~3.5x as efficient as Uni-v2 LP. With ~$2.3M in DG DAO provided LP on Uni-v3, we expect slippage to be the same as if ~8M in LP were provided on Uni-v2. \n\nAfter the changeover, we expect to still have over ~$11M in ETH-$DG LP on Uni-v2, so we will have ample liquidity for traders who want to exchange on v2 or v3. \n\nIt’s important for the DG Team to manage the specified price range of the Uni-v3 liquidity in the case that “active management” is required. From the Uni-v3 blog post, the scenario we’d like to avoid is “market prices [moving] outside an LP’s specified price range” and “liquidity is effectively removed from the pool and is no longer earning fees.” As an example, if the ratio of ETH-to-$DG moves from 1-to-10 to 1-to-6, we might want to move our specified range to ~3 < $DG/ETH < ~12.

      "title": "Add ETH as a Gameplay Option",
      "content": "Introduction:\n\nI propose adding ETH as a game currency for blackjack and roulette in the Decentral Games casino. \n\nProposal:\n\nETH is a coin that nearly every single Ethereum wallet has. People use it every day to pay gas fees. A growing narrative within the Ethereum community is that “ETH is ultrasound money”. It is the largest coin within the Ethereum ecosystem by far. Most users will have some amount of ETH in their wallets that can be used for gaming. This is a currency that the vast majority of users will not have to convert into in order to be able to gamble. Offering a currency that requires no conversion (because they already own it) decreases deposit friction and should lead to more deposits and higher revenue for the DG treasury. \n\nSome statistics (from Coingecko.com/tether.to on April 8, 2021):\n\nMarket cap of MANA = $1.3 billion.\nMarket cap of DAI = $3.1 billion.\nMarket cap of USDT (on Ethereum) = $22.5 billion.\nMarket cap of ETH = $240 billion.\n\nWhen targeting users that are not interested in converting their coins to be able to deposit on Decentral Games, we are increasing the total addressable market (TAM) from $26.9 billion in value to $266.9 billion in value. It is also a coin that is in almost everyone’s wallet and that they are used to spending for gas fees. Increasing the TAM by 10x with the most popular coin in the Ethereum ecosystem is a high-value proposition that will improve the UX and has a high probability of increasing revenue. \n\nExecution:\n\nIf implemented, this is how I propose it to be done. \n\nThe team will deposit 50 ETH of their own money that will be donated to the Gameplay portion of the treasury to back bets. This way we will not have to move ETH from any other part of the treasury to fund this proposal. I spoke to the team directly and they provided authorization for this donation. \n\nThe UI will appear as follows. There will be four bet sizes for roulette and blackjack. These sizes will be depicted as fractions because they look cleaner than decimals (for example 0.001 ETH does not look good). The sizes are: 1/1000, 1/100, 1/10, and 1. Those sizes translated to USD (at the time of this writing) = $2.10, $21, $210, and $2100. An oracle will be used to display the real-time USD value of each of those four bet sizes (underneath the chips, so the user does not have to do any math to calculate the USD value of how much he/she is betting). So for the bet sizes, the ETH amount will remain constant (1/1000, 1/100, 1/10, and 1) but the USD value will continuously change. If the ETH in the Gameplay portion of the treasury starts to get low, the team will add more ETH as needed. \n\nConclusion: \n\nIn closing, adding ETH as a game currency increases our TAM by 10x, increases the likelihood a user has an available currency to play with that requires no conversion, and is backed by a 50 ETH donation from the DG team to the DG treasury. Vote “Yes” to approve this proposal. \n",

      "content": "\n# Background\nUntil now several proposals have been presented and approved by the community and major holders all with a similar goal to reduce unnecessary inflation and maximize token value. The key proposals in this direction were:\n\n - [Remove balancers, allocate rewards to governance   #QmVjWKA](https://snapshot.page/#/decentralgames.eth/proposal/QmVjWKA6E6YVLw5cfYFDrDFf5gCnbD8NmCbFctWPHFn7Li)\n  - [Secure investors capital by reducing inflation  #QmYR224](https://snapshot.page/#/decentralgames.eth/proposal/QmYR224mJ6r7k5DDxgQ4m77MrCRd3znCMhEnurbU3cymYD)\n -  [Update LP Rewards Logic Starting 2/9   #QmRnnRA](https://snapshot.page/#/decentralgames.eth/proposal/QmRnnRAA3uHJjSvgMhLvigtapKRLNF1D5Wes5gVkRyJ1HX)\n  - [Increase Governance Rewards    #QmdofKf](https://snapshot.page/#/decentralgames.eth/proposal/QmdofKfXVadBcb8vEq6e2gRCN1X8TviCvUTUg7rLGQoSrq)\n -  [Treasury distribution    #QmYouTx](https://snapshot.page/#/decentralgames.eth/proposal/QmYouTxAxT7mZir9SbqWCsYuHEVGdybiUem3cboDoDkvoa)\n\nThe main achievements so far were to minimize emissions, by consequence, more tokens remain in the treasury accruing its value. Ultimately, more value in the treasury means more value for the token and its holders\n\nA new proposal was recently passed to increase governance staking rewards and at the same time reduce LP staking rewards, having an overall increase in DG regards:\n[Increase governance rewards to 1600 DG per week  #QmZzmMC](https://snapshot.page/#/decentralgames.eth/proposal/QmZzmMCZu41Qk1FAzukZQKM9xZzozvEhqR1UNcV69Woiau)\n\n# Proposal\nThis proposal seeks to partially revert #QmZzmMC in the following way:\nDo not change the current governance staking rewards and keep it at 1000 DG per week (reverting this decision)\n\nAt the same time, we welcome and confirm the decision to decrease the Uniswap LP rewards from 1000 DG to 700 DG per week \n\n# Rationale\nThe initial LP and governance emissions had a purpose and were extremely useful, by offering appealing rewards, decentral.games created awareness around the project.\nAt this stage increasing rewards for governance is not likely to produce any meaningful impact of new awareness, especially considering that the hunt for high yield attracts more short-term users the higher the yield.\nFurthermore, it is not sustainable to keep rewarding at a high APR. With a long-term view, it seems best to continue to gradually slow emissions leaving valuable assets in the treasury. These assets can be used at later stages for more impactful activities like marketing and partnerships\n\n",

      "title": "Update LP Rewards Logic Starting 2/9",
      "content": "Background\n\nThe reward rates for the MANA-$DG and DAI-$DG Balancer pools are currently 1,200 $DG/week each. Based on the prior LP Proposal (IPFS #QmUgKo9), Weeks 11 - 40 these rewards rates will be 600 $DG/week each. Likewise, weeks 11 - 65, rewards rate for the UniSwap V2 ETH-$DG pair is 600 $DG/week. \n\nProposal\n\nEliminate Balancer pool rewards for weeks 11 - 40 (starting February 9th). This frees up 36,000 $DG  (over $2M USD). Allocate ~60% of these savings (22,000 $DG) across 55 weeks to the Uniswap V2 ETH-$DG pool (400 $DG/week). The total LP rewards to the Uniswap V2 ETH-$DG pool would be 1,000 $DG/week for Weeks 11 - 65. \n\nFor the time being, the remaining 14,000 $DG this will accrue to the Decentral Games $DG Treasury and remain in the control of the DAO. \n\nRationale\n\nThe Balancer Pools don’t provide incremental liquidity to the Decentral Games ecosystem. Consider a 10,000 DAI → $DG trade via the Balancer Pool: This incurs 8.3% slippage. On UniSwap, since DAI-ETH is extremely liquid, the same single transaction done DAI → ETH → $DG only incurs 1.2% slippage. The same is true for large MANA transactions. By incentivizing even greater ETH-$DG UniSwap V2 liquidity, we actually generate more MANA-$DG and DAI-$DG liquidity and do so much more cheaply. \n\nI’m suggesting we apply the remaining 14,000 $DG to the Treasury for now, but do think this should all be applied back to LP as originally intended. There’s some interesting discussion around QuickSwap where we could add a L2 liquidity; other options include simply extending LP rewards past the 65 week mark or increasing ETH-$DG UniSwap V2 rewards.

      "title": "Increase $DG Gameplay Mining Rewards",
      "content": "**Background:**\n\nThe current gameplay mining rewards rates are: \n\n- DAI Roulette: 4K DAI : 1 DG\n- MANA Roulette: 48K MANA : 1 DG \n- DAI Blackjack: 8.4K DAI : 1 DG \n- MANA Blackjack: 100K MANA : 1 DG\n\nThe current price of $DG is ~$20. Based on the respective house edge and gameplay rewards rate in each game, the average cost to mine $DG is:\n\n- $50 per $DG with no bonuses\n- $36 per $DG with a 4-wearable bonus (+40%)\n- $30 per $DG with 4-wearable and 4-player bonus (+70%)\n\n**Proposal:**\n\nAdjust gameplay mining rates to: \n\n- DAI Roulette: 2.4K DAI : 1 DG \n- MANA Roulette: 29K MANA : 1 DG \n- DAI Blackjack: 5K DAI : 1 DG \n- MANA Blackjack: 60K MANA : 1 DG\n\nBased on the respective house edge and gameplay rewards rate in each game, the average cost to mine $DG would be:\n\n- $30 per $DG with no bonuses\n- $21 per $DG with a 4-wearable bonus (+40%)\n- $18 per $DG with 4-wearable and 4-player bonus (+70%)\n\nIt is important to note that this value (in MANA and DAI) flows into the treasury as players mine $DG through gameplay.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThis new $DG gameplay rewards rate would incentivize more players to play games and grow the treasury (currently $61,000 USD).\n",

      "title": "Adjust and Extend the LP Rewards",
      "content": "Background: \n\nThe rewards rate for the MANA-$DG and DAI-$DG Balancer pools are currently 2,400 $DG/week each. Based on the DG whitepaper, Weeks 6 - 10 these rewards rates will be 1,600 $DG/week each; Weeks 11 - 15, 1,000 $DG/week each; Weeks 16 - 40, 800 $DG/week each. \n\nThe DG Team has also chosen to fund 300 $DG/week in rewards for the Uniswap V2 ETH-$DG pool from the Ecosystem Fund, but there isn’t a published timetable yet for this allocation. \n\nProposal: \n\n1. Adjust the Balancer pool rewards to 1,200 $DG/week each for Weeks 6 - 10 and to 600 $DG/week each for the remainder of the 40 weeks. This frees up 18,000 $DG. \n\n2. Allocate this 18,000 $DG across 60 weeks to the Uniswap V2 ETH-$DG pool (300 $DG/week) on top of the 300 $DG/week from the Ecosystem Fund. The total LP rewards to the Uniswap V2 ETH-$DG pool would be 600 $DG/week for Weeks 6 - 65. \n\nRationale: \n\nThis new rewards schedule would be better for ecosystem growth: It will reduce short-term $DG inflation, extend LP rewards, and incentivize providing liquidity to the Uniswap V2 ETH-$DG pair which supports much larger $DG trades with less slippage because the ETH-$DG pair is 50/50 while the Balancer pools are 98/2. Side note: With the same liquidity, the Uniswap pool ties up 25x more $DG via staking, which should be a tailwind for the $DG price. \n\nThis new rewards schedule is also good for liquidity providers: It does not remove any rewards from the LP ecosystem; in fact, it codifies the 300 $DG/week Ecosystem Fund spend toward the ETH-$DG pair, increasing the total allocation to LP providers.
